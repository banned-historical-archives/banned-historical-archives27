 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX      February 15, 1966
 I wish to express my deep sympathy to
 the Thomas family and pray for God's
 blessings upon them to endure their
 sorrow.
 )E' MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 15, 1966
 Mr. VIVIAN.  Mr. Speaker, the Sec-
 ond District of Michigan, which I am
 privileged to represent :in this body, con-
 tains a number of excellent institutions
 of higher education.  Among them, of
 course, is the University of Michigan,
 one of the oldest and most distinguished
 State universities in the Nation, and, in-
 deed, one of the great universities in the
 world.
 Last week, :[ had the honor of being
 asked to serve as congressional host at
 1-lie 14th annual congressional dinner,
 held by the University of Michigan Club
 of Washington, D.C.  The main speaker
 that evening, Dr. Harlan H. Hatcher,
 projected the future of the university.
 As its president, Dr. Hatcher is, of course,
 concerned with that future.  But he is
 also vitally interested in the future of
 all higher education in this country.
 Under permission granted, I include
 at this point in the RECORD, an article by
 President Hatcher, discussing some of
 the trends in higher education.   The
 article appeared in the January 1966,
 issue of the Michigan Business Review,
 published by the Graduate School of
 Business Administration of the Univer-
 sity of Michigan.
 The article follows:
 NEW NEEDS AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES
 (By Harlan Hatcher)
 Lest me feed into your personal computers
 ;oame items of information, and then we can
 try  to  draw  some  conclusions  and  some
 new directions-
 Item:                     In    August,  the  Department  of
 Health,  Education,  and  Welfare  reported
 that during fiscal 1966 more than $3 billion
 will flow from the Federal Treasury through
 a single agency, the U.S. Office of Education,
 to schools and colleges, teachers and students,
 libraries and librarians. Since that report
 was made, the Higher Education Act of 1965
 has been signed by President Johnson, not-
 ably providing 140,000 undergraduate schol-
 arships.
 Item:  In fi:.r..al 1966, four of the largest
 Government agencies contracting with col-
 leges and universities for research-the Na-
 tional Science Foundation, Atomic Energy
 Commission, National Aeronautics and Space
 Administration, and the U.S. Public Health
 Service--will spend an estimated $840 million
 through our colleges and universities.  Please
 note that this figure does not include the
 operation of the research centers which a few
 ,)four universities administer for these agen-
 cies, nor does it include the training pro-
 p;rams of these agencies.
 item:  The published listing of the pro-
 grams for which Federal money will be spent
 in 1966 through the Office of Education in-
 cludes 67 titles.  Every one of them is mis-
 sion-oriented; every one of them has a given,
 specific purpose for which alone the money
 can be spent.  The grants and contracts for
 research  are equally specific  and project-
 centered.
 Item:  In 1 recent year, the total current
 :hind  income from all sources of all  our
 colleges and universities was $7.3 billion-
 ,nnly about twice the sum of the two Federal
 items I: have already mentioned.
 Item:  Corporate giving to higher educa-
 tion has risen from $80 million in 1754 to
 $250  million  in  19114--a  notable  ina:rease.
 'Rut sortie observers note a leveling-off n cor-
 porate giving and some murmurs are heard
 to the effect that such giving is new less
 necessary because of the influx of federal
 dollars.
 A CARROT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
 Let me make one other point con( 'riling
 the magnitude and nature of Federal :.nend-
 ing before turning to something else   Just
 a week ago, in reporting the cerem, ?ny of
 signing the Higher Education Act, the New
 York 'l'imes education editor, Mr. Fred Hech-
 L:ager, made this statement:  "The law is,
 perhaps first and foremost, a carrot 10 per-
 suade higher education that it ought io lead
 In the search for the Great Society."
 In other words, the legislation was vritten,
 not so much to help the colleges an l uni-
 versities reach the goals they have :et for
 themselves, but rather to use these i istitu-
 Lions to  achieve certain goals  for  ,ociety
 which the makers of the laws perceive.
 This  is,  of  course,  entirely legitimate.
 Setting goals for  the Nation and selecting
 methods for achieving them is a proper task
 of Government.     Participating in this task
 is also proper for education-but it is not
 the whole of the universities' responsil)ilities.
 CIMINISIIING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUBLIC AND
 PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS
 Now let us take a look: at another set of
 facts which have a bearing on the topic "New
 Needs and New Opportunities."
 We have long been accustomed in  this
 country to distinguishing between colleges
 and universities on the basis of wheth.'r they
 are "private" or "public."  We have to('ay 743
 institutions which are considered pubLi', and
 1,357 classed as private.  In the public insti-
 tutions, we have now well over 60 percent
 of all the students enrolled, and by 1980 prob-
 aably three-fourtlas of all our students will be
 in the public institutions.
 But this distinction between pub'.!c and
 private is harder and harder to mak .-and
 less and less significant.  Already, prig ate in-
 stitution.s of higher education receive, enor-
 mous sums  of  "public"  money-including
 more Federal research funds than go to all
 the so-called public institutions.  And con-
 versely, some of the public institutions own
 some of the largest endowments, even ! hough
 endowment is often considered the hallmark
 of the private college.
 Still another interesting developmer t is the
 growth of cooperative programs of :carious
 kinds which involve both public and private
 institutions.  I will cite just two, c, ntered
 in our own Midwest.  The Committee on In-
 stitutional Cooperation embraces the nine
 public universities of the Big 10 and the one
 private   member-Northwestern-plus   the
 University of Chicago.  The CIC is bluing a
 trail in interinstitutional cooperation which
 is being noted by educators throughout the
 country.  Another organization is the newly
 formed    Argonne  Universities Association,
 comprised of 16 public and 10 private insti-
 tutions.                                                                                This association will formulate pol-
 'ici.es for the operation of Argonne National
 Laboratory.
 DISTINCTION BETWEEN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY
 What we are seeing today is a blurring of
 the once sharp distinction between public
 and private and the emergence of another
 distinction of great importance.  Thin; is the
 distinction between college and univcrsity-
 certainly not a new phenomenon, but one
 that has great significance for us in this time
 of swift evolution of our total educational
 system.
 Traditionally, the emphasis of corporate
 giving has been upon the private colleges-
 the traditional 4-year liberal arts institution
 under private control.  The results are cause
 for national pride, for we have a truly out-
 standing group of private colleges--such in-
 stitutions as Amherst, Beloit, Carleton., and
 so on down the list.    Over the years, this
 Nation has looked to such institutions as
 these for its leaders in business, industry,
 government, and the professions.
 We still expect a considerable portion of
 our leadership to come from the liberal arts
 college, both public and private.  But today,
 more and more of those prospective leaders
 graduate from their liberal arts studies and
 go on to a university for advanced and pro-
 fessional training.  And this is the level--the
 graduate   school and   the   professional
 school-at which great now needs and op-
 portunities exist for private support.
 Perhaps I can illustrate this by mention-
 ing a report I received a few days ago from.
 the school of business administration of my
 own University of Michigan.  The report in-
 dicated that last year more than 20(1 cor-
 porations sent representatives to cur campus
 to  interview  prospective  graduates  about
 jobs.  The median starting salaries for the
 people employed by these companies were
 $590 per month for bachelor's degree people,
 and $700 for master's degree recipient:. The
 top salaries were $725 per month for the
 bachelor's degree and $1,350 for the master's.
 Obviously, our corporations place a consid-
 erable monetary value on graduate study.
 This is not a point which needs belaboring,
 for I think it is now widely recognized that
 as our total supply of knowledge expands--
 and it has been expanding at a dizzying rate
 this past half century-the number of years
 which an individual spends on his formal
 education. must likewise expand.   And we
 know also that these graduate and profes-
 sional programs of instruction are expen.
 sive, a great deal more expensive than the
 basic  4-year  undergraduate  liberal  arts
 sequence.
 NEW DIRECTIONS FOR  CORPORATE SUPPORT
 Out of these somewhat disparate items,
 let us now see if we can chart some new di-
 rections for corporate participation in sup-
 port of higher education in the next several
 years.
 First of all, it seems to me that the only
 possible direction for corporate support  is
 upward.  This is not simply because Federal
 spending is  expanding.   Rather, corporate
 support should go up because the need is
 greater and because the capacity of our econ-
 omy to meet that need is greater than it has
 ever been in our history.
 Second, corporate support must move up-
 ward in another sense.  It must be increased
 at the graduate and professional levels of
 education, both because this, too, is where
 needs are growing most urgently and be-
 cause this is the level from which corpora-
 tions are increasingly drawing their tech-
 nologists  and their managers.   Farsighted
 corporate policy dictates support  for this
 level of education because business is chang-
 ing too, and will need more and more tech-
 nologists and better trained managers in the
 future.
 Third, private contributions must expand
 in order to maintain the diversity of higher
 education in the United States.  For many
 years, we have thought of that diversity in
 terms of a balance between public and pri-
 vate  institutions.   But  now  we  need  to
 maintain both public and private interests
 in both public and private institutions. If
 the public institutions become solely depend-
 ent upon tax :funds, then we may be sure
 that their programs will be geared to fit the
 mission-oriented  funds  available through
 Government  agencies.   If private institu-

 DESIGNATION OF MRS. MINK TO
 READ WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL
 ADDRESS
 The SPEAKER.  Pursuant to the spe-

 designates   the gentlewoman  from
 Hawaii [Mrs. MIN.x] to read Washing-
 ton's Farewell Address immediately fol-
 lowing the approval of the Journal on
 THE PROBLEM OF FREE WORLD
 SHIPPING TO NORTH VIETNAM
 (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was
 given permission to address the House for
 1 minute.)
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker,
 1 week ago I spoke in this Chamber on
 the problem of free world shipping to
 North Vietnam and what I felt could
 and should be done about it.  Among
 other things I suggested that we estab-
 lish a blacklist of these ships which
 would prohibit them from carrying U.S.
 Government-financed cargoes.  Such a
 blacklist has existed for 3 years with
 respect to those trading with Cuba. I am
 gratified to be able to acknowledge that
 late last week I was informed by the
 State Department, in a response to my
 letter of February 4 urging the President
 to take such action, that such a blacklist
 has been approved. The details of this
 Presidential order are found in the Fed-
 eral Register of Saturday, February 12,
 1966, on page 2706.
 In my opinion, such action is overdue
 since our official policy too long has
 maintained a double standard of exempt-
 ing those who trade with Ho Chi Minh
 from the penalties imposed on those who
 trade with Castro. In no way should the
 Hanoi  regime  be  led  to  think  we
 consider trade with them in any sense
 less detrimental to our national interest
 than trade with Cuba.
 This action is a step in the right di-
 rection and I shall continue to press for
 the enactment of legislation prohibiting
 free world ships that aid Hanoi from
 doing any business whatsoever in U.S.
 ports-public or private-and to insure
 that no U.S. aid goes to any country that
 allow its ships to help supply North Viet-
 nam's war economy. We have tolerated
 too long.
 shipping to North Vietnam by any means
 necessary: Specifically, I did so on Jan-
 uary 12, January 19, January 28, and
 February 2.
 In the hearings of the Senate For-
 eign Relations Committee a week ago, it
 was said that the British could effect an
 embargo on Rhodesia with our over-
 eager help in 48 hours. Yet we have been
 unable to get their support in cutting off
 the supply of the Vietcongs by sea. After
 many months of effort, Britain is still the
 No. 1 violator among the free world na-
 tions.
 On December 21, I telegraphed the
 j          date, I have received nothing more

 House.
 Now, finally, the administration has
 stuck out its chest and announced that,
 as of January 25-25 days after my tele-
 gram-it was blacklisting any vessel
 shipping goods into, or out of, the North
 Vietnam part of Haiphong.
 Mr. Speaker, I applaud this action.
 However, it seems to raise this ques-
 tion. We have been fighting in Vietnam
 since mid-1962.  We have suffered 2,005
 dead and 9,658 wounded through Feb-
 ruary 7, 1966, and spent almost uncount-
 able billions.
 Why, Mr. Speaker, are we just start-
 ing to blacklist these ships?  Either it
 should have been done 3 years ago or
 this is a blind to avoid effective action,
 diplomatic or naval.
 It simply boils down to this. If black-
 listing is not effective, why bother with
 it at all.  If it is effective, why did we
 not do it in 1962 or 1963 instead of wait-
 ing until 1 week ago.
 Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the Ameri-
 can fighting men in Vietnam have a right
 to know the answer to this question. So
 do the American people.
 One further question: Is this all we
 are going to do about free world shipping
 to North Vietnam?
 THE QUESTIONS THAT PATRIOTS
 SHOULD ASK

 permission to address the House for 1
 minute, to revise and extend his re-
 marks, and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)

 (Mr. DICKINSON asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. DICKINSON.  Mr. Speaker, on
 various occasions, I have called upon this
 administration to bring an end to the
 shipment on their ships by our allies of
 goods for our enemies in North Vietnam.
 Secret decisions, managed news, "pat"
 answers, summary dismissal of inquiries,
 refusals to respond to proper questions
 do not supply the right answers, or for-
 tify the confidence of the U.S. fighting-
 man, or the public.
 Every patriot can support his country
 and yet ask pertinent questions at the
 same time.

 House calling for an end to free world                     triots in my district-with practical mili-
 tary experience and firsthand experi-
 ence in Chinese and southeast Asian af-
 fairs-Col. Allen Griffin, asks a number
 of questions, editorially, in the Monterey,
 Calif., Peninsula Herald newspaper.
 Each Member of Congress, as well as
 the President and his advisers, ought to
 ponder these questions.
 The full text of the editorial by Colonel
 Griffin follows:
 THE QUESTIONS THAT PATRIOTS SHOULD ASK
 The pursuit of the war in Vietnam has
 been a demonstration of a series of wrong
 "estimates of the situation."
 This is a term that is used by military peo-
 ple,  usually preliminary to  a decision  to
 move, to remain in place, go backwards, or
 what have you.  It is a term particularly of
 military intelligence. Nearly everything that
 is involved in the strength and weaknesses
 of the enemy is comprehended within the
 "estimate of the situation."
 And, of course, the enemy also Is making
 his estimate of the elements of strength and
 weakness in your situation, local, regional,
 global.
 President Charles de Gaulle gave the late
 President John F. Kennedy his estimate of
 the situation in Vietnam and suggested that
 the United States begin a process of seeking
 peace immediately.
 The late President was not convinced by
 General de Gaulle's estimate and decided,
 contrariwise, to become more involved.  That
 was the tragic beginning of escalation-the
 beginning of an infantry war of Americans
 against Asians on Asian land among Asian
 people, the last thing the U.S. Army ever
 wanted to be engaged in again after Korea.
 Up to this time this wasn't a war in which
 U.S. ground forces were engaged, but one In
 which U.S. materiel backed by a handful of
 advisers  was sent  to the assistance of a
 friendly government.  Now by degrees it be-
 came our war.                                                                                                                                         Escalation by manpower be-
 came a fact.
 When President Lyndon Johnson took the
 oath of office he inherited a war as well as a
 vast, scattered domestic program.
 Determined to do everything better and
 faster than his predecessor, he was psycho-
 logically prepared to provide the force nec-
 essary to push this war to an early conclu-
 sion.  After all, it was a war against the
 spread of communism, which was and is fur-
 ther justification.
 Surely his advisers gave him an estimate
 of the situation.  That called for escalation.
 It didn't work very well.  Then came a fur-
 ther estimate and a further escalation.  That
 also  fell  short. And  so on  until nearly
 200,000 American troops became hostages to
 this war, and North Vietnam came under
 continuous bombing attack except in the im-
 mediate vicinity of the capital city, Hanoi,
 and the most important seaport, Haiphong.
 Then again, surely operating under an esti-
 mate of the situation, the time was deemed
 ripe for a peace offensive.  That estimate
 could not have been on anything other than
 the possibility of bringing the war to a peace
 table.  Wrong again.  It didn't work.
 Now we have returned to bombing.  Where
 do we go from here?  How much of a land
 war  of Americans against  Asians  are we
 going to throw our Army into?  And where
 do we go from there?  These are legitimate
 questions for congressional  debate. And
 they are legitimate questions for the debate
 of patriotic citizens.

 To the Congress of the United States:
 This is the first annual report required
 of the National Capital Transportation
 A?ency by section 6 of the National Capi-
 tal Transportation Act of 1965-Public
 Law 89-17:3.
 Nineteen hundred and sixty-five was
 marked by significant advances toward
 solving the transportation problems of
 the Washington area.
 Congress approved plans for a rapid
 transit system, authorized its construc-
 tion, and authorized grants from the
 Federal and District Governments as a
 first stage. in financing its development.
 As soon as funds were made available,
 the Transportation Agency began the
 necessary work still. remaining before ac-
 tual construction can begin.
 't'here is, nonetheless, much left to do.
 't'he rapid transit system will achieve
 maximum usefulness only when it is ex-?
 tended into Maryland and Virginia sub-
 urbs.   The interstate compact among
 Maryland, Virginia, and the District of
 Columbia will be promptly presented to
 Congress for its consent, in order that
 the interstate authority may develop
 plans for a full regional system and a
 financial plan for its construction.  Ar?-
 ran;Tements must be perfected to trans-
 fer the responsibility for the system in an
 orderly and proper way from the Agency
 to the interstate authority.  These tasks
 are not easy, and it will require diligent.
 effort on the part of many people and
 agencies to master the problems that
 remain.
 The Congress can be assured, however,
 that all of these problems are being given
 the fullest and most diligent considera-
 tion, and that none of them will be al-
 lowed to stand in the way of an uninter-
 rupted schedule of construction.

 PRESIDENT                        OF   THE UNITED
 STATES (H. DOC. NO. 381)
 The SPEAKER laid before the House

 of the United States; which was read,
 and  together with  the  accompanying
 papers,  referred  to  the  Committee
 on Interior and Insular Affairs and or-
 dered to be printed:
 To the Congress of the United States:
 The period of expansion and explora-
 tion, the great era of successive western
 frontiers, has now become a part of our
 American past.  To the pioneer of his-
 tory the wilderness was a foe to be con-
 quered, so that he might make farms and
 pastures out of the endless forests.
 Today's pioneer has a new purpose-
 to preserve some remnants of that wil-
 derness from the onrush of modern civili-
 zation.
 The ax and the plow will not serve
 us in this struggle.  Today's instruments
 are more subtle.      They are progressive
 law and informed public opinion-de-
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE         February 1., 1966
 manding that we maintain our wilderness
 birthright.
 The Wilderness Act Is one in the long
 list of creative conservation measures
 that Congress has passed and I have
 signed into law.
 Legislation is one thing; administra-
 tion is another.  The executive branch
 must fulfill its responsibility with com-
 monsense and. imagination.  Our people
 must be given the opportunity to know,
 even for short periods of time the won-
 ders of God's creation  expressed in
 earth's wilderness areas.
 The maintenance of our existing wil-
 derness system is a priority program of
 the Federal. Government. We are con-
 stantly  reviewing primitive and road-
 less areas to determine who .her they
 should be recommended for preservation
 as part of our wilderness system.
 The Congress has wisely provided for
 public participation as revie,,,,s of the
 primitive and roadless areas proceed.  I
 am determined to assure that both the
 Department of Agriculture and the De-
 partment of the Interior wili provide
 full opportunity for the expression of
 public views before final recommenda-
 tions are prepared for transmittal to the
 Congress.
 I am pleased to send to Congress to-
 day the second annual repor'; of our
 progress in implementing the Wilder-
 ness Act.  We are well underway to-
 ward protecting God's gift of mystery
 and wonder that is the American wil-
 derness.

 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. DOLE.  Mr. Speaker, due to a
 speaking engagement at the 45th annual
 stockholders' meeting of the Central
 Livestock Association, Inc., at South St.
 Paul, Minn., on Wednesday, February 9,

 ISOLATION OF THE SMALL BUSI-
 NESS   ADMINISTRATION   FROM
 DOMINANCE BY BIG :BUSINESS
 (Mr. MOORE (at the request of Mr.
 TALCOTT) was given permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and  to  include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. MOORE.  Mr. Speaker, isolation
 of the Small Business Administration
 from dominance by big business has long
 been preached and praised by the Con-
 gress.  From the agency's beginning in
 1953, its independent status has been
 jealously guarded and constantly sup-
 ported.   Among  the  most  vociferous
 champions of such organizational inde-
 pendence when Members of the Senme
 were President Johnson and Vice Presi-
 dent  HUMPHREY. Without doubt tie
 status selected for it by the Congress has
 proven the most effective in order for
 it to best serve the small business com-
 munity.
 Such independent  status,  however,
 cannot alone guarantee the success of an
 agency or of its programs, nor can it
 countervail the absence of leadership,
 direction, and inspiration.
 Of late we have seen the business loan
 program,  the  key  program  of  SBA,
 through poor planning and poorer man-
 agement, virtually disappear.                                                                                                        We have
 seen another important SBA responsibil-
 ity, procurement assistance, dwindle to
 ineffectiveness.
 And now,, we hear rumors that what
 remains of the Johnson administration's
 operation of the Small Business Admin-
 istration is to be buried by its transfer
 to the Department of Commerce.  Ap-
 parently, this once fine and potentially
 great agency is to be swept under the
 gigantic rug of a major department.
 The proposed transfer of the Small
 Business   Administration represents
 White House recognition of its failure :
 this alone explains the present condi-
 tion of SBA and its programs.  Loss of
 its independent status will only make
 permanent the injury.  Without inde-
 pendent status, the agency cannot and
 will not provide the services small busi-
 nesses across the country so desperately
 need. The spokesman for small business
 in big government will be dead.
 Mr. Speaker, bipartisan support of in-
 dependent status for the Small Business
 Administration will prevent the piracy
 of a facility dedicated solely to the bet-
 terment  of the small business com-
 munity.
 To preclude this demotion, if not the
 disappearance of SBA, the Nation's 4.7
 million small businesses call upon us to
 reiterate our long held insistence upon
 independent status for the agency.  I
 urge unanimous approval of the follow-
 ing concurrent resolution, which today
 has been introduced by all the Republi-
 cans serving on the Small Business Com-
 mittee of the House of Representatives:
 H. CON. RES. 588
 Resolved by the House of Representatives
 (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense
 of the Congress that the Small Business Ad-
 ministration should continue to be an inde-
 pendent agency within the executive branch
 of the Federal Government, under the gen-
 eral direction and supervision of the Prest-

 progress in economic development is es-
 sential if internal Communist seizures are
 to be prevented. In 1947, the Greek Gov-
 ernment was engaged in a struggle for
 survival against Communist guerrilla
 forces.  President Truman pronounced
 the Truman doctrine-that Americans
 must support free people who were re-
 sisting attempted subjugation by armed
 minorities or by outside pressure.  He
 asked Congress to appropriate $4_00 mil-
 lion for economic assistance to Greece
 and Turkey.  By 1950, the Communist
 guerrillas in Greece had abandoned their
 struggle.  Similarly, in the Philippines,
 after World War II, the Communists
 built a force composed of dissatisfied
 peasants.   As it became obvious that
 military measures by themselves would
 not solve the problem, the Philippine
 Government carried out a broad program
 of social and economic progress in con-
 nection with renewed military offensives.
 Only in this manner was the Communist
 guerrilla movement in the Philippines
 actually destroyed.
 The revised aid program not only pro-
 tects our vital national interests but it
 does so in an economically sound fash-
 ion.           We can look forward to the day
 when the aid program will no longer be
 necessary.
 Economic aid to Western Europe was
 terminated for most of the nations by
 1960. Progress in Greece and Israel per-
 mitted the United States to terminate
 grants  in  1962.   Self-support  was
 achieved in Lebanon in 1963. Iran is in
 a transition to self-support.  Turkey
 plans to eliminate reliance on foreign aid
 by 1973. India and Turkey now finance
 over three-fourths of their development
 programs from their own resources, and
 Pakistan over 60 percent. All told, about
 14 nations are approaching the time
 when they will not need any further low-
 interest loan or grant assistance from
 the United States.
 In the past 15 years, the burden of
 foreign assistance on the U.S. taxpayer
 has declined sharply.  As a share of
 gross national product, economic aid has
 fallen from 2 percent to 1949 to less than
 two-fifths of 1 percent this year. As a
 share of the Federal budget, economic
 aid has declined from 11.5 percent to 2
 percent over the same period. Most de-
 veloped countries are contributing about
 the same percentage of their gross na-
 tional product as the United States, some
 even more.
 Foreign aid spending has little effect
 upon our balance-of-payments position.
 Eighty percent of the funds will be used
 to purchase goods and services in the
 United States.  In fact, a sizable share
 of some American exports are now fi-
 nanced by foreign aid programs.  In
 1962, 33 percent of our locomotive and
 fertilizer exports and 25 percent of U.S.
 exports of iron and steel products were
 purchased under the foreign aid pro-
 gram.
 Foreign aid also helps to boost foreign
 trade indirectly.  AID workers abroad
 introduce American products and tech-
 niques in places where they may never
 have been seen.    Trade connections are
 established and a market for reorders is
 created.
 The aid program has also facilitated
 private investment abroad.  Since No-
 !ember 1961, AID has authorized 17
 loans totaling $146 million directly to
 private firms to establish new plants and
 extend existing facilities in the Near
 east and south Asia countries alone.
 Technical assistance also helps to fos-
 ter private enterprise.  The investment
 guarantee program provides a strong
 stimulus to U.S. firms investing abroad.
 The State of Wyoming has a right to
 be proud of the significant role it has
 played in assisting less fortunate people
 through the foreign-aid program.  The
 University of Wyoming has a contract
 with AID for a 3-year technical assist-
 ance program in Somalia. - A team of
 Wyomingites in Somalia is working to
 improve present agricultural crops and
 survey other crops that may prove feas-
 ible.                                                   The University of Wyoming and
 Columbia University are assisting the
 faculties of engineering, agriculture, and
 education of Kabul University, Afghan-
 istan, as well as assisting the Afghan
 Institute of Technology and the Second-
 ary schools.
 As the self-sacrificing Wyoming citi-
 zens working on these projects are
 aware, the path to economic develop-
 ment is not an easy one.  Yet, the pro-
 posed aid program, with its justification
 embodied in the defense of our vital
 national interests, its basis on a sound
 economic foundation, and its mechan-
 isms encouraging self-help on the part
 of recipients, is a remarkable bargain for
 the American people.  There will be
 spectacular successes and ignominious
 failures in the years ahead.  But, as
 Economist Robert Heilbroner states, we
 must proceed with our foreign economic
 aid:
 Once the great march has begun, it is no
 longer possible to turn back.  The changes
 in the balance of the old static society cannot
 be undone.  There is no choice but to tread
 the road to its conclusion-however long and
 agonizing the journey may be.

 WAR AND HOPE
 (Mr. RANDALL (at the request of Mr.
 GIBBONS)    asked and was given per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include extra-
 neous matter.)
 Mr. RANDALL.  Mr. Speaker, I feel
 that only good can come from the-
 meet-ing of heads of state and the restate-
 ment of aims and policies in the Vietnam
 war.
 As is well known, the Allies agreed on
 "a growing military effectiveness," and at
 the same time on an "unending quest for
 peace."
 The candid, face-to-face exchange be-
 tween the heads of state in Hawaii
 "should be enormously useful in the joint
 effort to rid Vietnam of its invaders and
 establish the country as a going nation,"
 the Washington Daily News has com-
 mented, and it adds that "more meet-
 ings, as suggested by the communique,
 could only enhance the effectiveness of
 the effort."
 The newspaper feels that the resolu-
 tion evidenced at Honolulu is good cause
 for encouragement.
 Here is a concise and well-presented
 rresume of the events-and of the en-
 couragement we can take from them-
 and I should like to suggest that the edi-
 torial be printed in the RECORD, where
 many may want to read it.
 [From the Washington (D.C.)  Daily News,
 Feb. 9, 1966]
 .WAR AND HOPE IN VIETNAM
 Even  if                              Ho Chi  Minh  has started,  or
 eventually does begin, some type of "peace
 offensive" of his own, this would be no cause
 for an abrupt change in the plans President
 Johnson and Vietnamese leaders worked out
 at Honolulu.
 Communists don't normally cave in sud-
 denly.  (It took 2 years of talks to arrange
 the settlement in Korea.)
 The United States is engaged in Vietnam
 to achieve two objectives: to free the Viet-
 namese people of the communism invasion
 and to help them build a country of inde-
 pendence and stability, something they never
 before have had a chance to accomplish.
 Anything which stands in the way of these
 goals (particularly the Communist terrorists
 and armies now being fought in South Viet-
 nam) must be overcome.  Anything, includ-
 ing a possible change of mind in Hanoi,
 which may help reach these goals is to be
 diligently encouraged.
 But the success of the effort to restore
 freedom in Vietnam and to give the country
 a real chance in life depends almost alto-
 gether on the Vietnamese themselves and
 heavy American assistance.
 The Vietnamese not only have to fight but
 they must take care of refugees from the
 battle areas, organize local government, and
 stabilize the economy.
 The understandings reached in Honolulu
 between President Johnson and the Viet-
 namese  leaders  (Premier Ky and  others)
 are designed to meet these needs.
 The two allies agreed on "a growing mili-
 tary effectiveness" and at the same time on
 an "unending quest for peace."
 Mr. Johnson said, for our part, we would
 "move steadfastly ahead" on the military
 front and at the same time "move vigor-
 ously" to assist the Vietnamese with their
 economic, social, and political problems.
 All of this appeared to support Premier
 Ky's position that the allies must operate
 from strength, and evidence of willingness
 ,to use their strength, if there is to be "any
 kind of just and lasting settlement" with the
 Communists.  There is no other way, as his-
 tory has shown, to deal with Communists.
 The payoff for the Honolulu conference
 does not lie in the stilted communique, but
 in the results over the long haul.
 Nevertheless, a restatement of aims and
 policies for this war-this time jointly by
 the top leaders of the two countries, is an-
 other step in smoothing out world opinion
 of the justice and necessity of the U.S. pres-
 ence in Vietnam.
 And, as a practical matter, the candid,
 face-to-face exchange between the heads of
 state-who never before had met-should
 be enormously useful in the joint effort to
 rid Vietnam of its invaders and establish
 the country as a going nation.  More meet-
 ings, as suggested by the communique, could
 only enhance the effectiveness of the effort.
 No one knows how long it will take to force
 a decision from Hanoi-either by military
 force, diplomatic means, or both-but the
 resolution  evidenced at Honolulu is good
 cause for encouragement.

 Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act of
 1966
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. RODNEY M. LOVE
 OF OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, for some
 time during the 1st session of the 89th
 Congress, I had been prodding some of
 my friends on the Veterans' Affairs Com-
 mittee to report out H.R. 12410, the Vet-
 erans' Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966,
 so I was extremely pleased to see it on
 the calendar early in this session.
 Many of my constituents have written
 expressing  their  concern  about  this
 measure, particularly with respect to our
 boys fighting in Vietnam.
 This is an excellent bill, Mr. Speaker,
 as it designs a permanent program for
 our veterans. As the committee pointed
 out, the structure of veterans' laws which
 have developed over the past 200 years
 has been based on the concept of war-
 time and peacetime service. In the past,
 war veterans have been given substan-
 tially more benefits than peacetime vet-
 erans and this system worked very well
 through World War II.  However, after
 World War II, when we entered the so-
 called cold war, problems began to arise.
 It has been during this period that we
 have  continued  compulsory  military
 service for an extended period of time for
 the first time in our history. Prior to
 World War II, we had few servicemen
 stationed outside the United States. To-
 day, however, our servicemen are scat-
 tered throughout the world, and in many
 instances are serving under combat or
 near combat conditions. During the pe-
 riod of time which is covered by this bill,
 our Nation has gone through a series of
 crises associated with Cuba, the Domin-
 ican Republic, Taiwan-Matsu, Lebanon,
 Berlin, Laos, and Vietnam.  The per-
 petual cold war condition, with its crises,
 compulsory military service, and ex-
 panded overseas commitments, makes
 this bill necessary if our servicemen, dur-
 ing this period of our history, are to re-
 ceive equitable treatment.
 As you know, Mr. Speaker, the purpose
 of this bill is to: first, enhance and make
 more attractive service in the Armed
 Forces of the United States; second, ex-
 tend the benefits of a higher education to
 qualified and deserving young persons
 who might not otherwise be able to af-
 ford such an education; third, provide
 vocational readjustment and restore lost
 educational opportunities to those serv-
 icemen and women whose careers have
 been interrupted or impeded by reason
 of active duty after January 31, 1955;
 and fourth, aid such persons in attain-
 ing the vocational and educational status
 which they might normally have aspired
 to and obtained had they not served their
 country.
 The committee emphasizes that, as in
 the case of the Veterans' Readjustment
 Assistance Act of 1952, it is not the in-
 tention of this legislation to establish a
 program which completely subsidizes the
 cost of a veteran's education program, as
 well as his living costs. This legislation
 is designed as an aid program and it is
 expected that in many cases the veteran
 will be required to make a contribution
 to the cost of his own education program.
 It is believed that the veteran will main-
 tain a greater interest in the use made
 of the funds provided by this bill, if he
 is required to make a contribution from
 his own resources.
 Moreover, the purpose of the commit-
 tee is not to equalize educational oppor-
 tunities for the veteran population, but
 rather to provide assistance to help a
 veteran follow the educational plan that
 he might have adopted had he never en-
 tered the Armed Forces.
 Mr. Speaker, I believe this legislation
 further insures that the Nation shall be
 able to utilize the highest skills and abili-
 ties of the veterans who benefit from it.
 This is especially important since at this
 time the number of young men available
 to fill the essential technical and profes-
 sional posts is the lowest in ratio to our
 total population which we have had or
 probably ever will have for a decade to
 come. In my opinion, it is doubly essen-
 tial that we make fullest use of the skills
 of the young men who are available.

 by saying that among the purposes of the
 organization is:
 "To maintain international peace and se-
 curity, and to that end: To take effective
 collective measures for the prevention and
 removal of threats to the peace, and for the
 suppression of acts of aggression or other
 breaches of the peace, and to bring about by
 peaceful means, and in conformity with the
 principles of justice and international law,
 adjustment or settlement of international
 disputes or situations which might lead to a
 breach of the peace."
 To argue that action is not possible be-
 cause  China  and North Vietnam are  not
 members is to ignore article 2(6)  of the
 charter, which says:
 "The organization shall insure that states
 which are not members of the United Na-
 tions act in accordance with these prin-
 ciples so far as may be necessary for the
 maintenance of international peace and secu-
 rity."
 Peace is primarily the responsibility of the
 Security Council.  Chapter V, article 24(l)
 says:
 In order to insure prompt and effective
 action by the United Nations, its members
 confer on the Security Council primary re-
 sponsibility for the maintenance of inter-
 national peace and security, and agree that
 in carrying out this responsibility the Secu-
 rity Council acts on their behalf."
 Chapter VI clearly states the methods the
 Security Council is to use in settling dis-
 putes.  Chapter VII even provides that the
 my unconditional support.                              Council may use land, sea, or air forces to
 I aintain international peace and security.
 Milwaukee Journal Cites United Nations
 Responsibility in Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. HENRY S. REUSS
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, January 18, 1966
 Mr. REUSS.                               Mr. Speaker, while we
 all know that the road ahead may be
 long and arduous, the submission of the
 Vietnam issue to the-United Nations is
 a hopeful step forward.
 The charter of the U.N. makes clear
 that the Security Council is the forum
 where threats to world peace are ini-
 tially discussed.
 The resolution offered to the Security
 Council would open the way toward a
 durable peace in southeast Asia based
 upon the 1954 Geneva Conference.
 The Milwaukee Journal's recent edi-
 torial, "It Is U.N. Duty To Seek Peace,"
 follows:
 [From the Milwaukee (Wis.)  Journal, Feb.
 3, 1966]
 IT  Is  U.N.          DUTY  To  SEEK  PEACE
 The U.S. resolution seeking a full-scale de-
 bate on Vietnam has reached the United Na-
 tions Security Council agenda and a long
 debate probably       is  in  store.  The Soviet
 Union will undoubtedly offer a counterreso-
 lution demanding that the United States
 pull out of South Vietnam completely.  In
 the end a compromise may be reached as a
 first step toward peace negotiations.  Or it
 may reach a point where the Soviet Union
 vetoes the whole effort.
 Original French and Soviet opposition to
 any consideration of peace moves in the Se-
 curity Council ignored the clear responsibil-
 ity  U.N.  members  have  to  seek  peace.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. THOMAS M. REES
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, January 26, 1966
 Mr. REPS. Mr. Speaker, last week the
 eminent diplomat and scholar, George
 F. Kennan, testified before the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee concern-
 ing our involvement in Vietnam.
 Mr. Keenan, after many years in the
 State Department as an Ambassador to
 the Soviet Union and later Yugoslavia,
 is considered by many to be our top ex-
 pert in the cold war.
 His remarks, I believe, present a very
 clear and rational picture concerning
 American involvement in Vietnam:
 KENNAN  STATEMENT  ON  VIETNAM
 (NOTE.-George                                                              F. Kennan, former  Am-
 bassador to Moscow and now a member of
 the Institute for Advanced Study at Prince-
 ton,                                                                                                                                                               N.J.,  testified  on  Vietnam yesterday

 Kennan's prepared statement, as delivered.)
 Mr.                        Chairman,  and  distinguished mem-
 bers of the Foreign Relations Committee, the
 subject on which I am invited to give my
 views this morning is, as I understand it,
 the complex of problems connected with our
 present involvement in Vietnam.
 I would like to explain, in undertaking
 to speak to this subject, that southeast Asia
 is a part of the world for which I can claim
 no specialized knowledge.  I am not familiar
 wtih the official rationale of our policy there
 except as it has been revealed in the press.
 I cannot recall that I have ever, either dur-
 ing my  official service                                                                                                                                      in  Government  or

 branch of our Government into consultation
 on the problem of our policy in southeast
 Asia, or even been made privy to the of-
 ficial discussions by which that policy was
 decided.
 I am sure that there are many data that
 are  relevant  to  any  thoroughly  founded
 judgment on. these matters which are not
 available to me, and this being the case,
 I have tried in recent weeks and months
 not to jump to final conclusions even in
 my own thoughts, to remain sympathetically
 receptive,  both  to  our  Government's  ex-
 planations of the very real difficulties it has
 raced and tc the doubts and questions of
 its serious critics.
 eCOCRIENCE NOTED
 I  have     not been  anxious  to  press my
 views on the public, but I gladly give them
 to you for whatever they are worth, claiming
 no particular merit for them except perhaps
 that they flow from experience with Com-
 munist affairs that runs back now for some
 :18 years, and also from the deepest and most
 troubled sort; of concern that we should find
 the proper course, the right course, at this
 truly crucial moment.
 The first point I would like to make is
 that if we were not already involved as we
 are
 today in Vietnam, I would know of no
 reason why  we should wish to become so
 involved, and I could think of several rea-
 sons why we should wish not to.
 Vietnam is not a region of major military,
 industrial importance.  It is difficult to be-
 lieve that any decisive developments of the
 world  situation  would  be  determined  in
 normal circumstances by what happens on
 that territory
 If it were not for the considerations of
 prestige that arise precisely out of our pres-
 ent involvement, even a situation in which
 South Vietnam was controlled  exclusively
 by the Vietcong, while regrettable, and no
 doubt morally unwarranted, would not, in
 my opinion, present dangers great enough to
 justify our direct military intervention.
 Given the situation that exists today in
 the relations among the. leading Communist
 powers, and by that I have, of course, in mind
 primarily the Soviet-Chinese conflict, there
 is every likelihood that a Communist regime
 in. South Vietnam would follow a fairly in-
 dependent coeuue.
 There is no reason to suspect that such a
 regime would find It either necessary or de-
 sirable in present circumstances to function
 simply as a passive puppet and instrument
 of Chinese power.  And as for the danger
 that its establishment there would unleash
 similar tendencies in neighboring countries,
 this. I think, would depend largely on the
 manner In which it came into power.
 In the light of what has recently hap-
 pened in Indonesia, and on the Indian sub-
 continent, the danger of the so-called domi-
 no effect-that is, the effect that would be
 produced by a limited Communist success
 in South Vietnam-seems to me to be con-
 siderably less than it was when the main
 decisions were taken that have led to our
 present involvement.
 Let me stress, I do not say that that dan-
 ger does not exist: I say that it is less than
 it was a year or two ago when we got into
 this involvement.
 Prom the long-term standpoint, therefore,
 and on principle, I think our military in-
 volvement in Vietnam has to be recognized
 as unfortunate, as something we would not
 choose deliberately, if the choice were ours
 to make all over again today, and by the
 scene token, I think it should be our Gov-
 ernment's  airn  to  liquidate  this  involve-
 ment just as soon as this can be done with-
 out inordinate damage to our own prestige
 or to the stability of conditions in that area.
 It is obvious on the other hand that this
 involvement Is today a fact.  It creates a
 new situation   It raises new questions ul-
 terior to the long-term problem which have
 to be taken into account; a precipitate and
 disorderly  withdrawal  could  represent  in
 present circumstances a disservice to our
 own interests, and even to world peace grea-
 ter than any that might have been involved
 by our failure to engage ourselves there in
 the first place.
 This is a reality which, if there Is to be
 any peaceful resolution of this conflict, is
 going to have to be recognized bot.;i by the
 more critical  of  our  friends  and  by  our
 adversaries.
 But at the same time, I have great mis-
 givings about any deliberate expansion of
 hostilities on our part directed to the achieve-
 ment, of something called victory-if by the
 use of that term we envisage the  .omplete
 disappearance  of  the  recalcitrance with
 which we are now faced, the formal sub-
 mission by the adversary to our will and the
 complete realization of our present stated
 political aims.
 I doubt that these things can be achieved
 even by the most formidable mili: ary suc-
 cesses.
 There seems to be an impression about
 that if we bring sufficient military pressure
 to bear there will occur at some point some-
 thing In the nature of a political  apitula-
 tion on the other side.  I think  his is a
 most  dangerous  assumption.  I don't  say
 that it is absolutely impossible, but it is a
 dangerous assumption in the light of the
 experience we have had with Communist
 elements in the past.
 The North Vietnamese and the Vietcong
 have between them a great deal of space and
 manpower to give up if they have to, and the
 Chinese can give them more if they need it.
 Fidelity to the Communist tradition would
 dictate that if really pressed to extremity on
 the military level these people should dis-
 appear entirely from  the open scene and
 fall  back  exclusively on  an  underground
 political and military existence rather than
 to  accept  terms  that  would  be  openly
 humiliating and would, represent  in their
 eyes the betrayal of the :future political pros-
 pects of the cause to which they a.re dedi-
 cated.
 Any total rooting out of the Vietcong from
 the territory of South Vietnam  could be
 achieved, if it could be achieved at Al, only
 at the cost of a degree of damage to civilian
 life and of civilian suffering generally for
 which I would not like to see this country
 responsible.
 And to attempt to crush North Vietnamese
 strength to a point where Hanoi could no
 longer give any support for Vietcong political
 i activity in the south would almost certainly,
 t seems to me, have the effect of bringing in
 Chinese  forces  at  some  point,  whether
 formally or in the guise of volunteers, thus
 involving us in a military conflict wish Com-
 munist China on. one of the most unf.Ivorable
 theaters of hostility that we could possibly
 choose.
 This is not the only reason why I think we
 should do everything possible to avoid the
 escalation of this conflict.  There is another
 one which is no less weighty, and this is the
 effect the conflict is already having on our
 policies and interests further  afield.  This
 involvement  seems  to  me    to represent  a
 grevious misplacement of emphasis on our
 foreign policies as a whole.
 Not only are great and potentially more
 important questions of world affairs not re-
 ceiving, as a consequence of our involvement
 in Vietnam, the attention they should be
 receiving, but in some instances assets we
 already  enjoy  and,  hopefully, possibilities
 we should be developing are being sacrificed
 to this unpromising involvement in a remote
 and secondary theater.
 Our relations with the Soviet Union have
 suffered grievously, as was to be expected,
 and this at a time when far more Important
 things were involved in those relations than
 what Is ultimately involved in Vietnam and
 when we had special reason,  I think,  to
 cultivate those relations, and more unfortu-
 nate still, in my opinion, is the damage being
 done to the feelings entertained for us by
 the Japanese people.
 The confidence and the good disposition
 of the Japanese is the greatest asset we have
 had and the greatest asset we could have in
 east Asia.  As the greatest industrial complex
 in the entire Far East, and the only place
 where the sinews of modern war  can  be
 produced on a formidable scale there, Japan
 is of vital importance to us and indeed to
 the prospects generally of peace and stability
 in east Asia.
 There is no success we could have in Viet-
 nam that would conceivably warrant, in my
 opinion, the sacrifice by us of the confidence
 and good will of the Japanese people.
 Yet, I fear that we abuse that confidence
 and good will in the most serious way when
 we press the military struggle in Vietnam,
 and particularly when we press it by means
 of strategic bombing, a process to which the
 Japanese for historical reasons are peculiarly
 sensitive and adverse.
 I mention Japan particularly because it is
 an outstanding example, both in importance
 and in the intensity of the feelings aroused,
 of the psychological damage that is being
 done in many parts of the world by the
 prosecution of this conflict, and that will be
 done in even greater measure if the hostili-
 ties become still more bloody and tragic as a
 result of our deliberate effort.
 It is clear that however justified our action
 may be in our own eyes, it has failed to win
 either enthusiasm or confidence even. among
 peoples normally friendly to us.
 Our motives are widely misinterpreted, and
 the spectacle, the spectacle emphasized and
 reproduced  in  thousands  of  press  photo-
 graphs and stories that appear in the press of
 the world, the spectacle of Americans inflict-
 ing grievous injury on the lives of a poor and
 helpless people, and particularly a people of
 different race and color, no matter how war-
 ranted by military necessity or by the ex-
 cesses of the adversary our operations may
 seem to us to be or may genuinely be, this
 spectacle produces reactions among inillio:ns
 of people throughout the world profoundly
 detrimental to the image we would like them
 to hold of this country.
 HOLLOW VICTORY
 I am not saying that this is just or right.
 I am. saying that this is so, and that it is
 bound in the circumstances to be so, and a
 victory purchased at the price of further such
 damage would be a hollow one in terms of our
 world interests, no matter what advantages
 it might hold from the standpoint of devel-
 opments on the local scene.
 Now, these are the reasons, gentlemen, why
 I hope that our Government will restrict our
 military operations in Vietnam to the mini-
 mum necessary to assure the security of our
 forces, and to maintain our military presence
 there  until we can  achieve a satisfactory
 peaceful resolution of the conflict, and these
 are reasons why I hope that we will continue
 to pursue vigorously, and I may say consist-
 ently, the quest for such a peaceful resolution
 of the conflict, even if this involves some
 moderation of our stated objectives, and even
 if the resulting settlement appears to us as
 something less than Ideal.
 I cannot,  of course, judge  the military
 necessities of our situation.  But everything
 that I can learn about its political aspects
 suggests to me that Gen. James M. Gavin is
 on the right track in his suggestions that we
 should, if I understood him correctly, decide
 what limited areas we can safely police and
 defend, and restrict ourselves largely to the
 maintenance of our position there.
 I have listened with Interest to the argu-
 ments that have been brought forward In
 opposition to his views, and I must say that

 ton was a farmer and recognizing this, a
 group of America's finest young men
 have selected the week of his birthdate
 as their national week.  I am speaking
 of the Future Farmers of America who
 will observe their 38th anniversary the
 week of February 19 to February 26.
 I am sincere when I speak of the
 Future Farmers of America as a group
 of this Nation's finest young men.  At
 home, in the Second District of Ken-
 tucky, one cannot but be aware of the
 very strong and the very positive in-
 fluence that the members of this organi-
 zation exert in their homes and in their
 communities. I know of no group that
 commands more respect or receives more
 wholehearted support than our Future
 Farmers and I am sure this is true not
 only in our section of Kentucky, but
 across the board expanse of our country.
 Thirty-eight  years  ago,  some  high
 school students in Kansas City, Mo., be-
 lieved in the future of farming.                   They
 formed a new organization-an organi-
 zation for farm boys-and employed this
 belief in their creed. Their faith has
 been justified, for it was then as it is
 now-farming is the backbone and the
 heart of agriculture.
 It was in 1928 that these boys first met
 and set forth their ideals and goals. The
 outgrowth of their meeting has been a
 national organization, the Future Farm-
 ers of America, with more than 454,516
 active members in 9,156 local chapters.
 This membership is distributed through-
 out our 50 States and Puerto Rico. Op-
 erating under the provisions of the
 National Vocational Education Acts, it
 has become an educational, nonprofit,
 and nonpolitical farm youth movement
 and has as its aim and purpose the de-
 velopment of agricultural leadership, of
 citizenship, and of patriotism.
 As our great Nation has expanded its
 growth and power, as our population has
 increased, and America, in its compassion
 for the hungry of the world has in-
 creased its foreign commitments, so too
 have the Future Farmers of America
 augmented their program to meet these
 new demands upon our agricultural re-
 sources.  Vocational  Agriculture  now
 embraces the study of science, tech-
 nology, and management. The American
 farm and American farmworkers re-
 main the center link in our present agri-
 cultural system.  Servicing and supply-
 ing these 7 million people are some 6
 million workers. In the third and final
 link, an additional 10 million handle and
 process our abundant farm produce.
 Agriculture, in a sense, has become agri-
 business.
 To those who love the land, however,
 agriculture is more than a career-
 more than a business. It is a very rich
 and rewarding way of life.  The dreams
 of forefathers are nurtured and har-
 vested and the good earth is replenished
 with hope for the farmers of tomorrow
 to tend.  A farm is a masterpiece of
 nature and a symbol of the eternal bond
 between man and soil.
 I salute the Future Farmers of Amer-
 ica upon their 38th anniversary. A great
 trust is their and I wish for them a
 future of even greater achievement.
 Vietnam: The Endless War-Article IV
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. RYAN.  Mr. Speaker, Pete Hamill,
 who is reporting on the war in Vietnam
 for the New York Post, has been writing
 a series of articles from that region
 which shows great insight into the nature
 of the struggle. I include the fourth ar-
 ticle in the series which was published on
 February 10.  I especially want to call
 to the attention of my colleagues his two
 concluding sentences:
 If anything at all is clear about this con-
 fused war, it is that its roots are political.
 Ultimately, its solution will be political too.
 The article follows:
 VIETNAM:  THE  ENDLESS  WAR-ARTICLE  IV:
 THE MILITARY STRUGGLE
 (By Pete Hamill)
 SAIGON.---The  correspondents  who  were
 there still remember the last terrible days
 of the French in what was then known as
 Indochina.    Every evening in that spring
 of  1964,  the bars  of  Hanoi would grow
 emptier.   The young French officers would
 toast each other with champagne, sing gay,
 brave songs, and then fly off in the morning,
 heading 180 miles to the west for a town
 in the valley of the Namyoum River called
 Dien Bien Phu.
 The young men would leave in groups of
 50 or 60 in those first days of the 57-day
 siege; then in groups of 30 or less; and at
 the end, one or two at a time.  The music
 in the Hanoi bars played to empty rooms.
 The prostitutes walked home alone.   The
 customers of both were off being slaughtered.
 And while those thousands of young men
 were again proving that France produces the
 bravest soldiers and the worst generals of
 any modern nation, while they were being
 shot down like trapped animals in that valley
 without exits, the French military kept ly-
 ing.  The war was not finished, they told
 visiting  correspondents,  no  matter  what
 happened at Dien Bien Phu.     Small military
 gains were being made in the Red River
 Valley.   The Vietminh were getting discour-
 aged.  The pacification program was spread-
 ing like oil on water through the countryside.
 The Vietminh were resorting to terror in
 the collection of troops and the peasantry
 was abandoning the cause.  It was all re-
 lated in careful, rational tones, and all of it
 was nonsense.
 On May 7, 1954, Dien Bien Phu was overrun,
 by the forces of Vietminh Gen. Vo Nguyen
 Giap; the next day, the Geneva Conyention
 opened and the colonial empire France had
 fought so bravely and stupidly to retain
 was finished.  Today, the second part of that
 war continues, though the names of most of
 the players have changed.  In what Bernard
 Fall describes as the second Indochina war,
 the old hands have a distinct sense of deja
 vu.
 "There are some crucial differences between
 the French phase of the war and the Ameri-
 can phase," one veteran American journalist
 told me several weeks ago.  "For one thing,
 the French were fighting to stay in a colony;
 we're fighting to get out.  We have over-
 whelming air power and, with the helicopters,
 more flexibility.  Despite the peace move-
 ment, we don't have anything like that anti-
 war feeling in France at the time of the war,
 which choked off supplies and needed man-
 power;  the French                                                                                  after all had a large,
 14, 1966
 powerful Communist Party. But in other
 ways, it seems to me we're making a hell of
 a lot of the same mistakes."
 Even some of the American politicians ad-
 mit that host of our mistakes to date have
 been political;  but they also feel that we
 are in danger of making some of the same
 military mistakes.
 "Our greatest weakness here is the ARVN,"
 one American military man told me.   (The
 initials are for Army of the Republic of Viet-
 nam.)   "If they were doing their job, we
 wouldn't be here.  We could stand off like
 the Chinese are doing, give them the guns
 and let them do the fighting.   But even
 though they are individually brave, they are
 lousy as an army."
 There are about 250,000 troops in the South
 Vietnamese Army and some units perform
 well.  Others are a hopeless grabbag.  One
 unit I visited in the Mekong Delta was made
 up of 250 fighting men and 750 women and
 children, all dependents of the soldiers. It
 is rather difficult to get a soldier to desert
 the warmth of his family bed at 3 in the
 morning to do battle with the Vietcong. De-
 sertions continue to bleed the army of its
 stability.  The pay is abysmally low-$20 a
 month for a private, or about what a prosti-
 tute earns in an hour on Saigon's Tu Do
 Street.
 Few ARVN soldiers have any respect at
 all for the commanders, most of whom seem
 more interested in turning their weapons on
 the latest Saigon government than in fight-
 ing the Vietcong.  In addition, the Vietna-
 mese Army is riddled with Vietcong agents,
 to the point that some American outfits re-
 fuse to work on operations with them.  "It's
 impossible to plan a large operation with
 them," one Marine colonel said.   "By the
 time we get to where we want to go, the
 Vietcong are gone.  It's like a cop from the
 vice squad working for Lucky Luciano."
 An even more serious problem is that most
 of the Vietnamese officers have been trained
 by  either  the   French  or  the  Americans.
 Their military thinking runs along conven-
 tional lines.  The Australians-some of whom
 are most caustic about American military
 strategy-say that the Vietnamese would be
 great soldiers in some open flat field in the
 south of France, but that they still don't
 understand jungle warfare.
 "In this kind of war," one Australian officer
 who had served in New Guinea said, "you
 have to slide up on your man and cut his
 throat.  You don't come barging in like a
 horde of bloody elephants, letting him know
 you're coming."
 (The Australians, by the way, rate the
 Americans third in the jungle warfare league.
 "The Japanese were best, because they used
 the jungle; the Australians were second, be-
 cause they learned to live with the jungle;
 Americans-they remove the jungle.")
 The French thought they could hold Indo-
 china with strings of forts from which they
 could strike with some sort of mobility; but
 the Viet Minh controlled all of the country-
 side, had the support of most of the peas-
 antry, and knocked off each fort with brutal
 efficiency until at Dienbienphu, they knocked
 off the biggest fort of them all.
 Many observers feel we are doing the same
 thing.  Our position at Da Nang, Anh Khe,
 Bien Hoa, Pleiku, and Nha Trang are reason-
 ably well defended  (though the  Vietcong
 slipped through two regiments of Vietnamese
 to mortar Bien Hoa a year ago, and managed
 to blast the Da Nang airstrip a few weeks
 ago).  The Americans, because of the kind of
 warfare they are waging, must have these
 bases. Unfortunately, they control no more
 of  the countryside  than  the French  did.
 When I asked to visit the battlefield of the
 la Drang Valley where, last November, we
 took heavy losses, and killed almost 2,000
 Vietcong, I was laughed at.  "Unj,ess you can
 find a spare battalion around here," I was
 told, "forget it."

 U.S. Space Program Chalked After 1970
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 2, 1966
 Mr. TEAGUE of Texas.  Mr. Speaker,
 an article by Neal Stanford in the Chris-
 tian Science Monitor, January 18, dis-
 cusses the recent report of the Space
 Science Board of the National Academy
 of Sciences completed at the request of
 the White Mouse on post-Apollo pro-
 rams.  This study clearly outlines the
 need not only for our efforts in space
 in the 1970's but makes a strong case for
 sufficient Earth-based effort to supple-
 ment our space effort.  This brief arti-
 cle by Mr. Stanford identifies well sev-
 eral of the most promising opportunities
 for our national space program following
 the lunar landing in this decade.     The
 article :follows :
 U.S.  SPACE  PROGRAM  CHALKED  AFTER  1970
 (by Neal Stanford)
 WASHINGTON.-The       American space  pro-
 grrain Is outlined until 1970, when it is to put
 men on the moon.
 While there is it lot of talk and speculation
 about what the United States does after that
 in space, there is no official program, no an-
 nounced goal.
 The first step toward nailing down a spe-
 cific space program for the post-Apollo years,
 running from 1970 to 1985, has been taken
 flow.
 The Space Science Board of the National
 Academy of Sciences, at the request of the
 White House, has come up with a long list
 of projects and given them priorities.
 `Cop priority goes to unmanned exploration
 of Mars.
 Next comes detailed investigation of the
 lunar surface.
 Third is unmanned exploration of Venus.
 EARTH-BASED STUDY STRESSED
 Then comes investigation of other major
 planets, comets, asteroids, and interplane-
 tary dust.
 This              program is not too different  from
 what  has         been  expected,  and  from    what
 probably will he approved.  But what the
 space science board has done now is propose
 50 different specific space investigations for
 the post-Apollo years, and explain why these
 have been chosen.
 The report takes issue with certain present
 policies and premises on space research and
 exploration.
 It suggests that earth-based studies of the
 planets and solar system must not be ne-
 glected just because man now has a means
 of making deep-space probes.  It says with
 some sharpness: "There is great concern over
 the gap between present programs in ground-
 based observation of the planetary system
 and  what  could  be  done  with  existing
 facilities."
 In other words: Don't do in space what
 can be done more cheaply on earth.
 QUESTIONS OUTLINED
 Here are some of its proposals and recom-
 mendations for this period:
 Launching an. orbiting planetary observa-
 tory,
 More   observation   of  planets  through
 ground-based telescopes.
 Landing a Martian capsule early in the
 1970's.
 Putting life-detection experiments in early
 landers on planets, even though they have
 it low chance of success.
 The report makes pertinent points about
 various space programs:
 Mars;: The purpose is not only to look for
 existence of life on Mars, but to see if it
 geographically has a core, a mantle, a crust;
 not just study volcanic activity, but deter-
 mine whether Mars  came from the  same
 chemical crucible as the Earth.
 Moon: The moon should be mapped both
 from lunar orbit; and then from landings and
 traverses.  11; is important to know such a
 simple thing as how a handful of moon dust
 would distribute itself if allowed to fall back.
 Venus: It is possible scientists have been
 too hasty in accepting the assumption from
 radiation   measurements  that  the  surface
 temperature  is  too  high to  support life.
 Such  heat  could  come   from  nonthermal
 sources, and low temperatures could exist at
 the summit of the high mountain ranges.
 Also some form of life could even dcvelop in
 suspension in the dense atmosphere.
 This is only the first of three reports the
 space science board is making on space re-
 search directions for the future.
 There is no question but that there will
 be a space program after 1970.  Tuns first
 report  tries  to  suggest  what  it  will-or
 should--look like.
 Lutz Cabinet Co., a Wyoming Industry
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. TENO RONCALIO
 OF WYOMING
 IN TILE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. RONCALIO.  Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
 cans have always taken pride in the
 recitation of a single man's success in
 our free enterprise system.  An integral
 part of our culture is the firm and abid-
 ing belief that our economic system offers
 each man an opportunity to seek a better
 way of life through dedication, hard
 work, and a continuing faith in our Na-
 tion's potential.
 This lesson is all the more valuable
 when it demonstrates that there are still
 developing markets in. our Nation that
 offer great rewards to men of these as-
 pirations. Wyoming is such a place, with
 abundant natural resources, reserves of
 trained manpower, an excellent trans-
 portation system, amidst an area of well-
 to-do consumers.
 I am proud today to call attention to
 the achievements of a friend of many
 years, Louis Lutz of Laramie, Wyo.  Be-
 ginning as a carpenter in Laramie, Mr.
 Lutz recognized Wyoming's potential and
 pursued his career in Laramie, ultimately
 building one of Wyoming's fastest grow-
 ing industries.   His cabinet company,
 founded in 1949, now represents an in-
 vestment of over $300,000, employing 25
 persons.  It is Wyoming's largest wood
 milling shop and one of the largest cus-
 tom furniture producers in the Rocky
 Mountains.
 The following article from Wyoming
 Progress Reports, a monthly publication
 of the Wyoming Natural Resource Board,
 explains Mr. Lutz' good cause for faith
 in Wyoming's growing ability to sustain
 profitable industrial ventures.   I rec-
 ommend his philosophy to those who
 seek a promising and profitable career
 in the great undeveloped markets of the
 Rockies.
 A7I.`z; -
 The article follows:
 One of Wyoming's fastest growing busi-
 nesses  recently occupied  it  new  plant                                                    in
 Laramie, representing an investment of more
 than $300,000.
 Lutz Cabinet Co., the State's largest wood
 milling shop, began operations at ii .s new
 26,000-square-foot facility late in 1965, sig-
 naling the latest achievement in a proud
 growth record.
 Louis Lutz, a native of Laramie, founded
 Lutz Cabinet Co. in 1949 as a small-scale
 operation.   The company now employs Ti
 persons and is among the largest custom
 furniture producers in the Rocky Motuftai.n
 region.
 The firm does not manufacture furniture
 for the general market.   Its products are
 custom built for specific contract purposes.
 For example, work is currently underway on
 a $500,000 contract to supply dormitory fur-
 niture for  the University                                                                                                                                      of  Wyoming III
 Laramie.
 Major supply sources for the company are
 the East (for birch and oak) and the Pacific
 Northwest (for plywood).
 Lutz Cabinet  Co.'s  principal product is
 cabinet work for Laramie area contractors
 on such projects as apartments and resi,:en-
 tial developments.                                                                                                                                  In recent years, the com-
 pany has broadened its base of operations
 with the receipt of many contracts for col-
 l.ege dormitories, hospitals, and State insti-
 tutions.   For these projects, Lutz Cabinet
 Co. produces drawers, wardrobe units, and
 desks.
 As an added feature of its operations, the
 firm designs many of its products and much
 of  its equipment, enlisting the assistance
 of University of Wyoming specialists as con-
 sultants on specific projects.
 Lutz cites several advantages of his Lar-
 amie  location.   Transportation  facilities--
 both truck and rail-are excellent.  In addi-
 tion, the Laramie area offers an abundance
 of skilled labor. The firm's proximity to its
 growing market facilitates shipping of the
 highly finished company product.
 Within a 150-mile radius of Laramie are
 the University of Wyoming, Colorado State
 University, Colorado State College, Colorado
 School of Mines, University of Colorado, Den-
 ver University, and several junior colleges--
 comprising an excellent market for Lutz Cab-
 inet Co.'s products in Wyoming, Colorado,
 and Nebraska.
 Finally, Lutz credits the Laramie area's
 highly favorable business climate with help-
 ing the growth and prosperity of his com-
 pany.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM H. NATCHER
 OF KENTUCKY
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr.   NATCHER.  Mr.  Speaker,  our
 country is once again preparing to cele-
 brate the birthday of our first President.
 Americans,  throughout  the land will
 pause oil that day, February 22, and pay
 due tribute to the splendid and unselfish
 genius of his great man who gave so
 much of himself and his talents in his
 efforts to establish and sustain this then
 fledgling young Nation.  History records
 George Washington as a leader in many
 fields and certainly not the least of his
 accomplishments were in the area of
 agriculture.  At heart, George Washing-

 So we are killing Vietcong, but regaining
 very little territory for the Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment we are fighting for.  in some areas,
 such as the Mekong Delta, we have less terri-
 tory under Government control than we had
 18 months ago.
 Gen. William C. Westmoreland is in charge
 of the American military effort here.  Like
 Gen. Dwight Eisenhower in World War II he
 finds himself spending almost as much time
 in the airy sphere of diplomacy, soothing the
 wounded egos of other military men, as he
 does in fighting the war.
 Unlike Eisenhower, though, Westmoreland
 doesn't even have the luxury of a unified
 command.  In theory at least he must ask
 permission from the Vietnamese generals be-
 fore moving his men into battle.  And for
 reasons stated above this is often not in his
 best interests.  Too often in this war, large,
 expensive military operations are pulled on
 empty valleys.   One operation last year re-
 suited in a net kill of 26 water buffaloes.  No
 one could determine whether they were Viet-
 cong sympathizers.
 In certain ways, Westmoreland is repre-
 sentative of the entire American effort here.
 For one thing, he looks like a general.  He is
 lean of jaw, steely of gaze, with fierce black
 eyebrows  that  John  Ford's  makeup  men
 would  have  a  hard  time  inventing. He
 doesn't smoke, seldom drinks, and utters only
 an occasional "dag nabbit" when upset. To
 some of those working with him, he is still
 the Eagle Scout he once was.
 "Westmoreland is a very nice guy," one
 American political expert says, "but I don't
 think he understands much about evil.  He
 wants his men to be gentlemen, noble war-
 riors preserving freedom for an imperiled
 country.   They  should   be   out cutting
 throats."
 Most homefront heroes cannot understand
 why a war in a small country like Vietnam
 should be giving a great power like the United
 States so much trouble.   They believe we
 should blow up Hanoi or Haiphong, drop our
 nuclear weapons and blast the Communists
 off the map.  (It is interesting that the atom
 bomb advocates are always willing to drop the
 bomb on Asians; it is doubtful they would
 drop it if this war were being fought in
 Sweden.)
 The      American military men understand
 some of the folly of these arguments.  For
 one thing, Saigon is the hostage for Hanoi.
 If our bombers took out Hanoi-no simple
 matter, since it is conceded that the Com-
 munist capital has more formidable anti-
 aircraft facilities than wartime Berlin-the
 Communists  could  take out  Saigon  in  3
 days.  Their supporters could blow up most
 major facilities, hotels, and the communi-
 cations and sewer systems; if Haiphong goes
 the Saigon River could be bottled up with
 a  few well-placed mines and  mortar  fire
 could wreak havoc at Ton Son Nhut airport.
 So the strategy has become relatively sim-
 ple.   The  military                 must  operate on    the
 theory that no peace will  be negotiated.
 Starting from that point they believe that
 for the next several years an all-out war of
 attrition must be waged against main-force
 Vietcong and North Vietnamese units,
 While the Americans and the best Vietna-
 mese units are waging that kind of war (it
 will require at least another 200,000 Ameri-
 cans), the Vietnamese Popular Forces and
 regional militia units will have to deal with
 the guerrilla units in the countryside.  Keep
 the pressure on, and the guerrilla war will
 simply peter out.  The lowest time estimate
 for accomplishing all this is 7 years.
 A lot of people have severe doubts about
 this strategy.  It echoes the French methods,
 and denies the fact that large-scale oper-
 ations too frequently result in the deaths of
 the very peasantry the government is sup-
 posed to be winning over.
 Probably the only hope of winning lies
 with the kind of pacification program being
 run under the direction of Gen. Lewis Walt
 and his marines. out of Da Nang.  The ma-
 rines have been treated harshly by some
 critics because they have not gone out and
 killed as many people as possible. But Walt
 understands the futility of battles like that
 of the Is, Drang in which great numbers are
 killed and the government still cannot walk
 back in. His men have been working quietly,
 with some efficiency, village by village.
 It would be unfortunate if the Marine
 Corps alumni association forces them to give
 up and go back to all-out assault.  If any-
 thing at all is clear about this confused war,
 it is that its roots are political.  Ultimately,
 its solution will be political too.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CLARK W. THOMPSON
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. THOMPSON  of  Texas.   Mr.
 Speaker, there is ever-increasing interest
 and discussion on the future of our great
 maritime industry.                  The technological
 aspects of it are of particular concern to
 us all.
 It was with a great deal of interest
 when I read the remarks of Adm. John
 Harllee, U.S. Navy, retired, Chairman of
 the Federal Maritime Commission, be-
 fore the Transportation Association of
 America's National Transportation Insti-
 tute on January 12, 1966, at the Waldorf
 Astoria Hotel in New York City.
 His remarks follow, and I commend
 them to the attention of the Congress:
 REMARKS OF ADM. JOHN HARLLEE, U.S. NAVY,
 RETIRED, CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL MARI-
 TIME COMMISSION, BEFORE THE TRANSPORTA-
 TION  ASSOCIATION  OF  AMERICA'S  NATIONAL
 TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE ON JANUARY 12,
 1966, AT THE WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL  IN
 NEw YORK CITY
 These are exciting times in the marine
 transportation Industry and unquestionably
 one of the most exciting phases is the new
 impetus  in  containerization  which could
 achieve a technological revolution in ocean
 transportation.
 But, while the year ahead will unquestion-
 ably see the first manifestations of transat-
 lantic containerization it might be years be-
 fore the full impact of this new type of ship-
 ping service is felt by the industry.
 Before containerization arrives full blown,
 we at the Federal Maritime Commission must
 reexamine and reassess our governing stat-
 utes, the rules and transportation principles
 enunciated thereunder, and our body of case
 law, all formulated under traditional con-
 cepts of break-bulk service, and determine
 whether  they  meet  future  transportation
 needs and whether, in their present form
 they are equal to the task of providing regu-
 latory guidance and assistance to steamship
 operators and protection to the prospective
 users of containerized ocean transportation.
 As you know, the transatlantic steamship
 trade is one of our most important, whether it
 be viewed in terms of the number of vessels
 committed to it, the type of cargo moving, the
 volume of that cargo or its value.  Today the
 carriers in that trade operate services largely
 indistinguishable from those existing when
 the Shipping Act was passed in 1916.  That
 is changing fast and within the next few
 years the trade may become unrecognizable.
 Within that time at least four major U.S.-
 A717
 flag carriers and four foreign-flag carriers will
 inaugurate integrated container service with
 significant numbers of high speed vessels
 between the United States and northern
 Europe.  Most of these vessels expect to load
 and discharge containers on a lift-on, lift-off
 basis, but some may be designed for roll-on,
 roll-off operations.  This technological revo-
 lution has been long in coming to our foreign
 trade and should be welcomed not only by
 this Nation and its trading partners in Europe
 but also by the shippers and consignees en-
 gaged in that trade.
 The need for high-speed container service
 in the transatlantic trades is manifest.  Ob-
 viously, operators of containerized vessels will
 continue to be confronted by operational
 and labor problems.  There is also the prob-
 lem of international trade rivalries.                                                                                                                                   While
 the United States may feel it has the ad-
 vantage of a head start there is every in-
 dication that foreign-flag interest in con-
 tainerization is accelerating.  All in all, how-
 ever, the prospects for the success of con-
 tainerized service in this and other trades
 appear encouraging.  The capital required to
 move these new vessels from the drawing
 boards to the berth is staggering.  We should
 tender a hearty well done to all those steam-
 ship companies who intend to participate
 in this venture to so dramatically improve
 service.    Containerziation    should   bring
 benefits to carriers and shippers alike and
 make  a  substantial      contribution  toward
 achieving the national goal of expanding
 our foreign trade.
 The full impact of the operational changes
 that will be forthcoming from containeri-
 zation of the transatlantic trade cannot be
 evaluated until we have had actual experi-
 ence with this method of ocean transport.
 Nevertheless,  prudence  and  commonsense
 dictate that we make preparations now for
 what is coming.  The Federal Maritime Com-
 mission and the other agencies who regulate
 transportation must reevaluate their reg-
 ulatory programs on the basis of what Is
 about to happen rather than what happened
 yesterday.  We do know that containeriza-
 tion will bring changes in more than the
 physical features of the vessels involved.  We
 do know that the maximum efficiencies of
 containerized service can be realized only
 when the containers are loaded at inland
 points, where most of the cargo originates,
 and are tendered for delivery at inland points
 of destination.  We know that containeriza-
 tion has encouraged the through movement
 of goods and that this trend will be greatly
 accelerated when containerized service  is
 fully established in the transatlantic trades.
 The carriers have been attempting to comply
 with existing legislation by segmenting the
 charges for the service they perform by filing
 with various regulatory agencies those ap-
 plicable  segments  of  the  through  rates.
 For example, motor carriers file with the In-
 terstate Commerce Commission rates cover-
 ing the portion of the haul in the United
 States, Under present rules those carriers
 must file with the Federal Maritime Com-
 mission their port-to-port rates based  on
 the theory that they are non-vessel-owning
 common carriers by water in foreign com-
 merce.  That portion of the haul occurring
 within the foreign country is not required to
 be filed anywhere.  When such transporta-
 tion involves air carriers they must file a
 portion of the through rate with the Civil
 Aeronautics  Board  and  their  port-to-port
 rates with the Federal Maritime Commission.
 This type of segmented rate regulation may
 be unwieldy, time consuming, costly, and of
 marginal utility to both shippers and car-
 riers.                                                                                                                              A single factor through rate filed with
 a single governmental entity may be more
 conducive to  an effective transportation
 system.  Perhaps a joint board similar to
 the one proposed by the Federal Maritime
 Commission, Interstate Commerce Commis-
 sion, and Civil Aeronautics Board to exercise
 jurisdiction over through rates in certain of

 our domestic offshore trades should be ex-
 panded to include our foreign trades.  Mat-
 ters such as these have been under contin-
 uing study by the chairmen of all three of
 the major transportation regulatory agencies
 and  we  intend  to  maintain  this liaison.
 However, neither a joint board nor the re-
 spective stalls of the Interstate Commerce
 Commission. Civil Aeronautics Board, or Fed-
 eral                       Maritime  Commission  can effectively
 deal with these problems unless we receive
 the counsel, advice, and cooperation of the
 carriers involved and the users of their serv-
 fees.                  We need to know more precisely the
 types of services contemplated, the problems
 both operational and regulatory that are en-
 visaged by the carriers and the shippers, and
 most important the views of all concerned as
 to how the mint efforts of the Government
 transportation regulators can be utilized to
 accommodat.o  carriers  and  shippers  alike
 while maintaining the protection of the pub-
 lic interest.
 We must also direct our efforts to find
 answers to these problems which are likely
 to arise from major containerization prob-
 lems:
 Will containerization bring changes in tra-
 ditional rate patterns and rate structures?
 Will containerization change the method.
 of pricing transportation service?
 For instance, under containerization will.
 pricing relate more to the movement of the
 container rather than to its contents?
 Will "freight all kinds" rates be available
 in these services?
 Can a single bill of lading with a single
 factor rate be utilized to cover the through
 movement of goods from an inland point,
 across the ocean and then to another inland
 point?
 Will containerization reduce the need -or
 the proliferation of shipping documents that
 are now necessary to move cargo from an in-
 Land point in the United States to an inland"
 point in Europe?
 Will  containerization  permit  simplifica-.
 Lions of the shipping documents that will
 be required?
 What effect will containerization have on
 independent ocean freight forwarders and
 nonvessel owning common carriers now reg-
 ulated by the Federal Maritime Commission?
 Containerization   will   obviously   bring
 manifold changes in the method of loading
 and  unloading  vessels.    What  effect will
 these technological changes have on tradi-
 tional terminal operations?  Indeed, consid?-
 ering the heavy capital outlays that will be
 required to :adapt present terminal facilities
 to containerization will it be possible for the
 lines to operate such facilities at all ports
 presently being served? If not, will it mean
 that certain ports will have the benefits of
 containerization and others will not? More
 important  perhaps  is  the  question  of
 whether containerization will draw substan-
 tial  amounts  of                      cargo  from ports  where
 such service is unavailable.   If this is so,
 will it be consistent with the public interest
 and compatible with sound transportation
 policy?
 Is it feasible to move all types of general
 cargo in containers?  If not, what accommo-
 dations will be made for moving such items'?
 Will containerized vessels attract only the
 highway paying cargoes?  It so, what will
 happen to those operators of modern yet
 conventional vessels who will be relegated
 to the carriage of low paying cargo?
 How are the regulatory agencies to police
 such  malpractices  as   misdeclaration  of
 freight, misweighing, and rebating?   Which
 agency will  have  jurisdiction  over these
 matters'?  Who is to be held responsible for
 these practices, the shipper, the freight for-
 warder, the non-vessel-owning common car-
 rier, the inland carrier, or the ocean carrier?
 Fortunately, the Federal Maritime Commis-
 sion with the cooperation of the Interstate
 Commerce Commission has embarised on a
 compliance program on containerized freight
 moving in our domestic offshore trades.  We
 are hopeful that that program when ade-
 quately tested will serve as a model for simi-
 lar programs in foreign trades.
 I would be less than candid if I pretended
 to know the answers to all the questions
 raised here.  But I intend to do my part in
 preparing myself and the staff of the Federal
 Maritime Commission to be in a be-.ter posi-
 tion in the days ahead to come to grips with
 these problems and others, and if possible to
 formulate rational and effective  responses.
 I know my colleagues at the Interstate Com-
 merce  Commission  and  Civil                                                                                  Aeronautics
 Board join me in these pursuits.  Time is
 one of the luxuries seldom  enjoyed by a
 regulatory agency. Usually, we are required
 to react to a crisis already in being.  Here
 we are confronted with a grand opportunity
 to lay plans for a revolutionary change in the
 techniques of transportation.  But we can-
 not wait too long or this problem too will be
 upon us.
 Every regulatory program should  have a
 purpose and I can assure this audlenee and
 those with whom the Federal Maritime Com-
 mission deals more directly that if our pro-
 grams are round purposeless in the light of
 changing transportation conditions they will
 be  promptly  reevaluated.  When  our  pro-
 grams and policies no longer serve t.o protect
 those involved in ocean transportation from
 the evils the Shipping Act was designed to
 eliminate the Federal Maritime Commission
 will act promptly.  It is essential that tech-
 nological advances in transportation not be
 hamstrung and frustrated by governmental
 policies which have no place in ;i modern
 transportation system.
 I solicit your assistance and ad,. ice as to
 how the Federal Maritime Commission, the
 Interstate Commerce Commission, and the
 Civil Aeronautics Board can effectively dis-
 charge their regulatory responsibilities in the
 technological challenges we all av:;ait.  The
 information and assistance you are able to
 provide regarding this new concept of trans-
 portation may be determinative of whether
 we spend our time wisely.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN A. RACE
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOIJSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. RACE..  Mr. Speaker, too often the
 Congress and the Federal Government
 are  unfairly criticized for  assuming
 legitimate responsibilities in meeting the
 needs of our people.
 When editorial praise for a controver-
 sial Federal service occurs, it is an occa-
 sion to be noted. For this reason, I re-
 quest to be inserted in the RECORD at this
 point, the following editorial from the
 February 12 edition of the Sheboygan,
 Wis., Press:
 MISDIRECTED CRrrICISM
 The forthcoming meeting of the National
 Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which
 opens a 4-day session at Las Vegass Monday,
 is a timely reminder that the rural electrifi-
 cation program in this country is approach-
 ing                                                     its  30th  birthday  with  a  becoming
 maturity.
 In the present era, It is difficult, to recall
 that as recently as 1935 only about 10 percent
 of the Nation's farms were receivi!ig electric
 service,  The inability of private industry to
 extend electric service in those days led to
 the passage of the Rural Electrification Act
 of 1936.  This measure promoted farm elec-
 trification through low-interest Government
 loans.  As a result, today more than 98 per-
 cent of the country's farms have some sort c,f
 electrification.
 Despite this worthy accomplishment, the
 REA unfortunately is constantly being made
 the whipping- boy by ultraconservatives and
 disgruntled  politicians.   They  attack  the
 Rural Electrification Administration program
 as another form of Federal bureaucracy that
 is creating unfair competition for    private
 industry.
 Such criticism is unfair.  Should the Fed-
 eral Government be criticized for stepping; in
 and meeting a need that obviously should be
 met?  Certainly the Nation has benefited by
 the Government's rural electrification pro-
 gram.                                                                                                                                      Perhaps there were good reasons why
 private industry was not able to extend its
 services in the 1930's. But that does not mean
 that the necessity for rural electrification
 could be overlooked or indefinitely delayed.
 When  private  industries  or  individual
 States fail to function to provide a necessary
 public service, the Federal Government in-
 evitably steps in to meet the need.
 Shortage of Technicians a Problem for All
 of Us
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN H. DENT'
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA'TIVF`t
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. DENT. Mr.  Speaker,  improved
 and expanded vocational and technical
 education  is  vital              to  the  continued
 growth of our  economy.  The                  United
 States-indeed, the world-is faced with
 a gigantic rebuilding task, and this can
 be successfully accomplished only with
 the assistance of thousands of new tech-
 nicians.
 This is a problem in which I am vitally
 interested.  Last year, I sponsored the
 National Vocational Student Loan Insur-
 ance Act of 1965.  I had the honor of
 seeing this act become Public Law 89-
 287.  This is one step and one approach
 toward providing more technicians  to
 our workforce.
 The problem in general is being vigor-
 ously approached by the U.S. Office of
 Education's Division of Vocational and
 Technical Education, under the direc-
 tion of Assistant Commissioner Dr. Wal-
 ter M. Arnold.  A training program on
 the vast scale envisioned, however, can
 only be successful if there is close coop-
 eration between all parties concerned--
 Government,  educational  institutions.
 and private industry.
 This point is brought out effectively in
 a stimulating article, based in large part
 on statements made by Dr. Arnold, which
 appeared this month in Testing World.
 a magazine published by Soiltcst, I:ric..
 long a pioneer in the use of electronic
 methods in subsurface investigations and
 quality control of construction work gen-
 orally.
 It is a pleasure to insert this article
 in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

 ing, as the wife of a key Government official,
 will be caught up in considerably more social
 activity.
 That is uncertain, however, considering the
 fact that most of the people around Johnson,
 a hard taskmaster, are too busy for much
 social life.  Certainly the Flemings will be
 sought out socially, since they are now in
 the White House inner circle.
 JOB PAYS LESS
 Even though his family will see less of
 him, they approved of his taking the job,
 which at $28,600 a year pays somewhat less
 than he made at ABC.
 Mrs. Fleming was the first to know about
 the offer of the job made to Fleming on Feb-
 ruary 1, by Bill D. Moyers, White House press
 secretary.
 She talked it over with Fleming at length.
 After conceding that the longer hours would
 keep him away from home, she agreed with
 him that the job presented an opportunity
 and challenge  that would  have  its  com-
 pensations.
 The Fleming boys were not told of the
 offer until the following Friday-February
 4-just before Fleming took off for Honolulu
 with the President.  They took the same at-
 titude as their mother.
 BORN IN MILWAUKEE
 It was generally agreed that being thrust
 into the middle of national and interna-
 tional affairs would supplement the boys'
 schooling.
 Robert, Junior, is a senior at Woodrow
 Wilson High School, not far from his com-
 fortable four-bedroom home in northwest
 Washington.
 Fred is in the ninth grade at Alice Deal
 Junior High School. - Both boys were born
 in Milwaukee.
 As a result of the earlier family discussions
 of the matter, the  excitement was partly
 over by the time the President made the
 announcement Friday at an impromptu news
 conference.
 The telephone began to ring immediately
 at the Fleming home.  For an hour Fleming
 took the calls, which were from Washington
 correspondents and associates in the broad-
 casting industry who were calling to con-
 gratulate him.
 GET ACQUAINTED DINNER
 Then the Flemings drove to the Moyers
 home for dinner.  This was a get acquainted
 session for Jean Fleming and Judith Moyers,
 who had not previously met.  And it gave
 Fleming and Moyers a chance to talk busi-
 ness.
 The  conversation was interrupted by  a
 number of calls transferred from Fleming's
 home to Moyers' home through the White'
 House switchboard.  Presidential press secre-
 taries are always reached through the White
 House, since the operators there know where
 they are.
 The  first  call  to Fleming  through  the
 White House came while he was at Moyers'
 house.  It was from Mrs. Polly Greenberg,
 daughter of Lindsay Hoben,  editor of the
 Milwaukee Journal.  One of Fleming's sons
 had told her he was at the Moyers.
 Mrs. Greenberg wanted to arrange for ABC
 coverage of the visit to Washington of a child
 development  group  from Mississippi com-
 posed of 48 children and 25 parents and
 teacher involved in Project Headstart.
 MORE CALLS SATURDAY
 The group came here to demonstrate the
 quality of the Head Start program to Con-
 gress and to express its disappointment over
 the delay of the office of economic opportu.
 nity in refunding the project.
 Fleming called ABC from Moyers' home to
 assign a camera crew to the Mississippi dele-
 gation.
 Fleming took a few more congratulatory
 calls when he got home just before midnight
 as well as Saturday morning before he finally
 escaped to the weekend cabin.
 But even there the calls kept coming,
 from old friends and associates like Anthony
 0. DeLorenzo, former Wisconsin newspaper-
 man now vice president for public relations
 of the General Motors Corp., and Fred W.
 Friendly, an official of the Columbia Broad-
 casting System.
 Fleming spoke wistfully Saturday of those
 restful weekends in the country.  He still
 holds out hopes of continuing to go there.

 HON. NEAL SMITH
 OF IOWA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. SMITH of Iowa.  Mr. Speaker,
 from a magnificent height, United Na-
 tions delegates can look over the East
 River and a part of the world and per-
 haps be inspired to play a meaningful
 role, with some quiet diplomacy, which
 could eventually lead to peace negotia-
 tions in Vietnam.
 The realist cannot be too optimistic,
 but still the presenting of a resolution on
 the Security Council agenda represents
 a victory for this administration.
 According to the Des Moines Sunday
 Register:
 The Security Council set no date for de-
 bating the resolution in the hope that quiet
 diplomacy would accomplish something.
 The U.N. meeting was worth while-
 The editorial continued-
 because it showed in action that the U.S.
 peace drive is not ended, even though U.S.
 bombing  in North Vietnam has been re-
 sumed. It reminded U.N. members who have
 been  reluctant  to  spend  money  for U.N.
 peacekeeping operations how valuable a U.N.
 peace force might be.
 Despite what may be a long road
 ahead, the Des Moines paper sees the
 U.N. Security Council meeting as a sign
 of hope-as "one more drop of water on
 the stone."  So that others may see this
 summary of why reasonable talk might
 eventually lead to peace, I recommend
 this editorial and include it in the REC-
 ORD:
 THE U.N. AND VIETNAM
 The United Nations is the worst possible
 form of world organization (to paraphrase
 Winston Churchill), except any other form
 of world organization the world has yet had.
 For years                                         people  of good will have been
 saying,  "Why  doesn't  the  United  States
 bring the Vietnam war before the United
 Nations?"                                         Now the U.S. Government has
 done so.
 The results so far show why referral was
 delayed so long.
 U.N. member nations in the charter con-
 ferred on the U.N. Security Council primary
 responsibility for the maintenance of inter-
 national peace and security and power to
 issue binding orders, enforceable by their
 combined armed might, to members and
 nonmembers alike.  That was on paper.  The
 practice for 20 years has been rather dif-
 ferent.
 The practice has been to refer disputes
 back to the disputing parties, sometimes with
 mild suggestions about principles to follow.
 The most the United States thought it
 practical to ask of the U.N. Security Council
 was a nonbinding resolution.  The proposed
 resolution "notes" that the Geneva agree-
 ments of 1954 and 1962 on southeast Asia
 "have not been implemented."   It calls for
 immediate  discussions  without  precondi-
 tions  "among  the                                                                                                                                         appropriate interested
 governments" to arrange a conference "look-
 ing toward the application of the Geneva
 accords of 1954 and 1962 and the establish-
 ment of a durable peace in southeast Asia."
 The  proposed  resolution  also  "recom-
 mends" that the parties start by reaching
 agreement on a ceasefire   "under effective
 supervision."  The resolution goes on to offer
 V.N. assistance "by all appropriate means,"
 including arbitrators or mediators if desired,
 a "call" for "cooperation by all concerned,"
 and  the  services  of  Secretary  General U
 Thant.
 The United States just barely got  this
 mild resolution placed on the agenda, and
 the debate showed there would not be the
 votes needed to pass the resolution and that
 in any case there would probably be a Soviet
 veto.
 The Security Council set no date for debat-
 ing the resolution in the hope that quiet
 diplomacy  would  accomplish  something.
 Even if the resolution should be adopted, it
 simply passes the buck to the Geneva con-
 ference powers, some of whom have been
 refusing for months to reconvene the con-
 ference.
 Yet the U.N. meeting was worthwhile.  It
 showed in action that the U.S. peace drive
 is not ended, even though U.S. bombing in
 North Vietnam has been resumed.  It re-
 minded U.N. members who have been re-
 luctant to spend money for U.N. peacekeep-
 ing operations how valuable a U.N. peace
 force might be.
 In Vietnam, both sides say they accept the
 principles of the Geneva agreements, but
 each wants to control South Vietnam mili-
 tarily while the people decide in free elec-
 tions.  The United States would accept a
 properly constituted U.N. force or neutral
 force pending free elections.  So far the Com-
 munist side will not.  North Vietnam and
 Red China say they won't accept any U.N.
 role there at all.  They have not been ad-
 mitted as members and regard the U.N. as
 a U.S. front.
 But North Vietnam and the Vietcong might
 come.to accept some kind of neutral force
 (1) when they find that is the only way to
 get U.S. Armed Forces out; and (2)  when
 they  become  convinced  that  the  United
 States really is willing to get out on those
 terms.
 The U.N. Security Council meeting was
 one more drop of water on the stone to drive
 these points in.  Not blood, water.

 WE CAN TRAIN TECHNICIANS Now
 Although there is still a serious shortage
 of technicians in civil engineering and other
 engineering and science fields, it should be
 possible now to solve this problem if we
 can see it not as a problem just for edu-
 cators but for all of us-employers, business-
 men, government officials, and students alike.
 This,  plainly  stated,  is  the  belief  of Dr.
 Walter M. Arnold. Assistant Commissioner
 and    Director. Division  of  Vocational  and
 Technical  Education,    U.S.  Department   of
 Health Education.. and Welfare.
 The solution to the technician shortage is
 now possible, says Dr. Arnold, because of new
 Federal vocational education legislation and
 the joint Federal-State vocational education
 and training programs this legislation makes
 possible.  In short, the money is available.
 Now, the people must use it.
 tirEs'S 'JAS VOCATIONAL PROGRESS
 The money, the legislation, the programs
 for educating and training technicians and
 others in vocational fields did not cone easily
 or quickly.  Attempts to meet the Nation's
 vocational  education needs  have come in
 gradual stages, through the years.
 Step by step we have pursued the solu-
 tion to the vocational                     education problem
 with new laws, new provisions, but always
 the ultimate solution has seemed illusive.  If
 we have met the needs for vocational educa-
 tion in one  field,  then  needs  in another
 field have developed.  And gradually, in re-
 cent years, a great need has been mounting
 fur more and more technicians.  It is re-
 assuring for     our faith                     in the democratic
 method, however, that as the problems of
 technician and other vocational education
 have grown more serious and complex, our
 national solutions have  become more  in-
 genious and now, it is believed, ultimately
 successful.
 The major steps toward vocational educa-
 tion progress began with the Sinith-Hughes
 Act of 1917, which provided $7.2 million to
 the States for vocational programs, and range
 forward to the Higher Education Act of 1965,
 which gives financial aid for work at the col-
 lege and university level.
 WHAT EMPLOYERS CAN  DO
 Clearly the legislation exists now to do
 this job of education.  But just as clearly,
 says Dr. Arnold, "vocational educators can-
 not carry this new and tremendous burden
 alone."            What is needed is the help of em-
 ployers,                                  the  Nation's businessmen.   Says
 Walter F. Carey, president of the Chamber of
 Commerce of the United States:
 "The businessman is the key element in
 this whole             education picture. Far better
 than any educator or government adminis-
 trator, he is in a position to know what his
 company's manpower requirements will be
 for the next 5 years, the next 10 years."
 And yet at the same time the businessman
 himself often is impeded in playing his full
 potential role in the education and employ-
 ment of technicians.  Dr. Arnold comments:
 "The character effectiveness and economic
 value of capable technicians is still not uni-
 versally  appreciated     in  American  indus-
 try * * *   Some employers have never had
 a chance to hire a really good technician,
 much less appreciate him."  The probable
 cause for this situation, Dr. Arnold reasons,
 is the limited number of schools training
 highly competent technicians combined with
 the ready employment of these graduates by
 the relatively few firms near to the schools.
 THE  NEED, THE LEGISLATION
 't'his short supply and restricted employ-
 ment of technicians in past years was one of
 several causes which has contributed to the
 overall national technician problem-and its
 solution.
 Some of these causes have grown more in-
 tense and others have developed anew during
 the great period of national growth since
 World War II.  Taken together they have
 produced the push that in turn produced
 the surge of corrective Federal and  State
 legislation of the late 1950's and the 1960's
 from the beginning of the decade to the
 present.
 The  national  need  for  technicians   is
 further indicated in Dr. Arnold's enurnera-
 tion of conditions that he says led directly
 to Congress enaciing title VIII of the Na-
 tional Defense Education Act of 1958
 "First of all, the highly skilled technician
 was becoming; an increasingly essent:d part
 of the scientific and management t+:ain in
 modern scientific  esearch, development, pro-
 duction, and services.   The team i.  com-
 posed of pruiessional scientists, engineers,
 sspecially trained technicians supervis,>rs, and
 skilled production or laboratory workers.
 "Second, technicians are in short .vsipply.
 The ratio of technicians to scientists or engi-
 neers is usually less than 1 to 1, but 1 here is
 need for two or more technicians to support
 each engineer or professional scientist.
 "Third, * ?  *  the explosion of scientific
 knowledge (has been)  creating changes in
 scientific education so that the professional
 scientist or engineer (has)  received  little
 laboratory experience. Thus, a vacuum (has
 developed) in the area of applied laboratory
 knowledge which (has) had to be filled by
 highly skilled technicians."
 To cope with these interrelated fact ire the
 Federal Government, in the past few years,
 has moved to vastly improve American voca-
 tional  education,  including                                                                               the  education
 and training of technicians.
 AUDIOVISUAL AND OTHER METHODS
 One of the key areas in which tale new
 education  laws effectively     help technical
 education is in the research and develop-
 ment                                                                      of  new            techniques,  method;z,  and
 materials for teaching.
 The intent here is to educate an; train
 technicians  more  efficiently  by developing
 and using new teaching aids such as the
 Soiltest, Inc.,  35-millimeter  training, film
 strips. Other provisions are made for re-
 search and development of programed learn-
 ing techniques.
 The Higher Education Facilities  Act of
 1003  covered  specifically  the  construction
 of facilities for  public and. nonprofit col-
 leges, authorizing $1.2 billion for this pur-
 pose.                                                                      Of this total, 22 percent is earmarked
 for public community colleges and public
 technical institutes, institutions which offer
 numerous vocational courses.
 FIGURES TELL THE RESULTS
 These have been the plans, the new laws,
 -;he techniques aimed at producing enough
 technicians and other vocational workers to
 meet the needs of the United States which
 has grown from 140 million population at
 the end of World War II to 200 million in
 just two decades.  The needs of other na-
 lions in the world are comD arable.
 The results can be seen in some simple
 statistics, as explained by Dr. Arno]::1:
 "For many yea::s (prior to the new laws)
 the number of new technicians formally pre-
 pared to work with physical scientists and
 engineers had been limited to about 16,000
 graduates of a relatively few publicly sup-
 ported institutions and a number of private
 nonprofit  technical  institutes.  Studies  of
 physical  sciences  and   related  engineering
 fields indicate a need for at least 100,000 new
 technicians each ;dear."
 How close is the United States coming to
 these goals?  Is the Nation meeting its needs
 for the technically educated?
 Since 1958, when the NDEA was passed,
 some 63,000 new technicians have completed
 training under the provisions of the act.
 Enrollment of full-time students in tech-
 nical education programs swelled from 20,000
 an 1958 to 102,000 in the 1964-65 scho,l year.
 Total enrollment, both full time and part
 'time, has grown from about 94,000 in 1958
 to about 250,000 :.n the 1.964-65 school year.
 Of these, 148,000 were employed adults in
 upgrading and refresher courses.
 The number of schools offering techni-
 cian training has grown from 260 at tine be -
 ginning of NDEA in 1958 to nearly 1,000 in
 1965.
 The Nation, it is apparent, has recognised
 its need for educating technicians.  It is be-
 ginning to meet these needs.
 "We are all in this endeavor toge licr,"
 says Dr. Walter M. Arnold.  ?* * * Leaders
 in industry and in vocational and techni-
 cal education " * * are being called upon
 to  provide  realistic,  high-quality  occupa-
 tional education to meet present and future
 manpower needs at the lowest net; long-term
 cost.   Modern  America  requires      techni--
 cfans * * * and their counterparts in man-
 agement,  marketing,                                                                                                                                           and  servicing--With
 better basic training at the start of their
 careers than ever before.     The pattern of
 the past * * * is not good enough largely
 because of the impact of research on all
 facets of modern living.
 "Educators alone cannot perform this task,
 but together we can meet the challenge in
 a truly American tradition of cooperative
 accomplishment."

 Can we, finally, convince those who live by

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN R. HANSEN
 OF IOWA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. HANSEN of Iowa.  Mr. Speaker,
 in my opinion, the President's recent
 peace offensive was not the utter failure
 it has been made out to be by Mr. John-
 son's critics. Despite Hanoi's refusal to
 even take notice of our invitations to
 negotiate, the President's overtures met
 with success in other areas.
 Our motives for being in Vietnam and
 our determination to stay there were
 made clear to other nations throughout
 the world.  We showed the world that
 we want peace-but not at any price. If
 nothing else were gained by our peace
 offensive, it still- must-in light of this
 fact-be considered at least partially
 successful.
 The district which I represent, the
 Seventh Iowa District, is well known for
 its conservative nature-especially in
 foreign affairs.  I am presenting a re-
 cent editorial from the Carroll Daily
 Times Herald to give my colleagues the
 benefit of the views of a conservative
 section of Iowa concerning Vietnam.
 OUR STAND CLEAR
 The war in Vietnam is apparently back
 where it was at the end of December, before
 the moratorium on bombing raids on the
 north began.
 Yet the nature of the conflict has changed
 in a very important way, despite the failure
 of the peace offensive to move the Hanoi
 regime toward the negotiating table.
 It is now clear to all but the most rabidly
 anti-American that no nation is more anxious
 to put an end to the fighting than the United
 States.  It is now clear to all but those im-
 movably committed to viewing the world
 through red-tinted glasses that this country
 desires peace and will take any feasible and
 honorable steps to secure it.
 Our call for a full-dress Security Council
 debate on Vietnain,  was such a step.  The
 pressure for peace has now been placed upon
 the international community, and some of
 that pressure must inevitably permeate to
 Hanoi.
 On the surface, the bombing lull accom-
 plished nothing, though no one can say with
 certainty just what went on during those 37
 days in the minds of the North Vietnamese
 leaders.
 The resumption of the raids will likely have
 little effect on the immediate course of the
 fighting.   It was  essentially  a  stalemate,
 though slowly escalating on both sides.     It
 will    remain  essentially  a  stalemate until
 either a cease-fire is achieved or until all
 possible paths that could lead to a cease-fire
 have been explored and found useless.
 But while both the military effect of the
 resumed bombings and the political force
 of  a  United  Nations  resolution  may  be
 limited, the two combined would amount to
 considerable and continual pressure on the
 North Vietnamese.
 Whether they realize it or not, the nature
 of the war has changed.
 The Vietnamese Communists can no longer
 pose as the sympathetic underdogs fighting
 valiantly against an Immoral, imperialistic
 bully.  They have nothing to gain by disdain-
 ful rejection of the peaceful offices of other
 nations.  Neither now nor next year nor 10
 years from now are they going to take over
 South Vietnam and drive the United States
 out by force of arms.
 Sooner or  later,  these truths must  get
 through to Hanoi and Peiping.  Until they
 do, however, continued fortitude, patience
 and restraint will be required of the Ameri-
 can people, and continued sacrifice will be
 asked of their sons.

 OF
 HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 2, 1966
 Mr. TEAGUE of Texas.  Mr. Speaker,
 January 25 to 27, 1966, the Committee on
 Science and Astronautics held its seventh
 annual meeting with its Panel on Science
 and Technology.  Under the leadership
 of our distinguished chairman, the gen-
 tleman from California, Congressman
 GEORGE  MILLER,  the  committee  was
 pleased to welcome one of the great
 spokesmen. of science in the world, Sir
 Charles Snow.
 It was appropriate that this eminent
 forum began with an address by the Vice
 President of the United States.
 His talk covered many of the great
 scientific and technical challenges of our
 time. He stressed the need for increased
 partnership between Government and
 science in order that the greatest bene-
 fits of this age might be realized.
 I include the text of Vice President
 HUMPHREY'S address in the RECORD:
 OPENINGS REMARKS, VICE PRESIDENT HUDERT
 HUMPHREY, PANEL ON SCIENCE AND TECH-
 NOLOGY, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND
 ASTRONAUTICS,  WASHINGTON,  D.C.,  JANU-
 ARY 25, 1966
 I would like you to know, Mr. Chairman,
 how proud President Johnson is of the work
 which your committee has performed.   This
 committee has provided a model of congres-
 sional oversight.  Your panel of 15 outstand-
 ing scientists and engineers has provided
 invaluable counsel-not only to the 31 mem-
 bers of this committee but-indirectly-to
 the Congress as a whole.
 May I say to our distinguished Speaker,
 you can be very proud of having been a
 father of this House committee,  The record
 of history will show that you, Mr. Speaker,
 played a crucial role in the House of Rep-
 resentatives effective response after Sput-
 nik I.
 May I say, too, to my friend JIM FULTON
 that one of the most gratifying aspects of
 this committee's work is that you have acted
 on a bipartisan or better still, nonpartisan
 basis.
 In the full committee, in the Subcommit-
 tee on Scientific Research and Development
 chaired by Congressman  DADDARIO,  and in
 other subcommittee work, there has been
 a scientificlike search for facts and for the
 best opinion.  The committee and its sub-
 committee have "experimented" and the ex-
 periments have been very successful.
 It  is  appropriate  that  this  committee,
 which enjoys so outstanding an international
 reputation, should be host today to so great a
 world scientist and scholar as Lord Snow.
 We are proud to have him as our guest.
 May I begin today by saying that, as Chair-
 man of the National Aeronautics and Space
 Council, I am continually astounded by the
 expansion of scientific knowledged and its
 technological applications.
 One brief visit to Cape Kennedy is all the
 average citizen needs to realize how far sci-
 ence and technology have gone beyond his
 everyday capacity for understanding.
 I am in fact often reminded of the words of
 the Queen to Alice in Wonderland:
 "Now here, you see, it takes all the running
 you can do to keep in the same place.  If you
 want to get somewhere else, you must run at
 least twice as fast as that."
 Sir Charles Snow has warned of the gap
 between  science  and the  humanities-the
 two cultures, as he has called them.
 There is danger of another gap: a gap be-
 tween public policy and advancing science
 and technology.   In government we face the
 task of closing that gap.
 One  of  our      panelists,  Dean  Price,  has
 stressed the importance of this in his schol-
 arly                                                                                                                                and      helpful  book.       "The   Scientific
 Estate"  He says:
 "Only if a nation can induce scientists to
 play an active role in government, and poli-
 ticians to take a sympathetic interest in sci-
 ence (or at least in scientific institutions)
 can it enlarge its range of positive freedom,
 and renew its confidence that science can
 contribute progressively to the welfare  of
 mankind."
 It has often been said that to govern is to
 choose.
 Those of us in government, who have the
 responsibility to choose, must have the in-
 sights  and  foresights  that  scientists  and
 technologists, in government and outside,
 can offer us.
 Among the decisions that have faced the
 President in recent months, many have in-
 volved scientific and technological consider-
 ations.   I  think  of  decisions    concerning
 water  resources, desalting, oceanography,
 arms control and disarmament, transporta-
 tion, urban problems, education, defense-
 and the list is by no means complete.
 And our Government is not unique in this
 respect.  Virtually every developed nation is
 wrestling with the problem of adapting its
 laws, procedures, and institutions to meet
 advanced science and technology.
 To cite only two examples, the British Gov-
 ernment has recently reorganized its struc-
 ture for dealing with scientific matters, and
 so has the French.
 Here in the United States the President has
 had a Special Assistant for Science and Tech-
 nology since 1960.  The Office of Science and
 Technology has been in existence only since
 1962.

 or NEW YORK CITY
 The USO of New York City takes pride
 in presenting to the Honorable HUBERT H.
 HUMPHREY,  Vice  President  of  the  United
 States, its Gold Medal Award in recognition
 of his dedicated leadership and wholehearted
 support  of US'O  as  it continues       to  keep
 the  faith with  America's  Armed   Forces,
 February 3, 1966.
 REMARKS  OF V ICF. PRESIDENT HUDI:RT   HUM-
 PI3RET,                       USO,    NEW YORK   CITY,  FEBRUARY
 3, 1966
 it is a high honor to receive your Fifth An-
 nual Gold Medal, as it is a privilege to join
 with you in celebrating the 25th anniversary
 of the USO.
 During  this  quarter  of a century, over
 20 million American men and women who
 have  worn  the uniform.  of  their country
 have found in the USO a home away from
 home.
 USO seeks to answer the two questions al-
 ways on the m!nd of every GI wherever he
 Is:
 "Does anybody know I'm here?  Does any-
 body care?"
 And to these two questions you answer.
 in actions as well as words:  "Yes, we do
 know and we do care."
 We have an obligation to our American
 young men away from home -young men
 .;crying without complaint and with a high
 standard of performance.
 At Clark Field. near Manila, I saw recent-,
 ly young Americans-some of them terribly
 wounded-fresh  from  the  battlefields  of
 Vietnam.  As  I talked  with  them,   they
 showed in every word and action those spe-
 cial qualities of courage and determination
 which Americans have always demonstrated
 in every war.  We can surely be proud of
 there.
 I:n Korea, I traveled north to the 'truce line
 nod talked with American and Korean sol-
 diers in this cold and bleak place.
 Here, over a decade after the U.N. repelled
 Communist aggression, our American soldiers
 are still standing guard in one of freedom's
 loneliest and most remote frontiers.
 '['be soldiers I saw in Clark Field and Korea,
 like those in ether remote and often dan-
 gerous areas o  the world, deserve the as-
 surance that the American people have not
 forgotten them.  And USO-which I saw in
 action at  'l'ok^O, Manila, and Seoul--pro-
 sides that kind. of assurance.
 And I think it is in the best spirit of
 American democracy that USO, representing
 mix three major faiths, is nongovernmental
 arid represent., a wholly voluntary commit-
 nlent on the  part  of the American- people.
 Why are so many American soldiers in
 Asia either standing guard or engaged in a
 shooting war?
 They are there, primarily, to Insure the
 peoples of the countries in which they are
 stationed the right to choose, the right to
 decide their own futures--in other words, to
 have  the  basic  human  rights  of  self-
 determination and of independence.
 Self-determination and independence are
 threatened today by Asian communism, And
 so is main's search for peace.  For w`o face
 aiversaries who seek to prove that peaceful
 coexistence is a fraud--that militancy and
 force  are  the  paths  to  final Communist
 victory.
 During my two recent trips to Asia, I had
 die opportunity to talk with many national
 leaders. I sought their impressions of Asian
 communism, with which all of them have
 had firsthand experience.  I did so because
 it; is vital to know one's adversary as thor-
 oughly as possible, and through many liffer-
 ant eyes.
 I did not come back with simple answers
 ,jr simple panaceas.
 Asian communism Is a complex id-- ology.
 It Is deeply rooted in the tragic past of Asia,
 yet it is raw and dynamic.
 It isn't the timeworn, bureaucratic com-
 munism that has evolved in other places.
 It is aggressive.  And Its leaders are con-
 vinced of their ultimate success.
 its approach is not merely economic, al-
 though  it capitalizes on  the povert.a and
 despair of the Asian peasant.
 its tactic is not merely political, all sough
 .tls hard-core followers are dedicated be'levers
 in Marxist doctrine, and although it wraps
 i ;self in the robes of nationalism to ,tract
 those  who  aren't  yet ready  for  the  full
 gospel.
 Its thrust for power is not simply military,
 although  it never has won power       except
 by ruthless use of force--and I believe it
 :a ever will.
 The immediate threat is in Vietnam.      What
 are the realities of today in Vietnam"
 First, there is the reality that we :lace in
 South  Vietnam  no  mild-mannered     liberal
 evolutionary reformist party.  We fans dedi-
 cated Communist-led revolutionaries                                                                                seek-
 ing by force to subject a nation to therr will.
 ,Some of these revolutionaries are from the
 .south.   Some are from north. Some ire ir-
 regulars.                                                                                Some are regular North Vietna-
 mese soldiers.   Some of their supply and
 direction comes from the south.  Some of it
 comes from Hanoi.  Some of it come: from
 Peiping. Their creed  is    communism  and
 their means is terror.
 Second., there  is the  reality that what
 is happening In Vietnam is not an isolated
 occurrence, unconnected to events elsewhere.
 Those who inspire and support the the use
 of force in Vietnam have made their plans
 clear.  Those plans include the use of sub-
 version, of propaganda, of assassination, of
 sabotage,, and of outright military action to
 gain their objectives throughout the world.
 In some places, such as Vietnam, aggressiod
 Leas come in the guise of a war of national
 liberation.   In  others, such  as India and
 Korea, it has come as movement of regular
 troops across a national frontier.
 Th.e Communist-backed. terrorism ill Viet-
 nam is being felt; not only in Asia, bilt also
 i n Africa and in Latin America.
 Third, I would point to the reality that-
 faced with this aggressive: force-our response
 has  been  measured  and  our  objective
 peaceful.
 Last  April, President Johnson, at. Johns
 Hopkins University, made clear the uncon-
 clitional nature of our offer toward peaceful
 negotiation.   He  has reiterated the-, offer
 many times.    He has emphasized that so-
 called National Liberation Front repr, senta-
 tives could be represented in the negoti ctions.
 Last May the President ordered suspension
 of bombing in the north in the hop> that
 this might stimulate negotiation.   In De-
 cember we suspended the bombing again.
 In the past several weeks, the President
 has sent emissaries throughout the  world
 to  seek   some   means   toward    peaceful
 negotiation.
 Initiatives outside our own-by the U.N.
 Secretary General; by 17 nonalined nations;
 by the United Kingdom, Ghana, India., and
 other Commonwealth nations; by Japan, by
 the United Arab Republic; by Pope Paull VI-
 have been undertaken without success.
 We have stated unequivocally that we sup-
 port any effort toward negotiation, no mat-
 ter where initiated.  And we have directly
 communicated to Hanoi our willingness to
 begin immediately unconditional discussions..
 What has been the response from Hanoi
 and Peiping?   I read from Ho (:hl Minh's
 letter of last Friday:
 "The U.S. Imperialists are clamoring about
 their desire for peace and their readiness to
 engage In unconditional discussion in the
 Lope of fooling world opinion and the Amer-
 ican people.
 "Obviously the U.S. search for peace is only
 designed to conceal its scheme for intensify-
 ing the war of aggression."
 From  Peiping  has  come  an  unusually
 violent torrent of hate propaganda regarding
 President  Johnson's-and I quote-'"filthy
 and vicious " ? * basket of peace."
 It is clear that-in this time as in the
 past-those whose creed Is force disbelieve,
 the determination of democratic societies to
 resist their force.
 Given this response to the U.S. peace of-
 fensive,  President Johnson had no choice
 but to take steps to restore military pressure
 on North Vietnam.
 In announcing this decision, the President;
 emphasized that "the end of the pause does
 not mean the end of our own pursuit of
 peace."
 For we must not permit the struggle to be.,
 come purely military, either in Vietnam or
 elsewhere.
 We must persist with diplomatic Initia..
 tives for peace, in the United Nations and in
 all the capitals of the world.
 We must counter the Communist political
 thrust with better politics-the politics of
 democracy, of self-determination, of human
 dignity.
 We must help the nations of Asia move
 forward with economic and social reform so
 that the Asian citizen will have a real stake
 in his country.
 This is where the struggle will be decided
 in the long run.
 We have a clear obligation to help the
 people of Asia and of other continents to
 help themselves.  It is for this reason that 1
 commend to you the foreign aid program
 which President Johnson submitted to Con-
 gress this week.
 The President has proposed, and I quote,
 "to help give the people of the less devel-
 oped world the food, the health, the skills,
 and education--and the strength-to lead
 their nations to self-sufficient lives of plenty
 and freedom."
 We have set ourselves no easy task.   It
 will require patience and fortitude for years
 ahead.
 But I believe we can, in the end, succeed.
 For I believe Americans have learned the
 lessons of history so that we may not be
 doomed to repeat them.
 We have learned that the appetite of ag-.
 gressors is never satisfied.
 We have learned that a threat to freedom
 elsewhere can soon become a threat to free-
 dom here.
 Can  we accept the possibility  that the
 struggle against Communist expansion can
 go on for years ahead?
 Can we adapt the use of our military power
 to achieve limited goals while possessing mili-
 tary power in almost limitless quantity?

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX      February 1J, 1966
 May I close with Churchill's words, spoken
 at Harvard University some years ago:
 "If we are together nothing is impossible.
 If we are divided all will fail. I therefore
 preach continually the 'doctrine of the fra-
 ternal association of our two peoples, not for
 any purpose of gaining invidious material
 advantages for either of them, not for terri-
 torial aggrandisement or the vain pomp of
 earthly domination, but for the sake of
 service to mankind and for the honour that
 comes to those who faithfully serve- great
 to the minimum necessary to insure the
 security of our forces while continuing the
 effort to transfer the conflict to the negotiat-
 ing table.  And their concept of minimal
 necessity involves a military commitment
 significantly  smaller than that envisioned
 by the Pentagon or Marshal Ky.
 The Kennan and Gavin testimony clearly
 challenges many of the things said during
 and after the conference in Honolulu earlier
 this week, if not the carefully drawn lan-
 guage of the communique.  It recalls cer-
 ain basics that Americans in this difficult
 YkL/.situation need to keep in mind: Powerful as
 shifting resources from another section
 of the firm or calling upon their ample
 conventional credit sources.  When the
 same challenge is hurled against a small
 businessman, he may go under, not for
 any lack of ability or dedication, but sim-
 ply because he does not have time to
 gather money needed to provide a transi-
 tion to the next opportunity for profits,
 financial repair, and growth.
 Since last October, however, the assist-
 ance that Congress has declared should
 be available from the Small Business Ad-
 ministration has been denied.  In effect,
 we have said to the small businessman,
 "When disaster strikes elsewhere in the
 Nation, you must bear a special burden.
 You must survive without the programs
 that Congress said you should have."
 And, Mr. Speaker, this is by no means
 the first time that regular business loan
 suspensions have been decreed.  And,
 unless Congress acts, it will not be the
 last.
 The loan program suspension comes
 upon the heels of another serious blow
 at small business credit by the Govern-
 ment-the increase in the rediscount
 rate by the Federal Reserve Board. The
 consequent rise in the cost of credit is
 already being felt throughout the Na-
 tion.  Therefore, small business now
 faces a two-pronged crisis in credit.
 The purpose of this legislation is to in-
 sulate the business loan program against
 drains caused by natural disasters.  I
 recognize that my bill does not solve the
 problem of stabilizing the disaster loan
 program so that its proper benefits will
 always be available.  The unpredictable
 timing and scope of such disasters poses
 special dilemmas in assuring the full ef-
 fectiveness of such a program.  Possible
 remedies in this field merits the atten-
 tion of Congress but I strongly insist that
 the brunt of such disasters should not be
 placed upon small businessmen through-
 out the United States.
 The business loan program must be
 given a permanent and protected status.
 Appropriations for these loans must be
 carefully planned, fully evaluated by
 Congress, and should not be permitted to
 rise and fall on the whim of nature.
 Congress has wisely recognized the
 crucial value of small business to our
 free enterprise economy, therefore, I
 come before you today, Mr. Speaker, to
 plead for the reform and reinvigoration
 of the small business loan program and
 recomend this bill as a most important
 measure  to  translate  congressional
 promise into permanent performance for
 the small businessmen of America.
 Several of my colleagues have intro-
 duced similar bills and I am happy to
 join with them in this legislation.
 General Gavin's Vietnam Strategy Gains
 Impressive Support
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RICHARD D. McCARTHY
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 8, 1966
 Mr. McCARTHY.  Mr. Speaker, the
 number of distinguished and influential
 Americans who support the strategy for
 Vietnam proposed by Gen. James M.
 Gavin continues to grow.  While it is
 true that one man's view may vary subtly
 from the next, the basic approach is the
 same: Remain in Vietnam but avoid es-
 calation; limit the fighting while con-
 tinuing the effort to transfer the conflict
 to the negotiating table.
 The list now includes: General Gavin;
 Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, U.S. Army,
 retired; George F. Kennan, former U.S.
 Ambassador to the Soviet Union and
 Yugoslavia; Walter Lippmann, the dis-
 tinguished author and columnist; James
 B. Reston, associate editor of the New
 York Times; and J. WILLIAM FULBRIGHT,
 chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee.
 The case against escalation was force-
 fully presented last week by General
 Gavin and Ambassador Kennan in testi-
 mony before the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee and was summarized as
 follows in a New York Times editorial of
 February 11:
 THE CASE AGAINST ESCALATION
 Two Americans once deeply involved in
 top-level planning on the diplomatic and
 military fronts have now given the Nation
 strikingly parallel analyses of the dangers of
 escalating the war in Vietnam in quest of
 victory.
 George F. Kennan doubts that "the most
 formidable military successes" would bring
 victory if that term means the end of Viet-
 cong resistance and the realization of all our
 stated political aims.
 Gen. James M. Gavin warns that escala-
 tion could impair the capacity of the United
 States to meet more vital commitments else-
 where in the world at the same time that it
 created the risk of unlimited war on the
 mainland of Asia against Communist China.
 Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the
 evaluations by the former chief of the State
 Department's policy planning staff and the
 onetime chief of plans and operations for the
 Army-both delivered to the Senate Foreign   pendent and vigorous support was needed

 wise Americans have long warned  of  the
 perils of getting mired in land war on the
 Asian mainland; and in the nuclear era few
 things are more delusive in a major conflict
 than the goal of victory.
 If the Senate committee had heard only
 General Gavin and Mr. Kennan, its inquiry
 into American policy in Vietnam would have
 been worth while.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RODNEY M. LOVE
 OF OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, today I in-
 troduced a bill to amend section 4(c) of
 the Small Business Act.
 This bill would replace the present re-
 volving loan fund utilized by the Small
 Business Administration with three sepa-
 rate funds.  The first of these funds
 would finance the business loan program
 authorized by section 7(a) of the Small
 Business Act and the loan program
 established by the 1964 Economic Oppor-
 tunity Act.    The second fund would sup-
 port the disaster loan program, and the
 third would finance loans under the
 Small Business Investment Act of 1958,
 other than the lease guarantee functions.
 As you probably know, Mr. Speaker,
 since October 11 of last year, the Small
 Business Administration has not only
 failed to grant any further business
 loans, with a minor exception during the
 New York transit strike, but they have
 also refused to accept any applications
 for direct financial assistance, regardless
 of need.  The city of Dayton, Ohio,
 which is in my congressional district,
 made application for a small business
 development center but was turned down.
 I was told by the Small Business Admin-
 istration that these drastic steps are
 necessary because of drains on the pres-
 ent loan fund due to several natural
 disasters.
 I strongly feel that this emergency re-
 quires another supplemental appropria-
 tion as well as a change in the structure
 of the loan program itself.
 Congress created the Small Business

 values, and motivates them to do their

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. RYAN.  Mr. Speaker, New York
 Post Correspondent Pete Hamill, in his
 -fifth article in the series from. Vietnam
 observes:
 The hard truth of the situation in this
 country is that most of the peasantry (that
 is, most of the people) support the Vietcong.
 The guerrillas simply could not have grown
 so large without them.  And the Vietcong
 propagandists work hard at holding that
 support.
 I urge my colleagues to read the article
 published in the New York Post on Feb-
 ruary 11, which describes the political
 strength of the Vietcong.
 It follows:
 VIETNAM: THE ENDLESS WAR-ARTICLE V:
 THE POLITICS OF WAR
 (By Pete Hamill)
 SAIGON.-The most relentless 'adversary we
 face in the war in Vietnam is the mind of
 Vo Nguyen Giap.  This round-faced, 54-year-
 old lawyer is the only man to have won a war
 in Indochina in this century.  He attended
 no West Point, no St. Cyr.  "His school," a
 friend once said, "was the bush."  In that
 bitter school, Giap painfully, carefully, put
 together his theory of war.   He destroyed
 the French with the great Vietminh army
 he constructed.  And today in South Viet-
 nam his admirers in the Vietcong are using
 his theories to fight the mightiest military
 power on earth to a frustrating, expensive,
 and bloody standstill.
 The core of Giap's theory-derived from
 the writings of Mao Tse-tung-is that no
 modern revolution can be won unless the
 military arm is attached to a political body.
 If a concrete political base has been con-
 structed, Giap says, defeat is impossible.
 Giap himself is a Communist and much of
 his writing-which on military matters has
 a hard precision-is damaged by a kind of
 mindless  Marxism.  But  Giap,   and   the
 political commissars who roam the country-
 side preaching on behalf of the Vietcong, are
 not naive enough to believe they can sell
 something as abstract as communism.   They
 concentrate on more mundane matters.
 "They go into a village the way we should,"
 said one  American political  officer  in the
 Mekong Delta.  "They come in and search
 around and ask people about their gripes.
 When they find out what the people feel is
 unjust, they remedy the injustice.     If the
 hamlet chief is corrupt, they shoot him. If
 a landlord is charging exhorbitant rents, they
 kill him and burn down his house and make
 much ceremony of turning the land over to
 the peasants."
 These so-called armed propaganda teams
 are the vanguard of the Vietcong.  Following
 Giap's rules, they are like the rest of the
 Vietcong.  They never enter a house without
 asking permission.  They pay for everything
 they eat, and if there are food shortages, they
 go without.  When they have convinced the
 majority of people of their honesty, integrity,
 and sense of justice, the terror begins.
 Open dissenters are murdered.  Those sus-
 pected   of                                                                                                                                          being   lukewarm  disappear.
 Graphic examples are made: leaders are be-
 headed and their heads left to dry on poles
 in the sun.  Women are openly butchered.
 Those peasants who are not held by admira-
 tion for the Vietcong are held  by terror.
 Most are held by admiration.  And without
 those  people in  the countryside,  Giap's
 theories about revolutionary war could never
 succeed.
 "Without the support of the population,"
 Giap has written, "we shall have no informa-
 tion.                                                                                                                                         We shall be able neither to preserve
 secrecy,  nor  carry  out  rapid  movements
 * * * The people suggests stratagems and
 acts as guide.  It finds liaison officers, hides
 us, protects our activities, feeds us and tends
 our wounded."   (This is a variation, of
 course,   of Mao's theory   that  a  guerrilla
 should move among the people "like a fish
 through water.")

 ruary 9, to attend the charter year
 breakfast of the Boy Scouts of America,
 which was held at the International Inn
 in Washington, D.C.  Purpose of the
 meeting was Lo observe the 50th anniver-
 sary of the Federal charter granted by
 the 64th Congress to the Boy Scouts of
 America and to celebrate the 56th birth-
 day of the organization which was in-
 corporated February 8, 1910.
 IIon. HUBERT H. HUMPHREY, Vice Presi-
 dent of the United States, was sched-
 uled to deliver an address, but was un-
 able to be present because of a special
 Assignment by the President to repre-
 sent him at conferences in Vietnam.
 Congressman CLARENCE J. BROWN, JR.,
 of Ohio, who on that day was the newest
 Member of Congress to take office, was
 called by Gen. Bruce C. Clarke, retired,
 the master of ceremonies, to speak in-
 stead of the Vice President.  He gave a
 very fine speech which contained some
 significant facts about the involvement
 of Members of Congress in Scouting. His
 cogent remarks were as follows:
 ADDRESS  RY  HODI.  CLARENCE J. BROWN,  JR.,
 CONGRESSMAN FROM OHIO, AT TILE CHARTER
 YEAR    BREARSAST,    WASHINGTON,      D.C.,
 1''EBRUARY 9, 1966
 General      Clarke,  Mr.  Brunton,  Senator
 HAYDEN, report to the Nation Scouts, my col-
 leagues             in           Congress, fellow  Scouts    and
 Scouters, see how fast you can rise in the
 world in Washington.  Just a couple of days
 ago I was the youngest Member of Congress,
 or the newest Member of Congress, and now
 ram substituting for the vice President.
 As a tenderfoot in this distinguished body
 to which I belong, I was a little bit strained
 to know what I could say about scouting that
 would not already have been said by this
 time in this program and that some of my fel-
 low colleagues and those of you here did not
 know.  So I decided to lean on the newest
 device of people with problems, and that was
 research.  I  made  a  little  survey  of  the
 membership of the U.S. Congress to try to
 answer the question of what scouting has
 clone for the Congress in view of the fact that
 we would be discussing this morning what
 Congress had done for Scouting 50 years ago.
 I was surprised, as I think you will be.
 As a result of my effort to gather some
 statistics  on  Scouting  in  the  Congress  I
 found out that 249 of the 535 Members of the
 Congress of the United States today have
 been Scouts or Scouters.      Now. as a mem-
 ber of one of the minorities in this country-
 the Republican Party-that impressive total
 in Congress is very encouraging to me.  I
 know the Republicans would like to have
 that many Members in Congress.  I will tell
 you a little bit a about that later.
 Two hundred and one Members of Congress
 have been Boy Scouts.  One hundred and
 twenty-nine of them have been and  are,
 and many of them still are-and this is a
 message for those of you who tall. to people
 who say they are too busy.   Many of them
 are still Scout leaders. Eighty-one Members
 of Congress have been Scouts and are Scout
 leaders today, and 48 of them have been
 leaders only.  One hundred and twenty of
 them have been Scouts and have not con-
 tinued their Scouting as volunteer Scouters.
 One hundred and  thirty-four  of  the re-
 sponses I got indicated that they had been
 neither Scouts nor were they Scout leaders
 and I hasten to point out to you, as was
 pointed out to me on a couple of these sheets
 that I got back, they were not Scouts be-
 cause, in some instances, they were too old.
 In other words, Scouting was not available
 when they were growing up and in a number
 of instances they were not Scouts because
 in their area, geographically, or because they
 came frorn what now is being called disad-
 vantaged areas, there was no Scout troop.
 I trust that we will cure that in the next
 50 years as we have made great strides in
 curing it in the past 50 years.
 The reason  I could not get a total of
 535 responses is because there are, or were
 w:ien I took the survey, 3 vacancies In Con-
 gress and also because 12 of the seats in Con-
 gress are held  by women.   Two of these
 women, CATHERINE MAY, of Washington:, and
 FLORENCE DWYER, of New Jersey, ought to be
 in this survey, although I just couht not
 bring myself to include them becaus+ Mrs.
 MAY, last year became an honorary Boy Scout
 through a council in her district an?1 has
 confused her daughter, or at least mace her
 daughter something unusual in schoo:, be-
 cause she goes to school now and tells l eople
 that she has the only mother in the country
 who is a Boy Scout.  FLORENCE DwYER, of New
 Jersey, says that she was not a Boy Scout but
 she sure worked like the dickens being a
 den mother.
 To be a litl,,e more serious, I woulri like
 to give you just a moment of my backgr aund.
 I :moved to Washington with my predecessor
 in this seat in Congress when I was 12 years
 Old and soon after that joined Boy Scout
 Troop 5 at St. Alban's church, up ne:,r the
 Cathedral.  In that troop I became a senior
 patrol leader and an Eagle Scout, and later
 out in Ohio served as an. assistant scout-
 master and just this past summer have been
 involved in some work in Tecumseh C+?uncil
 in southwestern Ohio to encourage boys to
 respond to the motto, "Follow the Rigged
 Road."  I would not have been a Scout, how-
 ever, and I am sure I would not have been
 an Eagle Scout, and I am sure perhaps.. too,
 that I would not be here today as a M; mber
 of Congress if it were not for the male who
 made my Scout troop and my Scouting ex-
 perience possible, and he is here this me ruing
 and I would like for you to meet him.  He is
 John Bailas.  John, will you stand?
 John was my Scoutmaster and was fictive
 in Scouting in the National Capital Area
 Council and in troop 5 for about 35 years.
 He is retired from Scouting now to devote his
 full time to trying to make a living and to
 make   a cathedral.   He is curator  of the
 Washington National Cathedral up on the
 Bill.  To him and to the other Scout leaders
 and to the Boy Scouts who are here repre-
 senting the Scouts of the Nation, as a Mem-
 ber of Congress I would say that you have
 kept the trust; expressed in you sonic 50
 years  ago  by Senator  HAYDEN  and ethers
 very well.  Congress presented you a charter
 and perhaps in many respects, you have given
 us back a Congress.
 I would like to read for you the names of
 the Eagle Scouts in Congress and also to
 give  you the  names of some of the top
 Scouters in the U.S. Congress.  The liagles
 include Representatives  GEORGE F.  SENNER,

 Silver Beavers.
 Gentlemen, thank you very much for what
 you have done with your charter.
 Mr. Speaker, special guest of honor at
 the charter year breakfast was Senator
 CARL HAYDEN, of Arizona, President pro
 tempore of the Senate and only living
 Member of the 64th Congress which
 granted the charter to the Boy Scouts
 of America.  Chief Scout Executive J. A.
 Brunton, Jr., presented to Senator HAY-
 DEN a beatiful plaque containing a mosaic
 tile inlay of the original charter and a
 statement of "affection, esteem, and
 gratitude" for the great contributions
 Senator HAYDEN has made to scouting as
 a Member of Congress.      -
 Senator HAYDEN's response  was con-
 tained in a letter which he had prepared
 and framed for the occasion:
 Senator HAYDEN'S letter follows:
 FEBRUARY 9, 1966.
 To the Boy Scouts of America:
 Fifty years ago, a bill H.R. 755 was intro-
 duced in the 64th Congress of the United
 States.  The bill was passed by the House
 of Representatives on March 6, and the Sen-
 ate on May 31, 1916.  It was duly signed by
 the then Speaker of the House, Hon. Champ
 Clark, and by the Honorable John H. Bank-
 head, the President pro tempore of the Sen-
 ate.  The bill became law upon approval of
 President Woodrow Wilson on June 15, 1916.
 Section 3 of the act states:
 "The purpose of this corporation shall be
 to promote, through organization, and. co-
 operation with  other agencies, the ability
 of boys to  do things for themselves  and
 others, to train them in scoutcraft, and to
 teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance,
 and kindred virtues, using the methods which
 are now in common use by Boy Scouts."
 As a Member of the 89th Congress, who
 was also a Member of the 64th Congress, I
 greet and commend you, the members of the
 Boy Scouts of America and leaders of your
 95,000 local chartered institutions, on this
 1966 Boy Scout Week, which features and
 recognizes  the  golden  anniversary  of  the
 charter.
 The magnificent accomplishments of the
 Boy Scouts of America over the years, under
 the Federal charter have fully justified. the
 confidence of the Congress and the people
 of our Nation.  As a further evidence of na-
 tional appreciation several of my colleagues
 joined with me In introducing Senate Con-
 current Resolution S. 68, on January 14, 1966,
 which states in part:
 "Resolved by the Senate  (the House of
 Representatives concurring), That the Con-
 gress hereby pays tribute to the Boy Scouts
 of America on the occasion of the fiftieth
 anniversary of the granting by Act of Con-
 gress of the Charter of the Boy Scouts of
 America, and expresses its recognition of and
 appreciation for the public service performed
 by this organization through its contribu-
 tions to the lives of the Nation's youth."
 I have every  hope  that the Senate will
 adopt and the House of Representatives will
 concur in this resolution.
 The need for the Boy Scouts of America
 is as timely today as it was in 1916.  I would
 remind you that the purpose for which the
 charter was granted remains, and urge you to
 continue to pursue diligently your objectives
 to make Scouting available to all boys in
 every community throughout our beloved
 America.
 Yours very sincerely,
 CARL HAYDEN,
 U.S. Senator from Arizona.

 February 14, 1966      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 In South Vietnam, this first stage in the
 Giap theory has been working well for years.
 The hard truth of the situation in this coun-
 try is that most of the peasantry (that is,
 most of the people) support the Vietcong.
 The guerrillas simply could not have grown
 so large without them.  And the Vietcong
 propagandists work hard at holding that
 support.)
 In the province of Klan Hoa in the Mekong
 Delta, the Vietcong were telling the peasants
 that American Negro soldiers were really can-
 nibals from Africa, with a taste for small
 children.  They said that the armored per-
 sonnel carriers-a kind of roofed LST-eon-
 tained machinery which ground prisoners
 into gruel. In one small town I visited, Army
 engineers were building a fluoridated water
 system to replace the centuries-old practice
 of drinking river muck.  The Vietcong told
 the villagers that the fluoridated water was
 all an American plot-which should surprise
 some of the homefront commandos who have
 been shouting for years now that fluoridated
 water is all some kind of Communist plot.
 The more  serious-and more  effective-
 propaganda is that which attempts to make
 the  Americans  a  mere  extension  of  the
 French, and our involvement in this country
 just another kind of colonial war.
 "They tell the people that we're coming -
 to get the country back for the French,"
 one American AID representative told me.
 "They tell them that we will make them pay
 back rent, back taxes, fines.  And we have
 no way of saying that is not true.  With the
 present government in Saigon, it is true."
 The Americans are trying almost desper-
 ately to convince their Vietnamese allies here
 (the Vietcong call them "American valets")
 to really make an effort to enlist the people's
 support.  "But they're just not interested,"
 the AID representative told me.  "They build
 an `Open Arms' center for returning Viet-
 cong, and they leave it a filthy mess.  We've
 requested 17 times for the Saigon authorities
 to send us some small amenities: a type-
 writer, some tables, perhaps a phonograph.
 They don't even answer the letters. They
 fly over one day dropping tons of leaflets ex-
 plaining how glorious their government is,
 and the next day they send over defoliation
 teams to poison the crops.  It doesn't make
 any sense."  '
 When Giap stresses that guerrillas should
 be scrupulously honest in dealings with vil-
 lagers, it is because as a Vietnamese, he
 knows what a foul reputation soldiers have
 in his country.  The French troops would
 take food and women the way some people
 pluck  strawberries.   Today,  the  ARVN
 soldiers enter a town and proceed to plunder
 it for such paltry items as chickens, pottery,
 and water.  Gen. William C. Westmoreland
 is determined that American troops will not
 do such things and was even moved to pre-
 pare a leaflet explaining manners to the foot-
 soldiers.
 One of the unfortunate things we have
 going against us is our color.  It might be
 difficult to convince people that Marx, Engles,
 and Lenin are the keys to earthy salvation.
 It is not difficult to explain that the Vietcong
 are only fighting to get the foreigners out of
 the country.  For some of the more politi-
 cally conscious young men in Vietnam, it is
 as natural to join the Vietcong as it was
 for an Irish kid to join the IRA after 1916.
 Until last year this was not a crucial prob-
 lem.  But there are over 200,000 American
 soldiers here now, and more coming, and
 their presence is highly visible.  In Saigon
 alone there are 23,000 Americans and they
 dominate the face of the city.  I can't be-
 lieve that a Vietnamese youth will sing the
 praises of the Americans when any night of
 the week he can see GI's buying his women.
 Giap's work constantly repeats the need
 for  a well-defined enemy,  and  the Viet-
 namese  Government is  doing its beat to
 help him.  If the South Vietnamese were a
 revolutionary movement, instead of a group
 of spokesmen for personal interests, they
 would rob the Vietcong of their only rea-
 son for existence: revolution.
 "Why do the Communists have to have
 the patent on revolution?" that AID repre-
 sentative told me.  "Why is our country al-
 ways on the side of the antis:  the anti-
 Communists,  the      antirevolutionaries?  We
 seem to think that no revolution in this
 century can be non-Communist. And yet
 the great strength of the Vietcong, and of
 the old Vietminh, was the great masses of
 people who were stirred by nationalism and
 revolution.  Not by communism."
 In South Vietnam there was never much
 difficulty for the Vietcong in lining up the
 inhabitants of the countryside, specifically
 because all the necessary conditions for re-
 volt  were there.   Giap's political  base  is
 there, as hard, and stubborn as he could de-
 sire.  With that established, the Vietcong
 were free to act in more daring military
 fashion.
 Giap breaks down the revolutionary army
 into three classes, and defines  them this
 way: "The task of the regulars is to carry
 a war of movement over a wide theater of
 operation, in order to wipe out the enemy's
 main forces. The regional troops operate in
 their own localities and insure the coordina-
 tion of tasks between the regulars and the
 guerrillas.
 "The guerrillas defend their own villages,
 take a hand in production and join the
 regular and regional forces to prepare for
 and then engage in battle."
 The army never attacks until it is sure of
 victory.  When faced wtih overwhelming op-
 position, it flees to fight another day.  When
 the American troops pile into deserted vil-
 lages by the thousands,  the Vietcong are
 usually gone.  They are not fools.
 Giap's theory also calls for a three-phase
 war, with no time limits. The first phase in
 South Vietnam is over.  This is a defensive
 war, during which the population is split
 from  the  government,  the  roads  are  de-
 stroyed, and the enemy is isolated in large
 cities.   The second phase is swift, mobile
 guerrilla warfare, which forces the enemy
 to divide and disperse his forces.  The third
 phase is a general counteroffensive, destroy-
 ing the enemy's main units, as the Vietminh
 did to the French at Dienbienphu.  Most
 experts, American, French, and 'Vietnamese,
 say that the Vietcong are now in phase 2.
 It is Giap's belief that no democracy can
 fight the kind of long, brutal, frustrating
 war that the Vietcong are now waging.
 Giap knows that governments of democ-
 racies must answer to the people.  In a war
 like this, if it lasts long enough, someone will
 begin shouting about bringing the boys home
 for Christmas.  Someone will recognize that
 the war will mean endless casualties, loss of
 treasure, and a growing national disgust.  At
 that point, Giap is known to believe, the
 Americans will sue for peace.  This is why
 neither Hanoi nor the Vietcong are very in-
 terested in negotiations.  They think they
 can win.
 Giap is fortunate in that his admirers in
 the Vietcong have the perfect enemy to op-
 pose. ; That awful 20th century phrase-the
 minds and hearts of the people-is really
 what this war is about, and the Saigon au-
 thorities really don't care very much about
 them.
 But Giap, like most Communist theore-
 ticians, reminds one of poor Ivan Karamazov
 who loved humanity and hated people.  Giap
 was prepared, in the war against the French,
 to take as many casualties as were necessary.
 "Hundreds of thousands of men die every
 minute on the earth," he once wrote. "Even
 if they are Vietnamese, the deaths of a hun-
 dred, a thousand, or tens of thousands of
 men amount to very little."
 Th Vietcong believe the same, and there
 will be a lot of dead here in the next few
 years to underline it.

 Textile Industry Supports Clean Water
 Campaign
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. W. J. BRYAN DORN
 OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. DORN.  Mr. Speaker, the textile
 industry is playing a leading role in the
 campaign to clean up our rivers and
 streams.  Mr. Louis L. Jones, Jr., presi-
 dent of Canton Cotton Mills, Canton, Ga.,
 recently delivered an outstanding ad-
 dress to the National Technical Task
 Committee on Industrial Waste.
 I commend Mr. Jones' great and timely
 address to the attention of the Congress
 and to the people of the United States.
 WATER POLLUTION; CHALLENGE TO INDUSTRIAL
 LEADERSHIP
 We in the textile industry like to think
 that we started it all-the industrial revo-
 lution which swept first England and then
 this Nation.  We like to hark back to our
 early beginning during the infancy of the
 United States. In 1790, Samuel Slater built
 the first textile mill to use mechanical meth-
 ods successfully in Pawtucket, R.I.  The mill
 still stands, now a museum.  In 1793, Eli
 Whitney invented the cotton gin to make
 available for the  first  time an adequate
 Supply of cheap lint cotton for use in the
 mass production of yarns and fabrics.
 We of the textile industry like to think we
 have been a part of this Nation's progress
 and have kept pace with the needs of our
 country and our people.  We call attention
 to the fact that a Georgia textile mill wove
 the duck for the covered wagons of our pio-
 neer forefathers who pushed the Nation's
 frontier westward.  That same company to-
 day manufactures the material which houses
 the tracking stations for Telstar.  And the
 textile industry is a major contributor to the
 fabric of the space suits which protect our
 astronauts as they invade the vast new
 frontier of outer space.
 We in the textile industry like to think we
 have always played an active role in the
 challenge of the times from those earliest
 days of  our Nation's  beginnings to the
 present.
 During World War It the textile industry
 joined with many of our industrial brethren
 in a massive production effort which led ulti-
 mately to defeat of the Axis powers.  To this
 day those men we fought against insist that
 it was not military force alone which over-
 whelmed them, but the fantastic capacity of
 the United States to produce the materials
 of war and supporting equipment used by
 our forces and our Allies.
 It can be truly said that our great United
 States and its industries have walked hand
 in hand through peace and war.  The Na-
 tion could not exist without industry, even
 as industry could not exist without Govern-
 ment.
 It is difficult to imagine now how the first
 primitive industries, with their water-turned
 wheels, thrived in our young country.  What
 did they face?  What did they see-these
 hardy ancestors of ours who forged the path
 from the Atlantic to the Pacific?  If only our
 children today might see a little of the great
 natural beauty of our Nation as it was in
 those days.  If only we had been privileged to
 see it.  But along with industry and prog-
 ress came tragedy and waste.                                                                                                                       The forests
 were exploited and the land's topsoil treasury
 was 'washed down the rivers into the sea.
 The passenger pigeon was so ruthlessly slain
 for commercial use that the bird became ex-

 than 300 Survived by 1900.
 These are but examples of the tragedies
 that accompanied the civilizing of this great
 Nation-tragedies of wastefulness, thought-
 lessness, exploitation.  But today there is an
 even sadder story to tell, because the very
 air we breathe is now jeopardized.  Our once
 pure streams, rivers and national waters are
 a national disgrace. The pollution of our
 river basins and natural waters has reached
 such a serious stage that even an all-out
 effort now may not be enough to stem the
 tide of corruption with which 20th century
 man in the United States seems intent upon
 poisoning himself.
 3. famous philosopher once said, "No man
 steps into the same river twice."  Today's
 thinking  man  might  say judiciously, "In
 most of our rivers he would do better not to
 step at all."  Potent fumes which rise from
 some of our Nation's polluted rivers have
 peeled paint from the walls of nearby build-
 ings.                    The Public         Health  Service  has iso-
 lated live polio, infectious hepatitis and more
 than 30 other viruses which may carry dis-
 ease from treated sewage effluent.                          Because
 we  must  repeatedly reuse  our  water,  the
 chances are 4 out of 10 that the water we
 drink was flushed out of someone's household
 plumbing or out of an industrial plant sewer.
 National health experts tell us it is only
 because our water treatment plants are the
 best in the world that we have safe drinking
 water.  Because chlorine and other chemicals
 kill bacteria we can take "safe"  drinking
 water from some of the world's worst pol-
 luted streams.  It may not taste or smell
 good, but it is safe.
 However, the experts are now wondering
 how safe is safe.  Even with the chlorine
 cocktail treatment, there are foreign, some-
 times exotic substances which come into cur
 drinking  water  supply.  There  are  only
 traces, it Is true, but scientists are concerned
 about  their long-range  effect upon  man.
 Some of the complex wastes now entering
 our streams are  difficult or  impossible to
 detect in water.
 As the Nation grows and increases its de-
 mands upon industry and upon sewage sys-
 tems,                    the  pollution  problem  could  east:y
 outgrow ue:.  Our industries, which use some
 160 billion gallons of water each day. will
 be using more than twice that amount by
 1.980, according to present estimates. This
 moans that by 1980 industry will use 394
 billion gallons of water a day--two -thirds of
 the water used by the Nation.
 Although our problem is staggering, we
 know that pollution control can be achieved.
 In the densely populated, heavily industrial
 Ruhr Valley of Western Germany, pollution
 control is so effective that the river remains
 sale for swimming and recreation activities.
 tut wh;l is the outlook for our country
 and the terrible problem which faces us?
 Some trends are definite and inescapable.
 The public is alarmed.
 More and more the newspapers, television
 and radio stations around us are spreading
 the concern about pollution.    There have
 been national alarms over hepatitis-bearing
 oysters taken from sewage-polluted waters.
 Increasingly we see signs on beaches which
 say 'Unsafe for Swimming."  Fishermen and
 wildlife authorities from most States have
 angrily  denounced  fish  kills  and  caused
 widespread publicity about them.  The pub-
 lie outcry and concern about pollution rivals
 even civil rights and Vietnam news for top
 billing by the Nation's press.
 In  the our-up-or-shut-up category, New
 Yorkers  lead  the  national  parade,  having
 recently voted passage of a $1 billion bond
 issue to begin an earnest pollution cleanup
 in that State.
 The Federal Government Is in the pie-

 And soon. The time is long past for saying,  in its pristine form.
 "Let's wait and see how much we'll be made
 to do."  For industry and for growing cities
 which have too long put off treatment of
 their pollution problems, it is ,](ready late.
 In my home State of Georgia., the textile
 industry has pledged its support to the aims
 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Board.
 It is only a step in the right dir:'ction.  Es-
 timates have it that total indus; ry expendi-
 ture in  the State over the next  10                                                                                     years
 will cost. $100 million for waste control in-
 stallations and pilot treatment plaints.                                                                                         Com-
 munities and                                                                                     cities have an even       greater
 responsibility. Forty communities          with
 :300,000 people have  no  sewage      treatment
 at all.  One hundred Georgia towns and cities,
 among them Atlanta, must expand existing
 sewage treatment facilities to meet the needs
 of 1,300,000 people. The total costs of these
 city  and  community sewage  pm ojects     will
 amount co .more than $150 million.
 The Georgia textile industry's pledge "to
 obey the spirit as well as the letter of the
 State's water quality control law"  is not
 an idle one,  Nor is it a publicity seeking
 statement,  although  the  industry has re-
 ceived wide attention and acclaim for taking
 the  position.   Our  industry  leaders  have
 planned seminars to discuss some revolution-
 ary textile processing projects now underway
 at Georgia Tech.  These projects hold great
 promise for drastic reduction of waste eff-
 luents for some                                                                                    textile  plants.  Moreover,
 we feel that many of our indu trial mem-
 bers  can  profit  from  discussing                                                                                pollution
 cleanup problems which they face and which
 have already been met by others.    Above all,
 we hope to convince all our fellow members
 that pollution control is an obligation of the
 good corporate citizen.
 In 1960 our plant in Canton began oper-
 ation of it pollution control system which in-
 cluded sewage waste from part ; ,f the city.
 We hope to expand our system :;eon, taking
 in even more municipal waste, which, inci-
 dentally, augments our own waste control
 problem.  We hope that by taking the lead
 in solving a pollution control problem which
 became acute for our plant and for the city
 when a Federal dam was built downstream
 about 1950, we have provided a god example
 for the city to follow.  The city has now
 scheduled the building of a waste treatment
 plant which will cost half a million dollars
 and should adequately control all municipal
 wastes.
 Although l mention the efforts of the tex-
 tile industry to clean up pollution in Georgia,
 I would like to point out that the textile
 industries in North and South Carolina have
 made  significant  inroads  on  the  problem
 there.  A lot still must; be done in all our
 States. And while I speak for the textile
 industry. I know there are mam,? other in-
 dustries which have impressive waste con-
 trol programs underway.
 Finally,  I would hope that   l1  of us-
 brothers in industry--could join hands in
 leading the national water pollution fight.
 Let its begin by acknowledging our obliga-
 tion to pass on to others water that is as
 clean as the water we received       If those
 upstream are polluters, let us paes on water
 that is cleaner than the water we receive.
 Let its begin by conquering our own prob-
 lems in waste treatment.  Then let us lend
 support wherever it is needed-th fellow in-
 dustrialists, to our communities, to our Na-
 tion.  Let us put forth that concerted effort,
 the  unstinting,  unselfish effort,  of  which
 American Industry is capable.  Let us com-
 mit ourselves unfailingly as industry always
 does in time of crisis.
 HON. WILLIAM E. MINSHALL
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 10, 1966
 Mr. MINSHALL.  Mr. Speaker, those
 of us who, have been in Vietnam realize
 the magnitude of the job Gen. William
 C. Westmoreland is doing there.  He ex-
 emplifies the finest traditions of the U.S.
 military, serving his country with cour-
 age, skill, and devotion.
 I was most impressed by the Associated
 Press story Thomas Reedy wrote in yes-
 terday's Sunday Star.  In the event that
 it may have been missed by some of my
 colleagues, I have permission to insert
 it in the body of the RECORD:
 A TYPICAI, DAY IN THE LIFE OF  Gsnrem s7.
 WESTMORELAND
 (By Thomas A. Reedy)
 SAIGON.--The general used everything bat.
 a canoe, and he'd have used that too,  if
 necessary.
 Armed helicopters, a fixed--wing light air-
 plane, sedans, and jeeps and plain old-fash-
 ioned   footslogging   carried   the                                                                                                                                      general
 around part of his theater of command on
 one normal:, action-packed day.
 Matching strides with  Gen.  William   C.
 Westmoreland, the 51-year-old commander of
 U.S. forces in the Vietnam war, calls for a
 giant.. Pygmies need not apply.
 This day opened as usual with light calis-
 thenics and breakfast at 6:30 a.m., it quick
 check of reports, into combat fatigues, and
 the general was off to the teeming Tan Son
 Nhut Airbase for a look-see in the field.  By
 8 o'clock the blades of the armed helicopter
 were whirling, a gunner at each wide-open
 door in a frozen attitude of alert.
 PRISONER. OF CLOCK
 Aboard carne Westmoreland's aide, Ca 't.
 Tom Sherburne, of Pensacola, Fla., and the
 man who would stenograph whatever reports
 should be transmitted to the top charnels
 of the Military Assistance Command Vietaiarn.
 He was Capt. Ken Kleypas, of Hobbs, N. Mex.
 "I'm a captive of schedules," said the gen-
 eral, it lean. 6-footer with a lantern jaw, the
 energy of a, tank and the hands of a piauit i,
 "I've got to be a prisoner of the clock or I
 would never get my work done."
 The clock required landing at Phuoc Vin i-
 where the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division,
 was  deployed.   At  5  minutes  to  9,  ca]
 schedule, the helicopter sat down.  The. ,jeep
 convoy moved into the artillery perimeter,
 crews at attention behind their s:undbogc.
 Westmoreland fired questions at. the min
 who fire the guns and they fired back tare
 answers.  He seemed more interested in how
 they answered, their state of mind, th.u] in
 which words they were using.
 FAVORITE THEMES
 He  addressed the men by their names,
 here and there recognized soldiers who served
 with him  in Korea, asked sometimes their
 hometowns, how long they had been in it,(,
 field, or in the Army how they were feeling.

 By the time he got through with the outfit
 and headed in huge strides for the mess tent,
 he was able to say:
 "Sergeant, I congratulate you. The men
 say the chow is good and when they say that,
 it must be so. So I won't bother to inspect."
 Further into the woods the interrogation
 proceeded.  How was the road opening work
 going?  And then the general got on two of
 his favorite themes: What are the relation-
 ships with the South Vietnamese militia in
 the neighborhood, and what is the division
 doing in the way of civic actions-linking up
 to help the populace, cement friendship and
 with success and time be able to leave behind
 a lasting image?
 An officer said the milita's "popular force"
 in the sector was wary at first.  One man
 spoke only Vietnamese the first day and then
 on the second day spoke rather good English.
 His distrust had been broken down that
 quickly.
 Another dart toward the dispensary tent,
 a spit and span layout which won a compli-
 ment for Capt. Albert Maggioli of Buffalo,
 N.Y.  Westmoreland warned him to keep
 after the men's feet-the oldest advice in the
 infantry-and while he was on the subject
 turned to other officers and urged them to
 have plentiful supplies of socks.
 "In the monsoon season these men are
 going to have wet feet for many hours," West-
 moreland said.
 KNOW ABOUT FEET
 He knows about feet, at Kasserine Pass,
 the Remagen Bridge over the Rhine, and
 Korea.
 A quick glance at the watch and the sched-
 ule and the helicopter was off again for a
 40-minute ride to Xuan Loc and the 10th
 Army of the Republic of Vietnam Division.
 Gen. Lu Lan, smiling and courteous, along
 with his top American adviser, Col. Charles
 Reiderbaugh, of Carlisle, Pa., did the honors.
 With a pointer and a map, General Lan told
 of some considerable success at clearing the
 Vietcong out of the "rice bowl."  He said
 his division had secured the area with a
 population of 30,000 people loyal to the Gov-
 ernment.
 Westmoreland wanted to know something
 deeper: How do his troops get along with the
 countrymen?  What are they doing to raise
 the prestige of the village and hamlet chiefs
 and elders?
 At the time of Tet, the sacred lunar New
 Year holiday, did the people as well as the
 soldiers have all the food they needed for a
 happy celebration?
 Lu Lan beamed as though he was on cer-
 tain ground.
 "Yes, we had everything for Tet," he said,
 "And our men are getting along fine with
 the people.  I have three fundamental or-
 ders to the troops when they go into popu-
 lated places.                They are: First, smile; second,
 salute the people, and third, when you see a
 chance to help somebody clear up his place
 or trying to do a chore too big for him, help
 him."
 MAKING HISTORY
 The  American  commander  commended
 General Lan, knowing he was in fact making
 history. Armies in this part of the world
 have traditionally been overbearing, often
 cruel and the suffering populace has had
 little faith in the soldier.
 The inexorable clock beckoned and it was
 off again by chopper due south to the South
 China seacoast hamlet of Ham Tan.  It's
 a remote spot, Vietcong to the left, Vietcong
 to the right, Vietcong controlling the main
 highway whenever they choose to stop traffic
 and exact taxes.  They had just blown a
 bridge and it could be seen from the air.
 That bridge had been rebuilt by Lan's men
 five times.
 What would it take to control that high-
 way, the American commander inquired.
 The group of American advisers as well
 as the Vietnamese officers at Ham Tan broke
 into big smiles.  They knew the general was
 half serious, half jesting.  Colonel Reider-
 baugh said, "give me four or five choppers
 and when they start their tax collecting we
 can do them in, but this way we can't get
 there quickly enough."
 NEVER ENOUGH
 The colonel knew that asking for that
 many choppers was asking for the moon.
 The whole theater is so enormous there never
 seems  enough  to  go  around-the  plaint
 of the American soldier ever since Valley
 Forge.
 Westmoreland wished them all a happy
 Tet and then, addressing the province chief
 and the Vietnamese officer, told them he
 knew the past Year of the Snake was an
 unhappy one for them.
 "But this is the Year of the Horse," he
 declared.  "You know the horse is a strong
 animal.    He can gallop down the road and
 he can hurdle obstacles.  I am confident this
 horse will gallop and will hurdle these ob-
 stacles and we can proceed to success.  My
 country has reaffirmed our determination to
 stand behind you and help you bring peace
 to your land. I feel our American troops will
 be effective in your fight for your coun-
 try."
 "Never in all history have military men
 to two countries worked so closely together,"
 he said.  "We are making history.  And after
 we succeed in helping you win peace in your
 land, then and only then, shall we return to
 our homeland."
 It was after 1 o'clock and a brief hop to a
 forward air control field nearby enabled
 Westmoreland to chat with the pilots.  Then
 he shifted from the helicopter, thanked the
 crew and got aboard his four-seater Beech-
 craft.  It headed due north to Bao Loc, the
 capital of Lam Dong Province.  Out came
 sandwiches and cold tea for lunch, taken
 literally on the fly.
 BRIEFED IN ENGLISH
 The twin-engine craft sat down on the
 dirt strip on the tea plantation with a bounce
 which elicited from the general the dry com-
 ment: "Not much margin there."  And from
 his aide: "You've got to use every inch of
 this strip."
 Lt. Col. Ngo Nhu Bich, the province chief,
 and  his  American  military advisers  were
 ready with a limousine bearing four stars.
 The briefing by the chief, In excellent Eng-
 lish, was an uncomplaining recital of a pro-
 vince plagued with both the Vietcong and the
 North Vietnamese at times, and too little
 equipment for too big a job.
 Colonel Bich responded to the general's
 best wishes for Tet, saying:
 "Tet is the time of pardon, of friendship,
 and of gratitude.  Even the worst enemies
 (except Communists) are forgiven.
 "One year has passed, through bad and
 good days.  Some valiant soldiers have fallen,
 obscure heroes of freedom and democracy."
 MEETS FAMILY
 He referred to "we" in his message and then
 said: "This term includes, for sure, American
 pilots working day and night, American offi-
 cers and NCO's crisscrossing the jungle with
 their Vietnamese friends, American civilian
 officials performing their job with nothing
 else but a desire to help.   You are those
 valiant Americans.  May our foreign friends
 who share our difficulties and fight our own
 fight know that they are in a part of our
 heart."
 From there the group proceeded to the
 colonel's house where Westmoreland present-
 ed the colonel's wife with a spray of flowers
 and met the couple's seven children.
 The demanding timepiece intruded again.
 Westmoreland had to be back in Saigon to
 see Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge by 4 p.m.
 And it was already after 3 o'clock.
 The Beechcraft  took off and the  pilot
 really gunned it.  At Tan Son Nhut there was
 the usual stackup.   Four fighter-bombers
 were taking off.   Two big cargo and troop-
 carrier planes were arriving.                                                                                                                                      A half dozen
 helicopters  were  in the  stream.   On  the
 ground the general's plane taxied carefully
 among a swirl of propellers.      Westmoreland
 said goodbye before the wheels had stopped
 and leaped out to a waiting car and hurried
 off to his meeting with Lodge.
 HUMAN COMPUTER
 After the meeting with the Ambassador,
 Westmoreland visited his opposite numbers
 in the Vietnamese high command to wish
 them a happy New Year.
 This was pushing the day into the night.
 What was he doing that night:
 "I'm tired," said his aide, "but the general
 relieves me mostly of social functions.  He
 goes  generally  alone.   Then he  works at
 home."
 That's quite a day.
 It would be quite a day even for a mechan-
 ical computer which lacked all emotion.
 Come to think of it, the commanding gen-
 eral was doing a lot of computing for one
 human being in every one of the multiple
 roles he had played.

 Vietnam: The Endless War-Article VI
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 14, 1966
 Mr. RYAN.  Mr. Speaker, on February
 13, the New York Post published the last
 of six articles written from Saigon by Re-
 porter Pete Hamill.  The articles have
 been informative as well as provocative.
 Pete Hamill has realistically appraised
 the situation and in the final article dis-
 cusses the hard choices in Vietnam which
 confront us.
 The author says:
 The truth is that it is absurd to think of
 negotiating a solution to the war without
 making the Vietcong, and their political
 arm, the National Liberation Front, a party
 to the proceedings.  They made the revolu-
 tion-with the support of North Vietnam
 and China, to be sure-and they will have
 a say in how it ends,
 I urge my colleagues to read the follow-
 ing:
 VIETNAM:  THE  ENDLESS  WAR-ARTICLE  VI:
 THE CHINESE PUZZLE
 (By Pete Hamill)
 SAIGoN.-There is no way to discuss the bit-
 ter choices we face in Vietnam without con-
 sidering the size, power, history, and ambi-
 tions of China.
 China is there; It will not go away; and
 there has not been so much as a, single
 sentence from Peiping in the years since 1949
 to indicate that as a nation China is any-
 thing other than our enemy.  Its 700 mil-
 lion inhabitants are ruled by hardfisted old
 men whose language is violent and inflexible.
 With its fledging atomic weapons and huge
 land army, it stands unchallenged as the
 most powerful nation in Asia.  Its variety
 of communism is single minded and ruthless,
 and its history as a nation is one marked by
 repeated attempts at territorial expansion.
 "There is no doubt in my mind that you
 Americans are making a stand in Vietnam
 against China," one British military man
