 ?            VIETNAM WEEKLY REVIEW
 INTRODUCTION
 The pervasive Vietnamese communist demand. for a rapid and unconditional
 U.S. troop withdrawal is repeated by First Secretary Le"Duan in his
 speech at a "grand meeting" in Hanoi marking the 40th anniversary of
 the Vietnam Workers Party (3 February).  Reiterating that the Vietnamese
 "ardently aspire" to peace ir, independence and freedom, the First
 Secretary says:  "So long as the United States is still unwilling to
 bring home rapidly and unconditionally all its expeditionary troops,
 all of President Nixon's statements about peace are merely deceitful
 and are intended to mislead public opinion in the United States and
 the world."
 Le Duan does not mention  he Paris talks or speak of reaching a negotiated
 settlement of the current conflict.  Instead he prefaces the criticism
 of the President with a pa?ssage recalling that Ho Chi Minh's last ;gill
 and testament had declarer',, that the Vietnamese "must be resolved to
 fight against the U.S, aggressors until total victory."  In tracing the
 history of the Vietnamese resistance struggle Le Duan recalls that
 temporary accommodations were reached with the French and the Chinese
 Nationalists in the 1946 period, but it is impossible to determine
 frum the speech what his motives were or how these remarks may relate
 to future policy.
 Le Duan declares that the VWP, "acting upon the sacred testament of
 President Ho," continues to do its best to contribute to the
 restoration of "fraternal party" unity.  He adds that "we continue
 consolidating and strengthening the unshakable solidarity between us
 and the Soviet Union, China, and all the fraternal countries in the
 socialist camp."  Peking takes the occasion of the party anniversary
 to level an attack on Soviet Vietnam policy, couched in vitriolic
 terms last used in the Chir:ese leaders' message on the occasion of
 DRV National Day on 1 September, only days before Ho's death.  The
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the 3d says that the Soviet "renegade
 clique" has always colluded with U.S. Imperialism "in a vain attempt
 to undermine the Vietnamese people's war," and it adds that Brezhnev
 "and his ilk" are worse than Khrushchev in this regard.  Moscow's
 Radio Peace and Progress, in a broadcast in Mandarin on the same day,
 attacks the PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial as being full of "blatant anti-
 Soviet concoctions" about Soviet Vietnam policy.  It points out that
 the CCP Central Committee message on the VWP anniversary "dared not"
 repeat PEOPLE'S DAILY "lies" because the Vietnamese people would
 "not condone" such libel.

 Further high-level Vietnamese communist denunciation of U.S. policy
 is voiced by Le DucT o upon his arrival in Paris on the 30th to head
 the VWP delegation to the 19th French Communist Party Congress.*
 Reporting his, arrival, VNA on the 2d notes that he denounced the
 Nixon Administration for its "double-dealing trick" of paying lip
 service to peace while carrying out its Vietnamization plan aimed
 at prolonging'the war.  VNA says nothing about Le Duc Tho's
 position as a special adviser to the DRV delegation at the Paris
 talks when it reports that he called on the United States to
 immediately end its wax of "aggression" and seriously negotiate.
 (This is Le Duc Tho's first return to Paris since his departure
 in early July 1969.)  A brief Soviet report of his arrival in Moscow
 on 28 January does not indicate that he had discussions with
 Soviet leaders.**
 Criticism of President Nixon's remarks on Vietnam in his State of the
 Union message is sustained at the 52d session of the Paris talks on
 29 January, with both FRG Foreign Minister Mme. Binh and DRV delegate
 Ha Van ),au questioning his statement that the prospects for peace in
 Vietnam are greater today than they were a year ago.  Vietnamese
 communist propaganda on the President's 30 January press conference
 says he "again tried to intimidate the Vietnamese people."  And a
 NHAN DAN commentary on the 2d terms "deceitful" his comment that the
 U.S. goal is to end the war in Vietnam, preferably by negotiations as
 quickly as possible.
 The 28 January incident in which the DRV claims the downing of three
 U.S. planes prompts a flurry of propaganda including a DRV Foreign
 Ministry spokesman's protest and a commendation from President Ton Duc
 Thang.  The incident also got attention at the Paris session on
 29 January, and a NHAN DAN article on the 31st rebuts Ambassador Habib's
 statement that the reconnaissance flights a;'e in keeping with the
 understanding reached at the time of the November 1968 bombing halt.
 On 3 February the DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman issues another protest,
 charging that U.S. planes "repeatedly strafed a number of populous
 areas in Bo Trach district, Quang Binh Province" on 2 February.
 *   The last French CP congress in January 1967 was attended by a
 delegation led by member of the Central Committee Secretariat Nguyen
 Van Tran.  Le Duc Tho led a party delegation visiting France at the
 invitation of the French CP in August 1965 and has attended various
 East European party congresses in recent yearn.
 **  Tho normally has met with Kosygin on his trips through Moscow, but
 in November 1968 he was in Moscow for several days without being
 reported as meeting any leaders.  Consistent with past practice, there
 is no report that Le Duc Tho stopped over in Peking.

 It FEBRUARY 1970
 ?          Front media released a communique on a PRG Council of Ministers meeting,
 said to have been held in mid-January, which "reviewed all aspects" of
 the situation in 1969 and "worked out directives and tasks" for 1970.
 The communique doss not mention the Paris talks but does say that "the
 struggle" has been stepped up in response to the NFLSV's 10 points and
 the 12-point PRG program of action.  It adds that people in America
 and throughout the world are "struggling vigorously" against President
 Nixon's policy of prolonging the war through Vietnamizatior, and against
 his "peace hoax."  The communique says in standard fashion that
 because the Nixon Administration--far from withdrawing troops promptly
 and unconditionally--is seeking to draw out the wax in the' hope of
 consolidating the "puppets," the "people and armed forces" must
 further step up "their current general. offensive and widespread
 uprising."
 Both Hanoi and Front media continue to hail the four-day Tet cease-fire,
 which had been proclaimed on 5 January and will extend from 5 through
 8 February.  A Hanoi broadcast on 1 February recalls alleged allied
 violations of the Christmas cease-fire and calls on the people "to
 appropriately punish"any violations during Tat.  A Liberation Radio
 commentary on the 3d predictably disparages the GVN's announcement of
 a 24-hour cease-fire for Tet.
 PARis TALKS: 29 JANUARY SESSION
 At the 52d session of the Paris talks on 29 January both Mme. Binh and
 Ha Van Lau echoed earlier propaganda in questioning President Nixon's
 statement in his State of the Union message that prospects for peace
 are greater today than they were a year ago.  Mme. Binh called this
 view "entirely contrary to the truth," and Lau commented that peace
 prospects are in fact "more remote" now, at a time when the Nixon
 Administration is dowr;rading the importance of the talks so as to
 subsequently "sabotage" them.  The VNA account notes that Lau took
 issue with the President's statement that the major U.S. foreign policy
 goal is to end the war in Vietnam, saying that present U.S. policy in
 fact aims at prolonging the war.   Mme. Binh made the usual points in
 scoring Vietnamization and the alleged U.S. intent to prolong the war.
 She also introduced into the conference record another instance of a
 "mass slaughter of civilians."  This latest "atrocity," involving the
 "massacre" of 700 civilians, is said to have occurred in three districts
 of My Tho Province during December 1969.
 In the customary diatribe against the GVN, which she termed a "big
 obstacle" to a peaceful settlement, Mme. Binh noted that the! U.S. and
 Saigon delegates at the previous session had raised "in unison" the
 "so-called" free elections proposals which "we have long rejected."

 The PRG delegate again repeated the six-month troop withdrawal proposal,
 saying that once the United States accepts the principle of total and
 unconditional allied troop withdrawal from South Vietnam, "concrete"
 issues relating to this question may be discussed and settled in "a
 flexible and satisfactory way." She termed six manths an "adequate"
 time frame for the United States to withdraw its forces "without any
 technical obstacles."
 Both Mme. Binh and Ha Van Lau routinely urged the United States to
 respond "seriously" to the NFLSV 10-point solution.  Mme. Binh added
 that the Nixon Administration "must enter into serioin talks" with the
 PRG; she declared that the PRG, for its part, is ready "at any time"
 to talk directly with the United States on all issues related to
 ending the U.S. "aggressive" war.
 ALLIED SPEECHES     The VNA account says the U.S. and GVN delegates
 "rehashed" the idea of a mutual troop withdrawal
 which had "long been rejected" by the DRV and PRG delegates.  The
 allied delegates, VNA adds,  continued to evade the two fundamental
 problems"--an unconditional pullout of all U.S. troops and troops
 of "the other foreign countries of the U.S. camp" and the formation
 of a provisional coalit9on government in South Vietnam.  As for
 Ambassadors Habib's and Lam's statements, the VNA account says Habib
 repeated the "allegation that the United Statee would withdraw all
 its forces and replace them by South Vietnamesf: forces," while Lam
 also engaged in "ballyhoo about the readiness to release 62 North
 Vietnamese prisoners of war and renewed the proposal on elections
 advanced by Nguyen Van Thieu."
 XUAN THUY       On the 29th VNA reports a UPI interview on the 26th
 INTERVIEW       with DRV chief delegate Xuan Thuy, who continues to
 boycott the sessions.  In addition to drawing the
 usual contrast between U.S. "insincerity" and DRV-PRG "reasonableness"
 at the talks, Xuan Thuy is reported to have said that "for the moment"
 he intends to stay in Paris wid that a return to the conference sessions
 "depends on the attitude of the United States."  Thuy  repeated the
 charge that the Nixon Administration has downgraded the talks and that
 "in the present situation, I don't believe there can be such an
 eventuality" of holding a private meeting with Ambassador Habib.

 4 FEBRUARY 1970
 PRESIDENT NIXON'S 30 JANUARY PRESS CONFERENCE
 In reporting President Nixon's 30 January press conference, VNA and
 LPA on the 31st claim that he again tried to "intimidate" the
 Vietnamese people, representing the President as saying "we have the
 means and we will be prepared to use those means more strongly than
 we have dealt with the situation in the past, if the Vietnamese
 people step up their struggle against aggression."  A 2 February
 NHAN DAN commentary, carried the same day by Hanoi. radio and VNA,
 observes that the President made an "insolent threat--an argument
 of pirates."  The reports obscure the fact that President Nixon
 made his statement in assessing the possibility of a 1970 communist
 Tet offensive and that he referred to his 3 November statement in
 again reminding the other side not to put in jeopardy the remaining
 U.S. forces in South Vietnam at a time when the United States
 is withdrawing its forces and deescalating the fighting in Vietnam.
 The NHAN DAN commentary questions the President's statement that
 the U.S. goal is to end the war in Vietnam preferably by negotiations
 and as quickly as possible.  It terms this statement "deceitful,"
 and it goes on to accuse the United States of being stubborn at the
 Paris talks and of slighting their importance by refusing to officially
 designate a new chief U.S. negotiator to replace Ambassador Lodge and
 by proposing restricted sessions.  NHAN DAN also says President Nixon
 "tried to wage propaganda" for the Vietnamization plan and its
 implementation through the already announced troop reductions.  The
 paper typically terms both Vietnamization and the U.S. troop
 reductions "tricks," consisting of Administration talk of withdrawing
 large numbers of forces while only withdrawing small numbers, and of
 trying to cope with a protesting public opinion.
 NHAN DAN also notes that the President was asked about his hope to
 beat former Defense Secretary Clifford's timetable, asserting that
 President Nixon had said at his 19 June 1969 news conference that he
 would withdraw more forces by the end of the year than the 100,000
 Clifford had proposed.  According to NHAN DAN, the announced withdrawal
 of only 60,000 by the end of 1969 undermines the credibility of any
 of Mr. Nixon's statements on this matter.
 IlIOSCOW ON PRESIDENT'S STATEMENTS
 Limited Moscow comment on President Nixon's comments on Vietnam in his
 30 January press conference  asserts that he said "nothing new," merely
 repeating that the United States intends to continue Vietnamization.
 Commentators again complain that the President gave no date for the
 withdrawal of troops.  A broadcast in English to North America on
 2 February notes that he was asked if his promise to beat former

 Secretary Clifford's timetable for troop withdrawal was still valid,
 but goes on to say only that the President's reply was "disappointing"
 and does not elaborate.  There is no available Moscow acknowledgment
 of the President's warning that if the Vietnamese communists escalate
 the fighting the United States will deal with the situation "more
 strongly" than in the past.
 Other comment criticizes the President's comment, in his State of the
 Union message, that prospects for peace in Vietnem are better than they
 were a year ago, a statement Moscow had ignored in its initial reaction
 to the speech.  Some commentators, including Aleksey Leontyev in radio
 broadcasts and a TRUD International Review on 27 January, dispute the
 validity of the statement, pointing to the United States' unwillingness
 to withdraw its troops and its sabotage of the Paris talks as well as
 stepped-up fighting in the South.
 U. S. "ATTACKS" AGAINST DRV
 The 28 January incident in which U.S. aircraft were downed over the DRV
 has now prompted a spate of comment, including a 29 January DRV Foreign
 Ministry spokesman's protest.  The incident was reported promptly on
 the 28th when VNA claimed that the three downed planes brought the
 total to 3,331 and reported that the VPA High Command had issued a
 commendation for the feat.  The foreign ministry protest claims that
 U.S. aircraft attacked populated areas in the western parts of Quang
 Binh and Ha Tinh provinces and that three U.S. aircraft were shot down*
 and "many others" damaged.  The spokesman says the "new criminal acts"
 which followed alleged U.S. bombings on 13, 114, and 17 January "prove
 that the United States is continuing its acts of war" against the DRV,
 "brazenly" challenging public opinion.
 The downings prompt a message of commendation from President Ton Duc Thang
 on behalf of the VWP Central Committee and DRV Government on the 30th,
 according to Hanoi radio on the same day.  'A 29 January QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 editorial and a 31. January NHAN DAN article repeat the claim made in
 a 17 January war crimes communique that 12,000 reconnaissance sorties
 were flown over the DRV during the Nixon Administration's first year
 and that "more cynical still, they have sent fighter p7l.snes and even
 B-52's to bomb and strafe some areas in Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang
 Binh provinces and Vinh Linh area."  The papers charge that during
 the first 20 days of this year, U.S. planes have attacked Quang Binh
 and Vinh Linh on 19 occasions.  Both papers and a 1 February DRV War
 Crimes Commission "special communique" assert that the incident
 *  A statement issued by the Pentagon and the U.S. command in Saigon

 this area of the DRV.

 constituted a "new and very serious act of war" by the United States,
 and the papers add that it "fully exposed the stubborn and warlike
 nature" of the Nixon Administration.
 DISCUSSION     Ha Van Lau at the Paris talks on 29 January in "additiona.l
 AT PARIS       remarks" reported by VNA, said that the 28 January incident,
 occurring only a few days after President Nixon's boastful
 speech about prospects for peace in Vietnam, "once again lays bare his
 stubborn bellicosity and fallacious talk of peace."  A 31 January NHAN DAN
 article, as reported by VNA, charges that Ambassador Habib's remarks on
 the incident at the Paris session on the 29th "were nothing less than
 the arguments of a pirate."  The paper acknowledges most of the substance
 of Habib's remarks--to the effect that U.S. reconnaissance flights over
 the DRV were to insure the safety of allied troops in the South, that
 such flights were in keeping with the understanding reached at the time
 of the November 1968 bombing halt, and that the DRV must bear full
 responsibility for firing at U.S. planes.
 The NHAN DAN article calls Habib's remarks "cynical contentions which
 fully expose the bellicose and ugly nature" of the United States.  It
 ridicules the notion that the flights insure the safety of U.S.
 troops, and it rejects the right of the United States to violate
 DRV airspace without retaliatory action on the part of the DRV.  It
 goes on to declare that Habib's "allegation" that U.S. reconnaissance
 planes fly over the DRV in line with the understanding reached earlier
 is a "cynical and ridiculous contention."  The "special communique" also
 disparages the notion that the United States has the right to
 reconnoitre the DRV and "strafe the latter when its piratical aircraft
 are shot at," as well as the idea that the flights are in keeping with
 the November 1968 bombing halt agreement.
 NHAN DAN claims that the DRV "has time and again rejected the contention"
 that an agreement was made, insisting that the bombing halt was
 unconditional.  It charges that early in 1969 President Nixon "several
 times resorted to this contention" and that the "rehash of the
 contention is further evidence of the U.S. stubborn attitude and
 scheme to prolong the war."  It then says routinely that as long as
 U.S. planes violate DRV airspace, "well-deserved punishment will
 ~'e meted out."
 Another NHAN DAN article on the 31st--broadcast by Hanoi radio the
 same day--cites Western sources as saying that the United States
 originally denied the incident but, "after clear proof had been
 provided," admitted that it had lost "three aircraft" while "arrogantly"
 stating that it had the right to reconnoitre the DR`T and that escorting
 aircraft had orders to return fire when fired upon.

 VIETNAM WORKERS PARTY 40TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION
 First Secretary Le Duan's appearance in connection with the celebrations
 of the VWP's 40th anniversary and his address at the "grand meeting" in
 Hanoi mark his first public appearance since a 4 December visit to
 Hanoi work sites.  However, an absence from public view for that length
 of time is not unusual for Le Duan.  Prominent in the activities
 surrounding Ho's death, Le Duan had read the funeral oration and Ho's
 testament on 9 September.  He had also made some remarks on the
 important issue of party tasks and unity at a cadre conference in the
 An Thuy district of Haiphong, which Hanoi radio publicized on
 31 October.   (On 2 February Hanoi radio reports briefly that on the
 .,receding day Le Duan and Pham Van Dong, together with other party
 officials, "Joined 2,000 Hanoi youth in planting trees along the banks
 of the Red River," inaugurating the spring tree planting drive in Hanoi.)
 The account of the anniversary meeting lists all of the Politburo members
 as attending except Le Duc Tho--who is in Paris for the French party
 congress--and Pham Hung.  The latter's last reported presence in
 North Vietnam was at a reception on 29 September 1967 marking PRC
 National Day.  He was named as a member of Ho Chi Minh's funeral
 committee but was not reported as attending any of the commemorative
 functions.
 PARTY HISTORY     Although Le Duan expresses the usual sentiments about
 "peace in independence and freedom" and labels
 President Nixon's statements about peace "deceitful," he does not
 address himself to the issue of a negotiated settlement of the current
 conflict and does not mention the Paris -talks.  However, he does
 recall, in the course of his outline of the party's history, an
 instance of tactical flexibility and temporary accommodation with an
 enemy.

 Going back to the 1946 period, he notes that the party was faced with
 a dual threat from Nationalist Chinese forces and the French and that,
 in order to defend its gains, the party at one time advocated
 temporary reconciliation with the Chinese in order to cope with the
 French and at another time decided on *temporary reconciliation with the
 French in order to deal with the Chinese and "the reactionaries and
 their henchmen" and to "gain time to consolidate forces in preparation
 for the nationwide resistance against the French which our part;' believed
 to be inevitable."  He concludes this narrative by stating that "with
 an extremely clearsighted political line, maintaining firmness in
 principle and tactical flexibility, our party and President Ho skillfully
 steered the revolutionary boat out of the dangerous rapids, at first
 thought insurmountable."
 The book "Forty Years of Activity of the Party," released to mark the
 anniversary and published in NHAN DAN, describes this period in
 similar fashion though in much greater detail.*  It points out that
 the Central Committee decided at the end of 1945 to consider the
 French the main enemy and that the party advocated concessions to the
 Nationalists.  When the French and Chinese signed an agreement on
 29 February 1946, according to the history book, the party was faced
 with two alternatives:  take up arms to prevent the introduction of
 French troops into North Vietnam and fight all enemies at one time,
 or "negotiate with the French, taking advantage of the contradictions
 among the imperialist countries in order to push the Chiang army out
 of the country and fight for a moderate period of time to consolidate
 and develop revolutionary forces and make practical preparations for
 the nationwide resistance."  It states that the latter course was chosen
 and a preliminary agreement with the French signed on 6 March 1946 to
 establish the basin for negotiations, that discussions between the
 two parties began on 6 July 1946, and that Ho signed a modus vivendi
 with the French on 14 September.
 The signing of the preliminary agreement, according to the book, was a
 "correct and enlightened position of our party" which enabled the
 "revolution" to expel the Nationalists and focus the struggle on the
 French and to gain time to prepare for the long resistance.  Like
 ]:,e Duan, the book praises Ho for leading the people through this
 difficult period.
 *  In his report to the third party congress in September 1990,
 Le Duan did not mention the accommodations in his brief review of the
 party's struggle.

 4 FEBRUARY 1970
 Background:  The 1946 period was also treated at length in a summary of
 a party history publsihed in NHAN DAN in January 1965 on the occasion
 of the 35th party anniversary, although the maneuver of concessions first
 with the Chinese and then with the French was not so clearly spelled
 out and the alternatives facing the party in March 1946 were not stated.
 The accommodations with the French are not always mentioned in briefer
 reviews of the party's history and have been the target of controversy
 in the past:  In his reports to the second party congress in February
 1951, Ho stated that "mention should be made of the preliminary agreement
 of 6 March 1946 and the modus vivendi of 14 September 1946 because
 they were considered as ultrarightist and caused much grumbling.  But
 in the opinion of our comrades and compatriots in the South, they were
 correct."
 CURRENT        In discussing the situation in the DRV, Le Duan recalls
 SITUATION      the growth in such areas as agriculture, industry, education,
 and medicine from 1954 to 1964.  He admits that the people's
 material standard of living is still low and that they still have many
 difficulties.'  But he claims that everyone is basically cared for
 materially, and that only socialism could have brought abcut such
 achievements.  Declaring that these are only initial achievements, he
 urges the people to "carry out the immediate tasks with the highest and
 greatest results."
 Le Duan echoes recent comment on production in stating that an imperative
 task at present is to "mobilize and make good use of all labor forces"
 and increase eff'ciency.  Acknowledging that in many branches labor
 productivity is still low and manpower and material resources are being
 wasted, he repeats the view prevelant in DRV propaganda that it is
 necessary to improve organization and managerial work.  And he recalls
 that Ho's testament recommended that a good plan for economic and
 cultural development be formulated with a view to raising the people's
 living standard.
 In discussing the party, Le Duan points out that one of its responsibilities
 is to care for the life of the masses.  He stresses the importance of
 ensuring  the people's right to be collective master and in this coi:text
 states:  "we must resolutely punish the counterrevolutionaries and ;nose
 who breach the sccialist law or encroach on the interests of the people."
 *  Le Duan refers to  20,000,000  people in the North.  However, the
 ueual figure of 17,000,000 appears in other current propaganda,
 including the communique on the PRG Council of Ministers' January meeting.

 He states that in order to increase its militant strength and leadership
 the party must "unceasingly be consolidated and built up in force and
 size to the highest degree," and he adds that it must strengthen its
 theoretical understanding.  Predictably, he recalls Ho's words on the
 importance of unity within the party--"all comrades from the Central
 Committee down to the cell must preserve the unity and oneness of mind
 in the party."  According to Le Duan, the immediate task in building
 the party is "to concentrate efforts on the consolidation and
 strengthening of party cells and local party organizations."  He points
 to the need for party members to be dedicated, to mingle with the
 masses, and to be trained in ideology and virtue.
 ANNIVERSARY    VNA reports on 3 February that "all Hanoi dailies"
 EDITORIALS     carried editorials that day welcoming the party's 4,Oth
 anniversary.  The same item carries a brief version
 of the NHAN DAN editorial which indicates that it was routine in
 nature, stressing the leadership role of the party and the importance
 of unity in the party.  On 3 February Hanoi radio broadcasts that day's
 QUAN DOI KHAN DAN editorial, which quotes Le Duan's assertion that "the
 urgent task or the revolution" is to defeat the United States, liberate
 the South, prctect the North, and advance toward unifying the country.
 The editorial says the entire party, people, and armed forces are
 "determined to perseveringly step up the anti-U.S. national salvation
 resistance."  While noting that there are still many difficulties and
 hardships" to be overcome, it describes the present situation as "more
 favorable than ever."  But it asserts that "no matter what sacrifices and
 hardships we may have to endure and no matter how protracted and fierce
 our resistance may be, we remain determined to fulfill the glorious
 mission entrusted to us by history."
 Although the editorial makes no mention of the Paris talks or current
 negotiations, it does declare that th, party has always "closely combined
 political struggle with armed struggle and armed uprisings with the peo-ale's
 war . . . .  Our party also has brought into full play highly flexible
 forms of coordinated struggle--namely, legal and semilegal struggle and
 economic and diplomatic struggle."
 Declaring that the party's "political creativeness and thoroughness" have
 always been closely associated with its "ideological and organizational
 strength and firmness," the army paper says the party has "constantly
 formed a firm, stable bloc," maintained "solid unity," and upheld the
 principle of democratic centralism.  Eulogizing Ho's role in creating the
 party, it says that he "strenuously trained for our  party an outstanding,
 virtuou.3, and talented cadre corps. . . .  He built our party into a unified,
 firm solidarity bloc."  The party, he continues, is "more mature and
 stronger than ever.  Headed by its Central Executive Commit;~.'e--a collective
 of outstanding disciples and loyal comrades-in-arms of President Ho--our
 party possesses a numerous party-member and cadre corps which has been
 tested and has matured in struggle."  The editorial thus echoes comment at
 the time of Ho's death which stressed that he had nurtured a corps of
 cadres and which called on everyone to maintain party unity.

 PRG COUNCIL OF MINISTERS
 Front media on 29 January reveal that the Council of Ministers hold a
 mid-January meeting, presided over by PRG President Huynh Tan Phat, to
 review accomplishments for the past year and set out tasks for 1970.
 There is no list of other individuals present, although the communique
 on the meeting says that representatives of the advisory council* also
 attended.  In addition to the broadcast of the communique, which is
 dated 25 January, Liberation Radio later on the 29th also reports that
 the PRG Information and Culture Ministry held a press conference on the
 27th at which the communique was made public.   (The broadcast indicates
 that press organs represented included GIAI PRONG, LPA, QUAN GIAI PHONG,
 the Vietnam Alliance organ LIEN MINH, and the People's Revolutionary
 Party journal TIEN PHONG.)
 Aside from the initial Council of Ministers meeting at the time the PRG
 was established in June 1969, the only other meetings known to have been
 publicized were on 22-23 July (reported by LPA on 2 August when the
 communique was carried),** and 20-21 August.  The latter was reported by
 Liberation Radio on 14 November in a broadcast which said the meeting
 took the decision to make 6 June the official national day.
 The communique on the recent Council of Mi'aisters meeting echoes earlier
 year-end propaganda in claiming to have inflicted heavier casualties and
 material losses on the United States than in 1968.  And it says that it
 is obvious that "the plan to prolong the war through the Vietnamization
 program, far from creating a position of strength much desired by Nixon,
 has only cost the United States more blood and money. .  .   ."
 Outlining the tasks f,.)r 1970, the communique sage that the leadership
 of the revolutionary edminiet ration must be strengthened at all levels.
 And it says the council, decided to "enlarge and consolidate the system
 of the revolutionary administration" in order to further develop its
 function and insure the "people's democratic administration" as well as
 etepping up the social, educational, and medical tasks attributed to the
 revolutionary administration.  Militarily the council calls for frustration
 of pacification and Vietnamization schemes and announces the start of an
 amulation movement.
 *  It thus is not known whether Nguyen Huu Tho, who holds the post of
 chairman of the advisory council, attended.  Tho was not reported as
 being present at the 19 December meeting to celebrate the NFLSV anniversary.
 And his last reported appearance was on 22 November 19610 when he left
 Moscow after his tours which took him to Peking for Chinese National Day
 (1 October) and to Moscow for the October Revolution anniversary(? November).

 claiming that over 700 ARVN were wiped out, and that this proves the
 "gloomy prospects" of Vietnami,,ation in the delta.  The continued
 action in the highlands is mentioned in an LPA item on 1 February which
 says that 5,000 allied troops were wiped out in the area during the first
 two weeks in January, with U.S. Marines accounting for 600 of the casualties.
 A QUAN DOI NHAN DAN commentary of the 1st, broadcast that day by Fanoi
 radio, hails the downing of U.S. aircraft in 1970; no comprehensive
 statistics are cited.  The commentary says that air force firepower
 is being used to increase the efficiency of clear-and-hold, limit
 allied casualties, and prop up the ARVN through Vietnamization, but',that it
 is being dealt "heavy blows."  The people are urged to reinforce their
 anti-aircraft network.
 Action during January throughout the South is summarized by VNA in an
 item on the 3d which says that during "many battles" in the 20 days
 ending 22 January the PLAF put :iear7.y 7,000 allied troops out of action.
 VNA asserts that the PLAF "broke off" a number of relief and pacification
 operations by the allies in "several key theatres" such as the delta
 and highlands,
 "CRIMES" IN THE SOUTH

 Go Su, Quang Ngai Province, in October 1969.  As part of pacification,
 the allies are said to have raided several villages, killing many people
 and sending others to Go Su "concentration camp."  On 5 October, it
 charges, the Americans ordered Nguyen Hiep to poison those who demanded
 to be returned to their land, and within two da-s 197 had died.  When
 others in the camp demanded indemnification, claims the statement,
 the allies shelled and machinegunned 21 others.  Asserting that 300
 were massacred at Go Su, the statement calls mass massacre an allied
 policy as well as a means of achieving their plans.  It calls on the
 people to destroy "concentration camps" and crush pacification.  The

 MIDDLE  EAST
 MOSCOW CONTINUES TO EXPRESS HOPE FOR POLITICAL SETTLEMENT
 Soviet propaganda, while evincing concern over recent Israeli mi].Ltary
 operations, hews to the position that Arab-Israeli negotiations are
 unacceptable under conditions which would amount to Arab capitulation
 and that no aspect of the Middle East problem can be settled without
 Israeli withdrawal.  Moscow assails President Nixon's 25 January message
 to a conference of American Jewish leaders in Washington and his
 30 January press conference remarks'on the Middle East as evidence of
 U.S. intent to grant Israeli requests for more military assistance.
 Stressing the danger to peace of further such del..veries by Izrael's
 Western patrons, Moscow attributes increased Israeli "aggression" to
 U.S? determination to unseat "progressive" Arab regimes.  Soviet
 commentators continue to express the belief that a nonmilitary
 solution to the crisis can be achieved, based on the November 1967
 Security Council, resolution.  But Belyayev says in the 1 February
 PRAVDA that the USSR's support for a political solution does not mean
 tl:at it favors "appeasement at any price," and a Soviet spokesman in
 Cairo says there are "many aspects" to a political settlemat and
 pledges continued "active assistance" to the Arabs,
 In a speech at an international parliamentarians conference in Cairo,
 reported by TASS on the 3d, Soviet delegate V. Kudryavtsev says the
 USSR "firmly and consistently" comes out for the "speediest political
 settlement" of the conflict.  He adds that the struggle for such a
 solution "has many aspects; it has a great range of means and trends
 and includes the task of strengthening in every way the defense potential
 of Arab countries, above all the countries that fell victim to the
 aggression."  The Soviet Union, Kudryavtsev declares, has given "and
 will be giving active assistance and support" to the Arabs' struggle,
 and the struggle for a political settlement "also means giving every
 support to the just heroic struggle for freedom and independence waged
 by Arab patriots" on the occupied territories.  (Arab media have been
 reporting for two months the imminent departure of a Palestine Liberation
 Organization delegation to Moscow; now Cairo radio on the 3d says
 fedayeen circles in Beirut have announced that PLO chairman Yasir
 Arafat will head a delegation to Moscow "next week.")
 Since Kosygin pledged qualified support for the Palestinians in his
 10 December speech, when he said that "in conditions of continuing
 Israeli aggression" the Soviet "people" support the just struggle of
 the Palestinian organizations, the few propaganda references to such
 support have been in the context of activities by Soviet public
 organizations.  Thus TASS and Radio Moscow in Arabic in mid-December
 reported the Soviet delegation to a WPC meeting in Khartoum as declaring
 that Soviet public organizations decided to allocate necessary funds
 from the Soviet "defense of peace fund" to help the Palestinian Arabs'
 str,.iggle.

 4 FEBRUARY 1970
 U.S. POLICY     In the second half of January the U.S. proposals for a
 Middle East settlement drew diminished attention in
 Soviet propaganda.  Other than the Makoimov PRAVDA article on the 27th,*
 there have been only scattered critical references.       A domestic service
 commentary by Tysoovskiy on the 28th complained that the United States,
 in presenting separate proposals to the UAR and Jordan at the time when
 preparations were under way for the Arab summit conference in Rabat,
 "tried to create the impression that these documents were allegedly
 agreed upon with the Soviet Union" and that therefore a summit conference
 was unnecessary.  This "falsification," he said, was soon exposed by
 the Arab countries.
 Currently, the moot critical comment on U.S, policy appears in foreign-
 language commentaries by Tsoppi, one of the more prolific propagandists
 on the Middle East.  On 2 February he expresses concern over the "gr atly
 intensified and broadened scope" of the Israeli "armed provocations'  and
 declares that 4-he fate not only of the Middle East but of the whole world
 depends on whether a nonmilitary solution to the situation is possible.
 (In a 30 January commentary, Tsoppi had observed that a new war in the
 Middle East might also "embrace other regions of the world.")  He charges
 that "American meddling" in the conflict "on Israel's side" has entered
 a new phase in which the United States "now openly declares its political
 and military alliance with the aggressors."  Tsoppi asserts that President
 Nixon, in his 30 January press conference, "actually issued an ultimatum
 to the Arab countries" in saying that within 30 days the United States
 would examine and "satisfy" Israel's request for more arms.  This, he says,
 is an "open threat to the Arab countries," which must either capitr ate
 to Israel or face Israel's "offensive military potential increased
 several times over."  In a commentary on 28 January, Tsoppi characterized
 the President's message to the Jewish leaders' conference as a "declaration
 of the war" the United States has in fact long been waging against the
 Arab countries.
 THE USSR'S      The 2 February Tsoppi commentary says the USSR still holds
 PROPOSALS       that present tensions can be removed by nonmilitary means,
 and it points to the "realistic feasible proposals" made
 by the Soviet Union at the bilateral and four-power talks on the Middle
 East.  Tsoppi describes the Soviet plan as "comprehensive" and stresses
 the idea that Israeli withdrawal "could be tied with the termination of
 the war" between Israel and the Arabs.  In the only other propaganda
 * Discussed in the 28 January issue of the TRENDS.  Maksimov's article
 specifically identified various elements of the Soviet proposals for a
 Middle East settlement for the first time in Soviet mass propaganda.

 reference to the Soviet proposals since they were outlined in the
 27 January Maksimov article, Belyayev in the :. February PRAVDA,
 reiterating that the "real basic" for a political settlement is
 the November 1967 Security Council resolution, goes on to say that
 the Soviet proposals "are being favorably regarded" in many Arab
 countries and in those countries really interested in a peaceful
 solution.
 Moscow does not acknowledges the Kosygin notes to the United States
 on the 31st and to Britain and France on the 2d, but the MIDDLE EAST
 NEWS AGENCY (MENA) on the 4th cites the Cairo AL-AHRAM as saying that
 Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov gave Nasir a copy of the message.  On
 the 3d DENA reports "relirble informed sources" in London as saying
 that the notes., "drafted in extremely strong terms bordering on an
 ultimatum," warned that unless the four powers take serious, effective,
 coordinated action to end Israeli "aggression," the Soviet Union "will
 find it necessary to take unilateral action on'its'own respondibility
 to end the aggression."
 ARMS ISSUE     Soviet propaganda currently contains several references
 to Soviet assistance to the Arabs for strengthening their
 "defense capacity," ranging from assurances that such support will
 continue to reiteration of the rationale advanced by Kosygin in his
 July 1968 Stockholm press conference--that arms to the "victims of the
 aggression" are "Just" deliveries, whereas arming Israel means arming
 the "aggressor."  A Tsoppi foreign-language commentary on the 28th
 maintains defensively that the Arab countries would not have needed to
 strengthen their "defensive capacity," nor would the Soviet Union have
 needed "to help the Arab countries with its armaments," had it not been
 for the June 1967 "aggression" and "threats of -a-repetition at the
 present time," and had Israel and "imperialism" riot blocked implementation
 of the November 1967 Security Council resolution and "torpedoed" a
 negotiated settlement.
 A TRUD article or. 3 February, referring to President Nixon's press conference
 statement that a decision on Israel's ta,.'ms request would be adopted in
 the next 30 days, claims that the President, "trying to justify military
 support for the aggressor," emphasized that the United States "allegedly
 is only trying to 'preserve the balance of power'" in the Middle East.
 Belyayev's 1 February PRAVDA article says that the United States, viewing
 the French decision to sell Mirage fighters to Libya, as upsetting the
 military balance in the region, "considers itself to be free of any
 restrictions" in supporting Israel.  France's decision to maintain its
 arms embargo in the Middle East is welcomed in a 30 January PRAVDA
 article by Yermakov, who observes that pressure on France to change its
 "independent" Middle East policy proved unsuccessful but warns that further

 such attempts should be expected.  TASS on 31 January, reporting the
 President's press conference, notes that he expressed concern over the
 French decision to deliver military aircraft to Libya and announced his
 intention to discuss U.S.-French differences on Middle East policy
 during President Pompidou'a forthcoming visit to Washington.
 Soviet media have made no reference to an arms embargo in the Middle
 East since 1 December, when an Arabic-language commentary recalled
 the statement In Gromyko's 20 September UNGA address that the Soviet
 Government had told the U.S. Government that discussion of such a
 question could be of no use whine Israeli troops are occupying Arab
 territory.
 USSR SAYS ARABS "EFFECTIVELY" COUNTERING ISRAELI ATTACKS
 For both foreign and domestic audiences, Soviet media continue to report
 Israeli raids on internal UAR targets and "densely populated regions" in
 pursuit of military, political, and psychological aims, as well as
 Israeli actions against Syria and Jordan.  Moscow propaganda depicts
 the Egyptians as retaliating successfully on Israeli positions along
 the Suez Canal and in Sinai; it insists that civilian casualti3s in the
 UAR have not only failed to achieve the Israeli objective of "shaking
 President Nasir's image," but on the contrary have helped consolidate
 the Egyptian people's unity.
 Beyond the routine claims of growing Arab "rebuffs" to Israel'that have
 been appearing in the propaganda for some months, there are now
 reminders to the Israelis that the Arabs may respond in kind:  A domestic
 service commentary by Ryzhikov on the 3d says the Syrian flight over
 Haifa "showed all those who needed to be shown that Israel has no deep
 rearguard that is  .naccessib:..e for retaliatory bombing raids."  And
 the domestic service on the 4th airs Cairo correspondent Rassadin's
 observation that Israeli. aircraft have "started to bomb civilian
 objectives in the UAR mrre frequently, forgetting how vulnerable Israeli
 towns are."  In the present circumstances, Rassadin says, it would be
 ridiculous to expect the Arabs to sit with folded arms; relying on
 "the help of their friends, they are strengthening their armed forces"
 and making effective counterattacks.  Glukhov claims in PRAVDA on
 1 February that "the element of surprise, on which the Israeli
 militarists were gambling, has disappeared."  He asserts that the
 overflight of Haifa and Egyptian air strikes in Sinai "have shown
 that the Israeli positions are vulnerable and aggressive actions do
 not go unpunished."

 A 30 January RED STAR article, broadcast to Arab audiences, is specific
 about Israeli military targets--Egyptian "air defense means," such as
 launching positions of ground-to-air missiles, radar installations, and
 antiaircraft artillery positions--as well as "deep" Egyptian targets.
 Among other objectives, RED STAR says, the raids are aimed at warning
 Cairo that the "whole Egyptian military system is a potential target for
 bombing."
 CHOU MESSAGE TO NASIR PLEDGES PRC SUPPORT FOR ARABS
 A Chou En-lai message of support to Nasir, carried by NCNA on 2 February,
 is the first such official Chinese pledge of support for the Arabs to
 be publicized in PRC media since the June 1967 war.  NCNA reports that
 Chou received the UAR ambassador on the 2d and during a "cordial and
 friendly talk" handed him a letter for Nasir expressing the Chinese
 people's concern for the Arab struggle and pledging to remain "the most
 reliable friend" of the people of the UAR, "Palestine, and other Arab
 countries."
 Chou's message takes note of the recent "fresh series of military attacks"
 on the UAR and other Arab countries by Israel, citing the 22 January
 action on Shadwan Island and adding that on 25 January President Nixon
 'openly declared that the United States would supply more arms to Israel
 to fight the Arabs."  The message calls the Arab struggle part of the
 worldwide anti-imperialist struggle and expresses the conviction that'
 the Arabs, through arduous and "protracted struggle," will defeat the
 "U.S. and Israeli aggressors."
 Chou does not use the occasion to assail the Soviet "social imperialists"
 for colluding with "U.S. imperialism" to suppress the Palestinian armed
 struggle; the last such attack had appeared in a 7 January PEOPLE'S
 DAILY commentary reviewing the "brilliant successes" of the Palestinian
 guerrillas over the past year.  Peking has continued routinely to
 report Palestinian communiques on fedayeen operations and to depict
 the Palestinians as inspired by Mao's teachings on armed struggle.
 NCNA on 26 December, reporting the closing of the Arab summit conference
 in Rabat, had cited PLO chairman krafat as declaring that China stands
 firmly with the Palestinian people and that "our relations with China
 are being strengthened day by day."
 Following up the Chou message, an NCNA commentary on it February levels
 a vituperative attack at the U.S. Administration, and President Nixon
 personally, for "backing Israel in its aggression" while  "hypocritically"
 declaring that the United States has counseled restraint on both sides.
 "It is Nixon"--a "hangman whose hands are stained with tb^ blood of the
 Arab people"--who instigated Israel to launch its recent "barbarous"

 attacks, says NCNA, and it is he who has equipped the Israeli forces
 and "has sent military personnel to join Israel in massacring the
 Arab people."
 BACKGROUND     Peking has issued no formal statements on the Middle
 East since the period surrounding the June 1967 war,
 which was marked with PRC Government  statements of 27 May rand 6 June.
 Also on 6 June 1967, Chou offered "firm support" to the Arab cause in
 messages to Nasir, Syrian President al.?Atasi, and the then PLO chairman
 ash-?Shugayri. Support pledges were also made in the two government:
 statements, the second going somewhat beyond the first in declaring
 vaguely that the Chinese people "will not allow tre U.S. imperialists
 and their collaborators to ride roughshod and commit aggression
 everywhere. "
 There is no indication from either Cairo or Peking media that Chou
 sent Nasir a message in 1967 on the UAR's 23 July revolution
 anniversary.  MENA--but not Peking sources--reported such a message
 on the 1968 anniversary in which Chou reaffirmed the Chinese people's
 "full support" for the UAR people's "Just struggle against imperialism
 and neocolonialism" and their wish for Arab victory in the struggle
 against "the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel."
 Again in 1969, MENA was the only source to report anniversary
 congratulations to Nasir in which Chou declared that the Chinese
 people "strongly support" the people of the UAR, the Palestinian
 people, and the rest of the Arab peoples in their struggle against
 "U.S. imperialism and Zionism."
 MOSCOW ON      Soviet propaganda has virtually ignored Peking's
 PRC STANCE     Middle East policies since the early fall of 1969.
 In September there were complain%j that Peking was
 trying to drive a wedge between the Arab countries and split the
 "liberation movement."  And in July and August Moscow accused Peking
 of trying to sabotage a political settlement in the Middle East and of
 "hampering Soviet efforts in this connection."  A panelist in the
 Moscow domestic service commente.tors' roundtable on 20 July acknowledged
 Chinese charges of Soviet-American collusion in "hatching a Munich
 agreement for the Middle East" and in preparing some kind of deal
 behind the backs of the Arabs.  The panelist went on to underline--
 as did a Moscow broadcast in Arabic in late August--the importance of
 Soviet military and political assistance in "stopping the Israeli
 aggressors" and maintaining the "progressive" Arab regimes.

 Broadcasts in Turkish and Persian in August also warned of the dangers
 of Peking's Middle East policy.      A broadcast for Turkish listeners on
 12 August, claiming that Peking has callAci on the Arabs to sacrifice
 10 million people to achieve victory, warned that other countries,
 including Turkey, would be harmed by a "huge war which Peking wishes
 to incite in the Middle East."     The broadcast recalled that in 1965,
 when receiving an Arab delegation, Mao had "indicated that he
 considered the Middle East an advanced bastion for the establishment
 of Chinese hegemony in Asia" and that Peking had "established
 contact with certain adventure-seeking politicians" such as former
 PLO head ash-Shugayri.  Similarly, the Persian-language broadcast on
 25 August aioerted that in order to implement their adventurist policy,
 the Chinepa leaders "are prepared to see the total destruction of the
 populatitais" of such countries as Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.

 STRATEGIC  ARMS
 MOSCOW CONTINUES ATTACKS ON ABMISo SOFfPEDALS SALT ISSUES
 Soviet propaganda sustains its low-key campaign against Administration
 plans for proceeding with deployment of the Safeguard system, citing
 ABM deployment as one of the items in a "huge" defense budget which
 contributes to the inflationary spiral in the United States and the
 cutback in needed social programs.  At the same time, Soviet commentators
 continue to warn of the broader consequences of going forward with
 Safeguard.
 A foreign-language corr_nentary by Shakhov on 2 February, pegged to
 President Nixon's 30 January press conference remarks on plans for
 the first and second phases of the system, says deployment "will be a
 stimulus for another round of the arms race, will lead to an
 exacerbation of international tension, and will enhance the dangers
 to world peace."  (A brief 31 January domestic service report of the
 press conference had noted. the President stated that the Administration
 has decided to proceed with Safeguard; the report added that, "in
 other words, Washington will carry the aims race, which is the main
 reason for the serious difficulties in the U.S. economy, even further.")
 The Shakhov commentary goes on to note that while ABM's could be used
 in the United States as a protection for ICBM pads, their use in
 Vietnam or the Middle East would make them offensive weapons.  "Thus
 behind the smokescreen of the Safeguard. program the manufacture of
 short- and medium-range nuclear missiles will be carried out rapidly,"
 Sha.khov concludes.  The Shakhov commentary does not mention possible
 consequences of ABM deployment for disarmament, but IZVESTIYA's
 Matveyev, in an article in that paper the day before the President's
 press conference, described the outcome of the U.S. domestic "struggle"
 over Safeguard as important "for prospects in the field of disarmament."
 Matveyev did not mention the strategic arms limitation talks (SALT),
 scheduled to resume in Vienna on 16 April.
 A 4 February TASS dispatch reports without comment Senator Mansfield's
 observation that the deployment of Safeguard "may have a negative
 effect" on SALT.  The item further reports that Senator Gore has
 voiced concern that the building of the Safeguard system as well as the
 stepped-up production of multiple independently targeted reentry
 vehicles (MIRV) "hardly contribute to limiting the strategic arms race."

 While the mass propaganda currently devotes minimal attention to SALT,
 an article in the first issue of the new Soviet journal, THE USA--
 ECONOMICS, POLITICS, AND IDEOLOGY, treats the negotiations at some
 length.  As summarized by TABS on 3 Februa.y, the article contrasts
 the U.S. and Soviet approaches to disarmament questions, stressing
 that the opposition of the military-industrial complex and the
 traditions of a "policy of strength" are obstacles in the way of
 strategic arms limitation.  It says that the outcome of the negotiations
 depends not only on the bilateral discussions at the conference hall,
 but also "on the struggle among supporters and adversaries" of an
 agreement in the United States in the period between Helsinki and
 Vienna.  According to TASS, the journal notes editorially that the
 article went to press before Defense Secretary Laird made "statements
 in which he demanded allocations for now systems of weapons under the
 pretext of a'Boviet menace.'  These statements show again how well
 grounded are the doubts about the position of the United States" on
 strategic arms limitation, it adds.

 PEKING COMvIENT ON STATE OF UNION ADDRESS AVOIDS ISSUES
 In Peking's first, belated reaction to President Nixon's 22 January
 State of the Union address, an NCNA commentary dated 31 January
 portrays the speech as a confession that the United States faces
 a "terrible mess" at home and abroad and that it is "fast declining"
 as a world power, though it will not relinquish its "aggressive
 undertakings."  NCNA ignores the President's remarks on Vietnam and
 Stno-U,S. relations, while stressing the role of Japan in the
 Administration's "aggressive schemes" in Asia and taking note of
 the President's expressed hope for a new relationship between the
 Soviet Union and the United States.
 Peking's care in keeping the record open on key Sino-U.S. issues,
 at a time when the Warsaw talks have been renewed, is similar to
 its approach at the time of the presidential inauguration last
 year.  It was not until after cancellation of the scheduled Warsaw
 meeting last February that Peking began to define an intransigent
 position on such issues.  As for the Soviet-U.S. relationship--a
 major theme in comment last year on the inauguration--Chinese
 suspicion is again in evidence in the NCNA commentary's claim that
 the President is determined to pursue the ambitions of the United
 States and the Soviet Union to "dominate and divide" the world.
 In taking care now not to foreclose its options toward the United
 States, Peking may be seeking to acquire leverage in the evolving
 triangular relationship among the three powers.
 NCNA's treatment of the President's discussion of the Guam doctrine
 reflects Peking's recent preoccupation with Japan's role as a U.S.
 "tool for suppressing and enslaving the Asian peoples."  Citing the
 President's remarks on Japanese-American cooperation as the linchpin
 for peace in the Pacific, the commentary calls fcr "the greatest
 vigilance" of the Asian peoples against this development.
 While ignored in the NCNA commentary on the State of the Union
 address, the Vietnam and Sino-U.S. questions have been kept alive
 in Peking media.  In addition to comment pegged to the Vietnam
 Workers Party anniversary, an NCNA dispatch on 3 February summarized
 a commentary on the President's speech by Hanoi's N}IAN DAN which
 addressed itself to his remarks on Vietnam.  There has also been
 another reminder of the Taiwan question, with NCNA on 2 February
 carrying a report on oppression of peasants on Taiwan and on the
 spreading "flames of resistance" against "the U.S.-Chiang gang."
 NCNA has carried three reports of this sort since 20 January.
 Peking has not reported the President's 30 January press conference in
 which he announced a new phase in ABM construction to guard against a
 PRC nuclear capability.

 SING-SOVIET  RELATIONS
 PEKING ASSAILS SOVIET LEADERS AS MOSCOW POLEMICS ABATE
 While Soviet comment on China has leveled off to a low volume of
 routine sniping at Peking's policies, the Chinese have broken
 their recent silence on Soviet affairs by rai.:ing two sensitive
 issues and making sharp attacks on the Soviet leadership, including
 personal slaps at Brezhnev.  Bilateral relations have been largely
 ignored, though the Soviet weekly LIFE ABROAD (No. 5, not yet
 available but summarized by TANYUG on 31 January) accused the PRC
 of heightening tension along the border while renewing contacts
 with the United States in Warsaw.  The Soviet stand on the conflict
 was approved by an AUCCTU plenum resolution which, according to TRUD
 on 29 January, declared Moscow's policy to be a combination of efforts
 to restore links with the PRC and "a firm rebuff to all possible
 provocations"--a formulation similar to the line taken by Moscow before
 the Peking talks.
 PEKING     In the past week Peking has launched provocative attacks
 on Soviet policies in the sensitive matters of Czechoslovakia
 and Vietnam--cen-iyst 4,iR>ca'in past Chinese polemical campaigns against
 Moscow.  An NCNA report on 30 January, pegged to the first anniversary
 of a Czechoslovak student's self-immolation in protest against the
 Soviet invasion, plays up signs of resistance to "the Soviet revisionist
 new tsars" and echoes Peking's New Year's Day joint editorial--which
 proved highly offensive to the Soviets--in attacking Brezhnev by name.
 While reproaching "the Czechoslovak revisionist clique" for its repressive
 policies, the report emphasizes that it is Moscow which is pulling the
 strings.
 A blistering attack on the Soviet leadership is contained in a 3 February
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the 40th anniversary of the Vietnam Workers
 Party.  Reviving the charge of a Soviet sellout of the Vietnamese
 communists, the editorial charges that "Brezhnev and his ilk," even more
 than Khrushchev, have sought to make deals with the United States in
 order to betray the Vietnamese revolution.  This attack flies in the
 face of Hanoi's renewed appeal, in Le Duan's keynote anniversary speech,
 for a restoration of unity in the communist movement--the plea contained
 in Ho's testament and played up by Moscow.
 MOSCOW     Soviet coverage of China     all but disappeared from the
 Moscow daily press, while the weeklies continue to address
 themselves to the Chinese war preparations campaign.  In the only article
 in the d??^lly press devoted to China in the past week, IZVESTIYA on
 29 January cited a U.S. correspondent's report on the PRO's purchase
 and stockpiling of materials which "would be vitally essential in the

 event of a big war."  A theoretical article in RED STAR on the same
 day took a passing shot at "Maoist propaganda" as being "permeated
 with hatred" frrr the Soviets,
 The weekly LITERARY GAZETTE No. 5 (28 January) and the aforementioned
 Issue of LIFE ABROAD both take note of the Chinese war preparations
 and link Peking's anti-Soviet activities with the Sino-11.S. talks in
 Wars;. r.  In the same p:riod, NEW TIMES No. 5 carried an abridged
 version of a 23 January article in the Hungarian NEPSZABADSAG which
 raised the possibility of another anti-Soviet provocation by the
 Chinese.
 In its broadcasts beamed to China, Moscow continues to level scattershot
 attacks on Peking's domestic and foreign policies.  A Mandarin commentary
 over Radio Peace and Progress on 3 February promptly takes exception to
 the PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial of that day for spreading "blatant anti-
 Soviet concoctions" that Moscow is sabotaging the Vietnamese cause.
 After defending the Soviet role in the Vietnam conflict, the commentary
 observes that the Chinese did not include the anti-Soviet charges in
 their message to the North Vietnamese on the anniversary.
 Other broadcasts in Mandarin accuse the Peking leaders of colluding with
 imperialists by meeting with the United States in Warsaw and by purchasing
 war-related materials from the firms of capitalist countries.  A broadcast
 on 27 January points to the "coincidence" of the resumption of the Warsaw
 talks with anti-Soviet attacks in the Chinese press.  Indirectly, quoting
 the 23 January NEPSZABADSAG article, this broadcast acknowledges for the
 first time in monitored Soviet media the fact that Peking's anti-Soviet
 activity subsided for a time after the 11 September Kosygin-Chou meeting.
 The commentary also contains one of Moscow's infrequent mentions of the
 1969 border incidents, citing NEPSZABADSAG for a report that propaganda
 films on those incidents are again being shown in Chinese theaters.
 The broadcasts to China again decry allegations about a Soviet threat.
 But Chinese listeners are implicitly reminded of Soviet nuclear prowess
 in a commentary on 2 February ostensibly justifying Soviet disarmament
 policies.  The commentary denounces "madmen" who, "sh'wing off their
 nuclear strength" and "fanning up war psychosis," are ignoring the
 devastating effects of nuclear weapons which "are capable of wiping out
 the distinction between the front and the rear and of turning broad
 areas of the earth into barren lands within a few hours."
 Taking issue with Peking's polemical reading of the 1960's in its New
 Year's Day joint editorial, a commentary broadcast in Mandarin on
 29 January rubs in the isolation the Chinese incurred as a result of
 their intransigent stance in the communist movement.  The commentary
 cites the Japan Communist Party as an example of a party which was once

 receptive toward Peking's doctrines but which has since repudiated the
 Chinese line.  Underscoring its point, the commentary observen that
 now only the Albanians "blindly follow" Peking's line.
 Soviet broadcasts in PRC minority languages persist in efforts to fan
 opposition to Peking's nationalities policies toward the Mongols,
 Uighurs, Kazakhs, Tibetans, and other, minorities.  Commentaries in
 these languages accuse the Chinese leaders of stepping up anti-Soviet
 provocations and promoting war hysteria in regions bordering on the
 Soviet Union in order to mask the "forcible assimilation" or
 "extermination" of all the non-Han peoples in China--policies said to
 be effected by destroying national heritages, resettling "millions
 of Chinese" in national regions, and militarizing "all aspects of life
 in the national regions of China."
 CENTRAL ASIAN MILITARY DISTRICT HOLDS FIRST PARTY CONFERENCE
 With an agenda including measures "to further raise the district
 forces' combat readiness," the first party conference of the recently
 created Central Asian Military District--first revealed in Soviet
 media reports in early November 1969 as having jurisdiction over
 territory contiguous with the tense Sinkiang border--is reported by
 the Alma-Ata domestic service on 3 February to have convened on that
 date.  The conference heard reports delivered by the Central Asian
 Military District commander, Gen N. G. Lyashchenko, who formerly
 commanded the old Turkestan Military District from which the new
 district was formed, and by the first and second secretaries of the
 Kirgiz and Kazakh party central committees, respectively.

 PEKING PUBLICIZES SINO-KOREAN BORDER NAVIGATION TALKS
 NCNA reports on 30 January that a meeting of the Sino-Korean Navigation
 and Shipping Cooperation Committee on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers held its
 ninth meeting in Shenyang from 29 December to 29 January and signed a
 cooperation agreement after discussion "in a friendly atmosphere."
 KCNA carries a similar report on 3 February.  The Sino-Korean Border
 River Navigation Cooperation Agreement had been signed on 23 May 1960,
 according to NCNA at the time, and subsequent meetings of the committee
 were reported by Peking through the fifth session in December 1965.
 NCNA's publicity for the current meeting, apparently the first one to
 be reported in PRC media since that time, appears to mark another
 step in Peking's effort to break out of its self-imposed isolation.*
 There have been signs of improved Sino-Korean relations since the Peking
 meeting between Kosygin and Chou En-lai last September.  Strains in
 relations between the two countries since the summer of 1966, when
 Pyongyang forcefully reasserted its  independent  ideological line, had
 culminated in rumors of border clashes in the spring of 1969 at about
 the time of the Sino-Soviet clashes along the Ussuri River.  Presumably
 gratified at the Kosygin-Chou meeting, which marked a defusing of the
 border situation and raised hopes of a reconciliation between the DPRK's
 two giant neighbors, Pyongyang sent the ranking foreign delegation--led
 by DPRK President Choe Yong-kon--to the 1 October PRC National Day
 observances.  Peking in turn displayed some consideration of Pyongyang's
 sensitivity to references to the Sino-Soviet confrontation.  The anti-
 Soviet slogan used in ceremonies involving the North Koreans differed
 from that used at ceremonies for other delegations:  instead of the
 slogan "Down with social imperialism!", NCNA's reports quoted a slogan
 reading "Down with modern revisionism!"  Although Pyongyang avoids
 references to the conflict between its neighbors, it does take a hard
 line on "revisionism."
 Restoration of correct party relations was indicated by the 8 October 1969
 message from Kim Il-song and Choe Yong-kon to Mao Tse-tung, Lin Piao, and
 Chou En-lai on the latest Chinese nuclear test.  This was the first
 greeting from Kim Il-song on such a test since May 1966, and the fact
 that it was addressed to Mao marked a departure from Pyongyang's practice
 over the preceding few rears.  Kim's 30 September message on PRC National
 Day, only a week before the message on the test, was addressed only to
 Chou En-lai.  The last national day message addressed to Mao was in 1966.
 *  Neither Peking nor Pyongyang is known to have reported a railway
 agreement signed on 17 December by the Soviet Union, the PRC, the DRV,
 the DPRK, and the MPR.  A TASS report pointed out that the last such
 meeting on railway cooperation was held in 1966.

 KWANGTUNG PROVINCE TAKES LEAD IN CCP RECONSTRUCTION
 Kwangtung Province s~jems to have superseded Hunan, at least temporarily,
 as bellwether for the CCP reconstruction movement.   On 1 February Canton
 radio reported that a municipal CCP committee had been established in
 Maoming--a lesser Kwangtung city, but nonetheless the first new city
 party committee reported in the nation.  So far, as in the prior example
 of Hunan's new county party committees, alto the first of their type to
 be reported, this development has not been publicized by Peking.
 On 1 February Peking did report on activities of the CCP core group of
 the Kwangtung Provincial Revolutionary Committee.  This is the first
 known reference in official central media to a party core group at the
 provincial level since 1967.  There have been a few local radio references
 in recent weeks to provincial-level core groups for Inner Mongolia and
 Shantung.

 USSR AND  CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 MOSCOW FRONTPAGES POLITICAL DEMISE OF DUBCEK AND CERNIK
 The 30 January PRAVDA carries on page one the CPCZ plenum's announce-
 ment of personnel changes including the resignation of Alexander Dubcek
 from the Central Committee and the removal of his liberal colleague
 Oldrich Cernik as premier and member of the party Presidium.
 Last September, PRAVDA had carried on an inside pr.ge the CPCZ plenum's
 expulsion of Dubcek from the Presidium and Josef Smrkovsky from the
 Central Committee.  A "friendly" visit paid by Cernil: to Warsaw barely
 three weeks before his ouster--a visit given conspicuously lavish
 treatment in Polish media--had drawn minimal Soviet attention and
 restrained coverage from Prague.
 Comment from Moscow and its European bloc allies generally avoids the
 specifics of the latest personnel changes.  PRAVDA's international
 review b;,- Belyayev on 1 February welcomes the plenum's personnel
 shifts and economic measures as ":strengthening the positions of
 socialism" and the party's leading role against the "rightwing" forces.
 The East German Deutschlandsender's Prague correspondent on the 2d,
 however, testily defends the plenum changes against Western press
 "fury," pointing out that Cernik has been given another ministerial
 job (technological development and investments) "in accordance with
 his economic experience."  The GDR correspondent disposes of Dubcek
 with the remark that "some Central Committee members left" that body
 "at their own request because they realized that their attitude in the
 past did not measure up to Marxist-Leninist principles."
 Kosygin and his counterparts in the European communist countries,
 including Romania's Maurer, promptly dispatched messages of congratulations
 to Cernik's conservative successor, Lubomir Strougal.
 HUSAK REPORT    Moscow's treatment of the report by Gustav Husak at
 the plenum's concluding session on 30 January further
 reflects the Soviet leaders' unenthusiastic acceptance of the erstwhile
 Slovak martyr as the best available choice--at least at this juncture--to
 keep a rein on the nationwide popular hostility to the occupiers and their
 proteges.  Thus PRAVDA again refrains from carrying Husak's plenum
 speech in full, devoting a quarter of a page to the speech in the
 31 January issue.  PRAVDA had devoted almost two full pages to the
 CPCZ First Secretary's September plenum speech, which was only about
 twice as long as the present one.  TASS on 30 January and PRAVDA the
 next day predictably highlight Husak's claim of past successes against
 the rightists and his warning that "this does not mean that these forces

 no longer exist, that they do not resort to other methods."  They also
 feature Husak's defensive references to charges by "Western propaganda
 and deserters" that "cert;ain ultraconservative forces exist" in the
 country and "are bringir  pressure on us, on me, and try to establish
 a police regime or terror."
 While duly reporting Husak's remarks ruling out a "return to the fifties,"
 the Soviet reports do not include his repeated pleas, at the windup of
 the speech, for a "sensitive approach" to "win over" the artistic and
 technical intelligentsia "and not just mechanically condemn, label,
 and eliminate" them "in any manner."
 FEDERATION     The Soviet reports also feature remarks by Husak that
 pointedly downgrade the federative system in the
 country, which had been a principal goal of the liberal April 1968
 party program and was implemented some four months after the occupation,
 on 1 January 1969.  The Soviet reports quote Husak to the effect that
 while the federative system--full-scale governments and separate
 communist party entities for the Czech lands and Slovakia--has proved
 to be "correct," the role of "the unifying force is played above all
 by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the single party which is
 guided by the single party committee and has the single program and
 goals."  Husak also said, in the textual version carried in the Prague
 domestic service, that "in some respects, things have gone too far"
 and that there is a need to "correct these mistakes" and "strengthen
 the federal center."  He added that "certain federative elements have
 gotten into our party," and he stressed the past role of the Czech
 party bureau--heretofore headed by the new premier, Strougal--and the
 Slovak Communist Party as a prelude to a call for changes "in the new
 situation."
 JOZEF LENART     The three CPCZ Presidium positions vacated by Cernik,
 trade union leader Polacek, and Slovak party
 First Secretary Sadovsky are taken by conservatives Antonin Kapek,
 Josef Korcak, and Jozef Lenart--whc also replaces the evidently no
 less conservative Sadovsky as head of the Slovak party.  The present
 shift appears to mark the full political comeback of Lenart, who had
 been Novotny's "moderate" choice to succeed the Stalinist figure
 Siroky as CSSR Premier in 1963 but lost this position to Cernik in
 April 1968 and was downgraded from full to alternate Presidium member
 at the same time.  He had remained an alternate Presidium member and
 party secretary both before and since the August 1968 occupation.

 ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA
 BUCHAREST DISCLAIMS "NATIONALISM,'' DEFENDS TIES WITH WEST
 A lengthy article in the February issue of LUPTA DE CLASA, the
 theoretical organ of the Romanian CP Central Committee, is the
 sharpest and most detailed rebuttal of the Soviet view of relations
 between socialist countries to appear in Bucharest media in recent
 months.  As summarized by Radio Bucharest on 2 February, the article
 does not name the Soviet Union but transparently rejects the Soviet
 stand on the dangers of nationalism and Western bridgebuilding and
 vigorously defends Romania's right to economic and political autonomy,
 p ar;:icularly in its developing relations with the West.  The article
 appears against the background of Moscow's efforts to line up support
 for its foreign policy views in conjunction with the propaganda drive
 for a European security conference, and may be reactive to Soviet
 pressures on Romania to conform to those views.  It also appears on
 the eve of the French Communist Party Congress, where socialist
 relations and the sensitive issue of Czechoslovakia are expected to
 come up for discussion.
 In effect rejecting the Soviet argument that national interests of
 socialist countries are subordinate to the class interests of
 socialism, the LUPTA DE CLASA article stresses:   "There is no national
 and international communism, and any delimitation in this field is
 artificial and unscientific; the national and international character
 of communism is an organic, dialectic whole."  It adds that "it is
 entirely erroneous and antiscientific" to attribute the meaning of
 nationalism to the efforts of a people to develop their own country
 with their own forces in a spirit of cooperation with others.
 Noting a tendency in "some works published abroad" to discern a conflict
 between national and international interests, the article argues that
 such opposition develops only when one country tries to dominate
 another and to promote its own development "at the expense of another."
 Thus, it conclv?es, "internationalism does not presuppose the renuncia-
 tion of national interests, because the interstate relations based on
 such renunciation would not be internationalism but subordination."
 In what may be in part a response to Soviet pressures on Romania
 to take part in suprastate planning in CEMA and to go slowly in pushing
 its economic ties with the West, particularly with Bonn, LUPTA DE
 CLASA observes that although Romania is interested in further economic
 cooperation with the socialist countries, socialism "excludes the
 economic domination of one people by another and objectively presup-
 poses the elimination of links that would be disadvantageous to one of

 the partners, or that would create and perpetuate inequality of an
 economic, social, and political nature."
 The article defends Romania's right to develop relations with the West,
 saying life has shown that "the development of ties with the capitalist
 world does not imply the restoration of capitalism"--a possible
 allusion to Moscow'e own relations with the Western countries.  On  he
 contrary, the journal says, such ties contribute to implementation
 of the economic objectives of the socialist countries.  The journal
 also dismisses the idea that Western bridgebuilding endangers East
 European communism:  "The peoples of the socialist countries have
 confidence in their system, and it is absurd to believe that they could
 lose their revolutionary gains as a consequence of bourgeois,
 anticommunist propaganda, no matter how subtle it may be."  Thus
 rejecting Soviet propaganda charges about the dangers of Western
 penetration of Eastern Europe, the article seems contrived in large
 part to undercu6 the Soviet rationale that a stronger CEMA and
 Warsaw Pact are needed to combat an "imperialist" threat.
 YUGOSLAV COMMENTATOR ASSAILS LIMITED SOVEREIGNTY DOCTRINE
 Another spirited--and far more outspoken--attack on Moscow's concept
 of socialist relations appears 'n a 31 January commentary by Radio
 Zagreb's Milika Sundic, who chF..3es the Soviet press with reviving the
 issue of Czechoslovakia and the limited sovereignty doctrine to put
 pressure on other socialist states.  Sundic reacts to recent Soviet
 press articles with a denunciation of Moscow's rationale for the
 intervention in Czechoslovakia--a subject that had been off limits for
 Yugoslav media since Gromyko's visit in the fall of 1969.
 Noting that a SOVIET RUSSIA article on 29 January sought to characterize
 the limited sovereignty doctrine as a Western invention but in effect
 reaffirmed it, Sundic bluntly declares that the doctrine was created by
 "theoreticians  and responsible statesmen whose troops intervened in
 Czechoslovakia in August 1968."  Such theories, Sundic adds, "are
 unacceptable and very dangerous, and the League of Yugoslav Communists
 rejects them as dangerous for the unity of socialist countries and the
 communist and workers movement."  The commentary continues:  "The LCY
 does not recognize any internationalism which demands the renunciation
 of national sovereignty."  Asking rhetorically why the Soviet press is
 raising the issue of Czechoslovakia at this time, Sundic suggests that
 it is being revived "as a continuous threat to others, because othr.--
 wise why should it be talked about in such a manner, when even those
 who are doing this know full well that it is not at all popular?"
 Sundic is a free-wheeling commentator who has at times gone beyond the
 party line in criticizing Soviet policies.  But the references to "the
 LCY" suggest that on this occasion he is reflecting the party's
 sensitivities to Soviet press attacks on nationalism and revisionism
 and to what the Yugoslavs may interpret as propaganda pressures on the
 Romanians.
