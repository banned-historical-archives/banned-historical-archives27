 The uneasy s - emate in the Anglo-Egyptian defense  is-

 denunciation of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, has been granted
 an extension.  Although the British now have additional time in

 Middle East Command that they advanced in the course of NATO
 negotiations, there is no sign of any change in the Egyptian

 Hints of Peace Negotiations in French Indochina Alarm Vietnamese - Page 6
 Several French and Communist statements hinting at the pos-
 sibility of peace negotiations in Indochina have caused concern
 among non-Communist Vietnamese., who fear abandonment to reprisals
 by the Viet Minh.  Such an attitude undermines Vietnamese support
 of the newly-proclaimed "all-out" mobilization effort against the
 Communist enemies.
 Recent Communist Pronouncements Belie Chinese-Soviet Ulit-------- Page 8
 Recent Chinese Communist pronouncements afford no basis for
 widespread current speculation that Sino-Soviet relations are
 deteriorating.  Although these pronouncements make clear that
 Stalin and Mao Tse-tung followed divergent paths from 1921 to
 about 1935, they also show that the early divergence has been
 repaired.  Available evidence indicates strongly that the Sino-
 Soviet alliance is still flourishing.
 Prospects for European Defense Force Now Brighter ---~------------ Page 10
 The three major Western powers are now close to accepting
 the European Army concept as the only:practical solution to the
 problem of immediate German rearmament.  The British are becoming
 more favorably disposed to the idea, and the French are more than
 ever determined to push it because of their fear of renascent Ger-
 nationalismo

 De Soviet World
 The sudden Russian decision to attend the San Francisco conference
 on the Japanese peace treaty, which Moscow has attacked so fiercely,
 presents the West with another of the "zig-zags". which have long marked
 Soviet foreign policy.
 Moscow's propaganda unquestionably will use Soviet attendance at
 the conference as another element in the "peace" campaign, which reached
 a new pitch with Malik's cease-fire speech and, in which each subsequent,
 Soviet move has been played up as proof of cooperativeness and good will.
 Under normal diplomatic rules, acceptance-of the invitation, which
 pro forma went to the USSR along with other.. nations at war with Japan,
 woul  signify approval of the Anglo-American treaty draft as a basis for
 discussion.. Past experience would indicate, however, that the Kremlin
 will hardly feel inhibited by diplomatic tradition; moreover, the strength
 of the Soviet delegation, which is headed by Andrei Gromyko and includes
 Ambassadors Zarubin and Panyushkin, makes it clear that it will have a
 definite purpose in mind.
 Basically, the Soviet Union would like to torpedo the treaty, which
 its propaganda, with the usual shrill background chorus from the Satellites,
 has attacked as illegal and as an imperialistic maneuver to rearm Japan
 against Red China and the Soviet Union.  So violent is Soviet hostility
 to the treaty that it has produced a series of reports, wholly uricon-
 firmed, that the treaty's signature would cause the Kremlin to launch a
 third world war>
 e Russian delegation presumably cannot block signature of the
 treat-, which had already progressed too far in the months of consulta-
 tion.                        The United States intends that there shall be no reservations or
 textuwl changes at San Francisco, but simply an exchange of views..
 Russ-a can, however, exploit the conference for its own propaganda
 purp ayes, and by using the familiar stalling tactics, try gradually to
 split ;apart the nations which have, been asked to sign.. Certain Asian
 coun ries# fearful of offending Communist China, have been hesitant
 about attending, and are still doubtful about signing.  Russia, it seems
 clew,,,, will promptly inject the issue of Peiping's participation, calcu-
 late -,to crystallize Asiatic fears.  It undoubtedly will attack the lack
 of re     ent restrictions, in an effort to arouse the Philippines,
 Austr  is and New Zealand, and the reparations provisions, which have
 been   it  izad by several other prospective signatories.

 'his article is the first of a series which will appear as a regular
 feature in the Current Intelligence Review.  Its purpose is to round
 up, with pertinent background and interpretive material, the major de-
 velopments in.the Soviet and Soviet-dominated areas.

 If the USSR could make the conference look like an "imperialist"
 attempt to dictate terms which were unpalatable to the majority, its
 purpose would have been at least partly served.,
 Meanwhile, the,USSR used the Truman-Shvernik exchange to give
 impetus to its "peace" campaign, but its motives in giving internal
 circulation to the Truman message and the Congressional resolution.
 appear to have been defensive.  Wide coverage in Voice of,America
 broadcasts had already brought these expressions of US friendship to
 the attention of the Russian people.
 Russian propaganda during the week also provides evidence that the
 breaking of Western economic controls was a primary objective of the
 1apeace49 campaign.  It strongly underlined the theme of freer East-West
 trade which, aside from the economic benefits to Western nations, would
 advance the cause of peace by relaxing world tensions.  Whatever action
 the Kremlin may be contemplating in San Francisco, there are indications
 that trade, particularly with Communist China, will be the carrot dangled
 before the Japanese to tempt them into a neutral position.
 Some evidence of the growing effectiveness of Western export con-
 trols is available in Polish efforts to use coal as a bargaining weapon
 in order to obtain non-Orbit strategic materials.  Poland is reluctant
 to deliver coal and coke to Finland because of the latter?s refusal to
 import aluminum and cobalt for resale to Poland;  A trade agreement with
 Austria is to remain in effect only so long as,Austria continues sub-
 stantial deliveries of ball bearings, which are on the Western embargo
 list.  Polish-Norwegian trade negotiations broke down recently because
 Poland demanded strategic goods for its coal,  The Polish position in
 all negotiations of this sort is strengthened by the generally increased
 demand for coal in Western Europe as its rdarmament is accelerated,
 Inside Russia, the usual claims of important production gains
 marked the report on the second quarter of the 1951 State Plano  Announce-
 ment of the planes results failed to clarify, however, whether the re-
 ported 16 percent gain in gross output resulted from rising military or
 civilian production,  The Soviet Union is still silent on the new Five
 Year Plan; presumably it will follow the first postwar plan, which ended
 on 16 April,
 Developments in both the USSR and its Satellites testified to their
 continued concern with internal and external security,  Preoccupation with
 internal unrest was manifest in the trial and sentencing of nine high-
 ranking Polish ere Army officers for national deviation and espionage.
 Poland's leading deviationists, ex-Communist Party Secretary Gomulka and
 ex-Vice Minister of National Defense Spychalski0have been implicated in
 the trial, and the US Embassy in Warsaw speculates on the possibility
 that its repercussions will include a widespread purge of the Polish

 The uneasy stalemate in the Anglo-Egyptian defense discussions., which
 until a few days age were ex petted to be broken by Egypt's, denunciation of
 the 1936 Treaty., has been granted an extension,,
 Foreign Minister Salaheddin, who had intimated earlier
 that it would be necessary to abrogate the treaty very saor&.Lys
 has now in  cated to the US Ambassador that he does not plan to do so un-
 til, perhaps October.  Although King Farouk informed the Prime Minister that,
 he does not want the negotiations broken off, the latter has said that
 Salaheddin?a statement expresses the views of the government.
 The British now have additional time in which to put forward new sug-
 gestions, but there is no sign of any change in the Egyptian attitudes From
 Egypt's point of view., ample provocation for denouncing the treaty has
 existed for some time.  The presence of British forces on Egyptian soil is
 an issue on which public feeling can always be violently aroused, and the
 political future of any Egyptian Government depends upon a certain amount
 of obeisance to this shibboleth.
 The residual. antipathy to Britain has been intensified by recent in-
 dignant statements in the House of Commons concerning the  Egyptian attitude
 toward the UK ,and by the possibility of a UN Security Council resolution re-
 questing the lifting of the Egyptian ban on Israel-bound ships transitting
 the Suez Cana-.  Although the Egyptians have mentioned numerous possible
 quid pro quo's for lifting the restrictions., were are no. indications that
 they are willing to use the evacuation of British troops as a bargaining
 point.  There is little hope that the-efforts to get Egypt to lift the
 restrictions voluntarily will succeeds, and, the Foreign Minister has said
 that Egypt will not comply with any resolution requesting their removal.
 The right to use bases in Egypt is the cardinal point of British defense
 planning for the Near East.  Since-1946 the UK has been attempting to find a
 formula.., including the withdrawal of British troops., that would satisfy
 Egyptian aspirations and still provide for joint Anglo-Egyptian control of
 the bases and the right to return armed forces to the bases before actual
 hostilities break out. ,High-ranking British military commanders believe
 that, although it would be possible to locate their main striking forces
 elsewhere, there is no substitute for retaining the. Suez area as a head-
 quarters base.  In addition, the British do not feel that the Egyptians are
 capable of maintaining the bases up to the necessary standards.  The Egypt-
 ians., on the other hand, regard the concept of joint defense as an infringe-
 ment of their sovereignty, although they admit the need for Western support
 in the event of a global war.
 With the discussions on the admission  of Greece and Turkey into NATO
 and the command structure for the Mediterranean., the .Anglo-Egyptian impasse

 becomes of more direct concern to the US, even though the UK continues to
 assume primary responsibility for the defense of the Middle E .st-" The
 proposal to associate Egypt with the US, the UK, France, Turkey., and pos-
 sibly other states, in a joint Middle East command, recently put forward
 by the British,., might in part assuage the Egyptian feeling of outraged
 sovereignty,  Under such a plan, it would not be British forces alone that
 were participating in the defense of Egyptian bases.  However, as long as
 the Egyptians continue to feel that they are capable of maintaining the
 installations in the Suez Carl area by themselves, they will be reluctant
 to join even a multilateral arrangement of this kind.

 Since the beginning of the truce talks in Korea, several statements
 by both French and Communist sources have hinted at the possibility of
 peace negotiations in Indochina.  Although these hints have not been followed
 by positive action they have caused concern among non-Communist Vietnamese,
 who fear abandonment to reprisals by the Viet Minh.  Such an attitude under-
 mines Viet namese support of the newly-proclaimed 'all-out" mobiUzatio;i
 ffort against the Communist anemia
 The first Communist reference to negotiation,, during this period, was
 an editorial in the fellow travelling Paris newspaper Ii,eration on 2 July.
 The headline of this editorial    Q?Wby Not a Cease-Firs in Vietnams:  Why
 Not Open Peace Negotiations with Ho Chi Minh" ?? was broadcast by the Viet
 Minh radio on 12 July without comment.  On 20 Dully, French Communist Joliot?
 Curia, who had just visited Moscow, stated before the Soviet-sponsored World
 Peace conference at Helsinki that in view of the Korean negotiations, 90it is
 important that negotiations to end the war in Vietnam be started.90
 Shortly afterward, the Soviet Ambassador to France reportedly told the
 Paris correspondent of a Dutch periodicals   We believe that if negotiations
 (in Indochina) were undertaken on definite points there would be a good
 chance for them to result in a solution acceptable to both parties."
 While these statements would appear to be of a conciliatory nature,
 the general tone of Soviet, Chinese Communist and Viet Minh propaganda con-
 tinues to be agressive and uncompromising.
 The first French allusion . to negotiations appeared in a briefing by
 General de Lat  a?s headquarters.  It was stated that the Viet Minh, had
 sustained very heavy losses in its May-June offensive and that among the
 alternatives faced by the Viet Minh was that of a ?0cease-fire.   A some-.
 what clearer reference to negotiation was made by hetournean, French Minis-
 ter of Associated States, according to a Paris correspondent.  However,
 Letou.rne.? s reported statement that the coming solution in Korea might
 serve as the basis for a solution of the problem of civil war in Vietnam
 was later denied by him.
 Whatever Letourneaau 'acctuually said on this occasion, the Vietnamese
 have not forgotten that, in a 17 January 1951 radio reference to the de-
 sirability of elections in Vietnam, Letournean did estate that contacts
 between the "two ccamp& in Vietnam have "fortunately' never been completely
 broken and that a response from the 19other side might have favored a more
 rapid soluticno
 Other reports and indications from time to time-tend to bear out the
 implication that the French are reluctant to repudiate completely the pros-
 pect of a compromise with Ho Chi Minh.  Several factors m- the high cost of
 the war, the French Government?s preoccupation with the defense of Europe,

 the inclination, of inffential private French interests inIndochina to
 end the ruinous warfare mo have indicated that the French Government
 would welcome an opportunity to withdraw gracefully from the impasse.
 On the other hands, the French Government is not known to have taken any
 concrete steps since ,1947.-toward a compromise.
 Aside from the question of whether a serious intent to negotiate
 existst, an important by-product of the cease-fire hints is the conster-
 nation they have aroused among the Vietnamese who have committed them-
 selves to a policy of cooperation with the French.. Almost all of these
 Vietnamese fear that the French will contrive some face-saving formula
 for withdrawing from Indochina, leaving the Baca Dai government at the
 mercy of the Viet Minh. Recollection of the flexibility displayed by
 Vichy French officials toward Japanese aggression in 194Q,, and bf Yrance'a
 1946 negotiations with He Chi Minh at the expense of Non-Communist Nation-
 alistsb aggravates these fears,

 Recent Communist, Pronounce
 Recent Chinese Communist publications provide excellent evidence
 that Peiping demands and is accorded a position in the Soviet bloc
 superior to that of the Ea stern European Satellites, but afford no
 basis for the current widespread speculation that S.no-Soviet relations
 are deteriorating.
 While these publications make clear that Mao Tse-tung and the
 Kremlin were pursuing different and frequently antagonistic lines in
 China through most or all of the period from 1921 to 19359 they also
 show that the early divergence has been repaired in the course of the
 past 15 years.  Not only is the Sino-Soviet alliance still flourishing,
 but Moscow feels sufficiently secure to recommend Mao Tsemtung's pro-
 gram to ?'liberatioe 'movements throughout Apia.
 Evidence of "serious trouble" between Moscow and Peiping has been
 adduced from such ambiguous developments as the omission from Chinese
 Army Day slogans of references to the USSR or Stalin and the absence
 of a special Peiping delegation from the recent Warsaw "liberation"
 ceremonies.  Certain observers have found particularly significant some
 seven Chinese Communist theoretical works issued on th6 30th anniversary
 of the Party's founding ong 1 July, and an editorial in the Cominform
 journal commenting on extracts from four of the seven works which ap-
 peared in that journal.  None of this alleged evidence supports the
 thesis of current ill=feeling between Moscow and Peiping.  In fact, the
 articles most widely cited are among the strongest indications of con-
 tinuing.Sin"pviet amity.
 The articles in question expound the theme that Mao Tse-tung's
 great contribution to the theory and practice of international Communism
 has been the adaptation of Marxism-Leninism to a backward Asian nation,
 In the course of this argument, the Chinese writers explicitly denounce
 .the policies of the pre-Mao party leaders (1921-1935) who had faith-
 fully followed the Kremlin in the years when Mao was pursuing an inde-
 pendent line.  This line m? the imposition of a Marxist-Leninist party
 on a peasant rather than proletarian base mm was adopted by the Chinese
 Communist leadership, and sanctioned by Moscow, only in the 1930's.
 There is strong evidence that Moscow's acceptance of both the Mao pro-
 gram and the Mao leadership was an act of acquiescence in an accomplished
 fact.
 The denunciation of Moscow's earlier servants makes it difficult
 for the Chinese theoreticians to maintain, as they do in these articles,
 that both Mae and Stalin have always been right.  In defending features
 of Mao's program as examples of his ability to apply Marxism-Leninism
 to local conditions with maximum profit9 and in asserting that Mao's
 innovations were in every case authorized by earlier pronouncements of
 Marx, Lenin and Staling the Chinese writers have been obliged to mis-
 represent both developments in China and the positions of the Communist

 fathers to whom they appeal for blessing.  The articles are significant
 chiefly for their obvious anxiety to identify "Stalinism" wM "Maoism,"
 whatever the cost to historical accuracy.
 As the seven articles make clears the most important truths in Sino-
 Soviet relations are not that the paths of Stalin and Mao were once diver-
 gent and that the Chinese Communist movement developed along certain
 lines which had to be sanctioned after the fact, but that the lines of
 Stalin and Mao have long been and still are-convergent and that the
 Chinese Communists contini4ally seek and obtain Soviet sanction for their
 program.
 Current speculation regarding a Sino-Soviet split mo particularly
 speculation originating in Belgrade o- appears to be based on the assump-
 tion that there is an intricate, precise and rigid body of doctrine
 known as Marxism-Leninism to which a point-for-point correspondence is
 demanded on the part of all Communist movements.  The fact is, however,
 that in practice Marxism-Leninism has been reduced to a single simple
 principles  Stalin has always been, is now, and will always beg perfectly
 right.  In recent years the Kremlin has broken with certain of its
 lieutenants, like Tito and Gomulka, not for offenses against doctrine
 but for resistance to Stalin and Stalinist domination.  In the case of
 China, Peiping's version of history is corrupted to conceal the fact
 that Stalin for some years was ludicrously wrong from a.Chinese Communist
 viewpoint,
 The soviet press, throughout 19519 has published extravagant praise
 of Mao Tse-tung,, elevating Mao's prestige in the world Communist move-
 ment to a level enjoyed by no other living non-Russian Communist.  It
 is true, as some observers have noted, that the Soviet press is less
 effusive over Mao than is the Chinese, and that the Cominform journal?s
 editorial suggests a Soviet desire that greater credit be accorded the
 Soviet contribution to Mao's successes than, appears in the reprinted
 Chinese articles., However, the Chinese press would be expected to adopt
 a more obsequious tone toward the Chinese leader than would the Soviet,
 and the Soviet press would be expected to emphasize the Soviet contri-
 On balance, Moscow's recent pronouncements on Mao's excellence as
 leader and theoretician are an almost conclusive demonstration of Soviet
 confidence in his present fidelity.  Similarly, recent Chinese Communist
 pronouncements are an equally strong indication that such Soviet con-
 fidence is justified.  It is of course possible that the extension of
 Stalinist control over the Chinese Communist State will eventually pro-
 voke resistance, but no significant conflict has yet become apparent.

 Prospects for European Defense Force Now Brighter
 The prospects for an integrated European Defense Force have im-
 proved considerably in the past few months.  The-five countries
 participating in the Paris Conference on the Pleven proposal for a.
 European Army have settled most of the points at issue, and are
 optimistic that early agreement will be reached on the rest of the
 agenda.
 What is perhaps more important is the increasingly favorable
 .attitude of the United States and Britain., both of which are now inclined
 to accept the French proposal as the only practical solution to the
 problem of immediate German rearmament.
 The coolness with which the UK received the original Pleven Plan
 derived from traditional suspicion of Continental unity compounded with
 general scepticism about thhe'feasibilityof the venture.  The British
 refused to participate actively in the European Army discussions.
 The UK is, however, committed to the principle of German parti-
 cipation in Western Defense.
 American support for the Pleven Plan has gradually caused the
 British to  view it with less hostility, particularly since there is now
 no question that it will include theme  Their eventual acceptance will
 probably be conditioned on guarantees of NATO control and assurances
 from NATO leaders that the plan is practical, but there is now little
 doubt that they will follow US guidance in this matter.  The smaller
 NATO countries can be expected to follow the UK on this point. This is
 particularly true of the Netherlands, which may now be encouraged to
 join the European Army.
 The French, who have never deviated from their basic purpose of
 preventing German military resurgence,, have been encouraged by General
 Eisenhower?s recent public endorsement of the Pleven Plan.  Many French
 officials had thought that US military leaders regarded the plan as a
 French scheme to defer or prevent German rearmament, and consequently
 of no practical value.  The French now believe that renewed US insistence
 on prompt German participation in Western defense will hasten general
 acceptance of the European Army concept.
 The French determination to accept German rearmament only within
 the context of an integrated European Army is reinforced by recent indi-
 cations of a revival of German militarism, as illustrated by General
 Ramcke?s appeal for unfettered German rearmament.  The French tend to
 magnify the importance of Nazi recrudescence and the influence of former
 Wehrmacht officers over Adenauer"s military advisors.  French officials
 are therefore more than ever convinced that an autonomous German army
 within the framework of the Atlantic forces would constitute a grave

 danger which could be averted only by. integrating the German contingent
 into a Continental force.
 The; aims of the Bonn government itself are clear.  Adenauer is a
 firm proponent of European integration and of a Franco-German entente.
 He has stressed publicly the necessity of a German military contribution
 to Western defense, and he accepts the European Army framework as a
 step toward the larger goal of political and economic integration.  More-
 over, as far as the German people are concerned, their current opposition
 to rearmament would probably be more readily overcome if the European.
 Defense Forces became a reality.  The Germans, however, are seeking
 consistently to drive hard bargains with the Allies on this and other
 ?  critical issues, and can be expected to exact a.high price on their
 ultimate concurrence in general agreement on a European Army.  The
 Paris Conference. has been characterized by a realistic approach to the
 problem; the remaining issues are largely technical, particularly the
 questions of staff relationships and of the maximum permissible size of
 national units.
 In view of these practical accomplishrnents, the prospects for early
 agreement are relatively bright.  The decision on the Pleven Plan will
 probably be made at the NATO Council meeting at Rome in October.  The
 opportunity to obtain a German contribution to Western defense soon will
 undoubtedly spur theWestern occupying powers to clear the way by
 hastening the conclusion of contractual agreements with the Federal
 Republic.

 Agitation Increases over Trieste Qasetion  (lap Attached)
 Increasing rapprochement between the US and Yugoslavia, aiid; the,_iunnin-
 ence of the municipal elections scheduled for early October in Zone A
 of the Free Territory of Trieste are precipitating a resurgence of Ital-
 ian irredentism.  This agitation is in turn reflected in.increased Yugo-
 slav concern over the Italian attitude.
 The United States has suggested that the time is now ripe for a
 bilateral settlement of the Trieste issues in connection with a possible
 general revision of the Italian Peace Treaty,, under which the Free Terr-_
 itory was established.  The UK concedes that  the climate. for successful
 Italo=Yiagoslav negotiations" is now. b sore propitious",O but does not in-
 dicate how imminent it feels such a settlement could be
 Both Italy and Yugoslavia have recently indicated.that they desire
 a Trieste settlement.  Italy desires this because of its fear of less-
 ened Western support for Italian claims to all of Trieste0.  Italian in-
 sistence on the return of all of the Free Territory   ,?aart2!r.' d2-~ eteid at
 the Italian public, large segments of which are currently inflamed over
 the Trieste issue.  The Italian Government will find the 'championing of
 Trieste a highly useful issue in the ;coming municipal elections in both
 Trieste and southern Italy where the Ohristian Democratic Government
 fears a lose of prestige.
 Tito has indicated to US Ambassador Allen that the Yugoslav Govern-
 ment is anxious to settle the Trieste problem because it remains the
 outstanding one in Yugoslav relations with the West.,.Tito has expressed
 the opinion that its settlement would materially strengthen the common
 front against Oominform aggression.  Tito offered. three alternative so-
 lutions for a Trieste settlements  (a) the maintenance of the status
 quo (interpreted by Allen to mean the division of Trieste along present
 zonal boundaries rather than a continuation of the present military
 regime), (b) the establishment of a Zone B autonomous regime with pro-
 visions for minority rights, or (c) a territorialexchange by which
 Yugoslavia would relinquish the coastal region of Capodistria in ex-
 change for  some Slovene villages in Zone A."
 Under any compromise, the Italians would insist on'obtaining all
 the Italian coastal towns in the Yugoslav Zone B. but would probably
 be willing to make economic or other concessions. to Yugoslavia.. A
 settlement on ethnic lines would give the Italians these coastal cities
 and most of Zone A, including the city of Trieste.  The city e s 280',000
 Italians far exceed the population of the hinterland of Zone A,, which
 has only 30,000 Yugoslavs.  Italy is reportedly anxious to regain the

 inland city of Buie in Zone Bs which is populated almost entirely by
 Italians.  Titoos statements indicate that Yugoslavia would be; unwilling
 to relinquish control of these cities.
 Both countries presumably would be reluctant to see the removal
 of the 10,000 US and British troops from Trieste.  It has been suggested,
 therefore, in conversations' between US representatives and the French
 Ambassador in Rome, that an agreement on Trieste similar to -that ar-
 rived at in connection with the US base at Leghorn might be reached
 within the framework of the Atlantic Pact,
 The possibility of a compromise between Italy and Yugoslavia on
 .the Trieste issue is improbable for the time beings in view of the
 hardened attitudes on the issue in both countries.  Although the spokes
 men of both Italy and Yugoslavia speak of the necessity for a settle-
 ment, the inadequacy of their compromise proposals suggest that both
 governments see little need for any major concessions at the moment?

 SPECIAL ARTICLE.-  L he Thereat o    r betwee    die and Psk3.stan
 Recent developments in the four-year-old Kashmir dispute have
 focused attention on the possibility of war between India and Pakistan
 in the near future.  It now appears that war may break out within the
 next few months and that it may be intentionally provoked by India,
 rather than by Pakistan.
 The potentially explosive situation first developed ? shortly -after
 the partition of India on 15 August 1947, with a revolt in Kashmir
 which led to a period of open warfare between India and Pakistan from
 October 1947 to January 1949 for possession of. the State.  Since that
 time, animosity has centered around the Kasha  e^ question and especially
 around methods for demilitarizing the State preparatory to a plebiscite
 which would determine the future of its inhabitants.
 -Unlike Pakistan, India has been unwilling to accept suggestions
 of the United Nations Security Council for settlement of this dispute.
 It has based its intransigent attitude on the claim that Pakistan is
 the aggressor in Kashmir and therefore has no right to equal treatment
 with India.
 During prolonged negotiations under Security Council auspices,
 both India and Pakistan have consolidated their positions in the parts of
 Kashmir held by them.  India, particularly, has integrated the government
 and armed forces of Indian-held territory into its own systems and
 has shown a determination never to relinquish control.,
 .  In a recent bid to settle the Kashmir problem unilaterally?
 India on 1 May 1951 permitted the nominal ruler of the State to
 call for the convening of a Constituent Assembly early in October.
 It is generally assumed that' one of the first duties of the Assembly
 will be to declare the allegiance of Kashmir to India;  India will
 thus be able to present the United Nations with a fait accompli, on
 the argument that the people of Kashmir have expressed their will
 and that there is no further need for UN consideration of the case.
 Pakistan, fearing this eventuality, has protested to the
 Security Council about the prospective Kashmiri Assembly action,
 and there has been some speculation as to the possibility that
 Pakistan, would try to prevent it if the Security Council did note,  To
 date,. the Security Council has taken no action on the Pakistani protest.

 Unless there is a considerable, unforeseen rise in popular exm
 citement over Kashmir, the well entrenched Pakistani Government can
 probably resist any pressure to take action before the Kashmir as-
 sembly elections   Since the government cannot win permanent posses-
 sion of Kashmir by invasion, and since it might accomplish only its
 own destruction by doing so, it is unlikely to iaa tiste,armed warfare,:`
 in the near futureo
 On the other hand, the Indian Congress Party high.:command, which
 now controls the Indian Government, appears to have embarkedupon?a
 campaign designed to achieve the final political,.if not m;litary
 defeat of%Pakistan on the question of Kashmir.
 The development which may:vitally.affect the course of.this
 campaign is a recent shift in the balance ofinternal.Congress Party
 power from the liberal faction of - Prime Minister Nehru-to the ? right-
 ist faction of party president Tandon0  This began, in September 1950

 TOP SECRET
 Since that time, the rightists have steadily gained ground at the
 expense of Nehru and more liberal party elements.  Rightist activi-
 ties have so alienated certain sections of the-party as to bring
 about their formal resignation.  This, in turn,' has weakened Nehru's
 position and removed a considerable portion of his support.  Aside .
 from dictating to Nehru on matters of internal policy, the rightists
 have now begun to challenge him on questions of foreign affairs,,
 heretofore his exclusive prerogative.  Furthermore, they have dis-
 played a willingness to accept Nehros?s resignation from the party
 if he should object to dictation.
 Having achieved control of the Congress Partyp the rightists
 seem to have turned their attention to a quick and final solution
 of the Kashmir problem.  Their goal is the official establishment
 of a Kashmir Constituent Assembly and a vote of allegiance to India.
 Their method is to speed the election of the Assembly, to make it
 impossible for Pakistan to intervene short of war, to develop a
 aadefensiveP? propaganda campaign enabling India to justify whatever
 action is required in carrying out its plans, and to increase poli-
 tical and military pressure upon Pakistan to the point where Pakistan
 will either have to resort to war or admit defeat.  If necessary,
 the Congress rightists appear ready to make the first military move
 in Kashmir.
 The Indian campaign has various aspects.  It has attempted to
 demonstrate that the election of .a Kashmir National Assembly con-
 stitutes no threat to an eventual settlement of the Kashmir question.
 An Indian news release suggests that, even if India were in permanent
 possession of Kashmir, it could not cut off Pakistan?s water supplies
 derived from the rivers of that State, a point of great concern to
 Pakistanis.  A second aspect of the campaign has been the production
 of 1Bevidencel9 of Pakistan?s aggressive intentions, which have neces-
 sitated the adoption of appropriate "defensive" measures by India.
 Another.most dangerous development has been a series of goading
 actions possibly designed to provoke Pakistan into making the first
 military move.  These actions have included large-scale troop move-
 ments, placing almost all of Indians fighting forces on the borders
 of West and East Pakistan.  A series of raids by Afghan tribesmen
 along the northwestern and west-central borders of West Pakistan in
 late July and early August may have been Indian-inspired.

 The Congress Party rightists have the support of militants ultra-
 nationalistic Hindu groups such as the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya
 Swayaansevak Sangho  Both of` the so groups are firmly committed to the
 principles of-a Hindu India,, Indian possession of Kashmir, firm dealings
 with Pakistan., and eventual reunion of Pakistan with-India,  For the
 first time since 1950, these groups are now getting their views before
 the public,,
 The current Indian agitation is very similar to a campaign waged
 by India against Pakistan late in 1949.  At that time India made a
 strenuous., deliberate attempt through economic warfare to destroy the
 Pakistani economic system and force devaluation of the Pakistani rupee,
 Hindu extremists and the Indian press .in West Bengal added a communal
 touch to the struggle., which., by March 19508 had led India and Pakistan
 to the verge of war.  The outbreak of actual fighting was narrowly averted
 only by the last-minute personal intervention of Prime Ministers Nehru
 and Liaquat Ali Khan,
 In August 1951,, however, the balance of power within the' Congress
 Party and the attitude of its-ruling faction appear to be such as to
 preclude intervention.  Nehru,, who undoubtedly was in favor of Indian
 actions to retain control of Kashmir,, apparently no longer has the
 power within his party to hinder the development of a situation which
 might lead to war.  He may even doubt his ability to stop such a war
 through an extra-party appeal to the Indian public in his capacity
 as Prime Minister,  It therefore seems highly significant that, on
 11 August,, Nehru reportedly asked to be relieved of membership in the
 top policy-making committees of the Congress Partly,
 .Coming at this time., his request looks muh like an effort to
 dissociate himself from inner party circles and to relieve himself
 of future blame for decisions made,, or about to be made, by the
 rightist Congress leadership,  Such a request would be consistent
 with Nehruns probably sincere desire to maintain world peace even
 though he strongly wishes India to retain Kashmir,
 Three other Indian Cabinet and Congress Party members, close
 associates of Nehru., have resigned or-expressed their desire to do no.
 If the moderating effect of these men, two of whom are Moslems, is
 removed from Indian Government and Congress Party councils, there is
 little to prevent the rise of anti-Pakistani and communal feeling in
 India which could ultimately lead to war,
