 Soviets `'rofit from Cuban sugar Barter:
 It was B213TY L' NOT D in Bi-t1eekly Guidance /12O, of IS
 November 1963 that Cuba was exporting approximately one million
 tons of sugar to nessia during 1033, of which 33% was exchanged
 for other goods at 3 cents 'U.S. per pound and 207o sold for hard
 currency at 4 cents per pound.  The difference between those low
 rates and the world price of close to 11 cents is the price Cuba
 has to-pay for nussian arms and membership in the Communist fra-
 ternity.  This was the price exacted by Xhrushchev from Castro,
 during his Sarin; 1933 visit, in return for a promise to,.extend
 more Soviet credits to buy more Soviet goods.
 Castro made another surprise visit to the soviet Union on
 January 13, 1354.   It has been reported ,47Y Times 13 January
 10647 that  Lhrushchev has now agreed to preempt less of the Cuban
 sugar crop as payment for his aid, which would allow the Castro
 regime to sell sugar elsewhere and pay for imports with the pro-
 ceeds.  Assuming this report to be true, it is not as magnanimous
 as it might sound:   according to experts, an analysis of the size
 of sugar shipments to and from the Soviet Union shows that a pro-
 fit of at least $73 million should already have been realized on
 just a portion of the Cuban sugar committed to Ihrushchev.  To
 allow financially-strapped Cuba to earn a little hard currency
 might reduce Cuban complaints and demands for greater economic
 support from the Soviet Union -- and give the Soviet Union credit
 for stealing a little less Cuban sugar than was originally ex-
 actea.
 Ue present this as an example, not only of the mismanage-
 ment of Cuban economic affairs by the Castro regime, but also of
 ghat it means to be a }ussian satellite.
 Soviet Growth estimates
 predictably, Soviet press and radio media have heavily at-
 tac'.ed the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for itsesti late, re-
 leased through the Idev ''orl  Times of S January (`press Comment,
 3 January), that the Soviet economic growth rate f`5     asx67
 and 1:33 to 2.5 per cent.   (Incidentally, Agency analysts in
 their press release of 9 January only gave the 2.5 figure for
 E M3; copies of this 4-page release are available if neoded.)
 Vestern press comment has also been largely critioai.          25X1C1Ob

 PROPAGANDIST'S GUIDE TO COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS

 Commentary
 Principal Developments:
 1.  The Chinese continued to attack (on a somewhat lower
 key) and to gain some ground against apparently mild Soviet-op-
 position.  The strongest Chinese polemics came during Chou's 9-
 day visit to Albania, in denunciatory speeches by Chou and his
 hosts and a joint statement by the two governments which brought
 official Yugoslav notes of protest -- but no mention by the
 Soviets.  A Yugoslav correspondent in Moscow, noting on January
 9 that the Soviets had abstained from replying to the continuing
 Chinese assaults for two and a half months, said:   "People in
 Moscow think that this is an alarming situation."   Khrushchev
 did make several references to his differences with the Chinese
 (not named) in his off-the-cuff speech with Castro in Kalinin on
 the last day of this period, but of a purely defensive nature.
 (Chrono, January 17.)
 2.  Back in Africa after Albania, Chou reverted to his role
 of affable diplomat:  most observers assessed his gains as greater
 than anticipated, even though no spectacular achievements were
 reported.   (Chrono, entire period.)
 3.  The conflict was mirrored in further turbulent develop-
 ments among parties in non-Communist Europe.  Chinese gains could
 be seen in the apparent advance of the pro-Chinese dissidents in
 Belgium (Chrono, January 3) and the bolting of the extreme left
 wing of Nenni's Italian Socialist Party to form a new Socialist
 party of Proletarian Unity which seems to be ideologically closer
 to Pelting than to the Italian CP.   (Chrono, January 13).  Pro-
 Chinese elements in Sveden were thoroughly rebuffed at the C'?'s
 20th Congress, but the ?arty seems also to have moved away from
 the CPSU in the direction of an independent, right-leaning, na-
 tional version of Communism.   (Chrono, January 3-6)  (The Italian
 and French Parties announced plans for reorganizations to provide
 more inner-party democracy, but this would seem to have no effect
 on their alignment in the movement:   Chrono, January 15/1v).
 4.  A clandestine report of plans for a meeting of Latin
 American Communist youth leaders in Eavana January 20, to make
 preparations for the Second Latin American Youth Congress (LAYC)
 scheduled for March in Santiago, Chile, told of fear of disHu p-
 tion through an outbreak of the Sino-Soviet dispute.   It asserted
 that no Soviet delegation would attend the 2nd LAYC in an effort
 to avoid a confrontation with the Chinese and that the Soviets
 are urging that the Chinese also be kept away.
 5.  Meanwhile, even the most dissident elements in world
 Comunism reacted with the same stridently anti-imperialist out-
 cries to the Communist-exploited anti-U.S. riots in Panama and
 the Communist-led overthrow of the government in Zanzibar.

 Significance:
 2 v e n t s were more important than words during this per-
 iod:             Chou En-lai's much publicized pied-piper circuit in Africa,
 given additional encouragement by de Gaulle's intention to estab-
 lish diplomatic ties with ?eking; Castro's surprise visit to Mos-
 cow, whether caused by Cuba's economic woes or by welcome rioting
 in Panama; apparent establishment of the first Communist foothold
 in Africa, on Zanzibar; the shift in the Swedish CP and the left-
 wing split away from Iienni's Italian Socialists.
 Only the Chinese, with their Albanian supporters maintained
 the battle of w o r d s, against persistent silence in Moscow.
 We wonder whether this "turn-the-other cheek" attitude, not gen-
 erally characteristic of tyhrushchev, reflects his conviction that
 his domestic and foreign policy efforts hold more promise to re-
 gain hegemony in the t.'orld Communist Movement for the CPSU than
 "escalating"polemics, whether he is muted under pressure from
 domestic opposition or whether Moscovw's odd  reticence  cloaks a
 new round of behind-the-scenes negotiations with ?eking.
 In any case, the events of this period appear to favor the
 Chinese over the Soviets.  At the sane time they might well mean
 some Communist gain against the free world, underscoring our re-
 peated warnings that dissensions in the Communist camp cannot be
 relied upon to weaken the entire Communist cause automatically:
 they will serve free-world interests only to the extent to which
 vie are able and determined to utilize them for our own purposes.

 CHRONOLOGY -- COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 3-17 January 1964
 Throughout period - The Chicom delegation headed by Chou En-lai
 continues its African tour  see Chrono Dec. 14 and continuing).
 During his 9-dayAlbanian interlude, Dec. 31-Jan. 9, Chou re-
 verted easily from the mild manner of a reasonableciplomat to
 his other role as a militant Communist, with a series of speeches
 containing increasingly direct slams at the Tito clique and the
 Soviet camp.   Before a mass rally in Tirana on the Sth, he spoke
 of the "brilliant successes" won by the Albanians "in a state
 of encirclement b  enemies and in spite of the perfidy of those
 who originally styled themselves as comrades."  After going on at
 some length about "modern revisionism" which "has tampered with
 the fundamental axioms of Marxism-Leninism and has been seeking
 to paralyze the revolutionary will of the people of the world,
 disorganize the revolutionary ranks from within, and help im-
 perialism prolong its life," Chou declaims:  "The Chinese people
 will never forget that when the modern revisionists leveled
 wanton slanders and attacks at the CCP9 the Albanian Workers Party
 ...0     courageously stepped forward, resisted this evil trend, and
 mercilessly exposed and dealt blows at the modern revisionists'
 anti-China scheme."  The 5,000-word-plus joint statement issued by
 both countries on the 9th strongly denounces the modern revision-
 ists and "the modern dogmatists (who) always follow the baton of
 the modern revisionists," "great nation chauvinism and national
 egoism in relations between socialist countries," "any attempt to
 reverse the verdict on the Tito clique (which) is a betrayal of
 Marxism-Leninism," and "the splitting and disruptive schemes of
 the modern revisionists (which) will surely meet with complete
 failure."
 The Yugoslavs counter-attacked, especially in articles in the
 main Belgrade dailies Borba and Politika on the 12th which not
 only denounced Chou's "hostile campaign against Yugoslavia" and
 the "frontal Chinese destructive wrecking and harmful policy
 toward the socialist world and international labor movement,"
 but also objected to "that part of the Tirana resolution in which
 the Chinese and Albanian leaders proclaim a major part of the coun-
 tries of Asia, Africa and Latin America as an 'interzone' -- that
 is to say, as a 'non-occupied, uncovered zone to which the  direct-a
 _y orientate themselves at the moment."    oliika calls this "an
 underestimation of the peoples of these countries, who have their
 own ideas about development .... the Chinese leaders want to im-
 pose themselves as inspirers, champions and  patrons of the
 national liberation movements, and of peoples who have freed them-
 selves from foreign oppression and, moreover, are making attempts
 to determine their policy."  On the 14th, the Yugoslav Government
 handed official notes of protest to the Chinese Ambassador and
 the Albanian Charge d'Affaires, -- which the latter refused to
 accept.

 Moscow, meanwhile, sald.nothiiigr about Chou's performances, beyond
 brief reports of his MoVements.  Merely indirectly, a Pravda
 editorial board interview on the 6th with Ghana's Nkrumah stressed
 Soviet-Ghanaian friendship and hailed the test-ban treaty as a
 "great victory ."
 Chou's two-day visit to Tunisia, 9-10, brings an agreement to
 establish diplomatic relations -- an intent which Tunis had pro-
 claimed since 1958.  His five-day visit to Ghana brought nothing
 more tangible than a joint statement with Nkrumah endorsing an
 "anti-imperialist conference" of African, Asian and Latin American
 peoples and a conference of the world's heads of government -- if
 convened to sign an international agreement on total nuclear dis-
 armament.   In Bamako on the 16th, Chou was told by President Keita
 that Mali supported the CPR's right to sit in the U.N. Security
 Council.

 that it would henceforth appear weekly instead of fortnightly:  it
 also reported that at a "national congress" on December 22 a
 Walloon Communist Party and a Flemish Communist Party were set up,
 which, together with the Grippa-led Brussels Federation, would be
 "the Belgian Communist Party, reconstituted on the national level
 on the basis of Marxism-Leninism."  Maurice Massoz, leading polit-
 buro member of the dissident group, stated that La Voix is now
 printed in 10,000 copies, of which 2,000 are fob __distribution in
 northeast France.  He also said that it is hoped to produce a
 Flemish edition in early spring.
 Le Drapeau Rouge, daily organ of the old, Soviet-aligned Party,
 has not mentioned these developments, but a spokesman derided
 the claims of the dissidents, saying that "a mere five percent of
 malcontents will not shake out position."
 January 3-6 -- The Swedish Communist Party (SKP) finally held its
 20th congress, resulting in a "new look" for the Party, presum-
 ably designed to give it greater appeal in modern Swedish society.
 Over 300 SKP delegates and numerous foreign guests -- including a
 5-man CPSU delegation led by Ponomarev but no Chinese-line repre-
 sentatives -- attended, and, for the first time, the proceedings
 were public, held in the Parliament Building.   64-year-old H.
 Hagberg, who has been chairman since 1951 and had announced his
 intention to retire, was replaced by 46-year-old C. Hermansson,
 chief editor of the SKP organ Ny Bag, and 11 new, young members
 were elected to the 45-man Party Executive (renamed from Central
 Committee).
 Hermansson had gained a reputation as a reformer, and correspon-
 dents' reports (we have not yet seen a round-up of proceedings)
 indicate at least an outward Party swing in the direction of
 independent national Swedish Communism.  A German reporter states
 Frankfurter  1 gemeine Zeitung     January) that the Party

 "dropped the demand for poletarian dictatorship in favor of a
 parliamentary system" and the old demand for Swedish disarmament
 was replaced by a "people's defense project."  Another (Die Welt,
 Hanburg,same day) reports Hermanason as saying:  "I consider the
 wall an anomaly, an abnormal situation in Germany."
 The dissident, pro-Chinese Swedish Communist Workers League had c:is-
 ti'ibutod  theopmkgoffliho c?r   se 2-page leaflet calling on the SKP to
 repudiate its leaders who have "deserted Marxism and chosen the
 broad and comfortable road of reforms" and return to the revolutionar;~
 struggle for Communism.   In his opening speech, Hagberg accused the
 Chinese of "spreading the poison of doubt and dissension" in the
 WCM and of apparently "placing the national interests of China before
 world peace," and no one spoke up in support of the Chinese line,
 although E. Gustafsson objected to Hagberg's mention of China because
 "our congress should not be a forum for criticism of any fraternal
 party."
 January 7 - Khrushchev returns to Moscow after his "hunting trip"
 visit with Gomulka:  the major purpose for the visit was presumably
 discussion of the problems facing the international Communist move-
 ment, though no conclusions or formal agreements were reported.   In
 Paris, the FCP organ L'Humanite  published a joint declaration of
 the French and Spanish CP's, agreed on at a meeting in December,
 which declared their indignation at "the divisionist attempts fomenter
 by the leaders of the CCP between and within fraternal parties of
 various countries," condemned "the violent attacks directed by the
 CCP against the CPSU, its leaders, and other Communist parties which
 defend the line approved by the international Communist movement,"
 and declared their support for an international conference to help
 consolidate unity.  And in Tokyo, the Asahi Evening News reports
 that the Japanese Socialist Party will send a mission to the USSR in
 March  at the invitation of the CC          The paper comments that
 "the JSP has recently moved closer to Communist Chinese ideology,
 but the Soviet talks are expected to bring it closer to Russian
 policy, particularly with regard to the peace movement."
 January 8 - Reuters i.; Moscow reports that the "latest issue avail-
 le here" of Problems of Peace and Socialism carries an article
 attacking the Chinese press for "recognizing as genuine Communist
 revolutionaries" various weak splitter groups of dissidents who are
 subverting the unity of a party, while at the same time they are
 unilaterally and arbitrarily branding as revisionists, aides of im-
 perialism, and even its direct agents, "such militant detachments
 of the revolutionary movement as the Communist parties of the USA,
 Italy, France, Spain, Chile, Iraq, India and many others."   Whatever
 revolutionary views are propagated by the splinter groups, the article
 says, they in fact play only one role:  "They serve as an instrument
 of the bourgeoisie in the struggle against Communism.    The article
 calls on all parties to oppose such activity, repeats a call for an
 end to polemics, and speaks of a conference of all CP's "after care-
 ful preparation."   It is signed jointly by Vaclav Slavi~b, member of
 the Czech Party CC, Norman Freed, candidate member of the Canadian
 CC, and Murad Kuwatly, a Syrian publicist.  And a London Observer,

 munist trade unionists for capitalist bosses."  "Their case is
 sponsored by the Ceylon Trade Union Federation, over which pro-
 China Communists ass assumed command after a pitched battle at the
 recent annual meeting."
 January 9 - Borba, Belgrade, carries an article by its Moscow
 correspondent Bayalski who notes that two and a half months
 have elapsed since Khrushchev proposed to Peking to stop public
 polemics -- for the third time in recent years -- and "for as
 long as 70 days so far" the Soviet side has been refraining from
 writing or publishing replies to the Chinese, who "continue
 launching assaults on the entire political line of the CPSU".
 "People in Moscow think that this is an alarming situation and
 one which demands an analysis of F_       further intentions."
 January 10 - A UPI London dispatch (carried by Washington Post
 Jan. 12  stated that North Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh "was
 reported today to have fallen out of favor with Red China's
 rulers in an apparent split clouding relations between the Asian
 neighbors."  The article cited "informed Communist reports reach-
 ing here" to the effect that Ho "had cooled to the political
 and ideological strategy of the Peking regime" and that "the
 Mao regime" has sought to isolate Ho in an effort to keep its
 hold on the rest of the North Vietnamese Communist hierarchy.
 January 12 -- A Peking People's Daily editorial denouncing the US 11 role in Panama jabs at the Soviets:  "How strange, then, that
 some who call themselves Marxist-Leninists actually applaud
 Johnson's State of the Union message."
 January 13 -- Castro unexpectedly arrives in Moscow at the
 height of the Panama-USA crisis, but no connection between the
 two events is admitted.  A Cuban La Prensa article says that
 Castro's talks with the Soviet boss will very likely deal with
 the international Communist movement and the entire world sit-
 uation.   In Rome, a left-wing band of rebels bolted from Nenni's
 Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and formed a new "Socialist Party
 of Proletarian Unity" (PSIUP) with Tullio Vecchietti as General
 Secretary.  Although the break came primarily in protest against
 Nenni's cooperation in the Moro government, it appeared that the
 line of the new party would be more in harmony with the Chinese
 than with the Italian or Soviet Communists.

 and it has not been carried by any domestic media, as far as
 we know.   In a remarkably outspoken press conference in Rome, 4
 top Italian CP National Executive members outline plans for a

 importance and power to regional committees, are admittedly in
 response to a drop in Party membership over the last 10 years
 from 2,145,000 to 1,615,000 and in Communist Youth Federation
 membership from 431,000 to 172,000.  The four also made a fresh

 organizations of the working class," including not only the
 Socialist and Social Democrats but also the Christian Democrat
 labor groups.  On the same day, a PCI delegation led by Togliatti

 In doing everything to meet the material and spiritual

 "comrades abroad wr o say that Khrushchev is not managing
 things in the right way, that he is afraid of war," and that
 "there were people who began criticizing us for placing the
 rockets (in baba) and then taking them away," but the

 731.  The Soviet Succession Problem
 25X1C10b
 BACKGROUND:  The assassination of President Kennedy called
 to mind'a universal problem -- that of providing for a smooth
 transfer of power in the event that a national leader dies.
 Dress discussion, particularly in the Near East and Latin America,
 noted the smooth transition from John F. Kennedy to Lyndon
 Johnson and privately, many heads of government (and their
 possible successors) must have wondered what would happen in
 the event of their own sudden death.  There are a large number
 of leaders who would be poor life insurance risks, and most of
 them could not be so smoothly and easily replaced:  e.g.,
 de Gaulle, Nehru, Haile Selassie, Jomo Kenyatta, Sukarno, Mao,
 Salazar, Tito, Franco, Gomulka, Ho Chi Minh, and rrushchev,
 who will be 70 next April.
 Nowhere is the succession problem more acute than in the
 Soviet  neon, the leading nation in   e so-ca  a  "socialist
 camp."  Since the USSR is armed with advanced weapons and since
 it exercises political influence throughout the world, the ques-
 tion of who rules in the Kremlin concerns everyone.  A highly
 irrational individual (like Hitler, for example) could, as Soviet
 dictator, destroy civilization.  Yet the Soviet succession is
 in no way assured.
 Under present conditions, a succession crisis is practi-
 cally a built-in feature of the Soviet system,  There is  y now
 a certain more or less established way to win a Soviet succes-
 sion struggle:  as the system has worked thus far, the victor
 is likely to be the man who is most successful in building a
 personal machine within the CPSU.  This was how Stalin managed
 to  0  ow Lenin, an  how .  rus   ev managed to fallow Stalin.
 But no ruling dictator knowingly permits anyone else to build
 up a personal machine during his lifetime -- they might not
 wait for him to die naturally before seizing power.   (If there
 are favored heirs apparent, like Malen_kov under Stalin or
 Erezhnev at present, it is a pretty safe bet that they are with-
 out organized support.)  Thus, unless as in Lenin's last years
 the old dictator is physically or mentally unable to maintain
 close control, possible successors have no opportunity to build
 up a really strong group of vassals until the old man dies.  At
 that time, the personal factions have to be organized from
 scratch.  Hence there is likely to be a period of instability,
 during which rivals maneuver for position.
 The succession crisis following Lenin's death lasted
 approximately seven years (1923-1930); that following Stalin's
 death lasted approximately four years (1953-1957) -- at least
 as it now appears.  But Khrushchev finally won out only by
 appealing to lower-ranking supporters over the heads of the
 "anti-Party group," and he has never secured the unquestioned

 leadership which Stalin held.  For one thing, Khrushchev has
 failed to retain unchallenged leadership of the world Communist
 movement.      For another, signs continue to appear showing a
 degree of domestic opposition to Khrushchev's wishes.  For
 examp e:
 --Molotov tried to submit an article contrary
 to Khrushchev's position in April 1960, and
 in 1961 is said to have attacked the CPSU 20
 Year grogram in a letter to the Central Com-
 mittee.   (See BPG #563, 27 August 1962)
 --At the 22nd Congress in :L961, A.F. Kirilenko
 (identified as a Khrushchev supporter) lost
 candidate Presidium member status while I.J.
 Spiridonov (believed to be allied with Frol
 Kozlov) became a party Secretary; in April 1962,
 however, Kirilenko was promoted to full member
 of the CPSU Presidium and Spiridonov was
 transferred to a purely ceremonial job.   (BPG
 #543, 16 July 1962)
 --Although Khrushchev had lately described
 Yugoslavia as "socialist," instead of
 "revisionist," the original 1963 Soviet May
 Day slogans, published on 0 April 1963, failed
 to say that in Yugoslavia -- as in the case
 of all the other Communist countries -- the
 people were "building socialism"; the "error"
 was corrected three days later.
 --Just recently, at the December 1963 plenum,
 the goal for fertilizer production for 1970
 was announced as 70-80 million tons, instead
 of the 100 million tons Khrushchev had advo-
 cated a short time before.
 Despite such signs of opposition, there is no strong
 successor in sight, and it is difficult to pre ict what would
 happen if 1thrushchev died.  Frol Kozl.ov (age 55), the heir
 apparent until last April, has repot ecTly suffered either a
 stroke or a crippling heart attack, and apparently is out of
 the running, although he is still officially Second Secretary
 of the CPSU, and a member of the CPSU Presidium.  Leonid Ilich
 Brezhnev (57), the current "coming man," has in recent years
 been mostly involved with his ceremonial duties as the Soviet
 Chief of State (Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet).
 It is rumored that he has suffered two heart attacks; if true,
 this would mean medically that a third, possibly fatal attack
 was quite likely.  Aleksei Nikolaevich Kosygin (59), perhaps
 the next in line, has lately had the appearance of ill-health,
 and Anastas Mikoyan (68), Mikhail Suslov (61), and Otto Kuusinen
 (32) are all aand reportedly in -poor health.  N.M.    verni

 official, involving little exercise, an excess of food and drink,
 long and irregular hours, and a constant atmosphere of anxiety,
 is about as unhealthy as could be devised.   If we note that the
 average age of the twelve CPSU Presidium members is 62, this
 scarcely gives an adequate idea of the effective age of these
 men.
 Nikolai V. Podgorny, an outspoken Irushchevite, seems to
 be, after Brezhnev, a man to watch.  Recently he has attended
 functions relating to world Communist activities, perhaps in
 order to gain the international experience and contacts he
 sorely lacks.  But at 60, he is hardly young; his past experi-
 ence is in food industry and Ukrainian party affairs. L.P.
 Ilyichev, who has cut a mediocre figure at recent party cultural
 concaves, is 58.  Beneath the older generation, there are few
 young hopefuls in sight.  Men like Dmitri Stepanovich Polyansky
 (45: agricultural affairs), Petr Nikolaevich Demichev (45: Party
 Secretary), and AN. Shele in (45: formerly in Komsomol activities
 and former chief of the KGB) are exceptional, and play minor
 roles, usually as specialists in some field.
 The dearth in young talent may be partly explained by the
 terrible Soviet population losses due to the Civil War, forcible
 collectivization, Stalin's terrorism and slave labor camps, and
 World War II.  Had there been no Communism, no Stalin, and no
 war, there would probably be about 20,000,000 more people on the
 present territory of the Soviet Union.   (Actual 1959 population:
 203,226,650)  Young active males were the group hardest hit in
 the 1930's and 1940's, so that over the age of 35, there are
 only three men to every five women.   (Such younger CPSU leaders
 as there are, like Shelepin, avoided extended front-line service
 thanks to their party positions.)  Perhaps, too, there would be
 more young hopefuls if the non-Slavic quarter of the population
 had opportunities equal to those of the Russians and Ukrainians.
 The only full members of the CPSU Presidium who are not Slavs
 are Mikoyan and the ancient Yuusinen, holdovers from Stalin's
 day.
 Thus the outlook for the Soviet Union, despite 7 and 20
 Year plans, is far from clear.  Xhrushchev is not as suspicious
 as Stalin, but he does not give Brezhnev serious responsibilities.
 i2irushchev apparently has a certain earthy appeal, but he has
 never established himself as a Communist theorist or as a great
 revolutionary, and his prospective successors will probably do
 no better in this respect.  Brezhnev's lack of Bolshevik renown
 is likely, among other things, to make it still harder to retain
 control of foreign Communist parties.
 Perhaps Peking is the greatest problem facing the Kremlin.
 Those Soviet leaders most likely to be able to patch up relations
 with China are precisely those who are now out of the running:
 Kozlov and Suslov (we need hardly mention Molotov).  Compared
 with Mao Tse-tung, Liu Shao-chi, or Chou En-lai, the potential
 Soviet leaders are inferior in experience and personal prestige.

 What they will do is of course not now known.  Quite possibly
 these men will continue and develop Khrushchev's policies,
 because none of them seems to have Stalin's or Mao's tendency
 to ignore or flout realities.  Economic, social, and military
 realities dictate policies of increased investment in agricul-
 ture, increased emphasis on chemicals, increased contacts with
 the West, increased resort to the "peaceful coexistence" slogan,
 and the prevention of the dissemination of nuclear weapons.
 Peking, however, is unlikely to approve of these policies.

 732 EE,FTB,d.  Soviet Balance-of-Payment Difficulties               25X1C10b
 BACKGROUND:  As first reported in the New York Times of
 S January  303 Press Comment, S January), economic analysts in
 the Central Intelligence Agency conclude that growth in Soviet
 gross national product amounted only to 2.5 per cent in 1362
 and 1363, and that Soviet gold reserves have fallen to less than
 $2 billion.  According to a news story datelined London, appear-
 ing in the 17ashington post on 19 January (Press Comment, 21 Janu-
 ary), British officials estimate 1962 and 1933 Soviet   d? growth
 at 3 to 3.5 per cent and agree with the $2 billion gold reserve
 estimate (though they draw different conclusions from these
 figures).   CIA*s estimates met with disbelief in certain quar-
 ters, especially in those which are suspicious of CIA's motives,
 those which wish to extend credits to the Soviet Union, or those
 who (like Moscow) want to pretend that the USSR represents the
 "wave of the future."
 The CIA figure on GIP will not be discussed here (see
 Briefly Noted).  This guidance takes up instead the Soviet need
 for loans and the dangers involved in any such loans.  The de-
 cline in Soviet gold reserves is significant mainly as a symptom
 of more general economic problems, especially of a difficulty in
 marking exports and services sold to foreigners match imports and
 other expenses abroad.  When a country cannot pay for its imports
 or foreign expenses in some other way, and cannot defer payment
 by borrowing, that country (if it does not default) must export
 gold--hence gold exports serve as a signal of difficulties.  The
 US itself has had some difficulties in this field in recent
 years, even though our merchandise exports exceed our imports,
 largely because we have been spending heavily abroad on foreign
 aid and in particular on free world defenses.
 Soviet apologists counter-attack by stressing US payments
 difficulties, and they may also claim to have an export surplus.
 On paper, and according to Soviet figures, the USSR did have an
 export surplus in 1962.  Their trouble is that many  Quiet ex-
 ports went to "soft currency" countries (i.e., countries whose
 currency is not acceptable everywhere at par) where payment is
 sometimes slow and almost always in barter; an excess of exports
 to these countries does not help the USSR to pay for imports from
 industrially-advanced, hard currency countries.  And it is these
 imports of advanced equipment that Moscow needs if it is to over-
 come its agricultural difficulties without serious sacrifices in
 its military and other heavy industry programs.  (See attachment)
 It is not true that the USSR is unable to construct techni-
 cally advanced equipment, although Soviet propagandists like to
 pretend that this is the view of "US reactionary circles," so

 that they can ynocka down a straw man with references to cosmon-
 auts, etc.  The point is rather that the  remlin would like to
 borrow abroad so that it can buy abroad without sacrificing any
 of its programs.  Also, Soviet leaders do not want to admit that
 their system is unable to solve its problems by itself, and for-
 eign credits provide an inconspicuous way of getting foreign aid.
 Large foreign credits would enable them simultaneously to make
 needed expenditures on agriculture, to continue large-scale in-
 vestment in industry,   and to stay in the arms and space races.
 Such credits will of course come due later, but Soviet officials
 are inclined to let the future take care of itself.
 Thus loans or credits give aid to the USSR in its competi-
 tion with the West.  Yet many western businessmen and some
 western governments are ready to extend such credits.  These
 people are primarily interested in selling goods to the Soviets,
 and in some cases (as for example in British shipbuilding) such
 sales might help to solve local unemployment problems and make
 governments more popular.  Partly as rationalization, and partly
 because they really gauge the situation differently, these ele-
 ments question the seriousness of the Soviet predicament and
 argue that trade will bring about better East-West relations.
 A."fat Russian," they say, is apt to be peaceful.  They are in-
 clined to thin: that US efforts to bar long-term credits are
 motivated either by rabid and outdated anti-Soviet mania, or by
 a desire to reserve some of this market for the US itself.
 Sometimes exponents of trade with the Soviets try to use US
 grain sales as an argument:   "If the US can sell the Russians
 wheat, why can't we sell them machinery?"
 The US has no desire to inflict suffering on the Soviet
 citizen and does not consider cash wheat sales comparable with
 sales on credit of advanced equipment--which help the Soviet
 loaders stay in the arms race, and assist them in attempts to
 "overtake and surpass" the West.  Past experience indicates that
 the Soviet leaders will resume their threats and aggressive
 gambits as soon as they are able.   It is hardly realistic to
 believe that they would be grateful in the future for long-term

 (Note:  At present, on a small volume of trade, Soviet
 exports to several Western European countries, including the
 U:C, France, and Italy, exceed imports from them.  This condi-
 tion is accentuated at the moment by a Soviet cut-back on
 imports of machinery in order to concentrate on grain purchases
 from non-European areas.  But these export surpluses do not
 represent a normal Soviet ability to pay for large volumes of
 European industrial imports (or to repay large  oans financing
 such imports) by exports to Europe.  Most of the Soviet exports
 to Europe are in raw materials, fuel and (in good years) food,
 and this trade cannot expand rapidly, both supply and demand
 being inelastic.  Machinery might seem more promising, but as
 already noted there are difficulties in providing good quality
 and service; out of total Soviet exports of machinery and equip-
 ment in 1962 amounting to $1325 billion, only 2 per cent or
 $25 million was sold to the industrial free world, the  rest
 going to less-developed and bloc countries.  Exports of all
 hinds to the industrial west were $1.1 billion.  As noted in
 attachment, the over-all Soviet deficit in hard currency that
 year was $350 million, and may be double  that figure for 1963.
 If the USSR borrowed $500 million a year in five per cent ton
 year credits, and did not default, they would after 1922 have to
 pay bath. $612 million a year.just to keep their debt from
 increasing.)                     4

 733 WE,e.   Specter of a New Popular Front in France
 25X1C10b
 The Making of the First Popular Front.   In 1932,
 before the emergence In   ance of the  opu ar   ont, the PCF
 was a hopelessly isolated minority having but 10 of some 500
 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
 At the beginning of 1934 France was suffering the worst
 phase of a great economic depression, while uncertainly ruled
 by its fifth government in 18 months.  Moreover, there was much
 during the year 1034 which suggested to European Liberals and
 Socialists that -- since Hitler had come to power -- in many
 countries civil liberties and democratic institutions were
 threatened.  The Austrian Socialist Party was suppressed in
 February 1034.  Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss was murdered in
 Vienna in July, just after the Nazis had revealed their ruth-
 lessness, treachery and brutality by the murder of Roehin and
 Schleicher.  In October a rising of Socialist miners in the
 Asturias was harshly put down by the new Spanish Republic. The
 feeling that things were taking a rapid turn for the worse was
 intensified by Germany's open rearmament and by the Italian
 attack on Ethiopia the following year.  Thus, for the two years
 from 1034 to 1936, it looked as if the people of Europe were
 taking sides for a great struggle between democracy and dictator-
 ship.   And when the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1036
 (some four months after Hitler's remilitarization of the
 Rhineland) it seemed to many people that the battle had already
 begun.
 The Paris riots of 6 Feb 1934 were one of a series of
 events which led to the formation of the Popular Front, partial-
 ly in reaction to the possibility of a Right-wing dictatorship.
 The Communists were finally realizing that National Socialism
 was not just a phase in the death-throes of capitalism and they
 were gradually abandoning their refusal to ally themselves
 openly with any other European party in opposing Fascism.   In
 France there seemed to be a need for a broadly-based coalition
 to resist Fascism as well as to bring about long-overdue social
 reforms.  Thus, in the course of 1034 the French Socialist Party
 (SFIO) and the PCF drew closer together and on 27 August 1934
 they signed the United Actions Pact, which could be called the
 formal beginning of what came to be known as the Front Commun.

 There followed lC months of tough, suspicious negotiations
 between the C"10 and the Pte, interrupted more than once because
 of continuing insults and polemics in the Communist press against
 the SFIO.  The SFIO had no clear program for relations with the
 PC?; but the ?CF had clear instructions from Moscow: they were to
 weaken the SFIO from below by attacks on its leaders, and they
 were to make sure that any joint action was under Communist  ti
 leadership.   In l'Fuumanite of 20 March 1934 Thorez declared,   it
 is under the direc bon ?i the Communist party, in spite of and
 in the face of the SFIO, that fighting unity between Communist
 and Socialist proletarians will be forged."  Thorez was parti-
 cularly bitter against those leaders on the left of the SFIO
 who showed signs of taking the leading place in the movement for
 working-class unity which the Communists had reserved for them-
 selves.  The SFIO sought continuously and vainly to achieve a
 definite plan of joint action for specific ends, feeling that
 only when agreement was reached on a detailed program of reforms
 and their theoretical basis was there any sense in discussing
 the creation of a united party to put them into action.  The
 Communists wanted nothing so specific.   SFIO leader Leon alum
 expressed the grave misgivings and suspicions of the Socialists
 when he wrote that "the current towards unity might be trans-
 formed into a current toward Communism."  However, the SFIO was
 under great popular pressure for progress toward some form of
 working-class unity.  For example, in September of 1935 the
 national councils of the two trade union movements, the non-
 Communist C.G.T. and the Communist C.G.T.U., reached agreement
 on the terms under which they could fuse the two organizations,
 after negotiations as long and as complicated as those between
 the two political parties.  Another notable evidence of the
 success of Communist party tactics was their comparative gains
 over the SIO in various local elections.
 During this period Stalin decided to seek some diplomatic
 agreement with the West in order to resist Hitler.  Laval went
 to Moscow and on 2 May 1935 signed a Franco-Russian alliance.
 Whereas only two years earlier the Comintern Executive Committee
 had rebuked the ?CF for flirting with the Socialists, the
 Seventh World Congress of the Communist International (Comintern)
 met in Moscow in July-August 1935 and reversed policy by putting
 the official seal of approval on anti-Fascist united fronts in
 France and elsewhere.
 On 22 January 1936 the Laval Government fell,   In ,larch
 Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland; a fortnight later on 20
 March 1936 the French Chamber of Deputies was dissolved and the
 electoral campaign began in earnest along lines agreed to in
 advance by the SFIO and 13C?.  On the first ballot the voters had
 a choice of  fight-wing or popular Front candidates.     In the end
 the Communists gained 62 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, thus
 advancing to a strength of 72 seats as compared to their 1932
 strength of 10.   While the SFIO received almost the same number
 of popular votes as they had in 1932 (some 1,900,003), the PC?
 received 1,503,000 as compared with 794,000 in 1932.

 After the elections in 1936 a wave of industrial agitation
 broke out at once.  The PCF refused to participate in the new
 cabinet, preferring to have the advantages of the electoral vic-
 tory without its responsibilities.   In mid-1936 two great waves
 of "stay---in" strikes broke out in which the workers "occupied"
 major factories. The first was a short one at the end of May,
 and then came a much vaster one, which reached its climax on
 June 7, but took weeks and months to subside.  On June 3 over a
 million people were on strike in France; the engineering indus-
 try and building trades of the Paris region came almost com-
 pletely to a standstill.  Workers' demands varied from one
 improvised strikers' committee to another.  The new Blum govern-
 ment promised to table Bills concerning working hours, collec-
 tive contracts and holidays, while appealing to the workers to
 observe discipline and to employers to treat the dispute in a
 broad-minded spirit.  The PCF leaders assumed the role of the
 Great Victors.  Thorez proclaimed the "new legality" and said
 if the workers took good care of the plants during the stay-in
 strikes, it was because "the factories would soon be the property
 of the workers, anyway."  France went up to her ears in debt;
 interest rates were high; and the increased costs of production
 only aggravated her already existing handicaps as an exporter.
 In spring of 1937 new strikes and rioting broke out, and in June
 the Bourse crashed to the lowest levels since the panic days of
 1926.  The Popular Front government of Leon Blum fell that month.
 Orthodox economists and those who remember the climate of
 the ::popular Front of 1936-37 agrco that its policies were catas-
 trophic for France.   In 1935 Paul Reynaud had the ugly task of
 destroying the peaceful illusion of the Popular Front and pro-
 claiming the end of the "two-Sunday week."  The "national reac-
 tion" of autumn, 1933 was directed in part at the PCF and its
 submissiveness to Moscow, but was above all a pretext for taking
 a ruthless revenge for the havoc that the Popular Front had done
 in the social field.
 Current Problems in France.  Superficially there are certain
 parallels between today's situation and the one which persuaded
 the SF10 and other factions to join forces with the PCF thirty
 years ago.  Many are opposed to the increasingly autocratic
 nature of the government; the desire for the defeat of do Gaulle
 puts the SFIO on common ground with the PCF on this issue.
 Internally there is a threat of increasing labor unrest caused
 by mounting inflation.  French government relations with totali-
 tarian states (Peking and Moscow) are once more in a state of
 flux and a cause for alarm to many Frenchmen.  And again the
 SFIO is seeking earnestly for a constructive modus vivendi with
 the French Communists, apparently forgetting past lessons on the
 absolute fallacy of such aspirations.  Thus the press reveals
 an SF10 leadership disagreeing among themselves and with other
 Socialist parties; the SFIO leadership visiting iOirushchev in
 Moscow at the request of the CPSU; the SFIO declaring that they
 will not reject Communist assistance if it will contribute to
 the defeat of do Gaulle, but that the only basis for any perma-
 nent collaboration between the SFIO and PCF is the PCP's adoption

 and implementation of the democratic pre-conditions defined by
 the SFIO; the SFI0 saying they reject the Communist tactic of
 concealing from the electorate the issues which divide the
 SFIO from the PCF and keeping before their respective followers
 only the issues which tend to unite them; and the SFIC declar-
 ing they will not support the establishment of another popular
 Front.  While not openly endorsing another Popular Front, the
 PCF would of course, welcome a reenactment of the events of
 1234-37 under any slogan or pretext.  For example, in the party's
 official organ, l'l-iumanite, on 16 January 1964, the PCT' made
 public proposed changes in party statutes to be put before the
 Central Committee at the party's congress in Lille next spring.
 These changes are principally designed to further an anti-
 do Gaulle alliance with the SFYO and are made to sound like a
 major liberalization of doctrine.  The pronouncements include
 statements that the PCF rejects "the idea that the existence of
 a single party is a necessary condition for the passage to
 Socialism," that the PCF can now foresee a peaceful way to
 Socialism, and that henceforth the election of (certain of) the 25X1C1Ob
 party's committees would be carried out by secret ballot.

 B.ACsGROUND :  Accompanied by Foreign Minister Chen Yi and
 an entourage o  74 premier Chou En-tai's two-month African trip
 is a high level effort to end Communist China's isolation and
 increase its international influence.  Chou's trip may be seen
 to be inspired by the desire for gains in three fields, namely:
 1.  To enlarge China's position on the Communist world
 map at the expense of the Soviet  nion  y:  peal bng her own
 uorc:er claims against Soviet-supported India; calling for
 another Bandung-type conference of Afro-Asian governments (with-
 out USSR and Yugoslavia) which China could dominate, as dis-
 tinguished from the Belgrade-type non-aligned states conference
 favored by many African statesmen; labelling as false Moscow's
 claim to be opposed to the Afro-Asian proposal for enlarging
 the U.N. Security Council because China haR not been admitted
 to the U.N.
 2.  To obtain increased diplomatic recognition which could
 also be turned in o vote   or  p  s bid to the       Of the 35
 African countries now in the 113-member UN, 14* recognize Commu-
 nist China; 20** recognize the Government of the Republic of
 China, a permanent member of the Security Council.   In October
 1E63 $IOUI General Assembly voted 57 to 41 against admitting
 Communist China and ousting Nationalist China.
 3.  To increase her influence in developing areas by per-
 sonal diplomacy where her own domestic economic failures have
 limited her ability to persuade by aid or trade.

 ably given an astute performance and has made a favorable
