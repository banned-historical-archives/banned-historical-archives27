 China's Anticorruption Campaign:  A Threat to Reforms?
 Summary
 The much-publicized growth of corrupt activities among Chinese
 officials has forced reformist leaders to reassert central control
 over some types of spending and commodity distribution.  Measures
 announced at the recent session of the National People's Congress
 (NPC) are intended to prevent speculation in scarce goods, payment of
 excessive bonuses, and unauthorized price hikes -- the so-called
 unhealthy practices China.
 We believe the reformists themselves initiated the anticorruption
 drive, but conservative critics have used the issue to attack the
 reform program.  The reformists appear to retain the upper hand and
 have declared the problem to be "receding," but at the cost of having
 to criticize some of their own reform initiatives.  We believe that
 although the reforms have not suffered a serious setback, the specter
 of corruption will probably slow further reforms in enterprise
 autonomy and in the marketing of scarce goods.  The recently announced
 measures probably will curtail the most flagrant malfeasance, but
 cadre corruption will continue to be a problem for Beijing as  '

 Unhealthy Practices
 For the past four months, Chinese domestic press reporting and leadership
 statem
 t
 h
 en
 s
 ave been dominated by calls to eliminate so-called "unhealthy
 practices" -- activities that include cases of individual corruption,
 bureaucratic malfeasance, and degenerate social practices.  Unlike earlier
 crackdowns on crime, the drive to eliminate these practices is aimed at party,
 members
 d
 an
 government officials, including those at relatively high levels.
 The unhealthy practices that have received the greatest attention have been
 those that fuel inflation: unauthorized price hikes, speculation in scarce goods
 by officials, and unjustified raises and bonuses.  These activities, which for a
 period in early 1985 were collectively referred to as the "three new unhealthy
 "
 practices,
 have remained the central targets throughout the campaign.
 Other unhealthy practices cited during the campaign have included throwing
 lavish banquets, supplying free clothing and lunches to workers and staff,
 publishing and selling "unhealthy" tabloids, holding lotteries, giving
 unauthorized promotions, cadre extorting money from collective and individual
 enterprises, setting up new government organs or posts, smuggling and black
 market currency speculation, and falsifying statistics and reports.
 Specific examples include:
 o A municipal party committee in northeastern China set up a trading company
 that made 440,000 yuan by reselling 10,000 tons of steel.
 o The Beijing Discipline Inspection Commission discovered over 160 public
 organizations engaged in trading scarce consumer goods, together making
 131,000 yuan in illegal profits by reselling 6,900 color TVs and 85 cars in
 the last four months of 1984.
 o People's Daily reported that military units in Fujian had set up 19 trading
 companies in late 1984 in violation of central directives. The companies
 had already made over 3.6 million yuan, and had signed contracts worth an
 additional 8 million yuan when they were shut down early this year.
 o A newly established company in Guangdong spent 120,000 yuan on a lavish
 banquet to celebrate its opening.

 Origins of the Campaign
 Concern over corruption has been a constant feature of China's political
 landscape.  One of the objectives of the current party rectification drive,
 under way since late 1981.           to repair such defects in cadre work style
 and party discipline.
 Party leaders foresaw that loosening bureaucratic controls and expanding
 economic opportunities would create possibilities for cadre corruption and
 bureaucratic malfeasance.  A number of specific measures were taken to control
 anticipated abuses.  For example, last August, Central Document (CD) 27 was
 issued, prohibiting officials and government organizations from engaging in
 business activities unless authorized to do so.  CD 27 was circulated at about
 the same time as CD 28 -- the draft of the economic reform document
 uently
 approved by the Central Committee at the October Plenum.
 E
 Hu Yaobang reportedly stated at the October Plenum that taking advantage of
 the reforms for personal gain was "an unhealthy practice ready to emerge."
 Beijing may not have anticipated the scale of abuses, however.  Central concern
 grew as news reports of malfeasance proliferated and as statistics became
 available showing dramatic Jumps in enterprise wages and bonuses and excessive
 growth in credit.
 In  response, party bureaucracies stepped up the drive against unhealthy
 practices.  The Central Commission for Guiding Party Rectification (CCGPR)
 published a document in late November noting that previous efforts to prevent
 unhealthy practices were not enough and that new measures were needed.  In
 December, The Central Discipline Inspection Commission (CDIC) published a
 circular directing discipline inspection units and party committees to focus on
 correcting unhealthy practices.  The State Council issued a directive in late
 December, specifically prohibiting the "indiscriminate issuing of bonuses,
 allowances, or bonuses in kind
 "
 .
 Despite the stream of central documents and high-level lower-level units took a wait-and-see approach              meetings,
 Even Deng Xiaoping complained that officials were ignoring centraloguidelines8on
 curbing unhealthy practices with the attitude that "upper levels have policies
 and lower levels have countermeasures."  Beijing was forced to apply
 extraordinary pressure to get grass-roots units to obey directives.  In late
 February, central authorities convened a meeting of provincial governors,
 ordering them to bring their provinces into line with central directives on
 controlling price hikes and unhealthy practices.  At a joint CCGPR - CDIC work
 conference held from 28 February to 6 March, the elimination of "new unhealthy
 tendencies" and the strengthening of party discipline were declared to be the
 "prominent, important points" of the second stage of party rectification.  Even
 those units that had completed rectification were warned that remedial work
 might be in store to deal  with m

 Closing the Loopholes
 In his work report to the National People's Congress in late March, Premier
 Zhao Ziyang outlined a series of administrative measures intended to close
 loopholes and curb unhealthy practices:
 o Returning distribution of scarce consumer goods to central control by
 "direct advance sales," intended to eliminate speculation in these
 commodities.
 o Placing enterprise wage and bonus funds under bank oversight.
 o Increasing the supervision over issuing credit.
 Additional measures instituted by central authorities to curb unhealthy
 practices include banning lotteries and tightening central control over buying
 These measures appear to contradict some elements of the reform program,
 for example reestablishing bureaucratic oversight over enterprises and putting a
 damper on expanded use of the marketplace for commodity circulation. They
 demonstrate that in many cases Beijing will have to tighten control over
 economic activity and defi7 its limits before decentralization can work
 effectively.
 Beijing has also raised the specter of a crackdown on those who have
 committed economic crimes for personal gain.  In a recent interview, Hu Yaobang
 indicated that as many as 10,000 may be liable for prosecution.  As a recent
 Liaowan  article noted, "The door of reform is wide open, but so is the jail
 door."
 Why Unhealthy Practices?
 The economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping and his proteges created a potent
 mixture of incentives, opportunities, and regulatory gaps that led to the surge
 in unhealthy practices.  Some factors predate the reforms, including shortages
 of4both _consumer goods and essential industrial materials. Others have emerged
 In some cases, malfeasance grew out of ambiguities in the reform program.
 The rush of government bodies to set up trading companies in late 1984 was in
 part a response to central calls to enliven commodity circulation.  Uncertainy
 over how factory managers should use material incentives contributed to the
 growth in bonuses and other rewards.  An early February Renmin Ribao commentary
 25X1

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/02 : CIA-RDP85T01058R000101370001-4
 admitted broadly that "so many new things have emerged, in carrying out reform
 that it is not easy to distinguish right from wrong."
 In our view, another major cause of unhealthy practices has been the
 erosion of party members' traditional prerogatives and authority under the
 reforms.  Despite its insistence that party committees have important tasks in
 carrying out reforms, the national leadership has not fully defined a
 constructive role for local party units.  In addition, cadres are concerned that
 their wages will not keep pace with inflation, at a time when other segments of
 Chinese society are being encouraged to "get rich first."  As a result, many
 cadre have used their political connections to engage in speculation and other
 business activities, often under the guise of carrying out economic reforms.
 Chinese leaders recently noted that the expectation that future enterprise
 wages and bonuses would be based on 1984 levels exacerbated the growth in wages
 and bonuses in late 1984.  Although this is important, the growth in bonuses
 also reflects the egalitarian approach to distribution which remains engrained
 in the Chinese economic system.  In most cases, managers have little incentive
 to resist worker expectation of equal treatment, regardless of individual or
 enterprise performance.  On the contrary, the increasing role of worker
 preference in selecting management prompts factory directors to provide generous
 The creation of Special Economic Zones and other economic regions has
 opened various loopholes, which officials in these areas have been quick to
 exploit.  For example, to promote the development of Hainan, authorities removed
 the import duty on motor vehicles shipped to the island.  Without proper
 oversight, officials used the exemption to import vehicles for resale to other
 parts of China.  Authorities recently confiscated 3,000 vehicles in Wuhan that
 had been imported through Hainan and were being shipped to other points.
 Conservatives vs Reformers?
 We believe reformers initiated the campaign against unhealthy practices as
 part of their effort to control inflation, which they perceive is the greatest
 potential stumbling block to the reform program.  Conservative elements in the
 party nonetheless have played a major role in the campaign's development.  The
 heightened attention to the issue is in part due to the tension between
 conservative and reformist elements, as each camp has sought to establish its
 anticorruption credentials and maneuver the campaign to its advantage.
 Conservatives appear to have gained some ground.  The Central Discipline
 Inspection Commission, headed by Chen Yun, has increased its strength and
 visibility by establishing and pursuing campaign goals. Some conservatives, such
 as propaganda chief Deng Liqun, who have kept a low profile since the "spiritual
 pollution" campaign was cut off in early 1984, have become somewhat more active.
 We have also seen renewed sniping about "spiritual pollution" side effects of

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/02 : CIA-RDP85T01058R000101370001-4
 the reforms.  The spread of unhealthy practices has forced regime spokesmen to
 admit that they over-emphasized the prospect that people could get rich quick
 through the new policies
 .
 Despite such gains, we believe conservatives thus far have not been able to
 use the campaign to their best advantage, and reformers have generally succeeded
 in preventing the campaign from being used to attack the reforms directly.
 o Reformists took the lead in the campaign and have avoided any suggestion of
 personal involvement with corrupt practices or willingness to tolerate such
 practices in others.
 o The reformers have skillfully managed the campaign thus far, allowing
 conservatives to voice their concerns without gaining the initiative.
 o Unhealthy practices could prove to be a double-edged sword in a reformist -
 conservative struggle.  Because the perpetrators are party and government
 cadre, the spread of unhealthy practices has tarnished the image of the
 party and the government bureaucracy.  Conservatives, some of whom may be
 guilty of unhealthy practices as well, probably wish to avoid calling
 attention to this fact.
 Nonetheless, the potential for the campaign to be used to attack elements of the
 reform program still exists, and reformers clearly are anxious to stay ahead of
 the   issuP_
 What's Ahead?
 Beijing is now, in effect, declaring victory, claiming that the high tide
 of unhealthy practice has ebbed.  For example, at a late March press conference,
 Vice premier Yao Yilin stated that unhealthy practices were a "receding
 problem."  In addition, leaders are vigorously defending the reform program,
 claiming that the reforms are in no way responsible for the surge in unhealthy
 practices.
 Hu Yaobang recently announced Beijing is pressing ahead with plans to
 retire elderly cadres and install reform supporters in key leadership slots.  We
 believe the increased attention to the retirement of elderly cadres is in part
 an effort by reform leaders to avoid giving the impression that they have lost
 the initiative or th

 The degree to which reforms have been slowed by unhealthy practices appears
 to be minor.  Nearly all element

 s o
 he reform program remain intact, the
 reformists still have the initiative, and we expect to see continuing movement
 in the crucial
 areas of price and wage reform in the months ahead.

 Reformers can take little consolation from this, however.  Although the
 recently announced administrative measures should put the cap on the most
 flagrant of the inflation-causing unhealthy practices, we believe the problem of
 corruption will persist
 .
 The measures announced at the NPC address specific types of bureaucratic
 malfeasance, but other unhealthy practices remain unchecked.  For example, the
 problem of extorting money or privileges from collective enterprises and
 specialized households -- often mentioned in local media -- will be hard to
 eradicate.  Lacking programmatic measures to deal with such practices, Beijing
 probably will keep a muted anticorruption campaign alive and will continue to
 stress curbing of unhealth
 t
 y prac
 ices in the rectification process.
 We believe the problem of unhealthy practices will be an important limiting
 factor in reforms related to increased enterprise autonomy.  The experiment to
 use capitalist management techniques within China's socialist system has
 stumbled because of the spread of malfeasance, demonstrating that additional
 preparatory work is needed before reforms can take hold in this area.  The
 growth of corruption probably will also slow the pace of reforms in commodity
 distribution.  The surge in speculation and profiteering has demonstrated the
 problem Beijing faces in lifting controls   er scarce  oods
 g     , particularly in the
 face of growing consumer demand,
 ~         :7
 The unhealthy practices episode appears to have reconfirmed reform leaders'
 belief that successful party rectification is the key to economic reform.  We
 expect to see them continue their efforts to restructure the party from within,
 retiring elderly members and recruiting educated cadre who will be able to
 function as expert managers in the reformed economy.         As long as the party's
 role in the reform program remains poorly defined, however, leaders must expect
 that lower-level cadre will continue to hinder
 f
 re
 orm efforts, either through
 negligence, lack of understanding, or intentional abuse of their prerogatives.
