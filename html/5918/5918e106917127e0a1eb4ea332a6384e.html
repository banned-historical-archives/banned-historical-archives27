 1 JULY 1970
 INDOCHINA
 Initial Vietnamese communist reaction to President Nixon's
 30 June report on the two-month U.S..operation in Cambodia
 comes on 1 July in a Hanoi radio commentary which say: the
 report shows that the Administration is bent ::r pursuing its
 "aggression" despite "serior.,- military defeats" throughout
 Indochina and political isolation.  Hanoi and Front comment
 on the eve of the final troop withdrawal from Cambodia cited
 the continuing U.S. air strikes and the ARVN presence as
 evidence of aggression and went so far as to charge that U.S.
 troops may be sent back in.
 Moscow reacts typically with a brief' TASS dispatch on the 30th
 describing the President's report as an effort to justify the
 United States' "invasion."  Noting that the President said he
 seeks a negotiated settlement in Vietnam, TASS interjects the
 remark that "despite rumors" he failed to announce the appoint-
 ment of a high-level representative at the Paris talks.
 The day before the President's report was made public, VNA
 released a communique from the "Defense Ministry" in Sihanouk's
 government rounding up alleged feats of the Cambodian
 "patriots" during the past three months, including attacks on
 12 out of 19 provincial capitals and the complete "liberation"
 of four of them.  A Sihanouk statement publicized on the 30th
 claims that "many" provinces are now totally controlled and
 lists five.  Earlier references to the cutting off of Phnom
 Penh are repeated, and Liberation Radio on the 26th says the
 Lon Nol-Matak regime is worried about the prospect of an
 attack on the capital.
 Sihanouk concluded his state visit to North Korea on 1 July
 after having participated in the events marking the 20th
 anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War.  Chinese speakers
 at the anniversary observances repeated the implicit criticism
 of Soviet policy expressed in Peking's 25 June joint editorial--
 "certain persons" are even "maintaining dirty relations with
 Lon Nol and his like."  Moscow has ignored the Chinese attack,
 but routine Soviet comment co.itinues to score the PRC for block-
 ing joint communist action on Indochina.
 PRESIDENTS 30 JUNE REPORT, CAMBODIAN POLICY SCORED
 HANOI AND     The 1 July Hanoi radio commentary on President
 THE FRONT     Nixon's report on the U.S. operation in Cambodia
 says the President continued to "boast" of
 victories and released statistics on "booty seized from the
 enemy."  But it  losses over the fact that the targets were

 1 JULY 1970
 Vietnamese communist sanctuaries and speaks only of "aggression"
 against Cambodia.  A 29 June Hanoi radio commentary discussing
 the U.S. withdrawal mentions the objective of "capturing the
 communist command staff on Cambodian territory and launching
 search-and-destroy missions," but it implies that the communists
 are Cambodian and makes no re:  rence to any Vietnamese role.*
 Hanoi's comment on the President's report echoes earlier prop-
 aganda in seeing evidence of continued U.S. "aggression" in the
 fact that U.S. air strikes will continue, that ARVN forces
 will remain in Cambolia, and that other "mercenaries" will be
 sent.  Comment prior to the release of the report had charged
 that the President plans to return U.S. troops to Cambodia after
 their withdrawal at the end of June.  Most notably, a 25 June
 NHAN DAN article, publicized by Hanoi radio and VNA, calls
 attention to the 22 June Pentagon acknowledgment of U.S. air
 strikes in Cambodia beyond the 21-mile limit for U.S. ground
 operations and cites press reports that U.S. pl,~.nes are flying
 combat-support missions in Cambodia and that B-52's are being
 used there.
 The paper claims that the decision to expand the air raids was
 taken to shore up the Lon Nol regime and Saigon forces in the
 face of the U.S. withdrawal., as well as to "maintain the
 presence of direct U.S. military action in that country in
 order to provide for a later return of U.S. troops."  The
 article says that the "punishment" of U.S. "agg'::essors" in
 Vietnam was used as an excuse to invade Cambodis and that "if
 U.S. pilots are killed in Cambodia, Nixon will not hesitate
 *  Hanoi and Front propaganda has been inconsistent regarding
 the Vietnamese communist presence in Cambodia.  The 2 May DRV
 Government statement on the President's 30 April speech referred
 only to his "slanders" against the DRV, while the PRG statement
 on the same occasion said the President "slanderously accused
 the DRV and PRG of waging aggression against Cambodia."  Some
 comment following the President's 3 June TV speech acknowledged
 his reference to Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, with some
 items going so far as to ridicule his failure on that occasion
 to mention the objective of "razing VC headquarters"--for
 example, Hanoi radio on the 4th, QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on the 5th,
 and NHAN DAN on the 12th.  A NHAN DAN commentary on the 5th
 said that the President's real aim was to save the Lon Nol
 regime from collapse..  See the TRENDS of 10 June, pages 1-2.

 to use the piratic right to act freely."  NHAN DAN buttresses
 this judgment by citing a comment in the 1 June issue of
 U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT to the effect that "in November
 and December when the rainy season ends, President Nixon
 again must decide whether to return U.S. troops to Camb dia."
 A 28 June Liberation Radio commentary also raises the question
 of the return of U.S. troops to Cambodia and, like NHAN DAN,
 quotes U.S. NEWS AND WORLD-REPORT as saying that the President
 must decide in November and December about sending U.S. troops
 back across the border.  The commentary goes on to claim that
 the allies have sustained "bitter setbacks" in Cambodia and
 that the "Lon Nol clique" is doomed.   "The Cambodian people's
 patriotic forces," it says,"have developed by leaps and
 bounds, liberating half the country and directing their guns
 at Phnom Penh."
 Sharp attacks on the President appear in the 29 June Hanoi
 radio commentary and in a NHAN DAN article the same day pegged
 to the Senate vote to repeal the Tonkin Gulf Resolution.
 Glossing over the fact that it was pro-Administration Senators
 who moved to bring the resolution to a vote now, NHAN DAN
 says the vote "is indicative of the bitter dispute in the
 U.S. ruling class as a result of heavy U.S. defeats in
 Indochina" and of strong pressure from the antiwar forces.
 The article adds that by the Cambodian action, "Nixon has
 further cast slurs on U.S. honor . .  .  and has appeared
 in his true colors as an international gendarme, a callous
 warmonger who during the Eisenhower Administration urged the
 dispatch of U.S. troops to Vietnam.   He now becomes the most
 protested and most hated President in U.S. history."
 The radio commentary cites a French paper as having said that
 on 30 June the President would be either a vanquished man or
 a liar and sets out to demonstrate that he is both, having
 "failed" in his mission in Cambodia and still pursuing aggression
 against that country.
 MOSCOW     The initial brief TASS report on the President's
 Cambodia report cites tin AP correspondent for the
 observation that the report contained no surprises but was
 the most elaborate explanation to date of the Cambodian move.
 It goes on to note that the U.S. air strikes will continue
 anc? that aid to Lon Nol will be increased.  Another TASS report
 a few hours later repeats this and adds that the ARVN will

 continue its operations.  Both reports note the President's
 support for a political settlement but observe that he said
 nothing about appointing a new U.S. delegation head at Paris
 and that he "repeated threats to the South Vietnamese patriots."
 It is in a commentary in English to the United Kingdom that
 Moscow broaches the question of the Vietnamese presence in
 Cambodia:  The President "tried to whitewash American actions
 when he claimed, contrary to the facts, that aggression
 against Cambodia was unleashed not by the United States but
 by North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front."
 Routine Moscow propaganda during the week stressed that a
 withdrawal of U.S. ground forces on the 30th would not mean
 the end of U.S. action in Cambodia, and there are continuing
 references to the "admissions" by Pentagon spokesmen, Secretary
 Laird, and Secretary Rogers that U.S. air strikes will
 continue throughout the country, that the Saigon troops will
 remain, and that Thai troops will be sent in.  A domestic
 service commentary on the 27th ridicules the background
 briefings of journalists by the President and his advisors in
 San Clemente, calling them part of an "advertising campaign"
 to coax the press into presenting Administration policy on
 Indochina in a favorable light.  The commentary notes that
 representatives of the New York TIMES and the Washington POST,
 among others, were excluded from the briefing because, "not
 wanting to lose subscribers," they have opposed the incursion
 into Cambodia.
 Secretary Rogers' remarks at his Washington press conference
 as well as in California are cited as evidence of U.S. intent
 to pursue "aggression" in Cambodia.  And a domestic service
 commentary by Moscow radio's military analyst Col. Aleksey
 Leontyev on the 28th says Rogers' Asian trip and his participa-
 tion in the SEATO meeting in Manila will be used to seek
 cannonfodder in pursuit of the President's Guam Doctrine of
 "letting Asians fight Asians."  Leontyev points to the likely
 dispatch of Thai troops, and a brief Washington-datelined
 TASS dispatch on the 30th says that Rogers, addressing the
 National Conference of Editors and Broadcasters in
 San Francisco the day before, made the first flat statement
 by a high-ranking U.S. official that Thai troops will wage
 combat operations in Cambodia together with Saigon forces.

 SIFIANOUK      A statement issued by Sihanouk in Pyongyang on
 STATEMENT      30 June, covered in DPRK, DRV, and PRC media,
 denounces the U.S. "deception" of a troop withdrawal

 ground forces from Cambodia by 1 July "a machiavellian maneuver
 by an ambitious politician" to dupe the electorate.  Withdrawal,
 it says, will not efface the "crimes" of the U.S. troops in
 Cambodia, and in any case "Thieu-Ky" troops will continue to
 "occupy" Cambodian territory.  Moreover, it charges, an
 "invasion" by Thai forces will no doubt compensate for the
 withdrawal of American troops.
 The statement says that although President Nixon promised the
 American people "a rapid end" of the Indochina war, his
 aggression in Cambodia has only prolonged it, with the United
 States suffc:...ng "shameful defeats."  It cites Senator Mansfield
 as "confirming" this view and as stating that the "sanctuaries
 of the patriots" are "multiplying" and that "more than half"
 the country has been liberated.
 COMMUNIST CLAIMS OF MILITARY SUCCESS IN CAMBODIA
 COMMUNIQUE FROM         VNA on 29 June carried a 20 June
 "DEFENSE MINISTRY"      communique on communist feats in
 Cambodia during the past three months,
 issued by the Defense Ministry of the Royal Government of
 National Union and distributed by the information bureau of
 the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK).
 The communique claims that the "Cambodian national liberation'
 armed forces" and people have annihilated or captured 25,000
 soldiers of the Lon Nol army and that 20,000 more government
 troops have disbanded.  It further claims that in combat from
 1 May to 20 June they have eliminated nearly 20,.00 U.S. and
 ARVN troops, including nearly 10,000 GI's; shot down nearly
 300 planes; destroyed 1,400 military vehicles, 150 artillery
 pieces and mortars, and 15 war vessels; captured or destroyed
 thousands of tons of ammunition, food, and other military
 supplies; and attacked five of the six corps area headquarters.
 The com..iunique alleges that the forces have attacked 12 of
 the 19 provincial capitals, completely "liberating" four of
 them, and have liberated many townships, district capitals,
 and hundreds of.villages totalling more than one million

 inhabitants, "which form a large liberated zone, solid rear
 bases of the resistance war."  These victories, it says,
 "mark a big stride forward of the Cambodian revolution."
 Acclaiming the establishment of "the democratic power of the
 people" and a "patriotic people's army," the communique
 expresses the confidence of the armed forces in head of
 state and Front chairman Sihanouk and in Penn Nouth, chairman
 of the Front politburo and premier.
 CURRENT     VNA claimed on 27 June that the Cambodian National
 ACTION       Liberation Army (CLNA) had forced the withdrawal
 of government forces from Thbeng Meanchey, the
 capital of Preah Vihear Province, on the 20th and that three
 districts in the province have been "liberated" along with
 the provincial capital.  Feats in Preah Vihear Province are
 also cited in a 28 June VNA commentary on President Thieu's
 27 June speech, which dealt wi+:i Cambodian policy.  The
 commentator says further that AFP on the 27th reported the
 complete liberation of the four northern provinces of Ratanakiri,
 Mondulkiri, Stung Treng, and Kratie.  (Sihanouk's 30 June
 statement adds P:yeah Vihear to this list.)  The commentary
 cites an unidentified Western press dispatch dated 14 Jime
 for the report that half the country is under the control of
 the "Cambodian patriotic forces," that all the main roads to
 Phnom Penh are interdicted, and that the railroad to "Sihanouk
 port" has been mined and cut.  On the 26th, Liberation Radio
 asserted that Phnom Penh was isolated and that "Lon Nol and
 Matak have been very much worried about the prospect that
 Phnom Penh may be attacked."
 ANGKOR WAi     On 25 June NCNA publicized two statements by
 Sihanouk's government on the temples of Angkor.
 The first, dated 23 June, declares that the "national
 liberation armed forces," in conformity with Sihanouk's
 instructions, are protecting the relics of Angkor from pillage
 or use for military purposes.  it charges that allied forces
 have caused the destruction of religious buildings and other
 property elsewhere in Cambodia and that air bombing and
 artillery bombardment by allied forces in the vicinity of
 the temples of Angkor "lready constitute a grave menace of
 destruction of these Khmer historical relics."  The statement
 appeals for the support of world opinion, but adds that "the
 Royal Government of National Union wishes to make it clear
 that it rejects the right of any third country &.1.1d any
 international organization to interfere in Cambodia under the

 deceptive pretext of protecting Cambodia's historical relics."
 The second statement, dated 24 June, refutes an AP report
 that forces of the liberation army are entrenched in the Angkor
 temples.
 VNA reported the two statements on 27 and 28 June.  Hanoi and
 Pathet Lao media had earlier denied news reports that
 Vietnamese communist troops, including Pathet Lac and
 Chinese elements, were quartered in the temple complex.*
 Allied "encroachment" or, the Angkor temple area is also
 scored in a statement by the FUNK information bureau--
 publicized by Hanoi on the 29th--which charges that the
 allies bombed the Udong temple area, the old capital of the
 kingdom of Cambodia, on 26 June.
 PARIS TALKS:  ROUTINE CLAIMS, CHARGES AT 25 JUNE SESSION
 Vietnamese communist media again give cursory and inconsistent
 accounts of the 72d session of the Paris talks on 25 June.
 Thus LPA, but not VNA, in reporting PRG delegate Nguyen Van
 Tien's statement notes his remark that President Nixon's
 pledge to withdraw U.S. troops from Cambodia by 30 June is
 "simply a maneuver to cover up" a U.S. scheme to expand and
 prolong the war.  VNA similarly fails to report DRV delegate
 Nguyen Minh Vy's comments on the President's withdrawal
 pledge, but both accounts note Tien's assertion that the
 United States has ordered the indefinite occupation of
 Cambodia by South Vietnamese forces, is making preparations
 to dispatch Thai "mercenaries" there, and is planning to
 continue to provide air and logistical support for GVN forces.
 The VNA account of DRV delegate Nguyen Minh Vy's statement
 reflects his attack on U.S. delegate Habib's argument at the
 last session that President Nixon's 20 April address was "an
 invitation to negotiate" and showed a "flexible attitude."
 VNA notes that in rebuttal Vy said the Administration still
 insists on a mutual withdrawal and tries to maintain the
 Saigon administration and that he cited U.S. aggressive acts

 which, he charged, belie the U.S. delegate's claim of a
 flexible attitude.  The account records Vy's charge that
 the Nixon Administration "persistently opposed" the NFLSV's
 10-point program, gave priority to Vietnamization, and at
 the same time "downgraded the importance of and thereby
 sabotaged" the Paris talks.  On the other hand, neither the
 VNA nor the LPA account acknowledges Tien's remark casting
 doubt on allied intentions or his pro forma reassertion
 that the NFLSV/PRG 10-point solution is "the honorable and
 safe way out of South Vietnam" for the United States.
 Both the VNA and LPA accounts indicate that Tien devoted the
 major part of his statement to describing the "abominable
 crimes" committed in the GVN's pacification program, but
 they do not mention in this regard that Tien pegged his
 remarks to a recent statement by GVN President Thieu to the
 effect that a "special pacification program" will be
 initiated in South Vietnam effective 1 July.  Tien's
 typically graphic description of alleged GVN and allied crimes
 and atrocities, as well as of the PLAF "victories," are
 partially noted in the accounts.
 Where the VNA accounts of the sessions on the 11th and 18th
 had not given any description of the allied delegates'
 statements, the account of the 25 June session reverts to
 the practice of at least identifying the delegates and giving
 a one-sentence description of thir remarks.  Thus VNA,
 totally obscuring the substance of Lam's address, says that
 he "again resorted to perfidious allegations in an attempt
 to deceive world public opinion, which is condemning the
 United States for expanding the war to the whole of Indochina
 and the Thieu-Ky-Khiem administration for serving as a tool
 of the U.S. aggression."  As for Habib, VNA says he "repeated
 his absurd proposal on 'mutual troop withdrawal' and
 stubbornly rejected the South Vietnamese people's just
 demand that the United States withdraw unconditionally its
 troops from South Vietnam and cast off the Thieu-Ky-Khiem
 administration."
 With no explanation of the context, VNA says at the end of
 its account that in their supplementary speeches Tien and
 Vy "stressed that the so-called Djakarta conference on
 Indochina had been in fact wirepulled by the United States
 with the aim of covering up and justifying the U.S.
 aggressive acts against the Indochinese peoples."

 SIHANOUK CONCLUDES STATE VISIT TO NORTH KOREA
 Continuing his state visit to North Korea, Sihanouk took part
 in the events marking the 20th anniversary of the Korean War.
 He addressed the 25 June Pyongyang city rally aid attended
 several anniversary banquets.  On the 27th, Sihanouk hosted
 a banquet in honor of Kim Il-song at which both leaders spoke
 and which was attended by the PRC, DRV, PRG, and Pathet Lao
 delegations that were in Pyongyang for the anniversary.  Kim
 Il-song hosted a dinner for Sihanouk on the 30th, and Sihanouk
 left the DPRK on 1 July; he was seen off at the railroad
 station by Kim Il-song in a farewell ceremony at which both
 leaders spoke.  KCNA reported on 30 June that a DPRK-Cambodian
 joint statement was signed, but a text is not yet available.
 In his 27 June banquet speech, according to KCNA, Sihanouk once
 again warmly thanked the DPRK for its support, recalling that
 at a 15 June banquet Kim Il-song had promised "active support
 by all necessary means" and that President Choe Yong-kon had
 repeated the promise at a rally on the 18th.  Sihanouk added
 that the Khmers are'also grateful for the support of the PRC,
 Vietnam, and Laos and that the American imperialists cannot
 destroy "this anti-U.S. joint front of the revolutionary peoples
 of Asia."  In a similar vein,, Kim Il-song said Sihanouk's
 visit had "consolidated the friendship and solidarity
 between our peoples on a new basis and cemented still further
 the anti-U.S. common front covering a vast region from Korea
 to China, Vietnam, Laos, and popular and anti-imperialist
 Cambodia."  He again promised the Cambodians continued moral
 and material "active assistance."

 that the ASPAC communique lauded the "sinister" Djakarta
 conference which is designed to put out the flames of
 revolution in Indochina, and it says that the Japanese
 and Malaysian delegates reported to the meeting on their "talks
 on the convening of a new Geneva conference" with the Soviet
 foreign minister.  There is no further reference to the Soviet
 Union; the commentary goes on merely to sc)re Japan for its
 role in the Djakarta conference.
 TIRANA     The visits of U Thant and the three-nation Djakarta
 mission to Moscow are cited in a ZERI I POPULLIT
 article--carried by Tirana's ATA on 24 June--which denounces
 U.S. "maneuvers" to achieve peace in Indochina, allegedly
 carried out with the assistance of the "Moscow revisionists."

 the situation in Indochina "becomes so serious as to require

 resuLt, says the commentary, the United States has spread
 aggression to Cambodia, resumed some bombing of the DRV, and
 continues "opecial warfare" in Laos.  A Mandarin-language
 commentary on the 20th similarly charges the "false revolutionaries"
 in China with encouraging U.S. aggression.  Although events in
 IridocLina, "which is adjacent to southern China," do "affect
 China's security to a certain extent," the commentary says, the
 Chinese leaders merely "talk big but never take concrete action";
 and the 20 May Mao statement that "a small. nation can defeat a

 DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statements issued on 27 and

 INSTRUCTIONS ON ATTACKING VIETN/IM DISTRICT CAPITALS
 Liberation Radio broadcast in thrr:e daily installments
 from 23 through 25 June an "unsigned commentary" explaining
 the importance to the allies of district capitals and
 military subsectors and detailing instructions can how to
 attack them.  The article explains that the allies use
 the capitals and subsectors as bases for consolidating
 the armed forces and administration at the basic level,
 for oppressing the people, harrassing the revolutionary
 movement, and strengthening the defense of areas adjacent
 to the cities.   To counter these schemes, the article says,
 "we must rush forward in the flush of successes to continue
 to attack many more district capitals and military subsectors
 so as to efficiently assist the masses in rising up to gain
 control, to liberate each rural area, and to consolidate
 and vigorously develop our offensive position .    . ."
 *  The U.S. command in Saigon on the 26th had reported that an
 American bomber hit an anti-aircraft installation in North
 Vietnam in response to "hostile actions" against U.;.
 reconnaissance aircraft.  The command said that st.ch raids
 constitute "protective reaction" and are an inherent right of
 self-defense.

 The article acknowledges that the allies "enjoy many advantages"
 in the capitals and subnectors, uayinr that they are numerically
 strong, are surrounded Ly a security system, can quickly deploy
 troops in the area, have strong permanent fortifications, and are
 supported by strong artillery firepower and motorized reinforcements.
 By contrast, I t cites as allied weakpoirito only the low morale
 and "complex composition" of allied forces, gaps in the allied
 defense caused by the large size of the capital or ouboector,
 and the people's "hatred" of the "enemy."  Later the article
 notes that since attacks on district capitals and military
 subsectors sometimes involve "intense" and drawn-out fighting,
 it is important to forge and maintain a high level of determination.
 The article offers statistics on the number of district capitals
 and military subsectors attacked since the start of the 1968
 Tet offensive, in some cases listing the names of specific
 targets.  It claims that prolonged attacks as well as brief
 ones have been carried out, citing cases of attacks lasting more
 than 60 and 90 days.
 The article stresses the use of regional armed forces as the
 core for such attacks.  Regional units, along with guerrilla
 forces, are credited with most of the successes in past attacks;
 and in spelling out correct methods to be used, the article pointedly
 contrasts the advantages of regional forces over main force units.
 In a passage which could reflect limitations on the effectiveness
 of troops from the DRV, the article states that the regional armed
 forces "are closely bound to their native places" and have an
 advantage "over forces coming from far away."

 FANFARE FROM PEKING AND PYONGYANG, ROUTINE MOSCOW OBSERVANCE
 LEVEL AND NATURE The 20th anniversary of the outbreak of the
 OF CELEBRATIONS Korean War has been celebrated with
 propaganda fanfare in Pyongyang and Peking,
 while Moscow marked the event in routine fashion.*  Pyongyang
 opened its propaganda barrage with the release of a lengthy
 government memorandum, followed by publicity for a Pyongyang
 city rally attended by Premier Kim I1-uorig and addressed by
 First Vice Premier Kim I1.  Foreign speakers at the rally, in
 addition to Prince Sihanouk, included delegates from the PRC,
 DRV, South Vietnwn'u PRG, and the Pathet Lao.  These delegations
 were all received by Kim I1-song for "friendly talks," were
 entertained at a DPRK Cabinet banquet attended by Kim Il-song,
 and jointly hosted a banquet for Kim in return.
 The high level of the observance in Pyongyang is in keeping with
 treatment of a decennial anniversary.   Kim Il-song does not
 normally appear at the annual observances but attended the
 rally on the 10th anniversary.  There is no known precedent
 for the appearance of the foreign delegations in Pyongyang.
 Peking's effusive treatment of the anniversary seems in keeping
 with the recent warming of Sino-Korean relations and with
 Peking's initiative in backing Sihanouk and the Cambodian
 "revolution."  In the past three years Peking had either totally
 ignored the occasion or acknowledged it only cursorily in
 brief NCNA reports.  Peking's last normal observance of the
 anniversary was in 1966, before Sino-Korean relations began
 to deterioriate seriously; the occasion was marked with the
 usual Peking rally and a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial that year.
 This year for the first time the Chinese directly linked
 commemoration of the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June with
 observance of the anniversary of the U.S. "occupation" of
 Taiwan--dated 27 June by Peking, recalling the U.S. Seventh

 detail in a Supplement to the TRENDS under separate cover.
 Treatment of the Taiwan question in anniversary propaganda is
 discussed in the Sino-U.S. Relations section  of this issue.

 either the Chinese conununisto or the Nationalists.      The two
 anniversaries, both ignored from 1967 through 1969, had been
 commemorated separately by Peking In the pact.  Pyongyang
 thiu year followed its customary practice of celebrating
 a "day of struggle for the withdrawal of the United States
 from South Korea" on 25 June, marking the Taiwan anniversary
 with separate observances including a rally on the.27th and
 a NODONG SINMUN editorial the same day expressing support for
 the PRC's claim to Taiwan.
 DPR'C Foreign Minister Pc  Song-chol went to Peking to take
 part In the anniversary ceremonies there.  A lower-ranking
 Korean group had gone to Peking for the 15th anniversary.
 Pak was received by Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao and greeted
 with a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial.  He addressed a Peking
 rally along with PRC Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien and was
 entertained at a banquet by Chou En-lai.  He also visited
 Shanghai and the deputy head of the DPRK delegation went
 to Shenyang, both being feted by revolutionary committee
 chairmen.  Many of China's provinces also held local rallies.
 Moscow marked the Korean War anniversary with the usual
 rally in the capital addressed by the chairman of the
 USSR-DPRK friendship society and by the deputy chairman
 of the DPRK-USSR friendship society, who is currently
 leading a visiting delegation.  The Soviet press and
 radio have cnrrie d the customary routine-level comment.
 KOREAN      The content of Pyongyang's propaganda on the
 COMMENT     Korean War anniversary is routine in substance.
 The DPRK Government memorandum and the other
 speeches and propaganda from Pyongyang are replete with
 the usual militant formulations blaming the United States
 for maneuvering to provoke a "new war," reiterating North
 Korea's determination to defend itself, and recalling the
 "lessons" of the Korean War.  At the same time, the
 propaganda reaffirms North Korea's dedication to the notion
 of "peaceful" unification, and the government memorandum
 reviews Pyongyang's frequently repeated proposals in this
 regard.  The propaganda also praises the South Korean
 "anti-U.S. national salvation struggle," and the usual
 "appeal to the South Korean people," calling on them to

 come references to the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist
 party in the South, which Pyongyang had announced on 20 June.
 Pyongyang balances its thanks for Chinese support.and the
 dispatch of volunteers to fight in the war with thanks to
 the USSR and other socialist countries for their aid and
 support.  Pyongyang avoids anti-Soviet remarks on its own
 authority, although it duly reports polemical remarks by
 Chinese spokesmen.
 Throughout, North Korean as well as Chinese propaganda extolls
 the "anti-imperialist united front of the revolutionary
 Asian people" encompassing the PRC, DPRK, DRV, PRG, Pathet
 Lao, and "liberated" Cambodia--a theme that has become
 increasingly prominent in Pyongyang's propaganda, as in
 Peking's, since the overthrow of Sihanouk and especially
 since Mao 'T'se-tung's 20 May statement on the Indochina
 situation.

 Peking has used the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the
 outbreak of the Korean War and the U.S. "occupation" of Taiwan
 to reaffirm its determination to recover Taiwan and to put on
 record its first comment on the Warsaw talks since the meetings
 were resumed this year.  While the Chinese have used tough
 language to charge the United States with persisting hostility,
 they have not exhibited a strong sense of urgency in pledging
 the "liberation" of Taiwan p.nd, most notably, have again
 expressed their interest in basing PRC-U.S. relations on the
 five principles of coexistence.  At the same time, the Chinese
 have taken the occasion to reassert the primacy of the Taiwan
 issue as the crucial obstacle to improved relations with the
 United States.
 PRC DECRIES U.S. "OCCUPATION" OF TAIWAN ON ANNIVERSARY
 Chinese comment during observances jointly marking the Korean
 and Taiwan anniversaries* followed routine lines in pledging
 the liberation of Taiwan and denouncing the United States for
 its alleged intrusions into PRC territory and its support of
 the Chiang Kai-shek regime.  It was in comment on the Taiwan
 anniversary alone that Peking addressed' itself directly to
 Sino-U.S. bilateral issues.  In addition to low-level NCNA
 reports and commentaries in the domestic media, authoritative
 comment was made by PLA Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng, a
 Politburo member, who addressed a rally in Pyongyang on
 27 June devoted to the Taiwan anniversary.  Citing the Warsaw
 talks, Huang declared that relaxation of Sino-U.S. relations
 is "out of the question" in light of the U.S. refusal to
 withdraw its troops from Taiwan and to "cease interference in
 China's internal affairs."  Since the United States "persists
 in making itself the enemy" of the Chinese, he asserted, the
 PRC has "no choice but to resolve to deal with it accordingly
 to the end."  He added that Taiwc.ii "will certainly be liberated."

 Two NCNA reports sought to-document Peking's charges of U.S.
 hostility.  On the 27th NCNA recounted the series of "serious
 warnings" against U.S. intrusions into PRC territory and
 likened President Nixon to his predecessors since Truman as
 "Jackals of the same lair" who have "not in the least" changed
 the U.S. policy of "aggression toward China."  An NCNA
 correspondent's report on the 26th, claiming in a similar
 vein that the Nixon Administration has persisted in traditional
 U.S. policies of "forcible occupation of Taiwan and hostility
 to China," took exception to visits to Taiwan by Vice
 President Agnew and Secretary Rogers and their reaffirmation
 of U.S. treaty commitments to the Nationalist regime.  Like
 Huang, NCNA brought up the question of relaxation of PRC-U.S.
 tensions, dismissing the President's call for improving
 relations as "nothing but a trick" to deceive public opinion.
 In an unusual allusion to agitation in the United States for
 a conciliatory line toward Peking, the report claimed that
 the "bankrupt anti-China policy" has become "even more
 unpopular" and that this induced the President to assume a
 more flexible stance.
 Peking's tough approach at the time of the anniversary comports
 with its practice of using milestone occasions to restate a
 strong case against an adversary and to enhance its image of
 "principled" revolutionary militance.  Thus Peking's joint
 editorial on the 22 April Lenin centenary blasted Soviet
 positions across the board, though shortly afterwards the
 Chinese signalled their intent so persist in the Sino-Soviet
 talks and began an extended period of polemical restraint
 toward the Soviets.  Moreover, the circumstances. surrounding
 the Taiwan anniversary are such as to reinforce Peking's urge
 to stake out a hard bargaining position.  Peking's current
 campaign playing on themes of Asian revolutionary unity
 against the U.S. presence, including efforts to associate
 the PRC's claim on Taiwan with North Korean and North
 Vietnamese aspirations to reunify their countries, dictates
 a tough stance toward the United States; at the same time,
 the Chinese are being taunted by Moscow for failing to match
 their anti-imperialist pretensions with actions to recover
 Taiwan and Hong Kong.  And as its announcements regarding
 the postponed session of the Warsaw talks scheduled for
 20 May indicated, Peking finds it  expedient to defer
 negotiations with Washington during a time of broadened
 military activity in Cambodia.

 PEKING CALLS FOR PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WITH UNITED STATES
 Peking's comment on Sino-U.S. relations contains two ideological
 cues which point To a. more flexible stance in the long run than
 the harsh anti-U.S. rhetoric might suggest.  In referring to
 the Warsaw talks,  Huang Yung-sheng citeC the two principles--
 that the United States must withdraw all its troops from Taiwan
 and that Sino-U.S. relations must be based on the five
 principles of peaceful coexistence--which had.been . formulated
 in the 26 November 1968 PRC Foreign Ministry statement
 proposing that the talks be resumed after the inauguration
 of the Nixon Administration.  Introduction of the concept
 of peaceful coexistence in that statement represented a
 striking shift in Peking's longstanding polemical assault
 on the lines of Soviet-U.S. detente.  Indicative of Peking's
 former position was Chen I's remark, in a speech at a Soviet
 embassy reception on 15 February 1965 marking the Sino-Soviet
 treaty anniversary, that peaceful coexistence with "U.S.
 imperialism" is "out of the question."
 Huang's call for peaceful coexistence with the United States
 is the first since the November 1968 statement.*  In the
 first Chinese comment on the Warsaw talks since they were
 resumed this year, he has reaffirmed a significant ideological
 shift and declared that what is "out of the question" is--in
 contrast to Chen I's formulation--relaxation of Sino-U.S.
 relations while the United States maintains its military
 presence on Taiwan.   In defining this as the "crucial" issue
 in Sino-U.S. relations, Huang has echoed the earlier
 statement's insistence on the primacy of questions of
 principle in the negotiations.  The November 1968 statement
 had been even more explicit in complaining that the United
 States has "kept on haggling over side  issues" and in
 warning that the PRC "will never barter away principles."
 In the manner of Huang's remarks, the statement said "no
 *  A PEOPLE'S DAILY article on 18 Mvy 1969, during a period
 in which Peking was taking a notably tough line toward the
 United States, derided the President   ^r talking "loudly
 about so-called 'peaceful coexistence' and [playing] the
 trick of sham relaxation."

 result whatsoever" would come of the Warsaw talks unless
 the United States was willing to tackle issues of principle.*
 Peking's comment has shown flexibility in another respect in a
 trend away from a portrayal of congruent and collusive Soviet
 and U.S. interests to contain China.  This contrasts with the
 tough line taken by Peking on Sino-U.S. relations last year
 which was marked by a stress on themes of collusion between
 the PRC's major adversaries.  Though the Chinese used the
 occasion of the Korean War anniversary this year to take
 several digs at the Soviets for their dealings with the
 United States and Japan, there has been no attempt to
 depict the international environment as being dominated
 by joint Soviet-U.S. efforts to "encircle" the PRC.  It
 may be indicative that in his 27 June speech on the Taiwan
 question, in contrast to his 25 June speech at the Pyongyang
 rally on the Korean War anniversary, Huang avoided the
 anti-Soviet remarks that recurred through other speeches
 by the Chinese.
 Peking's portrayal of an environment in which U.S. and
 Soviet interests diverge at significant points, combined
 with calls for peaceful coexistence both with the United
 States and with the Soviet Union (in the 7 October 1969
 PRC statement announcing agreement to hold border talks),
 provides an ideological rationale for the Chinese to take
 the negotiating track and to seek to acquire leverage in
 the triangular power relationship.  The manner in which
 Peking left the door open to renewing the Warsaw talks
 after the recent postponement reflects an appreciation
 of this situation.
 ROUTINE CALLS FOR TAIWAN LIBERATION SHOW LITTLE URGENCY
 The 20-year milestone in the "occupation" of Taiwan has not
 been accompanied by a sense of urgency in Peking's calls
 for "liberation."  The only note of urgency was put in the
 Peking has not mentioned the specific measures and proposals
 by the United States to relax tensions.  In a characteristic
 allusion, NCNA's account on 28 February of the President's
 foreign policy report to Congress charged that he talked
 "hypocritically about his desire to improve 'relations'
 with China," but the account did not cite the President's
 references to the Warsaw talks and to unilateral U.S.
 measures to normalize relations.

 the youth proclaimed, "will not tolerate the protracted
 occupation" of Taiwan by the United States.  Other statements
 on the anniversary routinely voiced a determination. to take
 over Taiwan without indicating any limits of patience.
 Pledges in leaders' speeches to liberate Taiwan were presented
 in the name of "the Chinese people," with one exception.
 Speaking at a rally in Shenyang on 27 June, Chen Hsi-lien,
 one of the military figures on the Politburo, declared that
 the PLA as well as the Chinese people are determined to
 liberate Taiwan.  The PLA's mission in this cause was given
 explicit sanction when the Chinese last marked the occasion,
 in 1966.  A LIBERATION ARMY DAILY editorial at that time
 termed the liberation of Taiwan the PLA's "sacred duty."
 A rally held in Foochow on 27 June was attended by commanders
 of the PLA Fukien Front units--the troops standing opposite
 Taiwan.  In the principal address, a provincial revolutionary
 committee official declared that the "Chinese people" are
 determined to liberate.Taiwan.  Alluding to the province's
 strategic location, the speaker said the Fukien people
 would build the southeastern coast into "an iron bastion"
 and would "wipe out all enemy intruders and drive U.S.
 imperialism out of Taiwan."  NCNA's report on the rally
 said it was followed by a mammoth demonstration by troops,
 civilians, "and fully armed militiamen at the front line"
 of the coastal defense.  There was no reference to a PLA
 role in liberating Taiwan.

 Matveycv and Stolpovskiy, however, react, to Cccretary Laird'u
 remarks at recent NATO meetings in Venice and Brussels on
 SALT and on the existence of' a Soviet thrra.t.
 The Matveyev article, oiened to the press on 17 June and
 appearing in LIFE AI3ROAD (No. 25, 19-25 June), sustains the
 Soviet attack against Laird as the chief opponent of a
 relaxation  of t.!nsion.  Matveycv expresses; concern over a
 U.S. press report that Laird spoke at the NATO meetings of a
 time limit on the Vienna talks and said it is possible the
 United States "will have to take 'harsh and difficult decisions'
 about new strategic armaments after July 1972 or in the second
 half of 1973 should the Vienna talks break down."  These are
 "strange" words, Matveycv says, since Secretary Rogers recently
 said the negotiations were continuing "in a normal and business-
 like atmosphere" and President Nixon had earlier expressed the
 conviction that the talks would culminate in an agreement.
 Matveyev charges that Laird is in effect "resorting to blackmail
 formulas" with his talk about a "'breakdown'" in the
 negotiations.
 In an international review article in TRUD on the 16th,
 Stolpovskiy attacked Laird in a similar vein for playing up
 the "fable" of a Soviet threat and setting a "time limit"
 for the Vienna talks.  Like Matveyev, Stolpovskiy emphasized
 the sincerity of the Soviet quest for disarmament.

 which a communique on the meeting Lhrce dayu earlier had said
 would be "comrntiwrlcatcd to Lhe governments of all interested
 c)tatcu," also expander the agenda for the conference proposed by
 the fact foreign ministers last October- in Prague.  Like the
 Prague declaration, the memorandum suggests Helsinki as the
 site for the conference.
 U.S., CANADIAN     The memorandum declares that every European
 PARTICIPATION      state, the two Germanies Included, as well
 as the United States and Canada can take
 part in the conference on a basis of equality.  It also drops
 the previously standard reference to an "all-European" or "pan-
 European conference."
 The Pact foreign ministers' declaration in October had seemed
 to leave the possibility of U.S. participation open, stating
 that t' 're matter of participants could be solved with good will.
 Prior Pact documents had registered a long history of vacilla-
 tion and ambiguity on the U.S. role.  While some formulations
 seemed to exclude the United States, the Bucharest declaration
 of July 1966--following a Pact Political Consultative Committee
 meeting--asserted the Pact's readiness to take part in a
 conference at a time convenient "to the other interested states,
 both members of NATO and neutrals," and observed that "countries
 on other continents cannot be indifferent to how things develop
 in Europe."
 The Soviet Union's own equivocation and ambivalence on the
 issue was finally resolved on 13 January 1970, when a foreign
 ministry spokesman said Moscow had informed Washington "of its
 favorable attitude to the participation of the United States
 in an all-European conference" and added that this view was
 shared by the other socialist states.  Subsequent Soviet
 propaganda, however, only infrequently broached the possibility
 of U.S. participation.  Followup comment on the 26 June

 by discussion of problems of the human environment and the

 to have every state agree on the agenda," the memorandum
 continues, the Pact member states now propose a third agenda
 item--diucuuuion of "the cutabliu}unent of a body concerned
 with questions of European security and cooperation."  I3rczhnev
 had hinted at the new item in his 1.2 June election speech when
 he stated, in discussing the European security conference
 proposal, that "the nations concc-rncd could set up also some
 sort of a permanently functioning mechanists for the practical
 elaboration and implementation of concerted measures."
 Brezhnev's remark seemed at the time to be responsive to a
 proposal advanced by the British at the 26-27 May NATO foreign
 ministers' meeting In Rome for creation of a permanent
 commission at the ambassadorial level for talks between NATO
 and Pact states.  Participants in the 28 June domestic service
 roundtable now make a point of the differences between the
 memorandum's proposal and "the superficially similar proposal
 by Britain" at the Rome meeting.  The British plan, they say,
 calls for a "bloc approach" which would allow only token
 representation from nonalined European states, while the
 Pact is suggesting that "all European countries without
 exception take part in this organ."  Moreover, the commentators
 add, the British plan calls for the creation of a mechanism
 before the conference is convened, seeking thereby to "postpone"
 the conference.
 Concern to counter the appearance of direct Pact responsiveness
 to a NATO initiative seems reflected also in Soviet comment on
 the issue of mutual force cuts.  The memorandum states that in
 the Pact members' view, "it would help to lessen tension and
 promote security in Europe if the reduction of foreign armed
 forces on the territory of European states were discussed,"
 either in the newly proposed permanent body "or in other ways

 urged that the question of a balanced force reduction "head"
 the work of a European conference, grantu that the question is
 "important" but goes on to argue that it in connected with the
 "whole complex of disarmament" and is "beyond the framework of

 MOSCOW RESTRAINED ON NEW U.S. PEACE INITIATIVE
 Moscow has responded cautiously to Secret' ry Rogers' 25 June
 preuu conference announcement of a U.S. political initiative to
 encourage the parties "to stop uhootini, arid start talking" under
 the auspices of U Thant's representative, Ambassador Jarring.
 Limited Soviet comment cites Arab and West European press reac-
 tion in concluding that the propouuls--which Rogers did not spell
 out in detail--contain nothing new wton compared with the U.S.
 proposals of last December.   Soviet propagandists make a point of
 professing no direct knowledge of the substance of the plan and
 do not acknowledge that Rogers said it had been presented to the
 USSR, among other countries.
 U.S. ARMS      In the 28 June domestic service commentators' round-
 TO ISRAEL                          table, one of the participants remarked that "our Arab
 colleagues are evidently informed about some of the
 points" in the U.S. proposal, out "so far those ii. the rest of the
 world can only guess at its content."  One participant observed
 that Washington was experiencing pressure from American political
 leaders for stepped-up "interference on behalf of Israel" while
 at the same time open aid to Israel "angers a whole host of states"
 and makes this policy "risky."  Another expressed hope that the
 new U.S. initiative is not merely a smokescreen to cover up suppl;es
 of "of.iensive weapons" to Israel.  The fact that the United States
 "is preparing some kind of peaceful initiative" and at the same time
 saying that a new consignment of arms will be sold to Israel "right-
 ly puts one on guard," he said, and "makes one regard talk about
 this new peaceful initiative with a certain amount of caution.
 Time alone will tell."  Other Soviet comment suggests that the
 United States intends to continue material support to Israel, but
 from now on as "covertly as possible."
 Promptly reporting the Secretary's press conference, TASS notes
 that he said U.S. policy with respect to Israel remains unchanged
 and that he declined to answer questions on further deliveries of
 U.S. military equipment to Israel, saying it would not be useful
 to publicly discuss military aid at this time.

 WITHDRAWAL     Comment touching on the U.S. Initiative continues
 to press for Israeli withdraws-1 from "all" occupied
 tcrr.itorics..  I3roadcactu in Arabic on the 25th and in English to
 North Aitirica on the 36th said that judging by Secretary Rogers'
 utatement, Washington still objects to the unconditional withdrawal
 of luraell forces from the occupied territories, although this is
 the "main proviuion" of the November 1967 '.iccurity Council resolu-
 tion.   The latter broadcast also asserted that the Secretary
 "reduced the question of a political settlement" to a 'temporary
 cease-fire and tied a settlement to Arab-Israeli negotiations.
 A Tsoppi foreign-language commentary on the 26th said one "looks
 in vain" for an answer to the "essential question" of whether the
 United States considers that the withdrawal of "all Israeli
 troops from all occupied Arab territories" is necessary for
 reestablishing peace.  As long as Washington delivers arms to
 Israel and does not "unequivocally announce" that the road to
 peace lies in an Israeli obligation for complete withdrawal,
 Tsoppi concluded, neither the Arabs nor international opinion
 will believe in the sincerity of U.S. intentions or its initia-
 tive.  Citing Nasir on the subject of withdrawal, both TASS on
 the 26th and IZVESTIYA on the 28th reported that the UAR President
 in his 25 June speech in Benghazi, "speaking about the 'new
 American proposals,'" stressed that the Egyptian people would
 not agree to any bargaining over the question of Israeli with-
 drawal.   (In the speech as broadcast live by Bayda radio, Nasir
 in fact did not specifically mention the U.S. initiative, re-
 ferring only to "what has been reiterated today about agree-
 ments for evacuation from the occupied territories excluding
 the Golan.")
 ARAB         The Moscow Arabic-language commentary on the 25th
 CcDMMENT     declared that the first reaction to the Secretary's
 statement was one of "severe criticism" and that
 the Palestinian resistance organizations "rejected it completely."
 However, in reviewing Arab press comment on the 26th and 27th,
 TASS said merely that the papers note  the  "ambiguity of the
 statement" and cited Cairo press complaints that any proposals
 not envisaging the return of all occupied territories will not
 lead to the establishment of peace.
 A Mayevskiy review in PRAVDA on the 28th attributed to the Arab
 press the view that the "backstage" U.S. Proposals again put the
 aggressor and his victim on the same footing and signify attempts
 to weaken Arab anti-Americanism and to undermine Soviet-Arab

 NASIR ARRIVES IN MOSCOW FOR "FRIENDLY VISIT"
 UAR President Nasir's unheralded arrival in Moscow on 29 June for
 a "friendly visit" is hailed in Soviet comment as an event of
 great significance for UAR-Soviet solidarity, cooperation, and
 "cordial relations.'k  Reporting his arrival at the invitation
 of the CPSU Central Committee, the Supreme Soviet Presidium,
 and the Soviet Government, 'PASS noted that Nasir "plans to
 stay in Moscow for several days."
 Reporting the first session of the talks on the 30th, TASS
 listed Brezhnev, Podgornyy, Kosygin, Ponomarev, Gromyko, and
 Grechko among those present on the Soviet side and ASU Execu-
 tive Committee member Ali Sabri, Foreign Minister Mahmud Riyad,
 War Minister Fawzi, and National Guidance Minister Haykal among
 those on the UAR side.  The MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY (MENA) noted
 on the 29th that Muhammad Riyad, minister at the UAR foreign
 ministry, would be arriving from New York to join the delegation.
 MENA said the talks would center on the Middle East problem,
 particularly developments resulting from Israel's "refusal to
 implement" the November 1967 Security Council resolution.  The
 talks, MENA added, would also deal with the recent U.S. plan:
 The Soviet role in this respect "will be mainly to hear the
 UAR's views."  TASS did not mention the U.S. initiative in report-
 ing that the first day's talks, held "in an atmosphere of cordia-
 lity and complete mutual understanding," concerned bilateral rela-
 tions as well as an "all-round exchange of views" on the M.1.sdle
 East situation and a discussion of "some other important problems"
 of the present international situation.

 Israel's right to exist.  lie did not take the occasion to repeat
 the propaganda refrain that the resolutiork calls for Israeli
 withdrawal, although he went on to note that the "Israeli
 extremists" still occupy Arab territories and "drag out" a
 settlement.
 Expressing conviction that a "just political settlement" will
 be achieved, Podgornyy cited as "guarantees" the "strengthening
 eco.%iomic and defense potential" of the UAR and other Arab states,
 growing Arab unity, and the "aid and all-round support" of the
 Soviet Union and the other socialist countries.  He pledged
 continued Soviet help to the Arab countries in their struggle
 "to eliminate the consequences of the Israeli aggression" and
 attain a just and lasting peace, adding that there was "every
 ground to express satisfaction" over the friendly relations
 between the USSR and the UAR.  Assessing the UAR's "progressive
 development," Podgornyy stated that "there are and possibly still
 will be obstacles," but these can be overcome "if the correct
 road of development" is 'hosen and if "one leans on sincere and
 reliable friends."
 BILATERAL     Soviet commentators predictably emphasize Soviet
 RELATIONS     solidarity with the Arabs and assistance to the
 UAR.  A Koryavin article in IZVESTIYA on the 29th
 points to economic projects which have become symbols of Soviet-
 Egyptian friendship, and a Tsoppi. foreign-language commentary
 the same day stresses in addition the "anti-imperialist" content
 of the "political task" to which development is subordinated.
 While Tsoppi notes only in passing that the UAR has "restored
 its defense potential," a 29 June commentary in Arabic focuses
 more on the improvements in Egyptian defense.  The UAR, it
 says, has managed to rebuild its defense power quickly and
 "move to the stage of active defense."  The commentary adds
 that Tel Aviv      been compelled to abandon its bombing of
 UAR positions in the rear and is being "appropriately repelled"
 in its attacks in the Suez Canal area:  Soviet-UAR cooperation
 has helped make the UAR defense "invulnerable to the enemy"
 and a "new basic situation" has been created in which the anti-
 Arab forces have been forced to resort to "donning the garb of
 peace advocates."

 Perhaps the most explicit Soviet reference to the nature of

 tical commentator Vadim Ardatovskiy, in an article printed !n

 perfectly natural."  Rejecting the possibility of an Arab-
 Israeli truce, Ardatovskiy declares that the "only thing possible
 is peace," the establishment of which would have a favorable
 effect on "the general complex of international relations and
 the relations between the great powers as well as between the

 U,S, - JAPAN  SECURITY TREATY
 TREATY EXTENSION OCCASIONS NEW WARNINGS OF THREAT TO PEACE
 The long-anticipated automatic extension of the U.S.-Japan security
 treaty at midnight 22 June drew renewed propaganda blasts against
 the treaty from Moscow and the Asian communist countries, with
 authoritative signed comment in the Soviet central press,
 editorials from Peking and Hanoi, and a government statement
 from Pyongyang.
 MOSCOW'S     Moscow propaganda for the most part recapitulates
 REACTION     themes prominent at the time of Japan's basic
 decision last October to extend the duration of
 the treaty.  The prolongation of the pact is said to serve. U.S.
 plans to use Japan as a tool in an aggressive Asian policy,
 creating a threat to Asian security and redounding chiefly to
 the detriment of the Japanese people's own interests.
 A 23 June article by PRAVDA's Mayevskiy adds a new dimension in
 picturing "the American people" as also threatened by a pact that
 abets the revival of Japanese militarism.  Mayevskiy, who also
 authored the most authoritative Soviet comment on the treaty in
 October, argues that the American people's interests are being
 harmed by the efforts of U.S. "imperialist circles," under cover
 of the treaty, to "build up Japanese revanchism" just as they
 encouraged "German militarism" after World War I and "are doing
 now" in West Germany.
 Mayevskiy pursues standard lines in linking the extension of the
 treaty with a U.S. desire to turn Japan "into a center for
 implementing the 'Guam doctrine' and into a gendarme of Asia"
 as part of a scheme to make Asians fight Asians.  Japan's
 territory is being used now, he says, "for the development of
 the U.S. intervention in Indochina."  This charge recurs in
 other Soviet comment.
 In IZVESTIYA on 23 October, Kudryavtsev depicts a threat to the
 Soviet Union inherent in U.S.-Japanese military cooperation--a
 theme raised in the central press in PRAVDA's 16 December 1969
 editorial article a month after the Nixon-Sato talks and broached
 recurrently before and since that time primarily in Moscow
 broadcasts to Japan.  Kudryavtsev says U.S. bases maintained on
 Japanese soil under the terms of the treaty are "spearheaded

 against the Soviet Union and other neighbors" and asserts that
 "it would be naive" to suppose that such a situation "does not
 hamper the further development of good-neighborly relations
 between the Soviet Union and Japan."  The notion that Soviet
 security interests are menaced is also brought up in a routine-
 level broadcast to Southeast Asia and in several commentaries
 tailored for the Japanese.
 Moscow  sustains  the practice of attacking Japanese "ruling
 circles" and avoids criticizing Prime Minister Sato personally.
 CHINESE     Peking, assailing the "reactionary Sato government,"
 COMMENT     has played on current themes of Asian communist unity
 with charges that the treaty constitutes a provocation
 against the peoples of China, Korea, and Indochina as well as
 against the Japanese themselves.  PEOPLE'S DAILY's 23 June
 editorial calls the "unequal" treaty "an indentured selling out"
 of Japanese sovereignty and national interests, "a chain biLtding
 Japan to the chariot of U.S. imperialist aggression," and a
 "serious threat," to peace in Asia and the pacific.  Alleging that
 U.S. military bases in Japan are used to launch provocations
 against Indochina, China, and Korea, the editorial says the treaty
 extension "is meant primarily to suit the urgent needs of U.S.
 imperialism" and can only bring "calamity" for Japan.   It sees
 abolition of the treaty and overthrow of "the forces of Japanese
 militarism" as the only way out for the Japanese.
 Support for efforts by the Japanese people to abolish the treaty
 had been expressed in a communique--carried by NCNA on the 20th--
 on talks between delegations of the Fishery Association of China
 and the Japan-China Fishery Association.  The communique called
 the Sato government's decision to extend the treaty a serious
 provocation against the Japanese people and against "the peoples
 of China, Korea, Indochina, and Asia as a whole."  On 25 June,
 speaking at a banquet for a visiting North Korean delegation,
 Chou En-lai mentioned the treaty extension briefly in charging
 that the Sato government "has become even more unbridled in its
 reactionary arrogance."
 As in October when the decision to extend the treaty was made
 known, Peking media featured accounts of protest rallies and
 demonstrations in Japan.

 PYONGYANG     Typically egocentric North Korean reaction is expressed
 STATEMENT     in the DPRK Government statement of 19 June and in an
 echoing NODONG SINMUN editorial of the 22d, both of
 which call Korea the treaty's "primary target of aggression."
 Decrying the "vicious maneuvers" of Japan and the United States to
 reinforce their alliance "against the socialist countries and the
 national liberation movement in Asia and jointly expand aggressive
 war throughout Asia," the government statement calls the
 extension of the treaty "a grave challenge to peace in Asia
 and the world" and charges the Japanese "militarists" with
 aggressive designs on China and North Vietnam as well as Korea.
 The Korean people, the editorial says, "cannot watch with folded
 arms" the "outright challenge to the Korean people and wanton
 attack on peace in Asia and the world" represented by the treaty
 extension.
 DRV COMMENT     A 23 June editorial in Hanoi's NHAN DAN denounces
 the treaty extension as "an important landmark
 in the history of criminal collaboration between aggressive U.S.
 imperialism and Japanese militarist imperialism" and as "a
 dangerous development" which "holds a great danger for the
 Japanese people as well as for peace and security in Asia."
 Among several items carried by VNA surrounding the date of the
 treaty's extension was a 24 June report on a Hanoi meeting of
 several' organizations in support of Japanese action to secure
 abrogation of the treaty.  VNA quoted Mme Le Thi Xuyen, a
 functionary of the Vietnam Peace Committee, as saying the treaty
 was "chiefly intended to oppose the Soviet Union and the Asian
 socialist countries and counter the national liberation movement
 in Asia."

 LATIN  AMERICA
 HAVANA APPLAUDS TACTICS OF URBAN GUERRILLAS IN URUGUAY
 Recent Cuban comment on the "Tupamaros," a Uruguayan urban
 guerrilla organization  has gone beyond routine praise for
 the group's military exploits to allege that its tactics are
 exemplary and are being used by revolutionaries throughout
 the southern cone of South America.  Havana now also suggests
 that the Tupamaros, viewing their revolutionary activities in
 a continental context, are prepared to coordinate their actions
 with revolutionary groups in neighboring countries.
 Cuban media's treatment of the Tupamaros accords with Castro's
 newly flexible approach to revolutionary strategy, modifying
 prior insistence on rural-based guerrilla warfare as virtually
 the only path to continental "liberation."  The Cuban leader's
 new flexibility was crystallized in his Lenin Day speech on
 22 April when he remarked that there have never been "two
 identical cases" in history and commented, with respect to
 revolutions, that "new possibilities and new ways are being
 born."  The emergent new approach had been reflected over the
 past two years in Havana media's favorable publicity for 'rban-
 based guerrilla activities.  In now ascribing an exemplary
 character to the Tupamaros, Havana comment pictures the group
 as inspired by the Cuban revolution and by the writings of
 Che Guevara.
 TUPAMAROS     the portrayal of the Tupamaros as a model for other
 AS MODEL      revolutionaries has been drawn most clearly in the
 Cuban communist youth organ JUVENTUD REBELDE, in
 a front-page commentary on 8 June and in an article in the same
 issue by Uruguayan leftist journalist Carlos Maria Gutierrez.
 Applauding the Tupamaros' "tactical ability," the commentary
 alleged that their tactics have been adopted "in various parts
 of the southern cone:  the great port cities of Argentina, Chile,
 and southern Brazil."  Citing a forecast in the New York TIMES
 in January 1969 that Uruguay and the Tupamaros would become the
 United States' major problem in Latin America, the commentary
 alleged that this "fact" had now been "verified."  The Tupamaros'
 "contagiousness," JUVENTUD REBELDE said, had been a matter of
 concern of U.S. "experts" for some time, and the New York TIMES
 had warned that the Uruguayan urban guerrillas could trigger "a
 new Vietnam."

 Gutierrez' article, outlining the Tupamaros' strategy, noted
 that the orgaaization advocated if coordination of a liberation
 struggle for all Latin America"--a struggle which must be
 waged "without respecting the sometimes artificial borders
 imposed by the Balkanization of the colonial era or by imperial-
 ism."
 The JUVENTUD REBELDE commentary did not elaborate on how
 revolutionaries in neighboring countries had been influenced
 by the Tupamaros.  A 22 November 1969 Radio Havana commentary,
 however, was more specific.  It declared that such groups as
 the Brazilian revolutionaries who kidnapped U.S. Ambassador
 Elbrick last September and the Chilean Leftist Revolutionary
 Movement, which has recently engaged in armed actions, owe
 "a moral debt" to the Tupamaros for having "started a new form
 of struggle" within the cities.
 INSPIRATION     The Gutierrez article emphasized the Tupamaros'
 FROM HAVANA     ideological affinity with Havana, stating that
 their "tactical concepts" have been "most
 influenced" by "the example of the Cuban revolution and . . .
 the theoretical works of Che Guevara."  He observed that in
 subscribing to a coordinated continental revolutionary struggle,
 the Tupamaros "agree with the thesis" of the Latin American
 Solidarity Organization (LASO), an organization founded in
 Havana in 1967 which now appears to be moribund.
 Gutierrez said the Tupamaros group  advocates "creation of
 armed groups prior to the appearance of proper conditions for
 armed struggle" and believes that "revolutionary action in
 itself . . . generates awareness, organization, and revolution-
 ary conditions."  This thesis in fact parallels one that Castro
 articulated prior to the debacle suffered by Che Guevara's
 Bolivian venture in 1967.  Gutierrez went on to m&intain, in
 opposition to the orthodox Latin American communist view, that
 proper revolutionary-conditions are not a necessary prerequisite
 to launching an armed struggle because the struggle itself will
 generate the necessary "subjective" conditions.
 The question of possible Cuban material aid to the Tupamaros
 has never been broached directly in Havana propaganda.  A leaf-
 let distributed by the Tupamaros after carrying out an assault

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 HARDLINERS DENOUNCE DUBCEK: HUSAK HINTS AT TRIAL
 Following has final expulsion from the Czechoslovak Communist
 Party, arrnourrccd In a Central Committee plenum resolution on
 ._6 June, Alexander Dubcek has been subjected to vicious public
 attacks by hardlining CI'CZ Secretariat members Miroulav Moc
 and Alois .1ndra.  First Secretary Iluoak, while refraining from
 ouch direct attacks, huu pointedly utrusucd that the pvrt-y
 has been too lenient until now in punishing "violators."
 The Central Committee, according to CTK's excerpts of the plenum
 resolution, "confirmed the expulsion of Alexander Dubcek from
 the ranks of members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia"--
 from which he raid previously been "suspended"--as well as "his
 recall from the post of deputy of the House of the People and
 recall from his post  as Czechoslovak ambassador to Turkey."
 The party dramatized the expulsion by making it the only major
 party personnel action of the session; the only other shift of
 any consequence was the elevation of CSSR Deputy Premier
 Miloslav Hruskovic to the rank of CPCZ Secretary.
 ATTACKS BY     RUDE PRAVO Chief Editor Moc, writing in the issue
 MOC.. INDRA    of the 29th, descends to the level of charging
 that Dubcek "failed to fulfill his duties ensuing
 from his position as Czechoslovak ambassador abroad."  Moc calls
 the expulsion "only a logical consummation of Dubcek's violation
 of party rules" and his "double-faced policy"--an epithet here-
 tofore applied only to Smrkovsky--and adds such charges as
 "ideological capitulation," "capitulation to counterrevolutionary
 forces," and "responsibility for violating internationalist
 relations and the alliance with the CPSU" and its allies.  Moc
 concludes with a warning that "we shall not allow antisocialist
 forces to decide that Dubcek's expulsion concludes another
 chapter."
 A 29 June CTK report quotes CPCZ Presidium candidate and Secretary
 Indra as telling a party aktiv in Usti nad Labem that the plenum
 "made a definitive full-stop to the case of Alexander Dubcek,
 whose responsibility for the disastrous developments in the
 years 1968 and 1969 has been fully proved after thorough party
 investigation."  A briefer account of Indra's speech carried
 in the Prague domestic service the same day, however, does not
 include the direct attack on Dubcek.

 COMMENTS     L'peakiug at a peace rally in Brno-Linen on the
 BY HUSAK     28t?h, curried live in the Prague domestic service,
 Gustav Iluoak manifested his greatest sensitivity
 to date to "Western" opposition to the CPCZ's hardline course
 as exemplified by the plenum actioc. against Dubcck.  lie assured
 his listeners that nobody need fear "for his own security, even
 though the people from thci West continuously talk about what
 trials we would hold in our country and what terror we are
 making here."  But he aC,led that "we have been in certain cases
 too generous toward certain people" who "do not deserve such
 generosity an we have displayed in the past year."  In a
 transparent allusion to his former Presidium colleague Dubcek,
 liusak invoked a saying by the Stalinist Gottwald:  "Brother
 or not, come down from the pear tree," declaring in this
 context that "the weight of the law will strike the violator
 of the law and this could not, as a matter of fact, be other-
 wise."
 The CPCZ Presidium report delivered by Husak at the 25 June
 session of the Central Committee plenum, printed in full in
 RUDE PRAVO on the 27th, is relatively moderate overall.  It
 decries "manifestations of liberalism and of a conciliatory
 attitude" in interviews connected with the "exchange of party
 cards," a recurrent theme of recent Prague propaganda.  It also
 claims successes in overcoming the 1968-69 depredatinns of the
 "rightist opportunists" in political affairs, the communications
 media, the economy, and foreign affairs.
 In what is apparently his major public rationale for the recall
 of Dubcek as ambassador to Turkey, Husak declares:  "The
 exper'_nce of 1968 showed that the implementation of the
 party line in the field of external political and commercial
 relations can be ensured only by people who stand firmly on the

 In the 27 June issue of the Italian CP'O L'UNITA, party Secretary
 General Longo declared: "We regret and deplore the expulsion."
 He  commented that such actions cannot contribute in a positive
 way to solving the political situation in Czechoslovakia.  On
 29 June, under the heading "Deep Regret at Expulsion of Dubcek,"
 the British CP's MORNING STAR recalled "Comrade" Dubcek's "long
 service to the party and the cause of socialism, including his
 role in the anti-Ilitler struggle."  Tak'ag dote of Longo's
 statement in L'UNITA on the expulsion, MORNING STAR added a
 reminder that Dubcek's contribution to eradicating the "deforma-
 tions" of Novotny had been "publicly acknowledged by the new
 leadership" of the Czechoslovak party.

 YUGOSLAVIA AND                                                        USSR
 RIBICIC MOSCOW VISIT REFLECTS IMPROVEMENT IN STATE RELATIONS
 Yugoslav Premier Ribicic's 24-30 June visit to Moscow--the
 first high-level official Yugoslav visit to the Soviet Union
 since the intervention in Czechoslovaki a--underscores mutual
 efforts to improve relations on the state level despite
 continuing serious differences in ideology, interparty
 relations, and foreign policy.
 Soviet assurances that the 1955 Belgrade declaration and
 other documents on relations between the two governments are
 still valid constitute a further attempt to repair the damage
 done to relations with Yugoslavia by the invasion of Czechoslovakia.*
 Moscow's moves to improve its ties with Belgrade have coincided
 with efforts to counter Chinese attempts to gain leverage in
 Eastern Europe.  Belgrade and Peking have been normalizing
 economic and diplomatic ties in recent months.  The development
 of Moscow's conciliatory posture also camps at a time when
 preparations are underway for the thii'_t. nonalined summit in
 Lusaka in September, when the Yugoslavs may be expected to
 reiterate their traditional antipathy to power blocs; Moscow
 may hope to forestall or mitigate use of the meeting as a
 forum for censure of Soviet policies specifically.
 The Yugoslavs, for their part, appear willing to mute their
 criticism of Soviet policies and to play down areas of discord
 in exchange for improved economic relations with the Soviet
 Union and its allies.
 COMMUNIQUE ON TALKS     The 30 June communique on Ribicic's.
 WITH SOVIET LEADERS     visit, which included. talks with
 Kosygin and Po igornyy, reasserts the
 principles of "respect  for sovereignty, territorial integrity,
 equality, noninterference in each other's affairs, and mutual
 respect."  The existence of "certain differences of approach
 to certain questions," the document says, "should not hinder
 *  During his September 1969 visit to Belgrade, Soviet Foreign
 Minister Gromyko gave similar assurances of Soviet adherence to
 the 1955 Belgrade declaration.

 the development of normal and friendly mutual relations."  Both
 sides registered a desire to develop further economic cooperation
 and stressed "the importance of joint efforts to formulate a new
 five-year trade agreement for the 1971-75 period."
 Describing the atmosphere of the talks as "frank and friendly,"
 the communique adds that views were "exchanged" on bilateral
 relations, political and economic cooperation, and "urgent
 international problems."  Pointing to areas of agreement on
 foreign policy, it records joint support for the Vietnamese
 and all Indochinese peoples and condemns Israe14 "aggressive"
 actions.  It also reaffirms both sides' support for a European
 security conference. and notes the "great importance" both attach
 to improving relations with West Germany.
 Obscuring the areas of disagreement, the communique says merely
 that the Yugoslav Government '.'acquainted" the Soviet side with
 the principles of its nonalinement policy and the importance
 of the forthcoming Lusaka summit.  The document predictably
 ignores the sensitive issue of China and steers clear of any
 reference to interparty relations.  Premier Kosygin, the
 document concludes, has accepted an invitation to visit
 Belgrade at a date to be fixed later.
 KOSYGIN, RIBICIC      A mutual desire to seek further cooperation
 LUNCHEON SPEECHES     despite persisting differences was also
 the central theme of speeches by Kosygin
 and Ribicic at a luncheon in Moscow on 24 June.  The Soviet
 Premier, as quoted by Radio Moscow on 24 June, called for
 "comradely discussion of all questions to enable us to
 remove by joint effort all that hampers the development
 of Soviet-Yugoslav cooperation."  He.went on to point "with
 satisfaction" to the "closeness or coincidence" of views
 between the two countries on European security, the Middle
 East, and Indochina.  He concluded by assuring the Yugoslavs
 that the USSR is "firmly resolved to continue to be guided"
 by the principles of "socialist internationalism, -equality,
 mutual respect, and noninterference in the domestic affairs
 of others."
 In a similar vein, the Yugoslav Premier expressed . a. readiness
 for improved Soviet-Yugoslav relations but made it clear
 that this could not occur at the expense of Belgrade's
 independent, nonalined policy.  In his remarks as reported
 in PRAVDA on the 25th, he acknowledged that "certain

 differences" remain between the two countries, advocating
 further talks as the best way to promote understanding and
 laying particular emphasis on Belgrade's desire to?intensify
 economic cooperation.  He went on to declare that the
 "criteria" for such cooperation must be "mutual respect
 for sovereignty and territorial integrity, noninterference,
 and equality."' Predictably, he made no mention of "socialist
 internationalism.
 Without naming any countries, but with Belgrade!s conspicously
 improved relations with Peking and the forthcoming Lusaka
 summit clearly in the background, Ribicic emphasized that
 to pursue good relations with "all" countries.  In an apparent
 dig at Moscow's Indochina policy, he pointed out that
 Yugoslavia had supported the Vietnamese people from the
 beginning and has recognized the new Sihanouk government as
 well as the PRG in South Vietnam.  Although he went on to
 cite 'ietnam as confirmation that "no outside force can
 crush the resistance of a people struggling for their
 freedom and independence," the implications of his remark
 for the Soviets seemed obvious.

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 BREZNNEVIS WAR ROLE PLAYED UP BY OGONEK, OTHERWISE IGNORED
 The mass-circulation magazine OGONEK, in its issue dated 13 June,
 published an article on a 12 May reunion of World War II veterans
 of the 18th Soviet Army.  The author is Col. S.A. Borzenko,
 formerly a reporter with the 18th Army and in recent years
 Brezhnev's most faithful panegyrist.  True to form, Borzenko
 devoted the bulk of his article to Brezhnev, who attended the
 reunion; he lauded especially Brezhnev's role in the
 Novorossiysk operation, the only battle in which Brezhnev was
 prominently involved.
 Recalling Brezhnev's presence in the thick of the Novorossiysk
 battle, Borzenko declared that
 the entire army, from commander to private, knew
 Brezhnev; he was their favorite, he knew their
 attitudes and thoughts and was able to kindle
 their desire for victory.  How many times the
 will of this man made the impossible possible!
 At the most critical moments of the battle he
 found fiery words which had a quick and powerful
 effect.  On the beachhead the chief of the
 political department cemented the steadfastness
 of the troops and more than once displayed
 personal bravery and iron coolness.
 The article was accompanied by a picture of Brezhnev surrounded
 by the other veterans.
 The OGONEK article was, however, unique, and as on other similar
 occasions in past years the central press in general passed up
 the opportunity to try to build up Brezhnev's wartime role.  The
 only other lengthy report on the reunion, in LITERARY GAZETTE
 on 3 June, contained no praise for Brezhnev, although it did
 refer several times to his leading role at the meeting.  RED
 STAR on 13 May reported the meeting in three paragraphs, noting
 that Brezhnev was present.  The other central papers did not
 report on the reunion at all.
 In September 1968, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of
 the Novorossiysk operation, OGONEK carried an article that played
 up Brezhnev's wartime role in similar fashion and called on

 journalists and historians "not to forget to portray the
 impressive panorama of battles" at Novorosriiysk.        At that time,
 PRAVDA's anniversary article also stressed Brezhnev's heroism
 during the campaign, but the other central papers did not do
 so and Grechko's IZViSTIYA article seemed even to belittle
 Brezhnev's role.

 PRC  I iJTERNAL AFFAIRS
 JOINT EDITORIAL RELEASED FOR PARTY ANNIVERSARY
 A joint REI) FLAG/PEOPLE'S DAILY/LIBERATION ARMY DAILY editorial,
 released on 30 June, marked this year's undramatic celebration
 of the 49th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist
 Party. The editorial claims no new advances in the protracted
 campaign to rebuild the party, nor does it break any new ground
 in the propaganda surrounding the party-building effort.  It
 fails to reiterate the demands in the joint anniversary editorial
 last year for the formation of strong cores of leadership within
 revolutionary' committees at all levels and for'the rebuilding
 of the Young Communist League.  Concentrating largely on a
 hackneyed repetition of the ideological criteria for now party
 members, the editorial concludes by calling for "great
 achievements in party consolidation and party building" to
 greet the party's 50th anniversary next year.  The implication
 is that party rebuilding will continue to be a very gradual
 process.
 Although the editorial.contains the usual verbiage about
 reliance on the masses for guidance in party building, it
 is not as firm on this point as last year's editorial,
 which made public a Mao. instruction specifically calling
 for the rebuilding of each party branch with the participation
 of masses outside the party.  Approaching the subject more
 cautiously, perhaps with the aim of insulating party members
 against undisciplined factional groups, this year's editorial
 sets limits on the volume.of criticism the masses may direct
 at party members.  It argues that "if a man makes mistakes"
 but conducts self-criticism and accepts criticism by others,
 "he is a good comrade" and additional criticism is unnecessary.
 STATUS OF    An airport reception for delegations returning
 YEH CHUN     from the Korean War anniversary observance in
 Pyongyang provides the first, indicator since
 the Ninth Congress of the standing of Yeh Chun, Lin Piao's
 wife.  Prior to the congress, she had been listed toward the
 end of the "top 14," and since that time she has appeared
 only on occasions when leaders were listed in stroke order.

 For the airport reception, however, she followed Chiang Ching
 and Yao Were-yuan in the Politburo rankings, which were divided
 into groups.  The Chiang-Yao-Yeh grouping,  all considered
 cultural revolution "leftists," was listed first after the
 Standing Committee.  Li Hsien-nien followed, ahead of army
 deputy chiefs of staff Wu Fa-hsien and Chiu Hui-tso.  During
 May Li was listed behind Wu; now he is apparently ahead of
 Wu, at least for civilian functions.
 LEAP FORWARD    Provincial broadcasts continue to stress the
 PLANNING        necessity for an economic "leap forward" in
 industrial aid to agriculture.  A Heilungkiang
 conference on local industries publiciv,:d by Harbin radio on
 22 June specified that local industry must "make overall
 plans," while the provincial authorities must in turn be
 responsible for unified ar-,angements in order to guarantee
 "balanced development of various industries." But a joint
 HUPEH DAILY-YANGTSE DAILY article broadcast on 19 June
 seems to imply disagreement with those who stress the need
 for careful planning and orderly development. The article
 admits that the campaign to increase productivity "may seem
 a little chaotic," but indicates that chaos may be necessary
 "to foster the activism and initiative of the working
 class."  Revolutionary workers "have broken the conventions
 and set aside old frames of reference, foreign ways and old
 methods . . . .  What is so bad about chaos?"  While the
 article then backtracks with the comment that chaos is
 correct only if it does not deviate from Mao's thought, its
 acceptance of short-term economic disorder seems at variance
 with the general concentration on the need for speedy results
 economically, as typified by the common argument that small
 local industry must be supported because it can produce much
 in very little time.
 SUMMER CROPS    Although "leap forward" rhetoric persists in
 the propaganda, harvest claims made recently
 by Peking do not suggest that leap forward results are being
 achieved in agriculture.  An NCNA report on 19 June claimed
 only "good" harvests for Honan, Shantung, Kiangsu, and
 Shensi; it was noted that each province had to "overcome
 natural disasters."  Wheat yields were said to exceed last
 year's in Kiangsu and Honan, but there were no claims of
 record crops.  "Estimated" wheat yields were said to be up
 for Peking and Hopei, according to a 21 June NCNA survey,
 but Shansi was said to have achieved only a "fairly good"

 wheat harvest after numerous natural disasters.  On 23 June
 NCNA released a statement claiming "rich" harvests in the
 major grain-growing areas of China, but again there was no
 claim of record harvests.  Areas in southeast China,
 including the Szechwan breadbasket, are said.to have
 achieved gains in total output of 20 percent this summer
 over last year, but the absence of enthusiastic adjectives
 to describe the harvest.may indicate that.last year's
 harvest was very poor, not that this year's crop is
 exceptional.
