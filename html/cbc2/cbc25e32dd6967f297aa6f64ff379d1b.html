 Recent allied military operations in the northern
 half of South Vietnam have probably disrupted the
 Communists'  plans for a summer offensive.   In Saigon,
 Chief of State Thieu and Premier Ky are actively
 organizing their campaigns for the presidency.  New
 frictions between Hanoi and Peking are suggested by
 Hanoi's publication of an indirect but sharp per-
 sonal attack on Mao Tse-tung.
 DISORDER SPREADS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Mob violence is increasing in the provinces and has
 disrupted service on at least one major rail line.
 Most of the military establishment appears to be
 standing aside, possibly because top leaders in Pe-

 slackened somewhat, the Communist guerrillas appear

 THE WAR IN THE NEAR EAST
 In swift military action against its Arab neighbors
 this week, Israel has gained a hold on the immediate
 cause of the current crisis--the Strait of Tiran--
 and achieved a number of other objectives of long
 standing.   Whether its hopes of toppling Nasir are
 fulfilled remains to be seen, but his regime will be
 shaken, as will those in other Arab states.  Western
 interests in the Arab world have been seriously dam-
 aged, but Moscow's position there has also been hurt.
 EFFECTS OF SUEZ CANAL CLOSURE
 Any prolonged closure of the canal will be disruptive
 to world trade and particularly to oil shipments.
 Egypt will lose about 20 percent of its foreign ex-

 GREEK MILITARY REGIME CONCENTRATING ON REFORMS
 While arrests and detentions keep political activity
 at a standstill,  a review of the constitution is under
 way, the shake-up of key civil service officials con-

 studying rural development needs.
 NIGERIANS MOVING CLOSER TO MILITARY SHOWDOWN
 Both Nigeria's federal government and the breakaway
 Eastern Region, which since 30 May has called itself
 the "Republic of Biafra," are gearing up for an early
 military test.   Although the timing of such a show-
 down cannot be predicted,  federal leader Gowan now
 appears too committed to back away.

 FAR EAST
 Spoiling operations by allied forces in South
 Vietnam may have disrupted or postponed Communist
 plans for a country-wide "summer campaign."   North
 Vietnamese and Viet Cong propaganda, however, main-
 tains a confident tone, claiming that Communist
 forces frustrated the 1966-67 allied dry-season of-
 fensive and that the Communists retain the initia-
 tive on the battlefield.
 In an unprecedented move suggesting new friction
 between Hanoi and Peking, a North Vietnamese party
 journal has published an indirect attack on Mao Tse-
 tung.   This open display of displeasure with Peking
 probably was intended as a warning against Chinese
 interference in Hanoi's domestic affairs or attempts
 to dictate war policy.
 In Saigon, Premier Ky and Chief of State Thieu
 are pressing efforts to organize broad support for
 their presidential bids.   Their rivalry was reflected
 in last week's National Assembly debates on election
 laws.
 Violence and chaos in China appear to be ap-
 proaching the level of last winter,  and interruptions
 in east China rail traffic are again being reported.
 There are further indications of a decline in Pe-
 king's control in many areas.   The regime's failure
 to invoke military force to restore order appears
 to reflect sharp division within the top leadership.
 The Chinese Communists took advantage of the
 Middle East conflict to stage new demonstrations
 against the British and to charge the USSR with be-
 ing the "number one accomplice" of the US in sup-
 porting Israeli "aggression."
 In Thailand,  the rate of armed encounters be-
 tween Communist insurgents and government forces in
 the northeast has diminished since the record level
 in March.   The Communists, however, continue to make
 modest gains in several other a

 VIETNAM
 Recent allied military ac-
 tions in the northern half of
 South Vietnam have probably dis-
 rupted Communist plans for a
 "summer campaign" in this area.
 The second and final
 phase,  of Operation UNION--con-
 cluded last week in the coastal
 flatlands of Quang Tin Province--
 was the latest and most success-
 ful example in recent weeks of
 allied counterthrusts against con-
 tinuing pressure in the country's
 five northernmost provinces.   US
 Marines killed some 1,500 Com-
 munist troops--many of them prob-
 ably from the North Vietnamese
 Army  (NVA)  2nd Division--and al-
 most certainly thwarted any im-
 mediate offensive against supply
 lines and bases in the coastal
 areas between Da Nang and Chu Lai.
 During scattered fighting
 just south of the Demilitarized
 Zone  (DMZ), US Marines destroyed
 a series of elaborate enemy bunker-
 and tunnel complexes from which
 Communist mortars and rockets
 could strike at the Marine base
 at Con Thien and the US 175-mm.
 artillery positions at Camp Car-
 roll.   Near Dong Ha, South Viet-
 namese Army battalions reported
 killing 150 troops of the 708th
 Viet Cong Battalion.
 In the central highlands,
 contact with Communist forces
 and enemy mortar barrages against
 American field positions have
 decreased significantly in the
 past few weeks following inten-
 sified pressure by elements of
 the US 4th Infantry Division op-
 erating in western Pleiku Prov-
 ince.   Enemy forces in this area
 are probably in need of reorgani-
 zation and resupply.   One recent
 captive claimed that the NVA 32nd
 Regiment,  currently in northwest-
 ern Pleiku,  suffered "heavy cas-
 ualties" as the result of allied
 artillery and B-52 bombardments.
 Other units in this area may have
 been similarly affected.
 Despite this series of mili-
 tary reverses,  the Communist main
 force units appear to be continu-
 ing preparations for offensive
 activity.    A high level of enemy
 movement through Laos to South
 Vietnam persists.
 NVA main force units, more-
 over,  are reoccupying previously
 held positions in the DMZ south
 of the Ben Hai River, and several
 regiments of the NVA 325th Divi-
 sion have been noted active in
 the mountains of western Quang
 Tri Province north of Khe Sanh.

 Cultural Revolution has been ap-
 parent for some time, Hanoi has
 never made such an open display
 of its disapproval. The nature
 of the trouble is not clear, but
 it is possible that the Vietnamese
 have been severely provoked by
 some recent Chinese action--per-
 haps Chinese meddling in Hanoi's
 domestic affairs or attempts to
 dictate the course of the Viet-
 namese war or peace efforts.
 Hanoi, for example, is continu-
 ing to offer to talk with the US
 in exchange for a bombing cessa-
 tion, despite Chinese criticism
 of this policy.
 It is too early to determine
 whether Hanoi intends to press
 this attack further or whether it
 was acne-shot affair.   No other
 attacks of this nature have been
 detected in the Vietnamese press.
 Peking has thus far taken no
 notice of the article in public
 and may have decided to overlook
 it.   Furthermore,  there are no signs
 that Chinese support for the Viet-
 rupted.
 DISORDER SPREADS IN COMMUNIST CHINA 25X1
 Mob violence is increasing
 in the provinces and has disrupted
 service on at least one major rail
 line.   The military establishment
 as a whole appears to be standing
 on the sidelines.   The reasons for
 this are unclear, but it could re-

 CHINA'S CASH HOLDINGS HIGH
 An improved foreign exchange
 position and increasing export
 surpluses are permitting China
 to place its first cash purchases
 of wheat.
 A recent contract with Aus-
 tralia for 1.5 million tons of
 wheat for delivery in the second
 half of 1967 specifies at Peking's
 request an option to pay the $100--
 million price in cash.  Wheat con-
 tracts normally call for China to
 pay 10 percent down and the bal-
 ance 18 months after delivery.
 China has always been reluc-
 tant to take on heavy debt obli-
 gations and has liquidated its
 debts as quickly as possible.   It
 has earned one of the best credit
 reputations in the world.   These
 new payments will serve to
 strengthen that reputation de-
 spite Peking's domestic and in-
 ternational political problems.
 China's. foreign exchange reserve
 grew about $50 million in 1966
 to a maximum of $550 million,
 and Peking probably expects fur-
 ther. improvement this year.   Its
 export surplus with the free world
 last year totaled some $15 million
 against a import surplus of $90
 million in 1965.
 Fragmentary trade returns

 China's major trading partners--
 including Japan, West Germany.
 France, and the UK--su.ggest that
 exports have continued. to grow
 more rapidly than imports.  Ma-
 chinery and equipment imports in
 1967, however, can be expected
 to increase as deliveries con-
 tinue on whole industrial plants
 purchased from the free world in
 1965.   Trade agreements concluded
 in late 1966 and early 1967 do
 not indicate substantial changes
 in China's over-all trade this
 year, and contracts concluded
 at this spring's Canton fair re-
 mained at the levels of previous
 spring fairs.
 China's financial outlook
 may not continue to be this fa-
 vorable, however. The weight of
 repayments on Western credits for
 plants bought in 1965 is increas-
 ing and remittances of hard cur-
 rency from Overseas Chinese
 dropped off some 20 percent in
 1966.  Moreover, propaganda at-
 tacks on Hong Kong, China's larg-
 est source of foreign exchange
 earnings--about $550 million in
 1966--may shake business confi-
 dence in the colony and cause a
 downturn in Peking's earnings.
 In addition, if the Cultural Rev-
 olution continues at its present
 pace, the resulting decline in
 productive activity will gradu-
 ally impair Chinese export capa-
 bilities .

 INSURGENTS STILL ACTIVE IN THAILAND
 Armed clashes between Commu-
 nist insurgents and government
 forces in northeast Thailand have
 slackened somewhat since March's
 near record level but the insur-
 gent movement still appears to be
 making modest gains in several
 other areas of Thailand.
 Communist-initiated armed
 encounters in April were less than
 half of the one-per-day average
 maintained in the northeast during
 March.   The number of government-
 initiated encounters was also down
 sharply,  suggesting that the over-
 all decline in fighting may have
 resulted partly from less aggres-
 sive government patrolling.   The
 insurgents, however, maintained a
 high level of armed propaganda
 meetings and assassinations of
 government informants and offi-
 cials.

 EUROPE
 The focus of attention in both Eastern and West-
 ern Europe remains fixed on the Arab-Israeli war.
 The Soviets have been exerting strong pressure
 on the Arabs to bring about a cease-fire in order to
 prevent further deterioration in the situation which
 might lead to a military confrontation with the West.
 As a result, Moscow's relations with Egypt and Syria
 have been severely damaged.   Soviet propaganda has
 consistently supported the Arabs, although not their
 charges that US and British planes aided Israel.
 Moscow has in the past few days provided token
 materiel to Egypt, but it has made no military ges-
 tures of support comparable to those it made in
 1956.   The Soviet naval presence in the Mediter-
 ranean is slightly above normal
 No Soviet ship   as come closer    an
 200 miles from the area of hostilities.
 Except for Rumania,  the East European countries
 too have given major propaganda support to the Arabs,
 condemning "Israeli aggression" and blaming the crisis
 on the  "US and other imperialist" powers.   Like the
 USSR, however, they have stopped short of supporting
 Arab accusations of US and British involvement.
 Popular sympathy in Western Europe has been
 strongly pro-Israeli,  although the governments have
 cautiously avoided taking sides formally.    Most have
 shown a marked preference for handling the crisis
 through the UN.   France, however, has put primary
 stress on the responsibility of the big powers, pre-

 WESTERN EUROPEAN REACTION TO THE MID-EAST CRISIS
 Popular feeling in Western
 Europe during the Arab-Israeli
 crisis has been strongly sympa-
 thetic with Israel.   The govern-
 ments,  nonetheless, mindful of
 the dangers of doing so,  are try-
 ing to avoid formally taking
 sides.   Official positions sup-
 ported,                  first,  the avoidance of
 hostilities, and then their early
 termination.    Most countries have
 shown a marked preference for
 handling the crisis within the
 UN,  although France predictably
 has put primary stress on the
 responsibility of the big powers.
 Typical of the skittish
 attitude of the Western European
 governments was the lack of en-
 thusiasm for the proposed Maritime
 Declaration upholding freedom of
 navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba.
 Objections were made that it would
 undermine the UN,  and there was
 also fear that signatories would
 later be obliged to take imple-
 menting action.   The Dutch were
 the strongest supporters of the
 Declaration and were also willing
 to participate in escort force
 planning.
 De Gaulle has refused to be
 moved by repeated demonstrations
 of French popular support for
 Israel and has adopted the most
 determinedly neutral position in
 Europe.   One of his major consid-
 erations                   is  to retain France's
 stock with the Arab states and
 the USSR.   He is intent on playing
 a major role in a possible Four-
 Power Conference on the Middle
 Page  14
 East,  and on establishing a basis
 for greater influence in the Arab
 world subsequently.
 Bonn,  although endorsing
 freedom of navigation as a legal
 principle, proclaimed a policy of
 strict neutrality when the fight-
 ing erupted.   It is always con-
 cerned that its stand on Middle
 East problems may induce the
 Arab states to recognize East
 Germany.   At the same time,  the
 pro-Israeli German press has crit-
 icized the US for "weak policies"
 in the Middle East, which encour-
 aged the USSR to try to augment
 its role there.
 The British, because of
 their economic problems  (see next
 article)  have probably been more
 concerned than other Europeans
 about the effect of a cutoff
 of Middle East oil.   London,  con-
 sequently, has threaded its way
 carefully through the crisis.    It
 was one of the sponsors of the
 Maritime Declaration,  but it did
 not want to undertake any test of
 the Strait of Tiran blockade un-
 less a fair number of other coun-
 tries participated.   After the
 outbreak of hostilities,  Foreign
 Secretary Brown told the House of
 Commons that the British concern
 was not to take sides, but to en-
 sure the return of peace.                                                                   Egyp-
 tian closure of the Suez Canal,
 however,  roused the wrath of Prime
 Minister Wilson, who denounced
 Cairo for this action and said
 the UK would not put up with
 threats to cut off oil supplies.

 Sentiment is growing within
 the British Government and else-
 where in Europe to use the current
 situation to try to obtain an
 over-all solution of the Palestine
 problem. In his speech to the

 for a "complete program" of in-

 EFFECTS OF ARAB OIL CUTOFF IN WESTERN EUROPE
 The countries of Western
 Europe, which get about 70 percent
 of their oil from the Arab world,
 have the most to lose from any
 prolonged cutoff of that source
 of supply.   Except for the UK,
 however,  none of these countries
 is in any immediate danger of an
 economic crisis resulting from the
 Arabs'  threats to deny oil to
 those they charge are supporting
 Israel in the present hostilities.
 There has been no concerted
 move in this direction by the
 Middle East oil-producing coun-
 tries, but they are denying oil
 to selected consumers--primarily
 the US and Britain.   Only Iraq
 has closed down its oil operations
 altogether.   Iran is not partici-
 pating in any embargo against US
 or West European consumers, but
 exports from its Abadan refinery
 have been halted by the refusal
 of Iraqi pilots to take tankers
 through Iraqi territorial waters
 to the port of Abadan.
 The pinch in Arab oil sup-
 plies so far is thus no more than
 an inconvenience.   A further cut-
 back could be more aggravating to
 the West Europeans.   Their current
 stockpiles, however,  coupled with
 mild rationing and increased im-
 ports from non-Arab sources would
 permit them to forgo supplies from
 Arab producers for six months
 with no major econonic damage.
 The UK is the most vulnerable
 consumer.   The need to find a sub-
 stitute for Arab oil could ad-
 versely affect the British balance
 of payments,  require London to
 implement more stringent defla-
 tionary policies,  and seek new
 financial assistance from the

 SOVIETS DISPLAY SPACE WORKHORSE AT PARIS
 Observation of the USSR's
 basic space launch system--the
 SS-6 ICBM with an upper stage--
 at the Paris air show provided
 new information on Soviet space
 hardware and handling techniques,
 but did not change current assess-
 ments of the booster's capabili-
 ties.
 The SS-6 can orbit about
 10,000 pounds using the Lunik up-
 per stage and 15,000 pounds with
 the Venik.   The Lunik-equipped
 version being displayed at Paris--
 designated SL-3--was originally
 used in the Soviet lunar program
 from 1958 to 1960.   Since then,
 it has been used for low-resolu-
 tion reconnaissance missions and
 weather satellites as well as the
 six flights;of the one-man Vostok
 capsule also on display.   The
 version equipped with the more
 powerful Venik stage--the SL-4--
 has been used for high resolution
 reconnaissance and the Voskhod
 and Soyuz manned programs.
 Photography of the rocket
 confirms that the SS-6 consists
 of four boosters around a central
 sustainer core.   All five are
 fired at launch,  and the boosters
 are dropped after their propellant
 is exhausted.   The sustainer con-
 tinues burning until its propel-
 lant is depleted, at which point
 the upper stage fires to boost
 the payload into orbit.
 The SL-3 launch system ap-
 pears to be heavier and to have
 more thrust than previously es-
 timated, but these two factors
 balance out and do not affect es-
 timates of the booster's weight-
 lifting capability.   The config-
 uration of the various components
 of the launch system is unusual
 by US standards but,  as a whole,
 is a sound design. Each section
 of the booster/sustainer combina-
 tion has four small nozzles fed
 by a single pump rather than one
 large nozzle.   This design was
 probably conceived in the late
 1940s,  and reflects the Soviet
 propensity to exploit existing
 technology to the fullest extent
 before going to more advanced de-
 signs.
 Observation of the unloading,
 transport,  and assembly of the
 SL-3 showed that it is ruggedly
 built and easy to handle.   It also
 confirmed previous evidence that
 the booster and payload are assem-
 bled in a horizontal position be-
 fore being moved to the launch
 pad.   This technique enhances the
 flexibility of Soviet space opera-
 tions by permitting quick substi-
 tution of backup vehicles and in-
 creasing the rate of launchings
 that can be undertaken from the
 availahle  launch  facilities .T

 Israel's blitz of the Arabs has raised a host
 of new problems throughout the Middle East.
 It seems certain that US--and to a lesser extent
 British and West European--diplomatic and economic
 interests in much of the Arab world have been seri-
 ously damaged.   Seven Arab countries to date have
 broken relations with the US, and Arab mobs through-
 out the area have descended on assorted American and
 British installations.

 THE WAR IN THE NEAR
 The Israeli campaign, which
 opened on 5 June with a massive at-
 tack on the air facilities of
 neighboring Arab states except
 Lebanon,  appears to be moving on--
 if not ahead of--schedule.   As of
 8 June,  Israeli forces in unknown
 strength had reached the Suez Canal,
 cutting off a substantial Egyptian
 force in the Sinai Peninsula,  and
 had taken over the Sinai side of
 the Strait of Tiran following the
 withdrawal of the Egyptian force
 there.   In Jordan, the Israelis had
 taken most of the ground west of
 the Jordan River,  rendering the West
 Bank area untenable and destroying
 Jordan's military forces in the
 process.   On the Syrian front,  an
 Israeli operation to seize the high
 ground east of Lake Tiberias seemed
 to be opening.
 The Israelis thus in four days
 had gained a significant military
 hold not only on the area of the
 immediate cause of the crisis--the
 Strait of Tiran--but also on objec-
 tives of longer standing.   These
 include substantial improvement in
 Israel's strategic geography, par-
 ticularly the broadening of the
 narrow coastal strip that enabled
 Jordanian artillery to shell Tel
 Aviv; the emotion-laden opening to
 Jews of the Old City of Jerusalem;
 the elimination of the constant
 threat of sniping and terrorism
 from Syria;  and,  if the trick can
 be turned,  the overthrow of Nasir
 amid Egypt's military debacle.
 EAST
 Nasir's Position
 The overthrow of Nasir, Israel's
 bete noire, still appears the most
 difficult achievement.   The Cairo re-
 gime initially concealed the extent
 of its; military defeat: in the air and
 in Sinai--indeed,  the Egyptian lead-
 ers probably are still. unable to
 credit the Israelis with the magni-
 tude of the air operations and  be-
 lieve their own propaganda that the
 US and UK flew air cover and pro-
 vided replacement aircraft.   Follow-
 ing this propaganda line, the Egyp-
 tians now are recalling the Suez
 War of!1956 and insisting that their
 defeat is a result of overwhelming
 Western intervention.   The break in
 relations with Washington is a move
 to support this line.
 It remains to be seen whether
 Nasir's continued posing as the anti-
 Western paladin, plus his efforts to
 rally other Arab leaders around him
 to share the burden of disaster, will
 enable him to pull through domestic-
 ally.   The atmosphere in Cairo is
 reported to be fairly grim, and the
 Egyptian radio has begun t  emnhasi7p
 "loyal   to Nasi "
 It is questionable, more-
 over, w he her any replacement could
 take a significantly different polit-
 ical line than Nasir has, given the
 degree to which popular feelings
 against the US and UK have been
 aroused.

 Impacts on Other Arab Regimes
 The Israelis may well have
 lowered the curtain on the one Arab
 leader whom, before hostilities,
 they wished to see stay in place--
 King Husayn of Jordan.   With West
 Jordan lost, with a stream of ref-
 ugees fleeing across the river to-
 ward his capital, and with his
 army--the real mainstay of his gov-
 ernment--shattered Husayn's position
 is difficult if not desperate.   He
 also bears the onus of having been
 the first Arab chief of state to
 ask for a truce from the Israelis,
 even though an Egyptian officer was
 in command of Jordan's forces.  If
 the King goes amid the chaos, some
 military officer presumably would
 attempt to restore order, but there
 is no good indication at the moment
 as to who this might be.
 The Syrian regime, threatened
 by repeated domestic tremors even
 before the war,  is in an almost
 equally dangerous situation.   If
 the Israelis strike at Syria in
 force, the regime could easily go
 under; there is already some sugges-
 tion that the north Syrian city of
 Aleppo, traditionally disaffected
 from Damascus, may be out of con-
 trol.
 Iraq,  a reasonably safe dis-
 tance from the fighting, went to
 the aid of the Jordanians but with-
 out much effect.   As was the case
 20 years ago, Baghdad can afford to
 be even more defiant in its propa-
 ganda than the Arabs closer to Is-
 rael, but the Iraqis are also
 anxious to preserve their oil pipe-
 lines and the resultant foreign ex-
 Page  22
 change.
 L               e   e anese Government
 is being as quiet as possible.
 The euphoria that put pressure
 on the Muslim states of North Af-
 rica to come to Nasir's aid is dis-
 solving, but the Algerians, having
 joined the Arab States and the Sudan
 in declaring war on Israe
 willing to stay by Nasi
 Nasir
 also evidently hopes that the Al-
 gerians will act for him diplo-
 matically.
 The feeling that last week
 swept the Arab world--that at last
 the Arabs might be closing in on the
 Israelis and their imperialist back-
 ers--found expression in attacks on
 US and UK diplomatic and commercial
 facilities throughout the area and--
 by Arab students--even in Bulgaria.
 The roster of-countries where US
 consulates and embassies have been
 attacked so far includes Libya, Tu-
 nisia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Algeria,
 Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and
 Sudan. A mob attack was also made on
 Wheelus Base in Libya.   The govern-
 ments of Yemen, the Sudan, and Iraq
 joined Egypt, Syria,  and Algeria
 in breaking relations with the US
 on 6 June,  and Mauretania followed
 suit the next day.

 have tried to forestall sabotage of
 Western-owned installations by an-
 nouncing close-downs or embargoes o
 oil shipments to countries assist-
 ing Israel.   Reports are mixed as
 to how effective these actions have
 been in practice--or in some cases,
 how effective they were intended to
 be--and a reliable assessment of
 over-all damage to Western oil fa-
 cilities in the area has still
 to be made.   Nonetheless, even non-
 Arab oil producers such as Iran,
 are under pressure to make gestures
 of solidarity.   This pressure may
 become more insistent if Nasir de-
 cides that oil restrictions are his
 last important card.
 Diplomatic Maneuvering
 International diplomacy's at-
 tempts to limit the damage have cen-
 tered at the UN, at least openly.
 Action by the Security Council
 was initially delayed by the Soviet
 refusal to agree to a simple cease-
 fire resolution--put forward by the
 US--and by the efforts of the Arabs'
 supporters--led by India--to push
 through a resolution calling for a
 withdrawal of troops to prewar posi-
 tions.   Israel said it would accept
 a cease-fire, but not troop with-
 drawal, while the UAR was unyielding
 when informed that Western powers
 could not accept any resolution that
 implicitly legitimized the Egyptian
 blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba.
 The council
 then unanimously passed a simple
 cease-fire resolution.   The next
 day, with the Arabs still adamant
 and the Israelis still moving for-
 ward, the Soviets requested an im-
 mediate meeting of the council and
 tabled a second cease-fire resolu-
 tion, this one with a deadline of
 4:00 p.m.  that day.
 These Soviet efforts, although
 a diplomatic circumvention of the
 Arab position, were evidently moti-
 vated by a desire to appear to have
 taken the lead in getting Israel to
 halt its "aggression."  The Soviet
 maneuver was blunted, not only by
 Israel's announcements that it would
 accept the cease-fire if the others
 did but by the lack of any similar
 statement from the UAR.   The UAR
 delegate insisted that the council
 condemn Israel as the aggressor and
 call for a withdrawal of troops to
 4 June positions.
 At the 7 June session, Canada
 introduced a resolution that called
 for the council president and the
 secretary general to take all means
 to bring about effective compliance
 with the two cease-fire resolutions.
 This effort could re-establish some
 sort of UN peacekeeping presence in
 the area, but it will again bring
 to the fore the question of Soviet
 and French policies toward the UN,
 inasmuch as both Moscow and Paris
 have sought to restrict the peace-
 keeping powers of the secretary
 general.

 EFFECTS OF SUEZ CANAL CLOSURE
 Uncertainty engendered by
 the political and military situa-
 tion in the Middle East had al-
 ready resulted in a virtual stand-
 down of shipping through the Suez
 Canal by 7 June, when it was
 officially closed by Egypt.
 Cairo stated that this was
 being done to avoid blockage of
 the canal by a ship immobilized
 in transit by war damage.  Israel,
 however, has been circumspect in
 its military operations against
 the waterway,  apparently to avoid
 the ill will which maritime na-
 tions expressed in 1956 when Egypt
 denied the use of the canal for
 several months by deliberately
 sinking ships in the channel.
 Any prolonged closure of the
 canal will be disruptive to inter-
 national trade and will particu-
 larly affect oil shipments.   The
 current world tanker market, how-
 ever,                          is sufficiently loose to
 provide additional tankers neces-
 sary to move available oil around
 Africa.
 By closing the canal,  Egypt
 will also suffer losses.   Canal
 revenues total $18 million per
 month,  about 20 percent of Egyp-
 tian foreign exchange earnings.
 South African ports,  already doing
 considerable business servicing
 ships which travel around Africa
 rather than through the canal,
 reportedly are preparing for in-
 creased activity.
 An average of 60 ships per
 day--about evenly divided between
 movements north and south--transit
 the canal. About 80 percent of the
 240 million tons of cargo passing
 through it annually moves north;
 four fifths of the northbound
 cargo and about one half of the
 ship movements are concerned with
 oil.   Other major northbound
 cargoes are iron ore from India
 and wheat from Australia.
 Southbound cargoes include
 US wheat shipments for India
 which,  if diverted around Africa,
 would add about $1 million per
 month to India's grain bill.  Other
 cargoes moving south through the
 canal are fertilizer for India
 and Communist China,  Soviet oil
 shipments to the Far East,  and

 GREEK MILITARY REGIME CONCENTRATING ON REFORMS
 Greece has been quiet in re-
 cent weeks as the military regime
 devoted its primary effort to
 reforming the country's institu-
 tions.
 A distinguished panel of
 jurists and lawyers was appointed
 in late May to review the consti-
 tution.   The review will take six
 months,  and is to be followed by
 a constitutional referendum, but
 this will probably not be held
 until much later.   The coup lead-
 ers have made it clear they do
 not intend to relinquish power
 until the "revolution completes
 its tasks."   According to Prime
 Minister Kollias, however,  the
 fundamental articles of the con-
 stitution will not be touched and
 the form of government will con-
 tinue as a crowned parliamentary
 democracy.
 Political activity remains
 at a standstill.   The regime re-
 cently arrested a number of non-
 Communist former deputies as part
 of its continuing efforts to dis-
 credit all political elements.
 Most of those arrested were
 closely aligned with the impris-
 oned Andreas Papandreou and were
 accused of attempting to organize
 a "patriotic front" opposition
 movement.
 ing well treated.   Interior Min-
 ister Pattakos announced that
 the possibility of Andreas'  de-
 portation is being considered re-
 gardless of the outcome of his
 trial.   Pattakos also announced
 that by 12 June about half of the
 more than 6,000 Communists who
 were originally detained will
 have been released.
 In addition to continuing
 the retirement and demotion of
 many key civil service officials,
 apparently creating chaos in many
 ministries, other measures have
 been aimed at reforming local ad-
 ministrations.   Newly appointed
 mayors and governors, many of
 whom are retired military men,
 have been directed to study rural
 development needs in order to de-
 termine necessary investment ex-
 penditures and to further the de-
 centralization and financial self-
 sufficiency of local administra-
 tions.
 Despite reports of dissen-

 NIGERIANS MOVING CLOSER TO MILITARY SHOWDOWN
 Both Nigeria's federal gov-
 ernment and the breakaway Eastern
 Region, which since 30 May has
 called itself the "Republic of
 Biafra," are gearing up for an
 early military test.  Although the
 timing of such a confrontation
 cannot be predicted,  federal
 leader Gowon now appears too
 committed to break away.
 Gowon's mobilization order
 is resulting in the rather rapid
 addition of some 3,000 or more
 army veterans to the approximately
 9,000 troops already under federal
 command.    At the same time, the
 build-up of federal forces con-
 tinues in the area immediately
 north of the Eastern Region.   It
 now includes all of two battalions
 and most of a third with the bal-
 ance on the way,  as well as a
 reconnaissance squadron,  an artil-
 lery unit,  and various su
 elements.

 in view of the federal army's
 logistical deficiencies and the
 impending heavy rains.   They might
 even try to carry out sabotage or
 other operations in the North.
 As the two sides move closer
 to a military test, Gowon has
 succeeded in improving his frail
 regime's political position, at
 least for the moment.   His decree
 of 27 May establishing 12 new
 states, which triggered the East's
 secession, also firmed up the
 Northern support on which he
 basically depends.   Last week he
 secured the participation of im-
 portant civilians from the West
 and the Mid-West,  as well as from
 the North,  in a revised Federal
 Executive Council that is supposed
 to run the government.
 Included among the 12 new
 civilian councilmen--one for each
 state--is the leader of the res-
 tive Yorubas of Western Nigeria,
 Chief Awolowo.   Prior to Ojukwu's
 secession announcement, Awolowo
 had threatened to pull the West
 out of the Nigerian federation if
 the East left.   With Northern
 troops still in place in the West,
 the ambitious Awolowo now has
 evidently decided that his and
 Yoruba interests would be best
 served at this time by what he
 probably views as a short-term
 tactical alliance with Gowon.
 Western Military Governor Adebayo,
 who last month boycotted a meeting
 of the Supreme Military Council
 as part of a Yoruba campaign to
 force the removal of the Northern
 troops,  came to Lagos on 7 June
 for top-level talks
 Although most general cargo
 shippers appear for the present
 to be complying with Gowon's
 proclaimed blockade of Eastern
 Nigeria,   this and other federal
 economic measures do riot seem
 likely to force Ojukwu to capitu-
 late.   The disposition of the
 East's important oil exports has
 not yet become a critical issue.
 Gowon is permitting tankers,  after
 being checked at Lagos,  to proceed
 to the East and Ojukwu has still
 not moved to force payment of
 taxes and royalties or, Eastern
 oil to his regime rather than to
 the established federal account
 in London.   The next quarterly
 payments of such monies would
 normally be made by the oil com-
 panies in July.
 The precautionary evacuation
 of US dependents from Eastern
 Nigeria and peripheral areas has
 been completed and a similar full-
 scale movement of British women
 and children now is under way.
 Although Ojukwu has cooperated
 fully, he clearly is unhappy over
 the exodus, whi

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Domestic developments in most countries of the
 Western Hemisphere were overshadowed this week by
 concern and dismay over the war in the Middle East.
 No government in the hemisphere has formally sided
 with either the Arab nations or the Israelis, but
 pro-Israeli sentiment generally predominates.  Bra-
 zil and Argentina, as current UN Security Council
 members, have been the most active Latin American
 governments in working for a cease-fire.   In Vene-
 zuela, the government is taking precautions against
 the possible sabotage of oil installations by pro-
 Communist terrorists sympathetic to the Arab cause.
 Meanwhile, many governments are still preoc-
 cupied over the question of what sort of interna-
 tional action--if any--could be effectively raised
 against Castro's subversive efforts in Venezuela
 and elsewhere.  Although the OAS has decided to
 hold a foreign ministers' meeting as a result of
 Venezuela's request, no date has been set and it
 is not yet clear what measures are to be discussed.
 Local problems that came to the fore in the
 hemisphere this week included such perennial ones
 as government confrontations with students in Bo-
 livia, Brazil, and Ecuador; a new tiff between
 Guyanese Premier Forbes Burnham and his junior co-
 alition partner Peter D'Aguiar over a cabinet ap-
 pointment; and increasing tensions in Guatemala
 because of terrorism--in this instance, right-wing
 terrorism against leftists and moderates errone-
 ously judged to be "Communists."
 One new problem in the area is the take-over of
 the tiny British Caribbean island of Anguilla by
 local residents demanding more autonomy.   British
 authorities appear to be in no hurry to help the
 central government on the island of St. Kitts re-
 assert its authority until it devises a plan to
 restore its political credit with the Anguillans.

 VENEZUELA VERSUS CUBA
 The Council of the Organiza-
 tion of American States  (OAS)  has
 approved Venezuela's request for
 a meeting of foreign ministers to
 consider action against Cuban
 subversion in the hemisphere. At
 a special meeting on 5 June, the
 OAS Council appointed a nine-mem-
 ber committee to recommend a date,
 place,  and agenda for the meeting.
 OAS members voted unanimously
 for the meeting,  but strong dif-
 ferences remain as to what action
 the OAS could or should take. Some
 countries,  including Colombia and
 Bolivia,  favor strong action
 rather than a simple condemna-
 tion.   Other countries--Brazil,
 Chile, and Mexico--may hope that
 the whole matter can be swept
 under the rug.   The Brazilian
 and Chilean representatives quali-
 fied their affirmative vote by
 stating it did not commit them to
 any particular course of action.
 The Chilean further added that
 the matter is of concern to the
 United Nations as well as the
 US.   The Mexican representative
 also struck a "cautious note" in
 explaining his vote by calling
 for a "careful study."   Many of
 the OAS countries believe their
 internal problems and their poli-
 cies on world trade are more im-
 portant than the threat of Cuban
 subversion.
 In Venezuela, meanwhile,  the
 guerrillas are lying low, whether
 for tactical reasons or as a re-
 sult of their losses.   Except for
 the ambush of a military truck
 convoy in the area east of Caracas
 where the Cuban-supported landing
 took place on 8 May,  there have
 been no serious internal security
 incidents.   The arrest of top
 guerrilla leader Americo Martin
 on 2 June may prolong this in-
 activity, but it probably will
 not seriously undercut the guer-
 rillas' ability to carry out
 offensive operations,.
 The Venezuelan port workers
 have supported their government's
 campaign against Cuba by ordering
 a boycott of ships of. countries
 trading with Cuba.   On 6 June
 stevedores at La Guaira, Caracas'
 port, refused to unload a Jap-
 anese ship.   The boycott is to be
 "selective" to avoid damaging
 Venezuela's economy, but the gov-
 ernment, frustrated by its in-
 ability to strike back hard at
 Cuba, may encourage the port
 workers to apply the boycott more
 widely.
 Former president Romulo Be-
 tancourt has echoed the thoughts
 of the labor leaders by pointing
 out the importance to Cuba of
 trade with the United Kingdom,
 France, Canada,  and Spain and has
 stated specifically that those
 countries must be made to choose
 between Cuba and Venezuela.   He
 went further, however, than gov-
 ernment or labor spokesmen in de-
 claring that "if Cuba continues
 its policy of aggression" the
 time will come when the Caribbean
 countries should undertake com-
 bined armed action against Cuba.

 BOLIVIAN ARMY REASSESSING COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM
 Guerrilla successes have
 forced the Bolivian Army Command
 to undertake a review of its whole
 counterinsurgency program.   The
 review was precipitated by the
 army's poor showing in a clash
 on 30-31 May near El Espino, when
 guerrillas first engaged and then
 eluded an army unit that has been
 considered one of the country's
 best trained and equipped.
 The guerrillas'  command of
 the zone was further demonstrated
 on 2 June when sabotage of a sec-
 tion of the vital Santa Cruz -
 Yacuiba railroad forced total
 suspension of service over the
 line.   This action, the first
 insurgent strike at a strategic
 installation, could presage moves
 against nonmilitary targets,  in-
 cluding oil pipelines.
 While the army is engaged
 in the southeast,  the guerrillas
 may be preparing for action in
 the northeast.   Villagers in the
 rugged North Yungas Region some
 45 miles from La Paz claim that
 30-40 "armed and bearded stran-
 gers" are undergoing guerrilla war-
