 REMARKS BY PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON           !
 BEFORE THE MID-AMERICA COMMITTEE,
 CHICAGO,  ILLINOIS  --  OCTCBER 29, 1985
 The foreign policy issue which dominates
 discussion today is the relationship between the two
 superpowers and the upcoming summit meeting between
 President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev.
 Before discussing that issue, I believe it would be
 useful to step back and put East/West relations in
 historical perspective.
 Thirty-two years ago I took my first trip around
 the world.   In 70 days, Mrs. Nixon and I visited all
 of the countries in Asia with which the United States
 had diplomatic relations.   Four weeks ago I completed
 another trip around the world in which I went to
 several of the countries I have visited in 1953.   But
 I was unable to visit Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,
 Afghanistan, and Iran, all of which I had visited in
 1953.   On the plus side, however, I spent a week in
 the People's Republic of China with which the United
 States had no diplomatic relations in 1953.
 Thirty-two years ago, every leader of the
 countries I visited feared the military power of the
 communist Chinese who had just fought the United
 States to a standstill in Korea.   In most of these
 countries, the PRC was supporting communist revolu-
 tionaries against the established governments.

 Today, China has good relations with all of its
 neighbors in Southeast Asia except for Vietnam,
 Cambodia, Laos and Afghanistan which have come under
 Soviet domination.
 There has been another change on the negative
 side of the ledger.  Thirty-two years ago, the United
 States had unquestioned nuclear superiority over the
 Soviet Union.   Until the mid-70s, that superiority
 was the major factor in preventing World War III and
 deterring Soviet aggression, particularly in the
 Mideast in 1957 and 1973, in Berlin in 1959, and in
 the Caribbean in 1961.
 Today we no longer have that superiority.   This
 is not to say that we are a helpless giant.  We are
 ahead in submarine and air-launch missiles.  But the
 ti
 Soviet Union has acquired decisive superiority in
 strategic land-based missiles, the most powerful and
 accurate nuclear weapons.   With their 300 SS-18s
 which carry 3,000 warheads, they can take out all of
 the U.S. land-based missile force and have enough
 left over to take out our major cities.   This amounts
 to a first strike capability.  This does not mean
 that they are going to launch a nuclear war.  While
 they are dedicated to the goal of expanding communist
 domination in the world, they are not fools.  They
 know that they would suffer enormous retaliation and
 a nuclearized Europe and United States is not an

 attractive prize of victory.  The danger the United
 States and the West face is not nuclear war but
 nuclear blackmail.   President Reagan's MX program,
 his SDI program, and his arms control initiatives
 have the purpose of reducing that danger.
 Let us now examine another change on the
 positive side.  Thirty-two years ago, many
 non-communists in countries I visited -- teachers,
 labor leaders, members of the media -- honestly
 wondered whether the communist systems of the PRC and
 the Soviet Union might be better models for progress
 for newly independent countries than those offered by
 the Western democracies.
 That is no longer the case.   Why?   Sixty-five
 years ago a starry-eyed American reporter came back
 from the Soviet Union and wrote,  "I have been over
 into the future and it works."   Now we have seen that
 future and it doesn't work.   It doesn't work in
 Eastern Europe, it doesn't work in the Third World --
 Cuba, Nicaragua, Angola, Mozambique, Vietnam, and
 Ethopia are economic disaster areas.   Most sig-
 nificantly, it does not work in the Soviet Union.
 That is why Gorbachev's primary goal is to get the
 Soviet economy moving again.
 The only economic success stories since the end
 of World War II are in non-communist nations which
 have turned to the market rather than to government
 for progress.  We have heard a lot about the Japanese
 and the German miracles, our two major enemies in

 World War II now are our two major competitors.  But
 there are other miracles in the making, particularly
 on the rimland of Asia.  Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
 Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand are poised for
 economic takeoffs.
 The most striking example of change is in the
 PRC.  When I visited Beijing in 1972, 1976, and 1979,
 the Chinese leaders attacked the Soviet Union as
 "capitalist roaders" where athletes, actors, and
 politicians became millionaires.   In 19 79 , Deng
 Xi aopi ng began a dramatic program of reform.   Until
 1979, the effect of the PRC's policy was to give
 every Chinese an equal share in poverty.   Today, they
 are giving some a chance to earn their way out of
 poverty.   Deng recognizes that his choice is between
 equality at the price of poverty or progress at the
 price of inequality.  As he compares the plight of
 his desperately poor country with what Chinese have
 accomplished in Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, he
 has made the choice of choosing progress with some
 inequality over rigid equality and no progress.
 The most striking success story is in
 agriculture.   With their new incentive system,
 Chinese farmers produce enough to feed the one
 billion people of the PRC and are exporting food
 abroad.   Russian peasants still working in communist
 communes are unable to produce enough to feed the 250
 million people of the Soviet Union and the government
 has to import food from abroad.

 One of the more obvious examples of change is in
 women's clothes.   When I met with Mao and Chou En-lai
 in 1972, the young women who translated for us were
 dressed in baggy gray Mao suits and had severe short
 haircuts.  The Chinese communists had taken too
 seriously the admonition of Professor Higgins, "Why
 can't a woman be like a man?"
 When I visited Canton this year, we were served
 by beautiful Chinese girls wearing high heels and
 multi-colored stylish gowns.   My host observed, "You
 will note that we have more color in our clothes
 today.  The same is true of our ideology."  This is,
 of course,  somewhat of an overstatement.   It is a
 mistake for naive visitors from the United States to
 gush that the Chinese have become capitalists.   The
 Chinese leaders are dedicated communists but they are
 also Chinese.   They use capitalist tools to achieve
 communist goals.   For them, as an editorial in Ebony
 magazine pointed out in another context, the color of
 freedom is not red, white, and blue but green.
 Some caveats must be borne in mind: as Chairman
 Deng tries to expand his reforms into special
 economic zones in urban areas, he has run into
 problems which inevitably plague free economies --
 corruption, inflation, and shortages.   The danger
 that faces the PRC today is not in turning back to
 doctrinaire Marxism but in going forward too fast.
 Deng recognizes this danger and is shrewdly

 developing policies to deal with it.
 Whether the policy of reforms will be continued
 in the future depends in great part on the leadership
 of one of the world's most remarkable leaders, the 81
 year old Deng Xiaoping.        He is in excellent health
 today; he looks better than he did when I saw him in
 1982 and 1979.  But he is aware of his mortality.   He
 is preparing younger men to take over when he leaves
 the scene.   Unlike other strong leaders -- Churchill,
 Adenauer, and deGaulle come to mind -- but like
 Yoshida of Japan he does not put down his potential
 successors.   He tries to build them up.  The question
 is which one will be strong enough to provide the
 leadership China will need in the future.   History
 tells us that collective leadership doesn't work --
 not even in a small country like Uruguay.                             It can't
 possibly work in providing leadership for one bill ion
 Chinese.
 The least likely danger to the reform movement
 is the one most talked about -- that the Chinese may
 turn back to the Soviet Union in their search for
 economic progress.  The Soviet model simply doesn't
 work.   As one Chinese leader put it to me, with
 understandable overstatement, unless the Soviets open
 up to the West and reform their economy as China is
 attempting to do, the Soviet Union in the next
 century will "disappear" as a great nation.
 With these considerations in mind, it is vitally
 important to recognize that more important than our

 military relationship are the economic ties which
 China has with the United States, Japan, and Europe.
 If we can give them an economic stake in good
 relations with the West, they will not turn back to
 their big neighbors from the north.
 Let us now turn to the Soviet Union.   I do not
 know Mikhail Gorbachev but I knew those like Suslov
 who sponsored and educated him and on this trip I
 talked to several who do know him from China,
 Pakistan, and England.  We Americans, and this is
 particularly so in the media, tend to allow style to
 blind ourselves to substance.   Fb r example, in 1955
 when Khrushchev succeeded Stalin I recall the
 briefing a Soviet expert gave to the National
 Security Council.  He predicted that Khrushchev would
 not bean effective leader because he was poorly
 educated, wore ill-fitting clothes, drank too much
 and spoke poor Russian.   Foster Dulles disagreed.   He
 said,  "Mr. President, anyone who claws his way to the
 top in the communist system is bound to be a strong
 man and a dangerous adversary."  He proved to be
 righ t.
 Today, we are deluged with reports about
 Gorbachev's style.   He has a good education.   He is
 well-dressed.   He has a good sense of humor.   He has
 excellent eye contact, a firm handshake, and a
 melodious voice; his wife wears designer clothes.
 This is all very interesting but it does not
 indicate that he may prove to be more reasonable.

 On the contrary, he will be more formidable than his
 predecessors.  That is the opinion of all of the
 leaders I met on my recent trip.  As one of them put
 it:    "Gorbachev is a thoroughbred communist; he is a
 product of the system; he will try to improve the
 system but he will not change it; he will continue to
 pursue traditional Soviet foreign policy goals."
 This is what we can expect:
 He will not engage in any rash new foreign
 policy adventures.   He has enough on his plate to
 digest already.
 He will be tough in keeping what he has; he
 can't risk losing any part of the Soviet empire he
 has inherited.
 He will try to romance the Chinese -- without
 success -- as long as China has an economic stake in
 good relations with the West.
 He will try to drive a wedge between Europe and
 the United States.
 He will try to reduce tensions with the United
 Sta to s. Why?  Because his primary concern is not
 fear of war but the need, to get the Soviet economy
 moving again.   Because the Soviet economy is only
 one-half of the size of ours, he has to spend twice
 as much on defense to stay even with the United
 States . His opposition to the Star Wars program is

 not primarily because he fears the United States
 might gain a military advantage but because of the
 enormous burden such a program would impose on the
 strapped Soviet economy.      He needs the trade and
 technology from the West which would come if he could
 reduce tensions with the United States.
 Getting the Soviet economy moving again is his
 first priority, in part because this would benefit
 the Soviet people but primarily because without a
 stronger economy he cannot have a strong foreign
 policy.  The Soviet system is no longer a model for
 Third World countries where the future of the world
 will be determined in the twenty-first century.   This
 means that while he can still project his military
 power in the target areas, he cannot project his
 ideas.
 Let us turn to President Reagan's priorities.
 The primary objective of his foreign policy is to
 reduce the danger of war.  His critics contend that
 if this is the case he should join Gorbachev in
 making arms control the major subject for negotiation
 at Geneva.  The President sincerely wants arms
 control but he recognizes that the only purpose of
 arms control is to reduce the danger of war and that
 it is not the existence of arms but the failure to
 resolve political differences which lead to their use
 which brings war.   Deng Xiaoping made this point
 in his interview in Time magazine this week.

 Approved For Release 2009/09/25: CIA-RDP87M00539R002003130001-9
 When he was asked about Gorbachev's proposal to cut
 nuclear arsenals by 50 percent, he observed that the
 United States and the Soviet Union now have enough to
 destroy the world ten times and that reducing that by
 50 percent would mean that each would have enough
 left to destroy the world only five times.   He then
 observed,  "Even if there will be an agreement of a
 50 percent reduction, I don't think it will solve the
 present problem."  President Reagan is on target when
 he insists that conflicts which could lead to the use
 of arms must be addressed if we want to attack the
 central problem of reducing the danger of war.
 However,  as a political realist he knows that he must
 make a credible effort to reach an arms control
 agreement with the Soviet Union if he is to retain
 support for necessary defense budgets in the United
 States and the support of our allies abroad.
 How will the two leaders get along when they
 meet each other?   The answer to that question is easy
 -- they will hit it off very well.   Ronald Reagan
 can't help being a gentleman and Gorbachev is too
 smart not to act like one.   But it is also
 irrelevant.
 In the middle ages, a king was about to wage war
 on one of his neighbors.  One of his advisors urged
 that he meet with his neighboring monarch so that
 they could get to know each other and understand each
 other and then it might not be necessary to go to
 war.   The king responded, "We understand each other;

 Approved For Release 2009/09/25: CIA-RDP87M00539R002003130001-9
 11
 we both want the same thing."
 President Reagan and Gorbachev understand each
 other; but they don't want the same thing.   Gorbachev
 wants to defend and extend communism.   President
 Reagan wants to defend and extend freedom.   We have
 irreconcilable differences, some of which will never
 be settled.   But we have one common interest -- to
 avoid war over our differences.   But even in this
 respect we also have a profound difference.
 President Reagan seeks peace as an end in itself.
 Gorbachev seeks victory without war.
 Gorbachev's first priority at Geneva will be to
 prove'to his colleagues in the Soviet hierarchy that
 he is a strong leader and able to hold his own with
 the leader of the Free World.   As his second
 priority, he wants to come through as a reasonable
 leader seeking peace in order to appeal to the peace
 activists in Europe and the United States.   But if he
 has to choose between the two, coming out as a strong
 leader will be his first priority.
 President Reagan does not need to prove that he
 is a strong leader.  His primary goal will be to
 prove that he is for peace.   This is the case for two
 reasons; because he sincerely believes in peace and
 wants to be remembered in history as one who made a
 breakthrough for peace.
 What then can we expect at Geneva?  Because the
 parties are so far apart, it would be unrealistic  to
 expect that a final major arms control agreement

 could be negotiated.   But it is possible that the two
 leaders could agree on general principles and goals
 for arms control and set up a process which would
 make it possible for the two to sign an agreement
 before President Reagan completes his term of
 office.
 We cannot expect that the Soviets will cease
 being communists but the Geneva summit will provide
 an opportunity to make the point that both the Soviet
 Union and the United States have an interest in not
 being drawn into war by Third World conflicts.   The
 Soviets face a choice -- to seek a better relation-
 ship with the United States or to probe in Third
 World areas where we have a vital interest.   They
 can't talk peace in Geneva and engage in and support
 war in Asia, Africa,  and Central America.
 There will be agreements on consular, cultural
 and commercial issues which while not addressing our
 fundamental differences can provide contacts which
 could marginally improve the atmosphere for more
 constructive negotiations about those differences.
 Does this mean because there will not be a major
 arms control agreement that the Geneva summit will be
 a failure?  On the contrary, the meeting in Geneva
 will be a success.   It will be an unquestioned
 success from a public relations standpoint.   From a
 substantive standpoint, we can expect at least one
 major achievement -- the agreement of the two leaders
 to meet again.

 As Henry Grunwald has pointed out, the tension
 between the United States and the Soviet Union is not
 a problem for which there is a solution but a
 permanent condition which can be alleviated but not
 cured.   Regular summit meetings between the leaders
 of the two superpowers are essential if we  are to
 manage those differences over the long period of time
 in which we will continue to have them.
 The greatest danger of war we face today is not
 that one nation would launch a nuclear strike against
 the other.  The greatest danger of war is mis-
 calculation.   When the two leaders meet they may not
 like each other and they may not trust each other but
 at least the very fact that they know each other will
 mean that they will reduce the possibility that one
 might misjudge the other and underestimate the
 other's will to resist in the event that actions are
 taken which threaten its vital interests.
 In the run up to Geneva, it is vitally important
 to keep that meeting in perspective.   Because
 Gorbachev is only 57 years of age and could possibly
 live long enough to meet with as many as five
 American Presidents, the point has been made that he
 is not in a hurry.   If he can't make a deal he likes
 with President Reagan, he will wait for his
 successor.   Others breathlessly intone that this is
 President Reagan's only chance to assure his place

 in history as a peacemaker.  Not true.   This is
 President Reagan's first meeting with the Russians
 but not his last.   It is far more important for him
 to lay a solid foundation now for a better agreement
 later than to make a bad agreement now in order not
 to disappoint excessive public expectations.  The
 greatest service he could provide is to leave a
 process for his successors for negotiating over our
 differences in the future and not fighting over
 them.
 Looking ahead,  I do not believe that there will
 be a nuclear war.    On the other hand, I do not see a
 world without conflict.   The greatest advantage the
 United States has in this continuing conflict is not
 the power of our arms which can prevent defeat but
 the power of our ideas which can assure victory.
 That is why it is so important for the economy of the
 United States to be strong, free, and productive.

 need a strong productive economy as a powerful
 example to others around the world of how freedom
 works.
 We are engaged in a long struggle.  We are on
 the right side.   But history is strewn with the
 wreckage of superior civilizations of the past who
 were overrun by barbarians.   British strategist,  Sir
 Robert Thompson has written, "National strength
 equals people plus applied resources times will."  We
 have the people.   We have the resources.   The
 question is do we have the will to continue to
 provide leadership for the Free World?   It is
 understandable that many Americans tire of this role.
 We are just recovering from the trauma of defeat in
 Vietnam.  As we celebrated the fourtieth anniversary
 of the United Nations this past week, we were
 constantly reminded that a great majority of the new
 nations who have joined that organization since it
 was founded 40 years ago consistently vote against
 the United States, even though we provide generous
 foreign aid to most of them.
 Despite these understandable frustrations, the
 United States must continue to play the role as the
 major leader in the Free World.  We must do so
 because without the United States the rest of the
 world would be helpless before totalitarian
 aggression.  We must do so not just for others but
 for ourselves.  Whether we like it or not, we must

 Approved For Release 2009/09/25: CIA-RDP87M00539R002003130001-9
 recognize the fact that we live in one world.   The
 United States cannot long exist as an island of
 freedom in a world dominated by totalitarians.
 There is another reason which cannot be
 described in material terms.  General deGaulle once
 said, "France is never her true self unless she was
 engaged in a great enterprise."  This is true of
 nations, it is true of individuals, it is true of
 every man and woman in this room.  To serve the cause
 of peace and freedom in the world is a great
 enterprise.   Leadership in the Free World is not a
 burden to be borne grimly but a challenge worthy of a
 great people.
