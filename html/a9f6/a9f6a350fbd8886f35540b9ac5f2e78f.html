 FOREWORD
 This Handbook I                   I, one of a series,
 provides basic information on Cambodia.    Unlike earlier
 Handbooks, which appeared in a bound format, this document
 is publ shed looseleaf to permit its updating in a rapidly
 changing Southeast Asian scene.  The Handbook consists of
 three Parts.         As the situation may require, supplemental
 chapters may be prepared or other materials added.  The
 component chapters incorporated in this printing are:
 Part I                   THE SETTING
 Chapter I        2i.story of Cambodia
 Part II                1         -1 ENVIRONMENT
 Chapter I          The Land
 Chapter II         The People
 Chapter III        The Economy
 Chapter IV         Transportation
 Chapter V          Telecommunications
 Part III                           INTERNAL SECURITY
 Chapter I          Armed Forces
 Chapter II         Police and Intelligence Services
 Chapter III        Subversion and Insurgency
 Each Chapter is described by its respective Table
 of Contents which includes references to appropriate
 maps, tables and photographs.      A Reading List is included,
 when relevant, after each Chapter.  An Historical Chro-
 nology and a Recommended Films list are found in an
 Appendix.

 The Handbook was produced by CIA and, with the excep-
 tion of the Armed Forces chapter which was coordinated
 with DIA, has not been coordinated outside the Agency. A
 variety of classified and open sources was used in its
 production.  NIS publications provided general background,
 updated to reflect changes which have taken place since
 Sihanouk's fall from power and the outbreak of war in Cam-
 bodia.   Component chapters were written by Agency special-
 ists in the fields of economics, geography, medicine,
 population, telecommunications, and transportation.  The
 chapters on history, armed forces, police and intelligence
 insurgency were written by
 25X1                                                       and coordinated with current
 intelligence an  area des      specialists.  The several
 classifications of the component chapters (SECRET or
 SECRET/NOFORN) derive from the intelligence materials
 used in their preparation.                   The overall classification of
 the Handbook is SECRET/NOFORN.

 The remnant of the once vast and powerful Khmer Empire,
 Cambodia is the oldest state of the Indochinese peninsula.
 Its history -- much of it lost in legend -- reaches back to
 the ancient kingdom of Funan, which arose during the first
 century of the Christian era.   Today one of the smallest
 countries of Southeast Asia, Cambodia is acutely conscious
 of the fact that some seven centuries ago her suzerainty
 extended across the breadth of Southeast Asia from the
 South China Sea to the Bay of Bengal.   The country has
 witnessed a long history of Thai and Vietnamese encroach-
 ments, and it was only the establishment of the French pro-
 tectorate in 1863 that prevented the final dissolution of
 Cambodia as a nation.
 Of all.the prehistoric peoples who lived in the land
 now known as Cambodia, only the descendents of the Chams
 and the primitive Khmer Loeu tribes have survived.   Many
 diverse peoples contended for the fertile lands that form
 the Mekong River valley and the central plain of present-
 day Cambodia.   By the first century A.D., the Khmer people
 were an already racially mixed group from the north, sharing
 the Mekong with the Indianized Funanese and the Cham.  The
 Funanese had overcome the other tribes by the third century
 A.D., and the area became known as Funan.  During the fourth
 century, an Indian Brahman ruled the country, bringing Hindu
 influence to bear on its customs, legal code, architecture
 and alphabet, which is still to be seen ia modified forms.
 The Khmer state of Chen-la, located farther north on
 the Mekong, was the chief vassal state of Funan.   By the
 middle of the sixth century, it controlled and eventually
 annexed Funan.   From 535 to 802, the Khmer were consoli-
 dated into a powerful empire which eventually extended its
 hegemony over all of present-day Cambodia and much of Thai-
 land, Vietnam, and Laos.   The northern boundaries reached
 Yunnan province of southern China.   It was during this
 period that the name "Cambodia" was derived.  According to
 legend, the founder of the Khmer Dynasty was Kambu Svayam-
 bhuva; his subjects were called "Kambuja", sons of Kambu,
 hence the French "Cambodge" and the English Cambodia.
 This is the king to whom Cambodian monarchs trace their
 lineage.

 tower rises over 220 feet.          Surrounding moat has maximum width
 of 660 feet.
 Cambodia reached its zenith during the Angkorean or
 Kambujan Era (802 - 1432).   Parts of Burma were added to
 the empire, and great political, economic and cultural a-
 chievements were recorded.                              The magnificent monuments of
 Angkor Thom, the capital city, and the temple complex of
 Angkor Wat were remarkable accomplishments.   Paved avenues,
 waterways, and irrigation systems were laid out.   Scholars,
 artists, and religious teachers traveled to the cultural
 centers of India.   The ancient kings, greatest of whom was
 Jayavarman VII, who reigned from 1181 to 1201, acted as
 patrons of learning and the arts.   The remarkable empire
 arose and peaked while Europe was passing through the
 Dark Ages.   Present-day Cambodians recall its glories with
 the same sense of pride that modern Italians feel for an-
 cient Rome.

 by Suryavarman II.
 The Empire began to disintegrate after the death of
 Jayavarman VII.  An important contributing factor, start-
 ing in the 11th century, was the change from Brahmanism
 to the passive new religion of Theravada Buddhism which
 called for a peaceful environment, incompatible within an
 overextended empire whose societal system was based upon
 slaves captured in war.   Never more than a loose political
 structure even at its height, the Khmer Empire faced in-
 creasing pressure from other maturing peoples.   The land
 was racked by constant dynastic strife and repeated Thai
 invasions, during which thousands of artists and scholars
 were carried off to slavery.   The last sacking and aban-
 donment of the capital city, Angkor, in 1432, is considered
 the turning point in Cambodian history.   Too close to the
 Thai border, Angkor never again would be a capital.   In
 time, jungle overran the great temples and monuments that
 were too costly to maintain, and knowledge of Angkor grad-
 ually faded from Cambodian consciousness.

 The 400-year period between abandonment of Angkor and
 the advent of the French protectorate, one of gradual decay,
 was marked by defensive struggle against Thailand and Annam.
 Unlike the experience of Vietnam, there was little contact
 with European merchants and missionaries.   In its efforts
 to survive, the royal court was forced to move from place
 to place, to play off one antagonist against another, and
 to relinquish choice territory.

 In the face of increased Thai and Vietnamese pressure,
 the Cambodian king sought French protection, little real-
 izing that the treaty of 1863 which made his country a
 French protectorate would lead to complete French domina-
 tion.   The treaty gave the French exclusive control over
 Cambodian foreign affairs, the right to defend Cambodia,
 and installed a French Resident Superior as executive.
 The 1884 Conventions reduced the country to semi-colo-
 nial status and, in 1887, Cambodia's colonial status
 became official when it was made a part of the French
 Indochina Union with Cochin China, Annam, Tonkin, Laos
 and the French leasehold of Kwang-chow-wan.
 French colonial rule both preserved and modified tra-
 ditional Cambodian society.   Cambodia was protected against
 Thai/Vietnamese conquest and her identity was preserved
 within the structure of the French Indochina Union.   The
 status and dignity of the monarchy was restored, and
 languishing arts and crafts were revived and made known
 to the world.   French policies changed the character of
 Cambodian society.   For example, liberal immigration laws
 encouraged Chinese and Vietnamese to enter the country and
 intermarry with Cambodians.   Capitalizing on the Cambodian

 traditional distaste for commerce, the Chinese were able to
 take over many vital functions as merchant brokers, bankers
 and owners of transport operations and plantations.  The
 Vietnamese gravitated toward shopkeeping, artisanry and
 clerking in the civil service and French business establish-
 ments.   The French brought Cambodia into the modern world by
 abolishing slavery and hereditary bondage, establishing sec-
 ular schools for both sexes, laying the foundation for a
 modern bureaucracy, and introducing Western concepts of art,
 science, law and government.   Phnom Penh was laid out on a
 spacious scale and provided with aeport, a road network was
 created, and a railroad was built, linking Phnom Penh with
 the Thai border.   These Western innovations scarcely touched
 the peasantry, some eighty percent of the population, who
 continued to cultivate small family holdings of ten acres
 or less.   They had a direct impact only upon the upper
 socio-economic levels in the urban areas which formed the
 pivotal segment that absorbed, adapted and disseminated
 Western ideas and led the independence movement to its
 successful culmination.
 For all their benefits, the French retarded Cambodian
 development by running the country themselves and by pro-
 viding the Cambodians with limited administrative and tech-
 nical training and experience.   The classical education
 given the elite left them unprepared to handle the prac-
 tical problems of managing a country.   Even today there is
 a shortage of Cambodians equipped to cope with government
 administration, economic development, and technical ser-
 vices.   Chinese still dominate commerce; most engineers,
 technicians, and craftsmen are Vietnamese; and foreign ad-
 visors are needed to assist in operating complicated ma-
 chinery.
 After the death of King Sisowath Monivong in 1941, the
 French by-passed his sons, feeling that they were too in-
 dependence minded.   For the throne, they selected instead
 his 18 year old grandson, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.  The
 French thought Sihanouk would be easy to manipulate, little
 imagining that he would develop a serious interest in
 governing Cambodia, would promulgate its constitution in
 1947, and would father its independence from France in late
 1953.

 After the French defeat in Europe, the Japanese received
 permission from the Vichy government to send troops to Hanoi
 and Saigon.   The Thai, taking advantage of French weakness,
 attempted to acquire Cambodian and Laotian territory and
 invaded Cambodia in January 1941.   The Japanese eventually
 intervened and forced the French to sign a treaty giving
 Thailand a part of northwestern Cambodia.   The French main-
 tained nominal control of Indochina until the spring of
 1945 when an unexpected Japanese coup de force removed the
 entire Vichy French colonial administration.  At Japanese
 suggestion, King Sihanouk proclaimed Cambodia's indepen-
 dence on March 12, but this independence was only nominal
 since Cambodia was linked with the Japanese Greater East
 Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.   This brief taste of freedom
 from French control laid the basis for the anti-French
 movements that characterized Cambodian politics during the
 first decade following World War II.
 The French resumed control in Cambodia after the Japan-
 ese surrender, but now Sihanouk began the negotiations de-
 signed to achieve a greater degree of independence for the
 country.   In February 1946 the French protectorate was re-
 placed by a new arrangement under which Cambodia was rec-
 ognized as an autonomous kingdom within the French Union,
 but with the French retaining considerable control.  A
 Constituent Assembly was elected in September 1946 and in
 May 1947 the Constitution was promulgated.   Both houses of
 the Cambodian legislature were convened in early 1948 and
 parliamentary government began.   Unfortunately, political
 instability emerged almost immediately, with several na-
 tionalistic groups opposing both French rule and Sihanouk's
 government.   To prevent complete chaos, Sihanouk dissolved
 the National Assembly in September 1948 and, with the
 assistance of several ministers, ruled alone for the next
 two years.   Following the September 1951 elections, another
 period of unstable parliamentary government ensued.   In
 June 1952 Sihanouk again assumed direct rule, exercising
 this power until February 1955.
 While he ruled, Sihanouk concentrated on gaining in-
 dependence from the French and, in November 1949, obtained
 a new treaty that gave Cambodia more powers and made her
 an Associated State within the French Union.   Sihanouk
 became impatient with what he considered French procras-
 tination and began a public campaign against French rule
 in April 1953.   In June he went into voluntary exile in
 Thailand, refusing to return to the capital until given
 French assurances of complete independence for Cambodia.
 The French, mired down in their struggle with the Viet

 Minh, announced in July their willingness to grant indepen-
 dence to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.   Subsequent negotia-
 tions produced several important concessions whereby France
 relinquished practically all the rights and powers it had
 retained in Cambodia since the treaty of 1949.  The last of
 these concessions was signed in November 1953, and Sihan-
 ouk returned to the capital in triumph to proclaim Cam-
 bodia's independence on November 9.   International recogni-
 tion of Cambodia's independence was accorded by the Final
 Declaration at the Geneva Conference on Indochina on July
 21, 1954.  At Geneva, it was Sihanouk's diplomatic skill
 and stubborness that led to the inclusion of a separate
 agreement providing for the withdrawal from Cambodia by
 October 20, 1954 of all Viet Minh forces and French units,
 except for a training mission.  Unlike Vietnam and Laos,
 Cambodia emerged from the Geneva agreements with no loss
 of territory.
 A nationwide referendum was held in February 1955 as
 an expression of support for Sihanouk's policies and rule
 for the previous two and one-half years.  Although he re-
 ceived over 99 percent of the vote, Sihanouk abdicated
 the throne in March in favor of his parents so he could
 engage more freely in political activity.   He immediately
 began building his own personal political vehicle, the
 Sangkum (officially, the Sangkum Reastr Niyum or People's
 Socialist Community).   The new National Assembly elected
 in September was composed entirely of Sangkum members.
 When his father died in 1960, Sihanouk refused the throne
 and, instead, consolidated his position by creating and
 assuming the office of Chief of State which held all the
 powers of the vacant throne.
 Diplomatic relations were maintained exclusively with
 the Western powers during the early stages of independence,
 and Sihanouk seriously considered aligning himself with the
 West.   He was strongly influenced by Nehru, however, and
 gradually developed a policy of neutralism.   His first
 international declaration of nonalignment was at the Afro-
 Asian Conference at Bandung in April 1955.   The National
 Assembly supported his policy in a vote taken later in the
 year.   Sihanouk's foreign policy was keyed to securing
 international guarantees, or at least assurances of respect,
 for Cambodia's territorial integrity.  Diplomatic relations
 with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland were
 established in 1956.  Chinese Communist economic aid was
 accepted in 1956 and formal recognition of Communist China
 was finally announced in mid-1958.

 Figure 5.   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former
 King and former Chief of State of Cambodia.
 February 1970.
 Relations with Thailand and South Vietnam gradually
 deteriorated after Cambodian independence.  With a cen-
 turies-old background of mutual suspicion and conflict,
 matters became worse with sporadic emotional flare-ups
 over border incidents, disputed territory, and alleged
 Thai and Vietnamese support to Cambodian subversive
 groups.   Sihanouk broke relations with Thailand in Oc-
 tober 1961 and with South Vietnam in August 1963.
 In 1963 Cambodia's foreign policy was altered to fol-
 low an increasingly pro-Communist line.   Sihanouk became
 convinced that the Communists were going to win an early
 and decisive victory in South Vietnam and that Communist
 China eventually would exercise a dominant influence in
 Southeast Asia.   He abruptly terminated all United States
 economic and military aid programs in November 1963
 (since 1955 the U.S. had been the key source of such aid,
 having extended some $309.6 million in economic aid and

 some $83.7 million in military assistance).   Sihanouk then
 began relying more heavily on France, Communist China and
 the Soviet Union for assistance, primarily military.   They
 assumed the former U.S. role and increased both their ec-
 onomic and military assistance, to the distress of the many
 who preferred the United States and who found that the com-
 bined assistance from France, China and the Soviet Union
 scarcely approached what the U.S. had given.  At the same
 time Sihanouk instituted a number of economic "reforms"
 involving the nationalization of banking and other drastic
 measures to help compensate for the loss of U.S. economic
 assistance -- reforms that had disastrous economic consequen-
 ces.   They alienated the elite and made Sihanouk personally
 responsible for the economic troubles to come.

 Sihanouk became increasingly a spokesman for the Chi-
 nese Communists, possibly in the hope that the Chinese
 would be able to control the North Vietnamese and keep
 them from eventually overrunning Cambodia.   He supported
 the Communist line on most major international issues and
 strongly criticized American policy, particularly in South-
 east Asia.   Relations with the United States finally were
 broken in May 1965 and were not resumed until July 1969.
 Sihanouk may have decided to resume relations because of
 his concern over the large Vietnamese Communist troop
 concentrations in Cambodia and because he needed some-
 thing to help balance off China and the Vietnamese Com-
 munists.
 Sihanouk continued to maintain very close ties with
 France and there were correct, if not cordial, relations
 with a number of other non-Communist countries.  Many of
 the elite objected to the pro-Communist slant of Sihan-
 ouk's brand of neutrality, but also recognized that it
 had kept them out of war, allowing them a period of sta-
 bility in a turbulent region.

 Until his ouster in March 1970, Sihanouk was consid-
 ered the personification of Cambodia..  He had successfully
 guided the country to independence with a minimum of blood-
 shed and turmoil, and had managed through guile and hard
 work to keep the country intact and at peace through a
 prolonged period of regional instability and war.   He a-
 droitly managed to keep the contending royal and personal
 factions in line, and dominated the entire political scene.
 All questions of significance were decided by him, either
 in his role as Chief of State or as head of the Sangkum.
 Although there was peace, a number of problems beset
 the nation.   The economy was deteriorating.   Insurgent
 activity, which began in early 1967 in western Cambodia,
 was slowly spreading.   The Vietnamese Communists were in-
 creasing their various uses of Cambodian territory.   The
 Cambodians suffered many casualties, caused by retaliatory
 South Vietnamese and U.S. bombing and shelling.

 April 1970.
 In August 1969 Sihanouk asked General Lon Nol, the
 Minister of National Defense, to form a new government,
 primarily to tackle economic problems.   Lon Nol chose
 Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, who had long opposed Sihan-
 ouk's policies, to be his deputy.                         Sihanouk soon became
 irritated by Matak's determined and successful attempts
 to curtail some of his powers.   In early January, after
 losing an apparent political ploy to bring down the Cab-
 inet which had allied with the National Assembly against
 him, Sihanouk left for medical treatment in France.
 Until the present government was formed last August,
 there was no leader to rally anti-Sihanouk sentiment.
 Previously, by counterbalancing the conservatives and
 the leftists, Sihanouk had been able to keep his opponents
 divided.   The leftist forces, in effect, had been purged
 by Sihanouk since 1967 and no longer provided him the
 maneuvering room which he had enjoyed in previous political
 clashes.   Many factors contributed to Sihanouk's ouster.

 Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, and other members of the elite,
 apparently decided that Sihanouk had been too accommodat-
 ing toward the Vietnamese Communists, and grew alarmed over
 the increasing Communist use of Cambodia as a sanctuary,
 staging area and supply route.  Another common criticism
 was the widespread corruption that existed in Sihanouk's
 entourage.   Finally, Sihanouk had dominated Cambodia for
 17 years, and many were fed up with him and his autocrat-
 ic and flamboyant ways.
 The anti-Sihanouk forces now found strong leaders in
 Sirik Matak and Lon Nol.   They evidently believed that
 Sihanouk would try to unseat them when he returned, and
 decided to move against him.   The two leaders used the
 mounting anti-Vietnamese sentiment in Cambodia as the
 means to bring him down.   They instigated demonstrations
 against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong embassies, in
 violation of Sihanouk's policy of not pushing the Com-
 munists too far.   The demonstrations got out of hand and
 the embassies were sacked.   In his vehement denunciation
 of the government and the demonstrations, Sihanouk suc-
 ceeded only in consolidating the rapidly increasing op-
 position to him and his policies.
 On March 18, 1970 both houses of the Cambodian leg-
 islature met at the government's request and voted to
 withdraw confidence in Sihanouk as Chief of State.  Na-
 tional Assembly President, Cheng Heng, was appointed the
 acting Chief of State, pending elections.
 Sihanouk was about to leave Moscow for Peking when
 he learned that he had been ousted.   (Sihanouk had been
 attempting to persuade the Soviets to persuade the North
 Vietnamese to reduce their strength in Cambodia, but
 failed in Moscow and seemed unlikely to succeed on the
 same task in Peking.)   Enraged and humiliated, he flew
 on to Peking, where he decided to attempt a return to
 power with Communist support -- readily offered by the
 Chinese and North Vietnamese.
 In speeches on March 23 and May 5, Sihanouk announced
 that he had "dissolved" the Lon Nol government, the
 Council of the Kingdom, and the National Assembly.   He
 also announced the formation and establishment of a Royal
 Government of National Union (RGNU) headed by Penn Nouth,
 one of his most loyal advisors.   His government-in-exile
 is nominally under the direction of his new political
 organization, the National United Front of Cambodia
 (FUNK), of which he is chairman.   The formation of a

 national liberation army was also announced, and he asked
 the people to take to the jungle to carry out the struggle
 against the Lon Nol government and the "U.S. imperialists."
 He promised arms and ammunition to his supporters.
 In Phnom Penh, meanwhile, Lon Nol and Sirik Matak an-
 nounced that Cambodia would follow the same neutralist
 policies.   The Vietnamese Communists, however, began in-
 creasing military pressure on the new regime, forcing it
 to call upon non-Communist countries, including the U.S.,
 for military assistance.   Relations with Thailand and
 South Vietnam were quickly established, and on April 30th
 South Vietnam and the United States launched a 60-day of-
 fensive into the Communist strongholds in Cambodia.

 CHAPTER I -- THE LAND
 (January 1970
 Cambodia is a compact country of about 67,000 square
 miles, slightly smaller in area than the State of Wash-
 ington.                     It extends about 360 miles from west to east
 (102?20'E to 107?40'E) and about 280 miles from north to
 south (14?35'N to 10?25'N).   The straight-line distance
 from the capital, Phnom Penh, to the nearest point on
 the South Vietnam border is only about 40 miles.   Cam-
 bodia's boundaries extend approximately 1,600 miles --
 with Thailand on the west and northwest, Laos on the
 northeast, and South Vietnam on the east, southeast, and
 south.   To the southwest, an irregular coastline of some
 400 miles provides access to the Gulf of Thailand.
 Each of Cambodia's several terrain regions has  hys-
 ical features
 .   The Tonle Sap-Mekong Delta
 e1 n 1),    e political and economic heart of
 the nation, is low-lying and intensively cultivated
 plain which surrounds the Tonle Sap (Great Lake)* and
 extends along the Mekong Delta to the South Vietnam
 border.   Ninety percent of Cambodia's people live in
 this region.   The Transitional Plains (Region 2), adjoin
 Region 1, extending westward and northward to t e Thai
 frontier and eastward across the Mekong.  This thinly
 forested, sparsely populated, and better drained region
 contains scattered hills.   The Transitional Plains merge
 in the east with the generally heavily forested and
 sparsely peopled Eastern Highlands (Region 3) along the
 South Vietnam and Laos borders.  Vietnamese Communist
 forces, operating in the neighboring highlands of South
 Vietnam, use this upland region for sanctuary and their
 *   In this study the term Tonle Sap refers only to the
 lake of that name; the stream through which Tonle Sap
 waters are discharged into the Mekong River is desig-
 nated the Tonle Sap River.

 supply routes crisscross parts of the region.  The South-
 western Highlands  (Region 4), a rugged, densely forested,
 and largely uninhabited mountainous tract, occupy much of
 the land between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand.
 The region is largely unknown and contains the most
 extensive stand of virgin rain forest in Indochina.   The
 Coastal Lowland (Region 5), a heavily wooded and moder-
 ately populated coastal strip of varying width, is isolated
 from the rest of the country by the mountains of the South-
 western Highlands.
 B.   Drainage
 Rivers on the seaward slopes of the mountains in the
 Southwestern Highlands drain into the Gulf of Thailand;
 elsewhere, streams empty into either the Tonle Sap drain-
 age system or the Mekong River.   From October to June the
 Tonle Sap waters empty into the Mekong; this flow is
 reversed during the rainy season (mid-May--early October).
 The floodwaters of the Mekong surge northwestward into
 the Tonle Sap, extending its area from a dry-season
 minimum of some 1,200 square miles to a rainy-season
 maximum of more than 3,000 square miles.  Maximum depths
 in the lake increase from about 7 feet to more than 35
 feet.   During the rainy season, streams that may be only
 trickles in the dry months become torrential and laden
 with silt.   The small ponds of the Tonle Sap-Mekong
 Delta Lowland that are not swallowed by the expanding
 waters of the Tonle Sap may coalesce to form large lakes.
 C.   Climate
 Cambodia's climate is characterized by a monsoonal
 circulation with marked seasonal changes in prevailing
 wind direction.   From mid-May into early October, gen-
 erally strong winds flow out of the southwest.   Cloud-
 iness is variable, precipitation is slight, and humid-
 ity is low.   Between the monsoon seasons the weather is
 transitional; winds are variable in both intensity and
 direction.
 Temperatures are high throughout the year. Mean
 daily temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit (at six weather
 stations) range from maximums of from 96 to 74, and

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 minimums of from 77 to 59.   During the spring transi-
 tional season, however -- just before the onset of the
 southwest monsoon rains -- temperatures are generally
 a few degrees higher than during other seasons.  At this
 time they reach the middle 90's in the lowlands, but
 rarely exceed 100 degrees.   Lowest temperatures occur
 during the period of least precipitation (November to
 March).   In the lowlands they may rise only into the
 middle or upper 80's; upland temperatures are some-
 what lower.   Daily minimum temperatures in both low-
 lands and uplands are generally 15 to 20 degrees lower
 than maximums.
 Rainfall varies considerably throughout the country
 -- from upwards of 200 inches annually on some parts of
 the coast (Bokor -- 182 inches annually) and seaward
 slopes of the Southwestern Highlands, which receive the
 brunt of the rain-laden winds of the southwest monsoon,
 to as little as 50 inches in the rain shadow* on the
 lowlands north and east of the Southwestern Highlands
 (Table 2).  A climatic station on the coast near Kam-
 pot, for example, has recorded more than 80 inches of
 rain in a single month, while Phnom Penh, in the rain
 shadow, receives a mean yearly rainfall of only 54.8
 inches.   Stations farther north in the plains, away
 from the rain shadow, receive somewhat greater yearly
 rainfall, generally between 70 and 80 inches.   The
 southwestern slopes of the Eastern Highlands receive
 well over 100 inches of rain annually, while slopes
 facing the northeast receive considerably less.
 Although it may rain at any time, between 70 and
 80 percent of the total annual rainfall coincides
 with the southwest monsoon; during January and Feb-
 ruary -- the driest months of the year -- precipitation
 may be reduced to only a trace.   The torrential down-
 pours of the southwest monsoon are preceded by the "mango
 rains"** -- the scattered and generally light showers
 *  A rain shadow is an area that receives relatively
 light rainfall because a terrain feature shelters it
 from prevailing rainbearing winds.
 **  So called because they create almost overnight
 growth of plants, including mangos, in the forests.

 that break the dry spell in late March or early April.
 Thunderstorm activity -- including violent rains, gusty
 winds, lightning, and hail -- peaks early during the
 southwest monsoon, and then tapers off with less fre-
 quent and less intense storms continuing into October.
 Such storms most commonly occur in late afternoon or
 early evening, seldom in the morning.

 D.   Vegetation
 About 80 percent of Cambodia is forested.  Vege-
 tation includes stunted deciduous trees scattered in
 the savannas of the plains, jungles of secondary broad-
 leaf evergreen growths interspersed with patches cleared
 for slash-and-burn farming in the eastern and south-
 western mountains, towering virgin rain forests on the
 more remote seaward slopes of the southwestern mountains,
 ribbons of impenetrable mangrove forests along more
 sheltered coastal stretches, and rubber trees on the
 large plantations in the eastern uplands and on the
 southeastern parts of the plains.  Most of the non-
 forested area is cultivated -- principally by pro-
 ducers of wetland rice in the Mekong Delta and around
 the shores of the Tonle Sap.
 B.   Regions
 1.   Tonle Sap-Mekong Delta Lowland
 The heavily populated Tonle Sap-Mekong Delta
 Lowland is characterized by low elevations -- con-
 siderably less than 50 feet above sea level -- and
 poor drainage.   Up to one-third of the region is in-
 undated to various depths during the rainy season, and
 a smaller area is under water at all times.  Only on
 its fringes does an occasional low hill break the mon-
 otony of the horizon.
 Immediately adjacent to the Tonle Sap is a wide
 belt of water-resistant forest; interspersed with mud-
 flats and patches of marsh grass, this belt is inun-
 dated during the rainy season.   Elsewhere on the plain
 around the Tonle Sap and throughout the Mekong Delta,
 rice paddies -- mixed with tracts of tall grass and
 reeds, thinly wooded stands, and fields of dry crops
 -- dominate the landscape.   Individual ricefields,
 which range up to 5 acres in size, are separated from
 each other by earthen dikes that are up to 2 feet high
 and 2 feet wide.   Rice is planted soon after the ar-
 rival of the monsoon rains and is harvested in Novem-
 ber or December, when it has attained a height of about
 4 feet.   Water depths in the ricefields may exceed 1
 foot during the growing season; they diminish toward

 the end of the rainy season, and the fields are dry by
 the time the crop is harvested.  After the harvest, most
 fields are left fallow with stubble, and soils become
 desiccated.  A few of the fields in the delta, however,
 are planted to dry crops -- mostly maize -- after the
 rice crop has been gathered, and they are then harvested
 prior to the beginning of the next rainy season.

 2.   Transitional Plains
 This thinly settled region is characterized by
 terrain and vegetation that are transitional between
 the low-lying, poorly drained, and intensively cul-
 tivated Tonle Sap-Mekong Delta Lowland and the often
 rugged and densely forested mountains of the east and
 southwest.   The terrain is flat to undulating, with
 prevailing elevations several hundred feet above sea
 level.   It is interrupted in places, however, by densely
 forested hills (called phnoms)   that may rise steeply
 to 1,000 feet above the adjacent plain.   Such hills
 vary in shape and size.   Some are sharp pinnacles no
 more than a mile in diameter; others are flat-topped
 mesas that extend for several miles.   Some of the
 limestone hills between Battambang (Region 1) and
 the Thai border are honeycombed with                             25X1

 Savanna, with grass up to 5 feet high, forms the pre-
 vailing vegetation.  Deciduous trees and shrubs are scat-
 tered.                     In places, the trees are closely spaced and have
 continuous canopies; elsewhere, they may be hundreds of
 feet apart.   They shed their leaves for varying periods
 from mid-November to mid-March; during the last weeks of
 this period the landscape is parched -- trees are leaf-
 less, grass is brown, and hundreds of fires burn across
 the savanna.   The fires are ignited by farmers to per-
 mit the growth of new, more palatable grasses for their
 cattle.   In addition, the fires roast such edible animal
 life as rodents, tortoises, and lizards and provide a
 source of food.   The smoke enshrouds the region until
 the "mango rains" arrive in late March or early April
 to clear the air and revitalize the dormant vegetation.
 Broadleaf evergreen forests prevail on the scattered
 hills of the region and along stream valleys, where
 they form jungled ribbons that meander across the
 savanna.   The savanna also is broken by densely forested
 spurs of the peripheral uplands that jut fingerlike in-
 to it.  A few cultivated tracts, planted mostly to rice,
 are concentrated near the rivers.
 More than 200 miles of the northern boundary of
 this region is formed by the Chaine des Dangrek, which
 also forms part of the Thailand-Cambodia border.  A
 southward-facing, heavily dissected cliff covered with
 dense evergreen forest rises steeply some 600 to 1,800
 feet above the adjacent Cambodian plains.  The range
 slopes more gradually northward to the Khorat Plateau
 of northeast Thailand.  Only one (dry-season) road
 crosses it, but the cart tracks that traverse the
 water gaps may be jeepable in the dry season.
 Unlike the Tonle Sap-Mekong Delta Lowland, little
 flooding occurs in this region to deter cross-country
 movement by wheeled vehicles.   Soggy ground, however,
 which prevails locally during part of the rainy season,
 may limit such movement to vehicles with 4-wheel drive.
 The restrictions imposed by the vegetation on the cross-
 country vehicular travel vary seasonally.   Grass and
 shrubs, which form no more than a thin stubble cover by
 the end of the dry season and readily permit such travel,
 may reach heights of several feet by the end of the
 rainy season and discourage movement by all wheeled vehi-
 cles.   Numerous densely jungled stream valleys would
 further hinder vehicular travel at all seasons.   Foot,
 travel would be little affected at any time by weather
 or vegetation.

 3.    Eastern Highlands
 The lightly populated Eastern Highlands, part of
 a vast dissected plateau region that extends into neigh-
 boring Laos and South Vietnam, consist of three blocks
 of mountainous or hilly terrain separated one from
 another by broad rolling river valleys of the west-
 ward-flowing Se San and Srepok.   The headwaters of both
 rivers rise in the adjoining uplands of South Vietnam,
 and their courses have served as supply routes, via
 Cambodia, of Communist forces across the border.   In
 the north -- between the Laotian border and the Se San --
 terrain is higher and more rugged than in the rest of
 the region with steep slopes rising from narrow valleys
 to peaks up to nearly 5,000 feet in elevation.   Else-

 4.   Southwestern Highlands
 The remote and little-known Southwestern High-
 lands comprise two distinct upland blocks.   In the north
 the rugged and largely uninhabited Chaine des Cardamomes
 trends southeast-northwest for nearly 150 miles.   Several
 peaks top 5,000 feet; Phnom Aural (5,810 feet) at the
 eastern end of the chain is the highest point in Cam-
 bodia.   No major passes cross the chain.   In the south-
 east the lower, less,rugged, but equally sparsely
 peopled Chaine de 1'Elephant is alined generally north-
 south for some 75 miles.   This chain is halved by a
 broad pass at an elevation well under 1,000 feet.  The
 pass is traversed by the US-financed Khmer-American
 Friendship Highway, which links the port of Sihanouk-
 ville with Phnom Penh.  No major road taps any other
 part of the Southwestern Highlands.

 Much of the Cardamomes, particularly the rain-
 drenched seaward slopes, is blanketed with virgin
 rain forest.   Heavily buttressed trees up to 3 1/2 feet

 floor, and undergrowth is sparse.   Elsewhere in the
 Cardamomes and throughout most of the Chaine de 1'

 similar to those of the Eastern Highlands prevail.
 Open forests of pine and other conifers occupy some
 of the higher slopes, deciduous forests fringe in-
 terior margins of the region, fields of wetland rice
 are sprinkled along the lower sectors of some of the
 broader valleys, and slash-and-burn fields are scat-
 tered throughout the secondary forest.

 Cambodia's coastline varies; only between Kampot
 and the South Vietnam border does the Coastal Lowland
 merge with the interior plains.   Transportation into
 the      is relatively well developed in this sec-
 25X1                             Around the Baie de Kompong Som the
 low an s extend inland for 25 miles or more.   Elsewhere,
 mountains may extend almost to the sea.  At the south-
 ern end of the Chafne de 11El6phant, for example, the
 lowland is only a mile or so wide.   West of the Baie
 de Kompong Som, it is narrow and interrupted by nu-
 merous hilly spurs of the Chafne des Cardamomes.
 Settlement is more dense than in the Southwestern
 Highlands.  Villages extend along the more hospitable
 segments of the shore, frequently where rivers flow
 into the sea.   Between the Baie de Kompong Som and
 the Thai border, the region is remote and untapped by
 roads, and communication with the rest of the country
 is blocked by the neighboring mountains.   Several large
 and numerous small islands lie a few miles offshore.
 Most are hilly, densely forested, and sparsely in-
 habited.   The larger islands have well-sheltered coves
 25X1         with sandy beaches                                                  25X1
 The vegetation of the Coastal Lowland is a con-
 tinuation of that of the adjacent slopes of the South-
 western Highlands -- a mixture of virgin and secondary
 broadleaf evergreen forests interspersed with small
 cultivated patches.  Only in the east, where the
 Coastal Lowland merges with the interior plains, do
 cultivated fields prevail.   Some coastal vegetation
 is distinctive.   Where the shores are well protected
 from the winds -- at the heads of bays and along
 tidal estuaries -- nearly impenetrable evergreen man-
 grove forests occupy coastal strips that are up to
 several hundred yards wide.   These growths, charac-
 terized by a dense network of trunks and aerial roots,
 are inundated up to several feet at high tide.  Com-
 monly associated with the mangrove forests along their
 inland margins are equally dense growths of nipa palms
 -- trees with horizontal trunks buried in the mud,
 from which closely spaced fronds grow vertically to
 heights of 20 feet.   The nipas have usually been thin-
 ned out near populated areas, as the fronds are used

 for roofing material.        Along less sheltered coastal
 stretches, particularly between the Baie de Kompong Som
 and the South Vietnam border, the broadleaf evergreen
 forests prevalent in the interior extend to the sea or
 may back narrow sandy beaches sprinkled with coconut
 palms and pinelike casuarina trees.

 Because roads are lacking and waterways are numerous,
 small shallow-draft boats provide the best means of trans-
 port into the forested lowlands,  The rivers are navi-
 gable only to the mountains, however, and would not pro-
 vide through routes into the interior.   The dense forests
 and soggy soils throughout the Coastal Lowland would
 preclude vehicular and foot cross-country movement.
 Travel between villages is mostly along the coasts by
 small native boats.

 2.    Edible Plantlife
 Although an abundance of edible plantlife,
 cultivated and wild, is present in most parts of Cambodia,
 individuals unfamiliar with tropical plants may have dif-
 ficulty in distinguishing poisonous and nonpoisonous spe-
 cies.                         Among the more plentiful and edible fruits are the
 breadfruit, jackfruit, durian, mango, mangosteen, papaya,
 rambutan, and banana.  Most of these fruits ripen during
 the rainy season:

 Tender, young bamboo shoots are an excellent source
 of food, and may be combined with other foods in salads,
 stews, or soups.   The tough outer shields encasing the
 shoots must be removed before cooking.   The stalk of
 the mature bamboo can be used to fashion cooking and
 eating utensils.   The shoots of the climbing rattan
 palm are edible, as are those of various other trees
 and shrubs.   The young unopened buds of wild sugar-
 cane are edible if cooked, and the stems, roots, and
 young shoots can be peeled and consumed raw.   Seeds
 of coniferous trees -- most common at higher ele-
 vations -- are tasty, nutritious, and easy to extract
 if the cones are heated.

 Along the sandy beaches and on some of the interior
 plains, palms are a good source of food.   In addition
 to the fruit they produce (coconuts and dates), the soft
 interiors of the trunks of many palms can be eaten when
 boiled or roasted.   Picking the fruit of the coconut
 palm may pose a problem, however, because of the height
 of the tree, and the removal of the husk and the opening
 of the shell may be difficult for one who does not have
 a heavy knife.   The seeds (dates) of the nipa palm --
 found along coastal inlets adjacent to the mangrove
 forests -- are edible.   Young seeds, which ripen in
 the rainy season, should be boiled for a few minutes;
 mature seeds are usually too hard to eat.
 The inner bark and terminal buds of many other
 trees also are edible, and the inner bark of conif-
 erous trees is a particularly good source of sus-
 tenance.                      A wide variety of edible ferns abounds in
 moist shady places and, although low in food value,
 when eaten with other foods would help to sustain life.

 The pandanus tree (screw pine), which grows in sandy
 coastal areas and in moist interior locations, produces
 pineapplelike clusters of fruit.   This fruit, including
 the seeds, may be eaten raw when it is yellow and
 breaking apart; when unripe it should be wrapped in
 leaves and roasted.

 A number of plants in moist, forested areas have
 edible -- and often tasty -- tuberous roots.   They
 include arrowroot, cassava, taro, and yams.   None
 should be eaten raw because they may contain toxic
 ingredients that are removed only by cooking.   Cas-
 sava, for example, contains poisonous hydrocyanic
 acid.   The tubers should be cut into thin slices,
 crushed, and cooked in several changes of water.
 Various types of fungi such as mushrooms, puffballs,
 and wood fungi also grow in damp wooded areas -- on
 the ground, on decaying trees, or on termite mounds.
 Many are edible, but all should be avoided since some
 are poisonous and all are low in food value.

 When traveling through forested areas, one should
 look for edible plants in clearings, such as along
 streams or in burned or cutover places.   In the moun-
 tains, where shifting agriculture is practiced, many
 food plants continue to grow wild after the cultivated
 plots are abandoned.   Few plant foods are found in
 areas of dense underbrush, and they are not likely to
 be abundant in the drier open forests or grasslands.
 There is no foolproof method to determine whether
 or not a plant will be harmful when eaten, but certain
 rules may be applied.   In general, it is safe to try
 plants that are eaten by birds and mammals, partic-
 ularly by members of the ape family.  Anything with an
 unusually bitter, soapy, or otherwise disagreeable
 taste may be harmful, and plants with milky juices
 should be avoided entirely.   Plants that are bristly
 or scratch the tongue should not be eaten; they will
 probably do the same to the digestive tract.  A
 strange plant should never be eaten in large quantity

 until a small portion has been tested; small amounts
 of poisonous food are not likely to prove dangerous.
 In addition to wild plants, cultivated varieties
 may provide sources of food.       Rice is planted in May
 or June and harvested late in the year.   The ripened
 grain can be eaten raw but, if possible, should be
 cooked into a broth.  A variety of fruits and veg-
 etables are usually grown in and around villages.
 3.   Fauna
 a)   Food
 Although many areas of Cambodia are teeming
 with a variety of wildlife, the abundance of game is
 not readily apparent to the casual traveler.   While
 large animals such as elephants, tigers, or wild buf-
 falo are especially furtive, they should be avoided
 anyway because of their potential danger.   Small game
 such as squirrels, rabbits, badgers, civets, monkeys,
 or wild fowl are more likely to be encountered.   For
 those who are not equipped with firearms, however,
 obtaining game -- large or small -- will be a problem.
 Unless an individual is well versed in the preparation
 and use of traps and snares, any time spent in their
 construction is likely to prove futile.   Subsisting
 off more easily obtained plant life and lower forms
 of animal life is recommended.
 Fish and other marine life are more readily
 obtained than game and are an especially nutritious
 food source.   The Tonle Sap and other smaller lakes,
 streams, roadside ditches, and even rice paddies
 abound with a wide variety of fish, crustaceans, mol-
 lusks, snails, turtles, and frogs.   Fish can be caught
 with the equipment included in standard survival kits
 or by improving tackle from odds and ends of such
 personal equipment as wire or pins or from such plant
 life as bamboo or saplings.   When shallow streams are
 dammed with rocks or mud, the fish can be easily
 caught in makeshift scoops or nets.   Fish are easiest
 to catch at the end of the rainy season when they are
 trapped in pools left behind by receding waters.  As
 the waters of the wet-season Tonle Sap recede, hundreds

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 of fishermen erect bamboo weirs to trap the fish as they
 swim back to the sanctuary of the dry-season lake.
 A variety of saltwater fish, most of them edible,
 abounds in Cambodia's coastal waters.   Several species
 have poisonous flesh, however, and should not be eaten.
 Such fish usually can be identified by their heavy
 parrotlike beaks, thick lips, absence of scales, or
 separated dorsal spines unconnected by membrane; most
 inhabit shallow waters around islands or reefs.  Oysters
 found growing in clumps, colonies, or mounds and exposed
 at low tide should be considered poisonous.
 All land snakes are edible.   Even poisonous species
 can be eaten if the venom sacs are removed by cutting
 off the head.   Care must be taken not to get the venom
 into any skin lesion.   The meat of all sea snakes should
 be avoided.   Various species of edible lizards -- some
 of them ranging up to several feet long -- are found
 in all regions of the country.   They are most likely to
 be seen along tracks, roads, or riverbanks, but some
 types live in burrows or termite mounds and others are
 tree climbers.
 Birds are abundant, the seasonally inundated forest
 of the Tonle Sap being a particularly popular nesting
 place.  All species -- and their eggs -- are edible.
 The best places to hunt for birds or mammals are in
 forest clearings and along trails, roads, streams, and
 lakeshores, where they come to in search of food and water.
 They are least likely to be encountered in densely forested
 tracts.   The possibilities of sighting game vary seasonally,
 especially in the grasslands and open forests, where
 the tall grass may obscure animals during the rainy season.
 During the dry season, in contrast, much of the grass
 cover is burned off, and the desiccation of many of the
 watering places forces animals to congregate near those
 that remain.   Leaf fall in the deciduous forests also
 enhances sighting possibilities in the dry season.   If
 personnel are armed, they should lie in wait for animals
 at watering places during the early morning or at dusk.
 Because many animals and fish carry dangerous in-
 testinal parasites, all meat should be cleaned and cooked
 thoroughly before eating.   Because meat spoils rapidly
 under tropical conditions, it should be eaten within 24
 hours after cooking.   If thin slices of meat are smoked
 or sun dried, they will keep indefinitely.

 Insects are an easily accessible source of emergency
 food for the psychologically prepared traveler.   Grass-
 hoppers, termites, and the larvae of many insects
 (usually found in rotten logs or bamboo, in the ground,
 or under the bark of dead trees) are edible and nourishing.
 Such food can be eaten raw without ill effects, but if
 cooked may be more appealing to the squeamish.
 Hazards
 A number of large animals, including the elephant,
 rhinoceros, wild boar, wild dog, wild buffalo, tiger,
 leopard, panther, and bear, are potential hazards to man.
 None are likely to be encountered, however, unless a
 traveler traverses game trails or lingers near watering
 places.   Even if encountered, none are likely to attack
 a human unless cornered, injured, or surprised -- as,
 for example, when a mother is with her young.   To evade
 such hazards one need only avoid camping near trails,
 watering sites, or obvious feeding and bedding areas
 and keep a small fire going at night -- when such
 animals are most active.
 Four varieties of snakes in Cambodia are potentially
 deadly:   the cobra;  its larger and more menacing relative,
 the king cobra; the banded krait; and the Russell's viper.
 Several species of kraits, vipers, and sea snakes also
 are present, but in general their bites are painful at
 worst and dangerous only to those who are allergic to
 the particular venom.   Even deadly snakes are not a
 serious menace because, being timid, they will disappear
 at the slightest disturbance.  An attack is unlikely
 unless the snake is stumbled over accidentally but
 precautions should be taken.
 One should be particularly careful when moving
 around slash, fallen trees or limbs, brush piles, or
 other deadfall.   Snakes also may seclude themselves
 in ratholes (common in dikes separating rice paddies)
 or in earthen mounds such as anthills or termite mounds.
 When traversing rocky terrain, the traveler should
 look, if possible, before placing his hands on rocks
 or ledges above his head or before stepping down into
 shadowed rock crevices.   Since snakes generally are
 most active at night, one should be doubly cautious
 after sundown when moving about places favored by
 snakes.  When camping, clothes and equipment should

 be hung on tree limbs rather than being placed on the
 ground.   Similarly, it is good practice to sleep in a ham-
 mock or on an improvised sleeping platform.   Because the
 venom may act on the body in a matter of minutes, all
 snakebites must be treated as quickly as possible (one
 should always assume that the offender is poisonous).
 Pain is not an accurate indicator of the seriousness of
 a bite.   The bite of the cobra, for example, is not
 initially painful.

 Crocodiles may be encountered in coastal swamps and
 in the deltaic distributaries of the Mekong.  They have
 surprising speed and agility when stalking their prey in
 water and should be avoided.
 A variety of stinging jellyfish -- including the
 highly poisonous Portuguese man-of-war     may be found
 floating in the waters of the Gulf of Thailand.  All
 such "fish" have stinging units in their tentacles but,
 except for the man-of-war, their stings are not poi-
 sonous.   Sea urchins are common in shallow, coral-laden
 waters. Their sharp venomous spines can inflict pain-
 ful wounds on a shoeless wader. unlucky enough to step
 on one. Venomous sea life such as the scorpion fish,
 stonefish, toadfish, zebra fish, and stingray also
 frequent coral reefs and shallow inshore waters.   They
 lie motionless on the bottom among rocks or chunks of
 coral or burrow into the bottom.   Difficult to see,
 they may easily he stepped on by one not exercising
 extreme caution.  All are equipped with venomous spines
 which can inflict painful wounds.  Other potentially
 dangerous or troublesome aquatic animals include the
 barracuda, electric ray, shark, moray eel, and conger
 eel.
 Small pests are probably the greatest threat to
 the well-being of a traveler.  Various biting and
 stinging insects, leeches, ticks, ants, and spiders
 abound in Cambodia and are particularly bothersome
 during the rainy season.   Some are serious hazards.
 Several of the innumerable mosquito species in the
 country, for instance, transmit malaria, dengue fever,
 filariasis, and other infections.  Although the in-
 cidence of malaria has been reduced since the inception
 of control and eradication programs in 1962, personnel
 should take precautions against the bites of malaria-
 carrying insects.  Malaria-bearing mosquitoes are
 most prevalent in poorly drained, sunny, lowland regions,
 but breed in mountain streams and much of the South-
 western Highlands is malaria-infested.  A traveler in
 mosquito-infested areas, in addition to taking malaria-
 suppressant drugs, should use insect repellent and
 wear suitable clothing and netting to keep exposed
 skin to a minimum, particularly after sundown.   The
 transmission period of malaria reaches a peak during
 the rainy season when breeding places are most abun-
 dant.

 Flies, which abound in the rainy season, vary greatly
 in size and in the discomfort they can cause.   Some are
 vicious biters.   Since various species may produce
 secondary infections by depositing their larvae in skin
 lesions such as abrasions, bites, or rashes, all skin
 lesions should be kept clean and covered with clean
 material.   Near villages, flies may be mechanical vectors
 (carriers) of intestinal, skin, or eye diseases.   Pro-
 tective measures used against mosquitoes are generally
 effective against flies.
 Rats and other rodents are likely to be infested
 with fleas and lice, which in turn may carry several
 diseases, including typhus and plague.   The use of
 louse powder, exposure of clothing to direct sunlight
 for a few hours, and frequent washing of the body
 in hot soapy water are good precautions against such
 pests.   Sandfleas, which may be encountered near bodies
 of water, can cause great discomfort.
 Bloodsucking land leeches may infest the grass-
 lands and the ferny undergrowth in the forests during
 the rainy season.   They cling to the vegetation and
 eagerly attach themselves to passersby.   It is dif-
 ficult to keep them from the body because of their
 ability to pass through small openings - - even through
 coarse stockings or the eyelets of laced shoes.   Their

 bites generally are painless but may cause discomfort and
 loss of blood.   Leeches often are discovered only by a
 thorough examination of the body; in leech-infested coun-
 try, such examinations should be frequent.   Leeches should
 be removed carefully to avoid secondary infection by
 applying a burning cigarette or some dehydrating sub-
 stance such as salt, alcohol, iodine, tobacco juice, or
 dry ashes.   If the leech is pulled off by force the
 wound may become infected.  Another variety of leech
 which infests streams and other water bodies can be a
 menace to one seeking a refreshing dip.
 Ticks, common in wooded and grassy areas, are car-
 riers of scrub typhus and may cause secondary infections
 if improperly removed from the skin.   Having jaws, they
 are more difficult to remove than leeches but, like
 leeches, sometimes can be dislodged by being touched
 with lighted cigarettes; they also may be removed by
 being painted with iodine or covered with vaseline or
 a similar viscous substance.   If other methods fail,
 a sterile instrument should be used to extract them,
 the area of broken skin being treated with antibiotic
 ointment to prevent secondary infection.
 Ants, a particular nuisance, may be seen swarming
 over the forest floor or on forest vegetation.   One
 should be especially careful not to brush against ant-
 infested bamboo lest dozens of infuriated stinging
 insects swarm down his back.  A nocturnal visit from
 hundreds of ants is not unlikely for one camping in
 the forest; a liberal spraying of DDT inside the tent
 or around the sleeping area is an effective deterrent
 to such invasions.
 Scorpions, although less numerous than other pests,
 may be encountered.   Normally found under stones, in
 tree trunks, or in soil crevices, they may come into
 camping sites and seek out sleeping bags or such items
 of clothing as shoes.   To guard against their stings,
 sleeping platforms should be improvised and clothing
 should not be left on the ground.   The scorpion's
 sting is extremely painful and can incapacitate a man
 for several days.   Bites or stings from other pests
 may be painful, but their effect normally does not
 last as long unless the individual is allergic.

 4.   Water
 25X1       1
 I                During the latter part of the dry season,
 however, local shortages may occur, particularly on
 the plains north of the Tonle Sap.   Even if stream
 valleys appear dry, they may yield drinking water if
 one digs into spots where the drainage from surrounding
 slopes tends to concentrate.
 Water may be located by studying vegetation patterns
 or the movements of birds and animals.   For example, a
 line of trees in grasslands may mark a water source.
 Most birds fly to water at least once a day and game
 trails eventually lead to water.  At the beginning of
 their evening flights, bats always fly to a place where
 water is available.
 Most water sources are polluted and carry diseases
 such as dysentery, cholera, or typhoid; blood flukes
 and various types of worms also may be transmitted
 through drinking water.   The most dangerous sources are
 slow-moving bodies of water downriver from villages,
 whereas the safest drinking water is in clear, fast-
 moving mountain streams.  All water, however -- even
 from such streams or from municipal-treated sources --
 should be considered contaminated and should be purified
 by using chemicals such as halazone or iodine, or by
 boiling for 1 minute plus 1 additional minute for each
 1,000 feet of elevation.
 Rainwater can be collected by devising a makeshift
 container from available clothing or equipment; a
 poncho serves as an ideal catchment.   The leaves, stems,
 and roots of many succulent plants and the stems of
 many vines, climbing rattans, and bamboo contain
 water that can be drunk safely without treatment.  Vines
 and rattans should be cut into 2- or 3-foot lengths and
 allowed to drip.  Water can be drained from large
 bamboo shafts by cutting into each segment just above
 the joint.   Nipa palms and young banana trees may yield
 water if their trunks are gashed.   Tips of the aerial
 roots of the pandanus tree also may contain water.   The
 flower stalks of all palms contain a drinkable sugary
 sap, and the green nuts of the coconut palm yield a
 fluid that can be drunk in quantity without harmful ef-
 fect.

 CAMBODIA
 CHAPTER II - THE PEOPLE
 (September 1970)
 The last Cambodian census, taken in 1962, enumerated
 5,728,930 people in the country.  As of 1 July 1970, the
 US Census Bureau estimated the population at 6,848,000.
 Cambodia, in general, is lightly populated with its over-
 all density of 100 persons per square mile far less than
 the 160 per square mile for all of Southeast Asia.   Den-
 sity varies considerably throughout the country with the
 vast majority of the people living in the Mekong delta or
 in the lowlands surrounding the Tonle Sap.   Density approa-
 ches 500 persons per square mile in the area of Kandal
 Province around Phnom Penh while elsewhere in the delta,
 densities are in the 200 to 300 range.*  Density becomes
 progressively lighter away from the Tonle Sap-Mekong
 drainage system.   The uplands in the east and southwest
 are very lightly peopled, and much of the Cardamomes
 Mountains in the southwest is virtually uninhabited.
 Cambodia's population is overwhelmingly rural, with
 most people living in small villages of from 100 to 300
 population.   The only significant exception is Phnom
 Penh whose population has swelled to more than 1,500,000
 as refugees have swarmed there to escape the unrest in
 the countryside.   There are only 12 other urban centers
 with populations of more than 10,000.   Combined, they
 comprise about three percent of Cambodia's total pop-
 ulation and include:
 In comparsion, the Red River delta of North Vietnam
 and the Indonesian island of Java -- among the most
 densely populated areas in the world -- support some
 1,500 persons per square mile.

 Cambodia's population is more ethnically homogeneous
 than those of other Southeast Asian countries.         According
 to 1962 census data, Khmers (ethnic Cambodians) comprised
 some 93 percent of the total; Vietnamese, 3.8 percent;
 Chinese, 2.8 percent.   "Others" included only 5,764 per-
 sons, or about .1 percent of the total.   Such figures,
 however, are misleading and assume more homogeneity of
 the population than actually exists.   The census does not
 enumerate, for example, either the 80,000 Muslim Cham-
 Malays or the approximately 50,000 primitive Khmer Loeu
 (Upland Khmer) tribesmen who occupy Cambodia's mountain-
 ous frontiers.  A more current and realistic estimate of
 the country's ethnic composition follows:

 11 Except for P-Shom Penh, estimates do not consider changes
 occasioned by movement of refugees from rural areas into
 the towns since April 1970.
 *_*'_Estimate considers large-scale exodus of Vietnamese to
 South Vietnam, as of late July 1970.

 In about one-half of the urban centers, Khmers are out-
 numbered by the combined Vietnamese and Chinese communities,
 but in Phnom Penh the percentage of Khmers has increased
 greatly during the past three decades.  A mid-1960's esti-
 mate of the capital's racial composition placed the Khmer-
 Vietnamese-Chinese balance at two-third's Khmer with the
 remainder split between Chinese and Vietnamese.   Elsewhere,
 the Chinese probably comprise between one-fourth and one-
 third of the populations of most major cities.   Ethnic
 groups are well segregated from one another in the urban
 centers while the smaller towns and villages are usually
 better integrated and more homogeneous.   Social ties in the
 cities are relatively weak and pagodas do not function as
 unifying forces as they do in rural areas.
 National unity in Cambodia has been enhanced by (1) com-
 mon homage to the royal family which occupies the apex of
 the social and political pyramid,  (2) common devotion to
 Theravada Buddhism, the state religion,  (3) a common language
 with only slight dialectic variations, and (4) a continuity
 of physical geography with rugged tracts found only in the
 fringes of the country.   There are, however, two fissures in
 Khmer society --  (1) the separation of Khmer from non-Khmer
 and (2) educated from non-educated.
 Lines separating the traditional social classes are being
 increasingly blurred and social mobility enhanced, particular-
 ly among the urban population.   (Those of royal descent that
 form the upper class, to be sure, remain a closed group.)
 In Phnom Penh, persons now can more readily advance their
 socio-economic status through education, occupational achieve-
 ment, or even -- to a limited degree -- through religious
 piety.  Movement up the socio-economic ladder, however, is
 impeded by an insufficient number of positions to absorb those
 with educational preparation.   As a consequence, government
 and business offfices are overstaffed with educated employees
 performing menial chores.   Other qualified individuals are
 employed in unskilled jobs such as pedicab drivers or dock
 workers.   The strata of urban middle-class businessmen, pro-
 fessionals, clerks, teachers and traders has been comprised
 of a disproportionate number of Chinese and Vietnamese.   The
 Khmers, however, continue to predominate in Government ser-
 vice where few Chinese or Vietnamese are found.   The lower
 strata of urban society -- manual laborers and small shop-
 keepers -- are comprised largely of Khmer and Vietnamese
 migrants from the countryside.  Many of these seasonal
 migrants return to their villages as the rice planting season

 approaches.
 While the more stratified social system of the urban
 centers becomes more mobile, its rural counterpart remains
 simple and egalitarian.   Despite increasing contact with the
 outside world as peasants flow to and from the cities, the
 rural pattern remains substantially intact.  All but a hand-
 ful of the people are peasant farmers; there are no wealthy
 landlords and few impoverished peasants; wealth is not im-
 portant in determining social rank.   Only the village head-
 man and lay leader of the ubiquitous village pagoda stand
 above the otherwise unstructured village society.  Although
 enhanced opportunities to advance through education are ad-
 ding a new dimension to the conventional rural structure,
 social distinctions remain unimportant.   Unlike most other
 Southeast Asian countries, extended family relationships
 do not serve as a major cohesive force in the rural village.
 The individual family, however, is the basic unit of rural
 society.   Kinship ties are not strong and the individual is
 not completely submerged to community-wide interests.
 Therefore, there is no compelling urge to remain in the vil-
 lage and many individuals, particularly the young, drift
 away to settle permanently in urban centers.
 C.   Religion
 Theravada Buddhism is the state religion of Cambodia
 and nearly all of the Khmer population profess its tenets.
 The Cambodian constitution, however, guarantees religious
 freedom and sizeable minorities practice other faiths.   The
 Vietnamese and about three percent of the Chinese profess
 the Mahayana Buddhism that prevails in their homelands.
 Most of the Chinese cling to the mixture of Confucianism,
 Taoism, and ancestor worship that is shared by most other
 Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.   Nearly all Cham-Malays
 are devout Muslims while most Khmer Loeu remain animists.
 Only the few French people remaining in the country and a
 number of converted Vietnamese and Khmer Loeu profess Christ-
 ianity; nearly all are Roman Catholics.
 The doctrines of Buddhism which underlie most Khmer values
 and attitudes provide a code for daily lives and enhance na-
 tional unity.   There are more than 2,700 pagodas in the country
 -- one in nearly every village -- and more than 65,000 per-
 manent bonzes (monks).   Despite its pervasion into most as-
 pects of Khmer society, the role and influence of Buddhism
 has diminished in the past few decades, particularly in the

 D.   Language
 Khmer has been the national language of Cambodia since
 1953, when it replaced French.   A language of the Mon-Khmer
 family, it is spoken not only by the Khmers but as a second
 language, with varying degrees of proficiency, by the minor-
 ity groups.  As they become more and more assimilated, in-
 creasing numbers of these minorities are using it as a first
 language. Only the more remotely located Khmer Loeu tribes
 of the Eastern Highlands are unfamiliar with Khmer.  Many
 of the minorities are conversant in more than two languages.
 The Chinese, for example, may speak one of several Chinese
 dialects in every day conversation, use Mandarin in school

 instruction, Vietnamese in the market place, and Khmer at
 all other times.   The Thai and Vietnamese languages, although
 containing many Mon-Khmer elements, are unintelligible to a
 Khmer-speaker.
 To strengthen national unity the Cambodian Government
 has promoted Khmer as the lingua franca and discouraged the
 use of French and minority languages.   Since the departure
 of the French colonialists, Khmer has increasingly replaced
 French in the Government and in the schools.   Wider use of
 Khmer is impeded, however, by a vocabulary deficient in
 technical terms, and lack of a uniform system of romaniza-
 tion and transliteration in the writing system.   Use of
 French, therefore, persists in intellectual, official, and
 commercial circles; it is rarely spoken in rural areas.
 Knowledge of English, although increasing, has been limited
 to Government officials and others with advanced educations.
 Well over half of the Cambodian population is literate,
 although reading proficiency of most persons is not high
 because of the paucity of reading materials.   Literacy has
 been stressed since independence; the reduction in illiteracy
 has been marked since 1964 when a literacy campaign was
 launched by then-Prince Sihanouk.   The Government has placed
 great emphasis on education to prepare Cambodians to re-
 place French and Vietnamese in civil service positions.
 School enrollments have outstripped the teaching staffs and
 the scarcity of qualified teachers has been a serious prob-
 lem; quality of education, consequently, has been low.   Al-
 though primary education is compulsory, few complete the
 six years.   Because competition for enrollment in the few
 secondary facilities is keen, moreover, only about one-half
 of those who complete their primary schooling continue at
 the secondary level.   Secondary education consists of one
 4-year and one 3-year period.   Cambodia has only nine uni-
 versities with a combined enrollment of less than 7,000
 students.  Many students -- often financed by foreign aid --
 travel abroad to attain a university-level education.   Be-
 cause there are few positions in the civil service and com-
 merce which require a higher education, the Government has
 stressed technical and vocational training.   Students are
 encouraged to remain in their own communities where, it is
 hoped, their new talents will contribute to local develop-
 ment and production.
 Most of the primary education previously provided by the
 Buddhist pagodas has been assumed by Government-run schools.

 Education provided in French, Chinese, and Vietnamese private
 schools, moreover, are now closely regulated by the Govern-
 ment which requires that Khmer be taught at least three hours
 weekly.   The Chinese schools have been the targets of most
 restrictions, it being feared they were being used to teach
 Communist subversive doctrine.   Chinese secondary schools
 have been closed and Chinese students denied from traveling
 abroad for a higher education.   The Chinese have thus been
 forced to attend Government schools to attain more than an
 elementary education.   The Vietnamese have been more willing
 than the Chinese to attend Government schools in which Khmer
 is the language of instruction.
 F.   Settlement Pattern and Housing
 Hundreds of small Khmer villages dot the lowland areas
 of Cambodia in a predominantly linear pattern which may ex-
 end for miles atop natural river levees or along roads.
 Such villages may form unbroken lines of settlement for
 miles along the Mekong and Bassac Rivers or their tributary
 waterways.   In the Transitional Plain, where conditions are
 drier and roads and waterways fewer, linear patterns are less
 pronounced; villages more often are clustered in wooded plots
 amid the ricefields, commonly at the base of one of the ubiq-
 uitous phnoms (hills).  A distinctive settlement pattern
 rings the shores of the Tonle Sap -- an outer ring of villages
 situated just above the high water line, inhabited by rice
 farmers, whose individual dwellings are scattered among the
 trees; an inner ring of "floating villages" built on tall pil-
 ings or on rafts, clustered between the high and low water
 lines.   Houses in such villages, occupied mostly by Vietnamese
 fishermen, are surrounded by water during much of the year.
 Floating villages consisting of houseboats tied together are
 also characteristic of the Tonle Sap lake region.   Fishing
 villages also dot the coast of the Gulf of Thailand, par-
 ticularly in its eastern sector.
 Khmer villages are autonomous, self-sufficient, and self-
 contained.  Most have a school, one or two pagodas, shops,
 and some form of rural government.   Khmer Loeu villages in
 the mountainous regions are generally much smaller than those
 villages found in the lowlands.   Most are comprised of a
 cluster of a dozen or so ramshackle single-family longhouses
 50 feet or more long.
 Most rural Khmers still live in thatched houses, although
 wood, tile, and masonry are becoming common construction ma-
 terials in better homes.   Nearly all houses in the lowlands
 -- even those well away from the waterways -- are built on

 piles or stilts.   These stilts, generally ten feet high, range
 from mere tree branches to finished beams resting on concrete,
 depending on the age and wealth of the settlement.  A typical
 Khmer home will have floors of woven bamboo and walls of that-
 ched palm fronds or savanna grass.   The thatched roof is al-
 ways sharply gabled with overhanging eaves; there are no win-
 dows, but a space between the walls and eaves provides venti-
 lation.   Roofs are usually of either nipa fronds or grass
 thatch, depending on availability of such materials; some low-
 land houses may have roofs of corrugated metal.  A few well
 constructed houses of wood, tile, and masonry are found in
 urban areas.   Depending on family size, lowland houses may
 have from one to four or five rooms.

 Dwelling construction in the mountains is usually of that-
 ched walls (windowless) and roof.   Although most longhouses
 are perched on stilts, some mountain houses are built direct-
 ly on the ground.   One large room is the rule for single-
 family dwellings, several single-room family units for the
 longhouses.   In both lowlands and uplands, privacy is mini-
 mal, crowding general.   Poor farmers may have only one room,
 but many houses have several rooms separated by partitions of
 dried palm fronds which provide visual privacy only.   Fur-
 nishings are austere, consisting mostly of mats and cushions.
 A kitchen shed may be separate from the house and joined by
 a ramp, or it may be found under,the house.   Rural houses
 are commonly surrounded by fruit trees with vegetable gar-
 dens in the back.   Few rural houses have privies or wells.
 G.   Ceremonies and Holidays
 The Cambodians participate in numerous ceremonies.   Some
 are religious or semi-religious observances, while others are
 secular fairs or commemorations of national historical events.
 Most are observed by all peasants re ardless of religious af-
 filiation or political leanings.

 A number of community festivals are held during crucial
 periods of the rice-growing season.   Their purpose is to pro-
 tect the crop from evil spirits so that a bountiful harvest
 can be attained.   Paramount among such festivals is the
 "Ploughing of the Holy Furrow", held at the beginning of the
 rainy season (late May or early June).   Rituals performed by
 the royal family are believed to forecast the results of the
 year's crop; the findings of the ritual, in fact, may influ-
 ence the Government's rice policy for that year.   The "Fes-
 tival of the Reversing Current", more often called simply
 the "Water Festival.", is held for three days at the end of
 the rainy season (late October or early November).   It com-
 memorates the reversal of the Tonle Sap waters as they flow
 once again into the Mekong.   Throngs of people line the river
 in Phnom Penh to watch the Chief of State cut a ribbon to
 symbolically "release" its waters.   The major attractions of
 the festival, however, are the regattas of hundreds of 40-man
 pirogues, each representing a village, held on the Mekong in
 front of the Royal Palace.

 The anniversary of Buddha's death is observed in early
 February with a festival in the pagodas; a one-day celebra-
 tion, held in late April or early May, honors his birth.
 "Prachum Ben", a religious festival in which offerings are
 made to the Buddhist bonzes for the benefit of the spirits
 of the dead, is held in the pagodas for several days, usu-
 ally late in September.   Each pagoda has its own "Kathen"
 day in October or November when the villagers present of-
 ferings to the bonzes.   In addition to such annual obser-
 vances, there are semi-monthly Buddhist holy days on which
 all Buddhists are exempted from labor; most peasants, how-
 ever, do not break their daily work patterns.
 New Years is observed for three days in mid-April.*
 A festival-like atmosphere prevails with an abundance of
 sporting events and dances.   Thousands of pilgrims flock
 to the Buddhist shrines -- particularly to Angkor -- where
 they pray for good fortune.   Like the western New Year,
 individuals propose to "turn over a new leaf."  Other sec-
 ular holidays observed include Labor Day -- 1 May; Consti-
 tution Day -- 6 May; United Nations Day -- 24 October; and
 Independence Day -- 9 November.   The celebration of Inde-
 pendence Day includes a military parade in Phnom Penh,
 sports events in the Olympic Stadium, and dancing near the
 Royal Palace.   Such officially sanctioned holidays, combined
 with other tacitly recognized ceremonial days, total some 50
 to 60 days yearly.   The latter include such western holi-
 days as Christmas and the 1 January New Year which not only
 may be recognized by the western-oriented elite but may be
 eagerly acknowledged by most other Cambodians, anxious to
 celebrate any occasion.
 The Chinese an    ietnamese observe their own New Year's
 Day celebration some time in late January or early Feb-
 ruary.

 H.   Ethnic Groups
 Number and Location:   The Khmer (Cambodians), who num-
 ber about 5,950,000, comprise about 87 percent of Cambodia's
 population.   They are found throughout the country but are
 concentrated in the lowlands.   Under-represented in the
 cities, the Khmers are outnumbered by the combined Chinese
 and Vietnamese populations in about half of Cambodia's ur-
 ban centers.                      (An additional 450,000 Khmer reside in South
 Vietnam, more than 600,000 in Thailand, and small numbers
 in Laos.)   Since 1960, the Cambodian Government has pro-
 moted the resettlement of Khmers in frontier regions to pre-
 vent penetration by Communist insurgents and to relieve ur-
 ban unemployment.   The program has been curtailed by pre-
 vailing unsettled conditions.
 Racial Characteristics and Social Structure:   The Khmer
 stem from a diverse ethnic stock which had its origins in
 South China before the Christian era.   Centuries of inter-
 mixing with other groups has led to a wide variety of phys-
 ical traits.   Generally, however, they have dark, coffee-
 colored skin, wavy to curly hair, straight-set eyes, sturdy
 physiques, and an average male height of 514".
 Cambodia is a land of villages, and most rural Khmer
 are conservative peasants whose lives are based on wet-rice
 agriculture. In addition to the peasants, there are three
 divisions within Khmer society; the royalty, bureaucracy,
 and monkhood.   The status of the royal family has suffered
 as a result of Sihanouk's removal from power.   No signifi-
 cant Khmer middle class exists, but the upper ranks of the
 bureaucracy are emerging to fill this gap.   The status of
 the monkhood is as yet unchallenged.
 Attitudes and Values:   Theravada Buddhism imparts to
 all Khmer common values which emphasize gentleness, seren-
 ity, and unity within Cambodia.  Most Khmer Buddhists ob-
 serve the basic precepts of their moral code and abstain
 from such moral aberrations as taking a life (animal or
 human), committing adultery, or partaking of intoxicants.
 Buddhism stresses the concept of man as the sum total of
 his merits and demerits.  Merit is accumulated through of-
 ferings made to monks or other devout people or through
 virtuous deeds such as service to the community or pagoda.
 Buddhist ethics are mixed with traditional folk beliefs in
 the rural areas; most Khmers believe in supernatural beings
 and perform propitiation rites to appease the spirits.

 The average Khmer peasant, largely conditioned by Budd-
 hist teachings, stresses spiritual rather than material
 goals.   He grows only enough food. to feed his family; any
 surplus  is usually sold to a Chinese merchant and the pro-
 ceeds donated to his pagoda.   Except for work in the village
 fields, manual labor is looked down upon and avoided when
 possible.
 Traditional Buddhist values are being modified by west-
 ern influences, especially among the Khmer youth who feel
 that such values inhibit progress.   Those in urban areas
 are showing increasing concern for national and internation-
 al problems.   These Western-oriented individuals are less
 willing to accept the status quo than is the peasant ele-
 ment.
 Khmers are generally amiable and have a strong aver-
 sion to violence.   Territorial threats by aggressive neigh-
 bors, however, have helped shape their attitudes toward
 foreign peoples.   Khmers dislike the Vietnamese and look
 upon them as conquerors who have deprived Cambodia of much
 of her territory.   South Vietnamese troops in Cambodia to-
 day are condemned as guilty of pillaging villages that they
 occupy.   The Khmers are similarly suspicious of the Thais
 who also have practiced territorial aggrandizement at Khmer
 expense.   Thailand, moreover, has offered refuge to Cambo-
 dian dissidents during the past fifteen years, an irritant
 to Cambodian officials particularly.
 Khmers resent and envy the Chinese; the peasant espec-
 ially dislikes the Chinese moneylenders and rice merchants
 to whom he is always heavily in debt.   Some resentment
 against the French among the educated Khmers may persist
 but the common people hold no strong feelings regarding
 them.
 Dress:   The national dress of the Khmer peasant, called
 a "sampot", is worn by both men and women.   It consists of
 a long cotton or silk cloth, wrapped around the waist, pas-
 sed through the legs and fastened in back.                      Women also wear
 blouses and shawls, or a sarong-type shirt may be suspended
 above the breasts; men may wear a shirt or high-necked tunic.
 Children's dress is more westernized -- boys wear shirts and
 shorts, while girls wear blouses and skirts or simple dress-
 es.   Although traditional clothing is still worn in rural
 areas, urban dress is rapidly becoming westernized.

 Occupations:   Khmer peasants are small land holders
 who grow wet rice, maize, and vegetables in a subsistence
 economy.   Each family cultivates its own fields; tenant
 farming and sharecropping are rare.   During the off sea-
 son, from late fall to early spring, most Khmer peasants
 fish, cut wood, do odd jobs, or are temporarily employed
 in nearby towns.   Non-farming jobs in the countryside,
 including those in the rubber plantations, usually are held
 by Chinese or Vietnamese.   Since 1956, the Government has
 tried to undercut the economic position of Chinese and
 Vietnamese but with limited. success.

 In urban centers, Khmers monopolize Government and
 clerical positions as well as manual labor occupations.
 Increasing numbers are entering commercial and profession-

 Number and Location:   Estimates of the number of ethnic
 Chinese living in Cambodia as of 1967 range from 400,000
 to 450,000 -- about six percent of the national population.
 One recent study enumerated 250,000 Chinese in the country,
 50,000 partially acculturated Sino-Cambodians  (naturalized
 Chinese or offspring of mixed marriages), and innumerable
 assimilated Sino-Cambodians.  A growing proportion of the
 Chinese are native-horn, and assimilation is drawing part
 of their natural increase into the Khmer population.   Most
 immigrant Chinese Cambodians are from eastern Kwangtung,
 Fukien or Hainan and traveled overland to Vietnam and then
 into Cambodia.   The period from 1946-1950 marked the last
 big wave of Chinese immigration; since 1952-1953, very few
 ,have been admitted into Cambodia.
 The Chinese are largely urban-oriented.  Almost 60 per-
 cent of all Chinese live in the three or four major towns
 in each province, e.g., the Chinese comprise nearly one-
 half of Sisophon's population, about one-fifth of Battam-

 bang's and about one-sixth of Phnom Penh's.*  Just over one-
 third of all Chinese, about 135,000, live in Phnom Penh
 while another 12 percent live in the towns of Battambang,
 Kampot, and Kompong Cham.
 The Chinese have always been considered a rather seden-
 tary group, and population movement among the Chinese com-
 munity is a recent phenomenon.   As unemployment increases
 and the rupture of the Cambodian economy appears imminent,
 Chinese merchants are fleeing to Bangkok, Hong Kong, and
 Paris.   Since July 1970, for instance, 2,000 ethnic Chi-
 nese have fled the Sisophon-Battambang town area to Thai-
 land.
 Most non-urban Chinese concentrations are in fishing
 colonies along the coast or on pepper plantations in Takeo
 and Kampot provinces.   Other Chinese are widely dispersed
 throughout the southern half of the country as rice millers,
 brokers, village merchants and peddlers, and market garden-
 ers.   Few rural Chinese are rice farmers.
 The Chinese can be divided into five major subgroups
 based on language and. origin -- Teuchui, Cantonese, Hainan-
 ese, Hakka, and IIokkien:

 More than three-fourths of all Cambodian Chinese are Teu-
 chui from southern Kwangtung.   Less than 70 percent of ur-
 ban Chinese are Teuchui; 90 percent of all rural Chinese,
 however, belong to this subgroup, working as itinerant
 peddlers or village shopkeepers.   Cantonese, who consti-
 tute 10 percent of the total Chinese, are 84 percent urban
 with most concentrated in Phnom Penh, Battambang, and Kom-
 pong Cham.   The Hainanese make up eight percent of the Chi-
 nese population, most living in Kampot Province.   Large

 after the failure of many of the pepper gardens in Kampot
 Province.   Their number is growing at Sre Ambel in Koh Kong
 Province as pepper plantations increase.  A concentration
 of Hainanese also is found in Sisophon where they form almost
 half the Chinese population.   The Hakka from Kwangtung, who
 form about three percent of the total Chinese population,
 are concentrated in Takeo Province but are also found around
 Virachei in Ratanakiri Province.   They grow vegetables,
 cultivate a little rubber, and run small general stores.
 The Hokkien from Fukien, about three percent of the Chinese
 population, are almost entirely urban; only 10 percent of
 their number live in rural areas, most in Battambang Pro-
 vince.   About 1,000 northern Chinese, mostly from 11upei Pro-
 vince, have come to Cambodia and all are urban residents of
 Phnom Penh.
 Social Structure:   The Chinese group themselves into
 compact quarters in Cambodian urban and rural communities in
 order to better preserve their ways of life and culture.
 They have been unobtrusive and generally apathetic to events
 in the Cambodian community.   The social and political struc-
 ture of the Chinese consists of a network of voluntary as-
 sociations which provide communication and control channels
 for the community.   Each of the five different dialect
 groups in Phnom Penh formerly had its own socio-political or-
 ganization known as the "congregation".   Elsewhere, several
 dialect groups would combine into a single congregation.   In
 April 1958, the Cambodian Government abolished congregations,
 but other significant associations began to take their place.
 Sports clubs are today among the most active Chinese organi-
 zations; they organize a wide range of activities such as
 music, opera, folk dancing, literature programs, and adult
 education.   They also administer mutual aid and settle dis-
 putes, therefore functioning as an important integrative
 force within Chinese communities.   (Many Chinese groups have
 been split over the issue of Communism.)
 Occupational guilds, based on dialect groups, defend the
 Chinese against Government trade restrictions.   The Govern-
 ment has been attempting to dissolve them in order to weaken
 the economic-social cohesiveness of the Chinese community.
 School boards also play an important role in the Chinese
 community.
 The basic Chinese social unit, of course, is the extend-
 ed, patrilineal family.   The family is essentially the most
 important instrument through which Chinese values and cul-
 ture are preserved.   Individual interests are subordinated
 to those of the family, and senior members of a family are
 consulted on all major decisions of its members.

 Place in Society:    The Chinese hold very prominent po-
 sitions in the economy of Cambodia, the wealthiest and most
 influential being found among the Cantonese.  Ambitious and
 industrious, their economic success results in part from a
 pragmatic and utilitarian attitude.   With the Vietnamese,
 they comprise the nation's mercantile and artisan middle
 class.   They dominate businesses such as retailing, export-
 import, banking, rice-milling, rice-brokerage, entertain-
 ment, and bus-truck transport.   They practically monopo-
 lize the ownership and management of the fishing industry.
 In contrast to their managerial positions, they also are
 manual laborers, often in jobs where the Cambodian peasant
 will not deign to work.   Throughout the countryside, Chi-
 nese can he found as village merchants and are engaged in
 the trade, processing, and transport of rice and other ag-
 ricultural products(they generally participate in the sale
 of produce rather than in the actual farming of the product).
 Chinese from northern China are often found as professionals
 such as dentists and teachers in the larger urban centers.
 The Cambodian Government has attempted to gain more con-
 trol over Chinese economic enterprises with policies re-
 stricting alien participation in certain activities.   For
 example, since 1956 alien employment has been banned in
 eighteen occupations including taxi, bus, and truck drivers,
 moneylenders, rice merchants, jewelers, barbers, and printers.

 While measures such as this have caused anxiety in the Chi-
 nese community, adjustments have been made.   Such restric-
 tions have been circumvented by employing Khmer "fronts,"
 by Chinese taking out naturalization papers, or simply by
 the Chinese financial "squeeze" tactics.   The fact that
 Khmers are not trained or qualified in certain of these oc-
 cupations strengthens the Chinese position.
 The Chinese are largely excluded from the Khmer social
 order.   They are resented by the Khmer for their wealth and
 clannishness, yet admired for their economic talents and
 are actually sought as marriage partners by Cambodians.
 Sino-Cambodians are considered a good hybrid, and this group
 enjoys a high status in Cambodian society.   The Chinese have
 assimilated better than the Vietnamese as they adapt inof-
 fensively to local environments.   Yet the Chinese often form
 cultural islands and have few active social relations with
 non-Chinese.
 The Chinese have little political power.   Despite their
 wealth, they are excluded from politics as pure Chinese
 cannot become citizens unless they undergo expensive and
 demanding naturalization procedures.   They may attain limit-
 ed political power through bribery but generally are politi-
 cally disinterested; they avoid politics, but if required to
 choose sides, are very opportunistic.   They tend to support
 groups in power but may secretly aid the opposition.  As of
 June 1970 Phnom Penh Chinese were reportedly politically
 neutral in their attitude toward the Lon Nol government.
 The majority, however, probably continue to respect Sihan-
 ouk and passively oppose the present government.
 Religion:   There are marked differences between Chinese
 and Khmer with regard to religion.   The Chinese are eclectic
 in their approach to religion, confessing belief in Buddhism,
 Taoism, and Confucism, while also maintaining their tradi-
 tional ancestor worship.   The 10,000 Chinese Buddhists, all
 of whom live in Phnom Penh, are Mahayana Buddhists, which
 distinguishes them from the Khmer Theravada Buddhist believ-
 ers.   Chinese show no interest in Khmer Buddhist festivals,
 and few Chinese become monks.
 Language and Education:   Only two of the five Chinese
 dialects spoken in Cambodia are mutually intelligible (Teu-
 chui and Fukienese).  Mandarin, taught in all Chinese schools,
 is being developed as the lingua franca of the Chinese com-
 munity.   Since none of the five dialects is mutually intel-
 ligible with Mandarin, the transition is difficult.   Lacking
 a common dialect and engaged in a multitude of economic

 enterprises, Chinese are more than any other group, bi- or
 multi-lingual.   Fortunately, written Chinese can be read by
 literate persons of any dialect group, which helps unite
 the community.
 Chinese send their children to their own private schools
 to learn Chinese language and customs.*  Probably close to
 two-thirds of all Chinese students are enrolled in Chinese
 schools.   Literacy is higher among the Chinese than among
 the Khmer.   Formerly, Chinese students were sent abroad to
 North and South Vietnam, Communist China, Taipei, Singapore,
 Hong Kong, and Paris for higher education.   This practice
 was severely curtailed, however, as Government provisions
 enacted under Sihanouk barred re-entry of any Chinese who
 remained abroad for longer than three months.
 Chinese newspapers are prevalent; even in 1962-63 their
 circulation was estimated to be 28,700, three-fifths of the
 total newspaper circulation in Phnom Penh.   Chinese radio
 programs and movie houses cater to the Chinese.   Prior to
 assumption of power by the present government, it is believ-
 ed that mass media was increasingly being dominated by those
 with pro-Communist feelings.
 Dress:   Urban and rural Chinese men commonly wear West-
 ern dress -- sport shirts, trousers, and leather shoes or
 sandals.   Women also generally are clothed in Western attire,
 but they may wear Chinese dresses  (cheongsams) or cotton
 jackets and trousers, depending upon their age, social class
 or the occasion.
 Housing:   Most urban Chinese, as well as those who are
 village merchants in the countryside, live in shophouses.
 These structures have a retail outlet or business office on
 the ground floor, and a family residence above the shops.
 Other Chinese houses in the cities are modified by Western
 influences, and rural homes are traditionally built on the
 ground instead of on posts in the style of Khmer homes.
 Also, Chinese houses are frequently larger than Khmer homes
 to accommodate the greater number of relatives under one
 roof.
 Presently, many Chinese schools are being used as refuge
 camps for the Vietnamese; these schools did not reopen for
 the 1970 fall term.

 Number  Location and Movement:   Cambodia's Vietnamese
 community, prior to the repatriation since April 1970 of
 between one-third and one-half of its members to South Viet-
 nam, numbered some 300,000 to 400,000 and comprised between
 four and six percent of the country's population.*  The size
 of the community always has fluctuated considerably as there
 has been, down through the years, much movement back-and-
 forth between Cambodia and South Vietnam, depending on pre-
 vailing political conditions in the two countries.                          The
 Vietnamese have been widely dispersed throughout the country,
 with major concentrations in:   1) the border provinces of
 Kompong Cham, Svay Rieng, and Prey Veng, 2) Phnom Penh and
 surrounding areas in Kandal Province, and 3) around the shores
 of the Tonle Sap, particularly in Kompong Chhnang Province
 along the lower part of the lake.   Those in Phnom Penh --
 who have remained largely isolated in their "Vietnamese
 Quarter" -- have been estimated to comprise as much as one-
 third of the city's population; now, of course, they comprise
 but a small fraction.   In the border provinces, probably a
 majority of the Vietnamese have gone to Vietnam; in the pro-
 vinces around the Tonle Sap, on the other hand, most are
 believed to have resisted repatriation and remained in their
 impoverished communities.   Areas with secondary -- but sizeable
 -- Vietnamese communities are the provinces of Kratie, Battam-
 bang, Kampot, and Takeo; many are concentrated in the capital
 cities of these provinces.
 'As of July-y__27, 1970, approximately 162,000 persons from
 Cambodia had sought refuge in South Vietnam, most of whom
 were ethnic Vietnamese.  Vietnamese remaining in Cambodia,
 therefore, probably now number between 150,000 and 300,000.

 Although Vietnamese have lived in Cambodia for centuries,
 the heaviest influx occurred during the last quarter of the
 19th century.   The French Colonial Government encouraged them
 to emigrate from Vietnam to administrative positions in the
 Government and in commercial firms, and to work on the rubber
 plantations; indigenous Khmers were generally considered by
 the French to be indolent and unsuited for such work.  Most
 immigrants came from Cochin China, some from Tonkin, rela-
 tively few from Annam.
 Many Vietnamese have migrated fromCambodia to South Viet-
 nam during the past two decades because of Government dis-
 criminatory policies directed against "aliens".   Tens of
 thousands of Vietnamese have been "repatriated" to South
 Vietnam since April 1970 when hostilities directed against
 them by the Khmers  (including reported atrocities where
 hundreds were slaughtered) forced them to flee their homes.
 Many, reportedly dissatisfied with conditions in South Viet-
 nam, have been returning to Cambodia.   Other than for such
 cross-border migrations, only the Vietnamese fishermen,
 living on "floating villages" and houseboats on the Tonle Sap
 and Mekong waterways can be classified as migratory peoples;
 Vietnamese farmers, rubber tappers, and merchants are a sed-
 entary lot.
 Racial Characteristics:  Although they have a slightly
 smaller and shorter body structure, there is little else in
 terms of physical appearance to set the Vietnamese apart from
 their Khmer neighbors.   In dress and language, however, the
 Vietnamese are distinctive.   The women are easy to identify
 by their ankle-length cotton dresses split to the waist over
 loose-fitting slacks.  Men's attire is not so readily distin-
 guishable from that of the Khmers although, like the women,
 they may wear the wide, loose-fitting trousers.   In the fields,
 both sexes commonly wear a pointed fiber hat.   The Vietnamese
 continue to speak their native tongue although most are con-
 versant in Khmer.   Vietnamese is the language most commonly
 used in the market place.   Private Vietnamese schools are
 few, mostly limited to Phnom Penh where they have been run by
 Catholic priests. Most Vietnamese children attend state
 schools in which Khmer is the language of instruction.

 Social Structure:   The Vietnamese have not assimilated
 with the Khmers but) instead, remain isolated in their own
 generally close-knit communities.   Such segregation is en-
 hanced by the Khmers who want little to do with the Viet-
 namese.   Although the Vietnamese family is extended and pa-
 trilineal like that of the Chinese, family ties are believ-
 ed to be weaker and less formal.   Political and cultural
 institutions, moreover, are not so well developed.   There
 is little political unification among the Vietnamese in
 Cambodia and little concept of belonging to a common
 ethnic community.

 Attitudes and Values:  A history of intense antipathy
 between the Khmer an    ietnamese communities in Cambodia
 culminated in the mid-1970 massacre of hundreds of Viet-
 namese civilians by Cambodian Army (FANK) troops and the
 expulsion of many others to South Vietnam.   Despite the
 friction between the two communities, however, day-to-day
 relations have otherwise been resolved -- albeit probably
 with a minimum of goodwill.  Much of the Khmer resentment
 of the Vietnamese is based on real or imagined economic
 exploitation of the Khmer peasants, by Vietnamese merchants.
 Strangely, there apparently is little resentment of the
 Chinese merchants.   Vietnamese -- unless of mixed Khmer-
 Vietnamese parentage -- are not eligible for Cambodian
 citizenship and, hence, have virtually no political voice.
 Since the dissolution of the French colonial empire in
 Indochina and the creation of Cambodia as an independent
 country in 1949, the Government has practiced de facto
 legal and economic discrimination against the Vietnamese
 community.   For example, the Government has enacted laws
 which have barred foreigners from a number of occupations,
 including fishing, which were dominated by the Vietnamese.
 The effectiveness of such discriminatory policies, however,
 has been minimized because of the presence of a sizeable
 Khmer minority in South Vietnam, vulnerable to similar
 practices by the Government of South Vietnam.
 Although most Vietnamese in Cambodia probably would
 profess allegiance to one of the Vietnams rather than to
 Cambodia, the community is essentially apolitical.  Appar-
 ent political apathy and lack of evidence of strong polit-
 ical ties with either Vietnam, however, has not prevented
 the community from being suspect in the eyes of the Govern-
 ment.   Some officials feel that Communist penetration may
 be highly developed.   Many of the Vietnamese fisherment on
 the Tonle Sap are believed to have supported the Communist
 cause for years and, reportedly, have protected and sup-
 plied North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops in the area.  An
 undetermined number of NVA troops were reported in August
 1970 to be using islands in the Tonle Sap as sanctuaries.
 RRe~eli~gion__:   The religion of the Vietnamese, too, is dis-
 tinct from that of the Khmers.  Although the majority of the
 Vietnamese are Buddhists, they belong to the Mahayana sect
 shared by their brethren in Vietnam which is distinct from
 the Theravada Buddhism practiced throughout the rest of
 Southeast Asia.   According to a French vicar of the Roman
 Catholic cathedral in Phnom Penh, there were about 55,000
 Catholic Vietnamese in Cambodia (other estimates are some-
 what lower) prior to the extension of the current Indochina

 conflict into Cambodia.  Most had lived in Phnom Penh and
 nearly all have now fled to South Vietnam.  An estimated
 20,000 to 40,000 Vietnamese in Cambodia belonged to the
 Cao Dai, an eclectic South Vietnam sect which draws on
 Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Christianity.   It has
 between one and two million adherents in South Vietnam.
 Occupations:   The Vietnamese have played an important
 role in the economy of Cambodia, in much the same way that
 the Overseas Chinese have contributed to the economies of
 all Southeast Asian countries -- as shopkeepers and mer-
 chants, white collar workers, teachers, secretaries, clerks,
 and skilled craftsmen.   The Vietnamese, however, have re-
 mained well down the socio-economic ladder from the Chinese
 and, unlike the Chinese, few are wealthy.   Large numbers
 of Vietnamese have been employed in low-paying jobs -- as
 coolies, pedicab drivers, or at other unskilled labor.
 Many of those living in rural areas are impoverished.   The
 40,000 to 60,000 fishermen on the Tonle Sap, in particular,
 have been a poverty-stricken lot, usually heavily indebted
 to the Chinese businessmen who control the fishing industry.
 Many of the estimated 25,000 Vietnamese rubber tappers had
 been losing their jobs to Khmers and had been forced to emi-
 grate to South Vietnam long before the current mass exodus.
 Settlement Patterns and Housing:   The Vietnamese have
 not assimilated with the Khmers but, instead, remain iso-
 lated in their own generally close-knit communities.   Such
 segregation is enhanced by the Khmers who want little to
 do with the Vietnamese.   Vietnamese settlements are con-
 centrated along waterways.   Many of the Vietnamese fisher-
 men along the Tonle Sap live in "floating villages" sup- ,
 ported by pontoons or sampans which, during the dry season,
 are moved away from the shores into deeper water.

 Number and Location:   Khmer Loeu is a collective term
 which refers to the mountain, tribal peoples of Cambodia.
 These upland Cambodians are dispersed throughout the forests
 and grass-covered hills in the northeast, adjacent to both
 the Laotian and South Vietnamese border lands.   Others are
 found in the mountainous areas north of Veal Renh, among
 the western Cardamomes mountains, and along the Thai border
 in the far north; but the majority of Khmer Loeu in these
 areas is no longer ethnically distinct.  Assimilation to
 a Cambodian culture and way of life has greatly reduced the
 individuality of the Khmer Loeu west of the Mekong.
 Estimates of the numbers of Khmer Loeu in Cambodia
 range between 30,000 and 80,000, comprising somewhat less
 than two percent of the total population.   Three categories
 of Khmer Loeu can be distinguished according to linguistic
 characteristics.   1) The Malayo-Polynesian tribes, of which
 the Rhade and Jarai are the largest, are found east of the
 Mekong in Stung Treng, Kratie, Ratanakiri, and Mondolkiri
 provinces.   Their skin color ranges from light to medium
 brown; their hair is straight or wavy; and their builds are
 slender and short (5'2").  Most of the Rhade, whose numbers

 total between 100,000 and. 115,000, live on the Darlac Pla-
 teau within South Vietnam.   The approximately 40,000 in Cam-
 bodia occupy areas principally in the eastern parts of Mon-
 dolkiri Province; some Rhade, however, may have migrated
 farther westward.   The Jarai also are predominantly a South
 Vietnamese tribe; only 16,500 out of their total of 200,000
 occupy areas just to the north of the Rhade in northeastern
 Mondolkiri and eastern Ratanakiri Province, as far north as
 the Laotian border.
 (2)   The Eastern Mon-Khmer peoples, which include the
 Stieng and A I'nong tribes, physically resemble the Malayo-
 Polynesian tribes but are linguistically more similar to
 Mon-Khmer tongues.   These Eastern Mon-Khmer tribes, who
 number 30,000-55,000, predominate in areas south and east
 of Kratie and in adjacent areas in South Vietnam.   The
 ,M'nong, which include the Biet and Krol tribes, number about
 15,000 in Cambodia and are found south of the main concentra-
 tions of Rhade in eastern Mondolkiri; the Stieng, who number
 close to 40,000 in Cambodia, occupy low foothills of south-
 ern Mondolkiri.
 (3)   The Western Mon-Khmer include the Kui, Pear, Chong,
 Saoch, and other small tribal groups which are found west
 of the Mekong in the mountains of the Southwest or distribu-
 ted across the northern provinces adjacent to the Thai bor-
 der.   They are related to the Khmers both linguistically and
 physically, and are readily assimilated into the Khmer way
 of life.   The Kui, who number 10,000 and live interspersed
 with Khmers from Siem Reap to Stung Treng province, have
 adopted Buddhism and become almost complete Cambodianized.
 The Chong, who live along the Thai-Cambodian border in Bat-
 tambang province, are also largely assimilated into Khmer
 society and have integrated with the Thais,.who are found in
 the northern border regions.   The Pear, along the northern
 slopes of the Cardamomes mountains west of Pursat have become
 "Cambodianized", and have adopted Buddhism to replace their
 animist practices.   The Saoch, north of Veal Renh, are the
 most resistant to assimilation.
 Place in Society:   The Khmer Loeu are looked upon as in-
 feriors     the Khmer who generally refer to them as "Phnong",
 that is, "savage."   Until the end of the nineteenth century,
 many eastern Khmer Loeu were enslaved by the Cambodians.   In
 recent years the Cambodian Government has used the Khmer
 Loeu as a labor force; each man over 15 years old is taxed
 a specific amount of labor per year, a practice which has
 created resentment on the part of the Khmer Loeu toward the
 Government.

 In an attempt to encourage the "Cambodianization" or
 "Khmerization" of the Khmer Loeu people, the Cambodian gov-
 ernment undertook road building to increase the accessibil-
 ity of the tribal areas and built new villages for the Khmer
 Loeu along these roads.   The tribal people, however, gener-
 ally resisted these "Khmerization" efforts.
 Some tribes such as the Rhade'
 and Jarai, abetted by
 Vietnamese Communists, were already in active insurgency
 against the Cambodian Government before the current exten-
 sion of Communist control over eastern Cambodia.   In fact,
 tribal uprisings in 1968 led to the collapse of government
 control in extensive areas of the northeast.   Under Com-
 munist control, the tribal people are certainly involved in
 forced labor to support the Communist military effort; Com-
 munist propaganda, however, may make the tribes initially feel
 that they have more autonomy than under the Cambodian Govern-
 ment.
 Attitudes and Values:   There is little, if any, sense of
 national consciousness among the Khmer Loeu.   The family is
 preeminent as a focus of loyalty, and individuals are impor-
 tant primarily as members of a family group.                      Larger village
 ties are weak.
 The attitude of the individual Khmer Loeu towards the
 Cambodian lowlander is probably one of mistrust and both pro-
 bably share a mutual antagonism.   The attitude of the Khmer
 Loeu toward an American might well he conditioned by his
 experience with the French or by contact with Americans prior
 to 1965 when diplomatic relations were severed between the
 United States and Cambodia.
 Most Khmer are hospitable, though suspicious, towards
 strangers.   Visitors to a tribal village should always first
 ask to see the village headman.   The initial contact should
 be formal:   hands should be clasped at head level as in pray-
 er and a slight bow should be made.   Religious areas, ani-
 mals, and objects should be noted, and touching or harming
 these should be avoided.   Houses should be entered only if
 escorted by a member of that household.   If invited into a
 house, a jar of rice wine is generally brought forward; a
 prayer is then said and the jar itself becomes sacred.*  The
 wine then is drunk through a straw and one must not refuse
 to drink.   Generally, it is advisable to eat and drink what-
 Large jars stored in the house are sacred and should not
 be touched.

 ever is offered.   Certain items are preferred items for
 barter -- salt, blankets, tobacco, shirts, costume jewelry,
 jackkives, lighters, and flashlights.  Most Khmer Loeu also
 are aware of modern medicines and may ask for such items as
 aspirin and vitamins.   Photographs should be taken only with
 permission.   A quite voice should be used as a sign of re-
 spect.
 The Jarai are characterized as an industrious and reli-
 able people.   Though they may work slowly and methodically,
 young Jarai are generally eager for knowledge, learn quickly,
 and are willing to take direction.   They are proud, indepen-
 dent people who have been known to be militarily aggressive.
 Highly suspicious of strangers, they may react violently to
 false moves. Age and wealth are bases for respect among the
 Jarai; age is honored by positions on village councils and
 wealth indicates that one has been favored by the spirits.
 The Rhade, although reluctant to work too long or hard
 in "western" type work, can endure much physical strain.
 They can walk for days with heavy loads on their backs but,
 because of diet deficiencies, they do require rest and food
 at frequent intervals.   They have a strong desire to learn
 and are especially adept at learning foreign languages.
 They see education as a means to better their communities
 and desire to send their children to school.   Young Rhade
 are encouraged to leave the village to study or work for
 outsiders.   Although Rhade women usually disappear when a
 stranger arrives in the village, the tribe generally is
 hospitable to travelers.
 The M'nong have a reputation for belligerence.   Excit-
 able and aggressive at times, they may be calm and almost
 indolent in other situations.   Under great stress, they re-
 treat into the forest.   They are polite and hospitable, but
 suspicious of a stranger's motives.
 The highly independent Stieng are among the more warlike
 tribes, having been known to raid other villages for slaves
 periodically in the past.   Outsiders consider them apathetic
 and incapable of sustained efforts but they work hard for
 themselves when it comes to hunting, fishing, and farming.
 The Kui are a self-effacing and submissive tribe who
 readily adapt to new situations.   They are intelligent, in-
 dustrious and willing to learn new techniques.   The French,
 for example, persuaded them to adopt wet-land farming.

 The degree to which the Communists will succeed in al-
 tering Khmer Loeu attitudes and values is uncertain.   The
 Communists will use propaganda, pressures, and terror to
 gain the loyalties of the tribes.   If the Communists are
 successful, established tribal patterns will be altered;
 the loss of traditional tribal freedoms then may lead to
 tribal reaction against the Communists.
 Religion:  Most Khmer Loeu are animists and believe that
 spirits can interfere in any facet of everyday life.   Numer-
 ous methods of devination are used to consult spirits before
 acting; offerings and purificatory rites are performed to
 prevent calamities; animals are sacrificed to invoke help
 from the spirits.   Taboo violations require certain kinds of
 sacrifices depending on their gravity.   Chickens, for example,
 may be sacrificed to exonerate minor violations, while major
 infractions may require the sacrifice of a buffalo.
 Among most Khmer Loeu tribes, no strangers are allowed in
 the village for seven days after its establishment.   During
 this time food must be cooked under, rather than in the
 house and many other taboos are also in effect.  An epidemic
 in a village also results in a taboo which prevents strangers
 from entering the village.   Some sort of barrier is then
 found across the village entrance.   Heads of monkeys, shackles
 of elephants, or spears suspended at the gate are usually in-
 dications that the village has been sealed off to outsiders.
 A tribal house is often taboo for three days after the birth
 of a child.   This taboo is indicated by a closed door, and
 a bamboo pole with leaves fastened at the top is stuck in the
 ground in front of the house.   Generally, a stranger breaking
 such a taboo is not subjected to reprisal, unless he repeats
 the violation.
 There is little evidence that missionary activity has had
 any substantial effect among the Khmer Loeu.   French Catholic
 missionaries have worked with the Jarai since the nineteenth
 century but even here conversions have been few (in January
 1961, there had been 500 recorded Jarai converts).   Intol-
 erance of the non-Christian tribesmen toward the convert is
 the principal obstacle to conversion.   The convert no longer
 will partake in traditional tribal religious activities, and
 his abstinence is said to incur the wrath of the spirits, en-
 dangering the well-being of the entire village.
 Through its program of sending Buddhist monks to live in
 tribal villages, the Cambodian Government has succeeded in
 converting many among the western tribes to Buddhism.   Rem-
 nants of spirit worship, however, remain alongside Buddhist

 Language and Education:   Linguistic diversity is great
 among the Khmer Loeu.---TT1-e--y speak a number of mutually un-
 intelligible languages, some of which belong to the Mon-
 Khmer linguistic family while others are related to the Ma-
 lay-Polynesian language family.   Both Mon-Khmer tribal groups,
 the Western (Kui, Saoch, Pear, Chong) and the Eastern (M'nong
 -- Krol and Biet -- and Stieng), speak mutually unintelli-
 gible Mon-Khmer languages.   Because their languages are re-
 lated to the Khmer language, however, understanding of the
 national language is somewhat facilitated.   Khmer is spoken
 as a secondary language among the western minorities with
 varying degrees of proficiency.   The Malayo-Polynesian tribes
 of the northeast (Rhade and Jarai in particular) speak Malay-
 Polynesian tongues which resemble Cham.   For them, adoption
 of Khmer is more difficult and more strongly resisted.
 In the northeast, those tribesmen who worked for the
 French or served in the French Army learned to understand
 that language.   Some of the older tribal people still may
 have some comprehension of spoken French.   Others who have
 been in contact with Americans in Vietnam may have learned
 English.   A few also have picked up some Vietnamese.   How-
 ever, the Khmer Loeu are still isolated from any formal
 academic, language training.   The French attempted to es-
 tablish a school system in Khmer Loeu territory, but their
 educational program was severely limited by lack of teachers,
 facilities, and a remote location.
 Dress:   Personal dress and decorations set the Khmer Loeu
 apart from the Cambodian.   Piercing and elongation of the ear
 lobes is common and heavy ivory earplugs or wooden discs may
 be inserted.    Copper and brass bangles on wrists and ankles
 are worn by most upland tribes.   The extraction or filing
 down of teeth has been common as has the traditional tattooing
 of arms, chest, and forehead.   All such practices are dimin-
 ishing, however, as contact with outsiders increases.
 Most men wear loincloths, sometimes decorated with fringe
 or colored bands.   Women wear long cotton or grass cloth
 skirts, often. belted in the front.   The chest usually remains
 bare, although tunics sometimes are worn.   Blankets are
 added when weather turns cool.    Special ceremonial clothing
 such as thigh-length coats or long shawls, is worn at formal
 affairs.   Turbans are popular among certain tribes on fes-
 tive occasions.   Ready-made clothes are becoming more popular
 and western-style shorts and skirts are increasingly being
 worn.   Men seem especially to favor Western T-shirts.   No

 The slash-burn farmer clears a field at the close of
 the rainy season and leaves it to dry until the end of
 the dry season when it is burned off.   Ile then plants
 such crops as dry rice, corn, cotton, tobacco and/or yams
 and then generally leaves them untended.   The crops grow
 during the rainy season and are harvested four to six
 months later.   The field is then burned over once again
 at the end of the dry season and the cycle is repeated.
 After three years, the soil usually is exhausted and
 fields must be moved to new locations.
 Many Stieng are employed on the rubber plantations at
 Mimot and Snoul.   The Jarai and Kui, excellent iron-for-
 gers, make axes, knives, spearheads, and machetes as a
 supplementary enterprise.   Tribes of the southwest depend
 more on subsidiary economic enterprises to supplement their
 slash-burn agriculture than those tribes of the east.
 Livestock and poultry are raised; gum is collected; animal
 hides are cured.   Some tribal members of the southwest also
 work as farm laborers.

 Settlement Pattern and IIousin :   Khmer Loeu villages
 are widely scattered, autonomous, self-sufficient, and gen-
 erally smaller and more compact than their lowland counter-
 parts.   They average less than 100 persons per village and
 usually contain only about twelve single family houses or a
 few multi-family longhouses.   The location and arrangement of
 houses within a settlement is decided by the village elders
 after consulting the wishes of the spirits.  Villages are of-
 ten fortified by fences of trees, hedges, walls of earth, or
 stockades.

 The Khmer Loeu have a wide variety of house types.
 Ranging from light thatched houses with bamboo frames to more
 substantial, heavily thatched houses with thick log frames.
 Most houses  (except among the M'nong) are built on piles
 from 4-10' high; platform porches are common and serve as
 work areas; bamboo ladders or steps cut into logs are used to
 reach these porch areas.   The longhouses of the Eastern Mon-
 Khmer and Malayo-Polynesian tribes are divided into compart-
 ments, each inhabited by a matri-lineally linked nuclear
 family.   There also is a common room for family gatherings
 and the receiving of gifts.   There are no windows and no
 openings for smoke to escape.   Other buildings include huts
 for rice storage, chicken coops, pig pens, cattle and buffalo
 pens; many of the animals live under the house.

 Western Mon-Khmer, who formerly resided in longhouses,
 now inhabit single family dwellings similar to those of the
 Khmer.   They also are built on piles, and bamboo, rattan,
 straw, and fronds are used in constructing thatched roofs
 and walls.   Though houses may differ in size and elevation
 among specific Khmer Loeu tribes, the basic construction
 materials, compartmentalization, and organization of space
 remain the same among all Khmer Loeu peoples.
 Population Movements:   Tribal movement in normal times
 appears to be fairly localized.   When the slash-burn ag-
 riculture has depleted the fertility of its soils, the en-
 tire village may move to a new area, generally not too far
 distant from the old site.   In an effort to supplement
 their agricultural food supply, tribal hunters may travel
 many miles of jungle trails in the general vicinity of their
 village.   Their knowledge of these trails should make them
 excellent guides in a given locality.
 Many Khmer Loeu served with the French army; some have
 been with the Cambodian forces in frontier outposts; sea-
 sonal work occasions some movement into towns.   Furthermore,
 many Khmer Loeu have been moved to resettlement areas by
 the Cambodian Government; many of those "resettled" may
 have drifted back to the hills.
 In the present unsettled situation in eastern Cambodia,
 many tribal villages probably have moved to more remote
 areas to escape being the target of military action.   Some
 tribal people had earlier escaped northward into southern
 Laos, and others may have moved back into the highlands of
 South Vietnam.
 Because most
 Khmer Loeu tribes engaged in intervillage warfare before
 being pacified by the French, most are still familiar with
 both offensive and defensive forms of jungle warfare.   Cross-
 bows with poisoned. arrows, rattan lances, kris-like swords,
 knives, and many kinds of improvised personnel booby traps
 are the traditional weapons.   Tribesmen are resourceful and
 adaptable in the jungle and are excellent trackers and in-
 terpreters.   Their stamina is impressive; most can sustain
 cross-country marches over difficult terrain.   Although some
 tribes in adjacent areas of South Vietnam already are pro-
 ficient in the use of light weapons(the AR .15 rifle, sub-
 machine gun., carbine), they are much less proficient in
 using heavier weapons  (111-1 or Browning Automatic Rifle)
 and more sophisticated devices such as mortars, explosives,
 and mines.

 5.   Cham-Malays
 The Chams and Malays are two distinct peoples of Indo-
 nesian stock, but because of their common religion and cul-
 ture, they have settled together and are commonly consider-
 ed a single group.   The Cham-Malays number 80,000 in Cam-
 bodia, slightly more than one percent of the country's
 population.   They are concentrated. principally along the
 Mekong River from Phnom Penh. to Kratie, along the Tonle
 Sap River, and on the coast near Kampot.   Some also are
 found in the Pursat and Battambang areas.
 Although they have adopted many features of Khmer cul-
 ture, the Cham-Malays are regarded by most Cambodians as
 culturally and religiously inferior.   There is, however,
 little apparent discrimination directed against them.   They
 are full-fledged citizens and enjoy all rights, including
 the right of religious freedom.
 The Cham-Malays of present day Cambodia are strict Mus-
 lims and adhere to the Koranic marriage laws which prohibit
 marriage with other groups.   By proscribing intermarriage,
 their communities remain isolated and complete assimilation
 is impossible.  Mosques mark their settlements; Chrui Chang-
 var near Phnom Penh is their spiritual center.
 Under the Sihanouk regime, the Cham-Malays enjoyed spe-
 cial royal favors despite their minority status.   The su-
 preme chief of the Chams was appointed by Prince Sihanouk
 and became a member of the Royal Court.   Recently, a sense
 of ethnic consciousness has developed among the Cham, and
 the resultant feeling of distinctiveness may effect their
 presently amiable relations with the Cambodians.

 The Cham languageeis a mixed tongue of Malayo-Polyne-
 sian stock (the Rhade and Jarai speak languages related to
 Cham -- 75 percent of the Rhade vocabulary, in fact, is
 analogous to Cham).   It is basically Malay in vocabulary,
 interspersed with Sanskrit, Arabic, Vietnamese, Chinese,
 and Khmer words.   While their traditional language is used
 at home, Malay and Arabic are commonly used in reading,
 writing, and for religious purposes.   Khmer is generally
 spoken by Chains, although in a pidgin form.   Cham-Malays
 maintain schools organized for studying both the Koran and
 Malay and Arabic languages.
 The main item of Cham-Malays clothing is a sarong knotted
 at the center of the body.   Women also wear black or dark
 green tunics with tight sleeves, open at the throat.  Men
 wear shirts and ankle-length sarongs.   Flamboyant colors and
 patterns such as red and green stripes are popular.   Women
 are not veiled but do wear scarves on their heads.
 Chams are found in a limited range of occupations.
 Trade and industry employ them in urban areas, and rural
 Chams are farmers, fishermen, cattle breeders, and operators
 of water transport and commerce facilities.   Chams are note-
 worthy in the fields of cattle breeding, trading, butchering,
 and tanning, as they will slaughter cattle which Buddhist
 Khmers will eat but not kill.

 CHAPTER III -- THE ECONOMY
 (January 1970)
 A.   General
 Cambodia is a developing nation of 6.7 million people.
 Average population density is low, but concentrated in the
 rice-producing river valley areas.  Agriculture dominates
 the economy, employing about 85 percent of the people and
 furnishing over a third of total national production.   Gross
 national product (GNP) amounted to $577 million* in 1966,
 or about $100 per person.   Real economic growth has been a
 modest 4 to 5 percent annually.   The minimum needs of the
 population have been satisfied, and starvation is practi-
 cally unknown.
 The economic power of the peasantry is diffused and
 insignificant.   The two most powerful economic factions are
 the government and a small coterie of wealthy merchants,
 most of whom are Chinese.   Economic development has been
 hampered because the interests of the two groups have
 differed.   The government needs the money and talents of the
 merchants to finance, establish, and manage the new indus-
 tries needed for diversification and growth.   The merchants,
 however, have generally preferred the quick return from
 investments in commerce and real-estate.
 The war in South Vietnam has stimulated a substantial
 flow of commodities into and out of Cambodia.   The value
 of the transfers has been approximately balanced.   Saigon
 beer and US PX goods are sold in Cambodia, for example,
 while livestock, vegetables, and other Cambodian products
 are consumed in South Vietnam.   The largest and most per-
 sistent commodity movement has been the purchase by the
 Vietnamese Communists of 10,000 to 20,000 tons of Cambodian
 rice annually for their forces in southern Laos and along
 the Cambodian border with South Vietnam.   The rice sales
 and other cross-border trade appear to have had only a
 minor effect on the Cambodian economy.

 Cambodia's most important natural resource is the
 Mekong and Tonle Sap River system, which provides inland
 transportation, seasonal irrigation, a large supply of
 fish, and a potential for hydroelectric power development.
 A vast expanse of forests provides wood products and the
 only indigenous source of fuel.   Cambodia has few known
 mineral resources, and mining is largely nonexistent at
 present.   There are some limestone deposits in Kampot
 Province, phosphate deposits in Battambang and Kampot
 Provinces, traces of zinc, copper, and flourine in Kompong
 Speu Province, deposits of precious stones in Battambang
 Province, and possibly exploitable bauxite in Mondolkiri.
 Iron and coal deposits are indicated in the Phum Rovieng
 area, but these have not proven to be valuable enough for
 exploitation.  A French firm recently has been granted
 the concession to explore for suspected offshore oil
 deposits.
 C.  Agriculture
 Cambodian agriculture remains largely primitive,
 employing traditional techniques, crude implements, and

 the labor of humans and animals to produce little more than
 subsistence crops from small farms of less than 2 hectares.
 The main "wet season" rice crop is planted in July and
 August and harvested from November to January.   Output is
 largely dependent on the amount and timing of the monsoon
 rains, and farmers often suffer severe losses from adverse
 weather.   The benefits of irrigation and flood control are
 acknowledged, but only about 5 percent of the cultivated
 acreage has been irrigated.   The principal constraints on
 water control projects have been their high cost and long
 construction period.   One major project under way, however,
 is the Prek Thnot Dam.   This $27-million dam, under the
 joint sponsorship of the Cambodian government and the
 Mekong Committee, is scheduled for completion in 1973 and
 initially will provide 18,000 kilowatts  (kw) of electricity
 and irrigation for over 5,000 hectares of land.

 Rice is Cambodia's principal food, its most valuable
 export, and its most important crop, occupying about 85
 percent of the cultivated area, but Cambodian rice yields
 are among the lowest in the world, averaging only about
 1 metric ton* per hectare.   Production of paddy (unhusked
 rice) varied between 2 and 3.25 million tons a year in the
 1960's; weather was a key factor in the variations of
 output.   The 1967/68 crop was a record high, but drought
 reduced the 1968/69 crop to 2.5 million tons of paddy.
 Preliminary indications point to a record 1968/70 crop.
 Figure 3.   Rat-proof rice storage bank.
 Although Cambodia approaches a one-crop economy, it
 raises many other crops on a smaller scale.   Several, such
 as rubber, corn, and pepper, are grown largely for export.
 Fruits, vegetables, oil seeds, and textile fibers are
 grown principally for internal consumption.   Cambodia is
 largely self-sufficient in food production but imports
 wheat, flour, and dairy products.
 All tons are metric.

 D.   Industry
 The Cambodian government has advanced a program of
 industrialization only in the last two decades.   The
 handicaps to this program are immense:   Cambodia has few
 raw materials for exploitation, a small market, a poorly
 developed infrastructure, no money or security markets,
 limited investment capital, an unskilled work force, and
 a sluggish bureaucracy.   Most of the more than 3,700
 industrial units are little more than small shops pro-
 ducing a variety of goods for local consumption.   The
 government has been responsible for the construction and
 operation of the few relatively large, modern manufac-
 turing plants because it has been the only entity capable
 of undertaking the large investment and, even so, has
 relied on foreign assistance to share the financing.
 Products of these larger plants include cement, plywood,
 textiles, fertilizers, paper, jute bags, glassware,
 petroleum products, and alcoholic beverages.   The pace
 of industrialization has been increasing, with many of
 Cambodia's major plants being completed in the last three
 years, but Cambodia remains dependent on imports for most
 consumer goods and all but simple manufactured products.

 generators.   Even Kompong Som, the proposed site for
 much of Cambodia's future industry, does not yet have a
 power system adequate to supply existing needs.
 E.   Fishing and Forestry
 Fish is the Cambodian's main source of animal protein,
 and subsistence fishing is part of almost every farmer's
 activity.   Most commercial fishing is done by native
 Vietnamese in the Tonle Sap area, but there is also some
 ocean fishing.  A few small facilities to can fish have
 been built and more are planned, but fishing will probably
 remain a minor industry.
 Figure 7.   Fishing village (Kompong Kleang)
 More than 70 percent of Cambodia's land area is forested,
 consisting mainly of tropical broadleaf species.   Over
 15,000 square miles of forest have been set aside as
 reserves, and commercial exploitation of the remainder is
 under government control.   The production of charcoal, the

 principal native fuel, is a major industry.   Logging opera-
 tions have been expanding and exports of rough timber and
 sawed wood have been growing, stimulating Cambodian hopes
 that wood products will become an important foreign exchange
 earner.
 F.   Employment and Labor
 Since the populace is largely rural and engaged in
 subsistence agriculture, only a small portion of the popula-
 tion regularly works for somebody else.   The weather cycle
 creates seasonal unemployment for part of the farm popula-
 tion, some of whom work at menial jobs in the off season.
 The small urban work force lacks productive skills and is
 not wage-oriented, but neither is it troubled with widespread
 unemployment.   Unions are few, and there is little incentive
 for labor organizations because management tends toward
 paternalism and there are few labor disputes.   Although
 unemployment is not widespread, the number of youths educated
 in recent years exceeds the economy's capacity to employ them
 in jobs they will accept.   They tend to remain unemployed
 rather than work in agriculture or "blue-collar" occupations.
 G.   Finance and Investment
 The Cambodian budget for 1969 envisaged expenditures of
 7,565 million riels, an increase of 7 percent over 1968, but
 actual expenditures were slightly over 8,000 million riels.
 Defense, general administration, and economic development
 are allocated roughly equal thirds of the budget.   Customs
 duties, income taxes, and business taxes provide two-thirds
 of budget receipts.   Constantly increasing expenditures and
 a reliance on revenue sources dependent on the fate of the
 rice harvest result in chronic deficits, but they are usually
 small and/or easily financed.
 Cambodia is undergoing moderate economic growth with
 relative financial stability.   Inflation has been controlled
 --averaging about 3 percent a year--with minimal increases
 in the cost of food* and basic necessities.   There were only
 minor disruptions of the price structure as a result of the
 recent (August 1969) devaluation of the riel.
 *  Except for a few months of 1969 when the rice market
 manipulations of profiteers wrought drastic price increases.

 Banking, foreign trade, and certain production mono-
 polies have been nationalized since 1963.   Measures enacted
 in early 1970 brought a very limited denationalization in
 these areas, but developmental investment in Cambodia con-
 tinues, by necessity, to remain in the hands of the govern-
 ment.                     Lack of a money market, an underdeveloped infrastruc-
 ture, and a climate of uncertainty created by the nearby
 Vietnam war dampen private incentive for investment in
 Cambodia vis-a-vis alternative areas.
 H.   International Economic Relations
 Cambodia must rely heavily on imports to supply not only
 most manufactured goods but also the inputs for industrial
 development.   The country is completely dependent on imports
 for crude petroleum, iron and steel products, and machinery.
 France remains the leading supplier, but China, Japan,
 Malaysia, and Singapore are other major sources.   The value
 of imported commodities averages about 3.5 billion riels
 annually, about 600 million riels more than exports.

 SECRET/NOFORN
 Almost 80 percent of the value of Cambodia's exports
 is derived from rice, rubber, and corn, all highly
 susceptible to the vagaries of the weather and world
 markets.   There is a continuing effort to develop tourism
 and exports of fish and wood products as additional foreign
 exchange earners.   Cambodia's major export markets include
 South Vietnam, Senegal, Hong Kong, China, and France.
 South Vietnam was the leading purchaser of Cambodian pro-
 ducts in both 1968 and 1969.
 Although foreign aid is needed for increasing the rate
 of economic development, Cambodia has been cautious about
 accepting aid.   The government generally has succeeded in
 obtaining grants instead of loans lest the economy become
 burdened with heavy repayment obligations.   During 1956-69,
 Cambodia received a total of 4.7 billion riels of economic
 credits and grants from Communist sources, two-thirds of
 which came from Communist China.   Drawings on Free World
 economic aid during 1965-68 totaled 2.2 billion riels, of
 which 50 percent came from France and 40 percent from
 Japan.  Most of Cambodia's major industrial plants were
 partially financed by France or the Communist countries.
 I.      American Business Presence
 Cambodia's lack of profitable investment opportunities
 has discouraged active participation by American firms,
 and the Cambodian political climate has emphasized the
 need for caution from both sides.   Currently, the American
 commercial presence in Cambodia apparently is limited to a
 dozen or so semipermanent representatives of various sales
 and banking interests and some participation in petroleum
 marketing.

 CHAPTER V - TRANSPORTATION
 (June 1970)
 A.    Introduction
 Cambodian transportation facilities are underdeveloped,
 unevenly distributed, inadequately maintained, and of lim-
 ited capacity.   They have been able, however, to satisfy
 most of the modest requirements of the country's predomi-
 nantly agricultural economy and to facilitate a signifi-
 cant movement of supplies to Vietnamese Communist forces
 in the Cambodian-South Vietnamese border area.   In recent
 years, roads have surpassed inland waterways as the prin-
 cipal means of moving cargo and passengers.  Waterways
 remain an integral part of the transportation system even
 though rapid silting has limited the navigability of many
 of them.   Railroads rank third in significance; opening
 of the line between Phnom Penh and the port of Kompong
 Som (Sihanoukville) in late 1969 reversed their decline
 of the recent past.   Domestic shipping and civil air fa-
 cilities are limited; most maritime and air commerce is
 handled by foreign vessels and aircraft.
 Existing transportation facilities and equipment are
 in fair condition, at best.   Surfaced roads are badly pot-
 holed and those that are unsurfaced are unusable much of
 the year; railroad equipment is largely antiquated; water-
 ways are hampered by heavy silting; port capacities are
 limited; and the inventory of aircraft on the one domestic
 airline is low.   Thus, despite an improvement program, the
 capability of the transport system to handle increased
 traffic will be modest for some time to come.
 railroads and, to a lesser extent,
 the airfields remain relatively unaffected by the country's
 seasonally adverse weather.   During exceptionally heavy
 rains, even sections of railroad may be flooded and
 traffic disrupted for short periods, and at such times
 unpaved landing strips also may be rendered temporarily
 unserviceable.   Rainy weather has a particularly pro-
 nounced disrupting effect on road traffic, especially

 along extensive stretches of secondary roads, which may
 become impassable because of mud or, in the mountains,
 landslides.  Lowland sections of hard-surfaced roads,
 although occasionally in disrepair, normally are traf-
 ficable the year round.                              Diminished stream flow during
 the dry season severely limits navigability on waterways.
 B.  Roads and Trails
 Cambodia's nearly 3,200 miles of road could not
 accommodate substantial increases in commercial or
 military traffic.  The network, originally designed by
 the French during their colonial reign to link the
 producing hinterlands of Laos and Cambodia with the
 port of Saigon, reflects that function and does not
 now adequately serve the country as a whole.  While
 connecting major population centers in the south-
 central and southeastern parts of Cambodia and linking
 the provincial capitals in outlying areas with Phnom
 Penh, it does not effectively tap the sparsely populated
 northern plains or the mountainous fringes of the north-
 east and southwest, where extensive tracts are roadless.
 Nevertheless, overall road density of the network is
 about 0.045 miles per square mile, somewhat greater than
 in neighboring Laos and Thailand.
 The importance of road transport has increased
 significantly in the past 10 years.  This change in
 status is related directly to the development of the
 port of Kompong Som and the shift of Cambodia's foreign
 trade from the Saigon-oriented Mekong waterway system
 to land transport routes leading to Kompong Som.   The
 Khmer-American Friendship Highway (Route 4), built
 with US aid and completed in 1959, carried all exports
 and imports between Phnom Penh and Kompong Som until
 the rail line between these points was opened in 1969.
 (Heavy traffic has resumed in recent months because of
 disruption of rail traffic on the Phnom Penh - Kompong
 Som line by Communist forces.)   Even though well en-
 gineered, heavy rains have caused the serious deterioration
 of stretches of this road.  Nonetheless, the Khmer-
 American Friendship Highway is in better condition than
 roads in other parts of the country where traffic is
 slowed by narrow widths, lack of shoulders, poor surfaces,
 sharp curves, poor drainage, and inadequate bridging.

 Figure 1.   Khmer-American Friendship Highway (Rt. 4) between
 Kompong Som and Phnom Penh.
 A total of 1,530 miles of road in Cambodia are bi-
 tuminous surfaced; 675 miles are surfaced with crushed
 stone, gravel, or laterite; 360 miles are improved earth;
 and 615 miles are unimproved earth.   Bituminous roads
 generally are well drained and all-weather, although
 some sections in the lowlands may be subject to flooding
 during the rainy season.  To minimize this danger, major
 lowland roads are constructed on embankments that may
 range up to 20 feet above the surrounding terrain.  Stone,
 gravel, and laterite roads, while more prone to inter-
 ruptions during the wet season than bituminous roads, are
 trafficable most of the year.   Laterite roads tend to be
 dusty during dry weather, and with time they acquire a
 corrugated "washboard" surface; during the rainy season,
 they may become dangerously slippery.  Unimproved earthen
 roads and cart tracks may be jeepable in dry weather;
 but in rainy weather they turn into ribbons of deeply
 rutted mud and become trafficable only by oxcart.  Be-
 cause of generally inadequate base and surface materials,
 all roads deteriorate rapidly, and even the best cannot
 support sustained heavy traffic.  Maintenance is hampered
 by inadequate funds, poor construction materials (most
 must be imported), insufficient maintenance equipment,
 and the lack of skilled labor.

 Major roads range up to 24 feet in width; shoulders
 may be as wide as 10 feet, enough to permit their use
 by animal-drawn vehicles and bicycles.  Secondary roads
 are up to 16 feet wide, with shoulders rarely wide
 enough to permit the passage of any type of vehicle.
 Shoulders along many of these roads, in fact, may be
 totally obliterated by encroaching roadside vegetation.
 Furthermore, the roadways may be etched with deep ruts,
 a result of poor drainage along and away from the road.
 In addition to generally inadequate surfaces and
 widths, traffic on Cambodia's roads is hindered by a
 multitude of streams that must be bridged, ferried, or
 forded.   The road network contains more than 1,800
 bridges that exceed 20 feet in length.

 No bridge spans the Mekong.  Major ferry crossings are
 located at Phum Prek Neak Luong (Route 1) and Kompong Cham
 (Route 7).  Crossings are made by diesel-powered ferries
 with capacities of 40 tons.   Phnom Penh?s control of its
 trans-Mekong territory hinges on its control of these two
 major ferry facilities.  A 40-ton ferry crosses the Tonle
 Sap river near Kompong Luong (Route 6) and a 25-ton ca-
 pacity ferry crosses the Tonle Kong at Stung Treng (Route
 13).  Secondary crossings of the Mekong, as at most other
 stream crossings, are piled by crude rafts with capacities
 under 3 tons, powered by outboard motor or by pole.   Such
 small craft are hampered by strong currents during most
 of the rainy season.   The major crossings are equipped
 with floating loading ramps to facilitate docking at all
 water levels.

 Elsewhere, landing slips are of packed earth.  Fords
 replace bridges at stream crossings of most tracks and some
 secondary roads.  They may be unusable by motor vehicles
 during the rainy season when currents are strong, bottoms
 are soft, and entrances and exits slick with mud.    There
 are no tunnels on the Cambodian road system.

 As of 1969 the inventory of motor vehicles in Cam-
 bodia included 23,552 automobiles, 10,731 trucks and
 busses, and 92,440 motorcycles and motorbikes.  Most
 motor vehicles are in poor condition because of the
 beating they take on the poor roads and the paucity of
 repair facilities.
 Although vehicular traffic is light, countless
 pedicabs and a variety of motorized two-wheeled vehicles
 may jam traffic in Phnom Penh, and slow-moving oxcarts
 and other animal-drawn conveyances may create traffic
 jams on rural roads.   Busses jammed with passengers and
 a wide variety of cargo contribute to traffic problems
 in both city and countryside.

 merly written in both French and Cambodian, now appears
 only in Cambodian.
 Off-road vehicular movement is limited by a number of
 factors.   In lowland areas, roads are usually built on
 embankments formed by evacuating soil from both sides of
 the road and heaping it toward the center several feet
 above surrounding terrain.  Consequently, steep-sided
 borrow pits, 3 to 5 feet deep and several feet wide, ex-
 tend along both sides of such roads.   These borrow pits
 usually contain water, even in the dry season and, unless
 spanned by temporary bridges, bar off-road movement.
 Bypassing road sections that may be washed out during
 the rainy season is a problem because flooded rice pad-
 dies commonly extend up to the borrow pits.  In the dry
 season, off-road vehicular movement in the ricelands is
 possible, but the dikes separating the paddy fields may
 have to be breached; many are too high to be negotiated
 by even a four-wheel-drive vehicle with high center clear-
 ance.
 Most river channels--even in the dry season--can be
 crossed only with difficulty because of the depth of water
 and/or steep banks.   Long detours may be required to find
 a sufficiently shallow ford with a suitable entrance and
 exit.   Steep banks may be soft, and a winch may be essen-
 tial to surmount them.   In the forested areas of the low-
 lands and in the extensive wooded tracts of the mountains,
 vehicular movement for any distance off the road or track
 is usually out of the question.
 In addition to the roads and cart tracks, innumerable
 trails crisscross most of the country.  Most of these
 trails are not likely to be trafficable for significant
 distances by motor vehicles, even under favorable cli-
 matic conditions.  Dikes that separate rice paddies are
 used as footpaths in the lowlands during the wet season,
 and after the crop is harvested and the fields are dry,
 foot traffic forms random patterns across the fields.   In
 the mountains, local trail networks -- unusable by motor
