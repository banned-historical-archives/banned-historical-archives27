 Report by Dr. Paul F. Langer dated 12/12/ ' on Meeting with Kaoru Yasui:
 MEETING WITH A LENIN PEACE PRIZE WINNER
 Introduction
 On November 19, I had an opportunity to listen and talk to Lenin Peace
 Prize Winner, Professor Kaoru Yasui,  Yas:;_i's important role in the inter-
 national peace movement and his close relation to Moscow and Peking may
 justify this brief account of my meeting with him. I have kept my own inter-
 pretations to a minimum leaving the reader to draw his own conclusions.
 . Professor Yasui is presently Dean of the Faculty of Law and professor
 of international law at one of Tokyo's larger private universities, but his
 claim to fame is his .leadcro ip in the Japanese "peace movement" and the
 international position which he has been able to create .for it and for himself.
 Yasui is the founder and chairman of the Japan Council Against A- and H-
 Bombs known in Japan as Gensuikyo.  This organization is one of the most
 important Japanese pressure. groups and certainly the one which most
 directly affects Japan's rearmament policy and the U. S. military position
 in Japan. Gensui  o has been largely responsible for maintaining at a very
 high level the Japanese people's sensitivity to nuclear matters. It has also
 been in the forefront of the left-wing struggle against the presence of
 American military bases on.Japanese soil and against the Security Pact
 with the United States. At present, Gensuilga is especially active in organ-
 izing opposition to the proposed visit of U. S. nuclear-propelled submarines
 and the stationing of F-105D fighter-bombers in Japan.
 Every. year in August, ar;: _-I.nd the date of the Hiroshima bombing,
 Gensuikyo holds a world conference against nuclear weapons.  This confer
 ence (which I attended once as an observer) has increasingly developed
 into an international forum for Communist propaganda and now serves as
 a platform from which .Communist proposals for a nuclear-free zone, for
 the dismantling of U. S. overseas bases, and for support of the national
 liberation struggle can be effectively presented.

 With the development of the Japanese anti-nuclear movement during
 the late 1950's into a major instrument of international Communist policy,
 Yasui's stature in the Communist world. has increased correspondingly.
 He and his family have been the house guests of Khrushchev at the latter's
 summer villa on the Black Sea, and Moscow has conferred on him its
 Lenin Peace Prize. At the same time, however, Yasui for several years
 now has been a frequent and welcome visitor to Peking where he has had
 interviews with Mao and other Chinese Communist leaders.  Last year,
 upon returning from Moscow, Yasui and his daughter were again received
 by Mao Tse-tung.  There is ample evidence that Yasui continues even today
 to enjoy intimate and excellent relations with both Mosco-;w and Peking -- or
 perhaps I should say that both are wooing him.  The conflict between Mao
 and Khrushchev poses not merely a very delicate problem for Yasui
 personally. With the growing bitterness of the Sino-Soviet exchanges and
 open Chinese opposition to the partial nuclear test ban, Yasui as the ? policy-
 Maker of the anti-nuclear movement, is faced with a severe dilemma.
 ori~e sa aect of
 discussion in Japan and abroad.  For a number of reasons, it is unlikely
 that Yasui is an actual Party member, although his speeches and behavior
 clearly support Communist policies.  Yasui makes no secret of the. fact
 that his ideology is, that of Marxist-Leninism.  He told me so himself.
 Background of a Lenin Prize Winner
 Whether Yasui is a Communist constitutes a fav  L   b'
 in pu _ is affairs. Yasui is an excellent speaker,
 The interesting thing is that Yasui once was a fervent nationalist
 who expressed strong sympathy for the German National Socialist movement.
 As a result,. the Allied Occupation authorities purged him after the war as
 an ultranationalist, something for which Yasui (like many other Japanese
 in similar circumstances) has probably never forgiven the United States.
 It seems that these two experiences have had a good deal to do with Yasuijs
 postwar behavior.. There is no doubt that Yasui is suffering of a guilty
 conscience and that he is trying to offset his prewar and wartime records
 through postwar support for the extreme left wing.  By being the most-.
 active proponent of the "peace movement" in Japan Yasui apparently
 believes he can erase the memory of. his nationalist past.
 Yasuits personality has also had something to do with propelling
 him onto the speaker's platform. ? He is not an ivory tower scholar but
 craves involvement    bT

 enamoured with the sound of his own voice.  In Japanese he is, of course,
 very persuasive but he can be an effective orator and debater even in
 English -- a language in which he is na-ich less fluent.  Yasui enjoys being
 the center of attention.  His rather feminine features and appearance
 conceal a very ambitious and dynamic man whom many Japanese observers
 classify as "a dedicated opportunist. "
 I have known. Yasui and his family (i. e., wife and daughter) for some
 time, having met him first several years ago when I attended (in the
 capacity of an ooser. ver) the Gensuikyo world congress in Hiroshima, and
 I have since established some ;r_d of a personal relationship.  Thus, I had
 the opportunity to spend an evening at Yasui's home immediately after the
 Soviet Union resumed its most recent nuclear test series. .In 1961, I also
 met Yasui's daughter in Moscow (where she was then studying Russian liter-
 ature at Moscow University) when both of us attended a, "Japanese evening"
 at Lumumba University. While I am thus in a good position to size up
 Yasui, my desire to maintain an open channel for .communications with the
 ,:apaflese anti-nuclear leader ha prevented me at times from questioning
 him as sharply as I might have wanted to and has forced me occasionally to
 refrain from putting some embarrassing questions to him for fear of
 endangering our relationship.  This consideration also affected my discus
 sions with Yasui on November 19.
 Background of Yasui's Visit to the United States
 This is Yasui's first real visit to the United States. I say "real"
 because Yasui has passed through Anchorage several times on his way to
 or from international peace conferences in the Soviet Union or Europe.
 Two years ago, elements in the American peace movement apparently sug-
 gested that Yasui might wish to come to the United States and present his
 views  It seems that these plans crystallized only this year and that he made
 application for a U. S. visa late in .October, Yasui has been invited or is
 :being sponsored by a rather motley group which includes Linus Pauling (an
 occasional participant in. the Japanese anti-nuclear world conferences) as
 well as Cyrus Eaton and the extreme left wing National Guardian, a weekly
 that is better known in pro-Communist circles abroad than her ein the
 United States.

 According to Yasui, the U. S. En b~a:ssy and especially Ambassador
 Reisohauer strenuously and consistently opposed Yasui's visit to the
 United States but the Department of State eventually decided to grant a
 visa as a result of the efforts made on 'behalf of Yasui by members of
 Congress and other "friends. " At least this is Yasui's version.  The
 U. S, visa was apparently issued only on the eve of Yasui's scheduled
 departure from Tokyo, November 14.
 Yasui planned to spend about twelve days in the United States before
 proceeding to a meeting of the World Peace Council in Warsaw (which has
 since taken place).  He expected to visit ten U. S. cities, make thirty
 speeches, and meet with a number of well-known figures, including
 UN Secretary U Thant.  Yasui expressed the hope of returning to the
 United States in the near future for a longer stay.
 The following account reflects the gist of Professor Yasui's remarks
 addressed in English to a group of American and Japanese students at
 UCLA; of a brief personal conversation Yasui had with me after the meetu
 ing; and of a twenty-minute discussion at the UCLA student cafeteria
 where I and some five or six Japanese students and professors conversed
 with Yasui in Japanese.  For convenience's sake, I have arranged the sub-
 stance of Yasui's remarks under topical headings.
 YASUI'S VIEW- OF THE SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT'
 Like most Japanese left-wingers, Yasui is greatly pained by the
 conflict between Moscow and Peking.  Not only does this conflict raise
 ideological: questions for him, but it plunges the Japanese peace movement
 of which he is the leader into confusion.
 This was illustrated at the anti-nuclear world congress in Hiroshirri-
 in August.of this year when the Chinese representative used this forum to
 attack violently the Soviets and their position on. the nuclear test ban and the
 Soviet delegates and their Japanese Socialist allies responded more or less
 in lend. The world conference was turned into a battleground between the
 Moscow and Peking representatives, as well as between the Japanese
 Cormunists who generally incline toward adoption of the Peking line, and
 the Japanese Socialists who. are reluctant to alienate the Chinese, but tend
 to ._.ppart Moscow on the test ban and on peaceful co-existence, The result
 has been that despite Yasui's frantic efforts to cover up these differences,
 mc~' of the Socialists walked out of the world congress and left the Japanese

 on him.
 that is, the character of the leadersh'p, etc. , are of real importance. In
 response to my questions, Yasui repeatedly remarked that he "fully under--
 stood" the Chinese reasons for their policies and statements, but carefully
 refrained from explicitly endorsing t:em.  Even so, it was obvious that,
 as in the case of most Japanese, at least Yasuits emotional sympathies lie
 with the Chinese.  On the other hand, he is aware of the fact that the
 Soviet Union commands great power on the international scene, that
 "peaceful co-existence" is a potent slogan in Japan and that he. personally
 has politically profited from the honors which the Soviet Union has heaped
 Yasuits replies to some of my questions about Sino-Soviet relations
 together with what is known of his activities in Japan suggest that he has
 made strenuous efforts in Tokyo, Moscow, and Peking to reconcile the two
 contending Communist viewpoints, not only insofar as they affect the
 policies of the Japanese anti-nuclear forces but also in their impact on the
 unity of the Communist-sponsored international peace m.overnent.
 Yasui stated that last year when talking to Mao Tse-tung, he could
 sense the seriousness of the conflict between Mao and Khrushchev.  He
 expressed the view that this conflict has three principal reasons: differences
 bet~.;een Chinese and Soviets with regard to the interpretation of Marxism-
 Leninism; concrete problems standinj between the two Communist powers;
 and a clash of personalities.
 Yasui feels that the personality aspect of the Sino-Soviet conflict
 has become more pronounced recently., Although a convinced Marxist, he
 stated that even in relations between Socialist countries the personal factor,
 Sino-Soviet relationship, the gist of his reply was that relations between.
 the two Communist power centers (power centers is my term) might improve
 When I sought Yasuits reaction to the question of the future of the
 Chinese policy, Yasui replied that he thought there could very well be some
 but that such improvement would take considerable time. He did not think
 that the conflict could disappear in the immediate or even the near future,
 In response to my question as to whether a change in the Chinese leadership
 after the. death of Mao. Tse-tung might bring about. some adjustment in
 adjustments, but he doubted that these would be very drastic.

 CHINESE FORi IGN AND NUCLE.? R POLICIES
 In response to my and several other. persons' questions, Yasui
 addressed himself from time to time to the issue of Chinese foreign policy
 and Chinese intentions.
 Yasui asserted- as one might expect, that Communist China has a
 1. gitim_,ate ri crht to be a member of the United Nations and that the Peking
 .regime quite rightly refused to enter the United. Nations as a fa ror.  He
 stated on several occasions that the Chinese were not necessarily keen on
 becoming a member of the United Nations because "there were still a
 number of concrete and practical problems" that would have to be resolved
 before Peking could consider membership. While he avoided being more
 s:eciuic, it was obvious that what he referred to was the Taiwan problem
 and the presence of the rival Chinese Nationalist regime in the United
 i-.a.tions.  It was my impression that Yasui's statement reflected what he
 had been told in Peking by the Chinese Communist leaders.
 A second point Yasui made concerned the Chinese Communist posi-
 tion on the use of force.  He denied that the Peking regime had ever advo--
 cated aggressive action, denied that the Peking regime had contemplated
 the use of force even with regard to the Taiwan problem, and defended the
 Peking regime in its handling of the Indian border issue.  He implied that
 anyone who took the trouble.of studying; the facts would find that Pekingts
 a
 ti
 n
 c
 o
 s toward India had been fully justified.
 Interesting was Yasui's answer to niy question regarding his view of
 the Communist Chinese position on the nuclear test ban treaty.  Here he
 obviously found himself confronted with a dilemma.  On one hand Yasui
 leads a movement that has been consistently pressing for a nuclear test
 ban.  On the other hand, strong opposition to the Chinese stand would
 alienate the extreme leftist and Communist elements, i. e., the activists
 in the Japanese peace movement and deprive Gensuuil o and Yasui of

 e
 down their guard and consider the battle largely won. This, he said, was
 a real danger and the Chinese had clearly-recognized it. The nuclear test
 ban treaty, he stated, could only be considered a very first step.  It must
 .be followed by other steps leading to complete and total disarmament.

 Such essential measures included the destruction of nuclear weapons and.
 the dismantling of (American) overseas bases. Then, turning to an
 interpretation of Chinese behavior, 5Ya sui asserted that the Chinese posies
 tion was "essentially one of sounding a strong warning against the dangers
 of misinterpreting the implications of the treaty. " The Chinese were thus,
 according to Yasui, merely calling, on the forces of peace to maintain
 extreme vigilance. In this way Y"asui justified the Chinese position
 although he admitted that the language in which the Chinese couch their
 ?,:arning" to the peace fighters might be a bit violent.  Or the whole
 and here he reflected the attitude of the Japanese left wi.ncr -- Yasui
 attempted to minimize Sino-Soviet differences on the nuclear issue,
 YA SUf.' S VIEW OF THE UNITED S T`ATES
 In a subtle but :rather effective way Yasui painted an image of the
 United States as an imperialist power where the grovaxning ""forces of peace"
 were struggling hard to influence domestic and foreign policy.
 successfully made their influence felt.  "The forces of peace had even-
 tually won out" and at the last moment he, Yasui, had been granted a
 visa so that he, the peace fighter, was now in the United States, able to
 tell the American people the truth about the japanese peace movement and
 enjoying his first opportunity. to assess personally    growing. strength
 of the "forces of peace" in the United States.
 the U. S. ambassador in Tokyo had strongly opposed the granting of such
 a visa as not being in the U, S. interest, because his (Yasui's) American
 friends in the peace movement and some members of Congress had
 Thus on one hand, Yasui frequently accused United States policy,
 for instance, by showing the picture of a.horribly-deformed child born in
 atom-bombed Hiroshima and by asserting that U. S. nuclear testing at
 .Bikini violated all international norms and la=qrs. On the other hand,
 Yasui asserted that he had obtained his American visa despite the fact that
 OBJECTIVES OF THE TAPANESE, AND INTERNATIONAL PE ACE MOVEM:ENTS
 In presenting his views on the present state of the Tapanese and inter-
 national peace movements, Yasui made ten major points. None of these is
 new or shows any striking departure from earlier Communist pronounce-
 meats on the problem of war and peace, but Yasui's statements are inter-
 esting in that they illustrate how effectively the peace movement can be used
 for the purpose of undermining the bases of U. S. and free world foreign
 and military policies.

 The ten major points Yasui made were the following:
 (1) The peace movement's aim in Japan, as elsewher e,
 is to achieve general and complete disarmament under effective inter-
 national control -b which he failed to define.  (In recent years the term
 "effective international control" has been fully integrated into the Commun-
 ist peace propaganda.) Yasui draws from this the conclusion that the
 Japanese peace movement must defend to the last Japans s so-called peace
 constitution, io e., the present constitution which forbids the use of force
 in the settlement of international conflicts. This spells, of course,
 opposition to any revision of the constitution which would remove the
 restrictions preventing Japan from establishing regular armed.force,s.
 (2) The peace movement welcomes the partial nuclear test
 ban treaty as a first step toward victory of the movement, but it would be
 dangerous to overestimate the significance of the treaty and to relax the
 people's vigilance. This formula neatly combines support for Moscow's
 and for Peking's views of the test ban treaty.  Yasui stated that while the
 peace fighter's aim must, of course, be a speedy agreement on the prohibi-
 tion of production, stockpiling, use and spread of nuclear weapons, the
 immediate objective is to oppose (American) underground testing, which
 remains legal under the present treaty arrangements.  He pointed to another
 ."flaw" in the present arrangement, viz., Article IV which permits a with--
 drawal from the test ban treaty and to the fact that France has refused to
 sign and even announced that it will proceed to test nuclear weapons.
 France was singled out for attack, but China remained unmentioned..
 Yasui also referred to a long open letter he had written to Chairman
 Khrushchev and to President Kennedy stressing the need for.an agreement
 on the total prohibition of nuclear weapons.  He stated that Khruschev had
 honored him with a 7, 000-word reply, but "unfortunately the American
 ambassador in Tokyo had refused to pass on his (Yasui's) letter to the
 President of the United States. " He strongly implied that the "ruling
 circles" in the United States were not interested in discussing seriously,
 a complete ban . on nuclear weapons.
 (3) Yasui stressed that nowadays no military alliance can
 assure the security of a nation, and that, on the contrary, such alliances
 endanger peace.  From this flowed the demand for the dissolution of mili-
 tary alliances and for the abrogation of the American-Japanese security
 pact,

 (4) The peace movement urges the closing down of all foreign
 military bases since '"such a measure would help to relax international
 tensions and reduce the dangers of war. " Yasui, boasting of his expertise
 in the field of international law. asserted that the existence of (American)
 military bases on foreign soil infringes on the sovereignties of the
 countries involved and that the Ti. . S. military presence in Japan constitutes
 a particularly clear-cut violation of international law.  Ile professed to be
 convinced that the very existence of U. S. bases on Japanese soil is endanger-
 ing the survival of the Japanese people who strongly object to the U. S. use
 of Japan as a "front .line position in the American nuclear war strategy.
 (5) Yasui called for opposition to any measure that
 "encourages the development of conditions leading to nuclear war.-" Under
 this innocuous heading he elaborated as follo is: Professor Bernal of. the
 World Peace Council recently expressed opposition to the use of the Polaris
 .submarine as a "mere transfer of nuclear weapons from land to sea.
 Yasui fully agrees with him and opposes also the introduction into Japan of
 the (dual capable) F-405D fighter-bombers by.the United States as a
 measure "enhancing the possibility of nuclear war. " Yasui and his peace
 movement are therefore seeking to develop a strong Japanese mass move-
 ment against such (American) policies while lending maximum support to
 similar movements 'directed against U. S. war policies elsewhere in the
 world.
 resolution regarding an African nuclear-free zone is, of course,
 deserving of full support.
 (7) The peace movement desires the strengthening of the
 United Nations to enable this organization to assure international security
 and prevent nuclear war in the Far East.  This statement turned out to
 be an introduction to Yasuif s renewed demand for the admission of
 Communist- China to its "rightful place" in the United Nations as a measure
 aimed at relaxing international tensions. Yasui went on from here to
 recommend the conclusion of a regional security pact between Japan, the
 United States, the Soviet Union and, of course, Communist China.

 wants nuclear weapons and that now also Japan is in danger of becoming a
 "jumping-off place" for imperialism. The international peace movement,
 he argues, must therefore work strenuously for the establishment of

 (8) Yasui expressed solidarity with the "national independ-
 ence movements against colonialism and racial discrimination. rr   Colonial-
 iani and racial discrimination, he stated, are encouraging conditions for
 n--:clear war. This in turn led to a strong attack against "a UN trustee-
 snap system that serves as camouflage for (American) colonialism0
 ?asui elaborated by stating that Cidnavwa falls into this category and must

 (9) An effort must be made to redirect the economy from
 a. ear-oriented one.to a peace-oriented one, i. e. , Yasui urged the reduce
 Lion of military budgets and so on (and opposition to any increase in the
 modest Japanese defense budget).
 (10) The Japanese movement for aid to the A-bomb victims
 c= 11iroshima and Nagasaki must, be expanded into an international one.
 Yaqui expressed the hope that the United States would give "warm and full
 cooperation and extend support'and. succor to the victims of the tragic
 e tints in Japan. " He stated that such a movement could be an important
 factor in the struggle against accidental and "planned creation of new
 A-bomb victims" (and, no doubt, would prove a most effective instrument
 of anti-American propaganda).
 Yasui's presentation of the program of the. Japanese peace movement
 constituted from a propagandistic point of view a very able performance.
 He appeared to his American audience in the light of a peace fighter free
 of political ties, of a man who was merely defending the cause of humanity
 and who appealed to the conscience of Christians everywhere.  His often
 emotion-charged and eloquent argumentation presented Communist
 objectives in a way as to make them understandable, or rather palatable,
 to an American non-Communist audience while carefully avoiding the
 impression of promoting Communist policies.
 Yasui stated on several occasions that the Japanese .people are
 watching the U. S. peace movement with much sympathy and concern, that
 they realize how great are the obstacles in the path of the American move-
 rnent (implying that in an "imperialist" country, the struggle of the fighter
 for peace is, by necessity, a difficult one).  He praised the Women's Strike
 for Peace which, "despite accusations of Communist infiltration leveled
 ainst it by the Un-American Activities Committee, " had persisted in the

 defense of peace, and finally, he linked up his praise of the American
 peace movement with a strong endorsement for the recent Negro integra-
 tion. march. in Washington.    Lenin Peace Prize Winner Yasui somehow had
 succeeded in !in'.dng- the cause of peace with the Communist position on
 disarmament, with accusations against the United States for its treatment
 of minority u scups, . and with Communist attacks against U. S. military
 alliances and bases overseas, U. S. land- and sea-based nuclear weapons,
 U. S. opposition to China's admission to the United Nations, and U. S.
 insistence on continued underground testing.
