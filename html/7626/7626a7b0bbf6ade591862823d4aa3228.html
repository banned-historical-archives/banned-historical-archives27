SAIGON (AP)?Premier Nguyen Cao Ky who has with-
drawn from South Vietnam's presidential race told his coun-
trymen today everyone must make sacrifices necessary .to 
unify the nation. 
Ky who agreed yesterday to run fora' the vice-presidency 
declared in a speech rnark- ? 
ing the closing of an election 
seminar: 
"If necessary, we must 
make sacrifices in order to 
realize unity. I feel I have 
lived un to those standards 
and feel qualified to ask you 
to live up to the same spirit. 
"We must also prove the 
prestige of the armed forces. 
The armed forces can only 
carry out its mission if it is 
united. If we can sacrifice 
our very life, we can do any-
thing else including the renun-
ciation of titles. I would like 
you to have this attitude in 
the elections." 
Ky announced yesterday he 
Would be the No. 2 man on a 
ticket headed by Chief of 
State Nguyen Van Thieu, 
forming a purely military 
ticket that appears a likely 
winner. 
Ky made the surprise de-
1.T,L,111. 
cision under pressure from 
the ruling Armed Forces 
Council which rallied behind 
Thieu when he entered the 
presidential race June 14. 
IT WAS APPARENT that 
Ky had lost so much' support 
among the generals on the 
council that he was forced to 
take a back seat to Thieu. It 
is unlikely that Ky would 
have accepted second place 
if he thought he had the pow-
er to make any other deci-
sion. 
Ky, dressed in a dark 
gray business suit, was greet-
ed by a Vietnamese honor 
guard as arrived at Dien 
Hong Palace for a brief ad-
dress to province chiefs from 
all over the country about 
the election. 
He declined to answer any

crowded around him as he 
came out of the palace. Thieu 
was -not present. 
"THE PURPOSE of the war 
cabinet is to build and per-
fect democracy in Vietnam. 
Only with this constitutional 
unity can we add to the pres-
tige of the people On an in-
ternational stage and defeat 
the Communists, Ky told the 
province chiefs. 
"Plan an impartial, fair 
election that serves only the 
interest of the nation. I call 
this the spirit of service, the 
spirit of the fighter. If we 
have this spirit, there is no 
obstacle that cannot be over-

By ROSS YOCKEY 
A special investigator 
for Dist. Atty. Jim Gar-
rison charged today that 
the Central Intelligence 
Agency has concealed at 
least 51 official docu-
ments vital to an investi-
gation of President John 
F. Kennedy's assassina-
tion. 
Torn Bethel], assigned by 
Garrison to research the Na-
tional Archives in Washing-
ton, D. C.. told the States-
Item that from the list of con-
cealed information it is ap-
parent- that the CIA knew "a 
great deal" about Lee Harvey 
Oswald before the assassina-
tion. 
Warren Commission 
concluded flip t Oswald acted 
alone in killing the president, 
but Garrison contends that 
there was a conspiracy, 
hatched in aw Orleans, of 
which Oswald was a part. 
, "THERE ARE 1,555 Com-
mission Documents listed in 
the archives," Bethel! said. 
"Of these, only about 1,200 
are unclassified and avail-
able to the public." 
Bethell is a London school-, 
teacher who came to New Or-
leans earlier this year to 
study the city's traditional 
jazz. He became intrigued 
with Garrison's investigation, 
said Bethell, and asked the 
district attorney if he could 
assist in the probe. 
Garrison signed him on and 
sent him to the archives. 
Bethell returned last week 
after spending more than a 
month in the nation's capital 
and compiled his notes. To 
thy he showed one of his 
memoranda to the States-
Item. 
/N THE MEMORANDUM, 
Bethel! lists 29 commission 
documents which he selected 
as being of special interest 
to Garrison. He said he chose 
them from a total list of 51 
classified files on the assas-
sination. 
Among the most significant 
of these, Bethell said, were 
documents whose titles indi-
cated that the CIA had ex-
tensive information on Oswald 
before the assassination, that 
Oswald may have had access 
to secret U=2 aircraft files, 
that the CIA knew more about 
Jack Ruby (the man who shot 
Oswald) than it revealed pub-
licly, and that the CIA failed 
to turn over some information 
to the Warren Commission. 
-11 In support of his allegation 
- that the CIA knew about Os-
wald prior to the assassina-
tion, which occurred in Dal-
las on Nov, 22, 1963, Bethell 
cited a paragraph from one 
of the unclassified files. 
By LYNNE WOGAN he said softly, "They're so 
"Javnie is with God now. beautiful." 
I snow he has taken her, 
but Jayne Mansfield is a leg-
end and as long as there is 
an earth, her name will be 
remembered here." 
These were the words of 
Mickey Hargitay as he, sat in 
a ctik 
? He pulled a letter from his 
pocket. It was dated April 5, 
1967, and he said he'd car-
ried it with him ever since 
he received it. She was in 
London and he was in Rome.

thought of herself. He said 
that if she hadn't, the chil-
dren might have been killed 
in the accident here Thurs-
day and her own life might 
have been spared.

Neither the New China

copies of a telegraphic mes-
sage, dated Oct. 10, 1963, from 
the Central Intelligence Agen-
cy, which contained informa-
tion pertaiMng to his current 
activities." 
Said Bethell in his report: 
"THE CONTENTS OF THIS 
message apparently did not 
reach the Warren Commis-
sion because there are no 
commission documents origi-
nating from the CIA dated 
prior to the assassination, so 
we cannot request this infor-
mation by document number, 
but it would interesting to 
know what the CIA knew 
about Oswald six weeks be-
fore the assassination." 
Bethell said that some of 
the classified documents are 
labeled "S" for "Secret" and 
"TS" for "Top Secret," but 
he does not know what the 
difference might be. 
Apparently, he added, there 
is some degree of secrecy to 
all the classified documents, 
even the unlabeled ones, since 
they all remain unavailable 
to the public. 
HERE IS BETHEL'S LIST 
of the titles of 29 classified 
commission documents from 
the CIA, all of which he 
feels may have some bear-
ing on Garrison's investiga-
tion (Each is preceded by its 
commission document num-
ber.): 
CD 931-Oswald's access to 
information about the "G-2. 
(S) 
CD 1054 - Information on 
Jack Ruby and associates. (S) 
CD 674-Information given

sion. (S)

wald in USSR. (S) 
CD 680-Appendix to CD

CD 691-Appendix A to CD

CD 818-Revisions of CD

Wald. 
CD 1216-Memo from Helms

CD 935-Role of Cuban In-
telligence Service in process-

CD 1551-Conversations be-

CD 347-Activity of Oswald 
in Mexico City. (S) 
nr, no A A 
'conspiracy. 
Oswald's Mexico City trip 
the summer beforre the as-
sassination has been labeled 
by Garrison as ha ving 
played a key role in the al-
leged plot. The CIA has nev-
er admitted interviewing Os-
wald there. 
Silvia Duran is a Mexican 
woman who worked in the Cu-
ban Embassy in Mexico City. 
She was the first one to whom 
Oswald spoke on his visit to 
the embassy. 
SILVIA DURAN IS QUOT-
ED extensively in the Warren 
report, but apparently some 
part of her testimony has 
been withheld from public 
scrutiny. 
Gilberto Alvaredo, probably 
a Mexican, was not men-
tioned in the 26 volumes, nor 
was Pfs. Eugene D' who 
apparently cleairteu (4) have 
information about a plot. 
The "cropped picture" re-
ferred to in CD 1287 may re-
fer to Commission Exhibit 
237, labeled in the report only 
as "photo of an unidentified 
man." 
Garrison charges the pic-
ture was given to the com-
mission when it asked for a 
picture taken by the CIA of 
Oswald and another man com-
ing out of the Cuban embas-
sy in Mexico City. 
GARRISON SUBPENAED 
the alleged Oswald photo-
graph from Washington be-
cause, he said, the "other 
man" in the picture is vital 
. 
to his investigation. A CIA of- 
ficial replied, however, that 
an intensive search of CIA 
files could reveal no such 
picture. 
The' DeMohrenschildts were 
prominent in Dalls' Russian 
community. They took Os-
wald and his wife under their 
wing when the couple re-
turned to the United States 
from the Soviet Union. Some 
of their testimony is included 
in the Warren Report. 
Nothing has filtered down 
to the public cOncering either 
the Canberra phone calls 'or 
the letter to the Costa Rican 
embassy, both of which could 
have had some effect on the 
commission's o n e - assassin 
conclusion. Neither has there 
been any mention of a spy 
school in Minsk, where Os-
wald spent a good deal of his 
time in Russia.

ter spending long hours dig-
ging through the archives, he 
has divided the commission 
documents into three.classifi-

BETHELL SAID THAT af-
ter spending long hours dig-
ging through the archives, he 
has divided the commission 
documents into three classifi-
cations: Group A?completely 
unclassified; Group B?par-
tially classified, and Group C 
?completely classified. 
About 300 documents are 
still classified, he stated, and 
the remaining are divided 
about equally between the 
completely available and the 
partially hidden. 
Many of the Group B docu-
ments, he said, are hundreds 
of pages long, but some of 
their pages are missing from 
the files. 
One large FBI report he re-
calls in particular is "about 
five inches thick and some 
750 pages long. Thirty-six of 
the pages, though are mis-
sing." 
ONE OF THE )PERSONS 
dealt with extensively in those 
36 pages, Bethell noted, is 
David William Ferrie, the 
now-deceased 'former airline 
pilot, who, according to Gar-
rison, plotted with Ruby, Os-
wald and New Orleans busi-
nessman Clay Shaw to as-
sassinate the president. 
Of those Garrison has. 
named, three are dead. The 
fourth, Shaw, the retired 
manager of the International 
Trade Mart, is awaiting trial 
on the conspiracy charge. 
Garrison himself said he is 
highly interested in the docu-
ments on Bethell's list. 
Asked whether he would at-
tempt to subpena the classi-
fied files, the district attorney present satellites. 
replied, "I can't say yet. 
We'll just have to wait and Darn.--
