 Us Stand in Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CLEMENT J. ZABLOCKI
 OF WISCONSIN
 Recent evens is Vietnam indicate that
 "the war that is not a war" has reached a
 crossroads.  Washington's policy of the past
 4 years, based on the polite fiction that we
 were not fighting a war but merely helping
 the Vietnamese to defeat the Vietcong insur-
 gents within their own territory, has reached
 a point of no return.
 Compromise and consensus-perhaps ap-
 plicable to some of the Nation's great domes-
 tic problems-cannot be guideposts to for-
 eign policy.  There must be a clear-cut and
 courageous decision.  And though in Viet-
 nam we face the hard problem of risking
 much to gain little, the risk must be taken;
 we must fight a war to prevent an irreparable
 defeat.  We must use what it takes to win.
 Our policy should not be "unconditional
 surrender" or unlimited victory.  Our goal of
 victory should be the defeat of Communist
 attempts to conquer South Vietnam and ex-
 tend their control deep into southeast Asia.
 The reasons we must fight for Vietnam
 have little to do with making Saigon safe
 for democracy or freedom.  There has been
 far too much cant on this point, far too much
 effort devoted to trying to establish a polit-
 ically legitimate South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment after our own image.                                                                      Nor does it do
 much good to argue the past, debating
 whether or not we should have become in-
 volved in Vietnam in the first place.  The
 facts are that Communist expansionism in
 Asia has been consistent, related and pro-
 gressive, that the end of the Korean war,
 without a simultaneous settlement in Viet-
 nam, gave Peiping and North Vietnam's Ho
 Chi Minh the opportunity in southeast Asia
 they have so well exploited.
 Belatedly,  but nevertheless clearly, the
 United States became aware of the threat.
 Our commitments to Saigon began in the
 Eisenhower administration and were enor-
 mously amplified after the Kennedy admin-
 istration took power 4 years ago.  Today, we
 are  committed-fully  committed-by  the
 words of Presidents and Cabinet members,
 by the actions of the Government, by the
 deep involvement of U.S. military forces.
 U.S. global prestige and power is intimate-
 ly bound up with the outcome of the Viet-
 namese struggle.  In Vietnam, we are at-
 tempting to formulate an answer to the Com-
 munist strategy of creeping aggression, of
 subversion and insurgency, of what Khrush-
 chev called "wars of national liberation."
 If the might and will of the United States
 cannot evolve a victorious answer to such
 tactics, we are undone; the map of the world
 will gradually become red.  And if we will
 not fight in Vietnam, where-after the series
 of Communist conquests in the past 20 years
 -will we fight?  Where will we draw the line?

 N THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 Mr. ZABLOCKI.  Mr. Speaker, as I
 indicated in earlier remarks on the floor
 of the House, I am inserting in the CON-
 GRESSIONAL RECORD an article by Mr. Han-
 son W. Baldwin,. respected military com-
 mentator, which appeared in the Sunday
 New York Times Magazine for February
 21, 1965.
 In the article, entitled "We Must
 Choose-(1) 'Bug Out,' (2) Negotiate,
 (3) Fight," Mr. Baldwin argues for a
 greater use of American military power
 in Vietnam. He believes we must fight a
 war to prevent an irreparable defeat.
 While I do not agree with Mr. Bald-
 win's observations and. recommendations
 in every instance, it is my belief that he
 has made a distinct contribution to the
 dialog on this issue.
 Among his suggestions which I .believe
 should be implemented are these,
 First, the United States itself must pro-
 vide maximum possible security for our
 installations in South Vietnam. Rather
 than rely on the South Vietnamese as we
 have in the past, we should use U.S.
 armed guards to defend against Vietcong
 attacks on our airplanes, helicopters,
 barracks, and other facilities.
 Second, Mr. Baldwin points out that
 coordination between the various U.S.
 agencies working in Vietnam could be
 further improved. This problem was evi-
 dent to me during my visits to Vietnam,
 the last in October 1963.  Apparently
 there has been some improvement, but
 more could be done to streamline our op-
 erations,
 Further, he suggests that military
 troops in Vietnam be made responsible
 for holding the areas cleared of Vietcong
 guerrillas, a task at present being done
 by internal security forces. This recom-
 mendation.deserves careful attention.
 I do not agree, however, with Mr. Bald-
 win's belief that a commitment of U.S.
 combat troops under United States-
 South Vietnamese joint command is nec-
 essary at this time.
 Rather, I would hope to see greater
 efforts being made to convince our allies
 in Southeast Asia-especially the South
 Koreans, Nationalist Chinese and the
 Filipinos-to send forces into South
 Vietnam to assist in defeating Com-
 munist aggression there.
 WE MUST CHOOPV;  (1)  "BUG OUT,,,  (2)
 NEGOTIAy'E, (3) P IGHT
 (By Hanson W. Baldwin)
 What should we, do-"bug out" or fight?
 Should we be hawkp or doves?  Or is there a
 third choice-negotiations now?
 .quences of a U.S. defeat in Vietnam, a U.S.
 withdrawal, or a negotiated peace likely to
 lead to a Communist takeover, would be
 disastrous in much of Asia.  It would under-
 mine Thailand (already openly threatened by
 Peiping), Laos (even now half conquered by
 communism),   Malaya,       the   Philippines
 (with its growing anti-Americanism), Burma,
 India, Japan, and even Taiwan, Okinawa,
 and Australia.
 For a long time after the politically stale-
 mated end of the Korean war, Peiping was
 successfully depicting the United States to
 the peoples of Asia as a "paper tiger."  The
 defeat of the French-backed heavily by
 American aid-in Indochina enhanced this
 image of a windy, weak-willed, feeble Uncle
 Sam.  That image has since been dispelled
 by V.S. actions in and around the Taiwan
 Straits, during the Cuban missile crisis and,
 recently, by President Johnson's retaliatory
 air attacks upon North Vietnamese objectives.
 ,But the portrait of flabby indecision could
 be easily revived if the United States loses in
 Strategically, South Vietnam is too im-
 portant to be allowed to go by default.
 North Vietnam badly needs the rice of the
 A783
 South.  More imporant, the area is the tra-
 ditional rice bowl of the continent.                                                 Geo-
 graphically,  Vietnam is a long appendix
 pointing toward the rich archipelago of In-
 donesia and abutting strategic sea passages.
 Whoever dominates it will eventually control
 most of the Indonesian archipelago.
 The strategic importance of the area is
 similar to the so-called "rimlands," or mari-
 time nations, of Western Europe which repre-
 sent a powerful bastion against the "heart-
 land" of Soviet Russia.  In Asia, the non-
 Communist strategic position vis-a-vis Red
 China is based upon mainland positions-
 Pakistan, India, southeast Asia, and the is-
 land bastions of the Philippines, Taiwan,
 Okinawa and Japan.  If the "rimlands" of
 Asia fall to communism, the island positions
 will be doomed sooner or later.  Ultimately
 the Communists will challenge us upon what
 is now our unchallenged domain-the oceans.
 In a word, we must remain in southeast
 Asia for our own security needs. South Viet-
 nam is in itself not "vital" in the sense that
 the United States cannot live without it.
 But if lost we would be forced to commence
 the next chapter of the world conflict in re-
 treat, and at a disadvantage.
 Despite the admitted importance of South
 Vietnam to the U.S. global position, the cur-
 rent  breed  of  neoisolationists  and  the
 "doves" who believe we must cut our losses
 and get out advance many arguments against
 deeper involvement and in favor of with-
 drawal.
 Most of the arguments represent the voices
 of defeat and despair, caution and fear.
 "Why not negotiate now?"
 Any negotiations opened now would lead
 from weakness, not strength. If we want to
 negotiate-and not to surrender-we shall
 have to raise our ante considerably.  And
 "meaningful" negotiations are "meaning-
 ful" to the Communists only if they are
 faced with superior power and a position of
 strength.
 We must "arm to parley."  Personally, I
 seriously doubt whether talks can guarantee
 peace in Vietnam and southeast Asia,  as
 some quarters have suggested, by neutraliz-
 ing the area politically and militarily;                                                                                                                                  in
 short, by eliminating the struggle for in-
 fluence between Communists and non-Com-
 munists.  Nevertheless, we need not fear
 negotiations if we speak from strength, by
 really putting up a fight for Vietnam.
 Continuing U.S. air and sea attacks on
 North Vietnam would serve notice on Hanoi,
 Peiping, and Moscow that the United States
 will no longer tolerate "sanctuary warfare."
 They might-hopefully-force Hanoi to the
 conference  table.   Indeed,  such  a  policy
 would appear to be the minimum necessary
 to open any kind of negotiations.   Yet even
 such a program will not "win" the war, in
 the South.
 "If the French couldn't win, how can the
 United States achieve victory?"
 The implication of this argument is two-
 fold: (1) we have donned the colonial mantle
 of the French, and  (2)  our power is no
 greater than that of Paris. Both suggestions
 are absurd.
 As  some of our  diplomats  have       found
 to their discomfort, South Vietnam is dis-
 tinctly an independent country-not, as in
 France's day, part of a colonial empire.  In
 fact, the fear of Chinese Communist colonial-
 ism is probably greater in all of Vietnam,
 and in North Vietnam in particular, than
 the fear of United States "imperialism."  As
 fol' a comparison between the political, eco-
 nomic, and military power of the United
 States and France, there is none.   Particu-
 larly in the air and at sea we can mobilize
 power  completely  unavailable  to   France,
 backed up  by  the  ultimate force     which
 France did not possess-a nuclear arsenal.
 "You can't win a war against guerrillas."
 Not true.  We have dressed up the fight-
 ing in Vietnam with a fancy name-"coun-
 terinsurgency," but some of its basic mill-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX            February 23
 tary elements resemble the kind of war
 Americans have fought successfully many
 times in the past in Nicaragua, Haiti, and
 behind the main fighting fronts during the
 Korean war.  Other anti-Communist guer-
 rilla wars were won in Greece, the Philip-
 pines, and Malaya.  The Portuguese seem to
 have done a pretty good job of stamping out
 the rebellion in Angola.  Guerrillas can be
 defeated, but it takes careful organization,
 special training, and security forces that
 should be from 10 to 30 times larger than
 the guerrillas.  It takes infinite determina-
 tion and patience.
 "Continued fighting or expanded U.S. in-
 volvement will mean higher U.B. casualties
 and greater risks of broadening the war."
 Of course. You cannot win a war without
 spilling blodd.  We must pay the price of
 power.  Risks are unavoidable in any for-
 eign policy worthy of its name.  The ques-
 tion Is not whether there will be risks, but
 the degree of risk.  For against the perils
 of action -must be weighed the perils of in-
 action. Political and military history clearly
 reveal that compromise, hesitancy or ap-
 peasement merely lead to ultimate disaster.
 In Vietnam, the longer we wait, the greater
 the price we shall have to pay for even par-
 tial victory (as we are now discovering), and
 the more restricted our choice of options.
 "We-have no moral right to be in Vietnam,
 or to attack North Vietnam."
 Neither do the Vietcong.  Nor does North
 Vietnam have the right to support the civil
 war in the South.  Our involvement was a
 response to Communist aggression.  Since
 the-beginning, Hanoi has organized, supplied
 and directed the Vietcong Insurgency. We
 were Invited by the South Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment to come to Its aid.  A high moral
 purpose Is an essential element of our foreign
 policy but we can be left with no purpose-
 moral or otherwise-if we are conquered by
 the doctrine that the ends justify the means.
 If we are inhibited from action by Hamlet-
 like Indecision over legalistic concepts of
 International law, we shall lose the world.
 "What's the use of further ;military in-
 volvement,, when the political instability of
 South Vietnam pulls the rug from under our
 feet?"
 Here is one of the more cogent objections
 to greater involvement.  But In the long
 history of Vietnam there have always been
 feudfng sects and factions.  Moreover, the
 French left behind them a people still un-
 equipped for self-government., Yet some-
 how or other the war has gone on, and some-
 what better in some respects recently. Great-
 er U.S. involvement-above all, a tangible
 determination to. win-may well do more for
 Safgon'a``political stability than any amount
 of diplomatic pressures.
 "Isn't the real danger that escalation might
 involve us in a larger war?  Wouldn't the
 Chinese come in?"
 "This is the $64 million question.  It is
 "quite clear that if the United States becomes
 more involved we must be prepared for great-
 er effort by the enemy.  Escalation In some
 form would be not only possible, but likely.
 But we have advantages.  We are fighting,
 as we, did in Korea, on a, peninsula when.
 our superior sea 'and air power can be most
 effective.  North Vietnam's few powerplants
 and Industries are vulnerable to destruction.
 The Gulf of Tonkin is easily blockaded. And
 China itself, with an obsolete air force and
 minimal naval power, could not defend itself
 effectively against a determined air and sea
 attack.
 Nevertheless, an expanded effort by the
 United States in Vietnam may well be an-
 swered by an increased flow of supplies and
 men from North Vietnam, perhaps by an all-
 out attack by the North 'Vietnamese Army,
 and perhaps ultimately by aid from China
 into South Vietnam.  Though the flow could
 be hampered and reduced by air attacks it
 could not be completely halted.  It is quite
 possible that the United States might be=
 come involved in a new kind of Korean war.
 But this would not be hopeless by any means.
 In fact, some well-informed authorities be-
 lieve the United States could win a Korean
 type of war in South Vietnam-Laos against
 the best that the Chinese Communists could
 throw against us.
 "What about the specter of nuclear weap-
 ons?   Wouldn't Russia join  in, even  if
 China didn't have enough A-bombs to do us
 any harm?"
 There is no Certain answer to these ques-
 tions, but a full scale nuclear war Is highly
 unlikely. The United States has scared itself
 to death by its own nuclear propaganda. The
 fear of a nuclear exchange-never probable,
 or even likely-has been the greatest single
 restraint upon a positive and firm U.S. diplo-
 macy since World War U.
 Presidents and public alike have been in-
 hibited by the nightmare of the mushroom
 cloud.  Yet the lessons of the Cuban missile
 crisis should be remembered.  Is it in any
 way probable that the Kremlin would risk for
 Vietnam what it would not risk for Cuba?
 Moscow knows our nuclear power.  Would
 Russia invite its own destruction as a nation
 by invoking the use of nuclear weapons in
 any cause except the defense of its own soil?
 The questions answer themselves.
 We must also remember the risks of delay.
 If there is a danger of nuclear retaliation to-
 day by Peiping, how much greater will it be
 tomorrow when China will have accumulated
 a stockpile of weapons?  Time is restricting
 our options.
 Clearly, then, the stakes in Vietnam are
 large enough to warrant the risks of greater
 U.S. involvement.  Whether or not we raise
 our ante, the enemy will. The Communists
 are implacably determined to triumph, and
 the only factor that can prevent their vic-
 tory is superior power in all its forms.  More
 of the same on our part will no longer serve
 any purpose, save slow defeat. .
 What should we do?  First and foremost,
 we must recognize as a Government and as
 a people that we are fighting a war in Viet-
 nam, not merely advising how to fight one.
 Such a recognition would awaken a greater
 sense of national and military determination,
 inspire  a  Presidential  and  congressional
 enunciation of purpose, and create a more
 streamlined military operation in Vietnam.
 Second, the United States itself must pro-
 vide maximum possible security in Vietnam
 to major U.S. Installations, such as airfields,
 supply depots, and headquarters.  Secretary
 McNamara's statement that it was impossible
 to guard against such attacks as those re-
 cently made by the Vietcong against U.S.
 airfields and barracks is no answer.     Of
 course, 100-percent security is impossible in
 any war; defense against terrorism and sabo-
 tage is especially difficult.  But there is no
 doubt whatsoever that we can provide better
 security to key installations than the South
 Vietnamese, who have been responsible for
 the job in the past.
 We need U.S.  ground tactical units  in
 South Vietnam to defend our installations.
 We need infantry battalions, military police
 companies, Army Engineers, and Navy Sea-
 bees to build aircraft revetments, dugouts,
 and protected barracks.  Yet all this is pure-
 ly defensive; it should reduce U.S. casualties
 but it will not win the war.
 Another essential measure is simplifica-
 tion and streamlining of both the high mili-
 tary command and the "country team
 units,  composed  of representatives from
 various Government agencies, that support
 our aid effort in Vietnam.  We must get
 more Americans and more Vietnamese out
 of the bistros of Saigon and Into the bush.
 The coordination between the military, the
 Central Intelligence Agency, the State De-
 partment, the U.B. Information Agency and
 the Agency for International Development
 is far better than it once was.  But it is still
 far from perfect, in Saigon or in Washington.
 The war has shown, for instance, that South
 Vietnamese-United States teams have been
 able in many instances to carry out the
 military portion  of the "clear and  hold"
 prescription for victory.  But AID-not the
 military-is responsible for police and in-
 ternal security forces in Vietnam, and these
 cadres rarely have been able to hold an area
 once it has been cleared of the Vietcong.
 Perhaps military troops should be charged
 with the "hold," as well as the "clear," part
 of the operations.  Certainly internal polic-
 ing needs a major overhaul.
 A basic change in the prescription for vic-
 tory demands a United States-South Viet-
 namese unified command such as now exists
 in South Korea.
 Continuous and heavy air and sea at-
 tacks against staging areas, supply routes,
 training fields, camps and recuperation cen-
 ters of the Vietcong in North and South
 Vietnam and Laos will be necessary for any
 appreciable diminution in the flow of men
 and supplies to the Communists.  The one-
 shot retaliatory raids have only temporary
 and minimum military importance; viewed
 as political and psychological warnings, they
 are likely to provoke the Vietcong and North
 Vietnam to a redoubled war effort.
 The history of airpower dictates the need
 for unrelenting, massive attacks.  Bombing
 targets in North Vietnam probably would
 have to be broadened to include power-
 plants, bridges, industries, road junctions,
 docks and oil storage facilities.  A naval
 blockade and naval gunfire may well supple-
 ment the air bombardment.  To carry out
 effectively any such program as this, U.S. air
 and naval forces in the Western Pacific
 would require material strengthening.
 Meanwhile, it would take years of effort in-
 side South Vietnam itself to reduce the Viet-
 cong  to  manageable  proportions.  Much
 larger and better led, South Vietnamese
 forces would be necessary.  They would have
 to be supplemented by MS. ground troops-
 perhaps In small numbers at first, but more
 later, particularly if North Vietnamese regu-
 lar forces and Chinese soldiers joined the
 Vietcong.
 How many U.S. soldiers would be needed Is
 uncertain-probably a minimum of three tb
 six divisions (utilized chiefly in battalion or
 brigade-size units), possibly as many as 10
 or 12 divisions.  Including Air Force, Navy,
 and supporting units, perhaps 200,000 to 1
 million Americans would be fighting in Viet-
 nam.
 Obviously, this would mean a Korea-type
 conflict, a major war, no matter what euphe-
 misms would be used.  Nor could we wage it
 in the present "business as usual" economy.
 We would require partial mobilization, vastly
 beefed-up military production. Many weak-
 nesses In our military structure would need
 strengthening.  Even so, we could not an-
 ticipate quick success.  The war would be
 long, nasty, and wearing.
 No one could relish such a prospect as this;
 the stark statistics of war explain the Presi-
 dent's reluctance to embark upon a path that
 has no turning.
 Vietnam is a nasty place to fight.  But
 there are no neat and tidy battlefields in the
 struggle for freedom; there is no good place
 to die.  And it Is far better to fight in Viet-
 nam-on China's doorsteep-than fight some
 years hence in Hawaii, on our own frontiers.

 Justice Felix Frankfurter
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 .,,.._                  OF
 HON. WILLIAM L. HUNGATE
 OF,MISSOURI
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 8, 1965
 Mr. HUNGATE.  Mr. Speaker, a few
 short years ago at the law school in
 Cambridge,  a bust of Justice Felix
 Frankfurter was presented to take its
 place alongside four other great jurists
 of our century: Justices Oliver Wendell
 Holmes, Louis D. Brandeis, Benjamin
 Cardozo, and Learned Hand.  Now Pro-
 fessor Frankfurter, for he remained a
 teacher throughout his judicial tenure,
 has joined those others in answering
 that summons, for which no continu-
 ance can be granted.  Professor. Frank-
 furter will require no extension of time
 to plead.  His life exemplified the creed
 espoused   by  Justice Oliver  Wendell
 Holmes when he spoke to the 50th anni-
 versary of his class in June 1911:
 To see so far as one may, and, to feel the
 great forces  that are behind every detail
 * * * to' hammer out as compact and solid
 a piece of work as one can, to try to make
 it first rate, and to leave it unadvertised.
 All of this Justice Frankfurter has
 done,  The words of his last major opin-
 ion filed in dissent in March 1962, in the
 Tennessee apportionment case sounded
 a warning bell that still rings true
 today:
 The Justice wrote:
 "The  Court today reverses  a  uniform
 course of decision established by a dozen
 cases, including one by which the very claim
 now sustained was unanimously rejected
 only 5 years ago.
 "Such a massive repudiation of the ex-
 perience of our whole past in asserting de-
 structively novel judiciary power demands a
 detailed analysis of the role of this Court in
 our constitutional system.
 "Disregard of inherent limits in the effec-
 tive exercise of the Court's `judicial power'
 not only presages the futility of judicial in-
 tervention in the essentially political con-
 flict of forces. * * * it may well impair the
 Court's position as the ultimate organ of `the
 supreme law of the land' in that vast range
 of legal problems, often strongly entangled
 in popular feeling, on which this Court must
 pronounce.
 "PUBLIC CONFIDENCE
 "The Court's authprity-processed neither
 of the purse nor the sword-ultimately rests
 on sustained public confidence in its moral
 sanction,  Such feeling must be nourished
 by the Court's complete detachment, in fact
 and in appearance, from political entangle-
 ments and by abstention frorp injecting it-
 self                into the clash  of political  forces in
 political settlements."
 The  struggle Justice Frankfurter went
 through in leaving his personal convictions
 behind carte through most sharply in his
 1943 c ssent. in.. the flag salute case.  The
 Court reversed a previous decision and ruled
 .that children of Jehovah's Witnesses could
 not be forced to salute the U.S. flag at school.
 Frankfurter, disagrgeeing, said:
 "One who belongs to the most vilified and
 persecuted minority in history is not likely
 to be insensible to the freedoms guaranteed
 by our Constitution.  Were my purely per-
 sonal attitude relevant I should whole-
 heartedly associate myseit with the general
 libertarian views in the Coirt's opinion, rep-
 resenting as they do the thought and action
 of a lifetime.
 "FEELING AS JUDGE
 ".But as judges we are neither Jew nor
 Gentile, neither Catholic nor agnostic. * * *
 As a member of this Court I am not justi-
 fedin writing my private notions into the
 Constitution, no matter how deeply I may
 cherish them or how mischievous I may deem
 their disregard."
 He was with the majority in ruling that
 congressional committees must make clear
 to witnesses the pertinency of questions; in
 drawing a sharp distinction between sub-
 versive thought and action; and in striking
 down  the  State  Department's  restrictive
 passport regulations as not authorized by
 law.
 Perhaps  his  most  bitter defeat on the
 Court was his last one.  That was the Ten-
 nessee apportionment case where six Justices
 voted to allow lower Federal courts to hear
 the complaints of citizens who think un-
 equal voting, districts dilute their right to
 vote.
 For Justice Frankfurter, the Court's de-
 cision to step into what he called a political
 thicket was tragic.
 The lamps of learning he has lit shall'
 light the paths of countless generations
 yet unborn.
 National Lutheran Council Endorses Pres-
 ident Johnson's Immigration Bill
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JOHN BRADEMAS
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Speaker, under
 -unanimous. consent, I insert in the REC-
 ORD the text of a resolution adopted by
 the National Lutheran Council support-
 ing President Johnson' proposal for re-
 vision of the immigration law.
 Although the Lutheran Church, Mis-
 souri Synod, does not officially partici-
 pate in the National Lutheran Council, it
 wishes to be associated with the sub-
 stance of this resolution.
 The text of the resolution follows:
 RESOLUTION ON IMMIGRATION
 Whereas the National Lutheran Council
 has consistently expressed hope that Congress
 will establish immigration laws, "just to all
 and ministering most truly to the public
 welfare"; and
 Whereas the National Lutheran Council
 has stated its "firm conviction that the exist-
 ing immigration legislation has severe short-
 comings, as a result of which neither tradi-
 tional Christian humanitarianism nor en-
 lightened self-interest are adequately ex-
 hibited," and has expressed hope that Con-
 gress will "seek a just and workable sub-
 stitute  for  the  national  origins  quota
 system"; and
 Whereas the Statement "Immigration Pol-
 icy: Moral Issues. and the National Interest,"
 endorsed by the National Lutheran Council
 at its meeting on February 4, 1960, com-
 mended for study and consideration the fol-
 lowing'flve possible objectives as the basis of
 a revised U.S. immigration law:
 1: To supply `our permanent population
 with a steady proportion 'of newcomers who
 have chosen the United states as their new
 homeland  and  who  can  impart  to  their
 American neighbors an understanding of-the
 cultures, attitudes, and interests of other
 races and peoples of the world.
 2. To  assume the United  States proper
 share of, international responsibility for the
 resettlement of refugees and of other per-
 sons urgently in need of the compassionate
 haven of a new homeland.
 3. To facilitate the reuniting of families.
 4. To facilitate the entry of persons pos-
 sessing  special  skills  or  other  capacities
 needed by the American economy and cul-
 ture.
 5. To admit annually a reasonable number
 of the persons described above on an objec-
 tive basis of selection which, while discrimi-
 nating, will not be discriminatory with re-
 spect to race, national origin, color, or re-
 ligion, testifying thereby to the U.S. recogni-
 tion of the interlocking and mutual interests
 of all nations with regard to the migration
 of people, the interaction of cultures and
 respect of universal human rights; and
 Whereas the proposed legislation submitted
 to Congress by President Johnson on Jan-
 uary 13, 1965, represents substantial progress
 toward the fulfillment of the basic hopes and
 objectives expressed in prior National Lu-
 theran Council resolutions: Therefore be it
 Resolved,  That  the he  National  Lutheran
 Council reaffirm its` concern for a fair and
 just immigration law, and express its hope
 that Congress will enact into law the prin-
 ciples and objectives contained in the Presi-
 dent's proposal now before Congress; and be
 it further
 Resolved, That the congregations of the
 member bodies of the National Lutheran
 Council be encouraged to welcome lmmi-
 grants into their fellowship and to assist
 them in continuing integration into com-
 munity life.
 NSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 Mr. RYAN.  Mr. Speaker, when the
 history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam is
 finally written, a great American news-
 paper-the New York Times-will have
 a special place for having lived up to the
 highest standard of courageous and in-
 cisive journalism.  No newcomer to this
 complex issue, the New York Times pub-
 lished articles by Pulitzer Prize winner
 David Halberstram and Homer Bigart
 which brought to light the realities of
 the dictatorial Diem regime.  Recently
 James Reston has analyzed the complex-
 ities of Vietnam in a number of pene-
 trating articles, and the New York Times
 has put special emphasis on Vietnam on
 the editorial page in a series of in-depth
 editorials.  I commend the following
 three editorials to my colleagues:

 politics, is doing its best to multiply the
 perils and frustrations of the war in southeast
 Asia.
 This group ignores the realities of the pres-
 ent situation.  It ignores the obvious war-
 weariness of the people of South Vietnam.  It
 ignores the steady stream of desertions from
 the Vietnamese Army.  It ignores the diffi-
 culty of protecting isolated American bases
 against the surprise attacks of guerrillas.
 It ignores the possibility of an invasion
 of South V etnam by the very considerable
 North Viet    ese Army.  It ignores the
 problem of how an aerial counterattack could
 cope successfully with a massive ground at-
 tack of this character.  It ignores the pos-
 sibility of Chinese Intervention.  It ignores
 the logistics and belittles the cost in lives
 lost, blood spilled and treasure wasted, of
 fighting a war on a jungle front 7,000 miles
 from the coast of California.
 The whole aim of this group is to expand
 the Vietnamese war, even if it means drawing
 in China and perhaps the Soviet Union as
 well.  By its lights, President Johnson's dec-
 laration that the United States seeks no
 wider war is as much a prescription for fail-
 ure as any attempt at a negotiated peace.
 It is one thing to say, as Secretary McNamara
 did in his testimony yesterday, that this
 country has "no other alternative than con-
 tinuing to support South Vietnam against
 the Red`gUerrilla onslaught." It is quite an-
 other to argue that the road out of the pres-
 ent hazardous situation is to invite world
 destruction.  The American people made it
 overwhelmingly clear in the last election
 that they do not want to plunge recklessly
 down that road.
 any real effectiveness.  It Is more urgent
 than ever for President Johnson to take a
 new, hard look at this 'worsening morass
 before honorable extrication from it becomes
 impossible.

 THE DEBATE ON VIETNAM
 A great debate on the Vietnamese conflict
 is now raging all over the United States.  It
 ,goes from the White House, Congress, and
 the Pentagon to every home, office, - factory,
 and farm.                           it is unresolved because the Gov-
 ernment has not yet decided on its policy or,
 if it has, President Johnson is not telling
 the American people.  The debate's subject,
 in its simplest form, is Whether to fight a
 big war in Vietnam or to seek a way out
 through a combination of continuing de-
 fense and diplomatic negotiation.
 The case for a vastly stepped-up American
 military commitment-as set forth in today's
 Magazine by  military analyst Hanson W.
 Baldwin-is that the "Communist strategy
 of creeping aggression" must be stopped in
 Vietnam before it swallows all of Asia and
 the world.  Under this theory, the United
 States should undertake saturation bombing
 been that our military position is too weak
 to allow negotiations.  Every week it has
 grown weaker, and the latest upheavals in
 the Vietnamese military and political struc-
 ture indicate that total collapse may be im-
 minent.  To send hundreds of thousands of
 Americans into an endless jungle war or to
 bomb North Vietnamese ports and industrial
 centers on a saturation basis would be a
 surer road to global holocaust than to a
 victory arms can never win for either side.

 REVOLVING DOOR IN SAIGON
 Personal and group ambitions seem more
 consequential to some of South Vietnam's
 key military leaders than the war against
 the Vietcong.         The world worries about the
 danger of a general war growing out of the
 U.S. effort to underwrite Vietnamese free-
 dom with American men, money and arms.
 Yet, the primary worry for many of the gen-
 erals and colonels who are supposed to be in
 direct charge of Saigon's war effort revolves
 around personal power.
 In his testimony before the House Armed
 Services Committee, at almost the time the
 latest coup was beginning, Secretary McNa-
 mara warned that without national unity,and
 a stable government the South `Vietnamese
 would not be able to make effective use either
 of their own armed forces or of the help the
 United States is giving them.  His Words
 were apparently lost on the battling warlords
 in Saigon.
 Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this
 newest in an endless series of internal up-
 heavals is how unprepared every American
 policymaker in Saigon or Washington seemed
 to be for it.  The available evidence suggests
 that the abortive coup was hatched in the
 South Vietnamese Embassy In Washington,
 where Colonel Thao was press attache until
 recently  and  where  Lieutenant  General
 Khiem is currently ambassador.  The total
 surprise of American officialdom indicates
 an abysmal failure of the Central Intelligence
 Agency and every branch of military intelli-
 gence.  It is all much too' reminiscent of the
 days  when  Washington  gave over-ready
 credence to the late Ngo Dinh Diem's glowing
 reports of military victories and  villages
 :made secure.
 The situation in Saigon is still too obscure
 to permit any forecast of who will emerge
 as ruler for a day, a week, or a month. But
 there are enough puzzles about the latest
 insurgence to raise suspicion that the Viet-
 cong may have infiltrated the highest coun-
 cils of the Vietnamese armed forces.  Cer-
 tainly, there is no prospect of the kind of
 stable government Secretary McNamara has

 The use of term loans in foreign opera-
 tions is' an adaptation of techniques de-
 veloped in the United States for domestic
 lending.         As 1s well known, term loans in
 the United 'States are generally made to
 finance acquisitions of plants, machinery and
 equipment, with repayment out of the cash
 flow-earnings and depreciation-expected
 to be generated by their use.  The lender
 must satisfy himself that the borrower will,
 have funds forthcoming to meet his obliga-
 tions.  The ,borrower can obtain terms that
 give flexibility in repayment schedules and
 permit efficient use of loan funds.  Over
 half of the total dollar volume of business
 loans made by major New York City banks
 consist of term loans.
 Banks extending term loans abroad must,
 however, satisfy themselves that the bor-
 rower will not only generate adequate cash
 flows  but  also will be  able to convert
 his local currency earnings into U.S. dol-
 lars.                      Exchange risks-including the pos-
 sibility, however remote, that exchange con-
 trols may prohibit remittances to the United
 States-and political risks are as much part
 and parcel of considerations bearing on the
 extension of a term loan as the general
 credit  standing of the  borrower,  Other
 essential  considerations are  the balance-
 of-payments  position  of  the                           borrower's
 Country, the level of its gold and foreign
 exchange reserves and its short-term inter-
 national indebtedness. Under certain cir-
 cumstances; a country may appear to be
 "borrowed up."

 U.S.  commercial  banks to  borrowers  in
 less-developed countries  have  been   ar-
 ranged in conjunction with operations of the
 Export-Import Bank, the World Bank, the
 Agency for International Development and
 such private lenders as insurance companies.
 As part of policies to encourage U.S. exports,
 the Export-Import tank has recently devel-
 oped comprehensive insurance coverage for
 banks against political, military, and com-
 mercial risks. on development loans. This can
 be expected, as was the intention, to increase
 the volume of term lending, particularly to
 some of the less-developed countries.
 On a number of occasions, U.S,. com-
 rrierelal banks also have granted loans to
 foreign governments or central banks as part
 of packages of financial assistance extended
 by the International Monetary Fund, some-
 times in conjunction with credits from the
 U.S. Treasury or the Export-Import Bank.
 Such arrangements have often been nego-
 tiated with Latin American nations.
 Loans to Europe and Canada have been
 extended primarily to foreign subsidiaries of
 American businesses.  Sometimes, U.S. firms
 operating abroad have also been instru-.
 mental in helping arrange U.S. bank financ-
 ing for many of the foreign customers and
 suppliers  with  whom  they  do  business.
 Credits have thus been granted to finance
 purchases of oil tankers, freighters, air-
 planes,  machinery,  electrical                       equipment,
 etc.  Because of their rapid rate of obso-
 lescence, airplanes have been particularly
 well suited to financing through bank term
 loans, with maturities adjusted to the funds
 generated through earnings and deprecia-
 tion allowances.  Shipping firms have re-
 ceived substantial amounts of term credit
 by obtaining long-term charters from major
 shippers of such raw materials as oil, Iron
 ore, and bauxite and assigning the charter
 income to the lenders.
 Technical, innovations in industry have
 thus been matched by innovations in bank-
 ing techniques.  Like  advances in tech-
 nology, the bank term loan is spreading to
 meet the needs of corporate enterprise here
 as well as abroad.  The growth of inter-
 national trade and multinational business
 organizations naturally creates demands for
 flexible financing on an international scale.
 TERM LOANS AND TIlE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
 Term loans help promote U.S. exports in
 the period following the year when they are
 granted; this minimizes their impact on the
 balance of payments.  Subsequent repay-
 ments of the loans with interest increase
 V.S. balance-of-payments receipts.
 . Foreigners not only borrow in the United
 States but also keep deposits in U.S. banks
 and hold bankers acceptances and other
 A765
 short -ter mI investments.  Some of these de-
 posits are normally connected with the loans
 granted them by U.S. banks.  In fact, most
 nations hold short-term assets in U.S. banks
 in excess of the sums they borrow from them,
 The relevant data for selected countries are
 summed up in the table, which also shows
 the value of U.S. trade with the nations
 concerned.
 Among the leading net debtors is Japan;
 its assets in the United States are, however,
 large.  Japan is the second largest customer
 of the United States.  This group of coun-
 tries also includes several Latin American
 countries and Norway (because of shipping
 loans).

 NOTE.-The countries are arranged in 2 groups: those where U.S, bank credits, both short and long term, are
 smaller than short-term dollar assets held by them in U.S. banks and vice versa. Within each group, the countires
 are arranged according to the size of U.S. bank credits to them,
 Bank lending also appears as a compli-
 cating factor. In our balance of payments
 because of the way in which Government
 statisticians present their accounts.  When
 an American citizen makes a deposit in a
 foreign bank or a loan to a foreigner, the
 transaction is recorded as a capital outflow;
 but when a foreigner makes a deposit in a
 U.S. bank or buys V.S. short-term paper,
 the transaction is considered as one of the
 means of "financing" the U.S. payments defi-
 cit rather than a capital inflow that helps
 reduce the deficit.  A committee of Govern-
 ment-appointed experts, which, under the
 chairmanship of Edward M. Bernstein, has
 since April 1963 been examining the asym-
 metries and anomalies in U.S. balance-of-
 payments bookkeeping, is to report its find-
 ings this month.
 One thing is certain.  Bank loans abroad
 to finance V.S. exports and other interna-
 tional business do not result in a loss of
 U.S. interntaional wealth.   They help ex-
 pand U.S. exports and job opportunities and
 incomes at home.  They speed up economic
 development abroad.  The law providing for
 the interest equalization tax, with its im-
 plied threat of removing the exemption for
 bank term loans, should be allowed to expire
 on its scheduled date at the end of 1965.
 Even if some immediate advantage were to
 be gained for our balance of payments by
 controls over bank lending, it would be more
 than offset by the damage such controls
 would do to the standing of the dollar as
 A Bill To Broaden Coverage of Social
 Security Benefits
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. PAUL A. FINO
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 Mr. FINO. Mr. Speaker, today I re-
 introduced my bill to broaden coverage
 of social security benefits to include
 brothers, sisters, and other dependent
 relatives of a deceased individual fully
 insured under the act.
 At present, a dependent brother, sister,
 or other relative of a deceased wage.
 earner is left in the cold as far as social
 security payments when that wage earn-
 er dies.  Except for funeral expenses
 paid, all of the deceased's social secu-
 rity contributions are lost unless there is
 a surviving spouse.
 My proposed legislation would remedy
 this great injustice.  Under this legis-
 lation, if a dependent brother, sister, or
 relative of an unmarried wage earner
 can show that he or she was receiving

 What My Country Means to Me
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. E. ROSS ADAIR
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 Mr. ADAIR.  Mr. Speaker, it is with a
 great deal of pride that I call attention
 to the signal achievement of one of the
 eighth-grade students of the Whitley
 County, Ind., schools, Richard Redman.
 Richard, who is enrolled in Marshall Me-
 morial School-named after Indiana's
 onetime  Vice  President-recently  was
 judged first-place winner for his essay
 entitled, "What My Country Means to
 Me."
 Richard's essay was in competition
 with 50 other entries in the eighth-grade
 contest in Whitley County schools.
 We can all take to heart the warm, pa-
 triotic message of this fine, young Amer-
 ican.            After reading his essay, it is easy
 to understand why it was judged a first-
 place winner.
 The prize-winning essay follows:

 "I believe in the United States of America
 as a government of the people, by the people,
 for the people;  a government whose just
 powers are derived from the consent of the
 governed;  a  democracy  in  a  republic;  a
 sovereign Nation of many sovereign States; a

 lished                                                                             upon  those  principles of freedom,

 "I therefore believe it is my duty to my

 tion; to obey its laws; to respect its flag; and
 to defend it against all enemies."
 I am an American youth.  Because of my
 age, I am not a voter, a property owner,
 a wage earner, or an official.  Nevertheless
 I am a citizen.  Regardless of my age-yes,
 even because of it-I am important to my
 country and my country is very important
 to me.  What I do, say, or think at school,
 at home, at church, on the street, or wherever
 I may be is an indication of the kind of
 citizen that I am and want to be.
 Naturally, it makes me feel proud to refer
 to America as my country, but when I con-
 sider how it came to be mine, my pride is
 overshadowed  with  humility.   I  did  not
 choose tihs great land to he my homeland;
 it was by the grace of God that I was born
 here and that this land of freedom and op-
 portunity became mine.  Furthermore, as I
 live today in the 20th century, under the
 blessing of God, I am enjoying a civilization
 established, preserved, and extended by oth-
 ers; their work and sacrifices have made my
 country great.  These facts cause me to un-
 derstand and appreciate my American heri-
 tage, and they influence site to do to the best
 of my ability what God and my country ex-
 pect me to do.
 Someone has said, "The difficult thing to
 remember about patriotism is that it is a
 sentiment to which is tied a bundle of obli-
 gations." These obligations are mine even as
 a youth. Now and all through my life I must
 live and work to preserve liberty and democ-
 racy.  I can do this now through obeying
 laws, getting a good education, and being in-
 terested in local, national, and world affairs.
 Later in my life, there will come opportu-
 nities for voting, jury service, and perhaps
 military duty, to name just a few of the many
 privileges and responsibilities which will be
 mine as a worthy citizen of this country
 which means so much to me.
 The late President Kennedy beautifully
 summarized each  citizen's obligation  to-
 ward his country when he said, "Ask not
 what your country can do for you, ask what
 you can do for your country."
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. ROBERT H. MICHEL
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 Mr. MICHEL.  Mr. Speaker, under
 unanimous consent I include the follow-
 ing editorial from the Chicago Tribune
 dated February 20, 1965:
 ORDERS FROM ow HIGH
 The presidents and chairmen of the boards
 of nearly all                  the major corporations and
 banks doing a large international business
 were called to the White House Thursday to
 serve as a captive audience while President
 Johnson gave them their orders.  His com-
 mand was that they reduce oversee, invest-
 ments and loans this year in order to help
 correct the deficit in the international bal-
 ance of payments which arises largely be-
 cause of the administration's own policies.
 The banks were told to cut foreign lend-
 ing 75 percent and the corporations were di-
 rected to reduce their flow of dollars out of
 the country by 15 to 20 percent.  The leaders
 of the business and banking communities
 were then steered respectively to the Com-
 merce Department and to the Federal Re-
 serve, where they were directed to file a flock
 of reports with Washington whenever they
 made a decision to send dollars abroad.
 Mr. Johnson showed the iron hand in the
 velvet glove by expressing the hope that the
 balance-of-payments  problem  could  be
 its own relatively limited resources,  wh e
 "the resources of the Federal Government are
 limited  only by  the total  wealth of  the
 country."  This gentleman adds, "This phi-
 losophy would have made our fathers' hair
 stand on end, but nevertheless it is a fact.
 More and more conservative businessmen are
 coming to the view that you can't look at
 Government in the same way you view a
 business."
 A Wall Streeter comments, "We might as
 well give this  fiscal  innovation  of deficit
 financing an opportunity to prove itself." A
 fuel supplier admits the "Great Society" will
 produce "continued inflation and an inflated
 dollar, but lots of goods will be sold under
 it.,,
 To a surprising degree, the greatest spend-
 er in history has been viewed up to now as
 a  "conservative"  and  a  "middle-of-the-
 roader."  But we find a more dispassionate
 view in the dissent of one businessman:
 "More and more, the Government is telling
 you how to run your business-whom you
 must hire, how much you must pay, whom
 you cannot fire.  In 20 years, if this keeps
 up, there will be on incentive to be a busi-
 nessman."
 Isn't this a fair description of what hap-
 pened at the Washington conference?  Was
 not the President telling the 370 men in his
 audience how to run their businesses? And
 what could they do but sit and take it?
 TENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. CRAIG HOSMER
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 Mr. HOSMER.  Mr. Speaker, the cur-
 rent issue of the American Security
 Council's Washington Report, dated Feb-
 ruary 22, contains a remarkably percep-
 tive essay by Frank J. Johnson, the
 publication's foreign editor. It reads as
 follows :
 WHY  WE  CAN'T  NEGOTIATE  NOW
 A great swirl of climactic events has fol-
 lowed President Johnson's order to give con-
 crete effect to his repeated warnings to the

 Communists to cease their aggression against
 South, Vietnam.  The difficult but extremely
 necessary decisions have at last been taken,
 Inevitably in such cases, an atmosphere of
 crisis is created by the outraged cries and
 threats of international communism.  Just
 as inevitably, the calls for a "negotiated
 settlement" are redoubled on the free world
 side of the line.  Many well-meaning people
 find it difficult to understand why President
 Johnson does not at least accompany his
 military action by an offer to enter into im-
 mediate, negotiations to end the Vietnam
 war.
 Undoubtedly, the President would like
 nothing better-nor would any other person
 of good will-if negotiation presently offered
 a reasonable prospect of fulfilling our pledge
 to defend the people of Vietnam; it is this
 pledge which we must honor if there is ever
 to be any hope of lasting peace in the world.
 But in considering negotiation the adminis-
 tration is faced with a series of very un-
 pleasant facts, which are either unknown or
 forgotten by the general public.
 ,One set of facts concerns the inherent na-
 ture of guerrilla wars.  The military tactics
 and political purposes of such wars are not
 subject to stalemate or compromise. For ex-
 ample, much of the current argument for
 negotiation rests on the hypothesis that a
 "military victory" for either side is impossi-
 ble.  This is begging the question.  Since
 World War It, when the guerrilla war came
 into vogue, they have invariably been won or
 lost. Either the guerrillas "win" in the sense
 of achieving a takeover of the country or
 government in question, or else they are mili-
 tarily defeated, at least to the point where
 they are reduced to a harmless remnant.
 There have been no exceptions to this rule.
 The ?guerrillas  triumphed  completely
 against the Dutch in Indonesia, against the
 French in Algeria and Indochina (except
 here they settled for North Vietnam in 1954
 rather than risk U.S, intervention), against
 the British in Palestine and Cyprus, and
 against Batista in Cuba.  They were de-
 cisively defeated in Greece, the Philippines,
 Mal, a    'burins    and-apparently=Vene-
 These statements might be written off as
 mere propaganda bargaining were they not
 backed up by a great deal of background in-
 formation coming out of Communist China,
 which indicate that she believes time and
 events are very much on her side.  Since the
 second hypothesis for negotiations is that
 they must include Communist China, her
 attitude is obviously decisive to the outcome.
 Here are some of the more public facts which
 the President must consider:
 (1) Between December 21, 1964, and Jan-
 uary 4, 1965, the first session of the Third
 National People's Congress was convened in
 Peiping.  Nearly 3,000 deputies met behind
 closed doors to hear speeches by the leaders
 of Communist China.  In addition to state-
 ments by Marshall Ho Lung, boasting that
 the Chinese people's army has been con-
 siderably                                                                          enlarged,  supplied with  up-to-
 date equipment, and is now supported by
 powerful naval and air force units,    the
 Chinese published, on December 30, an ab-
 breviated version of Premier Chou En-lai's
 report on Chinese    domestic and foreign
 policy.
 The speech reflected great pride and self-
 confidence resulting from the explosion of
 the atomic bomb, the surmounting of the
 "very serious difficulties" between 1959 and
 1961, resulting from the failure of the "great
 leap forward," and the intention of trans-
 forming China into a world power with
 the most modern industry, agriculture, tech-
 nology, and defense within the shortest pos-
 sible time.  Reviewing foreign policy, Chou
 pledged support to all-and he listed each
 one-revolutionary movements and centers
 of unrest. He declared that Peiping would
 consider negotiation with the United States
 only after it had given up Taiwan and would
 deal with the United Nations only when it
 had thrown out Nationalist China.
 Chou further asserted that the East wind
 would prevail over the West wind, and that
 favorable conditions for such an outcome
 are the "storm centers of world revolution
 in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."  The
 speech forces the conclusion that the Chi-
 nese Communists are not only conscious of
 another point he actually made In the inter-
 view.  Unless he can be shaken in this con-
 viction there is no possible basis for negoti-
 ation with China.
 MUST  STOP  REDS
 It is easy for those without responsibility
 to call for "negotiation," as though this were
 the automatic panacea for all the world's ills.
 But the U.S. Government is faced with the
 kinds of facts mentioned above, as well as
 much more grim data of a secret nature,
 which cannot be shrugged off.  This is why
 it has consistently rejected calls for a new
 Geneva Conference and why even the British
 have supported this stand.  It is accepted as
 axiomatic by most policymakers that under
 present circumstances negotiation could lead
 only to an American defeat.
 Such a defeat  cannot be accepted, not
 simply for reasons of foolish national pride,
 but because the Chinese have made it so
 very plain that Vietnam is only part of a
 much wider plan for aggrandizement and
 troublemaking. We are helping Vietnam
 because it is in the interest. of free men
 everywhere that the Communist challenge
 be halted at this point.
 The President is trying to create a new
 psychological situation in Asia.  His decision
 to retaliate against North Vietnam is the only
 one which offers any hope of success.  It has
 been long overdue and is all the more diffi-
 cult for that reason, but It is still not too
 late.  Mr. Johnson should be warmly con-
 gratulated  for  his  action.   If we  carry
 through our policy with resolution there is
 still an excellent chance that we can "win"
 the Vietnam war at least in the sense that
 the Communists are, induced to call off the
 war as a bad business and eiher withdraw
 the guerrillas into North Vietnam or else
 cease outside aid completely and leave them
 to their fate. Only then can there be a gen-
 uine basis for a negotiation which will ratify
 this decision.
 The Communists will not come willingly
 or easily to such a disagreeable choice.  Pre-
 vious U.S. vacillation has led them to count

 the President be given the time to make
 the full effect of his new policy felt in Hanoi,
 Peiping, and Moscow without being continu-

 negotiation only make the task harder and
 bloodier because it encourages the Commu-

 Review and Outlook
 Government policy,  precisely because its
 cardinal principle is that no one very ser-
 iously challenge what someone else proposes.
 No proposal is perfect, and without challenge.
 the imperfections can only be discovered too
 late.
 Second, such an enshrinement of logroll-
 ing tends to legitimize practically anything
 some group is brazen enough to demand.
 Such a faction more or lessnames its own
 price for  not rocking  the  boat.  No  one
 bothers to object that even if a proposal is
 good for someone it may be bad for all of
 us.  What's too easily ignored is President
 Johnson's own warning, "The national inter-
 est is greater than the sum of all local
 interests."
 Most important,  this sort of consensus
 seems to add up to a cementing of one of the
 central philosophies of the New Deal: "Let
 the Federal Government do it."  With the
 Government already so  dominant   in  our
 society, our era is hardly the time to do away
 with debate over giving Government more
 responsibility and hence more power over all
 of us.  Now more than ever, the warnings
 need to be heard, not stifled.
 In short, a politics of consensus could pro-
 vide undoubted opportunities, but it runs
 the considerable danger that the consensus
 would be primarily an agreement for all of us
 to look the other way while each of us steals
 his favorite gem from the public treasure
 chest.
 The Rumanians will acquire the synthetic
 rubber plant, nevertheless;  Firestone has
 agreed to build it. But at a time when Com-

 American  servicemen  in     Vietnam * * *
 when Soviet Russia stages mob attacks on
 the American embassy and roughs up U.S.
 newsmen  covering  the  attacks * * * and
 when Peiping and Moscow are working to
 undermine freedom   in  the  Congo  and
 throughout Africa, it is heartening to know
 that one major American corporation refuses
 to do business with America's enemies.
 Lenin once said that when the time comes
 to strangle capitalism, businessmen will be

 the rope.  Perhaps so.  But Goodyear has

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 3, 1965
 Mr. YOUNGER.  Mr. Speaker, today
 we hear much about an administration
 by consenus and I have not seen any-
 thing that points up the dangers of such
 an administration as well as an editorial
 which appeared in the Wall Street Jour-
 nal  on                              February  18.  The  editorial
 follows:
 REVIEW AND OUTLOOK
 PRECAUTIONS ON CONSENSUS
 President Johnson              offers himself as an
 apostle          of  consensus,  a  concept elusive
 enough           as a word, let     alone as policy.
 Whether this notion is promising or danger-
 ous depends on just what he has in mind.
 He seems to mean, at a minimum,; less
 heated disagreement.  "Let          us reject any
 among us who seek to reopen old wounds
 and rekindle old hatreds," he enjoined in
 his inaugural address. "The time has come
 to  achieve  progress without  strife  and
 change without hatred: Not without differ-
 ence of opinion, but without the deep and
 abiding divisions which scar the Union for
 generations."
 In some respects, the vision is farsighted
 indeed.  The President is rejecting a popu-
 lar brand of political leadership which con-
 sists mostly of arousing the faithful to rise
 up and slay the Infidel.  This kind of poli-
 tics sometimes has proved effective, and it
 must be particularly tempting for a Presi-
 dent with huge congressional majorities.
 As the President seems to realize so well,
 though, tough tactics have the unfortunate
 result of clouding communications among
 factions in our society.  With their leaders
 often inciting them against each other, it's
 hard for opposing groups to remember that
 both  may  possibly  be   saying  something
 worth listening to.  Disagreement is resolved
 by brute force, which is less likely to yield
 intelligent policy than compromise borne of
 honest discussion.
 A politics of consensus, by promoting mod-
 eration and compromise, could more nearly
 establish a true give-and-take discourse on
 national policy.  That is unquestionably a
 high ideal, and perhaps the President is
 right when he says the time for it has come.
 Yet there are some who are dubious about
 Mr. Johnson's ideal.  Part of their reaction
 is simply aversion to the President's practical
 politics, and part is disappointment that the
 leader of the faithful professes friendship
 with  the  infidel.  But a more  significant
 part, we think, arises from concern over just
 what kind of tactics will be used to suppress
 strife and keep everyone happy.
 A cynical formula for "consensus" could
 read merely: Throw tax cuts and lots of flat-
 tery to businessmen, the union shop and an
 Under Secretary of Labor to the unions,
 school aid to educators with a drop to Cath-
 olics, high price supports to farmers and
 transportation aid to cities.  And so on.
 The  formula might build  considerable
 harmony and reduce strife, for a while any-
 way.  It's an ancient truism that if enough
 people are getting a big enough sop, they
 will hesitate to challenge the one someone
 else gets. But a consensus  based on no
 more than this is not exactly an appealing
 prospect.
 For one thing, a consensus thus cynically
 conceived would degrade rather than im-
 prove the quality of public discussion on

 Tuesday, February 16, 1965
 Mr. RHODES   of   Arizona.  Mr.
 Speaker, under leave previously granted,
 I would like to include in the RECORD the
 following   self-explanatory      editorial
 which appeared in the Arizona Republic
 on February 14, 1965. I join the Arizona
 Republic in saying, "Good Going, Good-
 year." The editorial is as follows:
 GOOD GOING, GOODYEAR
 The U.S. State Department and Communist
 Rumania had it all figured out.
 The Goodyear Corp. would sell a modern
 synthetic rubber plant to Rumania.  Inas-
 much as State had been assured by the
 Rumanian  Government  that it wouldn't
 divulge the polyisoprene secrets to other
 Communist countries, it wasn't like giving
 away important production secrets to every
 Communist country.  And, State reasoned,
 sale of the plant would help bring Rumania
 closer to the West.
 But the State Department hadn't consid-
 ered the reaction of the Goodyear Corp. And
 Goodyear  refused  to sell  the  plant  to
 Rumania, thereby passing up an approxi-
 mately $50 million transaction.
 In the current company newspaper, pub-
 lished in Litchfield Park, Goodyear explained
 that it felt the dangers to the United States
 far outweighed the possible benefits in the
 proposed deal.  The company believes the
 Communists could, if they desired, disrupt
 natural rubber markets in Malaysia. Liberia,
 and other undeveloped countries, using cut-
 rate prices (underwritten by the state) as
 economic clubs.
 Furthermore,  although  respecting  the
 State Department's belief in the Rumanians'
 promise, Goodyear said it preferred not to
 entrust its production secrets to the Com-
 munists.

 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 Mr. CURTIS.                                                                           Mr. Speaker, in spite
 of repeated promises, the administration
 has failed to eliminate the deficit in our
 international balance of payments. Last
 year the deficit on regular transactions
 amounted to about $3 billion, compared
 to $3.3 billion for 1963.  Especially dis-
 trubing are the figures for the fourth
 quarter of 1964, which show a deficit in
 the order of $1.4 billion or nearly $6 bil-
 lion on an annual basis.                                                                                                  The First Na-
 tional City Bank Monthly Economic Let-
 ter for February 1965, details our de-
 teriorating payments position and ana-
 lyzes recent administration proposals to
 deal with the problem.
 The two measures most recently pro-
 posed as solutions to the chronic pay-
 ments problem are a 2-year extension
 and broadening of the interest equaliza-
 tion tax, which was originally proposed
 as a temporary-tax, a restriction of bank
 lending abroad, and a program of so-
 called voluntary restraint on direct in-
 vestment. Restrictive controls over pri-
 vate investment abroad in the long run
 would work untold damage on our own
 economy as well as to world prosperity
 and economic development.  Domesti-
 cally, such curbs on lending would cut
 U.S. exports which are intimately linked
 with our oversea loans and investments.
 The letter states that:
 Postwar experience selective controls here
 and abroad shows  unmistakably that one
 measure lays the groundwork and necessity
 for another.  This is already being demon-
 strated.  First we have the interest equali-
 zation tax, then provision for its extension
 to bank loans, and now more consideration
 of direct controls over capital.  The prolifera-
 tion is endless and so are the complexities.
 There is an additional risk in propos-
 ing controls of this sort. They could be
 regarded as something which has in fact
 reduced the ability of U.S. dollar holders,
 here and abroad, to use or transfer them
 by their own choice. If the dollar is to
 remain trusted and respected, it must re-
 main unfettered.

 headed for more serious trouble than it has

 Mr. MICHEL.                                        Mr.  Speaker,  under
 unanimous consent I include the follow-
 ing editorial from the Peoria Journal
 Star dated February 19, 1965:.
 WE  CAN  WIN                                              IN   VIETNAM
 Before we get too worked up about the ab-
 sence of U.S. combat forces in South Vietnam
 "who ought to be in there and doing the job
 right," and the resulting deaths of American
 specialists, and the confusion over the gov-
 ernment of the place and its "attitude" to-
 ward the United States, etc., we had better
 take a look at how the job was done before.
 Before the United States made the decision
 not to let the Communists run, unchecked,
 over the whole of southeast Asia, the French
 tried to throw them out of Vietnam.
 They decided not to fool around and to do
 the job right.
 The French sent their own regular forces
 by the tens and even hundreds of thousands,
 plus thousands of veteran German soldiers
 enlisted into the Foreign Legion, and went
 out to clobber the Vietcong.
 Instead, they were clobbered themselves.
 They had 200,000 casualties and were run out
 of Vietnam altogether in a short space of
 time.
 We stepped in to support a South Vietnam
 regime to prevent the Vietcong from over-
 running the whole country and with that
 momentum and morale situation all the rest
 of the rich subcontinent.
 The experts and the press reported that
 Vietnam was confused, naked, unarmed and
 morale  shattered  and  "wouldn't  last  6
 months."
 And we didn't rush in with massive com-
 bat forces to replace the French Army.                                                                             We
 sent arms, training experts, supply handlers,
 and advisers-a mere handful.
 That handful is now up to 23,000 men,
 mostly doing specialist "behind the lines"
 jobs, and a few serving as combat advisers.
 Vietnam has resisted the Vietcong, as a re-
 sult, under this system not for 6 months as
 forecast, and not for a couple of years, but
 for a dozen years, virtually.
 Thousands have died and are dying. Thou-
 sands of guerrillas have been killed and their
 bodies  carefully counted,  and  are being
 killed. Somebody Is fighting the forces that
 cut down 200,000 Frenchmen, somebody more
 than 23,000 American fliers, mechanics, sup-
 ply experts, advisers, etc.
 About 300 Americans have been killed.
 Would fewer Americans die if we let them
 have South Vietnam? And then go after us
 somewhere else, as they surely would?
 De Gaulle has said from the first that we
 can't possibly succeed where the brilliant
 and  gallant French have failed.   If they
 couldn't do It with strong measures and
 direct war, how can we do It by carefully
 avoiding the use of combat units and just
 helping Vietnamese who will fight for their
 own country?
 The Communists and their stooges, natu-
 rally, have been using every agency and de-
 vice possible to propagandize the hopeless-
 ness of our effort, as well.
 And they have the great advantage of tying
 their control over many devices of propa-
 ganda with their control over guerrilla ef-
 forts and "incidents"-and they are making
 a major effort to convince us it is hopeless
 right now, by both methods.  And to scare us,
 in the bargain.
 The fact remains that we have, thus far,
 done a far better job than the French, with
 all the frustrations involved, and without
 sending in an American Army, and without
 suffering 200,000 casualties as they did.
 The record shows that it was not a stupid
 policy.  It was a shrewd policy.
 The record shows that we have vastly im-
 proved the free world's chances over what
 they were when we went in with this policy,
 and vastly improved the situation left us by
 the French.
 The record suggests that having corrected
 their major mistakes, we can correct some of
 our own mistakes and do a still more suc-
 cessful job-and we can win.
 The biggest barrier to that is the encour-
 agement the Red Chinese take and their
 Communist allies from our discouragement.
 The killing of some 30 Americans in terror
 raids the last week was not designed for any
 actual military benefit.  It was designed to
 horrify us, and to frighten us, and thus to
 cause us to give up and get out.
 They are fighting a political war and hope
 to win it, not in Vietnam, but right here in
 the minds and, votes of Americans in the
 United States.
 And if they do, they will figure they can
 win anything they want by simply scaring us
 "cowardly" Americans-the paper tiger.  And
 they will push us, and push us, and push us,
 until we just can't stand to be pushed any
 more.
 And therein lies the real danger of a major
 war.

 DoIxa B.usmzSS WITH OUR ENEMII^
 With the pledge of military aid to North
 Vietnam by Soviet Russia, the United States
 has again been placed in the position of
 direct trading with an avowed enemy.
 There has never been any doubt as to
 Russia's intention to do all in her power to
 destroy the United States, but our leaders
 have been able to wink at these announced
 intentions and ' work for establishment and
 extension of trade with the Communists In
 the name of better relations.  The better
 relations have included the stoning of the
 American Embassy with the approval of the
 Russian regime, and the jeopardizing of the
 lives of our diplomats in Russia and other
 countries under her domination.
 With. American boys  being killed  and
 wounded ' in South Vietnam, and Russian
 pledges of military assistance to their killers,
 there can no longer be any doubt that our
 vacillating foreign policy has led us down
 the street to failure in our position in the
 world.
 It is still not too late for the United States
 to call a halt to this folly.  In view of pres-
 ent circumstances, any attempt to honey up
 to the Communists by inviting them to the
 United States "to see how we. live" makes
 about as much sense as hiring a crazed
 murderer to baby-sit with our children.
 The United Nations have proven itself
 powerless to serve as anything but a tool
 of the Communists, who in turn laugh at
 any moral obligations to the world debating
 society. Recently, the noted political col-

 evitable result of the application of the
 interest equalization tax to bank loans
 with a term of over 1 year will be to re-
 duce the volume of U.S. exports.  Thus a
 measure designed to help bring the bal-
 ance of payments into surplus will ac-
 tually have an offsetting effect that will
 tend to deepen the deficit.
 The link between bank loans and U.S.
 exports is discussed at some length in
 the Monthly Economic Letter of Decem-
 ber 1964, published by the First National
 City Bank of New York.  The article
 points out how the remarkable expansion
 of world trade in recent years has re-

 position is evident from the fact that
 while presumably attempting to increase
 world trade, the administration now
 seeks to restrict the financing required
 to carry on that trade.
 Although it is often said that term
 loans of over 1 year do riot finance ex-
 ports, the article makes perfectly clear
 the various ways in which such term
 loans do finance exports and, at the same
 time, increase job opportunities and in-
 comes at home.
 In view of the administration's in-
 creasing reliance on restrictions in the
 field of international trade and pay-
 ments, I ask unanimous consent that the
 article from the Monthly Economic Let-
 ter be included in the RECORD at this

 In the world today, nations are exchang-
 ing goods in rapidly growing volumes.  Our
 own exports have expanded from $15 billion
 to $25 billion in the past 10 years. Under-
 standably, the remarkable expansion of world
 trade has required growing supplies of credit.
 Commercial banks in the United States
 and other principal trading nations extend
 credits to their foreign correspondents and
 customers.  Indeed, the resources of com-
 mercial banks constitute a pool of private
 international liquidity that is drawn upon
 by creditworthy borrowers in creditworthy
 countries throughout the world.
 Along with direct  investment  in bricks
 and mortar, commercial bank credit abroad
 has greatly expanded over the past 15 years
 as private U.S. capital has replaced U.S. Gov-
 ernment aid to Western Europe and Japan-
 aid that had been an essential ingredient
 during the earlier postwar period in reinvig-
 'orating world commerce.  In recent years,
 private financing has received further im-
 petus from the restoration of meaningful
 currency convertibility among the principal
 .nations.  These  trends and developments
 have in turn strengthened international com-
 petition in the field of money and banking;
 they have also created new opportunities.
 Within a relatively short span of time, U.S.
 banks have girded themselves to play a prom-
 inent role in world finance.  With the dollar
 the  leading  international currency,  the
 United States the world's largest exporter
 and importer, and U.S. money and capital
 markets the single most important source
 of financial resources, this has been a natural
 evolution.
 PATTERNS OF BANK LENDING
 American commercial banks engaging in
 international  business  extend both short-
 and- long-term cedits.                      According to defini-
 tions used by official statisticians, short-term
 credits are those with a maturity up to 1
 year; they are frequently renewed from year
 to year.  Loans beyond 1 year are called term
 loans.    These term loans have been custom-
 ary               in        domestic  financing  in  the United
 States for a quarter of a century and have,
 since World War II, spread to the field of
 International financing.
 U.S. banks have outstanding short- and
 tong-term  credits  abroad     of  $9.5  billion,
 U.S. exporters, importers, and industrial and
 commercial firms also grant credits to their
 foreign clients; these amount to $2.3 billion
 at this time.
 Of the short-term bank credits, about $1
 billion consist of items held for collection
 largely on behalf of customers.  An addi-
 tional $2.5 billion of the short-term bank
 credits represent bankers acceptances. After
 a long period of inactivity, these have grown
 remarkably since 1960, with the encourage..
 ment of the Federal Reserve System; most
 acceptances are made under arrangements
 that involve exports from the United States.
 Loans to foreign banks and customers today
 amount to about $5.7 billion, of which $2.2
 billion are short term and $3.5 billion are
 term loans.
 THE ANATOMY OF TERM LOANS
 There is  general  agreement that- short-
 term loans by U.S. Banks are indispensable
 as a means of financing U.S. trade and other
 international business that directly benefits
 the U.S. balance of payments.  Sometimes,
 however,  the  question  is  raised-particu-
 larly  by                                                                           those  who   tend  to blame  the
 U.S. balance-of-payments     deficit  on pri-
 vate capital investments abroad-whether
 loans in excess of 1 year serve purposes bene-
 ficial to the U.S. balance of payments.                                                                   To

 The author of this amendment, Senator
 ALBERT GORE of Tennessee, stated that it
 seemed a "foregone conclusion" that the ex-
 emption  of  commercial  bank  term  loans
 would be used to avoid the tax and charac-
 terized it as an "Important loophole."  In
 his  testimony  before the  Senate Finance
 Committee last June, Secretary of the Treas-
 ury Douglas Dillon pointed out that the rise
 in long-term bank loans had started before
 there was any thought of the tax and that,
 in the light of detailed information made
 available to the Treasury, any possible eva-
 sion of the tax through use of bank loans
 could not be "more than 5 percent of the
 total bank loans."
 Changes in direction of the flow of loans to
 less-developed and developed countries have
 been remarkably similar to the changes in
 assure export financing and "normal recur-
 ring international business," the administra-
 tion's proposal and the House-approved bill
 for an interest equalization tax, exempted
 bank loans made in the ordinary course of
 business as well as all obligations maturing
 within 3 years.  Before the tax was enacted
 last September, however, a provision was
 added in the Senate giving the President

 patterns of direct Investment.  Until 2 or 3
 years ago, the direction of the flows had
 been mainly to Latin America and Canada.
 In recent years, most of the term loans have
 gone to Europe, particularly to Italy during
 late 1963 and early 1964, and to Japan.   The
 shifts  in  the  geographic distribution  are
 summed up in the second table.
 Over the past year, changes in bank credits
 abroad, short as well as long term, have been
 particularly influenced by borrowings by Ja-
 pan.                                                                                                                    These have    grown substantially  to
 support the expanding volume of Japanese
 trade   and  business  activity.  In   recent
 months, the rate of bank lending to Japan
 has slowed down.   As noted in these pages
 last    month,  Japan   has  floated  sizable
 amounts of bonds in European markets.

 LET US STAND IN VIETNAM
 (Mr. ZABLOCKI asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. ZABLOCKI.  Mr. Speaker, I know
 you are fully aware of my deep and con-
 tinuing interest in the situation in Viet-
 nam.
 Today I want to reaffirm my view that
 this area must not be permitted to be lost
 to the Communists, either by default or
 by design.
 Whether we like it or not, we have a
 political and moral commitment to the
 people of South Vietnam to assist them
 against  Communist  insurgency  from
 -within, and Communist aggression from
 without.
 This commitment has been confirmed
 by three successive Presidents of the
 United States.
 This commitment cannot be lightly
 dismissed or negotiated away. Unpleas-
 ant as it may be, our choice already has
 been made. We must stand firm in Viet-
 nam.
 This does not mean, Mr. Speaker, that
 negotiations may not ultimately help re-
 solve the situation in Vietnam.  But
 negotiations should not, must not, be
 used as a coverup for surrender. And

 smaller localized organizations all of which
 comprise a vast national Christian army of
 over 10 million patriotic men who are ready
 to defend this Nation against the Red hordes
 that will soon attack the United States.
 Each man needs the following basic equip-
 ment for guerrilla warfare operations.
 1. Any standard rifle of at least .30 caliber.
 2. One good quality hunting knife, 6-inch
 blade.
 3. At least 1,000 rounds of ammunition.
 4. Regulation canteen-holder-webbed belt.
 5. Any suitable type backpack on which
 can be mounted; a good quality sleeping bag;
 a good quality two-man tent.
 6. Three pair of camouflage fatigues of
 heavy duck cloth.
 7. At least one pair of insulated paratroop
 type boots.
 8. Seven-day supply of concentrated food
 packs.
 9. At least 500 water purification tablets.
 10. Snake bite and first aid kit.
 11. One mosquito bar.
 12. One camouflaged waterproof poncho.
 This is a basic equipment list that will
 allow you to operate an an effective guerrilla
 unit.
 We shall fight from the fields, from the
 plains,  from  the  swamps,  and  from  the
 mountains;  and    although  overwhelmingly
 outnumbered in men and equipment we shall
 still be victorious for we have Almighty God
 on our side and at the precise moment his
 heavenly armies will intervene and give us
 the victory through the triumphant return
 of His blessed Son.
 Let us remember the words of our late
 Christian president who was assassinated by
 the anti-Christ Jew-Communists, "I am a
 Berliner," and in the spirit of these brave
 people let us prepare to defend our Christian
 heritage for Almighty God, for Christ, and
 the Nation.

 Mr. DODD.  That is very true.  I do
 not offer these analogies because I think
 think they are exact parallels. The Sen-
 ator understands that, I am sure. There
 are always some differences.  I know
 that. However, we learn from what hap-
 pened in the past, certainly from what
 happened in the near past, and we study
 these happenings in order to learn from
 them.  If others made mistakes, we
 should try to learn how to avoid repeat-
 ing them.  I drew these analogies for
 that purpose. There are other examples
 in history-these are not the only ones-
 but the ones that I drew on are the
 latest and perhaps the most pertinent.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  There was the Ver-
 sailles Treaty and the League of Nations
 covenants, the Kellogg-Briand Treaty,
 and the Lucarno Treaty.  All of them
 contained provisions which were violated
 by the Japanese as early as 1922.
 Mr. DODD.  Yes.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  By Hitler beginning
 about 1932, and by Mussolini at the same
 time. In instance after instance it was
 thought that if we would give in, it
 would be the end of it.
 Mr. DODD.  That is true.  I referred
 to Nuremberg and what we discovered
 there. One of the thinks we learned was
 that at the time Hitler ordered his troops
 to occupy the Rhineland, he had given
 instructions that if they met any op-
 position at all they should immediately
 retreat.  How easy it would have been
 for us to stop him cold then. There was
 considerable dissatisfaction with Hitler
 in his own military circles, and, as we
 know, there was an attempt made later
 to get rid of him.
 We failed in that situation to take the
 appropriate steps.  Our failure enabled
 Hitler to remain in power.
 There were those who said, "Oh, no;
 war would result if we tried to stop Hit-
 ler now, and it would be terrible." We
 did not do what we should have done,
 and in that way a terrible war was
 brought on.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. It has been suggested
 that we negotiate the future political
 status of South Vietnam.  What does
 that mean? Does it mean that we should
 negotiate a new type of government for
 South Vietnam?
 Mr. DODD. I do not know. I do not
 believe that the Senator from New York
 meant it that way. As I understood him,
 he made a good point.  I am sure the
 Senator from Ohio shares my feeling on
 that point. As I understood the Senator
 from New York, we do not want to do
 anything that will give the impression
 that we are for unconditional surrender
 and, on the other hand, we do not want
 to give the impression that we will have
 nothing to do with the Communists.
 That is all that the Senator from New
 York meant, I am sure.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. There is now in exist-
 ence a pact by which we have abided and
 by which the South Vietnamese have
 abided, but which the North Vietnamese
 have violated.
 Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  That is the Geneva
 Pact of 1954.
 Mr. DODD.  The Senator is correct.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  In addition, to that,
 a new agreement was made in 1962, in
 Laos.
 Mr. DODD.  Yes.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  There we followed the
 policy of negotiation.
 Mr. DODD.  Yes. I believe it was in
 1961.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  May I ask whether
 the Laotian agreement worked out as it
 was anticipated it would work out by the
 sponsors of it?
 Mr. DODD.  Not at all.  It could not
 have worked out worse than it did. For
 the people of Laos and the people of
 southeast Asia and for us it has been a
 complete farce. It has been repeatedly
 violated, and it is being violated every
 day.  It is another case of our inability
 to trust those people.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  I commend the Sen-
 ator from Connecticut for his presenta-
 tion, because I believe what he has said
 and what others have said on this point
 will bring home to the minds of the
 America~nn people that what is involved
 is not dierely wanting to be in southeast
 Asia, but that our national security is
 involved. In my judgment, wordsto the
 contrary, are not at this time helpful to
 the achievement of the common objec-
 tive that we seek to achieve.
 Mr. DODD.  I am grateful to the Sen-
 ator for his compliment, which I do not
 deserve, but which I enjoy.
 Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 pointment of the Senator from Vermont
 [Mr. PROUTY] as a member of the Na-

 INCREASE OF FUND FOR SPECIAL
 OPERATIONS  OF  THE  INTER-
 AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, I
 move that the Senate resume to the con-
 sideration of Calendar No. 64, House bill
 45.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 TYDINCS in the chair). The bill will be
 stated by title.
 The LEGISLATIVE CLERK.  A bill (H.R.
 45) to amend the Inter-American De-
 velopment Bank Act to authorize the
 United States to participate in an in-
 crease in the resources of the Fund for
 Special Operations of the Inter-Amer-
 ican Development Bank.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 question is on agreeing to the motion of
 the Senator from Arkansas.
 The motion was agreed to; and the
 Senate proceeded to consider the bill.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, I
 wish to make a brief statement in sup-
 port-of S. 805, a bill to amend the Inter-
 American Development Bank Act to au-
 thorize the United States to participate
 in an increase in the resources of the
 Bank's Fund for Special Operations.
 I say that the statement will be short.
 I do so not as an indication of the
 strength of my support for the meas-
 ure-indeed, I thoroughly approve of
 this bill-but in order to spare Senators
 a complicated and wearisome recital of
 factual material.   A plethora of facts
 and figures will be found in the printed
 material on Senator's desks.   As with
 data on any financial institution, there
 is virtually no end to the figures, charts,
 and tables.  Oversimplification of such
 material in this case may be a service
 rather than a danger.
 I have said that I heartily approve of
 this bill, attd I am sure that my reasons
 for this position will be shared by a great
 number of Senators, for this is the kind
 of foreign assistance activity in which
 the United States should be engaged.
 The purpose of the bill is easily and fully
 identifiable.  The financing is of a kind
 which is particularly suited to the needs
 of friendly countries.  We can readily
 keep track of the process of lending
 through ample public information on
 projects and their results. Self-help and
 responsibility are engendered through
 the participation of the countries being
 assisted. Criteria for eligibility are kept
 high.  And the United States does not
 become embroiled in political squabbling
 or become the target of resentment and
 unseemly pressures.
 However, before elaborating on any of
 these points it is necessary to give at
 least a very simplified explanation of the
 purposes and effects of this proposed
 legislation.  We should start, I think,
 with the important fact that Latin.
 American countries by and large are in
 a position where they find it increasingly
 difficult to service loans for economic and
 social development on conventional or
 hard terms.  In addition, many vitally
 necessary projects in the so-called infra-
 structure category must be undertaken
 as a precursor to overall economic de-
 velopment.  Since these projects do not
 represent an immediate or short-term
 economic return, they generally cannot
 be financed through ordinary banking
 operations. It almost goes without say-
 ing that loans for social projects such as
 housing, technical training, and educa-
 tion require special kinds of financing.
 The need for this kind of lending ac.
 tivity was recognized at the time of the
 Inter-American Development Bank's es-
 tablishment 5 years ago, and a Fund for
 Special Operations was created as a com-
 pletely separate window of the Bank to
 service this requirement.  At the same
 time, the initial resources made available
 to this special Fund were quite modest
 in comparison with the amounts sub-
 scribed toward the ordinary conventional
 lending operations of the Bank.  More-
 over, it was not then recognized how
 closely intertwined were the fields of eco???
 nomic and social development, and the
 Fund for Special Operations was not
 designed as an underwriter of social
 projects.  To fill the resulting gap, the
 United States in 1961 unilaterally con-
 tributed a large sum to be administered
 through yet a third window by the Inter-
 American Bank; this window has been
 known as the Social Progress Trust

 see much sense in classifying this mate-
 rial' and concealing it.  The people do
 not know these facts.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  It is particularly
 important with respect to the arguement
 made by those who would like to see us
 negotiate and neutralize.  The South
 Vietnamese villages are not with us. But
 it is very difficult to have them cooperate
 with us if they are under the grip of
 terrorism and many people in their
 areas are being murdered.  Until we
 give them the security they need, it is
 hard for them to be able to do anything.
 Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, one
 of the things that has not been made
 plain in the overall debate, I feel, is the
 fact that there is a contest of willpower
 in this area.  There is no doubt in my
 mind, from the study that I have made
 of the overall situation, that the Com-
 munists are using the so-called national
 liberalization plan as a test mechanism
 to determine how great the willpower
 of the free world is.  If this plan should
 be successful in persuading us to nego-
 tiate or neutralize, it is inevitable that
 this  technique  will  spread  widely
 throughout the world, through Africa,
 South America, and Latin America.
 It is already being used.  But I be-
 lieve it will be accelerated sharply.                 I
 think the Senator brought that point
 out very well. I congratulate him on
 making a very useful contribution.
 Mr. DODD.  I thank the Senator.
 Mr. MUNDT.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DODD.  I yield.
 Mr. MUNDT. I congratulate the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Connecticut
 for having presented a most conclusive
 and comprehensive statement on this
 whole Vietnamese problem.  It is the
 type of white paper which I hoped the
 State Department would have placed be-
 fore the American people long ago.
 I believe it would still be well for them
 to do so.  In his analysis of the historic
 developments of the problems" and the
 consequences involved in this important
 theater of the world, the Senator leaves
 little doubt as to his accuracy.
 While men may disagree among them-
 selves as to the various processes to be
 used to bring this matter to a successful
 culmination, the matters that the Sena-
 tor has anticipated are the type that
 should emanate from the State Depart-
 ment, carrying the full weight of the ad-
 ministration and the Government.  I am
 sure that would convince many fine
 American citizens, who are beginning to
 doubt their own judgments in these
 areas, as to what is involved.
 I congratulate the Senator on a most
 comprehensive study.  I am happy to
 note the emphasis and the importance
 which the Senator places on it step-up
 political warfare in this area.
 The distinguished Senator from Con-
 necticut has long tried to establish a
 training institution in this country so
 that we could prepare Americans to go
 overseas, for the type of warfare-we wish
 to pursue, with a stable, constituted gov-
 ernment in Vietnam.
 I hope that the State Department,
 which has shown such a stubborn re-
 luctance to provide the type training
 required for this type of warfare, will
 consider carefully the emphasis that the
 Senator places on this particular recom-
 ihendation for future activity.
 The Senator talks about cadres of
 trained political leaders and emissaries
 from these countries who are equipped
 and capable so that they could deliver
 the type of . guidance and inspiration
 needed by our friends in South Vietnam.
 Unfortunately, this is always debated in
 a vacuum in our ability to wage a cold
 war.
 I happen to be one of those who be-
 lieve honestly that had the other body
 approved in 1960 what the Senate then
 did approve, legislation for the creation
 of a freedom academy-following a won-
 derful report written in large part by
 the Senator from Connecticut, as a mem-
 ber of the Committee on the Judiciary,
 emphasizing the need for this adjunct
 to our contest against the Communists
 overseas-we would have had 5 long
 years within which not only to train our-
 selves, but also to provide for young gov-
 ernmental officials and career people in
 the government in Saigon to come here
 and learn the full truth about the tech-
 niques and devices employed by the Com-
 munists. These officials and career peo-
 ple would have learned to understand
 the maneuvers and manipulations of the
 Communist conspiracy, and been trained
 to be better able to convince their fel-
 low citizens on the free side of the Viet-
 namese struggle of the dividends which
 accrue to freedom, and the importance
 of Communists.
 There would not have been the melan-
 cholic succession of quick changes in the
 officialdom  of  South  Vietnam.  We
 would have obtained what all hands
 agree is an indispensable requirement in
 bringing success to our efforts there-
 the creation of a stable government in
 South Vietnam which has not only the
 will to win, but also the respect of the
 local people, so that it in turn would sup-
 port the Government and maintain its
 stability in office, so that the people there
 could get on with the work to be done.
 Mr. DODD.. The Senator gives me
 credit for the idea of the Freedom Acad-
 emy.  It was the idea of the Senator
 from South Dakota.  I was merely a
 minor help in getting it through the
 Senate.  The Senator from South Da-
 kota deserves great credit for it.
 Mr. TOWER.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DODD.  I yield to the Senator
 from Texas.
 Mr. DODD.  I yield to the Senator
 from New York.
 Mr. JAVITS.  The speech of the Sen-
 ator from Connecticut is altogether too
 provocative and he has done his home-
 work altogether too well for him to be
 complimented merely or. a good job.  It
 is a good job, however, and I should like
 to join my colleagues from Texas, South
 Dakota, and other States who have said
 so. Any time the Senator devotes him-
 self to this kind of work, it helps the
 country.
 The Senator from Connecticut has
 done a thorough job in presenting new
 ideas.  This is the place for them, for
 we are not inhibited by the administra-
 tion or its policies, especially when a
 Democrat puts forth a good idea.
 One lack, as I have said before, is that
 retaliation has been pictured as a policy.
 It is not a policy.  It is a reaction.  We
 support it.  We close ranks behind the
 President.   We have common interests in
 it and in the losses.  The losses break
 our hearts, but we try to do something
 about them. However, it is not a policy.
 The Senator from Connecticut is try-
 ing to work out a policy. Whether it be
 a good or a bad policy, he is right
 in trying to work it out, because he pro-
 poses something positive, which takes us
 on a road where there is a big lack. That
 is what is causing doubts among the
 people as to whether this country is going
 to pull out of South Vietnam or go for-
 ward.
 Granting all that I have said, I should
 like to ask the Senator some questions.
 In the first place, the Senator does not
 deal with something that troubles many
 of us, and that is the question, "Is there
 still a majority in South Vietnam who do
 not want communism?  Do a majority
 of the people want to fight against it?"
 We cannot fight a war without soldiers.
 That statement goes whether the fight is
 for an ideology or for freedom.  That is
 one question we must always determine.
 We cannot put our head on other peo-
 ple's shoulders and assume they are
 "buddies."  We may, for example, be
 bitterly opposed in Albania and other
 places, because the people there may
 want communism.  They may like it.
 .That is a very gnawing question with re-
 spect to South Vietnam: What is the at-
 titude of the people of the country?
 Only a declaration of the President of
 the United States can answer.  I know
 that is so often said that it must sound
 like a cliche, but it is the President who
 has the vast reservoir of intelligence
 information.  I think all of us, notwith-
 standing difference of party, would ac-
 cept a declaration on the facts by the
 President of the United States.  We are

 commented on that point; but I pointed
 out that, from all the information I can
 get, the Vietnamese people are over-
 whelmingly in favor of resisting Com-
 munist aggressors.
 I pointed out that the people of Viet-
 nam have a long history of resistance
 against oppression.  I know and I have
 pointed out that many people believe
 that the people of South Vietnam have
 no will to fight, and that communism
 has an attraction for them.  But the
 record shows that at the several different
 periods in their history, when they have
 been under attack, they have demon-
 strated their will to resist.  It was the
 people of Vietnam who successfully re-
 sisted Genghis Khan. In our own time,
 they threw out the French.  And they
 had been free for 500 years before
 the French occupation. They are proud
 of the fact that they threw the French
 out with their army of 500,000 men. So,
 I repeat that the Vietnamese people have
 historically displayed the will to resist
 and they are displaying the same will to-
 day.  They behave very well, in fact.
 And the evidence is that they Are over-
 whelmingly anti-Communist.
 I pointed out that some people say the
 Vietnamese do not know anything about
 freedom, and that it is silly to talk about
 freedom for the Vietnamese. There are,
 however, three or four or five kinds of
 freedom.
 The primitive peasant in the moun-
 tains knows what freedom is.  Many of
 -them have lived under communism, so
 they also know what slavery is.
 The freedom enjoyed by the Vietnam-
 ese peasant I call a natural freedom.
 The peasant can plant his own seed,
 raise his crops and sell his produce. He
 has a family life, he can guide the up-
 bringing of his children, he can elect lo-
 cal officials. If, in addition, the govern-
 ment builds a school, and, dispensary, or
 supplies him with fertilizer, he thinks he
 is about as free as anybody in the world
 can be.
 They do not have to have democratic,
 parliamentary freedom such as we have.
 I do not mean to detract from parlia-
 mentary democracy, but historically it
 is a refined form of democracy.  How-
 ever, it just is not true that the Viet-
 namese people do not know very much
 about freedom.  They do know much
 about it.  They have demonstrated that
 again and again.
 There is another kind of freedom, and
 that is freedom from foreign domination.
 They know the meaning of this, too. As
 I said before, they defeated Genghis
 Khan, and they threw out the French.
 That they have the will to resist com-
 munism is borne out by the fact that 1
 million have fled south.  Roughly 5
 million of them have, atone time or an-
 other, fought the Communists.
 If we make allowance for wives and
 children, that would make a figure of '9
 or 10 out of 14 million. The percentage
 may even be higher.
 Again I repeat that the Vietnamese
 people do have the will to resist.: All they
 want from us is aid to counterbalance
 the  technicians  and  personnel,  and
 weapons that the Communists have been
 pouring in to support the Vietcong
 guerrillas.
 I cannot give the Senator from New
 York the declaration which he wisely
 says we ought to have on Vietnam.  I
 cannot speak In that capacity. I can say
 that, from my information-and I cited
 it-I am convinced that the facts are as
 I have stated them.
 Mr. JAVITS.  The Senator referred to
 the fact that the answer to my question is
 mentioned in his speech. I was not pres-
 ent in the Chamber all the time he was
 making his speech, but I have read it. I
 would not have presumed to ask the Sen-
 ator these questions had I not read it.
 The purpose of my questions is more for
 emphasis.
 The Senator from Connecticut has al-
 ready answered a collateral question in
 the course of his last reply; namely,
 whether the South Vietnamese want our
 help.
 I am pleased to hear the Senator say
 that a declaration by the President on
 this subject would be a good thing. It is
 necessary.  I am not critical, but that
 does not stop us from urging what would
 be good for the country and the world.
 Mr. DODD.  I knew the Senator was
 present.  I was aware of his presence
 while I was speaking.
 I think it is good to do anything that
 would help our people understand where
 they are, and what we are trying to do
 in Vietnam.
 Mr. JAVITS.  One big point being
 made is on the question of negotia-
 tion. The Senator has said that the de-
 mand that ewe negotiate now over
 Vietnam  is  akin  to  having  asked
 Churchill to negotiate with the Germans
 at the time of Dunkirk and President
 Truman to negotiate at the time of
 Pusan. I assume that also goes for Presi-
 dent Kennedy with respect to Castro.
 Let me ask the Senator this question,
 which concerns a Presidential declara-
 tion. I do not know what the answer of
 the Senator will be, therefore I may be
 making a mistake, because a trial lawyer
 should not ask a question to which he
 does not already know the -answer, but I
 believe that-
 Mr. DODD.  That is not what Is
 worrying me. I am worrying as to
 whether I know the answer.
 Mr. JAVITS. It is important that we
 explore  each 'other's  minds  to  see
 whether we agree with each other's point
 of view.
 As the President has stated, we are
 ready to negotiate.  We are ready to
 negotiate if negotiations do not repre-
 sent a sellout of the people of South
 Vietnam or a sellout of the cause of
 freedom.
 I should like that formula better, be-
 cause this is a big question in'the world:
 "Is the United States In a mood for un-
 conditional surrender?"  The Senator
 and every newspaper editor in the world
 know precisely what I mean by that.
 What are we saying here-that some-
 day, somehow, as in the case of the Berlin
 airlift, or other emergencies which looked
 as though they would never be settled,
 some way will be found out of the sit-
 uation?  The same thing occurred in
 Korea.  The day came when there was
 some kind of negotiation, good, bad, or
 indifferent.  Therefore, would the Sen-
 ator, consistent with his conscience and
 his views, subscribe to the proposal that
 we should assert that we are ready to
 negotiate, provided it is not a sellout
 negotiation and not a negotiation for
 face-saving purposes because we wish to
 find a good reason to pull out, but that
 we are ready to negotiate honestly and
 legitimately for a political settlement of
 the issue, now, tomorrow, or at any other
 time?
 Mr. DODD.  Perhaps I could answer
 the Senator's question better and more
 directly if he would tell me what it is
 that he would suggest we negotiate.
 Mr. JAVITS. I suggest that we nego-
 tiate the political future of South Viet-
 nam, or that we encourage South Viet-
 nam to negotiate it, in or out of the
 United Nations, in or out of the Geneva
 conventions, so long as the conditions
 which are the framework of the nego-
 tiations do not show the United States
 to be pulling out of South Vietnam.
 Mr. DODD.  What I am worried about
 is the fact that we already have an
 agreement.  We have already negotiated
 one.  It has been violated.  What do we
 negotiate?  Do we sit around a table
 and say, "You have broken your agree-
 ment.  Stop doing it.  Get back and
 obey its terms."  I suppose that could be
 described as negotiation in a crude sense.
 But it seems to me that this is all we
 have to negotiate.
 I do not like to use the term "negotia-
 tion" when what we are really talking
 about is a breach of covenant.  If I have
 a contract with the Senator from New
 York and I should break it, I believe that
 he would use stronger language than
 negotiation.
 I do not wish to be evasive.  If it
 would help to sit down and talk with the
 Communists, I would be in favor of it.
 But, I have serious doubt that it would
 help us in this crisis.  Certainly, in a
 general sense, the President has stated
 that we are always willing to negotiate.
 If there Is anything, really, to nego-
 tiate, and if it would help, I am sure the
 President would do it.
 I would put it a little differently.  We
 do not know what there is to negotiate.
 We already have an agreement.  We say,
 "We have an agreement which you have
 violated and which has caused some
 trouble.  All you have to do is to retire
 from your aggressions, and cease attack-
 ing your neighbor."  If the Communists
 are willing to talk about this, then I sup-
 pose we should do so.
 Mr. JAVITS.  I have suggested the
 framework for negotiations, and let me
 say that the Senator has just made what
 could be an excellent opening statement
 by the United States in such a negoti-
 ation. I believe that within that frame-
 work, the Senator and I could agree.
 But let me make one further com-
 ment on this subject which is important;
 in debate and in fortifying our own con-
 science on this issue, we must not forget
 that we are supposed to have allies In
 the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization,
 in mutual defense agreements, even in

 would deter them from doing that is the
 presence in Taiwan of a highly trained

 Raising a touchy political issue, the stu-

 January. General Khanh charged at the time
 the generals were plotting a neutralist solu-
 tion for the country's war against the Viet-
 cong-Communist guerrillas. He said Wednes-
 day the five officers were being returned to
 active duty.
 The students asked whether this meant
 that the generals were falsely accused or
 whether General Khanh now is willing to ad-
 mit high-ranking neutralists in his high
 command.
 The Vietcong's clandestine'Radio Libera-

 "with the aim of invading our country and
 enslaving our people."

 VIETNAM ANSWERS SOUGHT
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 What do the Buddhist political leaders of
 Vietnam really want?
 What is the objective of the drumfire of
 propaganda and demonstrations against the
 predominantly  Buddhist  government  of
 Vietnam that began as early as last April-a
 time, unfortunately, when the American Em-
 bassy and the American people had their
 mind on other things?
 In secret meetings in Saigon late last week
 with top Buddhist leaders, Ambassador Max-
 well Taylor tried urgently to find the answers
 to these questions because, among other
 things, he is under pressure from Washing-
 ton to explain increasingly worrisome signals
 as to Buddhist Intentions.
 During the meeting, General Taylor ad-
 dressed most of his questions to the Rever-
 end Thich Tam Chau, a refugee from North
 Vietnam, a genuine anti-Communist in prin-
 ciple  albeit  something of a timid soul in
 practice, and ostensibly the leader of the
 United Buddhist Movement of Vietnam.
 But the answers that really counted be-
 longed to the Reverend Thich Tri Quang, a
 one time associate of the Communist Viet-
 minh, the mastermind of the anti-Diem
 campaign of last summer and fall, and cur-
 rently the spearhead of a deadly struggle for
 power inside the Buddhist movement against
 the Reverend Tam Chou.   Tri Quang is ad-
 ditionally the leader of a sometime open and
 sometime secret drive to topple the Khanh
 regime.
 There are some who say that the Buddhist
 Monk Tri Quang is, next to General Khanh,
 the most  powerful Vietnamese figure  in
 South Vietnam today and that tomorrow he
 may be the most powerful.
 It is of significance therefore that General
 Taylor's telegrams on the Buddhist situation
 produced so many somber faces around the
 Department of State.
 For the time being, at any rate, it appears
 according to Ambassador Taylor's assessment
 that the moderates among Vietnam's nearly
 6 million Buddhists (out of.a population of
 more than 14 million of which the majority
 are ancestor worshippers) are being skillfully
 and relentlessly outmaneuvered by the ex-
 tremist wing led by the Reverend Tri Quang,
 whose flamboyant oratory and calls for direct
 action have far more appeal, for example,
 to Vietnam's citified, riot-prone young people
 than the pleas for caution issued by the Rev-
 erend Tam Chau.
 As to the political game being played by
 the Reverend Tri Quang, a key administra-
 tion official who had read General Taylor's
 telegrams summed things up this way:
 "A defensible case can be made for the
 theory that Tri Quang will sooner or later
 seek to undermine any stable anti-Commu-
 nist government in Vietnam in the belief
 that anarchy will drive the United States to
 go home, permitting the emergence of a neu-
 tralist or possibly pro-Communist state with
 himself at the helm."
 He continued: "If Tri Quang wants to de-
 liver Vietnam to neutralism or communism
 under his own leadership, it would explain
 the mystery of why he raised the false issue
 of persecution which is ridiculous in light of
 all the concessions-indeed the favoritism-
 shown the Buddhists by Khanh's regime.
 "But the cry of Buddhist persecution-as
 Tri Quang well knows-brings an almost
 Pavlovian reaction in the outside world where
 most people are too uninformed and too naive
 to believe that a Buddhist monk might make
 up such accusations out of whole cloth to
 gain his own ends."
 The issue now seems less and less whether
 the Reverend Tri Quang aspires fora neu-
 tralist and pro-Communist Vietnam under
 his leadership.
 It is focusing more and more on the fact
 that his actions are pointing in that direc-
 tion.                                                              The question now is whether any-
 thing can be done effectively to stop him as
 he operates from within the privileged psy-
 chological sanctuary of being a Buddhist
 monk.

 (By Paul W. Ward)
 NEW         YORK, November 4.-Having seen
 Buddhism spearhead a drive that toppled
 Vietnam's Diem regime, Communists now
 are trying to organize like offensives else-
 where in southeast Asia.
 So it was learned here today following an-
 nouncement that a United Nations mission
 sent to South Vietnam October 22 to investi-
 gate charges that Buddhists were being per-
 secuted  there has completed its task and
 will reassemble next Monday In New York.
 IMMEDIATE  TARGET
 Laos, which lies just west of Vietnam
 and also abuts Communist China, appears
 the immediate target of a campaign origi-
 natingin Peiping.  Its aim is to set Buddhist
 communities throughout Asia to filing com-
 plaints against elements of Laos' coalition
 Government akin to those they had been
 pressing against the Diem regime at Saigon
 until it fell last Friday.
 The chief indication was provided in broad-
 casts from Hanoi, in North Vietnam, and
 Peiping reporting that the "Loatian Buddhist
 Association [has issued] a statement strongly
 protesting against the bombardment of a
 monastery by the Phoumi Nosavan troops
 and reactionaries among Kong Le's troops."
 Gen.  Phoumi  Nosavan  heads  the  anti-
 Communist wing of a troika-form govern-
 ment set up in Laos last year to carry out
 an agreement to neutralize that southeast
 Asian kingdom worked out at a Geneva con-
 ference which included the United States,
 the Soviet Union and Communist China
 among Its participants.
 Gen. Kong Le commands the troops of the
 coalition's neutralist factions and enjoyed
 avowed support by Peiping and Hanoi until
 the Communists concluded several months
 ago that he is sincerely neutralist and will
 not help them take over Laos.

 Since then, they not only have been de-
 nouncing him but trying to win over his
 subordinate officers to their side.

 The Laotian Communist radio station, call-
 ing itself the voice of Laos, also broadcast
 the statement attributed to the "Laotian
 Buddhists Association," that  alleged their
 foes had "destroyed a [Buddhist] monastery
 and acting Buddhists" at Ban Ton Nuong in
 Kieng Province's back county by a bombard-
 ment during the night of October 16-17.
 The statement demanded "that the Phou-
 mi Nosavan clique compensate the losses and
 immediately stop all moves against the Bud-
 dhists."  Otherwise, "it would bear full re-
 sponsibility for the consequences," it said,
 adding:
 "All Laotian  monks and Buddhists  are
 urged to strengthen their solidarity, heighten
 their  vigilance, and  resolutely  oppose all
 schemes of the U.S. imperialists and their
 lackeys."
 The  Communists have been denouncing
 the anti-Communist and neutralist factions
 of Laos' coalition government as puppets of
 the United States, just as they formerly de-
 nounced South Vietnam's Diem regime and
 are  currently  trying to discredit on like
 grounds the military junta that displaced it
 Friday.
 To further what began as a Buddhist cam-
 paign against the Diem regime, Communist
 China also staged shortly before that regime's
 fall a 3-day conference of Buddhist clergy
 and laymen from 11 Asian countries.
 Held in Peiping's Fayuan Monastery the
 conference was devoted in large part to ora-
 tions against "the United States-Ngo Dinh
 Diem clique" at Saigon.
 MONKS REPORTED BEHEADED
 Its participants, now touring Communist
 China under the aegis of Peiping atheist
 regime, included:
 1. The Venerable Thich Thien Hao, listed
 as president of the Luc Hao Buddhist Asso-
 ciation of South Vietnam, who made a long
 speech about atrocities, including behead-
 ings and disembowelings of Buddhist monks,
 that he attributed to "the United States-
 Diem. clique."
 2. The  Venerable  Thepbouary  Pramaha
 Khamtank, named as president of the Bud-
 dhist Association of Laos, who charged the
 United States is trying to turn that coun-
 try into a "colony" and demanded that Wash-
 ington cease giving military aid td the Lao-
 tian Government, asserting:
 AUGUST DENUNCIATION
 "We Asian people and Buddhists are the
 masters of our own affairs.  We don't need
 any other masters lording it over and ruling
 us.,,
 Mainland China's Communist rulers, who
 in August denounced as "political agents"
 of Chiang Khai-shek a group of Buddhist
 monks from Formosa then visiting India, also
 brought together in Fayuan Xonastery Bud-
 dhist monks and laymen from Cambodia,
 Indonesia,  Japan,  Korea,  Nepal,  Pakistan,
 Thailand, and North Vietnam, which, like
 Cambodia    and Thailand,   also abuts Laos.
 Having produced on October 20 a formal
 appeal to Buddhists everywhere to join in the
 anti-Diem   campaign,  the  conferees    gave
 themselves over to a series of fetes arranged
 in their honor by the Peiping regime that only
 a few years ago was charged before the Unit-
 ed Nations Assembly here with having de-
 stroyed more than 1,000 Buddhist monas-
 teries in Tibet.
 NORTH VIETNAM CUARGES
 There was no Tibetan participation in the
 Buddhist conference at Peiping.
 North Vietnam's Communist regime has
 sent to the International (i.e., Polish, Indian,
 and Canadian) Control Commission for both
 parts of Vietnam a compilation of "Bud-
 dhist  persecution  and  atrocity"  charges
 against the Diem regime that said in part:

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE              February' 23
 TO HEAD NATIONAL POLICE
 He currently is slated to be Interior Min-
 ister (i.e., chief of police forces) in the new
 regime at Saigon, having turned revolution-
 ist after being refused the same post In the
 Diem regime, according to reports relayed
 from Saigon via Washington.
 Today Moscow's radio stations continued
 to denounce the military junta in Saigon
 just as they previously had denounced the
 Diem regime as an American puppet and
 the United Nations mission to Vietnam as a
 Washington invention designed to protect
 and preserve the Diem regime.
 Meanwhile,  it  was  noted  here  that  in
 Burma, homeland of U Thant, United Na-
 tions Secretary General, the military regime
 in control at Rangoon is under attack from
 the venerable U Kaythara, who, at 83, Is
 the ranking Buddhist priest at Mandalay.
 Addressing mass rallies asembled in defi-
 ance of the regime and overtly inviting ar-
 rest, he has also been predicting that Gen.
 Ne Win, the regime's head, will meet the
 same end as Gen. Aung Sau, Burma's na-
 tional hero, who was assassinated in 1947.
 In a statement relayed from Saigon and
 issued here today, a spokesman for the fact-
 finding mission that headed back to New
 York yesterday contended its departure from
 Vietnam was not occasioned by the coup
 d'etat there, but was "as scheduled," al-
 though in statements prior to the coup the
 mission had claimed inability to estimate
 when it would complete its on-the-spot in-
 vestigation.
 Today's statement also said the mission
 "had not been able to Interview Thich Tri
 Quang  [a Buddhist monk]  who was in
 asylum at the U.S. Embassy" in Saigon.  It
 added that "the former government of the
 republic had informed the mission that, ac-
 cording to the laws of asylum, a person In
 asylum was not allowed to make any con-
 tacts whatsoever while in asylum."
 BURMESE COMPLAINT
 Meanwhile,               there  were  these  additional
 developments at United Nations headquar-
 ters:
 1. James Barrington, Burma's chief dele-
 gate here and its representative in the cur-
 rently recessed disarmament conference at
 Geneva, complained in one of the Assembly's
 standing committees about a tendency to-
 ward  "bilateralism"  by  Washington  and
 Moscow and consequent bypassing of the
 lesser powers, including neutralists, in dis-
 armament matters.
 2. Mrs. Agda Rossel, Sweden's chief dele-
 gate took steps in  another committee  to
 initiate debate on a resolution-sponsored
 also by Austria, Ceylon, Ecuador, Uruguay,
 and Venezuela-that is aimed at getting all
 governments to follow the example Liechten-
 stein set in 1798 by abolishing capital pun-
 ishment.
 During the delivery of Mr.  DODD's
 speech,
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DODD.  I yield.
 Mr. JAVITS.  I believe that my rec-
 ord on the scoreboard of the Americans
 for Constitutional Action is even lower
 than the record of the Senator from
 Connecticut.
 I share with the Senator from Con-
 necticut the feeling that it only demon-
 strates that we are trying in new ways
 to have the government use its powers
 for the people without at the same time
 jeopardizing  individual  freedom.  We
 can only hope and pray that among the
 makers of these arbitrary scoreboards
 there could be a greater reflection of the
 consensus of our own people in our own
 States.  Then I think the scoreboard
 would be very different for the Senator
 from Connecticut and myself.
 Mr. DODD.  I appreciate the Senator's
 making that observation.  Tha Senator
 is one of the great minds in this body.
 He stands out particularly in the area of
 which he has spoken.  I am happy to
 be In his company on that scoreboard.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the colloquy in which I have
 just engaged with the Senator from New
 York be placed at the end of my remarks
 so that I may have my speech in con-
 tinuity.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  Mr. President, am
 I to understand that the Senator from
 Connecticut does not wish to yield?
 Mr. DODD.  I am happy to yield. I
 merely wish that whatever yielding I do
 may appear at the end of my remarks,
 unless there is some reason for it to ap-
 pear elsewhere.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  I have been listen-
 ing to what the Senator has said with
 much interest, because I have visited
 southeast Asia on, many occasions.  I
 have often described to the Senate-and
 I believe my reports will so indicate-
 the situation that was prevalent in south-
 east Asia. I am almost certain that my
 good friend will agree that were he to go
 to South Vietnam now, he would find
 things quite different from what they
 were when he visited that country 4
 years ago.
 Mr. DODD.  I am sure that is true.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  There is no doubt
 about that. On several occasions I made
 the statement on the floor of the Senate
 that unless we could persuade our allies
 to ass'st us in carrying this load-and I
 am sure the Senator agrees that that
 ought to be done-and unless a stable
 government could be established in South
 Vietnam, we would be in serious trouble.
 Mr. DODD.  Yes.  I wholly agree with
 those two points.  I refer to a speech I
 made 4 years ago, In which I made the
 same point. I said I thought it was
 absolutely essential that our friends and
 allies in that part of the world join us in
 the struggle to preserve the freedom of
 the South Vietnamese.  I pointed out-
 and I shall touch on the issue later to-
 day-that there is a basic structural
 fault in the SEATO organization which
 gives a veto power to any one member;
 and, as the Senator knows, that power
 has been exercised by France and Britain.
 We must have a stable government in
 South Vietnam.  The Senator is a well-
 informed Member of this body on these
 problems.  I have great respect for his
 opinions.
 Mr.  ELLENDER.  The  question  I
 should like to ask the Senator is as
 follows: Should we continue to intensify
 our efforts in that area if we cannot get
 our allies to assist us or if a stable gov-
 ernment is not established in South
 Vietnam? That is the question.
 Mr. DODD.  The Senator's question is
 part of a larger question.  There are
 many things we must do. Those are two
 things that we must do. I believe that
 we must get our friends and allies In
 that part of the world to assist us.. We
 are getting them.  Already Korea has
 announced that it is sending men to that
 area.
 Mr. ELLENDER.      Two thousand men.
 Mr. DODD.  Two thousand men. The
 Philippines are sending in several thou-
 sand men. All this is encouraging. They
 are starting, at least.  I would like to
 see other nations do as much or more,
 and I expect that they will.  I believe
 we are underway, and that this is no
 time to quit, because now we have the
 signs and beginnings to indicate that our
 allies are starting to do what the Sen-
 ator from Louisiana and I believe they
 should have done long ago.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  I am not suggest-
 ing that we quit now.
 Mr. DODD.  I know the Senator is not.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  We have gone so
 far into it that we may well find ourselves
 in over our heads.
 What I fear-and I have said so on
 the floor of the Senate and have in-
 cluded it in my reports-is that the sit-
 uation that now exists in South Vietnam
 may become similar to the one that now
 exists in South Korea.  The Senator
 will remember that the South Korean
 war was supposed to be a United Nations
 affair, in which all the membership of
 that great organization was to join us in
 fighting in South Korea.  But what
 happened?  We took hold of the situa-
 tion there; and as I recall the figures,
 96 percent of the cost of that war was
 paid by the United States, and about
 95 percent of the foreign men who died
 in that conflict were Americans.
 Mr. DODD.  I accept the Senator's
 statistics.
 Mr. ELLENDER.  That is as I remem-
 ber them.
 Mr. DODD.  They seem to me to be
 approximately correct.
 Mr. ELLENDER. Today we are stuck.
 as it were, in South Korea.  We are
 trying to maintain 18 local divisions
 there.  It is very costly to do that.  In.
 addition, we are maintaining 2 of our
 own divisions there. As the Senator from.
 Connecticut knows, we cannot pay the
 expenses of our soldiers there with col-
 lar buttons.  It is necessary to have the
 money and the wherewithal to do it.
 What I have feared all along is that
 unless we can persuade our allies to
 assist us in South Vietnam, and unless
 a stable government can be established.
 there, a condition may develop which
 will be worse than the situation that
 confronts us in South Korea.  That is
 what has worried me.
 Mr. DODD.  I know the Senator from
 Louisiana is worried; and so am I.  It
 is a proper problem to worry about.
 There is no question that a stable gov-
 ernment must be established in South
 Vietnam.
 The trouble began, in my opinion,
 with the assassination of Diem.  Diem
 was the best thing we had going for the
 free world in that area, and the tragedy
 of his death still haunts us.
 I hope that at some time the proper
 committee will conduct a formal in-
 quiry as to his overthrow and assassina.-
 tion and what part, if any, officials of the
 U.S. Government played in this tragedy.
 We have never been told anything,

 such as these have been permitted to take
 place In a nation supposedly at war with
 the Communist Vietcong, it can only be

 for chaos?,  Or has it already gone too far?

 POLrrio. HAMPERS VIETNAM'S WAR
 SAIGON,  SOUTH  VIETNAM,  October  17.-
 Maxwell D. Taylor, the U.S. Ambassador, was
 given a poignant insight into the whys of
 Vietnamese politics the other day. Talking
 Socially with a middle-aged politician, the
 Ambassador broached the subject of present
 political pressures from diverse groups on the
 Saigon Government and the possibly harm-
 ful effects of this agitation in the war against
 the Communist Vietcong Insurgents.
 "You Americans view all this In the terms
 of your own country," said the politician, not
 as a reproach but in an effort to let Ameri-
 cans  understand  what  is  going  on  in
 Vietnam.
 You must realize that this period-these
 few weeks-is the first moment in my life-
 time that we Vietnamese are able to partici-
 pate in the normal political interplay your
 democratic  countries  have  enjoyed  for
 decades.
 SEEMING CONTRADICTION
 "Fir,t we were under French domination,
 then came the war and rule by the Japanese.
 After the war we had to choose between the
 French again or joining the Communists.
 Those of us In the south got our independ-
 ence with a non-Communist government
 but Diem kept all political parties down just
 as the French had.
 "When Diem was overthrown it was the
 army that ran everything.  They let us poli-
 ticians talk in the open but nothing we said
 ever seemed to have any effect on the deci-
 sions of the military government.
 "Now at last we are able to act as real citi-
 zens, not just as tools of one or another
 group which, holds all the power, whether
 spokesmen  of  the  people  like  it  or  not.
 There's nothing disloyal about politics.
 The conversation, trivial in itself, never-
 theless made an impression on Ambassador
 Taylor, who now freely admits that his fre-
 quent visits to Vietnam as Chairman of the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff, did not prepare him for
 the political complexities and struggles he
 faces In the role of, Ambassador.
 Gradually U.S. officials are discovering a
 seeming contradiction underlying American
 and Vietnamese attitudes toward the war
 effort against the Vietcong.  From this con-
 tradiction comes American. impatience with
 Vietnamese intramural quibbling over forms
 of government.  From it comes also Viet-
 namese, suspicions about American motives
 here, suspicions that are only increasing.
 COLD WAR TRENCH
 To Americans, Vietnam seems to be a
 trench in the cold war, a chosen battlefield
 for the. non-Communist world to confront
 Communist expansionism.
 The Vietnamese do not see their plight in
 these terms at all. The upheavals of the last
 2 months have made abundantly clear.  To
 the articulate Vietnamese, the struggle is to
 build a viable nation and government, a gov-
 ernment of justice truly representative of
 what the leading forces of society want. For
 too long they have lived under a government
 and policies imposed upon them by outside
 influence.  Communism would be another of
 these outside influences, but perhaps so now
 is the American notion of winning a war at
 whatever cost by whatever government.
 THE COMING STORY
 Resolution of this contradiction will be the
 story of South Vietnam in the months to
 come.
 Considering the ' lack of political oppor-
 tunity, the fumblings of the Vietnamese in
 their quest for representative and just gov-
 ernment should come as no surprise.
 Nor is the accumulation of transitory po-
 litical institutions-piled up in a haphazard
 and seemingly self-nullifying manner-alien
 to Vietnamese experience as any examination
 of the postwar years under the French will
 show.
 At the top of the political pile now is an
 ad hoc body of 17 men called the High Na-
 tional Council.  Appointed September 26 by
 Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh, the chief of
 state, after consultations with leading reli-
 gious and social groups of the nation, the
 council is designed to resemble a representa-
 tive asembly, not for the purpose of govern-
 ing the country but only for deciding how
 the country should be governed.
 The constitution it produces is supposed to
 be provisional,  the personnel  installed in
 high office only temporary, until some kind
 of national elections can be held.
 The 17 men are a strange mixture.  Only
 a few have any personal political futures or
 ambitions.
 So remote from immediate cross-currents
 of politics does the council seem that many
 Vietnamese have dubbed it the "High Na-
 tional Museum." To American policymakers
 and Vietnamese officials, however, the coun-
 cil is the only available link between the tor-
 mented past and the promised land. Seldom
 has so much international stress been placed
 on such a weak link.
 The extent of the council's responsibilities
 is unclear, the demands put upon it are
 enormous  and  diverse.  So-called  civilian
 government is the goal, but Premier Nguyen
 Khanh has insisted that the armed forces
 must have "a place of honor" in the gov-
 ernment to compensate the military estab-
 lishment for its sacrifices in defending the
 nation on the battlefield.
 The religious and political groups pressing
 for civilian government have not made clear
 whether they will be satisfied with civilian
 ministers alone or whether they will press
 further for military officers to be replaced as
 chiefs of some-or even all-of the country's
 45 provinces.
 Once the principles of government struc-
 ture are determined, who are to be the per-
 sonalities to fill leading posts?  Some politi-
 cal groups insist that only immediate elec-
 . tions can bring forth leaders truly claiming
 the confidence of the people. Others recog-
 nize the difficulty of holding elections in the
 midst of a guerrilla war and propose instead
 the naming of "acceptable" persons as yet
 another interim measure.
 Whether this course would solve anything
 is open to question since the ideal of a popu-
 larly supported government would remain
 remote.
 .. Yet this is the ideal ever before Vietnamese
 political figures these days as they luxuriate
 .try the. democratic interplay they missed for
 so long.
 WAR IS NOT THE ISSUE
 If it all sounds remote from the war in the
 countryside, it is.  The campaign against a
 purposeful Communist enemy is not much
 3293
 of an issue in the political jousting of Sai-
 gon.                                                                                                                                No agitation group admits to being
 neutralist;  even the most intransigent of
 politicians can be at same time sincerely
 anti-Communist.
 The   political  groups making  the  most
 headway among the people outside of Sai-
 gon-the Central Vietnamese Political Move-
 ment led from Hue University is a prime
 example-are not openly advocating a cease-
 fire or a negotiated settlement with the Viet-
 cong and suspicions to this effect once ex-
 pressed are vehemently denied with seeming
 conviction.
 If the war is not an issue and all groups
 wish to continue the anti-Communist strug-
 gle and that is the end of the story, American
 policymakers should be able to sit back and
 await with equanimity the outcome of Viet-
 nam's  first  self-conscious adventure  with
 democracy. But, of course, this is not the
 end of the story and the Americans realize
 perhaps more clearly than the Vietnamese
 that the Communists are moving effectively
 into the governmental vacuum, in the coun-
 tryside at least.
 American officials maintain they have no
 ready answer to Vietnamese political striv-
 ings, no ideal government structure to pro-
 pose.                                                                                                                                      This time they are willing to let the
 Vietnamese work out their own government
 just the way they want it.  But what the
 Americans in contact with members of High
 National Council are encouraging is rapid
 adjustment and conciliation toward some
 common denominator-anything in fact that
 would restore the central direction to the war
 effort that has been lacking since Premier
 Khanh stepped down as President last Au-
 gust 25.
 So the interplay goes on and no end is in
 sight.  The stable and popular government
 that the Vietnamese seek and that the Amer-
 icans hope will arrive from somewhere before
 it is too late seems as remote as ever.

 BUDDHIST POWER GROWS-IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 THEY  HAVE  CREATED  A  STRUCTURE THAT
 DRAWS THE LOYALTY OF MANY PERSONS
 (By Peter Grose)
 SAIGON, SOUTH VIETNAM, September 12.-
 A Buddhist revolution is taking place in
 South Vietnam.  Its lines and goals are still
 far from clear even to many of the Buddhists
 themselves, but seasoned observers consider
 it the most significant and far-reaching trend
 in present-day southeast Asia.  Its implica-
 tions stretch far beyond the frontiers of this
 country.  They extend not only to nations
 nearby but also, because of Buddhism's un-
 clear relation to the Ideology and power of
 communism, the Vietnamese experience could
 alter the entire power structure the United
 States has been fighting to maintain in the
 southwestern Pacific.
 The Buddhists seem to be gambling that
 they can produce a new basis for stability.
 So far what has actually happened is that
 the American-supported Premier of South
 Vietnam, Maj. Gen. Nguyen Khanh, has ac-
 cepted in general and in detail an immediate
 Buddhist formula for reforming his Govern-
 ment along new civilian lines.  This is the
 outcome, now apparent, of this country's
 political crisis last month.
 PREMIER FIRST
 That crisis was the second step in an evolu-
 tion starting 16 months ago.  The first step
 was reached last November, when 9 years of
 rule by President Ngo Dinh Diem collapsed
 in a bloody coup d'etat.  Both the Buddhists
 and the Vietnamese Army contributed  to
 President Diem's downfall, but the Buddhists
 were neither organized nor motivated to fill
 by themselves the void left when President
 Diem was removed.
 Since November 1 the army has governed
 South Vietnam.  On January 13 there was a
 change in leadership-General Khanh took

 over where a junta had failed to get off the
 ground but throughout his first 7 months
 in power the army remained Premier Khanh'a
 principal base of support, his only real claim
 to hold power in a land torn by war and
 popular dissent.
 Now the Military Revolutionary Council,
 the instrument of army rule, has been dis-
 banded.  A constitution that seemed to in-.
 stftutionalize military dictatorship was with-
 drawn.  Premier Khanh is in the process of
 easing his former military cronies out of their
 Government positions.  Many have already
 resigned.
 "I am still a general," Premier Khanli said
 the other day, "but I am Premier first."
 The  former  field  commander  now  wears
 civilian clothes.  He has shaved off the little
 goatee he sported throughout the military
 phase of his rule.  He never stated publicly
 why he had grown this beard in the weeks
 preceding his coup d'etat, but from the smiles
 and jokes of officers around him it is clear
 the goatee had a certain barrack-room sym-
 bolic value to the military clique that helped
 him into power.  Now both the goatee and
 the clique are gone.
 NEW FOUNDATION
 The full story of why the army gave up so
 easily has yet to come out-maybe it was
 only a tactical retreat to prepare for new
 power plays, perhaps by a younger genera-
 tion of colonels.  Some elements would have
 the people believe there were secret Induce-
 ments-that is to say, money-that per-
 suaded certain individuals to abandon their
 claims to power.  More likely the generals
 felt an onrush of frustration and helpless-
 ness from 10 unpleasant months in power,
 even a feeling that they might as well get
 out while the going was still good.
 However It happened, the army says it has
 abandoned its foray into politics and now
 theoretically will return to the business of
 fighting a war.  Political power is forming
 on a new foundation.
 Spokesmen In the Buddhist hierarchy will
 firmly  deny any  political  aspirations  for
 themselves as persons or for Buddhism as
 such.   They are speaking, they say, solely In
 the name of the Vietnamese people of what-
 ever religion.
 A coon  CLAIM
 In fact, Buddhist leaders have as good a
 claim as anyone else, and better than many,
 for presenting the views of "the people," for
 Buddhism is the family religion of the vast
 majority of Vietnamese. It has been so for
 centuries.  Premier Khanh himself has long
 had a Buddhistshrine to his parents in his
 house.
 Figures are difficult and misleading since
 there are a few criteria for claiming to be a
 Buddhist. Out of a population of 14 million
 an estimated total of 5 or 6 million people
 are practicing Buddhists responsive to the
 voice of the hierarchy.  Many more who say
 they are Buddhists if asked pay little more
 than lipservice to any religion.  Others ad-
 here to Buddhist-oriented sects that never-
 theless shun the central Buddhist organi-
 zation.
 Furthermore, there are clear geographical
 distinctions of attitude among even the most
 faithful of Buddhists.  Until recently the
 most politically active were bonzes, or monks,
 from North Vietnam who had fled to the
 south to escape     Communist rule.  They
 gravitated toward Saigon, establishing their
 own pagodas' separate from the pagodas of
 their brothers native to South Vietnam.
 Northerners are .outspoken In their opposi-
 tion to communism and have supported the
 military government in active prosecution of
 the war against the Communist Vietcong.
 The best known spokesman for the North-
 ern refugees is Thich Tam Chau, who holds
 the position of rector, or chairman of the
 Buddhist Secular Institute. the organiza-
 tional center of Buddhist political activity.
 At the opposite extreme In zeal are the
 Buddhists of the far south, the populous and  thirties of early forties, all appointed, like
 rich Mekong Delta. In this area the orthodox  the Government's province chiefs, by their
 hierarchy is weak, laymen have greater in-    own administration in Saigon.

 Buddhism.   Vietnamese Buddhists is pre-
 dominantly "mahayana," or "greater vehicle,"
 in which the Buddha is deified.
 HARDEST TO DEFINE
 it Is the Buddhists of central Vietnam who
 have spurred the most significant recent ad-
 vances into politics.  Their Intellectual cen-
 ter is at Hue.                                                                          These are the Buddhists hard-
 est to understand or define in political terms.
 They profess anticommunism and antineu-
 tralism, but they also seem far from happy
 with the present American policy for fighting
 the war.
 Their  undoubted  leader  is  Thich  Trl
 Quang, considered by many the mastermind
 of last year's Buddhist revolt against Presi-
 dent Diem.  By seeking refuge in the U.S.
 Embassy a year ago, he forced the U.S. Gov-
 ernment to take sides with the Buddhists
 against the Diem government, which was
 trying to arrest Buddhist leaders.
 Though Tri Quang lacks Tam Chau's pres-
 tigious position as head of the Secular In-
 stitute, he seems now to be the most influen-
 tial single Buddhist In the country.  There
 are some observers who look upon his politi-
 cal skills as setting the pattern for Buddhism
 throughout southeast Asia.
 A long-term Buddhist revolution is taking
 place both within the movement and In the
 country at large.  Its goal is undefined.  Its
 purpose, according to the bonzes, is to "pro-
 tect Buddhism."                                                                                 Neither the meaning of
 this phrase nor the means to realize it have
 been made clear to nonbelievers.
 A basic strain within the movement is the
 whole question of whether Buddhism should
 deal  in  temporal  politics.   Any  typical
 Buddhist declaration  will  be  couched   In
 terms of religion, shunning partisan involve-
 ment in worldly political matters.                                                                                 Bonzes
 such as Tri Quang will evade difficult political
 gtfestions by insisting they are solely men of
 religion and not competent to speak on mat-
 ters of politics.
 DRIVE REMOVED DOUBT
 Considering their role last year and this,
 it is difficult to refrain from charges of hy-
 pocrisy on this point.  Any doubt about the
 potential political strength and interests of
 at least some Buddhist leaders was removed
 in their campaign against President Diem.
 With the November coup their effective-
 ness seemed ended for the moment, since
 they had no viable organization capable of
 retaining political control after 10 centuries
 of  relative  noninvolvement.   Quickly but
 quietly this was changed.
 Starting on January 3, when the "Vietnam
 Unified Buddhist Church" came into being,
 the Buddhists under Tam Chau and Tri
 Quang have established a shadow govern-
 ment across the country, a shadow rapidly
 assuming substance.  At the top there are
 two "institutes,"  one for religious affairs,
 which has nominal and honorific responsi-
 bilities  equivalent to those of a chief of
 state, and the other for secular affairs, which,
 like a premier, wields actual power over the
 organization.
 POLITICAL STRUCTURES
 In the secular institute there are six "gen-
 eral offices," resembling ministries, for clergy
 affairs,  Buddhist  studies,  cultural  affairs,
 construction and finance, lay peoples' affairs,
 and youth.    Each general office is headed by
 a commissioner.
 Down in the provinces there are delegates
 and deputies, all bonzes, mostly In their
 test-little has so far  been  demanded  of
 the Buddhist population by their leaders.
 But many observers think the test will come
 in the next months as long as Premier Khanh
 leans more and more heavily on apparently
 the one non-Communist element of the na-
 tion that has not yet been brought into
 active participation in the Government.

 The paper also backed rebellious-students'
 charges that Americans triggered the recent
 bloody clashes between Buddhists and Ro-
 man Catholics in the northern city of Da
 Nang.
 PROTEST
 More student trouble developed yesterday
 as Saigon's politically active student union
 denounced the ruling military government
 for not creating a promised "high national
 council" quickly enough.  The council is to
 take steps within 2 months toward setting
 up a civilian government by late next year.
 Hai Trieu Am, in voicing the Buddhist
 charges, said that "if one wishes to learn the
 deep reasons for the anger of the people of
 Da Nang, one must find them in the August
 16  constitution,  which  certainly  was not
 drafted by Maj. Gen. Nguyen Khanh."
 INFLUENCE
 The inference was that the Military Revo-
 lutionary Council, which approved the con-
 stitution,  as  well  as                                                                                                                                            strongman  General
 Khanh were influenced by the United States.
 The  constitution,                                  under which General
 Khanh was elevated from Premier to Presi-
 dent and given sweeping powers, was re-
 scinded In response to violent rioting  and
 Buddhist demonstrations.  General Khanh.
 reverted to Premier and became the domi-
 nant member of the ruling military triumvi-
 rate.                                                                                                                                On Wednesday he also took over the!
 Defense Minister's post.
 The Buddhist publication criticized Ameri-
 can press reports of Buddhists' razing of the
 Catholic sector of Da Nang, charging they
 failed  to indicate  the real  causes  of the
 rioting.
 Asserting that "since the distant past until
 the arrival of Americans here, Buddhists have
 never destroyed or burned any houses," Hai
 Trieu Am said that "the immediate reason
 (for anger in Da Nang) was the shots fired
 in the air by Americans."
 U.S. soldiers had fired shots in the air to
 disperse Buddhist demonstrators who tried
 to break into the U.S. Army compound In
 Da Nang.
 The student union, meeting ostensibly to
 debate criteria for prospective civilian states-
 men's conduct, denounced former U.B. Am-
 bassador Henry Cabot Lodge for  allegedly
 being soft on the late President Ngo Dinh
 Diem.  It charged that Mr. Lodge recently
 told a Paris audience that Mr. Diem, who
 was overthrown and slain in last November's
 coup, might have survived if he had been a
 better President.
 The students termed this "a flagrant inter-
 ference in the affairs of Vietnam."

 Political observers in Saigon were watching
 closely reactions of Vietnam's ranking Bud-
 dhist layman, Mal The Truyen, who returned
 home Friday from a World Buddhist con-
 ference in India.
 Mr. Truyen is a vice president of the world
 body but, more importantly for Vietnamese
 Buddhism, he is a member of the High Na-
 tional  Council,  the  Saigon  government's
 interim legislature.
 Mr. Truyen has not joined the recent Bud-
 dhist protests and is regarded by some as the
 best hope for getting antigovernment Bud-
 dhist priests together with the government
 of Premier Tran Van Huong.
 The Vietnamese Commissioner General for
 Buddhist Youth Affairs, Thich Thien Minh,
 said Vietnamese Buddhists had striven hard
 to live up to "Lord Buddha's teachings of
 compassion and altruism."  He said the best
 way for Buddhists to combat communism
 was to come together in one united, cen-
 tralized body to advance the Buddhist ide-
 ology and eliminate social injustice.
 DISSENT INDICATED
 In another quote, the State Department in
 Washington termed a letter written to Presi-
 dent Johnson by another Saigon Buddhist
 leader, Thich Tam Chau, "a propaganda de-
 vice and not an appropriate means of com-
 municating with the President of the United
 States."  The priest had written charging
 Premier Huong's government with oppress-
 ing Buddhism.
 Meanwhile there has been evidence that
 not all  Buddhists follow the  protesting
 priests. It is known that many of the monks
 in        the vanguard  of last year's struggle
 against the Ngo Dinh Diem rule have opposed
 the current anti-Huong campaign. At least
 one of them, Thich Due Nghiep, has been
 denounced by the North Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment
 Thich Due Nghiep has opposed the anti-
 Huong demonstrations and urged priests to
 take to the countryside to preach against the
 Vietcong.
 Perhaps his followers are gaining ground.
 A week ago violent demonstrations. and self-
 immolation by priests was predicted.  But
 they failed to materialize.  The same pre-
 dictions have been made again.
 NEW  AGITATION
 The Government has obviously mustered
 some support for its position and has suc-
 cessfully clamped down an troublemakers.
 Btft some sources report agitation now is
 strong in the large cities of Rue and Da
 Nang farther north where Saigon control Is
 less effective.
 Meanwhile, the Saigon government has ad-
 mitted that the Buddhists are not the only
 factionalists dividing South Vietnam.
 It announced the formation of an Armed
 Forces Council to iron out differences be-
 tween the old guard officers and the "young
 Turks,"
 And Chief of State Phan Khuc Suu has
 proposed that seven new members be added
 to the High National Council.  He suggested
 names representing the south, central, and
 north sections of the country In order to try
 to overcome regional factionalism.

 SAIGON  SCHISM:  BUDDHIST  STRUGGLE  SAPS
 FIGHT  AGAINST  COMMUNISTS
 (By Takashi Oka)
 SAICoN. The    struggle  between Premier
 Tran Van Huong and the Buddhist leadership
 continues, and South Vietnam is the loser.
 Neither side talks to the other except in
 propagandistic appeals to the population.
 Each day of political Instability at the center
 makes more difficult the task of pacification
 against Communist insurgents in the coun-
 tryside.
 Washington, engaged in intensive review
 of its Indochina policy, must decide whether
 or not continuation of military and economic
 aid on the present scale of more than $500
 million a year can bring victory against the
 Communists without taking the war into
 North Vietnam.
 It must also decide how this aid can most
 effectively be used as leverage to promote
 political stability within South Vietnam.
 It is the second of these two tasks that
 preoccupies the American Embassy here these
 days.  Washington formally supports  the
 Tran Van Huang government, which came
 into being according to provisions of the
 October 20 constitution and which cannot
 legally be overthrown unless the 1b-man-High
 National Council votes it out.
 Yet there is full recognition that Buddhism
 in South Vietnam constitutes a powerful
 political force, that leaders of the Buddhist
 hierarchy have been dissatisfied with the
 Huong government from its inception, and
 that whatever legal rights and wrongs of the
 situation, an all-out confrontation between
 Buddhists and the government can benefit
 no one but the Communists.
 REGIME  ATTACKED
 Americans have, therefore, sought to keep
 an open bridge between the government and
 Buddhist leadership.                                 But the task becomes
 more difficult with each passing day.
 Saturday Thich Tam Chau, one of the
 Buddhist hierarchy's two most prominent
 leaders, held a press conference bitterly at-
 tacking the Huong government.
 The following day he permitted a student-
 sponsored funeral procession for a youth
 killed  in  government-student clashes  last
 week to start out from Buddhist headquar-
 ters, the Vien Hoa Dao or Institute for Exe-
 cution of Dharma.
 Buddhist sources say Vien Boa Dao will
 call for popular noncooperation with the
 government.
 A nightly program of loudspeaker broad-
 casts from within Vien Hoa Dao Is to be
 launched this week.  Those who gather In
 streets to listen will do so at their own
 risk, presumably.
 BUDDHISTS ACCUSED
 The government accuses the Buddhists of
 mixing religion and politics by using the re-
 ligious prestige of the hierarchy to promote
 secular causes such as the overthrow of the
 government.  Thich Tam Chau responds that
 "all things in the world are related."
 To an observer the Buddhist hierarchy
 seems to be testing its strength with the
 people.  Last August's events have 'already
 proved that on some issues they can win
 overriding popular support.
 Whether this support will stay with them
 on lesser issues is problematical.  But the
 Huong-Buddhist confrontation has had a
 snowballing effect.  What seemed bridgeable
 and nonessential at the start has built up
 into a major test of strength from which
 neither now can afford to withdraw.

 PAINFVL VERDICT IN VIETNAM
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 Key U.S. officials in Vietnam have come to
 a painful but significant conclusion.  It is
 that a tiny faction of Vietnamese-too clever
 to reveal their motives and too powerful for
 comfort-are bent on using the cloak of re-
 ligion as a cover for undeclared warfare de-
 signed to prevent the emergence of a stable
 government in Vietnam.  In other words.
 whenever any regime in Saigon shows any
 sign of being able to govern the drive to
 topplp it will begin.
 There are some dissenters from this view
 in the Embassy in Saigon. But this conclu-
 sion is nonetheless held widely and strongly
 enough to explain why the Embassy gave the
 strongest sort of backing to the decision of
 Vietnam's new premier, Tran Vail Huong,
 last weekend to can out the army to repress
 the   Buddhist-instigated   demonstrations
 against his fledgling government.
 WILY MONK
 Thus Tran Van Huong's new regime, fcr
 whom practically nobody has great hopes, is
 momentarily one up on the wiliest, slickest
 demagog In Vietnam, the Buddhist monk,
 Thich Tri Quang, who, Americans believe,
 was behind last weekend's initial attempt
 to topple the latest Saigon regime, just as
 he had previously mastermined the toppling
 of Ngo Dinh Diem and Gen. Nguyen Khanh.
 But in this matter of government toppling,
 the smart money is on Thich Tri Quang, es-
 pecially if his boasts of having swung some
 personalities of the Catholic, Cao Dal, and
 Hoa Hao faiths into his camp, are at all
 true.
 It has taken some time for U.S. officials
 to permit themselves to face the fearsome
 and indeed awesome truth about Thich Tri
 Quang.  Of late, Ambassador Maxwell Tay-
 lor in Saigon and State Department officials
 in Washington have  taken  to  describing
 Thich Tri Quang as "the_ Makarios of south-
 east Asia."
 There used to be brisk arguments among
 Americans in Saigon and Washington as to
 whether Thich Tri Quang, who once served
 with the Communist Viet Minh and whose
 two brothers serve Ho Chi Minh, is "still a
 Communist."
 It is only recently that Americans have
 begun to realize that this begs the real issue
 which is whether Thich Tri Quang serves
 Communist ends.  And the answer here is
 that if the Vietcong themselves had been
 writing the scenario as to how any given
 Buddhist monk could play into their hands,
 they could not have improved on the real
 life doingsof Thich Tri Quang, including his
 current attempt to topple the new civilian
 government.
 For if Thich Tri Quang and his followers
 can, by demonstrations, riot, and propaganda
 successfully keep on perpetuating the near
 chaos that has prevailed from the top down
 in Vietnam, it is just a matter of time 'until
 the Vietcong take over the country - from
 within.
 The civilian regime of Tran Van Huong re-
 quired great courage to proclaim the separa-
 tion of politics from religion, because if this
 much needed step were carried out it would
 checkmate  some  of  the  antigovernment
 troubles masterminded by Thich Tri Quang.
 It would, as a few examples:
 End the vigilante squads of Buddhists who
 have taken law into their own hands in
 the provinces and arrested Catholics on the
 pretext that they are Diemists (it Is a pre-
 text because almost all educated Vietnamese
 worked for the government between 1954 and
 1963 and hence were Dlemists).
 End the system where triumvirates of
 Buddhists are attached to Vietnamese bat-
 talions with the divisive and dangerous habit

 At Bienhoa, 20 miles outside of Saigon, a
 new papermill will officially begin produc-
 tion today.  The opening will culminate 26
 months of construction work, frequently in-
 terrupted by skirmishes between Vietnamese
 troops and the Vietminh.
 At Anhoa, 530 miles north of Saigon, work
 on a giant Government industrial complex
 is moving steadily ahead, despite frequent
 incursions by guerrillas.
 The first phase of the project, including a
 coal mine, a hydroelectric plant, a nitrogen
 fertilizer plant, and a calcium-carbide plant,
 is` about 75 percent completed and should
 be finished by early next year.
 INTERNATIONAL TEAMWORK
 The Cong Ty Ky Nghe Giay Vietnam pulp
 and paper mill was completely built by the
 Parson  &  Whittemore-Lyddon  organiza-
 tion, with a team of workers and technicians
 that    included   Vietnamese, Americans,
 Canadians, Taiwan     Chinese, Frenchmen,
 Germans, Indians, and Swiss.
 The plant was built under difficult condi-
 tions.                       An American executive who visited
 the site said that workers were frequently
 the target of snipers-particularly occidental
 workers.
 The mill; which will produce newsprint
 and writing paper,  i6--owned  by the Viet-
 namese Government.                         Foreign exchange for
 the purchase of machinery was provided by
 the Agency for International Development,
 and Parsons & Whittemore has subscribed for
 19 percent of the share capital.
 The Anhoa site, less than 100 miles south
 of the 17th parallel, partitioning Vietnam,
 was selected for the industrial complex be-
 cause of the coal deposits at nearby Nong-
 son.
 The Industrial project in the populous
 province of Quangnam, was aided by a $1.7
 million grant from the Development Agency,
 $400,000 of which was used to purchase a
 fleet of 14 pieces of 'construction equipment
 from Allis-Chalmers International.
 The Nongson coal mine is already in opera-
 tion and last year produced some 200,000
 tons of anthracite.
 A SECOND PHASE
 The second phase of the giant project,
 which is also owned by the Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment, is scheduled for completion by
 1968,  This phase will include a caustic-soda
 plant, a glass factory, a cement plant, a dry-
 ice plant and several other producing facili-
 ties.
 A third phase,  which  will  depend  on
 whether more coal can be found in the Nong-
 son bed, will include development of nearby
 magnetite, hematite, gold, copper, lead, and
 other metal deposits and a factory for ore
 concentration.
 The French and West German Govern-
 ments have also made grants to assist the
 Anhoa-Nongson complex.
 The project area is accessible by a rail-
 road, two highways, and the Thubon River.
 Because of heavy guerrilla activity, however,
 military helicopter is often the only safe
 way' of reaching the development.
 One American technician, who recently
 returned from working on the complex, said
 that the first thing he was issued when he
 arrived was an M-1 rifle.

 VIETNAM
 (By Robert R. Brunn)
 WASHINGTON.-Communist   North  Viet-
 nam's woes are giving sizable encouragement
 to the South Vietnamese regime and the
 United States
 Some kind of a respite is being offered
 hard-pressed American officials dealing with
 the guerrilla war.  They argued that now is
 the time to place aggressive pressure on the
 Communist forces.
 Self-admitted weaknesses of the Hanoi
 government of North Vietnam, some rather
 surprising assumptions by the Communists,
 and U.S. intelligence assessments add up in
 this way:
 Hanoi grimly assumes that the anguish-
 provoking war will continue, without any
 question through 1964 and beyond.  This is
 despite Washington's acknowledgement that
 the next 4 months are "crucial."
 Hanoi  is  combating  the  widening un-
 popularity of the war in the south which
 is draining off resources from a seriously de-
 pressed                                                                      economy.    Apathy  often   charac-
 terizes the civilian attitude.
 MOSCOW REJECTION
 Last year's North Vietnamese harvest was
 at least 20 percent below 1962's middling
 harvest. Some starvation is visible but there
 is no general disaster in sight.
 Moscow has flatly turned down a direct
 Hanoi plea for aid to support the war.  The
 North Vietnamese reason that they can't af-
 ford  to                                                                  turn  their  backs  politically   on
 Peiping, and that Peiping's gasping economy
 can give them little help in terms of food
 or weapons.
 Morale among the Communist Vietcong
 troops in the guerrilla war is a continuing
 problem for the North Vietnamese Govern-
 ment.  Analysis have seen absolutely no evi-
 dence that the division between pro-Peiping
 and pro-Moscow camps seriously hampers
 the war effort, as such.  The major Hanoi
 decision to side openly with Peiping was
 bound to leave a disappointed minority but
 there have been no demotions, no dissident
 voices raised.
 Hanoi has a healthy, decisive respect for
 U.S. military power and sees the superior
 weapons, equipment, and manpower of the
 South Vietnamese are still a major obstacle
 to victory.  The Communists fear an escala-
 tion of the war, bringing an open U.S. inva-
 sion of North Vietnam, and this has tended
 up to now to keep the Communist military
 effort within a limited framework.
 While the Vietcong at times' has its guer-
 rillas at battalion strength, they are in no
 position to coordinate such units in massive
 movements against the South Vietnamese.
 One factor Is the lack of well-anchored sup-
 ply bases for such operations.
 Neutralization of North Vietnam is con-
 sidered to be utterly out of the question in
 the minds of the Hanoi regime.
 Much of the above analysis comes out of a
 careful American study of the most impor-
 tant statement made by the Hanoi govern-
 ment in several years.
 PROTRACTED TRIALS
 it was spelled out In two articles in the
 January and February issues in Hanoi's prin-
 cipal journal, Hoc Tan, and a third article
 in the newspaper Nhan Dan.
 This official line laid down by the articles
 in Hoc Tan is designed to seep down through
 the ranks of the faithful and be imported to
 South Vietnam and discussed by the fighting
 guerrillas, observers here believe.
 When the articles speak of new, hard, long,
 protracted trials in the war and use the word
 "protracted" over and over again, the signal
 is that the Hanoi Communists are not think-
 ing In terms of a rapid termination of the
 war or the Imminent defeat of the South
 Vietnamese army,
 On the contrary, the Communists expect a
 mounting military initiative in South Viet-
 nam and complain that often they will have
 to meet modern weapons with rusty nails
 and crossbows.
 ECONOMIC DRAIN
 Analysts emphasize there is no widespread
 disaffection in North Vietnam.  The farm
 situation is grim but not beyond hope.
 But there is little doubt there is a solid
 body of opinion in the north that the never
 ending war is the primary cause for the weak-
 ness of their economy.
 The war in South Vietnam is seen here an
 basically an indigenous one, gaining in its
 support from within Vietnam.  It is a dirty
 war and one which has its grim aspects for
 the Communists who have had no spectacu-
 lar victories.  These magazine articles were
 designed to buck up the morale of the fight-
 ing men.
 5. COMMENTS AND EDITORIAL OPINION
 [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 19651
 NEGOTIATIONS
 It would be a mistake to allow the world
 to believe that the people of the United
 States have fallen into an Irreconcilable di-
 vision on the question of whether we should
 or should not negotiate a settlement in
 South Vietnam.  There  are  differences  of
 opinion, but they do not relate to the idea of
 negotiation; they concern the kind of nego-
 tiation.  Sentiment surely is overwhelming-
 ly in favor of negotiations that would end
 the fighting, set up enforceable peace terms,
 preserve the rights of our friends in South
 Vietnam and leave intact the honor and pres-
 tige of the United States.  Just as certainly,
 sentiment is against negotiations that would
 not do this.  The choice is not "negotia-
 tions" or "no negotiations."  The question.
 is: "What kind of negotiations?"
 In 1954, the French were driven into ne-
 gotiations of a kind we must avoid.  Mendez
 France was in desperation.  He had promised
 to get France out of Indochina.  To do it he
 had to abandon many of the people of North
 Vietnam to Communist vengeance. He had
 to get the Soviet Union to intervene with He
 Chi Minh and by allowing the EDO treaty to
 fail in the French chamber he encouraged
 that collaboration.  But French power was
 being drained away in Indochina. The na-
 tion was literally bleeding to death. History
 can forgive a weak power at the end of its
 resources for upsetting its allies in Europe,
 for deserting its comrades in arms in Indo-
 china and for closing its eyes to the conse-
 quences                                                                                                               in  Asia.  France  had  no  other
 choice.
 The United States; however, is not a small
 European power at the end of its military,
 economic, and political resources.   It Is a
 great global power whose might is undi-
 minished.  It will be judged by different
 standards. It  cannot  permit    savage  re-
 prisals to be worked upon anti-Communist
 South Vietnamese.  It cannot allow them to
 died by battalions in order to save the lives
 and property of Americans. It cannot offer
 the Soviet Union or any other intervenor po-
 litical concessions at the expense of Euro-
 pean allies.  It cannot be Indifferent to the
 extension of Chinese Communist power in
 Asia.
 Many feared at the time that the 1954
 negotiations would not end the fighting. And
 indeed they permitted It to continue on terms
 advantageous to communism.  They did not
 provide a settlement that enforced itself or
 one that permitted anyone else to enforce
 it.
 Can negotiations in 1965 do any better?
 If the North Vietnamese and their Chinese
 sponsors understand the difference between
 a powerful United States and an exhausted
 France they might.  But they must be made
 to understand that difference.  If they are
 convinced that this country has the power
 and the will to pursue Its legitimate ends
 as long as it may be necessary to do so,
 negotiations might be feasible and arrange-
 ments of an acceptable peace possible. Until
 the posture of the United States Is under-
 stood by those with whom negotiations must
 be conducted, this country must look to the
 practical military means of better protecting
 its position in South Vietnam.
 It is perfectly clear that we need greatly to
 increase the effectiveness of our conduct of
 the war inside the borders of South Vietnam.
 Several immediate steps are self-evident to
 military authority: (1) The routes by which

 North Vietnam is maintaining replacements
 and supplies for 35,000 infiltrators must be
 more nearly sealed off by the use of more
 troops on the border and by a tighter naval
 blockade; (2) the ratio of South Vietnam to
 Vietcong forces must be raised from 5 to 1
 to at least the 8-to-1 level by which the Brit-
 ish gained success against Communists in
 Malaya; (3) points from which troops are
 embarked and material shipped  in North
 Vietnam must not enjoy immunity from re-
 prisal attack; (4) the command structure of
 the South Vietnam forces must be stabilized;
 (5) the South Vietnam civilian government
 must be strengthened.
 There is no time limit In which we must
 achieve these objectives.  The scale of ex-
 penditures is not prohibitive.  We can keep
 up operations on an even greater scale, year
 after year and decade after decade, if that Is
 vital to our interests.
 At the same time, it must be acknowledged
 that nothing is possible without a primary
 effort by the South Vietnam peopli them-
 selves.  The  war  against  the  Vietcong  is
 their war.  And it is a war which only South
 Vietnam forces can win. The struggle for
 the loyalty of the people is the struggle of
 Vietnamese leaders.  It is conceivable that
 the South Vietnamese may fail completely on
 these fronts.  If that happens, regretfully
 and sorrowfully, it will be necessary for us
 to be governed by what we can do and not
 by what we would like to do or what we ought
 to do.
 At the same time that we proceed to the
 more effective prosecution of the war and the
 more efficient organization of the civilian
 Government in South Vietnam, we should
 continuously make known the very limited
 nature of our objectives.  Unlike the French
 In 1954, we- have no colonial ambitions.  We
 wish to see an independent .South Vietnam,
 safe from external aggression, free to choose
 in peace the kind of - government its people
 wish (even if it is a,Communist government
 in the end), open to normal trade and inter-
 course with North Vietnam and other Asian
 neighbors  with  whom  it  surely  must  be
 closely associated in the future.  Such a
 South Vietnam would not menace any Asian
 neighbor or threaten any legitimate interest
 of North Vietnam.
 More than mere oral assurances are needed
 to assure the future of such a country. There
 are, however, many sorts of satisfactory per-
 formance bonds that could be given by a
 North Vietnam Government desiring peace
 on these terms,
 Surely there is not much mystery about
 the conditions to settle the war in South
 Vietnam.  When there is it fair prospect for
 arriving at these conditions, there will be
 little difference among Americans as to the
 wisdom or desirability of negotiating.

 WASHINGTON CLOSE-UP--VXETNA:M: THE
 DOMINO THEORY
 (By Crosby S. Noyes)
 With the way things are going in Vietnam
 it is only natural that a certain amount of
 thought should be given these days to the
 domino theory.
 It was President Eisenhower who first used
 the metaphor to explain and justify our pres-
 ence in Vietnam.  If  our position there
 should topple, he thought, a whole series of
 non-Communist states in southeast Asia
 would almost automatically fall under Com-
 munist rule.
 The domino theory is a good deal less
 popular in administration circles today than
 it once was.  As the political situation in
 Vietnam deteriorates and the possibility of
 Communist victory grows, serious considers-
 tion is -being given to the ways and means
 of limiting the extent of a possible defeat
 there.
 Since administration leaders tend to ques-
 tion the validity of the domino theory, they
 also tend to deny rather emphatically any
 total withdrawal of American military power
 from southeast Asia in the event of a with-
 drawal from Vietnam.  The argument some-
 times made by Vietnam bitter-enders, that it
 would mean a retreat back to Hawaii and an
 end to our presence in Asia, is rejected.
 It can be argued on the contrary that there
 is no country in the world harder to defend
 against Communist subversion than South
 Vietnam.  The almost Impossible task of try-
 ing to create a country where none exists in
 the midst of a revolution that had been in
 progress for a decade before the Americans
 arrived would not confront us elsewhere.
 Thailand, for example, would provide in-
 finitely more favorable ground for resistance
 to the Chinese Communist thrust.  There,
 at least, there is a sense of national identity
 and  a tradition of government authority.
 And while the history of the country is not
 exactly one of heroic defense of freedom, the
 That,  with  encouragement,  have  shown
 themselves quite determined in opposing
 Communist pressures.
 These pressures, perhaps, could be ex-
 pected to increase if the position in Viet-
 nam were lost.  But the problems of waging
 a subversive war against a country as rela-
 tively well organized as Thailand are enor-
 mously different than in Vietnam.  There
 is no reason to suppose that Mao Tse-tung's
 guerrillas would find the waters of Thailand's
 population very congenial.
 Open military pressure through Laos would
 involve substantial risks for the Chinese.
 As a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty
 Organization, Thailand could call on-and
 presumably  receive-aid  from  Australia,
 France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philip-
 pines, Britain, and the United States.
 Under the terms of this treaty. in fact,
 the power of the United States is already
 committed in Thailand, to the extent that
 it might be needed to resist either Com-
 munist subversion or outright attack.  And
 though there is little reason to believe that
 our commitment would reach anything like
 the proportions in Vietnam, there is no rea-
 son whatever to suppose that it would be
 withdrawn.
 There are those in Washington today who
 deplore this state of affairs.  The advocates
 of worldwide American "disengagement" are
 Inclined to the theory that American power
 and prestige should never have been com-
 mited in Vietnam in the first place.  And
 from here they argue that its commitment in
 any of the so-called soft areas of southeast
 Asia-which, presumably, means all of it-
 should be avoided at all cost.
 There are also those who contend that
 any substantial transfer of American power
 to Thailand would simply serve to invite
 increase Communist pressures there.   The
 converse of the domino theory is that the
 only way to contain the spread of militant
 communism in the area is by strict nonin-
 volvement and the encouragement of neutra-
 list states on the periphery of China.
 The trouble with both theories is that they
 are belied by the evidence.  The evidence is
 that strong Communist pressure already is
 being brought to bear on neutral states in
 southeast Asia.  It may be that these pres-
 sures can be resisted by reasonably well
 integrated nations with a reasonable amount
 of political stability and military backing.
 It is not to minimize the seriousness of a
 defeat in Vietnam to say that it would not
 necessarily mean defeat everywhere.
 It is time to face up to the fact that we
 are engaged in a continuing process of con-
 taining or at least limiting the thrust of
 Communist China which threatens all of
 southeast Asia.  To pretend that this thrust
 does not exist, or that it does not represent
 a threat to vital American interests, or that
 It can be limited by diplomacy, could well
 turn defeat into disaster.
 [From the National Observer, Dec. 28, 1964]
 AT A CROSSROADS IN ASIA?-VIETNAM: FADING
 FRIENDSHIP  AND  NEW  Focus  ON  DOMINO
 THEORY
 The speaker was no leftist demagog, though
 his attack on U.S. policy was full of words
 like interference and colonialism.  The speak-
 er was, instead, an American ally in a war
 against  communism,  South  Vietnam's  Lt.
 Gen. Nguyen Khanh.   And his words raised
 serious questions about the very basis of
 American policy in southeast Asia.
 It is better, said General Khanh, "to live
 poor but proud as free citizens of an inde-
 pendent country rather than in ease and
 shame as slaves of the foreigners and Com-
 munists."  South Vietnam, he added, should
 be prepared to go it alone against the Com-
 munist Vietcong and spurn further U.S. help.
 Washington was stunned by last week's
 attack from the wily ex-Premier, once re-
 garded as South Vietnam's best hope of
 achieving victory over Red guerrillas.  And
 the question, once again, was being asked
 in the Nation's Capital, "What would hap-
 pen if the United States pulled out?"
 CURTAILMENT OF AID?
 To be sure, no high administration of-
 ficial went so far as to urge outright with-
 drawal.  But Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
 expressing the Government's opposition to
 last week's Saigon house cleaning by young
 army officers, hinted at a curtailment of pro-
 posed U.S. aid.  "Obviously," he said, "if
 there are problems of unity, there are certain
 kinds of assistance that are simply not fea-
 sible."  And Senate Majority Leader Mnez
 MANSJTSI,D revived his proposal to transfer the
 question of Vietnam's future from the battle-
 field to the conference table.  "I don't think
 neutrality Is a bad word," he said.
 Indeed, the voices urging a sharp reap-
 praisal of America's Asian policy received an
 additional boost on Christmas Eve.  A ter-
 rorist bomb exploded in the garage of the
 main U.S. officers' billet in Saigon, killing 2
 Americans and injuring 110 persons.  The
 bomb  apparently  was  smuggled  into the
 heavily guarded building in a U.S. jeep, an-
 other indication of increasing Vietcong bold-
 ness despite the intense U.S. effort In South
 Vietnam.
 Why doesn't the United States pull out of
 Vietnam?  The answer can be summed up in
 three words: The domino theory.
 Through the years, American officials have
 argued that if South Vietnam were to fall to
 the Communists, the other nations of south-
 east Asia would likewise topple-like a row
 of stacked dominoes.
 WHAT THE REDS WOULD GOBBLE
 Landlocked  Laos,  already two-thirds  in
 Communist hands, would be swiftly gobbled
 up by the Reds.  Thailand, which caved in to
 Japanese invaders after only 5 hours of fight-
 ing in December 1941, would sue for some
 accommodation with Red China in hope of
 preserving a semblance of its long-cherished
 independence from foreign rule.  Burma,
 whose government already has cut most of its
 ties with the West, would become little more
 than a Chinese province.  Cambodia, recently
 professing friendship with China, would suc-
 cumb quickly to Communist domination.
 The domino theory extends even further.
 Pessimistic proponents of the theory fear
 that if the United States is forced out of
 South Vietnam, either by a Communist con-
 quest or by the Saigon government, all of
 Asia might be opened to Chinese Communist
 penetration,  either through subversion or
 outright   invasion.   At  least,  they  argue,
 strongly pro-Western nations such as Japan,
 Malaysia, the Philippines, and Formosa could
 no longer trust the United States to fulfill any
 promises to protect them.  India, Pakistan,
 and South Korea, too, might have second
 thoughts  about  alining   themselves  too
 closely with the United States.

 Significantly, it is the latter, less-alarmist
 group that holds the controlling viewpoint
 inside the Johnson administration.
 The administration has endeavored to con-
 vince congressional critics of U.S. policy in
 southeast Asia that this calmer attitude is
 iustifled, and that American policy, heavily
 committed physically and psychologically in
 Laos and South Vietnam, should continue in
 its present framework.
 ~ To buttress that position, administration
 officials said that while there has been in-
 creased Communist infiltration, North Viet-
 nam has by no means committed all its power
 to either the Laotian or South Vietnamese
 conflicts.
 Perhaps more importantly, these officials
 assert, the Chinese Communists, who give
 the North Vietnamese moral and physical
 .support, continue to demonstrate consider-
 able caution about any direct involvement
 with the United States.
 State Department Press Officer Robert J.
 McCloskey said yesterday that there have
 been Indications in recent weeks of North
 Vietnamese military movements into south-
 ern and central Laos.
 McCloskey said he could not state either
 the size or objective of the infiltration, He
 Said, in answer to questions, that the troop
 movements might or might not be a seasonal
 increase coinciding with the ending of the
 rainy season, a shifting of forces, or a move-
 ment designed primarily to send reinforce-
 ments to South Vietnam.
 Many officials here believe that the troops
 are being funneled through the so-called Ho
 Chi Minh network of trails In Laos, for use
 in South Vietnam.
 McCloskey described the situation as "a
 cause for concern but not for alarm."  He
 said, "We're following the situation closely."
 Other authqritative sources said it appears
 that the thousands of South Vietnamese who
 were being trained in North Vietnam for use
 in the south are about used up, and that the
 Communist  northerners are now sending
 down native-born men from the Red terri-
 tory.
 But while there have been published re-
 ports that between 15,000 and 20,000 men
 have been filtered into South Vietnam from
 the north during 1964, official sources here
 yesterday  would  speak only  of  "several
 thousand" men.    In addition, it was said,
 these numbers have been offset, by an in-
 creasing callup of South Vietnamese forces
 to fight them.
 In Laos, officials said that since last May,
 when U.S. T-28 "reconnaissance" and "es-
 cort" planes were sent in to help the royal
 Government  withstand  the  Communist
 Pathet,Lao and North Vietnamese, the neu-
 tralist central. regimes position has improved

 HANOI IMPROVES SUPPLY LINE TO SOUTH VIET-
 NAM-MORE TROOPS CROSS LAOS BY HO CHI
 MINH TRAIL-ANALYSTS FEAR LARGE FORCE
 MAY OPEN NEW FRONT
 (By Hedrick Smith)
 WASHINGTON,  June 25.-Recent U.S. re-
 connaissance missions have confirmed earlier
 reports that Communist forces have been
 improving their road network in southern
 Laos and have considerably stepped up the
 pace of their supply convoys there.
 "Officials here report that the Communists
 now have stretched their road network south
 from Tchepone,  previously  the  terminal
 point for truck traffic on the supply network
 known as the. Ho Chi Minh trail.    Other
 links, of the. network are reported to have
 been improved.
 The Ho Chi Minh trail, a complex of dirt,
 roads tapering off into scores of jungle trails,
 has long been one of the principal supply
 routes from North Vietnam to Communist
 guerrillas In South Vietnam.
 Officials declined to give precise figures on
 the number of trucks recently seen operating
 in the Tchepone region, but intelligence esti-
 mates indicate that roughly 3,000 North
 Vietnamese troops are on more or less perma-
 nent duty in southeastern Laos near the
 South Vietnamese border.
 YEAR OF NEW MOVES RISES
 This concentration and the increases in
 supply convoys during the recent dry season
 are reported to have raised fears among
 U.S. officials, inficluding Ambassador Henry
 Cabot Lodge, about North Vietnamese inten-
 tions.
 Officials have been worried for fear the
 Communists might try to infiltrate large
 forces across the Laotian border into the
 central Vietnamese highlands while South
 Vietnamese Government forces were largely
 concentrating on fighting guerrillas south of
 Saigon.
 Other officials suspect that the activity in
 southern Laos may be a prelude to future
 offensives against Saravane and Attopeu, two
 rightwing  strongholds  in  southern  Laos,
 Hostile forces nearly surround both towns
 now.
 Since neither town is in the Mekong Val-
 ley, some analysts here are concerned lest the
 Pathet Lao assume they can be attacked
 without fear of American intervention. . The
 United States has often warned that its
 mantle  of  protection  extends  over  the
 Mekong Valley bordering Thailand.
 The stepped-up operations in southern
 Laos, officials said, began last fall and have
 increased in tempo this spring since pro-
 Communist Pathet Lao units gained control
 of the Nakay Plateau in January.
 These officials consider the southern opera-
 tions to be unrelated to recent offensives by
 Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese troops
 around the Plains des Jarres in north-cen-
 tral Laos.
 That fighting, which pushed the United
 States toward the brink of a major conflict,
 has now almost halted.
 Although the ground fighting was con-
 fined to the region north of Paksane, Laotian
 Air Force T-28 fighter-bombers, supplied by
 the United States, have carried out strikes
 this month against some Pathet Lao posi-
 tions in southern Laos as well.
 Officials here have also dropped hints that
 some plans held in readiness would call for
 the South Vietnamese Air Force to raid Com-
 munist supply routes in Laos and possibly in
 North Vietnam.
 So far such raids are considered a fairly
 distant possibility.  Premier Nguyen Khanh
 has told U.S. officials he is opposed to carry-
 ing the war beyond his borders until he has
 developed a more stable base at home.
 The principal roads from North Vietnam
 into southern Laos are Route 8, from the city
 of Vinh through the Nape Pass, and Route
 12 through the My Gia Pass, a bit farther
 South,
 Since last fall, intelligence reports indi-
 cated that the Communists were building up
 Route 12-A to connect Route 12 at Nhom-
 marath with the town of Muting Phine about
 80 miles to the south on Route 9.
 From there, truck Loads of troops and ship-
 ments of ammunition, weapons, fuel, medical
 supplies, and other equipment were reported
 moving east toward Tchepone on Route 9
 and also down Route 23 toward Saravane, 80
 miles to the southwest, to Pathet Lao guer-
 rillas operating in that area.

 DE'rzNTx HOPE DzcxrvEs UNTIED STATES,
 LATINS  SAY (By Marguerite Higgins)
 SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO.-It is common-
 place in Central America to hear experienced
 diplomats express the hope that Washington
 is'getting over its hypnotism with the .idea
 of a Russian-American detente and its mis-
 interpretation of the Sino-Soviet split.
 What  hypnotism?  What misinterpreta-
 tion?
 Said an experienced Venezuelan diplomat:
 "No country in Latin America would be
 happier to welcome a rapprochement be-
 tween Washington and Moscow-if it were
 genuine.  But we fear it is not genuine so
 far as Latin America is concerned.  Indeed
 we believe that hope of a detente has been
 used by Moscow to pull the wool over Wash-
 ington's eyes while the Communists down
 here profit from America's nonseeing atti-
 tude to intensify guerrilla activities, vio-
 lence, and terrorism-or at least try to.
 "As to the Sino-Soviet split, we think that
 far from restraining the Soviet Union, it has
 merely spurred Moscow on to greater as-
 sistance to so-called wars of liberation in
 Latin America-assistance designed to prove
 that Moscow is not soft on the West as Peip-
 ing says."
 CITES ATTACKS
 "Washington was apparently surprised,"
 the diplomat went on, "to hear of the
 Kosygin visit to North Vietnam.  We were
 not surprised at all.  For in Cuba, Russians,
 Chinese, and North Vietnamese have been
 cooperating in the training and planning for
 guerrilla attacks in Latin America."
 According to Cuban broadcasts and to the
 Cuban press, a delegation from the Viet-
 namese  liberation  front,  more  commonly
 known as the Vietcong, came in  1964 to
 Havana where it signed a mutual aid pact
 with the Venezuelan guerrilla forces.
 The Venezuelan guerrillas,  who halted
 their attacks briefly in 1963, are once more
 in the mountains, burning and killing and
 blowing up things.
 The fact that the overwhelming majority
 of Venezuelan peasants hate the guerrillas
 does not deter their terrorist leaders any
 more than the fact that the Vietnamese
 peasants hate the Vietcong deters Hanoi.
 Intelligence  reports  indicate  that  this
 weird consortium planning and plotting lib-
 eration wars from Cuba includes four coun-
 tries-Communist China, the Soviet Union,
 Czechoslovakia, and North Vietnam.
 Here in Puerto Rico it is very unpopular
 for strangers to speak of Communist doings
 or even intentions.  This is understandable
 perhaps in light of the tourist trade and
 continuing attempts to lure American busi-
 ness Investment.
 MINORITIES EXPLOITED
 And, of course, this is perfectly correct.
 There is no Communist threat to Puerto
 Rico in the sense that the Communist con-
 sortium in Cuba and local extremists have
 made any real inroads in this country.  In-
 deed, no responsible official or writer has
 ever alleged that the Communists are about
 to take over in Puerto Rico.
 But whether Castro and his cohorts are
 exploiting  certain  minority  elements  in
 Puerto  Rico    and  seeking to prepare the
 ground for mischiefmaking in Puerto Rico
 is another matter.
 In relatively prosperous Puerto Rico there
 is plenty of evidence that the ideological
 divisions of the Communist camp have not
 prevented their cooperation in seeking to
 propagandize persons who hopefully may
 one day serve their purposes.

 (By Norman Gall)
 CARACAS.-The   Venezuelan   Communist
 movement, after 13 months of relative quiet
 since the December 1963 elections, is plan-
 ning a "counteroffensive" aimed at conquest
 of power through another cycle of terrorism
 and heightened guerrilla warfare.
 According to recently  obtained internal
 Venezuelan Communist Party documents, the
 current "defensive situation" of the Armed
 Forces of National Liberation (FALN) sched-
 uled to last "at least 6 months" will give way
 to coordinated violence in. urban and rural
 areas and in infiltrated military installations.
 Venezuela's Communists received a severe
 setback when their call for boycott of the
 presidential  election  was  ignored despite
 threats of violence.- The small party never
 received widespread support, even before the
 government restricted it in an effort to end
 terrorist acts.
 The "defensive situation" described in a
 memorandum of the party's politburo cir-
 culated in recent months among FALN guer-
 rilla units consists of accelerated programs
 of training guerrillas abroad, a campaign for
 amnesty for jailed insurrectionists, offers of
 a truce to the government, quiet gestation of
 more guerrilla operations and deepening in
 filtration of the regular armed forces.
 According to this memorandum, the "gen-
 eral counteroffensive plan" consists of:
 "Simultaneous insurgency in military in-
 stallations with occupation of strategic ob-
 jectives with sufficient flexibility to estab-
 lish a long struggle. In these military insur-
 gencies previous  arrangements should ' be  by holding up travelers on the Puerto Bar-
 made for distribution of arms to our cadres rioe Highway.  But it appears evident now
 and to the civilian population under our that the movement In receiving funds from
 control."              outside sources as well.
 SHIPMENT OF FUNDS
 There has been considerable speculation
 over the reported shipment last month of
 $100,000 in quetzals from a bank here to a
 New York bank.
 The Guatemala bank assumed the costs
 of commission, insurance and the shipping at
 the going rate of 1 percent for the total
 transaction.  There was no indication here
 of the Identification of the consignee in New
 York.  The    Guatemala  Government,  while
 it enforces dollar control, does not ask for
 details of quetzals-for-dollars transactions.
 The quetzal is on a par with the dollar.
 The theory prevalent here Is that the un-
 derground movement is being supplied by
 adherents   traveling   from   Mexico.  This
 theory, vaguely defined, holds that in transac-
 tions such as the quetzal-dollar exchange the
 messengers for the guerrilla forces smuggle
 in the funds from Mexico.  The question of
 finances arises from the certainty that' the
 expenses of the underground movement are
 mounting and that there is no way to ac-
 count for Its  funds  except  from                                                                                                                                     outside
 sources.
 Marco  Antonio     Yong  Sosa,  called  "El
 Chino"  because one  of his    parents  was
 Chinese, admitted in an interview with the
 leftist Mexican magazine writer Victor Rico
 Galan that a number of the incursions of
 the guerrilla forces he leads have brought
 in about $100,000.  The principal contribu-
 tion was $75,000 paid as ransom for Jorge
 Samayoa, the kidnapped son of a Guate-
 malan movie chain operator.
 REVENUE FROM RAIDS
 Additional revenue has come from raids
 on provincial United Fruit Co. treasuries and
 small banks.
 Mr. Yong Sosa, in the interview published
 in the leftist Mexican magazine Siempre on
 October 30, 1963, conceded that his forces had
 assassinated several public figures and a large
 number of army officers ranging up to colonel
 in rank.  Most of the assassinations, he said,
 were for political reasons.
 The guerilla forces, even their supporters
 in the capital concede, are primarily of nui-
 sance value.  But they have an unsettling
 political effect not only in the mountains but
 also in the urban centers.   In the cities,
 particularly in the capital, they plant small
 bombs and occasionally kidnap or shoot per-
 sons considered to be enemies of the move-
 ment.  Earlier this week they exploded about
 a dozen bombs here.  These explosions fol-
 lowed a police search that found caches of
 mortars, machineguns, small arms, and am-
 munition.
 There is some question whether Mr. Yong
 Soso, who was trained as a guerrilla fighter
 by the United States in the Canal Zone,
 was himself a Communist.  Ile has told at
 least one Guatemalan politician that he Is
 accepting   assistance   from     Communist
 sources in Mexico and Cuba.
 This politician is Francisco Villagran Kra-
 mer, a young lawyer who is head of the
 leftist   Revolutionary  Democratic   Union
 Party.    At one time Mr. Villagran Kramer
 and his party contemplated a union with
 the Yong Sosa organization, the lawyer said.
 Representatives of the two organizations, ac-
 cording                                                                                                                                        to  Mr.  Villagran  Kramer,  held
 a series of conferences, but these were broken
 off when the Villagran Kramer party decided
 to go to the polls on its own last May. This
 decision, Mr. Villagran Kramer said was made
 over the heated objections of the Yong Sosa
 group, which maintained that a revolution-
 ary overthrow of the Peralta government
 was Guatemala's only political solution.

 COURAGE AT VIETNAM OUTPOST
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 PLEI ME, VIETMAN.-The morning had be-
 gun with a mine disaster. Literally.  It was
 a "Jumping Betty" mine-one of those that
 jumps out of the dirt and explodes in the
 air.  And so, it had cruelly mangled the
 bodies of 16 of the work detail that Capt.
 Ronnie Mendoza, of Los Angeles, had sent to
 repair about three and a half miles of the
 red   dirt  jungle  road  the  Vietcong  had
 severed by digging great, gaping ditches
 across it.
 Many of the wounded were only 11 to 14
 years of age, children or relatives of the
 Vietnamese and Montagnard (non-Mongol
 mountain people) soldiers who, along with
 Captain Mendoza's 12-man team, use this
 isolated outpost near the Lao border for
 patrols and ambushes and other counter-
 guerrilal operations, against the Vietcong.
 COPTER ARRIVES
 Soon the helicopter arrived at Plei Me to
 lift out the wounded.  The two pilots-
 Capt. John Mustard, of Montesand, Wash.,
 and Capt. Charlie E. Bryant, of Ocilla, Ga.-
 spoke feelingly of the courage with which
 the big-eyed Vietnamese and Montagnard
 children tried to suppress their cries of pain.
 This is high, spectacular country where
 the jungle covered mountains rise, steeply,
 7,000 feet high and where air currents in
 the intervening valleys can be tricky.  The
 helicopter bumped and dipped as it fought
 the turbulent currents.
 From the air, Plei Me is an eyesore with
 Its barbed wire outer fences, its trenches, its
 mortar emplacements and sandbags, its brick
 and tin barracks building.  It seems an im-
 probable and unexpected scar in the green
 jungle.
 In this part of Vietnam the jungle trails
 are prowled not just by the Communist Viet-
 cong but by mighty tigers that European
 hunters once traveled far to shoot.
 And despite the morning tragedy, Men-
 doza had not been able to keep his mind
 off those jungle trials because 100 men of
 his special forces, including 2 American
 sergeants, were out there on a week long
 patrol, 3 days of which had passed.  Their
 mission was to try and spot possible infil-
 tration routes and the supply dui ps that
 the Communists always prepare in advance
 at points a day's march apart.
 Since his men had last checked in by radio,
 a lot of sniper fire had been heard in the
 next valley and Mendoza, a cool and con-
 trolled sort, nonetheless was eagerly await-
 ing the next radio report which would come
 at 4 p.m.
 The itinerary of the patrol had been
 worked out by Mendoza in consultation with
 his Vietnamese counterpart, Capt. Nguyen
 Van Thoi who was known all over the valley
 as one of the few Vietnamese who could.
 command the loyalty of the Montagnards.
 I asked him if the morning mine casual-
 ties' might have any effect on the morale of
 the soldiers.
 "There has never been a desertion from
 this camp and there will not be," the Viet-
 namese captain said with pride.
 "Were his men happy with the new regime
 in Saigon?" I asked.
 "Madam," said the Vietnamese captain, "I
 am an officer and not even I know the name
 of the leader In Saigon.  My men do not
 fight for Saigon.  They fight for their vil-
 lage.                                                                                They fight because the Vietcong takes
 their rice and steals their children and kills
 their kinfolk.  They fight because the Amer-
 icans give them rice and the American doc-
 tor treats their wife and children.  And that
 is how it is."
 Finally, it was 4 o'clock and the air was
 electric with good news.  "Nobody hurt,"
 said Mendoza after his curt quick radio ex-
 change with the patrol.
 When night came and it was time for mere
 reporters to leave, Mendoza saw us off and
 yelling against the noise of the chopper
 blades said something that sounded like, "We
 can take care of things up here if they can
 just keep those rioters quiet in Saigon."
 It was. the same high morale everywhere
 at the front.  And It made you so mad at the
 so-called student and Buddhist rioters who
 cause chaos back In the soft-living city.
 2. NORTH VIETNAMESE II7TTERVENTIQN
 EIGHTY TONS OF VIETCONG ARMS UNCOVERED,
 BIG SHIP SUNK
 (By Peter Arnett)
 Tuv  IIOA,                        VIETNAM.-By  far the biggest
 haul of Communist weapons for the Vietcong
 was uncovered yesterday, near a remote cove
 where a large mystery vessel was sighted and
 sunk earlier in the week.  Officials estimated
 80 tons of armaments-much of it Russian
 and Chinese-had fallen into government
 hands.
 The weapons, ammunition, and medical
 supplies, including whole blood, apparently
 had been shipped along the coast from Com-
 munist North Vietnam to equip Red guer-
 rillas fighting in the South, United States and
 South Vietnamese officials said.
 "We  thought  the  supply  routes  were
 through Laos and Cambodia, but look at
 this  lot," said  Col. Theodore Mataxis, of
 Seattle, Wash., a senior adviser. "They could
 easily be arming a new division to launch
 against us up here."
 CAMOUFLAGED SHIP SUNK
 The materiel was found in the hull of the
 sunken vessel and in caches on the beaches
 of a cove on Vung Ro Bay here, 240 miles
 northeast of Saigon and about 50 miles south
 of Nha Trang, site of a major U.S. military
 installation.
 A routine helicopter patrol uncovered the
 cache Tuesday.   Flying over the bay, the
 helicopter crew sighted what looked like a
 drifting island. Then, heavy fire came up
 from the Island.  It turned out to be a well-
 camouflaged                                                                                        ship,  about  400-feet  long.
 South     Vietnamese  fighter-bombers  were
 called in and sank the vessel.
 Lt. Gen. Nguyen Khanh personally ordered
 troops into the area.  After heavy fighting.
 they took over the cove and beach area Fri-
 day,  when  some  of the  armaments                                                                                 were
 found.
 A captured Communist guerrilla said the
 ship had made six trips to bays along Viet-
 nam's central coast, dropping off supplies.
 Then yesterday the South Vietnamese un-
 covered  more  caches. One                                                                                  area,  said  an
 official, was "literally covered with weapons,
 six deep."
 The  haul  included  1,000  Russian-made
 carbines, several  hundred  Russian    sub-
 machineguns and light machineguns, and
 Chinese burp guns.  All had been wrapped
 in waterproof cloth.
 Scores of tons of ammunition were found
 for these weapons, some of it made as re-
 cently as last year in Chinese factories, ac-
 cording to ordnance experts at the scene.
 There was also a selection of sophisticated
 mines and grenades, and ammunition for a
 new type of rocket launcher used against
 tanks.
 The large supplies of captured medicines
 included  many  cases  of  penicillin,  anti-
 malarial drugs, and whole blood produced in
 Japan late last year.
 ONE BIG SUPPLY FACTORY
 Four caches had been found up to late
 yesterday. Troops probing through the hills
 under the guns of Communist snipers ex-
 pected to find more.
 "These hills are just one big supply. fac-
 tory," said Mataxis.
 The  extent  of  the  Communist  supply
 depots shocked U.S. advisers.
 "This is just massive," one said.
 The Vietcong put up a determined fight
 to keep government troops from the caches.
 But they had to pull back. S'e'veral govern-
 ment soldiers have been killed in isolated
 mortar and sniping attacks.
 Government forces intend to stay in the
 region as long as it is necessary to clear
 it of supplies.
 The commander of the 23d Division, Gen.
 Luu Lan, said, "What we have found here Is
 of tremendops Importance.  The Communist
 aggressors have been able to confuse people,
 so that the truth has been hard to discover.
 "But here we have discovered one link
 of the massive chain of weapons introduc-
 tion into South Vietnam.                                                                                                                                        This is one of
 the  reasons  why  we  and our       American
 allies have had to take the actions we have
 taken," the General said.
 This was      a reference to retaliatory  air
 strikes in North Vietnam.
 Members       of  the  International  Control
 Commission,   the  organization  created   to
 police  the  Geneva    accords  on Indochina,
 were shown the arms haul by Khanh.
 The commission is made up of Indian,
 Canadian and Polish  delegates.      Included
 in  the   Communist    medical  supplies were
 drugs from Poland.
 COMMUNIST BUILDUP
 U.S. sources said the apparent buildup
 of Communist arms along the coast may
 coincide with reports that increased num-
 bers                                                                                                                                 of  guerillas  have  been  Infiltrating
 from North Vietnam in the past 3 days.
 The Vietcong  have   made  determined
 attempts in recent months to take over the
 central Vietnamese   region. They   have
 met with considerable success so far.
 Some Americans  expressed  belief    the
 Communists will use ships more frequently
 to supply the Vietcong.
 U.S. jet planes have been attacking the
 Communist supply routes through Com-
 munist-held territory in Laos.

 CONCEPT  OF  "INTERNAL  REVOLT"  IN  SOUTH
 VIETNAM PUNCTURED
 (By Mark S. Watson)
 WASHINGTON, February 10.-From the tor-
 rent of events in southeast Asia since the
 weekend one politically useful fact emerges.
 That is the well-publicized radio order from
 Communist Vietcong headquarters  in  the
 north to all Vietcong agents south of the
 border to redouble their activities immedi-
 ately.
 The promptness with which the order was
 obeyed at widely separated points shows how
 well organized are the Vietcong's controls.
 But more important in its long-range politi-
 cal effects may be this plain proof of a fact
 that hitherto the Communist leaders have
 denied; namely, that the whole internal re-
 volt in South Vietnam is, and always has
 been, skillfully engineered from Red head-
 quarters far to the north.

 public opinion, which communism has tried
 for years to delude with this "internal revolt"
 fiction, now is in better position to know that
 even  while the Communist powers were
 agreeing to the Geneva neutralization pact
 the Communist machine in North Vietnam
 was already beginning Its subversion and
 assassination program in the south.
 In this program of deception a large in-
 fluence was the International Control Com-
 mission, set up to assure that the pledges of
 neutrality were kept.  By 1961, reports of
 1,200 offensive "incidents" by Communist
 agents, ranging from one-man assassinations
 to fairly large scale military actions, had been
 laid before the commission.  None was acted
 on.
 The reason given by an American White
 Paper was that the Polish Communist mem-
 ber of the commission refused to investigate
 any charge that might embarrass the Com-
 munist Vietcong, and the Indian member re-
 fused to start an inquiry that would em-
 barrass his Polish colleague.  Opposed by
 two, the one remaining member, the Cana-
 dian, was powerless.
 LEADERS KNOWN
 For some reason, possibly the difficulty in
 remembering the oriental names, the Viet-
 cong leaders have, with two exceptions, re-
 mained largely unknown to the American
 public.
 There Is no mystery about the others, for
 captured or defecting Vietcong agents and
 officers have divulged almost all details of the
 Red machine for which they worked.  Full
 information about that complex and sur-
 prisingly efficient mechanism and its oper-
 ators at all levels now can be reported with-
 out endangering security.
 Of the two familiar names one Is that of
 Ho Chi Minh, head of the North Vietnam
 political government and of its Lao Dong
 (Workers) Party, and tirelessly active in its
 all-important Central Research (Intelligence
 and Operations) Agency and other working
 elements.  The other fairly familiar name is
 that of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, Defense Minis-
 ter, one of the world's great guerrilla leaders.
 The Lao Dong Party follows the pattern of
 Russia's Communist Party, and its Secretary
 General, Ho Chi Minh, that of Russia's usual.
 one-man-in-two-jobs, premier of the nation
 and secretary general of the party. The mili-
 tary is subordinate to Ho, the political chief,
 and all the way down the line and into the
 kindred Lao Dong of South Vietnam at all
 levels the political leaders uniformly com-
 mand the military.  That is one way of as-
 suring unity.
 FRONT CREATED IN 1980
 To provide a cloak of respectability and
 conceal in some measure the responsibility
 of the Hanoi organizers with murder and in-
 surrection against Saigon, Ho Chi Minh in
 1960 created the "Front for Liberation of
 South Vietnam."
 It is still guided wholly by Ho Chi Minh's
 Central Committee, immediately directing
 work in the "South Central" zone (just south
 of  the  17th  parallel  border)  and  in  the
 "Nabo" region (south and southwest, in-
 clig Saigon and the Mekong Delta).
 For the Central Committee, supervision is
 exercised in Hanoi by a "Committee for Su-
 pervision of the South," made up of Le Due
 Tho, of the Politburo, Phon Hung, Vice
 Premier of North Vietnam, and Brig. Gen. Ng
 uney Van Vinh, chairman of the board for
 reunification.  Each of the two zones has its
 own secretary general, a deputy and a dozen
 members;  each its agencies for training,
 propaganda and action.
 To this political leadership the military, as
 remarked, is subordinate.  Its principals are
 OR Vinb, who is indeed a member of that
 Committee of the South but pointedly a
 "junior member"; Brig. Gen. Nguyen Don, in
 charge of military work in the South-Central
 zone but directly responsible to Tran Luong,
 of the Lao Dong in Hanoi, and Brig. Gen. Van
 Muoi, similarly responsible to Muoi Cua, a
 politican.
 The Central Research Agency, a prime "ac-
 tion" unit for subversion, forgery, arming,
 radio  command, intelligence  and military
 command, is actively directed by Ho Chi
 Minh and Giap. Its prime center for disorder
 in South Vietnam was at Vinh Linh, the tar-
 get of Sunday's fierce bombing attack. Other
 centers handle Cambodian and overseas in-
 telligence, with Gen. Hosing Dao, Col. Le Can
 and Col. Van Trong as principal agents.
 This is regarded as the agency chiefly re-
 sponsible for conveying Ho Chi Minh's direc-
 tives straight  to the  guerrilla pockets  in
 South Vietnam, and seeing that the supply
 of men and weapons continues pouring over
 the many branches of the so-called Ho Chi
 Minh trail into South Vietnam.

 AGGRESSION ADMITTED
 (By Joseph Alsop)
 At last, the administration's policymakers
 are somewhat reluctantly admitting the im-
 portance of the North Vietnamese troop
 movements into South Vietnam and Laos.
 Being clandestine, these Communist troop
 movements were long and obstinately pooh-
 poohed.  Now, however, they are an officially
 acknowledged fact.  While the fact is ad-
 mitted, its meaning is still being played
 down. Even the resulting solid proof of
 North Vietnamese aggression has not been
 greatly stressed. As for the military implica-
 tions,                                                              they  have  been hardly mentioned;
 yet they are potentially very great indeed.
 In Laos, to' begin with, the whole balance
 of the war has been upset.  It is a tiny war.
 The non-Communist Laotians, although they
 have fought very well against Laotian Com-
 munist sympathizers, have always fared ill
 In their rare engagements with North Viet-
 namese units. Hence the appearance in Laos
 of several additional North Vietnamese bat-
 talions changes the whole local outlook.
 Because Laos is both a subsidiary war thea-
 ter and a corridor to South Vietnam, it is
 not quite certain how. the additional bat-
 talions are to be used.  some think they are
 intended for use in Laos, since they have
 moved into the heart of Laos to the west of
 the corridor-region of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
 If. this is correct, the brilliant Communist
 commander, Gen. Vi Nguyen Giap, must be
 planning a semifinal test of strength in Laos.
 Because of the generally misty character
 of every Laotian situation, a prompt Ameri-
 can riposte to such a test of strength will
 be extra difficult.  And a major Communist
 thrust in Laos will have the gravest reper-
 cussions in South Vietnam, unless the Ameri-
 can riposte is both prompt and massive.
 It is equally possible, however, that these
 new battalions spotted in Laos are eventually
 destined to be moved into South Vietnam.
 For a good many months, organized battal-
 ions of the North Vietnamese Army have been
 filtering into the South Vietnamese fight-
 ing-moving by truck down the Ho Chi Minh
 Trail to the Chepone region, crossing the bor-
 der in small bands, and then reforming and
 marching to their assigned areas of opera-
 tions.
 There have long been plenty of signs to
 prove that the North Vietnamese had reached
 the stage of sending organized battalions
 into the fighting, instead of mere cadres to
 lead their guerrillas.  As noted, for instance,
 in          this  reporter's  recent  dispatches  from
 Saigon, young North Vietnamese army con-
 scripts are now quite often found among
 prisoners of war.
 The invasion of South Vietnam by two,
 three, or even four new Communist bat-
 talions per month may not sound like much
 by the standards of modern war.  But this
 war in Vietnam is not very modern.  An
 entire province may be defended by no more
 than five government battalions.
 If the Communists already have seven bat-
 talions, as they do in Quang Nat Province,
 for instance, the addition of two more bat-
 talions may cause the Dien Bien Phu-like
 disaster that is General Giap's obvious aim
 In this phase.  That is the real meaning of
 the persistent Communist troop movement
 into South Vietnam.
 For this very reason, Gen. Maxwell Taylor
 has repeatedly recommended stronger, more
 direct action against the North Vietnamese.
 He wanted something much more effective
 than the brief retaliatory raid after the Inci-
 dent in the Gulf of Tonkin.  He wanted re-
 taliation after the attack on the U.S. airfield
 at BienHoa.  He again asked for retaliation
 after a U.S. officers barracks in Saigon was
 destroyed by a Communist-planted bomb.
 The recommendations of General Taylor
 were disapproved by President Johnson in
 all three instances.  As a less dangerous sort
 of retaliation, the President instead author-
 ized bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, first
 by the Laotian air force, and then by the U.S.
 fighter-bombers that recently destroyed a
 key bridge at Ban Ban.
 The degree of power this deployed against
 the infiltrators may be gaged from the fact
 that one-half the Laotian air force has just
 been put out of action by a single accidental
 bomb explosion in an airplane hangar.  In
 any case, mere air attacks on the Ho Chi
 Minh Trail are wildly unlikely to produce
 any solid result, even if made with 10 times
 the power.
 The truth is, the war in southeast Asia is
 steadily  going  from  bad  to worse.  The
 enemy is getting bolder, and he Is steadily
 reinforcing his frontline troops.  The rein-
 forcement is not being countered.                                                                                                                                           Hence
 there is no hope of any counteroffensive, un-
 less President Johnson has important sur-
 prises up his sleeve.
 Perhaps the President has such surprises
 in preparation, for he is a man of surprises.
 But as of now, we are drifting toward final
 defeat.

 RED ASIAN BUILDUP CONFIRMED
 (By Murrey Marder)
 U.S. officials confirmed yesterday that there
 has been increased infiltration of Communist
 North Vietnamese troops into Laos and South
 Vietnam.       But they called it a cause for
 continuing concern, not sudden alarm.
 The Communist buildup of forces in both
 places during 1964 and continuing Into re-
 cent weeks is significant in relative terms,
 but not a dramatic or grave turn, officials said.
 In  both  on-the-record  and  background
 comments, administration officials sought to
 demonstrate an attitude of skeptical calm-
 ness about recently published reports that
 the conflicts on the Indochina peninsula may
 be approaching a stage of more massive, open
 warfare.
 Few hard facts or figures were disclosed in
 the  process.  Officials  said  more  details
 should be available early next week after
 consultations with the U.S. mission in Saigon,
 capital of South Vietnam.
 It became increasingly evident yesterday
 that both in South Vietnam and in Wash-
 ington there are conflicting interpertations
 about the facts and the significance of the
 increased Communist Infiltration.
 Those officials most eager to strike more
 directly at Communist bases in North Viet-
 nam appear to interpret the infiltration re-
 ports  as  evidence  to  justify  that.  This
 group believes the Communists are increas-
 ingly preparing to shift from guerrilla tac-
 tics to direct offensives.
 But the less-alarmist school of thought
 rates such a shift in Communist strategy as
 unlikely.

 We suggest that all of our military, po-  sustain popular support of Vietnamese Gov-
 subordinated to a massive southeast Asian
 development program.  A Johnson plan for
 the full flowering of southeast Asian econom-
 ic resources and independence will have as
 much potency and promise for success in
 that corner of the world as the Marshall plan
 did in Europe and the Tennessee Valley Au-
 thority in the United States.
 The Mekong Basin is one of the world's
 richest and least developed areas.  In an
 area of the world already food rich there is an
 opportunity to harness the tributaries of the
 Mekong ~ Basin toward an economic flowering
 offering infinite promise to Laos, Cambodia,
 and Thailand as well as to South Vietnam,
 and offering to the people and the Govern-
 ment of North Vietnam economic oppor-
 tunity whica only their blindness or non-
 cooperation can frustrate. To Burma, Malay-
 sia, and even India, this would present an op-
 portunity in both economic and political
 terms which, especially at this moment, could
 not possibly be  more desirable.  To the
 Philippines such a program would provide
 the same magnetic opportunity for participa-
 tion as led them generously to create and
 man Operation Brotherhood a decade ago.
 It would also offer the first possibility of
 really involving the wealth and energy of the
 Japanese Government and people.  A John-
 son development plan for southeast Asia
 would manifest to the entire world that the
 welfare of the people 'of southeast Asia is
 our only purpose.
 The Mekong Basin development program
 will provide for the first time a future-
 oriented thrust around which a Vietnamese
 resurgency program can be made vital and
 toward which the efforts of Americans, Ja-
 panese, Lao, Thai, Cambodians, and Filipinos
 can hopefully be attracted.
 THE MISSING LINK
 Within the ; last 3 years the Communist
 nations have revealed their inability to meet
 their own most pressing economic needs.
 The shortcut to the future has suddenly
 proved to be a dead end of economic failure,
 recrimination, and political embarrassment.
 But this has not frustrated the wars of na-
 tional liberation nor prevented the Com-
 munists from mounting insurrectionary war-
 fare whether in Congo or Vietnam. National
 governments and native peoples assaulted by
 such Communist purposes have, at best,
 sought to sustain their own energy through
 defensive effort.  Virtually unused has been
 the enormous potential for hope which can
 be found only in the non-Communist, world,
 cooperatively employing the resources of the
 United States and nations friendly to it
 whether in Asia, the Pacific, or Western
 Europe.
 We have offered to the Vietnamese people
 our assistance in their struggle for national
 Independence.  We have failed, however, to
 harness that struggle and our assistance to
 an all but miraculous future, a flowering of
 man, his capabilities, his resources, his aspi-
 rations,  Ours indeed is~ the truly revolu-
 tionary  opportunity.  The  Johnson  plan
 offers to southeast Asia a genuine oppor-
 tunity to harness nature, enlarge justice, ex-
 tend life, eradicate the scourges of illness and
 illiteracy and enable long-suffering peoples
 to reap the fruits of their soil and the per-
 manent benefits of national independence.
 Behind this large vision, men throughout the
 world may be led to voluntary association in
 Lincoln Brigades,  Gandhi  Brigades,  Mag-
 saysay, and Marti Brigades-an international
 volunteer corps for peace and freedom.
 The Johnson plan for the development of
 the Mekong Basin has, in our judgment, the
 following potential, essentially unavailable
 in the present circumstances:
 1. It will inject dramatic, viable, and po-
 litically potent new purpose adequate to
 2. It will infuse new energy into the Viet-
 namese already risking their lives in daily
 defense against the Vietcong.
 3. The plan offers concrete reasons for the
 cooperative  involvement  of  neighboring
 southeast Asian countries as well as a gener-
 ous commitment able to sustain emotionally
 an international corps of volunteers.
 4. It contains an enormous incentive to
 North Vietnam to turn away from its present
 fratricidal course.
 5. Finally, the Johnson plan constitutes a
 pioneering laboratory of hopeful consequence
 to other less developed areas where Commu-
 nist insurrectionary warfare presently finds
 soil in which to sow the seeds of destruction.
 VFW ENDORSES PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S NORTH
 VIETNAM ACTION
 WASHINGTON, D.C., February 8, 1965. The
 national commander in chief of the Veterans
 of Foreign Wars of the United States, Mr.
 John A. Jenkins, of Birmingham, Ala., today
 informed President Johnson of the "whole-
 hearted and unreserved support of the VFW"
 for  the  President's  decision  to  retaliate
 against North Vietnamese military installa-
 tions.
 In his telegram to the President the VFW
 commander pointed out that such military
 action against North Vietnam was in full
 accord with the unanimously adopted resolu-
 tion of the 1964 VFW national convention,
 supporting whatever action is necessary to
 win in South Vietnam.  The text of Com-
 mander Jenkins' telegram to President John-
 son follows:
 THE PRESIDENT,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: The Veterans of For-
 eign Wars wholeheartedly and without res-
 ervation supports your decision in taking
 retaliatory armed action against the Com-
 munist aggressors in North Vietnam.  Your
 wise and bold decision in this matter will go
 far toward assuring our allies throughout all
 Asia that the United States stands by its
 commitments and will not be intimidated by
 Communist threats and aggressive action.
 U.S. action against North Vietnam is en-
 tirely  consistent  with  the  unanimously
 passed resolution of our 1964 VFW national
 convention which called for all action nec-
 essary to win in South Vietnam.  The VFW,
 consisting of 1,300,000 overseas combat vet-
 erans fully recognizes that communism has
 launched  a  deliberate  attack  against  all
 southeast Asia and, consequently, the inter-
 est of U.S. security and the cause of free-
 dom can be protected, in the final analysis,
 only by the judicious and willing use of
 military power.

 "PLEASANT VALLEY":                                 A VIETNAMESE SUCCESS
 STORY   SAIGON'S FORCES WREST AREA FROM
 STRONG RED CONTROL-"SHOW CONFIDENCE
 IN PEOPLE," MAJOR SAYS OF HIS  METHOD
 (By Jack Raymond)
 PHOUC CHAI, SOUTH VIETNAM, July 26.-In
 Vietnamese, Phouc Chai means "pretty val-
 ley," and that is just what this collection
 of hamlets is.  It represents a success story
 in South Vietnam's desperate struggle to de-
 feat the Communist Insurgency.
 Phouc Chai is  about 45  miles west of
 Tamky, in the northern part of South Viet-
 nam.                                                              For more than 2 years, until 6 months
 ago, this valley, with its population of about
 6,000,  was  virtually controlled  by  the
 Vietcong.
 The insurgents grew rice here to feed the
 No. 35-7
 guerrillas.  They  "taxed"  farmers.  They
 maintained rest stations and assembly points
 for fighters who blew up bridges and ter-
 rorized villages.
 Two organized Vietcong battalions with a
 regimental headquarters  operated  without
 Government Interference.  Then a 34-year-
 old major, Hoang The, appeared with his
 outfit, the 6th Regiment of the 2d Division,
 Army of the Republic of Vietnam.
 TRAINED IN GEORGIA
 Major Tho has been an officer since 1951,
 when he fought for the French against the
 Communist Vietminh.  He received training
 at  the  U.S.  Army's military-government
 school at Fort Gordon, Ga., and at the Fort
 Denning, Ga., infantry training center.
 Articulate, English-speaking and self-con-
 fident, Major                                                                                                                                        The  has evidently won the
 complete confidence of his troops and of
 American advisers here. He lives in Danang
 with his wife and five children.
 He spoke matter-of-factly about having
 organized 10 defended hamlets after achiev-
 ing military victories over the Vietcong.
 Last February, the major recalled, he sent
 patrols into the valley.  They located Viet-
 cong units, ambushed some and drew others
 into stand-up battles of company and bat-
 talion size.
 REDS FOUGHT HARD
 The Vietcong fought hard for the valley;
 it was important as a source of food as well
 as a military center for the countrywide
 guerrilla campaign.  Yet in  a month the
 6th Regiment drove the Vietcong into the
 jungle.
 "It was only phase 1," Major Tho said.
 "Now came phase 2, the administrative and
 political phase."
 Major Tho stood with a pointer before
 an  operations  map  as  he  continued  his
 story.
 Before evacuating the valley, the Vietcong
 ordered the peasants to take 15 days' sup-
 plies  into  the                                                                                                                                    jungle.  They  assured  the
 peasants that the Government forces would
 not stay and that the Communists would
 soon resume control.
 But the Government forces stayed.     Major
 Tho and his men seized 40  tons of rice
 originally planted by the Vietcong.    They
 distributed 20 tons and destroyed the rest
 because they could not handle it and did
 not want the Vietcong to try to recapture it.
 THE PEASANTS EMERGE
 Two weeks went  by,  and  the      peasants
 came out of the jungle to reclaim their homes
 and farms.  "We let the people come back
 and keep their rice," Major Tho continued.
 "We said to them, 'You see, the Vietcong took
 your things, but we do not.'
 The major went on:
 "Many of the villagers came to us and de-
 nounced their neighbors as Vietcong.  Some
 gave me a list of 40 men to be executed. But
 I realized that many were not hard-core Viet-
 cong, only forced to do the bidding and pay
 allegiance to the Communists."
 Major Tho weeded out those he thought
 were incorrigible Vietcong members and sent
 them to higher headquarters.  Others, in-
 cluding some who had held positions under
 the Vietcong, he gave new assignments.
 "I recommended no executions," Major Tho
 added.  "I wanted to win the confidence of
 the people.  I called the chief villager and
 asked him how he had organized the villages,
 and with a few changes I let the organization,
 run the same old way for the time being.
 "I wanted to show that we would protect
 the people against the Vietcong, and I pro-
 vided special guards for those who took tasks
 as village administrators and hamlet chiefs.
 Every night I discussed village problems with
 the chiefs."

 WEAPONS ARE REDISTRIBUTED
 Then Major The collected weapons.  He
 paid for all that were turned In.  Most were
 rifles and carbines of varied origin. Some
 were American, captured from Government
 forces, and others were Russian and Chinese
 brought in from North Vietnam.
 After collecting all the weapons, the major
 added, he redistributed them in the hamlets,
 "I wanted to show confidence in the peo-
 ple," the major recalled.  "I said, 'Here, take
 the weapons, and use them against the Viet-
 cong if they bother you."'
 Major Tho retained one hamlet chief who
 had worked for the Vietcong, but he sent him
 to higher headquarters for questioning.  The
 man died while traveling, and Major Tho or-
 dered the body brought back for burial.                      He
 arranged a big funeral.
 GESTURE WITH A MORAL
 "I make propaganda, too," Majorf Tho ex-
 plained with a smile. "I wanted to show that
 even those who had served with the Vietcong
 could be forgiven and could take a proper
 place in our community."
 Now 10 Government hamlets flourish in a
 valley that was once a Vietcong stronghold.
 As Major The accompanied a visitor on a jeep
 ride to meet the people, they greeted him
 with apparent pleasure and showed off a new
 school  Pupils on roughhewn benches in a
 big shack were writing the alphabet in note-
 books.
 There have been no incidents in the valley
 for more than 4 months, and the Vietcong
 have apparently been unable to reestablish
 links with villagers who were once more than
 ready to help them.
 Yet all around the valley, the Vietco ng_ are
 known to patrol in strength.
 "They set up ambushes," the major said,
 "but they do not come within 2 or 3 miles
 of the valley.  We have established good
 morale here."
 VIETNAM HAMLET REPULSES REDS-PENTAGON
 RELEASES ACCOUNT or REcZNr CLASH
 (By Mark S. Watson)
 WASHINGTON, September  25.-Messages
 from the U.B. command in South Vietnam
 today permitted the Pentagon to supply in
 almost unprecedented detail an account of a
 well-conducted defense and counterattack
 recently, with the South Vietnam Govern-
 ment forces gaining a substantial success over
 Vietcong guerrillas.
 It was at and near Luong Phu, a little
 hamlet of some 75 men, women, and children
 in the swampy delta of the Mekong River,
 southwest of Saigon.  This is the region
 where the Communist Vietcong has long
 been generally in control, even before 1954
 when the beaten and discouraged French
 withdrew from southeast Asia.
 LOYAL TO GOVERNMENT
 Luong Phu, largely because it remained
 loyal to the government has long been sub-
 jected to Communist harassment, the dis-
 patch from Saigon mentioning 50 incidents
 thus far in 1964, including 16 genuine at-
 tacks, of which the  latest was the most
 violent.
 In the official account of this occasion
 there were several aspects so important as
 to attract attention.
 1. The 40 men composing the hamlet's
 own defense, only lightly armed, held off
 the attack, with temporary loss of only an
 ammunition bunker.
 2. A group of them had the spirit to
 counterattack and regain the bunker with-
 out loss of its contents, but with four of the
 loyal force killed.
 RELIEF FORCES CALLED
 3. A relief force, summoned by radio, came
 within artillery range and provided quick
 assistance to the defense,
 4. Therelief force commander, moving in
 by a U.S. landing craft (one of five in the
 Mekong Delta's rivers) was warned by one
 of his agents that a Vietcong force was in
 ambush near the riverbank, awaiting him,
 after the familiar guerrilla practice.
 He opened fire on the hidden guerrillas
 and broke up the ambush with large casual-
 ties, his own craft taking only one serious
 shot from the guerrillas' 57-millimeter rifle.
 The relief of Luong Phu was completed, with
 40 enemy dead around it and a larger number
 in the ambush party carried away by river
 boats.
 It was this combination of stout resistance
 at the attack point, prompt radio report to
 the district command, quick advance of relief
 forces, and alertness to the danger of am-
 bush, with which the Saigon authorities are
 obviously most pleased.
 PATTERN  OF COUNTERINSURGENCY
 This is the pattern of their counterin-
 surgency training, but nobody pretends that
 it is easy to accomplish that operation with
 all its four phases perfectly executed.  With
 any of the four missing, the whole opera-
 tion has small chance of success.
 The landing craft and patrol boats and
 motorized junks on the several rivers and
 canals  are-save for the helicopters-the
 prime means of rapid movement of rein-
 forcing troops  and weapons.   They make
 possible a fairly rapid use of guns and heavy
 mortars.
 The     other artillery  application  is  by
 mounts of single guns in an entrenched posi-
 tion (dotted over the countryside) permit-
 ting movement of the gun throughout 360?
 and prompt laying of fire on any target
 within range.
 This method presupposes the existence of
 excellent maps and prime ability to use them
 effectively for fire or an unseen target.  A
 most encouraging aspect of the war in South
 Vietnam is that the maps do exist and that
 there is ineresting skill in their efficient use.
 CONTINUING  MYSTERY
 There is one continuing mystery in Viet-
 nam, namely the reason for the Vietcong
 guerrillas' strange failure to take wide ad-
 vantage of the South Vietnam Government's
 semiparalysis as a result of the most recent
 coup.  It would have seemed the ideal time
 for massive assaults.
 A growing theory is that the guerrilla
 movement has been hurt more than is gen-
 erally realized, and compelled to slow down
 for a time In order to regather strength for
 another strong assault at widely scattered
 points.
 Such an assault is still thought likely, the
 surprise being that it was not timed to take
 advantage of governmental confusion.
 [From the Evening Star, Nov. 9, 1964]
 VIETNAM VILLAGERS FIGHT ON
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 MEKONG DELTA, SOUTH VIETNAM.-From the
 distance the boom of  artillery sounded a
 steady reminder that the frontlines of the
 war were at hand.
 A few rice paddies away there was the
 authoritative crackle of small arms fire which
 was, as to be expected, harassing the heli-
 copter that was whirring down on the dirt
 road next to the quaint and charming little
 village of thatched roofs that now gave haven
 to  the  broken  bodies  of  two  American
 sergeants killed by an electrically detonated
 landmine.
 It was a road of bitter memories,     this
 muddy,   tortured dirt lane  surrounded by
 emerald green rice paddies and a deceptively
 lyrical and limpid stream in which the big-
 eyed children played, not even looking up
 when  the angry  machinegun  bursts    got
 close and mere adults looked for cover.
 In the summer of 1963 there had been a
 nasty fire fight on the road, In which several
 American reporters lost face but not much
 else when they made a run for it. In Novem-
 ber                                                                                                                                 1963  this  reporter  revisited  the road
 and its villages on the day that it claimed
 the lives of two United Nations agricultural
 workers. And now the death of the two ser-
 geants.
 FAMILIES FIGHT REDS
 Yet, at the end of the road is a small
 village-Van Thien-whose 150 families have
 been overrun six times by the Vietcong and
 who still fight back.  And one reason they
 fight back is because every day American
 advisers and Vietnamese soldiers, American
 aid  teams and Vietnamese  engineers defy
 the danger and travel back and forth with
 their guns and supplies and medicines to help
 Van Thien try to stay free.
 And this is the real miracle of South Viet-
 nam-this fact that somehow the war is still
 fought anywhere at all with devotion and
 sacrifice and hope despite the selfish joust-
 ings of the politicians in Saigon, the power
 plays of the military, the riots of the draft-
 dodging students and the political poisons
 spread by a handful of power-hungry Bud-
 dhist leaders whose intrigues are totally dis-
 approved by the genuinely religious Bud-
 dhists here in the countryside.
 Indeed, here in this section of the delta,
 I found the progress of the war far less de-
 pressing than I had expected.  Chaos, lack of
 direction, arbitrary arrests, and purges have
 taken their toll, of course. But in giddy,
 gaudy Saigon the spoiled intellectuals and
 politicians do not know the Vietcong first-
 hand and can indulge their political death
 wishes with a garishly gay ignorance of what
 would happen to them if the Communists
 took over.
 VIETCONG DEPREDATIONS
 But in Van Thien it is only a short mo-?
 ment in time since the Vietcong disembow-
 eled the wife of the district chief and kid-
 naped 14 youngsters of the village.  So long
 as there is the sightest hope of real and
 effective outside help against the Vietcong,
 the people will fight to keep them out of the
 Van Thiens of the delta.
 Mytho is the headquarters for the  7th
 Vietnamese Division, which guards four key
 provinces in the delta.  When I first visited
 Van Thien In the summer of 1963, it had
 just been liberated for the first time from a
 long period of Vietcong rule.  And elsewhere
 in the delta, the fight against the Commu..
 nists, while tough and hard, was beginning
 to show results.  That summer perhaps 64
 percent of the population in these key four
 provinces  were  under  central  Vietnamese
 control.
 Then came the coup d'etat of November
 1963, the murder of Diem and Nhu, the dis-
 Integration of the entire fabric of Vietnam-
 ese  governmental  structure,  all  of  which
 was taken as a signal by the Vietcong to
 really go on the warpath. As a consequence,
 when this reporter revisited the 7th Division
 provinces in late November 1963, it had been
 impossible to even go near many areas that
 had been clean and clear of Vietcong the
 previous summer. By early 1964, the Viet-
 namese controlled less than 25 percent of
 these four provinces.
 NEED TO START OVER
 "And so," said the American colonel in
 Mytho, "we had to start over.  By April, we
 got a new and less ambitious pacification
 program.  Somehow despite the tumult in
 the cities the supplies kept coming.  Every-
 time a new coup d'etat was rumored every-
 thing ground to a halt, of course.
 "Slowly and painfully we have gone back
 into village after village.  It has been heart-
 warming to see places where we began with
 deserted marketplaces and burned school-
 houses soon make a comeback and become
 bustling again.  I think we can win this wa:r
 against the Vietcong.  I am an optimist.

 east Asia.  Such a plan, they point out,
 would offer incredible promise to Laos,
 Cambodia, and Thailand as well as to
 South Vietnam, and it would offer equal
 promise to the people of North Vietnam,
 which only the continued belligerence
 and noncooperation of their Government
 could frustrate.
 This, to me, sounds eminently sensi-
 ble.
 'FOR A COMMITMENT TO VICTORY
 If we decide to withdraw from Viet-
 nam we can certainly find plenty of ex-
 cuses to ease our path.  We can blame it
 on the geography; or on the topography;
 or on local apathy; or on political in-
 stability; or on religious strife; or even
 on anti-Americanism. But that will fool
 no one but ourselves. These conditions
 make our success there difficult, but only
 our own timidity and vacillation can
 make it impossible.
 It has become obvious that we cannot
 go on fighting this undeclared war under
 the rules laid down by our enemies.  We
 have reached the point where we shall
 have to make a great decision, a decision
 as to whether we are to take the hard
 steps necessary to turn the tide in Viet-
 nam or whether we are to refrain from
 doing so and thus lose inevitably by de-
 fault.
 The ultimate outcome of the cold war
 depends upon an affirmative decision to
 do whatever is necessary to achieve vic-
 tory in South Vietnam.  The events of
 recent weeks demonstrate again that the
 administration is not lacking in resolve
 and that it is rapidly approaching such a
 decision.  '
 Whether that means a larger commit-
 ment of forces, or continued retaliatory
 strikes against the North, or carrying
 guerrilla warfare to the enemy home-
 land, or completely sealing off South
 Vietnam from Communist aid-I say to
 the administration, "Give us the plan
 that will do the job, and we will support
 you."
 Whether our victory be near or far, can
 we, dare we, turn away or begin to turn
 away from the task before us, however
 frustrating or burdensome it may be?
 Here surely is a time for us to heed
 Santayana's maxim "Those who will not
 learn from the past are destined to re-
 peat it."
 And so I speak today not merely to urge
 that we stand fast in Vietnam, but also
 to urge that we meet head on the new
 isolationism in its incipient stages, before
 the long months and years of discontent,
 frustration, and weariness that lie ahead
 have swelled the chorus urging disen-
 gagement and withdrawal to a deafening
 roar.
 Let us expound a foreign policy nur-
 tured in our constantly growing strength,
 not one fed by fear and disillusionment;
 a policy which each year is prepared to
 expend more, not less, in the cause of
 preserving our country and the decencies
 of man.
 Let us insist upon a defense budget
 based upon the dangers we face abroad,
 not upon the benefits we seek at home.
 Let us, embrace a doctrine that refuses
 to yield to force, ever; that honors its
 commitments because we know that our
 good faith is the cement binding the free
 world together; a doctrine that recog-
 nizes in its foreign aid program not only
 that the rich are morally obligated to
 help the poor, but also that prosperity
 cannot permanently endure surrounded
 by poverty, and justice cannot conquer
 until its conquest is. universal.
 Let us, above all, encourage and inspire
 a national spirit worthy of our history,
 worthy  of  our  burgeoning,  bursting
 strength, in our arms, in our agriculture,
 in industry, in science, in finance, a spirit
 of confidence, of optimism, of willingness
 to accept new risks and exploit new op-
 portunities.
 And let us remember that providence
 has showered upon our people greater
 blessings than on any other, and that,
 great though our works have been, much
 greater is expected of us.
 In recent days, the free world has paid
 tribute to its greatest champion of our
 age, Winston Churchill.
 It is a curious thing that though
 Churchill is acknowledged on all sides
 as the preeminent figure of our time
 and as the highest embodiment of West-
 ern statesmanship, he was, throughout
 his life, and remains today, a prophet
 unheeded, a statesman whom men ven-
 erate but will not emulate.
 It may well be that Winston Church-
 ill's greatest legacy will prove to be, not
 the legacy of his immortal deeds, but
 that of his example and his precepts; and
 that freemen of the future will pay him
 the homage denied by his contempo-
 raries, the tribute of imitation and ac-
 ceptance of his message.
 As we ponder the passing of this he-
 roic figure and reflect upon his career
 and try to draw from it lessons which
 we might apply to the aggressive on-
 slaught that we face today in a hundred
 ways on a hundred fronts, we might
 take to heart this advice which he gave in
 the dark days of 1941 to the boys of Har-
 row, his old school :
 Never give in.  Never, never, never, never.
 Never yield to force and the apparently over-
 whelming might of the enemy.  Never yield
 in any way, great or small, large or petty,
 except to convictions of honor and good
 sense.
 Let us resolve to nail this message to
 the masthead of our ship of state in this
 year of decision.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD the
 following documents: First, a summary
 of Communist violations of the Laotian
 armistice prepared for me by the Library
 of Congress; second, a copy of a state-
 ment released yesterday by the American
 Friends of Vietnam, under the caption of
 "A New Policy for Vietnam"; third, a
 copy of a telegram to the President from
 the Veterans of Foreign Wars; fourth,
 various newspaper clippings bearing on
 the situation in Vietnam.
 There being no objection, the sundry
 documents were ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:

 From: Foreign Affairs Division.
 Subject: List of violations by the Commu-
 nist Pathet Lao of the Geneva armistice
 of 1961-62.
 July 27, 1962: Laotian cease-fire committee
 of the three factions (neutralists, rightists,
 and pro-Communist Pathet Lao) reaches an
 agreement on principles to implement a
 truce: forces of each faction will remain in

 and military supplies are not to be increased;
 and troops of the three factions will not at-
 tack each other.
 August 22, 1962: Several companies of pro-
 Communist Pathet Lao troops attack out-
 posts of rightist forces near Sam Neua in
 northeastern Laos.
 November 27, 1962: U.S. C-123 cargo plane,
 flying rice and other supplies to neutralist

 Le are attacked and suffer new setbacks.  On
 April 16 U.S. Under Secretary of State George
 Ball says that the United States does not
 rule out the possibility of sending troops
 Into Laos if the situation should continue to
 deteriorate.  Warnings are also issued by Sec-
 retary of State Dean Rusk on April 18 and
 President Kennedy on April 19.
 May 3, 1963: Pathet Lao troops fire on two
 helicopters of the International Control Com-
 mission in the Plaine des Jarres, destroying
 one and wounding four occupants.  On May

 violating the Geneva accords, and he says
 that the United States will never leave Laos
 standing alone "to face its enemies from
 within and abroad."
 May 21, 1963: Premier Souvanna Phouma
 issues communique stating that severe fight-
 ing has been going on for 2 days in the

 A NEw POLICY FOR VIETNAM
 (Statement by the American Friends of Viet-
 nam)
 THE DILEMMA
 If we are to identify wisely our most effec-
 tive forward course in Vietnam, it is impor-
 tant first to understand the exact nature of
 our dilemma there.  We know the inherent
 generosity, both toward free Vietnam and its
 neighboring countries, which has led us to
 Involve our substance and our blood.  We
 know that but for our commitment, free Viet-
 nam would long since have fallen into the
 political darkness and physical despair which
 oppresses Communist North Vietnam.    We
 know that our presence there is In response
 to the wish of most segments of Vietnamese
 leadership, however they differ among them-
 selves on other matters.  We know that our
 presence there is earnestly desired by most
 neighboring countries of southeast Asia. We
 know that our purpose is to assist responsible
 and responsive government and to enable
 Vietnam and its neighbors to maintain na-
 tional independence against external en-
 croachment. We know that we have neither
 wished to "establish" nor "dominate" a Viet-
 namese government nor to seek for ourselves
 political, military, or economic advantage.
 Our,dilemma flows in part from the fact
 that this knowledge is not shared by all of
 the Vietnamese people, is not accepted by the
 members of the Vietcong, is not believed in
 parts of the less developed world still suf-
 fering the scars of recent colonial experience.
 Nor, in fact, is this understanding uniformly
 shared by our own people.
 The dilemma is sharpened further by a
 spreading doubt among leadership elements
 In independent southeast Asian countries
 that the United States has staying power.
 Thailand's foreign minister, Thanat Kho-
 man, recently warned members of the Over-
 seas Press  Club:  "The  Thai  Government
 knows much better but some people are not
 sure we can depend on outside help-especial-
 ly when there is so much talk of quitting and
 going home.  The Communists have never
 spoken- that line of quitting. When they go
 some place they stay there."
 In part, at least, this skepticism is fos-
 tered by the doubt among some Americans
 that any valid purpose led to our presence
 in Vietnam in the first place.
 THE ALTERNATIVES
 The lack of public understanding flows in
 part  from inadequate examination of the
 alternatives confronting the United States
 now. In our opinion there are six choices:
 1. Continue as now, Whether or not the
 Vietcong are, in fact, increasing their ef-
 fectiveness there is a growing conviction in
 Saigan, in the United States, and in much
 of the rest of the world, that this is so.
 This alone makes continuation of our present
 policy undesirable.   The overriding hazard
 of the present policy is the undeniable fact
 that it has not provided sufficient psycho-
 logical  and political potency to sustain a
 Vietnamese Government.
 2. Withdraw.  This would violate our pledge
 not to abandon the Vietnamese people.  It
 would manifest throughout the world a U,S.
 inability to long sustain an effort designed
 to frustrate Communist intentions.  The im-
 plications would be read as eloquently in
 Berlin or in Cuba, as they would be in Viet-
 nam, Indonesia, or India.  There can be no
 question that this alternative would require
 the Governments of the Phillippines, Thai-
 land, Taiwan, India, Japan, to reassess totally
 present policy and to reorient toward what
 would he the dominating new facts of Asian
 life.
 ("Neutralization" of Vietnam is not sug-
 gested here for a simple reason; genuine and
 reliable neutralization of Vietnam is not pos-
 sible at the present time. What is most often
 talked of in this connection is merely a
 rhetorical  euphemism  designed  to  make
 withdrawal more palatable.   On the other
 hand, the proposals discussed here are valu-
 able to part precisely because they do hold
 the promise that they may generate sufficient
 free Vietnamese vitality to make true and
 assured  neutralization possible  at  some
 future time.)
 S. Military cordon sanitaire across Viet-
 nam and Laos.  An estimated military force
 of up to 100,000 would be involved in mak-
 ing such a cordon truly effective and enemy
 penetration genuinely hazardous.  Its great-
 est contribution would be in providing hard
 evidence of new determination to maintain
 southeast Asian  Integrity.  Although mili-
 tary effect of interdicting the Vietcong's
 transport and supply may be limited, it is
 nonetheless  one  useful alternative,  espe-
 cially when employed with other steps out-
 lined here.
 4. Extend military action to the north.
 Until last week, steps taken in this di-
 rection were, in our judgment, not suffi-
 ciently explicit, either to rekindle Vietnam-
 ese faith In our intentions or to inspire con-
 fidence In other Asian countries that we are
 indeed willing to accept risk as the price
 of our commitment to freedom.   The in-
 creased external, Communist intervention in
 South Vietnam has made it both reasonable
 and essential that there be a vigorous anti-
 Communist military response.  The limited
 air strikes in North Vietnam by American
 and Vietnamese planes constituted such an
 appropriate response.
 There are many other forms of stronger
 American action and involvement and they
 are not mutually exclusive.  They include:
 (a) Formation of an open, well-publicized
 North Vietnam liberation movement spon-
 soring major psychological operations pro-
 grams, including paramilitary action, against
 the North Vietnamese- regime.
 (b)  Establishment of an International
 Voluntary Corps dedicated to the mainte-
 nance of free nations in the Mekong basin.
 This corps should consist primarily of vol-
 unteers from Asian countries but may also
 contain a liberal admixture of Americans
 with military experience.  Operating nor-
 mally in small units with sufficient air sup-
 port, this force-under the sponsorship of
 the  proposed  North  Vietnam  Liberation
 Movement-would harass the enemy wher-
 ever suitable targets exist, including targets
 within North Vietnam.
 (c)  Positioning of U.S.  combat forces
 within South Vietnam to act as a general
 reserve-a sizable firefighting force.   Such
 a military contingent (perhaps as many as
 two brigades) should not be used for routine
 combat or security duties, but as an imme-
 diate-reaction  fighting force intended                                                                           to
 engage  Vietcong troops in fixed positions.
 Desirably, combat elements from other na-
 tions will be attached to this force.
 (d) Continued bombing of selected mili-
 tary targets in North Vietnam.  In contrast
 to the indiscriminate terrorist activity of the
 Vietcong in South Vietnam, the free world's
 concern for the Vietnamese people in both
 halves of the country make it undesirable for
 us to conduct warfare upon cities where the
 innocent will be hurt.  However, those mili-
 tary targets in North Vietnam which are vital
 to their aggressive capability and which can
 be destroyed with our assistance are, in our
 view, legitimate targets for stage-by-stage
 destruction.
 What is the risk involved in such action?
 In our judgment the possibility of Chinese
 involvement In South Vietnam would be only
 slightly increased.  The possibility of Chi-
 nese help thrust upon North Vietnam would
 be greater.  However, this probability may be
 precisely what is needed to make clear` to
 even the most Communist leaders of North
 Vietnam how undesirable such help is to
 them in the long run.  A heightened aware-
 ness of this danger might, in fact, force
 greater restraint upon the Government in
 Hanoi than our present policy can achieve.
 Frankly, however, the direct military dam-
 age inflicted on the Communist regime in
 North Vietnam is the lesser of our reasons
 for suggesting that these steps be under-
 taken.                                                                                                                                   In our opinion, it is urgent that the
 people of free Vietnam be assured that Presi-
 dent Johnson means what he says-that we
 mean to stay and help, no matter what risks
 we must incur.  It is equally urgent that
 these  Intentions  be  understood  also  in
 Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
 the rest of Asia, and the world.  Stanch,
 long-term    American    commitment-fully
 communicated and understood-would pro-
 vide a lift to morale in free Vietnam, inject
 new vitality in the Vietnamese Government
 and require a new assessment of the United
 States  among  neighboring  countries  and
 among Asian allies elsewhere.
 There is one final reason we support this
 painful course of action.   Basic require-
 ments for victory in Vietnam are not primar-
 ily military.  They are psychological, social,
 and economic.  Below we address ourselves
 to instruments which can meet the nonmili-
 tary-aspects of the undertaking. But neither
 the economic nor political measures we pro-
 pose will get off the ground without evidence
 of the seriousness of our military Intention
 Nor will our military commitment produce
 the desired results without the companion
 economic and psychological supports.
 America's experience in relation to the in-
 stability in postwar Europe is clearly rele-
 vant.  The Marshall plan did not begin to
 come to life until, the physical security prom-
 ised by NATO was added.  Nor would NATO
 by itself have been meaningful without the
 human vision and economic future presented
 by the Marshall plan.
 5. Forging a more popular or responsive
 government.  It is clear that the difficulties
 confronting any Vietnamese Government un-
 der Communist attack are enormous.  We
 can but sympathize with those who carry
 the burdens of government in circumstances
 so frustrating and continuously demanding.
 It Is possible that 20 years of civil war, co-
 lonial war, and Communist insurrectionary
 war, have so debilitated the structure of gov-
 ernment as to preclude the immediate pos-
 siblity, no matter how desirable, of absolutely
 stable government.  There are political per-
 sonalities with nationalist backgrounds who
 are deserving of our help and encourage-
 ment.  We must do what we can to help them
 and bring them forward.  At the same time,
 we must help to diminish the present conflict
 of personalities that has proved in past years
 to be so destructive. In any event, we believe
 it is futile to concentrate, as we have in the
 past, on personalities, rather than on pur-
 poses, ideas, and institutions.
 6. Injection of new purpose.   If charis-
 matic leadership is unavailable, charismatic
 purpose can be found.  One aspect of that
 purpose involves the modest extension of
 military effort discussed above. It involves
 the clear  demonstration  that the United
 States means to remain committed even at
 enlarged risk.  And such charismatic pur-
 pose must, of necessity, accept as workable
 "the best available choices of Vietnamese
 Government  personnel"-choices  made  by
 the Vietnamese not by us.  But our object
 would be to harness our military commit-
 ment and the Vietnamese effort to an in-
 finitely larger objective than has previously
 motivated our participation.  It would make
 crystal clear that the objectives which unite
 us with the Vietnamese people, aswith our
 other allies on southeast Asia, are construc-
 tive and inextricably linked to the welfare
 of all southeast Asian peoples.

 and how much they have done to under-
 mine the fight against Communists.
 No stable government can be created
 in Vietnam without the participation and
 support of responsible Buddhist leader-
 ship.  But this responsible leadership
 cannot be found among the handful of
 monks of questionable antecedents who
 have been misdirecting the militant
 Buddhist movement in the cities of Viet-
 nam.
 It is time to speak bluntly on this issue.
 THE FALLACY OF THE FRENCH ANALOGY
 Over and over again in recent months
 I have heard it said that our position in
 Vietnam  is  impossible  because  the
 French, who knew Vietnam so much bet-
 ter than we do, were compelled to admit
 defeat after 8 years of war against the
 Vietminh. A recent half-page adver-
 tisement in the NewYork Times asked:
 "How can we win in Vietnam with less
 than 30,000 advisers, when the French
 could not win with an army of nearly
 half a million?"
 .Our own position is entirely different
 from the French position in Indochina.
 The French were a colonial power, ex-
 ploiting and imposing their will on the
 Indochinese people and stubbornly deny-
 ing them their freedom.  The French
 military effort in Indochina was doomed
 because it had against it not only the
 Communists  but  the  overwhelming
 majority of the Indochinese people. it
 was a war fought by Frenchmen against
 Indochinese,
 The United States, however, does not
 seek to impose its control on Vietnam or
 exploit Vietnam. We are not a colonial
 power. We seek only to help the people
 of South Vietnam defend their freedom
 against an insurgency that is inspired
 and directed and aided by the North Viet-
 namese Communists. This is understood
 by the Vietnamese people.  And that is
 why hundreds of thousands of Vietnam-'
 ese who fought with Ho Chi Minh against
 the French are today fighting for the
 Saigon government against the Vietcong.
 That is why the war against the Viet-
 cong can be won, while the war of French
 colonialism against the Indochinese inde-
 pendence movement was doomed from
 the outset.   There is no similarity in
 the two situations that has any meaning
 or validity.
 WHAT CAN BE DONE?
 I believe the war in. Vietnam can be
 won without a significant increase in our
 military effort.  There are many things
 that can be done to improve the perform-
 ance of our side, and most of them lie
 essentially in the nonmilitary field.
 Let me set forth some of the things
 that I believe can be done.
 THE NEED FOR IMPROVED LIAISON
 One of the most obvious and most seri-
 ous weaknesses of the American position
 in Vietnam is the lack of adequate liaison
 with the leaders of the various sectors of
 the Vietnamese, community.
 Because of this lack of communication,
 we have frequently been caught un-
 awares. by developments; we have re-
 mained without serious ability to influ-
 ence them; and we have not been able to
 effectively assist the Vietnamese in com-
 municating with each other and in sta-
 bilizing the political situation in Saigon.
 No one person is to blame for this. It
 is, rather, the system which rotates mili-
 tary officers and AID officials and other
 Americans in Vietnam on an annual or
 2-year basis.
 As one American officer pointed out in
 a recent interview, "It takes about 8
 months before you can really get to know
 the country and the people.  And, just
 about the time you are beginning to
 understand something, you are rotated
 home and that is the end of your utility."
 I believe that something can be done to
 improve this situation.
 I have met a number of Americans,
 former soldiers and former AID officials,
 who have spent 5 years or more in Viet-
 nam, have built up personal friendships
 with leaders of every sector of the Viet-
 namese community, enjoy the confidence
 of the Vietnamese because of their
 understanding and dedication, and who
 would jump at the opportunity to return
 to Vietnam for the purpose of helping it
 in this critical hour.  I am told that
 there may be as many as 10 or 12 such
 people in this country.
 I have proposed in a letter to the
 President that these Americans be con-
 stituted into a liaison group and that
 they be dispatched to Saigon imme-
 diately for the purpose of helping the
 Embassy to establish the broadest and
 most effective possible liaison with the
 army leaders, with the Buddhists, with
 the intellectual community, and with the
 Vietnamese political leaders.
 I know that there is always a tendency
 on the part of World War II officers to
 resent World War I officers, and on the
 part of those who are involved in a situa-
 tion today to resist the assistance of
 those who preceded them.  There is also
 sometimes a tendency for those who were
 there yesterday to believe that they
 understand things better than those who
 are there today.
 But this is a situation in which I am
 confident every American, no matter
 what his rank, will seek to rise above his
 personal prejudices. It is a situation that
 demands the utilization of every ounce
 of experience and dedication available
 to us.
 It is my earnest personal conviction
 that the dispatch of such a liaison group
 to Saigon would result in an early im-
 provement in our ability to communicate
 with the Vietnamese and in our ability to
 assist them in achieving the political sta-
 bility which is essential to the successful
 prosecution of the war.
 THE NEED FOR A STEPPED-UP POLITICAL WARFARE
 EFFORT
 From many conversations with Viet-
 namese and with Americans who have
 served in various capacities in Vietnam,
 I am convinced that another one of our
 major weaknesses lies in the field of po-
 litical warfare.
 We have, by and large, been trying to
 meet the Communist insurgency by tra-
 ditional military methods or by tradi-
 tional methods slightly tailored to meet
 the special requirements of guerrilla war-
 fare.                                                       In the field of political warfare,
 where the Communists have scored their
 most spectacular triumphs, our own ef-
 fort has been limited, and halting, and
 amateurish, and, in fact, sadly ineffec-
 tive.
 The prime goal of political warfare, as
 it must be waged by freemen, is to win
 men's minds. The prime goal of political
 warfare, as it is waged by the Commu-
 nists, is to erode and paralyze the will to
 resist by means of total error.
 An effective political warfare program
 requires three major ingredients: First,
 a handful of basic slogans which capsul-
 ize popular desires and which are capable
 of striking responsive chords in the
 hearts of the people; second, a propa-
 ganda apparatus capable of conveying
 this program both to those on the Gov-
 ernment side and those on the side of the
 insurgents; third, specially trained cad-
 res to direct the effort.
 But the slogans we have are inade-
 quate.                                                                                               Our propaganda program is dis-
 mally weak compared with that of the
 Communists.  And according to my in-
 formation, we still have not assisted the
 Vietnamese to set up an intensive train-
 ing program in Communist cold war
 methods and how to counter them.
 An article in the New York Times on
 August 3, 1964, pointed out that in every
 area "the basic cutting tool of the Viet-
 cong is a squad of about 10 armed men
 and women whose primary function is
 propaganda." The article also said that
 "Most of the experts in psychological
 warfare and propaganda here believe the
 Vietcong's agitprop teams have done the
 Saigon government more damage than
 even the tough Vietcong regular batta-
 lions."  Finally, the article made the
 point that according to estimates there
 were 320 Vietcong "agitprop" teams
 working in the country, against 20 "in-
 formation teams" for the government
 side. This gave the Vietcong an edge of
 16 to 1 in the field of propaganda per-
 sonnel. And the edge was probably even
 greater in terms of finesse and effective-
 ness.
 Even if we help the South Vietnamese
 Government intensify its propaganda ef-
 fort, there would still remain the prob-
 lem of basic goals and slogans.
 I have pointed out that the Vietnamese
 people have a proud history and a strong
 sense of national unity. All Vietnamese,
 whether they live in the north or south,
 would like to see a unified and peaceful
 Vietnam. But as matters now stand, only
 the Communists are able to hold forth
 the prospect of the reunification of Viet-
 nam.                                                                                               To date we have not given the
 South Vietnamese Government the green
 light to set up a "Committee for the
 Liberation of North Vietnam," as coun-
 terpart to the "Liberation Front" which
 the Communists have set up in the south.
 This places the South Vietnamese side
 at a grave disadvantage.
 There are any number of patriotic
 North Vietnamese refugees who have
 been itching for the opportunity to set
 up a Liberation Committee for the North.
 The establishment of such a committee
 could, in my opinion, have an immediate
 and profound impact on the conduct of
 But above all, the situation in Vietnam
 underscores the need for an effective
 training program in political warfare,

 for our own foreign service and military
 personnel so that they can help to com-
 municate this knowledge to nationals of
 other countries who, like the South Viet-
 namese, are engaged in a life-and-death
 struggle for survival against the most
 cunning and most ruthless practitioners
 of political warfare history has ever
 known.
 In this connection, I wish to bring
 to the attention of my colleagues the
 fact that there has been pending before
 Congress for some 6 years a bill calling
 for the establishment of a Freedom
 Academy.  This would be an institu-
 tion where Americans and citizens of
 other free countries could receive con-
 centrated training in Communist tech-
 niques and operations, and in tactics and
 methods designed to frustrate the Com-
 munists at every operational level, from
 elections for the control of trade unions
 and student organizations, to street riots,
 to attempted insurrections.
 The Senate Judiciary Committee in
 reporting this measure to the floor in
 May of 1960, described the bill as "one
 of the most important measures ever in-
 troduced in the Congress."  But, unfor-
 tunately, although the bill was passed
 by the Senate, the House took no action.
 When the bill was reintroduced for the
 third time in early 1963, it has the spon-
 sorship  of  the  following  Senators:
 MUNDT, DOUGLAS, CASE, DoDD, SMATHERS,
 Goldwater, PROXMIRE,  FONG, HICKEN-
 LOOPER, MILLER, Keating, LAUSCHE, and
 SCOTT.
 The distinguished senior Senator from
 South Dakota last Friday reintroduced
 the measure for the fourth time, and it is
 now lying on the table, so that those who
 wish to add their names as cosponsors
 may do so.  It is my earnest hope that
 the measure will have the sponsorship
 of an even larger bipartisan group of
 Senators than it did in 1963.  It is my
 hope too that there will be no further
 delay, no foot dragging, in enacting this
 long-overdue measure.  It is time, high
 time, that we recognize the imperative
 need to equip ourselves and our allies
 with the knowledge and the trained per-
 sonnel required to meet the Communist
 onslaught.
 CARRYING THE GUERRILLA WAR TO THE NORTH
 First of all, I think there is a growing
 acceptance of the need for punishing the
 North with hit-and-run raids. It would
 be much more effective if these raids
 could be carried out in the name of a
 North Vietnamese Liberation Front than
 in the name of the South Vietnamese
 Government.
 Second, I have reason for believing
 that increasing consideration is being
 given to the need for countering the Viet-
 cong insurgency in the South with a
 guerrilla warfare effort in the North.
 In May of 1961, when I returned from
 Laos and Vietnam, I made a statement,
 which I should like to repeat today :
 The best way for us to stop Communist
 guerrilla action in Laos and in South Viet-
 nam is to send guerrilla forces into North
 Vietnam; to equip and supply those patriots
 already in the field; to make every Commu-
 nist official fear the just retribution of an
 outraged humanity; to make every Commu-
 nist arsenal, government building, commu-
 n1cations center and transportation facility
 a target for sabotage; to provide a rallying
 point for the great masses of oppressed peo-
 ple who hate communism because they have
 known it.  Only when we give the Commu-
 nists more trouble than they can handle at
 home, will they cease their aggression against
 the outposts of freedom.
 I believe that every word I said in 1961
 .is doubly valid today. It is not too late to
 embark upon such a program. And if we
 do give the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment the green light to embark upon it
 on an effective, hard-hitting scale, again
 I think it would add significantly to the
 psychological impact of the entire pro-
 gram if all guerrilla activities were car-
 ried out in the name of the "Committee
 for the Liberation of the North."
 A FEW MILITARY SUGGESTIONS
 I do not pretend to be a military ex-
 pert. But I have discussed the situation
 in Vietnam with a number of military
 men of considerable experience in the
 area, and I have been encouraged to be-
 lieve that the several suggestions which
 I have to make in this field are realistic.
 I submit them for the consideration
 of my colleagues, because I think they
 make sense.
 My-first proposition is that we cannot
 regard the war in Vietnam in isolation
 from the rest of southeast Asia.
 The Communist Party over which Ho
 Chi Minh presided for many years was
 the Communist Party of Indochina. In-
 deed, to this day, there is no such thing
 as a Communist Party in Vietnam.  Ho
 Chi Minh's thinking and strategy are
 directed toward the reunification of all
 the former territories of French Indo-
 china under his personal sway.                                                        This
 makes it imperative for us to develop a
 coordinated strategy for the entire area
 if we are to cope effectively with the
 Communist strategy.
 Proposition No. 2 is that there are
 certain dramatic military actions open
 to us that do not involve the territory of
 North Vietnam.
 The hub of the Ho Chi Minh trail is
 the town of Tchepone, Inside the Lao-
 tian frontier, just south of the 17th par-
 allel, the dividing line between North
 Vietnam and South Vietnam.  Through
 Tchepone pour most of the reinforce-
 ments and equipment from North Viet-
 nam.  From Tchepone the men and
 equipment are infiltrated into South
 Vietnam along hundreds of different
 jungle trails.
 I recall that when I met with Presi-
 dent Diem in April of 1961, he urged that
 the Americans assist him and the Laotian
 Government in preemptive action to
 secure three key centers in the Laotian
 Panhandle-Tchepone,  Saravane,  and
 Attopeu-in order to prevent the large-
 scale infiltration which is today taking
 place. I still have a copy of the marked
 map which he gave me in Outlining his
 project.  Had Diem's advice been fol-
 lowed there would have been no Ho Chi
 Minh trail. But this was at the time of
 the Laotian armistice and we were not
 disposed to take any actions which might
 provoke the Laotian Communists.  So
 nothing was done.
 The seizure of Tchepone by Laotian
 and Vietnamese forces, with American
 air support would, I have been assured,
 be a feasible military operation and one
 that could be carried out with the means
 available to us on the spot.  It would
 do more to put a crimp in the Ho Chi
 Minh trail than any amount of bombing
 we could attempt.  And it would have
 as dramatic an impact on the situation
 in Taos as on the situation in Vietnam.
 Finally, there is the matter of collec-
 tive action by the SEATO nations.
 As late as April of 1961, the SEATO na-
 tions in the Immediate area of the
 Philippines,  Thailand, Australia, New
 Zealand, and Pakistan-all favored com-
 mon  action                                                                                               against the  Communist
 menace in Laos. But the British and
 French were opposed to such action, and
 we ourselves sat on the fence; and the
 result was that nothing was done.
 The charter of SEATO will have to be
 modified so that one nation cannot veto
 collective action by all the other nations.
 Britain, I am inclined to believe, would
 now be disposed to support collective ac-
 tion by SEATO because of the situation
 in Malaysia. But, perhaps France should
 be invited to leave SEATO, on the
 grounds that she has no vital interests in
 the area, and her entire attitude toward
 Red China is one of appeasement.  In
 view of the fact that something has to be
 done immediately, however, the sensible
 course is to encourage collective action
 by the free nations in the area, outside
 the framework of SEATO, until SEATO
 can be reorganized in a manner that
 makes it effective.
 In this connection, I am most encour-
 aged by the news that South Korea has
 decided to send a contingent of several
 thousand military engineers to South
 Vietnam, and the Philippines have de-
 cided to do likewise.  It is Infinitely bet-
 ter from every standpoint to have Asian
 troops supporting the Vietnamese forces
 against the Vietcong on the ground, than
 it is to have American troops actively in-
 volved.
 THE NEED FOR UNDERSCORING OUR
 LONG-TERM COMMITMENT
 The retaliatory strikes ordered by
 President Johnson against the North
 have had the effect of reiterating our
 commitment in a manner that the Com-
 munists understand; and this, in the
 long run, is probably more important
 than the damage wrought by these
 strikes.
 But if the Communists are to be dis-
 couraged from continuing this costly
 war, Ive must seek every possible means
 of underscoring our determination to
 stand by the people of South Vietnam,
 to pay whatever cost may be necessary,
 and to take whatever risk may be neces-
 sary to prevent the Communists from
 subjugating the Vietnamese people and
 other people in the area.
 It is important to reiterate our resolve
 at every opportunity.  And it is even
 more important to translate this resolve
 into hard political and military actions.
 The American Friends of Vietnam
 have suggested another dramatic meas-
 ure.  They have suggested a commit-
 ment to a massive southeast Asian de-
 velopment program based on the har-
 nessing of the Mekong River-a kind of
 Tennessee. Valley Authority for south-

 telligence has admittedly been inade-
 quate-one of the reasons, certainly.
 But this is a situation that could change
 dramatically if we succeeded in convinc-
 ing the Vietnamese people of our deter-
 mination to help them retain their free-
 dom, and if we succeeded in inflicting a
 number of significant defeats on the
 enemy.
 THE BUDDHIST FALLACY
 I now wish to discuss the Buddhist sit-
 uation, about which we have heard for
 several years now.
 The myth of Buddhist persecution and
 the parallel myth that the Buddhists are
 opposed to the Government, have be-
 cause of the so-called militant Buddhist
 movement, become important political
 factors in Vietnam. It is, therefore, im-
 portant that we should seek to under-
 stand the nature of this movement, the
 motivation of its leaders, and the real
 degree of Influence it exerts over the
 Vietnamese people.
 It is, indeed, idle to debate the subject
 of Vietnam and our policy there and not
 understand the so-called Buddhist Prob-
 lem.  There has been much loose talk
 about it, but there has thus far been little
 hard, factual information.
 The campaign which resulted in the
 overthrow of President Diem was marked
 by the charge that he had subjected the
 Buddhist religion to inhuman persecu-
 tion; and, in protest against this alleged
 persecution, a number of Buddhist monks
 went through the horrifying ritual of
 self-immolation.
 Week after week, month after month,
 the American people and the people of
 the world were inundated with stories
 supporting the charge that Diem was
 persecuting the Buddhist religion. There
 were a number of experienced corre-
 spondents of national reputation who
 challenged the authenticity  of these
 stories.  But their voices were drowned
 by the torrent of charges and allegations
 that appeared in some of our major news-
 papers, and that were lent  further
 credence because of repetition of our of-
 fical information agencies.
 At the invitation of President Diem, the
 U.N. General Assembly decided to send a
 factfinding mission to South Vietnam to
 look into the situation. I find this rarely
 referred to in any discussion of the Bud-
 dhist question, but It is a fact that the
 United Nations did send a mission over
 there.
 While the mission was still in the coun-
 try, President Diem and his brother,
 Ngo Dinh Nhu, were overthrown and
 assassinated.
 The mission decided that the overthrow
 of Diem made it unnecessary to come up
 with a formal finding.  I believe that
 this was most regrettable. But the-sum--
 mary of the testimony which it had taken
 in Vietnam pointed strongly to the con-
 clusion that the persecution of the
 Buddhists was either nonexistent or
 vastly exaggerated and that the agita-
 tion was essentially political.  This, in
 essence, was what I was told in a per-
 sonal conversation with Ambassador Per-
 ma:ndo Volio Jiminez, of Costa Rica, who
 had introduced the motion calling for the
 setting up of the U.N. mission and who
 served as a member of it.
 I went to New York and saw Ambas-
 sador Volio.  I said, "Mr. Ambassador, I
 understand you were a member of the
 United Nations commission which went
 to Vietnam. I should like to ask you
 what the facts are." Ambassador Volio
 gave me the facts as I have given them to
 you here.
 Ambassador Pinto, of Dohomey, an-
 other member of the U.N. mission, ex-
 pressed himself in similar terms in
 public.
 The entire tragic story suggests that
 the free world was made the victim of a
 gigantic propaganda hoax, as a result of
 which the legitimate government of
 President Diem was destroyed and a
 chaotic situation created which has in-
 evitably played into the hands of the
 Communists.
 If Senators have not yet had time to
 read the report of the U.N. factflnding
 mission to Vietnam, I urge them to do so
 because it throws essential light on the
 current  activities  of  the  militant
 Buddhists. I am arranging to have copies
 mailed to every Senator, and I hope that
 all Senators will read it, because they
 will learn a great deal about the present
 Buddhist situation from it.
 The first fact which needs to be estab-
 lished in evaluating the militant Buddhist
 movement is that the Buddhists do not
 constitute 80 or 85 percent of the popula-
 tion, as was widely reported at the time
 of the Buddhist crisis. According to Dr.
 Mai Tho Truyen, one of the greatest au-
 thorities on Vietnam Buddhism theViet-
 namese Buddhists number approxi;Yiately
 4 million people, or about 30 percent of
 the population.
 The second point that must be made is
 that the militant Buddhists constitute
 only a small fraction of the total Bud-
 dhist population.  The millions of the
 Buddhist peasants, in their great ma-
 jority, do not approve of the militant
 political actions and the government-
 toppling intrigues of the Buddhist mili-
 tants in Saigon. Their activities, indeed,
 run completely counter to the pacific
 traditions of the Buddhist religion.
 It is questionable whether the Bud-
 dhist militants have been able to mobilize
 as many as 50,000 active supporters in
 all the demonstrations they have staged
 in Saigon and Hue and other cities. But
 because political power resides in the
 cities, the several tens of thousands of
 Buddhist militants, by their clamor and
 their persistent demonstrations and their
 clever propaganda, have succeeded in
 creating the impression that they speak
 for the people of the cities and for the
 majority of the people of Vietnam.
 What do the Buddhist militants want?
 Before the overthrow of President Diem,
 Thich Tri Quang told Marguerite Hig-
 gins frankly: "We cannot get an arrange-
 ment with the north until we get rid -3f
 Diem and Nhu."
 The evidence Is clear that Thich Tri
 Quang and some of his other militants
 are still bent on an agreement with the
 north.  Indeed, only last Friday, Quang
 called for U.S. negotiations with Ho Chi
 Minh.
 If there is reason to believe that Thich
 Tri Quang is a neutralist, there is even
 more reason for fearing that some of the
 other members of the Buddhist opposi-
 tion movement are openly pro-Commu-
 nist or that they have become tools of
 the rather substantial Communist infil-
 tration which is known to exist in the
 Buddhist clergy in the various countries
 of Asia.
 That such an infiltration should exist
 is not surprising because there are no
 barriers to it.
 A man who wants to become a Bud-
 dhist monk does not have to prepare him-
 self for his ministry by engaging in
 studies, nor does he have to be ordained,
 nor does he take any vow.
 He simply shaves his head and dons
 the saffron robe and enters a monas-
 tery-and overnight he becomes one of
 the religious elite.
 When he wishes to leave the mon-
 astery, he sheds his robe and leaves it;
 if he wishes to reenter, he dons his robe
 again and reenters.  That is all there
 is to it.
 I do not criticize this procedure on
 religious grounds.
 Buddhism is one of the great religions
 of mankind and much can be said for
 an arrangement that enables every man
 of religious disposition to spen-l at least
 a portion of his life under the voluntary
 monastic  discipline  characteristic  of
 Buddhism.
 But, regrettably, it is a procedure that
 leaves the door wide open to Communist
 Infiltration.
 I remember that when we were digging
 into the files of the Nazis at Nuremberg,
 we found that Hitler had under consider-
 ation a  program of Infiltrating the
 churches by inducing young people to
 enter seminaries, so that he could have
 them at his disposal.
 When I first began to hear of the
 Buddhist situation, it occurred to me
 that more than likely there was a sim-
 ilar infiltration of religion at work.
 The militant Buddhists have used the
 influence and prestige which accrued to
 them from the overthrow of Diem for
 the prime purpose of making stable gov-
 ernment impossible: in this sense, what-
 ever the intent of their leaders, they
 have been serving the desires of the
 Communist Vietcong.
 They have organized demonstrations,
 provoked riots, inflamed passions with
 highly publicized fasts and self -Immola-
 tions, and subjected the government to
 a ceaseless propaganda barrage.  They
 overthrew  the  Khanh     government.
 Then they overthrew the Huong govern-
 Unent which succeeded it.  And they
 seem to be intent on making things im-
 possible for any government that may
 come to power.
 It is, of course, difficult to deal with a
 political conspiracy that camouflages it-
 self in religious robes. In any case, this
 is a matter for the Vietnamese Govern-
 ment and not for our own Government.
 But it would make matters immeasur-
 ably easier for the Vietnamese authori-
 ties if the true facts about Buddhism
 in Vietnam were given to the American
 people and If they could be helped to
 understand how little the Buddhist mili-
 tants really represent, how nefarious
 their political activities have really been,

 After the Geneva agreement, it had
 been the expectation of the Communists
 that South Vietnam would collapse in
 administrative and political chaos be-
 fore many months had passed, and that
 it would fall into their hands like an
 overripe plum.  Indeed, when Ngo Dinh
 Diem took office as Premier after the
 surrender of North Vietnam to the Com-
 munists, 99 percent of the Western press
 viewed the situation in South Vietnam
 as hopeless and predicted an early take-
 over by the Communist guerrillas.
 Cut off from the mineral and indus-
 trial riches of the north; swamped by
 an influx of 1 million refugees; without
 an adequate army or administration of
 its own; with three major sects, each
 with private armies, openly challenging
 its authority-confronted with this com-
 bination of burdens and handicaps, it
 seemed that nothing could save the new
 born South Vietnamese Government.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                      3271
 I suggested to Senators that a train
 wreck hadoccurred in which 100 persons
 had lost their lives, or a shipwreck in
 which 150 had lost their lives, or some
 common disaster with hundreds or even
 thousands of lives lost, we would react,
 we would feel it.  But If I suggested that
 1 million murders had taken place, our
 minds would not be able to grasp the
 enormity of such a crime.
 Perhaps that is just as well.  There
 must be built into our intellectual mech-
 anism some kind of governor. Unfortu-
 nately, while it is probably saving us from
 insanity, the fact that our minds cannot
 comprehend the murder of 1 million peo-
 ple or 40 million people serves as a pro-
 tective asset to the perpetrator of such an
 evil deed.   It does not make the crime
 any less horrible.  It simply makes our
 task that much more difficult.
 Even after Khrushchev's denunciation
 of Stalin confirmed all the essential
 charges that had been made against the
 Soviet regime, men of good will in the
 Western World refused to believe that
 the Communist regime could be so evil.
 They refused to believe, because it is dif-
 ficult for them to conceive of horror and
 brutality on such a mass scale.
 To those who refuse to believe, I would
 like to read the eloquent words penned by
 Dr. Julius Margolin, a prominent Jewish
 leader in prewar Lithuania, one of the
 scores of thousands of Lithuanians de-
 ported to Soviet slave labor camps after
 the Soviet occupation of his country.
 When he was released after 7 years in
 the camps, Dr. Margolin wrote:
 Until the fall of 1939, I had assumed a
 position of benevolent neutrality toward the
 U.S.S.R. * * * The last.7 years have made
 me a convinced and ardent foe of the Soviet
 system.  I hate this system with all the
 strength of my heart and all the power of
 my mind.  Everything I have seen there has
 filled me with horror and disgust which will
 last until the end of my days.  I feel that
 the struggle against this system of slavery,
 terrorism, and cruelty which prevails there
 constitutes the primary obligation of every
 man in this world.  Tolerance or support of
 such an international shame is not permis-
 sible for people who are on this side of the
 Soviet border and who live under normal
 conditions. * * *
 Millions of men are perishing in the camps
 of the Soviet Union. * * *  Since they came
 into being, the Soviet camps have swallowed
 more people, have executed more victims,
 than  all  the  other  camps-Hitler's  in-
 cluded-together; and this lethal engine con-
 tinues to operate full blast.
 And those who in reply only shrug their
 shoulders and try to dismiss the issue with
 vague and meaningless generalities, I con-
 sider moral abetters and accomplices of ban-
 ditry.
 Let those who talk of getting out of
 Vietnam for the ostensible purpose of
 saving human lives weigh the words of
 Dr. Julius Margolin-a man who, like
 themselves, refused to believe that com-
 munism could be so inhuman until he saw
 its punitive machinery at work with his
 awn eyes.
 And if the administration should ever
 succumb to, their pressure and negotiate
 the surrender of Vietnam, and if the
 Vietnamese Communists then embark on
 the orgy of bloodletting which has always
 accolnpanled the establishment of Com-
 munist power, let those who are pressur-
 ing for negotiations not be heard to say,
 "but we didn't intend it this way." Be-
 cause there is today no excuse for igno-
 rance about communism,
 (B)  THE FURTHER  CHOICE:  COMPLETE  WITH-
 DRAWAL  OR                                                                    MAJOR  ESCALATION
 Our withdrawal from Vietnam would
 immediately confront us with an agoniz-
 ing choice.
 If we decide to try to defend what is
 left of southeast Asia against the advance
 of communism, it will require far more
 money, far more men, and far more.
 American blood than we are today in-
 vesting in the defense of Vietnam. What
 is more, it would involve a far greater risk
 of the major escalation which we seek
 to avoid.
 If, on the other hand, we decide to
 abandon the whole of southeast Asia to
 communism, as some of the proponents
 of withdrawal have frankly proposed, it
 would result in the early disintegration
 of all our alliances, and in the total
 eclipse of America as a great nation.
 Because no nation can remain great when
 its assurances are considered worthless
 .even by its friends.
 (C)  MORE VIETNAMS
 Whether we decide to abandon south-
 east Asia or to try to draw another line
 outside Vietnam, the loss of Vietnam will
 result in a dozen more Vietnams in dif-
 ferent parts of the world. If we cannot
 cope with this type of warfare in Viet-
 nam, the Chinese Communists will be en-
 couraged in the belief that we cannot
 cope with it anywhere else
 In the Congo, the Chinese Communists
 have launched their first attempt at ap-
 plying the Vietnamese strategy to Africa.
 In the Philippines, the Huk guerrillas,
 after being decisively defeated in the
 early 1950's, have now staged a dramatic
 comeback.  According to the New York
 Times, the Huks are now active again in
 considerable strength, control large areas
 of central Luzon, and are assassinating
 scores of village heads and local admin-
 istrators on the Vietcong pattern.
 In Thailand, Red China has already
 announced the formation of a patriotic
 front to overthrow the Government and
 eradicate American influence.  This al-
 most certainly presages the early launch-
 ing of a Thai Communist insurrection,
 also patterned after the Vietcong.
 An article in the Washington Post on
 January 16, pointed out that the Vene-
 zuelan Communists now have 5,000 men
 under arms in the cities and in the
 countryside, and that the Venezuelan
 Communist Party is openly committed to
 "the strategy of a long war, as developed
 in China, Cuba, Algeria, and Vietnam."
 And there are at least half a dozen
 other Latin American countries where
 the Communists are fielding guerrilla
 forces, which may be small today, but
 which would be encouraged by a Com-
 munistvictory in Vietnam to believe that
 the West has no defense against the
 long war.
 It is interesting to note in this con-
 nection that, according to Cuban re-
 ports,                                                      a Vietcong  delegation  which
 came to Havana in 1964 signed a "mu-
 tual aid pact" with the Venezuelan guer-
 rilla forces.  In ac]dtion, Marguerite
 Higgins, the distinguished correspondent
 for the Washington Star and other
 papers, points out that Vietcong experts
 have teamed up with experts from Com-
 munist China and the Soviet Union in
 training Latin Americans for guerrilla
 operations in the several schools main-
 tained by Fidel Castro.
 (D) WHAT NEW DEFENSE LINE?
 It has been suggested that if we aban-
 don southeast Asia, our seapower would
 make it possible for us to fall back on
 Japan and the Philippines and the oth-
 er Pacific islands, and constitute a more
 realistic defense line there. This is non-
 sense.  American seapower and.Ameri-
 can nuclear power have thus far proved
 impotent to cope with Communist politi-
 cal warfare.  Cuba is the best proof of
 this.
 If we abandon southeast Asia, the
 Philippines may prove impossible to
 hold against a greatly stepped-up Huk
 insurgency.
 Japan, even if it remains non-Commu-
 nist, would probably, by force of circum-
 stances, be compelled to come to terms
 with Red China, adding the enormous
 strength of its economy to Communist
 strategic resources.
 Okinawa, where our political position
 is already difficult, would become politi-
 cally impossible to hold.
 If we ~ fail to draw the line in Viet-
 nam, in short, we may find ourselves
 compelled to draw a defense line as far
 back as Seattle and Alaska, with Hawaii
 as a solitary outpost in mid-Pacific.
 (E)  THE  ECLIPSE OF AMERICAN  PRESTIGE
 To all those who agree that we must
 carefully weigh the consequences of
 withdrawal before we commit ourselves
 to withdrawal, I would refer the recent
 words of the well-known Filipino politi-
 cal  commentator,  Vincente Villamin.
 The abandonment of Vietnam, wrote Mr.
 Villamin, "would be an indelible blemish
 on America's honor.  It would reduce
 America in the estimation of mankind
 to a dismal third-rate power, despite her
 wealth, her culture and her nuclear ar-
 senal.  It would make every American
 ashamed of his Government and would
 make every individual American dis-
 trusted everywhere on earth."
 This is strong language.  But from
 conversations with a number of Asians, I
 know that it is an attitude shared by
 many of our best friends in Asia.
 VIETNAM AND MUNICH
 The situation in Vietnam today bears
 many resemblances to the situation just
 before Munich.
 Chamberlain wanted peace. Churchill
 wanted peace.
 Churchill said that if the free world
 failed to draw the line against Hitler at
 an early stage, it would be compelled to
 draw the line under much more difficult
 circumstances at a later date.
 Chamberlain held that a confronta-
 tion with Hitler might result in war, and
 that the interests of peace demanded
 some concessions to Hitler.  Czechoslo-
 vakia, he said, was a faraway land about
 which we knew very little.
 Chamberlain  held  that     a  durable
 agreement could be negotiated with Hit-

 ler that would guarantee "peace in our
 time."
 How I remember those words.
 Churchill held that the appeasement
 of a compulsive aggressor simply whet-
 ted his a{ petite for further expansion
 and made war more likely.
 Chamberlain's policy won out, because
 nobody wanted war. When he came back
 from Munich, he was hailed not only by
 the Tories, but by the Liberals, and the
 Labor Party people, including leftwing-
 ers like James Maxton and Fenner
 Brockway.
 Churchill remained a voice crying in
 the wilderness.
 But  who  was  right-Churchill  or
 Chamberlain?
 Who was the true man of peace?
 In Vietnam today, we are again deal-
 inl; with a faraway land, about which
 we know very little.
 In Vietnam today, we are again con-
 fronted by an incorrigible aggressor,
 fanatically committed to the destruc-
 tion of the free world, whose agree-
 ments are as worthless as Hitler's.  In-
 deed, even while the Communist propa-
 ganda apparatus is pulling out all the
 stops to pressure us into a diplomatic
 surrender in Vietnam, the Chinese Com-
 munists are openly encouraging a new
 Huk insurgency in the Philippines and
 have taken the first step in opening a
 Vietcong type insurgency in Thailand
 through the creation of their quisling
 Thai patriotic front.
 In signing the Munich agreement, it
 was not Chamberlain's intention to sur-
 render the whole of Czechoslovakia to
 Hitler.  The agreement was limited to
 the transfer of the German-speaking
 Sudetenland to  German  sovereignty.
 And no one was more indignant than
 Chamberlain when Hitler, having de-
 prived Czechoslovakia of her mountain
 defenses, proceeded to take over the
 entire country.
 While there are some proponents of
 a diplomatic solution who are willing
 to face up to the fact that negotiations
 at this juncture mean surrender, there
 are others who apparently quite hon-
 estly believe that we can arrive at a
 settlement that will both end the war
 and preserve the freedom of the South
 Vietnamese people.  If such negotia-
 tions should ever come to pass, I am
 certain that the story of Czechoslovakia
 would be repeated.  Having deprived
 South Vietnam of the political and mil-
 itary capability to resist, the North Viet-
 namese Communists would not tarry
 long before they completely communized
 the country.
 And, before very long, those who urge
 a diplomatic solution for the sake of
 preventing war, may find themselves
 compelled to fight the very war that
 they were seeking to avoid, on a bigger
 and bloodier scale, and from a much
 more difficult line of defense.
 I take Itfor granted that no one in
 this Chamber and no loyal American
 citizen believes that we should stand by
 indifferently while communism takes
 over the rest of the world.
 I take it for granted that every in-
 telligent person realizes that America
 could not long survive as a free nation
 I take it for granted that everyone
 agrees that somewhere, somehow, we
 must  drRw  the line against further
 Communist expansion.
 The question that separates us, there-
 fore, is not whether such a line should
 be drawn, but where such a line should
 be drawn.
 I believe that we have been right in
 drawing the line in Vietnam and that
 President Johnson is right in trying to
 hold the line in Vietnam, despite the
 setbacks we have suffered over the past
 year.  Because, if this line falls, let us
 have no illusions about the difficulty of
 drawing a realistic line of defense any-
 where in the western Pacific.
 NEITHER SURRENDER NOR ESCALATION
 We have been told in many statements
 and articles that the only alternative to
 withdrawal from Vietnam, with or with-
 out negotiations, is a dramatic escala-
 tion of the war against the North. And
 we have been warned that such an esca-
 lation might bring in both Red China
 and the Soviet Union and might bring
 about the thermonuclear holocaust that
 no one wants.
 These are supposed to be the choices
 before. us.
 It is my belief, however, that the tide
 of war in Vietnam can be reversed and
 that this war can ultimately be won
 without an invasion of the North and
 without a significant intensification of
 our military effort. It is my belief that
 there are many measures we can take,
 primarily in the nonmilitary, field, to
 strengthen our posture and the posture
 of South Vietnamese forces in the fight
 against the Vietcong insurgency.
 Before outlining some of the measures
 which I believe can and must be taken,
 I wish to deal with a number of widely
 accepted fallacies and misconceptions
 about the situation in Vietnam, because
 one cannot intelligently approach the
 problem -of what to do about Vietnam
 without first establishing the essential
 facts about the present situation in that
 country.
 THE FALLACY THAT THE VIETNAMESE WAR IS A
 CIVIL WAR
 The belief that the Vietnamese war is
 a civil war is one of the most widespread
 misconceptions about Vietnam.  This is
 frequently associated with the charge
 that it is the United States, and not
 North Vietnam or Red China, which is
 inteyvening in South Vietnam.
 The war in South Vietnam is not a
 civil war.  It was instigated in the first
 place by the North Vietnamese Commu-
 nists, with the material and moral sup-
 port of both Peiping and Moscow. There
 is overwhelming proof that Hanoi has
 provided the leadership for the Vietcong
 insurrection, that it has supplied them
 massively, and that it has served as the
 real command headquarters for the Viet-
 cong.              -
 The present insurrection in South
 Vietnam goes back to the third Commu-
 nist Party Congress in Hanoi in Septem-
 ber of 1960.  At this Congress it was
 decided "to liberate South Vietnam from
 the ruling yoke of the U.S. imperialists
 and their henchmen in order to achieve
 national unity and complete independ-
 ence." The Congress also called for the
 creation of a broad national front in
 South Vietnam directed against the
 United  States-Diem  clique.   Several
 months later the formation of the front
 for the liberation of the south was an-
 nounced.
 I understand that there Is an official
 report, according to which, the U.S. mili-
 tary assistants command in Vietnam is
 in possession of reliable evidence indi-
 cating that probably as many as 34,000
 Vietcong infiltratorshave entered South
 Vietnam from the north between Jan-
 uary 1959 and August 1964.
 The report indicates that the majority
 of hard-core Vietcong officers and the
 bulk of specialized personnel such as
 communications and heavy weapons spe-
 cialists have been provided through in-
 filtration. Infiltrators, moreover, appar-
 ently make up the major part of Vietcong
 regulars in the northern half of South
 Vietnam.
 The infiltration from the north sup-
 plies the Vietcong with much of its
 leadership, specialist personnel, key sup-
 plies such as heavy ordnance and com-
 munications equipment, and, in some
 cases, elite troops.
 This information is derived from the
 interrogation of many thousands of Viet-
 cong captives and defectors and from
 captured documents.
 It is this hard core that has come
 down from the north that has provided
 the leadership cadres In all major in-
 surgent actions, including the series of
 sensational attacks on American Instal-
 lations.
 The scale on which Hanoi has been
 supplying the Vietcong insurgency was
 dramatically illustrated this weekend
 when an attack by an American helicop-
 ter on a ship off the coast of South Viet-
 nam resulted in the discovery of an enor-
 mous arms cache-almost enough, in the
 words of one American officer, to equip
 an entire division. The haul included a
 thousand Russian-made carbines, hun-
 dreds of Russian submachine guns, and
 light machine guns, and Chinese burp
 guns, and scores of tons of ammunition.
 There were also a variety of sophisticated
 land mines and ammunition for a new
 type of rocket launcher used against
 tanks. A Communist guerrilla who was
 captured In the action said that the ship
 which delivered the weapons had made
 six trips to bases along the South Viet-
 namcoast, dropping off supplies.
 Finally, we would do well to consider
 the fact that the general  offensive
 launched by the Communist forces in
 Vietnam 2 weeks ago was preceded by an
 open call by Hanoi radio for assaults
 throughout the country on Vietnamese
 and American positions.
 The public confusion on the nature of
 the Vietnamese war stems in large meas-
 ure from the sabotage of the Communist
 member of the three-man International
 Control Commission set up to supervise
 the carrying out of the Geneva agree-
 ment. By 1961, reports of 1,200 offensive
 incidents of Communist agents, ranging
 from one-man assassinations to large-
 scale military actions, had been pre-
 sented to the Commission. The Commis-
 sion, however, took no action because the

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE
 I traveled through southeast Asia just
 before the conclusion of the Laotian
 armistice.
 I talked to many people at that time.
 It is true that the armistice was favored
 by our Ambassador in Laos, and it ob-
 viously must have had the support of
 important members of the State Depart-
 ment hierarchy.  But the personnel of
 our Embassies in Saigon and in Bangkok
 did not conceal from me their grave ap-
 prehensions over the consequences of
 such an armistice for Vietnam and
 southeast Asia.
 All of this I reported on confidentially
 upon my return.
 At that time, the Saigon government
 still controlled the situation throughout
 most of the countryside, although the
 15,000 Vietcong guerrillas were giving it
 increasing difficulty.  Our Embassy per-
 sonnel in Saigon expressed the fear that
 the conclusion of the Laotian armistice
 would enable the Communists to infil-
 trate men and material on a much larger
 scale and would result at an early date
 in a marked intensification of the Viet-
 cong insurgency.  Needless to say, the
 apprehensions which they expressed to
 me have been completely borne out by
 subsequent developments.
 The Laotian armistice has served Laos
 itself as poorly-?6s it has served the cause
 of freedom in Vietnam.  The Commu-
 nists have continued to nibble away at
 what is left of free Laos, in one aggres-
 sive act after another, so that by now
 they firmly control more than half the
 country, while their infiltress and guer-
 rillas are gnawing relentlessly at govern-
 ment authority in the rest of  the
 country.
 In mid-1964, I asked the Library of
 Congress to prepare for me a study of
 Communist violations of the Laotian
 armistice agreement.  The study which
 they submitted to me listed 14 specific
 violations up until that time.
 That was last year. There have been
 many more since then.
 Mr. President, I plan to insert into the
 RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks
 a copy of the survey of Communist vio-
 lations of the Laotian armistice prepared
 for me by the Library of Congress.  I
 earnestly hope the Senator from Idaho
 will take the time to study this before
 he once again holds up the Loatian armi-
 stice as a model for Vietnam.
 I should also like to quote from a
 statement made on March 30, 1963, by
 Gen. Kong Le, the neutralist military
 commander who, as is common knowl-
 edge, had favored the conclusion of the
 Laotian armistice. Kong Le's statement
 is significant because it illustrates how
 Communists will deal tomorrow with
 non-Communist elements that they are
 prepared to accept into coalition gov-
 ernments today.
 Referring  to  certain  Communist
 stooges, Gen. Itong Le said:
 bespite their continual defeats, however,
 these people learned their lessons from their
 Communist bosses. * * * When the Prime
 Minister went abroad, they moved rapidly to
 destroy the neutralist forces.  They used
 tricks to provoke the soldiers and people to
 overthrow Colonel Ketsana.  When these did
 not succeed, on February 12 they used an as-
 sassin to murder Ketsana. They also savage-
 ly killed or arrested all neutralist party
 members, and their bloody hands caused the
 death of many people.
 This  was  the statement  of  Gen.
 Kong Le, one of those who had pressed
 the hardest for the Laotian armistice
 when he saw what the armistice did to
 his country.
 Finally, I do not believe that the Lao-
 tian armistice has served the Interests
 of the other peoples of southeast Asia.
 I have in my possession a map of north-
 ern Laos showing areas where the Chi-
 nese Communists have been building
 roads that would give China direct ac-
 cess to the borders of Burma and Thai-
 land.  The construction of these roads
 bodes ill for the future peace of south-
 east Asia.  That they are intended for
 future military use is taken for granted
 by everyone in the area.
 So much for the example of the Lao-
 tian armistice.
 All this does not mean to say that we
 must not under any circumstances enter
 into negotiations with the Communists.
 I do not suggest that at all.  It simply
 means that when we do so, we must do
 so with our eyes open and with a clear
 understanding of the ingredients re-
 quired to enforce compliance with the
 agreement about to be  entered into.
 That is all I have ever urged.
 Moreover, there is a time to negotiate
 and a time not to negotiate.
 The demand that we negotiate now
 over Vietnam is akin to asking Churchill
 to negotiate with the Germans at the
 time of Dunkirk, or asking Truman to
 negotiate with the Communists when
 we stood with our backs to the sea in the
 Pusan perimeter in Korea.  In either
 case, the free world could have negoti-
 ated nothing but total capitulation.
 The situation in Vietnam is probably
 not as desperate and certainly no more
 desperate, than Britain's plight at the
 time of Dunkirk or our own plight at
 the time of Pusan.  If we are of good
 heart, if we refuse to listen to the coun-
 sels of despair, if we again resolve that
 "we will never give in"-as Churchill
 put it-there Is every reason to be con-
 fident that a time will arrive when we
 can negotiate with honor and for a more
 acceptable objective than a diplomatic
 surrender.
 There are those who say that the
 whole of southeast Asia will, whether
 we like it or not, go Communist. These
 people are at least consistent in urging
 negotiations now. But anyone who be-
 lieves that we can negotiate now and
 not lose Vietnam to communism is de-
 luding himself in the worst possible way.
 THE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFEAT IN VIETNAM
 it is human to oppose the cost of stay-
 ing on in Vietnam when American boys
 are dying in a faraway land about
 which we understand very little.  I am
 conscious of this.  I am sensitive to it.
 I share the troubled minds of all Sena-
 tors. But I am convinced that the great
 majority of those who advocate that we
 abandon Vietnam` to communism, either
 by pulling out or by "negotiating" a set-
 tlement, have not taken the time to
 weigh the consequences of defeat.
 In my opinion, the consequences of an
 American defeat in Vietnam would be
 February 23
 so catastrophic that we simply cannot
 permit ourselves to think of it.  This is
 truly an "unthinkable thought," to use
 an expression coined by the Senator
 from Arkansas. He was not applying it
 to this problem, I point out, but I find
 the words particularly apt in reference
 to Vietnam.
 GENOCIDE
 For the Vietnamese people, the first
 consequence would be a bloodletting on
 a genocidal scale.
 In the Soviet Union and in Red China,
 tens of millions of "class enemies" were
 eliminated by the victorious Communists.
 While it is true that there are some
 slightly more moderate Communist re-
 gimes in certain countries, Vietnamese
 communism Is characterized by utter
 disregard for human life of Stalinism
 and Maoism.  What will happen to the
 more than 1-million refugees from North
 Vietnam?  What will happen to the mil-
 lions of peasants who resisted or bore
 arms against the Vietcong.  I shudder
 to think of it. The massacre of inno-
 cents in Vietnam will be repeated in every
 southeast Asian country that falls to
 communism in its wake, in a gigantic
 bloodletting that will dwarf the agony
 and suffering of the war in Vietnam.
 Those who urge our withdrawal from
 Vietnam in the name of saving human
 lives have the duty to consider the rec-
 ord of Communist terror in every country
 that has fallen under the sway of this
 merciless ideology, with its total disre-
 gard for human life.
 The total number of victims of commu-
 nism will probably never be known.  Stu-
 dents who - have followed the Chinese
 Communist press closely claim that it can
 be demonstrated that Chinese commu-
 nism has cost the lives of at least 25
 million and more, probably 50 million
 people, while students of Soviet commu-
 nism put the overall figure for the So-
 viet Union at approximately the same
 level.  They point out that, entirely
 apart from the purges and mass killings,
 at periodic intervals and the forced star-
 vation of 5 million Ukrainian farmers,
 the reported death rate In the Soviet
 forced labor camps ran approximately
 25 percent per annum In bad years, and
 15 to 20 percent in good years.  If one
 accepts the average population of the
 slave labor camps as 10 million over the
 20 odd years of Stalin's undisputed rule,
 this would mean that approximately 2
 million slave laborers died annually in
 Stalin's camps, or 40 million for the 20-
 year period.
 According to the Polish Government
 in exile, in London, the Soviets deported
 11/2 million Poles to Siberia after they
 had occupied eastern Poland in the wake
 of  the  Hitler-Stalin  pact.  Approxi-
 mately 150,000 were returned through
 Teheran after the Nazi invasion of Rus-
 sia.  Another 300,000 drifted back after
 the war. More than i million never
 came back.  Such was the mortality in
 the Soviet slave labor camps.
 All of this seems incredible to the
 Western mind.
 I remember, when I was in Nurembur,
 that when I first read the terrible sta-
 tistics about the mass killings by the
 Nazis, I could not comprehend them.  If

 ISOLATIONISM
 THE NEW ISOLATIONISM
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there has
 been developing in this country in recent
 years a brand of thinking about foreign
 affairs which, I believe, can aptly be de-
 scribed as "the new. isolationism," This
 internal phenomenon is, in my opinion,
 potentially more-?disastrous in terms of
 its consequence than the major external
 problems that confront us.
 .Its.background is a,growing national
 weariness with cold war burdens we have
 been so long carrying, a rising frustra-
 tion with situations that are going
 against us in many places, a long-sim-
 mering indignation over thg fact that our
 generosity and sacrifice have too often
 been met abroad, not just with indiffer-
 ence and ingratitude, but even with hos-
 tility and contempt.
 Its political base seems to be to the left
 of center, although it forms as yet a dis-
 tinct minority there.
 Its scareword is "escalation"; its cure-
 all is "neutralization."
 Its prophets include some of my col-
 leagues  in  the  Congress,  influential
 spokesmen in the press, and leading fig-
 ures in the academic world.  Some are
 new volunteers in this cause of retrench-
 ment; they regard themselves as prag-
 matists.  Others are old hands at Polly-
 anna-ism, those unshakable romantics
 who were disillusioned by Moscow at the
 time of the Hitler-Stalin pact, disillu-
 sioned by Mao when they discovered that
 he was not really an agrarian reformer,
 disillusioned by Castro when they learned
 that he was not a cross between Thomas
 Jefferson and Robin Hood-and who,
 having again dusted themselves off, now
 look for new vistas of adventure.
 If I may digress, let me say that I have
 always admired their durability.  The
 manner in which they have survived, un-
 chastened, a whole series of intellectual
 Dunkirks is, if nothing else, a tribute to
 man's invincible confidence in himself;
 and their adeptness in avoiding discredi-
 tation, in the face of repeated catas-
 trophes and evacuations, must be ac-
 knowledged as one of the marvels of
 modern history-a triumph of self -recti-
 tude over reason.
 The basic premise of the new isola-
 tionism is that. the United States is over-
 extended in itsattei ptto resist Com-
 munist aggression around the world,
 overcommitted to the defense.of distant
 outposts, and overinvolved in the murky
 and unintelligible affairs of remote areas.
 The corollaries of the new isolationism
 are many.  It is contended that we
 should deemphasize the cold war, and
 reverse our national priorities in favor of
 domestic improvements; that we should
 withdraw from South Vietnam; that we
 should cease involvement in the, Congo;
 that we should, relax the so-called .ri-
 gidity of our Berlin policy; that for-
 eign aid has outlived its usefulness
 and  should  be  severely  cut  back;
 that our Military Establishment and our
 CIA, organizations that seem particu-
 larly suspect because they are symbols of
 worldwide involvement, should be hum-
 bled and "cut down to size" and stripped
 of their influence in foreign policy
 questions.
 In my judgment all of these proposi-
 t.lons have one thing in common.  Each
 of them would strike at the heart of our
 national effort to preserve our freedom
 and our security; and collectively they
 add up to a policy which I can describe
 by no other name than "appeasement,"
 subtle appeasement, unintentional ap-
 peasement, to be sure, but appeasement
 nonetheless.
 My purpose, this afternoon then, is to
 oppose these propositions and to enlist
 Senators' opposition against them-for
 the new isolationism is as bankrupt as
 the old.
 First of.all-totc -the main-preen-
 ise-I reject the assumption that the
 United States is overextended, or over-
 committed, or overinvolved.
 We are enjoying a spectacular growth
 in every index of national strength.
 Our population, our wealth, our indus-
 trial capacity, our scientific potential,
 our agricultural output, all are enjoying
 great upward surges.  We were informed
 that our gross national product was
 again up in January, and the trend seems
 ever upward.
 Far from overextending ourselves in
 the cold war, we are actually in a period
 of declining defense budgets, of steadily
 lowered draft calls, of sharply reduced
 foreign aid, of one tax cut after another.
 Let me emphasize this: In every basic
 resource, we have greater capacity today
 than during the past 5 years; by every
 military or economic standard, we are
 stronger; and by every physical measure-
 ment, the percentage of our resources
 going into the cold war is lower.  Why
 then should we talk of weariness or over-
 commitment?
 We are not even straining ourselves.
 We are actually pursuing today a policy
 not only of both guns and butter, but of
 less guns and more butter.
 So far as our resources go, we are
 Capable of indefinite continuation and
 even intensification of our present ef-
 forts, if need be.  It is only our mental,
 and perhaps our moral, resources which
 seem to be feeling the strain.
 We would, of course, prefer to live in a
 world in which it were possible for us to
 have no commitments, a world in which
 we could devote all of our energies to
 the task of perfecting our society at
 home and enriching the lives of our peo-
 ple.
 But we must face the world as it is.
 And the basic fact of our world is that
 Western civilization, itself terribly rent
 and divided, both politically and philo-
 sophically, has been forced into a twi-
 light war of survival by a relentless and
 remorseless enemy.
 It is incontestable, in terms of peoples
 enslaved and nations gobbled up over
 the past 20 years, that we have not been
 holding our own.  And each year, the
 world Communist movement is com-
 mitting more and more of its resources
 to the task of subjugating our allies, all
 around the perimeter of freedom.
 Against this background it is prepos-
 terous to maintain that we should reduce
 our effort and lessen our commitment to
 the great struggle of our century.
 Yet, according to Time magazine, it
 is the widespread sentiment of the aca-
 demic world that we have overreached
 ourselves and ought to pull back.  Walter
 Lippmann, the well-known columnist,
 for whom I have great respect, says that
 "the American tide will have to recede."
 It has been argued that we would be in
 a "precarious situation" if we were at-
 tacked on several fronts.  Of course we
 would, but does anyone believe that we
 can -solve the problem by abandoning
 our. commitments and defensive alli-
 ances?  Would the loss of these coun-
 tries be any the less disastrous because
 they were given up undefended?
 .On the contrary, if we are not strong
 enough to honor our commitments to-
 day, then we should solve the problem,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE               February 2.3
 not be reducing our commitments, but
 by becoming stronger, and by aiding our
 allies to become stronger.
 The defense of the free world rests on
 a very delicate balance.  The key ele-
 ments in that balance are American
 power and American determination.  If
 we lack the power to maintain that bal-
 ance then certainly all is lost.  If we
 reveal that we lack the determination, if
 we, for Instance, allow ourselves to be
 pushed out of Vietnam, such a humilia-
 tion may indeed be the second shot heard
 around the world; and a dozen nations
 might soon throw in the sponge and
 make  whatever  accommodation  they
 could with an enemy that would then
 seem assured of victory.
 Fortunately, at the present time we do
 not lack the power to carry on the de-
 fense of freedom.  Our power is at its
 peak and we have the capacity to in-
 crease it vastly if necessary.  It is our
 spirit, apparently, that needs shoring up.
 Four years ago, after a visit to south-
 east Asia, I said on the floor of the
 Senate:
 If the United States, with its unrivaled
 might, with its unparalleled wealth, with its
 dominion over sea and air, with its heritage
 as the champion of freedom-if this United
 States and its free-world allies have so di-
 minished In spirit that they can be laid in
 the dust by a few thousand primitive guer-
 rillas, then we are far down the road from
 which there is no return.
 In right and in might, we are able to work
 our will on this question.  Southeast Asia
 cannot be lost unless we will it to be lost;
 it cannot be saved unless we will it to be
 saved.
 This problem,  seemingly so remote and
 distant, will in fact be resolved here in the
 United States, in the Congress, in the ad-
 ministration, and in the minds and hearts
 of the American people.
 The passage of 4 years has not dimin-
 ished my belief in this course.
 If the main premise of the new isola-
 tionism is erroneous, then surely the
 lesser premises are fraught with terrible
 danger.
 It is argued that we should de-
 emphasize the cold war and turn more
 of our resources to domestic welfare.
 The  annual  congressional  revolt
 against the foreign aid bill grows more
 violent and successful .each year, and the
 ' administration, forced to yield, now
 sends foreign aid requests 40 percent
 below what it solemnly declared 2 years
 ago to be the minimum figure tolerable
 for free world survival.
 And a small but growing band of
 Senators have begun offering each year
 amendments making across-the-board
 percentage cuts in our defense budget,
 cuts not directed to any specific econ-
 omy, but rather to a principle-the prin-
 ciple that we should be spending less on
 defense and more on welfare.
 Here, in my judgment, are sure-
 fire formulas for defeat.
 Where are the victories in the cold
 war that would justify such a reversal
 of priorities?  in what global trouble
 spots are there lessened tensions or im-
 proved postures that would make this
 plausible?  I can see a lot of cold war
 areas where things are looking worse-
 but very few where things are getting
 better.
 . More effort, more sacrifice-not less-
 is the need of our time. And I speak as
 one who doesnot disparage the need or
 the importance of domestic improve-
 ments. As a credential of this I recom-
 mend to Senators my scorecard, com-
 piled last year by the ultraconservative
 Americans for Constitutional Action,
 which asserts that I voted right only 13
 percent of the time-one of the worst
 records, alas, In the Congress.
 But I say to you that if our foreign
 affairs are going badly, no aspect of
 Internal welfare is secure or stable. And
 if we cope successfully with the great
 problem, the cold war, no internal prob-
 lem can long defy solution.
 Our first national priority is and must
 ever be the survival of our country and
 our freedom-and if the 20th century
 has taught men anything, it is that sur-
 vival and freedom cannot be purchased
 on the cheap, in a discount store or a
 bargain basement.
 But our situation is such that we can
 meet our needs both at home and
 abroad-not as handsomely as we would
 prefer, but well enough.  This I take to
 be the objective of the Johnson adminis-
 tration.  The war on poverty and the
 struggle against tyranny can go hand in
 hand, if our vision be broad.
 Twenty-five years ago, our country,
 comparatively new and untried among
 the great nations of the earth, through
 passage of the Lend-Lease Act, described
 by Winston Churchill as "the most un-
 sordid act of recorded history," em-
 barked irrevocably upon the path that
 has brought us to our present posture in
 history.  Through that act, we affirmed
 the preservation and expansion of liber-
 ty as our highest goal; we acknowledged
 that freedom was insecure everywhere so
 long as tyranny existed anywhere; and
 we assumed the burden, and the glory,
 of being the champion and defender of
 man's highest aspirations.
 Since that embattled hour, when the
 light of freedom was but a flicker in the
 dark, our journey across the pages of his-
 tory has been fantastic and unprece-
 dented : tragic, to be sure, in its mistakes
 and naivities, but heroic in its innova-
 tions and commitments, prodigious In its
 energy and power, gigantic in its gen-
 erosity and good will,, noble in its re-
 straint and patience, and sublime in its
 purpose and in its historic role.
 We have not realized the high goals
 we set for ourselves in World War II.
 But we have preserved freedom and
 national independence in more than half
 the earth; we have prevented the nu-
 clear holocaust; we have restored West-
 ern Europe; we have helped friend and
 foe to achieve prosperity, freedom and
 stability; we have launched a world peace
 organization and have kept it alive; we
 have offered the hand of friendship and
 help to the impoverished and backward
 peoples of the world if they will but
 take it.
 It may be said of our country today,
 as of no other in history, that wherever
 people are willing to stand up in defense
 of their liberty.  Americans stand with
 them.
 We cannot know at this hour whether
 our journey has just begun or is nearing
 its climax; whether the task ahead is the
 work of a generation, or of a century.
 President Kennedy said, in his Inaugural
 Address, that the conflict would not be
 resolved in our lifetime.
 The Chief of Staff of the Army recently
 told the Congress that it might well take
 10 years to decide the issue in Vietnam -
 alone.  And Vietnam is only one symp-
 tom of the disease, the epidemic, we are
 resisting.
 Against this somber background, how
 foolish it is to talk of deemphasizing the
 cold war, of pulling out of Vietnam, of
 abandoning the Congo to Communist
 Intrigue, of slashing the defense budget
 by 10 percent, or of any of the other ir-
 responsibilities of the new isolationism.
 VIETNAM
 It is against this background that I
 take up today the question of Vietnam,
 which has been the favorite target of
 those who urge withdrawal and re-
 trenchment.
 Over the past several months, a num-
 ber of my most respected colleagues have
 taken the floor to urge that we get out of
 Vietnam or that we enter into negotia-
 tions over Vietnam.
 The propriety of our presence in Viet-
 nam and the validity of our position has
 been challenged. It has even been sug-
 gested that we are the real aggressors in
 Vietnam. The war has been called "Mc-
 Namara's War."  It has been suggested
 that we more or less ignore Asia and
 Africa and concentrate on Europe and
 the Americas.
 I have listened with growing dismay
 to these presentations-and with all the
 more dismay because of the respect and
 affection I have for the Senators who
 made them.
 If I have not risen to reply to my
 colleagues before now, it was not be-
 cause Vietnam was a new subject to me,
 but because I felt that their arguments
 required the most carefully considered
 and most painstakingly prepared reply.
 I had visited most of the countries
 of southeast Asia In early 1961, and I
 have spoken a number of times on the
 floor of the Senate on the subject of
 Vietnam and Laos and Indonesia since
 my return.  I have endeavored to keep
 up with the situation in that part of the
 world as best one can do by reading
 the press and official publications. But
 I realized that there were important gaps
 in my information because the press cov-
 erage of Vietnam was, with a few out-
 standing exceptions, weak and in some
 cases completely misleading.  I have,
 therefore, sought to fill these gaps by
 correspondence with friends in Vietnam,
 both Vietnamese and American, and by
 conversations with Americans who have
 served in Vietnam in various capacities-
 some of them for long periods of time.
 The senior Senator from Wyoming
 [Mr. MCGEE]  and the senior Senator
 from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY] on the
 one side, and the distinguished minority
 leader, the junior Senator from Illinois
 [Mr. Dn uSEN] and the senior Senator
 from Massachusetts [Mr. SALTONSTALL]
 have already spoken eloquently on the
 need for standing fast in Vietnam.

 economy has grown.  Federal funds appro-
 priated to the Soil Consevation Service have
 been inadequate to furnish sufficient techni-
 cal assistance to meet the growing obliga-
 tions in districts.
 The National Association of Soil and Water
 Conservation Districts therefore requests the
 Congress to appropriate additional funds to
 the Soil Conservation Service to provide
 needed technical assistance, watershed plan-
 ning, watershed protection, and service to the
 Great Plains conservation program during
 fiscal year 1966.
 More specifically, we ask the Congress of
 the United States to appropriate $115,040,000
 for the conservation operations in fiscal year
 1966.
 We urge the Congress to kill the proposed
 revolving fund through which soil conserva-
 tion  districts  and  farmers  and  ranchers
 would make $20 million of payments to the
 Soil Conservation Service for technical
 assistance.
 We ask that $750,000 of new funds be ap-
 propriated to provide technical assistance
 staff to 25 new soil and water conservation
 districts expected to be organized during fis-
 cal year 1966.
 We further ask that an additional $10,-
 187,000 of conservation operations funds be
 appropriated to meet the current backlog in
 staffing needs of 1,518 man-years of technical
 assistance in soil conservation districts.
 Watershed planning:
 We ask the Congress of the United States
 to  appropriate  $10  million  for  watershed
 planning in fiscal year 1966.
 This $41/4 million increase over the budget
 estimate is needed to permit a step-up in
 the  rate  of  watershed  planning    because
 nearly 1,200 communities are on the wait-
 ing list for planning assistance.
 Watershed protection:
 We ask the Congress of the United States
 to appropriate $85 million for watershed pro-
 tection in fiscal year 1966.
 This would permit beginning construction
 on approximately 100 new watershed project
 starts instead of only 70 new starts as pro-
 posed in the budget estimates.
 Flood prevention:
 We ask the Congress to appropriate at the
 budget estimate level of $25,417,000 for flood
 prevention in fiscal year 1966.
 This has been a current and adequate level
 of  flood prevention operations for several
 years.
 Great Plains conservation program:
 We ask the Congress of the United States
 to  appropriate $20  million for the  Great
 Plains conservation program in fiscal year
 1966.
 The increase over the budget estimate is
 needed to help meet the backlog of nearly
 5,000 farmers who have made application
 for help but are still waiting for assistance.
 Resource conservation and development:
 We ask the Congress of the United States
 to appropriate at the budget estimate level
 of $4,303,000 for resource conservation and
 development in fiscal year 1966.
 This would permit the  continuation of
 operations in the 10 pilot R.C. & D. projects
 now underway and would permit the author-
 ization of planning on 10 more pilot R.C. &
 D. projects in 1966.
 We urge soil and water conservation dis-
 trict supervisors and watershed directors to
 inform their Senators and Representatives
 of these needs and request support for such
 appropriations.
 RESOLUTION  3
 AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION  PROGRAM  FONDS
 All citizens of the Nation benefit from ac-
 tions taken to conserve and develop natural
 resources, including the basic resources of
 soil and water.
 We recognize that the economy of agri-
 culture is such that farmers cannot finance,
 wholly, all the costs of planning and apply-
 Ing the  conservation practices that are
 needed.
 The agricultural conservation program of
 the USDA encourages, assists, and gives in-
 dividual farmers an incentive, through shar-
 ing the cost of applying conservation meas-
 ures, to proceed withthe work of conserving
 natural resources.
 The NACD, therefore,  opposes the pro-
 posed $100 million budget reduction in the
 advance atuhorization for the agricultural
 conservation program in 1966.  We ask the
 Congress to maintain the authorization at
 the 1965 level in order to maintain progress
 toward the conservation of natural resources.

 CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS IN WATERSHED
 PROJECTS
 Under provisions of the Great Plains con-
 servation  program,  landowners may enter
 into long-term contracts with USDA where-
 by  they  adopt                                                                                               a conservation  plan  for
 their entire unit and agree to make land-
 use  changes, apply conservation practices,
 and establish  desirable cropping                     and   use
 systems, all according to an agreed upon
 time schedule.                        The  USDA,  for its part,
 agrees to provide technical assistance and
 cost-sharing to  further  adoption                    of   this
 farmwide    conservation                    plan  according  to
 the time schedule.
 We urge an amendment to the Watershed
 Protection and Flood Prevention Act author-
 izing the use of similar contract arrange-
 ments  within  approved  watersheds.                                                                                                    We
 reconnend a time schedule of from 3 to
 10 ye rs for completion of essential con-
 servati n measures on whole farms covered
 by s ch watershed contracts.
 PETITIONS BY CORNELL UNIVER-
 SITY STUDENTS ON U.S. POLICY
 ON VIETNAM
 Mr.  MORSE.  Mr.  President,  last
 night I lectured at Cornell University.
 At the conclusion of the lecture, a group
 of students handed me some petitions
 in opposition to U.S. policy in South
 Vietnam.
 I ask unanimous consent to have them
 printed in the RECORD at this point with
 the i_ames.
 There being no objection, the petition
 and names were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 To the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
 We, the undersigned- members of the Cor-
 nell University community, strongly protest
 the bombing and strafing attacks on North
 Vietnam by the U.S. Government on February
 7 and 8, 1965.  In spite of official statements
 to the contrary, we believe that such actions
 can lead only to the escalation of a war
 that the United States should not be fight-
 ing In the first place; especially since we are
 supporting regimes disliked by and detri-
 mental to the Vietnamese people.
 We hereby join with the growing num-
 ber of citizens who have voiced their opposi-
 tion to the United States presence in Viet-
 nam.
 We demand that the U.S. Government
 withdraw from Vietnam now.

 PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY'S
 STATEMENTS FOR GI BILLS
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.                                           Mr. President,
 this year the cold war GI bill, S. 9, is re-
 ceiving the greatest support that it has
 ever had from the Members of this body.
 In addition to having 40 cosponsors, the
 high caliber and earnestness of testimony
 by several Senators before the Subcom-
 mittee on Veterans' Affairs demonstrates
 that opposing forces will have a harder
 time blocking the consideration of this
 bill than they have ever had before.
 I would like to remind my colleagues
 that the late President John F. Kennedy
 was an earnest supporter of readjust-
 ment assistance for our veterans.  In
 Senate Document No. 79 of the 88th Con-
 gress, a compendium of speeches and
 statements made by John F. Kennedy
 during his service in Congress, there are
 two statements concerning readjustment
 assistance.  The first of these is in sup-
 port of the Korean GI bill, and the sec-
 ond recommends raising the allowances
 paid under the then existing GI bill.  I
 ask unanimous consent that these two
 statements be inserted at this point in
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ments were ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 THE KOREAN GI BILL, H.R. 7658, JUNE 5, 1952
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to take
 this opportunity to be recorded as supporting
 fully and vigorously the Korean GI bill, H.R.
 7656, now under consideration.
 Close to a million Americans have par-
 ticipated in the Korean struggle.  They are
 justly deserving of the same consideration
 that the veterans  of World War II were
 accorded.

 The State chamber believes in a realistic,

 There should be continuing study of the
 many still-unsolved problems involved so
 that any further legislation in this field may
 be based upon careful appraisal of experience
 with the actual operation of the program.
 Prominent among these unsolved problems
 are that (1) no consistent relationship ex-
 ists between amounts of tax contributions
 of individuals and the amounts of benefits
 they ultimately may receive;. (2) the pro-
 gram is one of sharply rising costs for the
 next several decades and a major portion of
 costs of pension rights being earned now is
 being postponed for future generations to
 bear, and (3) the cost-deferment character-
 istic hides from public consciousness the fu-
 ture cost impact of obligations being incur-
 red currently.
 There is need for basic decisions correcting
 OASI financing weaknesses.  In any event,
 future law changes increasing OASI costs
 should be accompanied by commensurate tax
 increases in order to create a clear public
 understanding of the cost impact.

 VIETNAM
 Mr. IYOMINICK. Mr. President, I
 have recently had the pleasure of reading
 the February 22 issue of the Washington
 Report issued by the American Security
 Council, containing an article entitled
 "Why We Can't Negotiate Now."
 This article deals very clearly with the
 situation facing us in South Vietnam, and
 refutes one argument after another sug-
 gesting  negotiation  in  Vietnam.  It
 points out very logically and clearly the
 reason why we must stand firm in that
 area.  The axtIcle is of real value be-
 cause it answers some points which have
 been made.  One of the cries we hear
 constantly, in Congress and outside, is
 that we cannot win militarily.
 One of the points made in the article
 is that every guerrilla war engaged in
 between World War II and now has been
 either lost or won, not just stalemated.
 Dependent on the issue of whether it has
 been won or lost has been the whole
 course of freedom in those areas.
 The writers of tl_e article come to the
 conclusion that this war can be won,
 that the President's policy should be
 firmly supported, and they go further
 with respect to possible support from Red
 China and the Vietcong.
 I do not want to indicate that I am
 necessarily in favor of or in opposition
 to the last paragraph of the report, but
 the entire article points out so many
 factors with which we have been dealing
 that I ask unanimous consent that the
 entire report-which is only four pages--
 be included at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed In the RECORD,
 as follows :
 WHY WE CAN'T NEGOTIATE NOW
 A great swirl of climactic events has fol-
 lowed President Johnson's order to give con-
 Crete effect to his repeated warnings to the
 Communists to cease their aggression against
 South Vietnam.  The difficult but extremely
 necessary decisions haveat last been taken.
 Inevitably in such cases, an atmosphere. of
 crisis is created by the outraged cries and
 threats of international communism.  Just
 as inevitably, the calls for a negotiated set-
 tlement are redoubled on the free world side
 of the line.  Many well meaning people find
 it  difficult to  understand  why President
 Johnson does not at least accompany his
 military action by an offer to enter into im-
 mediate negotiations to end the Vietnam
 war.
 Undoubtedly, the President would like
 nothing better-nor would any other person
 of good will-if negotiation presently offered
 a reasonable prospect of fulfilling our pledge
 to defend the people of Vietnam; it is this
 pledge which we must honor if there is ever
 to be any hope of lasting peace in the world.
 But in considering negotiation the Admin-
 istration is faced with a series of very un-
 pleasant facts, which are either unknown or
 forgotten by the general public.
 One set of facts concerns the inherent
 nature of guerrilla wars.  The military tac-
 tics and political purposes of such wars are
 not  subject to stalemate   or compromise.
 For example, much of the current argu-
 ment for negotiation rests on the hypothesis
 that a military victory for either side is im-
 possible.   This  is begging the question.
 Since World War II, when the guerrilla war
 came into vogue, they have invariably been
 won or lost. Either the guerrilas win in the
 sense of achieving a take-over of the country
 or government in question, or else they are
 militarily defeated,  at least to the point
 where they are reduced to a harmless rem-
 nant. There have been no exceptions to this
 rule.
 The   guerrillas   triumphed   completely
 against the Dutch in Indonesia, against the
 French in Algeria and Indochina (except here
 they settled for North Vietnam in 1954 rather
 than risk U.S. Intervention), against the
 British in Palestine and Cyprus, and against
 Batista in Cuba. They were decisively de-
 feated In Greece, the Philippines, Malaya,
 Burma, and-apparently-Venezuela. When-
 ever negotiations were held it was only for"
 the purpose of ratifying the guerrilla vic-
 tory.                                                                          In the majority of cases this was not
 of a decisive military nature.  The French
 were never beaten in Algeria and even after
 Dien Bien Phu they could have held on at
 least in Hanoi and Saigon.  The Dutch could
 have held Indonesia for some time as could
 the British in Palestine and Cyprus.  But
 either the will to resist was broken or else
 a reevaluation of national interests caused
 them to consider the area no longer vital.
 CEASE FIRE MEANINGLESS
 On the basis of all past experience, there-
 fore, a negotiated settlement in Vietnam can
 only have the purpose either of confirming
 a Communist decision to abandon the drive
 for control of Vietnam, or else an American
 decision to admit defeat and withdraw.  A
 cease fire would be meaningless.  It would
 only leave the guerrillas In place and free
 to use the interval to run in more rein-
 forcements and arms until they were ready
 for the next push.  Withdrawal of all Com-
 munist guerrillas behind the 17th parallel,
 as is sometimes suggested,  woud be  fine,
 but would of course be tantamount to a total
 Communist defeat in Vietnam.     President
 Johnson has no Intelligence as yet to lead
 him to suppose that the Communists are
 ready for anything of the sort,
 On the contrary-and this is the second
 set of facts prevailing in the Vietnam situa-
 tion-the Communist world remains unani-
 mous in its declarations that the only basis
 for a negotiated settlement in Vietnam is
 the complete withdrawal of American forces,
 which is tantamount to a complete American
 defeat.
 These statements might be written off as
 mere propaganda bargaining were they not
 backed up by a great deal of background
 information  coming  out  of  Communist
 China, which indicate that she believes time
 and events are very much on her side. Since
 the second   hypothesis  for negotiations is
 that they must include Communist China,
 her attitude is obviously decisive to the out-
 come.  Here are some of the more public
 facts which the President must consider:
 1. Between December 21, 1964, and January
 4, 1965, the first sesison of the Third Na-
 tional  People's  Congress was  convened in
 Peiping.  Nearly 3,000 deputies met behind
 closed doors to hear speeches by the leaders
 of Communist China. In addition to state-
 ments by Marshal Ho Lung boasting that
 the Chinese people's army has been con-
 siderably enlarged, supplied with up-to-date
 equipment, and is now supported by power-
 ful naval and air force units, the Chinese
 published on December 30 an abbreviated
 version of Premier Chou En-Iai's report on
 Chinese domestic and foreign policy.
 The speech reflected great pride and self-
 confidence resulting from the explosion of
 the atomic bomb, the surmounting of the
 very serious difficulties between  1959 and
 1961, resulting from the failure of the great
 leap forward, and the intention of trans-
 forming China into a world power with the
 most modern  industry,  agriculture,  tech-
 nology, and defense within the shortest pos-
 sible time.  Reviewing foreign policy, Chou
 pledged support to all-and he listed each
 one-revolutionary movements and centers
 of unrest. He declared that Peiping would
 consider negotiation with the United States
 only after it had given up Taiwan and would
 deal with the United Nations only when it
 had thrown out Nationalist China.
 Chou further asserted that the east wind
 would prevail over the west wind, and that
 favorable conditions for such an outcome
 are the storm centers of world revolution
 in Asia, Africa,  and  Latin America.  The
 speech forces the conclusion that the Chinese
 Communists are not only conscious of their
 power, but are also prepared to use it to
 support wars of liberation wherever possible
 in a continuing struggle against imperialism.
 2. As a concrete example that Chou meant
 what he said and that the "falling domino"
 theory in southeast Asia was not a figment
 of John Foster Dulles' overstimulated imagi-
 nation, Peiping formally announced on Feb-
 ruary 5, 1965, the formation of a patriotic
 front to overthrow the pro-Western Gov-
 ernment of Thailand and eradicate American
 influence there.  For some time now, Com-
 munist agents have been infiltrating into
 Thailand in order to form the nucleus for
 subverting that country.   The Thais have
 instituted energetic countermeasures which
 have so far kept them under control, but it is
 foolish to believe that Thailand would or
 could resist a Communist takeover backed
 by China if South Vietnam is lost.  The
 Chinese do not even wait until one victim
 is gobbled up before proclaiming their plans
 to take over the next one.
 3. Mao Tse-tung stated in a January in-
 terview  with  American  journalist                                                                                                                                       Edgar
 Snow that the crisis in Vietnam will not
 lead to war between China and the United
 States so long as China is not invaded. He
 also said that the war in Vietnam would last
 only another year or two because the South
 Vietnamese are deserting in large numbers
 and the Americans will lose interest. While
 this statement greatly reduces the likelihood
 of any Chinese retaliation againt our raids
 on North Vietnam.  It gives no comfort to
 those urging negotiation.  If Mao really be-
 lieves that the war will be won by the Com-
 munists in another year or two, then it is

 obvious that he looks on negotiation only
 to confirm this fact, which is another point
 he actually made in the Interview.  Unless
 he can be shaken in this conviction there is
 no possible basis fdr negotiation with China.
 MUST STOP REDS
 It is easy for those without responsibility
 to call for negotiation, as though this were
 the automatic panacea for all the world's
 ills.  But  the            U.S.  Government  is  faced
 with the kinds of facts mentioned above,
 as well as much more grim data of a secret
 nature, which cannot be shrugged off,  This
 is why it has consistently rejected calls for
 a new  Geneva Conference  and why even
 the British have supported this stand.   It
 is accepted as axiomatic by most    policy-
 makers that  under  present                             circumstances
 negotiation could lead only to an American
 defeat.
 Such a defeat cannot be accepted, not sim-
 ply for reasons of foolish national pride, but
 because the Chinese have made it so very
 plain that Vietnam is only part of a much
 wider plan for aggrandizement and trouble
 making.  We are helping Vietnam because It
 is in the interest of freemen everywhere
 that the Communist challenge be halted at
 this point.
 The President Is trying to create a new
 psychological situation in Asia. His decision
 to retaliate against North Vietnam is the
 only one which offers any hope of success.  It
 has-been long overdue and is all the more
 difficult for that reason, but it is still not too
 late.  W. Johnson should be warmly con-
 gratulated for  his  action.     If  we                                carry
 through our policy with resolution there is
 still an excellent chance that we can win the
 Vietnam war at least in the sense that the
 Communists are induced to call off the war as
 a bad business and either withdraw the
 guerrillas into North Vietnam or else cease
 outside aid completely and leave them to
 their fate.  Only then can there be a genuine
 basis for a negotiation which will ratify this
 decision.
 The Communists will not come willingly
 or easily to such a disagreeable choice. Pre-
 vious U.S. vacillation has led them to count
 the Vietnam war as already won.  It will
 probably take time and a great deal of pun-
 ishment before they call off the war.  But
 they are practical men and eventually bow
 to reality. What Is essential now is that the
 President be given the time to make the full
 effect of his new policy felt in Hanoi, Peiping,
 and Moscow without being continually badg-
 ered to negotiate.  The calls for negotiation
 only make the task harder and bloodier be-
 cause it encourages the Communists to think
 that we may still falter in our purpose.  It
 is still a Chinese article of faith that world
 and domestic pressures can be mobilized to
 thwart any resolute action by the U.S. Gov-
 ernment.  Many past follies have confirmed
 them in this viewpoint.
 TURNING POINT IN HISTORY
 A great experiment Is underway-the ex-
 periment to see whether we can successfully
 contain Communist China on the mainland
 of Asia.             If we cannot, the consequences to
 our children are hideous to contemplate.
 The Chinese have the numbers, the drive,
 the ambition, and the eventual 15otential to
 rule the world.  The days through which we
 are now passing will mark one of the great
 turning points of world history.
 The United States has very strong trumps
 to play In this contest.  If North Vietnam
 is willing, or is forced by China to sacrifice
 herself in a continuing effort to win South
 Vietnam, there is yet one final arrow in our
 quiver.  We can threaten China with the
 one punishment she would most fear: The
 destruction of her nuclear plants by aerial
 bombardment.  If forced to carry out this
 threat, we would at least prevent or delay the
 looming menace of a nuclear-armed China.

 VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION DOM-
 ICILIARY AT THOMASVILLE, GA.
 Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, there
 was published in the February 7 edition
 of the Jacksonville, Fla., Times-Union
 an excellent article concerning the op-
 eration of the Veterans' Administration
 domiciliary at Thomasville, Ga., one of
 the facilities which it was announced Is
 scheduled to be closed.
 This article clearly shows the domicili-
 ary's value, both to the veterans it serves
 and to the community in which it is lo-
 cated. It is my hope that the operation
 of this facility will not be discontinued,
 and that the Veterans' Administration
 will reconsider its plans.
 It is indeed regrettable to me that our
 veterans should suffer because of a pur-
 ported economy move by the administra-
 tion, although it must be kept in mind
 that our disabled veterans must be dom-
 iciled and provided home and medical
 care, and that if this facility is closed,
 they will have to be moved and cared
 for at some other location. I fail to see
 any economy in such a move.
 As pointed out in the article, there are
 both human and economic factors to be
 considered, and I hope they will not be
 disregarded by the Veterans' Administra-
 tion.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have this article printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 HUMAN, ECONOMIC ELEMENTS HINGE ON
 VETERANS' UNIT
 (By Carey Cameron)
 THOMASVILLE, GA., February B.-Both the
 human and the economic elements are of
 concern to those who will be affected if the
 Veterans' Administration domiciliary here Is
 closed.
 Thomasville and Thomas County residents
 and businessmen are concerned about the
 economic element.  Counting payroll, other
 expenditures and non-VA jobs affected by
 the VA payroll, the area may lose about $6
 million annually, says chamber of commerce
 Executive Vice President Lloyd Eckberg.
 The members who live at domiciliary (they
 are called members, not patients, stresses
 J. W. Legg, assistant domiciliary director),
 their few relatives and the American Legion
 are concerned with the human element--
 the displacement of 765 residents of the
 home, 26 percent of which are indigent.
 It is possible that everything will turn
 up roses on both accounts.  Lockheed of
 Georgia, a corporation that does 98 percent
 of its business with the Government, will
 submit a bid February 16 for the right to
 operate an Urban Job Corps Training Center
 under the Office of Economic Opportunity
 programs.
 W. A. Pulver, president of the corporation,
 has told the Thomasville-Thomas Chamber
 of Commerce that the school will be located
 at the domiciliary site if Lockheed gets the
 contract.  Revenue here from the school
 could reach $7 million annually, Lockheed
 estimates.
 Plans are being worked out to transfer
 domiciliary members to various combination
 hospital-domicilary centers in  other  loca-
 tions.  But Lockheed may not get the train-
 ing center contract and Donald E. Johnson,
 national American Legion commander, has
 charged  that  there  Is  no  assurance, new
 homes will be found for the veterans.
 On January 12 the VA announced plans
 to close 11 hospitals, 16 regional offices, and
 4 domiciliaries.  This plan would eliminate
 3,201  domiciliary beds.  Although medical
 care is offered in clinic and infirmary-type
 departments, domiciliaries are not hospitals.
 "They are domiciles (homes) for veteran;
 who have disabilities preventing them from
 earning a livelihood," Legg explained.  Wher.
 a domiciliary members needs hospital care
 he is taken to a veterans hospital.  Veterans
 at the Thomasville facility are usually sent
 to Lake City, Fla.
 In return, patients recovered enough to no
 longer need hospital care are sent back to
 domiciliaries to make way for new patients:.
 The other three domiciliaries to be closed are
 at Clinton, Iowa, in Commander Johnson's
 home State:  White City, Oreg., and Bath,
 N.Y.  The Bath home is a VA center, offer-
 ing both hospital and domiciliary care, Legg
 explained.
 At Thomasville, the domiciliary has an. an-
 nual budget of $1,800,000.  Members' income
 from social security, pensions and other com-
 pensation totals $1.5 million.   The capitr:l
 assets are about $3.5 million, Legg said.
 An evacuation plan, subject to approval by
 the central VA office in Washington, calls for
 all members to be moved out by March 31.
 The staff of 161 employees would be gore
 and the operation closed by June 30.
 Members not discharged or transferred to
 hospitals by March 31 would be moved  o
 centers at Biloxi, Miss., Bay Pines, Fla., Dub-
 lin, Ga., and Mountain Home, Tenn.
 On January 13 admissions to all receiving
 domiciliaries were frozen.  The Thomasville
 facility  has  800  beds  but  operates  on a
 planned average member load of 760, leaving
 a margin of up to 50 beds.   On January 14
 it had 765 members of which 193 were Flor-
 ida residents and 263 were Georgia residents.
 World War II veterans, a group whose need
 for domiciliary care is growing now that tb.eir
 average age has reached 45, comprised 56.84
 percent of'the residents while World War I
 veterans made up 33.28 percent.  There ware
 lesser numbers of Korean and peacetime vet-
 erans,  Six residents are Spanish-American
 War veterans.
 Other facilities also have a margin between
 total beds and caseload and it is figured t'aat
 this margin plus natural turnover will make
 room for those being moved from the clos-
 ing facilities, Legg explained.
 The Thomasville domiciliary was built
 during World War II as Finney General Ifos-
 pital.  Like most military facilities of ;hat
 day its exterior appearance is crude but in-
 teriors are comfortable.
 About 50 percent of the rooms are private
 or semiprivate and a main dining room ac-
 commodates  408  men  who  are  fed  in  2
 shifts.  Light  recreation,  such  as  shuffle-
 board, is available for those able to take
 part.  Some can play the game but others
 are in wheelchairs.
 After the war, the old general hospital was
 used for 1 year as a VA hospital before the
 domiciliary was opened officially December 1,
 1948.  Legg, who works under Administrator
 E. C. McDaniel, has been here since 1948.
 When news of the closing was announced,
 Thomasville Mayor Roy Lilly and Frank Neel,
 immediate past chamber president, went to
 Washington to see what could be done but
 were given assurance the order would not be
 revoked.

 Mrs. Gross remained at the home In the

 of her remaining savings, she received her
 room and her board (because she had no
 teeth she could eat only a bland diet).  The
 weekly doctor's visits and medication were
 extra.
 She liked the home but, when an opening
 came up in a larger home with medical
 treatment included, she decided to move.
 Now, in another home in the Bronx, she
 has turned over all but $120 of her savings
 (which the city welfare people have per-
 mitted  her to  keep  for burial  expenses).
 She had been assured by administrators of
 the home that she now has nothing to worry

 Like a great many other older New Yorkers,
 Anna Gross has given up. In just 7 months,
 she has learned that the city and the people
 who work for it have little time and less
 interest in her problems and what becomes
 of her.
 To her relatives, who cannot afford to sup-
 port her and don't have room enough to
 take her in, she has become something of
 a burden.
 To the people who run the home she now
 lives in, she has become little more than a
 means of obtaining welfare funds from the
 city.
 And to the city Itself, she has become a
 statistic, a number the administration would
 like to forget.
 To New York, a city which has failed to
 provide adequate services and a good life for
 its young and middle-aged citizens, the
 problems of the aged may seem secondary.
 But to a city in which the aged population
 has increased sharply and will continue to
 increase in the next decade, it Is a problem
 that no longer can be ignored.
 ,NEW YORK CITY IN CaIsxs-CITY HOSPITALS:
 A PRODUCT Or BUREAUCRACY
 (By Claude Lewis and Barry Gottehrer)
 Isaiah Lee is a 30-year-old Formosan who
 can speak and understand Chinese, Japanese,
 French and English.  He cannot, however,
 speak or understand Spanish.
 For most New Yorkers, this linguistic limi-
 tation would present no special problem. But
 Isaiah Lee is an exception.  He is a social
 caseworker, employed by the department of
 hospitals, at Manhattan's Metropolitan Hos-
 pital where the majority of the patients are
 Puerto Ricans who speak and understand
 only Spanish.
 It is his job to obtain detailed biographical
 and financial information from each of 150
 patients assigned to him, make applications
 for welfare and then help the patients pre-
 pare for care after discharge.
 EXPEDIENCY
 The fact that he is bright (he holds a
 master's degree from the University of Ne-
 braska)  and dedicated hasn't made it any
 easier for him or his patients In the 7 months
 he has worked at the hospital.
 standing and communication Is not limited
 to Isaiah Lee and his patients at Metropoli-
 tan Hospital.   Today, it permeates almost
 every level of life in New York City where
 the government has consistently failed its
 workers and has Increasingly forgotten about
 its citizens.
 Metropolitan Hospital, located on the out-
 skirts of Spanish Harlem at 97th Street and
 First Avenue, is certainly not the worst of
 the 21  city hospitals.   It is not the best
 either.
 Yet 1 month there-as a worker or as a
 patient-is enough to convince anyone that
 the city, despite a talented and diligent com-
 missioner of hospitals, is clearly not keeping
 pace with its problems.
 According to the department of hospitals'
 personnel section, the only requirement for
 Mr. Lee's position as social caseworker is a
 master's degree in social casework from an
 accredited college.
 NO TEST REQUIRED
 No test, no language proficiency and no
 depth interview are required, according to a
 department spokesman.  Since the job pays
 $6,290 a year to start and reaches a maxi-
 mum of only $7,490 after approximately 6
 years, the city cannot afford to be particu-
 larly selective,in its hiring.  Top personnel,
 if they accept a lower-rung city job, rarely
 stay long before moving elsewhere, generally
 into private industry.
 Seated in a narrow fifth-floor office within
 walking distance of the four wards he must
 cover daily,  Isaiah  Lee  is surrounded by
 paperwork and buried by bureaucracy.
 Dozens of applications for welfare are piled
 neatly in one corner of the desk, many or
 them still unanswered though he had for-
 warded them to one of the city's welfare cen-
 ters weeks and even months before.
 Mr. Lee no longer is surprised by the wait-
 ing.  Since there is no master list showing
 exactly which nursing home might have a
 vacancy.  Mr.  Lee  is  faced  with  three
 choices:
 He can telephone each of the city's more
 than 50 public and private pursing homes
 each day (which he simply doesn't have time
 to do).
 He can rely on relatives and friends (if
 they are willing) to find a home for the
 patient.
 Or, overwhelmed by the workload, frus-
 trated by the redtape, and distressed by the
 lack of progress, he can simply give up.  Like
 a great many other people working for the
 city, secure in their jobs regardless of their
 performance, he can become immune to any-
 one's problems but his own.
 Isaiah Lee has not yet given up but it is
 not because he did not have considerable
 reason.
 "We have many people here who are too
 old and senile to do much for," he said.
 "It's the others who are still alert, who don't
 belong in a hospital any more but have no
 place to go.  You want to help them and
 you  try to help them.  But things move
 very slowly, very very slowly.  You want to
 do more but you can't,"
 It is not that the supervisors at Metropoli-
 tan Hospital are unaware of these problems.
 They are.  But, for them, the problems and
 frustrations are so far ranging that they
 stagger the imagination.
 Once located on Welfare Island, Metropoli-
 tan Hospital moved to its present location in
 1967 and today, with 1,000 beds (the same
 Because of his heavy accent, most of his              people living and working in an area that

 difficulty understanding his questions.  And,            to 116th Streets.
 "Our No. 1 problem is overcrowding," says
 Dr. Ferdinand Piazza, administrator of the
 hospital.  "On occasion, we have to treat pa-
 tients in an outpatient  clinic when they
 should be in the hospital.  It's what we call
 a calculated risk.  There just isn't any place
 to put all of the people who should be in bed
 in a hospital with proper nursing, quiet, fa-
 cilities required to bring them back to a
 healthy state.  We could use another 1,000
 beds here in order to function at a good and
 proper level to meet the needs of our com-
 munity."
 NURSE SHORTAGE
 In  1964,  Metropolitan  Hospital  treated
 505,995 people, an average of nearly 1,400 a
 day, in its outpatient clinic with a staff of
 only 68, including only 36 nurses.
 To take care of more than 24,000 inpatients
 each year (only Bellevue and Kings County
 have more), Mrs. Ruth Rose, senior super-
 visor of nursing at the hospital, says she
 needs 297 registered nurses.  Right now, Met-
 ropolitan has only 74 registerednurses on its
 staff.
 "I would rather have 297 registered nurses
 than $1 million," says Mrs. Rose, who has
 been forced to hire 219 practical nurses (less
 educated, less experienced, and not permitted
 to perform many duties a registered nurse
 can) to try and make up for the shortage.
 "It's hard to get people to work nights, be-
 cause of attacks by men in this area.  It's
 not safe to walk the streets here at night.
 We complain and get some relief, but we
 need more police in the area."
 Because of the limited pay scale, the over-
 crowded, understaffed conditions, the diffi-
 culty in accomplishing anything, and the lo-
 cations (many are in or nearby slum areas),
 the city hospitals have been forced to settle
 for second best in personnel.  Yet the prob-
 lems at Metropolitan and other city hospitals
 are by no means limited to the quantity and
 quality of its personnel.
 Typical is Metropolitan's request for a gen-
 erator.  Several years ago, when the city suf-
 fered a massive power failure, the city gov-
 ernment decided that each of its hospitals
 must have generators just in case the city's
 power should ever fail again.  Today, nearly
 4 years since the major city power failure,
 Metropolitan still Is without its generators.
 The reason for the delay?  Redtape.
 A HOPE
 "We expect them soon," said Dr. Piazza,
 and smiled.
 Despite its $15 million budget (only Belle-
 vue and Kings County are larger), there is
 still a daily shortage of towels, sheets, and
 more vital equipment.
 "Sometimes it takes a full year to get a
 piece of equipment you really need," says
 Dr. Piazza.
 Though the hospital personnel and admin-
 istrators are frustrated and disillusioned by
 the city's inability and indifference to their
 problems, it Is the patient who inevitably
 must pay, with his health and occasionally
 with his life.

 . Mr. BINGHAM.  Mr. Speaker, all of
 us today are concerned about the situa-
 tion in Vietnam. The President is being
 criticized from all sides. I believe, pow-
 ever, that there is 'far more widespread
 support for the President's approach to
 the problem than appears from the pub-
 lic media.
 I have developed this thought in an
 open letter to the President, which I am
 sending him today.  It reads as follows:
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:    If one were to judge
 from the public media, one might suppose
 that the general line you have been follow-
 ing in Vietnam has little support in this
 .country.  Most speeches, articles or ads at-
 tack you for being either too hard or too soft.
 On the one hand, we have the Goldwaters,
 the Nixons, and the Joe Alsops, calling for
 full-scale war against North Vietnam and
 -maybe Communist China.  On the other
 hand, we have all kinds of people, including
 especiallly many liberals, who are either urg-
 ing a pullout from Vietnam or who keep
 telling you to negotiate, negotiate, negotiate.
 While they may not be so outspoken, the
 Majority of the American people refuse as
 you 'do to accept an oversimplified either/or
 position. While they are miserably unhappy
 about the situation (as I am sure you are)
 and while they may wish that a cease-fire
 were in effect and negotiations for a viable
 settlement .weere going on (as I am sure you
 do also) , they do not want you to let the
 Communists have their way in Vietnam and
 they do not want you to widen the war.
 Hanson Baldwin's article in time mag-
 azine for February 21, which I take to be a
 statement of the views of many Pentagon
 military men, is a brilliant exposition of a
 policy the  American people in my view
 simply will not support.  Mr. Baldwin calls
 for a korean-type war in Vietnam, fully rec-
 ognizing the likelihood that Red China would
 probably  be   drawn  in. Pointing to  the
 Cuban precedent, he predicts that the So-
 viet Union would not respond with nuclear
 attacks, and he may be right, but to bomb
 North Vietnam's vitals, would the American
 people be prepared to accept the risks they
 were prepared to accept to get Soviet missiles,
 aimed at our vitals, out of Cuba? I doubt it.
 The threat in Vietnam to our security is too
 indirect, too remote, and the benefits to be
 reaped are too tenuous and uncertain.
 Stand fast against the "hawks," Mr. Pres-
 ident.  The American people are with you.
 At the same time, as the polls show, ma-
 jority sentiment in this country is not for
 a pullout from Vietnam.  There is wide rec-
 ognition of what such a decision would do
 to the morale of our friends around the
 world  who  are  resisting  communism-in
 Thailand, in the Philippines, in West Berlin,
 in Venezuela-and to their confidence in us.
 (I found last summer, even in countries such
 as Burma and India, people hoping that the
 United States will not withdraw and leave
 southeast  Asia   completely  unprotected
 against the Chinese Communists.)
 But what about these more and more fre-
 quent appeals to you to negotiate?  Do these
 perhaps  reflect  American  public opinion?
 After all, Americans are great believers in the
 conference table.
 Here again, I suspect that your position is
 more widely understood than the flood of
 published comment might indicate.     The
 question surely is not as simple as many of
 the appeals imply.  It is not whether to ne-
 gotiate, but under what circumstances, with
 whom, with what end in view, and with what
 prospects of success.
 As traders, Americans can understand that.
 They might understand it better if you
 could spell it out for them, but they know
 you can't lay all your cards on the table.
 It may well be, for example, that you have
 concluded that any settlement in Vietnam,
 in order to be viable, must be part of a
 package involving the settlement of many
 broader issues affecting the future of the Far
 East, but that you do not feel in a position
 today to indicate your thinking as to the
 outlines of such a broader settlement.
 To those of my fellow liberals who keep
 urging a cease-fire and negotiations, I should
 like to suggest a few questions worth ponder-
 ing:
 Why should Peiping be interested in serious
 negotiations over Vietnam now (except for
 our virtual surrender) ?  If North Vietnam
 might have greater reason to call off the
 fighting, what can we do to widen this po-
 tential area of disagreement between Hanoi
 and Peiping?  Can we work with the Soviet
 Union in this area?  What steps can we take
 to strengthen the position of the South Viet-
 namese Government among the people of
 South Vietnam?  If a neutralization of all
 Vietnam could be achieved, as suggested by
 De Gaulle, what guarantees could be provided
 against a Laos-type erosion of the agree-
 ment?  In light of the absence from the U.N.
 of both Vietnams and mainland China, and
 in light of the permanent members' veto
 power in the Security Council, what else can
 the U.N. realistically do beyond providing a
 peacekeepers presence if an agreement is
 reached?   What is the necessary relation-
 ship, if any, between a cease-fire and nego-
 tiations (remembering that in Korea we ne-
 gotiated for many months while the fighting
 continued)?
 You, Mr. President, are well aware of these
 questions.  They represent just a few of the
 complexities involved, complexities which too
 often seem ignored by the simple pleas to
 negotiate.  Last fall Senator Goldwater was
 rightly accused of oversimplifying interna-
 tional  problems.   Some  of  your  liberal
 friends who today are criticizing you, Mr.
 President, might do well to consider whether
 they are not oversimplifying from the other
 end of the political spectrum.
 I hope and believe, Mr. President, that
 you agree with the view that in the long
 run military measures alone cannot solve
 the problems of Vietnam and that a new
 political settlement must be our objective.
 I hope and believe that you and your ad-
 visers are giving great thought to the pos-
 sible nature of such a settlement and to the
 possible means for achieving it.  What you
 can tell us about all this would be welcome
 and, I am sure, reassuring.  But, whether
 you can tell us or not, the world knows that
 you are no jingoist and that you desperately
 want to preserve the peace.  (The general
 reaction overseas to our recent retaliatory
 bombings confirms the widespread trust of
 the United States and its motives.)  The
 world also knows that, remembering Munich
 and the Sudetenland, you realize that ap-
 peasement is not the way to preserve the
 peace.
 There is nothing easier in this complex
 world of ours than to frame false either or
 imperatives.  More often than not, such ex-
 pressions represent a kind of immature im-
 patience.  A measure of our maturity, as we
 perforce  carry  the  responsibilities  of  the
 most powerful nation on earth, may well be
 the degree to which we are willing to accept
 the burdens of long-term sacrifices and re-
 sist the false appeal of quick solutions that
 may well represent disaster.  That you, Mr.
 President, will meet this test is the convic-
 tion of this Congressman and, I believe, of
 the majority of the Congress and the Ameri-
 can people.
 Respectfully yours,
 JONATHAN B. BINGHAM,
 Member of Congress.
 APPORTIONMENT QF STATE
 LEGISLATURES
 (Mr. ICHORD (at the request of Mr.
 Dow) was granted permission to extend
 3333,
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. ICHORD.  Mr. Speaker, article V
 of the U.S. Constitution reads in part as
 follows :
 The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both
 Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose
 amendments to this Constitution, or, on the
 application of legislatures of two-thirds of
 the several States, shall call a convention for
 proposing amendments, which in either case,
 shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as
 part of this Constitution, when ratified by
 the legislatures of three-fourths of the sev-
 eral States, or by conventions In three-fourths
 thereof, as the one or the other mode of
 ratification may be proposed by the Con-
 gress.
 Last December I met in Chicago with
 leaders of the Council' of State Govern-
 ments and it was later decided that the
 council would urge the legislatures of
 the various States to petition the Con-
 gress to either call a convention or sub-
 mit an amendment to the Constitution
 for ratification.  Last week the Missouri
 Legislature finally passed the resolution
 proposed by the council and is one of the
 16 States to have done so.  It should be
 noted that the wording of the resolution
 is identical to House Joint Resolution 64
 which I have introduced.    Those of us
 who have introduced resolutions on this
 very important constitutional issue are
 determined that the Congress should
 have the opportunity to vote on a con-
 stitutional amendment in the very near
 future.  To this end we have formed a
 steering committee to press for imme-
 diate consideration.  As a member of the
 steering committee I intend to take all
 action available to us under the rules to
 reach a vote as early as possible.
 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
 to revise and extend my remarks in the
 body of the RECORD and include a copy of
 House Concurrent Resolution No. 2, as
 passed by the Missouri General Assembly
 by a vote of 109 to 45 in the House of
 Representatives and 21 to 11 in the Mis-
 souri Senate:

 Be it resolved by the house of representat-

 the United States to call a convention for

 as an amendment to the Constitution of the
 United States:

 shall prohibit any State which shall have a
 bicameral legislature from apportioning the
 membership of one house of such legislature
 on factors other than population, provided
 that the plan if such apportionment shall
 have been submitted to and approved by a
 vote of the electorate of that State;

 of how membership governing bodies of its

 THE ROLE OF ORGANIZED LABOR
 IN THE ALLIANCE FOR PROG-
 RESS
 (Mr. GONZALEZ (at the request of Mr.
 Dow) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous. matter.)
 Mr. GONZALEZ.   Mr. Speaker, the
 charter that emerged from the meeting
 of the American Republics at Punta del
 Este, Uruguay, from August 5 to 17, 1961,
 is destined to be remembered as one of
 the most comprehensive and significant
 documents of the 20th century.  This
 charter, which established the Alliance
 for Progress, is only 31/2 years old. It is
 widely known but not widely understood.
 For I believe that in the years to come,
 when the Charter of Punta del Este, has
 had the chance to be sufficiently used
 and tested to achieve the purposes for
 which it was designed, it will earn its
 place alongside the Magna Carta, our
 own Declaration of Independence and
 the Constitution, the Constitution of
 Mexico, and the other great instruments
 of freedom and social justice.
 One of the noteworthy achievements
 of the charter is its recognition of the
 role that organized labor must play in
 any national program of social and eco-
 nomic development.  The preamble to
 the charter states:
 We, the American Republics, hereby pro-
 claim our decision to unite in a common
 effort to bring our people accelerated eco-
 nomic progress and broader social justice
 within the framework of personal dignity
 and political liberty.
 The charter itself expands upon this
 lofty goal and sets out the basic require-
 ments for economic and social develop-
 ment. According to chapter II of title II:
 1. Participating Latin American countries
 agree to introduce or strengthen systems for
 the preparation, execution, and periodic re-
 vision of national programs for economic and
 social development consistent with the prin-
 ciples, objectives, and requirements contained
 in  this  document.    Participating  Latin
 American countries should formulate long-
 term development programs.
 Such national development programs
 are supposed to incorporate self-help ef-
 forts directed toward "improvement of
 human resources and widening of op-
 portunities by providing adequate re-
 muneration for work performed, encour-
 aging the talents of managers, entre-
 preneurs, and wage earners; providing
 more productive employment for under-
 employed manpower; establishing effec-
 tive systems of labor relations, and pro-
 cedures for consultation and collabora-
 tion among public authorities, employer
 associations, and labor organizations."
 Labor participates in the Alliance pri-
 marily through the American Institute
 for Free Labor Development-AIFLD-
 a nonprofit organization supported joint-
 ly by unions, employers, and govern-
 ment.  It has operated as a school to
 train Latin American labor leaders and
 as an arm for the planning and con-
 struction of social projects in Latin
 America.  The fact that the Alliance
 has helped build 200,000 new houses is
 a partial tribute to the success of this
 phase of the program.
 In the February 1965 issue of the
 Boilermakers-Blacksmiths Record, the
 publication of the International Brother-
 hood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Build-
 ers, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers,
 is an article entitled "The Alliance for
 Progress."  This well written and illu-
 minating article, by Lester L. Zosel, tells
 the story of labor's role in the Alliance.
 It is succinct and well worth reading
 for the understanding of our interna-
 tional partnership with the countries of
 Latin America which it furthers.  With
 unanimous consent I am inserting the
 article by Lester L. Zosel in the RECORD:
 THE  ALLIANCE  FOR  PROGRESS-SOCIAL AND
 ECONOMIC  REFORMS IN  THE  AMERICAS OR
 POVERTY,  CHAOS, AND  CONTINUED OPPRES-
 SION?
 (By Lester L. Zosel)
 On March 13, 1961, the late President Ken-
 nedy announced that he was calling upon all
 of the people of this hemisphere to join in
 an "Alliance for Progress ? " " a vast coopera-
 tive effort, unparalleled in magnitude and
 nobility of purpose, to satisfy the basic needs
 of the American people for homes, work and
 land, health and schools."
 He unveiled this sweeping new program to
 a group of Latin American leaders attending
 a White House reception.   The next day,
 March 14, he sent his program to Congress
 with a request for the necessary funds to
 give it life.  In August 1961 the charter for
 the Alliance was signed by representatives
 of 20 nations at a conference in Punta del
 Este, Uruguay.
 The    signers  were:   Argentina,  Bolivia,
 Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Domin-
 ican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guate-
 mala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,
 Panama, Peru, United States, Uruguay, and
 Venezuela.
 Naturally, the newspapers and other com-
 munications media gave publicity to the Al-
 liance when it was announced, as is the case
 with Presidential proclamations.  There also
 was reporting on the Punta del Este con-
 ference.  But what have you read or heard
 about it since?  Chances are, the answer is
 "very little."
 The chances are greater still that you have
 read nothing in the daily press regarding the
 role being played by United States and Latin
 American labor in this worthy project.  Such
 participation by labor is designed to insure
 that assistance reaches those for whom it is
 intended.
 For the most part the continuing story of
 the Alliance has been shamefully ignored by
 most of our Nation's newspapers, magazines,
 radio, and television-this despite the fact
 that the Alliance is a program involving
 money, plans, and far-reaching objectives to
 dwarf anything of its kind in past history.
 Unfortunately, this article, limited as it
 must be, cannot begin to fill the news gap
 on the Alliance.   Instead, my modest de-
 sign is to bring you an appreciation of the
 program's importance and its staggering di-
 mension, and to describe labor's role in help-
 ing to advance its nobility of purpose.
 The sweep of the Alliance is best illus-
 trated by its charter, wherein signatories are
 pledged to achieving a long list of imposing
 objectives-economic  and  social  develop-
 ment, land and tax reforms, improved wages
 and working conditions, better housing, a
 greatly reduced rate of illiteracy, stabilized
 prices, improved health and sanitation, stim-
 ulated private enterprise, and stronger demo-
 cratic institutions.
 Notable advancement toward these goals
 is expected to require at least $100 billion
 over the  next 10 years.  Latin American
 nations will provide some $80 billion of that
 amount.   The United States has pledged a
 major share of the remaining $20 billion.
 However, some funds also are coming from
 other nations,  international  organizations,
 and private enterprise.
 The task of implementing U.S. participa-
 tion in the Alliance falls to the Agency for
 International Development, a State Depart-
 ment Agency which administers foreign aid
 programs.  U.S. funds for the Alliance come
 out of the annual foreign aid authoriza-
 tions by Congress.  AID's Administrator has
 the authority and responsibility for carrying
 out Alliance projects.
 The Alliance, unlike too many foreign aid
 programs in the past, has prerequisites for
 those who are to receive its assistance-
 individuals,  communities,  or  governments.
 Recipients must prove they also are trying to
 help themselves, plans are required to have
 some long-range characteristics and Latin
 American  governments  are  committed to
 make long-overdue reforms.
 While these prerequisites still are not be-
 ing met as rapidly as hoped for, the Alliance
 has brought reforms, to varying degrees, in
 Latin America.
 Sixteen countries have improved thci.? tax
 programs within the past year.  A number
 of these have tightened up collections on
 previously wealthy families.  Tax revenues
 in some countries are up as much as 30 per-
 cent.  Land reform has been undertaken in
 12 countries since 1960.
 What are Alliance's accomplishments in 3
 years of existence?  That's a big question-
 far too big to be fully answered here.  How
 will anyone be able to tabulate, at any given
 time, the results of a "peaceful revolution"
 that is to stretch through a 7,000-mile-long
 continent inhabited by more than 200 mil-
 lion people living in jungles, mountains and
 massive cities?
 Even so, AID Administrator David E. Bell
 has assembled some impressive statistics.
 He reported that by the end of June the
 Alliance will have helped to build 220,000
 new houses, constructed more than 23,000
 classrooms, trained 20,000 new teachers and
 printed 6 million books.  Over 550 mobile
 health units, hospitals and health centers
 will have been established.
 More than 200,000 agricultural loans have
 been  made.  Nearly  15 million people  in
 more than 1,000 towns and villages now get
 clean water from Alliance-built supply sys-
 tems.                                                                                                                                   Millions of dollars in loans are sup-
 porting  industrial                                                                                                                                      development; electric
 powerllnes are going up; roads are being
 built; community development programs are
 clearing slums, fighting disease, and improv-
 ing diets.  Credit unions and cooperatives
 have blossomed forth in more than a dozen
 countries.
 Not only does the Alliance charter call
 for labor's participation in its great endeavor,
 but  it  also lists  establishing  of  effective
 labor relations as an important "self help"
 to be initiated in developing a project.    This
 firm recognition of labor's importance has
 brought strong support for the Alliance from.
 free unions throughout the Western Hemi-
 sphere.
 The American Institute for Free Labor De-
 velopment is the key instrument for labor's
 participation.  Begun in 1960, it is a non-
 profit  organization  supported  jointly  by
 unions, employers, and government. AFL--
 CIO President George Meany is its president.
 Its executive director is Serafino Romualdi,
 a man of wide experience in labor's inter-
 American affairs.  The Brotherhood of Rail-
 way Clerks chief executive officer, George M.
