				 	[Article  by  Ma~  V.   	Lyakhov:    	"Combat  Readiness  of  U.S.  Air  Force  Reserve			   	~

				 	[Excerpts]    	Along  with  increasing  the  combat  power  of  iCs  regular  units  and
					subunits,   	the  co~mmand  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force  is  constantly  increasing  the    	com-
					bst  readiness  of  its  reserve  components--the  Air  Forces  of  the  National  Guard
					and  the  command  of  the  Air  Force  Reserve.    	All  measures  in  this  field  are  being
					conducted  in  accordance  with  the  "single  force"  concept  which  has  been  ad~pted			-
					by  the  Pentagon,  the  essence  of  which  consists  of  the  us~e  of  regular  forcea  and
					reserves  as  a  single  whole  for  the  accomplishment  of  Yaissiona  faced  by  the
					armed  forces  and,   	in  particular,   	those  facing  the  Air  Force.    	The  basic  goal
					of  these  mpasures,  which  include  the  reequipping  of  the  units  and  subun~ts  of
					the  organized  reserve  with  contemporary  combat  equipmen.*.  and  weapons,   	the  im-
					provement  of  their  organizational  structure,   	the  intensification  of  combat
					training,   	and  so  forth,   	is  to  raise  the  combat  readiness  of  the  reserve  coar
					ponents  to  the  level  of  the  Regular  Air  Force.											~
					According  to  data  published  recently  in  the  foreign  press,   	the  Air  National
					Guard  and  the  Air  Force  reserve  command  now  contain  294,000  people,  c,f  them
					136,000  in  the  organized  reserve,  and  there  are  also  about  2,000  airplanes.
					According  to  the  words  of  the  commander  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force  TAC  [Tactical
					Air  Co~nand],  General  Dixon,   	the  combat  readiness  of  the  organized  reserve  is
	  	'		    	now  determined  in  accordance  with  the  same  criteria  and  standards  as  for  the
					Regular  Air  Foxce.    	About  90  percent  of  the  units  and  subunits  of  the  Air
					National  Guard  and  the  command  of  the  reserve  are  combat  ready.    	Upon  the
					declaration  of  mobilization,    	more  than  1,100  airplanes  and  52,000  trained
					specialists  will  pour  into  the  ranks  of  TAC  from  the  reserve.
					The  determining  element  in  the  combat  readiness  of  each  specific  reserve  unit
					or  subunit  as  well  as  for  the  Regular  Air  Force  is  combat  capability  which  is
					evalusted  in  accordance  with  E  special  system.    	This  system  conaists  of  four		   	-
					stages  S(levels  of  combat  capability).    	Each  of  them  has�its  own  meaning:

			 	Guard's  combaC  readiness  statua  appeared  as  followe:    	90  percent  of  the  nir
			  	subunita  had  a  combat  capabili~y  level  of  S-3  or  higher   	(of  them,   	72  eubunite
			 	had  C-1  and  C-2)  while  the  ma~ority  of  the  auxiliary  ground  subunite  were  at
			  	levels  S-1  and  S-2;   	in  particular:    	69  percent  of  the  tactical  air  control
	  	'	     	groups,   	100  percent  of  the  subunits  for  installing  and  servicing  electronic
			  	equipment,  93  percent  of  the  signal  groups  and  deCechments~  90  percent  of  the
			  	air  weather  service  detactunents,  and  100  percent  of  the  constYUCtiott  aubuniCa.
			  	In  the  Air  Force  reserve  command  95  percent  ~f  the  squadrons  were  detiermined
			  	Co  be  combat-capable  (altog~ther,   	41  squadrons  are  sub~ect  to  an  evaluation  of
	   	~	     	a  combat-capable~  level) .
			  	The  combat-capability  staCus  of  an  air  squadron  is  determinesl  by  its  commander,
			  	and  he  reports  Chis  to  higher  headquarters.    	Checke  are  conducted  annually  hy		,
			  	representativea  of  the  inspector  of  the  correaponding  air  ar.my.    	In  the  opinion
	   	-	     	of  the  American  co~nand,   	the  most  ob~ective  resulCs  of  the  checks  are  attained
			  	with  operationa  of  the  flight  subunits  in   	the  course  of  tactical  flight  exer-
			  	cises  after  their  redeployment  to  other  air  bases  or  ~o  reserve  airfields  with
			  	li.ttle  ~mprovement  ra~kerthan  from  their  permanenL�  bases.
			  	Accarding  to  evidence  in  the  foreign  press,   	such  checks  are  being  uaed  ever  more
	  	_	     	widely  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force.    	Thus,   	if  in  July  1976  only  one  squadron  of  A-7D
			   	airplanes  from  the  169th  Tactical  Fighter  Group  of  the  Air  National  Guard  (air
			   	base  McIntyre  Air  Force  Base,  South  Carolina)  was  inspecCed  ~oint2y  witt~  Che
			   	33d  'i"actical  Fighter  Wing  of  the  2egular  Air  Force  at  Eglin  Air  Force  Base
			   	(Florida),   	in  July  1977  three  air  units  of  the  Air  National  Guard  were  already
			   	sub~ected  to  such  inspections:    	the  116th  Tactical  Fighter  Wing  (Dobbine  Air
			   	Force  Base,  Geor~ia),   	from  the  airfield  at  Travia  Field   	(in  the  same  statQ),
			   	the  127th  Tactical  Fighter  Wing  (Selfridge  Air  Force  Base,  Michigan),   	from
			   	Phelps-Collins  Air  Force  Base  in  the  same  state,  and  the  183d  Tactical  Fighter
			   	Group   	(Springfield   	Airfield,   	Illinois)   	from  Volk  [as  transliterated]  Field,
			   	jdisconsin.    	Now  the  Tactical  Air  Co~and  organizes  20-25  inspections  of  the
			   	Air  National  Guard  units  ~nd  subunits  att~ched  to  it  annually.    	An  important
			   	element  of  the  tactical  flight  exercises  is  determination  of  the  air  squad-
			   	rons'   	capabilities  to  accomplish  sorties  with  maximum  "combat"  tension.
			    	/The  Air  National  Guard/  is  the  basic  reserve  component  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force.
		   	~		It  is  part  of  the  armed  forces  of  the  states  which  are  subordinate  to  the			    	~
			    	governors  and,  at  the  same  time,   	a  component  element  of  the  Regular  Air  Force's

			   	Force  reserves.    	Here,   	as  noeed  in  the  foreign  press,   	the  anme  requirements  are
			   	imposed  on  Che  training  of  reservists  as  exise  in  the  regular  uniCs  and  sub-
		,		  	units.																				 	~
																										~
			   	According  to  the  statement  of  American  military  specialists,   	the  aubunits  of
			   	Che  Air  NaCional  Guard  and  the  U.S.  Air  Force  reserve  command  are  rather  widely
			   	involved  in  exercises  of  the  "Red  Flag"  and  "Blue  Flag"  series  and  oCher  Penta-
			   	gon  measures.    	In  confirmation  of  this,   	the  following  data  are  presented  in		     	'
			   	the  foreign  press.    	The  basic  goal  of  Che  "Red  Flag"  exercisea  is  for  the  tacti-
			   	cal  air  subunits  to  work  out  the  accomplishment  of  various  combae  missions  in
			   	cooperation  with  the  ground  troops  under  conditions  as  close  as  posaible  to
			   	actual  combat.    	These  exercises  are  conducted  on  a  specially  equipped  range  of
			   	Nellis  Air  Force  Base  (Nevada)   	and,   	in  the  opinion  of  foreign  specialists,
			   	provide  flight  crews  with  the  opportunity  to  undergo  neceasary  training  in  the
			   	practical  use  of  on-b.oard  weapons.
			   	In  1977,   	airplanes  of  the  Air  National  Guard  also  took  part  in  four  auch  exer-
			   	cises  and,   	in  1978,   	the  crews  of  eight  units  and  subunits  were  already  involved
	 	-		  	in  them.    	For  example,   	eight  A-7D  attack  aircraft  from  the  132d  Tactical			    	-
			   	Fighter  Wing(bes Moines  Airfield,Iowa)  participaCed  in  the  "Red  Flag"  exercises
			   	in  January-February,  eight  F-100  fighters  from  the  138th  Tactical  ~ighter
			   	~roup   	(Tulsa   	Airfield,   	Oklahoma)   	in  March-April,  and  12  F-100's  from  the
			   	122d  Tactical  Fighter  Wing   	(Forti  Wayne  Air  Force  Base,   	Indiana)   	in  June,  and
			   	so  forCh.
			   	According  to  the  appraisal  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force  command,   	the  reservists'  par-
			   	ticipation  in  such  exercises  raises  the  level  of  their  ability  considerably.
			   	The  involvement  of  each  subunit  of  the  Air  NaCional  Guard  in  the  "Red  Flag"
			   	exercises  at  least  once  every  year  and  a  half  is  envisaged  in  the  future  (the
			   	same  standard  has  also  been  established  for  the  regular  Air  Force).
		_		  	Everything  presented  ab.ove  confirms  once  again  that  the  command  of  the  U.S.
			   	Air  Force  is  placing  great  hopes  on  its  reserve  components,   	looking  upon  them
			   	as  a  powerful  means   	to  reinforce  the  combat  capabilities  of  military  aviation
			   	eo  which  an  important  role  has  been  allotted  in  the  aggressive  plans  of
			   	American  imperialism.

	    	~		 	and  gendarm~~,  participated  in  more  than  300  military  and  punitive  operatione
			     	in  various  regions  of  the  world.    	The  aggressive  wars  in  Korea  and  Vietnam,
			    	shooting  at  patriotic  demonstrattons  in  Panama,   	Columbia,  and  Venezuela,  inter-
			    	vention  in  the  Dominican  Republi~--this  is  a  far  from  complete  list  of  ita
			    	bloody  affairs  over  tt?e  last  20  years.    	The  Marines  showed  their  Worth  eapecial-

			    	The  Marines  are  an  arm  of  the  U.S.  Navy  and,  as  noted  by  the  foreign  military
			    	specialists,   	are  specially  trained  for  participation  in  amphibious  operations
			    	and  for  the  conduct  of  combat  actions  together  with  the  ground  forces  as  well

			    	on  ahips    	and  in  the  Navy's  shore  units  and  installati~ons.    	The  total  strength
			    	of  the  regular  U.S.  Marine  Corps  is  now  approximately  192,000  men.
			    	The  U.S.  Marine  Corps  is  headed  by  a  commandant  who  accompli~,~les  leadership

			     	As  is  known,   	the  development  of  the  U.S.  Marines  was  influenced  to  a  certain
			     	exCent  by  the  war  in  VieCnam  where,   	as  reported  by  the  American  presa,   	97  per-

			     	course  of  this  aggressive  war.
	  	-		  	Reports  in  the  foreign  press  indicate  that  in  recent  years  the  Ameri.can  command
			     	is  devoting  considerable  attenCion  to  improving  the  organizational  structure
			     	of  the  control  elements  and  increasing  the  Marines'   	combat  capabilities.    	Tlius,			-
			     	in  the  fall  of  1973  the  biggest  reorganization  of  the  Ma:ine  Corps  headquartere
			     	in  the  last  20  years  was  completed.    	In  1977,   	the  Marine  ground  forces  were				-
			     	reorganized   	(the  organization  and  establishment  structure  of  the  division  and
			     	service  units  was  changed).    	In  the  course  of  the  reorganization  of  the  Fleet
			     	Marine  Force  service  units,  rear  services  g~oups  were  formed.
			     	All  this  permitted  reducing  the  number  of  personnel  in  the  divisions  without		    	-

			     	structure  as  a  whole  which  exisCs  at  present  is  already  obsolete.    	The  United

			     	uniCs  capable  of  conducting  combat  operations  at  any  ti~re  without  substantial
			     	changes  in  their  organiz~tion.
			     	As  one  of  the  versions  of  the  new  organizational  structure  for  the  Marines,

					strategy,  Washington  is  conducting  vast  work  on  modernizing  naval  and  air

				[TexC]    	The  tendency  towards  a  relaxation  in  international  tensione,  which  has
				begun  to  exert  an  influence  on  the  overall  development  of  processes  occurring			 	_
	  	-	    	in  the  world,   	is  a  det~rminant  of  the  contemporary  international  situation.
				This  was  possible  thanks  to  Che  intense  struggle  by  the  Soviet  Union  and  the
				oCher  fraternal  socialist  countries  against  the  forces  of  the  war  and  aggression,
				which  are  not  only  diminishing  at  the  present  time  but  are  also  acquiring  even
				greater  intensity.    	U nder  contemporary  conditions  there  is  no  other  task  more
				important  than  achievement  of  real  disarmament.    	"Stopping  the  arma  race,   	insuring
				a  movement  towards  a  decrease  and,   	in  the  final  analysis,   	elimination  of  the  Chreat
				of  a  thermonuclear  catastrophe,"  CC  CPSU  General  Secretary  and  Chairman  of  the
				USSR  Supreme  Soviet  Presidium  comrade  L.   	I.   	Brezhnev  announced,   	"this   	is  the
				fundamental  problem  now  on  the~agenda  of  our  life."
				There  are,   	however.   	influen~ial  and  well-organized  forces  in  the  world  inCerested
				in  the  arms  race  and  intensifying  the  atmosphere  of  fear  and  enmity.    	They  sow
				doubts  about  the  possibility  to  accomplish  practical  measures  for  the  limitation
				of  arms  and  for  disarmament  and  are  hindering  achievement  of  agreements  in  this
				area.    	Their  activities  have  noticeably  increased  recently.    	"In  the  offensive
				by  imperiaiistic  and  reactionary  forces  against  the  position  won  by  the  people
				in  the  difficult  struggle  for  stable  peace  and  international  security,"  as  stated
				in  the  Declaration  of  the  WarsaW  Pact  states,   	"the  goals  of  aggression,   	revanchism,
				and  hegemony  are  being  pursued."
				The  aggressive  NATO  military-political  bloc    	led  by  the  iJnited  States  has  been
				in  the  vanguard  of  these  forces  for  30  years  now.    	They  represent  now  the  main
				danger  for  peace  and  international  security    	by  advocating  intensification  of  the
				arms  race  and  stepping  up  its  tempos  and  scales.    	All  of  its  activities  irrefutably
				testify  to  the  militaristic  preparations  being  accomplished  in  NATO  at  ever
	  	_	    	increasing  rates.

	    	-		 	They  are  practically  speaking  accomplishing  numerous  measures  for  further
			     	building  up  of  the  power  of  their  armed  forces.    	The  arms  race  in  these  countries

			     	socialist  states  on  limitation  and  reduction  of  troops  and  weapons.    	Moreover,
			     	in  1978  at  President  Carter's  initiative,  decisions  which  presuppose  new  unpre-
			     	cedented  increases   	in  military  preparations  were  made  at  meetings  of  the  bloc~s
			     	governing  organs.
			     	NATO  ruling  circles   	in  their  aggressive  desires  are  now  broadly  employing  the

			    	nepartment  for  these  purposes  was  allocated  more  than  40  billion  dollars~    	The
			    	military  expendiCures  in  the  bloc    	countries   	in  1979  wi11   	increase  even  more.
			    	For  example,   	this  fiscal  year  tihe  Pentagon  received  approximately  130  billion		     	_
			    	dollars,   	and  the  Cotal  miliCary  appropriations   	in  the  FRG  according  to  foreign
	   	-		 	press  reports    	are  at  least  56  billion  marks.
			    	During  the  30  years  that  NATO  has  existed  its  participants  have  spent  for  miliCary

			     	then  are  the  true  records  and  the  sad  result  of  Cheactivities  of  mili~arists  at
			     	the  jubilee  of  the  North  Atlantic  Union.    	During  this  Cime  the  annual  military
			    	expenditures  of  the  NATO  countries  overall  grew  by  a  facCor  of  10.S,  with  those
			    	of  the  bloc's    	European  countries  growing  even  more--by  a  factor  of  15.
			     	Expenditures  for  military  purposes   	in  the  bloc	 	countries  for  the  past  10  years
			     	nas  grown  especially  sharply,   	i~e.,  during  that  period  when  all  people  of  good

			     	the  bloc    	has  existed.
			     	In  future  years,   	as  the  foreign  press  notes,   	the  growth  rates  of  military  expendi-
			     	tures   	in  the  NATO  countries  will  not  decrease,   	since  the  United  States  succeeded

					Personnel  strength  has  been  somewhat  decreased  in  units  and  subunits  ~podrazdeleniye]
					and  they  have  been  significantly  beefed  up  with  conventional  weapons  and  combat
					equipmenC.    	Many  formations  have  been  reorganized  as  armored  formations.    	For
					example,  all  four  divisions   	in  the  British  Army  on  the  Rhine  based  in  the  FRG
					were  recenCly  converted  to  armored  divisions.    	An  artillery  division  has  also		    	-
					been  formed  in  the  BAOR.
					A  sign ificant  reinforcement  of  the  combat  complement  of  the  ground  forces  is
					expected  in  the  U nited  States  and  France.    	The  foreign  press  reports  that  three
					new  formations  are  being  formed  in    	the  American  Army  and,   	in  addition,   	tests
					of  a  new  arganization  of  the  armored  and  mechanized  division,   	in  which  the  num-

					are  continuing.    	In  1978  the  number  of  American  troops  based  in  the  FRG  increased	   	-
					by  8,000  persor.s.    	Their  deployment  in  the  northern  portion  of  the  country  is

			  	by  1985  to  expend  at  least  40  billion  marks   	for  the  purchase  of  new  weapons.
			  	Thus,   	the  armed  forces  will  obtain  1,800  Leopard-2  ~anks,   	432  Gepard  self-

	  	_			staff  exercises.    	Just  as  before,   	they  took  place   	ir.~  various  zones  of  Western

			   	areas  close  to  the  borders  of  the  socialist  counCries.    	Even  official  tepresenta-
			   	tives  of  the  West  German  GovernmenC  were  forced   	to  recognize   	thaC  these  exercises
	  	-			were  the  largFSt  conducted   	in  this  parC  of  Europe   	in  the  postwar  years~    	The
			   	western  press  reports  that   	participants   	included  more  than  320,000  men,   	5,000
	  	-			tanks,   	up  to  2,700  combat  aircraft,   	a  large  number  of  armored  personnel  c arriers,
			   	as  well  as  approximately  300  different  ships.    	During  the  exercises,   	~s   	foreign
	  	_			press  reports  noted,   	realistic  plans  for  conducting  combat  operaCions  using  both
	  	_			conventional  and  nuclear  weapons  were  exercised.    	This  was  all  done  from  an
	   	_		 	inCegrated  concept  and  on  a  patently  anti-Soviet,   	anticommunisC  background.
			   	During  the  Reforger-10  maneuvers  subunits  from  several  formations,  whos?   	per-
	  	_			sonnel  previously  had  not  transferred  to  Europe  (the  9t.h  Infantry  Division  at~~l

	   	,			During  the  Bold  Guard-78  exercise   	in  the  Baltic  Straits  area,   	a  brigade  of  U~S.
			   	Marines  participated  for  the  first  time.    	The  bloc's    	largest  exercise  in  history,
			   	Northern  Wedding-78,   	was   	conducted  in  the  East  Atlantic  and   	in  the  English  Channel
			   	and  it   	involved  the  armed  forces  of  10  NATO  co~intries.    	The  bloc    	militarists
			   	also  greeted  1979  with  a  new  rattle  of  weapons~    	for  the  first  time  in  Che   	past
			   	five  years,  reforger  maneuvers  were  conducted  under  winter  conditions.
			   	All  of  these  militaristic  demonstrations,   	jusC  as  before,   	were  conducted  near
			   	the  border  of  the  socialist  states,  had  a  patently  provocatory  nature,   	and  were
			   	intended  to  create  a  situation  of  fear  and  to  exacerbate  international  tensions.
			   	From  the  far  from  complete  list  of  NATO  military  prep~rations  enumerated  above
			   	it   	is  clearly  evident  that  this  bloc    	is  now  the  most  aggressive  grouping   	in				=
			   	the  capitalistic  world,   	whose  activities  are  pri.marily     	direcCed  against   	the
			   	fraternal  socialist  states.    	All  this  requires  that  Soviet  troops  and  troops

			  	In  official  U.S.   	and  NATO  documents  this  covert  type  of  combat  operation  involving

			  	craft  and  ships  af  the  basic  classes  that  have  been  ~quipp~d  uith  a  significant
			  	amount  of  REC  equipnent.
			  	Acrording  to  the  vieWS  of  American  military  specialiats,  REC  is  divided   	into
			  	three  basic  types=    	radio  technical  reconnaissance,    	radioelectronic  suppression
			  	(REP)s'~,  and  radio~lectronic  counter-countermeasures  (protecting  one's  o~n  means
			  	agatnst  enemy  ~CM).
			  	~tadio  technical  reconnaissance,   	as  a  rule,   	is  conducted  using  special  equipment
			  	and  envisions  the  search,   	intercept,   	identification,   	analysis,   	and  dete nnination
			  	of  target  location.    	It  is  considered  that  electromagnetic  emissions  carry  infor-
			  	mation  uhich  makes   	it  possible  to  hide  the  organization  af  control  over  enemy
			  	troops  and  various  Weapons  systems.    	For  this,   	all  data  concernirig  targets  aith
			  	their  specific  characteristics  are  transmitted  tv  formation  (field  force)
			  	[nb"yedineniye]  coordinating  centers,  uhere  decisions  are  made  about  subsequent
			  	actions.
			  	Radioelectronic  suppression  is  designed  to  forestall  or  hinder  the  operation  of
			  	en~ny  electronic  resources  through  emission,   	reflection,  or  re-radiation  of
			  	electromagnetic,   	acoustical,  and  infrared  signals.    	The  main  advantages  of  this
			  	type  of  REC  (as  opposed  to  destruction  by  fire)  are  the  practically  instantaneous
			  	retargeting,  sitnultaneous  effect  on  a  number  of  targets  Working  on  identical  or
			  	sufficiently  close  frequencies,   	and  great  range.    	The  arsenal  of  modern  m~ans
			  	for  such  suppression  is  sufficiently  large--ranging  fran  complex  automated  land-
			  	based  (Fig.   	1),   	shipboard,  and  airborne  (Fig.   	2)  [no  figures  reproduced  in  this
			  	~    	In  several  foreign  soeirces  this  type  of  REC  is  called  electronic  suppression--

	 	_	     	influpnc~  af  one's  own  radioelecCronic  equipnenC  on  other  friendly  equipnent.
				American  specialists  consider  that  when  conducting  R~C  one  must  take   	ittto
				account  target  function=    	are  they  functioning  within  a  communications  system
				or  do  Chey  serve  ~o  conCrol  various  weapons  types?    	In  their  opinion,   	for  example,
				radio  reconnaissance  missions  are  more   	important  than  suppression  missions  because
				it   	is  necessary  Co  organize  R~C  against  enemy  communications  means  in  such  a  way
				that  there  is  no  degradation  in  efficiency  of  intercepting  information  transmitted
				by  the  enemy  via  radio  coramunications  mEans.    	According  to  the  U.S.  evaluation,
		     	means  of  suppressing  various  weapons  types  (in  opposition  to  targets  used  in  a
				communicaCions  system)  should  silnultaneously  be  both  reconnoiterred  and  suppressed.
				This  circumstance  stipulates  distribution  of  missions  among  special  units  and
				subunits.    	Thus,  REC  in  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces  against  radar,  radio  navigational,
				and  other  enemy  targets  is  accomplished  by  special  corps  and  division  units  (sub-			_
		     	units)  and  by  combat  ships  and  aircraft.    	REC  against  communfcations  targets   	is
				accomplished  by  unit  resources  wiChin  the  armed  forces  component  security  services.

		     	comnanders  in  such  a  way  that  this  will  not  degrade  Lheir  oan  :~ccomplishment  of
				the  basic  mission--accomplishing  radio  reconnaissance.
		     	As  emphasized  in  the  American  military  press,   	army  and  air  force  REC  resources
		     	during  combat  operations  will  accomplish  support  to  combat  formations  by  supply-
				ing  ECM  against  troop  command  and  control  systems  and  against  Weapons  Which  have

	   	-		  	to  bloc    	subordination  in  a  crisis  situation.    	In  the  opinion  of  NATO  military
			     	specialistis,  measures  to  modernize  and  furCher  develop  the  NICS  (NATO  Integrated
			     	Communications  System),   	the  beginnings  of  Which  date  back  more  than  20  years,
			     	musC  play  the  chief  role  in  improving  the  effectiveness  and  reliability  of
			     	command  and  control~.
			     	From  the  moment  NATO  Was  founded  in  1949  until  the  late  1950's  all  bloc
			     	military  command  and  control  elements  Were~completely  independent  and  intended
			     	to  support  the  communications  of  the  main  NATO  comnand  elements  in  the  TVD
			     	(theaters  of  military  operations]  (independent  of  each  other~  with  subordinate
			     	troop  conCingents  allocated  by  participating  nations  to  bloc    	subordination.
			     	These  communications  in  the  most  part  were  accomplished  via  the  telephone  and
			     	telegraph  lines  of  the  national  post  and  telegraph  ministries.
			     	In  1957  the  NATO  Armed  Forces  Staff  in  Europe  recognized  the  advisability  of
			     	creating  an  effective  integrated  automated  communications  system  Which  would
			     	aupply  all  comaiand  and  conCrol  links  With  the  requisite  data  for  rapid  decision

			     	tional  situation.
			     	As  a  result  of  ineasures  taken  NATO  by  1970  had  several  extant  communications
			     	and  control  systems,   	the  most  significant  being  the  ACE  High  tropospheric
			     	communication  system  linking  the  northern  extremity  of  Norway  via  Great  Britain,

			    	to  create  a  modern  communication  system  mor~  completely  responding  tio  ies
			    	aggressiv~  desires.    	The  basic  idea  of  these  concepts  was  to  form  an  intef;rated

			    	graph  communications  systems  of  the  NATO  counCry  armed  forces  ~nd  primarily

			    	and  the  NATO  Armed  F'orces  radio  and  radio  relay  communications  neCs.    	The  so-
			    	called  principle  of  "netting"  formed  Che  foundation  of  iCs  layout.    	It  is  a
			    	matter  whereby  Che  elemenCs  of  the  communications  and  command  and  control  system
			    	do  not  form  an  organizational  and  regulaCion  Croop  uniC  structure,   	but  are  com-	     	-
			     	pleCely  independenC  elements.    	The  communications  centers  for  subunit  [podraz-

			     	trol  points  can  be  linked  into  a  sysCem  as  separate  correspondents.    	This
			     	structural  principle,   	according  to  foreign  miliCary  specialists,  makes  it
			     	independenC  of  the  troop  unit  combat  formation  and  of  its  complement,   	in  so
			     	doing  increasing  its  mobility,   	survivability,   	and  reliability.    	It  is  also
			     	considered  that,   	in  this  instance,   	there  is  an  increased  capability  of  maneuver-
			     	ing  communications  channels  and  insuring  the  priorLty  of  its  establishment  by
			     	the  higher  command  element  link  in  comparison  with  a  normal  hierarchal  struc-
			     	ture  (i.e.,   	subordination  from  below  up~+ards).    	This  system  was  called  NICS.

			    	up  to  5,000  correspondents  from  among  the  military  leadership  of  bloc  par-
			     	ticipating  countries.    	The  intent  was  to  begin  work  to  improve  satellite
			     	communications  subsystems  in  1978.    	Their  basic  purpose  is  to  support  the
			     	conversion  to  digital  methods  of  transmitting  data.    	Therefore,   	extant  ground-
			     	based  saCellite  monitoring  stations  are  bei.ng  modernized.
			    	The  plan  by  the  mid-1980's   	is  to  complete  the  conversion  to  digit~l  transmission
			    	methods,   	to  create  switching  centers  with  high  capacity  (in  excess  of  6,000
			    	correspondents)  with  electronic  commutators,   	introduce  encryption  devices
			     	at  all  command  and  contrci  links,   	increase  the  capacity  of  tropospheric
			    	communications  mainlines  (up  to  70-120  telephone  channels),   	and  to  modernize
			     	the  satellite  communications  system.    	Judging  by  foreign  press  reports,   	the
			    	complex  of  ground-based  communications  satellite  stations  and  the  SATCOM-3B
			    	existing  at  the  present  time  now  provide  for  transmission  of  more  than  one-third
			    	of  the  information  passing  through  NICS  channels.    	It  is  anticipated  that  the
			    	satellite  coimnunicaCions  subsystem  will  support  up  to  50  percent  of  the  infor-
			    	mation  exchange  supporting  the  bloc's  highest  command  element  when  the  second		    	-
			    	sxage  of  its  creation  is  completed.
			    	It  is  also  noted  that  the  leaders  of  several  West  European  states  arE  :..pposed

			   	(approximately  1.9  billion  dollars),   	as  well  as  the  great  experiditures  invalved
			   	with  their  operation  over  an  extended  Cime  (estimated  service  Cime  for  the  air-
			   	craft  is  20  years).
			  	Great  Britain  is  not  participating  in  the  purchase  of  the  E-3A  and  support
			   	expenditures  since  it  is  developing  the  Nimrod  AEW  2,   	its  own  long-range  radar

			  	LText~    	Aircraft  carriers  are  a  vital  means  of  imperialistic  circles  to
			  	accomplish  aggression  and  expansion  in  wartime,   	as  well  as  for  a  show  of
			  	force  in  peacetime.    	As  the  foreign  press  notes,   	thanks  to  their  high  mobility
			  	they  can  su pport  rapid  employment  of  carrier-based  aviation  in  any  area  of  the
			  	World  Ocean.    	However,   	accomplishment  of  the  missions  with  which  they  are  tasked
			  	to  a  significant  degree  will  depend  upon  the  professional  training  of  the  flying
			  	personnel  and  their  skills  and  ability  to  fly  from  the  ship's  deck.    	Foreign
	    	-	    	military  specialists  underscore  that  these  flights  have  characteristic  special
			   	features   	inherent  only  a~  carrier  aviation.    	An  aircraft  carrier  is  a  mobile
			   	airfield  wiCh  all  the  requisite  means  of  sup~orting  deck  aircraft  and  helicop-
			   	ters  of  various  types.    	It  does  not  have  a  constant  aircraft  takeoff  and  land-
			   	ing  direction  and   	is  subject  to  rolling.    	The  dimensions  of  its  flight  deck,
			   	hangars,   	aircraft  elevators,  and  other  support  spaces  exert  a  special  influence
			  	on  the  organization  of  siting,  repair,   	preparations,  and  accomplishment  of
			   	flights.
			   	The  commander  of  the  aviation  department  controls  carrier  aviation  flights
			   	(in  a  rad ius  of  5-6  km),   	the  air  traffic  control  center  (TsUVD--ATCC  in  a  radius
			   	of  90-100  km),   	and  the  combat  information  center  (BITs--CIC,   	in  a  radius  exceed-
			   	ing  100  km).																			 	~
			   	Carrier  takeoffs  are  made  with  the  help  of  catapults  which  propel  the  vehicle
			   	at  a  speed  of  260-300  km  per  hour  within  two  seconds.    	This  speed  allows  the
			   	aircraft  to take  off  Practically  speaking  while  the  carrier  is  underway  at  any
			   	wind  speeds.    	Modern  American  aircraft  carriers  are  equipped  with  four  steam
			   	catapults  capable  during  the  daytime  to  sequentially  launch  aircraft  ~~t  15-second		 	_
			   	intervals.
			   	The  most  complex  and  important  stage  of  the  flight,   	according  to     	foreign  press		 	`
			   	informat~on,   	is  the  landing  approach  and  the  landing  of  the  aircraft  on  the  deck.

			     	following  modesi    	automatic,  semiautomatic,  (piloting  using  the  system  indicatnr),
			     	and  manual  (�rom  commands  given  by  Che  landing  radar  operator)~    	The  basis
			     	of  Che  system  (it  includes   	a  shipboard  and  an  aircraft  set)   	are  the  AN/SPN-10
			     	shipboard  landing  radar  and  the  -42  air  Craffic  control  radar~
			     	Landings   	in  good  weather  are  done  visually  using  the  lighC-assisted  system.
			     	It  is  installed  on  a  stabilized  platform  (Figure  1)  [figures   	in  this  article
			     	not  reproduced]  extending  beyond  Che  port  side  of  the  aircraft  carrier.    	The
			     	optical  unit  is  the  main  portion  of  the  system  and  consisCs  of  f ive  lens  secCions
			     	located  one  above  Che  other  in  the   	platiform  center.    	The  three  middle  sections
			     	emit  a  coristant  yellow  li~ht  which  is  converted  by  a  special  device   	into  a
			     	single  yellow  beam  direcCeci  along  the  glide  path  (at  an  angle  of  3.5-4  degrees).	     	-
			     	Above  Chese  sections  is  a  constant  white   	light  and  a  blinking  red  light   	is
			     	positioned  below.    	Horizontal  blinking  landing  permission  lights  (two  each)			 	-
			     	and  vertical  wave-off  red  lights  (five  each)  are  located  on  both  sides  of  the
			     	optical  unit.    	Right  and  left  of  the  latter  on  the  same  level  with  the  central
			     	section  of  rhe  optical  unit  are  six  constant  green  so-called  reference  lighCs.
			     	When  the  aircraft  on  the  landing  approach  is  within  the  glide  path  beam,   	the
			     	pilot  sees   	the  yellow  and  reference  green  lights.    	Maintaining  them  on  the  same
			     	level  permits  an  accurate  landing  on  Che  carrier  (the  third  arresting  cable  will
			     	be  engaged).    	If  the  aircraft  is  above  the  glide  path,   	the  yellow  light  will  be
			     	above  the  reference  lights,   	and  if  he  is   	below  trie  glide  path,   	it  will  be  below
			     	the  reference  lights.    	In  these  instances,   	the  aircraft  landing  hook  will  engage
			     	the  fourth  or  first  (second)  arresting  cable.    	If  the  pilot  observes  a  white		     	-
			     	steady  or  red  blinking  light  above  or  below  the  reference  lights,   	this  means
			     	that  he  must  go  around  again.    	The  lights  are  visible  during  the  day  from  1.5-2  km
			     	and  from  3-4  km  at  night.
			    	The  landing  television  monitoring  system  is  an  important   	element   	in  aircraft
			    	flight  safety.    	It  consists  of  four  television  cameras  located  in  various  posi-
	   	.		  	tions  on  the  flight  deck  and  provides  the  air  boss  with  the  capability  to  addi-
			    	tionally  monitor  the   	landing  and  record  it  on  video  tape.
			    	At  the  f inal  stage  of  tht  landing  approach  when  the  aircraft   	is  following  the
	   	_		  	glide  path  beam,   	the  wave-off  officer  assists  in  forestalling  possible  pilot
			    	errors.
			    	As  the  foreign  press  reports,   	aircraft  returning  from  a  mission  in  bad  weather
			    	are  assigned  a  waiting  zone   	in  which  they  fly  in  a  circle  at  assigned  altitudes
	  	-		 	(average  duration  six  minutes),   	crossing  a  control  point  each  ti.me  (Figure  2).
			    	At  the  estimated  time  or  upon  the  command  of  the  ATCC,   	pilots  begin  a  descent
			    	at  an  interval  of  one  minute.    	Flight  direction  to  the  carrier  is  controlled

			    	movement,   	the  aircrafC  disperse  and  fly  a  box  landing  pa~tern  (Figure  3).
			    	The  commander  of  the  aviaCion  deparCmenC  controls  the  pattern  during  the  day-
			    	time  and  the  ATCC  does  so  at  night.

			     	is  6-7  km  and  a  left  box  paCtern  is  employed.
			    	~ox  patterns  make  up  a  significant  portion  of  planned  flights  during  combat

			    	for  example,   	reached  45   	landings  per  hour  aboard  "Enterprise."
			    	Arresting  cables  and  emergency  barriers  (in  the  event  of  an  emergency  landing)
			    	are  used  as  aircraft  are  landing  on  the  carrier.    	The  arresting  gear  is  a  device

			     	per  hour  (braking  time   	is  2.5-3  seconds,   	landing  roll  90  meters).     	It  consists

			 	[Text]    	Stepping  up  the  preparaCion  of  naval  forces  fur  war,   	the  military-
	  	_	    	political  leadership  of  the  aggressive  NATO  bloc  places  special  significance			  	-
			 	on  studying   	the  World  Ocean.
	  	"	    	As  the  foreign  press  reports,  basic  efforts  in  oceanographic  research  conducted
			 	in  accordance  aith  both  national  as  Well  as  joint  (international)  programs  are		  	'
			 	directed  towards   	insuring  the  effective  combaC  employmenC  of  modern  and  per-
			 	spective  naval  aeapons  systems  (ballistic  and  cruise  missil~s,   	rocket-assisted
			 	torpedoes  and  torpedoes,   	aircraft,   	helicopters,  and  others),   	conducting  ASW
			 	and  minesweeping,   	and  the  navigational  safety  of  ships  and  vessels.
			 	Special  attention  is  devoted  to  the  improvement  and  develo pnent  of  long-range		    	~
			 	submarine  detection  systems.    	For  this  purpose  a  complex  of  research  is  underi+ay	     	~
			 	in  the  regions  of  ASW  barriers  directed  toWards  elaboration  of  an  acoustic  model
			 	of  Che  ocean  and  creation  of  a  systesn  for  operational  forecastir.g  of  the  state
			 	of  the  water  medium.
			 	Noted  in  the  foreign  press  is  a  continual  grosrth  in  NATO  nation  participation
			 	and  integrated  research  of  the  ocean  carried  out  by  multipurpose  scientif ic
			 	research  vessels   	in  regions  most  important  in  the  military  sense.
			 	The  command  element  of  the  NATO  navies  also  places  serious  attention  on  the
			 	quantitative  and  qualitative  develo pnent  of  oceanographic  equipment,  as  the
			 	large  volume  of  appropriations  testifies.    	Between  1972-1977  the  United  States
			 	spent  up  to  34  percent  of  its  total  amount  of  capital  investments  for  oceano-
			 	graphic  programs  a~nd  other  NATO  countries  spent  21-23  percent  for  its  creation
			 	and  improvement.
			 	The  coincident   	interests  of  the  largest  firms  in  the  military-industrial  com-
			 	plex  and  oil  monopolies  of  the  NATO  countries  to  a  significant  degree  facilitate
	   	-	    	the  increase  in  the  rates  of  development  of  ineans  for  studying  the  ocean  and		     	�
