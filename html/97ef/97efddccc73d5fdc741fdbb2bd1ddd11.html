 Developments in connection with Khrushchev's visit
 to Peiping for the tenth anniversary of the Chinese regime
 suggest that differences in views on foreign policy tac-
 tics and ideological matters remain as irritants in the
 Sino-Soviet relationship. The Chinese have publicly
 hailed Khrushchev's visit to the United States and his
 disarmament proposals.   However, they apparently have
 reservations about the longterm effects of the USSR's
 present posture toward the United States.   The Chinese
 also strongly reaffirm Peiping's position that the commune
 will be China's basic social unit after "entering Commu-
 nism," despite the Soviet statement that the commune is
 "impossible" in the future Communist society.   Present
 Chinese propaganda acknowledging dependence on the Sino-
 Soviet alliance, however, reflects Peiping's desire to
 avoid a showdown with Moscow.

 The situation in Laos continues to be characterized

 country and by Communist propaganda and recruitment activ-

 the monsoon rains now are subsiding.   Most delegates of
 the UN subcommittee, having completed a limited field

 Increased factional strife and a wave of arrests of

 between the UAR and Sudan on sharing the Nile waters are
 scheduled to begin on 10 October; prospects for agreement
 are not bright.   The Imam of Yemen, who has reestablished
 his dominant political position, now faces a financial

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 EAST GERMANY CELEBRATES TENTH ANNIVERSARY   .  .       .  .  .  .   Page 1
 The East German regime, celebrating its tenth year
 in power, is using the occasion to emphasize its claim to
 status as a full-fledged sovereign state.   The Communists,
 pointing to their equal representation with West Germany
 at the Geneva conference, contend that a turning point
 has been reached in the struggle.to reverse the West's
 policy of nonrecognition.   Soviet Deputy Premier Kozlov
 declared in a speech that the West German doctrine that
 no country other than the USSR having diplomatic relations
 with East Germany shall be recognized by Bonn is beginning
 to crumble.  The East Germans punctuated their claim to
 sovereignty by unfurling a new national flag over the ele-
 vated rail installations they control in West Berlin.
 BRITAIN' RECEPTIVE TO INCREASING EAST GERMAN VISITS  .  .  .  .   Page 2
 London has been generally receptive to the growing
 number of East German officials visiting the United King-
 dom to promote the Ulbricht regime's prestige.  During the
 election campaign the British Government was especially
 sensitive to Allied efforts to discourage such travel.
 Britain's policy of furthering contacts with East Germany
 will be an additional factor clouding relations with Bonn.
 ALGERIA-FRANCE  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 2
 A resurgence of extremist activity by European set-
 tlers in Algiers has followed De Gaulle's proposals for
 Algerian self-determination.   The settlers fear eventual
 loss of power and reprisals from the Moslem population.
 Rightist opposition will probably attempt to make itself
 felt in the French Parliament, which reconvened on 6 October,
 but no serious threat to the Debra government is likely.
 In Tunis, Algerian rebel leaders appear to be awaiting
 world reactions to their reply to De Gaulle and are sensi-
 tive to any suggestion that their attitude foreshadows a
 capitulation.

 DISARMAMENT - 14TH UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY .               .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 5
 With five separate disarmament items on its agenda,
 the UN General Assembly will give precedence to the new
 ten-nation disarmament forum.  Debate will be long-drawn-
 out,                     particularly during assembly discussion of the USSR's
 call for "complete and general disarmament."   The Soviet
 proposal and the other disarmament items will probably  e
 referred to the ten--nation group for study.
 BELGIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .       .   Page 5
 The Belgian Government may be faced with a treasury
 crisis which could bring down the Social Christian - Lib-
 eral coalition,   While a longterm loan from the Belgian
 National Bank might stave off the crisis, the bank opposes
 such a move on the grounds that the solution to periodic
 budget deficits is higher taxation--?a course strongly op-
 posed by important elements in the coalition government.
 NEW HUNGARIAN FIVE-YEAR PLAN (1961--65)  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 6
 Hungary's economic plan for 1961-65 calls for a
 65-70 percent increase in industrial output over 1958 and
 a 30-32 percent rise in agricultural production over the
 1954-58 average.  A respectable rise in per capita real
 income is also promised.   While targets are generally
 realistic,   not all programs are likely to be completed on
 schedule because of competition for investment resources,
 difficulties in raising labor productivity,  and problems
 in meeting agricultural targets.   Some revisions of indi-
 vidual goals probably will prove necessary before the end
 of the plan period.
 RELATIONS BETWEEN CAIRO AND PEIPING DETERIORATE   .  ,  ,  .  .   Page 8
 In providing expatriate Syrian Communist leader
 Khalid Bakdash a forum from which to denounce Nasir,
 Peiping has shown it will support Mic?d.le Eastern Commu -?
 nists despite the increased frictions with the UAR such
 a policy was bound to bring.   Nasir has recalled the UAR
 charge and sent a stiff protest to Peiping.   The Chinese,
 convinced that Nasir is trying to undermine   2eiping's
 standing with the Afro-Asian neutrals,  have not yet re-
 plied to bitter UAR press attacks.

 TIBETAN BORDER PROBLEMS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page   9
 Nepal and Pakistan,    as well as India, are showing
 increasing concern over their border problems with Commu-
 nist China.   Nehru's recent letter to Chou En --lai insisting
 on Chinese evacuation of Longju and other border outposts
 probably will result in an impasse in the Sino?-Indian
 dispute.   Nepal has taken the initiative and requested
 the Chinese to "clarify" their stand on the Nepalese-Ti-
 betan border.   Pakistan has sent troop reinforcements to
 its frontier areas adjacent to Sinkiang,
 INDIAN LEADERS PLAN TO SPLIT BOMBAY STATE   .
 .   Page 10
 Prime Minister Nehru and other Congress party leaders
 have reversed their stand and now are planning to partition
 Bombay State,  India's largest,  probably in April 1960,  to
 forestall an outbreak of violent agitation by linguistic
 groups which have long advocated partition.   Such agitation
 could seriously threaten the Congress party's control of
 Bombay,   Partition would create many problems, but should
 enable the Congress to recover some of its strength in
 Bombay by depriving opposition groups of their most im-
 portant issue.
 SUKARNO AND THE INDONESIAN ARMY   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 12
 President Sukarno has recently demonstrated a renewed
 concern to balance the army's influence in government by
 making concessions to Communist and other leftist politi-
 cal forces.   Rumors of an impending army cou   undoubted)
 have played a part in Sukarno's uneasiness.

 Leaders of the Federation of Mali, made up of the
 autonomous French Community republics of Senegal and
 Soudan,   have begun to implement their local political
 commitment to gain juridical independence for Mali at an
 early date.   They intend to keep this West African area
 within the Paris-subsidized Community, which they hope
 will be altered so as to include a multinational confeder-
 ation.   De Gaulle, with his recent emphasis on the Com-
 munity's "evolutional character," seems to have accepted
 in principle the Mali leaders'  cautious approach.                           25X1

 Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Repub-

 at any time since he came to power in 1930.      The Dominican
 people, who had become accustomed to the prosperity which
 Trujillo brought them, now are restless under the economic
 hardships caused by heavy military expenditures during the
 past year.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 EXPANSION OF SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN THE ANTARCTIC   .  .  .  .  .   Page
 The USSR, with bloc participation, is stepping up
 its already extensive operations in the Antarctic.   Recent
 announcements indicate that the fifth Soviet expedition--
 which will include East German and possibly Chinese Com-
 munist personnel--will seek to establish three new tem.
 porary stations, make another attempt to land a party in
 western Antarctica, and try to complete a trans-Antarctic
 glaciological traverse by mid-1960.   Long-range Soviet
 plans for Antarctic activity apparently call for increased
 whaling operations,  the use of the atomic icebreaker Lenin,
 and the inauguration of nonstop air service from the USSR.
 ULBRICHT REGIME PLANS TRANSFORMATION OF EAST BERLIN   .  .  .   Page   4
 In connection with East Germany's tenth anniversary
 on 7 October,  the Ulbricht regime is publicizing ambitious
 plans to transform East Berlin into a showplace of German
 "socialist culture" and a suitable "national" capital to
 rival West Berlin.   The program, which forms part of East
 Germany's Seven-Year Plan for 1959-65, is also designed
 to demonstrate the regime's determination not to permit
 East Berlin to become a part of any "free city" of Berlin.
 Unless East Germany's financial stringencies can be solved
 and its uninspired building methods improved, however,
 the new city is likely to be as shoddy as the notorious
 Stalinallee housing development.

 Since 6 March 1957, when Ghana became independent,
 Prime Minister Nkrumah's regime has made considerable prog-
 ress in consolidating its power at home and in expanding
 its influence.  Domestic opposition has been largely
 stifled and internal stability secured, the economy has
 been kept on an even keel, a neutralist course not un-
 friendly to the West has been charted, and Accra has
 become a focal point of militant pan-Africanism.   The
 regime has become increasingly more authoritarian, however,
 and basic weaknesses are already impeding the progress of
 this "model" new African state.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 October 1959
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 SINO-SOVIET 'RELATIONS IN THE LIGHT
 Developments in connec-
 tion with Khrushchev's visit
 to Peiping for the tenth anni-
 versary celebration of the
 Chinese regime suggest that
 differences in views on for-
 eign policy tactics, methods
 of "socialist construction,"
 and ideological matters remain
 as irritants in the Sino-So-
 viet relationship.   Mao  and
 Khrushchev, who held several
 days of well-publicized talks
 during the visit, failed to
 issue the customary joint com-
 muniqud.   It seems probable
 that their views differed  so
 much that compromise language
 could not be agreed upon.
 While Peiping is apparent-
 ly willing to publicly endorse
 Khrushchev's visit to the  US
 and his disarmament proposals,
 its foreign and domestic  pol-
 icies apparently require it to
 maintain that the threat  of
 American "aggression" remains,
 In contrast to Soviet state-
 ments, Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi--in a special article writ-
 ten for Izvestia for the Chi-
 nese anniversary--complained
 that "so far" the United States
 has not "repudiated its policy
 of aggression and war," as wit-
 nessed by its "continuation"
 of the cold war, continued con-
 struction of foreign military
 bases, "active" rearmament of
 Japan, and "continuing occupa-
 tion of Taiwan."
 OF PEIPING'S TENTH ANNIVERSARY
 The Chinese leaders ap-
 parcntly view their policy to-
 ward the United States as re-
 quiring tactics significantly
 different from those now being
 pursued by Khrushchev,   That

 American imperialism in order
 to achieve the relaxation  of
 international tension."
 The Chinese are apprehen-
 sive that friendlier US-USSR
 relations will prove detrimen
 talto their interests,  which
 are opposed to the maintenance
 of the status quo in the Far
 East.   On the Taiwan and Lao-
 tian issues, the Chinese have
 directed their principal in-
 vective against the  United
 States as the "aggressor," ap-
 parently in the belief that
 consistent opposition to Amer-
 ican policy will eventually
 lead to a reduction of American
 influence in the area.   This
 line probably is also useful
 in Peiping's domestic program,
 as the Chinese have stated that
 "face to face with the American
 aggressor, the Chinese people
 are forced to intensify  their
 work wnd build economically
 backward China into an advanced,
 industrialized, and socialist
 power."
 Khrushchev's failure dur-
 ing the celebrations in Pei-
 ping to support publicly  the
 Chinese on the specific issue
 of Taiwan reflects his desire
 to avoid issues which run
 counter to his posture of peace-
 ful coexistence with the United
 States.   This silence, however,
 does not imply repudiation of
 Moscow's commitment in September
 1958 that any attack on Commu-
 nist China would be regarded as
 an attack on the USSR.
 The Chinese leaders  ap-
 parently felt the need at  a
 major regime celebration to
 reaffirm their long-term ob-
 jectives toward the offshore
 islands and Taiwan.   Peiping,
 however, has shown no disposi-
 tion to develop the "liberate
 Taiwan" theme into a  major
 propaganda campaign for  the
 present.   Present Chinese
 statements speak of "liberat-
 ing" Taiwan "in one way                                                             or
 another," but imply no sense
 of urgency.
 Despite the difference in
 Sino-Soviet  views,   Chinese
 statements during Khrushchev's
 visit suggest that the Chinese
 are aware of their dependence
 on the USSR and do not wish to
 push present differences to the
 point of impairing the alliance.
 An editorial in People's Daily
 on 3 October stated  that  the
 Chinese people  regard  the
 steady strengthening of  their
 unity with the USSR,   "their
 great ally," as an important
 guarantee of the "prosperity
 and strength of their country
 as well as their sacred inter-
 national duty."
 Central committee Secre-
 tary General Teng Hsiao-ping,
 in an anniversary article for
 Pravda, revived Mao's own for-
 mulation on the leadership po-
 sition of the Soviet Communist
 party as well as the  Soviet
 Government.   Teng stated that
 "the unity of the socialist
 camp headed by the Soviet
 Union, and the unity of the"in-
 ternational Communist movement
 with the Communist party of the
 Soviet Union at its center,
 form the core of even more ex-
 tensive international  unity."
 Khrushchev's failure  to
 endorse the communes  and eco-
 nomic policies connected with
 Peiping's "leap forward" shows
 that the two leaders were un-
 able to find  a  formula                                                                to
 bridge their differences     and
 that these issues will continue
 to harass Sino-Soviet relations.

 "impossible" in the future Com-
 munist society.
 The Chinese leaders, how-
 ever, appear deeply committed
 to the concept and, in the face
 of Soviet and domestic opposi-
 tion,   are  insisting  on  the
 "superiority"  of  the communes
 over the former cooperatives,
 Government chairman Liu Shao-
 chi and Teng Hsiao-ping have
 recently stated that the com-
 mune will be the best form of
 social  organization  for  the
 future "gradual transition to
 the Communist society."
 As in previous Sino-Soviet
 ideological differences over
 the past 10 years, the Chinese
 are again indicating their de-
 termination to manipulate ide-
 ology  for  domestic  purposes
 and in order to increase their
 prestige as a "creative" Marx-
 ist party,   Liu Shao-chi stated
 in his anniversary article for
 the October issue of the bloc's
 theoretical journal,   Problems
 of Peace and Socialism,   that
 although "revolution and con-
 struction  in  China                                                                    have fea-

 it is also "possible that some
 of these important special fea-
 tures may reappear in some other
 countries."  Liu concluded,  "In
 this sense, Chinese experience
 is to a certain degree of in-
 ternational significance."
 Liu  avoided  Sa.y ,ng . that
 the communes and the "leap for-
 ward" policy were what he had
 in mind, but he apparently felt
 that his readers could easily
 draw  their  own  conclusions.

 SITUATION IN LAOS
 The situation in Laos con-

 small-scale skirmishes at wide-
 ly scattered points throughout
 the country and by Communist
 propaganda and recruitment ac-

 Such activity may increase, as
 the monsoon rains are now sub-

 In Sam Neua Province, the
 Laotian Army is attempting to
 retake ground lost in the 30

 success is unclear.

 Muong Het, at least, is
 again definitely in enemy hands.
 In the western corner of the
 province,  a  Communist  force
 which for some weeks has been
 threatening the government posi-
 tion at Muong Son is reported
 to have begun an attempt to
 take the post.
 In southern Laos, reports
 persist of the presence there

 assassinate Prime Minister
 Qasim.     Baghdad has remained
 quiet, with special security
 precautions quickly taken by
 the government, army, and police.
 The assassination attempt
 was   made  on  -7  October
 while Qasim was being driven
 along Rashid Street in down-
 town Baghdad. The identity of
 his assailant is unknown; gov-
 ernment releases have described
 the attacker only as "a sinful
 hand" and have not said whether
 or not he was apprehended.
 The official medical bul-
 letins describe Qasim's condi-
 tion as "good" and calling for
 "no anxiety."  They say he was
 struck by three bullets in non-
 vital parts of the body and suf-
 fered only a flesh wound and a
 fractured shoulder. Qasim is re-
 ported to have emerged from the
 hospital where he was taken for
 treatment to show himself to
 Iraqi crowds and reassure them,
 and, a few hours after the
 shooting, Radio Baghdad broad-
 cast a short recorded Qasim
 speech calling for calm and
 unity.   Qasim, as a martyr who
 nearly gave his life in "doing
 his duty for the Iraqi people,"
 appealed for support from all
 Iraqis.
 Military Governor and Army
 Chief of Staff Abdi,
 as
 issued the government's bulletins
 on the prime minister's condi-
 tion and the decrees establish-
 ing a curfew in Baghdad and its
 suburbs and prohibiting any
 gatherings or demonstrations
 anywhere in Iraq. At the moment,
 with Qasim partially incapacitat-
 ed, Abdi appears to be the key
 figure in the Iraqi Government.
 The assassination attempt
 has increased the possibility
 of major factional strife in-
 side the country.   Since the
 expected roundup of antiregime
 elements will focus on members
 of pro-UAR and anti-Communist
 nationalist groups, the Iraqi
 Communist party is likely to
 gain new strength and influence
 within the government.   The
 Communists have already rallied
 to Qasim's support, and crowds
 are reported to have chanted,
 "Long live Qasim; death to
 Nasir."  If Qasim remains in-
 capacitated for any considerable
 length of time, clashes between
 the various internal factions
 are likely, and a breakdown in
 public order and control is a
 possibility.
 A semiofficial Cairo news-
 paper has declared that it was
 the Iraqi Government's "import
 of alien policies" which led to
 the attempt on Qasim's life.
 The Cairo press alleges that
 Baghdad lived through a subse-
 quent night of terror, with Com-
 munist-controlled Popular Re-
 sistance Forces out shooting in
 the streets, large numbers of na-
 tionalists being arrested, and
 "fresh massacres of nationalists"
 soon to be expected.
 Direct military intervention
 by the UAR in Iraq is unlikely
 unless the Iraqi Government
 loses control and major faction-
 al strife takes place,
 The recent trend toward
 a detente between the UAR and
 Jordan has been arrested by a
 new propaganda battle between
 the two countries.   On 30 Sep-
 tember, at a time when Cairo
 was trying to enlist the sup-
 port of other Arab nations for
 its new campaign against the
 aggressive policies of "imperi-
 alist.Red China," an Amman
 radio commentary charged that

 it was the UAR which had "opened
 the door" to Communism  in the
 Middle East in the first place.
 Cairo's Voice of the Arabs has
 subsequently attacked Jordan as
 "an opportunist" following "the
 orders of imperialists,"  who
 are aligned with  Communists
 against Arab nationalism.
 As a result of the propa-
 ganda controversy,                    Jordan's
 King Husayn may decide against
 meeting with UAR President Nasir
 at a tripartite conference which
 King Saud of Saudi Arabia has
 been trying to arrange  since
 his early September talks with
 Nasir in Cairo.
 New high-level negotiations'
 between the United Arab Republic
 and the Sudan  on  sharing  the
 Nile waters are  scheduled  to
 begin  in   Cairo on 10 October.
 While the chances that  agree-
 ment will be reached are small,
 they appear somewhat better now
 than during the past two years,
 when each round of discussions
 ended with very wide differences
 between the two countries' posi-
 tions.   Negotiation of  a solu-
 tion is further complicated by
 the insistence  of  the other
 riparian states--Kenya, Uganda,
 and Tanganyika, for whom Brit-
 ain is spokesman, and particu-
 larly Ethiopia--that they should
 have a voice in any settlement.
 The need for a Nile waters
 agreement has  been dramatized
 by Soviet engineers' preparations
 to begin construction  of  the
 UAR's Aswan High  Dam  and  by
 the Sudanese Government's public
 commitment to proceed with its
 Roseires Dam project  as  soon
 as the needed credit can be ob-
 tained.   The World Bank has de-
 layed consideration of a $100,-
 000,000 loan for the Roseires
 Dam pending Sudanese-UAR agree-
 ment on distribution  of  the
 Nile waters.  With  or without
 this dam,   the Sudan's program
 for cotton-acreage expansion
 requires a steady increase  in
 the amount of water diverted
 within Sudanese territory for
 irrigation purposes.
 Completion of the  Aswan
 High Dam in Egypt would  create
 a huge reservoir extending  up-
 river into Sudanese territory
 and displacing large numbers of
 Sudanese from their homes in the
 Wadi Halfa district. Failure to

 For months, the UAR has of-

 take high-level negotiations and
 to convince the Sudanese public
 that the Nasir government is

 The East German rulers are
 using a two-week celebration,
 built around the tenth anniver-
 sary in power on 7 October, to
 point up  what  they  consider
 their country's enhanced inter-
 national position.   This cele-
 bration climaxes a persistent
 propaganda campaign designed to
 show that East Germany is grad-
 ually being accepted by  the
 West as a sovereign state, and
 that his development is "in-
 evitable," despite West German
 efforts to oppose it.  The
 Ulbricht regime looks on this
 occasion as the turning point
 in East Germany's progress from
 the position of a virtual pariah
 among nations to that of a full-
 fledged sovereign state.
 Soviet First Deputy Pre-
 mier Kozlov asserted in a speech
 on 6 October that  West  Ger-
 many's  "notorious                    Hallstein
 doctrine"--that no country ex-
 cept the USSR having diplomatic
 relations with East Germany
 shall be recognized by Bonn--
 is beginning to crumble,   He
 said Bonn's efforts to pre-
 serve "the international iso-
 lation of East Germany" have
 been in vain.   He pointed to
 East Germany's participation
 in the Geneva conference on an
 equal footing   with  the Bonn
 republic as evidence that even
 the Western powers have had to
 recognize the Communist regime's
 existence.
 Several speakers  casti-
 gated West Germany in the usual
 vituperative terms, but none-
 theless called on Bonn to nego-
 tiate with the East  Germans
 the formation of a committee
 or confederation as the first
 step to reunification.   No new
 proposals were made  in  the
 speeches, which dwelt monoto-
 nously on East Germany's eco-
 nomic achievements                                                                during the
 ten-year  period~.and the over-
 whelming popular support  en-
 joyed  by  the  Communist pro-
 grams.
 In another move to point
 up East Germany's sovereignty,
 the new East German flag, the
 West German tricolor with a
 hammer and compass insignia
 superimposed on it, was  un-
 furled on 6 October over the
 West Berlin elevated rail in-
 stallations, which remain under
 East German control,   When
 West Berlin police sought  to
 remove  the flags,   several
 clashes occurred between them
 and Communist "workers," the
 most serious of which was a
 pitched battle between about
 80 rail employees and a small
 police force at the elevated
 repair shops in Gruenewaldo
 On 7 October, some 60 East
 German flags were still flying
 over elevated installations in
 West Berlin.  The West Berlin
 authorities deferred further
 action,  but an uneasy situation
 prevails, exemplified by a West
 Berlin trade union  leader's
 assertion that he may not be
 able to restrain the workers
 from taking action to  remove
 the flags.   The  East Germans
 have sent members of the work-
 ers' militia to guard at least
 some of the elevated installa-
 tions in West Berlin.

 BRITAIN RECEPTIVE TO INCREASING EAST GERMAN VISITS
 London has been generally
 receptive to the growing number
 of East German officials visit-
 ing the United Kingdom to pro-
 mote  the prestige of the U1-
 bricht regime.   The  policy
 of furthering exchanges with
 East Germany will be  an
 additional factor clouding re-
 lations with Bonn.
 The Ulbricht regime is ex-
 ploiting its tenth anniversary
 celebration on 7 October with a
 special exhibit which opened in
 London on 29 September and will
 tour 18 British cities.   The
 East Berlin symphony orchestra
 is appearing in London's Royal
 Festival Hall.   A special dele-
 gation from Dresden is visiting
 "sister city" Coventry on in-
 vitation of the Laborite lord
 mayor.
 Although on occasion the
 Foreign Office has shown annoy-
 ance at Home Office action in
 issuing visas, certain Foreign
 Office officials have strongly
 objected to further Allied ef-
 forts to exclude Wieland and the
 Dresden delegation in the elec-
 tion campaign period. As a gen-
 eral principle, the British con-
 sider the expansion of trade and
 personal contacts compatible
 with Western objectives of break-
 ing down East-West barriers.
 On 1 October the Foreign Office
 agreed to discuss with the
 United States and France "prin-
 ciples and categories" of East
 German travel.   Knowing Bonn's
 hostility toward any seeming
 enhancement of East Germany's
 status, the British prefer to
 postpone discussion with the
 Federal Republic.
 Visas were also granted to
 Deba Wieland, the Russian-born
 director of the East German news
 agency ADN, to accept an invi-
 tation from Reuters, which
 opened an East Berlin office
 last May, and to Arthur Pieck,
 director of the regime's civil
 airlines, to attend the annual
 Farnborough air show staged by
 British plane manufacturers in
 September.   Pieck is the son of
 the East German President.   De-
 lays by the Allied Travel Office
 in West Berlin in granting the
 necessary authorization prevent-
 6d Pieck's attendance.
 Rightist European settlers
 are fearful that exercise of
 Algerian self-determination as
 proposed by President de Gaulle
 would leave them at the mercy
 of a vengeful Moslem majority,
 and this concern has led to a
 resurgence of extremist activity
 In any event, Britain's
 willingness to countenance con-
 tinued visits by East Germans is
 bound to hamper its already
 strained relations with Bonn.
 The Labor party is more inclined
 than the Conservatives to dis-
 regard the Federal Republic and
 therefore more favorable to pro-
 moting East German contacts.

 will attempt to make themselves
 heard in Parliament, which re-

 out by Debre's decision to per-

 following his general policy
 statement on 13 October.   Indi-
 cations of a large assembly ma-
 jority may also have influenced
 the government's decision to per-

 De Gaulle seems anxious to dem-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 DISARMAMENT - 14TH UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
 UN members' preoccupation
 with disarmament and nuclear
 testing is highlighted by the
 fact that this assembly session
 has five separate disarmament
 items on its agenda.   The as-
 sembly's political committee
 begins debate next week with
 the Soviet proposal for "com-
 plete and general disarmament"
 as its first item.   The chief
 Soviet UN delegate has predicted
 that this debate would take up
 a "month and a half of the 14th
 General Assembly's time."
 Nevertheless the assembly will
 probably refer the Soviet pro-
 posal to the recently formed
 ten-nation,-disarmament forum
 for study.
 Although the assembly will
 endorse the formation of the
 ten-nation disarmament forum of
 five Western and five Soviet-
 bloc countries organized by the
 Big Four, some Latin American
 members will be critical because
 of the lack of an effective link
 with the UN.   The USSR has al-
 ready begun to exploit this
 feeling and the resentment of
 other UN members at their ex-
 clusion from disarmament
 negotiations.
 Soviet dele-
 gates are assiduously spreading
 the story that the United States
 wanted the new forum to have no
 ties with the UN and that it was
 only after the USSR's "heroic
 work" that the Big Four's com-
 munique provided for any UN
 connection. Soviet 'representatives
 are also claiming that Moscow
 wanted "neutrals" in the new
 group but that the United States
 insisted on the "five-five"
 arrangement.
 India again this year has
 called for a UN ban on nuclear
 testing.  Although New Delhi's
 proposal will probably be re-
 ferred to the ten-nation forum
 for consideration,  India may
 during the course of the debate
 request a report from the Geneva
 nuclear test conference partici-
 pants on the status of the talks,
 the progress made, and the re-
 maining issues.
 Morocco has raised the
 question of proposed French
 nuclear tests in the Sahara in
 an effort to have the UN call
 on France to desist.   Although
 Rabat wants its item handled
 separately from other disarma-
 ment issues,  the assembly will
 probably refer the problem to
 the new forum also.
 Ireland, working closely
 with British and American dele-
 gates, has agreed to refer its
 proposal to prevent wider dis-
 semination of nuclear weapons to
 the ten-nation forum.   The Irish
 want those powers,  including
 France, producing nuclear weapons
 to refrain from handing, ~ over the
 control of such weapons to any
 nation not possessing them.  Powers
 not now possessing nuclear weapons,.:
 under the Irish proposal, would
 refrain from manufacturing them.
 BELGIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS
 The Belgian Government is
 heading for a financial crisis
 which could bring down the
 Social Christian - Liberal
 coalition of Prime Minister
 Eyskens.   While a long-term loan
 from the Belgian National Bank
 might stave off a crisis, the
 bank opposes such a move on the
 grounds that the solution to

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Belgium's periodic budget defi-
 cits is higher taxation.   Such
 a step, however,  is opposed
 by Liberal party leaders--who
 have threatened to leave the
 government rather than vote for
 a tax increase--and by the con-
 servative wing  of Eyskens' own
 party.
 The $180,000,000-$220,000,-
 000 deficit is partly a re-
 flection of the weak state of
 the country's economy.   Recovery
 from the 1958 recession has been
 relatively slower and more
 limited in Belgium than elsewhere
 in Europe.   The economy is beset
 with several problems,  including
 high production costs in manu-
 facturing and a serious overpro-
 duction crisis in the coal
 industry.
 The situation created by in-
 adequate revenues has been ag-
 gravated by the expensive pro-
 grams to which the Eyskens gov-
 ernment is committed, such as
 subsidization of the coal in-
 dustry,  a school-building pro-
 gram, and gradual extension of
 a voluntary recruitment plan in
 the defense forces.   Moreover,
 Brussels seems likely for the
 first time to have to subsidize
 the Congo budget.
 Temporary measures to cover
 the deficit have been resorted
 to in the past and could be
 again.   The uneasy relationship
 between the coalition partners
 and the powerful position of the
 Socialist opposition, however,
 has made it difficult to pare
 major expenditure items.   The
 one exception to this may be
 defense, which has tended to be
 a politidAl football.   During
 his recent visit to Washington,
 Defense Minister Gilson announced
 an increase in defense expendi-
 tures, but Finance Minister van
 Houtte has stated on several oc-
 casions that Gilson's sights are
 too high.
 Over the longer term,  the
 only answer to the government's
 financial problems would appear
 to be a new cabinet and higher
 taxation.   The Social Christians
 and the Liberals are funda-
 mentally at odds on economic
 issues, as were the Socialists
 and the Liberals in the 1954-
 1958 coalition.   The Social
 Christians and the Socialists,
 however, might be able to
 come to terms on a more real-
 istic tax program.   The So-
 cialists have  been gearing
 their new  program with a
 view toward possible par-
 ticipation in the next coal-
 ition government.   It is doubt-
 ful, however, that this could
 be achieved  without new
 elections.
 NEW HUNGARIAN FIVE-YEAR PLAN (1961-65)
 The Hungarian economic plan
 for 1961-65,     to be approved at
 the November party congress,  is
 generally realistic.   Not all
 goals are likely to be achieved,
 however,  because of probable
 difficulties in stretching in-
 vestments,  raising labor produc-
 tivity, and fulfilling the agri-
 cultural production target.
 Plans include the near-completion
 of,. . agricultural :collectiviz .tion, . r
 which was advanced so rapidly
 during the first part of this
 year, and promise about a 3.5-
 percent annual rise in per
 capita real income during this
 and the next six years.
 The increase in total in-
 dustrial production planned for
 1965 over the 1958 level--that
 is, a seven-year period--is 65-
 70 percent,  or 10 percent higher

 than indicated during prelim-
 inary discussion of the plan.
 In both 1958 and 1959 the growth
 of industry has been greater
 than the annual average neces-
 sary to achieve this higher
 target.   Within industry, out-
 put of capital goods is to in-
 crease about a third faster than
 that of consumer goods.
 Several programs are mapped
 out for industry.   In addition
 to developing industrially back-
 ward areas, altering still fur-
 ther the composition of indus
 trial output, and expanding the
 raw material and power base, a
 reorganization of management is
 planned.   This reorganization,
 an extension of gradual changes
 in recent years, is designed to
 eliminate superfluous positions
 and enlarge the operational con-
 trol of lower level officials.
 The program will apparently
 be  similar to that intro-
 duced in Czechoslovakia last
 year.

 In agriculture,
 the use of artificial
 fertilizers,is to be
 increased to three
 times the present
 volume, and the trac-
 tor pool is to be ex-
 panded by 150 percent.
 Other programs, such
 as improving irrigation
 and crop rotation,
 will also be stepped
 up with a view to
 achieving during the
 1961-65 period an aver-
 age agricultural pro-
 duction 30-32 percent
 above the 1954-58
 average.   While plans
 do appear to provide
 resources for expand-
 ing output, the sched-
 uled increase is am-
 bitious, in view of
 the difficulties in
 accelerating the growth
 df the  agricultural
 sector and the push
 for collectivization
 --now being met with
 peasant hostility.
 To implement plans for in-
 dustrial and agricultural ex-
 pansion, investment during the
 1961-65 period is to be at least
 50 percent higher than during
 1956-60.   Actual investment fig-
 ures appear to provide for a
 much larger increase because of
 price changes on 1 January 1959
 which raised the average value
 of capital goods 68 percent.
 The planned rise is substantial,
 however, especially as part of
 the national income must be al-
 located to the payment of for-
 eign debts, and as the regime
 promises to raise per capita
 real income 26-29 percent by
 1965.   Higher national income
 is also expected to permit an
 increase in material and foreign
 exchange reserves.
 It is doubtful that even a
 50-percent rise in investments
 can be stretched to cover all
 the programs planned for industry,

 The reliance on a 37-40 percent
 rise in labor productivity  for
 fulfilling  output plans  and
 allowing  wage increases  also
 seems optimistic.   The regime
 will probably make various re-
 visions of individual goals in
 this plan before the end of

 RELATIONS BETWEEN CAIRO AND PEIPING DETERIORATE
 In providing expatriate
 Syrian Communist leader Khalid
 Bakdash a forum from which to
 criticize*Nasir, Peiping has
 shown it will support Middle
 Eastern Communists despite'the
 increased frictions with the
 UAR such a policy was bound to
 bring.   Nasir has recalled the
 UAR charge, who had walked out
 of the Chinese Communist tenth
 anniversary celebration where
 Bakdash spoke on 28 September.
 A stiff formal protest was
 sent to the Chinese Communist
 Embassy in Cairo after Ambas-
 sador Chen Chia-kang refused to
 accept it personally on the
 grounds he had no instructions
 from Peiping.   The UAR also in-
 structed its officials to boy-
 cott all of Communist China's
 anniversary programs,and,   in
 Damascus, resorted to cordoning
 off the reception given by the
 Chinese Communist consul,
 Closure of'the consular
 post in Damascus has been sug-
 gested in the UAR press, which
 has carried a series of biting
 editorials since 29 September
 charging Peiping with "political
 provocations" against Cairo and
 with a "policy of  invasion and
 domination" aimed at all "hon-
 est" neutrals.   Citing Peiping's
 feuds with Yugoslavia and India
 as examples of this "aggres-
 sive intent," UAR propaganda is
 calling on Afro-Asian nations
 to rally behind Cairo and "stand
 up against this Chinese trend."
 This emphasis supports a recent
 report that Nasir, while genuine-
 ly irritated with Peiping's
 sponsorship of Bakdash, also
 feels the incident gives him
 an opportunity to strengthen
 his position among the neutrals.
 Nasir thus is viewed by
 Peiping as a threat not only to
 Middle Eastern Communism but to
 the bloc position among the
 Afro-Asian nations--more specif-
 ically to Communist China's
 own standing  in  that group.
 Peiping has broadcast Bakdash's
 speech in Arabic but  has not
 yet replied directly to Cairo's
 propaganda.   This suggests a
 reluctance to become embroiled
 in an acrimonious exchange be-
 fore an international audience
 rather than any desire to pla-
 cote Nasir.   If the UAR attacks
 continue, however,  the Chinese
 may feel compelled to meet
 Nasir's challenge with equally
 abusive  counterpropaganda,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Diplomatically,the Chinese
 may withdraw their own ambassa-
 dor until the situation im-
 proves.   Peiping could  also
 enforce its recent demand that
 the UAR eliminate its chronic
 trade deficit.   Peiping  could
 threaten to reduce its purchases
 of Egyptian cotton,which amount-
 ed to $35,000,000 last  year.
 Peiping's disenchantment
 with Nasir probably began with
 what it considered his lukewarm
 support for Communist China's
 1958 action in the Taiwan Strait,
 especially in view  of its own
 strong political  support for
 Cairo during the 1956 Suez cri-
 sis.   Chinese suspicion that
 Nasir's professed friendship
 was at best unreliable probably
 became conviction in late 1958
 when he began his domestic anti-
 Communist campaign.   Along with
 the USSR and other  members of
 the bloc, Peiping criticized
 Cairo and began to side open-
 ly with Iraq.
 Communist China's attitude
 apparently helped stimulate
 Cairo's attacks on Peiping dur-
 ing its suppression  of  the
 Tibetan revolt. Chinese propa-
 ,ganda responded until  May,
 when Peiping attempted to end
 the public squabble with India
 and the UAR.   Cairo has contin-
 ued intermittent criticism of
 Peiping, however, and since mid-
 July the Chinese have  replied
 periodically.  In early Septem-
 ber the UAR member of the Afro-
 Asian Solidarity Council's Per-
 manent Secretariat    reportedly
 took issue with his  Chinese
 counterpart over the Sino-In-
 dian border controversy.  This
 move probably was assessed by
 Peiping as a deliberate UAR ef-    25X1
 fort to embarrass Communist
 China and undermine its pres-
 tige.
 TIBETAN BORDER PROBLEMS
 Nepal and Pakistan,as well
 as India,are showing increasing
 concern over their border prob-
 lems with Communist China  and
 are making efforts       to secure
 their interests in the Himh.lay-
 an mountain range.
 Indian Prime Minister Nehru
 on 26 September replied in firm
 language to Chou En-lai's let-
 ter of 8 September.   Rejecting
 Chinese charges  and standing
 fast on his previously announced
 position, Nehru  said that "no
 discussion can be fruitful un-
 less the outposts now held    by
 Chinese forces  on the Indian
 side of the  traditional fron-
 tier are first                 evacuated  by
 them and further threats  and
 intimidation cease."
 In a press conference  on
 8 October,Nehru added that his
 government would not undertake
 any military operations to re-
 cover                                                       the outposts  "at           this
 stage," while efforts were un-
 der way on the political level.
 New Delhi's insistence on Chi-
 nese withdrawal would seem to
 leave the situation deadlocked
 unless Peiping takes the un-
 likely step of evacuating                                                                 its
 troops from Longju outpost    in
 Assam, which it occupied fore--
 ibly on 26 August.
 Peiping will probably  re-
 ply in terms which would  not
 compromise its claims to terri-
 tory in Ladakh and Assam.  It is
 likely, however,   to  reiterate
 its   willingness  to negotiate.

 agitation on this issue.  By re-
 opening the explosive question
 of Bombay's status, New Delhi
 probably hopes to avert a cam-
 paign of violence patterned aft-
 er the agitation in Kerala and
 to improve the party's position
 for the 1962 elections.
 Congress leaders are delay-
 ing a formal decision to divide
 the state, pending consultation
 with provincial party chiefs,
 but reliable reports indicate
 that the reorganization will
 take effect next April. Two new
 states--which will probably be
 called United Maharashtra and
 Mahagujarat--will be formed out
 of the areas of Bombay where Ma-
 rathi and Gujarati, respective-
 ly, are the dominant languages.
 There seems to be agreement
 that Bombay city, the disposi-
 tion of which was the main
 stumbling block in previous re-
 organization plans, will go to
 Maharashtra.
 First press reports sever-
 al weeks ago of the shift in
 the Congress position apparent-
 ly came as a complete surprise
 to local politicians.  Most Con-
 gress party elements in the
 state welcomed the reversal of
 policy, although they expressed
 some misgivings about the dif-
 ficult problems posed by reor-
 ganization.
 Strong    opposition   was
 voiced, however, by certain Con-
 gress leaders in Vidarbha, the
 central Indian Marathi-speaking
 area which was integrated into
 eastern Bombay in 1956.   This
 group has long promoted its own
 separatist movement and resists
 inclusion in any "United Maha-
 rashtra."  The majority of Con-
 gress members from Vidarbha in
 the national Parliament, how-
 ever, has issued a statbment'.sup-
 porting a single Marathi-speak-
 ing state, thus increasing the
 likelihood that New Delhi will
 succeed in dissuading the region-
 alists from pressing their de-
 mands.
 Non-Congress    elements,
 which in both parts of Bombay
 are united in powerful linguis

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE ' WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SUKARNO AND THE INDONESIAN ARMY
 Although President Sukarno
 continues to support the Indo-
 nesian Army, he has recently
 demonstrated a renewed concern
 to balance the army's influence
 in government by making conces-
 sions to leftist political for-
 ces.   These include his decision
 to speak at the Communist par-
 ty's sixth national congress on
 16 September, despite the army's
 attempts to minimize publicity
 given the meeting.   Sukarno has
 also established a West Irian
 Committee weighted with extreme
 nationalists and leftists, which
 is likely to obstruct the army's
 anti-Communist efforts,
 An impending reorganization
 of administrative machinery gov-
 erning the implementation of
 prevailing martial law seems
 likely to decrease the powers
 of General Nasution, army chief
 of staff and defense minister
 In promoting these devel-
 opments, Sukarno apparently is
 motivated by fear that the army
 may become, if it is  not  al-
 ready, sufficiently powerful to
 overshadow him or to challenge
 his  own position. Rumors of an
 impending army coup, which have
 circulated in Djakarta in re-
 cent weeks, almost certainly
 have played a part in making
 Sukarno uneasy.   The rumors ap-
 pear to have arisen from gener-
 al apprehension over army in-
 fluence in government,  but they
 may also have been-promoted by
 the Indonesian Communist party,
 which has consistently tried to
 create dissension between Sukarno
 and the army.
 An army coup directed at
 replacing President Sukarno or
 reducing his power appears un-
 likely at this time, however,
 unless there is extreme provo-
 cation.   The army itself would
 be sharply divided on action a-
 gainst Sukarno, and army lead-
 ers in Djakarta are aware that
 an unsuccessful coup might cause
 Sukarno to turn almost exclusive-
 ly toward the Communists for
 support.
 Surrounding the uneasy re-
 lations between Sukarno and the
 army is a growing atmosphere of
 pessimism in government circles.
 The return to the 1945 constitu-
 tion last July has not facili
 tated solutions to the nation's
 problems to the extent Sukarno
 and others had hoped.   The con-
 stitutional change has not satis-
 fied the demands of Sumatran and
 North Celebes dissidents, and
 the financial drain imposed by
 suppression of guerrilla warfare
 continues.
 In addition, the 43-member
 cabinet is not operating smooth-
 ly and appears to have produced
 new administrative delays and
 frustrations.    A change in
 regional government precipitated
 by the constitution has brought
 considerable criticism,   and
 efforts  to restrict  Chinese
 retail  trade  have  run  into
 far  more  resistance  than the
 government  had  anticipated.
 MALI FEDERATION MOVING TOWARD INDEPENDENCE
 Leaders of the Federation
 of Mali, made up of the auton-
 omous French Community repub-
 lics of Senegal and Soudan, have
 begun to implement their local
 political commitment to gain ju-
 ridical independence for Mali
 at an early date.   They intend
 to keep this West African area

 'CURRENT -INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Community, which they hope will
 be altered  so as to include a
 multinational confederation.
 Mali leaders have publicly
 announced and formally commu-
 nicated to President de Gaulle
 their intention to seek inde-
 pendence by invoking an article
 of the French constitution per-
 mitting a negotiated transfer
 to individual Community members
 of powers vested in the organi-
 zation as a whole.   At present
 the Community--which in effect
 means Paris--is responsible for
 foreign policy, defense, econom-
 ic and financial policy, justice,
 and higher education.
 Some younger, radical Sou-
 danese elements within the fed-
 eration's dominant party have
 favored use of the constitu-
 tion's more dramatic referendum
 procedure to gain Mali's inde-
 pendence.   The moderate leaders
 have declared, however, that
 this course, which would presum-
 ably lead to Mali's abrupt de-
 parture  f rom'.'the  Community,
 would be considered only if the
 contemplated negotiations with
 France fail.   De Gaulle, with
 his recent emphasis on the Com-
 munity's "evolutional character,"
 seems to have accepted in princi-
 ple the Mali leaders' cautious
 approach.
 Mali assembly President Leo-
 pold Senghor has told the Ameri-
 can Consulate General in Dakar
 that the negotiations with France
 will probably begin soon after
 the meeting of the Community's
 Executive Council scheduled for
 11 December.   New bilateral a-
 greements are to be concluded
 with France following the proc-
 lamation of Mali's independence
 --probably during 1960, when the
 West African states of Cameroun,
 Togo, and Nigeria all are due
 to.evolve to sovereign status.
 Mali's leaders apparently en-
 visage that these agreements will
 authorize Paris to assume specif-
 ic responsibilities for Mali in
 such fields as defense, diplomacy,
 and higher education.
 Senghor indicated, however,
 that Mali intends to seek inter-
 national recognition--including
 separate UN membership--and to

 open embassies of its own in
 France, the United States, Brit-
 ain, neighboring African states,
 and, after "a couple of years,"
 the USSR.   Closer relations
 with Guinea are not now contem-
 plated despite some internal
 pressures in this direction.
 Mali's evolution seems cer-
 tain to prompt other Community
 members to reappraise their po-
 sitions vis-a-vis France.   The
 Malgache Republic (Madagascar),
 in particular, is likely  to
 follow Mali's lead soon.   Even
 the anti-Mali grouping  which
 Premier Houphouet-Boigny of the
 Ivory Coast formed with Volta,
 Niger, and Dahomey will be sub-
 ject to new strains.   Opposition
 forces favoring closer align-
 ment with Mali already  are
 gathering strength at least in
 Volta and Dahomey, and in Hou-
 phouet's own camp there appears
 to be a growing conviction that    25X1
 his policy of closer rather than
 looser ties with France must
 soon be revised.
 STATE OF SIEGE ENDS IN BOLIVIA
 The lifting of the state
 of siege in Bolivia on 30 Sep-
 tember suggests that the split
 between the moderate and left
 wings of the government party,
 the Nationalist Revolutionary
 Movement (MNR),. has been bridged
 at least temporarily, as polit-
 ical leaders prepare for the
 1960 presidential election cam-
 paign. Closer cooperation be-
 tween the two MNR factions is
 likely to result in less criti-
 cism by the left wing of the
 administration's cooperation
 with the United States.   The
 MNR nominations for president
 and vice president--which are
 tantamount to election--will be
 made at the party convention,
 now scheduled to open on 10 De-
 cember.
 A moderate-left split has
 been a persistent feature of the
 MNR's seven-year dominance in
 Bolivia.   In mid-September the
 long-standing possibility that
 the MNR might break into two po-
 litical parties seemed near ful-
 fillment.   About 100 leaders,
 meeting in La Paz with Minister
 of Government Guevara, organized
 a moderate rightist group called
 the "authentic MNR" and issued
 formal membership cards.   Press
 revelations of this activity
 caused the executive secretary
 of the new group to offer evi-
 dence that the left wing under
 labor leader Juan Lechin has
 also been organized with equal
 formality.
 After President Siles had
 talked with various aspirants
 for the 1960 election, including
 former President Paz, however,
 the MNR's national political com-
 mittee on 28 September issued a
 communique dissolving "sectors"
 and suspending anyone continuing
 efforts to organize "fractional
 ist groups."  Shortly thereafter,
 the government signaled the re-
 laxation of political tension
 by withdrawing the state of siege,
 which permits tight control of
 public assembly and individual
 travel and which has been a fair-
 ly normal feature of MNR admin-
 istrations.
 The compelling reason for
 party unity appears to be the
 presidential elections.   In the
 1956 and 1958 elections--the only
 elections held with universal
 suffrage--the MNF polled 81 per-
 cent of the total vote.                                                               Thus
 nomination as president or vice
 president by a united MNR en-
 sures electoral victory, whereas
 fragmentation of the party would
 make the outcome unpredictable.
 In Bolivia, unlike many Latin
 American countries,  party organ-   25X1
 ization is more important for
 electoral  victory   than  per-
 sonal                                                               leadership.

 Latin America's toughest
 and most durable dictator--Gen-
 eralissimo Rafael Trujillo of
 the Dominican. Republic--is fac-
 ing more internal opposition to
 his regime than at any time   .
 since he came to power in 1930.
 The Dominican people, who had
 become accustomed to the pros-
 perity which Trujillo brought
 them, now are showing disillu-
 sionment over the economic hard-
 ships caused by,heavy military
 expenditures made during the
 past year.  Dissidents are more
 active and outspokenly critical
 of the regime than at any time
 in the past.
 Trujillo believes the mil-
 itary expenditures--estimated
 to have totaled $50,000,000
 since January--are necessitated
 by the threats of armed inter-
 vention by his two bitter en-
 emies, Cuban Prime Minister
 Fidel Castro and Venezuelan
 President Romulo Betancourt.
 Cuban- or Venezuelan-based
 rebel invasion attempts do not
 appear imminent, however.
 Trujillo probably faces
 more dangerous opposition from
 inside the country, where dis-
 sidence is growing but is still
 largely unorganized.  This op-
 position is centered in the
 professional and middle classes,
 which have been severely af-
 fected by the economic deterio-
 ration.   Another small but
 growing group of dissidents con-
 sists of friends , and relatives
 of persons liquidated or perse-
 cuted by the regime and of wom-
 en victimized by younger mem-
 bers of the Trujillo entourage
 closely associated with the
 dictator's sons.
 of diplomatic and military de-
 fections abroad during the past
 three months are additional in-
 dicators of Trujillo's falling
 prestige.
 Intensive recruiting abroad
 for a "foreign legion" by Tru-
 jillo agents suggests that the
 dictator may doubt the compe-
 tence of his army, which suf-
 fered heavy casualties during
 the. June fighting against in-
 surgents.  However, many of the
 mercenaries already recruited
 reportedly are in jail for re-
 fusing to fight.
 The economic situation is
 likely to worsen because of
 continued military spending, the
 expected decline in foreign ex-
 change earnings, and the all-
 time low in tourist trade.   If
 the economic recession continues
 to cause more unemployment and
 economic distress,  resentment
 against Trujillo will increase.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 EXPANSION OF SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN ANTARCTIC
 Recent Soviet announce-
 ments indicate not only a note-
 worthy expansion of the USSR's
 activities in the Antarctic but
 a possible broadening of other
 bloc countries' activities there
 as well.  The Soviet fifth ex-
 pedition (1959-60) will prob-
 ably establish three new tempo-
 rary stations, make the USSR's
 third attempt to land a party
 in western Antarctica, and seek
 to complete a trans-Antarctic
 glaciological traverse by June
 1960.   Soviet announcements in-
 dicate long-range Antarctic
 scientific planning through
 1965 by the presidium of the
 Soviet Academy of Sciences.
 Soviet Operations
 The Ob, flagship and four-
 season veteran of Soviet Antarc-
 tic operations, will sail early
 in November.   It will be fol-
 lowed by a passenger-cargo ves-
 sel scheduled to land nearly
 160 personnel with supplies and
 equipment, including an IL-14
 transport, an LI-2 transport,
 and a MI-4 helicopter.   The Ob,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 after unloading at Mirnyy and
 Lazaryev, will proceed to the
 western Antarctic,        in the area
 of the Bellingshausen Sea, for
 an attempted landing and geo-
 logical studies.   If the at-
 tempt by sea should fail, a
 landing could be made by the
 Ob's AN-2 biplane, which has
 the necessary range and cargo-
 carrying capacity.  The total
 voyage of the Ob is expected
 to last six to seven months.
 The three presently func-
 tioning year-round Soviet sta-
 tions--Mirnyy, Vostok, and
 Lazaryev--will continue opera-
 tions.   On 1 October, an LI-2
 made the first flight from
 Mirnyy to Lazaryev.  One of the
 projects of these stations will
 be the previously announced at-
 tempt at a trans-Antarctic gla-
 ciological traverse to be com-
 pleted in the Antarctic au-
 tumn .(March-June) of 1960. The
 last contingent of personnel,
 equipment, and supplies for
 this project left Mirnyy on
 27 September for Komsomolskaya,
 a Soviet summer station where
 the train for the trans-Antarc-
 tic trek will be organized.
 The traverse will proceed from
 Komsomolskaya to Vostok and, if
 possible, Lazaryev, via the US-
 operated South Pole Station and
 the now inactive Soviet station,
 "Pole of Inaccessibility."
 From the Lazaryev station,
 which eventually is to be ex-
 panded to a complement of 25,
 the USSR plans "to compile the
 first geological map of the
 mountains of Queen Maud Land."
 Two of the three new sta-
 tions to be established will
 be set up as aids in the trans-
 Antarctic operation,  one south
 of Lazaryev, and the other near
 the Australian Mawson station.
 In addition, the Komsomolskaya
 and Pole of Inaccessibility
 stations will probably function
 as auxiliary stations for the
 trans-Antarctic traverse'if it
 is able to continue toward
 Lazaryev.
 The third new station may
 be set up in the heretofore in-
 accessible Bellingshausen area
 (in the unclaimed sector), an
 objective announced in 1958.
 Although this area has to date
 defied the most powerful Amer-
 ican icebreakers, the Soviet
 Union probably feels confident
 that the establishment of a sta-
 tion there now is feasible as
 a result of extensive ice recon-
 naissance undertaken in the
 vicinity of the Amundsen and
 Bellingshausen seas by the Ob
 in April 1958 and by the 26-
 vessel Slava whaling fleet in
 early 1959.
 Soviet success in this
 project prior to a renewed
 American attempt to penetrate
 the sector--planned for early
 1960--would undoubtedly be
 widely exploited by Soviet prop-
 aganda.  Moreover, establish-
 ment and maintenance of such a
 station could ultimately chal-
 lenge the primacy of American
 rights in the unclaimed sector
 and cause concern in Chile and
 Argentina.   It might also cause
 some concern to all signatory
 powers of the Inter-American
 Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance,
 since a Soviet station in the
 unclaimed sector would be near
 the outer limit of the security
 zone established by that treaty.
 Bloc Participation
 Among the members of the
 fifth Soviet expedition will be
 scientists from three other bloc
 countries,   East Germany and
 possibly Communist China plan
 to participate for the first
 time, Czechoslovakia for the
 second.,   East German participa-
 tion may be an attempt to seize
 bloc initiative in exploiting

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 German interests built up by
 prewar German Antarctic activ-
 ities--the Federal Republic
 excluded Antarctica from its
 IGY and subsequent programs,
 Chinese participation would sug-
 gest a maneuver to test the sin-
 cerity of the anticipated US-
 initiated treaty to assure free-
 dom of Antarctic research to all
 countries.   Eighteen Poles will
 travel to Antarctica with the
 Soviet expedition and 11 will
 remain for the winter at the
 former Soviet station, Oazis.
 Long-Range Plans
 Announcements of new whal-
 ing ship construction indicate
 that the USSR plans to supple-
 ment its Slava-fleet operations
 in the Antarctic by adding three
 new whaling fleets. The Soviet-
 skaya Ukraina, a 44,000-ton fac-
 tory ship, will begin operations
 this season and construction has
 begun on a sister ship, the
 Sovetskaya Rossiya,  The Yuriy
 Dolgorukiy, a 40,000-ton factory
 ship, is being built in East
 Germany.  Thus the USSR may
 within four to five years have
 close to 60 whalers and support
 vessels in Antarctic waters ac-
 companying these factory ships.
 This might lead not only to
 Soviet domination of the indus-
 try but also to a breakdown in
 international controls over it.
 In a TASS broadcast of 13
 September, Treshnikov, head of
 the 1956-57 Antarctic expedi-
 tion, issued the first public
 statement that the atomic ice-
 breaker would be used in the
 Antarctic as well as in the
 Arctic,  Although probably not
 intended for use in the coming
 season, the Lenin could even-
 tually increase the period of
 Antarctic operations and would
 probably increase their capa-
 bilities.
 The chairman of the Soviet
 Antarctic Commission announced
 in July that "Soviet aircraft
 will soon make nonstop flights
 from Moscow to Mirnyy." Soviet
 flights to Antarctica, using
 an unspecified four-engine air-
 craft, were planned as early as
 1955, but subsequent transit
 rights via the Cocos Islands
 and Perth, obtained from Aus-
 tralia by negotiation,   were
 never exercised.   Whether the
 Antarctic landing. facilities can
 be made adequate for large air-
 craft is as yet uncertain.
 Soviet motives for such an
 undertaking--involving more than
 9,000 nautical miles of flight
 or 7,600 nautical miles by the
 great circle route,  well beyond
 the estimated commercial range
 of any known transport--undoubt-
 edly include a desire to increase
 the flow of key scientific per-
 sonnel and supplies to Antarc-
 tica, although cargo space would
 be limited because of the fuel
 requirements of such a long non-
 stop flight.   In addition, Soviet
 air capabilities would be demon-
 strated in a spectacular fashion.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ULBRICHT REGIME PLANS TRANSFORMATION OF EAST BERLIN
 In connection with the cel-
 ebration of East Germany's tenth
 anniversary on 7 October, the
 Ulbricht regime is publicizing
 ambitious plans to transform
 East Berlin into a showplace of
 German "socialist culture" and
 a suitable "national" capital
 to rival West Berlin.  The pro-
 gram, which forms part of East
 Germany's Seven-Year Plan (1959-
 65), is also designed to dem-
 onstrate the regime's deter-
 mination nbt'.to permit  East
 Berlin to become a part of any
 "free city" of Berlin.
 Character of East Berlin
 The Soviet sector of Ber-
 lin presents a sorry contrast
 to prosperous West Berlin. Gov-
 ernment buildings are shabby,
 and the reconstruction of sev-
 eral years ago along Stalinal-
 lee not only is ugly but fails
 to hide the bombed-out quarters
 behind the new buildings. Traf-
 fic,           away from the main arter-
 ies,  is scanty; streets are
 badly lighted and in need of
 general modernization.   East
 Berliners live in cramped
 apartments, of which there are
 not enough even for the city's
 dwindling population of 1,110,-
 000.   Retail facilities are
 scarce, badly stocked, and in-
 efficient.  Foodstuffs are often
 in short supply,
 East Berlin nevertheless
 holds a leading place in the
 country's economic life.   Its
 per capita consumption of es-
 sential foodstuffs and consum-
 er goods is considerably in
 excess of that of East Germany
 as a whole.   Industries in East
 Berlin provide employment for
 most of the local labor force
 of more than 611,000 (as against
 8,676,000 for all of 'East Germany)
 and constitute a major element
 in the nationalized industry of
 East Germany.
 New Government Center
 To improve the dismal phys-
 ical features of East Berlin, the
 Ulbricht regime has consolidated
 earlier projects for piecemeal
 improvements there and, under a
 "great leap forward" slogan, has
 planned a sweeping transforma-
 tion aimed at developing the
 Soviet sector into a rival of
 West Berlin.
 Major emphasis is to be
 given to the complete recon-
 struction of the city center.
 The Marx-Engels Platz, now a
 graveled parade ground, will be
 the focus of the rebuilt city,
 with government and party head-
 quarters located there or near-
 by.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 October 1959
 The regime has warned East
 Berliners that progress in re-
 construction will depend on
 major progress in the construc-
 tion industry, which, however,
 is already in the throes of
 various difficulties.   Suggest-
 ing that many more pitfalls lie
 ahead, the East German satiri-
 cal magazine Eulenspiegel re-
 cently lampooned East Berlin's
 chief architect for ferry-build-
 ing.
 Keyed to the October cel-
 ebration, the regime has sched-
 uled a number of special "vol-
 untary" workdays to clear away
 rubble and beautify the city.
 In Treptow, for example, SED
 central committee employees
 and local government officials
 took up picks and shovels on
 12 August to remove debris.
 Retail Trade
 Regime media are using all
 the Communist publicity devices
 to convince East Berliners that
 their life will be better in
 coming years.  This campaign is
 pointed up by SED boss Ulbricht's
 remarks on 13 August that a
 number of failures in East Ber-
 lin city management had been
 discussed by the SED politburo.
 Subsequently, a special Neues
 Deutschland "brigade" published
 a series of articles pointing
 out inadequacies in hardware
 stores, clothing shops, and gro-
 ceries and featured, as a for-
 ward step, a self-service gro-
 cery.
 Such criticism covers a
 sharp increase in the tempo of
 socialization of private retail
 trade.   An East Berlin news-
 paper reported on 11 September
 that there had been a 300-per-
 cent increase. in the number of
 socialist-type partnership agree-
 ments between the government and
 private enterprises signed in
 the first eight months of 1959
 in comparison with 1958.
 Cultural Plans
 The regime is making every
 effort to build up Humboldt
 University as a rival to the
 Free University of West Berlin
 and other West German universi-
 ties..   Under the plan, some
 $13,000,000 will be earmarked
 for reconstruction of its build-
 ings and construction of new
 institutes and research facil-
 ities.
 Probably in part to counter
 Western charges that the East
 German medical profession has
 been crippled by the flight of
 hundreds of medical men to the
 West, the regime is promising
 improved medical facilities for
 Humboldt University and various
 hospitals, including the large
 Charitg hospital.
 Industrial Center
 The investment of over
 $500,000,000 for expansion of
 East Berlin's industrial capac-
 ity constitutes an important
 part of the seven-year plan to
 make the city a real competitor
 with West Berlin.   Special em-
 phasis is placed on increases
 in key industries, as follows:
 electro-technical (143 percent),
 machine building (125 percent),
 and chemical production (77 per-
 cent).  Certain plants are to
 be regrouped and reorganized,
 including the Bergmann Bersig
 plant, the largest producer of
 power-generating equipment in
 East Germany.   Some of this
 construction includes projects
 for important industrial hous-
 ing--for example, a whole new
 area in Friedrichsfelde-Mar-
 zahn.
 While emphasizing expan-
 sion of such key industries,
 the regime is also underlining
 improvements in consumer goods
 producing plants, including a
 new furniture factory and ex-
 panded and improved garment
 factories.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 October 1959
 Discussion by high regime
 officials clearly reveals that
 these plans are designed  to
 overcome serious inddequacies
 in the city's over-all indus-
 trial production performance,
 East Berlin party  boss  Paul
 Verner stated  in  mid-August
 that there  had  been  serious
 lags in  meeting  the  plan in
 the first three months of the
 year and that the lags had not
 been made good during the next
 four months. At the first re-
 gional conference for East Ber-
 lin, held in late August, Lord
 Mayor Friedrich Ebert disclosed
 that the city  is   twelfth  in
 plan fulfillment among  the 15
 East German districts,  while
 the official report  for  the
 first  six months of   1959
 shows that it registered  the
 second lowest increase of all
 districts.
 Improved Transportation
 The seven-year plan for
 East Berlin calls  for  three
 new bridges over the Spree Riv-
 er, street widening, construc-
 tion of a new Wilhelm-Pieck-
 Ring in the city center,                   and
 fluorescent lighting  of some
 avenues.   Similarly, the whole
 public transportation system
 is to be gradually  improved.
 Prospects
 The regime will make every
 effort to carry out  the  main
 lines of its ambitious program
 for East Berlin,   although it
 probably will fail in many de-
 tails.   There is no reason to
 think that--in the absence of
 far-reaching adversities--East
 Berlin will not become a more
 modern and more attractive city
 during the next  seven  years.
 Like all phases of the Sev-
 en-Year Plan, however, the plan
 for East Berlin  depends  on
 whether the East German economy
 succeeds in taking the "giant
 leap forward" that the leader-
 ship demands.   In the event that
 financial stringencies and  un-
 inspired Communist  building
 methods continue to circumscribe
 the rebuilding effort,   the new
 city is likely to be character-
 ized by the same ugly,monotonous,
 shoddy construction that marked
 the Stalinallee housing develop-
 ment.   This would be a far cry     25X1
 from the well-built,imaginative,
 and attractive development  in
 West Berlin>

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Since 6 March 1957, when
 Ghana became the first tropical
 African state to evolve from
 colonial to independent status,
 Prime Minister Nkrumah's regime
 has made considerable progress
 in consolidating its power at
 home and in extending its in-
 fluence abroad.   Domestic oppo-
 sition has been largely stifled,
 a neutralist  course not un-
 friendly to the West has been
 charted, the economy has been
 kept on an even keel, and Accra
 has become a focal point of mil-
 itant pan-Africanism.   Concepts
 of Western-style democracy have
 suffered, however, and basic
 weaknesses are already impeding
 the progress of this "model"
 African state.
 When Britain's former Gold
 Coast colony emerged as the
 sovereign, Commonwealth state
 of Ghana, the specter of civil
 war still hung over this West
 African land of approximately
 5,000,000 largely illiterate
 persons.   Although Kwame Nkru-
 mah's Convention People's party
 (CPP)--the Gold Coast's first
 genuine mass movement--had al-
 ready been in office for six
 years, tribal leaders and con-
 servative cocoa farmers, espe-
 cially in the Ashanti region,
 were by no means reconciled to
 the modern, unitary, nation-
 state which the American-edu"
 cated Nkrumah was determined to
 create.
 Sporadic violence involv-
 ing armed adherents of the CPP
 and its traditional opponents--
 who sought a federal system with
 wide regional autonomy--had
 flared in 1954 and 1955.  On the.
 eve of independence in 1957, the
 CPP government finally accepted
 Britain's compromise constitu-
 tion providing for the future
 establishment of regional as-
 semblies and incorporating "en-
 trenched clauses" designed to
 safeguard the vital interests of
 Nkrumah's foes.   However, his
 regime, which had been returned
 to power in July 1956 with 72 of
 104 seats in the legislature,
 made no secret of its determina-
 tion to alter at the earliest
 opportunity the clauses  to
 which it objected.
 Since gaining full control
 of Ghana's affairs, Nkrumah and
 his cohorts have succeeded in
 radically transforming the un-
 certain domestic political sit-
 uation which prevailed 30 months
 ago.   Formerly powerful tribal
 chiefs, the principal bulwarks
 of his opposition and the old
 social order, have been politi-
 cally neutralized and brought
 under control.   Tribal institu-
 tions which conflict with the
 CPP's program to modernize and
 centralize Ghana are under heavy
 attack and appear to be weaken-
 ing.
 The overt, organized polit-
 ical opposition--which in 1957
 combined in the United party
 (UP)--seems headed for early
 extinction; its parliamentary
 strength has already dwindled,
 as a result of defections and
 lost by-elections, from 32 in
 March 1957 to 18.  The "en-
 trenched clauses" have 'long
 since been swept away, as have
 practically all constitutional
 restraints on the executive au-
 thority, which can now amend
 the constitution by a simple

 mass support, and the CPP's own
 popularity, superior resources,
 and more effective organization.
 In addition, the regime has not
 hesitated to capitalize on its
 ability to allocate development
 funds nor to harass, intimidate,
 and coerce its opponents, espe-
 cially through the use of powers
 of deportation and preventive
 detention.
 The latter measure, enacted
 in mid-1958, enables the govern-
 ment to detain without trial for
 up to five years any citizen
 suspected of acts prejudicial
 to the defense or security of
 Ghana.   Within the past year
 some 40 UP adherents, including
 two members of the National As-
 sembly, have been imprisoned un-
 der this law.   The regime has
 recently enacted still further
 repressive legislation for deal-
 ing with its opponents in the
 name of state security.
 Such measures, coupled with
 the government's increasing
 tendency to equate all opposi-
 tion with  disloyalty, if not
 treason, endanger the future of
 Western democratic concepts in
 Ghana.   Nevertheless, Nkrumah
 has not actually acted uncon-
 stitutionally and still pro-
 fesses his determination to
 maintain free elections.   Even
 the regional assemblies were
 eventually created--and subse-
 quently abolished--in accord
 with the letter if not the spirit
 of the constitution.
 Furthermore, evidence is
 strong that opposition elements
 have in fact been involved in
 conspiratorial activity with rev-
 olutionary overtones.   Also,
 some such coercive measures were
 probably necessary to hold in
 check the powerful centrifugal
 forces inherent in Ghana's still
 largely tribal society.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 October 1959
 has managed to maintain intact
 the stable, Western-oriented
 economy inherited from Britain.
 Under Nkrumah it continues to
 enjoy a balanced budget, a sound
 currency, one of the highest per.-
 capita  incomes in tropical Af-
 rica, and--for an underdeveloped
 country--a remarkably even dis-
 tribution of wealth.   Further-
 more, its foreign debt is still
 insignificant and its sterling
 reserves, while somewhat reduced
 since independence, amount to ap-
 proximately $300,000,000.
 So far, however, Nkrumah
 has made little real progress
 toward lessening the economy's
 dependence on cocoa or toward
 speeding its slow rate of ex-
 pansion in recent years.   Per-
 capita output, stalled since
 1951, apparently dropped in
 1958.   Over this period public
 investment  totaled about $350,-
 000,000, but was not adequately
 supplemented by private invest-
 ment of a productive nature.
 In this connection,  inherent
 economic limitations on profit
 opportunities in Ghana have in-
 hibited the concerted effort
 made by the theoretically so-
 cialist Nkrumah government to
 attract foreign private capital.
 Domestic private capital avail-
 able for investment remains a
 negligible factor.
 This reticence of. potential
 foreign investors has so far
 blocked the proposed $600,000,-
 000 Volta River power-aluminum
 project to which the regime is
 politically committed. Nkrumah
 is still hoping':that Western
 aluminum interests will make the
 scheme eligible for World Bank
 support by undertaking to fi-
 nance a smelter; if such Western
 financing is not forthcoming,
 he is likely to look elsewhere.
 Kaiser Industries now is explor-
 ing prospects of forming a con-
 sortium.
 Meanwhile, the government
 has  ,,barked on an ambitious
 3eco,   Development Plan which
 calls for public investment of
 $390,000,000 on general develop-
 ment and $280,000,000 on hydro-
 electric power development over
 the five-year period which began
 1 July.   Like the Volta project,
 its full implementation would
 require heavy foreign borrowing,
 Foreign Affairs
 Nkrumah has gained wide
 publicity and considerable pres-
 tige for  himself  and  Ghana
 through his militant activities
 on behalf of the "total libera-
 tion" of Africa and the pan-Af-
 ricanists' ultimate goal of a
 United States of Africa.   In
 quick succession last year he
 promoted the first Independent
 African States conference, the
 proclamation of a "union"--
 still largely unimplemented--
 with the new state of Guinea,
 and the organization of a non-
 governmental African "people's"
 movement with headquarters in
 Accra.
 He thus boldly challenged
 Cairo's pretensions to African
 leadership.   However, neither
 this rivalry nor Ghana's consid-
 erable contacts with Israel has
 precluded the development of
 friendly personal relations, and,
 recently, a tactical working al-
 liance between Nkrumah and UAR
 President Nasir.
 More conservatively inclined
 elements--such as President Tub-
 man of Liberia and moderate Af-
 rican leaders in nearby French
 areas and in soon-to-be-inde-
 pendent Nigeria--have resented,
 and endeavored with increasing
 success to frustrate, Nkrumah's
 attempts to assert a leadership
 role in African affairs.
 Among these elements there
 was widespread satisfaction when
 the Ghanaian premier suffered a
 major setback at the West African
 "summit" conference attended by
 Tubman,  Nkrumah,  and Guinea's
 3ekou Tour6 in Liberia last July.
 Nkrumah's program for an immedi-
 ate, relatively close union among
 existing African states, to which
 others would be invited to ad-
 here as they became independent,
 was rejected in favor of the
 more cautious approach toward a
 looser association advocated by
 Tubman.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 October 1959
 On the world stage, Nkru-
 mah's proclaimed policy of "po-
 sitive neutralism and nonalign
 ment" has in practice been gen-
 erally sympathetic toward the
 West--especially the United
 States--and wary of entangle-
 ments with the bloc.   Largely
 as a result of bloc initiatives,
 however, Ghana's contacts with
 Communist countries have been
 increasing since late 1958. East
 Germany, Poland, and Czechoslo-
 vakia now have permanent trade
 delegations in Accra, and in Au-
 gust the Soviet Union established
 the first bloc diplomatic post
 there.
 Although Nkrumah has ap-
 parently not as yet been offered
 any significant long-term eco-
 nomic aid by the bloc, Ghana's
 development plans will provide
 continuing opportunities for
 economic penetration--especially
 if Western financing does not
 materialize in the amounts antic-
 ipated.   Meanwhile,  the growing
 numbers of bloc personnel in
 Accra will probably attempt to
 cultivate indigenous leftists
 and pro-Communists, some of whom
 occupy high places in the govern-
 ment,            the CPP,  and the labor
 movement.
 Despite, and to some ex-
 tent even because of, its suc-
 cesses, the Nkrumah regime suf-
 fers from serious weaknesses
 and deficiencies which it ap-
 pears unable or unwilling to
 remedy.   Both in the formation
 and execution of policy it tends
 to be indecisive, impulsive,
 arbitrary, and capricious. There
 is an increasing tendency to
 rely on words rather than ac-
 tions and for prestige consid-
 erations to become decisive--
 as in the decision earlier this
 year to create a navy and air
 force and add an armored unit
 to Ghana's 5,000-man army. Pub-
 lic morality is undermined by
 the almost certain involvement
 of top-echelon officials  In
 large-scale corruption.
 Administrative efficiency
 suffers from Nkrumah's growing
 preference for personal rule,
 from the politicians' distrust
 of civil servants, and from
 overemphasis on political con-
 siderations.   Moreover, there
 are potentially serious rivalries
 and frictions within the over-
 centralized CPP, as well as ac-
 cumulating evidence that its
 basic vitality may be ebbing.
 These and other deficien-
 cies, aggravated by the removal
 of all restraints on the execu-
 tive authority and the contin-
 ued nonexistence of an informed
 and energetic public opinion,
 are already a handicap to the
 country's progress.   In time
 they seem certain to result,
 assuming the CPP maintains its
 unity and monopoly  of  power,
 in  a slower  rate of  social
 and economic development   and
 in  decreased  prestige  and
 influence  abroad. They could
 contribute  eventually  to the
 creation of a powerful  new op-
 position and to a                                                                  power strug-    25X1
 gle which could undermine Ghana's
 present  internal stability
 SECRET
 Ghana's African policy has
 inevitably impaired, in varying
 degrees, its relationships with
 the colonial powers, including
 Britain.   Nevertheless, Nkru-
 mah, who was recently appointed
 a privy councilor, is expected
 to keep Ghana within the Com-
 monwealth when he transforms it
 from a constitutional monarchy
 to a republic, probably in the
 near future.   Relations with
 France have deteriorated espe-
 cially sharply in recent months,
 as Accra has intensified its
 propaganda attacks against the
 new French Community and the
 French-supported regime in Cam-
 eroun, taken a leading role in
 the widespread African condemna-
 tion of Paris' plans to test
 nuclear weapons in the Sahara,
 and recognized the Algerian
 rebel government.
