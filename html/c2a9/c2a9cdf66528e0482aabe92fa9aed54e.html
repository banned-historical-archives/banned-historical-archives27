 Chinese Communist Industrial Production
 I.  Introduction
 Taking to heart Lenin's admonition that only through industrialization could China
 become a socialist state,     the Chinese Communists made the development of heavy
 industry the core of their First Five Year Plan (1953-1957).  The rapid growth of
 heavy industry was to provide the material base for national defense, for the well-
 being of the people, and for still further increases in industrial capacity.  The
 goal of industrialization soon became identified with overtaking Great Britain in the
 absolute level of industrial production.  In 1958, with the optimism of the "leap
 forwardthe Chinese expected to achieve their goal. in 15 years.  More recently
 they have said that it may take from 30 to 50 years, but the goal is the same:
 To convert China, step by step, from a backward, agricultural
 country into an advanced, socialist, industrial state. J
 This paper will present an independently constructed index of total industrial
 production in Communist China for 1949-1965.  Although data on the output of specific
 .military items were not available,                        had to be included in the index
 A
 by imputation,- because the weights could not be adjusted satisfactorily to exclude
 military production.  Because most military production is concentrated in the metal
 processing industry, the assumption implicit in the construction of the index is
 that the military component of the metal processing industry grew at the same rate as
 the civiliah component.  However, if the weight for the metal processing industry
 Approved For Release 2005/05/16 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO03300100001-3
 Approved For Release 2005/05/16  CIA-RDP79T01049A003300100001-3
 could have been adjusted, the rate of growth shown by the resulting index of civilian
 industrial production would have been lower than that of the index presented in this
 paper.  On the other hand, if military production could have been included explicitly,
 the indexes for the metal processing industry and for total industrial production both
 would have been raised.
 For the years 191-9 to 1959, the index was calculated by weighting data on the
 physical output of final products in three stages.  In the first stage, the physical
 output series were grouped by branch of industry and weighted by their respective
 prices.  In the second stage, to form an index for industry as a whole, the resulting
 indexes for individual branches of industry were weighted by estimates of the values
 added that were computed from the relative shares of the wage bill paid to industrial
 workers. In the third stage, an index for total industrial production was calculated
 from the index for industry and a separately calculated index for handicrafts.
 Because data on the earnings of handicraft workers were not available, an estimate of
 the values added by industry and handicrafts was derived from Chinese Communist data
 for the net value, of total industrial production.
 For the years 1960 to 1965, because handicraft production could not be separated
 from the production of industrial enterprises and because the number of physical output
 series was greatly reduced, separate indexes could not be calculated for individual
 branches of industry or for industry and handicrafts.  An index for total industrial
 production was calculated by weighting the series for which estimates of physical

 Approved' For. Release 2005/05/16 : CIA-RDP79T01049AO03300100001-3
 output were available by their respective prices and adjusting the resulting index
 for the difference between its rate  of growth and that shown by the index of total
 industrial production for the years 1953-1957?
 The index is more reliable for the years 19+9-1957 than it is for the years 1958-
 1965.  Through 1957, the data on which the index is based are reasonably accurate
 and their coverage is sufficiently broad for the index to be used with confidence.
 For the years 1958-1959, although allowances were made for the deterioration in the
 quality of the items produced and for the tendency of official sources to exaggerate
 achievements in production, there may still be a small upward bias in the index.  For
 the years since 1960, however, the index should be regarded as providing only a general
 indication of the trend in industrial production, because the estimates of physical
 output are subject to a wider range of error and because the size of the sample is
 greatly reduced.
 My index of industrial production for Communist China is less reliable than
 indexes for Western European countries and is also less reliable than indexes constructed
 by Western scholars for other communist countries.  Because of the large body of data
 made available by highly developed statistical reporting systems, and because of the
 detailed analytical work that has been done, the indexes for these countries reflect
 accurately the growth of industrial production.  My index for Communist China may not
 even be as reliable as the indexes for many of the less developed countries.  Because

 Approved For Release'2005/05116 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO03300100001-3
 .of problems in statistical reporting in the less developed countries, individual
 output series may be no more accurate than those for China, but more complete coverage
 means that the indexes probably reflect the growth of industrial production more
 accurately than my index reflects the growth in China.
 The growth of industrial production in Communist China, as measured by the index
 described above, is discussed in Section II.  As an aid to the evaluation of the index,
 comparisons are made with the growth of industrial production in other countries in
 Section III and with two other independently constructed indexes of Chinese industrial
 production in Section?IV.  Finally, the prospects for the growth of industrial
 production during the Third Five Year Plan (1966-19'To) are discussed in Section V.
 The index is described in detail in Appendix A, the principal sources of data on the
 production of industrial commodities are discussed in Appendix B, and alternative
 estimates of physical output for those commodities used in the construction of the
 index for the years 1960 to 1965 are presented in Appendix C.

 II?  Summary of the Growth of Industrial Production
 Industrial production in Cormnunist China, as measured by the index presented in
 this paper, grew rapidly during the years 1949-1965, at an average annual rate of
 11 percent, but the differences from year to year and by branch of industry were
 extreme.   My index and the official Chinese Communist index for total industrial
 production, industry, and handicrafts are shown in Table 1.  The average annual rates
 of growth for individual branches of industry for the years 1950-1952, 1953-1957, and
 1958-1959 are presented in Table 2; and the structure of industrial production in
 191+9, 1952, 1957, and-1959 is presented in Table 3.  It was not possible to calculate
 the rates of growth by branch of industry or the structure of industrial production
 for the years since 1959 because of the lack of data.
 A.  Economic Rehabilitation, 1949-1952
 During the period of economic rehabilitation (1949-1952), my index shows that
 industrial production more than doubled, growing at an average annual rate of 27 percent.
 This rapid rate of growth was characterized by large increases in employment, but
 little or no growth in the net value of fixed capital assets.  The capacity damaged by
 the war or lost through the Soviet removal of equipment from Manchuria in 1945 was
 repaired or replaced and put back into operation, and supplies of raw materials were
 improved.  Industry grew at an average annual rate of 35 percent and handicrafts at
 8 percent.

 Within industry, the rates of growcli ranged from 19 percent in the electric
 power industry to 110 percent in the ferrous metals industry.  The branches of industry
 producing industrial materials, such as ferrous metals, chemical processing, and building
 materials, had the highest rates of growth.  These branches were followed by the metal
 processing industry and then less closely by the fuels and the light industries.
 Although the growth of the fuels and light industries was relatively slow, the rates
 achieved were quite high.
 There are no reliable indexes of industrial production by branch of industry
 for the pre--Communist period with which my indexes for the period of economic recovery
 can be linked, but the production of key industrial commodities may be used as a
 rough measure.  A comparison of?the rates of growth shown by individual branches of
 industry for the years 1950-1952 and the percentage decline in the production of key
 commodities from their peak to the level of output achieved in 191+9 shows an inverse
 relationship.  It is clear, therefore, that the rapid growth of total industrial
 production in this period represents a return to previously achieved levels of
 output rather than a growth in the productive capacity of industry and that the
 differences in the rates of growth shown by individual branches of industry are
 closely related to the extent to which production had -fallen from the pre-Communist
 peak levels.
 B.  The First Five Year Plan, 1953-1957
 During the First Five Year Plan (1953-1957), industrial production is estimated
 to have doubled again, reaching a level more than four times that of 191+9, but the

 rate of growth was slower and less steady than it had been during the period of
 economic rehabilitation.  Although averaging 14 percent, the annual. increases ranged
 from less than 1 percent in 1955 to 25 percent in 1953.
 The large increase in output in 1953 resulted from a 9 percent increase in
 the net value of fixed capital assets and an increase of 16 percent in the average
 number of workers.  The relatively slow growth in capital assets and the rapid growth
 in employment, however, are more typical of the period .of economic rehabilitation
 that they are of the rest of the First Five, Year Plan, when capital assets increased
 at a rate in excess of 20 percent annually, but employment increased at only 7 percent.
 These data, together with fragmentary data on the continued increase in the intensity
 with which existing capacity was used, indicate that the large increase in output
 achieved in 1953 was a continuation of the rapid growth achieved during the period
 of economic rehabilitation and tend to suggest that the pre-Communist peak level of
 production was not reached until 3.953.  Because 1953 was really part of the period
 of economic rehabilitation, the average annual rate of growth of 12 percent achieved
 during the years 1954-1957 is a better measure of industrial growth in China than
 the rate for the First Five Year Plan as a whole.
 During the five year period, industry grew at an average annual rate of 16
 percent and handicrafts at a rate of 7 percent.  Within industry, the rates of growth

 for individual branches were lower and the range in the rates was narrower than it
 had been during the period of rehabilitation varying from 9 percent in the textile
 industry to 31 percent in the ferrous metals industry.  The general pattern of the
 rates of growth shown during the First Five Year Plan was much the same as it had
 been during the period. of recovery, the most marked change being the relative
 improvement in the rates of growth shown by the fuels industries.
 Different factors determined the general pattern of growth in the two periods.
 Whereas the relative rates of growth during the period of rehabilitation had been
 determined largely by the extent to which the disruption of production has been
 repaired, the pattern of growth during the First Five Year Plan was the result of
 investment policy decisions made by the Chinese Communist regime.  Since the regime
 decided to adopt the Soviet model of industrialization and. concentrated investment
 in heavy industry, heavy industry quite naturally grew more rapidly than light.
 C.  The Leap Forward, 1958-1960
 During the "leap forward" (1958-1960), the average annual rate of growth in
 industrial production surged to 20 percent.  This growth was accompanied by a massive
 increase in industrial employment and by mass emulation campaigns requiring an
 intensity of work that could not be maintained.  The rate of growth dropped from 31
 percent in 1958 to 26 percent in 1959 and only 4 percent in 1960.

 Most of the growth in industrial production during the years 1958-1960 would
 have occurred, even without a "leap forward."  The acceleration of the existing
 industrial construction program during 1958 and 1959 resulted in large additions to
 capacity and a rapid growth in the net value of fixed capital assets.  For, example,
 of the 921 major industrial construction projects started during the First Five Year
 Plan, 428 were completed and, in normal operation by the end of 1957, and 109 went into
 partial operation. zJ  But in 1958 alone, a large number of new construction projects
 were started and 500 were completed. J  Merely putting these new plants into operation
 would have been enough to guarantee China substantial gains in industrial production.
 The true accomplishments in industry during these three years, therefore, were achieved
 in spite of the excesses of the "leap forward".
 In 1958-1959, industry grew at an average annual rate of 32 percent and
 handicrafts at 10 percent.  Within industry, the rates of growth were nearly as high
 as those achieved during the period of economic rehabilitation, but the range was not
 as wide.  The highest rate of growth was shown by the petroleum industry, which grew
 at 59 percent,. and the lowest was shown by the food industry, which grew at 15 percent.
 The most striking change in the pattern of rates of growth shown by the individual
 branches of industry was the rise in the position of the fuels industries.  Ranking the
 branches of industry by the rates of growth shown during the period of rehabilitation,
 the First Five Year Plan, and the "leap forward," it can been seen that the petroleum
 industry rose from fourth place in 1950-1952 to become the fastest growing branch of

 industry during the "leap foniard".  The electric power industry rose from eleventh
 place to second, and the coal industry rose from ninth to third.  Thus, the fuels
 industries became the three fastest growing branches of industry.
 D.    Recovery and Readjustment, 1.961--1965
 Total industrial production fell sharply in 1961 and continued to fall., although
 0-6a ve,                 6uf
 less sharply, in 1962.  Production in 1962 was slightlyn ff@MW
 the level. of 1957 JW only
 about 60 percent of the peak reached in 1960.  After the withdrawal of the Soviet
 technicians in mid-1960, the Chinese found they could not operate many of the key
 industrial plants that had been built as Soviet aid projects and were forced to close
 them down.  In light industry, the levels of output achieved during the "leap forward"
 could not be maintained because of the failure of agriculture to supply needed raw
 materials.  Even without these blows to the economy, however, the dislocation of
 industry, the exhaustion of the labor force, and the crisis in the food supply would
 probably have been severe enough to cause the collapse of the "leap forward".
 With the adoption of more pragmatic policies in 1962, industry began to recover.
 In each year since 1962, total industrial production has increased by about 10 percent
 reaching in 1965 a level slightly higher than that of 1958.  This growth, however, has
 been achieved by the gradual re-employment of capacity that had been installed during
 or prior to the "leap forward" rather than by the addition of new productive capacity.
 Because almost all idle capacity has now been put back into production, and because
 few capital construction projects have been undertaken since 1960, further increases in
 output will be more difficult to achieve than those of the 3 years, 1963-1965.

 The number of output series available for the years since 1960 is not large
 enough to permit estimates for individual branches of industry, but the series do
 indicate the general pattern of growth.  The output of primary energy is now about
 the level of 1958, but it is still far below the peak level of 1960.  The relative
 importance of the various sources of energy has changed.  Although coal still. provides
 the bulk of the primary energy, it has declined in relative importance.  In 1957 coal
 supplied 95 percent of all primary energy, but in 1965, it supplied, only 91 percent.
 Petroleum has risen from 2 percent in 1957 to 6 percent in 1965, and water power has
 remained at about 3 percent.
 By far,the most spectacular performance in the field of industrial materials
 has been shown by the chemical processing industry.  The output of chemical
 fertilizer in 1965 was more than five times that of 1957 and nearly double the
 previous peak level of 1960, and the Chinese claim that by 1963 the chemical processing
 industry had become the fourth largest branch, having risen from seventh place in
 1952- L I/       output of most industrial materials, however, is not yet back to the
 peak levels of 1959 or 1960.  The output of crude steel in 1965 was about equal to
 the volume of usable steel produced in 1959, and the output of cement and timber were
 at about the levels of 1958.
 There are not sufficient data to make a precise estimate for the metal
 'processing industry.  Output is certainly well above the level of 1957, but has probably
 not yet reached the level of 1958.  Output may be on the order of 30 to 40 percent.

 greater than that of 1957.  On balance, the output of heavy industry-as a whole in
 1965.; had not yet reached the level of 1959, although it probably exceeded the level
 of 1958.
 The level of output in light industry has recovered more slowly than heavy
 industry, because of the failure of agriculture to provide an adeguate.supply of
 raw materials.  The output of paper in 1965 was about 25 percent above the level of
 .1957 but still nearly 10 percent below that of 1958.  The output of cotton cloth was
 less than 80 percent of the output achieved in 1957.   Although the output of woolen
 and silk cloth has recovered more rapidly than that of cotton cloth and may be
 approaching peak levels, the textile industry as a whole is probably still below the
 level of 1957.,because of the importance of cotton cloth.  The food industry has
 recovered more rapidly than the textile industry.  The output of sugar has already
 exceeded the previous peak level achieved in 1959.  Sugar, however, is not typical
 of the food industry as a whole.  The aggregate output of the food industry is
 certainly above the level of 1.957 but has probably not yet reached the level of 1958.
 On balance, the output of light industry as a whole in 1965 was probably only slightly
 higher than the level of 1957.

 III.  A Comparison with Industrial.. Production in Other Countries
 To place the Chinese accomplishment in perspective, the average annual rates of
 growth of industrial production in Communist China are compared with those of the
 Soviet Union, Japan, and India in Table 1~.  The rate of growth achieved by Japan over
 the last 16 years (to 1965) is considerably higher than the rates of growth shown by
 .the other three countries.  Surprisingly, Communist China had the second highest rate
 of growth, exceeding slightly that shown by the Soviet Union.  By far the lowest rate
 i
 of growth of, these four countries is that shown by India.
 The rates of growth for the postwar period, however, are not satisfactory indicators
 of the relative performance of industry in these four countries) in part because of
 differences in the extent to which they had recovered from wartime i damage.  In 1949,
 for example, the level of production in Communist China was probably lower than it had
 been at any time since the early 1930's, whereas the Soviet Union had already regained
 its previous peak level of output.  It is clear, therefore, that the average annual
 rate of growth shown by Chinese industry only exceeded that of the Soviet Union
 because of the very large increases in output achieved during the period of economic
 rehabilitation.
 For this reason, the rates of growth for prewar to 1965 are also shown in Table 4.
 Over this longer period, the rates of growth are slower, their range is narrower, and
 their ranking is changed.  The Soviet Union shows that highest rate of growth, followed
 closely by Japan, with China and India trailing.  The two latter countries show almost
 the same rate of growth.

 The changes in the rates of growth that result from the inclusion of the prewar
 period are strongly affected by the wartime experience.  Industrial production in
 the Soviet Union, which reached. its peak level in 1940 or 191+1, had fallen to about
 one half of its peak level by 1945.  Industrial recovery, however, was rapid and
 output had regained its peak by 1911.9.  In Communist China, the peak level was probably
 not reached until 1943 or 1944, a time when the Japanese controlled most of the
 important industrial facilities.  Production collapsed in 1945 and continued to
 decline during the period of the civil war, probably falling to 40 percent of its
 peak in 1.949.  After the restoration of peace-and order in 191+9, industrial production
 recovered. very rapidly indeed, regaining its peak level by 1953.
 The Japanese experience was even more extreme than that of China.  Japan reached
 a peak in 1941 and remained at about-that level through 19411.  Because of the damage
 and severe curtailment of imports of raw materials sustained during the last two years
 of the war, production in 191-6 plummeted to only one fifth of its peak level.   Not
 only was the decline greater than that in the Soviet Union or China, but the rate of
 growth during the period of recovery-was slower and more erratic.  Japan did not
 regain her peak level of production until 1955.  The pattern of change in India is in
 marked contrast to that of the other three countries.  Industrial production in
 India, remained virtually unchanged between 1940 and 1950.  There was a slight decline
 in output in 191-6 and 1947, but output in 191.7 was only 12 percent below the peak
 level of 1945.

 In an attempt to allow for the differing impact of the war on the growth of indus-
 trial production in these countries, the average annual rates of growth have also
 been calculated for the period covering the year in which the previous peak level
 was regained through 1965.  These rates of growth are more typical of the recent. growth
 of industrial production than those for prewar to 1965 or for 19-9-1965.  The rates
 of growth are as high as those for 199-1965 and the range is as wide, but the upward
 bias due to the inclusion of the large increases in Chinese industrial production.
 during the period of economic rehabilitation is removed.
 Because a comparison of the pattern of change in the rates of growth from year to
 year is also of interest, the indexes of industrial production are--plotted in Chart 1.
 The chart shows that the growth of industrial production in Japan and India has been
 sustained and quite steady.  The growth of industrial production in the Soviet Union
 has also been sustained, but the rate of growth has been declining.  The growth of
 industrial production in Communist China, however, has been very erratic.

 IV.  A Comparison with Other Indexes of Chinese Industrial Production
 The growth of industrial production in Communist China has been measured in two
 other studies.  One of these was prepared by Chao Kang.      Chao constructed an index
 for the years 1949-1959 using the same type of weighting system that is used in the
 index presented in this paper.  The other study is part of a larger work by Liu Ta-
 chung and Yeh Kung-chia, who made estimates of value-added for the years 1933 and
 1952-1959? J  The rates of growth for total industrial production during the First
 Five Year Plan (1953-1957) as measured by the indexes presented in these two studies
 are very similar to that shown by my index.  A detailed comparison of the indexes,
 however, shows that the similarity in the rates of growth is due to compensating
 differences in concept, in coverage, and in estimates of physical output.
 One of the differences between my index and the Chao index is in coverage.  Chao's
 index includes two branches of industry not included in my index:  the nonferrous
 :.ii/- V5e  c-0,Tn7nocI I+!C5
 metals and they                      7f industries.  Another difference in coverage is
 that my index includes the entire metal processing industry, but Chao's includes
 only machine building, one of the three subbranches of the metal processing industry.
 A second difference is in concept.  Chao uses the largest possible sample to measure
 the rate of growth, whereas I exclude series for intermediate products consumed largely
 within the branch of industry in order to make the individual branch indexes approximate
 value-added as closely as possible.  In the ferrous metals industry, for example, I
 used only the output series for rolled steel, although data were available for the
 production of iron and manganese ore, pig iron, and crude steel.

 Approved For Release 2005/05/16 : CIA-RDP79TO1049AO03300100001-3
 Another difference is in estimates of j)h sical output.  Chao's index for the
 timber industry, for example, is derived from his estimates of the amount of timber
 cut, but his estimates understate the rate of growth in output because his figure
 for 1952 includes the timber cut by all timber enterprises, / whereas his-figures
 for 1955 and 1956 include only the timber cut by state-operated enterprises.
 The figure for 1957 also understates the output, but for a different reason.  It is
 a planned figure rather than the level of output actually achieved.'-o
 The principal difference between my index and the Liu-Yeh index is in coverage.
 The coverage of total industrial production ii both indexes is the same as the coverage
 of industry and handicrfts as defined by the State Statistical Bureau.  The State
 Statistical Bureau divides this universe into the following categories:
 Industry
 Modern Industry
 Factory Handicrafts
 Handicrafts
 Following the practice of the State Statistical Bureau, I have divided total
 industrial production into industry and handicrafts, but Liu and Yeh have not.  Instead
 they have divided total industrial production into the categories of factories,
 handicrafts, mining, and utilities.  If a small amount of handicraft mining is ignored,
 factories, mining, and utilities correspond closely to the official category of modern
 industry; and handicrafts (as defined by Liu and Yeh) corresponds to the official
 categories of factory handicrafts and handicrafts.

 Approved For Release 2005/05/16: CIA-RDP79TO1049AO03300100001-3
 Another important difference is in the method of estimation.   I based my index
 on a sample of commodities that I consider to be typical of the commodities produced
 by the various branches of industry.  But Liu and Yeh were forced to make estimates
 for the entire output of industry, because they wanted to measure the level as well
 as the trend.  They made direct estimates for those commodities that they could
 identify but had to make indirect estimates for the rest.    Although the actual
 computation was. a complicated process, conceptually the method used to estimate
 value-added involved. only four steps. The first was to adjust the official data on
 the gross value of industrial output from the official classification system to the
 system selected by the authors.  The second step was to identify as much of the physical
 content of each category as possible. For this purpose, a commodity was considered to
 be identified if both price and physical output were known or could be estimated.
 The third step was to divide the gross value of output for each category derived in
 step one into "identified" and "unidentified" portions.  The gross value of the
 identified commodities was the sum of price times quantity, and the gross value of
 the unidentified commodities was the residual.
 The fourth step was to estimate value-added.  The value-added by the identified
 commodities was estimated directly.  Because no data on value-added were available
 for 1952 or for any other year since 1949, data from two Japanese studies of industry
 in Northeast China in 1939 and 1943, respectively, were used.  The value-added by the

 Approved For Release 2005/05/16 : CIA-RDP79T01049AO03300100001-3
 unidentified commodities, however, had to be estimated indirectly.  These commodities
 were considered to be those successfully identified in 1933 but not identified for
 1952 or later years.  The estimates of value-added for the unidentified commodities
 were made by applying the average ratio of value-added to gross value for all
 unidentified commodities in 1933 to the gross value of the unidentified commodities
 derived in step three on the assumption that this ratio had not changed.  This
 procedure means, in effect, that real value is attributed to the double counting
 which results from methodological deficiencies in the compilation of official data
 on the gross value of industrial output.
 My index for the year 1957 is compared with the Chao and the Liu-Yeh indexes in
 Table 5.  There is substantial agreement between the three indexes for the growth of
 total industrial production, but the similarities in the aggregates conceal differences
 in detail.. The rate of growth shown by my index for industry is considerably higher
 than that shown by the Chao index and substantially lower than that shown by the Liu-
 Yeh index.                   For handicrafts, the divergence is even wider, but the ranking of the
 indexes is reversed:  my index grows more slowly than the Chao index but faster than
 the Liu-Yeh index.
 Within industry, the branch showing the greatest divergence, is the machine-building
 industry.   The rate of growth shown by the Liu-Yeh index for the machine-building

 industry is extremely high because it is based on the officially reported gross value
 data rather than on an independent calculation.  The full extent of the difference
 between my index and the Chao index for machine building is not shown by the index
 numbers for 1957.  In 1956, however, the Chao index is .351..3 whereas my index is only
 282.0.  The high rate of growth shown by the Chao index for the year 1956 appears to
 be the result of overweighting merchant vessels and including a number of very
 rapidly growing but relatively unimportant manufactured consumers goods.
 For the years 1958-1959, the divergence between the three indexes for total
 industrial production, for industry, and for handicrafts is greater than in the
 earlier years.  A detailed comparison of the indexes cannot be made easily, however,
 because Chao does"slot present indexes by branch of industry and because Liu and Yeh
 leave gaps in their estimates.  Liu and Yeh, for example, do not present data on the
 machine-building industry for these years.     If 1957 is taken as 100, the three
 indexes for 1959 are:

 V.  The Prospects for Industry During the Third Five Year Plan, 1966-1970
 The prospects for industry in Communist China during the Third Five Year Plan
 (1966-1970) are a matter of great concern, not only in China, but throughout the
 Western world.  The current political turmoil in China, however, makes any attempt
 to forecast the growth of industrial production over the next five years unusually
 hazardous.
 The current cultural revolution was not originally planned for economic reasons.
 Important documents such as the Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese
 Communist Party on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution .II   or the Conuriunique
 of the eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee 12  (held on 1-12 August
 1966) make only passing references to economic matters.  But there are already rumors
 to the effect that production has declined, at least in some enterprises, because of
 the time and energy required of managers and workers alike for demonstrations, parades,
 and endless meetings to discuss the thought of Mao Tse-tung. 1,
 Since early September 1966, the regime has been concerned with the impact of the
 cultural revolution on production.  The front-page editorial in Jen-min jih-pao on
 September 7th stated that production must not be interrupted.  Workers were instructed
 to stay at their jobs, and the Red Guards were cautioned not to interfere.  The
 frequency with which'these themesh3L%e been repeated by national and provincial news
 media indicates that the concern is genuine.  Production has been affected already,

 Approved For Release 2005/05/16 : CIA-RDP79T01049A003300100001-3
 but it is not yet clear whether the cultural revolution will spill over directly into
 the field of economics.  Statements such as the following have appeared frequently
 in the Chinese press:
 The unprecedented scale of the present great cultural revolution
 necessarily presages a flying leap in the development of our
 Socialist revolution and a new great leap forward in Socialist
 construction. 14
 The tone of these statements has le;d to the speculation that the Third Five Year Plan
 may be superseded just as the Second Five Year Plan was superseded by the "leap forward."
 If a new leap were in the making, one would expect to see drastic increases in
 targets and production claims, and in fact, recent claims are strongly reminiscent of
 those made in 1958~`''and 1959.  For example, the claims that industrial production in
 the first eight months of 1966 increased by 20 percent over the corresponding period
 of last year and that the increase in the output of various industrial commodities
 ranged from 40 percent to 200 percent 15  appear to be unreasonably high.  But there
 is, as yet, no evidence that targets have been raised.
 On balance, it does not now appear likely that the Chinese Communists will attempt
 a new leap, but given the current political instability, it is not impossible.  If
 they did, however, it would be doomed to failure.  Industrial production might spurt
 ahead briefly, but any new leap would undoubtedly collapse.  The collapse would be
 worse than that of 1961-1962 because the Chinese do not have the cushion now that
 they had in 1958 and the population has increased by some 100 million persons..

 Industrial production has increased at about 10 percent annually during the last
 three years and has regained the level achieved in 19;8, but even without a new "leap
 forward" or the disruptions of the cultural revolution, the Chinese would not be
 able to maintain such a high rate of growth.  The increases in production during
 this period of readjustment have been based on the re-employment of existing capacity.
 Very little new capacity has been installed since the collapse of the "leap forward"
 in 1960, and the margin for investment is small.
 The chief determinants of the growth in industrial production over the next few
 years will be the manner in which the limited resources available for investment and
 defense are allocated and the performance of agriculture.  If the limited resources
 available, the scarce materials and skilled manpower, continue to be concentrated in
 the weapons program, the output of heavy industry will expand only slowly.
 Most of the capacity not now in production is concentrated in light industry,
 especially in textiles, but the failure of agricultural production to keep up with
 the increase in population means that agriculture will not be able to supply the raw
 materials necessary for light industry.  The output of industrial crops will continue
 to be sacrificed in favor of food crops. Continued weak performance of agriculture
 will mean that light industry will not grow rapidly and that the output of many light
 industrial products probably will not reach their previous peak levels during the
 Third Five Year Plan.

 In. summary, the drain of the weapons program of heavy industry and the dependence
 of light industry on agricultural raw materials would seem to preclude a rapid rate
 of growth during the Third Five Year Plan.  Simply to regain the level of production
 achieved in 1960 by the end of the Third Five Year Plan, industrial production will
 have to grow at a rate in excess of 5 percent annually.  If the Chinese do not
 attempt a new leap, they probably can maintain a rate of growth. of 5 percent and
 may well regain the previous peak level of industrial production by 1970, but the
 misguided economic policies of the "leap forward" will have cost China a full decade's
 industrial growth.

 Appendix A
 Description of the Index
 The index of industrial production in Communist China presented in this paper
 was calculated primarily from data on the physical output of final products, although
 some intermediate products were included where data on final products were not
 available.  These physical output series were weighted in three stages to form the
 indexes for the individual branches of industry, the indexes for industry. and handicrafts,
 and the index for total industrial production.
 1.   The Physical Output Data
 Both the coyerage and the accuracy of the physical output data are more adequate for
 the period of economic recovery (19+9-1952) and the First Five Year Plan (1953-1957)
 than for the 'leap forward" (1958-1960) or for the recent period of readjustment
 (1961-1965).  The index for the earlier years was based on a sample of 33 commodities
 produced by industrial enterprises and 8 commodities produced by handicrafts.  These
 data were drawn primarily from official sources.  It is believed that these data are
 reasonably accurate and that their coverage is sufficiently broad for index to be used
 with confidence.
 For the years 1958-1959, estimates were available for 25 commodities produced by
 industrial enterprises and 6 commodities produced by handicrafts.  Because of the
 deterioration in the quality of the items produced and the tendency of official sources
 32 -

 to exaggerate achievements in production during the "leap forv;ard", published data
 had been
 were not accepted until they       checked against other ava-flable information and
 A
 adjusted as necessary.  Specifically, "backyard" production of steel was not included
 in the physical output data, and the claims for production of coal were reduced to take
 account of exaggeration in the official data and the low calorific value of the coal.
 Although allowances were made, there may still be a small upward bias in the index for
 this period.
 For the years 1960-196 5 estimates were available for only 10 commodities,16 and it
 was not possible to separate the production of industrial enterprises from that of
 handicrafts.  Because these estimates are subject to a wider range of error than the
 data for earlier years and because the size of the sample is greatly reduced, the
 index for these years is less reliable than it is for the years before 1960.  It
 should be regarded as providing only a .general   indication of the
 trend in production.
 II.  The Construction of the Index
 A.  For the Years 1949-1959
 Indexes showing the growth of production for individual branches of industry,
 for industry and handicrafts, and for total industrial production during the years

 1.  Industry
 The index of production for industry was constructed from Chinese data on
 the physical output of 33 commodities produced by 11 branches of industry.  These
 data were weighted in two stages.  In the first stage the output series were grouped
 by branch of industry and indexes were calculatedr'for each branchLseparately   The
 j
 indexes for seven branches of industry -- electric power, coal, petroleum, ferrous
 each
 metals, building materials, timber, and paper -- are based on a single commodity.  For
 the electric power, coal, timber and paper industries, production is relatively
 homogeneous, and a single output series includes the entire production of the branch.
 For the ferrous metals industry, only the output series for the production of rolled
 steel was used.  Although data were available for the production. of iron and manganese
 ore, pig iron, and crude steel, these commodities were not included, because they
 are intermediate products which are almost entirely consumed within the industry.
 For the petroleum and the building materials industries, the only commodities for
 which data were available are crude oil and cement, respectively.  The indexes for the
 remaining branches of industry -- metal processing, chemical processing, textiles,
 and food -- were based on a sample of the commodities produced by these branches
 weighted by their respective prices.
 Construction of the index for the metal processing industry presented a
 special problem.  The metal processing industry is divided into the machine building,
 -35-

 Approved For Release 2005/05/16.: CIA-RDP79TO1049AO03300100001-3
 the metal products, and the repair subbranches, but the conrnodities for which output
 data are available were all produced by the machine building subbranch.  These
 commodities cannot be considered typical of the metal. processing industry as a whole,
 because machine building grew half again as fast as metal products and repair during
 the First Five Year Plan.
 For the years 1952-1957 the index for the metal processing industry was
 constructed in two steps.  First, an index for the machine building subbranch was
 calculated from the physical output data, and, second, this index was adjusted for
 coverage on the basis of the reported gross value data for the machine building
 subbranch and for the metal processing industry as a whole.  For the years 19+9-1951
 and 1958-59 this procedure could not be used, because the sample of physical output
 data was restricted to a small number of products that grew much faster than was
 typical of the machine building subbranch as a whole.  For the years 19JE9-1951 the
 index was computed by adjusting the official data to allow for the difference in the
 rates of growth showing during the First Five Year Plan by the official index of
 gross value and the estimated index of value added.  For the years 1958-1959 it was
 assumed that production increased at one-half of the officially claimed rate of growth,
 because the upward bias in the official data on the gross value of industrial production
 increased markedly during the "leap forward".

 In the second stage of aggregation an index for industry as a whole was
 obtained by      combining   the indexes for the individual branches.  The weights employed
 for the aggregation of the branch indexes were estimates of the values added in 1956
 that were computed from wage bill paid to workers employed in industry.  The wage
 bill was computed from data on average earnings and average employment.  If data on. the
 wage bill had been available in sufficient detail, the. value added per unit of output
 could have.been used directly as the weight for each commodity, but these data were
 available only for branches of industry, not for individual commodities.
 Handicrafts
 The index of handicraft production was constructed from Chinese data on
 the physical output of 8 commodities.  For the years 1949-1957 these data were weighted
 by their respective prices.  The years 1958 and 1959 presented a special problem
 because the output data for coal and pig iron include the output produced by mass
 campaigns and are not comparable to the output data for the earlier years.  For these
 was constructed
 years the index was constructed in two steps.  First, an index/baeed on the six
 commodities for which output data comparable to that for the earlier years are
 available;                     and second, this index was adjusted to alloy for the
 difference between its rate of growth and that shovm by the full index of handicraft

 3.  Total industrial Production
 In the third stage of aggregation the index of total industrial production
 was obtained by combining the indexes for industry and handicrafts.  An independent
 estimate of the values added in industry and handicrafts could not be used as weights
 because the data on the earnings of handicraft workers necessary to calculate the
 weights were not available and could not be estimated.  A separate estimate of the
 values added by industry and handicrafts is presented in Table   7 . This estimate is
 based on an adjustment of Chinese Communist data for the net value of total industrial
 production in 1955-
 B.  For the Years 1960-196,.;
 in Table 8
 The system of weights used to calculate the inc?x for the years 1949-1959 was
 not used for the years 1960-1965 because handicraft production could not be separated
 from the production of industrial enterprises and becau.-  the number of physical
 output series for which estimates are available was gre~,..ly reduced.  For example, no
 complete output series is available for the metal pros.,--ing industry and only a
 single series is available for such important branches     industry as textiles and food.
 The procedure used was to weight the 10 series for whi:.':_ estimates of physical output are
 available by their respective prices, and then to adju."   the resulting index for the
 difference between its rate of growth and that shown b.-,  `,ie index of total industrial
 production for the years 1953--1957.  The details of UP.". adjustment are shown in Table 8

 complete statistical coverage, but at fi.rst'it was effective only in those state
 and joint state-private enterprises that were operated by the ministries of the
 central government.  The reporting system, However, was expanded gradually and included
 Jall industrial enterprises by the end of 1956.
 The first annual communique of the State Statistical Bureau was issued in 1953.
 The data presented on the production of industrial commodities were for the state and
 joint state-private enterprises only and were given in the form of index numbers or
 percentage increases rather than as absolute numbers.  Indexes for the years 19119-1952
 were presented for 15 commodities and percentage increases in 1952 for an additional
 15 commodities.  In 19544, a communiqud was issued for 1953 and the communiqu6 for 1952
 was revised, but no absolute data on the production of industrial commodities were
 included.
 The year 1955 emerges as a turning point in the quantity and quality of statistical
 data produced.  The 1951E communiqu6 of the State Statistical Bureau (published in 1955)
 still presented production claims in the form of percentage increases, but a short
 statistical abstract was published for the first time.  This abstract contained
 absolute data on the_ production of 11+ industrial commodities for the pre-Communist peak
 year, for 191+9, and for 1952-1951E.  And finally, the First Five Year Plan for. Develop-
 ment of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China was published in
 August 1955.  The plan contained data on the production of 4.6 industrial commodities,

 the largest number to be included in any single sou ce.  These data were on production
 in 1952 and targets for 1957.  Annual comsiurnique`s and :sip tisti_cal_ abstracts for 1955
 and 1956 were also published in 1956 and 1957, respectively.
 In the period of the "leap for:7ard" (1958-196o), reliable statistics continued
 to be published for the years through. 1957.  The to r_j~,  , reliable sources of
 information on industrial production in Communist China ti, ere both published during
 this period.  They are:

 Textile, and Paper industries -- Past and Pre- .  t-), Peiping, 195d; and
 State Statistical Bureau, Wei-ta ti shih-nien       Ten Great Years),
 Peiping, 1959.
 The data released for the years 1958-1960, however, are not of the same quality as
 those released for the earlier years, and after 1958 thv number of commodities for
 which data are available decreased. rapidly.  Targets an-.claims were doubled. and
 redoubled, and the data for this period had to be discounted heavily in important
 cases.
 Since the 2nd Session of the 2nd National People's Cccagress met in April 1960,
 no significant body of statistical data has been publishei.  The regime admitted in
 December 1960 that major light industrial commodities which depend on agriculture for
 raw. materials, such as cotton textiles, vegetable oils,
 r, and cigarettes, would

 fall short of their targets for the year, but claimed that targets for heavy industrial
 commodities would be overfulfilled, and tha ; industrial production on the whole had
 continued its leap forward.  Actual data, however.,, were not released.
 In the period of recovery and readjustment (1961-1965), data on industrial produc-
 tion were extremely scarce.  The single most important source of information during
 this period was Chou En-lai's speech to the 1st Session of the 3rd National People's
 Congress on December 21-22, 1964.   In this speech, Chou claimed that the output of
 Ynaj 0 r   inc(v5-+ f iad cornhlodl b  s---
 ^steel, petroleum, chemical fertilizers, cement, motor vehicles, cotton yarn, sugar,
 and cigarettes Aall increased by at least 20 percent over the level of 1963.  These
 by the Chinese Communist regime. The estimates for individual industrial commodities
 vary considerably, but they all present a picture of collapse followed by gradual
 recovery.

 The Soviet Union has also started to publish its estimates of the output of
 industrial commodities in Communist China.  Since the Sino-Soviet dispute, Soviet
 authors no longer have the benefit of special access to Chinese sources, but their
 estimates are useful because they are derived' independently.  The Soviet estimates
 show the same pattern of collapse and recovery shown by the estimates of Western
 scholars.  Both the Soviet and the Western estimates are reproduced in Appendix C.
 No volume on the Third Five Year Plan (1966-1970) had been published as of
 October 1966.  No base figures for 1965 or targets for 1970 have been released, and
 there have not even been references to the percentage increases planned for the five
 year period. On October 1, 1.966, however, it was claimed that industrial production
 in the first eight months of 1966 increased by 20 percent over the corresponding period
 of last year and that the increase in the output of various industrial commodities
 ranged from 40 to 200 percent.  These claims, in some ways reminiscent of those made
 during the "leap forward", appear to be unreasonably high, but cannot be evaluated
 until a larger body of data has been collected.

 7-                    "Daily-use commodities" does not appear to be an officially designated branch of
 industry, because it is not listed in any published version of the Chinese
 Communist industrial classification system.  When the Chinese discuss consumer
 goods, however, they frequently divide them into commodities to eat, commodities
 to wear, and commodities to use, and this last category is referred to as jih-
 Yung-p'ing (commodities for daily use).  But each of the 11 groups included in
 this category by Chao I-wen in Hsin chung-kuo ti kung-yeh (The Industry of New
 China), Peiping, 1957, corresponds to a branch or subbranch listed in the 1956
 Abridged Classification of Industrial Branches (see State Statistical Bureau,
 Kung-yeh t'ung-chi-hsffeh chiang-i  Lectures on the Study of Industrial Statistical,
 Peiping, 1958, pp. 32-35).  This identification of the groups means that
 "commodities for daily use" is not a separate branch of industry, but merely a
 convenient way to refer to those consumer goods that are neither eaten nor worn.

 the Number 1~Textile Mill in Peiping had dropped by 360,000 meters a month because
 of activities undertaken in connection with the cultural revolution.  The loss
 was attributed specifically to absenteeism by members of the Red Guard, who
 constituted over one-third of the workers at the mill.
