 For three years the educational system in Communist
 China has been totally disrupted and out of production.
 University and middle school students closed their class-
 rooms or converted them into revolutionary headquarters
 to spend their time in Red Guard activism.   The school
 system was scorned, administrators and teachers humiliated,
 and intellectuals deprived of status and respect.   It
 appears likely that the "radicalization" of curriculum,
 faculty, and students will continue for some time. to the
 detriment of objective research and teaching.
 The findings of this study,  in broad terms,        are
 that "educational revolution" is basically a function of
 Mao's distrust of the intellectual and his desire to create
 a Yew Chinese Man.  This new man, the "revolutionary suc-
 cessor," is primarily a product of his education.                              Mao
 believes that in the past Liu Shao-chi and others dis-
 torted and emasculated educational reforms designed to
 create the New Chinese Man.   This belief of Mao's, to
 some extent true, led Mao to launch a wholesale assault
 on the educational system as part of  the Cultural
 Revolution.
 In the past, Mao's search for fanatical devotion
 has led to a compromise of academic quality in favor of
 political reliability.   The same is likely to be true in
 the present instance  because the educational system is
 asked to serve conflicting goals.   The main thrust of
 the current reforms is to cut down the time spent in
 formal education and to revise the curricula to produce
 more narrowly trained specialists.   If the emphasis on
 ideological purity is maintained as the primary purpose

 coming on the heels of three years with practically
 no education whatsoever.   If, on the other hand, empha-
 sis is placed on the concrete application of revised
 curricula and their substantive content, then the impact
 of the Cultural Revolution could be somewhat mitigated.

 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND EDUCATION IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 The effect of the cultural revolution upon educa-
 tion in China has had two major facets, each with its
 own specific outcomes.                                    First,  the cultural revolution
 has thus far denied thrae years of formal education to
 all school-age individuals, and it has shattered the
 educational system.   The denial of education to students
 and potential students means that some 340,000 students
 will graduate from an institution of higher learning
 without completing . formal course of study, and approxi-
 mately half a million students will either enter such
 institutions without adequate high school preparation
 (by Chinese standards), or will fail to enter at all.
 Many more thousands of students will "graduate" from
 high school without completing their formal training.
 Second, the student-teacher relationship at all
 levels of the educational process has been effectively
 destroyed by a combination of Red Guard terrorism and
 the deliberate downgrading of teachers by the regime
 through the so-called take-over of education by workers
 and peasants.   Curriculum reform, of which we have but
 a few glimmerings at this time, will undoubtedly round
 out  the destruction by seriously reducing the amount of
 basic information and systematic analysis of information
 disseminated through the educational process.   Thus the
 core of China's educational system has been deliberately
 sacrificed to the ideals of Mao Tse-tung's particular
 utopia.
 Th9 nullification of the educational system was,
 and is, a deliberate political act demonstrating one of
 Mao Tse-tung's most immutable values:   that intellectuals
 have proclivities that make them suspect as members of
 Mao's ideal society.  Mao's long-standing distrust
 of the intellectual is based upon the realization

 that the core of China's intelligentsia was educated in
 the West.   Thus the intellectual is either the product
 of a "bourgeois" society or, for graduates since 1949,
 the product of an educational system dominated by the'
 "bourgeois" intellectual and therefore probably contam-
 inated by non-proletarian ideology.   Students educated
 in the Soviet Union are, for obvious reasons, equally
 suspect.   Mao's deep-rooted suspicion of the intellec-
 tual comes into conflict with another of his major goals;
 the rapid industrialization of China in order to achieve
 great power status for the People's Republic.   To achieve
 this goal China needed to develop the technical and
 managerial skills upon which the modern industrialized
 state is built.   Such skills are the product of the edu-
 cational system of the society that seeks to create them,
 and are held and manipulated by individuals whose values
 tend to be pragmatic and universalistic.   Such values
 are anathema to Mao Tse-tung.
 The long-range goal of Mao was  [and remains] to
 politicize the intellectuals who were a product of the
 West, and to educate a new Chinese intellectual who was
 both politically reliable and professionally expert--the
 ideal-type of the intellectual has been defined by the
 regime as "Fed and Expert."   As the educational system
 was dominated by Western-trained minds,  the politiciza-
 tion of the older intellectuals and of the next genera-
 tion of intellectuals had to be carried out by agents
 external to the educational system.   Prior to the cul-
 tural revolution,  this agent was the Chinese Communist
 Party which attempted to assert absolute control over
 all facets of the educational system.
 The Party's control of the system extended from
 the Ministries of Education and Higher Education down to
 every school in the nation.   The representatives of the
 Party in a given school wielded more influence over the
 institution's processes than professional educators.   The
 Party controlled curriculum content, faculty appointments
 and promotions, student activities, and all other phases
 of education and related programs.   Beyond this, political
 indoctrination permeated the content of the curriculum,
 with specific periods set aside for small group discus-
 sions of political affairs, ideological training, and

 current problems.   The student daily regimen, from dawn
 until dusk--literally--was under the strict control of
 the Party.
 To the extent that Mao believed the educational
 system had failed to achieve his goals,  the Party had
 failed.   The story of the cultural revolution is the
 history of a Party purge, and the interaction between
 the cultural revolution and China's educational system
 is primarily one of a struggle to achieve political
 goals.

 Prologue:   Mao and the Intellectual
 In his address to the Yenan Conference of Writers
 and Artists in May of 1942, Mao Tse-tung gave a clear
 expression of his attitude toward the intellectual.
 Furthermore, in describing his personal experience as a
 student, Mao stated clearly the contempt he felt (and
 still feels) for the elitist attitudes of the intel-
 ligentsia:
 Let me tell you of my own experience;  let
 me tell you how my feelings toward the people
 changed.   I was once a student, and in school
 I acquired student habits and manners.   For
 instance,  I was embarrassed when  I had to
 carry my bags on a bamboo pole in the presence
 of my fellow students.   They were so refined
 that they could not stand having any weight
 press upon their shoulders and disdained the
 very thought of carrying anything in their
 hands!   At that time I was convinced that
 only intellectuals were clean, that workers,
 peasants, and soldiers were unclean.  I
 would therefore readily borrow clothes from
 an intellectual, but never from a worker, or
 a peasant, or a soldier because I  thought
 that their clothes would be unclean.
 During the revolution I began to live
 among workers, peasants, and soldiers.
 Gradually I began to know them, and they
 also began to know me.   Then,  and then only,
 did the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois senti-
 ments inculcated in me by bourgeois schools
 change fundamentally!   Ever since then, when-
 ever I compare unreformed intellectuals with
 workers, peasants, and soldiers,  I realize
 that not only were the minds of those intel-
 lectuals unclean but their bodies were also
 unclean.   The cleanest people in the world
 are the workers and peasants.   Even though
 their hands may be soiled and their feet

 smeared with cow dung,  nevertheless they
 are cleaner than the bourgeoisie and the
 petty-bourgeoisie.   That is what I mean
 by a transformation of sentiments--a
 changing o'er from one class to another.
 Mao's concern with the elitist attitudes of the
 Chinese intellectual stems not only from his goal of
 achieving an egalitarian society and his basic distrust
 of the "bourgeois" background of the intellectual, but
 also from the status accorded the intelligentsia in
 Imperial China.   Traditionally, the scholar-gentry formed
 the backbone of the imperial political system, and the
 value structure of Chinese society established the scholar-
 gentry as the ruling elite.   Mao is convinced that if his
 revolution is to succeed, the legitimacy granted to the
 scholar-gentry has to be transferred to the Chinese Com-
 munist Party.
 Social revolutions are directed against elites
 which function as a ruling class, and the value structures
 that legitimize them.   Mao knew in 1942 that the political
 poi;;er of a leadership group does not automatically guarantee
 prestige--the esteem and respect of the members of the
 society.   Certainly the Party can rule without prestige,
 but without prestige another stratum of society can either
 explicitly or implicitly challenge the ruling group for
 authority within the society.   The intellectuals in China
 form a social elite that carries with it, by definition,
 prestige.   Mao's consistent distrust of the intelligentsia
 is based upon his understanding that traditional values
 still exist in the society, and that esteem for the intel-
 lectual constitutes an implicit challenge to the authority
 of the Party.
 The challenge to the laity is located in the
 society's esteem for the intellectual, but it is in the
 functions the intellectual performs for the society and
 the state that his leadership role becomes explicit.
 Apart from his obvious role as the managerial and tech..
 nical expert, the intellectual also functions as the
 specific agent transmitting s;'stematic knowledge to the
 society through the educational process.   Thus the intel-
 lectual, regardless of the suspicion and fear with which

 he is viewed by the poiitic al leadership,  is performing
 critical functions for the state and the society.   The
 significance of the intellectual and his role in society
 can be seen by members of the society from the primary
 school to the specialized institutes for research and
 development.
 Mao has attempted to curb the influence of the
 intellectual by establishing the Party as an independent
 politicization and control agent in the educational system,
 by attempting to recruit intellectuals into the Party,
 and by establishing a "watch-dog" organizational structure
 in industry.   Similarly, since the earliest days in Yenan,
 the Party has engaged in campaigns designed to inculcate
 political reliability in the intellectual while attempt-
 ing to downgrade his status in the society.   The events
 of the cultural revolution,  however, are the clearest
 indication that 26 years after Mao's speech at Yenan the
 intellectual has yet to become a trusted ally in the con-
 tinuing social revolution, and that Mao's basic fear of
 the intellectual is still one of his most deeply-held
 convictions.   Furthermore,  it appears that the impact of
 the cultural revolution uoon the intellectuals will be
 greater than Mao's punitive reaction to the period of
 "blooming and contending" in May of 1957.

 I.   EDUCATION IN COMMUNIST CHINA:
 THE PRELUDE TO THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 The fear and suspicion that characterizes Mao's view
 of the intelligentsia as a stratum in China's society has
 had a marked effect on the regime's policies for education.
 The value conflict between the necessity of developing a
 society capable of creating a modernized, industrialized
 state, while at the same time producing a politically
 reliable citizen imbued with the proper "revolutionary
 spirit" has led to considerable variation in educational
 policies.   The basic goal of combining professional
 expertise and political reliability is not beyond the
 capacity of most educational systems;  all societies use
 the educational system as a major agent of political
 socialization.   China, however, like many other moderniz-
 ing states, is faced with the problem of imbuing its
 citizens with values significantly at variance with those
 of the pre-industrial and pre-revolutionary period.   As
 the parents of the new generation were schooled under
 the pre-Communist regime, their ability to politically
 socialize their children into the new value structure
 is not high.   The primary responsibility for political
 socialization is therefore placed in the hands of the
 schools.
 The distinct problem for China, however, is that
 the degree of political socialization required goes far
 beyond that which is necessary for simple loyalty to the
 state.   It requires a commitment to Mao and the Party
 that can best be described as a requirement for fanaticism;
 thus, the Chinese educational system is charged with
 producing citizens with both specific levels of expertise
 and a fanatical commitment to Mao Tse-tung.

 Education and Politics:   The Great Leap Forward
 In many ways, the educational "reforms" introduced
 during the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60 reflect the more
 extreme views of Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese leadership
 and were definite harbingers of the reforms introduced
 during the cultural revolution.   Indeed, current report-
 ing in the Chinese press and radio broadcasts refer con-
 sistently to this origin of the present policies.   In
 1958, the educational system was instructed to expand
 its facilities to accommodate a 45 percent increase in
 the number of students in the academic year 1958-59--a
 "leap" from 441,000 students enrolled in colleges and
 universities in 1957-58 to a projected 800,000 in 1958-59.
 The number of students with worker-peasant backgrounds
 was also to be significantly increased, and to aid in
 the development of an egalitarian society, students were
 to combine formal academic training with productive labor.
 Manual labor had been the lot of Chinese students for
 some time, but the new emphasis placed by the regime on
 this aspect of its policy indicated that once more the
 distinction between mental work and physical labor, and
 the elitist attitudes fostered by the former, were to
 come under attack.  The attack was to take the common
 form of glorifying manual labor and those who performed
 this labor.   Furthermore, by sending students to the com-
 munes and factories to participate in manual labor under
 the direction of the peasant and worker,  the industrial
 and agricultural worker was given official status as a
 "teacher." A State Council directive of September 1958
 described the policy this way:
 The Party line in educational work seeks
 to make education serve the proletariat
 politically and to unite education with
 productive labor.   In order to implement
 this line, educational work must be led
 by the Party.  Marxist-Leninist political
 and ideological indoctrination must be
 carried out in all schools to indoctrinate
 the teachers and students with the class

 view-point of the working class:   the mass
 view-point, the labor view-point, or the
 view-point calling for the integration
 of mental labor with physical labor, and
 the dialectical materialist view-point.
 The future direction is for schools to run
 factories and farms, and for factories and
 agricultural cooperatives to establish
 schools...
 In accordance with this directive and others,  the
 educational system not only sent millions of students
 to the fields and factories, but also began to develop
 "part-work, part-study" schools.   In a parallel develop-
 ment during 1959 and 1960, schools and universities
 created ancillary factories and work-shops, while the
 larger factories established general education facilities.
 The communes began to establish "part-farming,  part-study"
 schools where the students would spend part of the day
 studying and the other part laboring in the fields.
 These programs suffered severe cutbacks after 1960 when
 the extremes of the Great Leap Forward combined with
 administrative ineptitude and natural disasters to create
 an economic and political crisis.
 Education and Politics:   1960-1962
 Following the disaster of the Great Leap Forward
 and the withdrawal of Soviet technicians in 1960,  there
 was a short period of retrenchment in educational policy
 as the Chinese attempted to lift themselves up by their
 boot-straps.   The extent to which Mao's more extreme
 views were being modified can be seen in an article writ-
 ten by Kao Chih-kuo,  1st Secretary of the Party Committee
 for Yunnan University, and published in the Kwangming
 Daily of 7 April 1961.   This same article was reprinted
 in the People's Daily a week later.   Kao wrote:

 with productive labor is not to mean at

 all that work in schools need not center
 on teaching, for it must ...In the midst
 of great leaps forward, all undertakings
 are required to leap forward.   Everybody
 wants to forge ahead.   Manpower is needed
 everywhere.  Schools are required to send
 students to take part in labor.   How are
 we to deal with this?   Obviously, this
 question needs serious consideration.   In
 the first place, we must not forget that
 our schools are schools, in which the
 normal order in teaching and learning must
 not be disturbed at random.  Those students
 who should be sent to take part in labor
 outside must do so without failure.   Those
 who should not be sent must remain.   Fewer
 students should be sent if fewer are required.
 Wherever possible, the sending of students
 to take part in labor outside must be delayed.
 ..To enable students to digest and consolidate
 the knowledge they have acquired and to train
 their ability of independent contemplation,
 they must be assured of adequate time for
 private studies and exercise.
 Kuo's article was strongly worded, but its repub-
 lication by People's Daily indicated the extent to which
 educational policy was being modified in the aftermath
 of the Great Leap Forward.   The over-emphasis on manual
 labor and intensive political indoctrination that ac-
 companied the Great Leap Forward drastically lowered
 China's academic standards, but the years 1960-62 were
 marked by attempts to tighten academic standards, close
 questionable and inefficient schools, and restore the
 dignity of teachers and college faculties.   By the end
 of 1962, however, the regime--or at least Mao Tse-tung--
 began to feel that the pendulum had swung too far the
 other way.

 Education and the 10th Plenum of the Central Committee:
 September 1962
 At the 10th Plenum of the Central Committee held
 in August-September 1962, Mao began to reassert the
 attitudes and positions that were so apparent during the
 Great Leap Forward.  Of particular significance to this
 analysis was the concern Mao expressed for the problem
 of "revolutionary successors" and intellectual dissidence.
 Concerning youth and revolutionary successors, Mao said:
 This country of ours must grasp well,
 know well, and study well this question.
 We must acknowledge that classes and class
 struggles will exist for a long time to
 come, and that the reactionary classes
 may stage a comeback.   We must heighten
 our vigilance and successfully educate
 the young people, the cadres, and the
 masses...
 ...If our sons go revisionist and take
 the opposite course,  then although ours
 is still called a socialist country,  it is
 actually a capitalist one.... Therefore,
 from now on, we must discuss the matter
 every year, every month, every day.   We
 must discuss it at every general meeting,
 every Party Congress and every plenary
 session, so that we may take a more sober
 Marxist-Leninist line on this question.
 Mao's obvious concern with regard to the young successors
 to his revolution was complemented by a remark later in
 the same speech directed at anti-Party dissidence among
 the intellectuals:
 Isn't the writing of novels the fashion of
 the day now?  The use of novels to carry out
 anti-Party activities is a great invention.
 To overthrow a political power, it is always
 necessary first of all to create public

 opinion,  to do work in the ideological
 sphere.   This is true for the revolution-
 ary class as well as for the counterrevolu-
 tionary class...
 Mao clearly demonstrated both his concern over the youth
 who would inherit the revolution and his apprehensiveness
 about the political reliability of the intellectuals.
 These two thoughts were intimately connected, though,
 in that China's youth were being educated by the same
 stratum of society that was producing anti-Party novels.
 Mao was clearly concerned, as his later policies demon-
 strated, over the probability that the students, as they
 progressed through the educational system, would be in-
 fected by "bourgeois" intellectual attitudes.  Mao's con-
 cern was far wider than just the students, and the after-
 math of the 10th Plenum was a general tightening of
 political controls at all levels of the state and society.
 Within this general tightening, however, the student--as
 a specific target--was to receive particular emphasis.
 The Socialist Education Campaign:   1962-1965
 The 10th Plenum gave birth to the Socialist Educa-
 tion Campaign, a movement that, in Mao's words, was aimed
 at "educating man anew and reorganizing our revolutionary
 ranks."  In application, the Socialist Education Campaign
 was an attempt to re-indoctrinate the Chinese people and
 reorganize the structures of the state.  With such an
 ambitious goal, and given the state of disillusionment
 and cynicism that afflicted China in 1962, such a campaign
 would of necessity be rigorous to the point of cruelty
 and many-faceted to reflect the complexity of a state
 and society in the middle stages of modernization and in-
 dustrialization.   Within this campaign, China's youth,
 especially the educated youth, were to be a specific
 target.
 In fact, the Socialist Education Campaign among
 youth was a continuation of a program that had come into
 existence in the latter half of 1960.   By January 1962,

 the press had begun to stress an ideological education
 campaign through which China's youth were to recall the
 hardships of pre-1949 China and study the "revolutionary
 traditidns" of the new.   Mao obviously believed that this
 campaign was far from successful, but the Socialist Educa-
 tion Campaign was to prove equally unsuccessful.   In July
 1963, China Youth could still report that, when asked to
 recall the e!iffering of the old society and not to forget
 the source of good in the new society, cynical youth could
 yet reply, "There is no source to forget."
 Mao himself was equally aware of the basic failure
 of the Socialist Education Campaign, and in his July 1964
 polemic "On Khrushchev's Phony Communism and its Histori-
 cal Lessons for the World," he again raised the question
 of "revolutionary successors."  This question, Mao wrote,
 is "...a matter of life and death for our Party and our
 country."  Mao set forth five criteria for the selection
 of successors, but most significant was that they "come
 forward in mass struggles and are tempered in great
 storms of revolution."  Later events have demonstrated
 that Mao had every intention of giving China's students
 the opportunity to be tested in mass struggles, but for
 the moment he was to settle for a less ambitious program.
 The year 1964 was marked by the continuing emphasis
 on ideological training,  the mobilization of youth to
 take part in the "construction of a new socialist country-
 side," and a renewed emphasis on the half-work, half-study
 approach to education.   Within these three basic approaches
 to the solution of the problem of revolutionary successors,
 however, there appeared definite signs of an attempt to
 soften what for Mao were almost certainly seen as the
 essentials for revolutionizing education.  The basic out-
 line of Mao's policies was put forth in a series of con-
 current campaigns.
 A.   "Fewer But Better"
 The "Fewer But Better" campaign was introduced in
 1961 as part of the program designed to cut away some of

 the excesses of the Great Leap Forward and was applied
 broadly to the ad hoc experiments introduced during this
 period, but in education this campaign focused  on pro-
 ducing specific skills necessary for economic development.
 This policy was described in the press at the time as
 one of "adjustment. consolidation, filling out, and
 raising standards." Following the 10th Plenum of August-
 September 1962,  the slogan of "Fewer But Better" became
 more and more involved with questions of ideological
 training.   By early 1964,  the problem of intensifying
 the ideological training of youth was being discussed
 under Mao's directive ordering the lightening of the
 "students' burden and improving the quality of teaching,
 so that students can develop their moral, intellectual,
 and physical qualities in a brisk and active way."  The
 key word here is "moral."   In July 1964, Kwangming Daily
 described "moral education" as consisting "principally
 of socialist and communist education, class education,
 and labor education."  The editorial stated:
 In our view, in the socialist new China,
 people's teachers not only have the job
 of spreading knowledge but, more import-
 ant, have the task of fostering the moral
 qualities of their students.
 In the discussion of the "Fewer But Better" campaign
 in the press, it was quite evident that the central issue
 was that the heavy academic load was causing the students
 to either neglect politics or take a bored and indifferent
 attitude toward political training.   Thus the "fewer But
 Better" approach was to be used in formal political classes
 and in political meetings.   The intent was that by reduc-
 ing the number of hours spent in political classes and
 meetings, and by careful preparation, political training
 would be more effective.
 B.   "The Construction of a New Socialist Countryside"
 Concurrent with the discussion of ideological and
 political training in the schools, the national press

 was discussing the mobilization and organization of young
 urban intellectuals to be sent to rural areas to "take
 part in the construction of a new socialist countryside.-
 A People's Daily editorial on 4 February 1.964 stated:
 Several million students graduate annually
 from middle and primary schools in the
 urban areas.  With the exception of a
 handful of students who will continue
 to study at high-level schools or be
 employed in urban areas, the majority
 will take part in various socialist
 construction tasks in agriculture,
 forestry, animal husbandry, sideline
 production, and fishery in hilly and
 rural areas.
 Whereas in 1961 the students had been urged to go to the
 countryside on the grounds of commitment to the revolu-
 tion and loyalty to Mao, in 1964 it was clearly stated
 that such motivations were insufficient.   China's youth
 were questioning their assignments on the basis that the
 state was wasting their talents, and that before the
 modernization of agriculture educated men have no place
 on the commune.   Furthermore, many students were ques-
 tioning the purpose of spending years in school only to
 end up as farm laborers.
 The regime apparently paid serious attention to the
 questions raised by the students, and insisted at the time
 that before students were sent to a specific rural assign-
 ment, careful planning should be undertaken to assure
 proper and productive use of their talents.  Although the
 press commentary stated that one of the purposes of the
 rural assignments was to enable youth to learn about "past
 evils" from the peasants, ^,onsiderable space was given
 to discussing how to make commune life more attractive
 to urban intellectuals,   Youth League organizations were
 instructed to assure that the youths had sufficient read-
 ing materials and that they were given time for study,
 recreational., and sports activities.   To what extent such
 preparations were made, and whether or not they reduced
 student opposition to their assignments--they probably

 did not--is, for the purposes of this analysis, not as
 important as the response of the regime to the problem.
 Peking recognized that the basic ideological com-
 mitment of the students was not strong enough to motivate
 them to the kinds of sacrifices demanded of  them.   Further-
 more, it is quite evident that in the process of implement-
 ing one of Mao's strongest beliefs, a realistic appraisal
 of the actual response of China's youth overrode     the
 ideological purposes behind the campaign,
 C.   Half-Work, Half-Study Schools
 The third component of the program to create
 "revolutionary successors" was the renewed emphasis on
 another Great Leap Forward innovation--the half-work,
 half-study schools.   In October 1964, Ou Meng-chueh, a
 member of the Secretariat of the CCP Kwangtung Provincial
 Committee, wrote in the People's Daily:
 The adoption of the half-work (farming)
 and half-study educational system has
 a very far-reaching significance for
 the present and future of our country.
 Such an educational system is a basic
 educational system under socialism and
 communism.   Following the development
 of the socialist enterprise,  this system
 will gradually develop to become the
 principal educational system in our
 country.
 The half-work, half-study system was a method by which
 the students devoted half their time to classes, and the
 other half to "productive labor."  As the concept was
 applied in 1958, the schools were generally "agricultural
 middle schools" and primarily created to provide junior
 middle school (7th through 9th grade) education for child-
 ren who were to become agricultural workers.   The schools
 were to be established and run by the agricultural coopera-
 tives and financially supported by the "productive labor"

 of the students on plots of land set aside, or reclaimed
 for their use.   As the concept was applied in the urban
 areas, the factories organized schools of their own
 designed to create technicians in the specialization of
 the plant.   There was some experimentation with higher
 education using the half-work,  half-study method,  and
 these schools were also attached to plants, but usually
 to relatively large and advanced factories.   Similar
 experiments were conducted on rural communes.    During
 the initial experimentation stage there were to be two
 systems of education--half-time and full-time--existing
 side by side, existing under the rubric of "walking on
 two legs."  The thrust of educational reform in the
 middle 1960's was to reintroduce this experiment, an
 experiment that had been pushed aside in the retrench-
 ment period following the Great Leap Forward.
 The Kwangming Daily of 6 January 196^ carried a
 discussion entitled,  "On Experiment With th   Part-Work
 and Part--Study Educational System."  The id-iological
 goals of the system were:
 To prepare in particular for the elimination
 of differences between mental and manual
 labor as one of the important conditions for
 the realization of the communist system,  the
 testing and gradual implementation of the
 part-work,,  and , part-study or part-farming
 and part-study educational system...
 `.throughout 1964-65 the press was replete with reports
 concerning the application of the policy of "walking on
 two legs."     Typically, such reporting regularly stated
 that "experimentation" with half-work,  half-study schools
 began in 1958, thus indicating a continuation of Mao's
 commitment to the Great Leap Forward and his particular
 utopia.   As the current "educational revolution" draws
 from the experience in 1962-1965 and similarly states
 that its origin was in 1958, an analysis of the system
 as it was described in 1964-1965 will prove useful for
 analyzing continuity and change in the current policies.

 Half-Work,  Half-Study:   A Model County
 Articles in the People's Daily and the Nanfang
 Daily (Canton)  in September 1964 gave a reasonably clear
 picture of the system as it was to be applied in a rural
 county (hsien).   Hsin-hui County in Kwangtung began its
 experiment in 1958.         By September 1964,  it had created
 three levels of half-work, half-study education.   The
 county had 14 commune-run agricultural (forestry) middle
 schools, one of which had senior middle school classes,
 one intermediate agro-technical middle school, and one
 "labor university."
 The agricultural middle school recruited from
 senior primary school graduates and produced literate
 peasants with a basic knowledge of agricultural pro-
 duction techniques.   Essentially,  the agricultural mid-
 dle school produced junior middle school graduates with
 basic information geared to the needs of a specific
 commune.   The curriculum of the school focused on
 politics, Chinese language, mathematics, abacus train-
 ing, rural financial accounting, land surveying, agri-
 cultural biology, fertilizer techniques, and general
 farming techniques.   The future role of the agricultural
 middle school graduate would be to assist the peasants
 on the commune and generally raise the level of agri-
 cultural expertise in the production teams.   They were
 assigned after three years of half-time study.
 The intermediate agro-technical school recruited
 from "young intellectuals" (not further defined) and
 junior middle school graduates who had "tempered them-
 selves through labor in the countryside."  The school was
 designed to produce senior middle school graduates with
 specific skills related to agricultural production in
 their particular geographical area.  The stated purpose
 of the curriculum (not described) was to produce "inter-
 mediate and elementary grade technicians needed by the
 commune for production teams."  It may be safely assumed
 that these graduates would become the technical managers
 of production teams.

 The "labor university" recruited from "outstanding"
 graduates of state-run middle schools, agricultural mid-
 dle schools, and intermediate agro-technical schools who
 had been recommended by the commune authorities and their
 particular production teams.   Graduates of the "labor
 university" were assigned by the county governments to
 become technical managers wherever they were needed in
 the county.
 The model county described above attempted to
 expand education while at the same time structuring its
 :ducational system toward selective recruiting into the
 several levels.   Thus even though there would be greater
 educational opportunities, the specific needs of the
 county were the overriding criteria for curriculum and
 recruiting.
 Half-Work, Half-Study:  The Industrial Model
 The same principle of training specific skills
 applicable to a specialized situation or a specific need
 was also applied in industry.   A Kwangming Daily report
 of August 1964 described a half-work, half-study school
 attached to the Tientsin Photographic Film Plant.   This
 experiment, of course, commenced in 1958.  The school
 appears to have been designed to produce middle-level
 technicians capable of communicating easily with
 engineers--an attempt to solve a familiar problem that
 exists in developing countries.    By 1964, according to
 the report, over 40 percent of the workers in th9 plant
 had graduated from the school run by this factory.   It
 initially recruited some 300 junior middle school graduates.
 The course materials were compiled by engineers at the
 plant and "elsewhere."  The course ran for three years
 and produced essentially specialized senior middle school
 graduates.
 The students were divided into two groups that
 alternately worked in the plant and studied at the school
 on a weekly basis.   According to the report, the cur-
 riculum was divided into politics (11 percent), "cultural

 sabjects" (42 percent), and specialized technological
 training related to the factory's products (47 percent).
 The Kwangming Daily noted that the plant was aware of
 the necessity of "walking on two legs" in that it recog-
 nized the need to rely on ordinary full-time schools for
 sc.ae of its recruiting needs.   Similarly, in a nod to the
 ever present slogans, it was noted that the plant's school
 fulfilled the "three-in-one" curriculum requirement in
 its combination of politics, culture, and technology.
 The report also stressed the narrow ("Fewer But Better"),
 specialized nature of the curriculum and the economy re-
 sulting from running such a program.   This particular
 half-work, half-study school's operating costs were said
 to be only 60 percent of those of a full-time school,
 while at the same time the students were contributing to
 production. The mix of politics, specialized training,
 and economy made this particular school a model for all
 other industrial enterprises.
 Half-Work, Half-Study:  The University Model
 The experiment in specialized education included
 in its goals the creation of individuals who achieve
 university-level skills on a half-work, half-study
 basis.   The Peking Workers Daily on 16 August 1964 pub-
 blished a report on the Shanghai Municipal Spare-Time
 University, describing it as a "new type of university"
 that came into being in 1960 at the suggestion of the
 Shanghai Municipal Party Committee.   It recruited from
 individuals who had worked in industry, on the average,
 for ten years,  including "industrial workers, engineers,
 technical personnel and business administration cadres."
 Its five-year curriculum was designed to bring students
 with a junior middle school background up to the level
 of a university graduate "in specialized engineering
 techniques."  At the time of the report the institution
 had 4,300 students, including 1,000 in the class of 1964.
 The school was structured to provide "specialties in
 technology and equipment for building machines, electrical
 machines and appliances, radio electronics, organic
 synthesis, scientific instruments and meters, textile

 engineering, silicate, chemical fibers, casting, electri-
 fication of factories and enterprises, and automation."
 The curriculum was evidently designed to bridge
 the gap between production experience^.nd basic scienti-
 fic and theoretical knowledge.  The school was clearly
 not designed to create research engineers, but production
 engineers capable of solving production line and design
 problems.   Thus once again the concept of narrow, speci-
 alized training designed to meet specific needs was the
 operational goal of the school.
 Half-Work, Half-Study:  Summary
 In the three levels of half-work, half-study schools
 (the Shanghai institution was actually a cross between
 half-work, half-study and spare-time schools) there was
 an observable attempt to experiment with a complementary
 system of education supporting the full-time educational
 system.   This application of the policy of "walking on
 two legs" was a subversion of Mao's goals for the system,
 for he envisioned some form of a half-work, half-study
 system as ultimately replacing the full-time system and,
 what is more important,  as a source of the new Chinese
 man.   By replacing the formal academic process with a
 system designed to integrate the student with the workers
 and peasants, Mao hoped to over-ride the predominant
 influence of the intelligentsia in the educational system,
 and at the same time create the optimum conditions for
 avoiding the development of elitist attitudes among the
 students.   Thus the educational system would produce
 "worthy revolutionary successors."  As the policy was
 actually implemented during this experimental stage, it
 is evident that the system was being developed to produce
 narrowly trained specialists, at best higher technicians,
 who could fill the gap between research oriented univer-
 sity graduates and the peasant and industrial worker.
 Thus a basic pragmatism over-rode Mao Tse-tung's ideo-
 logical goals.

 Political Control of the Full-Time Education System
 The pragmatism so evident in applying Mao's three
 basic components of a revolutionized education system*
 was not so strongly reflected in the normal or full-time
 educational system.   Political control of the curriculum
 and the student's daily life was very much in evidence.
 The Chinese leadership attempted to make political con-
 trol of the education system absolute, and Party control
 of education was designed to be complete in both organiza-
 tion and content.   From the Politburo down to the village,
 there was a specified, functional responsibility for the
 Party to perform. Political control was present in both
 decision-making and the implementation of policy within
 the school itself, which had its own Party branch down
 to the junior middle school, or by the responsible Party
 faction(s) at the commune, production brigade and pro-
 duction team levels.   At each level of government there
 was a corresponding Party structure functioning as the
 alter-ego of the substantive ministries or governmental
 structure.
 A.   Political Control;   The University
 A university was usually subordinated to the Ministry
 of Higher Education, the provincial-level government's
 Higher Education Bureau, and its alter-ego--the Culture
 and Education Department of the provincial Party committee.
 Specialized institutions, such as the Chungking Architectural
 Engineering College, were subordinated to both the r'inistry
 of Higher Education and the Ministry responsible for the
 industry or area supported by the specialized institution.
 The Chungking Architectural Engineering College was sub-
 ordinated to the Ministry of Construction and Engineering
 *That is,   1   ewer but better,'(2)"the construction
 of a new socialist countryside;' and (3)  half-work, half-
 study schools.

 as well as the Ministry of Higher Education.   Similarly,
 the Huanan Agricultural Institute in Canton was subor-
 dinated to the Peking Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
 Real power in the school, however, was held by the Party
 branch.   Usually the President or Chancellor of a given
 institution was concurrently the 1st Secretary of the
 institution's Party committee.   In those cases where the
 head of the school was not also the head of the Party
 branch, students at the school stated unequivocally that
 his deputy, who would be the head of the Party branch,
 was the de facto head of the school.
 Although there were variations in the specific
 political structure of the institutions, it is possible
 to create a model that contains the essential organiza-
 tional form.
 Overseeing the affairs of the University would be
 the Party Committee, headed by the 1st Secretary who
 would also be the Chancellor.   Each academic department
 of the school would have a Party branch, frequently
 known as the Educational Research Committee (LRC).   As
 the heads of the departments were usually academics and
 not Party members, the ERC chiefs were the deputy depart-
 ment heads.   The educational methods, policies, and cur-
 riculum were determined by the ERC in close conjunction
 with the institution's Party committee.   Once a decision
 was made, the department head--usually an expert in his
 field--was informed, and he and his staff were expected
 to implement this policy.
 At the student level, political work was conducted
 by the Party branch through regular political meetings,
 the Communist Youth League, and the Student Association.
 Refugee reporting indicated that as many as 90 percent
 of the student body of a given institution may have been
 members of the CYL.   The existence of such a high per-
 centage can be best explained by the selection process
 of students for higher education where a major criterion
 was political reliability.  Being a student activist in
 middle school would establish the bona fides of a given
 individual, and would be especially useful when his
 academic qualifications were middling.

 The CYL itself was structured along functional
 lines,   and contained committees such as the Organization
 Committee and the Student Work Committee, but its general
 function was to assist in the political indoctrination
 of the students and to serve as a watchdog over their
 political behavior.   Each class and university department
 had its own CYL branch, and many of the CYL activities
 were carried on from, and within, the classroom.
 The specific arrangements for extra-curricular
 political meetings varied from institution to institu-
 tion, but the basic format was to have one mass meeting
 a week presided over by the 1st Secretary of the Party
 committee or his representative.   The topic for dis-
 cussion was selected from the People's Daily, Red Flag,
 or some other national publication.   The presiding CCP
 member would lecture for an hour or so, after which there
 would be some discussion,   Following the general meeting,
 the students would break up into small groups, led by a
 CYL member, and would conduct further discussion of the
 topic(s) for the day.   Apart from these general meetings
 and the resultant small group discussions, the CYL would
 conduct one or two meetings a week on a departmental and
 class level in which the students would discuss their
 "daily life."  Small group discussions of "daily life and
 studies" were is fact self-criticism sessions in which
 the individual student would confess his errors.   Such
 errors were usually related to his attitudes toward his
 personal goals and his attitude toward the society and
 the Party.
 Apart from criticizing his own errors in motivation
 and behavior, and outlining his plans for correcting
 these errors,  the student was also expected to criticize
 the shortcomings of his comrades.   Frequently these cri-
 ticisms had to be put in writing and submitted to the
 group leader.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of hours
 an individual wpuld be involved in extra-curricular
 political activities.   If, however, the weekly mass as-
 semblies and small group or section meetings are included,
 the range would be from eight to twenty hours per week.

 In addition, formal political classes took from four to
 eight hours a week, giving a total time of 12 to 28 hours
 per week.   If one further includes the requisite manual
 labor as "political training," the total reaches 16 to
 32 hours per week.  By way of comparison, the average
 American student's class load is 12 to 15 hours per week.
 This intensive political training and indoctrina-
 tion was in addition to the student's heavy academic
 schedule.  Classes in Chinese institutions of higher
 learning run from 40 to 45 minutes per hour, and are held
 six days a week.  Weekly class hours in the 1963-1965
 period ranged from 20 to 36 hours, excluding formal poli-
 tical training.  The greatest number of class hours were
 being taken by medical students, the lowest by fine arts
 students.  Accurate aggregate data are difficult to
 present for the curricula reported were not uniform.
 Summary
 dent in the mid-1960's was following a rigorous,  if not
 exhausting, regimen that began at 6:30 a.m. and concluded
 at about 9:00 p.m.  The student knew that there were two
 basic ladders of success in Communist China--he either
 developed skills that were essential to the regime, or
 he became known as a political activist and worked his
 way primarily up the ladder set by the CYL and the Party.
 Climbing up either ladder usually required some knowledge
 and sophistication about the other, with the most pressure
 being applied and felt by the academic, rather than poli-
 tical student;, who recognized the Party's "Red and Expert"
 goals.
 The academically inclined student soon recognized
 the basic "rules of the gamd''and attempted to formally
 accept the heavy political program, while at the same
 time he personally perceived it as a boring waste of time.
 During periods of specific political campaigns he knew
 what was expected of him and participated with an outward
 fervor.   The politically oriented student used the political

 campaigns to put another feather in his cap;  he used them
 to convince his superior that he was indeed the political
 activist that he appeared to be in more relaxed times.
 No matter what  the motivation of a given student was,  how-
 ever,  they all recognized that power in their institutions
 was held by the Party and most tried to adjust to this fact
 of life.
 B.  Political Control:  The Middle School
 Prior to the cultural revolution, there were three
 kinds of full-time state supported middle schools in China:
 junior middle school, senior middle school, and combina-
 tion junior-senior middle school.   A junior middle school
 taught only the first three grades of the total six-year
 middle school course; a senior middle school taught the
 final three years; a combination junior-senior middle
 school (usually referred to as a senior middle school)
 taught all six years in one program.   In a rural county
 there were usually several junior middle schools, a couple
 of senior middle schools, and one combination junior-
 senior middle school located at the county seat.   This
 latter school would be the most prestigious and the most
 difficult to enter.   In urban areas the same situation
 probably existed, with one senior or combination middle
 school recruiting from the several junior middle schools.
 Political control of the middle school system fol-
 lowed the same basic pattern as that devised for higher
 education, but there were variations designed to recognize
 the unique role of the middle school.   The middle school
 was at one and the same time the base of recruits for
 higher education, the source of social, economic, and
 political leaders at the county-municipality level, and
 a director of the primary school system.   Dual control
 of education at this level was in the hands of the Propa-
 ganda  and Education Department of the county-level CCP
 Committee, and the Culture and Education Bureau of the
 county-level government.   As in all areas of dual control,
 the Party held the upper hand.   In a rural county there
 were usually two educational branches of the Propaganda

 and Education Department.  One committee was composed
 entirely of teachers from the county senior middle schools,
 and,  probably, the principals of the junior middle schools
 in the county.   The other committee was composed of the
 principals of the commune level primary schools.
 The senior middle school would form its own Party
 branch, with the 1st Secretary of the Committee function-
 ing as the school principal.  Each section or academic
 department of the school would be run by a member of the
 Party committee; one section or department would be the
 Political Department,   and  was responsible for the poli-
 tical education of both the teachers and the students.
 Political activities among the students were in part a
 function of the Communist Youth League and the Young
 Pioneers.  Pioneers were recruited from the younger stu-
 dents, and the Youth League from students and teachers
 aged 16 to 25.   Following the standard hierarchical
 pattern, the school Party committee would control the
 Youth League through its Youth League Committee, and the
 Youth League would control the Pioneers through its Young
 Pioneers Committee.  The Youth League and the Pioneers
 were organized on a class basis, and ra;i their political
 activities from the classroom.
 Junior middle school faculties may not have had
 enough CCP members to form a Party branch, but the
 principal of the school would be a CCP member, and the
 school would have a Political Department or Section re-
 sponsible for the political education of the students and
 teachers.   Junior middle schools probably came under dual
 Party supervision, for the middle school section of the
 Propaganda and Education Department and the Party branch
 of the local combination senior middle school both appear
 to have exercised some responsibility for them.
 Urban middle schools in all likelihood followed
 the same pattern of political control, but it is also
 likely that urban junior middle school faculties had a
 sufficient number of Party members to form their own Party
 branches.  These Party branches, along with those of the
 senior middle schools, came under the direct supervision
 of the municipal Party committee's Propaganda and Educa-
 tion Department.

 Middle school curricula normally contained three
 or four 45-minute periods of formal political education
 per week out of a total of 24 to 26 periods.   Manual
 labor, another form of political training in the eyes
 of the regime, normally absorbed another four periods
 a week.    Thus seven to eight periods per week, more
 than 25 percent of the total class time, were spent'in
 scheduled political training.
 Political meetings for the students were arranged
 by the Party branch and the Youth League, and took place
 approximately three times a week.   The first meeting took
 place early in the week and was presided over by the
 Principal/1st Secretary who discussed the political
 purpose of being a student.   Later that week, the teachers
 presided over classroom discussion of the "central assign-
 ment," which consisted of the specific political topic
 designated for that week.   Finally, the class committees,
 led by the Youth League class committee chairman would
 lead a discussion of the earlier meeting.   As the political
 discussion moved down to smaller and smaller groups there
 occurred the concomitant closer supervision. Similarly,
 "political" discussions of "central" topics concerned
 not only the substance of the topics, but also confessions
 of one's own errors in motivation and behavior.   As in
 the university, criticism and exposure of the errors of
 fellow students was also a stringent requirement of the
 process.
 Summary
 The primary goal for students in middle school
 was to achieve a place in a university or other insti-
 tution of higher education.   Middle school students
 recognized, especially when they were in senior middle
 school, the two ladders of success.  They knew full well
 that a combination of academic success and acceptable
 political "reliability" was pecessary to gain a seat.
 Similarly, an activist and student leader with a good
 record in the Youth League could also achieve a place
 in a university.   Recommendation from the school,

 essentially the Party, was as necessary for entering the
 university as an acceptable academic record.   Ideally a
 combination of both virtues was required, but in applica-
 tion one or the other was sufficient, with the proviso
 that academic qualifications could be neutralized by a
 record of political unreliability or "backwardness."   In
 fact, the individual who chose the academic ladder set
 as his minimum political goal avoiding the reprobation
 of "politically backward" from his political overseers.
 There were periods of time when academic studies
 were emphasized more than political activism.   The cycles
 of emphasis, however, did not completely negate the neces-
 sity to appear politically active.   Furthermore, the alert
 student, especially in senior middle school, recognized
 the cyclical pattern of emphases and strove to maintain
 a balance in his behavior at all times.
 C.   Political Control:   The Primary School
 Full-time state-run primary schools were divided
 into three categories according to the extent to which
 they taught the full six-year primary school course.
 Thus junior primary school taught the first four years,
 senior primary school taught the final two years, and
 some schools were combined junior-senior primary schools
 teaching the entire six years.
 The pattern of political control was basically the
 same as for middle schools, but the administrative unit
 to which they were attached was one or two steps below
 the county level.   All full-time primary schools were
 financed by the county, but administered by the commune-
 level Education an. Culture Bureau.  Political control
 at this level was exerted by the commune's Party Propa-
 ganda committeeman.   In a rural county, each commune
 would have several senior primary schools.  Below the

 commune, each production brigade would have at least
 one junior primary school. The number of production
 brigades in a commune varies considerably, but in south-
 ern China 10-15 is not an unusual number.   Political
 control at the brigade level was structurally different-
 iated, but in fact the merger of Party and government
 cadres was often total; therefore, the distinction between
 government and Party responsibility was usually rendered
 meaningless.   Party responsibility, however, rested with
 the Education and Culture committeeman.
 As with middle and higher education, the principal
 of the primary school would ideally be a Party member,
 but at the very least he or she would be a political
 activist appointed on the basis of political criteria.
 It is probable that the senior primary school principals
 whose schools were the central primary school for the
 school district (usually the commune) were Party members.
 These principals met once a month at the county seat for
 their Party branch meeting.   There were three other
 weekly meetings held at the commune level, where they
 would meet with Party officials from the commune Party
 branch to coordinate their activities with the other com-
 mune programs.
 There was little formal political education at the
 primary school level, and no student organizations beyond
 the Young Pioneers.  Reporting on curriculum content and
 the role of political education varies.   Some of the elite
 senior primary schools and combination primary schools
 attended by the children of Party cadres seemingly did
 have three to four periods of formal political education
 per week, but for the most part there was no formal poli-
 tical education.   It should be understood, however, that
 the content of primers, grammar texts, and even arithmetic
 texts contained an extremely high level of political in-
 formation.   Similarly, the games organized by the Young
 Pioneers would have political themes central to the purpose
 of the game.

 Entrance Requirements and Fees
 For a natio.. that has set modern agriculture, modern
 industry, and a modern defense system among its highest
 goal priorities, entering the educational system was made
 excessively difficult.   Some of the problems, of course,
 could not be avoided.   There was a serious shortage of
 teachers at the primary and middle school level, and it
 was costly, in terms of one view of national development,
 to use trained graduates of higher education institutes
 for the purpose of teaching.  Certainly a number of gradu-
 ates were used as teachers in universities and colleges,
 but the shortage of college and lower-level teachers is
 clear from the data.   Essentially,  the shortage of teach-
 ers and facilities at all levels of Chinese education
 meant that the number of candidates far exceeded the num-
 ber of seats available.   In one sense, the Chinese reduced
 the pressure on full-time and part-time study schools by
 maintaining political criteria for entrance, and by
 charging basic fees at all levels of the system.  These
 criteria and fees, however, tended to reduce, rather than
 improve, the quality of students that the system produced.
 The two most significant impediments to entering
 were the political criteria and
 the competition for seats.  Close to these hurdles in
 significance was the financial cost of starting and con-
 tinuing one's education.   The financial pressure is most
 noticeable at the primary school level in the rural areas.
 It appears that primary school education was not required
 by the state, and that many children did not receive even
 a junior primary school education.  There were, l-owever,
 no political requirements for entering primary school
 --only children who were mentally or physically handi-
 capped were barred from the lowest levels of the system.
 Entering middle schools,  however, especially the
 major middle schools, was a different matter.   Political
 criteria were, apparently, as forcefully applied as aca-
 demic excellence.   Priority was given to the sons and
 daughters of "poor and lower-middle peasants" and the

 children of the "working class."  It is also quite
 evident that the children of Party and government cadres
 received special attention.   Thus competition for seats
 that would normally skim off the cre-m of the youth re-
 sulted, probably,  in excluding many children from homes
 which had the intellectual atmosphere and basic family
 training that contributes to a successful academic career.
 Undoubtedly, many children who did not come from the
 favored class backgrounds entered ;piddle school, but
 there is enough reporting to indicate that class back-
 ground was an enforced criterion, albeit somewhat un-
 evenly enforced.   The children of cadres were favored in
 yet another way, in that elite combined primary and
 middle schools were created that recruited primarily from
 kindergartens run for the children of Party and govern-
 ment cadres.  These schools had a ten-year curriculum,
 instead of the usual twelve, and gave superior instruction
 to this elite group.
 If a student was successful in clearing the poli-
 tical, intellectual, and financial hurdles from primary
 school through senior middle school, he or she attempted
 to enter a university or its equivalent. The political,
 intellectual, and financial problems were complicated
 at this stage by the necessity of choosing an institution
 and area of academic concentration.   Every middle sc'eool
 student hoped desperately to be admitted into an insti-
 tution of higher education, but he was equally aware
 that the number of candidates for the prestigious schools
 in Peking, Shanghai, Canton and elsewhere would be exces-
 sive.                  Thus many students would select smaller, lesser
 known local schools in order to increase the probability
 of being selected for higher education.  Similarly, a
 student would have to choose his area of examination care-
 fully.   He knew that some fields, such as languages and
 the hard sciences, were of greater significance to the
 nation than others.  Many students would thus choose to
 be examined in fields where there was a greater demand.
 The Ministry of Higher Education which set the national
 examinations and ultimately decided which school and what
 field a student should enter could override the choice
 of an individual, but the student knew that his choice
 of schools and fields would greatly affect his assignment.

 Choice, politics, academic excellence, and financial costs
 were intertwined in a tight and, for the student, desper-
 ate combination of factors.
 The financial cost of education was in part alleviated
 by the possibility of receiving state subsidies.   It ap-
 pears that at least some assistance was available at all
 levels of the system, even for primary school education,
 Yet the refugee reporting clearly indicates that govern-
 ment subsidies were difficult to obtain, with the exception
 of schools related to industry and science.        The Peking
 Iron and Steel Institute, the Peking Petroleum Institute,
 and the Hua Chung Polytechnic Institute all subsidized
 students,  the latter even reportedly supplying pocket
 money to students receiving full subsidies.        Students at-
 tending agricultural middle schools could finance their
 education through working on the commune, and the richer
 production brigades apparently supported any student whose
 family could not afford to send him to primary school.
 Job Assignments
 Youth growing up in China are completely aware (the
 adjective "desperate" springs to mind again) of the abso-
 lute necessity of achieving at least a middle school edu-
 cation if they are to avoid the endless toil of a farm
 or industrial laborer.   Even those who achieve a middle
 school education are subject to being sent out to the
 countryside.  The better middle schools often sent their
 graduates to the rural areas to assume a "higher position"
 as a state cadre or statistician; others were undoubtedly   25X1
 assigned middle level technical and mane erial  ositions
 in industry.
 the threat of lifelong physical labor was constantly  25X1

 a basic fear that their skills would be used in remote
 rural or virgin areas.  Furthermore, in the post-Great
 Leap Forward period, even as late as 1964, there was
 the impression that prior to receiving their assignment,
 they would be required to perform a year's manual labor.
 The problem that arose after the Great Leap Forward was
 simply that there were not enough openings in industry
 and agriculture to absorb the number of graduates with
 skills applicable to modernized agriculture and industry.
 In the narrow vocational sense that prompted the develop-
 ment of the half-work, half-study schools, there was a
 need for middle and lower level technicians and managers,
 but for many of the graduates with higher levels of edu-
 cation there were not enough suitable positions.  China,
 in common with many other developing nations, was produc-
 ing more trained personnel than the level of development
 could utilize.   This left a significant gap between the
 level of expectation generated by the educational system
 and the level of skill application the nation and society
 could use.  For the students, especially in the aftermath
 of the Great Leap Forward, this was a very depressing
 discovery.
 Student Morale and Political Attitudes
 The political attitude of students in the middle
 corre ates with t e
 studies made by Alexander L. George of the People's Lib-'
 eration Army, and to some extent with the findings of
 Robert J. Lifton.   Students and teachers at both the mid-
 dle school and university level were characteristically
 demonstrating clear indications of dissimulation, and,
 in the area of politics at least, the atomization of
 group relationships.   It was common pra,tice to control
 one's behavior and simulate correct attitudes.  The pro-
 cesses of political socialization, especially small-group
 criticism, led to a level of anxiety and fear about one's
 own political beliefs.   Dissimulation led to an unwill-
 ingness to discuss politics outside formal classes and
 "daily life" self-criticism sessions. Unwillingness to

 discuss politics and the obvious anxiety about one's
 own motivation and behavior led to the atomization of
 group relationships and deprived the students of even
 the possibility of creating organized resistance to
 their overseers.   Thus there was a definite behavior
 pattern evident in which self-preservation was the com-
 mon reference.
 The ability of the regime to force dissimulative
 behavior upon the students is quite obviously a function
 of the students' awareness that their future depended to
 a large extent upon an acceptable political as well as
 academic performance in school.   Student observations
 that the political sess &'.ons were boring and irrelevant
 were accurate descriptions of their response to them,
 but their personal goals overrode any predisposition
 they may have had to resist.
 The political authorities in the schools were
 undoubtedly aware that dissimulation was the character-
 istic student response to the process of politicization,
 but at the very least this response achieved the minimum
 threshold demanded by the system:   the mobilization and
 control of student behavior.  The more ambitious goal
 of changing the basic attitudes of the student to the
 extent that they internalized the values being thrust
 upon them was probably rarely achieved.   Furthermore,
 in all likelihood this higher threshold was not even
 sought, except by the most ambitious or convinced poli-
 tical cadre.  Certainly the core values of loyalty to
 the state and to some extent the Party were learned
 and internalized long before the student reached the
 university, but the more extreme values of the cult of
 Mao were probably only rarely internalized.
 Dissimulation was a function of self-protection
 and of self-seeking individuals.  There was a high level
 of resentment, not so much of individuals but of a system
 that forced students to "waste" so much of their "valu-
 able" time in irrelevant political studies, humiliating
 and dangerous self-criticism sessions, and arduous physical
 labor.

 The Prelude to the Cultural Revolution:
 Conclusions
 The educational system in 1964-1965 was in the
 process of becoming a dual system of half-work, half-
 study and full-time education.   Although the half-work,
 half-study system was still in an experimental stage, as
 it was being developed it would have become a vocational
 training oriented system complementing the full-time
 system.   There were to be, in fact, two educational sys-
 tems.   Mao's view of the new educational system was not
 based upon the economic and general developmental problems
 of China, but rather upon an ideological base in which
 the creation of "revolutionary successors" was the pre-
 eminent value.   Mao's goals were essentially political,
 but the implementation of his policies was pragmatic in
 that an obvious attempt was made to respond to some of
 China's developmental realities as well as Mao's own
 views.
 The charges made against Liu Shao-chi during the
 course of the cultural revolution demonstrate Mao's aware-
 ness of the manner in which his policies were being im-
 plemented.   Liu is charged with subverting Mao's educa-
 tional policies from as early as 1949; and having continued
 his opposition until he was purged in August, 1966.   The
 state of the educational system in 1964-1965 indicates
 quite clearly that Mao's perception that his political
 considerations were being subverted by a pragmatic im-
 plementation of his policies was essentially correct.
 Liu Shao-chi and his cohorts have been charged with the
 emasculation of Mao's policies in the following ways:

 a)  Basing the half-work, half-study system upon
 economic consideratibns--essentially that this was a cheap
 way of expanding education.
 h)  Violating the political principles upon which
 the system was based by stressing the educational-voca-
 tional values of the system.
 c)  Intending to create a dual system of educa-
 tion rather than ultimately planning for a conversion
 of the entire system to half-work,  half-study.
 d)  Using the dual system to produce "aristocrats"
 from the full-time system and managerial and technical
 staff from the half-work, half-study system.   This parti-
 cular charge is often stated by indicting Liu for pro-
 Oucing "bourgeois revisionists and intellectuals" from
 the half-work,  half-study system.
 e)  Deliberately sJ.Owing down the development of
 the half-work,  half-study system by invoking a policy
 of gradualism and experimentation.
 In the full-time system Liu and his supporters are charged
 with subverting Mao's policies in curriculum reform,  par-
 ticularly with using the "fewer but better" watchword to
 reduce, rather than intensify,  political training.
 It is evident that since 1960-61 there has been
 a consistent,  pragmatic strain running through the im-
 plementation of Mao's policies toward educational reform.
 Furthermore,  there is evidence that Mao was aware at the
 time that his particular goals and conceptualizations
 were not shared b,  all of the Party's leadership.   Mao's
 references to tMe absolute necessity of creating true
 "revolutionary successors" were too much in evidence for     25X1
 any politically alert individual to have missed their
 import.   Indeed, Mao addressed his views
 in September 1964, and twice        25X1

 tional University as "not a goo   university and indicated

 tempted to reassure Mao by referring to the loyalty and
 political fervor expressed by the students in their con-
 versatioas with them, but Mao expressed frank skepticism
 over the depth and conviction of the views expressed by       25X1
 Mao had good reason to doubt that the stu-        25X1
 dents and teachers had achieved the level of fanaticism
 his goals call for.
 By early 1966 Mao had evidently decided that yet
 another "revolution" had to occur, not only in education
 but in the society as a whole,   The entire society was
 to be subjected to a new revolutionary spasm as Mao
 sought to achieve his goals, and in the process his op-
 ponents were to be purged.   This new spasm was called
 the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

 THE GREAT PROLETARIAN CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 The Closing of the Schools
 The educational system was following its normal
 processes in the early months of 1966.  The Kwangtung
 press in January was announcing preparation for post-
 graduate enrollment, and listing the universities where
 examinations for graduate schools across the country
 would be administered.   On 16 January NCNA broadcast an
 article lauding the accomplishments of students who had
 completed their studies in the previous three years,
 taking note of their assignments to various universi-
 ties, research institutions and industries.
 Soon after NCNA's laudatory broadcast, however,
 a discordant note began to appear in the press.   On 20
 January, the People's Daily published an article prais-
 ing the  ingenuity of the  Chinese worker and decrying
 those who complained that China had too few scientists.
 The article proceeded to discuss a model scientist,
 who had come from the ranks of the workers and had only
 completed primary school prior to embarking on his
 scientific career.  Similarly, on 24 January, People's
 Daily reported on the significance of Mao Tse-tung 's
 thought in guiding scientific research, citing sixteen
 scientific and technical achievements directly attribu-
 table to the correct application of Mao's thought.
 These initial commentaries were but harbingers of the
 immediate future.
 On 11 April, People's Daily published a report
 on a symposium held in Shantung of "leading cadres of
 institutions of higher education directly under the
 Ministry of Higher Education."  A major part of the
 discussion centered on the significance of politics in

 institutions of higher learning and reflected the general
 tenor of the provincial and national press since the end
 of January.   The conference observed that:
 ...schools of higher learning served as points
 of concentration for intellectuals, a great
 number of them got a bourgeois education in the
 old society while as many made constant contacts
 with the cultural legacy of feudalism and
 capitalism.  As a result, they were constantly
 influenced by bourgeois ideology.
 The symposium concluded that:
 In spite of numerous  ideological reform move-
 ments which had been conducted among higher
 schools in our country and despite some measure
 of progress made by intellectuals, as far as
 the majority of the people were concerned, the
 problem of establishing the proletarian communist
 world outlook remained basically unsolved.
 In order to solve this problem, and especially because
 these centers educated China's youth,   the educators them-
 selves should be re-educated.   If this were not done,
 the symposium averred, the centers of higher learning
 would produce revisionists.   It was decided, therefore,
 that a movement for studying Mao's works should be turned
 into "a mass rectification campaign on the higher education
 front."  Thus, within three months, higher education's
 status had shifted from that of a system producing properly
 politicized graduates to that of a center of bourgeois
 intellectualism breeding revisionism.   In effect, the
 attack of the educational system had begun.
 On 13 June 1966, the Central Committee of the Chinese
 Communist Party and the State Council directed that the
 enrollment of students into institutes of higher educa-
 tion be postponed, and that the system of entrance exam-
 inations be completely revised.   According to a front
 page editorial of the People's Daily of 18 June, the
 purpose of the directive was to ensure the thorough

 and successful carrying through of the cultural revolution
 and to effect a thorough reform of the educational system."
 This directive, and the processes of the cultural revolu-
 tion, effectively closed down the entire educational system
 until the summer of 1968, and ended all meaningful education
 in China for at least three academic years.
 The Red Guard Reign of Terror*
 The closing of the schools on 13 June freed millions
 of students across the nation to participate in Mao's cul-
 tural revolution.   The first Red Guard recruits, generally
 in their late 'teens and early twenties, were handpicked
 by local Cultural Revolution Groups at certain schools in
 the late spring and early summer.   These handpicked groups
 were to become the core of Red Guard organizations when
 their ranks were expanded in August and September of 1966.
 Peking's campuses became the training group for Red
 Guards in the spring and early summer when certain future
 Red Guards were sent to Peking for classes in "cultural
 revolution tactics."  Ultimately, the Red Guards were to
 receive directions which permitteu them to by-pass the
 Party apparatus and assault the existing political struc-
 ture.   On 18 August, the Red Guards were publicly consecrated
 as the shock troops of the culttral revolution at a mass
 rally in Tienanmen square in Peking.   Mao reviewed his
 troops, and  in Piao and Chou En-lai spoke to them, launch-
 ing them on their violent course.

 The educational system with its centers of "bour-
 geois intellectualism" was among the first of the Red
 Guard targets.   Their instructions from Lin Piao, speaking
 on the behalf of Mao, called for a "general offensive"
 against "bourgeois ideas and all other exploiting classes:"
 The great proletarian cultural revolution is
 aimed precisely at eliminating bourgeois
 ideology, remolding people's souls, revo-
 lutionizing their ideology, digging out the
 roots of revisionism, and consolidating and
 developing the socialist system.
 The targets for the assault-.-"those in authority
 who are taking the capitalist road, reactionary bourgeois
 authorities, bourgeois royalists, ghosts and monsters"--
 designated by Lin were both broad enough and narrow r-^ough,
 given Mao's statements about revisionism in the ed,ca=..Lonal
 system, to permit an extensive attack on the faculties and
 political authorities in the schools at all levels of the
 system.
 All of China's universities were to suffer complete
 disruption, and some of China's most prestigious educators
 were to be removed from office or commit suicide, as a
 result of the Red Guard onslau ht-Q.

 IIn Peking when the body of a professor was
 found, "authorities" herded the students onto  trucks and   25X1
 had them driven to the location of the body.  The students
 then stoned the corpse.   'A member of Canton's pres-
 tigious Medical College jumped from the fifth floor of
 the school's administration building.   In Futan University,
 Shanghai, one of China's most renowned institutions, all
 of the Western trained or "oriented" members of the faculty
 were subjected to continuous pressure.  They were "dragged
 out" by the students and subjected to intensive and brutal
 questioning.   Futan is a center of science and engineering,
 and therefore contained a large number of faculty who
 could easily be identified as having a Western orientation

 From across China in the summer of 1966 came reports of
 purges and suicides.  Among the dismissals were the
 Presidents or Chancellors of Peking National University
 (Peita), Tsinghua University, Wuhan University and
 other major academic centers.
 The teachers at middle schools were also sub-
 jected to Red Guard terrorism.  As in the universities,
 teachers were required to attend "struggle sessions"
 in which they had to defend themselves against charges
 made by Red Guards.   It was common for the accusers to
 use force in order to extract the proper answers.   The
 intensity of the pressures upon the accused teachers can
 be seen in the letters written by participants in the
 campaign.   Followin  the pattern used in "daily life"
 sessions, the initial accusations were made in small
 group meetings.   Frequently, the individuals   o ini-
 tiated the attacks were friends, relatives, students,
 or even spouses of the accused.   The logic behind
 these attacks was simple; knowing that he or she would
 be identifiable as closely connected with the accused,
 a personal friend would lead the attack in order to de-
 fend himself.   Not to do so would immediately focus
 attention on the failure, and the personal relationship
 would become sufficient cause for a "struggle session."'.'
 Even though those under attack recognized the reason
 for this behavior, and indeed were sympathetic to it,
 they found the questioning, beating, and spitting by
 close friends and relatives the most traumatic of all
 of the indignities they had to suffer.
 At both the university and middle school level
 the initial response of the students to the demand
 from their leaders they attack the faculty and admini-
 stration was one of reluctance.   Initially they feared
 revenge in the form of bad marks or poor recommendations.

 Group explained to them, however, that to advance to
 the next rung on the academic ladder required a com-
 bination of recommendation and selection.   The political
 criteria for selection, it was made clear to the stu-
 dents, would be measured by their performance in the
 cultural revolution.  Apart from this motivation,
 there is considerable evidence that many students used
 the campaign against the faculty and staff as an op-
 portunity to revenge themselves for past poor grades
 or other experiences.
 Red Guard rampages were to continue with few
 quiescent periods for the following two years.  Attempts
 were made to return the students to the campuses and
 classrooms in the spring, summer, and fall of 1967, but
 at no time was ary return to meaningful education in-
 tended.                  The attempts to return the students to their
 classrooms in 1967 were essentially designed to bring
 the students under control.   The most successful ef-
 fort was made in the fall of 1967, and by November a
 substantial number of Red Guards had returned at least
 to their own localities.   However, not only were many of
 the students unwilling to give up their intoxicating
 independence and political power, but teachers were
 fearful of the students who had only recently been
 empowered to terrorize them.   Students who did return
 to school were instructed to "conduct revolution in
 the classrooms", which led to more struggle sessions
 with teachers.   The ability of the students to terrorize
 the teachers this time, however, was restricted by the
 presence of PLA soldiers in the classrooms.
 The authority of the PLA in the educational sys-
 tem was established by Mao Tse-tung's letter to Lin Piao,
 Chou En-lai, and the central Cultural Revolution Group
 of 7 March,1967,  in  which he wrote:
 ..The army should give military and political
 training in the universities, middle schools and
 higher classes of primary schools, stage by stage
 and group by group...

 merely turned the campuses and schools into battle-
 grounds as rival Red Guard: factions fought, literally,
 for political dominance.   To all intents and purposes,.
 Red Guard terror continued into July 1968 when Mao was
 finally convinced that he would have to sacrifice his
 Red Guards and replace them with a more responsive and
 reliable extra-legal political force:   the Worker-
 Peasant Mao Tse-tung's Thought Propaganda Teams.
 The Reinstatement of Authority
 A series of central directives designed to stop
 the fighting generated by conflicting Red Guard groups
 led, finally, to the use of force by the Army.   By the
 middle of July, authorities in several provinces were
 using the PLA to forcefully suppress the Red Guards
 and Revolutionary Rebels.  The new attitude toward the
 Red Guards was also reflected in press reporting.
 Throughout July and August there was considerable
 emphasis placed on a quote from Mao's 1939 article
 commemorating the 20th anniversary of the May 4th
 Movement:
 How should we judge whether or not a youth is
 revolutionary?  How can we tell?  There can be
 only one criterion, namely, whether or not he
 is willing to integrate himself with the broad
 masses of workers and peasants and does so in
 practice.   If he is willing to do so and act-
 ually does so, he is a revolutionary; other-
 wise he is non-revolutionary and counterrevolu-
 tionary.
 On 27 July the first Worker-Peasant Thought of
 Mao Tse-tung Propaganda Team (henceforth propaganda team)
 arrived on the campus of Tsinghua University accompanied
 by soldiers of the PLA.   On 5 August Mao presented this
 propaganda team with a gift of mangoes that Mao had
 personally received as a gift from Pakistan.  This gift
 was described as a "token of the greatest faith in, and

 attention, support, and encouragement to the revolu-
 tionary masses from Chairman Mao."  If there was any
 doubt as to the future role of the propaganda teams
 and their PLA supporters it should have been dispelled
 by Mao's "instructions" broadcast on 25 August:
 In carrying out the proletarian revolution in
 education it is essential to have working class
 leadership; it is essential for the masses of the
 workers to take part and in cooperation with the
 liberation army fighters, bring about a revolu-
 tionary three-in-one combination, together
 with the activists among the students, teachers
 and workers in the schools who are determined
 to carry the proletarian revolution in educa-
 tion through to the end.   The workers propa-
 ganda teams should stay  ermanentl  in the
 schools (emphasis added) and take part in
 fulfilling all the tasks in the schools of
 struggle-criticism-transformation, and they will
 always lead the schools. In the countryside,
 the schools should be managed by the poor and
 lower middle peasants -- the most reliable
 ally of the working classes.
 By the end of August, or the middle of September at the
 latest, every major university in the country was under
 the sway of propaganda teams and their PLA allies.
 Propaganda teams were not restricted to the schools and
 universities; they were empowered to enter "all leading
 organs at all levels, literary and art organizations,
 scientific and research units, publishing houses, hos-
 pitals" etc.  Mao's intention was, and is, to take the
 new phase of the cultural revolution into all formal
 structures of the society.

 Revolution Group and an authoritative source of Mao
 Tse-tung's intentions, published an article in the

 Party journal Red Flag that was subsequently reproduced
 in the Peking Review (#35), 30 August 1968, describing
 the role of the propaganda teams.   Entitled "The Work-
 i,ig Class Must Exercise Leadership in Everything", the
 article laid down the basic form of reform in a factory,
 but which in fact also described the process as it was
 to take place in the educational  system.
 The ;struggle-criticism-transformation in a
 factory, on the whole, goes through the fol-
 lowing stages:  establishing a revolutionary
 committee based on the "three-in-one" combin-
 ation, mass criticism and repudiation, puri-
 fying class ranks, rectifying the party organ-
 ization, simplifying organizational structure,
 changing irrational rules and regulations and
 sending people who work in offices to grass-
 roots level.
 Referring specifically to the educational system, Yao
 wrote:
 Worker propaganda teams should systematically
 and in a planned way go to universities, mid-
 dle schools and primary schools, to all areas
 of the superstructure and Nl1 units in which
 the struggle-criticism-transformation has not
 been carried out well.
 In the educational system, the working class was given
 the mission of "remolding" the intellectuals in order
 to eliminate the "traditional influence" of the bourgeo-
 isie in "cultural and educational units."  Thus the
 propaganda teams were given the authority to oversee
 the thought reform of the intellectuals, including stu-
 dents, and the reformation of the educational system.
 The status of the Red Guards and their future
 role was made undeniably clear by Madame Mao on 7 Sep-
 tember in her speech at a rally celebrating the success-
 ful formation of revolutionary committees at the pro-
 vincial level throughout China.   Her address was clearly
 sympathetic to the Red Guards and reflected her concern
 over the treatment they were to receive at the hands of

 the PLA and the propaganda teams:
 We must not forget that the revolutionary
 youth have made tremendous contributions
 at the initial and middle stages of the revolu-
 tion.
 Chiang Ching continued, saying that "a small number" of
 Red Guards had made mistakes, but that "We have the duty
 to help them correct these mistakes."  Finally she asks
 the Red Guards to accept the leadership of the working
 class as commanded by Mao on 27 July.
 The propaganda teams that entered the educational
 system in the summer of 1968 were organized by the ap-
 propriate revolutionary committee.   In the urban areas
 factories formed the propaganda teams, or formed com-
 ponents of the larger teams.   In the rural areas pea-
 sants were selected from the communes and production
 brigades to form teams.   In addition, many of the teams
 had PLA-men as members of the team or attaches to the
 team.
 Once on the campus, the team(s) restored order
 by forcing the Red Guards to form alliances.  Having
 achieved a semblance of order, the team completed
 the final purge of the faculty, administration, Party
 structure, and Red Guard organizations if the muni-
 cipal or provincial revolutionary committee deemed
 further purge necessary, which it often did.  In
 the process of restoring order in Canton's C''ving-
 shan Medical College, for example, the propaganda team
 organized the "dragging out" of the former President
 and First Secretary of the college's Party Committee.

 The disgrace of Chungshan's President Ko Lin occurred
 on 24 August, with 11,000 persons reportedly attending
 his "struggle session."
 The new authority structure built by the propa-
 ganda teams and their PLA allies was the "Revolutionary
 Committee."  The revolutionary committee is a product
 of the cultural revolution and is designed to take the
 place of the apparatus shattered by the purge.  Within
 the educational system, each unit (primary school,
 middle school, college, university, research center
 etc.) will have its own revolutionary committee.   The
 three-in-one combination of the forces that structure
 the revolutionary committee in schools is generally
 interpreted to provide for a revolutionary committee
 composed of workers or peasants, "revolutionary"
 teachers and students, and "revolutionary" cadres--
 primarily Party cadres.  The essence of the design
 is to integrate the principal functional components
 of the pre-cultural revolution organization into one
 structure.   The purpose of the design is to permit
 maximum possible control over the functions of the
 structure.
 It is evident that the building of revolutionary
 committees in the universities is a very difficult pro-
 cess.                                    Tsinghua University in Peking announced the for-
 mation of its revolutionary committee fully six months
 after the propaganda team entered on 27 July 1968.  The
 fact that the propaganda team which entered Tsinghua
 was a model team operating under personal mantle
 of Chairman Mao, and that it took six months for even
 this team to form a revolutionary committee, is indi-
 cative of the intensity of the conflict engendered on
 the campus by the cultural revolution.   The establish-
 ment of revolutionary committees at the secondary and
 primary school level was not as difficult as their
 creation at the university level, but undoubtedly pro-
 blems existed.
 The formation of revolutionary committees, however,
 was only one technique used by the regime to re-establish
 its control in the educational.-system.   The second
 aspect of control introduced a more traditional aspect

 of Mao Tse-tung's political style:   the reintroduction
 of the campaign to "build a new socialist countryside'."
 This involved, as in the past. transferring millions of
 students to the communes, state farms, and PLA farms
 and land reclamation projects.   This campaign was, and
 is, combined with the process of administering job as-
 signments for middle school and university students who
 "graduated" in 1966, 1967, and 1968 but who, due to the
 cultural revolution, either had not been assigned or
 had their assignments deferred.
 In both of these actions it is possible to assert
 that control was the primary purpose. but in fact the
 ideological dimension was almost certainly uppermost
 in Mao Tse-tung's mind.  This difficulty presents it-
 self in analyzing much of the data relating to Mao's
 cultural revolution.   Certainly it was absolutely nece-
 ssary to bring the Red Guards under control if the re-
 gime was to restore a semblance of order to the state
 and the society, but Mao himself was obviously intent
 on using the restoration of authority to proceed with
 his basic socio-economic reforms.  Among the. most salient
 of these reforms is the creation of a New Chinese Man,
 and within this goal the educational system and its pro-
 ducts play a central role.   The propaganda teams in the
 educational system assumed the dual responsibility of
 conducting the thought reform of the intellectuals and
 assuring the exodus of the students and teachers from
 the schools and campuses.
 B.   The Thought Reform of the Intellectuals
 The transformation of the intellectual's value
 structure has always been the principal target of Mao
 Tse-tung's policies toward the intelligentsia.   The
 transformation or remolding of the intellectuals during
 the post-Red Guard phase of the cultural revolution
 would involve, as in the past, two distinct but re-
 lated processes:                       struggle-criticism-transformation
 sessions and physical labor.   In both cases the "teacher"
 would be the workers and the peasants who have been
 defined often enough as the "basic revolutionary
 forces", but particularly the workers who: are defined

 as the "class which leads the revolution."  From the
 very beginning of the current campaign, however, Mao's
 instructions have contained the caveat that the major-
 ity of the intellectuals can "integrate" with the
 workers and peasants, and that during the struggle-
 criticism-transformation sessions the intellectuals
 must be given "a way out."  The early stages of
 "transformation" are noted for the apparent neglect
 of this caveat.
 Data from July and August indicate that "trans-
 formation" in many schools was a grisly process.   It
 is highly probable that the process of "cleansing the
 revolutionary ranks" of revolutionary committees formed
 prior to the arrival of the propaganda teams was quite
 brutal.  Once the propaganda teams had established the
 new authority structure, education and transformation
 of the intellectuals became more regularized.

 The deportation of students, teachers, and other
 members of the intelligentsia was part of a- grander
 scheme in which all adults not fully employed in the
 urban areas were to be sent to the rural areas, iin-
 cluding the families of those not fully employed.
 Also sent were many Party and government cadres who
 had been removed from office as the administrative
 structures of the Party and government were "stream-
 lined."  By the middle of March an estimated 20 mil-
 lion persons had been removed from the urban areas
 and sent to the countryside.

 people to go to the countryside to be re-

 country should welcome them.
 Mao Tse-tung
 Once again, the Chinese student was ordered to
 leave the school and university campus, and his home,
 to seek ideological transformation through manual labor
 and association with the peasant and worker.   Parents
 were told that their children are the property of the
 state and people, and were urged to welcome the opportunity
 given to their sons and daughters to demonstrate their
 worthiness, their dedication to become genuine "revolu-
 tionary successors."  Press reporting, however, as early
 as June indicated that the students were objecting to
 the demands made upon them.   Nevertheless, NCNA on 29
 June reported that "thousands upon thousands" of stu-
 dents were leaving Peking and other cities, including
 Red Guards who were characterized as the "pathbreakers"
 in the cultural revolution.   This exodus was depicted
 as demonstrating their loyalty to Mao Tse-tung and his
 thought.
 Parallel to, and complementing, the struggle-
 criticism-transformation policy and the campaign to
 send the students and teachers to the countryside,
 was the assignment of jobs to the secondary and univer-
 sity level graduates.   The order of assignment was estab-
 lished by the year of graduation.   The first to be
 assigned were the graduates of 1966, following which the
 "graduates" of 1967 and 1968 were assigned.   Peking
 decided that, even though the schools had been essentia-
 lly closed since 1966, the students who should have
 graduated in 1967 and'1968 would be graduated regard-
 less of their failure to complete their'course work.
 The basic pattern of assignments was that graduates'
 from scientific and other technical and engineering
 courses would be assigned as far as possible to posi-
 tions related to their fields.  For the most part, all
 other graduates were assigned to farms, factories and
 other laboring positions.   In addition, many students
 were to report to their assignments and then be sent
 to a farm or factory for six months to three years of
 ma i.u a l labor.

 Two basic categories of university graduates were

 the vast majority of university graduates were being sent
 to perform manual labor, even though a large number may
 be receiving assignments that will ultimately relate to
 their particular areas of expertise.   It is not clear,
 however, how many university graduates will be assigned
 skill related assignments following their tour as laborers.
 Many will probably never be given roles related to their
 particular training.
 Middle school graduates appear to have been
 assigned wholesale to the countryside and factories
 to perform manual labor, with the exception of some
 20%-25% of the junior middle school graduates who have
 been permitted to continue their education.   Among the
 middle school graduates there is the distinct impression
 that they have been sent to the countryside to settle
 there permanently.   Such a vast exodus of youth from
 the urban areas has not been without considerable
 objection from the parents and the students.   Reports     25X1
 from Canton describe mothers hanging onto the trucks
 as their sons and daughters are herded into the
 countryside.
 It is clear that the studer.s understand the "instruction"
 that they are to settle in the countryside to mean just

 The students are essentially powerless to, re-

 avoidin  assi nment is        uite common.
 Reports from Canton describe large numbers of
 students who have gone into hiding to avoid deportation.
 As their ration cards are cancelled when they are
 assigned. they have to sneak out at night to the sur-
 rounding villages to buy blackmarket food.   The Workers
 Provost Corps, a paramilitary police force established
 by the Canton Municipal Revolutionary Committee and
 supported by the PLA, was conducting raids in the city
 to arrest these dissidents.  Other reporting describes
 Investigation Groups formed in all city and factory
 units, and all neighborhood associations in Canton.
 The Investigation Groups are charged with investiga-
 ting their parent unit, and the families of members
 of the unit, to determine who should be sent to per-
 form manual labor and, very likely, to ascertain
 that such people have in fact gone.
 Communes have protested the influx of students,
 teachers, and other urban dwellers and complain that
 their food supplies are not sufficient to feed the new-
 comers.   Commune authorities are also disturbed by the
 influx of unskilled and angry students who have become
 a source of friction.   Students were frequently phy-
 sically incapable of performing a hard day's work,
 and often went on "go slow" strikes or deliberately
 broke their implements.   This combination of attitudes
 and attempts to disrupt the daily life of the commune
 led to frequent fights between the peasants and the
 students.

 The degree of resistance from the parents, at
 least in attitude, to the deportation of their sons and
 daughters can be seen in the campaign to muster their
 support.   Parents became the target in late 1968 of
 propaganda teams urging them to "educate" their child-
 ren and to explain to them the necessity of contribu-
 ting to the "building of a new socialist countryside."
 The Tsingtao Municipal Revolutionary Committee in Shan-
 tung Province on 14 February 1969 broadcast a "Comfort
 Letter" to the parents, thanking them for taking "the
 lead-in sending your own children to the countryside."
 The broadcast announced the decision of the revolu-
 tionary committee to mobilize more youth, and urged the
 parents of those students who had already gone to
 "educate" other parents whose children had yet to go.
 Educational Reform
 On 8 August 1966, the "16 Points" of the Great
 Proletarian Cultural Revolution were adopted by the
 Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.   The
 10th Point was concerned with educational reform:
 In the great proletarian cultural revolu-
 tion a most important task is to transform
 the old educational system and methods of
 teaching.
 In this great cultural revolution the pheno-
 menon of our schools being dominated by bour-
 geois intellectuals must be completely changed.
 In every kind of school we must apply
 thoroughly  the policy advanced by comrade
 Mao Tse-tung, of education serving prole-
 tarian politics and education being com-
 bined with productive labor so as to enable
 those receiving an education to develop
 morally, intellectually and physically and
 to become laborers with a socialist con-
 sciousness and culture.

 The period of schooling should be short-
 ened.   Courses should be fewer and better.
 The teaching material   should be thoroughly
 transformed, in some cases beginning with
 simplifying complicated material.  While
 their main task is to study, students should
 also learn other things.  That is to say,
 in addition to their studies they should
 also learn industrial work, farming and
 military affairs, and take part in the
 struggles of the cultural revolution as they
 occur to criticize the bourgeoisie.
 This "Point" lays out quite succinctly Mao's basic
 attitudes toward educational reform:
 a) Destroy the dominance of Western trained or
 oriented intellectuals.
 b) Combine formal education with physical labor.
 c) Shorten the period of formal education.
 d) Combine academic training with actual work
 experience.
 In January 1967 these basic views were expanded
 through the distribution of a "Discussion Draft" of
 the "Views of the Central Government on Reformation of
 the Educational System."*  This lengthy document con-
 sists of twenty-one sections and lists fifty-three
 proposals.   The proposals indicate the general trend
 of reform and correlate highly with the experiments now
 being conducted.   The document lists twelve basic pro-

 1) Enrollment in all schools should be based
 upon "recommendation and selection", with
 primary emphasis on enrolling the children
 of workers, peasants and soldiers.  Further-
 more, financial assistance to these chil-
 dren-should be expanded and increased.
 2) Academic terms should be reduced.  Primary
 schools should be reduced from six to five
 years; middle school from six'to four or
 five years; university level institutions
 should reduce their courses to two to four
 years.
 3) Examinations should I    bolished along with

 year of experimentation and two years of
 expansion.   All schools and universities
 should be on a half-work, half-study basis.
 Schools and universities should be established
 within factory premises, or moved to the
 frontier provinces.   Urban universities and
 colleges should be moved to the farming vil-

 the academic year structured so that students
 will be free during the busy farming seasons.

 must go to the farms or factories, or join

 utopia.   In essence, Mao would like to use the educa-
 tionpl system to neutralize, if not eradicate entirely,
 the value structure that leads to the self-perception
 of an individual as being a member of a particular elite,
 and, furthermore, to neutralize the attitudes that lead
 others to view an educated man as   a member of an elite.
 Within the Chinese culture, this latter goal  will be
 as difficult to achieve as the former goal of changing
 self-perceptions.
 A. Educational Reform:  Higher Education
 Mao's attitude toward university level education
 was most recently stated in his directive of July 1968:
 It is still necessary to have universities,
 here I refer mainly to colleges of science
 and engineering.  However, it is essential
 to shorten the length of schooling, revolu-
 tionize education, put proletarian politics
 in command, and take the road of the Shang-
 hai Machine Tool Plant in training techni-
 cians from among the workers and peasants
 with practical experience and they should
 return to production after a few years
 study.
 Thus far we have only two examples of experimentation
 in higher education:  Tungch:i University in Shanghai,
 and the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant's "Worker Univer-
 sity."  Both experiments have been used as examples
 by the regime, and i'  is quite likely that they are
 representative of the future shape of China's scienti-
 fic and technical training.   We shall first discuss
 the "university" model and then the "factory" model.
 Tungchi University:   The University Model
 Peking radio on 2 November 1967 broadcast the
 plans for Tungchi's experiment in higher education.
 The name of the university was changed to the "7 May
 Commune" in honor of Mao Tse-tung's directive of 7 May

 1966, in which he said:
 While their [the students] main task is
 to study, they should in addition to their
 studies, learn other things; that is, in-
 dustrial work, farming and military
 affairs.
 Tungchi University was originally a German  foundation,
 established in 1907. Under the communists it became a
 major center of civil engineering.   On 1 June 1967,
 Tungchi established a revolutionary committee composed
 of representatives of the militia, "revolutionary"
 cadres, and "revolutionary" students.   The 2 Novem-
 ber broadcast described Tungchi's plans as a tenta-
 tive program combining academic and practical work,
 and the "experience gained during the revolution in
 education in 1958."
 The "plan" for the university commune was de-
 signed around a functional entity composed of the univer-
 sity (education), the Shanghai Municipal Building
 Construction Bureau (production) and the East China
 Industrial Design and Research Institute (research and
 design).  'The initial members of the commune were re=
 ported as 220 teachers and students from Tungchi, 30
 designers from the Institute, and three engineering
 teams of 900 men from the construction bureau.  The
 commune was governed by two three-way alliances:  the
 first, and probably the most dominant, was an alliance
 of "revolutionary leading cadres"  (probably Party and
 government cadres), leaders of the revolutionary masses
 (Red Guards), and "militia-men."  The second three-way
 alliance was composed of educational, designing, and
 construction personnel.  The first alliance was pro-
 bably responsible for administering and overseeing the
 commune, while the latter was probably responsible for
 conducting education.
 The academic departments of the university were
 abolished, and in their place a number of "Special
 Committees" were established.  Each of these committees
 was composed of -members of the university, and members
 of the production and'design'units forming the-commune.,

 Within each committee there were a number of "tuition
 classes," each containing teachers, students, workers,
 and engineers, all of whom were organized into "military
 teams." At each level of the commune, the plan called
 for a "Political Work Department"' within each Special
 Committee there was to be a "political instructor'," and
 in every tuition class there was to be a "political
 officer. "
 Although the commune was designed to assure con-
 trol by the political structure built into the organiza-
 tion, there are indications that the curriculum reform
 discussed was describing a program less politically
 oriented than other data have led us to anticipate.
 The length of schooling was reduced from five or six
 years to three years, and the preliminary discussion
 of the reforms duly emphasized Mao's writings and
 militia training.   The description of the new curriculum,
 however, demonstrated a somewhat apolitical content.
 The plan stated that "academic courses will be devoted
 more and more to theoretical studies from year to year
 in   proportionally progressive manner."  The plan
 out.ined the following three year schedule:
 Ist Year.
 ~~-'Each student should devote his time to building
 and construction."
 Ind year.
 Under the guidance of technical personnel or
 teachers concerned, he should devote two thirds
 of his time to mastering basic knowledge about
 designing through participation in practical
 designing work."
 3rd Year.
 The student "should strengthen the study of
 special courses selectively, while devoting part
 of his time to productive labor."
 In implementing this design, the commune established three
 experimental centers attached to construction sites, each
 with two classes of more than thirty teachers and students.
 On each of the construction' sites being used as "experi-
 mental points" there was one engineering team composed of
 about three hundred production workers and some designers.

 Summary
 Tungchi University, as the "7 May Commune," combines
 all of the basic elements of Mao's educational revolution
 while at the same time its planned three-year curriculum
 describes an acceptable program for producing narrowly
 trained civil engineers. To this somewhat vocation-oriented
 training has to be added the presence of the East China
 Design and Research Institute as a possible source of post-
 graduate training.  The plan for the commune called for
 progressively more theoretical work in each year, and in
 the third year a student could select courses.   It is,
 therefore, entirely possible that a student attending the
 new Tungchi could in fact obtain effective preparation in
 the specialties that make up the training of a civil engineer.
 The control apparatus, composed of the three-way
 alliances, the Political Work Departments, and the politi-
 cal instructors, commissars, and officers, reflects the
 traditional watch-dog system that was part and parcel. of
 the educational system prior to the cultural revolution.
 The effect of this apparatus on the process and content of
 education will be determined by tu;e extent to which politi-
 cal training is inserted into the students' daily schedule.
 It is possible that the combination of an abbreviated
 curriculum, physical labor, Mao-think sessions, small-group
 "daily life" discussions, and military training will ef-
 fectively narro;?' the students' preparation to the bare
 essentials of a civil engineer, or any other field of
 specialization.  At the present time it is impossible to
 judge whether or not unduly emphasized political training
 will undercut even the truncated program prepared by
 Tungchi's commune.  The formula presented, however, con-
 tains the essence of Mao's reform goals; but implementation
 of the policies will be the final test of the new system.

 The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant:   The Factory Model
 Although  T ungchi's commune was touted as a national
 model as late as September 1968, Mao's July directive on
 universities and colleges of science and engineering referred
 specifically to the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant.  Thus this
 factory became another national model.
 The "investigation report" broadcast from Shanghai
 on 22 July discussed at some length this plant's
 experience with both college graduates and technicians
 "promoted from among the ranks of the workers."  Following
 the style established by practically all investigation
 reports illuminating national models, it .as determined
 that the formal academic training of the college graduates
 attached to the plant had not equipped them for production
 roles in the factory.   The worker technicians, on the other
 hand, were among the most valuable assets of the plant.
 The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, drawing on Mao's thought
 and its experience since the 1958 reforms, proposed that
 future technical and engineering students should be recruited
 from among junior and senior middle school graduates who
 had two to four years experience in productive labor.
 Furthermore,  in order to assure commitment to Mao's egali-
 tarian values,            the college students should participate in
 manual labor while attending school, and following gradua-
 tion they should work as laborers   for a period of time
 and win "qualification certificates" from the workers
 before receiving job assignments.
 Some two months after making the above proposals,
 the Shanghai plant established the "7.1 July Workers
 University"--names! in honor of Mao's directive on colleges
 and universities of science and engineering.   Although
 this "university" was obviously designed to be a national
 model, few details on its organization or the content of
 its curriculum were given.  Essentially, this model follows
 the pattern of advanced half-work, half-study programs set
 up in the middle 1960's.   The course will last from eighteen

 months to two years, and will produce individuals trained
 in the design and manufacture of industrial grinding and
 cutting tools.  The various parts of the curriculum
 will be taught by workers,  technicians, and engineers
 at the factory, and the students will be recruited from
 among workers with actual production experience.  The ini-
 tial enrollment of fifty-two students all, reportedly,
 have a minimum of five years experience in production.
 Summary
 The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant's "university" was
 established as a model for future factory based, college
 level, vocational courses.  To a certain extent, middle
 school graduates could be trained to assist in the design
 and modification of machine tools by working with the
 production of existing models.  This Shanghai plant is
 an appropriate base for such training, for it is recog-
 nized as one of the most advanced production plants in
 China.  Prior to the cultural revolution, the plant was
 reportedly conducting classes at the junior middle school,
 senior middle school, and college level.   Yet this experi-
 ence was referred to only elliptically.  For example, one
 of its model workers,  rather than being a graduate of its
 own schools, was a graduate of the Shanghai Institute of
 Mechanical Engineering.
 Even assuming the capacity to produce skilled
 technicians,  and to some extent engineers,  unless a factory
 has an extensive research capacity it will not be capable
 of producing the necessary basic research involved in
 its own products.  The Tungchi commune data indicate
 the possibility of a research capacity, but the reporting
 on proposals affecting science and engineering research
 facilities--proposals that ideologically drew on the
 Shanghai Machine Tool Plant'-; experience--has given some-
 what firmer indicators of the future form of China's
 research establishments.

 The Shanghai Institute of Mechanical Engineering and the
 Peking Aviation Institute:   The Research Factor.
 The research institutes of the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences and its various branches, as well as all other
 research centers, with the possible exception of national
 defense related centers, have been seriously effected by
 the cultural revolution.   Propaganda teams have been vari-
 ously reported as entering research institutes, and individ-
 ual examples of the process of reform and revolution have
 been described in the press and broadcasts.   Even though
 there are very little data on the universities and colleges,
 even less have appeared relating to research centers.
 Nevertheless, there have been two reports that refer spe-
 cifically to the problem of research within the new
 educational system.
 An "investigation report" on the Shanghai Institute
 of Mechanical Engineering published by Red Flag (#3) on
 10 September 1968, and a proposal put forward by the Revo-
 lutionary Committee of the Peking Aviation Institute
 discussed the role of research.  The Shanghai school's
 recommendations discussed research in general, and the
 Peking Aviation Institute's proposal's referred to research
 centers related to national defense projects.
 The Shanghai Institute of Mechanical Engineering,
 bowing    to the "road shown by the Shanghai Machine Tool
 Plant," proposed that following their "transformation"
 colleges of science and engineering should become "facto
 ries and research units" as well as schools.   It was
 recommended that actual production and research units
 should propose research topics to the colleges.   The
 stated purpose of this suggestion was that by dealing
 with problems set by production units and research units,
 the students would be able to relate their studies to
 actual problems rather than become involved in "empty
 theorizing and scholasticism."  It should be emphasized
 that the proposal stressed the contribution such a system

 would make to the students' problem solving and analytical
 powers, thus making education serve productive labor.
 The stress on developing analytical powers contradicts
 the basic format of "simplifying" scientific and engineer-
 ing courses, for in fact research requires the discrete
 separation of components of a problem.   Nevertheless, the
 ideological statement of purpose fulfills  the political
 requirements of the current campaign.
 The Shanghai engineering school's recommendation did
 not include any specific proposals for structurally relating
 or integrating the university with production and research
 units, but the concept developed dove-tails with a proposal
 made by the Peking Aviation Institute in March 1968.   The
 aviation institute's recommendations referred specifically
 to the design of a "new kind of" national defense research
 institute, and proposed that research laboratories combine
 with school factories and shops of "various departments
 to form a unified teaching, scientific research and pro-
 duction base."  The task of this new structure was defined
 as "national defense research and trial manufacture."   In
 addition, this new organization would "meet all the practi-
 cal teaching requirements" of the new educational system.
 It will be noticed that the two proposals are very
 similar, conceptually, to the three-part "commune" of
 Tungchi University in which production, research and
 educational facilities were combined into one administra-
 tive structure and integrated functionally.   Assuming that
 the "research units" are the various institutes of the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences and other research organiza-
 tions, and that the role of the "production units" can
 be filled by the plants under the administration of the
 various central ministries, it is possible that a cumber-
 some but functioning research capacity could be developed
 along the lines sketched out by the proposals.  Where
 production units, research units, and universities are
 located physically close to one another, the research
 factor could in fact be made a functional aspect of the
 new educational system.   Students could be trained in the
 classroom, the laboratory, and the production line while
 engaged in their formal education.

 Summary
 With the entire structure of research facilities
 undergoing "transformation" at the hands of the propaganda
 teams, it is quite difficult to project the future form of
 China's research capacity.  However,  it is evident that
 in the process of developing and experimenting with a new
 educational system, the need for research capabilities
 has a very special place in the discussion.  The image of
 current developments now being projected indicates that
 the reforms will not irreparably damage Chinese research
 capacity.  There is a definite pattern appearing in which
 institutions of higher education will complement their
 production of narrowly trained technicians with research-
 oriented products.   The present atmosphere,nonetheless,
 is not conducive to producing the number of advanced
 research personnel that the state could profitably use
 in both its special weapons and other defense related
 research, let alone the number that could be used in
 basic research related to industrial and agricultural
 development.  Clearly China can use the technicians that
 will be produced from the abbreviated curricula now being
 contemplated, but for continuing development it is essen-
 tial that these products be complemented by the development
 of individuals capable of engaging in basic research.
 B.  Educational Reform:  Primary and Middle Schools
 Distinct from higher education,  the press and
 international and domestic broadcasts have been replete
 with examples of reform and the process of reform in
 China's primary and secondary education.   In the urban
 areas the immediate catalyst for change has been the
 Worker-PLA Propaganda Team, and in the rural areas the
 Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Propaganda Team has been
 the tool of reform, usually accompanied by a "representa-
 tive"of the PLA.

 The basic pattern of administrative reform in the
 urban, suburban, and rural areas has been the same.  At
 least superficially, the schools have been placed within
 the administrative responsibility of local production
 units.   In urban areas the schools have come under a factory
 or factories,  in suburban areas under the dual control of
 a factory and a commune or production brigade, and in the
 rural areas under the control of the commune and the pro-
 duction brigade.   There are variations on the basic pattern,
 but the overall thrust of the reform is to integrate
 schools with production units.
 Mao's attempt to create a mass society with a common
 Maoist value structure, and his attempt to block a strati-
 fication of society based upon levels of education is as
 apparent at the primary and middle school level as it is
 in higher education.   As in the past  however,  the applica-
 tion of policy will finally determin, the effectiveness
 of the original decision(s).
 Primary and Middle Schools:  The Rural Experiment.
 The basic policy is to move the primary and middle
 schools down one step in the administrative ladder, and
 to place schools under the direction of production units.
 Middle schools are to be administered by the communes,
 and primary schools by the production brigade.   This
 basic policy is subject to modifications designed to
 meet the requirements of particular kinds of schools
 (e.g., the agricultural middle school) and more discrete
 reforms within particular communes and production brigades.
 Within the individual commune, the new educational
 system is designed to provide a five-year general primary
 school course at the production brigade level, and a f our-
 year middle school course at the commune level.   In
 addition, within each commune a number of "advanced"
 primary schools have had junior middle school courses
 added to their curriculum, thereby providing a basic
 seven-year course within'  the brigade.   The last two

 years of the seven-year course are designed to provide
 basic agricultural knowledge geared to the needs of the
 brigade.   Ideally, under this latter system, a student
 would enter primary school at age six or seven and complete
 the course at age 13 or 14 ready to participate in agri-
 cultural production as a literate, skilled agricultural
 worker.   There are indications that the commune will also
 run a central primary school and middle school that will,
 to all intents and purposes, be the academic center of
 the commune, as opposed to the brigade primary and junior
 middle schools, and the general middle schools.  These
 latter are designed to be primarily vocational training
 schools, whereas the central primary and middle school(s)
 will probably be weighted more to the academic.
 Even though the rural school system will come
 under the administrative responsibility of the commune,
 the county level structure--the county revolutionary
 committee--appears to have general responsibility for
 the educational system.  The county level Party and
 governmental structures have been functionally abolished,
 at least for the time being, and the various cultural,
 educational, and propaganda functions have been integrated
 into the revolutionary committee.   It is possible, although
 there is no evidence for this, that the various governmental
 and Party structures that administered and supervised
 education prior to the cultural revolution still exist
 and have their own unit level revolutionary committees.
 At this time, however, there are no data indicating that
 such units are involved in educational reform,  although
 individuals from pre-existing structures may be involved.
 The process of reform is fairly uniform.   Typically,
 a three-in-one education leadership group, or educational
 revolution committee, is formed at the commune and brigade
 levels.   The  committee is frequently composed of a secre-
 tary of the Party branch, the chairman of the poor and
 lower-middle peasant association, and the unit's militia
 commander.  Other reports describe the three-in-one
 combination as composed of "revolutionary cadres, revo-
 lutionary teachers and students, and representatives of
 the poor and lower-middle peasants." Each school and each

 class in the school will also form its leadership group.
 The peasants are always described as the core of the
 leadership group, but it is more likely that control is
 actually in the hands of Party cadres and the PLA.
 The faculty of the rural school is composed of both
 full-time teachers and part-time lecturers drawn from the
 members of the commune and brigade.   The curriculum now
 being developed reflects the intent of the new system.
 Political education takes two basic forms:   the history
 of the village is taught by peasants who "recall the evils
 of the past;" and cadres of the commune, production brigade
 and production team lecture on current political issues.
 In addition to this direct political education,  the courses
 in Chinese language have been completely converted to polit-
 ical indoctrination.   Reports of new text books indicate
 that the "thought of Mao Tse-tung" is the core of the
 new reading primers. Similarly, "politics" is now taught
 at the primary school level.  One report describes the
 fifty-six lessons that constitute the political curriculum;
 thirty-six lessons are devoted to quotations from Chairman
 Mao, five are instructions from Lin Piao, and the remaining
 fifteen are ballads praising Mao.
 The second focus of the new system is vocational
 training.  Farm technicians and peasants now lecture on
 farm machinery and agricultural techniques, and brigade
 accountants lecture on applied arithmetic.   In addition
 to the vocational training, the PLA or the local militia
 are to teach military affairs and physical training.
 "Military affairs," however, will include more political
 indoctrination.
 PLEA influence in the rural schools is also found
 in the reorganization of the schools along military lines.
 The student body is to be organized into squads, platoons,
 and compvnies.   Similarly, a new student organization has
 apparently been created to replace the Young Pioneers:
 the "Young Red Soldiers."  This new student organization
 is not based upon the school but the production brigade,
 and each brigade will form a battalion of "Young Red

 Soldiers" which will be broken down into squads, platoons
 and companies at the production team level.
 The integration of the middle and primary schools
 into the commune has led to some rather complicated finan-
 cial problems.  Under the new system, the teachers are to
 be paid on the basis of work-points.   This is essentially
 a process whereby individuals are paid in kind for the
 work they do.   The work of teachers is to be measured by
 political criteria, but the teachers are also to be
 subsidized for their professional expenses, and for sup-
 port of and travel to their families, if the families do
 not live in the brigade or commune where the teacher
 works.   As the teachers were paid on a monthly basis by the
 state prior to their integration into the commune, they had
 not accrued any work-points.  Under these conditions,  it
 was decided that the state should pay the commune a lump-
 sum to subsidize the teachers until they had accrued
 sufficient work-points to receive food distributed by the
 commune.  As commune and brigade members, the teachers
 would normally receive food and other allotments on the
 basis of accrued work points.   Similarly, the state will
 subsidize teachers for their special pru'Lessional expenses
 and for support of their families.   The amount of the
 subsidy will be determined by the unit in which they work.
 Half-work, Half-Study Schools.
 In addition to the full-time primary and middle
 schools, and even though the new system includes physical
 labor as part of the curriculum, -,:he half-work, half-study
 schools are still included in the rural educational system.
 The agricultural middle School appears to be the adminis-
 trative responsibility of the commune, but the schools
 themselves are established at both the commune and brigade
 level.

 The structure of the faculty, curriculum, and
 control organs follows the same pattern as the "full-time"
 educational system.  Education leading groups or educa-
 tional revolution committees are set up at the commune
 and brigade level, and may even be identical to those
 responsible for the "full-time" system.  Once again, it
 is apparent that the Party cadres are the real source of
 influence.   In Inner Mongolia, for example, a secretary
 of the brigade Party branch was identified as the chairman
 of the agricultural middle school under investigation.
 In Kirin, a report on an agricultural middle school identi-
 fies the First Secretary of the commune Party branch as
 the principal.
 As in the past, agricultural middle schools are
 two-year vocational courses in which the curriculum focuses
 on the particular needs of the commune or brigade in
 which the school is located.   Distinct from reporting in
 the middle 1960's, however, is the heavy emphasis now
 put on political education and indoctrination.   A report
 analyzing an agricultural middle school in Kiangsi de-
 scribes the curriculum and work experience that the school
 provides in tea growing techniques, preliminary tea process-
 ing, and laying out tea garCens.  However, apparently in
 order to provide time for pslitical education, formal
 courses in Chinese and political science have been dropped.
 Chinese language is now taught through Mao's works and
 his latest instructions, and political science concen-
 trates on Mao's analyses of revolution and his latest
 instructions.  Undoubtedly prior to the cultural revolu-
 tion these courses contained a significant, if not
 excessive amount of political indoctrination, but the
 new system explicitly states that Mao's thought and
 current political topics are the core of the courses.
 The reform in rural education at this time is
 attempting to combine ideological and vocational training in
 Order to assure that, Mao's goals for revolutionary successors
 areinot frustrated by the educational system.  The pro-
 duction units to which the schools are now attached have

 been given the responsibility of assuring that education
 does not separate itself from production.  Regardless of
 the discussion in the press of half-wort;, half-study
 schools,  it is quite evident that, as Mao stated long ago,
 the new educational system is designed to be a half-work,
 half-study process.  The half-work, half-study middle
 schools, and the two years of junior middle school courses
 attached to a few selected primary schools in the production
 brigade, are designed for students whc,;e education will
 terminate at the junior middle school level.  This is indi-
 cated by the system of enrollment for the agricultural
 middle schools which provides that the students be selected
 by the brigade from among students recommended by the com-
 mune.                       The "full-time" system is designed to continue
 through senior middle school, but even this process has
 been abbreviated from 12 years to eight or nine years.
 The new system, as it is publicly discussed, con-
 tains some elements of common sense.   If the new curricula
 produce literate,  trained, agricultural specialists familiar
 with the particular needs of the area in which they will
 work, the new educational system would provide a human
 resource for improving China's agricultural base.   The
 weakness of the system'is that'it makes no apparent provi-
 sion for preparing individuals for university work in the
 agricultural sciences.  The necessary background in
 mathematics, chemistry, and other hard sciences is so far
 lacking in any reported curricula.   Furthermore,  the sys-
 tem is obviously designed in part to negate any initiative
 the student might have to seek a university education.
 At this time, it is difficult to determine exactly
 how the new reforms will be applied.   It is quite likely,
 given past reforms of the educational system, that the
 central primary and middle schools apparently being
 established at the commune level will be a source of
 trained students who have been selected for university
 training.   It should also be noted that, at this time,
 references to central or commune level combined primary
 and middle schools are absent from the public discussions
 of reform, and that references to central primary and mid-
 dle schools are very rare.   The ideal today is to provide

 primary and junior middle schools for students in their
 own villages, or where they will have to walk no further
 than three li (one mile) to junior middle school.  The
 greatest emphasis has been on the primary-junior middle
 school combination and the half-work, half-study schools.
 Primary and Middle Schools:  The Urban Experiment
 The urban experiment follows the same pattern as
 the reforms in the rural areas.  Middle and primary schools
 are placed under the direct c^_nt:al of production units--
 usually factories--, except in ?..uburban areas where the
 schools are administered jointly by factories and rural
 production brigades.  As in the rural areas, there are no
 indications that the former government and Party structures
 responsible for education are functioning in the new
 system.  Control today is in the hands of the revolutionary
 committees of the municipalities aid factories, and the PLA.
 One marked difference in the process of establish-
 ing control and effecting reforms in individual schools in
 the rural and urban areas is to be found in the role of
 the propaganda teams.   In rural areas, the propaganda
 teams move from village to village, perhaps leaving a
 representative(s) in the brigade.   The responsibility for
 reform is assumed by the "education leading group" or the
 "educational revolution committee."   In the urban areas,
 the factory would send its propaganda team to a particular
 school, and it would remain in the school overseeing the
 reforms.  The propaganda team in an urban school conducts
 the "purification" campaigns, and the Mao Tse-tung thought
 classes, and leads teachers and students in manual labor.
 The primary cause of this difference is the role urban
 middle school Red Guards played in the cultural revolution;
 it is apparent that the level of violence in the urban
 schools was significantly higher than in the rural areas.
 One measure of the problem as it existed, and to some ex-
 tent still exists in the urban schools, is that reporting
 on the "revolution in education" began much later in
 urban schools than it did in the rural areas of China.

 Middle Schools
 The basic techniques of tahtng over a school
 and proceeding with "purification" aid reform are similar
 in all of the reporting.   A factory would be assigned
 the responsibility for a middle school located near the
 plant, probably under a municipality-wide plan created by
 the city's revolutionary committee.   The factory would then
 send a propaganda team, with PLA support, to the school
 and abolish any previous revolutionary committee the school
 may have established, together with any existing student
 organizations.   The school then became a department of the
 factory under the direction of an "education leading gr-up"
 or "educational revolution committee," headed by a vice-
 chairman of the factory's revolutionary committee  and
 composed of teachers and students from the school, workers
 from the factory, and representatives of the PLA and/or
 the militia.  T:tis committee, supervised by the factory's
 revolutionary committee, would structure a new revolutionary
 committee for the school.  The revolutionary committee
 thus constitutes the administrative and political leadership
 of the school, but the propaganda team is evidently responsi-
 ble for conducting the initial purge and the reforms that
 follow.
 The purge of the teachers and students is the  first
 step taken by the propaganda team.  Or. 2 September a propa-
 ganda team from the Tientsin Municipal Cable Factory entered
 a middle school, and its actions are representative of   the
 role of propaganda 'teams in most, if not all.,  urban middle
 schools.  After "cleaning up class ranks, " according to
 the People's Daily of 8 December, 77 teachers were left,
 42 percen of w om were from "families of exploiting
 classes" and/or "old-tyt?e" schools.   The:-A teachers were
 required to undergo reeducation by the wortters, peasants,
 and soldiers in order to remove their political blemist.es.
 One group of seven teachers went with "support-the-frontier
 youth" to Inner Mongolia.  Another group of 16 went with
 the students to engage in manual labor in the countryside
 and in the factories.   The remaining 23 went to the "grass-
 roots" to perform manual labor.

 Once a school's "class ranks" are "purified,"
 essentially a purge of the teachers and the most frac-
 tious Red Guards, the structure of the school itself is
 reorganized.  Each grade of the school becomes a military
 company.   A company committ7e is organized composed of
 workers, militiamen,and teachers and students.   Each company
 is then broken down into squads and platoons.
 The first stage in actual curriculum reform occurs
 during the establishment of classes in the thought of Mao
 Tse-tung and daily self-criticism sessions.     These classes
 are conducted by the propaganda team, but the PLA repre-
 sentative is the general overseer of the process.   While
 these intensive Mao-think classes are being conducted and
 students and teachers are being put through the self-
 criticism sessions, curriculum reform is undertaken.   The
 initial curriculum reforms reported stayed very close to
 the model established by the rural schools.  PLA or
 militiamen  taught political courses; workers lectured
 on basic industrial and agricultural knowledge; factory
 accountants taught basic mathematics.   The full-time
 teachers--those that remained--taught "revolutionary"
 literature and art, PLA and militiamen taught military
 affairs and physical education.
 This pattern of curriculum reform,  if it is followed,
 would be disastrous. in terms of preparation for the uni-
 versity.                 On 7 March, however, a People's Daily article
 reporting on the status of the revolution in education
 at the Canton #61 Middle School indicated that the first
 blush of reform may not, in fact, reflect the future of
 China's educational system.   The argument presented in
 the report stated that Mao's directive that, "in addition
 to their studies, /students7 should learn other things,"
 includes the study of "socialist culture."  The curriculum
 of this particular school, under this rubric, was developed
 to include the Chinese language,  foreign languages  (not
 specified), mathematics "beginning with abacus, calcula-
 tion and survey;" physics, including dynamics, electricity,
 and "other things;" basic chemistry, industrial chemistry,
 agricult:iral chemistry, and national defense chemistry.

 The expressed purpose for introducing foreign languages
 into the curriculum was "to satisfy the needs for the
 development of science and technology and world revo-
 lution."   Not only was the need for studying science
 and technology recognized as a contribution to both
 industry and agriculture, but the need to study foreign
 languages to implement such studies was also recognized.
 The clear implication is that students need to study
 foreign languages in order to read foreign texts and jour-
 nals.  Since such skills are primarily applicable to college
 level work, the further implication is that, at least at
 this school in Canton, students are to be prepared for
 university work.
 The report on the Canton #61 Middle School is, to
 the author's knowledge, the first and only such report of
 this kind, and most of the reporting continues to stress
 the vocational aspects of the new curriculum.  Students
 and teachers as part of the new education process mill
 participate in productive labor, primarily in the factories,
 but also in nearby production brigades.  The manner in
 which students and teachers will divide their time between
 manual labor and classroom studies is not yet clear.
 Kwangming Daily on 5 January described the system being
 used at the Penhsi, Liaoning Province, #14 Middle School,
 and this system could become standard practice.   The
 teachers and students were divided into four groups; one
 group studied in the school while the three other groups
 aent separately +o a factory, the countryside, and a local
 armed forces camp for labor and military training.   Eac?I
 group spent one month in the plant, two weeks on a commune,
 and two weeks with the local armed forces.  The propaganda
 team divided up responsibility for the students and was
 responsible for the individual groups.
 Primary Schools
 Primary schools follow the same pattern of reform
 as the middle schools, but there are variations designed
 to meet the particular role and problems of primary
 schools.  The main difference between primary and middle

 schools is that many of the former are two-session
 schools and many of the children are too young to per-
 form physical labor.                         Administratively, primary schools
 are beii:g placed under the wings of factories, neighbor-
 hood revolutionary committees and street committees.  The
 factory propaganda team admits members of these committees
 into the primary school education leading group,and coop-
 erates with the neighborhood and street committees in
 organizing student activities outside the school.
 The children are organized into squads, platoons,
 and companies according to their residences, and the "Young
 Red Soldiers" appear to be the successor to the Young
 Pioneers as the principal student youth organization.
 The Young Red Soldiers,  together with other students,  organ-
 ize Mao Tse-tung's thought sessions outside school, and
 the neighborhood committee provides space and political
 instructors.   In addition, the Young Red Soldiers are
 organized into propaganda teams and are regularly sent
 out into the streets, factories, and rural areas to take
 part in propaganda activity.  Some reports state that
 the older children participate in manual labor, and when
 they do they take along the younger children.   The teams
 also have two hours of organized team activity each day,
 most of which is passed in political song-fests and dances.
 There are no details on primary school curriculum
 reform, but there is no'  reason to believe that the goals
 and content differ in any marked way from middle school
 curricula.  Reading and other exercises will be drawn
 from Mao's writings, and whatever substantive knowledge
 is imparted to them will undoubtedly focus on industry
 and agriculture.
 Half-Work, Half-Study Schools
 Half-work, half-study schools in the urban areas
 have c-1we under the same kind of criticism leveled at the
 rural agricultural schools.   According to the reports in
 the press, the half work, half-study schools established
 in the 1960's have, "from the very First day," been

 undermined by individuals who taught the students to
 value the goals of "bourgeois technicians."  Mathematics,
 dynamics, mechanical drawing and other abstract academic
 subjects took precedence over Mao's thought and politics
 The propaganda teams from the factories administering
 these schools, with assistance from the PLA, purged the
 ranks of the teachers and began to return the schools to
 their original orientation.  Curriculum reform involved
 the restoration of the original vocational classes, and
 the emphasis of vocational training was complemented by
 the stated concern of assuring that the student workers
 who attended the schools would return to their factories
 when they had completed their training.  Usually the course
 conducted at the half-work, half-study school was cut in
 half, and modifications were introduced to assure a high
 'evel of political indoctrination.
 Enrollment for the half-work, half-study schools
 follows the pattern set when the schools were established.
 They are to recruit from middle school graduates, or
 from workers engaged in the same areas covered by the
 schools' curricula.  Middle school graduates, however,
 must work in the factory to which the school is attached
 fcr three to six months prior to beginning their studies.
 Primary emphasis in the half-work, half-study
 schools is on abolishing the deviations that became common
 prior to the cultural revolution.   Essentially, and perhaps
 naturally,  the schools sought better educated students
 and began to emphasize classroom studies rather than
 integrating these studies with actual factory production
 problems.   It is even reported that some schools established
 research departments, and more and more the vocational tra:ir. ing
 focus of the schools began to fade away.  This probably
 .Is an accurate description of developments in the larger
 r,lants, such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant discussed
 above, where advanced courses would be an ideal way to
 develop technicians capable of contributing to the plart's
 research capacity.

 Urban Schools: Summary
 The highly politicized and narrow vocational cur-
 ricula described in the press and provincial, national,
 and international broadcasts follow Mao's predispositions
 toward the type of education most suitable for creating
 the new Chinese man.  His ambitions, according to Mao's
 fiat, are to be narrowed by creating a system that almost
 explicitly states that the factory and the commune are
 to be his ultimate end.   Nevertheless, the report on the
 Cantor. #61 Middle School provides sufficient cause to
 speculate that some schools will in fact prepare students
 for the university.
 Prior to the cultural revolution, there is no doubt
 that many Chinese students sought a university education.
 Certainly by the time a student had entered senior middle
 school his sights would be set on a university.  Whether
 or not the new curricula and administrative structure will
 in fact lower the ambitions of a student is a matter of
 conjecture, but there is no doubt that one of the functions
 of the new educational system is to change the aspirations
 of the student.
 If the policies now being applied are implemented
 with little consideration for the effects they will have
 on higher education,  thin even if students are admitted
 to a university they will be far from adequately prepared,
 even by Chinese standards.  There is the distinct possi-
 bility, however, that specialized senior middle schools
 will emerge whose primary function will be to prepare
 univer,,ity students.  At the present time, however, the
 data do not permit us to make any firm judgements.

 III.   CONCLUSIONS AND SPECULATIONS
 The current reforms stem from Mao's longstanding
 distrust of the intellectuals.   This distrust is based
 upon Mao's perception of the intelligentsia as an elite
 structure competing with the Party for a leadership role
 in the society.      Traditionally the Chinese intellectual
 has seen himself as a member of an elite, and in imperial
 times this elite did administer the state and have the
 predominant leadership role in society.   An enduring value
 of the society was, and is, to use the academic ladder
 for social and political mobility.
 After gaining control of the mainland in 1949,
 the Chinese Communist Party set itself the tasks of
 industrializing the state while at the same time it
 crr.ated a new political system and fundamentally recast
 the social system.  Rapid economic development was an
 obvious goal, and the new political system was designed
 to structure the absolute control of t'e Party.  Revolu-
 tionizing society, however, was the mo,it difficult goal
 to achieve because it required the restructuring of some
 of the major values of the society.   It was this goal
 that was to complicate the achievement of the goals set
 for the political and economic systems.
 The process of education became a major target of
 x?eforms, for it was to be used as the principal tool for
 restructuring the value structure and be the source of
 'worthy successors" to Mao's revolution.  Howeve.L?, the
 goal of rapid economic development was also to be sought
 through the utilization of the products of the educational
 system, and thus the two functions of the educational
 system resulted in conflicting goals and policies.  On
 the one hand the state needed to produce large numbers
 of scientists, engineers, mathematicians, administrators,
 and other professionals to build and supervise an advanced
 industrial state; on the other hand, the new political
 leadership was demanding a loyalty to Mao and the Party

 that approached a demand for fanaticism.   The result of
 these conflicting demands was an educational system that
 compromised academic achievement in favor of intense
 political socialization.
 The intensity of the political demands on the edu-
 cational system varied,  the highest                          threshold prior to
 the current period being achieved during the Great Leap
 Forward of 1958-1960.   Indeed, many of the current reforms
 can be traced back to this period.   Following the Great
 Leap Forward, there was a period of retrenchment in which
 the educational system was directed to recover some of
 the ground it had lost during those disastrous years.
 In 1963-65, however, Mao revived his educational reform
 goals and nation-wide experiments were conducted in the
 development of vocational high schools and vocationally-
 oriented college level courses..   During this period pre-
 ceeding the cultural revolution, there was an attempt to
 create an educational system that essentially divided
 the students into two groups.   The brighter students
 went through the full-time education process that cul-
 minated in advanced university degrees, while the less
 talented were channelled through a vocational process
 that combined classroom studies with experience in indus-
 trial and agricultural production.   This dual system was
 to become a target of Mao's wrath, primarily because, in
 Mao's eyes, it still produced intellectual aristocrats
 of dubious political reliability, and the technicians
 produced by the vocational system were absorbing "bourgeois"
 values from their instructors in the classrooms.   In Mao's
 view, the problem of the intellectual elite had yet to
 be solved.
 The reforms introduced by the cultural revolution
 bear Mao's mark; his fears and perceptions are the source
 of the current "educational revolution."  Once again the
 academic content of the educational system has been
 sacrificed to the political goals of creating a new Chinese
 man. The use of the educational system to restructure
 the values of China's youth has, as in the past, been
 combined with an intensive campaign to "reeducate" the
 intelligentsia.   The process of the cultural revolution
 has struck a severe blow to the intelligentsia, and has
 made the life of an intellectual a politically dangerous

 goal.   For the student, even if he should continue to
 harbor academic excellence and the life of an academic
 as personal goals,  the prospects of achieving a univer-
 sity education are extremely poor.   The new system is
 designed to focus the students' goals on, at best, the
 role of a technician in a factory or on a rural commune.
 There is no clear picture evolving of the future Chinese
 university, but it is quite likely that for a year or so
 at least, with the exception of some institutions con-
 centrating on specialties deemed essential by the regime,
 it will produce only higher technicians.   Admittance to
 a university will require very strong political bona
 fides, and class background will prove to be an extremely
 important and rigidly applied criterion.
 Even assuming progress toward a university degree,
 the student will find this progress an extremely arduous
 experience if current reforms are r:.g;..dly and systematically
 implemented.   Physical labor in seccnc ry schools will
 be followed by a period of one, two, or three years of
 manual labor prior to enrollment in a university.   Thus
 a
 student's ambitions would have to be extremely strong

 he were to attempt to climb the academic ladder of
 success.
 There are,  however, some indications that the ex-
 treme aspects of the current reforms are beginning to be
 modified.   Articles and editorials in the press since
 last February have stressed the concept that "intellectuals
 must be given a way out," and that Mao's teachings on
 this have always been clear.   Nwangming Daily on 27 Febru-
 ary wrote:
 Cha'rman Mao teaches us:   'The great majority
 of the intellectuals of our country are will-
 ing to be progressive and to reform themselves,
 and can be reformed.'
 Nanfang Daily of Canton on 27 March editorialized:

 academic thinking may not be ostracized

 politically and are willing to follow
 Chairman Mao to make revolution.   Their
 useful knowledge is to be utilized to
 serve socialism.   (Emphasis added
 Stressing the long, drawn out process of "reeducation",
 the editorial continued:
 It is unrealistic to think that their
 [intellectuals] old ideas and work styles
 will be completely changed after they
 have attended a few meetings or gone to
 rural areas once or twice.
 The thrust of the policy is still clearly aimed at "re-
 education", but the intellectuals are not to be forced
 into immediate "transformation"; furthermore, it is
 clearly stated that their knowledge is to be utilized,
 In view of the cacophony of propaganda praising the
 inventiveness of the workers and peasants, and their
 osmotic inspiration from Moro Tse-tung, suchi observations
 may presage a relaxation of policy.
 Similar currents of propaganda can be observed
 being directed at the students.  The terrorizing of the
 intellectuals and the frontal assault on the educational
 system have raised doubts among the students as to the
 viability of an academic career and the usefulness of
 education.   The press has begun to respond to these
 doubts.   Shanghai's influential Wen Hui Pao on 18 March
 published an editorial on education directly confronting
 the student response to the effect of the cultural revolu-
 tion on education:
 In the current educational revolution there is
 also a need to criticize the concept of  you
 will get nothing out of study.'   This is but
 another form of the concept of 'studying to
 become an official,' and, similarly, it is a
 bourgeois ideology.   Some people, contaminated
 by Liu Shao-chi's fallacy of 'studying to
 become an official,' have the single interest

 of becoming officials and becoming rich.
 They use books as the rungs of a ladder
 to climb upward.  Finding that this road
 has been blocked., they have swung from one
 extreme to another.   Dispirited,  they
 spread such fallacies as 'Attending uni-
 versities is an error in orientation.
 Since we will have to do manual work, what
 is the use of studying.'
 The editorial ibserved that "study is still the thing when
 we enter a school, but it depends on how you go about
 doing it."  Studies are to serve the proletariat, accord-
 ing to the editorial, but the stuient should maintain
 his university oriented goals.
 This softening of the policies directed toward
 education has not been reflected in references to the
 reform of higher education.  Nevertheless, there are
 indications of dissatisfaction with the lack of progress
 toward educational reform in the universities.   Libera-
 tion Daily on 30 MarcL published an editorial concerning
 the universities,  telling the propaganda teams that the
 time had come to:
 ...boldly explore, courageously implement,
 and do our best to determine concrete
 methods on how to run the physics, engineer-
 ing, medical, and humanities departments
 of socialist universities.
 Evidently the purge of the universities has been slowing
 down progress toward the development of model universities
 designed to demonstrate the kinds of programs the new
 universities should be creating.  Wen Hui Pao on 29 March
 suggested that educational reforms could be "grasped"
 while at the same time "we are purifying class ranks."
 The emphasis in these and other editorials is on putting
 concrete reforms into practice, but thus far we have no
 indicators beyond the Tungchi University and Shanghai
 Machine Tool Plant experiments suggesting what modifica-
 tions will actually :tee made and how they will be imple-
 mented.

 The effect of the cultural revolution on China's
 educational system and the costs of this effect to China
 are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to measure.
 By June of this year China's educational system will have
 been out of production for three full years, and there
 are indications that the universities may remain closed
 for an additional two years.   Although the classes of
 1967 and 1968 have been "graduated"--the statuE of the
 '69 class is unclear--they have not completed their uni-
 versity or high school requirements.   Assuming a five
 year program, the class of 1960, will have completed three
 years'  training,  the class of 1967 four years,  and the
 class of 1969,  if it is graduated, will have completed
 only two years'  training.   For three years the universi-
 ties have failed to enroll any new students, and it is
 possible that students will not be enrolled this spring
 for classes beginning in the fall.   China has "graduated"
 between 340.000 and 510,000 students who have not com-
 pleted theiv university requirements,  assuming a gradua-
 tion of 170,000 students from institutions of higher
 education each year.  The number of middle school students
 "graduated" runs into the millions.
 Breaking down the 340,000 base, 131,000 would be
 engineers, 42,600 would be in medicine,  including health
 sciences and pharmacy, 28,800 would be in agricultural
 fields, 17,000 would be in natural science fields,
 42,600 would be in economics, political science, foreign
 languages and other fields.   Assuming that the institu-
 tions of higher education do not recruit students for the
 coming year,  the educational system will have failed to
 graduate approximately 680,000 students on time, and at
 a minimum the figure will be around 510,000.
 The number of living graduates of higher educa-
 tion in 1966 was estimated to be 1,879,000.   Thus the
 cultural revolution has cost China,  temporarily, an addi-
 tion of one-third to its higher education graduates.
 Tt-c :significance of these figures is impossible to
 evaluate with any degree of precision.   It can be argued
 that China was producing more university graduates than
 it could usefully employ prior to the cultural revolution;
 therefore, the numerical cost described above is not too

 significant.   Furthermore, 55 percent of the scientific
 and technical graduates were produced in the five-year
 period 1962-66; therefore, they are quite y')urg and the
 death rate is correspondingly low.   This characteristic,
 however, has to be modified by the observation that the
 average age of competent research and engineering leaders
 is h'.gher than we would expect because of the continuing
 dependence upon older scientists and engineers trained
 in Europe and the United States and scientists trained
 in the Soviet Union.   The buffer that the characteristic
 of youth provides for China is,  thus, not as effective
 as it might appear to be.
 The latter question raises one of the more serious
 costs of the cultural revolution--Ph.D.-level scientists.
 Data on China's post-graduate training are extremely
 scanty, but it has been estimated that by 1970 China
 would have produced some 6,500 Ph.D.-level scientists.
 The cultural revolution will probably reduce this number
 to some 3,000.   Thus the burden on China's older European
 and V.S.  trained scientists and the Russian trained
 specialists will not be reduced to the extent that it
 might have been, and the expansion of China's research
 capacity has been severely limited.
 The overall impact of the cultural revolution on
 educa-Li,:,n and its costs to China's nation l development
 goals span in terms of industrial and agricultural
 growth, and research and development capacity is also
 difficult to judge.   To some extent, this impact will
 be cushioned by the youth of China's body of higher
 education graduates.  Nevertheless, this cushion will
 lose its effectiveness, such as it is,  if the present
 reforms are pursued with vigor over the next year or so.
 It is still possible for China to Eeek its national
 defense-related goals by allocating teams of scientists
 to projects such as special weapons development, but
 such a decision draws from a pool of scientific minds
 that is quite small.  By allocating resources to nuclear
 weapons and delivery systems, for example, the regime
 cannot but avoid reducing the resources applicable to
 other, perhaps equally significant, developmental prob-
 lems such as nuclear power sources for industrial use
 and scientific approaches to agricultural development.

 Although it is possible for China to adjust its
 national defense-related projects to a lower expansion
 rate of scientists, engineers, mathematicians, etc., at
 the expense of other areas of national development, the
 more abstract costs to the educational system may be
 more difficult to correct.   The reign of terror that
 has been inflicted on China's educational system and
 its research structure has left a residue of fear among
 the intelligentsia and serious doubts among the students
 as to the viability of an academic car.er.   It should
 also be observed, however, that this is not the first
 time that the intelligentsia and aspirants for a place
 in this stratum have come under attack,   Mao has never
 disguised his distrust of the intellectuals, and the
 intelligentsia has been subjected to intense  olitical
 socialization for some twenty years.
 The campaign
 style of politics has led to a sophisticated behavior
 pattern that could easily lead to a perspective of the
 cultural revolution that permit,.; the ind~ ; idual to await,
 in his eyes, the inevitable relaxation of the policies,
 or at least a less vigorous implementation of the
 policies of reform.
 The impact of the cultural revolution on the in-
 tFlligentsia and the students cannot,  in fact,  be
 determined.  The national and regional press give indi-
 cations that the students are disillusioned and question
 the usefulness of a university education, and have grave
 doubts about proceeding along the academic path.   If the
 current policies are rigidly administered, China's youth
 will be reluctant to choose the academic ladw~r.   It is
 more likely, however, that the current indicators reflect
 a modification of the policy, and that the students and
 intellectuals will perceive the current extremes as a
 short range tactical effort.   Nevertheless,  it is apparent
 that Mao's views and objectives have not changed.  The
 political demands on the intelligentsia will continue to
 be high, but the awareness of the "rules of the game"

 Noi:etheiess,' the experiences of millions of Red Guards
 will reemphasize for them the unpredictability of regime
 policy.  Their new status is considerably below that which
 they probably expected from their earlier role as Mao's
 ?,A Mip., w...i
 illusionment with Mao's Ch.na will almost certainlylbe- L~.)nI
 come more common as the months pass.   Prior to the cultural
 revolution China's youth had little confidence in a pro-
 ductive life; now they probably have even less.  For many
 of China's youth, the ladder of success was either the
 Party or the university.   The Party has yet to be rebuilt,
 and the universities and research units are still being
 revolutionized.   Perception of these two structures as
 career goals will depend to a large extent on future de-
 velopments within them.                                      For the most part, most students
 certainly fear a life of servitude on the commune or in
 a factory with no clear way of avoiding such a fate,
 except possibly through a career in the People's Libera-
 tion Army.
