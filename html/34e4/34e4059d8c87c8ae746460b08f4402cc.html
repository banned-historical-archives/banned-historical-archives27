 GUIDE to COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #1
 Commentary
 28 Oct-10 Nov 1964
 Principal Developments:
 1.  The CPSU has continued to affirm, in authoritative editorials and
 in a major speech by Brezhnev on the 47th anniversary ofthe Soviet "October"
 Revolution, 7 November, that it will follow the same basic policies, with
 firm, though "unpolemical," support of all major positions opposed by the
 Chinese, including that of the necessity for a world Communist conference
 without further delay.  Although specific plans for the December preparatory
 meeting were not mentioned, the 2 November Tass communique on Moscow talks
 with the Austrian CP delegation stressed agreement on the need to "continue
 preparations" for a world meeting "and a meeting of the drafting committee."
 2.  Prevailing opinion among Moscow observers is that the December'
 meeting will be postponed, particularly in view of the Chou En-tai talks
 (see below), but one more highly appraised clandestine report (Noforn)
 quotes a top-level Czech Party ideologist as asserting as late as 5 Novem-
 ber that the 15 December meeting will definitely be held in Moscow.  Also,
 an authoritative 4 November clandestine report from Australia states that
 a 3-man delegation from the CPA to the Moscow preparatory meeting has al-
 ready booked passages
 3.  Most of the Soviet-oriented parties, including the 5 which had
 sent "fact-finding" delegations to Moscow, have apparently decided to ac-
 cept and support publicly the Soviet action in ousting Khrushchev and to
 quash further expression of concern regarding his treatment and fate,
 though sketchy reporting indicates that questions, doubts, misgivings and
 resentment on this issue are far from settled among most party leaders and
 rank-and-files  The Italian delegation leader publicly admitted that the
 Soviet explanations were "not sufficient" to make them abandon their "re-
 servations," though the Party's subsequent resolution played down any lack
 of harmony.  At least one of the visiting Party chiefs, Jesperson of Denmark,
 acknowledged that he had tried to see Krrushchev but was denied access on
 grounds of K's severe illness.
 4.  The Soviet 47th anniversary celebration brought unusually impres-
 sive high-level delegations to Moscow from most of the world's major CPs
 -- all ruling parties except the Albanians, who were not invited.  The CPSU
 was admittedly using the occasion for secret political talks on problems
 of the WCM -- on an individual rather than group basis -- but little reli-
 able information has leaked out.  Particular attention was focused on the
 strong CCP delegation headed by Premier Chou En-lai, considered the most
 "diplomatic" and "acceptable" to the CPSU of all top Chinese.  Chou was ap-
 parently endeavoring to persuade the CPSU to agree to another round of bi-
 lateral talks, postponing further action on calling a world conference in

 the interim:  as we close, with Chou still in Moscow, the press reports
 one "inside source" to the effect that the CPSU has agreed and another
 to'the effect that he is not aware of any agreement.  (No mention of K
 by any of the many Party leaders in Moscow for the anniversary has been
 reported.)
 5.  Although it can be said that the Chinese have refrained from
 polemics since the fall of K, they were coming very close to polemicizing
 as the period progressed.  All Peking papers on the 3rd carried a full
 page of comments by various other parties and leaders on the ouster, most
 of them critical of one or more aspects of the action.  On the 6th,
 People's Daily published the full texts of the 17 October and 1 November
 Pravda editorials, setting forth at length the Soviet intent to adhere to
 the same policies.  On the 7th PD followed with its own editorial which
 confidently recapitulated its own opposed views, gloated over the histori-
 cal vindication of its righteous struggle against K's revisionism demon-
 strated by his downfall (credit Icr ihich was given first to the Soviet
 people and only second to the Party), and made it clear that any reapproach--
 ment with the CPSU would have to be on Chinese terms.  Moreover, Chou in
 Moscow demonstratively visited Stalin's grave.
 6.  The Albanians, as so often in the past, charged out ahead of the
 Chinese, placing the blame on K and his group for a long list of betrayals;
 saying that K's downfall was the result of the struggle of the CCP, the
 Albanian Party, and their supporters; warning emphatically that K's ex-
 pulsion does not mark the end of K's revisionism; and pledging that all
 "Marxist-Leninists" will continue their struggle against "the perfidious
 line of the 20th and 22nd Congresses" until the "complete defeat" of the
 revisionists and  liquidation of the deformations made in M-L."  They de-
 clare that "many steps must be made in this direction," the most important
 of which is the proper rehabilitation of Stalin and his work.
 7.  Glorification of Stalin and demands for his rehabilitation were
 features of sharp polemics by pro-Chinese dissident elements in various
 countries:  the Austrian Rote Fain went on to ask about the execution or
 "shameful ouster" by Khrushchev of a host of other prominent Soviet Party
 leaders, -- MolotovC'the most important living representative of Old
 Bolshevism"), Malenkov, Kaganovich, Zhukov, Beriya, -- etc. on grounds
 which have never been divulged.
 8.  The period brought further evidence of the growing trend toward
 autonomy and independence among the parties.  Various acts of non-conformity
 have led to speculation that Czechoslovakia may be the next Communist state
 to follow Rumania on the "independence" trail.  The French CP announces that
 talks with a Yugoslav Party delegation led to agreement on closer collabora-
 tion, and the Norwegian CP announces that its delegation to Sofia reached
 a "united viewpoint" with the Bulgarian Party on various questions, includ-
 ing that of the situation in world comiun:Un,.                 Most striking of all, per-
 haps, was the Swedish CP decision to reduce its money-losing daily papers
 to weeklies and use the savings to set up its own school for party workers,
 thus ending, its dependence on E. Germany and the USSR for such training.

 9.  The disarray in the Communist cacao was sharply illuminated as the
 Italian fellow-traveling Paese Sera published on 30 October a Moscow report
 describing a 29-point Soviet document of the charges against K. (see Briefly
 Noted item, with translation of text) -- and the PCI's official daily L'Unita
 (printed in the same shop) on the next day denied the existence of the 29-
 point document but listed 14 points of accusation which had been reported
 from the USSR.  On the following day, the Rome independent weekly Espresso
 published a summary of "Suslov's report" indicting K, supposedly received
 from E. Berlin -- and Vass on 3 November.denounced this report as a fabrica-
 tion.
 Significance:
 The new CPSU leadership still has not settled down to a definite course:
 Brezhnev's 7 November speech, trying "to be all things to all men", indicates
 the uncertainty and vacillations of the new men.  In the meantime, however,
 they keep persuading friends and foes that they will pursue the old Khru-
 shchevian course even without old K.  At the same time, they are making
 visible progress in whipping their foreign allies and followers back into
 line, i.e. causing them., from Gomulka down, to make public obeisance to the
 new regime and to accept the fact that K. has become an "cuzperson".  However,
 close under this smooth surface we perceive continuing disquiet and misgiv-
 ings on all party levels; corrosive damage to the public image not only of
 the CPSU but of all Soviet-oriented CPs; and new impetus towards fragmenta-
 tion, "polycentrism" and autonomy for every national CP.
 It is still too early to forecast reliably the immediate future of
 the Sino-Soviet conflict:,  Most observers believe that the CPSU has yielded
 to Chou's persuasion (or heavy pressure from the Italians, Poles, Rumanians,
 etc.) and agreed to postpone the 26-party preparatory meeting for a world
 conference for a few months while they undertake another round of bilateral
 talks with the Chinese, attempting once more (at least for the record) to
 avoid the impending split in the world movement; there is, however, conflict-
 ing evidence even on this.
 It remains still very unlikely that even if a temporary modus vivendi
 between Moscow and Peking should be reached (and we must not underestimate
 the strong impact this would have on the Communist movement), this will lead
 to a satisfying resolution of the basic conflicts between the two great Com-
 munist powers.  Despite the difficulties and pressures under which the new
 Kremlin leaders are working, they have repeatedly reiterated their firm com-
 mitment to support all of the major pre-Khrushchev CPSU positions which the
 Cheese have opposed.  On the other side, the Chinese have come very close
 to resuming polemics in their arrogant reiteration of their "diametrically
 opposed" (to use their own phr.?ase) positions, and they have practically
 served notice that any rapprochement will have to be on their terms.  The
 Albanians may again have foreshadowed the Chinese line when they emphasized
 that it was Khrushchev and his group who were to blame for all the betrayals
 which they (and the Chinese) have denounced so vituperously in the past,
 that the removal of K alone can be considered only the first step toward
 an improvement, the most important single step being the full rehabilitation

 (Commentary Cont.)
 Approved For Release 1999/     ~ClA-RDP78-03061AO00300020005-3
 of Stalin and the "liquidation of the deformations made in M-L" by "the
 perfidious line of the 20th and 22nd Congresses."
 This call for the rehabilitation of Stalin also appears in the other pro-
 Chinese comment which we have seen during this period -- the Austrian Rote
 Fahne and the Belgian La Voix du Peuple -- and to the Chinese "non-polemical"
 7 November statement., although the latter limited itself to crediting Stalin
 along with Lenin for leading the Soviet people to their great achievements.
 Treatment:
 1.   We continue along the lines suggested in Guide #1O, especially
 a.  we keep Khrushchev before world public opinion and prevent his
 being turned into an "unperson";
 b.  we expose the Stalinist and Khrushchevist past of the "new men";
 c.  we contrast what Communist leaders and media said about K before
 and after 15 October.
 2.   We chide (gray in Social Democratic or other left-of-center outlets;
 or black) Soviet-.oriented leaders and parties (Gomuika, the French and Italian
 CPs, etc.) who at first protested the circumstances of K's ouster and now
 accept meekly the Kremlin's "line"; we press this line in interviews with Com-
 munist leaders and other official travelers returning from Moscow.  We encour-
 age all personal acquaintances of K to seek to visit, or communicate with him.
 We encourage questions about K's disappeared books and pictures (See also
 Propaganda Note #75/C).
 3.  We confront the new CPSU leaders -- and Moscow-oriented Communists
 everywhere -- with the new drive for the "rehabilitation" of Stalin, quoting
 the Albanian, dissident Belgian and other materials mentioned above.  We
 add black output attributed to Stalinists within the CPSU (Molotov?) and
 other pro Moscow CPs.  We start rumors like construction work at Lenin's
 mausoleum to restore Stalin?s corpse to its former place of honor.  We use
 cartoons showing Stalin's ghost appearing to Brezhnev & Co. reminding them
 that they owe their entire careers and their very lives to him, and so forth.
 4.  We speculate about the role of the KGB in K's downfall, relating it
 to the Schvirkmann incident, wondering about the future positions of Shelepin
 and other KGB bigwigs in the new regime and emphasizing that the Soviet Union
 remains under secret police control.
 5.  Contingency.  If it should be confirmed that the preparatory 26-CP
 meeting will actually be  p o s t p o n e d,  while Moscow attempts to ap-
 pease Mao and stops polemics against the Chinese, we should redouble our
 efforts to counter such rapprochement -- for instance by black re-distribution
 of previously produced polemics, of the venomous output of the splinter groups
 etc.  In letters and manifestoes attributed to pro-Soviet and anti Stalinist
 Communists (in the Bloc as well as in the free world), we should denounce any
 such postponement as a futile attempt to conceal the real issues, a shameful
 c a p i t u l a t i o n  before Mao's dogmatism, jeopardizing the -_, al-
 legedly continuing - policy of "peaceful co-existence."

 28 October-10 November 1964
 NOTE:  The extensive developments related to the CPSU's ouster of
 Khrushchev -- mostly focused on the 7 November anniversary of the
 Soviet Revolution during this period -- make it desirable to handle
 this issue in two parts like #40, i.e., the first presenting the
 few other items chronologically and the second a round-up review.
 October-November:  Issue No. 12, October-November 1964, of the elaborately
 published, Paris-based,pro-Chicom journal Revolution (we have the French
 edition in hand) announces that during the month of October they are pre-
 paring in Paris the first numbers of a new series in English and French
 and in Bogota No. 1 of a Spanish edition for =tin America, representing
 a total of 50,000 copies.  It also announces the following changes:
 a.  D. will become a bimonthly (instead of a monthly), increasing
 pages of the French edition by 33%,  of the English by 50~j, and will
 include a complete book (this issue prints Stalin's Principles of
 Leninism);
 b.  The price of the French edition will be increased 15% in  Europe
 and decreased 35% in the countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
 No increase in the price of the English edition.
 October 30:  In a press conference on his return from Peking, Tomomi
 Narita, head of the Ja   ese Socialist Party delegation which has Just
 held two weeks of talks with the CCP  Chrono, October 14), says that, al-
 though the talks were deadlocked at times and they failed to reach agree-
 ment on certain concepts and issues, such as the Chinese nuclear test,
 they did find a number of "common points" on which they could agree and
 decided to exchange missions "every other year."
 November 2:  Swedish CP Chairman Hermansson tells a press conference after
 meeting of the Executive Committee that they will change their money-losing
 central organ Ny Dag (and its Gothenburg filial Arbetar Tidningen) from a
 daily to a weekly gazette.  The money saved by this change  would be used
 to setup the party's own school for Party workers, thus ending its depend-
 ence on E. Germany and the Soviet Union for such training.
 November 3:  Tokyo Kyodo agency reports that Yoshio Shiga, who leads a
 group of other recently expelled pro-Soviet Japanese CP members, would
 leave for Moscow on the 4th for a visit of a week to 10 days at the invi-
 tation of "the director of the Marx-Lenin Research Institute."  "He re-
 portedly wants to see Soviet Government and Party leaders and seek their
 reply to a request made at the end of October by his group ... for clari-
 fication of reasons for the recent ouster of ... (10."

 November L :  Norweaian CP daily Friheten publishes a joint communique on
 an October visit of an IKP delegation to Sofia for talks with BCP leaders,
 including First Secy Zhivkov, on matters of common interest -- including
 "questions concerning the construction of socialism,... the situation in
 the ICM and the workers movement  ...."   "The two parties had a united
 viewpoint on the questions which were taken up.'?
 November 5:  French CP daily L'Humanit6 publishes under a 3-column heading
 a joint communique -on a two-week visit of a Yugoslav Party delegation for
 discussions with top FCP leaders which "underlined the necessity and re-
 ciprocal utility of developing closer collaboration between the FCP and
 the YLC, with a view to achieving better knowledge and a re-tightening of
 fraternal ties between the two parties."
 As our last period ended, delegates from 5 CP's were in Moscow for
 more explanations about Khrushchev's ouster.  The first, from the French
 CP, had talks with the top figures of the CPSU, including Brezhnev, on
 the 26th and 27th:  the Tass commiunique on the 29th, the day they departed,
 described "an atmosphere of fraternal friendship and frankness," and said
 that "the delegations exchanged views and information on questions of in-
 terest to both parties."  They "confirmed the determination of both parties"
 to pursue common policies of peaceful coexistence, etc., "and to continue
 ire arations for another international conference of the Communist and
 workers parties."  It made no mention of Ihrushchev or his ouster.
 Speaking after the delegation made its report to the FCP Central
 Committee on 6 November, SecyGen Rochet said:  "We neither approve nor
 disapprove, since the resignation came as the result of a decision by the
 CC of the CPSU."  The FCP statement published on the 8th, however, backed
 the ouster and emphasized opposition to "the leftist and nationalist line"
 of the Chinese CP leadership.  On the 9th, the Paris weekly Express pub-
 lished a purportedly accurate account of the secret conversations of the
 delegation with the CPSU leaders according to which the French were not
 satisfied with the explanations.  FCP delegate Leroy reportedly stated:
 "The 'resignation' of K. means for the FCP the immediate loss of 15 per-
 cent of its members and 20 percent of those who vote with it."  Zxpress
 said that the French asked 12 times to see K but were refused.
 The Italian CP delegation met with the top CPSU leaders on 30 and
 31 October and on 2 November.  When they departed on 3 November, the Tass
 communique' spoke of "a spirit of friendship and sincerity," said the par-
 ticipants "confirmed the full resolution of both parties" on vague policy
 statements, and avoided mention of an international conference or the
 Khrushchev ouster.  At home, however, delegation chief Berlinguer told
 newsmen on arrival that "these explanations, which certainly deserve great

 attention, did not appear to be sufficient to make us abandon the reser-
 vations expressed by our Party."  ':,uestioned as to whether he had asked
 to see K, Berlinguer replied:  "No.  It is a practice of elementary cor-
 rectness that when two delegations meet they are the delegations desig-
 nated by the two parties."  The resolution approved by the ICP on the 6th
 accepts in effect the Soviet explanation, pays restrained tribute to the
 "positive contribution" made by K to "the process of development opened up
 by the 20th Congress," and "greets with satisfaction the signs of improve-
 ment" in Sino-Soviet relations while reasserting the ICP's "reservations"
 about calling a new international conference at this time.
 Meanwhile, the fellow-travelling Paesa Sera (Rome) described on the
 30th a 29-point Soviet document of the charges against K which it said
 has been distributed to CPSU activists, while on the 31st, the ICP's
 daily L'Unita, printed in the same shop, denied the existence of a 29-
 point document, but listed 14 points of accusation which had been "reli-
 ably" reported.  Then the Italian weekly L'Espresso on 1 November pub-
 lished a "summary of Suslov's report" at the plenum ousting K reportedly
 received from E. Berlin -- which drew an official Tass denunciation of it
 on 3 Nov. as "an anti-Soviet fabrication."  And the pro-Chicom Nuova Units.
 on 5 November warned that the removal of It is only "one initial step in
 the fight against revisionism" and concluded that "the fundamental task
 facing M-Ls today is to denounce the projected world. Communist conference
 in Moscow."
 The Indian, Austrian, and Danish delegates met only with Suslov and
 Ponomarev, on 30 Oct., 31 Oct., and 1 Nov., respectively.  Of particular
 interest was the Tass coimnunique on 2 Nov. regarding the Austrian talks:
 it added that both sides "stressed the need ... to continue preparations
 for a new meeting of the Communist and workers parties and a meeting of
 the draftinj committee."  The few reports we have seen of comments by
 these delegates after returning home indicate that they have publicly ac-
 cepted and defended the CPSU action.  Danish CP Chairman Jesperson even
 added the story that K is suffering from sclerosis.
 The ruling parties of Eastern Europe seemed to have fallen in step
 with the CPSU, except for the hostile Albanians, the independent Ruman-
 ians -- and the suddenly non-conforming Czechs.  The Czechs' non-conform-
 ity is not great as yet -- on the 27th Rude Pravo published a round-up
 of demands for more info on the K ouster by the Austrian, Swiss and
 Uruguayan CPs and announced that a Czech Party delegation had gone to
 Paris to exchange views on the ICM with the FCP; Czech editorials con-
 tinue to omit the 21st Congress from those determining the Leninist line;
 and the Czech delegation to the 7 Nov. fete in Moscow was headed only by
 second-rater Hendrych rather than by Novotny (see later) -- but, together
 with recent radical domestic "liberalization" measures, it has led to
 speculation that Czechoslovakia may be the next Communist state to follow
 the Rumanians into "independence."

 The "fact-finding" delegations had barely completed their talks in
 Moscow when delegations from most parties of the world arrived for the
 traditional anniversary celebration (47th this year) of the Soviet
 "October" Revolution on 7 November.  The Chinese made world headlines
 by announcing on the 4th that Premier Chou En-lai would head a strong
 CCP delegation.  Delegations of four ruling parties were headed by their
 chiefs -- Polish, Hungarian, E. German and Mongolian.  Premier Maurer led
 the Rumanian contingent, and CC Secretary Hendrych of the Czech was the
 lowest-ranking of Soviet orbit delegates.  Yugoslavia's leading ideolo-
 gist, Vlahovic, headed his party's delegation.  The North Korean and
 North Vietnamese parties sent strong delegations, headed by a CC Vice
 Chairman and Premier, respectively.  Economic boss Guevara represented
 Cuba.  Albania was not invited.  Tight secrecy has thus fax cloaked the
 talks which the CPSU must have conducted with these delegations.  However,
 Chou, staying on after the others departed, was still there at the end of
 our period, and the press carried unconfirmed "inside" reports that the
 Chinese were pressing the Soviets to make another effort to avoid a split
 by holding a new round of bilateral talks before going ahead with plans
 for a world conference.
 Overt CPSU statements throughout this period have followed rather
 closely the 17 October Pravda editorial, i.e., commitment to the general
 line of the 20th, 21st, and 22nd Congresses, with its emphasis on peace-
 ful coexistence, support of the test-ban treaty, appeal for unity of the
 Communist world, and call for an international party conference -- with
 no mention of a specific time-table.  The Soviet refusal to make funda-
 mental concessions to the Chinese was particularly evident in the key
 speech delivered by Brezhnev in the presence of Chou and the other leaders
 of the Communist world at the Revolution anniversary, -- and a Pravda
 editorial on 10 Nov. again emphasized that "the majority" of the world's
 parties believe that the time is "ripe" for convening a world conference.
 Peking papers on 3 November devoted a full page to statements by
 various CPs and their leaders on the K ouster.  On the 6th, People's
 Dai   carried full text of the key 17 October Pravda editorial and of
 the 1 November Pravda editorial which expanded on it.
 Then on the 7th, People's Daily carried an editorial devoted to the
 anniversary, under the title "Unite Under the Banner of the Great October
 Revolution," which arrogantly made it clear that an  ra  rochement would
 have to be on China's terms.  It starts with a bow to      great Soviet
 people taught and guided by Lenin and Stalin" who, "are successors to a
 glorious revolutionary tradition, can be trusted, and will not disap-
 point ...."  It refers authoritatively to its "proposal concerning the
 general line of the ICM" (the 14 June 1963 CCP letter which drew the
 14 July 1963 CPSU "open letter" and thus played a key role in the recent
 polemical war), and reiterates emphatically its stand on the principal
 disputed issues, such as the necessity for smashing the bourgeois state

 apparatus with revolutionary violence, for persisting in the dictatorship
 of the proletariat and carrying the socialist revolution through to the
 end, etc.  Unity 'must be built entirely on the basis of independence ...
 opposition to all forms of bourgeois nationalism, and of great-nation
 chauvinism in particular."  In order to safeguard unity, "an uncompromis-
 ing struggle must be waged against all forms of opportunism which betray
 M-L, especially modern revisionism which is the main danger to the ICM
 today.
 PD then gloats over its new victory:
 "The course of development of the ICM in recent years has amply
 roved the great historic significance of persevering in the struggle
 against revisionism.
 "Khrushchev is the chief representative of modern revisionism.
 He has betrayed Leninism, betrayed proletarian internationalism,
 betrayed the path of the October Revolution, and betrayed the in-
 terests of the Soviet people.  The Soviet people and the CPSU [note
 that "the people" come first] recently removed K from the leading
 posts he held in the party and state.  This is a very good thing,
 and it has the support of M-Ls and revolutionary people of all the
 world.....
 "The Chinese People, taught and guided by the CCP and Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung, have always had the deepest respect for and confidence
 in the long-tested Soviet people....  Through no fault of ours, nor
 of the Soviet peoples, relations between the Chinese and Soviet par-
 ties and the two countries have met with difficulties and suffered
 impairment in the past period....  We are convinced that the diffi-
 culties... are, after all, only a historical episode and can be
 gradually resolved...."
 (N.B.:  Chou also visited Stalin's grave in Moscow.)
 The Albanians., ans, as so often formerly, led the May in attacking the
 CPSU. On 1 November, Zeri I Po   -lit featured an editorial "The Fall of
 Khrushchev Did Not Entail the Disappearance of Khrushchevian Revisionism."
 It begins:
 "The inglorious end of N. Khrushchev is the result of the in-
 transigent-and principled combat waged by all M-Ls who courageously
 struggled against modern revisionism [MR]....  It is a great victory
 of M-L over MR.
 "All M-Ls and all revolutionaries regard K's ousting ... as the
 failure of the political and ideolo ical course of MR, as formulated
 by the 20th and 22nd Congresses....

 After a detailed denunciation of K's betrayals, ZIP asserts:
 "The political liquidation of N. Khruahrhev, although he was the
 head of modern rev1e onism, does not mse*n liquidation of his ideological,
 ececonomic, and organizational   lticaleline, ?which cause so much harm
 the USSR, M-L  the             amp (etc.)....      expulsion... has
 not entailed the death of Khrushchevian_revisionism:  it has not liqui-
 dated his ideology and policy, expressed in the line of the 20th CPSU
 Congress...."
 ZIP went even further in its editorial on the   Nov. anniversary.  In
 this, the villain is  N. Khrushchev and his group," who 'applied themselves
 to denigrating the Soviet Union, to weakening it, to liquidating the victo-
 ries of Great October, and to bringing back capitalism."  K's ouster is
 "the result of the firm strug  a of the G P  the Albanian Workers Party,
 and other parties which adhere to the positions of M-L and all revolutionary
 Communists.  This is the result of the unmasking of Khrushchevite revision-
 ists and the result of their profound crisis.  This proves once again that
 he who raises his hand against M-L will be eliminated as a traitor."
 "But the liquidation of N. Khrushchev d9es not mark the definite
 end of revisionism....  The M-LB will continue their high-principled
 str   to against Khrushchevite revisionists and a a inst the perfidious
 line of the 20th and 22nd Congresses until the complete defeat of the
 revisionists and until the liquidation of the deformations made in
 M-L.  Many steps must be made in this direction.  And one of them,
 incontestably the most important, is to put back in its place the per-
 son and work of J. V. Stalin and to reject the calumnies of K. revi-
 sionists against J. V. Stalin....
 The pro-Chinese splinter groups in various countries have also carried
 on bitter polemics against their pro-Soviet rivals.  The 1 November issue
 of Rote Fahne, organ of the Chinese wing of the Austrian Communists, blasted
 the local Party leadership for its protests against the manner of K's ouster
 and charged that "They do not speak from any democratic and humanistic con-
 science, but from shaking fear that the ousting of the chief revisionist,
 K, in the Soviet Union could also lead to the fall of his most compromised
 instruments in Austria."
 "They are those who did not find the smallest blemish when K on
 his way to power, did not hesitate to execute a whole series of people
 surrounding Stalin or to have them shot to death without any trial.
 Has anybod  ever demanded an explanation of the shooting of Beriya, or
 the execution of Abakumov, Poskrebyshev, Bagirov, Rummin, and other
 functionaries?  These executions were carried out on the basis of evi-
 dence which the public still does not know tod      ."

 Communists to  the influence of the Togi1atti.n morn'1um."
 The 6 November issue of La Voix du Peuple, weekly organ of the Belgian
 pro-Chinese "party," also redoubled its attacks against the "Khrushchevian
 traitors" leading the local official party and devoted a whole page to a
 glorification of. Stalin.  Interestingly, La Voix has not once mentioned the
 names of Brezhnev, Kosygin, or any other leading CPSU figures.  (Meanwhile,
 Drapeau Roue, organ of the official Belgian CP, has gone so far as to advise
 the Belgian fiscal authorities to investigate the sources of income of the
 Grippa-led pro-Chinese group, saying that Grippa would have wound up in
 prison for debt long ago if he had had to pay for his propaganda out of rev-
 enues in Belgium.)

 849.                       STATE OF TL  SPACE RACE
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  On 12 October, the Soviets launched the Voskhod (Sunrise)
 space capsule with three men aboard, including a doctor (Boris Yegorov) and
 a scientist (Konstantin Feoktistov) as well as the pilot, Col. Vladimir
 Komarov.  The space capsule was in the air for 24 hours and made 16 loops
 around the earth before landing.  Much was made of the claim that the as-
 tronauts did not wear special space suits and that they moved freely about
 the capsule while in orbit:   this suggested that the capsule was very
 spacious, even though three persons were in it.  This was the first time
 that either the Soviets or the US had sent more than one person into space
 in one spaceship.  Such a ship could be used as part of an orbiting space
 station, and might in future flights make rendezvous with other capsules.
 Whatever the scientific implications, the propaganda gain for the
 Soviets was considerable.  Their last manned space exploit had occurred
 over a year before in June 1963 (twin flights of V. F. Bykovskiy and V.V.
 Tereshkova, the latter the first woman In space), and even Sir Bernard
 Lovell, usually prone to praise Soviet achievements, had published an
 article (New Scientist, 9 July 1964; Press Comment,, 3 August he stated that  there seems little doubt that the Russians are~fasstxlosingh
 ground to the Americans."  The world had become aware that the Soviets had
 suffered failures in space shots to Mars, Venus, and the Moon, since Octo-
 ber 1960, and that the US was building and successfully testing the Saturn
 rocket system, much larger than anything the Soviets possessed.  Now, how-
 ever, the Soviets have leapfrogged the American space program,                         Due to
 slippage, the US is not now expected to orbit a two-man (Gemini) capsule
 until February 1965, and a three man (Apollo) vehicle will probably not
 take off from Cape Kennedy until 1967,  As the Gemini shots take place,
 they will be compared unfavorably with Voskhod, so that the Soviets may
 gain more glory from these forthcoming US events than the US will,  NASA
 plans that, during the second Gemini flight, the astronauts will rise in
 their seats and open a spaceship hatch; here again the Soviets will have
 forestalled and excelled the US, at least in regard to free movement.
 It was at least fortunate for the US that Voskhod itself was pushed
 off the front pages by the overthrow of Khrushchev, the first Chicom nu-
 clear detonation, and the British election.  Many noticed that while Khru-
 shchev had wished the astronauts a safe return, it was he who needed good
 wishes, and who failed to appear at the Kremlin reception.  Some observers
 pointed out that although an initial announcement indicated that there
 would be a "prolonged flight," and although the crew asked permission to
 stay aloft, the capsule was returned to earth after the shortest Soviet
 flight since Gagarinfs; this suggested that something may have gone wrong
 (Economist, 17 October 1964; Press Comment, 20 October'1964).

 Unfortunately--and this time unnecessarily--much of the world press was
 taken in by Soviet language implying that a new, much stronger rocket was
 used, and some publications even concluded that the Soviets had something
 bigger than the US Saturn I, which used 1.5 million lbs. of thrust to orbit
 36,700 lbs. on 18 September 1964.  On 21 October, Soviet scientist M. V.
 Keldysh stated at a news conference that the Voskhod rocket had developed
 more thrust than "any other rocket in the world that had so far orbited pay-
 loads, instrument packages, or people."  By qualifying "any other rocket in
 the world" in this way, Keldysh in effect admitted that the Soviet rocket was
 less powerful than Saturn:  so far, Saturn has only orbited test loads of bal-
 last ("boilerplate").  As might have been expected, Pravda and Moscow News
 omitted the qualifying clause when quoting Keldysh.  More surprisingly, the
 New York Times and the Baltimore Sun, while ultimately giving the full state-
 ment, did not realize the meaning of the qualification, and in their lead
 paragraphs they simply said that Keldysh claimed the mightiest rocket on
 earth.  Aviation Week and Space Technology (26 October) repeated the  most
 powerful' claim without any qualification, and European newspapers 'IikeVise
 hailed Soviet primacy in rocket power.
 The Washington Post (13 and 14 October 1964; Press Comment, 13 and 21
 October 1964) quoted US officials as stating that the Soviets mated the upper
 stage from their planetary exploration program to "the old, tried and true
 first-stage Vostok booster."  (FYI only:  Classified analysis shows that the
 basic Voskhod booster was an SS-6, which has been used in all major Soviet
 space launches; for an upper stage, a Venik space rocket was employed, re-
 placing the less powerful Lunik upper stage which had orbited previous manned
 capsules.  The SS-6/Venik combination had been tested in the launching of four
 recoverable photographic satellites.  The Voskhod capsule weighed about 14,000
 lbs., as opposed to 10,1+00 for the earlier Soviet manned shots.  End FYI.)
 The Post also reported that these US officials maintain that the Soviets can-
 not take men to the moon without something near the size of the monstrous
 7.5 million lb. thrust of the Saturn V rockets, which will send Americans
 to the moon, and which are now In production.  The Soviets have given no
 overt sign of building a big new booster, which would be very costly in terms
 of valuable resources, and for which there is no military necessity.  Very
 likely, Khrushchev disregarded the long-term need for a bigger booster and
 pushed for an immediate propaganda triumph now, just as he ordered the Virgin
 Lands and fallow fields plowed up in an attempt to gain a short-term agri-
 cultural surplus.  The full publicity which attends the US space program
 doubtless made it easy to calculate just what would be needed to take the
 luster off the next three years of that program.
 The policy of the new Soviet leaders may differ from Khrushchev's.  K.
 always hoped to overawe the world with space exploits, including their im-
 plication of an ICBM capability.  Between Sputnik I (1957) and the Cuban
 missile crisis (1962) he seems to have thought that he could pull off a
 tremendous bluff, using space exploits and rocket-rattling to frighten the
 West into a surrender.  This no longer appears possible today, and the new
 leaders may not see much point in pouring further resources in trained men
 and advanced equipment into the space program.  But even if they do not
 build new rockets and space capsules, there are probably items of equipment,
 already finished, which they can use for a time for propaganda purposes.
 We may expect further Voskhod-type flights, probably lasting for longer
 perind.s

 851 WH,f.         UNIVERSITY REFORM IN LATIN AMERICA
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  In Latin America, the concept "university reform" is at
 once an academic and administrative program, a political slogan, and a
 vehicle for Communist penetration of the universities and control of all
 important phases of higher education.  For the students, it is also a
 "mystique," with such vague and emotion-packed overtones that its devotees
 do not respond to rational appeals on the subject.
 The concept of university reform was first articulated in April 1918
 at the University of Cordoba by a congress of the newly founded Federacion
 Universitaria Argentina.  This congress was composed of two delegates from
 each of the five then existing universities in Argentina and is generally
 regarded as the first National Student Congress.  In essence, it was
 called in rebellion against the apathy and corruption into which the Ar-
 gentine university system had fallen during the successive dictatorships
 and liberal regimes of the republic.
 Ten "statutes" were adopted by the congress, the first two of which
 have had far-reaching and revolutionary effect:  co-gobierno, or student
 participation in the management of the affairs of the university, and
 university autonomy.  The first statute specified that a university should
 be governed, not by political appointees and a self-perpetuating staff,
 but by those most concerned with it: the professors, the students, and the
 graduates, in equal proportions.  The sense of the term university auton-
 omy, especially as it has been interpreted later, was that the only role
 of the national government should be that of providing the necessary op-
 erating funds.  For all other activities -- the appointment of a rector
 (president), the general orientation of the curriculum, the hiring, firing,
 and promotion of teachers, the management of funds, discipline on the cam-
 pus, etc. -- the university itself would be solely responsible.  Other
 statutes called for optional attendance on classes, doing away with aca-
 demic tenure for professors, social (read financial) assistance to the
 students, and the orientation of the university toward the social problems
 that face the nation.
 Latin American universities are patterned after the University of
 Salamanca, which was an autonomous institution insofar as the relations be-
 tween Church, state, and clergy allowed in the Middle Ages.  But the big
 difference between then and now is that the monks and lesser clerics (most
 students were then considered lay clerics) who ran things wer  impervious
 to the penetration of subversive ideas emanating, for example, from the
 Muslim pagans in Southern Spain.  The early colonial universities, those

 of Peru ab1 Mexico, both founded a century before Harvard, were substan-
 tially democratic organisms, and the students, according to chroniclers
 of university reform, had the right to elect their own teachers.  The. new
 university, envisaged by the reform, was to be anti-clerical and adopt a
 policy of laicismo, or secularism, not only for government-supported uni-
 versities, but for education in general, which would come ultimately to
 include Catholic universities and other Church-supported institutions in
 Latin America.
 Since the Cordoba congress of 1918, university reform has suffered
 the ups and downs of many other liberal, leftist, and somewhat anti-
 clerical movements:  it has generally thrived under liberal regimes, only
 to be suppressed under dictatorships.  At the present time it has spread
 to practically every secular institution of higher learning in Latin Amer-
 ica, either as accepted practice or as a goal to be reached.  From the be-
 ginning, proponents of university reform have had a popular cause.  No one
 will dispute that the old universities needed reforming, and there is ev-
 ery reason to assume that there was then just as much inefficiency and
 corruption in managing a university as in handling affairs of state.  Un-
 fortunately, however, while university reform has undoubtedly eliminated
 many old abuses, it has created new ones, some of a purely academic or
 administrative nature, and others that constitute a potential danger in
 the context of the free world struggle against Communism.
 The fundamental fallacy of university reform, or rather of its two
 major postulates -- autonomy.khdco-government -- is the assumption that,
 just because a nation has adopted a democratic form of government, re-
 sponsive to the will of the majority, one of its components might func-
 tion under the same system.  If one argues with a Latin American student
 that a warship at sea, a government bureau, or an industrial corporation
 are managed autocratically within the framework of a greater democracy,
 he will be likely to reply that the university is a sort of cosmos in
 itself, or a little world of its own that represents society-as a whole
 and that the elite corps which composes it is alone qualified to run it.
 Another fallacy is the assumption that young people are actuated by
 purer motives than older people.  The Cordoba manifesto even asserts that
 youth ... "is disinterested, it is pure.  It has not had time to contami-
 nate itself.  It can never be mistaken in the election of its own educa-
 tors."  Vis-a-vis the rest of the population, students have managed to
 put themselves on the side of the angels.  From arrogating to themselves
 something of a monopoly of high ideals, it is not a very big jump for the
 students to assume that superior judgment goes hand-in-hand with their
 asserted incorruptibility.  As a matter of fact, many Latin American stu-
 dentleaders -- and their followers -- appear to believe sincerely that
 they are possessed of both.
 It is the opinion of impartial observers that the basic postulates
 of university reform are wrong in both theory and practice.  By voting
 themselves voluntary attendance onlolasses, the students have de-empha-
 sized the spontaneity of classroom'discussions and thereby avoided the

 healthy discipline of day-to-day preparation.  By outlawing entrance ex-
 aminations, they have contributed to overcrowding the universities with
 unprepared students.  By eliminating such tedious exercises as term papers
 and insisting on easy, oral examinations, they have reduced the standards
 of scholarly achievement.  Professor K. H. Silvert, after lecturing two
 years in the University of Buenos Aires and the University of Chile at
 Santiago, answered a claim by an American colleague to the effect that the
 Argentine university system was without peer in the rest of Latin America
 in these words:  "I am not competent to say whether the Argentine univers-
 ity system was or was not the best in Latin America [from 1918 to the ac-
 cession of Peron], although certainly the Chileans would dispute the claim.
 In any event, this purely comparative statement does not tell us whether
 the university was good or bad.  It is my opinion that the University of
 Buenos Aires never was truly a good institution of higher learning."  The
 whole sense of Professor Silvert's report, published by the American Uni-
 versities Field Staff, is that the University of Buenos Aires, although
 the largest and probably the best in Latin America, has standards of schol-
 arship and accomplishment far below those of a mediocre U. S. university.
 "The situation," he said, "is tragic."
 Of all the changes brought about by university reform in Latin Amer-
 ica, perhaps the most harmful has been the so-called c6tedra libre, usu-
 ally translated as "free teaching,'.' but actually a euphemism for the abo-
 lition of life tenure for professors.  Like other elements of the reform,
 it was intended to do away with an inveterate abuse:  the continuance in
 teaching positions of incompetent teachers.  Under the new system, pro-
 fessors are subject to periodic examinations and may be removed from
 their posts, promoted or reduced by decision of the Consejo Universitario
 (University Council), composed of teachers, students, and graduates in
 equal proportions.  In actual practice, cf,tedra libre has become a device
 by which students, through their delegates on the council,-can maintain
 constant pressure on their teachers, even to the point of blackmail.  A
 teacher who does not conduct his classes according to the whim of the stu-
 dents, or who does not conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, may not be
 promoted or may be discharged.
 On the campuses of many Latin American universities, the Communists
 occupy the controlling elective offices in the student organizations.  In
 all of them, except certain private, Catholic institutions, they are a
 dynamic, influential element, prepared to assume control at any time.
 Since university reform was, from its inception, a leftist and anti-cler-
 ical movement, it was not only natural, but has been easy, for the Com-
 munists to seize control of it and use it to"their own ends.
 Therefore, student participation in university administration has not
 only prevented Latin American universities from keeping pace with their
 U. S. and European counterparts in purely academic matters, it has also
 opened the door for Communist penetration and control of the whole univers-
 ity system.  Communist influence, exerted primarily at the university level,
 is little by little being exerted, through the new generations of teachers,
 in the primary and secondary levels of education as well.  It is safe to

 with their minds already well filled with the usual Communist cliches,
 and a fanatical minority are prepared to engage in active struggle as
 militant Communists.

 [owned by Italian C.P.1
 The So vi?ct CoTmwnist Party is beCinning to reply to the innun,ra'ule
 questions brought up by the more vigilant and attentive public opinion of
 the country.  There is beginning a heavy job of orientation among the masses
 to parry certain dangers that could occur after the resignation of Khrush-
 chev:  the danger of a weakening of the impetus of youth, of the initiation
 of a certain lack of political direction, and a certain ideological fatigue
 among the intellectuals and vast strata of workers.  The Soviet Coiiuuuzist
 Party is beginning to reply, and it is doing it in a comprehensive manner,
 circulating its orientations in all places of work, in party buildings, and
 in the 300,000 so-called primary organizations (cells), so that its indi-
 cations can reach out everywhere to all the members of the immense army of
 11 and a half million Soviet communists and, through them, to all the pop-
 ulation.
 The ideological section of the central party apparatus has been issuing
 certain explanatory documents during the past few days to all the peripheral
 party bodies.  These documents are like instructions for the use of acti-
 vists, containing a series of indications which speakers at all factory and
 cell meetings use as an aid to face the difficult and embarrassing topic of
 the fall of Khrushchev.
 These documents are of different types and sorts according to the cate-
 gory of citizens to which they are addressed.  Their circulation is strictly
 internal, and they are not for publication  in newspapers.
 However, because of their widespread circulation -- there is talk of
 a circulation of 750,000 copies -- we were able today to learn with suffi-
 cient exactitude, on the basis of careful summaries, the contents of two of
 these instructions:  one for local propagandists of Komsomol in student
 circles, and the other for party activists at the meetings that are in
 progress these days for the election of officers in rank-and-file bodies.
 Both contained a quantity of material to be used to answer questions that
 Soviet public opinion is asking about the silent cataclysm of October 13
 and 14.  The fundamental part of these texts records the criticism made
 against the ex-Premier, listed in 29-points.  The charges are grouped in a
 pamphlet for Komeoma1  propagandists.  Komsomol is the communist youth or-
 ganization of the Soviet Union.   These pamphlets serve to provide a unified
 and comprehensive reply to the question of why Khrushchev was deposed.
 The (Italian) public already knows about a good many of these charges,
 since we repeatedly published some of them during the first days after the
 overthrow of the Premier.  But there are about a dozen which are completely
 unpublished, and for the first time a confidential publication of the party
 groups all of them together in a comprehensive manner.  They are grouped in

 four large parts:  Domestic Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Communist Movement,
 and Personal Behavior of Khrushchev.  Here is a list of the points in order,
 which was given to us by an excellent source, and added to them in some
 cases are the specific arguments suggested to the activists to better ex-
 plain every single point.
 Domestic Affairs.
 1.  Errors and profound contradictions in agricultural management.
 In 1957 Khrrushchev fought, against Molotov, for an extensive agriculture,
 for the initiation of cultivation of the virgin lands.  But in February
 1961+, also following  the disastrous harm done by erosion in those areas
 that had just been put to the plow, he was forced to call for intensive
 farming and suspend efforts in the virgin lands.  In March 1962 he carried
 on an all-out campaign against the system of rotation of forage crops and
 sustained the necessity to grow maize instead of grasses.  But in May 1961
 he was forced  to admit that not always and not everywhere -- for example,
 in the Baltic countries -- is it advantageous to grow maize instead of grass.
 2.  Administrative and organizational confusion.  In 1956 he fought
 against Molotov, originator of a wide-scale administrative centralization
 (plan), and came out in favor of de-centralization.  But recently -- only
 a few months ago -- he returned to positions that are identical to those
 of Molotov.  In November 1962 he launched a wide-scale general reorganiza-
 tion of the forty-seven regional economies of the Soviet Union, widening
 their scope and reducing their number to seventeen.  In this way, there
 were created entangled relations between one area and another which led to
 conflicts of competence in the true sense of the word.  Typical among these
 was a long controversy between the Bratsk region and the Irkutsk region,
 following the new reorganization, which led to delays in building roads and
 other public works.
 3.  Errors in planning.  He presented to the plenum, and had it ap-
 proved unanimously, a complex project that placed the planning organization,
 Gosplan, under the jurisdiction of a super-planning body, the Supreme Coun-
 cil of the Economy.             But confusion increased, as Khrushchev himself admitted
 in December 1963 (Plenum on Big Chemistry).
 1+. Incorrect policy on light industry.  For the past few years,
 Khrushchev had insisted on an excessive increase in allocations to produce
 consumer goods and to make the business structure smoother, putting into
 effect in September 1961+ certain changes that upset the work of technical
 experts and economists.
 5.  Underestimation of the role of heavy industry.  The allocations in
 this sector are not, in proportion, satisfactory and adequate in terms of
 the directives for the development of the Soviet Union as a world power of
 the very first water.  Grave defects occurred -- because of deficiencies
 attributed to Khrushchev directives -- in the production of sheet steel,
 to such an extent that it was necessary to import it from Italy and Germany.

 Isufficient pace characterizes the replacement of old machinery.  Certain
 errors were committed following the discovery of extremely rich deposits
 of ferrous material near Kursk, because of the misplacement of the new steel
 factories destined to process the ore, and because of the failure to oper-
 ate with technical methods adequate for the exceptional quality of the new
 deposits that were discovered.
 6.  Tax pressure.  In 1960 there was an announcement of an imminent re-
 duction of taxes.  But these reductions were postponed indefinitely because
 of intricate technico-financial reasons.
 7.  Mistaken building policy.  At the end of the preceding state eco-
 nomic plan (1958) he was vividly in opposition to the designers and tech-
 nicians of the so-called reconstruction plan of Moscow.  He declared him-
 self to be strongly against the large low-cost buildings of nine, fourteen
 and twenty stories suggested by the planners for reasons of economy, and
 adopts on a very large scale the small building policy -- housing unit of
 five or six stories at most.
 But later -- in the spring of 1963 -- he returned to the previously
 contested concept of the gigantic buildings, involving edifices of twenty-
 two stories in the central Moscow zones of Arbad and Sokol.
 8.  Mistaken city planning policy.  He fought against the projects of
 the city planners who want to avoid in Moscow oil-slick expansion by creat-
 ing sputnik cities or directional residential centers in the extreme periph-
 ery.                   But he wound up by accepting their idea.  He fought against the con-
 cept of the foot-bridge of the American type, demanding instead underground
 passages (which, it must be said, are technically more familiar to the So-
 viets, because of the brilliant experience of the subway of Moscow, Lenin-
 grad and Kicurt.
 9.  Inopportune and heavy-handed intervention into cultural matters.
 e famous speeches of Khrushchev of December 1962 and March 1963 in re-
 ard to socialist realism which has thus lost part of what little prestige
 t once had.
 10.  Untimely literary intervention in the question of Sivan Denis-
 ovic.                    In November 1962 the literary review Novy Mir, which for months
 ad been fighting for the publication of the novel, A Day in the Life of
 lexandr Solzhenitzvn (a. work based on " e theme of the terrible life in
 he Stalinist concentration camps), received unhoped for help:  it was
 Pumshchev in person who asked for the publication of that work.  This
 ntervention is today reproved because Solzheniczynts novel brought to light
 an ugly past.  According to today's accusors, it should have been ignored
 and, above all, been made to be ignored.

 Foreign Affairs:
 11.  Decline in prestige of the foreign ministry:  Khrushchev, with
 his policy of personal contacts, many times crudely went over the head of
 the ministerial organs of government, without even informing them of what
 he was doing, and reduced the complex, efficient, and well organized diplo-
 matic network of the USSR to a simple information service, from which he
 acquired this or that notion that was useful to him at a given moment.
 12.  Doubtful result of the trip made in June of this year to the
 Scandinavian countries.  A political result was awaited, whereas it pro-
 duced only an economical result of reduced proportions (ship orders, pur-
 chase of heads of cattle, etc.).
 13.  Danger of worsening relations with the Scandinavian countries.
 It was caused by some arguments, if only of a friendly nature, between the
 Soviet leader and the Swedish Premier Tage Erlander in regard to the asylum
 given by Sweden to the Ukranian emigrant Stechko and to Swedish aggression
 in the Ukrania, at the time of Charles XII.
 14.  Contradictory and only slightly firm attitude during the crisis
 of Cuba (October 1962).  At first he publicly declared that there are no
 Soviet missiles in Cuba.  Then he admitted their presence on the island.
 The result was that he had to retreat before the overbearing and illegal
 attitude of the United States, which loosed a sea blockade.
 15.  Dangerous thoughtlessness during the Suez crisis (October 1956).
 With his threatening, and fortunately very effective, ultimatum, Khrushchev
 involved the Soviet armed forces in the possibility of intervention, thus
 carrying the country to the brink of war without having consulted with
 sufficient clarity the high leadership  bodies of the USSR.
 16.  Dark clouds over the relations with the member countries of the
 Comecon. Khrushchev rejected the five-year Soviet Plan, 1966-1970, which
 was the first one drawn up in collaboration with the countries of eastern
 Europe and which also took into account the interests of these countries.
 17.  Worsening in relations with Rumania.  In talks with the Rumanian
 leaders in the past years, Khrushchev insisted on their abandoning some
 branches of industrial production (above all, metalmechanics), seeking to
 induce them to augment the production of vegetables and fruit, so as to
 have Rumania limit her role to simply that of vegetable-grower for the Comecor
 18.  "Druzhba" oil pipe line.  He had the project for the Druzhba oil
 pipeline carried out and left aside Rumania, thus depriving this country as
 a market outlet for her petroleum.

 Communist Movement.
 19.  Internal disorganization of the Soviet Communist Party.  Khrush-
 chev imposed in November 1962 a radical reform of the internal structure
 of the party, which completely suppressed the District Committees (Raykom),
 depriving automatically of authority a few thousand local leaders and re-
 placing their jobs with a two fold organization (Directorate of Production
 for Industry and Directorate of Production for Agriculture).  Consequent
 to this there was an extremely wide scale organizational bogging down and
 decay.
 20.  Style of operation in the ideological dispute.  The leader gave
 in more than once to the temptation to descend to the level of personal,
 episodic battle, far from the elevated terms of  the political ideological
 dispute.
 21.  Errors in the conduct of the anti-Chinese polemics.  The policy
 of the First Secretary led the Soviet Communist Party almost to the entrance
 of a dead-end street, committing the prestige of the Soviet Communist Party
 in the preparation of a conference that is opposed not only by the Chinese,
 but also various western communist parties.
 22.  Personal behavior.  Nepotism.  The already known incidents
 (Adzhubei, Director of Iszvestia,.  Nina Petrovna, head of a cultural
 association,. Rada Khrushcheova Adzhubei, assistant editor of a magazine.,
 Sergei Khrushchev, head of an important bureau) are supplemented by Khrush-
 chev's attempt to have Adzhubei made a member of the Central Committee and
 the Secretariat.
 23.  Edginess, intractableness, in personal relations.  Recently,
 perhaps because of his advanced age, Khrushchev has had clashes with his
 closest collaborators.
 24.  Steps taken without consulting the plenum of the Central Commit-
 tee.                   An example is entrusting Adzhubei, who had been invited to West Ger-
 many by a group of six German newspapers, with a special diplomatic mission.
 Another example, retained inopportune, was the awarding to Egyptian Presi-
 dent Nasser of the title, "Hero of the Soviet Union."
 25.  Acceptance of forms of the personality cult with himself as
 object of the cult.  The case history presents very frequent and rich ma-
 terial in this regard.
 26.  Question of form and attitudes that endanger the decorum and
 prestige of a leader of the Soviet Union.  The shoe beaten on the desk at
 the United Nations, and certain crude, peasant-like expressions both at
 meetings with representatives of various communist parties and in public
 (one can recall the famous speech to the peasants of central Russia devoured
 by bedbugs "no less avid than the Ukrainian bedbugs").  Another example:
 the plate of goulash in his speech to the Hungarian workers, in April of
 this year, at Budapest.

 27.  Uncontrolled outbursts which endangered and aggravated relations
 with brother parties.  At the reception at Dom Priomov in honor of the
 Chinese delegation, in July 1963, Khrushchev allowed himself to be carried
 away by anger and insulted the head of the delegation, Teng Shao-ping and
 his co-workers, Pen-cen and Wu Hsiu-chaun.  He said to them that they were
 the bearers of the "policy of madmen."
 28.  Declarations made in public with a thoughtlessness such as to
 give rise to long and violent anti-Soviet press campaigns.  One of the most
 frequent examples of phrases on his lips was the one, addressed to the cap-
 italists, "We will bury you."
 29.  Rashness in decisions.  An example is when he spoke to the Japa-
 nese members of parliament of the Soviet "super weapon," about which he was
 later forced to make contradictory and embarrassing corrections.

 Excerpts from
 Algemeen Handelsblad

 Nibelungen in Paris
 "Everything suggests that de Gaulle is disappointed with results of
 his striving for 'independence from America.'  In fact he has had little
 success.  His proposal for a NATO triumvirate was not accepted.  The French-
 German treaty has become a scrap of paper and does not prevent Bonn from
 binding itself via the MGF still closer to Washington.  French recognition
 of Communist China has annoyed the U.S. but produced no other results.
 De Gaulle's Latin American tour aroused popular enthusiasm., but the gov-
 ernments know well that France has much less to offer than the U.S. and
 West Germany does not intend to help the French take pot shots at the U.S.
 The only 'success' of de Gaulle's self-willed posture is that the new
 Russian leaders are playing up to him.  He nevertheless threatens to car-
 ry arbitrary actions so far as to let the EEC and NATO break up.
 "De Gaulle's threats are unfortunately reminiscent of Nibelungen.  If
 the hero loses, he wants to drag everyone else with him in his downfall.
 Is this a reason to let him succeed?  By no means.
 "First, other European nations can manage better without France than
 France can without Europe.  If angry Paris should walk out of EEC or NATO
 it would be an important development but would not prevent these organiz-
 ations from continuing their activities while keeping the door open for
 France after it regains its senses.
 "Second, the French are supposed to be a logical people and the
 Nibelungen sort of heroism will not fascinate them long.  The General him-
 self has demonstrated that he can face setbacks with stoicism, but should
 he this time prove wrong, the voters will intervene.
 "Finally, it is clear that the majority of Europeans do not support
 de Gaulle's policy and prefer partnership with the U.S. as envisaged in
 Kennedy's grand design.  Should the majority let itself be blackmailed by
 the minority, even if the leader of the minority threatens with political
 suicide?  We believe the majority has the right and the duty to stick to
 its guns. It is the thankless task of the Netherlands to stress this con-
 stantly."
