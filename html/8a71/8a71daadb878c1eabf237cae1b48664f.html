 SEMIANNUAL REVIEW OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
 An Assessment of
 National Foreign Intelligence
 Production
 Volume II
 Volume II of the Semiannual Review of Intelligence, An Assessment of
 Foreign Intelligence Production, provides supplementary data on the findings
 of the IC Staff concerning the timeliness and quality of intelligence pertaining
 to those areas and topics specifically examined in this initial Semiannual
 Review. The findings are based primarily on the views of policy officials and
 staff officers expressed in over 100 interviews conducted in September and
 October, 1976. The scope and emphasis developed in these annexes varies
 because of time limitation and the availability of interviewees.

 ANNEX A
 THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE
 Intelligence Resources and Products
 More intelligence resources are allocated to the
 USSR than to any other single country or group
 of non-Communist foreign countries. This situa-
 tion has not changed significantly in the past 30
 years. In addition to the substantial proportion of
 total resources devoted to collection and process-
 ing (especially imagery and SIGINT), the pro-
 duction effort concerned primarily or exclusively
 with the USSR dominates the activities of
 virtually all components of the Community.
 The broad subject area that receives most
 attention is Soviet and Warsaw Pact military
 capabilities, including matters directly related
 thereto  such  as  intelligence  support  for
 SALT/MBFR and military-economic and S&T
 analyses. The IC current intelligence effort
 emphasizes the impact of external events on US
 foreign policy concerns of the moment, with
 Soviet behavior receiving much greater attention
 than the activities of other nations. Significant
 resources are devoted to current reporting on
 political, ideological, economic, and non-military
 technological developments involving the USSR.
 Relatively little attention is paid to non-military
 aspects of East European nations.
 Users have a general appreciation of the
 characteristic emphasis on Soviet matters in the
 total US intelligence effort, even though they
 may not be familiar with the size and distribu-
 tion (by agency, topic, function) of the resources
 covered by the NFIP budget. Although some
 users believe that more attention should be given
 to other geographic areas and/or topics, they do
 not fundamentally object to the priority accorded
 to Soviet affairs in allocating intelligence r-
 -sources.
 In considering the quality and timeliness of
 intelligence on Soviet and East European mat-
 ters, two factors should be noted at the outset.
 First, NFIB agencies have acquired a substantial
 amount of knowledge about the USSR in the past
 quarter century. Policymakers can draw upon a
 relatively rich storehouse of information and
 expect the Intelligence Community to produce
 generally credible estimates and penetrating
 analyses. However, user needs have become more
 difficult for producers to meet, chiefly because of
 the increasing number and complexity of user
 demands on intelligence. The appetite for better
 intelligence is insatiable,  the limitations of
 intelligence are not fully or widely appreciated,
 and the intelligence producer's wares are often
 regarded as "free goods"-indeed, analysts are
 not only expected to satisfy users' requirements
 promptly, but also to anticipate future needs
 which policyrnakers themselves do not clearly
 foresee.
 The second factor is that US capabilities for
 producing intelligence in depth on most aspects
 of the Soviet and East European economies are
 now largely concentrated in CIA, notably OER
 and OSR. Other NFIB agencies (viz. State/INR,
 DIA, and Treasury) and such departments as
 Commerce and Agriculture have very limited
 analytical capabilities in this field. Users are less
 dependent upon CIA for intelligence on Soviet
 S&T. Although CIA's Offices of Scientific Intelli-

 gence (OSI) and Weapons Intelligence (OWI)
 have substantial capabilities, DIA and the
 military services devote considerable effort to
 intelligence on technology of potential military
 significance, and ERDA plays an important role
 in assessing Soviet atomic energy activities. For
 obvious reasons, the bulk of intelligence resources
 available for analyzing Soviet and East European
 military capabilities and politico-military topics
 is in DOD and CIA.
 Soviet and East European Economy,
 Technology and Politics
 Current Intelligence Support
 Most consumers rely heavily on daily cable
 traffic, the press, and on CIA (DDO) and NSA
 reports as the principal sources of their current
 intelligence. Publications like the National Intel-
 ligence Daily (NID) serve as another valuable
 source of information. Timely classified accounts
 of current developments are useful to policy-
 makers as aids in keeping up-to-date on events
 abroad, whether or not the same events are
 reported in the public media; but the value of
 this kind of intelligence depends upon the extent
 to which the information supplements what is
 already known from other sources or corrects
 reporting by news services.  Frequently users
 complain about the lack of follow-up after an
 item is no longer in the headlines. This criticism
 may reflect, in part, unfamiliarity with other
 intelligence publications (e.g., weeklies) which
 are more appropriate vehicles for presenting
 analyses of current events in a broader perspec-
 tive; however, it may also reflect deficiencies in
 IC performance-undue emphasis on reporting
 new events, insufficient attention to trends and
 implications, or failure to produce enough
 follow-up reports to satisfy the interests of diverse
 consumers.
 More specialized periodicals (e.g., Economic
 Intelligence Weekly, International Oil Develop-
 ments, Weekly Surveyor) are widely circulated
 among users concerned with Soviet and East
 European affairs Users seem to be satisfied with
 them. Such products help to bridge the gap
 between cable-gisting, NID reporting, and'daily
 oral briefings on the one hand, and in-depth
 analyses and comprehensive studies on the other.
 In general, users are not dissatisfied with the
 timeliness and quality of current intelligence as
 such, but they want something more than
 accurate and perceptive reporting. There is a
 particularly strong user plea, for example, for
 more in-depth, integrated politico-economic re-
 porting on internal East European matters. The
 underlying problem for every NFIP agency, as
 well as for the intelligence Community as a
 whole, is how to provide users with both good
 current intelligence and the ad hoc support,
 policy-oriented research, credible estimates, fac-
 tual compendia, and imaginative analyses that
 users also want. There is probably no satisfactory
 solution to this perennial problem as long as IC
 resources are, at best, kept constant and policy-
 making users themselves articulate no workable
 limits on their needs.
 Basic Data on the Soviet
 Economy and Soviet Technology
 As noted earlier, the Intelligence Community's
 collective data base on the USSR is now much
 richer than it was a decade or two ago. Statistical
 and descriptive information on Soviet economic
 and technological matters is sometimes analo-
 gous to factual data on Western industrial
 societies, but a significant portion of the IC data
 base consists of estimates and inferences which
 are subject to some-often large - uncertainty.
 There is nothing unusual about this situation.
 Experienced analysts are quite aware of the
 difference between genuine facts and well-
 founded estimates, as well as the difference
 between both these and spongy estimates, dubi-
 ous inferences, and plausible guesses. The princi-
 pal difficulty is that intelligence producers
 seldom detail their analytical assumptions or
 indicate the range of uncertainty that applies to
 the statistical and descriptive underpinnings of

 SECRET
 their analyses. As a result, users often do not
 know how firmly producers know the facts on
 which intelligence conclusions and inferences are
 based.
 Another aspect of the IC data base is worth
 mentioning-namely, its effect on the timeliness
 and quality of intelligence products produced in
 response to user needs. In this instance, timeliness
 refers to the promptness of the producers'
 responses rather than the speed with which
 information on current events is conveyed to
 policy officers. Inadequacies in the data base
 force the producer either to rely more heavily on
 shaky "facts" in his analysis, thus sacrificing
 quality in the interest of meeting the user's
 deadline, or to take more time for basic research
 and/or for making credible estimates, thus
 sacrificing timeliness in the interest of producing
 a better product. Hence,the extent to which IC
 analytical products can be both timely and
 qualitatively better depends largely on the
 adequacy of the pre-existing data base for the
 particular problem being analyzed.
 In recent years, the IC has maintained its data
 base on the USSR, Eastern Europe, and other
 Communist countries chiefly as an adjunct to the
 production of analytical reports on specific topics
 (e.g., the typical OER, OSR, or OSI efforts
 mentioned above). However, the reduction in
 OER re urces allocated to Soviet economic
 25X1     research o                  since 1970- and
 the transfer of senior researc ers to other priority
 areas have contributed to a general reduction of
 systematic, basic work on the Soviet economy.
 Whether there should be a comprehensive effort
 to produce more basic economic intelligence is a
 complicated question, especially since it would
 put a heavy burden on IC resources and would
 require very careful planning. Pending further
 inquiry, we can only note that the present IC
 data base is evidently adequate for some pur-
 poses and inadequate for others
 An example of the former situation is the
 briefing material on the economies of Poland,
 Romania, and Yugoslavia prepared by OER for
 Treasury Secretary Simon's trip in June 1976.
 These materials were an essential contribution to
 the briefing books compiled by the Treasury
 staff, which were an outstanding success. They
 drew upon the intelligence data base, exclusive of
 compartmented information. While they could
 have been better if compartmented material had
 been included, this material was excluded be-
 cause of the lack of special intelligence clearances
 in the Treasury offices that developed the
 briefing books. This is an instance of how
 classification and clearance problems adversely
 affect the adequacy of the Community's prod-
 ucts in satisfying the needs of policy officers. As a
 general rule, however, the Community performs
 well in responding to user requests for collations
 of factual material.
 In contrast, some users feel that the IC data
 base on Soviet industry is still inadequate to
 support the more detailed requirements of mili-
 tary planners-e.g., targeting of US strategic
 forces. Despite recent dramatic improvements in
 DOD's processing and analysis of information
 regarding Soviet industry, there remain gaps in
 our knowledge of the location and identification
 of industrial installations in the USSR. This
 cient, detailed information also affects how we
 intelligence serves other users. For example, gaps
 in available data on non-military sectors of the
 Soviet economy, particularly the interaction
 between civilian facilities and military

 establishments, hamper analysis of the impact of
 Soviet acquisition of Western technology. This
 weakness in turn affects export control policy.
 Intelligence on Technology Transfer
 Policymakers are generally satisfied with much
 of the research and analysis done by the
 Community (notably OER, OSR, and OSI) on
 various sectors of the Soviet economy and on
 specific areas of technology. This impression
 applies chiefly to analytical reports of limited
 scope and less to studies of the interrelationships
 of industrial sectors or multi-disciplinary assess-
 ments of the political, economic, and military
 impact of technology transfer. While consider-
 able work has been done on input-output
 analyses of the Soviet economy, more is needed
 before the economic impact of new technology
 (including new products and know-how obtained
 from the West) can be confidently assessed.
 Similarly, the IC has produced some broad-
 gauged estimates that deal with the political,
 economic, military, and social implications of
 current or prospective developments in the USSR
 (SNIE 11-6-76, Implications of the 1975 Soviet
 Grain Harvest, is a recent example) but more
 needs to be done to provide policymakers with
 the kind of sophisticated intelligence support
 they desire.
 The PFIAB has mentioned this deficiency in
 IC performance; in particular, it has stressed the
 need for a comprehensive and integrated analysis
 of technology transfer to the USSR. Three steps
 are being taken toward meeting this requirement.
 First, several case studies of individual industries
 are being prepared to shed further light on the
 impact of technology transfer on Soviet produc-
 tion of machine tools, computers, instruments,
 and construction and petroleum equipment.
 Second, additional studies of the military impact
 of technology transfer are underway. Third, a
 major interagency reexamination of the Soviet
 economy is planned. It will take account of the
 larger defense burden implied by the revised
 estimates of Soviet military expenditures, effects
 on the total capital stock and labor force,
 implications for future economic growth, and the
 possibility of policy conflicts within the Soviet
 leadership regarding resource allocations. It is
 expected that these efforts will provide a frame-
 work for undertaking a more comprehensive
 study of technology transfer issues in 1977-78.
 Intelligence on Military Economics
 Soviet military economics is another area of
 growing concern to policymakers and military
 planners. The principal topics of interest to users
 are: (1) the composition of Soviet defense
 spending by military service (SRF, PVO, etc.)
 and by resource category (RDT&E, procurement,
 construction, personnel and 0 & M) as well as the
 impact of these activities on the economy; (2)
 comparative analysis of the aggregate military
 outlays of the US and the dollar costs of USSR
 military programs and activities in total and by
 military mission and resource category;  (3)
 changes in these ruble and dollar aggregates over
 time, together with future projections; (4) cost
 effectiveness  and  detailed  cost  analyses of
 selected Soviet weapon systems; and (5) cost
 analyses of civil defense and other programs
 designed to enhance post-attack national sur-
 vival.                                                                  Intelligence on these topics plays an
 important role in estimating current and future
 Soviet capabilities for waging war and in
 preparing net assessments. Indirectly, it may also
 shed light on Soviet policies and behavior outside
 the military sphere since economic growth,
 consumption, and investment are affected by the
 size of the USSR's defense expenditures.
 The IC's underlying research task in this area is
 to determine the cost of the items included in
 whatever  military  expenditure  totals  are
 needed-e.g., totals that are intended to be all-
 inclusive and those that are more restricted in
 scope, figures in rubles and in dollars, and
 statistics for one year or for several years. While
 some reliable data are available, most of the
 building blocks in this vast costing effort must be
 estimated. There are difficult conceptual and
 methodological problems at virtually every stage
 of aggregation, and these problems are exacer-

 bated in constructing the time series and US-
 USSR comparisons wanted by users.
 The Intelligence Community has grappled
 with these problems for many years. Since April
 1973 the primary effort in the Community (viz.
 research done by OSR) has been guided by
 periodic reviews by the DCI's Military Economic
 Advisory Panel (MEAP). Among other things,
 MEAP has recommended that (1) the present
 building block method of estimating Soviet
 military expenditures should be continued, but
 that alternative approaches should be explored;
 (2) thorough documentation of all the inputs to
 the direct costing work should be undertaken; (3)
 greater efforts should be made to prevent misuse
 of comparisons of US and USSR military
 expenditure in dollars; and (4) a coordinated
 agency-wide effort should be made to improve
 our knowledge and estimates of Soviet R&D
 programs and their resources. * Improvements in
 dollar cost factors and in ruble price estimates are
 being realized more or less continuously. They
 will be reflected in revised OSR reports on Soviet
 military expenditures in 1977, as well as in
 several specialized OSR studies planned in
 response to requests from the OSD Director of
 Net Assessment.
 Intelligence Support to
 SALT and MBFR
 In the view of most users, the Community does
 an excellent job in supporting both SALT and
 MBFR negotiations. Current intelligence report-
 ing on these matters has been timely and of high
 quality, and has been supplemented by rapid,
 thorough responses to specific ad hoc requests for
 information. The more detailed inputs to
 SALT/MBFR policy papers are also well re-
 ceived. The principal intelligence product used
 by SALT's Standing Consultative Commission-
 the periodic Monitoring Report-has been re-
 markably consistent with Soviet-supplied infor-
 mation, and has thus been an invaluable
 negotiating tool. In MBFR, significant progress
 * See MEAP, Second Annual Report to the Deputy Director for
 Intelligence (22 January 1976), for further details.
 has been made over the past three years in
 developing agreed, credible Soviet/Warsaw Pact
 force-level estimates in the NATO Guidelines
 Area. Both SALT and MBFR processes have also
 profited considerably from the substantial work
 done by the Community in assessing near-term
 national verification /monitoring capabilities and
 problems.
 The Community's notable success in support-
 ing SALT/MBFR seems largely explained by the
 fact that (1) user requirements have been clearly
 defined and of relatively narrow scope, (2) the
 user-producer dialogue has been close and
 continuing, and (3) considerable collection and
 analytical resources have been allocated to these
 high-priority negotiating processes.
 Nonetheless, certain users call for more longer-
 range analyses related to SALT and MBFR,
 particularly all-source studies of Soviet negotiat-
 ing strategy and tactics and projections of future
 verification capabilities as they pertain to US
 arms control strategy in the 1980s. Such Commu-
 nity undertakings have been impeded by both a
 lack of sufficient analytical resources and major
 uncertainties about the future course of the
 negotiations.
 A more pressing problem expressed by some
 users concerns the Community's treatment of
 uncertainty and dissent in its reporting on
 Soviet/Warsaw Pact forces. For SALT negotia-
 tors, for example, the questions surrounding
 Backfire bomber performance have been of
 extreme importance, but pose a dilemma. On the
 one hand, the earliest possible notification of
 changing Community views and emerging differ-
 ences in this regard could enhance negotiating
 flexibility. On the other hand, early notification
 of preliminary reanalysis could create problems
 for policymakers and negotiators who are left
 with ambiguous intelligence or, even worse, with
 lingering doubts over previously accepted posi-
 tions derived primarily from intelligence. Such
 uncertainty and revision is inherent in intelli-
 gence, however, and users should be educated to
 expect and tolerate it.

 The Community's handling of uncertainty is
 also an increasingly important aspect of the data
 base requirements for MBFR. With the Soviet's
 June 1976 tabling of data on Pact forces which
 were well below Western estimates, the confi-
 dence of the US (and NATO) Intelligence
 Community in its current estimates of Pact force
 levels will be put to a severe test and will require
 thorough exploration. The full, clear communi-
 cation to MBFR negotiators and the Verification
 Panel Working Group of the nature and sources
 of our data base uncertainties-subaggregated to
 the division/regiment level wherever feasible-is
 perceived as a priority requirement for the
 Community. *
 The extent to which the West can fully exploit
 the MBFR negotiating opportunities occasioned
 by the Soviet's recent tabling of data will, of
 course, also depend on the ability of the
 Community to mobilize its resources toward
 strengthening the informational and analytical
 bases for its estimates of Eastern force levels in
 the reductions area. Hence, users urge that
 increased emphasis be placed on:
 ? Clandestine collection programs in Eastern
 Europe.
 ? Data exploitation/analysis by NPIC and
 NSA.
 ? Development of improved analytical meth-
 odologies for order of battle problems.
 ? Full and timely analytical coordination of
 emigre/defector and satellite-derived intelli-
 gence.
 * In this regard, however, corresponding efforts are being made
 to persuade MBFR policymakers and negotiators that (1) the
 discrepancies between Western estimates and the East's tabled
 numbers probably result chiefly from different counting rules, not
 intelligence error, and (2) the nature of the process for estimating
 the manpower of conventional forces may preclude computation of
 the sort of mathematical uncertainty statements for which the
 consumers have asked.
 Finally, it has been noted that CIA personnel
 have traditionally served as the DCI's representa-
 tive on Verification Panel Working Groups. This
 has led to the suggestion that consideration be
 given to expanding the membership to include a
 DIA representative, rotating these assignments
 between CIA and DIA personnel, or designating
 an appropriate NIO to be the Community's
 spokesman.
 Soviet and Warsaw Pact Military
 Capabilities
 Current Products
 Most Washington area consumers are satisfied
 that the Community is doing an excellent job in
 covering those traditional topics which are
 comparatively easy to analyze and/or which
 have enjoyed high visibility with policymakers
 (e.g., strategic forces order of battle and number
 of Soviet divisions). Indeed, the Community
 continues to make significant progress in its
 descriptions of overall Soviet/Warsaw Pact stra-
 tegic and general purpose forces, weapons,
 strengths, organizations, and dispositions.* Con-
 sumers are also generally pleased with the
 Community's ability to respond to specific, ad
 hoc requests for information on these subjects
 with timely, high-quality intelligence; to support
 major continuing negotiations such as SALT and
 MBFR; and to report on headline-worthy
 changes in Soviet/Pact order of battle and
 equipment.
 New Analytical Demands
 Paradoxically, critical comments from users
 reflect these successes of the Community. Intelli-
 gence is increasingly expected to go beyond the
 quantitative measures of the past to the more

 difficult qualitative measures now perceived to
 be nearer the heart of force effectiveness assess-
 ments. The need for enhanced analytical sophis-
 tication in treating Soviet/Pact military matters
 is the logical outgrowth of the constantly
 increasing sophistication of Soviet forces per se,
 as well as Soviet/Pact progress toward achieving
 strategic/conventional force parity with the
 West. As a result, users want to see more
 reporting on such diverse issues as training,
 logistics, maintenance, and command, control,
 and communications. Also, the demand has
 increased markedly for analyses of Soviet/Pact
 strategy, tactical doctrine, and concepts of
 operation, and for integrative assessments of
 overall Soviet/Pact warmaking potential and
 their ability to project military power to distant
 areas. These demands will assuredly increase in
 the future. The recently completed Interagency
 Intelligence Memorandum, Trends in Soviet
 Military Programs, represents one attempt to
 address certain aspects of the requirement for a
 comprehensive analysis of these areas.  The
 difficulties encountered in this undertaking are
 briefly outlined in pages 10 and 11 below.*
 * This user demand for more sophisticated integrative analyses of
 Soviet/Pact capabilities for waging war-analyses which involve
 combining quantitative and qualitative data over a broad spectrum
 of political, military, economic, scientific, and technological
 concerns-is also frequently accompanied by a criticism of the IC in
 general (but of S&T components in particular) that the Community
 does not fully exploit the available expertise. Some major users feel
 the IC tends to consult only within itself or with contractors well
 known to it and with whom the IC feels "comfortable." Too much
 ignored are the knowledge and special competence which reside in
 government laboratories and in the operations staffs of the military
 services. As a result, IC products often appear to some users to be
 shallow (e.g., technical products on pulse power technology, Soviet
 ultra-low frequency wave research and development, and general
 East-West technology transfer issues).
 The competitive analysis approach to NIE 11-3/8-76 (see page 9
 below) is one response to this kind of criticism. Additionally, DOD's
 DDR&E is prepared to lend material assistance to a program of
 personnel exchanges between the IC and various laboratories to
 increase the flow of communication between the military R&D
 community and the IC. Certain elements of DIA and CIA are also
 striving to develop a mutually beneficial relationship with the US
 Army's Training and Doctrine Command to identify and fill gaps in
 knowledge on both sides and to better identify the needs of major
 intelligence users. Similar undertakings by other elements of
 government should be encouraged.
 Resource Allocation Problems
 Such requirements for newer types of sophisti-
 cated analyses are straining the Community's
 capacity to redirect scarce analytical talent while,
 at the same time, continuing to deliver a high
 volume of good analysis of the traditional style
 which is still in demand.
 The Community's experience with MBFR is
 instructive in this regard. The high-intensity
 efforts to develop data bases for these negotia-
 tions have had the attendant impact of siphoning
 off Community resources from other significant
 analytical/production matters, such as the more
 qualitative, non-MBFR aspects of Warsaw Pact
 forces, which are important for net assessments.
 For example, from the time MBFR negotiations
 began in earnest in 1972 until early 1976,
 CIA/OSR's Theatre Forces Division was prevent-
 ed from carrying through its research program on
 trends in Soviet military doctrine and force
 development, primarily because of the concen-
 tration of its limited pool of analysts on MBFR
 support. This illustrates the clear need to
 establish a fuller understanding between users
 and producers of the resource trade-offs required
 to meet national-level priorities for intelligence
 on Soviet/Pact military capabilities.
 The Warsaw Pact NIE
 Related to the foregoing, the user-producer
 debate which followed the publication of NIE
 11-14-75, Warsaw Pact Forces Opposite NATO,
 4 September 1975, has had the salutary effect of
 achieving better understanding of basic user
 needs for general purpose forces intelligence. *
 The debate has also served to illuminate several
 significant issues regarding the NIE process that
 seeks to address these needs.
 The criticisms of NIE 11-14-75 were in four
 general categories:
 ? Scope and Format. Some users at the NSC
 Staff, State, and OSD believed that 11-14-75

 was too narrow in scope and lacked ade-
 quate documentary detail. On the other
 hand, some users in OJCS and OMB were
 favorably impressed by the brevity and
 compactness of the estimate.
 ? Omission. Some users felt that 11-14-75
 failed to come to grips with a number of
 major issues, either avoiding them complete-
 ly or "papering" them over.
 ? Evidence and Supporting Rationale. Some
 high-level users thought that 11-14-75 of-
 fered inadequate rationale and evidence in
 support of its analyses and judgments.
 ? Uncertainties and Data Limitations. Critics
 contended that 11-14-75 failed to consider
 fully the inherent uncertainties in the analy-
 sis of data on Soviet exercises.
 Nevertheless, there is widespread user recogni-
 tion that this NIE has had a significant impact
 on our understanding of Soviet concepts for the
 initial employment of Pact forces and the timing
 of reinforcements from the USSR. The NIE has
 also directly affected DOD force planning and
 programming deliberations regarding NATO's
 posture and concepts of operation.
 Several insights and suggestions were generated
 by the NIE 11-14-75 experience which have
 potential benefits to both users and producers of
 major national military intelligence estimates.
 First, users vary so much in both their needs for,
 and access to, intelligence that no single NIE
 format can satisfy them all. Nonetheless, greater
 effort might be made to involve major users more
 directly in at least the Terms of Reference stage
 of an estimate's development. Further, a bibliog-
 raphy of major contributing sources of intelli-
 gence might be annexed to assist users inclined to
 do additional reading. Another aid to enhancing
 the usefulness of NIEs would be a summary
 keyed to paragraph numbers to make the
 contents of the estimate more accessible, and a
 summary of the main trends of the estimate to
 highlight the new or most significant findings of
 the paper. Finally, once the estimate had been
 published, its producers could form a briefing
 team whose task would be to inform a wider
 audience of the main points of the estimate and
 answer questions directly. Giving the briefing
 team exposure to user concerns and questions
 would be a significant side benefit.
 Net Assessments and Net Technical
 Assessments
 Senior officials were almost unanimous in
 seeing a need for more national (vice depart-
 mental)  net  assessments-particularly  assess-
 ments of such critical, complex matters as the
 US-USSR strategic and naval balances and the
 NATO/Pact central front balance-as a means
 of gaining perspective on Soviet/Pact military
 capabilities and clarifying the options available
 to the US and the consequences of certain
 choices. There is, however, much more diversity
 of opinion as to the feasibility of "netting" these
 major force balances, who should do it, and how
 it should be done. Users and producers generally
 agree that the IC should not be the primary net
 assessor. The IC should certainly supply the
 "Red" data. The DOD should supply the "Blue"
 data, and some think a DOD agency should do
 the actual assessment. However, most consumers
 and producers consulted believe the US would be
 best served with the least possibility of bias by an
 independent interagency group established for
 the purpose, including IC, OSD and/or JCS
 representatives.
 With regard to net technical assessments-
 weapon system interaction analyses such as
 Soviet ICBM capabilities to destroy Minuteman
 silos-it is generally agreed that the Commu-
 nity has an increasingly important responsibility
 to perform these assessments and explore ways to
 improve the attendant analytical methodologies
 and techniques.

 The Competitive Analysis Experiment for
 NIE 11-3/8-76 (Soviet Forces  for Inter-
 continental Conflict Through the
 Mid-1980s)
 At the recommendation of the PFIAB, the
 Community is currently engaged in a substantial
 effort to develop competing analyses of three
 significant issues pertaining to NIE 11-3/8-76:
 Soviet ICBM accuracy, Soviet low-altitude air
 defense effectiveness, and Soviet strategic policy
 and objectives. While the concept of the experi-
 ment has been generally well received by users, it
 is not yet possible to determine the extent to
 which it will yield valuable new insights on the
 major issues it is addressing, or whether this
 approach should be applied to other military
 estimates in the future. Both the A team (inside
 Community) and B team (outside Comunity)
 were scheduled to complete their drafts in
 November 1976. In any event, the Community's
 administrative, financial, security, and intelli-
 gence support to the B team of outside experts
 has been outstanding.
 The competitive analysis experiment has suc-
 ceeded so well thus far because it has had heavy
 support from the top levels of the IC. If the
 results of this experiment justify further efforts
 along these lines, it will require much closer and
 earlier attention to administrative and bureau-
 cratic details. Moreover, a conscious effort will be
 required to prevent the quality of future B teams
 or their analyses from falling off once the glamor
 of the experiment has diminished.
 The Soviet Backfire Bomber
 The widely publicized controversy regarding
 the Backfire bomber that has raged both inside
 and outside the Community over the past few
 years has been of considerable concern to major
 users. It has been cited as a specific example of
 the more general problem wherein the various IC
 agency positions on an issue often become "set in
 concrete" too early-before all data can be
 collected and analyzed-with a resultant inflexi-
 bility that can complicate the national policy-
 making process. In this case, the Backfire
 controversy may mean that major US policy
 decisions (e.g., those in relation to SALT) will
 have to be made without benefit of an agreed,
 high-confidence Community assessment of the
 bomber's performance and mission. There is no
 way to preclude in all cases seemingly disruptive
 argument over vital but uncertain intelligence
 issues that relate directly to contentious policy
 issues. Suppression of argument would surely be
 unacceptable. But cases such as the Backfire
 indicate the desirability of
 ? Identifying potentially controversial issues
 before they become highly "politicized,"

 ? Developing agreed Community collection
 and analytic strategies for minimizing uncer-
 tainties and clarifying disagreements.
 Broad Trends in Soviet Political-
 Economic-Military Strategy
 There has been no National  Intelligence
 Estimate on overall Soviet strategy since 1972.
 Prior to that time, the United States Intelligence
 Board made at least an annual effort to prepare
 an estimate on Soviet objectives and strategies.
 This effort often was accompanied closely by an
 estimate  of  Soviet  military  goals,  which
 attempted to provide an understanding of the
 interaction between Soviet national and military
 strategies. With the demise of the Office of
 National Estimates, the creation of the NIO
 system, and a general trend toward IC resource
 economy after 1972, the IC moved away in large
 measure from the annual NIE on Soviet objec-
 tives and strategy. The estimative focus became
 narrower as the IC generally attempted to
 provide shorter, crisper analyses of greater poten-
 tial use to national decisionmakers.
 Since 1972 the IC has undertaken several
 assessments which touch on the broad topic of
 Soviet policies and often are cited as substitutes
 for a definitive NIE on Soviet policies and
 strategies:
 ? National Intelligence Analytical Memoran-
 dum 11-9-74, Soviet Detente Policy, 23 May
 1974, is generally seen as an adequate
 treatment of the evolution of the USSR's
 detente policy and its durability as a broad
 framework for Soviet international behavior.
 NIAM 11-9-74, however, is often criticized
 for failing to attempt a detailed analysis of
 detente's impact on the USSR's major
 foreign policies.
 ? NIE 11-5-75, The Soviet Assessment of the
 US, 9 October 1975, was an examination of
 the Soviet assessment of US strengths and
 weaknesses as they affect the international
 "correlation of forces" and US attitudes
 toward the USSR in the context of detente.
 Neither NIAM 11-9-74 nor NIE 11-5-75 was
 intended to be a comprehensive assessment of
 broad trends in Soviet strategy, although users
 often have tried to use both products in the
 broader context. Fed by dramatic domestic and
 international developments, the growing desire,
 particularly within DOD, for an "old-style"
 National Estimate on Soviet objectives and
 strategies surfaced at the highest levels of the IC
 earlier this year.
 In February 1976, the Assistant Chief of Staff
 for Intelligence, US Army, formally requested
 that the national intelligence estimative commu-
 nity take an up-to-date look at Soviet long-range
 objectives and the role of military policy in
 support of Soviet goals.  In April 1976 the
 Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency
 expressed his concern over the lack of an NIE on
 the full range of Soviet military capabilities. He
 requested that such an estimate be undertaken
 annually. The IC attempted to satisfy both DOD
 requests by preparing a single estimate, NIE 11-
 4-76:  Trends in Soviet Military Policy and
 Programs. This estimate was to focus on Soviet
 military policy and deal with ideological, politi-
 cal, economic, and other factors as they related
 thereto.
 It became apparent early in the formulation of
 this estimate that there were at least two different
 views of what it should be:
 ? A summary of key judgments and quantita-
 tive data from other estimates of Soviet
 military capabilities (11-3/8, 11-14, 11-15,
 etc.).
 ? The above, plus an analysis of Soviet
 military strategy vis-a-vis the US, particu-
 larly whether the USSR is attempting to gain
 `military superiority."
 The IC's effort stalled in institutional haggling
 and substantive debate over the need for an
 analysis of Soviet objectives. The NFIB finally
 decided:
 ? To eliminate from the paper any overall
 assessment of Soviet national goals.

 ? To publish the paper as an IIM.
 ? To defer until after completion of NIE 11-
 3/8-76 the publishing of an estimate of
 Soviet national goals and the role of military
 power in achieving these goals.
 In order to meet the requirements of NSSM 246,
 this new NIE 11-4-76 was subsequently re-
 scheduled and will be issued in mid-December
 1976.
 An additional consideration in this regard is
 that there are sharply divergent consumer views
 on the national need for such broad assessments
 of trends in Soviet political-economic-military
 strategy. Some high-level users, primarily within
 the NSC Staff and State Department, see no
 compelling requirement for such a product.
 These users tend to view this sort of broad
 assessment as estimative intelligence in the
 "brandy and cigars" mold, contributing little
 beyond the insights available from academic and
 open source research or from the users' own range
 of personal expertise. Other high-level intelli-
 gence users, primarily within the Defense Depart-
 ment, argue that domestic and international
 developments since 1972 urgently dictate a new
 definitive estimate on trends in Soviet strategies
 and that it should include an assessment of the
 impact of these trends on US interests and
 objectives.
 Beyond the issue of the national need for
 assessments of broad trends in Soviet political-
 economic-military strategy, the question of how
 such analyses should be done also must be
 addressed by high-level decisionmakers. As in the
 debate over the conduct of national net assess-
 ments, there is disagreement over whether these
 efforts should be undertaken solely by the IC or
 by an interagency group more capable of
 examining the US policy implications of the
 assessment.
 IC Anticipation of User Needs
 A frequent criticism voiced by users of intelli-
 gence on the USSR/Eastern Europe is that the
 Community should do a better job of anticipat-
 ing user requirements in this area. While ac-
 knowledging the difficulties of satisfactorily
 responding to such a wide consumer audience
 with such disparate (and inadequately communi-
 cated) informational needs, users express some
 concern over what they perceive to be a too-
 passive role being played by elements of the
 Community.
 As an example, the question was asked why
 SNIE 11-6-76, Implications of the 1975 Soviet
 Grain Harvest, had to be initiated by a request
 from the NSC. Further, there is the feeling that
 the Community was somewhat deficient in
 anticipating that Soviet civil defense would
 become a major analytical issue by the end of
 1975. Note was also taken of the developing need
 to study the Soviet SS-X-16 and SS-X-20 missile
 programs to determine what impact the similar-
 ity of these two systems might have on the Soviet
 ability to deceive the US concerning the deploy-
 ment and capabilities of these missiles.
 Clearly, IC agencies, singly or through various
 coordination mechanisms, have a responsibility
 to anticipate such specific user needs and more
 generally attempt to predict Soviet actions in
 contingencies and crisis situations which may
 arise. A corollary to this, however, is that the
 needs, contingencies or potential crises must be
 defined with reasonable care, and there must be
 sufficient time to do the requisite analysis. These
 two desiderata depend primarily on the attitude,
 perceptiveness, and skill of users. While produc-
 ers can hypothesize numerous contingencies and
 user needs, the range of possibilities must be
 limited by the user to avoid wasting analytical
 resources. Further, insofar as possible, users must
 prioritize their needs, indicate what contingen-
 cies they are really worried about, and recognize
 the inherent limitations of intelligence in answer-
 ing their questions.

 ANNEX B
 General
 For intelligence purposes, most of East Asia
 does not receive the high priority associated with
 other areas such as the Soviet Union and Warsaw
 Pact. Nevertheless, high level users generally
 agree that intelligence reporting and analysis on
 East Asia has been adequate given the nature of
 the collection problem in such closed societies as
 Pyongyang and Peking. Most users recognize the
 difficulty of obtaining good, reliable information
 on Chinese affairs and the corresponding weak-
 ness in the Community's ability to cover PRC
 domestic political developments. Users encourage
 the Community to continue working on the
 problem and also express a need for greater
 collection and analytical effort on North Korea
 and Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam.
 Intelligence Community resources have under-
 standably shifted away from Vietnam, and the
 result is a drought of information on Hanoi's
 international intentions, likely courses of action,
 and future negotiating strategies. State Depart-
 ment users and the NSC Staff believe that such
 political intelligence reporting and analysis will
 be of considerable interest when and if the US
 chooses to adjust its Vietnam policy. Such studies
 probably will require improved information. All
 users perceive a need for much more information
 and analysis on North Korea's foreign policy,
 intentions toward South Korea, and internal
 political developments.
 Minor areas of user dissatisfaction in this area
 include: disappointment in the reporting related
 to US negotiations for base rights with Thailand
 (inaccurate data) and the Philippines (paucity of
 information collected on Manila's intentions
 related to US base rights), and the IC's slowness
 in assessing the implications of some current
 events such as the likely political impact of the
 PRC military
 25X6
 exercises along the Formosa Strait during the 25X1
 early summer of 1976. With respect to the US
 On foreign policy matters, users give highest
 marks to State Department cables and CIA
 clandestine reports. Most higher-level users indi-
 cate that they rely more heavily on raw political
 reports related to East Asia than on finished
 current intelligence or research studies. Covert
 Users also note a troublesome lag between the
 time that a development, such as the fall of PRC
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, was treated in

 current intelligence publications and the time
 that in-depth analytical work appeared on the
 same subject. Some characterize this problem as
 the "OCI-OPR gap."
 Major Regional Issues
 North Korea-South Korea
 The areas of priority interest concerning the
 Koreas are (1) North Korean internal political
 developments and foreign policy, and (2) the
 military balance and possibility of hostilities. The
 first concern is primarily a high-priority interest
 for State Department officials and the NSC Staff,
 while the military balance issue understandably
 is of particularly high interest to the Department
 of Defense.
 In general, users are less than satisfied with
 both the intelligence reporting and analysis on
 North Korean domestic political developments,
 diplomatic strategies, and international inten-
 tions. Users profess to appreciate the difficulties
 posed by the collection environment in North
 Korea; nevertheless, they believe that the Com-
 munity still has more to do in "pulling all the
 pieces together" in analyzing intelligence infor-
 mation on North Korea. Of all the East Asian
 requirements, this is the one in which users feel
 that more money and effort should be allocated
 for collection and analysis. Of particular impor-
 tance is the acquisition of a few key North
 Korean intelligence experts of a quality as high as
 some of the China and Soviet specialists. A
 thorough and definitive assessment of North
 Korea's foreign policy and activities is needed by
 all users, with special focus on all the different
 actors in Pyongyang-with their various institu-
 tional perspectives. Treasury officials note the
 need for more analysis of resource allocation in
 North Korea and for more study of the economic
 limitations imposed on major programs.
 Users are more satisfied with the coverage of
 North Korean military capabilities than with the
 coverage of political and military developments.
 The military balance issue, as well as the
 indications and warning problem, have been the
 focus of the Community's effort on Korea.
 Important Community contributions noted by
 several users included a memorandum on North
 Korean military developments, a DIA net assess-
 ment on the Korean military balance, and a
 USIB study group's report on Korean indications
 and warning.*
 There was mixed reaction to the value of the
 DIA net assessment. It was useful for providing a
 comprehensive data base and answering a long-
 standing need for a Korean military factbook. It
 has been criticized for being a compilation of
 data with little or no insight and for failing to
 provide a real net assessment, merely listing
 relative strengths and weaknesses. In fairness to
 DIA, the study's shortcomings probably resulted
 from so many subjects having to be treated in a
 short period of time. The other two assessments
 were well received and served to highlight North
 Korean military developments and the difficulty
 of warning against a North Korean surprise
 military attack.
 Assessments of intelligence support during the
 Panmunjom incident during August 1976 varied
 from adequate to excellent. NSC Staff and DOD
 users, however, were concerned about the Com-
 munity's differing assessments as to whether the
 North Korean attack on the UN officers was
 deliberate. A national task force was established
 to produce National Intelligence Situation Re-
 ports during this crisis, and NSC Staff and other
 users were generally satisfied with these reports.
 One of the recurring problems encountered by
 the IC and the national task force during the
 Panmunjom incident was the poor flow of State
 Department and Joint Staff (DOD) information
 into intelligence channels. Both were reluctant to
 release information which was regarded privi-
 leged-information which had been available

 only to the President or his designated representa-
 tives. Some DOD users at the JCS level believed
 that the Community could have done a better
 job in determining whether the North Koreans
 were dropping, increasing, or holding their
 readiness posture.
 Several users indicate that intelligence report-
 ing on South Korea has improved within the past
 year but that emphasis on collection and analysis
 needs some modification. Users note that collec-
 tion has increased somewhat, but analytical
 results have not yet surfaced. There is an
 abundance of information on the human rights
 issue, What should be of analytic concern is
 South Korea's morale-civilian and military. A
 modest beginning was a DIA Intelligence Ap-
 praisal on army morale.* On the other hand,
 users consistently cite technical reporting and
 analyses as being good, with data on South
 Korea's nuclear intentions and its missile pro-
 grams being particularly useful.
 In sum, there is more the Community can do
 in anticipation of users' needs. Meaningful
 improvement, however, will be dependent on
 breakthroughs on collecting intelligence against
 North Korea. Increased analytical efforts should
 be considered on political, military, and eco-
 nomic developments in North Korea and their
 affect on domestic and foreign policy. Users feel
 that reporting on North Korea's military should
 continue to enjoy high priority, with a closer look
 given to trends and developments, intentions
 toward South Korea, and what Pyongyang's
 strategies are likely to be in achieving its
 objectives. Of potential interest is the impact of
 possible US force posture changes in South
 Korea-what they would mean for the military
 balance, for foreign and domestic Korean policy,
 for proliferation of nuclear weapons in Northeast
 Asia, and for key nations in East Asia. On South
 Korea, additional reporting on major groups
 (such as military leadership) and an assessment
 * DIA Intelligence Armraisal-             Korea Army Morale,

 on South Korea's national morale would be
 extremely helpful to many policymakers.
 China and Taiwan
 The priority interests concerning China are the
 stability of the post-Mao succession, PRC inten-
 tions toward Taiwan, and the attitude of Peking
 toward Moscow and Washington since Mao's
 death.
 Most users rate the intelligence reporting and
 analysis on the power struggle in Peking as good
 given the nature of the problem. Despite
 reporting on a power struggle in China and on
 veiled attacks against Teng Hsiao-ping and Chou
 En-lai, users and intelligence analysts were
 was judged good, providing comprehensive and
 informative "after-the-fact" studies.
 The inability of the IC to foresee such an event
 as the fall of Teng Hsiao-ping is a common
 criticism of the Community. However, many
 senior-level users (e.g., NSC Staff and Country
 Directors at the Department of State), who
 understand the limitations of intelligence, are not
 especially critical. This, however, does not lessen
 their desire for timely and quality intelligence
 reporting on such difficult targets as the closed
 societies in China and North Korea.
 In sum, users judge intelligence reporting on
 internal Chinese developments as generally satis-
 factory. Users believe there are enough China
 analysts, and they do not believe additional
 analytical resources would improve the product.
 The need is for better sources of information and
 a carefully focused analytical effort on the
 critical political, economic, and technical devel-
 opments in the post-Mao era. Several users feel

 that the role of the military has not yet been
 adequately addressed, and they cite an urgent
 need to differentiate among military leaders to
 better understand how individuals may line up.
 (The IC has, however, recently published NIE
 13-3-76, PRC Defense Policy and Armed Forces,
 which addresses the role of the military in
 politics.)
 The question of PRC intentions toward
 Taiwan, is still of high concern. A particularly
 noteworthy Interagency Intelligence Memoran-
 dum, PRC Military Options in the East and
 South China Seas, dated December 1975, ad-
 dressed this problem and provided an assessment
 in advance of the unusual PRC military exercise
 activity across from Taiwan during the early
 summer of 1976. Several users (NSC Staff, State,
 DOD) criticized the Community for not provid-
 ing a timely assessment during the early stages of
 those exercises as to whether they were exercises,
 war preparations, or a "signal" involving
 Taiwan. (However, it should be noted that the
 data base was "soft" and to have adopted a
 definitive interpretation would have ignored the
 ambiguities.) Once the Community focused on
 the PRC military activity, users noted that the
 reporting improved and indicated that some of
 the most comprehensive and best analysis came
 from DIA. Users report that they still do not have
 a thorough appreciation of what took place, but
 the Community has followed up with another
 Interagency Intelligence Memorandum, The Im-
 plications of the Recent PRC Military Activity in
 the Taiwan Strait Area, which assesses the
 meaning of the exercises in terms of PRC
 intentions toward Taiwan.
 Intelligence reporting and assessments on the
 prospects for, impact and meaning of, Taiwan's
 development of nuclear weapons and procure-
 ment of advanced non-nuclear weapons from the
 West is considered good by most users. They note
 this information was helpful in supporting their
 decision-making responsibilities.
 Vietnam
 Vietnam is still a priority issue for those who
 will have to determine policy and negotiate with
 Hanoi on economic issues and normalization of
 relations. In the aftermath of the fall of Saigon,
 intelligence resources probably were shifted away
 too quickly with the result being little reporting
 and analysis on Hanoi's goals in both Indochina
 and the East Asia region. But policymakers have
 expressed a growing need for a better grasp of
 Hanoi's domestic and foreign policies that would
 affect US interests in Southeast Asia and negotia-
 tion strategies. This analytic need cannot be
 filled with the present collection posture, and the
 Community's resources devoted to Southeast Asia
 may have to be reassessed to satisfy these
 anticipated user requirements.

 The Community tends to examine problems in
 East Asia on a country-by-country basis. Several
 users (NSC Staff, State, and DOD) have cited the
 need for a "regional" look, especially in the
 economic and security fields. Key questions
 which they believe would be useful research
 topics include: How do the economies of East

 ANNEX C
 MIDDLE EAST
 General Comments
 Of utmost importance in recent years has been
 the need to focus intelligence efforts in the
 Middle East: first, on issues related to a peace
 settlement, giving major emphasis to the politico-
 military dimensions of the complex Arab-Israeli
 equation; second, on threats, both internal and
 external, to the political stability of key countries
 there; and third, on the activities of major oil
 exporters,  especially as they pertain to US
 international economic policy decisions and
 negotiations. The purpose of this focus was an
 attempt to provide policymakers with reliable,
 timely,  and comprehensive information and
 assessments on political and security situations or
 crises significantly affecting US interests or
 requiring US action.
 Users generally agree that intelligence support
 on the Middle East covers most issues in a
 meaningful and effective manner and is received
 on a timely basis. This support has improved
 noticeably since the  1973 Arab-Israeli war,
 providing the policymaker with  intelligence
 information and finished intelligence generally
 responsive to his wide-ranging needs. Despite
 overall user satisfaction with the Community's
 performance, several problems have been identi-
 fied which, if effectively addressed, would
 significantly improve this performance: the need
 for a better dialogue between user and producer,
 the excessive volume of current intelligence, and
 the need for more in-depth analyses.
 Most users believe that the focus and relevance
 of the intelligence output to policy could be
 sharpened appreciably by improving contacts
 and the dialogue between policymakers and the
 IC.
 Intelligence information and current intelli-
 gence reporting concerning the Middle East is
 more than ample-even voluminous. It covers
 the gamut of political, military, and economic
 subjects and generally is received in a timely
 fashion. Coverage of the fast-moving and com-
 plex Lebanon crisis has been rated especially
 effective. However, a number of users believe
 that the plethora of reports cannot be properly
 digested. Others believe that disproportions exist
 in current intelligence: (a) excessive reliance on
 official rather than unofficial sources  25X6
 raising the possibility that the 25X6
 US is getting a distorted or partial view of long-
 term developments; and (b) the tendency of field
 reporting to focus on the Arab-Israeli confronta-
 tion, at some expense to reporting on North
 Africa and much of the Persian Gulf.
 Most users believe that the data base, despite
 gaps, is considerable and that there is a need for
 integrated, in-depth analyses by the field (includ-
 ing US diplomatic missions) and the Community
 itself. Users express varied views as to the desired
 format and content of such reporting: (a) trend
 reports on a quarterly or some other periodic
 basis, especially of fast-moving or highly complex
 developments; (b) background papers; (c) issue-
 oriented  short-term  and long-term analyses,
 especially of political and economic questions;
 and (d) NIEs and other interagency studies of a
 broad scope.

 Interface with the Intelligence
 Community
 User evaluations of their interface with ele-
 ments of the IC vary considerably-from fre-
 quent contacts to none. Users generally assess
 their relationships with the intelligence elements
 within their own agencies as good to excellent.
 Some users stated that the direct interface with
 other elements of the Community is limited or
 nonexistent. Many users have direct contacts
 with CIA elements,
 The prevailing view among most users is that
 more frequent and direct contacts are desirable,
 especially with the NIO, and that this would lead
 to a clearer view of user requirements and a
 better focus of the intelligence output on policy
 issues. Most users have very little direct contact
 with the NIO. While some users admit that they
 themselves are remiss in improving relationships
 with the Community, others believe that the
 initiative should come primarily from the Com-
 munity. Several users suggested periodic, infor-
 mal discussions among senior policy and intelli-
 gence officials. One user states that a formaliza-
 tion or institutionalization of this process would
 be preferable.
 Current Intelligence
 Most users believe that the high volume of
 field reports-attache and agent reports, inter-
 cepted communications, and Embassy cables-
 and current intelligence products on the Middle
 East more than cover their immediate needs. In
 fact, it is widely acknowledged that current
 intelligence is making a major contribution in
 support of policy. Some of the specific areas cited
 are: Soviet activities in the Middle East, despite
 the difficulties in covering such areas as Iraq and
 Syria; the Lebanon crisis; and arms transfers.
 However, many users believe that the flow of
 current intelligence, especially field reporting, is
 so heavy that it cannot always be effectively
 digested. Some recommend greater selectivity,
 without necessarily impairing the quality and
 timeliness of current intelligence. But most users
 urge more analytical follow-up, particularly in
 pointing out trends and implications.
 Users regard CIA and INR current intelligence
 analytical products as extremely useful, particu-
 larly on political and economic issues, while DIA
 products are helpful on military developments.
 However, many users (including Deputy Assis-
 tant Secretaries) acknowledge that they do not
 read periodic publications regularly-e.g., the
 Weekly Summary-although there is consider-
 able interest on the part of economic users in
 CIA's economic and oil publications. Some users
 state that important items in these and other
 publications are frequently condensed and
 flagged for them by their staffs.
 NIEs and Other Intelligence
 Community Area Analyses
 Several users believe that the latest NIE on the
 Middle East (NIE 35/36-1-76, Middle East
 Military Balance, 1976-1981) is vastly improved
 over earlier estimates. This NIE was well
 integrated, used a broader data base, and
 covered pertinent issues comprehensively. Most
 important, it made realistic judgments while
 avoiding impossible predictions. While a number
 of users in State did not read the estimate, they
 reported that INR had advised them that the
 Estimate was an overall improvement, despite
 some weaknesses.
 A number of users state that some basic
 weaknesses still exist in interagency analyses.
 Some complain that estimates still give the
 appearance of too much "drafting by commit-
 tee," resulting in excessive compromise or blur-
 ring of issues and reluctance or inability to
 articulate clearly areas of honest difference.
 Others express strong interest in more extensive
 IC treatment of the political, economic, and
 sociological aspects of Middle East problems,
 although they recognize that the immediate and

 overriding factor contributing to instability in the
 region is the prospect of Arab-Israeli armed
 conflict and that intelligence assessments focus-
 ing primarily on military developments are
 therefore needed.
 Many users acknowledge that highly sensitive
 information available only to a few high-level
 policymakers can and does have a bearing, but
 not a critical one, on intelligence assessments.
 While recognizing that the problem created by
 sensitive intelligence probably cannot be com-
 pletely resolved, several users suggest that greater
 direct contact between senior policymakers and
 the Community could reduce the impact of
 restricting dissemination of assessments involving
 sensitive information.
 Users generally feel that the production of
 military intelligence has improved considerably,
 both in terms of current and basic analyses.
 Indeed, no major substantive gaps on purely
 military issues have been indicated by the
 policymakers.
 Users generally believe that political and
 especially economic analytical production have
 ask for more economic, sociological, and man-
 power data. Most users believe that this intelli-
 gence information should be used to produce
 more follow-up analyses, trend analyses, inte-
 grated studies, and projections of political,
 economic, and military trends. While it is
 difficult to develop any clear order of priority,

 ANNEX E
 INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL
 ECONOMIC ACTIONS OF THE US GOVERNMENT
 General Comments
 Economic users are generally pleased with the
 output of the Intelligence Community. The
 timeliness, quality, and coverage of the economic
 intelligence provided range from good to excel-
 lent on most topics.
 Most intelligence in the economic area has
 consisted of current intelligence and ad hoc
 analytic reports on subjects of near term interest
 to policy officials. There has been relatively little
 demand from economic policymakers for long
 term studies. On the other hand, it is widely felt
 that more multi-disciplinary, integrated analyses
 of current political and economic developments
 and trends are needed. Interface between users
 and producers of economic intelligence has vastly
 improved in recent years, but most users believe
 further consultation at all levels would help
 ensure that the limited analytical resources of the
 Community are used to maximum advantage.
 Unique Aspects of Intelligence
 Support to International Economic
 Policies
 The success of the IC in producing economic
 intelligence which meets the needs of users results
 from a number of aspects unique to the
 production of economic intelligence: the nature
 of user demand, availability of data, the number
 of organizations involved in production, senior-
 level interest, and relations between Washington
 and Foreign Service posts.
 User Demand
 First, user demands have been largely for ad
 hoc analytic reports and field reporting on
 current topics and for current intelligence-an
 area where the IC has done reasonably well in
 recent years. Second, there is a generally good
 working relationship between the producers and
 consumers of economic intelligence. The con-
 sumers increasingly are alerting intelligence to
 the  policy and  negotiating issues requiring
 intelligence support and economic intelligence
 and field reporters have been very responsive in
 answering consumer requests. Third, while a
 significant body of economic material required
 by the policymakers must be acquired by the
 aggressive collection activities of State, CIA and
 NSA, much of the information required in this
 area, by its very nature, tends to be more openly
 available than in other fields, e.g., defense
 intelligence. This is the case even with the
 Communist countries, since dissemination of
 economic data is essential to the centralized
 planning process.  The accurate and timely
 economic information needed by economic
 policymakers requires careful analysis of im-
 mense volumes of data available from both open
 and semi-overt sources throughout the world.
 Users are very familiar with much of this
 unclassified material and in many cases are
 content to receive NSA, CIA/DDO, and embassy
 reports with little analysis. They themselves are
 willing to integrate intelligence reports with the

 SECRET
 information they already have at hand from
 other sources.
 Organizational Arrangements
 Most departments and agencies with responsi-
 bilities for international economic affairs have
 their own analytic resources within their various
 policy offices which provide them with the bulk
 of their needs for analytic support. Within the
 Intelligence Community,  as strictly defined,
 CIA's Office of Economic Research (OER) is the
 principal producer of finished economic intelli-
 gence. Other DDI offices (Current Intelligence,
 Political Research, Geographic and Cartographic
 Research) also produce some, as do many
 embassies. State/INR produces a series of fin-
 ished analytic reports on economic subjects
 related to the needs of State policymakers but
 also of interest to other elements of the economic
 community.  CIA/DDO,  NSA,  and embassy
 reporting are often key sources for the production
 of finished intelligence.
 OER in particular has long established direct
 contacts, formal and informal, with all the
 economic departments and agencies of the
 Government. These contacts are at various levels
 and help ensure that output is relevant to
 consumer needs. The Director of OER also chairs
 the DCI's Economic Intelligence Committee,
 which coordinates interdepartmental collection
 guidance on economic subjects and participates
 in the monitoring of economic intelligence
 production.
 The Treasury intelligence unit provides an
 interface between producers and users. Members
 of this unit, in cooperation with CIA and NSA,
 provide briefings-daily in most cases and less
 frequently in others-to top Treasury officials. A
 senior OER analyst, detailed to Treasury's Office
 of National Security, briefs other members of the
 Economic Policy Board (EPB). These briefings
 provide policymaking officials an opportunity to
 request additional information or studies on
 subjects of interest. Officers in the Office of
 National Security-some of whom are on loan
 from State, CIA and NSA-also provide inputs to
 analytic work of other Treasury officials. These
 arrangements, combined with OER's direct ties
 to its users, result in rapid, relevant producer
 responses to user needs and good feedback from
 users to producers. The Department of Com-
 merce is considering establishing a similar intelli-
 gence liaison unit.
 Senior-Level Interest
 The Secretary of the Treasury in his role as
 head of the Treasury Department, Chairman of
 the Economic Policy Board (EPB), and as head of
 other interagency committees plays a key role in
 all US economic policy decisions, foreign as well
 as domestic. He has taken a personal interest in
 developing arrangements for ensuring more effec-
 tive intelligence support. He has met with the
 DCI and has exchanged views by phone and
 correspondence. He has committed Treasury to
 providing CIA with whatever Treasury materials
 it needs to carry out its responsibilities (e.g.,
 Treasury briefing books, memcons, Treasury
 analytic reports, etc.). In November, 1976, the
 DCI and the Chairman of the President's Foreign
 Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) met with
 the Secretary and the EPB to evaluate intelli-
 gence support to the economic policymaking
 community and to recommend means for im-
 proving this support. A report based on these
 discussions together with certain recommenda-
 tions is in preparation.
 The PFIAB has taken a strong interest in
 intelligence support to economic activities and
 has submitted various reports and recommenda-
 tions on this subject to the President.
 Relations Between Washington and
 Posts Abroad
 The quality of finished economic intelligence
 depends to a considerable degree on the quality
 of reporting from US embassies. Useful reporting
 in turn requires that Washington make its needs
 known to economic officers in the field. Basic
 guidance is given by an instruction to each post
 called the Comprehensive Economic Reporting
 Program (CERP). This is supplemented by an

 Evaluation of Intelligence Support to
 Economic Policyrnakers
 Positive Reactions
 Economic users are generally satisfied with the
 output of the IC. For the most part, they find it a
 useful and timely supplement to the mass of
 economic information and reports available from
 other sources. Most of the material that policy
 consumers require is prepared by their own staffs.
 Within the Intelligence Community, as strictly
 defined, most of the finished economic intelli-
 gence is provided by OER/CIA.
 OER attempts to fulfill three major functions:
 (1) to act as a research service, (2) to monitor
 foreign economic trends, and (3) to provide a
 source of independent foreign economic assess-
 ment for policymakers. Its two principal periodic
 publications are:
 ? Economic Intelligence Weekly. This widely
 circulated secret publication usually includes
 a half-dozen articles placing major economic
 developments in perspective, plus shorter
 notes on items of current interest. Attached
 to this publication is "Economic Indica-
 tors," an unclassified compilation of charts
 and tables providing up-to-date information
 on the domestic and external economic
 activities of major non-Communist devel-
 oped countries, as well as price trends for
 major agricultural products and industrial
 materials. This publication is generally well
 regarded by consumers.
 ? International Oil Developments (IOD). This
 bi-weekly publication is usually classified
 "SECRET." It assesses price and production
 policies of the OPEC countries, outlines
 major energy developments in the rest of the
 world, and often contains articles on nuclear
 and other non-oil sources of energy. An
 unclassified "Statistical Survey" attached to
 the IOD provides the latest available data
 on worldwide production, stocks, trade, and
 prices of oil, as well as some data on natural

 Approved For Release 2003/09/29 : CIA-RDP82M00311R000100280001-1
 gas. Many officials concerned with foreign
 economic policy regard this as one of the
 most useful publications in Washington.
 OER also produces a wide variety of research
 studies, memoranda, and notes, some of which
 are unclassified, including some on Communist
 countries. In the second quarter of 1976, for
 example, OER completed 24 self-initiated stud-
 ies, of which half were on Communist countries.
 During this three-month period, it also responded
 to 120 formal requests from 17 government
 departments and agencies, as well as the Con-
 gress. The requests came from all levels of the
 bureaucracy, ranging from the Vice President to
 desk officers in State, Treasury and Commerce.
 Somewhat less than one-third of the requests
 were for information on the Communist coun-
 tries, with many on oil and the Middle East.
 Users are generally pleased with the response to
 their requests.
 The National Intelligence Daily, a highly
 classified roundup of major current developments
 by OCI, in cooperation with other IC organiza-
 tions, is considered useful by the relatively small
 number of senior officials to whom it is distrib-
 uted. Treasury has felt that its contents were not
 always timely and sometimes omitted develop-
 ments of interest to economic policymakers.
 The Weekly Summary, another OCI product,
 has been described as "not a busy man's
 publication." On the other hand, the longer
 articles now do include a brief summary. If not
 generally required reading for top officials, the
 Weekly does provide useful assessments to staff-
 level officers of the political and economic scene
 in individual countries. "Staff Notes," a group of
 publications prepared for regional specialists of
 the Washington community on current intelli-
 gence subjects, performs a similar function.
 CIA's response to requests for current economic
 intelligence for the preparation of briefing and
 background papers for top officials is generally
 considered excellent. Specific examples cited by
 users include support for the two economic
 summit meetings (in France and Puerto Rico)
 and for trips by Secretary Simon to the Middle
 East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. White
 House staff personnel also state that they can
 count on an independent, objective assessment
 from OER to balance departmental bias on some
 economic issues.
 Some Problem Areas
 Many users feel that the high classification of
 some economic intelligence substantially restricts
 its usefulness. Particularly in large depart-
 ments-Treasury, Commerce, and to some extent
 State-most staff personnel do not have special
 intelligence clearances. The result is that they
 occasionally write briefing papers for top officials
 without being aware of certain important facts,
 though senior supervisors usually have access to
 much of the information that is missing. This
 problem could be alleviated by (a) having more
 people in the policymaking departments cleared
 for access to compartmented intelligence and (b)
 by having the producers in the Intelligence
 Community sanitize certain of this information
 and reduce its level of classification. *
 Although the Community has done well in
 meeting the needs for current economic intelli-
 gence, policy decisions on economic matters must
 also take political factors into account. More
 integrated political-economic analyses of current
 developments and short-term trends are needed.
 Some NIEs provide an integration of economic
 factors with political, technological and military
 elements. Most NIEs, however, have little in the
 way of economic content. One user has noted. for

 gence.

 Increasingly, it is difficult to gain an adequate
 appreciation of critical situations abroad without
 understanding the interplay between the princi-
 pal economic and political forces. Some produc-
 ers and users argue, however, that an economic
 input is not essential to the purpose of every NIE
 dealing with political developments.
 Some users were concerned that summary NSA
 reports may be misinterpreted. They often give
 the appearance of being analytical even though
 they rely essentially on a single source of
 information;  moreover,  some users feel the
 drafter of NSA reports is normally not an expert
 in the field he is writing about. Despite this,
 consumers value NSA reporting and find sum-
 maries such as those on the Middle East and on
 energy developments useful and timesaving.
 Several users feel that the Community has not
 given adequate support to the continuing series
 of meetings related to North-South or Less
 Developed Country (LDC) issues. Information
 has often been lacking on the positions of
 particular countries, the way in which the LDCs
 reach a consensus, and the extent to which LDC
 representatives are bound   if at all - by
 instructions of their governments. While ade-
 quate information on some commodities pro-
 duced by LDCs is available, additional analysis
 of production, trade, and price trends of other
 commodities would be helpful. One suggestion
 which appears to have considerable support
 among policy officials is for a periodic publica-
 tion by OER of a commodity review similar to its
 "International Oil Developments."
 There is general agreement that the interface
 between consumers and producers of economic
 intelligence has greatly improved in recent years,
 but a number of users felt there was need for
 further improvement. Many consumers lack
 knowledge of what they can and cannot expect
 to obtain in support from the Intelligence
 Community. Users acknowledge that they often
 criticize the intelligence product without bother-
 ing to convey their views to the Community.
 More two-way communication continues to be
 needed, with some careful thought given to the
 development of procedures to avoid the increased
 interchange from becoming unduly time-con-
 suming for either side.

 ANNEX F
 REQUIREMENTS FOR INTELLIGENCE RELATED TO WARNING,
 CRISIS AND WARTIME OPERATIONS
 As a crisis passes through various possible
 phases, ranging from a minor isolated incident to
 a nuclear war, the kind of intelligence required to
 support the decisionmaking process varies. The
 Community attemps to provide adequate infor-
 mation about situations and developments so
 that decisionmakers can take actions to prevent
 crises. If the US is unsuccessful in preventing or
 avoiding a crisis, the Community attempts to
 provide timely, accurate information about cur-
 rent or impending actions of foreign countries
 which could affect the crisis, to support US
 political, diplomatic, and military efforts to
 contain the crisis and safeguard US interests.
 Should the crisis escalate to armed conflict
 involving US forces, national intelligence assets
 must  provide increased support to military
 commanders. However, especially in a major US-
 USSR war there are important national needs for
 intelligence that must continue to be satisfied.
 The President, NSC, and JCS must make
 decisions, for example, on the strategic disposi-
 tion of forces, the use of nuclear weapons,
 political and possibly military actions regarding
 countries not directly involved in the conflict,
 and means of moving the conflict from the
 battlefield to the negotiating table. Throughout
 this spectrum of warning, crisis, and war,
 intelligence organizations must be able to make
 smooth transitions from one stage to the next,
 balancing national and tactical needs and
 maintaining flexibility to respond rapidly to
 demands which are difficult to predict in
 advance of a crisis or war.
 To produce timely and complete intelligence
 of greatest benefit to decisionmakers in a crisis or
 war, the intelligence Community must also
 receive information reflecting US decisions and
 actions. Without such feedback, the Intelligence
 Community cannot properly assess foreign ac-
 tions in a rapidly developing situation, particu-
 larly actions which respond to US actions or
 diplomatic signals. Advance notice of US actions
 or signals allows the Community to ensure that
 collection assets are positioned and alerted for
 immediate observation of foreign responses. Thus
 it is clearly in the decisionmaker's interest to
 inform the appropriate Community elements of
 US intentions, decisions, and actions so that
 intelligence support can be properly focused
 during the deliberative phase of these evolutions,
 as well as to improve the accuracy of intelligence
 assessments in subsequent cycles of the crisis. The
 Community much protect such information
 concerning US operations and policy delibera-
 tions as it does other highly classified informa-
 tion.
 To support this process of interaction, it is
 necessary to establish effective communication
 systems and procedures to provide the timely
 exchange of information among all elements of
 the government which have responsibilities bear-
 ing on the crisis situation. Such communications
 will facilitate the convergence of critical informa-
 tion and its coherent analysis, including dissent-
 ing views, for presentation to decisionmakers.

 Recent Improvements in Intelligence
 Related to Warning
 In recent years, the Community has taken
 better advantage of advances in communications
 and data processing techniques to improve
 warning and crisis operations. New procedures
 have also improved communications laterally,
 across both the Community and other elements
 of the government, as well as vertically with
 those organizations responsible for crisis deci-
 sions.
 The accumulated experience gained over many
 years and in many crisis situations has taught the
 Intelligence Community some valuable, if costly,
 lessons on ways to improve the efficiency and
 performance of the warning process. Post mor-
 tems and other reviews conducted following such
 events as the October 1973 Mid East war, the
 Cyprus Crisis of 1974, and the Mayaguez
 Incident of 1975 have proved to be a most useful
 mechanism for identifying specific problems and
 deficiencies affecting the Community's perfor-
 mance and for recommending steps to remedy
 them. Following are some corrective actions
 taken by the Community within the past year.
 New or Improved Procedures and Systems
 ? A number of special and improved proce-
 dures and systems were developed to provide
 warnings to US flag ships. These measures
 constitute the first effective means of linking
 the Intelligence Community's warning ap-
 paratus with those other US organizations
 sharing responsibility for marine safety.
 ? A directory is being compiled of all US
 Government watch and operations centers,
 both here and abroad, to improve communi-
 cations among concerned government ele-
 ments during crises.
 ? A revised and expanded DCI Directive
 (DCID 7/1), Handling of Critical Informa-
 tion, clarifies and improves the procedures
 governing the recognition and transmission
 of this critical information, via appropriate
 operations centers in the Washington area,
 to senior government officers.
 ? A Handbook of Standard Operating Proce-
 dures for the Reporting of Critical Informa-
 tion has been developed. This expands on
 DCID 7/1 and provides detailed procedures
 for handling critical information (CRITIC)
 messages. A condensed, unclassified version
 of these CRITIC procedures has also been
 prepared and given wide dissemination
 throughout the US Government.
 ? A new computerized system, providing se-
 cure voice and visual text for remote
 conferencing, will become operational at the
 principal intelligence agencies in the Wash-
 ington area in late 1976. This system, called
 CONTEXT (Conferenced Text Editing),
 will facilitate analysts' preparation of time-
 critical intelligence products, such as crisis
 situation reports, and will also permit emer-
 gency meetings (including those of the NFIB
 to) be convened remotely.

 Improved Coordination and
 Responsiveness of Technical
 Collection Systems During Crises
 ? Planning has been completed to provide for
 the rapid tasking and redirection during
 crises of a new collection system which will
 become operational in late 1976.
 ? The Defense Department's Collection Co-
 ordination Facility, which is expected to
 become operational late this year, will
 permit consolidation of DOD time-sensitive
 requirements and more efficient tasking of
 technical collection systems.
 Improved Interface Between
 Policy/Operations Elements and the
 Intelligence Community.
 ? Periodic conferences of the heads of Com-
 munity and non-Community operations/in-
 telligence centers are encouraging closer
 cooperation among operational and intelli-
 gence elements to discuss and resolve matters
 and problems of mutual concern.
 ? National Intelligence Officers convene fre-
 quent interagency meetings of working-level
 analysts, collectors, and policy or operational
 officers to ensure that they all are familiar
 with current problems and activities affect-
 ing their areas of responsibility.
 ? The Pacific Command has established in
 Korea an all-source "fusion center," similar
 to the integrated operations center being
 established within NATO at Boerfink,
 Germany. The Korean fusion center collo-
 cates J-2 (intelligence) and J-3 (operations)
 personnel and provides operational data on
 US and allied forces for immediate use in the
 intelligence and warning process, The center
 provides more effective support to Com-
 mander, US Forces, Korea, especially during
 crises.
 ? Modernization of facilities of the National
 Militay Intelligence Center (NMIC) and the
 National  Military  Command  Center
 (NMCC) and their collocation will, when
 completed, allow for closer coordination
 between the operational and intelligence
 functions of the military and permit more
 effective support to national authorities.
 Improved Indications and Warning
 Capabilities and Alerting Mechanisms
 ? Revised procedures define responsibilities of
 the National Intelligence Officers and other
 elements of the Community for the prepara-
 tion, coordination, and issuance of "Intelli-
 gence Alert Memoranda."
 ? Procedures have been approved for the
 issuance by the Strategic Warning Staff
 (SWS) of a Strategic Warning Notice when-
 ever there is evidence that the Soviet Union,
 the Warsaw Pact, the People's Republic of
 China, or North Korea is considering mili-
 tary action beyond its borders.
 ? Procedures have been developed to produce
 for senior consumers during crises an all-
 source, Community-coordinated National
 Intelligence Situation Report (NISR). The
 first NISR was produced in August 1976
 during the Korean DMZ crisis.
 ? Continuing efforts are being made to im-
 prove the presentation and display of indica-
 tor lists, particularly in high potential crisis
 areas such as Korea and Europe.
 Major Long-Standing Problems
 Despite the corrective actions described above,
 certain long-standing problem areas remain.
 Relatively little progress has been made on the
 long-standing and important problems of inte-
 grating intelligence with political and military
 crisis actions, improving the Community's abili-
 ties for early and accurate identification of
 impending crises, and establishing clearly the
 responsibilities of the DCI during crises and
 wartime.
 One problem is the tendency of the intelli-
 gence, policy, and operational elements of the
 Government to restrict the flow of information to
 35
 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2003/09/29 : CIA-RDP82M00311R000100280001-1
 Approved For Release 2003/09/29 : CIA-RDP82M00311R000100280001-1
 one another. Ingrained attitudes which exist
 within the Intelligence Community, the policy-
 making, and the operational components of the
 Government are largely responsible for this
 situation. The Intelligence Community, for ex-
 ample, is concerned that its product might be
 compromised and leans toward compartmenta-
 tion to protect sensitive sources and methods. In
 some cases this has inhibited the timely reporting
 of important intelligence data to users, including
 those who may be required to take some
 preventive action because of the data. The same
 tendency exists among policymakers, especially
 in the State Department, where there is reluc-
 tance to disseminate some types of cables
 (NODIS and EXDIS) to other elements of the
 Government lest a leak of sensitive information
 undercut the Government's political and diplo-
 matic efforts. The problem also manifests itself
 during crises when-as happens all too fre-
 quently-policymakers, special crisis task forces,
 or the military withhold information on options
 under consideration, planned actions, or ap-
 proved operations. The result is that the Commu-
 nity has an inadequate basis for tasking intelli-
 gence collection assets for observation of foreign
 responses to US actions and is hampered in
 interpreting foreign actions because some may be
 taken in response to US actions. Moreover, when
 the Community is not aware of options under
 consideration and is not involved in staffing
 them, policymakers are not afforded an evalua-
 tion of those options from the Community's
 perspective on foreign viewpoints and capabili-
 ties.
 Clearly, sensitive information, sources, and
 operational plans must be protected. However,
 such information should be routinely dissem-
 inated to all relevant elements of the Govern-
 ment with appropriate restrictions, when neces-
 sary, on further distribution rather than the
 current practice which is to restrict dissemination
 of potentially sensitive material as a matter of
 routine. The Intelligence Community Staff is
 working with State and DOD to develop
 procedures in accord with this principle in the
 case of the  National  Intelligence Situation
 Report. But this problem exists in many areas
 related to warning and crisis operations and more
 needs to be done, on a case-by-case basis, to work
 out procedures which will provide the best
 possible intelligence support to the Government
 during crises, while protecting truly sensitive
 information and operations.
 The Intelligence Community must improve its
 capability for timely recognition of impending
 crisis and hostile foreign actions so as to provide
 better warning of such events. This is a matter of
 selecting relevant indicators from a large flow of
 data, recognizing departures from "normal"
 patterns of international behavior, and identify-
 ing and estimating the likelihood of various
 foreign courses of action. The decisions to issue a
 warning may require balancing the costs of false
 alarms (disruption of normal US Government
 processes undercutting the credibility of the
 Intelligence Community and generating unwar-
 ranted hostile reactions) against the advantages
 of early warning if a crisis is indeed pending
 (alerting of military forces and diplomatic posts,
 and US actions to head off or mitigate the crisis).
 As users and the Community both become more
 sophisticated in their understanding of the nature
 of the warning problem, more emphasis is being
 placed on accurate identification of pattern
 changes and their implications-the charting of
 the "international temperature"-than on pure
 "prediction" of events by the intelligence Com-
 munity. Some users suggest the expansion of the
 responsibility of the SWS to encompass a much
 broader warning function. The spotting of key
 indications is becoming more difficult as the
 technological capability for collection grows, and
 with it the volume of data available to intelli-
 gence. Further, improvements in analytical tools
 for pattern recognition have not kept pace with
 technical collection capabilities.
 Human analytical limitations which are part
 of the warning problem include:
 ? The tendency to estimate the likelihood of
 various foreign actions from the perspective
 of US behavior patterns and standards of
 36

 Approved For Release 2003/09/29 : CIA-RDP82M00311R000100280001-1
 "rationality," rather than from the perspec-
 tive of the foreign people involved.
 ? The inherent difficulty of anticipating an
 opponent's actions or intentions when the
 opponent has not yet made a decision. The
 difficulty increases as the opponent's deci-
 sions are influenced by US policies and
 actions,
 ? The failure to integrate intelligence over
 time, prior to or during crises, to detect
 cumulative evidence of changes and to
 identify trends which point to patterns of
 behavior.
 Post mortems of Community performance
 during crises have proved to be a. most useful
 means for surfacing such analytical problems and
 working out their solutions. However, the current
 environment of leaks and increased availability
 of Intelligence Community reports to the Con-
 gress tends to discourage written post mortems.
 But the Community must continue to conduct
 post-mortem reviews, with the rigorous self-
 examination they entail, if it is to identify and
 take corrective actions.
 Reflecting many of the problem areas discussed
 above is the apparent systemic discontinuity in
 the interchange of warning and crisis related
 information between the operating environments
 of key organizations supporting national policy
 formulation and decisionmaking (e.g., the NSC
 and WSAG) and the component agencies of the
 Intelligence Community.
 The present structure of warning and crisis
 related intelligence collection, processing and
 reporting facilities essentially terminates at the
 departmental or agency level, as represented by
 the various operations and alert centers alluded
 to earlier. Thus, the upward flow of warning and
 crisis intelligence tends to be diffused due to the
 absence of a focal point at which the products
 and capabilities of the Community are integrated
 for national-level support. This lack may be the
 underlying cause of significant redundancy and
 duplication in intelligence reporting to decision-
 making levels of government during crisis
 periods. Recently developed National Intelli-
 gence  Situation  Report  procedures  promise
 amelioration of the latter problem. However,
 inasmuch as their implementation is based on ad
 hoc action on a situation-to-situation basis, they
 must be considered an interim improvement
 rather than a permanent remedy for the disconti-
 nuity noted.
 A basic problem is that the role and responsi-
 bilities of the DCI during crises and wartime are
 not spelled out in existing legislation or executive
 orders. It is clear that, during a major confronta-
 tion between the United States and the Soviet
 Union or a war, with military operations impend-
 ing or in progress, national intelligence assets
 should provide greater support to military oper-
 ations than is the case during peacetime. It is
 equally clear that in such times the President and
 the National Security Council must make deci-
 sions which can affect the vital interests of the
 nation-decisions on broad strategy, the disposi-
 tion and employment of conventional fores, the
 use of nuclear weapons, and the conduct of
 negotiations intended to end the crisis or war.
 These decisions must be supported by intelli-
 gence, presumably through a channel which is
 independent of the Department of Defense.

 A new examination of the long-standing

 crises or war should be high on the agenda of
 both the DCI and the National Security Council.
 This examination should include a definition of
 the relation between the DCI and other authori-

 Joint Chiefs of Staff) during major crises or war
 and the development of plans to provide

 procedures to allow the DCI to carry out his
 responsibilities.
