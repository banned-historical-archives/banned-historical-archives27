 name stricken from American docu-

 fact of a country's existence.
 For too long we ignored the existence

 The most important thing this House,
 can do for the people of Free China is
 to make sure they can always purchase
 all the advanced weapons they need to
 defend themselves.
 Th Marx Brothers war in northern
 Vietnam.has shown Red China to be a
 military paper tiger. We must make sure
 that American taxpayers are not called
 upon, through subsidized loans, to give
 the tiger claws. Free China asks for no
 handouts. We must turn down the Com-
 munists' demands for subsidized Amer-

 LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
 (Mr. RHODES asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. RHODES. Mr. Speaker, I take this
 time to inquire of ,the distinguished ma-
 jority leader as to the program for the
 balance of the week and for next week.
 Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, if the
 gentleman would yield-
 Mr. RHODES. I yield.
 Mr. WRIGHT. The program for the
 remainder of this week is the bill H.R.

 an open rule providing 2 hours of gen-
 eral debate, and we hope to conclude
 that debate today.
 Then, on Monday next the House
 would meet at noon. No legislative busi-
 ness is contemplated.
 On Tuesday, we would meet at noon..
 If we do not complete H.R. 2479 today,
 we will first return to that bill. There are
 no suspensions scheduled, but we will
 then have a series of three House Com-
 mittee funding resolutions.
 Then, we will have House Resolution
 118, to establish a Select Committee on
 Committees.
 On Wednesday, we would meet at 3
 p.m. and consider H.R. 2283, Council on
 Wage and Price Stability Reauthoriza-
 tion, subject to the granting of a rule.
 On Thursday, we would meet at 11
 a.m. and take up H.R. 2534, -providing
 a temporary debt limit increase, subject
 to the granting of a rule.
 We would expect not to be in session
 on Friday of next week, March 16. The
 House will adjourn by 5:30 on alYdays
 except Wednesday. Any further program,
 of course, would be announced later.
 Mr. RHODES. May I ask the distin-
 guished majority leader, if the business
 of the day is not completed by the time
 of adjournment, will there possibly be a
 session tomorrow?
 Mr. WRIGHT. We expect to complete
 that business today.
 Mr. RHODES. Previously, it was an-
 CONGRESSIONAL. RIECORID -IHI?USIE          March 8, 1979

 today. We expect to complete action on
 H.R. 2479 today. If we fail to do so we
 will return to it on Tuesday next.

 UNITED STATES-TAIWAN RELA-
 TIONS ACT
 Mr. DODD. Mr. Speaker, by direction
 of the Committee on Rules, I call up
 Ouse Resolution 148 and ask for its im-
 ediate consideration.
 The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
 lows :
 H. RES. 148
 Resolution providing for the consideration of
 the  bill  (H.R.  2479)  to help  maintain
 peace, security, and stability in the West-
 ern Pacific and to promote continued ex-
 tensive, close, and friendly relations be-
 tween the people of the United States and
 the people on Taiwan
 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this
 resolution it shall be in order to move, sec-
 tions 401(b)  and 402(a) of the Congres-
 sional Budget Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-
 344) to the contrary notwithstanding, that
 the House resolve itself into the Committee
 of the Whole House on the State of the
 Union'for the consideration of the bill (H.R.
 2479) to help maintain peace, security, and
 stability in the Western Pacific and to pro-
 mote continued extensive, close, and friendly
 relations between the, people of the United
 States and the people on Taiwan, the first
 reading of said bill shall be dispensed with,
 and all points of order against said bill for
 failure to comply with the provisions of
 clause 5, rule XXI are hereby waived. After
 general debate, which shall be confined to the
 bill, and shall continue not to exceed two
 hours, to be equally divided and controlled
 by the chairman and ranking minority mem-
 ber of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the
 bill shall be read for amendment under the
 five-minute rule by titles instead of by sec-
 tions. At the conclusion of the consideration
 of the bill for amendment, the Committee
 shall rise and report the bill to the House
 with such amendments. as may have been
 adopted, and the previous question shall be
 considered as ordered on the bill and amend-
 ments thereto to final passage without inter-
 vening motion except one motion to recom-
 mit.
 XXI of the rules of the House.
 Section 401(b) (1) bars the considera-
 tion of any bill which provides new en-
 titlement authority to become effective
 before the first day of the fiscal year
 which begins in the calendar year in
 which the bill is reported. Section 203 of
 H.R. 2479 contains entitlement provi-
 sions which would become effective prior
 to October 1, 1979 (the first day of
 fiscal year 1980), and therefore would be
 subject to points of order under section
 401(b) (1) of the Budget Act.
 Section 402(a) provides that it shall
 not be in order to consider any bill au-
 thorizing the enactment of new budget
 authority for a fiscal year unless the bill
 has been reported by May 15 preceding
 the beginning of the fiscal year. Since
 this bill was not reported prior to May 15,
 1978, it would violate this provision of
 the Budget Act.
 The chairman of the Budget Commit-
 tee has informed the Rules Committee
 that he and his committee have no objec-
 tion to these waivers since "strict com-
 pliance with the Budget Act would nec-
 essarily result in a breach in U.S. rela-
 tions with Taiwan and that bill repre-
 sents no real additional costs."
 Finally, the resolution also provides a
 waiver of all points of order against the
 bill for its failure to comply with clause
 5 of rule X I of the rules of the House
 which prohibits ? the inclusion of appro-
 priations in a legislative bill.
 The resolution provides, in addition,
 for one motion to recommit.
 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2479, the United
 States-Taiwan Relations Act, redefines
 U.S. relations with Taiwan in light of
 President Carter's  formal  diplomatic
 recognition of the Peoples Republic of
 China. As my colleagues know, this is a
 rather controversial bill because it seeks
 to establish the mechanisms of our fu-
 turenongovernmental relationship with
 the People of Taiwan now that our for-
 mal diplomatic links have been severed.
 I would like to compliment my col-
 league from Wisconsin, Chairman ZAB-
 LOCKI, for what I believe has been a su-
 perlative job in treading his way through
 a minefield of hotly differing opinion
 and reporting out a fine and well con-
 sidered bill.

 The House met at 11 a.m.
 Rabbi Dov Edelstein, Moses Monte-
 flore Synagogue, Appleton, Wis., offered
 the following prayer:
 Ever living God: In these trying times
 of confusion and perplexity, we are look-
 ing to Thee for guidance and sustenance.
 We pray and grasp for peace and for
 harmonious relations among all Thy
 children; yet, there are detractors who
 despise these lofty aims and hinder their
 realization among mankind. Give its, 0
 Lord, strength and encouragement that
 we may not falter.
 Bestow Thy guidance and inspiration
 upon the elect representatives of this
 American Nation that they discharge
 their heavy responsibilities with pru-
 dence, courage, and humility. May they
 navigate the ship of our Nation in the
 turbulent waters to secure and tranquil
 havens. Do Thou crown with success the
 efforts of the President of the United
 States at establishing lasting peace
 among the nations in the Middle East.
 Imbue, 0 Lord, the hearts of all Thy
 children with the precious gift of peace
 as an everlasting blessing for us, and for
 Thy eternal glory. Amen.
 THE JOURNAL
 The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-
 ined the Journal of the last day's pro-
 ceedings and announces to the House
 his approval thereof.
 Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
 nal stands approved.
 RABBI DOV EDELSTEIN
 (Mr. ROTH asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute.)
 Mr. ROTH. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-
 ored today to be able to recognize Rabbi
 Dov Edelstein, who delivered our open-
 ing prayer this morning.
 Rabbi Edelstein has served for 9 years
 at the Moses Monteflore Synagogue in
 my hometown-Appleton, Wis. He is
 well known in Appleton as an exemplary
 citizen with an outstanding reputation
 for community service.
 The Rabbi is a native of Romania, and
 was ordained to the rabbinate in Hun-
 gary in 1944. He is also a former inmate
 of the Nazi concentration camp at
 Auschwitz. Following the war, he was
 one of the 50,000 Jews interned by the
 British in camps on Cyprus prior to the
 establishment of the State of Israel.
 From 1947 to 1962, he lived in Israel
 and taught Hebrew at several institu-
 tions and also taught the language to
 immigrants. In 1962 he entered the
 United States and settled in Weirton,
 THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 1979
 W. Va., the sight of his first congrega-
 tion, coming from there to Appleton 9
 years ago.
 Rabbi Edelstein holds a graduate de-
 gree in American history and is the
 author of a major study of the relation-
 ship of the Wisconsin press toward
 President Abraham Lincoln during the
 Civil War.
 It is certainly a pleasure and an honor
 to welcome him here today.
 OVERSIGHT HEARINGS INTO OCCU-
 PATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
 OF THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEE TO
 COMMENCE
 (Mr. GAYDOS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. GAYDOS. Mr. Speaker, I wish to
 announce that the Subcommittee on
 Health and Safety, on which I have the
 honor to serve as chairman, will conduct
 a series of oversight hearings into the
 occupational safety and health of the
 Federal employee. The purpose of these
 hearings will be to determine whether
 or not the existing law properly protects
 the health and safety of Federal em-
 ployees.
 The first 2 days of public hearings will
 be on March 14, 1979, at which time
 representatives of the Department of Ag-
 riculture will testify, and March 28,
 1979. at which time representatives of
 the Department of the Interior have
 been invited to appear before this sub-
 committee.
 There will be  additional hearings
 scheduled. at which time representa-
 tives of other Federal agencies will be in-
 vited, as well as representatives of em-
 plovee organizations and members of the
 public.

 INTRODUCTION OF BILL TO PRO-
 VIDE FOOD STAMP BENEFITS FOR
 SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE DIS-
 ABLED
 (Mr. PEYSER asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. PEYSER. Mr. Speaker, I want to
 take this opportunity of thanking my
 colleagues, Republicans and Democrats
 alike, for the courtesy and support they
 have given to my efforts to introduce a
 bill aimed at helping our senior citizens
 and disabled people who have lost so
 much of their food stamp benefits.
 Mr. Speaker, today I will be submit-
 ting a bill with 105 cosponsors, and I
 think it is going to have a real impres-
 sion on the Committee on Agriculture.
 It is my hope that the subcommittee that
 handles this matter will bring-this bill
 out promptly. If other Members are
 anxious to join in cosponsorship of this
 bill as well, we will certainly be willing
 to add their names to the list.
 FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY
 (Mrs. HOLT asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend her re-
 marks.)
 Mrs. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, imagine try-
 ing to build a house without any concept
 of the size or cost. You just keep build-
 ing, adding features that you like.
 That  describes  the  congressional
 budget process in its current form. We
 spend many hours haggling over how
 much to provide for this and that pro-
 gram or activity, then conclude by add-
 ing everything and calling it a budget.
 During the last session of Congress,
 some of us attempted to change this sys-
 tem. On a couple of notable occasions,
 we even forced the House to vote on
 budget totals before debating the vari-
 ous specific items and issues. We were
 demanding that Congress establish fiscal
 policy before debating how much to
 spend on each of the many functions.
 But the House leadership has decided
 to prevent any such activity in this term.
 It persuaded a majority to adopt a rule
 that prohibits decisions on fiscal policy
 before we act on all the functions.  -
 We cannot all ow the current system to
 continue if we want the discipline re-
 quired to move. us toward a balanced
 budget, less inflation, and lower taxes.
 I have introduced H.R. 55, providing
 for a two-step budget process which
 would require us to vote on aggregate
 policy before we make individual spend-
 ing decisions.
 This is the prudent and rational way
 to proceed. This is the mechanism for
 reaching the fiscal responsibility the
 public is demanding. I urge you to co-
 sponsor H.R. 55.
 THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON
 TAIWAN
 (Mr. PAUL asked and was given per-
 mission to.address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, with many of
 my constituents, who have made their
 outrage known to me through letters and
 telegrams, r wish to protest the shabby
 treatment President Carter continues to
 give to our - old ally and good trading

 in the Western Pacific, and to maintain
 a friendly commercial and cultural rela-
 tionship, as well as other relationships,
 between the United States and Taiwan.
 May I call attention to principle 4,
 which is found on page 2, line 21 of the
 bill. Principle 4 states that Taiwan's
 future must be determined  through
 peaceful means without prejudice to the
 well-being of the people on Taiwan.
 The next principle, principle 5, is just
 as important. This principle 5 states that
 any armed attack against Taiwan, or
 use of force, boycott, or embargo to pre-
 vent Taiwan from engaging in trade with
 other nations, would be a threat to the
 peace and stability of the Western
 Pacific area and of grave concern to the
 United States.
 Mr. Chairman, title I, which follows,
 spells out how and what we will do to
 carry out the policies spelled out in sec-
 tion 2. We will continue to provide de-
 fense articles and services to Taiwan for
 its defense against armed attack, and if
 any danger to the U.S. interests arise
 through any threat to Taiwan's security,
 the United States will take appropriate
 action.
 With this combination of provisions, I
 submit that we have provided strong as-
 surances for Taiwan's future. We are
 making it absolutely plain that we will
 not tolerate any armed attack or use of
 force against Taiwan.
 Certainly we cannot precisely say in

 Hon. AL ULLMAN,
 Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,
 U.S. House of Representatives, Washing-
 ton, D.C.
 DEAR AL: Thank you for your letter con-
 cerning H.R. 2479, the United States-Taiwan
 Relations Act.
 We on the Foreign Affairs Committee are
 very appreciative of the advice and assistance
 rendered to us by your staff, and by the
 staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation,
 following my February 22 letter to you con-
 cerning this legislation. We were pleased
 to accept their suggestions in toto includ-
 ing a provision which we approved in H.R.
 2479 and language in the report on the
 bill.
 In regard to the Tariff Schedules of the
 United States, I am glad to confirm that
 your  understanding  and  assumption  are
 correct: namely, that H.R. 2479 does not
 amend or change in any way the Tariff
 Schedules of the United States which were
 in effect immediately prior to the changed
 status of Taiwan. Section 201(b)(1) of H.R.
 2479 states that the absence of diplomatic
 relations and governmental recognition with
 respect to Taiwan "shall not affect the ap-
 plication of the laws of the United States
 with respect to Taiwan" and that U.S. laws
 "shall apply with respect to Taiwan in the
 manner that the laws of the United States
 applied with respect to Taiwan prior to
 January 1, 1979." Section 205(l)  defines
 "laws of the United States" as including
 any  statute,  rule,  regulation, ordinance,
 order, or judicial rule of decision of the
 United States. . ." Thus H.R. 2479 clearly
 does not amend or change the Tariff Sched-
 ules, and you may assure Members of Your
 Committee that nothing in this legislation
 either explicitly or by inference would au-
 thorize the President unilaterally to change
 any of the tariff and trade relationships pro-
 vided under statute immediately prior to
 the changed status of Taiwan. Indeed, a
 major function of this bill is to assure that

 section in the legislation dealing with
 definitions. The bill before us repeatedly
 takes into account the need for main-
 taining without change the legal, as dis-
 tinguished from diplomatic, framework
 within which the private sector operates
 and which covers the major area of daily
 dealings with Taiwan.
 El 1140
 The bill in the other body is silent in
 this respect. The bill before us provides
 clearly that the employees of the U.S.
 entity in Taiwan will have all of the con-
 sular type authorities so that they will
 be able to assist and protect U.S. citizens,
 aid in promoting commerce, and so forth,
 just as consular officers in countries with
 whom we have diplomatic relations.
 The House Foreign Affairs Committee
 bill specifically includes boycott and em-?
 bargo actions against Taiwan, as matters
 which would be of grave concern to the
 United States. In this respect, H.R. 2479
 also differ with the legislation reported
 out of the committee of the other body
 for consideration by that body.
 Mr. Chairman, finally the bill before
 us includes the Embassy in Washington
 among the Republic of China property
 which would continue to be in Taiwan
 hands: The bill in the. other body does
 not include this provision.
 Again, Mr. Chairman, I submit this is
 a well-thought-out bill. The committee

 o
 e
 ministration had consulted wit
 gress before-during the normalization
 arrangement-we may have been able to
 better insure the way in which United
 States-Taiwan relations would eventually
 be conducted. Nevertheless, with the
 legislation we have before us today, the
 committee has in several significant ways
 improved upon the administration's posi-
 tion concerning our relations with Tai-
 wan.
 I believe that this legislation strength-
 ens the administration's bill-which did
 not sufficiently address the broader con-
 cern for the peace and security of Tai-
 wan.  In  particular,  the  Broomfield
 amendment, which received broad 'bi-
 partisan support in the committee, im-
 proves the administration's legislative
 provisions concerning threats to the se-
 curity of Taiwan, stating that beyond an
 armed attack, any economic boycott or
 embargo to prevent Taiwan from engag-
 ing in trade with other nations would also
 be a threat to the security of Taiwan.
 Moreover, title I of the legislation re-
 quires the President to promptly inform
 the Congress of anticipated dangers to
 Taiwan. In this regard, it is the commit-
 tee's intent that the President should in-
 form the Congress of anticipated dangers
 and should not await their actual occur-
 rence. Information relevant to the provi-
 sions of this bill would include the de-
 velopment of a military capability that
 might threaten Taiwan, deployment of
 armed forces in positions that could
 threaten Taiwan and any perceived in-

 the jurisdiction of this Committee.
 Under section 203 of the bill, any employee
 of a Federal agency may be separated from
 Government service for a specified period, for
 the purpose of accepting employment with
 the nongovernmental entity established un-
 der the bill to conduct dealings of the United
 States Government with Taiwan. An em-
 ployee who is so separated is entitled to be
 reemployed by his former agency in an ap-
 propriate position without loss of rights or
 benefits. While employed with the new en-
 tity, the employee may continue to partici-
 pate in any employee benefit program, such
 as retirement, life insurance and health in-
 surance programs, but only tq the extent
 that the appropriate employee and employer
 contributions to the programs are made.
 As you pointed out in your letter, our
 Committee could request the Speaker'to se-
 quentially refer H.R. 2479 to this Committee
 for the purpose of considering those provi-
 sions which pertain to matters under our
 jurisdiction. However, I understand that ex-
 peditious consideration of this legislation is
 necessary to ensure uninterrupted relations
 between the United States and Taiwan and
 that consideration of the measure by the
 House has been scheduled for next week. In
 view of these facts, our Committee will in-
 terpose no objection to consideration of H.R.
 2479, provided that such action is not con-
 strued as relinquishment of jurisdiction over
 the employees to whom section 200 of the
 bill applies.
 I would appreciate the inclusion of this
 letter in your Committee's report on H.R.
 2479.
 With kind regards.
 Sincerely,
 JAMES M. HANLEY, Chairman.
 This legislation, as I said at the very
 beginning, is very, very necessary. I have
 also been asked: What is the difference
 between the bill that is before us and the
 legislation that is being considered in the
 other body?
 Let me at the very outset say, without
 assuming to be too.immodest, that the
 bill we present to the Members is struc-
 tured better. The bill that we present to
 the Members has the policy statement
 relating to the security of the United
 States and of Taiwan at the very begin-
 ning,. and it is clearly spelled out. In the

 amendment in the committee saying that
 these threats would be to the "security
 interests" of the United States but a ma-
 jority of the committee decided that this
 would actually be of "grave concern,"
 which to me is a convenient way to duck
 the issue. Everything seems to be of
 "grave concern" to us these days. We
 should not hesitate to state our strong -
 interests in continuing to trade with
 Taiwan. It is definitely in the "security
 interests" of the United States to main-
 tain that trade, to say nothing of the
 physical security of the island.
 In connection with this, I would like
 to add my voice to those advocatiing con-
 tinued arms sale to Taiwan. I was dis-
 j.ressed to learn that the President is
 .hesitating to permit, sales of sophisti-
 cated defense equipment to the Republic
 of China, such as all-weather fighter air-
 craft, to say nothing of the belated an-
 nouncement of a 1-year moratorium on
 arms sales. Maybe President Carter is
 concerned that the people on Taiwan will
 actually attempt an invasion of the main-
 land. Maybe he believes that arms sales
 would offend the People's Republic of
 China.
 In either case, I think it is important
 for Congress to signal its concern that
 appropriate arms sales continue. If Presi-
 dent Carter is going to abrogate the de-
 fense treaty with Taiwan, the least we
 can do Is sell arms to the willing buyers
 on Taiwan.
 Another concern that I expressed in
 the committee hearings involves the Re-
 public of China Embassy. As you know.
 the bill currently recognizes continued
 ROC ownership of the' Twin Oaks Em-
 bassy in Washington. This is an essen-
 tial provision for two reasons:
 First, it is a clear signal to the Re-
 public' of China that they still have
 friends in the United States. At the very
 least,. the ROC officials should be per-
 mitted to stay in the building they have
 occupied for the last 30 years.
 Second, the provision represents Con-
 gress' views that there is absolutely no
 continuity between the policies of the
 People's Republic of China and the Re-
 public of China. If the People's Republic
 of China were to occupy a building that
 had been used by the Republic of China
 a few months earlier, some people might
 think that this is just a continuation of
 ..relations, which it is not.
 This provision of the bill provides
 Congress with the opportunity to reject
 the abandonment of Taiwan ; I certain-
 ly hope we take advantage of it.
 Finally, I would like to make a com-
 ment for the record which concerns Sen-
 ator. GOLDWATER'S  lawsuit  against  the
 President. I want observers to under-
 stand that in my view none of this de-
 bate should be construed as congres-
 sional approval of the President's uni-
 lateral abrogation of the Taiwan De-
 fense Treaty. It is simply action which
 is devoted to dealing with the reality of
 establishing new channels to communi-
 cate with the Republic of China.

 Mr. ZABLOCKI.  Mr. Chairman, I
 yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
 North Carolina (Mr. ROSE).
 D - HO U51E                  1HI 1153
 (Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. ROSE. Mr. Chairman, I would like
 to ask the chairman of the Committee on
 Foreign Affairs, the gentleman from
 Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI), a question
 concerning an important institution ' in
 Taiwan. Is the gentleman familiar with
 the Taipei American School in Taiwan?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ROSE. I yield to the gentleman
 from Wisconsin.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Yes, I am, Mr. Chair-
 man. I am very impressed with that par-
 ticular school and with some of the
 other schools we have throughout the
 world.
 Mr. ROSE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the
 gentleman for that comment.
 I have a concern over the future of
 this school-which I would like to share
 -with my colleagues. If we agree to estab-
 lish the American Institute in Taiwan
 to handle American interests on that is-
 land, I would hope that we would also be
 asserting that we intend for the Insti-
 tute to continue to support the Taipei
 American School as well.
 This school, which has been operating
 on Taiwan for over 25 years, has served
 as a leader in Asian American schools.
 The staff and students have enjoyed an
 innovative curriculum anti cultural ex-
 change program which have served to
 enhance our mutual relations with the
 people of Taiwan.
 In addition, Mr. Chairman, this school
 has served the children of American mis-
 sionaries, American technicians, Amer-
 ican corporations, and diplomatic per-
 sonnel.
 I will insert in the RECORD at this point
 a partial list of the corporations and
 foundations which operate in Taiwan,
 as well as a brief description of the
 school. The material is as follows:
 Taipei American School Is a private school
 founded in 1949 by parents seeking an Amer-
 ican-style education for their children. From
 humble beginnings in a rented room with 8
 students and one teacher, TAS has expanded
 to its present 20.6 acre campus located in
 the north Taipei suburb of Shihlin.
 The school is owned by the parents and
 governed by an elected nine member Board
 of Directors. The elementary school encom-
 passes Early Childhood Education through
 grade 6 and the secondary school Includes
 grades 7-12.
 Broad goals for TAB established by a com-
 munity committee place emphasis on basic
 skills,  desire to learn, self-understanding,
 and appreciation of others.
 Basic skills in language and math are
 stressed throughout the program. The ele-
 mentary school uses the Ginn 360 reading
 series, the Laidlaw language arts series, and
 the Scott-Freeman mathematics series. The
 secondary program is basically college pre-
 paratory. Secondary students are required to
 take four years of English. Two years of math
 are required in grades 7-12 with pre-algebra
 through trigonometry courses offered. A pro-
 gram in English as a 'Second Language is
 available at all grade levels to increase Eng-
 lish  proficiency  for  non-native  English-
 speaking students.
 TAB seeks to foster a desire to learn. Ele-
 mentary students participate in enrichment
 courses in art, music,  library, P.E., and
 Chinese culture taught by specialists. Four
 resource teachers augment the instructional
 program by working with classroom teachers
 in developing alternatives for extended learn-
 ing. The Science Resource Teacher has a
 complete science laboratory. Other resource
 teachers specialize in learning skills and ESL.
 No program is available for special education
 or for assistance with serious learning dis-
 abilities.
 The secondary school augments the regu-
 lar program with electives such as humani-
 ties, Instrumental and vocal music, wood-
 shop, mechanics, photography, and jewelry.
 Students may study French, Spanish, Chi-
 nese, and German in the Foreign Language
 program. Many extra-curricular activities en-
 courage participation with over 25 clubs and
 organizations available on campus as well as
 numerous competitive sports programs.
 An integral part of the program is the de-
 velopment of self-understanding, self-disci-
 pline, and self-respect. Each teacher strives
 to effect these goals by creating a 'positive
 classroom environment. A complete counsel-
 ing program complements this effort at all
 levels  with  special  services  available  in
 speech and testing.
 Taipei American School also offers a chance
 for students to profit from their stay in a
 foreign country through a study of Chinese
 language?and culture. Asian studies are re-
 quired for elementary students and elective
 for secondary students. Cultural activities
 incorporate numerous field trips and visits
 from local artists and craftsmen.

 s-with the
 People's Republic of China. In the last
 few days we have been informed by the
 international press that Red China has
 canceled abruptly without warning $2 %2
 billion worth of contracts that it has
 made with Japan, and yet we are told
 they are a potentially reliable trading
 partner.
 And, what is to happen when cheaply
 made products produced by slave labor in
 Red China flood our markets and jeopar-
 dize American jobs?
 No, for the foreseeable future, no-great
 economic boom will occur in the United
 States due to Red China trade.
 What the President has done is not to
 insure the independence of the Repub-
 lic of China on Taiwan, but to assure its
 eventual destruction at the hands of
 Red China. The President chose not to
 recognize the reality of two Chinas but
 in effect he changed sides in the conflict
 between these two nations. In this in-
 stance he changed sides in the conflict
 between freedom and communism. And
 in so doing he has. created new tension
 in Asia and undermined the credibility
 of the United States and its commitment
 to freedom everywhere in the world.
 And now Congress is left to "pick up
 the pieces." You do not have to accept
 that characterization from the  entl
 ferring to the "liberation" of Taiwan, but
 would instead call for the "reunification" of
 China.
 Those, Members of Congress, are the
 substantive concessions that moved this
 thing from the back burner last Novem-
 ber. I leave you with this question, what
 have we gained? I think the answer will
 be that we have not gained, but perhaps
 in the eyes of the world we have lost.

 distinguished chairman of the Judiciary
 Committee for bringing up this issue.
 Certainly, I can assure the'chairman and
 the gentlewoman from New York of the
 intent of the Committee on Foreign Af-

 trespass on the jurisdiction of the Judi-
 ciary Committee on these matters of
 immigration.

 members of the Committee on Foreign
 Affairs when I say that we welcome the
 oversight of the gentleman's committee
 and review of the various immigration-
 related matters and provisions of this
 bill once they have been enacted into
 law. The Committee on Foreign Affairs,
 of course, will be exercising oversight
 jurisdiction and review of all provisions
 of the law within the jurisdiction of the
 Committee on Foreign Affairs. However,
 I can assure the gentleman from New
 Jersey (Mr. RODINO), the chairman of
 the Committee on the Judiciary, that it
 is not our intent to impinge on that com-
 mittee's jurisdiction.

 THE TREATY STAKES
 In the coming showdown in the federal
 courts between President Carter and Sen.
 Barry Goldwater on the legality of the pres-
 ident's unilateral abrogation of the Taiwan
 defense treaty, both sides marshal historical
 precedents and opinions of learned authori-
 ties in support of their positions. Neither can
 cite legal precedents, however, because no
 court has ever ruled on the question of a
 president's power to break a treaty without
 securing approval of the Senate or both
 houses of Congress..
 All of which means the Taiwan cases
 should prove to be intensely interesting, as
 well as highly significant.
 The White House press office has distrib-
 uted a "fact sheet" that lists several examples
 of presidential termination of treaties. The
 sheet also notes that Article 10 of the 1955
 Taiwan treaty states that: "Either party may
 terminate it one year after notice has been
 given to the other party."
 Contending that President Carter acted
 properly because he issued the one-year
 notice, the White House observed that: "The
 treaty makes no reference to the Senate or
 Congress, or the need for approval of the
 legislative branch in order for notice to be
 given of termination of the treaty."
 In a study he prepared for the Heritage
 Foundation last spring, Mr. Goldwater noted,
 however, that neither does the treaty say
 the president is the sole "party" to act on
 behalf of this country. "Party" means the
 government involved, and in the U.S. the
 treaty power is a joint one shared by the
 president and Congress, wrote the Arizona
 Republican,  his party's  1964 presidential
 nominee.
 Furthermore, in examining nine instances
 of presidents serving  termination notice
 without securing congressional approval, Mr.
 Goldwater argued that a closer examination
 of the record does not support the idea of
 untrammeled presidential ability to annul
 treaties. In two cases, notice of termination
 was withdrawn. Two treaties were scrapped
 because they were inconsistent with more

 recent laws passed by Congress and one was
 obviously superseded by obligations imposed
 by a later treaty. The remaining four, accord-
 ing to the Goldwater analysis, "appear to
 have been annulled or suspended after it
 became impossible to effectively carry them
 out."
 Yet those cases were cited, without fur-
 ther explanation, by Mr. Carter's press agents
 as justification for the president breaking a
 treaty of his choosing. For  example,  the
 White House noted that in 1939, President
 Roosevelt gave notice of termination of a
 1911 commerce and navigation treaty with
 Japan. But after examining that case more
 closely. Senator Goldwater pointed out that
 it was "persuasively argued in the Senate
 that the president was compelled to de-
 nounce the 1911 treaty with Japan because
 of our obligataions under a later treaty, the
 Nine  Power  Agreement,  committing  the
 United States to respect the territorial in-
 tegrity of China."
 It must be conceded that the White House
 was able to muster an impressive display of
 quotes from various scholars to the effect
 that a president may break a treaty unilater-
 ally.
 Mr. Goldwater, however, was not without
 some lustrous support of his own. Thomas
 Jefferson, in compiling the first manual of
 rules of the Senate when he was vice presi-
 dent, wrote: "Treaties being declared equally
 with the laws of the United Stataes, to be
 the Supreme Law of the Land, it is under-
 stood that an act of the legislature alone can
 declare them infringed or rescinded."
 The president has overall authority to con-
 duct this nation's affairs with other nations,
 of course, and that includes the right, un-
 disputed by Mr. Goldwater, to establish or
 end diplomatic relations with others. The
 courts may well rule that Mr. Carter was
 within his constitutional prerogative in serv-
 ing notice on Taiwan. What then?
 Practically every major treaty to which
 the U.S. is a party has an abrogation clause
 similar to the Taiwan one. These include the'
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
 and security treaties with Australia and New
 Zealand (ANZUS), South Korea, Japan, the
 Philippines, and non-communist Southeast
 Asian countries (SEATO). If the courts up-
 hold a presidential right to break such
 treaties without the restraint of legislative
 concurrence,  then the credibility of the
 United States as a stable, dependable ally
 will be thrown into greater doubt.
 Then, too, some liberals who delight to-
 day in Mr. Carter's fast China shuffle could
 some day rue a future president having a free
 hand. Senator Goldwater said he feared no
 contradiction in predicting an uproar among
 his  colleagues  if,  for  example,  president,
 without giving the Senate or Congress oppor-
 tunity for deliberation, unilaterally violated

 nuclear warheads to South Africa.

 Mr. KRAMER. Mr.-Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. GILMAN. I yield to the gentleman
 from Colorado.
 (Mr. KRAMER asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. KRAMER. Mr. Chairman, today,
 as we debate the merits of this bill-the
 United States-Taiwan Relations Act-
 marks an important occasion in the mod-
 ern history of our Nation. It is a date
 on which both the honor and credibility
 of the United States will be tested, before
 friend and foe alike. It is a date on which
 we as a Nation will either demonstrate,
 or fail to demonstrate, the moral fiber
 and firm resolve which must characterize
 a truly great Nation.
 I wish'that this were not so. I wish
 that we in the Congress were not faced
 with the difficult and complex situation
 which now challenges and confronts us.
 But hard fact is that we are. And the re-
 sponsibility for this I would lay directly
 at the doorstep of this administration-
 for in its negotiations with the People's
 Republic of China the White House has
 seriously compromised the future secur-
 ity and well-being of our friends and
 allies on Taiwan, and with them has
 compromised the interests of the United
 States itself.
 It is no exaggeration to say, I think,
 that in this deal with the People's Re-
 public our Government "gave all and
 got nothing". We completely acceded to
 all three of Peking's. principal conditions
 for the establishment of full diplomatic
 relations. Our troops have been with-
 drawn from Taiwan, notice has been
 given for the cancellation of our mutual
 security treaty with that country, and
 normal diplomatic relations have been
 totally severed.
 In return we have received nothing but
 the unilateral right to declare that we
 will still sell 'arms to Taiwan, the right
 to use a circuitous fiction for what should
 normally be a close and friendly rela-
 tionship with Taiwan, and the right to
 cut off Taiwan from its American secur-
 ity umbrella later than sooner.
 I would hardly count these so-called
 "concessions   as  major  -diplomatic
 achievements. On top of this, we have
 failed to wring from Peking even the
 faintest pledge that they will not use
 force to bring Taiwan under their po-
 litical sway. Consistently, in this coun-
 try and at home, Vice-Premier Teng has
 resisted our suggestions that he give such
 a pledge. To be so firm in his position is,
 of course, the Vice-Premier's political
 right. What I have to ask, however, is
 why our Government should have been
 so weak in asserting our own national
 rights and those of our allies. This, my
 friends, hag proven a pathetic display of
 American political ineptitude.
 This point is borne home all the more
 clearly by the fact that no sooner had
 Vice-Premier Teng returned to his coun-
 try than Peking launched its military
 invasion of Vietnam. Obviously, our sac-
 rifice of Taiwan has bought us precious
 little influence with our new Chinese
 "friends." On the other hand, China has
 succeeded in achieving normalization
 and placing the United States at its back
 before embarking on this new military
 adventure.
 Not only this, but our Government is
 still proceeding with plans to open wide
 the doors of American trade' and aid to
 Peking, even as the warfare in Vietnam
 continues.
 It is not the establishment of full dip-
 lomatic relations with Peking that I
 challenge. This was desirable and per-
 haps inevitable. What I question is the
 terms on which this normalization was
 achieved.
 I firmly believe, and have been advised
 by persons knowledgeable in the field,
 that had the United States exhibited
 some  political  will  in  its  negotia-
 tions with Peking, we could probably
 have gained the clear right to a diplo-
 matic liaison office in Taiwan. This
 seems even clearer in retrospect, given
 China's need for a neutralized United
 States in its worsening conflicts with
 Hanoi and Moscow, and its equally great
 need for American technology and re-
 sources to aid its ambitious moderniza-
 tion program.
 All   things   considered-American
 trade, technology, and military support,
 and Taiwan itself for good measure-
 this action by our President may yet
 prove the biggest give-away of them all.
 Obviously today we must look forward
 rather than back. What we are consider-
 ing now is the future of our relationship
 with the Republic of China on Taiwan,
 and indeed the very future of that island
 republic itself. It seems to me that the
 bill which the White House originally
 sent to this Congress was totally inade-
 quate to provide for either.
 The bill now before us is a considerable
 improvement over that earlier version,
 but is still deficient, I believe, in a num-
 ber of areas. A nonofficial, privy%e cor-
 poration is, I believe, an inadequate ve-
 hicle for the conduct of our relations
 with Taiwan, our eighth-largest trading
 partner and a nation of some 17 million
 souls. In particular, in the absence of any
 official government-to-government rela-
 tions the United States will lack any
 valid legal foundation which would per-
 mit it to come to Taiwan's aid in the
 event of political, economic, or military
 coercion by the PRC.
 Cut adrift from' the mainstream of
 normal diplomatic intercourse, Taiwan
 will in the absence of some form of gov-
 ernment-to-government relations be left
 to drift alone on the political periphery,
 until it sooner or later is carried onto
 the shoals of political or military vulner-
 ability. Should that happen, we in the
 United States, a longtime friend and ally
 of Taiwan, will have already unilaterally
 cut that one rope-governmental rela-
 tions-which could remedy that situa-
 tion.
 We will, in other words, have not only
 abrogated a security treaty, but also a
 solemn relationship with a friendly peo-
 ple, built through years of mutual effort,
 cooperation, and a shared vision. This,
 my friends, is not a moral position
 worthy of a great nation.
 If we should allow this to happen, I
 can only wonder at the impressions of
 our allies, as well. Israel, the nations of
 NATO, Korea-despite the bland and
 encouraging statements emanating from
 the State Department on the subject, I
 can only wonder whether privately the
 leaders of those nations must have shud-
 dered on hearing of this government's
 plan for its former Chinese ally.
 They too must be wondering and
 watching to see whether they them-
 selves might be next in line for the junk-
 heap of nations whose friendship and
 ties with the United States had become
 too inconvenient to either defend or ac-
 knowledge.
 This bill, my friends, is an unfortunate
 event. We can, however, make it better-
 in ways which will help to reassure our
 friends in Taiwan of our continuing sup-
 port and interest; our allies around the
 world of the firmness and value of

 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I
 yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
 Ohio (Mr. ASHBROOK).
 (Mr. ASHBROOK asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, the
 report on H.R. 2479 from the Committee
 on Foreign Affairs expressed a sense of
 urgency about this legislation. Phone
 calls to our offices from the State De-
 partment and the administration have
 echoed this urgency. In fact, I am find-
 ing that there are many here in Wash-
 ington who would like to see this Con-
 gress pass H.R. 2479 as soon as pos-
 sible "to facilitate action on this im-
 portant legislation which is urgently re-
 quired to insure uninterrupted relations
 between the United States and Taiwan."
 My view of this pressure is that it is
 not so much a sense of urgency to bolster
 our commitment to a loyal ally as it is
 an attempt to ram a "bill of goods"
 through the Congress before the Ameri-
 can people awaken to what a shambles
 this administration has made. of one of
 the closest and strongest relationships
 this Nation has ever had with another
 country. If we fall for this ploy we
 will have made official a disasterous set
 of policies that should never have seen
 the light of day.
 If the President was so concerned over
 having congressional action to help
 ease the transition to a new policy to-
 ward the Republic of China why did he
 announce his new policy, and begin to
 implement it when a lame duck Con-
 gress was adjourned? Why did he not
 attempt to adequately consult the Con-
 gressional leadership, of both parties,
 prior to his announcement? Why did he
 not wait until the Congress had acted-
 before he wined and dined the Commu-
 nist Chinese in our Capital and had gone
 ahead with appointing an Ambassador?
 His December announcement of the sell-
 out of a brave ally was not an act of cour-
 age or principle. It was a snide attack.
 sideration of what we are doing to a loyal
 ally and to our own position in the world.
 I wish to turn now to the bill that is
 before us. H.R. 2479 is a bill that so fun-
 damentally alters our course in our rela-
 tions with another nation that we should
 not leave any portion of this bill open
 to interpretation. We should make our
 mandate clear and precise. H.R. 2479, as
 presently reported fails to meet this crit-
 ical need. What, for example, does the
 term "Western Pacific" mean? This bill
 says:
 The people on Taiwan, as well as the peo-
 ple on the China mainland and all other peo-
 ples of the Western Pacific area.
 to break and he is shouting at us to go
 out there with him. He is hoping that
 with more people out on that limb the
 less foolish his initial act will look. We
 have a duty to the American people to
 not take any action that might encourage
 the President to seek more limbs. One of
 these times a limb-will break and all of
 us will go crashing down with it.
 Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the
 distinguished chairman of the commit-
 tee some basic questions because I think,
 in order to understand the legislation and
 what we are doing here, we have to start
 at the very beginning. I would like to ask
 one specific question:
 Is the legislation, H.R. 2479, predi-
 cated on the fact that the Republic of
 China is a sovereign nation, or is it
 predicated on the allegation of the Carter
 administration that it is not a sovereign
 nation?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I will be glad to yield
 to the chairman of the committee.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, as the
 gentleman fully knows, the legislation is
 predicated on the basis that our Govern-
 ment does not at the present time recog-
 nize the Republic of China, Taiwan,
 diplomatically, Nevertheless, it is the
 desire and the intention of our Govern-
 ment and certainly the wish of the people
 of the United States to continue rela-
 tions with the people on Taiwan as we
 would with countries with which we do
 have diplomatic relations. This is the
 purpose of the legislation.
 ^ 1235
 What does this term mean? Are we in-
 cluding all mainland China areas in the
 phrase? Are we including North Korea?
 Vietnam? Why are we diluting the bill's
 focus so much? If we are to address our
 future relations with the Republic of
 China let us address that issue and leave
 regional concerns to another bill. The
 present  legislation  is  far  reaching
 enough without bringing all of Asia or
 the Pacific in on it.
 Another example is the central subject
 of the bill, the Republic of China. The
 bill does snot even use its proper name!
 Even if we decide to not recognize their
 government officially we do not have the
 right to rename their nation for them.
 We call our enemies by their rightful
 names (U.S.S.R., Libya, People's Repub-
 lic of China, Uganda, et cetera) why can't
 we extend the same courtesy to one of
 our most faithful friends? A more subtle
 point that should be made is that every
 time we decline to recognize that there
 still exists a sovereign nation known as
 the Republic of China we are setting the
 stage for our Republic's further decline
 in the eyes of the world. It is sheer hy-
 pocrisy. This point has not been lost on
 the sell-out artists of the administration,
 and we should be ever alert for their
 clever ploys.
 The vagueness that permeates this bill
 gives way to pure fantasy and charade in
 regard to the "designated entity." This
 is an agency formed at the direction of
 the State Department, it will be staffed
 by its own employees, it will be funded
 by our tax dollars, and it will be under
 this Congress_ oversight. It is an organ
 of our Government and should be iden-
 tified as such. I would prefer that we
 have a diplomatic liaison office to conduct
 our relations, and I think we will have

 Mr. ASHBROOK. I thank my colleague
 for an honest and direct answer, as he
 always gives to any question, no matter
 how hard.
 I think we start to see, then-and I will
 ask several other questions-some of the
 problems that are opened up by this.
 From my point of view, a fact of life is
 that the Republic of China is a sovereign
 nation. Let us take immigration. I noted
 with interest the response the Chairman
 gave to our subcommittee chairman, the
 gentlewoman  from  New  York  (Ms.
 HOLTZMAN),  and our chairman,  Mr.
 RODINO.
 Let me pose a question: If the Republic
 of China is not a sovereign nation, what
 if the People's Republic of China would
 issue an edict saying the passports must
 be stamped in Peking, including, in their
 terminology, not mine, the province of
 Taiwan? What then would be the posi-
 tion of this Government? Would the
 State Department say "Well, that is an
 internal problem within China, we have
 nothing to say about that?" Would that
 be the position if indeed the Republic of
 China is not a government? If we recog-
 nize the People's Republic of China as
 the government of all China, what if they
 were to say, on immigration, "All pass-
 ports must be stamped in Peking?" What
 would be the response of the chairman?

 Regarding this language, I should like
 to stress that any effort on our part to
 encourage greater freedom and self-
 representation on Taiwan does not nec-
 essarily conflict with the administra-
 tion's recent commitments to the PRC.
 On several occasions, Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping has expressed his willingness
 to accept Taiwan's own social and eco-
 nomic system as well as armed forces.
 But whatever steps are taken to resolve
 the international status of Taiwan it
 should be understood by all sides that
 the future of the Taiwanese people ought
 to be decided by those representing the
 majority of the people on the island, not
 by a government unwilling to open. its
 doors to full popular participation.
 In addition, it would be my hope that
 in any legislation dealing with the legiti-
 mate security needs of the - Taiwanese
 people, a strong sense of the Congress
 should be established that the U.S. Gov-

 as riot control equipment, which are of
 a nature that appear primarily oriented
 to maintaining internal order as opposed
 .to external security.

 Vietnam, I firmly believe China desper-
 ately needs peace if it is to succeed in
 its unprecedented modernization pro-
 gram. This invasion in one sense can be
 seen as a preemptive strike to keep the
 Soviet Union at bay and buy time for
 China to pull itself up by the bootstraps.
 But there is no evidgnce that China is
 mobilizing itself for war against Tai-
 wan, or is about to launch a campaign
 of expansionism. There are too. many
 pressing problems, and too many unde-
 veloped acres, for that to occur, and I
 think responsible, rational Chinese lead-
 ers realize that-all too painfully.
 This bill is vital if we are to keep our
 pledge to maintain viable economic and
 cultural ties with Taiwan. This legisla-
 tion contains solid assurances for the
 continued security of Taiwan.
 But as we consider this legislation and
 amendments today, I hope my colleagues
 will remember that the world exists as
 it is, not as we wish it to be.
 Many wish there could be two Chinas.
 The fact is there is only one China, just
 as there is only one Chinese people,
 whether they live in Shanghai, Taipei
 or San Francisco. Being Chinese is a
 common heritage for an entire people,
 regardless where they live or under what
 government they exist. Theirs is a heri-
 tage that has survived dynastic collapse,
 foreign occupation, famine, floods, aber-
 rations of government policy such as the
 cultural revolution and the upheaval of
 civil war.
 As I left China, I carried with me a
 great respect for the Chinese people.
 Through the ages, they have achieved
 and maintained a high level of civiliza-
 tion. That civilization perseveres today,
 even though China is scrambling to
 escape from widespread poverty and
 underdevelopment. I am convinced that
 if any underdeveloped nation can break
 through and modernize, it is China,
 because its people are commited to that
 goal.           O 1255

 California (Mr. DANNEMEYER).
 (Mr. DANNEMEYER asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. DANNEMEYER. Mr. Chairman,
 the issue facing us today has an air of
 unreality about it. The Carter adminis-
 tration diplomatically recognized the
 regime on the mainland of China. One of
 the arguments by proponents of that
 move is that the United States is now rec-
 ognizing the reality of the existence of
 800 million people.
 Without arguing the merits or demerits
 of that position, let us look at the other
 side of the coin. The Carter administra-
 tion while recognizing the reality of the
 People's Republic of China is now deny-    treated shabbily at best. I Cheng-loh of

 in a hypocritical fashion. There is in ex-
 istence a Republic of China. It has a his-
 tory. It does govern 17 million people on
 Taiwan, the Pescadores, and the offshore
 islands. In other words, it is a country.
 At the minimum we should have some
 form of government-to-government rela-
 tions. That is why earlier this Congress I
 introduced legislation-H.R. 1925-which
 authorizes a U.S. liaison office to be insti-
 tuted in Taipei, Taiwan. But the Carter
 administration is caught up in its own
 fiction that the governmental entity of
 the Republic of China does not exist.
 This would be bad enough in itself, but,
 as we all know, there is more. The Carter
 administration is trying to build its for-
 eign policy in Asia on a further fiction.
 That fiction is that our longtime friend
 and ally the Republic of China on Taiwan
 does not have to worry about the Com-
 munist rulers on the mainland trying to
 invade, coerce, or extort the people of
 Taiwan. Supposedly, we all know that
 the People's Republic of China has no de-
 sire -to forcefully take over Taiwan.
 Unfortunately,  the leaders  of  the
 People's Republic of China do not quite
 go along with this fiction of the Carter
 administration. They have never ruled
 out force or any other means to take
 over Taiwan. Is it not nice how President
 Carter, his advisers, and the State De-
 partment are deciding for the people and
 Government of Taiwan what other coun-
 tries intensions are for them.
 Of course, one only has to look at re-
 cent history to see just how peaceful the
 have invaded Vietnam. In the 1960's they
 got into a border conflict with India. In
 the 1950's they crushed the Tibetan
 people-a people that they had promised
 autonomy to. In the early 1960's the In-
 ternational Commission of Jurists found
 that the Chinese Communists had com-
 mitted genocide against the Tibetan
 people. And of course, in the early 1950's
 there was the Korean war with the in-
 volvement of millions of troops from the
 supposedly peace-loving People's Repub-
 lic of China.
 In my opinion this is not much of a
 record for the leaders and people of Tai-
 wan to feel secure about. Additionally,
 the Carter administration has agreed not
 to make any-new sales of defensive weap-
 ons to Taiwan during 1979.
 The Republic of China on Taiwan is a
 growing economic power in Asia. The
 standard of living of the people has con-
 tinually improved. Compared to the
 mainland the people of Taiwan enjoy
 many freedoms and rights. President
 Carter's answer to all of this is to
 ignore it.
 President Carter has basically told the
 leaders and the people of the Republic of
 China "trust me." While asking for trust,
 the Government of Taiwan has been
 been no guarantee from the Carter ad-
 ministration of continued U.S. support
 for Republic of China membership in
 such important economic institutions as
 the International Monetary Fund or the
 World Bank. What type of defensive
 weapons will the Carter administration
 be willing to sell to Taiwan?
 It is our responsibility as Members of
 Congress to attempt to correct the in-
 justice that has been perpetrated by the
 Carter administration. The interests and
 basic principles of our own country
 demand no less.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I yield
 5 minutes to the gentleman from North
 Carolina (Mr. FOUNTAIN).
 Mr. FOUNTAIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
 in support of H.R. 2479, the United
 States-Taiwan Relations Act. As ranking
 majority member of the Foreign Affairs
 Committee, I was pleased to cosponsor
 this important legislation, and, with some
 reservations, to urge its adoption.
 Despite my support for the bill, how-
 ever, I believe its provisions can be re-
 sponsibly made stronger in several re-
 spects, and I hope my colleagues will
 give serious attention today to any
 amendments offered which will reaffirm
 our rightful commitment to peace and
 freedom on Taiwan-for example, to
 establish an official liaison office there.
 Mr. Chairman, this bill declares that
 peace and stability in the western Pa-
 cific-including China-are in our para-
 mount national interest, and that con-
 tinued relations of every type with Tai-
 wan are, as a result, essential. Any at-
 tack, against Taiwan would be-and
 ought to be-of grave concern to our
 country, and continued shipments of
 defensive arms to Taiwan as provided for
 in the bill are, therefore, necessary. In
 addition, the bill recognizes the respon-
 sibility to be shared by the President and
 the Congress to be prepared to take any
 additional appropriate action-military
 or otherwise-to resist serious threats to
 Taiwan's security.
 H.R. 2479 reaffirms the existence of all
 treaties and international agreements in
 effect between the United States and Tai-
 wan at the end of 1978 and provides that
 they will continue in force unless and
 until terminated under their own terms
 or otherwise in accordance with law. All
 U.S. laws and programs respecting Tai-
 wan will continue to apply as if derec-
 ognition had not taken place. Also,
 several administrative and technical pro-
 visions-both substantive and proce-
 dural-are included in the bill.
 Mr. Chairman, many of us in this
 House were, quite frankly, shocked and
 saddened by the President's decision
 last December to extend diplomatic rec-
 ognition to the PRC without first arriv-
 ing at a fair and responsible solution to
 the so-called Taiwan question. However,
 since former President Nixon's summit
 visit to mainland China in 1972 and the
 resulting Shanghai Communique, even-
 tual diplomatic recognition of the PRC
 has been by and large a foregone conclu-
 sion in most minds.
 Yet, that extension of recognition
 should not have occurred, as it did, at
 the total expenses of our longtime friends
 and allies-of more than 30 years'

 Mr. VANIK. Finally, as I understand
 it, the severing of diplomatic relations
 with Taiwan will in no way affect the
 treatment of Taiwan for tax purposes.
 Now this would mean, for example, that
 Americans working on Taiwan for the
 necessary period would qualify for the
 deductions for excess foreign living costs,
 and income taxes paid to Taiwan would
 qualify for the foreign tax credit if the
 other requirements of the code are met.
 Also, as is true with foreign govern-
 ments, the governing authority on Tai-
 wan, or its agencies or instrumentali-
 ties, would be exempt as long as the in-
 come does not inure to the benefit of any
 private individual and it is not derived
 from commercial activities. Now this is
 a point that I want to be very clear on-
 am I correct that there is no way that
 any private individual or company could
 ? use any provision of the bill to escape
 U.S. tax under present law.

 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. VANIK. I am happy to yield to
 the chairman.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I thank the gentle-
 man for yielding. This is definitely cor-
 rect. The exemption from U.S. tax which
 would be available to Taiwan would only
 extend to governmental activities, and it
 would not apply in any sense where the
 income was derived from commercial ac-
 tivities or the income inured directly
 or indirectly to private interests.
 Mr. VANIK. I want to thank the dis-
 tinguished chairman of the Foreign Af-
 fairs Committee for his responses to
 these inquiries.

 Mr. Chairman, on December 15, 1978,
 President Jimmy Carter dramatically
 announced that he was going to sever
 diplomatic relations with an old and

 Now, the Communist regime is engaged
 in a bitter and dangerous war with their
 ancient  enemies,   the  Vietnamese.

 fellow citizens-who are grathered here at
 Twin Oaks to take one more look at our na-
 tional flag before it is taken down. Your pres-
 ence gives us strength and confidence. Your
 presence speaks eloquently of the fact that
 in our fight for a just cause we are not
 alone.
 China and the United States exchanged
 ministers exactly a hundred years ago. Ever
 since 1912 when the Republic of China was
 brought into being, the first republic in
 Asia, our two countries have maintained
 close  and  cordial  diplomatic  relations.
 Throughout the long years, in war or in
 peace, I am not aware of a single occasion
 when the Republic of China did anything
 perfidious or wrong to the United States.
 Our people, known for their trustworthi-
 ness, honesty and loyalty, have always en-
 deavored to live up to the moral and ethical
 standards they set for themselves in their
 dealings with the people of the United States.
 It is therefore only natural that we feel dis-
 tressed when we realize that our national flag
 is not to be raised here at Twin Oaks after
 the end of this year, because President Car-
 ter has decided that on January 1st, 1979,
 the United States will terminate diplomatic
 relations with us the Republic of China-a
 loyal friend and ally of the United States,
 and establish relations with our enemy the
 Chinese Communist regime.
 Beginning tomorrow, relations between the
 Republic of China and the United States of
 America shall undergo changes. Surely, there
 will be modifications and readjustments. Al-
 though the names of our respective embas-
 sies in Taipei and Washington, D.C. shall go
 into limbo, yet our many-faceted realistic
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE          March 8, 1979
 of China will continue to strive for freedom
 and democracy and peace with justice-a
 just cause to which all of us who are gath-
 ered here have long dedicated ourselves.
 Dear friends and fellow citizens, we may
 be facing a long dark night. But as long as
 we can persevere and keep our chins up-
 and I am sure we can-we shall be able to
 come here again soon, with renewed convic-
 tion and dedication, to welcome a new dawn
 and a new era in the relations between the
 Republic of China and the United States of
 America.
 Before concluding, I should like to assure
 all of you that with conviction and confi-
 dence, we shall return! And we shall return
 with this same flag-the national flag of the
 Republic of China.

 March, 8, 1979            CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 The institute proposal has seriously
 disturbed and threatened the American
 business community concerned with Tai-
 wan who fear loss of markets, loss of in-
 vestments, loss of assets, and already
 evident Red Chinese intimidation in do-
 ing business with Taiwan.
 We need more than resolutions of
 good intent in these critical' times-we
 need firm-decisive action preserving
 our longtime official government-to-gov-
 ernment relations with the Republic of
 China in Taiwan. There has been an
 official two-China policy for years, since
 President Nixon opened the mainland,
 with U.S. liaison offices in Peking and a
 U.S. Embassy in Taipei. I have the per-
 sonal assurance from Republic of China
 Premier Sun that despite U.S. recogni-
 tion of the Peking government, Taiwan
 has always desired and continues to de-
 sire full official diplomatic relations with
 the United States.
 The issue requires a strong stand to
 protect America and Americans, and to
 help assure the independence and free-
 dom of 17 million Chinese people on
 Taiwan.
 Free China is not our enemy. Free
 China has not committed acts of hos-
 tility against the United States. Free
 China is only guilty of being our friend
 and ally in a world where faithful
 friends are often hard to find.
 In the legislation we finally approve
 today we must act to protect American
 and free Chinese interests by preserving
 the international status of the sovereign
 Republic of China and balancing our re-
 lations with the two Chinas.
 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I
 thank the gentleman for his statement.
 I know that the gentleman in the proc-
 ess delivered specific criticism of the
 administration, and many other Mem-
 bers have; and because they have, I will
 take the high road. I do not criticize, the
 administration as much as I call the
 Members' attention to the fact that the
 passage of this bill is necessary by the
 action of the administration. I think the
 administration is wrong, but the damage
 is done. The facts of life are that unless
 we pass this bill and then solve what-
 ever problems remain in conference with
 the Senate, then we would be letting
 down our friends in Taiwan.
 I will have a number of amendments
 to insure the status of Taiwan in inter-
 national organizations; to prevent the
 PRC's interference with the economy of
 Taiwan; to, and to strengthen the anti-
 boycott provisions in the bill.
 ^ 1315
 Then I also have an amendment deal-
 ing with the ability of Taiwan to pur-
 chase defense arms without interfer-
 ence, political, or otherwise,, from the
 government in Peking.
 Mr. Chairman, I would like to point
 out to the Members the reality of the
 situation. "Reality" is a favorite word
 here in Washington these days, and
 there is reality in this discussion of the
 situation involving the Chinas.
 My personal opinion is that we should
 not have normalized relations with the
 government in Peking unless they ac-
 cepted the continuation of our relations
 with the government in Taipei. In my

 personal opinion, there are two Chinas,    The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from

 fact, in the last few weeks the People's
 Republic of China found it necessary to
 advise the Japanese that some of the fat

 us.
 Mr. Chairman, one of the speakers
 earlier in debate mentioned Chinese oil.
 I suggest that all of the Members do a
 little research into this . question of
 'Chinese oil. There is not going to be that
 much available, and the quality of
 Chinese oil is going to be a panacea to
 Therefore, if any Members think that
 Chinese oil is 'going to be a panacea to
 our energy problem, think again. It is
 not.
 Mr. Chairman, looking at this situa-
 tion realistically, I would suggest that
 in this legislation we express the intent
 of Congress in this fashion: First, that
 we want to insure the security of the
 people of Taiwan; and if that means
 from time to time dealing with their
 governmental entity, so be it. Second,
 we want to insure their presence in in-
 ternational organizations. We want to
 insure that they will not be subject, di-
 rectly or indirectly, to any trade boycott;
 and then in the spirit of the President's
 great interest in human rights, I am sure
 all Members would agree with me that
 it would be an absolute tragedy and a
 blot on the record of this country if we
 in any way condoned the loss of rights
 which the 17 million people on Taiwan
 President's abrupt normalization of re-
 lations with the People's Republic of
 China is the apparent disregard of U.S.
 security interests in the Western Pacific.
 For the past 30 years, Taiwan has been
 a key strategic link in the U.S. Western
 Pacific defenses. During most of that
 time, the United States did not even rec-
 ognize the Communist government on
 the mainland.
 My concern is that in our haste to
 recognize the "reality" of 1 billion Chi-
 nese on the mainland, we should not ig-
 nore the reality of 17 million free Chi-
 nese on Taiwan who represent an impor-
 tant U.S. defense ally. At best, the Presi-
 dent's action would transfer the initiative
 for dealing with Taiwan to the Commu-
 nists. At worst, it would deliver a free
 nation-in a shrinking world of free-
 dom-over to communism.
 Government-to-government relations
 between the United States and Taiwan
 must be reestablished, with the United
 States retaining the international stand-
 ing in law to defend the Republic of
 China, Taiwan, against military aggres-
 sion or economic sanctions.
 Without  government-to-government
 relations, the United States will have
 recognized Peking's  sovereignty  over
 Taiwan, and thereby will have conceded
 that any effort by Peking to absorb
 Taiwan, by any means, would be strictly
 an internal affair of Communist China,

 constitute an act of war against the PRC

 meets the interests of the United States.
 Let me stress that the security lan-
 guage before the House today authorizes
 the President to take whatever action
 he deems advisable in the event of a
 threat to Taiwan's security, including the
 threat of economic blockade or boycott.
 The language does not exceed the lan-
 guage of the War Powers Act, a point I
 emphasize because I am afraid that some
 of our colleagues here today would urge
 upon us language which-and I will be
 frank-constitutes a virtual "Gulf of
 Tonkin resolution" on Taiwan.
 I make this point for two reasons:
 First, we have all learned the lesson,
 I think of the dangers of an open-ended
 grant to Presidential power. That is the
 purpose, and the virtue of War Powers,
 which I and Chairman ZABLOCKI fought
 so hard to make into law.
 The second reason I would urge upon
 you is historical as well and that is take
 a careful look at the language of the mu-
 tual defense treaty signed in 1954 by
 John Foster Dulles. I think the acid test
 for any language proposed today as a
 substitute to the commitee's work is to
 judge it in light of what was seemed nec-
 essary and appropriate in 1954. I think
 that you will agree the language of our
 bill meets the tests of history, and of
 commonsense in protecting the vital
 interests of the United States.
 For those who are concerned that our
 language has no real "teeth," let me call
 your attention to testimony before the
 Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Af-
 fairs which echoed the public remarks
 of President Carter that, if appropriate,
 he would not hesitate to use force to de-
 fend Taiwan.
 Our subcommittee received detailed
 testimony  from  political  and  legal
 experts of the State Department that
 under international law, the President
 would have legal justification for the use
 of force if deemed necessary and concur-
 red in by the Congress in defense of Tai-
 wan. .The legislation before you today
 provides the President with the flexibil-
 ity he needs, while at the'same time
 mandating that, under War Powers, he
 report to the Congress and receive the
 approval of Congress for his actions.
 But I would point out that our bill
 goes even further to meet the concerns
 expressed by so many of us:
 First, the bill specifically mandates a
 continued U.S. role in supplying Taiwan
 with defensive weapons, even after ex-
 piration of the Mutual Defense Treaty
 in December.
 Second, the bill specifically directs the
 President to promptly inform the Con-
 gress of any danger to U.S. interests
 arising from threats to Taiwan, includ-
 ing, as I have already noted, the threat
 of economic boycott or blockade.
 In sum, then, the bill before you meets
 any realistic, and, I feel, any possible
 threat to Taiwan, now and in the fu-
 ture, and I urge adoption of H.R. 2479.
 I further urge any of our colleagues
 May I add the following important
 historical perspective:
 I received a letter from former Presi-
 dent Nixon, the author of the opening
 to China, which prompts today's debate.
 In that February 14 letter, Mr. Nixon
 made two points I would like to share
 with the House today:
 In (Shanghai Communique) the U.S. "re-
 affirmed" its support of a peaceful resolution
 of the Taiwan issue. I consider that to be
 an unequivocal moral commitment. In my
 view U.S. policies toward the P.R.C. and
 Taiwan in . the future should be formulated
 in a way to honor that commitment.
 Mr. Nixon goes on to note:
 .. at a time when U.S. credibility as a
 dependable ally and friend is being ques-
 =tioned in a number of countries, it is also
 vitally important that. the Taiwan issue be
 handled in a way which will reassure other
 nations-whether old friends, new friends
 or wavering friends-that it is safe to rely
 on  America's  word  and  to  be  America's
 friend.   .
 Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that
 H.R. 2479 meets the tests suggested by
 Mr. Nixon-the twin tests of credibility
 and moral commitment.
 The tests must be linked, for surely
 a moral commitment which is stated in
 unrealistic language does not meet the
 genuine security or national interests of
 the United States. Thus, a commitment
 of that nature can hardly serve as a
 credible commitment, no matter how
 well-intentioned.
 In sum, then, H.R. 2479 is a credible,
 moral, and legal commitment precisely
 because it is also a realistic commit-
 ment, one which does not go beyond the
 bounds of American national interest.
 Mr. HUTTO. Mr. Chairman, I feel it
 necessary to state for the RECORD why I
 will be absent for the vote on H.R. 2479,
 United States-Taiwan Relations Act, and
 also to state my view on this legislation.
 I will be, at the time of this vote, on
 my way to Alaska with other members
 of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries
 Committee to "view, firsthand, the lands
 in question under H.R. 39, the Alaskan
 lands bill. During the visit, we will be
 holding hearings to receive testimony
 directly from the many citizens who
 cannot bear the expense to travel to
 Washington. As you know, this legisla-
 tion is of major importance to the people
 of the United States, the State of Alaska,
 and the future generations of America. I
 determined that this visit to Alaska was
 necessary after hearing numerous hours
 of testimony in the subcommittee and
 reading hundreds of pages of arguments.
 both'pro and con, on this legislation. Due
 .to my departure time, I must be absent
 at the time of the vote.
 Let me now turn my attention to the
 legislation in question, the United States-
 Taiwan Relations Act.
 As I have noted time and again, before
 this body and to my constituents, I have
 always supported a strong defense as a
 deterrent to aggression by. our adver-
 saries. We must remember though that

 .111171.
 The United States has been a main-
 stay of the free world for many years.
 Our friends could always count on us;
 our strength, our compassion, and our as-
 sistance. It is disturbing, to me as a citi-
 zen, as it must be to. our many allies,
 when we capriciously abandon an. ally
 who has fervently supported us even
 when things were darkest.
 Other allies must now be reconsidering
 their policy toward the United States and
 the . nondemocratic nations. How will
 other nations, both large and small, react
 when the United States calls upon them
 to stand tall against a major philosoph-
 ical adversary? Were I a leader of one of
 these nations, I would surely consider
 my position should the United States
 abandon my nation. Let us hope that the
 United States not obtain the title of a
 "fair-weather friend" in international
 circles. I trust the President, the Depart-
 ment of State, and the Senate have con-
 sidered these ramifications.
 I further question the intelligence of
 using the hard earned technological ad-
 vances of this great Nation to advance
 the nations committed to our downfall.
 As the administration views the world,
 free and Communist, with compassion,
 let them remember that in incident after
 incident, the nondemocratic nations have
 failed to follow our lead. When the time
 comes for a hard line disagreement on .
 an issue and our adversaries have our
 technological advances available to them,
 will they be compassionate?
 If the policy of the administration is to
 pursue these ties with Communist China,
 then let us insure that our close friends
 on Taiwan are guaranteed the right to
 maintain their free and democratic life-
 style. I believe that the United States
 owes this guarantee to a people who have
 been friends, through thick and thin,
 for many years. Let us not forget their
 friendship and let us pray to God that
 they will not abandon us.
 Mr.  RITTER.  Mr.  Chairman,  the
 approach Congress takes in assuring the
 security of Taiwan will have major in-
 ternational implications. Our action here
 in considering the United States-Taiwan
 Relations Act will be a message to the
 entire world .as to whether or not the
 United States can be trusted to honor its
 commitments and stand by our, friends
 and allies around the globe.
 The President's action in recognizing
 the People's Republic of China, as all
 Americans know, was taken without prior
 consultation with Congress. Like many of
 my colleagues, I was deeply disturbed at
 the way in which the President took that
 action without regard for the consent of
 the elected representatives of the people
 in Congress.
 But since that action has already been
 taken, it is now Congress' obligation to
 make absolutely sure that the safety of
 the 17 million citizens of Taiwan is guar-
 anteed by the nation Taiwan has stood
 by so faithfully for so long.
 Unless we tell the world loud and clear
 that we will never tolerate any threat to
 our allies on Taiwan, we will give our
 adversaries the dangerous impression
 that aggressive acts will be permitted
 against our allies anywhere. We will also
 send a message to our allies that our will

 that we, as a sovereign nation, the United

 The name of the government operating
 from the island of Taiwan Is the Re-
 public of China. That is all we are say-
 ing. There is no other recognized name.
 We would otherwise be talking about
 an island, and I think that it is per-
 fectly in order to refer to a government
 by its proper name, which in this case
 is the Republic of China, and also to
 give it the assurance that the United
 States reaffirms its commitments with
 respect to the antiboycott provisions of
 the present law.
 Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, if I
 could reclaim my time, the gentleman is
 well known for being opposed to what the
 administration has done. He has made a
 national campaign against it.
 ^ 1350
 The phraseology used in this bill has
 been very carefully worked out so as not
 to appear to attempt to reverse the ac-
 tion taken by the President that he was
 recognizing the PRC as the Government
 of China. That is why the bill refers
 throughout to Taiwan, the authorities on
 Taiwan, the people on Taiwan, and so
 forth. To refer to the Republic of China
 would be to give credence to the claim of
 March 8, 1979
 Unfortunately, there are many friends
 of the old Republic of China who would
 like to be more Chinese or more Tai-
 wanese than the Taiwanese themselves.
 They, the Taiwanese, have accepted cer-
 tain portions of the negotiation that
 have gone on. The bill that we have be-
 fore us is an attempt to help resolve those
 problems that still exist with the people
 of Taiwan.

 Mr. SOLARZ. I would simply add to
 what the gentleman just said that the
 only thing this amendment does which
 is not already provided for in the legisla-
 tion is to gratuitiously insert into the
 text of the bill the phrase, "The Republic
 of China," which, as my other good
 friend, the gentleman from New York .
 (Mr. BINGHAM) pointed out, could create
 problems for us in terms of our ability
 to pro:eed with the policy of normaliza-
 tion.

 words, ' and I rise in support of the
 amendment.

 I rose to debate this subject immediately

 of Taiwan. You. will be punishing our
 own country, our own people, our busi-

 and the relations we would have if we
 would have normal diplomatic relations.
 This bill is intended to provide the au-
 thority for the President to continue
 virtually all of the relations with Taiwan
 as have been going on for the last 30
 years, up to January 1, of this year.

 ^ 1410
 This bill is an extremely important
 initiative .in the foreign relations of our
 country. ,
 It creates the only possible mech-
 anism by which the United States can
 establish diplomatic relations ? with, that
 one-fourth of the human race which
 lives on mainland China and at the
 same time maintain the friendship, the
 respect and the integrity of our rela-
 tions with our true and proven friends
 on the island of Taiwan.
 An official "two-China Policy". has
 been  rejected by both Taiwan and
 mainland China. Both maintain that
 they are part of the same nation. For
 30 years both have consistently declared
 a two-China policy unacceptable.
 Within that framework of their mu-
 tual sensitivities, this legislation seems
 the only creative way in which we can
 cultivate the friendship of mainland
 China without abandoning the friend-
 ship of Taiwan.
 For every practical purpose, the legal
 entity created by this bill possesses

 The' Congress of the United States is
 here asserting its full partnership in for-

 China and to forgo any prospect of
 friendship and' peaceful relations with
 the largest and most populous nation on
 Earth.
 To do less would be to commit a craven
 abandonment of an old and proven
 friend and to raise questions everywhere
 about our own reliability as an ally.
 The representatives of Taiwan who
 have talked personally to me are anxious
 that we shall pass this bill expeditiously.
 Since the beginning of this month, our
 relations with Taiwan have been in a
 state of legal limbo. To allow them to'
 remain so through our inaction would
 be politically irresponsible and morally
 indefensible.
 This is not the bill which the President,
 sent to Congress; it is our own creation.
 It goes further in several particulars
 than he would have desired. Under the
 circumstances, I believe it is the most
 that we can do; and it is the least that
 we can do. I trust that the House will
 reject any amendments which would
 upset the basic structure of the legisla-
 tion, and will approve this bill by an
 overwhelming vote today.
 ^ 1415
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman, I
 move to strike the requisite number of
 words.
 Mr. Chairman, it appears to me that
 we are really talking about two things
 here. One, we are talking about whether
 or not we should put specific antiboycott
 language into the bill. I do not think
 there should be any argument about that.
 I think that since, the issue has been
 raised, we should put it in. Furthermore,
 the report recognizes that that is what
 we should do. I do not believe there
 should be any argument about that.
 There is an argument, however, about
 the language which the gentleman from
 Idaho (Mr. HANSEN) uses. It would seem
 to indicate a two-China policy. Person-
 ally, I think we should have a two-China
 policy; but I do not think this is the place
 to do it.
 Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield to
 the gentleman from Idaho. I understand
 he has an idea for an amendment which
 might satisfy both concerns here. There-
 fore, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho
 (Mr. HANSEN).                       ,
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank
 the gentleman for yielding.
 Since there is concern about the use of
 the word "country" at this point, which
 is in the quote from the previous law, and
 since there seems to be concern about the
 use of the words "Republic of China,"
 and since throughout the bill reference is
 made to Taiwan per se, then perhaps
 other amending language would be in or-
 der, something to the effect that "in in-
 terpreting boycott under the provisions
 of this section, Taiwan shall be consid-
 ered `friendly to the United States' under
 the terms of title II of Public Law 95-52
 (91 Stat. 244)."
 Mr. Chairman, does anyone among the
 opposition have anything to say about
 that suggestion?

 Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I yield to the
 gentleman from New York.
 Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, I would
 like to ask the author of the amendment
 a couple of questions about it before re-
 sponding to his question.
 His amendment is to insert a new sec-
 tion at page 2, line 21; and I think that
 that is an erroneous reference. I think
 the gentleman probably intended page
 3, line 5; is that correct?
 Mr. HANSEN. If the gentleman will
 yield further so that I may respond, this
 has been brought to my attention, and I
 ask herewith unanimous consent to- be
 permitted to amend the amendment so as
 to read "page 2, after line 22, insert a
 new section and redesignate succeeding
 subsections accordingly."
 The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from
 Idaho?
 Mr. BINGHAM. Reserving the right to
 object, Mr. Chairman, may I point out
 to the gentleman that the only reference
 to "boycott" in section 2 occurs in sub-
 section (5). There is no reference to
 "boycott" until we reach subsection (5),
 so I am going to suggest that the kind
 of amendment the gentleman has in
 mind would be appropriate, if at all, in
 subsection (b) of section 201, where we
 are referring to the applicability of cer-
 tain laws.
 With reference to the term "boycott"
 in subsection (5), that has no reference
 to the antiboycott legislation. It is sim-
 ply a statement of one of the acts that
 would cause us grave concern in this
 country. Also, title II of the Export Ad-
 ministration Act does not apply to sub-
 section (5) in any way, to Taiwan or to
 any other country. It does apply to Tai-
 wan under the terms of subsection (b)
 of section 101, so I would suggest, if I
 might respectfully, that the gentleman
 take those facts into consideration.
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman from California will yield
 further, so that I might inquire if I
 should withdraw this amendment as
 now offered and reoffer it at the point
 the gentleman from New York suggests,
 on the next page, would it be more in
 order and more acceptable to him under
 these conditions altered as I have sug-
 gested?
 Mr. BINGHAM. Speaking for myself,
 providing we can arrive at acceptable
 language to specifically refer to the anti-
 boycott provisions of the Export Ad-
 ministration Act, to include that specifi-
 callv in subparagraph (b) on page 4, I
 would see no objection to that.
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Chairman, if I
 might respond, under those considera-
 tions, I ask unanimous consent to be
 permitted to withdraw my amendment
 at this point.
 -The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from
 Idaho?
 There was no objection.
 The . CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's
 amendment is withdrawn.
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Chairman, I do

 propriate time.

 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. ASHBROOK
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, I
 offer an amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Amendment offered by Mr. ASHBROOK: Page
 2, line 20, immediately after "cultural," in-
 sert "defensive, political,".
 ^ 1420
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, after
 being in this Body for a number of years
 I find that preambles, declarations of
 purpose, and our extensive statements of
 what we intend to do in legislation often
 are meaningless. At other times they do
 mean something. I would like to point
 out to the members of the committee
 that this is one of those times where I
 think the Declaration of Principles does
 mean something. I call the Members'
 attention  to  several  very  carefully
 phrased sentences in the "Declaration of
 Principles Governing U.S. Policy With
 Regard to Taiwan." If the Members will
 look at subparagraph (2), we are inter-
 ested in peace and stability in the area.
 Of course, the area is defined as includ-
 ing "the people on the China mainland
 and all other peoples. of the Western
 Pacific area." Yet when we get to Tai-
 wan itself, if the Members will go down
 to subparagraph (3), we are interested
 only that "continued extensive, close,
 and friendly commercial, cultural, and
 other relations between the people of the
 United States and the people on Taiwan
 must be assured."
 I understand we have an interest in
 the defense and the security of Taiwan.
 The  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.
 WRIGHT), our majority leader, indicated
 we wanted to keep those defensive con-
 cerns and commitments in place and
 that they would unravel if we unduly
 amended this bill. I think it would be a
 far clearer statement of what we want
 to do in our principles if we would have
 subparagraph, (3) read as follows:
 0 0 o extensive, close, and friendly com-
 mercial, cultural, defensive, political,  and
 other relations. between the people of the
 United  States  and  the  people  on Tai-
 wan o  0                                                    0
 Whom are we trying to fool? If we are
 only talking about commercial and cul-
 tural relations with Taiwan, and we
 specifically put that in the principles
 governing the U.S. policy with regard to
 Taiwan, that is a message about as clear
 as can be sent anywhere that our main
 interest is only commercial and cultural,
 ballets and balance sheets.
 The Members may say that is not that
 important.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from New York.'
 Mr. WOLFF. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Does the gentleman imply that we
 should become involved in the political
 affairs of the people on Taiwan?
 Mr. ASHBROOK. To the extent that
 they want to maintain their freedom, I
 would say.
 Mr. WOLFF. What about the native
 Taiwanese? There are a great number of
 native Taiwanese on the island. Does the
 gentleman believe that we should inject
 ourselves into the political machinations
 that might take place to provide the Tai-
 wanese the equipment or the ability,to
 overthrow the existing government,
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I do not believe that
 that is a policy that I would support at
 all. We are talking about defensive and
 political.
 Mr. WOLFF. The gentleman included
 "political" as well.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Yes. That is correct.
 Generally when we talk in terms of polit-
 ical rights we mean civil 'rights and
 human rights. It does not necessarily
 mean the protestations of the leaders
 and what they want to do. We talk about
 the people on Taiwan, the political rights,
 and the defensive rights of the people on
 Taiwan.
 Mr. WOLFF. The defensive rights are
 covered in other portions of the bill.
 However, the one element that really dis-
 turbs me is getting involved in the in-
 ternal political affairs of Taiwan. I take
 it the gentleman is at the present time
 satisfied with the present authorities on
 Taiwan.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. Compared to what is
 on the mainland. I would say I am
 abundantly satisfied.
 Mr. WOLFF. I just raise this point be-
 cause this political element here raises all
 sorts of questions as to how we should
 proceed in the future.
 Mr. ASHBROOK. I think the word
 "politically" does not extend in the areas
 my friend, the gentleman from New York
 is indicating. I think all of t srknow when
 we have cultural-commercial, cultural-
 political relations with a country, what
 we are talking about. We have had polit-
 ical relations with the people on Taiwan.
 I think we should continue those, and to
 state in our Declaration of Principles
 that we are only really interested in close,
 friendly, commercial, and cultural rela-
 tions I think belies what the gentleman
 is saying he wants to do in the rest of the
 bill. This is certainly not to throw a
 snare, a time bomb, or to unravel any-

 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, that
 is precisely what I am trying to inject
 into this amendment in the declaration
 of principles; but if my colleague, the
 gentleman from New York and others,
 only think we should have commercial
 and cultural relations and not defensive
 and not political contacts, then possibly
 they should vote against the amendment.

 preted without much question to force
 us into a defensive treaty with Taiwan
 and force us, therefore, to send American
 troops, men and women,. to defend that
 island, which is against, in my opinion,
 the public policy of this country and
 against the feeling of the majority of
 the American people.
 Mr. Chairman, I also call to the at-
 tention of the House, if I may very re-
 spectfully, the fact that the amendment
 proposed by the gentleman from In-
 diana (Mr. QUAYLE). some time ago, and
 accepted by this body, should be recon-
 sidered to some degree as a result of
 these words, and I will read them:
 The United States will maintain its ca-
 pacity to resist any resort to force.
 I suggest very strongly that although
 that amendment was accepted by both
 sides of the aisle, and I certainly do not
 say this in any criticism to the chairman
 for whom I have great, great respect, or
 to Congressman BROOMFIELD on our side
 of the aisle, but I do suggest that there
 may be more to be read into that amend-
 ment than most of us would desire.
 I was not on the floor at the time, but
 I suggest in light of what has now been
 offered by the gentleman from Ohio
 (Mr. AsxsROOK) that we may be leading
 ourselves into a very deadly trap.
 Mr. Chairman, it is my belief that
 the motivation, the timing, and the
 method employed in normalizing rela-
 tions with the People's Republic of
 China were and are proper and justified.
 Normalization of relations with the
 People's Republic is in our self-interest,
 economically, politically, and, I suggest,
 strategically.
 I would suggest also that this may be
 the first time in too many years that we
 have allowed, rightfully, those consid-
 erations to guide our foreign policy.
 Like it or not, admit it or not, we live
 in an increasingly interdependent world
 that includes not only the free Western
 among nations can continue to expand
 so that the United States can continue
 to expand not only around the globe
 but at home as well.
 With such sudden attention to the so-
 called "super powers," it may appear to
 some that the Taiwanese have been lost
 in the aftermath, if not that they are
 the losers outright. I dare say they are
 not.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.
 MARKS) has expired.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. MARKS
 was allowed to proceed for 2 additional
 minutes.)
 Mr. MARKS. Mr. Chairman, today's
 bill affirms the determination of the
 United States not to forget the friends
 that we have on that island. Their right
 to engage in lucrative international com-
 merce and ability to remain secure have
 been insured. Our relationship with the
 authorities on Taiwan will continue in
 fact, if not in appearance, just as before
 recognition of the People's Republic
 of China. I would even venture to esti-
 mate that Taiwan stands to benefit from
 the markets which Sino-American trade
 will open up and from the enhanced
 security which normalization will bring
 to this area of Southeastern Asia.
 It is the prerogative and duty of the
 Congress to define the new authority on
 Taiwan and to assert its intentions to see
 that the people on Taiwan are allowed
 to pursue their lives in peace and pros-
 perity. Today's bill clarifies the entity
 with which we will have dealings with
 Taiwan, sets forth the mechanisms by
 which this country can continue to deal
 fairly with Taiwan, and restates a sense
 of commitment to the people of Taiwan.
 Mr. Chairman, I not only oppose this
 amendment but support H.R. 2479, be-

 gives a sufficient elaboration of the politi-

 by this bill establishing, and it is unwise
 and unnecessary to add these words at
 this juncture.
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. Mr.
 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite
 number of words.
 (Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma asked
 and was given permission to revise and
 extend his remarks.)
 Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma. Mr.
 Chairman, I rise in support of the
 amendment and I rise because I am
 concerned about the direction of some
 of the debate up to this point.
 Many of us who are not opposed to the
 recognition of the People's Republic of
 China do not necessarily agree with all
 of, the steps. that are embodied in the
 legislation that is now before us. While
 I recognize that constitutionally the
 President has the sole power to recog-
 nize a nation or not to recognize a na-
 tion-and he has undertaken to employ
 that power properly, although I would
 not have done it in the same way-as a
 separate and equal branch of govern-
 ment we are elected to exercise our
 judgment in terms of specific legislation
 implementing how that policy is going
 to be carried out, and we are not here for
 the purpose of merely rubber-stamping
 whatever comes down from the White
 House.
 As I heard that suggested from the
 Democratic side of the aisle I was con-
 cerned about what seems to me to be a
 continuing apparent abdication of the
 rights of this House so as not to upset
 the executive branch down at the White
 House.
 ^ 1435
 I would like to have commented, if the
 gentleman   from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.
 MARKS) had had the time to yield to me
 that I was surprised by one of the things
 the gentleman said during the argument
 against this amendment when he expres-
 sed the great fear, the great concern,
 that this amendment could lead to send-
 ing American men and women to fight on
 Taiwan. I do not want to see that happen
 either. But I. would say that from every-
 thing I have heard coming out of the
 White House and from the other side of
 the aisle, I thought we were going for-
 ward here on the assumption that we had
 been assured that there is not going to
 be an invasion. We are told that 'con-
 stantly. We are told it is not in the best
 interest of the People's Republic of China
 or of Teng Hsiao-ping to invade Taiwan
 so we should relax and not worry about
 it.
 Isn't the gentleman's concern mis-
 placed, since we have already been told-
 and I would assume the gentleman
 agrees, from the position he takes-that
 there is no danger of an invasion of Tai-
 wan. So I think that is not really a valid
 argument at this point.
 Mr. MARKS. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?

 Peking.
 This is why I feel it is imperative that
 the Congress specify, here in this bill,
 that it is our intention that Taiwan be
 permitted to purchase from us the best
 military equipment available, sufficient
 to meet its defense requirements. I
 strongly  urge,  therefore,  that  this
 amendment be adopted.
 ^ 1510
 We are not talking about offensive
 weapons. We are talking about defensive
 weapons here.
 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, will.
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. KRAMER. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Missouri.
 Mr. SKELTON. The gentleman is in-
 tending to insert the phrase, "the highest
 technology," is that correct?
 Mr. KRAMER. That is correct.
 Mr. SKELTON. Would the gentleman
 tell this body which other country,
 which other ally we have in this world,
 there is where we are required by law
 to share with them the highest tech-
 nology?
 Mr. KRAMER. Well, I cannot answer
 the gentleman's question.
 Mr. SKELTON. As a matter of fact,
 there is no other such ally. There is no
 such other friend where we are required
 by law to give them the highest tech-
 nology that we have available to us?
 Is that not correct?
 Mr. KRAMER. Well, as I said before,
 I cannot answer the gentleman's ques-
 tion, but I do not think that detracts
 from the merits of the argument we are
 making. If we are sincerely interested in
 protecting the ability of Taiwan to de-
 fend itself under the circumstances it
 is presently situated in, I think we ought
 to have the opportunity of furnishing
 it with the highest technology defensive
 equipment, because if we are not willing
 to do that, what would be involved, in
 my judgment, is an exercise in futility.
 Mr. SKELTON. Does the gentleman
 not think we should have the right for
 our Commander in Chief to make the
 decision of what technology is used for
 what ally?
 Mr. KRAMER. Talking about offen-
 sive weapons, I cannot agree with the
 gentleman more. In defensive weapons,
 we are talking about an entirely different
 situation.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. KRAMER. I yield to the gentle-
 man from New York.
 Mr.  WOLFF. Does the gentleman
 realize what he is saying in this amend-
 ment? Would he provide them with nu-
 clear weapons?
 Mr. KRAMER. We are talking about
 defensive weapons.
 CONGI>gOSHONA RIECO) D e IHIOUSIE
 in this amendment, but I would ask the
 gentleman this question: If the require-
 ments he has written into this bill, lines
 10 to 12, will make available to Taiwan
 defense articles and defense services for
 its defense against armed attack, what
 are we talking about there? Are we talk-
 ing about horse-drawn equipment, or are
 we talking about an aircraft left over
 from World War II? I think if we are
 really serious about providing appro-
 priate defense equipment, we have got
 to provide the best and most effective
 that is available.
 Mr. WOLFF. I think the point the gen-
 tleman makes is a strong one against his
 amendment, because we do have in here
 the provision that we will have appro-
 priate defense, appropriate action, and
 appropriate weaponry for the defense of
 Taiwan. I think if he is talking about the
 the highest technology, he is going
 far beyond the realm of what is possible
 for us to be able to, in reality, perform.
 Mr. KRAMER. Would the gentleman
 answer one of my questions? He indi-
 cates that we have explicitly provided to
 the people of Taiwan appropriate de-
 fensive weaponry in light of their par-
 ticular situation. Might I ask where we
 have done that?
 Mr. WOLFF. In the area that we will
 take appropriate action in response to
 any danger.
 Mr. KRAMER. Might I ask where we
 have talked about where we are somehow
 defining what constitutes appropriate de-
 fensive equipment?
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Colorado has expired.
 (At the request of Mr. KELLY and by
 unanimous consent Mr. KRAMER was al-
 lowed to proceed for 2 additional min-
 utes.)
 Mr. KELLY. Would the gentleman
 yield?
 Mr. KRAMER. I would like to get an
 answer to the question from the gen-
 tlemna from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. The United States is
 continuing in its pipeline this year
 alone, even though we have had a hiatus
 in new equipment that we are giving
 to them or selling to them, we have
 $850 million in the pipeline alone of
 sophisticated weaponry.

 To establish the legislative history
 here, we do not mean that we will de-

 horse-drawn vehicles. We mean that we
 will deliver to them appropriate equip-

 Mr. KRAMER. Does the gentleman
 have language that he would offer to
 substitute for mine to provide that?
 Mr. WOLFF. I would be delighted to
 find it in the report, in an attempt to
 enlarge upon the instructions that are
 given in the bill itself.
 Mr. WOLFF. Well, there are some peo- Mr. KRAMER. The only point I

 that they could be adequately protected
 and be able to protect their interests
 based on supplies coming from this
 country without some definition of
 what that statutory provision means.
 Mr. WOLFF. If the gentleman will
 yield further, in the language of the re-
 port, on page 6, it states the following:
 It is the committee's intent that the
 United States will continue to make avail-
 able modern weapons for Taiwan, and not
 shift to a policy of supplying only obsolete
 weapons. In fact, the United States should
 make available those types of conventional
 weapons and equipment needed for Taiwan's
 defense and not upon the reaction that
 supplying such defense articles or defense
 services might stimulate.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Colorado (Mr. KRABa)
 has expired.
 (On request of Mr.  KELLY  and by
 unanimous consent, Mr. KRAMER was al-
 lowed  to  proceed  for  1  additional
 minute.)
 Mr. KRAMER. Mr. Chairman, I would
 only make the comment to the gentle-
 man from New York (Mr. WOLFF) that
 if the report provides for modern weap-
 onry, what is modern weaponry? To me,
 modern weaponry is weaponry which is
 of the highest available technology.
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. KRAMER. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Florida.
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Chairman, I think
 the gentleman's amendment is well
 taken because we all-will notice that
 there was nothing specific about what
 would be provided. For instance, are
 we going to get any answers to these
 questions?   Is  there  air-to-ground
 capacity so that the defense of Taiwan
 could start at the embarkation points
 on the mainland of China, and will there
 be antisubmarine warfare equipment
 and the real means of defending a
 nation?
 There is nothing to indicate that Tai-
 wan has those weapons now, that they
 are in the pipeline; or that the United
 States intends to give those weapons to
 them. There is no assurance in this bill
 which indicates that, and it is a sham.
 As far as any reference to the security
 of Taiwan or of the Western Pacific de-
 fenses of the United States is concerned,
 'that is what this bill is, a sham; and I
 think the gentleman's amendment has
 pointed that out.
 Mr. KRAMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank
 the gentleman for his remarks.
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Chairman, I move to
 strike the last word, and I rise in sup-
 port of the amendment.
 (Mr. KELLY asked and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Chairman, I would
 like to pose a question to the gentleman
 from Colorado (Mr. KRAMER).
 Does the gentleman intend by his
 amendment that the highest available
 technology has reference to conven-
 tional weapons, or is he including atomic
 weaponry in what he describes?
 Mr. KRAMER. If the gentleman will
 yield, Mr. Chairman, I would say to the

 Mr. KELLY. All right, then the gentle-

 conventional weapons?
 Mr. KRAMER. That is correct. That

 Mr. KELLY. I yield to the gentleman
 from Florida.
 Mr. FASCELL. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding. What the gentleman has
 done is define the amendment to have a
 different definition from the definition
 that is already in the bill, and now I am
 really confused' here. "Highest available
 technology" does have a meaning or it
 does not have a meaning. But the pro-
 ponent of the amendment in responding
 to the interrogator is now trying to de-
 lineate the definition.
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Chairman, I would
 like to regain my time.
 Mr. FASCELL. The gentlemen used my
 time before. I am just trying to get Some

 illicitly stated. I have seen the weapons
 on Taiwan and I can state the weap-
 onry on Taiwan, particularly in their
 aircraft, is in many instances obsolete
 and not adequate to modern technology,
 modern defense against a nation which
 does have modern technology.
 I think this particular amendment re-
 flects the wishes of the American public.
 All we are talking about is modern de-
 fensive weaponry of a conventional na-
 ture to preserve the integrity and sov-
 ereignty of Taiwan as it now stands,
 preserve it from attack from abroad.

 Mr. WHITE. I yield to the gentleman.
 from California.
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman,
 I thank the gentleman for yielding. I
 think the gentleman's amendment is
 very apt. We should address this concern.
 One of the things that concerns me
 about what has happened is that the
 President did not go into the aspect of
 nuclear armaments, the nuclear non-
 proliferation treaty and so on, in his
 negotiations and agreements with the
 People's Republic, nor with Taiwan.
 I think one of the great dangers we
 face in that area of the world is that
 Taiwan,  feeling  completely  isolated,
 might go ahead and develop atomic
 weapons. I, for one, do not think they will
 do so; they deny any such intention.
 I believe they have the capacity and
 know-how to produce atomic devices. By
 assuring them we will provide them with
 conventional weapons of the latest tech-
 nology, we' can avoid that; so I support
 the gentleman's amendment offered as a
 substitute for the amendment of the gen-
 tleman from Colorado.

 the security and defense Interests of Tai-
 wan be clarified. I think this amendment
 does nothing more than do that. I would
 point out that it does not In any way at-
 tempt to readopt the " Mutual Defense
 Treaty. All it does is clarify that the obli-
 gations that the United States incurred
 under the terms of that treaty to act In
 the case of armed attack against Taiwan
 continue after the treaty Is terminated
 next January 1.
 I do not see how we can do any less
 today that we did 25 years ago in recog-
 nizing the threat represented to our own
 interests by an armed attack against Tai-
 wan and declaring publicly our commit-
 ment to take appropriate action in re-
 sponse to such a threat. This amendment
 does not commit us to take any specific
 action. Rather, it simply puts forth
 clearly the position of the United States
 that a threat to the security of Taiwan
 constitutes a threat to the peace and sta-
 bility of the West Pacific Area and hence
 to the interests of the United States.
 By this clarification, it Is my intention
 that the amendment would further pre-
 serve the peace and stability of the area
 by discouraging any potential aggressors
 against Taiwan who might otherwise
 suffer under an illusion that armed at-
 tack against Taiwan would be of little
 consequence to the United States. 1 hope
 the Members of this body will support
 this amendment.

 Mr. Chairman, this amendment goes
 to a very fundamental point In the nor-
 malization process. The Question It raises
 is whether the United States should con-
 tinue after January 1 of next year the
 defense treaty obligation that is being
 terminated as a result of the President's
 decision of this past December.
 The language that the gentleman from
 Colorado (Mr. KRAMER) would insert in
 the bill includes the very critical word
 "act". In the event that any armed at-
 tack directed the policy underathis amendment for the
 United States to act to meet the danget.
 is that in the event of an attack on Tai-
 wan, "the President and the Congress
 shall determine, in accordance with con-
 stitutional processes, appropriate action
 by the United States in response to any
 such danger." And in fact the whip no-
 tice uses the word, "act," rather than
 "action."
 What is the difference between this
 kind of action and the kind of action re-
 ferred to in the pending amendment? I
 do not see any difference.
 Mr. SOLARZ. Mr. Chairman, I was not
 the one who made the point about the
 word, "action," to which the gentleman
 just referred. But the fundamental dif-
 ference between the word, "action, ' on
 page 3 of the pending bill and the lan-
 guage in the amendment offered by the
 gentleman from Colorado (Mr. KRAMMER)
 is that the language in the amendment
 offered by the gentleman from Colorado
 comes explicitly and clearly right out of
 the text of the mutual defense treaty.

 will scuttle the policy of normalization
 and it will obviously be unacceptable to
 Peking. One of the conditions of the
 policy of normalization was our termi-
 nation of the defense treaty; and, if we
 redo it now, we will have reneged on
 our part of the bargain with the People's
 Republic of China.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from New York (Mr. SOLARZ)
 has expired.
 (On request of Mr. STRATTON, and by
 unanimous consent, Mr. SOLARZ was al-
 lowed         to  proceed  for  1  additional
 minute.)
 Mr. STRATTQN. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield further?
 Mr. SOLARZ. I yield to the gentleman
 from New York.
 Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Chairman, in
 other words, what the gentleman is really
 objecting to is any reference to the treaty
 itself; but as far as what we can do under
 the terms of either this legislation or the
 treaty, there seems to be no real differ-
 ence. Is that not right?
 Mr. SOLARZ. If the gentleman can
 come up with language which does not
 explicitly come from the text of the mu-
 tual defense treaty and which itself is
 not incompatible with normalization,
 then I would be perfectly prepared to
 accept it, but an explicit reference to the
 mutual defense treaty in this- amend-
 ment, which we would be reaffirming
 through the adoption of the amendment,
 would be completely incompatible with
 normalization.
 Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield once again., I think
 we are at the guts of what is really in-
 volved in this pending legislation. We are
 really asserting here is the right to do
 exactly what we would have done under
 the former treaty; but we do not want
 to mention the treaty because we have
 already abrogated it. That is the only
 basis, as I understand it, on which this
 legislation is being accepted by the
 House.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, I move to
 strike the requisite number of words.
 Mr. Chairman, I would, like to con-
 tinue the colloquy with the gentleman
 from New York (Mr. STRATTON).
 I believe that the point that is involved
 here is that we have gone far beyond the
 mutual defense treaty in this particular
 bill because we consider not only an
 armed attack as a threat to the security
 but a boycott or an embargo, and, there-
 fore, the language that is contained in
 the bill goes beyond actually even the
 mutual defense or security treaty.
 The other fact involved here is that we
 have enlarged upon the very basis of the
 term, "Taiwan," itself and have included
 economic acts against Taiwan as a threat
 that we would make an act.
 Now, on that basis, what is happening
 here is the injection of the words, "Mu-
 tual Defense Treaty," and the exact
 language that has been in that treaty
 does violence to the basic premise we are
 trying to achieve here, and yet the
 actions we are taking in order to meet
 those threats are fully articulated within
 the bill.
 This language is totally unnecessary
 inasmuch as it has already been outlined
 very clearly in the bill to its fullest extent
 and even goes beyond that.
 ^ 1605
 Mr. STRATTON. If the gentleman will
 yield, the gentleman said that he wanted
 a "colloquy" with we.
 Mr. WOLFF. Yes.
 Mr. STRATTON. I have been listening
 to the gentleman. I still cannot see how
 the references that the gentleman has
 made really have any application to the
 issue we were discussing.
 The opposition to the amendment, as
 stated by the gentleman from Illinois
 (Mr. FINDLEY), was that it was going to
 get us into some kind of terrible military
 action and, therefore, we should not put
 it in.
 The fact of the matter is still that the
 wording of this legislation is almost iden-
 tical to the terms of the former treaty.
 And, in fact, the only way that you are
 going to get the House to support this
 legislation is if you convince the House
 and the American people that if there is
 an attack on Taiwan we can do under
 this legislation whatever we would have
 been able to do before. Considering the
 mood of this Congress, if there had been
 an attack on Taiwan 6 months ago we
 probably would not have done anything
 except issue a statement of some sort and
 let it go at that.
 But we do have our constitutional
 processes and, under this language, we
 could do exactly the same thing.  ,
 Mr. WOLFF. Would the gentleman
 feel we would not go beyond what we
 would have gone a year ago?
 Mr. STRATTON. I am not sure. I think
 the language that is being proposed is
 exactly the same language, and so we can
 do whatever we want to. To suggest that
 somehow putting in the word "act" is
 going to do terrible damage to our rela-
 tionship is nonsense. Either we are going
 to retain our military capabilities or we
 are not.
 Mr. WOLFF. The question is not the
 word "act" or "action," because that ;
 contained in the bill already. The point
 that has been made in this amendment I-
 that the United States reaffirm the Mu-
 tual Defense Treaty. If we are going to
 reaffirm it, we would not have termi-
 nated the treaty.
 Mr. STRATTON. That is what I said
 to the gentleman from New York. The
 only thing he is referring to is killing any
 reference to the treaty. We want to kill
 the treaty but we still want the same
 capabilities to react that we had before.
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman,
 I move to strike the requisite. number of
 words.
 Mr. KRAMER. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO..I yield to the
 gentleman from Colorado.
 Mr. KRAMER. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Mr. Chairman, I think the arguments
 we have heard here illustrate exactly
 the reason for the necessity for this
 amendment.
 One gentleman from New York says
 that this is going to impose on the United
 States certain obligations to act that we
 do not want to be responsible for, that
 we do not want to live with.
 I would suggest that if we do not want
 to live with the realization that we have
 to take some action or to act in the event
 of an armed attack on Taiwan, what we
 are dealing with here is a sham. The
 bill before us, under those terms, has no
 significance.
 The other gentleman from New York
 takes the contrary position. He says that
 what we have done in the bill is to go
 far beyond what we provided in the
 Mutual Defense Treaty by reference to
 economic matters, such as boycotts or
 embargoes.
 The question in my mind, and my
 motivation for attempting to insert this
 language, is that I am not exactly sure
 what we are agreeing to do in this bill by
 way of taking action, in light of any
 future endangerment of Taiwan. I do
 not think Taiwan will know, or the
 people of this country will-know, or any-
 one else will know, if we pass this bill as
 it is presently structured.
 I am suggesting that we pass this bill
 not that we repass the Mutual Defense
 Treaty. I am not asking to do that. I am
 simply asking that we reaffirm to the
 U.S. citizenry and to the people of the
 world and the people of Taiwan that, in
 case of an armed attack against Taiwan,
 we are going to take the-same action in
 accordance with our constitutional proc-
 esses that we would have taken had that
 treaty remained in effect. If we are not
 willing to do that, I submit to the Mem-
 bers that we are not willing to do any-
 -thing at all.
 ^ 1610
 Mr. WOLFF. In the first place, there
 is nothing in this act that precludes the
 President from taking whatever action
 he deems necessary in line with the con-
 stitutional process to react to any attack
 that exists. That is point No. 1.
 The second point I should like to ask
 the author of the amendment is, does he
 consider an attack upon Quemoy a
 threat to the safety of the United States?
 Mr. KRAMER. Yes, I do.
 Mr. WOLFF. The gentleman goes far
 beyond what the people of the United
 States were willing to accept years ago.
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Chairman, I move to
 strike the last word, and I rise in favor
 of the amendment.
 (Mr. KELLY asked and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. KELLY. Mr. Chairman, I think
 that at this time, in light of this amend-
 ment, it is important to try and dispel]
 anothed myth about this whole situa-
 tion. By the action of the President, the
 United States has no standing at the
 present time to move in and out of Tai-
 wan as they now do except by the grace
 of the PRC. Somehow or another, the
 predicate for all this discussion seems to
 presuppose that we are at liberty to do
 what we want to do with regard to Tai-
 wan, just as we were before; but, that is
 not the situation.
 Unless we have the understanding that
 the PRC can move -around Hawaii and
 Alaska and New York Harbor with its

 The result of the vote was announced
 as above recorded.
 ^ 1645
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I
 move to strike the last word.
 Mr. Chairman, during the rollcall
 several Members inquired whether it is
 the intention to complete this bill today.
 I advised them, as the Speaker at his
 press conference advised the press, that
 it was the intention of the leadership
 that the House complete this legislation
 today. The majority leader in a colloquy
 with the minority leader as to the calen-
 dar for next week and the business of
 today had advised the minority leader
 that we intend to finish it today.
 Mr. Chairman, I again announce that
 it is our intention to finish this bill
 today. It is my understanding that we
 have one more amendment to title I, and
 several amendments to title II. There
 are no more than two or three major
 amendments, however, which could be
 controversial.
 ? Mr. Chairman, I would urge our col-
 leagues to remain on the floor, and I
 am positive that we can finish this bill
 in time for those Members who have
 plane reservations to make them.
 The CHAIRMAN. Are there other
 amendments to title I?
 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. LAGOMARSINO
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman,'
 I offer an amendment.
 The Clerk read as follows:
 Amendment offered by Mr. LAGOMARSINO:
 Page 3, at the end of. line 18, insert the fol-
 lowing sentence: "Among the responses to
 be considered to such a danger should be all
 appropriate actions, including the possibility
 of withdrawing United States diplomatic
 recognition  of  the  People's  Republic  of
 'China.".
 (Mr. LAGOMARSINO asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman, I
 will try to be brief. I think we can handle
 this amendment expeditiously.
 Mr. Chairman, this amendment would
 require the President to consider the
 possibility of withdrawing U.S. recogni-
 tion from the People's Republic of China
 if it threatens Taiwan's security.
 The report of the committee makes it
 very apparent and very clear that at the
 very least the United States should seri-
 ously consider withdrawing recognition
 of the PRC if that should occur.
 ^ 1650
 The real effect of the amendment
 would be to emphasize that recognition
 is not necessarily permanent. It would
 indicate to the PRC that our recognition
 is dependent upon the good behavior of
 the Peking government. I think the re-
 cent international adventures of that
 government alone should be enough jus-
 tification for approval of this amend-
 ment. President Carter says that, at
 least in part, his decision to recognize
 the PRC was based on his understand-
 ing that the PRC would not attack Tai-
 wan and would not use force to liberate
 Taiwan. Peking should be aware that
 the reverse could be true also, that is,
 that there could be derecognition should
 they breach the faith that the President
 has in them, rightly or wrongly.
 I would like to stress also that the
 amendment only lists derecognition as
 an alternative for the President. It does
 not require him to take that action and
 it does not preclude him from taking
 stronger steps if he so wishes. It simply
 is a statement of congressional concern
 that our recognition be based on the be-
 havior of the PRC. I think they are
 symmetrical. As I say, the agreement or
 the decision to recognize the PRC was
 based at least in part on the President's
 understanding that they would not use
 force to liberate Taiwan. I think the re-
 verse should be considered.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I yield to the
 gentleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 I think the gentleman is well-inten-
 tioned certainly with his 'amendment,
 but does the gentleman really want that
 sort of response as the prime response?
 That we put in the bill that as the result
 of an attack upon Taiwan, we would
 withdraw recognition of the People's Re-
 public of China?
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I think that
 ought to be one of the things that is in
 the bill, yes.
 Mr. WOLFF. But I do believe that the
 gentleman  is  centering attention on
 what perhaps could be the least desirable
 action.
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I would find it
 highly unlikely that this administration
 would take that action in any event, so
 I do not think that it would really hurt
 anything to have it in the bill. I think
 it is well worth stating.
 Mr. Chairman, I yield back the re-
 mainder of my time.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
 in opposition to the amendment.
 Mr. Chairman, although in my expla-
 nation of the provisions of the bill in the
 debate, I would say that if the People's
 Republic of China were to use force to
 attack Taiwan, or use force in an em-
 bargo to stop Taiwan's trade, the very
 least that we should do in response-
 and it should be an adequate response-
 should be the consideration of severing
 diplomatic relations with the PRC.
 Mr. Chairman, we discussed it, and the
 gentleman from California discussed it,
 in committee, and the gentleman from
 California  proposed  the  amendment
 when we were in the markup stage. The
 amendment was defeated on the basis
 that we did not want to single that out
 as the only or the priority response. We
 would prefer to have in this particular
 part of the bill no mention of the pro-
 posal for the discontinuing or severing
 of diplomatic relations with the PRC as
 a response. We do mention on page 6 of
 our report that this should be considered
 as one of the options, but I hope that
 the amendment will be defeated because
 I do think it would be counterproductive
 for the purposes that the gentleman
 from California (Mr. LAGOMARSINO) in-
 tends it to be.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to my col-
 league, the ranking minority member,
 the  gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr.
 BROOMFIELD), who has been helpful and
 so cooperative in preparing this legisla-
 tion and bringing it to the stage of per-
 fection it is so that we can now have it
 for consideration before the committee.
 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I
 reluctantly also rise in opposition to the
 amendment offered by my friend, the
 gentleman from California. I think that
 there is a question, a serious constitu-
 tional question, regarding this proposed
 amendment. The granting or withdraw-
 ing of recognition of a foreign govern-
 ment is a prerogative of the President of
 the United States as head of state and
 certainly does not fall in the realm of
 the Congress.
 ^ 1655
 So, therefore, I would urge the Mem-
 bers to oppose this amendment.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I yield
 back the balance of my time and call
 for a "no" vote.
 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I
 move to strike the requisite number of
 words and I rise in support of the amend-
 ment.
 Mr. Chairman, may I point out to the
 Members that they really should take a
 good look at this. Let me read just the
 opening phrase:
 Among the responses to be considered.
 The gentleman from California is not
 mandating anything. The gentleman is o.
 not tying the President's hands. The gen-
 tleman is merely Indicating that one of
 the practical responses that might be
 considered is the withdrawal of U.S.

 SEC. 201. (a) No requirement, whether ex-
 pressed or implied, under the laws of the
 United States with respect to maintenance
 of diplomatic relations or to recognition of
 a government shall apply with respect to
 Taiwan.
 (b) (1) The absence of such relations and
 such recognition shall not affect the applica-

 respect  to  Taiwan,  and  the  laws  of the
 United States (including laws relating to
 rights, obligations, standing to sue and be
 sued, legal capacity, or eligibility to par-

 that the laws of the United States applied
 with respect to Taiwan prior to January 1,

 strict  debate on  a matter  of. this
 importance.  .
 As a matter of fact, Mr_ Chairman, we
 have done very little all week. This bill
 was scheduled for Thursday, at a time
 when it is most inopportune for most
 Members who plan to leave on Thursday.
 It easily could have been considered yes-
 terday or on Tuesday or Monday.
 However, if I could get some assur-
 ances about not cutting off debate, I cer-
 tainly would not object to the reading.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. BAUMAN. Yes, I yield to the dis-
 tinguished gentleman from Wisconsin.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, the
 gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BAU-
 MAN)  knows that the gentleman from
 Wisconsin is interested in saving time.
 For that reason and that reason alone I
 asked that this title be considered as
 read and open to amendment at any
 point.
 Certainly the gentleman knows that
 the pattern I follow and my policy, as
 demonstrated today, is not to cut time
 at all. PressurE was put upon the gentle-
 man from Wisconsin by other Members
 because they want to go home tonight.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Precisely. If it was only
 the gentleman from Wisconsin of whom
 I had to ask this question, I would not
 worry so much about it; but I do think
 this issue is too important for us to jam
 it through at the end of this week's
 consideration.
 Again, if we have this many amend-
 ments. I would like some assurance that
 we will debate them fully without cut-
 ting off the time.

 Monday, by the way.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. If the gentleman will
 yield further, I might say that we have
 been on this bill for 6 hours. We have
 not jammed any part of the bill down
 the throats of anybody. We have fully
 tried to explan it and have given ample
 opportunity for debate, ample oppor-
 tunity for Members to debate amend-
 ments
 It is my understanding, Mr. Chair-
 man-and I may be in error-that the
 two major controversial amendments are
 at the end of the bill.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Will there be any
 attempt to, cut off debate?
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I will be reasonable
 about it. I do not intend to cut off debate
 unreasonably.
 Mr. BAUMAN. Mr. Chairman, I object.
 The CHAIRMAN. Objection is heard.
 The Clerk will continue the reading of
 title II.

 Mr. ZABLOCKI (during the reading).
 Mr. Chairman, on consultation with the
 gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BAT-
 MAN), my good friend and an amicable
 Member of this body, I renew the unani-
 mous-consent request that the title be
 considered as read, printed in the REC-
 ORD,  and open to amendment at any
 point.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from
 Wisconsin?
 Mr. BAUMAN. Reserving the right to
 object, the gentleman from Wisconsin
 mode the gentleman and, most of all, the
 House.
 Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reserva-
 tion of objection.
 The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection
 to the request of the gentleman from
 Wisconsin?
 There was no objection.

 The CHAIRMAN. Are there amend-
 ments to title II?
 AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY MR. QUAYLE
 Mr. QUAYLE. Mr. Chairman, I offer
 amendments, and ask unanimous consent
 'that the amendments be considered as

 The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from
 Indiana?
 There was no objection.
 The amendments are as follows:

 SEC. 202. (a) Except as the President may
 otherwise provide with respect to those types
 of dealings which are not normally conducted
 through  diplomatic  or other official  mis-
 sions-
 partners and as I have said, Mr. Chair-
 man, we have had full diplomatic rela-
 tions with Taiwan. Now, we are trying
 to reverse the situation.
 I know there will be argument saying
 that this is going to wreck the deal, this
 is going to perhaps hurt Taiwan. In the
 spirit of bipartisanship and in the spirit
 of cooperation among the branches of
 Government, we have always worked in
 concert in dealing with not only recog-
 nition of other countries but in our for-
 eign policy endeavors.
 The Shanghai Communique in 1972
 established a liaison office bn the PRC.
 Now we have decided to change our
 course in foreign policy. I think it should
 at least establish this liaison office on
 Taiwan.
 Concerning the negotiating practice
 that took place between our Govern-
 ment and the PRC, we have been told
 there was never a request to not use,
 force. We have been told there was some
 discussion of the liaison office but I
 would imagine if the President would
 tell the Vice Premier, or the proper per-
 son in the PRC that it is the will of
 Congress to have at least a liaison of-
 fice, that it just may be a reality rather
 than just a lot of talk.

 I sympathize with the gentleman's po-
 sition and understand it, but I think in
 all sincerity the amendment is unconsti-
 tutional, because we are invading the
 sole right of the President of the United
 States.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
 tleman from Indiana (Mr. QUAYLE) has
 expired.
 (By unanimous consent, Mr. QUAYLE
 was allowed to proceed for 1 additional
 minute.)
 Mr. QUAYLE. Mr. Chairman, I would
 just say that I am not a constitutional
 lawyer, but I would say that we have
 always worked in cooperation with the
 executive in these particular areas. The
 Senate passed a resolution by a vote of
 94 to 0 that there should be some sort of
 consultation concerning what to do with
 Taiwan.
 There has been a discussion of a liaison
 office, and I think if the Congress works
 its will and a provision for a liaison office
 is put on the President's desk, it could
 become a reality.
 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield further, regardless
 of the discussions, we cannot change the
 Constitution of the United States. It says
 what it says. We have to live by it here in
 Congress, as well as elsewhere.
 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 Mr. QUAYLE. Mr. Chairman, I would
 just say that throughout the course of
 debate in the committee the constitu-
 tional aspect was never raised.
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
 in oposition to the amendment.
 Mr. Chairman, this identical amend-
 ment was introduced and considered in
 committee during the markup, and it was
 defeated by a vote of 12 to 5.
 Now, I fully realize that a committee
 action is not necessarily an action to be
 followed by the full House. But the com-
 mittee has studied this issue very care-
 fully, and I must say this, Mr. Chairman,
 as to the amendment offered by the gen-
 tleman from Indiana (Mr. QUAYLE), with
 whom I would have some sympathy on
 his proposal:
 Indeed, Mr. Chairman, if I were called
 for counsel by the executive branch prior
 to the negotiation agreement, I would
 have expressed my preference that we
 have a relationship with the Republic
 of China on the basis of a liaison office,
 while having full diplomatic relations
 with the PRC. We would then follow,
 as we did for 7 years with the PRC, and
 have relations with the ROC with a
 liaison office. But I was not consulted,
 and the situation has been negotiated
 Today we have Just two choices: either
 we have the opportunity to take the steps
 and approve a bill which would continue
 our U.S. relations with Taiwan and with
 the people on Taiwan, as they had been
 prior to January 1, 1979, but on a non-
 governmental basis; or we would not
 pass this legislation and not give the
 President the authority to continue these
 activities with Taiwan. If we did accept
 the gentleman's amendment, we must
 remember that the committee, as the
 gentleman well knows, was told by the

 The only quarrel that we have, some
 concern that Members of the Congress
 have, is that it should not be done at the
 expense and should not have been done
 at the expense of Taiwan and the people
 of Taiwan. In order that it will not be
 done at the expense of the people of
 Taiwan, is why we have this legislation.
 This change from an entity to a liaison
 office is both provocative and unneces-
 sary. The legislation as now constituted
 would allow us to operate through the
 American institute in Taiwan in an en-
 tirely acceptable manner. Taiwan has
 agreed to set up its counterpart orga-
 nization to handle its business here. Let
 us not disrupt the proceedings and the
 arrangements as they are now and which
 appear to be workable.
 Mr. Chairman, I hope the amendment
 will be defeated.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of ? the

 BLOCKI)  has expired.

 Mr. ZABLOCKI. I yield to the gentle-

 Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I
 would also like to add appreciation to
 the chairman of our committee for his
 leadership. I consider this one of the
 most controversial amendments  that
 will be offered on this bill. I happen to
 believe that, had the gentleman from
 Wisconsin (Mr. ZABLOCKI) and myself
 at least been asked for our advice prior
 to normalization, both of us would have
 insisted on a liaison office for Taiwan.
 This was not done. I can assure all the
 Members  that  their  committee, has
 worked very, very hard, in the absence
 of this liaison office, to do everything we
 possibly could to protect the interests of
 the people of Taiwan, and I think that
 the bill, as it has been presented here
 with the amendments, is an excellent
 piece of legislation.
 Again, I think that had the admin-
 istration afforded some of the Members
 who are in support of foreign affairs an
 opportunity to express themselves in
 consultation before normalization, pos-
 sibly some of these issues could have

 Ms. HOLTZMAN. I am more than hap-

 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Chairman, may I
 say to the gentlewoman that the com-
 mittee has studied this matter and did
 seek counsel. Indeed, it has obtained
 counsel or advice from some of the most
 prestigiou$ legal firms here in Washing-
 ton and elsewhere, not specifically on the
 issue of constitutionality, but on the
 creation of this entity which would con-
 tinue relations, exchanges, and activities
 between the United States and Taiwan.

 Mr. ZABLOCKI. If the gentlewoman
 will yield further, I will say no, the term
 "defense services or defense articles"
 does not authorize the use of force to aid
 Taiwan.
 The definition, as intended in the law,
 would be the same as the definition of
 "defense articles and defense services"
 as contained in section 47 of the Arms
 Export Control Act. That definition is as
 follows:
 "defense article", except as provided in
 paragraph (7) of this section, includes-
 (A) any weapon, weapons system, muni-
 tion, aircraft, vessel, boat, or other Imple-

 (B) any property, installation, commodity,
 material, equipment, supply, or goods used -

 (C) any machinery, facility, tool, mate-

 manufacture, production, processing, repair,

 in this paragraph, and

 March 8, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSIB
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman, I
 rise in strong support of the Quayle
 amendment. I have the highest respect
 for the chairman of the committee, the
 chairman of the subcommittee, as I
 pointed out earlier, and, obviously, the
 ranking Republican member on the com-
 mittee. But I must say that maybe if I
 were in their place, I would feel differ-
 ently about this, but I am not. If they,
 are not outraged about what happened
 to them-to all of us, but particularly
 to them-in the leadership positions they
 hold, I am outraged for them.
 The law that was passed by this Con-
 gress last year, the international Secu-
 rity Assistance Act, very clearly points
 out what the President was supposed to
 do. Let me read to the Members section
 26.
 The Congress finds that-
 (1) the continued security and stability
 of East Asia is a matter of major strategic
 interests to the United States;
 (2) the United States and the Republic of
 China have for a period of twenty-four years
 been linked together by the Mutual Defense
 Treaty of 1954;
 (3) the Republic of China has during that
 twenty-four-year period faithfully and con-
 tinually carried out its duties and obliga-
 tions under that treaty; and
 (4) it is the responsibility of the Senate
 to give its advice and consent to treaties en-
 tered into by the United States.
 (b) It is the sense of the Congress that
 there should be prior consultation between
 the Congress and the executive branch on
 any proposed policy changes affecting the
 continuation in force of the Mutual Defense
 Treaty of 1954.
 In my opinion-and there really was
 not a very good defense of this bill by
 administration witnesses-there was no
 such consultation. I think one member
 of our committee said he had been con-
 sulted satisfactorily in his opinion. The
 chairman said he was not. As a matter
 of fact, he made the comment that the
 last consultation or talk about the situa-
 tion was when he was told that the
 whole situation was on the back burner-
 his exact words: "On the back burner."
 The gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
 BROOMFIELD)  said the same thing. I
 know that I was never consulted as a
 member of the committee.
 The question is, What are we going to
 do about it? We 'can roll over. We can
 say, "Oh, gee, that is too bad.,If we had
 been consulted, we would have said so
 and so."
 We have a duty to perform. We have
 our role and function as an equal branch
 of this Government. I think one thing
 we can do is to provide what we would
 have done had we been consulted. I think
 there is little doubt that had we been
 consulted, we would have at least recom-
 mended a liaison office. All we are doing
 is turning around what the situation was
 before December 15 when we recognized
 the ROC and had a liaison officer in
 Peking.
 Let me point out one other thing.
 Right now we have an intersection, a
 formal, official Government body, Gov-
 ernment personnel on the Government
 payroll-there is no question about it-
 in Cuba-in Cuba. Just a week ago the
 President reiterated his opposition to re-
 newing normal diplomatic relations with
 Cuba while they had troops running all
 over Africa. Here we are treating our
 friends, our longtime friends on Taiwan,
 in a different sort of a way.
 It has been pointed out that Taiwan
 has set up an institute. That is true.
 They have set up an institute, and my
 understanding is they did it, because
 they were told if they did not do that, if
 they did not go along with this bill, they
 would get nothing.
 ? Mr. Chairman, are we going to be put
 in a position of being blackmailed, or
 are we going to do what we think is
 right? We might not think it is right to
 have a liaison office, fine. Vote that way,
 then. But certainly if we think it is the
 right thing to do, we should vote that
 way and let the administration know.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. LAGOMARSINO. I yield to the
 gentleman from New York.
 Mr. WOLFF. I thank the gentleman
 for yielding.
 I would just like to add to a couple of
 points the opposed to what gentleman
 the  dminiist made.   did
 in the timely fashion it did. However, we
 are faced with circumstances that are
 virtually unalterable.
 I might say on the question of the in-
 tercession we have in Cuba, that is with
 a Swiss embassy, and it is not a separate
 entity. That is point No. 1. Second, on the
 question of the Mutual Defense Treaty,
 and the ability of the President to ter-
 minate that treaty and the statement
 that the gentleman from California
 made, this is a statement from the
 Georgetown Law Center:
 0 1755
 Recognition of the People's Republic of
 China, as that of any other nation, is an
 exclusive function of the Presidency beyond
 the reach of the Congress.
 Mr. KELLY. I move to strike the req-
 uisite number of words and I rise in sup-
 port of the amendment.
 Mr. Chairman, I find this is another
 one of those junctures where it is im-
 portant to try to get some perspective on
 what is going on here.
 There can be no doubt, Mr. Chairman,
 that the interests of the United States
 are really what is being debated here.
 It is oftentimes sidetracked with some
 reference to the fact that what we need
 to do is, we need to do what is in the best
 interest of Taiwan and we must keep our
 word to Taiwan.
 It has been mentioned here several
 times that there is some question about
 what the United States would do in the
 event there was an attack on Taiwan.
 The groundwork is being laid here right
 now by what we are doing to be certain
 that the United States will do nothing.
 As the situation exists right now the
 Government of the United States by its
 joint communique has acknowledged the
 Chinese position that there is but one
 China and that Taiwan is part of that
 China.
 Mr. Chairman, I can hear the argu-
 ment right now that really we should
 not do anything about the military at-
 tack on Taiwan by the Communist Chi-
 nese, we should not in any way do
 anything about an economic blockade
 12197
 to try to starve and strangle to death
 the free Chinese on Taiwan, because it is
 an internal matter, it is a matter purely
 to be controlled by the Chinese Govern-
 ment in Peking. That will come later.
 Clearly we have a situation in the
 Western Pacific where our defenses are
 involved. What is at stake here is not
 the security of Taiwan for the sake of
 the people on Taiwan, it is not to try
 and maintain our commitment and our
 credibility in the world, but we are a
 Pacific nation. Our 50th State is 3,000
 miles into the Pacific. The Aleutian
 Islands, a part of Alaska, extend into
 the Pacific for hundreds of miles. Much
 of our seacoast is in the Pacific.
 Mr. Chairman, if we do not at this time
 establish that the U.S. Government has
 a right to deal with Taiwan as a free
 nation, if we do not do that right now,
 the time will have passed when we can
 ever do it. If we do not do that then
 clearly the argument is going to be that
 any altercation between mainland China
 and Taiwan is an internal matter.
 The security of the United States de-
 pends upon a string of defenses that
 includes North Korea, Japan, Okinawa,
 Taiwan, and the Philippines. No invasion
 force can move into the Pacific area if
 it must go by that string of defenses..
 ^ 1800
 If we lose Taiwan, the defensive line
 is compromised. So what we are dealing
 with is the defense interest of the
 United States of America. ' We are not
 primarily concerned with what is in the
 best interests of Taiwan; we are right
 now trying to maintain that we have a
 right to have an interest and a flex-
 ibility in our foreign policy to do what
 is in our best interest with regard to
 the Taiwan question.
 Mr. Chairman, by doing what the
 President has done, all we are going to
 do is give over the options to the Com-
 munists, and that is not in the interest
 of the people.
 Mr. LIVINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I
 move to strike the requisite number of
 words, and I rise in support of the
 amendments.
 (Mr. LIVINGSTON asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. LIVINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I
 rise in support of the amendment offered
 by the gentleman from Indiana to estab-
 lish an official U.S. liaison office on
 Taiwan.
 Mr. Chairman, the decision last De-
 cember by the administration to sud-
 denly recognize mainland China came
 without the consultation of Congress and
 its accompanying action, and, in my
 opinion, was just a simple case of the
 United States giving our faithful ally,
 Taiwan, a good "kick in the pants."
 Mr. Chairman, I realize the present
 and future importance of the People's
 Republic of China in international af-
 fairs. There is no doubt that open rela-
 tions with China will result in increased
 economic activity in the United States
 which will ultimately be beneficial in re-
 ducing our present trade deficit. How-
 ever, the fact-of the matter remains that
 in reaching an agreement with China

 our administration simply did some bad
 "horse trading."
 With the Soviet Union at China's front
 door, Russian support of Vietnam's mili-

 the great desire by China for American
 technology, the administration concluded
 an agreement with the People's Republic

 rity, and, most importantly, disruptgd
 the confidence other countries had in the
 American alliance system. It seems that
 the forsaking of bonds with our loyal
 allies is typical of the confusion which
 has beset this administration's foreign
 policy since it entered office in 1977.
 The establishment of a liaison office on
 Taiwan is-the least the United States can
 do to clearly demonstrate to Taiwan and
 the rest of the free world, America's com-
 mitment to a philosophy of government
 that insures economic and political free-
 dom for all.
 Mr. Chairman, we have heard many
 arguments that this bill is in effect a
 fait accompli, that we should take it or
 leave it. I understand the problems and
 the pressures upon the distinguished
 chairman of this committee and upon
 the ranking minority member, but it
 seems to me that this committee is called
 upon to offer constructive amendments
 to correct what would otherwise be a
 very-and it will be-regretful moment
 and episode in American history.
 For these reasons, Mr. Chairman, I be-
 lieve it is imperative that the House ap-
 prove the amendment offered by the
 gentleman from Indiana (Mr. QUAYLE),
 and I urge the committee to give it its
 support.
 Mr. MATTOX. Mr. Chairman, I move
 to strike the requisite number of words,
 and I rise in support of the amendments.
 (Mr. MATTOX asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. MATTOX. Mr. Chairman, let me
 say to the Members that I very seldom
 take the well to speak, but as a Democrat
 I rise in support of this amendment.
 I would like to associate myself with
 the words of the gentlewoman from New
 York when she was speaking about the
 disgrace over the way the United States
 is about to conduct its relationships.
 I have heard Members stand up today
 and beat their chests and tell about
 their friendship for Taiwan, but let me
 say that my mother used to tell me,
 "You have to test a man's friendship.
 When all the cards are against you,
 and you know when it is really hard to
 fight back. Today Members have been
 saying, "All of us are friends, but what
 they are really saying is "we don't want
 to fight back right now."
 Let me tell you this: "You are not
 much of friends if you don't fight back
 when the going gets tough". That is the
 test. It is a real test. -
 I was listening to one of the speakers
 awhile ago talk in terms of how we want
 to maintain our dignity with the people
 of Taiwan.

 It seems to me that we are in a signifi-
 cant stage in world history. It will now
 be possible to provide support for a long-
 time ally, the Taiwanese, in the face of
 a changed world situation, and simul-
 taneously to proceed with fostering a
 new friendship with the People's Republic
 of China. The two friendships need not be
 mutually exclusive.
 However gropingly, Mr. Speaker, our
 country has taken an important step
 into the future.
 Let us not undermine it by passing this
 amendment.,
 .  ^ 1810
 Mr.  SKELTON.  Mr.  Chairman, .1
 move to strike the last word.
 (Mr. SKELTON asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, if this
 were a matter of friendship, that would
 be one thing. If this would be a matter
 ? of expressing dignity, that would be
 another. However, those are not the is-
 sues before us today. The strength of
 our friendship and the strong feelings
 we have for those who live in Taiwan is
 not the issue before us. We have heard
 many moving and persuasive' debates to-
 day, but I think the thing we should look
 at is the bill we have before us and the
 amendment we have before us, and the
 Constitution  that we  are sworn to
 uphold.
 The Constitution gives the sole and ex-
 clusive right to receive Ambassadors to
 the President of the United States, not
 to the Congress. Were we, any one of us
 or all of us collectively, to be the Presi-
 dent and to make that decision, it might
 have been a different one, but the Presi-
 dent has chosen in his sole and exclusive
 right not to receive an Ambassador. The
 extension of that right, of course, is not
 to have a liaison office or an Embassy in
 Taiwan. Consequently, the ball game is
 not in that court.
 ^ 1815
 The ball game is whether we accept the
 bill before us.
 I say this, Mr. Chairman, that if we
 are truly friends of. Taiwan, we should
 accept this bill because it is the only
 thing which the administration backs.
 It is the only thing which the admin-
 istration will accept.
 We are not in a position to choose
 whether there should be a liaison office
 or an Embassy. We are here to do the
 only thing we can under law.
 If we are their friend, we defeat this
 amendment and pass this bill. If we are
 not their friend, we adopt this amend-
 ment because if we adopt this amend-
 ment, the whole bill goes down the drain.
 Then we have no relations with them.
 We have no way to give them defensive
 arms. We have no way to have cultural
 relations with them. We have no way to
 have any type of communications with
 them whatsoever.
 Consequently,  Mr.  Chairman,  our
 choice boils down to having to vote
 against this amendment.
 Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. SKELTON. I yield to the gentle-
 man from Illinois.
 Mr. HYDE. Mr. Chairman, would the
 gentleman agree that it was really in-
 cumbent upon the President, if not le-
 gally binding, that he consult with Con-
 gress before this package of commit-
 ments and withdrawals - was finalized
 with the mainland Chinese?
 Mr. SKELTON. Of course, that does
 not say that he consult with every Mem-
 ber of Congress.
 Mr. HYDE. Perhaps the chairman of
 this committee.
 Mr. SKELTON. I understand he did
 consult with some Members of Congress.
 Who they were I cannot specifically say,
 but I do know that he did consult with
 some Members.
 Mr. HYDE. If the gentleman will yield
 further, I would suggest that by passing
 this amendment we are providing him
 with advice and consent and the views of
 this body, which he neglected to seek in
 December because we were not in session,
 that we prefer a- liaison office. That
 would leave him isolated then, suggest-
 ing that we have this quasi, semi, pseudo
 corporation  represent  America  over
 there, but then the issue will be starkly
 drawn, and he will have the benefit of
 our advice and consent.
 If he wishes to veto it, then we will
 have to consider it at that time.
 Mr. SKELTON. The gentleman is say-
 ing that the bill says something other
 than what it does. The President does
 not ask us for our advice and consent.
 Mr. HYDE. But he should.
 Mr. SKELTON. The law says that he
 should consult Members of Congress,
 which he did.
 Mr. HYDE. If the gentleman will yield
 further, he may accede to the wisdom
 of our collective judgment that we should
 at least give Taiwan what we gave the
 People's Republic of China under the
 Shanghai Communique.
 Mr. SKELTON. Were I the President
 of the United States, my decisions might
 well be different, but I am not.
 Mr. HYDE. I hope the gentleman will
 be some day. .
 Mr. SKELTON. It was the President's
 decision not to choose to have a liaison
 office there. We have nowhere to go ex-
 cept to defeat this amendment.
 Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chair-
 man, I move to strike the requisite num-
 ber of words, and I rise in support of the
 amendments.
 (Mr. SENSENBRENNER asked and
 was given permission to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chair-
 man, I rise in support of the amendment
 offered by the gentleman from Indiana
 (Mr. QUAYLE).    .
 Adoption of this amendment is essen-
 tial if the United States is to maintain
 the same relationship with the govern-
 ment of the Republic of China on Taiwan
 as it did with the Peoples Republic of
 China before January 1.
 Our country maintained a liaison office
 in Peking for several years before Presi-
 dent Carter decided to normalize rela-
 tions with the Peoples Republic of China.
 With the upgrading of the office in
 Peking to embassy status, the American
 people expect that our Government will
 treat the Taiwanese Government no dif-
 ferently under our new relationship that
 it treated the Peking Government under
 our former relationship.
 Administrations of both political par-
 ties saw nothing wrong in establishing
 and maintaining a U.S. governmental
 presence in Peking through the liaison
 office. All the arguments in support of
 that office-that it was necessary to im-
 prove political, cultural and trade rela-
 tions-apply with respect to opening a
 liaison office in Taipei.
 Mr. Chairman, fair is fair. What.was
 fair to Peking before normalization of
 relations with the Peoples Republic of
 China should also be fair to Taiwan
 under the present circumstances. Adop-
 tion of this amendment can prove this
 country's good faith to the people of
 Taiwan in a meaningful way.
 ^ 1820
 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Chairman, I move
 to strike the requisite number of words.
 Mr. Chairman, this is a critical amend-
 ment, but it is tough for many of us to
 get up in the well of the House and dis-
 cuss this matter because it puts us in
 awkward contradiction with some of our
 very esteemed and respected colleagues.
 I might mention I have the deepest
 regard for the chairman of the Foreign
 Relations Committee. I think he has
 done an admirable job under the pres-
 sures that are on him from all sides. And
 I have the deepest respect for those other
 ranking members of the committee on
 both sides who are also operating under
 great pressure.
 But, more important, I have a great
 deal of concern about the inadequacy of
 this legislation.
 This legislation without the amend-
 ment, Mr. Chairman, is similar in anal-
 ogy to attempting to rescue a drowning
 man with a rowboat that is tied to the
 dock. We are operating under impossi-
 ble restraint and that is just about as
 successful as we are going to be in doing
 anything for the people on Taiwan with
 this kind of legislation. I think that their
 enemies know this, and they are en-
 couraging this weak-kneed approach.
 We need to do something to repair this
 situation, and this is the time to do it.
 I am convinced that a terrible tragedy
 is about to occur unless we act now and
 act decisively. The case is at hand; it is
 not for us to decide next year or the year
 after. Are we going to prevent 17 million
 free people, who have fled and fought
 communism, from being forced back into
 its very jaws?
 Let me tell the Members, Mr. Chair-
 man, when I was in Taiwan recently I
 interviewed some refugees from the
 mainland. If the Members of this Body
 do not think this is serious business, let
 me recite a couple of interviews.
 There was one young fellow, 22 years
 old, who, in trying. to get away from
 communism and the so-called blessings
 that some seem to extoll on the mainland,
 swam the Straits into Hong Kong. It
 is a hard 4-hour swim which only one
 out of ten survives. Escaping is no easy
 thing personally or for your family. His
 brother was beheaded and his mother was
 starved to death. That was the penalty

 CREATING INTERNATIONAL DEVEL-
 OPMENT COOPERATION ADMINIS-
 TRATION-MESSAGE FROM THE
 PRESIDENT  OF  THE  UNITED
 STATES (H. DOC. NO. 96-70)
 The SPEAKER laid before the House
 the following message from the President
 of the United States; which was read
 and referred to the Committee on For-
 eign Affairs and ordered to be printed:
 To the Congress of the United States:
 As required by Title III of the Inter-
 national Development and Food Assist-
 ance Act of 1978, I am writing to inform
 you of the steps I have taken and pro-
 pose to take to strengthen the coordina-
 tion of U.S. economic policies affecting
 developing countries.
 I propose to create an International
 Development Cooperation Administra-
 tiorl (IDCA) as an independent agency
 within the executive branch. The IDCA ,.
 Director would report both to me and to
 the Secretary of State, and would serve
 as our principal. internatlonal develop-
 ment advisor. The Director would re-
 ceive guidance concerning the foreign
 policy of the U.S. from the Secretary of
 State. He would submit his budget to
 the Office of Management and Budget
 after consulting with the Secretary.
 The principal responsibilities of the
 IDCA Director would be to ensure that
 the varied instruments by which the
 U.S. contributes to development abroad
 are utilized effectively and in concert,
 and that the efforts of U.S. bilateral
 programs and those of the multilateral
 development institutions are comple-
 mentary. To carry out those responsibili-
 ties, the IDCA Director would establish
 and control the budgets and policies of
 IDCA's several component agencies, and
 make recommendations to me concern-
 ing the appointment and removal of sen-
 ior officials of each component. IDCA
 would contain:
 -The Agency for International De- '
 velopment.
 -The Overseas Private Investment
 Corporation, of whose Board of Di-
 rectors the IDCA Director would be-
 come Chairman.
 -A new Institute for Technological
 Cooperation designed to promote
 scientific and technological research
 in the developing countries, which
 I have proposed through legislative
 amendment.
 In addition:
 -Lead responsibility for policy and
 budget for our voluntary contribu-
 tions to the following international
 organizations will be transferred to
 IDCA: UN Development Program;
 UNICEF; OAS Technical Assistance
 Funds; ? UN Capital Development
 Fund; UN Educational and Train-
 ing Program for Southern Africa;
 UN/FAO  World  Food  Program;
 FAO Post Harvest Losses Fund;
 and UN Disaster Relief Organiza-
 tion.
 -Existing arrangements with regard
 to  the multilateral development
 banks (MDBs) would be modified
 so that the Secretary of the Treas-
 ury will consult with the IDCA Di-
 rector in the selection of candidates
 for the U.S. Executive Director and
 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050013-8
