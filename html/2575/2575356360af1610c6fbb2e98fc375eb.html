 SECRET
 The Sino-Soviet Controversy in Cuba and
 Other Latin American Countries,
 Since 1952, and particularly since 1956, Chinese
 Communist influence on Latin American CPs has been
 apparent in the formulation of programs and policies geared
 to the strategy of the "united democratic front of national
 l.iberationP'. Procedures such as the systematic analysis of
 economic and political, groupings and their potentials for
 Communist exploitation in a struggle against the most im-
 portant common enemy (US imperialism) reflect the appli-
 cation of tactics recommended by Mao Tse-tung.  These
 tactics arp described in Mao's writings, such as "Tactical
 Problems in the United Anti-Japanese Front", which since
 1956 have been translated into Spanish for distribution and
 study in Latin America.  Mao's works., as well as those of
 Lui Shao-ch'i and probably other Chinese Communist leaders,
 have also been used in the training courses arranged for Latin
 Americans by the Communist Party of China (CPC).  These
 courses have emphasized the agrarian base of the Chinese
 revolution, the techniques of clandestine party organization
 and action}, and the history and success of the armed conflict
 in the long drawn-out struggle against the Kuomintang and
 the Japanese,
 It is apparent that the Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union (CPSU) encouraged the Latin American CPs to avail
 themselves of the lessons of the Chinese revolution, in view
 of the similarity of political, economic, and social condi- ..
 tions in China and Latin America (i. e. , existence of foreign
 economic imperialism, feudalistic survivals in rural life,
 and a generally low level of industrial development).  For
 example, the Brazilian CP program formulated in 1953-54

 ~-

 under CPSU guidance reflected certain points emphasized in
 Chinese tactics, and in mid-1955 Latin American CPs began
 to acknowledge the importance of the Chinese revolution in
 their programmatic documents.  In early 1956 the Twentieth
 CPSU Congress gave official recognition to the doctrine of
 many roads to Socialism, and increased attention began to
 be paid to the Chinese experience (in contrast to that of the
 Soviets and the European satellites) as illustrative of progress
 from "semi-feudal, semi-colonial forms" toward Socialism.
 Thus the Costa Rican CP, after studying Manuel Mora's re-
 port on the XX CPSU Congress, passed a resolution which
 quoted the Soviet Manual of Political Economy on the impor-
 tance of the Chinese revolution.  While in Moscow, Latin
 American delegates to the Twentieth CPSU Congress were
 invited to China, where in the spring and summer of 1956
 they participated in seminars and tours.  Later in the year
 many Latin American CP leaders attended the Eighth Congress
 of the CPC as fraternal representatives.  Since 1956, the
 training of Latin American CP members in China has been
 placed on an organized and permanent basis, cultural exchanges
 have grown, - and Chinese theoretical and propaganda publica-
 tions have been translated and increasingly disseminated in
 Spanish.
 This gradually increasing emphasis on the study,of
 the Chinese experience has developed with the concurrence
 and support of the CPSU.  Yet with the development of per-
 sonal contacts between the Latin Americans and the Chinese,
 some indications of Sino -Soviet rivalry and disagreement also
 appeared.  Thus one of the first Latin American students to
 return from a CPC training school was told, in 1958, by Latin
 American specialists of the CPSU, that Chinese plans for
 communes were "too early and too risky. "  The student noted
 that these specialists were more conciliatory with respect to
 Tito than were the Chinese and that they regarded some Chin-
 ese claims as exaggerated and, by innuendo, played them down.
 The Soviets were keenly interested in the students' impressions
 of the CPC course, and indicated that they also were considering

 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200250003-8
 a CPSU for Latinmericans alone.  On the other hand, the
 student noted that-the Chinese, who were intensely interested
 in Latin America, had indicated disagreement with the Soviets
 on a number of points (the denigration of Stalin and certain
 Soviet industrial methods), and had shown a fundamental be-
 lief in the inevitability of war with the USA.
 A year later, another Latin American CP member
 returning from a similar CPC training course noted that one
 lecturer had stated that for the Chinese, there was no revolu-
 tion in which arms were not used, thereby disagreeing with
 the pacifist policy ,of the USSR.  This was the only indication
 of disagreement-with respect to international policy which he
 noticed, however, and he found the Chinese in general to be
 "very cautious" in mentioning other parties, emphasizing that
 "each country has its own peculiarities. "
 In general, it appears that prior to 1960, Sino-Soviet
 differences-were not being emphasized to Latin Americans,
 made little impression on them, and did not, in themselves,
 cause friction or factionalism within the Latin American par -
 ties.  In some -cases, however, internal policy differences of
 long standing have run parallel to the international conflict,
 and have become identified with it as the Sino-Soviet dispute
 has sharpened and as the Soviets and Chinese have sought to
 develop support for their points of view.  Now that the dispute
 has been discussed and publicized at international meetings,
 and is more generally understood, it is possible that there will
 be a greater tendency for elements within the Latin American
 parties to interpret or identify their own views with those of
 the Soviets or the Chinese.
 Of all the Latin American CPs, the Cuban CP
 (Partido Socialista Popular, PSP) has been most deeply
 concerned with the Sino-Soviet controversy, because it bears

 on the party's own conflict with Fidel Castro and the 26th of
 July Movement.  This conflict extends back to 1956, when
 the PSP officially established its policies concerning the
 armed struggle in Cuba.  These were announced in a mani-
 festo of September 1956 entitled "The Road of the People:
 August 1933. "  This stated that "we are not proponents of
 violence for its own sake, nor do we believe that violence is
 the only path... but when the despotic government... blocks
 the electoral path and seeks to maintain itself by force, there
 is not other remedy than extraparliamentary action, that is,
 the direct struggle of the masses. " However, it also pointed
 out that "the experience of 1930-33, when the putsch of Aguado,
 the mob assault of Rio Verde, the landing of Gibara, and the
 assault on the barracks of San Luis all failed, and when the
 general strike and the uprising of the masses in August 1933
 triumphed; the experience of all revolutions and of all strug-
 gles for liberty; all such experience indicates that the correct,
 the best, and the most rapid--and the most secure and most
 popular--(course) is that proposed by the Party of the Cuban
 Revolution, the Popular Socialist Party:  the development of
 the struggle of the masses and its culmination in a new August,
 in a powerful general strike and a decisive general uprising.... "
 In the September 1956 manifesto the PSP referred
 to the unsuccessful attack on the Moncada barracks (which
 resulted in Castro's imprisonment in 1953) as "desperate
 and sterile".   Later in the year, in the official party
 It has subsequently been reported that when the 26th of
 July Movement was being organized in Mexico (about
 1955-56) the Communists had sought, with the support
 of Raul Castro, to influence Fidel to abandon his plans
 for armed invasion of Cuba.  When these efforts did not
 succeed, they_i instructed Raul to continue to go along
 with Fidel's plans.

 theoretical organ Fundamentos, * the party paid even more
 attention to the Fidelista movement:
 "The 26th of July Movement raised the banner
 of insurrection at a predetermined place and without
 relation to the struggle of the masses... it recently
 introduced the idea of the general strike into its tac-
 tical concepts, but in an erroneous sense:  only as an
 instrument of insurrection and not--as should be the
 case --as an element in the development of the mass
 struggle which may be followed, in certain cases, by
 an armed insurrection.
 "Insurrection, moreover, is not a game.  It
 is a very complicated and serious tactical procedure
 which should not be used... except under determined
 conditions.  Otherwise, in most cases, insurrection
 will be no more than a putsch.
 "... Lacking such conditions, it is indispensa-
 ble that every true revolutionary contribute to the
 patient and 'gray' task of elevating the conscience
 of the vanguard.... "
 A year later, at the special conference of Latin
 American Communist party leaders $ld in Moscow in November
 1957, the PSP still opposed Castro's tactics and his disinclina-
 tion to unite with the PSP or to follow its line.  The Cuban;irep-
 resentative to this meeting noted that the sabotage of sugar cane
 In the same issue of Fundamentos, the significance of the
 Chinese experience was described in an article entitled
 "Desde Pekin", by an anonymous author (possibly Cesar
 Escalante Dellunde, who is known to have been a delegate
 to the VIII CPC Congress and who probably participated
 in seminars in China).

 (a. 26th of July tactic under the direction of Rene Ramos Latour,
 known as "Daniel") was an unpopular, sectarian action which
 lacked sympathy among the workers, and that although the PSP
 had ."attempted to guide the Fillelistas", the latter had not
 wanted to participate in coordinated mass action.
 Intellectual leaders of the 26th of July Movement took
 notice of the Communist criticisms and, in turn, sought to
 establish their own ideological position.  One of these leaders
 was Armando Hart Davalos, then clandestine coordinator of
 the movement and currently Minister of Education.  Hart's ideas
 were published (after the rebel victory) in a commemorative.1ssire
 of Revolucion (26 July 1959) under the title "Justification of the
 Revolution and the Strategy against the Dictatorship, November
 1956. "  Hart made the following points:
 "On occasions, the revolution follows the course
 of pacifism.  We do not deny that theoretically and under
 certain circumstances this may be the adequate path.,..
 But possibly the most important experience that the new
 generation has learned has been that the revolution, at
 any moment and under any circumstance, must be pre
 pared for direct action....
 "The 26th of July Movement represented a real
 categorical ansrer to this revolutionary need, not a
 theoretical speculation....
 "Opposed to it were those who spoke of peace.
 The external difference, apparently, between our line
 of conduct =end that of the other organizations and par-
 ties, was that we publicly proclaimed the need for vio-
 lence and the others advocated pacifist solutions.  On
 the surface this appears to be a mere strategic discrep-
 ancy, but has, nevertheless, its origin in a fundamental
 ideological discrepancy."
 By identifying the 26th of July Movement as the only
 group which advocated armed action, Hart obviously places the

 Communists with those advocating peaceful solutions.  He argues
 further that the purpose of violent action is not that of simple
 military victory, but is that of creating discontent, dissatisfac-
 tion, and opposition of such dimensions that the government will
 be unable to maintain itself in pourer.  Thus by provoking the
 dictatorship to increased brutality and terrorism the public
 reaction is created which assures the dictator's overthrow.  A
 quite similar point of view is held by Ernesto ("Che") Guevara,
 who lists among the "fundamental contributions" of the Cuban
 revolution the proof that "it is not always necessary to wait for
 the fulfillment of all of the conditions for the revolution; the focus
 of insurrection can create them".
 The existence of what Hart refers to as a "fundamental
 ideological discrepancy" between the Fidelistas and the Commun-
 ists during the Sierra campaign is also indicated in a letter which
 was reportedly taken from Hart when he was arrested by the Cuban
 army in early 1958.  The letter, unsigned and apparently meant
 for "Che", * states in part:
 "you have been rude as well as unjust.  For you to be
 lieve that we are rightists or that we come from the
 petty Cuban bourgeoisie, or rather that we represent
 Possibly "Che" Guevara, who may have been an advocate
 of cooperation with the Communists, with whom he had
 been associated.  Although recently appearing to favor the
 Chinese line, "Che" had been a member of the Russian-
 Mexican Cultural Institute in Mexico and his wife had been
 closely associated with Soviet military intelligence agents.
 It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that "Che" may, at
 this time, have been seeking to guide the Fidelistas in
 terms of the orthodox CP line favoring unity and mass ac
 tion.  It is interesting that the letter refers to a copy of
 another letter, written by "Che'' to "Daniel", which had
 been received (apparently by Hart) and which introduced the
 subject of "Che's" "legitimate doctrinal worries".  "Daniel",
 in the end of 1957, had been placed in charge of the sabotage
 of the sugar harvest.

 it... does not surprise me. .. since it is in line with
 your interpretation of the, historical proceedings of the
 Russian revolution....  We have had no other course
 to follow, because your leaders perpetrated the formid-
 able outburst of 1917... but left the peoples located out-
 side that country without the opportunity to unchain a
 universal revolution....  The fatality of all this is that
 Stalin was not French, or English, or German, and
 was therefore unable to overcome the limited viewpoint
 of a Russian leader.  .. . If there can exist discrepancies
 between us over the international aspect of revolutionary
 politics, I consider myself among the more radical
 ones....."
 There are indications that the author of the above letter,
 who was probably Hart himself, did not consider himself to be
 a spokesman for Fidel but rather a member of a group whose
 goals were in accordk.with Fidel's.  This may have been a re-
 established Trotskyist group, inasmuch as the author states
 "do not ever identify me with persons who have dominated the
 CTC (Cuban Confederation of Labor) for the past 25 years"
 (i. e. , the Trotskyists of the 1930's who founded the CTC but
 later became identified with Batista). In. any event, the letter
 strongly suggests the existence within the 26th of July Movement
 of a dissident Communist element which condemned Stalin and
 Stalinism as opposed to the extension of the world revolution.
 It is possible that the same distrust of the "limited viewpoint of
 a Russian leader" may have later been. applied to Khrushchev's
 conciliatory attitude. toward the West.
 It isfinterest that a new Trotskyist party, which claimed
 to have had founding members among Fidel Castro's inva-
 sion force of 1956, was founded on 6 February 1960 in Guan-
 tanamo, Cuba.  The party has not identified its, leaders.
 (See The Internationalist, vol. IV, nos. 6, 7, 8; March 15,
 April 1, l5, 1960) In November 1960, an article in the Com-
 munist-controlled Italian newspaper Il Paese described four
 "currents" within the Cuban Revolution, one of which it called
 the "Trotskyist current", which it linked with extremism and
 the Chinese mode]..

 Beginning in March 1958, the PSP began to admit that
 the Castro movement had become a "movement of the masses"
 and that it was appropriate to support it actively in the field.
 Through, the PSP organizational and material aid was given
 Castro, and CP members were encouraged to apply the lessons
 of the Chinese revolution with respect to work in rural areas
 and within the rebel forces.  Nevertheless,  distrust
 between the PSP and the Fidelistas continued even after the
 agreements for collaboration which were worked out in 1958.
 During the early months of the Castro regime there were
 numerous evidences of Fidel's distrust of the PSP and his de-
 termination to hold it in check.  Undoubtedly, this distrust
 became greatly diluted as a result of the PSP's policy of sup-
 port, the aid received from the Soviet bloc, and the influence
 of PSP advisers such as Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.  At the same
 time, within the PSP it was recognized that Fidel was "wary"
 of the Communists closest to him, was "extremely individual-
 istic", and felt that "his" revolution was the most advanced
 type because the workers were not the leading force.  One lead-
 er (Carlos Rafael Rodriguez) told the Brazilian CP in 1959 that
 CP leaders had little doubt that a crisis would eventually arise
 between Castro and the PSP, and that when this occurred the
 party planned to be in a position to seize full control of the
 government.
 It is against this background that the early indications
 of Chinese Communist influence, as a disruptive influence,
 must be placed.  It is evident that the works of Mao Tse-tung,
 which the PSP had recommended for study in connection with
 the organization of Communist activity in the guerrilla terri-
 tory, were appropriate and appealing to leaders of the 26th of
 July Movement.   After the victory, the organization of the
 Agrarian Reform Institute provided another area for the appli-
 cation of the Chinese experience, and in October 1959 a source
 who was in contact with Guevara and other high officials of the
 Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA) expressed the opinion that
 the Soviets "do not have a chance in Cuba".  He stated that
 INRA officials viewed China as the "model state" while

 considering the Soviets as "degenerate Communists".
 Evidence of friction within the PSP itself, possibly
 related to the earlier conflict with the 26th of July leaders
 and the developing Sino-Soviet conflict, came in January 1960.
 At this time it was reported that a group (unidentified) existed
 within the PSP which proposed that the older leaders step
 down and. allow the younger members to assume nominal con-
 trol of the party.  This development was apparently based on
 the belief that the older leaders, including Secretary General
 Blas Roca, Juan. Marinello, and Carlos Ra#agl Rodriguez,
 were too closely associated with the party's past collaboration
 with Batista, and that others could be more effective in view
 of the party's professed policy of all-out support of Fidel Cas-
 tro.  Significantly, these leaders (who are still in power) are
 those who helped formulate the 1956 policies which criticized
 the Fidelistas.  It was also reported at this time that Blas Roca
 was heading a group within the party which decried the uncon-
 ditional support being given by the PSP to the Revolutionary
 Government on the grounds that Prime Minister Castro had not
 given total support to the party, pointing out that this policy of
 unconditional support deprived the party of a means of retalia-

 government was "riddled with Communist deviationists who
 prefer the Titoist or Maoist philosophy to the Soviet brand of
 Communism. " He, Marinello, and Lazaro Pena were report-
 edly advocating a concentrated effort to place known Commun-
 ists, i. e. , "Stalinists, " in control of sections of the Cuban
 government. *
 It is possible that this Stalinism refers to Stalinism as
 opposed primarily to Trotskyism (not as opposed to
 Khrushchevism), as the re-established Trotskyist group
 was condemned by Blas Roca in the PSP organ. Carta
 Semanal (4 April 1960) as a "counter revolutionax?y
 provocation".

 At this time (January 1960) Blas Roca, Marinello, and
 Pena were identified as heading a Stalinist faction within. the
 PSG', which. (at least in this pre-Summit period) distrusted
 Khrushchev. as a deviationist who might. obstruct the aggressive,
 anti-USA activities of the Latin American CPs in. exchange for
 concessions by Eisenhower.  Lazaro Pena was quoted as say-
 ing, "Can you imagine what the Cuban people will say when one
 day Hoy proclaims that the Americans are not imperialists?"
 On the other hand, Pena was quoted as saying that "Bias Roca
 was right when he said that we. should not give unconditional
 support to Fidel Castro and those damned Maoists".  These
 statements are indicative of the problems faced by the PSP lead-
 ers in seeking to follow the CPSU line and yet also simulta.neous.-
 l.y support the extremism of Fidel, Raul, and other administration
 leaders.
 Although critical of Khrushchev's "pacifism", thdre is
 no evidence that the Stalinism of the PSP leaders represented
 a pro-Chinese position.  In March 1960 a very reliable source
 in contact with PSP leaders reported that the PSP was "Soviet-
 oriented, well disciplined, and without factional strife".  Yet
 it is clear that as the Sino-Soviet rift developed in. 1960, the
 PSP leaders became increasingly concerned with. their own posies
 tion.  I.n April, May, and June, Secretary General Bias Roca
 made a trip to the Soviet bloc and China, motivated in part by a
 desire to discuss the nature of Sino-Soviet disunity with leaders
 of .other parties.  He returned with no definite opinion. on. the
 matter, but impressed with its seriousness, and subsequently
 the PSP held a series of meetings in an. attempt to formulate a
 stand.  The leaders concealed their concern from the rank and
 file, however, and tried to minimize the importance of the con-
 troversy.  The position of the Party leadership was probably as
 stated by Carlos Rafael Rodriguez in July 1960, when he. said
 privately that "it would be unwise to take a position with respect
 to the controversy, as the very line that one might oppose might
 become the accepted line".  Nevertheless, pro-Soviet bias was.
 indicated in his further remarks that "the CPSU had an enormous
 task in guiding the. world Communist movement along the right

 road, " and that the CPSU "must be moderate and attempt to
 maintain peace in view of the possibility that the imperialists,
 in their death-agonies, might strike blows which would imperil
 mankind. "  This statement, and the continued control of the
 PSP by the old leaders after the Eighth PSP Congress in August
 1960, suggest that the PSP is indeed Soviet-oriented, and that
 the Chinese claims of Cuban CP support, made at the prelim-
 inary meeting held in Mosoow in October to consider the. Sino-
 Soviet controversy, did not refer to the party leadership.  On
 the other hand, the PSP leadership has publicly reversed its
 earlier line to accomodate the 26th of July thesis: in his ad-
 dress at the VIII PSP Congress, Blas Roca stated that the
 attacks on the Moncada and Bayamo barracks were "not con-
 ceived as a classic coup or putsch, despite the manner in.
 which they rrere carried out.  ... They were not designed to
 take over the ggvernment... but... (to) form a center of revo-
 lutionary struggle.  . . . The great historical merit of Fidel lies
 in the fact that... he saw it was possible to defeat the tyranny
 by armed force. "
 From the foregoing it seems apparent that the anti-
 Soviet and pro-Chinese influence in Cuba is located primar-
 ily outside. the PSP, in the ranks of the 26th of July Movement
 and the governmental agencies and among the younger members
 of the PSP.  It is probably strongest among certain. elements
 who fought in. the Sierra and who were aware of revolutionary
 ideologies, among those exposed to Chinese revolutionary
 ideologies, among those exposed to Chinese revolutionary
 literature, and among the new generation of Marxists educated
 i-n:. the courses established by the Rebel Army and other govern-
 ment agencies which glorify the Sierra campaign. and its. leaders.
 These are unorthodox Communists, who to date have neither
 been clearly identified nor organized into a recognizable clique
 or group.  They may include Raul Castro, who denies. member-
 ship in the PSP yet was once a member of the Communist Youth
 and who may be a. secret member of the Party.  Raul's militant,
 aggressive, extremist anti-USA views give support to the Chinese
 policy of promoting East-West tension rather than reducing it.

 Raul was reportedly disappointed by the refusal of the Soviets
 to enter into a military pact with Cuba, which was one of his
 objectives in going to Moscow in the summer of 1960.  He has
 given strong support to the establishment of the Cuban-Chinese
 Cultural Society and the New China News Agency office in
 Habana,  In November 1959 he reportedly received verbal mes-
 sages from the Chinese Foreign Minister through Faure Chomon
 (now Cuban ambassador to the USSR) including a request that
 Raul "occupy the USA Naval Base at Guantanamo immediately
 upon the beginning of a Chinese Communist attack on Taiwan.
 Raul has also been reported (without confirmation) to have been
 in contact with Chinese intelligence officials who, from Habana,
 were organizing the foundation of Communist Chinese cells
 throughout Latin America.
 Guevara may be another vehicle for pro-Chinese influ-
 ence, although he has stressed that the Cuban revolution has
 followed its own Marxist path.  Guevara's advocacy of armed
 struggle as the means of extending the Cuban revolution to
 other Latin American countries, his belief that armed struggle
 can be initiated before conditions for its success are present,
 and his praise of Chinese communes suggest a pro-Chinese
 orientation, though earlier in his career he appears to have
 been closely associated with the Soviets.  Guevara also denies
 that he is a Communist, and there is no proof that he is a
 secret party member.  Carlos Olivares Sanchez, deputy min-
 ister of Foreign Affairs and the principal coordinator of Cuban
 diplomatic and pars -diplomatic activities in Latin America, is
 reported to be "a practicing Marxist with a preference in

 Olivares is very closely associated with Raul Castro, is secre-
 tary of Foreign Relations of the 26th of July Movement, and one
 of the key officials involved in the extension of the Cuban liber-
 ation movement to the rest of Latin America.
 Armando Hart, the Minister of Education, as previously
 mentioned, appears to represent an unorthodox brand of Com-
 munism, possibly associated with the revived Trotskyite move
 rent.   (It is of interest to note, parenthetically, that a new
 Latin American Popular Liberation Front containing Trotskyite
 elements, was organized in Argentina in early 1960, and that one
 of the organizational meetings was held in Buenos Aires in the
 home of the father of Guevara.  Other meetings took place in
 Buenos Aires under the aegis of Cuban and ,Bolivian diplomats.)
 Hart's wife, Haydee Santamaria, is head of the C sa de las
 Americas in Cuba, a front which is instrumental in financing
 and training revolutionary youth in other Latin American countries.
 In addition to those named above, there are probably others,
 among them officials who have been subjected to intense propa-
 ganda during visits to Communist China, who may favor the Chin-
 ese in the present dispute.  At the present time, these cannot be
 identified.  However, it is known that the Chinese feel that they
 have support in Cuba.  They indicated this at the time of the pre..
 liminary meetings in Moscow in October 1960, and reportedly they
 were able to prevent the distribution. in Cuba of certain issues of
 Problems of Peace and Socialism which favored the Soviet view-
 point.

 disruptive, it seems probable that the Chinese will. seek to
 exploit the various dissidents, unorthodox Communists, and
 extremists in the 26th of July Movement as a force in their
 favor.  In this effort they will be greatly aided by the actual
 presence on the Cuban scene of Chinese propagandists, tech-
 nicians, and officials, among whom are CP members.
 The influx of Chinese visitors began in early 1959.
 The New China News Agency has had a staff, headed by
 Kung Mai, at its Latin American headquarters in Habana
 since mid-1959.  In November 1959 the Communist Chinese
 Foreign Minister sent word to Raul Castro that twenty Chinese
 industrial and agricultural technicians would arrive in Cuba
 in January 1960. Later reports suggest that these arrived and
 have been engaged by INRA, and in September 1960 it was re
 ported that Chinese Communists were working on an agricul-
 tural cooperative in Caney, Oriente Province.  Various Chinese
 delegations have also visited Cuba.  For example, in October
 1960 a group of Chinese trade unionists headed by Kang Yung-ho
 visited Cuba to participate in the WFTUmsponsored international
 labor meeting in support of Algeria, and later toured Cuban
 factories and talked with Cuban labor leaders. In addressing
 workers at one factory, Kang described how the Chinese had
 overcome their difficulties, had defeated the USA embargo,
 and had developed production on the basis of their own resources.
 In November 1960 a group of eight Chinese (including trade, bank-
 ing, . and NCNA officials, and interpreters) was conducted on a
 tour of INRA cooperatives in Matanzas and briefed by Captain Julio
 Suarez, an extreme anti-American leftist who devoted much of
 his speech to a description of supposed American sabotage of the
 Cuban agricultural and industrial effort.  The Chinese, during
 the tour, made suggestions concerning the need for the liquidation
 of counter -revolutionaries and the strengthening of the militia at
 various installations.  Even more extensive contacts in the future
 are indicated in the statements made by Guevara in China in
 December 1960, when he said that "twenty-four out of the hundreds
 of factories" to be built in Cuba in the next five years will be built
 with direct Chinese aid.  By the close of 1960 Chinese anti-aircraft

 NOFORN
 guns, bazookas, and mortars were reported to be in the hands
 of Cuban forces.
 In summary, it is apparent that both the Soviets and the
 Chinese have an enormous stake in Cuba.  Fidel Castro's am-
 bition to export the Cuban revolution to the rest of Latin America
 is in accord with both Soviet and Chinese goals.  The Cuban gov-
 ernment has received massive Soviet aid and relies heavily on
 the advice of the orthodox Communist party (the PSP), which is
 controlled by pro-Soviet leaders.  These leaders, although calling
 for the complete support of Castro, have nevertheless viewed him
 with some misgivings.  Castro's impetuosity and interest in mili-
 tary action (which resulted in the unsuccessful Dominican invasion
 and other revolutionary ventures) may not only be counterproduc-
 tive and hinder the spread of Communism, but may also result in
 the extension of war and the development of a global conflict.  This
 would not be in accord with the Soviet policies of recent years,
 and although there are indications of Soviet approval of a more
 aggressive international Communist line in 1961, it is possible
 that the orthodox Communists still wish to avoid responsibility for
 Fidelista extremism.
 It may be significant, in this connection, that the un-
 officially Communist-controlled Italian daily Il Paese, of
 7 November 1960, identified four currents within the Cuban
 revolutionary movement:  the "Nationalist" current in-
 spired by Nasser and neutralism; the "National Socialist"
 current, inspired by Yugoslavia, Indonesia, and active
 neutralism; the "Trotskyist" current, "which is inclined
 to assume extremist postures and is a partisan of the
 model of the Chinese Revolution"; and the "Communist"
 current, organized by the PSP and which, "after having
 corrected its errors, " is today the most well-balanced and
 which, unlike the others, "still wishes to collaborate with
 the petty bourgeoisie. "

 To the Chinese, the extension of the armed struggle
 to other countries through the activities of the Castro govern-
 ment serves the immediate end of increasing international
 tensions and creating problems for the United States on a wide
 variety of fronts. The justification by 26th of July Movement
 leaders of sabotage, terrorism, and the initiation, of violent
 action regardless of the preparation of the masses is in accord
 with this Chinese goal of promoting tension.  Moreover, the
 rural, agrarian, anti-imperialist characteristics of the Cuban
 revolution allow the Chinese opportunity for offering advice
 based on their own experience, even though they are not in a
 position to offer the same technical, material, and military
 aid as the Soviet bloc.
 In. Mexico, recognition of the Sino-Soviet controversy
 within the middle ranks of the orthodox Communist Party (the
 Partido Comunista Mexicano, PCM) was reported in August
 1960. At that time, Prisciliano Garza Escalante, a member of
 the Central Committee, told several Nuevo Leon state PCM
 leaders that he had recently returned from the USSR and China
 and was disturbed by the developing rift between these coun-
 tries.                                 no said the "greatest single factor causing the deteriorate
 tion of relations" was the Soviet adherence to a tactical line
 described by the Chinese as being "weak and non-aggressive. "
 Garza said the PCM mustj-_ study the controversy and decide
 whether to support the Soviet or the Chinese party.  Garza was
 reported as personally favoring the more aggressive action line
 of the Chinese.
 About this same time, a "communication addressed to
 the Political Commission of the PCM, " allegedly by "a group
 of Chinese Communists in Cuba" indicates that the Chinese CP
 may have sought, through direct channels, to establish its
 Approved For Relea7cF:     M%%-4MR001 2002
 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200250003-8
 position before the CP Mexico. * This communication,
 presumably received in September 1960, outlined four
 points, which epitomized the Chinese position.  These, in
 brief, were as follows:
 a.  War is inevitable and. can break out at
 any moment.  It will be initiated by the imperialist
 bloc led by the United States, or by the United
 States alone without previous knowledge by its
 allies.
 b.  War must not be feared, even a nuclear
 war.  It is not certain that such a war would destroy
 humanity, and, although devastating, it must be
 exploited to accelerate the pace of a transition to
 Socialism.
 c.  In some countries, a peaceful transition
 from capitalism to. socialism is improbable because.
 it has been proved that imperialism goes to the aid
 of the capitalistic system wherever the situation is
 maturing.
 It is possible that the foregoing statement of Chinese
 views originated with the Chinese delegation to the
 congress of the Cuban CP held in Habana in August
 1960.  It is not known that the Chinese used this occa-
 sion for stating their case to other fraternal delegates,
 though this is likely.  Certainly the. Sino-Soviet rift
 was discussed, as the Honduran delegate reported that
 the P$P "disparaged the differences" between the two
 powers.  In referring to the rift, he stated that the
 Chinese "did nbt approve of trying to reach agreements
 with the W0st, "  and although they recognized the inter-
 national leadership of the USSR, they believed that
 "more. people will die from hunger under capitalism
 than would die in a war. It

 d,  The. transition from capitalism to socialism
 will be violent, but it is. the obligation of the Commun-
 ist parties to blame capitalist agents for it.
 Another indication of direct Chinese action in :defense
 of their ideological viewpoint was the distribution. in Mexico of
 the book Long Live Leninism.  In. late September 1960 the first
 shipment of 2000 copies of the Spanish edition arrived in Mexico,
 and an. additional 3.000 copies were reportedly expected.  This
 book has been used. by the Chinese in their attack on Soviet views,
 and its distribution has been protested by various CPs in both
 bloc and non-bloc countries as injurious to. Communist unity.  It
 is possible that, from Mexico, the book has been distributed
 elsewhere in Latin Americai..
 In Mexico, evidence of Soviet, Chinese, and Cuban
 influences must be viewed against a background of inter-party
 and intra-party rivalry, disagreement, and intrigue.  To date
 there appears to be no clear reflection of the Sino-Soviet rift.
 However, there is. considerable evidence of a growth. of leftist
 extremism which, is supported from Cuba and which, as in Cuba,
 seems to involve youth and student elements, a revived Trot-
 skyist party, * and. dissident members of the Communist Party
 of Mexico.  There are also indications that the Peoples.' Social-
 ist Party (PPS), which dominates the Mexican Communist move -
 me.nt, favors, the Soviet position and, in the last year and a half,
 has received increased Soviet support.
 The Trotskyist Partido Obrero Revolucionario (POR) was
 founded in mid41959.  Its leaders include Jorge Meza, a
 railroad worker; Hernan. Fraga, a student; Carlos Lopez,
 a painter; and Jaime Estrada Lopez, a law student.  Like
 its Cuban counterpart, it officially identifies. itself with
 the IV International.

 Within the orthodox Communist party (PCM), indirect.
 Soviet. guidance and possibly interference were responsible for
 the overthrow in 1959-60 of Dionisio Encina, who symbolized
 Stalinism, apd the rise to power in the party of Arnoldo Mar -
 tinez Verdugo and others favoring the Khrushchev line.  The
 victorious anti-Encina group, however, itself has become.
 divided in the past year between leaders such as David Alfaro.
 Siqueiros, who favors agitation, and Martinez Verdugo, who
 favors more discreet action which. would limit political
 repercussions..
 Si.q'ueiros, currently in prison for fomenting unrest,
 appears to have been a key figure in the support in Mexico of
 extremist agitation over the past year.  He has apparently had
 Cuban support.  In August or September 1959 Siqueiros' brother-
 in-law, Leopoldo Arenal. Bastar, was given possession of arms
 which had been. stored in the Cuban embassy in Mexico, presum-
 ably for use by a group described by Arenal as being composed
 of "dissatisfied petroleum workers, railroad workers, and
 teachers. "    In November 1959 Arenal sought additional arms
 from Cuban sources for the Alfaro Siqueiros group.  In January
 1960 Siqueiros strongly criticized President Lopez Mateos of
 Mexico and praised the Cuban revolution, receiving emphatic
 support from the then Cuban ambassador, Salvador Massip.  In
 February, Leopoldo Arenal again appeared at the Cuban embassy
 selling Siqueiros' prints in order to buy parts for portable radios
 to be used in. Mexico, and in July certain members of the Mex-
 ican delegation to the First Latin American Youth Congress in
 Habana. took with them a painting by Siqueiros to sell in order to
 buy arms for an. armed revolution.
 It is of interest that the principal. controversy which,
 developed at the Youth Congress in Habana concerned the
 recognition of the credentials of certain "Trotskyist" delegates
 from Mexico, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina.  Of the Mexican
 delegation, which represented some twenty-three student and
 youth. organizations, representatives of five groups supported

 the recognition of delegates df, the Mexican Trotskyist Partido
 Obrero Revolucionario and wished the congress to denounce
 officially the government of President Lopez Mateos.  This:
 group included representatives from the Communist Youth of
 Mexico (JCM, the youth affiliate of the PCM), the !!revolu-
 tionary sector" of the National Teachers. Union (SNTE), the
 Worker-Farmer Party of Mexico (POCM), and the University
 Student Federation (FEU).  Fourteen other groups, however,
 opposed the recognition of the Trotskyists and the. denunciation
 of the Mexican government.  This group was led by the Popu-
 lar Youth (JP), which. is the affiliate of Vicente Lombardo
 Toledano's Popular Socialist Party (PPS), and other groups
 controlled by the PPS.  This. faction gained the support of the
 congress, to the discredit. of the PCM..
 This controversy, although not known to be a reflec-
 tion of the Sino-Soviet dispute, appears to parallel two of
 the fundamental points of Sino-Soviet disagreement:  the de
 gree to which violence shall be used to effect the transition
 to socialism; and the degree to which the national bourgeoisie
 (represented by Lopez MJ teos) can be trusted and used as
 allies.
 Since their defeat at the Youth Congress, the extrem-
 ist elements in Mexico have been further weakened by the.
 repressive measures taken by the government against student
 and teacher. demonstrators in August, including the arrest of
 Siqueiros, * and by the removal of Leonel Padilla and Cesar
 Arnoldo Martinez. Verdugo, arrested at the same time,
 was released and represented the PCM at the meeting
 of Communist parties in Moscow, returning on. 18 Decem-
 ber.  Oton. Salazar, leader of the revolutionary sector of
 the Mexican Teachers' Union (SNTE), is now reported
 discredited within the SNTE.

 Augusto Velasco Sandoval from their positions of leadership
 in the Communist Youth.  The basic reason for the removal
 of Padilla and Velasco, which was effected by the Commun-
 ist party leaders, was reported to be their close connection
 and collaboration with the Trotskyist POR.  It was Padilla,
 apparently, who had. been in charge of the sale of the Siqueiros
 painting in. Cuba for armed revolutionary funding.  Somewhat
 later, the explusion of two members of the Juventud Comun-
 ista for advocating armed revolt in Mexico was reported.
 The foregoing information suggests that a purge of
 extremist elements from among the orthodox Communists
 has, been taking place, paralleled  by governmental action
 which.. has resulted in. the imprisonment or persecution of
 Communist and extreme leftist agitators.  Although all, the
 Communist organizations protest the imprisonment of Deme-
 trio Vallejo, Dionisio Encina, David Al.faro Siqueiros, and
 others, the practical result of the arrests has favored the
 elements which seem to support the Khrushchev line and has
 weakened the extremist elements among whom the. Chinese.
 views might find support.  The current dominance of the pro-
 Soviet elements within the orthodox Communist party is il-
 lustrated in an. editorial in the PCM organ La Voz de Mexico
 for I January 1961.  This lauds the CPSU, supports coexist-
 ence as the policy for world Communism, and ignores
 Communist China.
 As indicated above, in. connection with the conflict
 which developed at the Latin American. Youth Congress, the
 policies of the Peoples' Socialist Party (PPS), led by Vicente
 Lombardo Toledano, tend to support the Soviet, rather than
 the Chinese, point of view.  The PPS, which defines itself
 as Marxist-Leninist, favors "the constant development of
 the existing democratic regime and, in due course, of the
 peoples' democracy, in order to arrive at the establishment
 of the socialist regime. " In. practice, it defends collabora-
 tion with the bourgeois administration of President Lopez
 Mateos, which it seeks to infiltrate and influence, and attacks

 extremist sectarian opposition to the administration as
 counterproductive.
 Lombardo's policies were exemplified in his con-
 demnation of the railroad strike of March 1959, which was
 supported by the PCM and the POCM and which resulted
 in the arrest. and imprisonment of Demetrio Vallejo and
 other leaders, and subsequently Dionisio Encina.  Lom -
 bardo's statement concerning the strike came on 30 April
 1959~after his return fom the USSR.  Later, in July, he
 told party members that he had been told by Soviet Commun-
 ist leaders to assume the dominant role in all leftist activ-
 ities in Mexico.  He has also stated privately that Soviet
 and satellite officials instructed him to reactivate all exist-
 ing friendship societies under his control and direction.
 Subsequentl)5,in 1960, Lombardo has reorganized and re-
 named his party to identify it more closely with international
 Communism, and reportedly has gained Soviet approval of
 the PPS platform as the basis for an anti-imperialist front
 in Mexico.
 There can be little doubt that Lombardo has been
 well informed on the Sino-Soviet rift through his high
 WFTU position and his Soviet contacts.  He attended the
 twenty-first meeting of the Executive Committee of the
 WFTU as well as the WFTU General Council Meeting in
 Peiping in June 1960, at which the dispute began to grow
 heated.  Subsequently, Lombardo published an article in
 Siempre (Mexico City, 20 July 1960) presenting an examin-
 ation of the international scene "as seen from China", and
 representing "the opinions of the leaders and the people of
 the countries which are building socialism".  The article
 serves to support the Soviet point of view, however, with
 respect to the castrophic nature of a new war which "for the
 socialist countries, would represent the immediate paral-
 yzation of their constructive programs; that is to say, the
 impossibility of building socialism within the anticipated
 time. "

 In summary, it. is apparent that the Soviets have made
 a strenuous effort to strengthen their position in Mexico,
 relying heavily on. the PPS and certain leaders of the PCM.
 Chinese. views, although known to party leaders, have found
 no significant support or acknowledgment.  However, there
 exist certain pro-Cuban extremist elements, Trotskyists,
 and disgruntled Stalinists who may favorably respond to
 Chinese Communist overtures, should these be made to them.
 Although there is little prospect of the development of a strong
 pro-Chinese Communist element. in Mexico, the existence of
 a great number of separate, rival Communist parties and
 cliques may provide a useful index to the nature of various
 international ideological trends or schisms.
 In other Latin American countries there are also
 differences within the CPs and between the CPs and other
 revolutionary groups which are similar to those existing
 in Cuba and Mexico.  These involve conflicts between activ-
 ists and pacifists, between. youth and age, between the inex-
 perienced and the experienced.  For example, the head of
 the Radical Youth. in Chile recently wrote to a friend and
 former Cuban student leader, now an INRA official, that:
 in Chile... a. start must be made at once.
 Only one of the political leaders of Chile has the
 mind and determination to pursue the revolutionary
 course.  That is. Clotario Blest....  This attitude
 has almost brought him to disgrace in the eyes of
 the leftist political leaders, especially those of
 the Communist. Party, who think we must still wait
 indefinitely. t!
 In Brazil, a conflict exists within the CP itself, where
 a leftist faction headed by Mauricio Grabois, Calil Chadde,

 the problem of. the support of the Cuban revolution.,, and the
 din satisfaction of the Fidelistas with. the pacifist policies
 of the PSP is being duplicated in their attitude toward the
 PCB. Thus Calil Chadde said that certain Cuban revolu-
 tionary leaders had complained to him in August 1960 about
 the lack of Brazilian support for the Cuban. revolution, and
 a Brazilian editor, who conferred with Prensa Latina execu-
 tives in Habana in November, reported that unnamed Cuban
 officials had. criticized the Brazilian CP for refusing to
 allow other groups, such as the Trot~kyites, to join in pro-
 Cuban activities.  The Cubans indicated that they would like
 to find some group other than the CP to assume direction
 of pro-Cuban. activities in Brazil, but that the CP was the
 only one which could. be relied on.
 Conflicts of this type exist also in other countries
 and may easily become associated with the PSP?Fidelista.

 as the two Communist powers seek to extend or strengthen
 their policies and as local Communists or revolutionaries
 look for. support for their ow.n. policies or tactics as deter-
 mined by their oven views of the opportunities presented by
 the immediate national political situation.  To date, there
 has been little evidence of direct Chinese. involvement in
 such. factionalism and conflict that does. exist, but this
 situation may change now that a Chinese Communist base.
 for operations has been established in. Habana.
