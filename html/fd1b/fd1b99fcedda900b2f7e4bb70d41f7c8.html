 VIETNAM
 In the first week of the Paris talks, Hanoi's rep-
 resentatives moved quickly to focus attention on the
 question of a cessation of US bombing and all other
 acts of war.   In the South,  the Communists'  second
 "general offensive" tapered off, but the Viet Cong
 attacked several remote allied outposts.   South
 Vietnam is expected soon to have a new premier--Tran
 Van Huong.

 is heaviest in the six provinces where these new
 bodies have not yet been set up.

 In the opening sessions of the Paris talks, Hanoi's representatives tried
 to project an image of confidence and superior bargaining strength. They
 avoided delays and wrangling over procedural details in order to focus the
 talks promptly on their key demand for a complete and unconditional
 cessation of bombing. They also sought to convey a business-like approach
 by refraining from ultimatums and deadlines.
 Chief negotiator Xuan Thuy, however, concentrated on establishing
 the point that the future of the talks hinges on 1JS acceptance of Hanoi's
 "primordial and most pressing" demand for a "definitive and uncondi-
 tional" cessation of bombing and all other acts of war against North
 Vietnam. He denounced the idea of reciprocal restraint in exchange for an
 end to the bombing, but did not rule it out categorically.
 The Saigon government attempted to counter this thrust and to
 influence the US position by renewing its insistence that there should be
 no cessation of bombing until North Vietnamese infiltration into the
 South ends under effective controls. On the political front, President
 Thieu was expected to announce the appointment of Tran Van Huong as
 the new prime minister soon. The delay in this cabinet reshuffle was
 caused both by the Communist attack on Saigon and by the uneasiness of
 Vice President Ky and the senior generals over the prospect of increased
 civilian influence at their expense.
 The fighting in Saigon proper subsided this week and most Com-
 munist forces withdrew. They apparently intend to dig in close to the
 city, however, and new assaults may come at an  time
 Uncertainty over the implications of the Paris talks and the long-term
 course of US policy in Asia was reflected in statements by LaotianQ
 leaders. Souvanna Phouma apparently is seeking to re-establish
 his standing as a neutralist by publicly emphasizing his commitment to the
 neutrality of Laos and by refuting charges that lie is inextricably tied to
 the US. In a gesture to Hanoi, Souvanna's National Day speech omitted
 denunciations of North Vietnamese aggression in Laos which he has
 constantly stressed over the  ast  ear.

 VIETNAM
 In the first week of the
 Paris talks, Hanoi's representa-
 tives moved quickly to focus at-
 tention on the question of a ces-
 sation of US bombing and all other
 acts of war.   They refrained from
 wrangling over procedural matters
 and tried to project a reasonable
 attitude by avoiding harsh polem-
 ical language.   Chief negotiator
 Thuy's opening statement repeated
 Hanoi's long-standing positions,
 but put them in less categorical
 language than is frequently used
 in North Vietnamese propaganda.
 Thuy's relatively restrained
 tone was not matched by the do-
 mestic output of the North Viet-
 namese press.   The main party
 daily on 12 May used Hanoi's
 harshest terms to outline the
 North Vietnamese position on the
 bombing issue.   The newspaper
 called for a "definitive and un-
 conditional" cessation, specifying
 that "all other acts of war" in-
 cluded not only reconnaissance
 flights and leaflet drops, but
 also naval gunfire, artillery
 firing across the Demilitarized
 Zone, and "sabotage activities."
 Xuan Thuy's statement on 15
 May picked up the same language
 to describe Hanoi's demands for
 a full cessation of the bombing
 and other acts of war.   He re-
 tained some flexibility on the
 issue of military reciprocity,
 saying only that the US has "no
 right to demand a price" for a
 bombing halt.   Xuan Thuy stressed
 that such a halt is the first re-
 quirement "for a peaceful settle-
 ment," and he "recalled" that the
 initial purpose of the talks is
 to reach agreement on this issue.
 He did not make an immediate bomb-
 ing halt a condition for contin-
 uing the talks, however.  The
 North Vietnamese stance so far
 suggests they do not want the
 talks to break down over the
 bombing issue.
 :Hanoi's plans for its new
 Communist front group in South
 Vietnam--the National Alliance--
 are becoming clearer.   The Al-
 liance apparently is to be in-
 troduced into the negotiation's
 along with the Liberation Front
 when South Vietnamese issues
 come up.   The Communists may in-
 tend for the Alliance to serve
 as an umbrella under which various
 southern groups and individuals
 can be assembled to act as the
 "true spokesmen" for the South
 Vietnamese people.
 The Ground War in the South
 The Communist's second "gen-
 eral offensive" of 1968, which
 was launched on 4-5 May, began
 to run out of steam this week.
 Allied reaction forces have driven
 back attacking enemy forces from
 the capital city of Saigon and
 in key areas of the northernmost
 provinces.  Nevertheless, some
 enemy main force units have
 launched new strikes at several
 allied strongpoints while others
 are completing preparations for
 possible combat.

 In the western highlands
 provinces of Kontum, Pleiku, and
 Darlac, the long-anticipated
 enemy campaign may have begun in
 midweek when Communist artillery-
 men shelled several provincial
 capitals and allied military po-
 sitions.
 Although most enemy forces
 have now withdrawn from Saigon,
 the Communists still pose a se-
 rious threat and could renew heavy
 attacks at any time.   Mortar and
 rocket harassment of military in-
 stallations and airfields inthe
 area is expected to continue while
 the Communists possibly prepare
 for new ground attacks.
 There has been increasing
 evidence to support earlier specu-
 lation that Communist military
 forces in South Vietnam are tailor-
 ing some of their military actions
 to affect the Paris talks.   Cap-
 tured documents and prisoner In-
 terrogations  have made increas-
 ing reference to attacks that
 could strengthen the position
 of the Communist representatives
 at Paris.
 In this sense, the Commu-
 nist may well consider the latest
 military campaign a success, even
 though at considerable cost to
 themselves.   For example, the.
 number of allied soldiers killed
 last week--562 Americans and 607
 South Vietnamese--was the highest
 for any week of the war to date.
 Although total over-all allied
 casualties were not record set-
 ting, this heavy death toll may
 be exploited by the Communists,
 even though their own losses of
 5,552 men killed were the heaviest
 suffered in a single week since
 their record casualties sustained
 during the Tet offensive earlier
 this year.

 the replacement of Prime Minister
 Loc and several cabinet members
 by the end of this week.   The
 delay has been caused in part by
 the renewed Viet Cong attacks
 on Saigon.   A more important rea-
 son, however, has been the ap-
 parent uneasiness of Vice Presi-
 dent Ky and the senior generals
 over the possibility of increased
 civilian control at their expense.
 Tran Van Huong is still slated
 to be the new prime minister
 barring any last-minute military
 opposition.   He reportedly would
 bring other prominent politicians
 into the cabinet.
 The Lower House finally
 passed a watered-down version of
 the general mobilization bill

 contains no penalties for infrac-
 tions.   It fails to grant specific
 authority to the government to
 requisition public and private
 property, stipulating that there
 is sufficient authority under
 existing statutes.
 The bill does authorize the
 executive to organize and ad-

 by decree.   The government is
 already pushing ahead in this
 field.   On 11 May, several thou-

 DISORDERS NOT ENDED BY CHINA'S NEW PROVINCIAL REGIMES
 Sporadic but violent clashes,
 often between armed groups, are
 still occurring in many areas of
 February, instructing military
 units on how to correct politi-
 cal errors and overcome "fac-
 tionalism."
 China,
 25X1        Minor clashes between "revolu-
 tionary" factions and unruly dem-
 onstrations continue to be widely
 reported even in provinces that
 have already established "rev-
 olutionary committees."  In gen-
 eral, however, fighting is
 heaviest in the six provinces
 where these new bodies have not
 yet been set up.  Apparently,
 top leaders in Peking are having
 considerable difficulty reaching
 agreement on who is to run these
 provinces.
 These are all hard-core prob-
 lem areas where factions have
 been fighting each other, some-
 times savagely, throughout the
 Cultural Revolution.   They also
 seem to be run by military men
 who may not be entirely trusted
 by Peking.   Recent speeches by
 Peking leaders, as quoted in Red
 Guard newspapers, have been
 critical of commanders in at
 least four of the six provinces.
 According to an April news-
 paper, the military in Yunnan
 Province is divided, and each
 faction has sent representatives
 to Peking to confer with top
 leaders.   They are said to be
 studying a directive, issued by
 Mao and the central committee in
 Delegations from all six
 provinces have been in Peking
 since at least February, while
 top officials try to hammer out
 new leadership lists for their
 areas.  On 13 May, Peking radio
 expressed the hope that new com-
 mittees would be formed in these
 six provinces "as soon as possi-
 ble."
 Deadlines like these have
 seldom been met, however.   Last
 fall, Mao Tse-tung ordered com-
 mittees to be formed in all prov-
 inces by the end of the year or
 by the Chinese New Year at the
 latest, but the job was less than
 half completed by the end of Jan-
 uary.   In late March, a target
 date of 1 May was widely pub-
 licized but only four of the 11
 remaining provinces made that
 deadline.
 It appears that the exist-
 ence of disorders is no obstacle
 to the formation of a new "revo-
 lutionary committee."  Fighting
 was very heavy in parts of Liao-
 ning Province just before a com-   25X1
 mittee was established there on
 10 May.

 The chairman of the Liaoning
 committee is the controversial
 commander of the Shen-yang Mili-
 tary Region, Chen Hsi-lien.   Chen
 has been denounced repeatedly by
 militant Red Guard groups, who
 have staged many unruly demonstra-
 tions against him this year in
 Shen-yang.  Apparently they have
 continued to contest Peking's
 decision to confirm their long-
 time enemy as chairman of the new
 committee.  If this is the case,
 it would imply that Chen Hsi-lien
 has not been empowered to take
 firm measures against them.
 Last month, Mao Tse-tung's
 nephew, Mao Yuan-hsin, who has
 been playing an unobtrusive
 but apparently important role
 in the Cultural Revolution
 group, told representatives of
 a Red Guard faction from Liao-
 ning that they deserved to be
 criticized for some of their ad-
 tions but he assured them that
 the center considered them on
 the whole to be a good "revolu-i
 tionary" group.   Inasmuch as
 Mao Yuan-hsin showed up on the
 new Liaoning committee--his pub-
 lic introduction to Chinese
 politics--he presumably will b4
 in a position to protect groups
 he favors in Shenyang.
 As was the case in Shensi
 when a committee was formed
 there on 1 May, Liaoning has
 failed to resume broadcasting
 of local news and still replays
 only Peking-originated items.
 Both provinces have done this
 for more than a year, and the
 continuation of the practice
 means they have been unable to`
 broadcast accounts of inaugural
 ceremonies.   "Local blackouts
 of this kind were ordered by
 Peking last year wherever fac-
 tional conflicts were serious,
 but all other provinces resumed
 local broadcasting at least sev-
 eral days before they acquired:
 committees.

 COMMUNIST DRIVE IN NORTH LAOS TEMPORARILY STALLED
 The Communists' annual dry-
 season offensive is moving into
 its last stages but the push
 against the important government
 guerrilla base at Na Khang appears
 to have stalled.
 With the support of stepped-
 up US air strikes, government
 troops have recently reoccupied
 a number of outlying defensive
 positions lost to the enemy in
 early May.   Enemy pressure
 against the base's defenses has
 eased and the Communists have
 thus far been unable to bring
 the vital airstrip under fire.
 The Communist build-up
 against Na Khang is continuing,
 however.   Construction is moving
 ahead on a road that will facil-
 itate the movement of heavy ar-
 tillery and supplies into the im-
 mediate area, and there are re-
 ports that fresh troops are
 being moved in to reinforce the
 four Communist battalions already
 deployed against the base.
 In Vientiane, Prime Minister
 Souvanna, apparently in an ef-
 fort to re-establish his creden-
 tials as a neutralist, has taken
 advantage of recent opportunities
 to express his continuing com-
 mitment to the neutrality of
 Laos and to refute charges that
 he is inextricably tied to the
 US.
 Souvanna responded favor-
 ably to Yugoslav President
 Tito's invitation to attend a:
 proposed conference of nonaligned
 nations, citing the benefits
 to Laos'  "international image,"
 In addition, he made a small con-
 ciliatory gesture toward Hanoi.
 His National Day speech on 11,
 May was moderate in tone, and,
 in sharp contrast to last year,
 did not mention North Vietnamese
 aggression in Laos.
 These steps almost certainly
 reflect the uneasiness in Vien-
 tiane generated by the talks
 in Paris.   Souvanna no doubt be-
 lieves that his increasingly
 close identification with US
 policy in Indochina over the
 past several years may be cir-
 cumscribing his ability to ma"
 neuver.

 Moscow increased its pressures on Prague this week, even as some
 possibly unexpected side effects of its saber rattling were becoming evi-
 dent elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
 Rumania and Yugoslavia have drawn together in support of the
 Czechoslovaks, evoking memories of the once-influential "Little Entente."
 Yugoslav Foreign Minister Nikezic, on his arrival in Prague for a sudden
 visit on 13 May, voiced his government's "special interest and sympathies"
 for Czechoslovakia.
 Rumanian party chief Ceausescu is to visit Tito later this month,
 probably to review the situation and to consider how best they might
 influence coming events in Eastern Europe. The Rumanians also are
 presumably uneasy about the implications for themselves of Moscow's
 handling of the Czechoslovak case, and wish to make a special point of
 their close relations with Belgrade.
 Polish leader Gomulka, visiting Hungary to sign a friendship treaty,
 presumably is also holding council on the course of events in Czecho-
 slovakia. Hungary has supported the new Prague regime, in sharp contrast
 to the bitter attacks by Poland and East Germany.
 De Gaulle has indirectly bestowed cautious approval upon Czech
 developments with his public declaration in Bucharest that "no European
 nation should submit to a shameful effacement of national sovereignty."
 He carefully balanced this statement, however, by suggesting that a num-
 ber of factors make it: necessary for Eastern European countries to main-
 tain special relations with their neighbors, especially Russia.
 In NATO the British announced their intention to detail a mobile
 task force of 20,000 men to the alliance, as well as an amphibious force

 SOVIET UNION THREATENS TO INTERVENE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Moscow placed Czechoslovakia
 under the threat of military inter-
 vention last week, evidently fear-
 ing that Dubcek, who had talked
 with the Soviet leaders on 4 and
 5 May, was not going to be able
 to control liberal extremists in
 Prague.
 The Soviet pressure began to
 build up on 7 May when TASS at-
 tacked the Czechoslovak press for
 alleging Soviet involvement in
 the death of former foreign min-
 4-ter Masaryk.  The TASS item has
 been followed by a series of So-
 viet press attacks on Czechoslo-
 vak liberals.
 The goals and the degree of
 Soviet pressure on Prague seem to
 be limited, however, and for the
 time being suggest that the So-
 viets do not intend actually to
 intervene in Czechoslovakia.  The
 troop movements seem instead to
 be an exercise in psychological
 warfare, and the     s
 ing continued.
 Throughout the period of the
 Soviet military moves, there has
 been no discernible reaction by
 the Czechoslovak armed forces.
 The Soviets have so far made
 no public attack on any CzechoslQ-
 vak leader and they do not seem
 to expect or want at this time to
 bring about Dubcek's ouster. Their
 aim appears to be to persuade him
 to rein in the more extreme lib-
 erals, whose policies Moscow finds
 threatening to the party's control.
 Moscow may not be confident
 Dubcek can steer a moderate course,
 but it would be badly mistaken if
 it counted on the conservative
 elements to turn back the clock with-
 out armed intervention by the USSR,
 a step that it is probably hesi-
 tant to take.
 Although the Dubcek regime
 has not bowed to Soviet pressure
 tactics, it is now attempting to
 mollify the USSR.  Reports of a
 party conference in Prague on 12-
 13 May suggest that Dubcek ap-
 parently intends to move against
 dogmatic party members and the

 extreme liberals, although he
 will still continue the party's
 reform program.
 On 14 May, Premier Cernik,
 in another gesture to Moscow, re-
 affirraed that Prague's foreign
 policy is based on cooperation
 with the USSR and the socialist
 countries.   Cernik also played
 down reports of discord between
 Prague and Moscow.

 The Czechoslovak party report-
 edly has also asked its journal-
 ists--who have been polemicizing
 with Soviet, Polish, and East
 German news media--to exercise
 voluntarily some measure of re-
 straint.
 Probably in reaction to the
 Soviet tactics, National Assembly
 chairman Josef Smrkovsky, who ac-
 companied Dubcek to Moscow and is
 a leading spokesman of the party
 liberals, called for an end to
 indiscriminate criticism of the
 party, declaring that it will
 not "permit anyone to imperil
 the principles of socialism."
 At the central committee
 plenum later this month, a date
 will be set for the controversial
 party congress at which the liberals
 had hoped to oust conservatives
 and Novotny supporters from the
 central committee.    Now, however,
 the liberals may be somewhat re-
 strained by the knowledge that
 the USSR will assess their per-
 formance critically in order to
 judge the future course of de-
 velopments in Czechoslovakia.
 The current crisis in Czecho-
 slovak-Soviet relations seems
 to be leading to a further polar-
 ization of Communism in Eastern
 Europe.  A special relationship
 may possibly develop between Ru-
 mania and Yugoslavia on the one
 hand and Czechoslovakia, the
 latest backslider, on the other.
 Bucharest is reported to have al-
 ready criticized Moscow for last
 week's "little summit" to which
 Czechoslovakia and Rumania were
 not invited.  Yugoslav Foreign
 Minister Nikezic suddenly visited
 Prague from 13 to 15 May, pre-
 sumably to demonstrate Belgrade's
 support and to give advice on how
 to deal with Moscow's pressures.
 Relations between these
 three independently minded coun-
 tries and Poland and East Ger-
 many are likely to become in-
 creasingly strained, particu-
 larly if the Prague press con-
 tinues to criticize the internal
 developments of their northern
 neighbors and Pankow persists in
 its subversive campaign "to in-
 fluence the atmosphere" in Czech-
 oslovakia.
 Hungary and Bulgaria are not
 as free to express their views
 on the current conflict.   Never-
 theless, the Hungarian regime
 has been sympathetic to Czech-
 oslovakia.  The Bulgarian press
 has not touched on the current
 developments in Czechoslovakia,
 which reflects both Sofia's cau-
 tion as well as its inability
 to fully agree with the Soviet
 position.

 STUDENT-LABOR DEMONSTRATIONS TEST FRENCH GOVERNMENT
 The massive student and
 labor demonstrations on 13 May,
 which took place on the tenth
 anniversary of General de Gaulle's
 return to power, have assumed
 major political significance.
 Recognition by the government
 of the widespread and serious
 nature of the present discon-
 tent could lead to a reshuffling
 of the cabinet in an attempt
 to placate the opposition.   The
 Pompidou cabinet, however, is
 not likely to be overthrown.
 Although the student dis-
 turbances that began two weeks
 ago have been led by "neew left"
 revolutionaries, the overwhelming
 majority of the demonstrators
 want. reform of the archaic uni-
 versity system.   Because of harsh
 police tactics, the students
 gained widespread public sympathy
 and the support of professors
 and deans.   The government has
 now given in to most of the
 student's major demands,, includ-
 ing amnesty for students con-
 victed during last week's riots.
 The students and their professors,
 therefore, have now taken a ,major
 first step toward becoming an
 independent factor in French
 politics.
 The student riots crystallized
 urban worker discontent with what
 labor leaders label the lack of
 "dialogue" between the working
 class and the Gaullist government.
 In an unprecedented show of unity,
 all of France's major labor unions
 joined together to proclaim a gen-
 eral strike on a   clearly   po-
 litical issue, and marched with
 students in a massive "people's
 parade" of over 300,000 on 13 May.
 The goals of the unions are to
 focus attention on their own de-
 mands for social reform and to
 creme a climate favorable to
 the opposition political parties.
 Francois Mitterrand's Fed-
 eration of the Left and the French
 Communist Party are attempting
 to use the student crisis to fur-
 ther their own ends.  Although
 the federation and the Communists
 made substantial gains in the
 parliamentary elections in 1967,
 they have not been able to trans-
 late their new voting strength
 into effective political power
 in the National Assembly despite
 the Gaullists'  lack of a formal
 majority.   Since March 19.67, the
 two parties have presented five
 different censure. motions, but
 all have failed to gain the 244
 votes required. to overturn the
 cabinet.'
 Unless there are unexpected
 defections from the ranks of those
 who voted with the Gaullists on
 past motions, a new motion di-
 rected against the government's
 handling of the student crisis
 will also fail when it comes to
 a vcte next week.   Even so, the
 government may be forced to com-
 ply with opposition demands for
 a dismissal of the ministers of
 interior and education.   This
 would be counted as a major gain
 for the left in its struggle with
 Gaullism.

 FRANCO-SOVIET MILITARY COOPERATION PLODS ALONG
 Franco-Soviet military ex-
 changes, now in their third year,
 have so far been of only margi-
 nal value to France though per-
 haps of slightly greater worth
 to the USSR.      Most of the coop-
 eration continues to be of the
 showcase variety, primarily in-
 volving exchanges of military
 delegations.
 The Soviets have pushed for
 more extensive contacts but the
 French Government has been drag-
 ging its heels, claiming it is
 studying Soviet requests.   Ef-
 forts to expand cooperation have
 been openly criticized by some
 French military officers.
 Paris has given little pub-
 licity to Franco-Soviet military
 visits and exchanges.   The Brit-
 ish press disclosed, a month
 after the fact, that a detachment
 of eight Soviet paratroopers un-
 derwent training in France in
 October 1967.   This resulted in
 a public furor in France and fur-
 ther paratroop exchanges were
 canceled.  A  detachment of French
 paratroopers had attended the
 Higher Airborne Command School at
 Ryazan in the Soviet union earlier
 in 1967. The year before, 86 mem-
 bers of the French equivalent of
 the US National War College toured
 the USSR.   The Soviets sent a re-
 turn delegation of 38 members
 from their General Staff Military
 Academy in 1967.
 Pierre Messmer, French armed
 forces minister, visited a naval
 academy and air installations in
 the USSR this April, and also ob-
 served low-level tactical exer-
 cises.   During his stay, the So-
 viets requested an exchange of
 military observers at national
 maneuvers, but the French are re-
 ported to be reluctant to do so.
 The French Navy plans to send two
 vessels with student officers to
 Leningrad this coming July for
 a third annual naval exchange
 visit.
 The contradictions in Franco-
 Soviet military cooperation were
 evident during the ten-day visit
 last October of Marshal Zakharov,
 chief of the Soviet General
 Staff.   He was refused access: to
 the air force's underground Wom-
 mand post at Taverney because a
 NATO exercise under way at the
 time was testing French air db-
 fenses against a Soviet offen-
 sive into West Germany. Zakha,rov
 also told his hosts that he re-
 garded the new AMX-30 main bat-
 tle tank, of which the French,
 are so proud, as "too high and
 clumsy.11
 One of the consequences of
 Franco-Soviet military coopera-
 tion is the concern of NATO mem-
 bers that France may be a secu-
 rity risk.   In one instance, Ger-
 man Defense ministry officials
 were disturbed to learn that
 France had demonstrated for So-
 viet officers two tactical mi--
 siles developed jointly by France
 and Germany.   NATO members also
 were concerned because the So-
 viet paratroop detachment, which
 caused the public furor in France,
 trained at the same airborne
 training school near Pau where
 NATO officers formerly had
 trained.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 UN conciliator Jarring has shifted the locus of his talks with the
 Arabs and Israelis to New York, where he still faces the problem of
 getting agreement on either direct or indirect discussions between the two
 sides.
 Arab commandos in Lebanon twice shelled Israeli targets during the
 week, bringing Lebanon into the terrorist campaign for the first time since
 the June war. Lebanese officials, unable either to restrain the increasingly
 popular terrorists or to ignore the threat of Israeli retaliation, are openly
 nervous.
 Elements on both sides of the long-simmering war in Yemen are said
 to be interested in putting an end to the conflict, but contentious
 tribesmen in both camps seem certain to frustrate any efforts toward
 peace.
 Softly worded public statements by the Shah of Iran and Saudi King
 Faysal have opened the way for a reconciliation between the two mon-
 archs. If the Shah reschedules his canceled visit to Saudi Arabia quickly,
 public animosity over conflicting Persian Gulf interests could be damped
 down.
 Peace talks between the Nigerian combatants have been scheduled for
 23 May in Kampala, Uganda, but prospects for an early cease-fire or the
 settlement of basic differences remain dim. In the only recent important
 military action in the civil war, federal troops seized the multimillion-
 dollar oil refinery near Port Harcourt, but probably will have difficulty in
 taking the city itself.

 ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTORS
 Extensive mineral resources
 have been attracting large-scale
 foreign investments into Angola
 and Mozambique despite continu-
 ing problems with insurgency in
 these Portuguese overseas ter-
 ritories.
 The bulk of foreign activity
 is concentrated in Angola, where
 several major undertakings have
 already been initiated.   The
 largest investment is being made
 by a US oil company, which is ex-
 ploiting petroleum deposits off-
 shore from Cabinda.   Some $125
 million will have been spent to
 develop these deposits by the
 end of this year, when produc-
 tion is scheduled to begin.
 Crude-oil production is expected
 to reach at least 150,000 barrels
 per day by 1970.
 Nearly $100 million has been
 invested by Western sources to
 develop iron-ore deposits in
 southern Angola, where reserves
 total an estimated 120 million
 tons of high-grade ore.   Exploi-
 tation of these deposits has
 already begun and production is
 expected to reach 5.5 million
 tons annually.   In addition, a
 number of Western firms are in-
 terested in other Angolan mineral
 deposits, which would require
 large investments.
 In Mozambique, foreign in-
 terest in developing the area's
 mineral resources has been more
 recent.  A Japanese firm report-
 edly has decided to invest some
 $50 million to exploit high-grade
 iron-ore deposits in northern
 Mozambique, where reserves are
 believed to total 360 million
 tons.   This would be the largest
 single foreign private investment
 in Mozambique to date.   Develop-
 ment of other iron-ore deposits
 nearby is now under consideration
 by a group of British, South
 African, and German firms, and
 several other companies are
 prospecting for additional min-
 eral deposits.  A number of
 foreign companies have become
 involved in oil exploration, and in-
 vestments by these firms over
 the next few years is expected
 to exceed $10 million.
 The willingness of foreign-
 ers to invest heavily in Angola
 and Mozambique reflects a belief
 that the rebels do not pose a
 threat to their investments.
 Although the guerrillas are ac-
 tive in both territories, the
 Portuguese have restricted them
 to areas of unknown or doubtful
 economic value.   Only the oil
 project at Cabinda is near in-
 surgent activity, and guerrilla
 operations there have been very

 SUDANESE ELECTIONS GUARANTEE RADICAL GOVERNMENT
 Moderate political forces
 in the Sudan lost heavily in the
 general elections concluded last
 week.
 Former prime minister Sadiq
 al-Mahdi's moderate faction of
 the Umma Party won fewer than
 40 seats in the country's 218-
 man Constituent Assembly.   The
 radical Democratic Unionist Party
 (DUP)--a coalition of the urban-
 based National Unionist Party and
 the basically pro-Egyptian Peo-
 ple's Democratic Party--captured
 over 100 seats and also holds
 the allegiance of another fac-
 tion of the Umma led by the imam
 of the Ansar sect.   The new gov-
 ernment has not yet been named,
 but will certainly be led by
 members of the DUP and the imam's
 faction of the Umma, who control
 the present cabinet.
 Sadiq himself lost his seat
 in the assembly, but reportedly
 now plans to run in a by-elec-
 tion in some safe constituency
 that will be vacated by one of
 his supporters.  Despite pros-
 pects of support from splinter
 parties and southern assembly
 members, however, Sadiq's chances
 of influencing the policies of
 the new government are minimal.
 His refusal last year to cooper-
 ate with leaders of the National
 Unionist Party seems to have
 killed his chances of regaining;
 leadership of the country for
 the foreseeable future.
 Several leaders of the DUP
 are now jockeying for the prime
 minister's post.   The office
 will probably go to anti-Western
 Muhammad Mahjoub, leader of the
 previous government, but the
 president of the People's Demo-
 cratic Party, Sheikh Ali Abdul
 Rahman, has also expressed an
 interest in the office.   Whoever
 leads it, the new government will
 certainly follow the policies
 initiated by its predecessor of
 tightening ties with the USSR and
 adhering  to a strident Arab na-
 tionalist line.
 Further confusion was brought
 to the Khartoum scene by the
 murder last week of William Deng,
 a long-time leader of the south-
 ern Sudanese.   Southerners have
 since been demonstrating against
 the government, attributing Den's
 death to Arab troops in the south,
 but the government claims that
 he was killed by southern insur-
 gents.   The southern Sudanese have
 been in rebellion against the
 Arab north for close to ten years,
 and the situation remains one of
 the most serious problems the
 new government will have to face.

 WARM WORDS THAW SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS
 Amicable public statements
 by Saudi King Faysal and the Shah
 of Iran appear to be clearing the
 way for a reconciliation between
 the two monarchs.
 Saudi-Iranian relations
 have been at an impasse since
 early February, when disputes
 over the status of Bahrain and
 of oil reserves in the Persian
 Gulf caused the Shah to cancel
 his visit to Saudi Arabia.   At
 issue specifically was a Saudi-
 Bahraini communique in which the
 Saudis stated their support for
 the government of the Iranian-
 claimed island.   During the three
 months since the cancellation of
 the Shah's visit, both rulers,
 believing themselves to be the
 aggrieved party, awaited a con-
 ciliatory gesture from the other.
 King Faysal appears to have
 broken the deadlock in a published
 interview with a Kuwaiti journal-
 ist, in which he recognized that
 Iranians as well as Arabs have
 rights and interests in the gulf.
 Faysal referred to the  "tradi-
 tional friendship" between Iran
 and Saudi Arabia, and said that
 the Shah would be welcome to
 visit.
 The Shah, meanwhile, had
 stated in another published in-
 terview that Iran, Saudi Arabia,
 and Kuwait should cooperate in
 gulf affairs and expressed a de-
 sire to visit "the friendly
 neighboring country as soon as
 possible."  Although the Shah's
 interview was hedged by refer-
 ences to Iranian "rights" in the
 gulf, Iranian officials said that
 he would have been even more forth-
 coming had the tenor of Faysal's
 interview been known.
 A rescheduling of the Shah's
 visit to Saudi Arabia is crucial
 to any genuine reconciliation.
 Until the two monarchs are able
 to deal directly, rather than
 through sometimes overzealous
 underlings, the issues outstand-
 ing between their countries are
 not likely to be resolved.   The
 Shah is reported to be very
 pleased by Faysal's remarks, and
 the Iranian press has given wide
 and highly favorable coverage to
 the King's interview.
 An apparent Iranian misread-
 ing of one Faysal statement may
 prove to be a stumbling block,
 however.   Faysal is quoted as
 saying that he has no desire to
 "build bridges" in the gulf, a
 statement that the Iranian press
 has taken to mean abandonment of
 the controversial project to
 build a causeway between Saudi
 Arabia and Bahrain.   Saudi of-
 ficials state, however, that the
 King was only speaking figura-
 tively, and that the causeway
 is still under consideration.
 In addition, the Shah may
 await the outcome of Moroccan
 mediation attempts and King Fay-
 sal's scheduled interview with
 an Iranian journalist before mak-
 ing a definite decision on a trip
 to Saudi Arabia.  Any such delays
 would provide new opportunities
 for semantic and other difficult-
 ies to arise.

 SOUTHERN YEMEN ARMY CONSOLIDATES ITS POSITION
 The army has made no direct
 move against the governing Na-
 tional Liberation Front  (NLF)               re-
 gime, but it is taking steps to
 suppress the Front's left-wing
 paramilitary arm, the "People's
 Guard."  Meanwhile, aid negotia-
 tions with Britain have been
 broken off, and the regime is
 desperately searching for aid
 from other sources.
 In Aden, the army and the
 public security forces have been
 quietly but systematically dis-
 arming the People's Guard and
 apprehending its leaders.   House-
 to-house searches have been made
 in some districts and many weapons
 have been confiscated.   In addi-
 tion, there have been fragmentary
 reports of fighting in upcoun-
 try areas.
 the army first undertook a
 campaign among the tribesmen to
 expose the People's Guard as a
 group of atheists bent on destroy-
 ing religion and on taking away
 tribal lands.   The tribes then
 cooperated with the army in dis-
 arming the People's Guard in
 most of the Western Protectorate.
 A left-wing leader detained
 in Aden after one of the army's
 initial  roundups  escaped last
 week to the rebellion-prone east-
 ern region of the country.   His
 presence probably inspired the
 abortive uprising that subse-
 quently occurred in the area and
 the renewed blasts of leftist
 propaganda emanating from Jukalla,
 the eastern capital.  This re-
 mote area will probably prove to
 be the last stronghold of left-
 wing resistance.
 Eastern defiance of Aden's
 authority is forcing the NLF
 leadership to choose between
 loyalty to former comrades and
 adherence to the general senti-
 ment in the country.   President
 al-Shabi's speeches indicate that
 Aden has chosen the second course
 and will use the army, formerly
 considered its chief opposition,
 against the left wingers.
 Meanwhile, aid talks with
 the British were broken off on
 10 May when the regime became
 convinced that the British were
 not going to increase their of-
 fer of about $6 million for a
 ten-month period.  No dramatic
 action against the British is
 likely, however, because some
 $12 million of the current
 agreement remains unpaid and
 the regime hopes to obtain this
 money as soon as possible.  A
 Southern Yemeni delegation is
 apparently slated to go to Mos-
 cow shortly to talk about aid.
 So far, however, the Soviets
 have offered only military equip-
 ment, and not the cash that the
 regime needs to stave off eco-
 nomic chaos.

 Domestic politics constituted the major news from Latin American
 countries this week.
 Most of the attention was focused on last Sunday's elections in
 Panama, which were characterized by even more fraud and intimidation
 than is usual. Both of the presidential contenders, David Samudio and
 Arnulfo Arias, are claiming victory. The government appears to be delay-
 ing release of the final results, which are being juggled to favor Samudio,
 for fear of touching off further violence.
 Bermuda is in its final week of campaigning before National As-
 sembly elections on 22 May. For the first time in history, traditional
 white rule over the island is being challenged by the Negro majority. In
 the Dominican Republic, municipal elections were being held on 16 May,
 with the main opposition party urging abstention as a protest against the
 Balaguer government.
 It appears that British Honduras will ask London to set up a con-
 ference that would eventually lead to the colony's independence. The
 proposed treaty that would have settled the long-standing dispute between
 Guatemala and Great Britain over British Honduras has already been
 rejected by the colony.
 In Chile, the Communists are moving ahead in their plans to form a
 broad leftist front for the congressional elections next year and the
 presidential election in 1970. Early this week the Communist Party and
 the leftist-controlled Radical Party issued a joint declaration calling for
 unity of all "progressive forces" to defend democracy. The statement also
 attacked the Frei government and challenged his party's "inefficient and
 undefined" policies.
 The Brazilian Government is still holding the Soviet space event
 support ship Kegostrov, and will not release it until the Soviets apologize
 in writing for their "involuntary violation" of Brazilian waters. Brazil has
 been increasingly touchy about the operation of Soviet ships,  articular)

 PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT RIGGING ELECTION RESULTS
 The outcome of last Sunday's
 voting has still not been an-
 nounced officially, but both
 candidates are claiming victory
 in the turbulent aftermath of
 an election marred by widespread
 fraud and intimidation.   The
 National Guard and progovernment
 goon squads played a prominent
 role in attempting to ensure the
 election of official candidate
 David Samudio.
 An outburst of violence be-
 tween the opposing political fac-
 tions on Monday evening resulted
 in the death of two opposition
 members and caused the progov-
 ernment, three-member electoral
 tribunal to delay release of un-
 official tallies.  Most sources,
 however, indicate that the tri-
 bunal is stalling for time in
 order to manipulate the final
 vote in Samudio's favor.  The
 National Board of Election Re-
 turns, composed of members of
 all political parties and sub-
 sidiary to the tribunal, is
 scheduled to begin the official
 count on 18 May, but it is still
 uncertain when an announcement
 of the winners will be made.
 the tribunal will be unable to
 certify the final results before
 June or July, but that when it
 does "Samudio will win by about
 6,000 votes."   In addition, the
 government is preparing to "se-
 lect" the winners of seats in
 the 42-member unicameral assembly
 to guarantee Samudio a safe ma-
 jority in that body.
 According to prearranged
 plans, the Robles government
 apparently intends gradually
 to increase the margin for Sa-
 mudio on the basis of late re-
 turns from the interior.  The
 election was unusually disorgan-
 ized, and delays at the local
 vote-counting centers have slowed
 the forwarding of polling records
 to Panama City.   It is possible
 that vote-juggling at these levels
 is partially responsible for
 the procrastination.
 National Union leader Ar-
 nulfo Arias may be unwilling to
 stand by passively while the gov-
 ernment seeks to cover up its
 fraud.   He is claiming to have
 won the election by a majority
 of over 45,000 votes.   If the
 tribunal does not declare his
 victory, Arias has threatened to
 turn his followers lose "to act',
 as they see best."   Under these
 circumstances, a new round of
 disorders could occur.
 any serious breakdown
 in public order would prompt the
 guard to take over the government.
 After Monday's rioting, Vallarino
 issued a communique stating that
 the guard would recognize the
 citizen who has been elected con-
 stitutional president through the
 popular will.  Although this some-
 what ambiguous statement suggested
 that Vallarino might not accept=
 the "citizen" blessed by the
 electoral authorities, any in-
 dependent judgment  on his part`
 would encounter vigorous opposi-
 tion from some of his senior guard
 commanders.

 CONFRONTATION BUILDING IN ARGENTINA
 President Ongania and Gen-
 eral Julio Alsogaray appear to
 be building up to an eventual
 confrontation.
 Relations between the Presi-
 dent and his army commander in
 chief have deteriorated since
 Alsogaray's appointment in late
 1966.  Alsogaray is a leader of
 the moderate or so-called "lib-
 eral" faction in the government
 that favors strict compliance
 with the "Statutes of the Revo-
 lution," the outline of economic,
 political, and social reforms
 promulgated by the military when
 it took power in June 1966.   His
 brother Alvaro, who is Argentina's
 ambassador to the US, is another
 influential leader of the moder-
 ates and has been helping put
 pressure on Ongania.
 The moderates are strongly
 opposed by the conservative, na-
 tionalistic faction that has
 talked about establishing a corp-
 orate state, similar in some re-
 spects to that of Franco's Spain.
 They envisage the development of
 councils at the municipal, pro-
 vincial, and national level made
 up of delegates from labor, busi-
 ness, civic, social and other
 organizations.   The councils
 would pass on legislation gener-
 ated by the executive.
 President Ongania, a retired
 general, is reported to be very
 sympathetic to his conservative
 advisers, but he has shrewdly
 maintained a position aloof from
 both sides.   Ongania is aware of
 General Alsogaray's maneuvering
 to gain support in the military
 and among civilian politicians,
 and he also knows that Alsogaray
 is an ambitious but not very popu-
 lar officer.   The President has
 let it be known that he will deal
 firrtly with any attempt by Also-
 garay to dominate or remove him.
 General Alsogaray faces pos-
 sib'e retirement in December 1968
 after he completes the standard
 two--year assignment as army com-
 mander.   Some of Alsogaray's ma-
 neuvering may be a sincere effort
 to prevent the conservatives from
 gaining sway over the President,
 but a good deal of it seems to
 be an attempt to avoid giving up
 the influential and prestigious
 army post.  .
 It seems probable that Presi-
 dent: Ongania will try to under-
 minE! Alsogaray's position in
 the army, making it easier for
 him to be replaced.  Alsogaray's
 attempts to counter this effort
 will. create further frictions,
 but neither the President nor
 the general is ready for an open

 PRESIDENTIAL RACE BROADENS IN ECUADOR
 The presidential campaign in
 Ecuador is no longer a two-man
 race.   Steady gains by center-
 left candidate Andres Cordoba
 may give him second place on
 2 June, although either demagogic
 Jose Maria Velasco or conserva-
 tive Camilo Ponce is still likely
 to win.  Even if Velasco loses,
 his help will almost certainly
 secure a potentially influential
 senate post for extremist Carlos
 Julio Arosemena, ousted from the
 presidency in 1963.
 The erosion of Velasco's
 initial lead in the campaign for
 the first national elections
 under Ecuador's new constitution
 is a result of several -factors.
 Although he is still vigorous at
 75, the four-time President seems
 to have lost some of his zest
 for campaigning.  Moreover, a
 confusing registration program
 has disenfranchised many eligible
 voters, particularly in the lower
 classes most responsive to Velas-
 co's charismatic appeal in past
 elections.   In addition, his re-
 fusal to disavow Carlos Julio
 Arosemena's support has estranged
 some of his more moderate support-
 ers and has probably reduced the
 flow of badly needed campaign
 funds.
 In this situation, Arosemena's
 campaign contributions, some of
 obscure origin, have improved
 his own bargaining position with
 Velasco.  Most importantly, he
 achieved his aim of having his
 name placed at the top of the
 velasquista congressional slate
 in Guayas Province.   Given
 Ecuador's proportional voting
 system and Velasco's strength in
 that coastal province, this top
 listing is tantamount to election.
 Arosemena hopes to use his proven
 political skill to become pres.-
 dent of the senate, a position;
 following the vice presidency in
 presidential succession.
 Arosemena's penchant for ex-
 tremist associations and activi-
 ties, not to mention alcohol,
 makes him anathema to Ecuado-
 rean military leaders.  They axe
 already concerned over recent ex-
 tremist-led student outbreaks
 which have closed schools and
 forced the education minister'::s
 resignation.  Arosemena's pos-
 sible re-emergence in a position
 of political power might overcome
 the aversion to political action
 they have displayed since the
 military junta was ousted in 1:966.
 Meanwhile, ex-president
 Ponce's coalition has been weak-
 ened by internal differences in
 the Conservative Party.   The
 Psychedelic Cybernetic candidate,
 representing the "brown-skinned
 masses," failed to gain enough
 signatures to be able to regidter
 for the election.   Interim Presi-
 dent Otto Arosemena's request
 that the Organization of Ameri-
 can States  (OAS)  send observers
 to the elections has caused some
 adverse comment in Ecuador anc
 could embarrass former Ecuado-
 rean president and incoming OAS
 Secretary General Galo Plaza
 Lasso.

 BERMUDAN ELECTIONS CHALLENGE TRADITIONAL WHITE RULE
 Bermuda's general elections
 on 22 May will bring the first
 real challenge to traditional
 white rule in the island's his-
 tory.   The elections,  the first
 since suffrage was extended to
 all citizens over 21, offer the
 two-thirds Negro majority an op-
 portunity for a greater voice in
 the 40-member National Assembly.
 The predominantly white
 United Bermuda Party  (UBP)  is
 being challenged by the over-
 whelmingly Negro Progressive
 Labor Party  (PLP), which is
 stressing "black power" in its
 appeal to the 55 percent of the
 registered voters who are Negro.
 The PLP's radical image, however,
 may cause some Negro voters to
 throw their support to the small
 and more moderate biracial Ber-
 muda Democratic Party.
 The expansion of the vot4ng
 rolls, together with recent r*-
 districting and the impact of the
 race issue, make the election'
 outcome uncertain, but the UBP
 appears to have a slight edge'be-
 cause the electoral boundarie$
 are in its favor.   Recognizin
 its need to attract Negro vot s,
 the UBP has adopted a position
 supporting racial integration',and
 is running 13 Negro candidate*.
 British officials believ4
 that a UBP victory could provoke
 outbursts of violence similar to
 the racial disturbances last
 month.   The British troops air-
 lifted from London to help con-
 trol these disturbances will re-
