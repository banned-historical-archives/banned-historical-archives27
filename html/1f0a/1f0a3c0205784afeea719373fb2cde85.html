 Belgium: Fleming-Walloon Antagonism-Impact
 on the Military                                              ~
 Belgium's armed forces have made great strides in equalizing
 treatment of their Dutch-speaking Flemings and French-speaking
 Walloons, but the linguistic problem-with all the social and
 cultural differences it symbolizes-remains potentially divisive. In
 wartime, the maintenance of separate Flemish and Walloon combat
 and support units could well obstruct the effectiveness and cohesion
 of Belgium's NATO corps.
 Yugoslavia-Libya: Ties Strong Despite Recent Strains
 Yugoslavia continues to maintain close relations with Libya since
 the US airstrike last April, although the ties have suffered new
 tensions. Tripoli remains an important economic partner, and
 political and security relations are strong.
 East Germany-China: Honecker's Visit
 East German leader Honecker's trip to China in late October was
 hailed by both sides as ushering in a new era in bilateral relations.
 The Soviets had to be on board for the visit, but Honecker's
 avoidance of touchy political subjects and the absence of a
 communique suggest an attempt to lower the profile of the trip.

 Briefs
 Nordic Countries       Responses to the Reykjavik Talks
 Nordic reactions to the 11-12 October meeting between President Reagan and
 General Secretary Gorbachev have swung from unrealistic expectations to
 pessimism to guarded optimism. Typical of the presummit anticipation was a 10
 October Norwegian news headline, "Missile Agreement in Sight," accompanied
 by a photograph of the President disembarking in Reykjavik. The high
 expectations gave way to deep disappointment, however, when the US and Soviet
 leaders left without reaching any specific agreements. While Nordic governments
 made generally balanced statements of dissatisfaction, the press and leftist
 politicians quickly labeled the meeting a fiasco and failure. Government and
 opposition parties both believed the reason for the failure was Washington's
 unwillingness to negotiate on the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Moscow,
 however, was credited with taking the lead in putting forth proposals. Official and
 press commentaries also expressed fears that the collapse of the talks might lead to
 a "new cold war."
 Disappointment turned to cautious optimism, however, as both US and Soviet
 public statements noted the progress made in a number of areas and highlighted
 the fact that the proposals made in Reykjavik remain on the table in Geneva.
 Postmeeting briefings to the Nordic governments from both sides hammered at
 these points even more clearly. Although the media still characterized SDI as the
 major obstacle to an arms control agreement, the upbeat analyses that surfaced
 around 15 October implied that Washington need not be blamed unduly for any
 failure. Indeed, some conservative editorials blamed Moscow for deliberately
 holding generous concessions hostage to demands to restrict defense testing that
 they knew Washington would reject.
 While the media made no mention of Soviet strategic defense programs, SDI was
 frequently paired with such sweeping, negative terms as "militarization of space,"
 "space weapons," "arms race in space," and "star wars." Finnish Prime Minister
 Kalevi Sorsa-who is also chairman of Socialist International's Disarmament
 Committee-questioned why one would reduce strategic arsenals if "new strategic
 weapons would be developed which can be used for both defense and attack."
 Soviet compliance with arms agreements was not questioned, but US compliance
 with the ABM Treaty was a topic of considerable interest to policymakers and the
 media. While many papers finally acquitted the United States of blame for the
 Reykjavik failure, the harshest criticism of the Soviet Union came not from
 NATO Allies Norway, Denmark, and Iceland but from the conservative press in
 Sweden-a neutral country.

 Norway                 Debate Over Defense Budget
 In a break with tradition, the Chief of the Defense Staff has entered the public
 debate on Norway's future defense spending. According to the US Embassy,
 General Bull-Hansen has released a Defense Commission study concluding that
 because of inadequate funding Norway's armed forces will be incapable of meeting
 their wartime commitments. He has warned publicly that, unless the planned
 annual real growth in defense spending is doubled from 3 percent to 6 percent,
 government officials will be forced to choose between defending the remote but
 strategically important north or the populous south.
 Bull-Hansen is frustrated by his lack of success in increasing the defense budget
 and hopes that his scare tactic will generate additional public support for increased
 spending. The General's comments may give the Conservative opposition a
 stronger argument for increasing the Labor government's spending plans during
 the parliamentary debate on the defense budget scheduled later this month.
 Although Bull-Hansen has violated the traditional prohibition on policy
 pronouncements by the military, Defense Minister Holst-himself controversial
 for his stance on security issues-is unlikely to reprimand the popular defense
 chief.

 France               New Military Program
 continue to set annually.
 France's new defense program is an ambitious attempt to modernize most of its
 armed forces and to increase funding for programs delayed under the previous
 Socialist government. According to US Embassy reporting, the French Cabinet
 early this month approved a five-year military program law that includes funding
 for a new submarine, a new mobile intermediate-range ballistic missile, and a
 number of conventional arms programs. According to the Embassy, the plan calls
 for equipment expenditures of more than $70 billion-an average annual real
 growth rate of 6 percent, although only 4.5 percent after 1988. The program law
 makes no projections, however, for operating expenditures, which Paris will
 to preserve funds for military procurement.
 The new program maintains President Mitterrand's emphasis on strategic forces
 but also gives Defense Minister Giraud substantially increased funding for other
 forces. The planned sharp increases in military spending are an attempt to give
 substance to Prime Minister Chirac's commitment to defense and to highlight the
 differences between his administration and the Socialists in preparation for the
 1988 presidential election. Fiscal constraints probably will force Paris to scale
 back some goals after 1988, slipping some programs-particularly conventional
 arms projects-curtailing operating expenditures, and paring military manpower

 Getting Tough on Drugs
 The Chirac government has proposed new antinarcotics measures featuring stiffer
 penalties for drug traffickers and users, but interagency squabbling will probably
 continue to hamper French efforts. Other measures provide for new youth
 treatment facilities, a national drug abuse institute, and an additional $40 million
 for antinarcotics efforts. A proposal to imprison drug users who fail to complete
 treatment programs has provoked controversy, but                     the
 two parties that control the National Assembly support all of the measures and
 will probably pass the package. The emphasis on punitive measures is new but in
 line with the government's tough stance on law and order and its campaign
 promises.
 The measures will probably lead to greater French cooperation with regional and
 international antidrug efforts.
 does not support a new international convention on drug trafficking because it
 views the draft convention as too ambitious. Given their hesitant attitude toward
 international collaboration of any sort, however, French cooperation is still likely
 to be limited.
 Cracking Down on Illegal Aliens
 Human rights activists across France are reportedly gearing up for an assault on
 the Chirac government's most controversial tactic for handling the problem of
 illegal immigration.                                   some 1,700
 foreigners were expelled from France since 9 September under new legislation that
 permits quick expulsions by streamlined administrative action. Acting on
 suspicions of terrorist links, the government expelled Basques to Spain and
 assorted Middle Easterners-most notably Lebanese-to their native countries.
 The largest number of expellees were Africans, some of whom were suspected of
 drug trafficking.
 The Chirac government is unlikely to be intimidated by the protests of leftist
 politicians and antiracist groups and will probably expel even more illegal aliens in
 the future. Expulsions appear to be popular with French voters, who apparently see
 them as an effective tool for intimidating terrorist sympathizers. Chirac, moreover,
 almost certainly believes that expulsions will prove valuable in stealing the anti-
 immigrant thunder of the extreme right National Front.

 Yugoslavia           Political Tensions Heighten in South
 Increasingly assertive ethnic nationalism in the southern Republic of Serbia is
 aggravating tensions among the country's many regions and ethnic groups. Several
 recent developments have added to nationwide concern:
 ? The media in September exposed a draft study by Serbian intellectuals that
 claims Yugoslavia is ruled by an anti-Serbian coalition.
 ? Serbian officials have renewed calls for greater control over the republic's two
 independent-minded autonomous provinces.
 ? In early November ethnic Serbs from Serbia's province of Kosovo protested in
 Belgrade against the nationalist behavior of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
 Both individual regions and the federation have taken unusually strong steps to
 show displeasure. The highest federal state and party bodies early in November
 issued a sharp public warning about nationalism, citing Serbia by name. Officials
 in the Serbian province of Vojvodina have publicly and bitterly attacked Serbian
 leaders, while other regions have joined in with media criticism. The southern
 Republic of Macedonia has proved an exception, focusing instead on problems
 caused by its own ethnic Albanian minority and purging several Albanian officials
 for allegedly nationalist activities.
 The Serbian leadership for now appears unlikely to move against the republic's
 ethnic nationalists. Top officials have rejected outside criticism as unacceptable,
 and some apparently tacitly support nationalist activities. Sentiment in other
 regions to try to force a Serbian crackdown-by applying pressure through the
 federal party, for example-is likely to grow, particularly if Serbian nationalism in

 Greece: A Balancing Act on
 Counterterrorism
 Prime Minister Papandreou appears to be following a
 two-track strategy on terrorism. His government has
 been unwilling to point a finger at or take joint action
 against countries suspected of abetting terrorism-a
 position highlighted most recently by his refusal to
 support the EC's condemnation of Syria. Over the
 past year, however, Papandreou has become
 increasingly aware of the threat posed to Greek
 security and economic interests by international
 terrorism and has adopted a position of explicit
 condemnation of terrorism in general. His government
 has also moved to strengthen its counterterrorist
 capabilities.
 The net effect of this dualistic approach to terrorism
 is to raise questions about Papandreou's motivations
 and intentions. We suspect that Greek thinking on
 terrorism has not entirely crystallized and that
 Papandreou, to some extent, has molded his approach
 to fit the exigencies of the moment. Yet, to the extent
 that Papandreou has a policy, we suspect it is meant
 to reflect what he believes is a middle ground:
 ? To uphold historical Greek ties to the Arab world
 and his own leftist credentials, Papandreou has set
 himself apart from the United States and the other
 EC countries by refusing to agree to impose EC
 sanctions against Libya or to condemn either Libya
 or Syria by name.
 ? To placate Greece's Western allies and counter the
 domestic terrorist problem, he has taken a number
 of steps suggesting a greater commitment to
 combating terrorism on Greek soil.
 The International Stance
 Seen in the context of a political career extending over
 more than two decades, the Papandreou government's
 latest pronouncements in the EC are consistent with
 Papandreou's past positions and what we know of his
 world view. We have no reason to doubt that
 Papandreou views the world through ideological
 spectacles and that his instinctive reaction to any
 situation involving conflict between a major power-
 particularly the United States or, by extension, the
 United Kingdom-and a representative of the Third
 World is to identify with the latter. This is all the
 more true when it is an Arab Third World country
 because he envisions a unique mission for Greece as a
 bridge to Western Europe. Although it plays only a
 minor role in the Middle East, Greece has sought
 closer ties to the Arabs and has supported the Arab
 case against Israel since the 1970s.
 In addition, from Papandreou's perspective there are
 compelling political, economic, and security reasons to
 try to avoid aligning himself with the United States
 against Libya or Syria, however convincing the
 evidence:
 ? For domestic political reasons, Papandreou may feel
 it necessary to assert his leftist credentials after his
 Socialist party's relatively poor showing in the
 recent municipal election. Because his standing with
 leftist voters has been undermined by his economic
 austerity program and efforts to seek better
 relations with Washington, he may try to mollify
 them with rhetoric and support where he thinks he
 can afford it.
 ? Simple fear is another likely motive-fear of
 reprisals and of various Arab threats to Greek
 security. Greece has a large resident Arab
 population, and Athens has already been the scene
 of numerous Arab-sponsored terrorist incidents.
 Papandreou may also fear direct military
 retaliation, given Greece's proximity to the Middle
 East and the presence of US bases on Greek soil. A
 US naval base on Crete, for instance, is only 160
 kilometers from the Libyan coast.

 ? Greece also stands to lose vis-a-vis its rivalry with
 Turkey if any of its Arab friends turn against it.
 Greece and Turkey compete for Arab support, and a
 break with any Arab state could provoke a
 movement to grant official recognition to the
 Turkish Cypriot "state" in northern Cyprus.
 ? Trade has traditionally been the prime motivation
 for Greece's policy of expanding ties to the Middle
 East-its dependence on Arab oil, its desire to
 attract sorely needed investment, and the prospect
 of lucrative markets for its agricultural products
 and technical services. Although exports to Libya
 and Syria are now insignificant-amounting
 together to only about 2 percent of total Greek
 exports-Athens has been slow to give up hope that
 political friendship can be converted into economic
 rewards. As part of this strategy, Papandreou
 recently signed a bilateral agreement with Syria
 that he hopes will quintuple bilateral trade to $250
 million in two years.
 Improved Counterterrorist Capabilities
 Greece's stance against terrorism in general has
 improved markedly since the hijacking of the TWA
 airliner from Athens and the subsequent issuance of a
 US travel advisory last year. This improvement
 results from a convergence of factors including the
 dramatic drop in US tourism, a genuine desire to
 maintain a workable relationship with the United
 States and the EC, and an increase in domestic
 terrorist activity directed against the government.
 Potentially the most significant action the government
 took was to put Antonios Drossoyiannis in charge of
 Greece's counterterrorist effort in April and further
 centralize that effort within the Ministry of Public
 Order. In the past, counterterrorist responsibilities
 were spread across several ministries with the result
 that the government was hampered by interservice
 rivalry, compartmentalization of information, and
 operational coordination problems. Drossoyiannis told
 US officials that his ministry is now meant to take
 special responsibility for counterterrorism and that he
 is planning to create special antiterrorist police
 response teams.
 Since his appointment as Minister of Public Order,
 Drossoyiannis has taken strong antiterrorist positions
 and made a number of personnel changes at the top of
 the ministry, which suggests he is trying to improve
 police effectiveness and competence. The US
 Embassy has reported, for example, an appreciable
 improvement in police response to mission requests for
 protection and investigations. In addition, over the
 past year Greece has agreed to participate in three
 US-sponsored counterterrorist training programs and
 a terrorism intelligence exchange program with the
 Italians, a vast improvement over former training
 programs
 The government has also upgraded security at Athens
 international airport since the TWA hijacking.
 Physical improvements include an increase in trained
 manpower, better screening equipment and
 procedures, and the stationing of armored vehicles
 and police patrol cars around the airport perimeter at
 all times. The airport was previously considered the
 least secure in Europe.
 Outlook
 The Papandreou government's counterterrorist policy
 is still fluid and subject to change. To the extent that
 a policy has been developed, however, it appears to be
 a two-tracked one aimed at appeasing both the West
 and the Arab world. This will not always be possible,
 and we are likely to see more instances-such as in
 the recent Syrian case-where Greece irritates its
 West European allies for seemingly little gain in its
 relations elsewhere.

 Belgium: Fleming-Walloon
 Antagonism-Impact on
 the Military
 The Belgian armed forces have made great progress
 in equalizing treatment of the country's dominant
 linguistic groups, the Flemings and Walloons, but the
 language problem-with all the social and cultural
 differences it symbolizes-remains a potentially
 divisive issue. The complex of legal requirements and
 customs protecting the rights of ethnic groups within
 the military services has placed a heavy burden on the
 Belgian defense effort, increasing its costs and
 reducing its efficiency: military procurement
 programs have been delayed and their costs increased
 because of a requirement to allocate contracts
 between Flanders and Wallonia; the necessity of
 providing instruction in both French and Dutch has
 increased training costs; and assignments and
 promotions have been affected by the need to
 maintain a Fleming-Walloon balance. In addition, the
 maintenance of separate Flemish and Walloon
 combat and support units could well have a serious
 impact on the overall effectiveness and cohesion of
 Belgium's NATO corps under the stress of wartime
 combat conditions.
 The Belgian Army: Mostly Unilingual Units
 The principal combat units of the Belgian Army are
 concentrated in its I Corps, made up of two divisions.
 The Belgian 1st Mechanized Infantry Division,
 redeployed from Germany to Belgium in the 1970s,
 contains a Flemish mechanized infantry brigade at
 Leopoldsburg and a Walloon mechanized infantry
 brigade at Marche-en-Famenne. The Belgian 16th
 Mechanized Division, forward deployed in West
 Germany, has a Flemish mechanized infantry brigade
 at Soest and an anomalous mixed-language armored
 brigade at Siegen. In wartime the Belgian I Corps
 would be augmented by two reserve brigades deployed
 from Belgium: the Flemish mechanized infantry
 brigade based at Zonhoven and a Walloon
 mechanized infantry brigade from Eghezee. The I
 Corps also has a number of unilingual artillery, air
 defense, reconnaissance, and logistic units stationed in
 the Federal Republic of Germany, which reflect a
 balance of Flemish- and French-speaking units. The
 elite Paracommando Regiment, also capable of
 reinforcing the corps in wartime, is the other major
 mixed-language combat unit: of its three active
 battalions, one is Flemish, one is Walloon, and the
 third has troops of both linguistic groups.
 Belgian enlisted troops are organized in unilingual
 units, but all Army officers are required to have at
 least a working knowledge of their nonnative tongue.
 Considerable fluency in the second language is
 required for promotion to major and beyond. In
 addition, many officers speak at least some English,
 which is the language of artillery and air defense fire
 commands in the Belgian Army. These measures to
 assure a bilingual officer corps that can also converse
 with its NATO allies have drastically reduced the risk
 of language-based tactical communication problems
 between units. Division and higher headquarters are
 officially designated as mixed-language units as are
 the headquarters of the 17th Armored Brigade and
 the Paracommando Regiment

 The Language Problem in Historical Perspective
 Origins. The Belgian military's language problem
 finds its roots in the 18th century period of Austrian
 rule. At that time, French-the language of the
 Austrian court as well as the native tongue in
 Wallonia-was adopted by the upper classes in
 Dutch-speaking Flanders as well. This development
 was later to spawn the language problems of the
 Belgian Army since its officer corps would be drawn
 until the 1970s largely from the French-speaking
 aristocracy of both Flanders and Wallonia.
 World War I. Agitation for equal status for the
 Flemish language began in the 1840s. By 1914
 growing Flemish nationalist sentiment had forced the
 use of Dutch in the courts and more broadly in the
 schools-but not in the Army. In 1914 neither the
 commanders who gave the orders nor the doctors who
 treated the Belgian wounded spoke Dutch. After
 overrunning most of the country the Germans
 shrewdly promoted Flemish rights in occupied
 Belgium to gain support, and some Flemings
 collaborated. As the war lengthened, Flemish study
 and discussion groups appeared in the ranks of the
 Belgian Army and these gave birth to a defeatist
 Front Movement. In 1917 several mutinies erupted
 among Flemish enlisted troops. Imperial Germany
 collapsed in 1918, but the deep-seated Fleming-
 Walloon animosity had been revealed as a serious
 Belgian vulnerability. An enemy had been able to
 exploit this weakness, and linguistic grievances had
 been a major factor in declining Belgian combat
 strength beginning in 1917.
 The Interwar Period. Following World War I,
 continued agitation by Flemish nationalists forced
 the Belgian Government to resume its efforts to
 equalize the status of the two languages in the
 administration and in the schools, and in 1930 a new
 law provided for division of the Belgian Army into
 unilingual French- and Dutch-speaking regiments.
 The two languages were also given equal status in the
 Military School in Brussels, and officers were
 required to know the language of the troops they
 commanded. These reforms, however, were not fully
 implemented: the Belgian officer corps in 1940 was
 still predominantly French speaking.
 World War II. Following Belgium's collapse in 1940,
 the Germans again moved quickly to exploit
 linguistic antagonisms in Occupied Belgium: Flemish
 enlisted POWs were released, while officers and
 Walloon troops remained captive, and the Germans
 again promoted Flemish interests in education and
 administration. As a result, the Belgian resistance
 movement was primarily Walloon-indeed, pro-
 German Flemings organized antisabotage groups to
 help the Nazis against the Resistance. Although only
 a minority of Flemings collaborated, the experience
 of the second occupation served to reinforce ethnic
 antagonisms.
 The Postwar Period. The reconstituted Belgian Army
 was still led by a predominantly French-speaking
 officer corps until the early 1970s, but since then the
 balance has greatly improved. Today about 60
 percent of the officers list Dutch as their original
 language, which reflects closely the overall Fleming-
 Walloon split among Army personnel. Belgian
 military laws establish the right of the citizen to use
 his native tongue while performing his military
 service, and Flemish units are now commanded by
 Dutch-speaking officers. There is even a single
 German-speaking company to accommodate the
 small German minority living in Belgium's eastern
 cantons. According to attache reporting, this
 exceptional unit often is in demand as an aggressor
 force for other units' exercises. The unit is well
 integrated into a Walloon battalion, whose
 headquarters and other two companies are French
 speaking.

 Almost all Air Force officers are trilingual in French,
 Flemish, and English-the operational language of
 the pilots. Many enlisted maintenance and support
 personnel, however, know only French or Flemish.
 The Air Force's growing pilot shortage has been
 aggravated by a nearly complete lack of new Walloon
 pilot candidates, and the mix of pilots is skewing
 sharply in favor of Flemings.

 difficulty finding pilots for the wing at Florennes,
 deep in Wallonia. At the same time, the maintenance
 and support troops of the mixed-language 3rd
 Tactical Wing are now approximately two-thirds
 French-speaking Walloons. Because of these trends,
 we believe the Air Force could face a resurgence of
 Fleming-Walloon tensions in its ranks if the mix of
 personnel in dual-language units gets too far out of
 balance-a problem for which there appear to be few
 The Belgian Navy: Mostly Fleming But Not a Problem
 Although the overall Fleming-Walloon mix in the
 military is officially set at a ratio of 60:40, the Navy is
 unofficially authorized a 70:30 split in favor of
 Flemings because of Navy recruiting problems in
 Wallonia. Young Walloons are reluctant to volunteer
 for the Navy because they would have to live near the
 naval bases on the Flemish coast. As a result, all Navy
 draftees are Walloon just to maintain the language
 balance-and Fleming naval volunteers must be
 rejected. The Navy has been able to meet the
 language balance requirement for junior officers, but
 senior officer ranks are skewed much more sharply
 toward Flemings with 87 percent of the captains, 75
 percent of the commanders, and 79 percent of the
 lieutenant commanders. The Navy's Chief of Staff,
 his deputy, and the only two captains considered
 eligible for flag rank selection in the next two years
 are Flemings, so it is probable that the Navy's top
 leadership will remain Flemish until at least 1990.
 This imbalance, however, does not seem to concern
 ' Flemish pilots are willing to serve at these two bases, which are
 near Flemish areas where their children can be educated in the
 tongue.
 Walloons, according to attache reporting. Many
 Walloons believe that their Navy is naturally a
 Flemish service because the coast is Flemish. Despite
 the Flemish dominance, we believe that the Belgian
 Navy has no major language communication problem.
 The navy officer corps and many of the petty officers
 are bilingual, and English is used exclusively in
 NATO maneuvers. Some nonrated personnel are
 unilingual, but they generally are assigned the less
 technical tasks and are addressed in their mother
 Impact of the Language Problem
 The complex of legal requirements and customs
 regulating the rights of ethnic groups in the military
 seriously burdens the budget-constrained Belgian
 defense effort. The government's freedom to choose
 the best officers for senior positions is restricted by
 the need to balance promotions between Flemings and
 Walloons, and the requirement to provide training in
 two languages is costly. Defense procurements are
 delayed by the protracted government negotiations
 that allocate the economic benefits of defense           25X1
 contracts between Flanders and Wallonia. Potentially
 most important, the organization of Flemings and
 Walloons into separate ethnic units could hamper
 tactical flexibility on a future battlefield.
 Slower, More Costly Defense Procurement.
 In 1983, in
 an attempt to speed up the contracting process and
 improve cost efficiency, the coalition government
 grouped six high-tech procurement programs before
 making the regional allocations.' The agreed formula
 allocated 55 percent of economic benefits to Flanders,
 35 percent to Wallonia, and 10 percent to Brussels.
 Theoretically the region with the best qualified or

 Secret
 most cost efficient firms might receive 100 percent of
 one contract because the other areas could be
 compensated with a bigger slice of the other projects
 in the omnibus agreement.
 The new plan has not worked well in practice,
 however. At the start Wallonia got the biggest single
 contract, for the additional F-16s, because the
 original lot was produced there. The Walloons also
 got part of the other early awards-the artillery and
 HF radio contracts-and Flanders was in line to get
 most of the rest. After the 1985 national elections,
 however, Walloons replaced Flemings as Ministers of
 Defense and Economic Affairs. The new Defense
 Minister-anxious to improve procurement cost
 efficiencies and concerned that Flanders lacked the
 aeronautical expertise to handle the helicopter
 contract efficiently-announced that the new
 government coalition (Martens VI) was not bound by
 the 1983 six-project agreement. This action incensed
 the Flemish community, and Prime Minister Martens
 had to reconfirm the previous allocations. By this
 time, however, the contracts had been delayed for
 months. Because of budget constraints the Defense
 Minister next chose to maintain defense spending for
 unit training rather than fund the attack helicopter
 procurement, which was deferred. The helicopter
 affair has thoroughly antagonized the majority
 Flemish interests, and we expect the next major
 defense contract negotiations to be long and difficult.
 Negative Effect on Promotion and Assignment. The
 need to maintain agreed Fleming-Walloon balances in
 the military has a pervasive negative impact on both
 promotions and assignments. The Belgian Army's six
 lieutenant general slots are split evenly among
 Walloons and Flemings, and each change of
 assignment is watched closely, particularly by the
 hypersensitive Flemish segment of the press. The
 regional sensitivities thus prevent the government
 from chosing the Army's high command solely on the
 basis of leadership qualities. The National Police
 cannot add a needed fifth general officer slot because
 a balance now exists between Fleming and Walloon
 police generals. The Belgian Navy must take Walloon
 draftees rather than more highly motivated Flemish
 volunteers to preserve the necessary ethnic mix.
 Increased Training Costs. The guarantee that every
 Belgian may perform his military service using his
 native tongue increases training costs at many levels.
 Field grade officers at the Belgian War College insist
 on using their native language even though they all
 are bilingual. The college must prepare course
 materials in both languages and teach each subject
 twice. Sometimes two different guest speakers must
 be invited and paid to lecture on the same subject in
 two languages. Fleming-Walloon anxieties have also
 prevented full consolidation of F-16 flight training at
 Beauvechain, requiring costly duplication of part of
 the training program at the two unilingual airbases.
 This duplication prevails throughout the Belgian
 military education and training establishment.
 Ethnically Homogeneous Units May Limit Tactical
 Flexibility. A bilingual officer corps and a broad
 operational use of English minimize the risk that
 language problems will hamper tactical
 communications. The maintenance of unilingual,
 ethnically homogeneous units and the way they are
 grouped, nevertheless, suggests that the Belgian
 leadership must have doubts about the willingness of
 Flemings and Walloons to cooperate effectively in
 wartime. Fleming and Walloon brigades are
 supported by same-language logistic companies
 integral to each brigade. Flemish brigades are
 supported by Flemish artillery battalions, Walloon
 brigades by Walloon artillery. The mixed-language
 17th Armored Brigade can be broken down into two
 unilingual, balanced armor-infantry task forces of two
 battalions each.
 The care Belgium has taken to organize its Walloons
 and Flemings separately for battle is significant
 because we believe the Belgian Army's officers corps
 lacks ethnic cohesion. While the officer corps is
 thoroughly professional, its two ethnic components
 reflect the same divisions apparent throughout
 Belgian society. Walloon and Flemish officers work
 together, but they do not socialize. These officers
 jealously protect their language rights as they pass
 through the military education system even though
 they are bilingual. They are still quick to take offense

 if not addressed or answered in what they consider the
 proper language. An officer corps that takes offense
 at such trivial matters is one that we believe ethnic
 animosities could divide in periods of national stress.
 The failure of the Belgian Army experiment with
 ethnically integrated units in the 1950s increases our
 concern. At that time, there were ethnically motivated
 riots among the troops as well as scuffles and
 incidents of noncooperation between Walloon and
 Fleming officers. The attempt at ethnic integration in
 the Army was a serious failure that had to be
 abandoned
 The apparent intention of employing the Belgian I
 Corps in battle with units grouped ethnically could
 mean tactical delays and complications under the
 pressure of a heavy Soviet attack. Many experienced
 observers of the Belgian Army disagree, noting that in
 peacetime exercises, Fleming and Walloon units are
 routinely directed to support each other. The latest
 example of cooperation between different ethnic units
 occurred during the September 1986 Crossed Swords
 exercise in West Germany. Yet, the ethnic hostilities
 that permeate Belgian society caused the Belgian
 Prime Minister to submit his resignation a month
 later, and the Belgian military is acutely aware of
 such developments. Despite the evidence of ethnic
 cooperation in peacetime, the corps command must
 question how well Fleming and Walloon units would
 support each other in combat, and whether units and
 artillery support could be quickly shifted between
 brigade sectors. While training and equipment
 deficiencies of the Belgian Corps might be more
 significant in wartime, the sudden reemergence of
 ethnic mistrust among Belgian units might also be an
 important factor degrading Belgian combat
 performance. Poor cooperation between Fleming and
 Walloon units could become increasingly likely if the
 Belgian Corps were being pushed back and were in
 danger of being cut off or routed.

 Yugoslavia-Libya: Ties Strong
 Despite Recent Strains
 Yugoslavia has continued to maintain close, extensive
 ties to Libya since the US airstrike last April,
 although the relationship has undergone new strains.
 Qadhafi miffed the Yugoslavs with his behavior at the
 recent Nonaligned summit in Harare, and Tripoli's
 poor record in paying its bills has caused more open
 Yugoslav dissatisfaction. But Libya remains an
 important economic partner, and overall political
 relations remain sound. We believe Belgrade would
 distance itself from Tripoli-and then perhaps
 selectively or for a limited period-only in the event
 of more egregious Libyan international actions or
 severe complications in bilateral economic ties.
 Political Relations-Ruffled by Minor Irritants
 Yugoslav officials in private have long indicated
 discomfort with Colonel Qadhafi's behavior and
 policies, but they have appeared unusually annoyed
 with his actions during the past seven months.
 Although Belgrade gave Tripoli exceptionally strong
 public support after the US bombing last April, senior
 officials in Belgrade told the US Ambassador that
 they do not defend the "stupidities" of Libyan policy.
 Since that time, Qadhafi on at least two occasions has
 called into question the very policy of nonalignment, a
 sacrosanct principle of Yugoslav foreign policy:
 ? Belgrade appears particularly unhappy with
 Qadhafi's proposal, made after the airstrike, that
 Libya abandon the Nonaligned Movement and join
 the Warsaw Pact. US diplomats report that senior
 say that Belgrade refused to grant transit
 rig is to Soviet supply aircraft after the April
 airstrike, apparently because of concern about an
 expanded Soviet role in Libya.
 senior officials were
 angered by Qadhafi's heavily publicized assertions
 at the Harare summit last August that the
 Nonaligned Movement, which Tito helped found, is
 ineffective. The Yugoslav media, presumably with
 the government's blessing, strongly criticized
 Qadhafi's speech-extremely unusual treatment for
 the head of a fellow nonaligned country. Moreover,
 a Yugoslav journalist recently told US diplomats
 that, in response to the speech, Belgrade is ignoring
 a request from Qadhafi to visit Yugoslavia.F25X1
 These signs of Yugoslav discomfiture, however, have
 not yet had a broader impact on political relations.
 Despite media criticism, no Yugoslav official has
 publicly criticized Tripoli. Belgrade labeled the
 atmosphere during the Libyan Foreign Minister's visit    25X1
 to Belgrade last June as cordial and friendly. And
 press reports emphasized satisfaction with bilateral
 cooperation during Yugoslav Deputy Premier
 Zemljaric's visit to Tripoli last September.
 Economic Ties-Solid Despite Problems
 Much of Yugoslavia's interest in Libya stems from its
 lucrative economic dealings with Tripoli. However,
 Libya's mounting financial difficulties caused by soft
 oil prices have taken their toll on this relationship over
 the past year and a half:
 ? Yugoslav exports to Libya of nonmilitary goods fell
 to $100 million in 1985, roughly half the level of
 1984.
 ? The value of new civilian and military construction
 contracts awarded to Yugoslav firms was also
 reportedly off sharply last year. The figures for
 1986 probably will be no higher.
 ? Yugoslav exports of military goods and services
 also appear to be falling.

 Nonetheless, Libya remains a relatively attractive
 market for Yugoslavia largely because financially
 strapped Belgrade lacks good alternatives:
 ? Despite the drop in exports, Deputy Foreign
 Minister Loncar recently told the US Ambassador
 that trade with Libya-apparently excluding most
 military goods and services-is worth about $500
 million a year and is too important to abandon.
 ? Despite the slowdown, Libya has signed new
 contracts for civilian construction and repair
 projects and is negotiating on some military-related
 contracts. Yugoslav construction firms are
 estimated to be involved in some $2-3 billion worth
 of ongoing projects, placing Libya second only to
 Iraq in terms of Yugoslavia's foreign construction
 earnings. This comes at a time when the volume of
 new construction business is down steeply both in
 Yugoslavia and worldwide.
 ? While Yugoslav military-related exports to Libya
 are down, the Libyan market retains its importance
 because estimated worldwide Yugoslav military
 exports have also dropped sharply.
 Yugoslavia will continue to supply Libya
 with small numbers of trainer aircraft, minisubs,
 and small surface ships. Yugoslavia reportedly will
 also continue to train pilots, technicians, and
 officers.
 Yugoslav media reports have indicated Belgrade's
 dissatisfaction over its financial dealings with Tripoli,
 particularly Libya's failure to pay in a timely fashion
 for work completed. Such difficulties, however, are
 not new. Negotiations over each side's mutual debts
 and overdue claims have dragged on for some time.
 Belgrade has grudgingly accepted Libyan oil in
 payment for Yugoslav goods and services. Given
 Libya's large debt to Yugoslavia and lack of options,
 Belgrade has been in no position to reject
 compensation in oil, which it can use to meet domestic
 needs or sell for hard currency.
 US Concerns-An Inhibiting Factor
 Although military-security and commercial relations
 continue between Yugoslavia and Libya, the US
 stance toward Tripoli may induce Belgrade to take
 stock of its policy. A Deputy Foreign Minister told the
 US Ambassador last September that he was painfully
 aware that Belgrade's good ties to Qadhafi have
 caused problems in its relations with the United
 States. But Belgrade apparently believes it can
 continue to exercise considerable latitude in its
 existing relationship with Tripoli without significantly
 damaging its ties to Washington.
 Outlook
 Belgrade probably will continue its current level of
 dealings with Libya in political and military areas for
 the foreseeable future barring major changes in the
 international scene. Belgrade almost certainly would
 back Libya in the event of increased US military
 pressure and would probably pass to Tripoli
 information it acquired on Western knowledge of
 Libya's terrorist-related activities. Belgrade is
 unlikely to push Tripoli very hard over payment
 problems for fear of losing profitable construction
 contracts and may try to show even more flexibility
 concerning payment and trade arrangements, such as
 more actively seeking countertrade deals with third
 parties. In our view, only a dramatic turn in Libyan
 foreign policy inimical to Belgrade's interests-such
 as withdrawal from the Nonaligned Movement,
 public official backing for terrorist attacks in the
 West, or a complete halt in Libyan payments for
 Yugoslav exports-would sour the relationship, and
 even such a downturn could be selective or of short
 duration.
 Belgrade, nonetheless, is likely to be sensitive to
 Washington's concerns, and Yugoslav leaders will
 probably avoid specific transactions-such as selling
 Western military equipment or actively assisting
 Libyan-organized terrorist operations-that they
 believe would result in dramatic political or economic
 sanctions from Washington. But Belgrade would
 almost certainly reject demands from Washington to
 cut back on most of its other ties to Libya, including
 sensitive military-security arrangements.

 East Germany-China:
 Honecker's Visit
 East German leader Erich Honecker's unprecedented
 `official friendly" visit to China during 21-26
 October was hailed by both sides as "serving the
 cause of socialism" and ushering in a new era in
 bilateral relations. While the atmosphere was
 excellent, the German Democratic Republic (GDR)
 and the People's Republic of China (PRC) played
 down the matter of restoring party ties, and the
 tangible results appear limited to a long-term
 economic agreement. The Soviets had to be on board
 for the visit, but Honecker's avoidance of touchy
 political subjects and the absence of a communique
 suggest an attempt to lower the profile of the trip.
 East Germany's Ostpolitik
 Honecker's visit to China, the first ever at that
 protocolary level by a GDR party and state chief,' was
 the high point in the steady improvement of bilateral
 ties that began in 1983. During the last 12 months
 alone, Vice Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister
 Wu Xueqian visited the GDR, and Volkskammer
 President Sindermann, number-three ranking
 Politburo member, and Margot Honecker, Minister of
 Education and wife of the East German leader, visited
 China. The steady stream of other ministerial visitors
 in both directions has testified to the desire of both
 sides to revive a once flourishing relationship that had
 been largely moribund since the mid-1960s as a result
 of the Sino-Soviet split.
 Honecker's formal visit was meant to pave the way for
 a larger Soviet and East European reconciliation with
 China while at the same time pursuing East German
 interests. The GDR is eager for expanded ties to
 China's developing economy and increasingly wants
 to profile itself politically as a player in world affairs.
 Honecker was welcomed like an old friend by the
 senior Chinese leadership. He had three rounds of
 talks with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General

 Secretary Hu Yaobang and further meetings with
 paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, President Li
 Xiannian, and Premier Zhao Ziyang. Honecker and
 Hu kissed, embraced, and recalled old times together
 in the international youth movement over cups of
 Chinese tea (pronounced the best in the world by
 Honecker). Similarly, Deng reminisced about his
 contacts during the 1920s with Communists in
 Germany. Hu and Zhao accepted the ritual invitation
 to make a return visit to the GDR; Zhao most likely
 will visit next year, while Hu probably will not visit
 'The East German news service ADN reported that Deng had also
 accepted such an invitation. This is probably a miscue, however, as

 Unpleasantness Avoided
 Deng sidestepped the sticky issue of how to restore
 party ties by averring to Honecker that since these
 ties had never actually been severed, there was no
 point in discussing anything except moving them to a
 higher level. An East German diplomat in Beijing
 later remarked to a US Embassy officer that the
 GDR considered it significant that Deng chose to
 make this remark himself. The heads of the respective
 Central Committee international relations
 departments were directed to consult on arranging
 new delegation exchanges. Deng's tactic, which could
 be used with other East European states, served to
 play down the significance of the issue.
 When not reminiscing about the distant past,
 Honecker and his hosts spoke about future prospects
 for developing relations from the new foundation
 established by the visit. Left unreported-if not
 unsaid-was any mention of the deterioration in their
 relations in the past two decades because of the Sino-
 Soviet split or of the existing "three obstacles" to
 better ties between the USSR and PRC. The principal
 reference to the Soviet Union was in Honecker's
 fitful-and apparently unsuccessful-efforts to get
 the Chinese leaders to endorse the Soviet version of
 Reykjavik. There was no separate meeting between
 the foreign ministers.
 While avoiding references to China's reforms per se,
 Honecker praised Chinese economic accomplishments
 in general. Similarly, he implicitly acknowledged
 China's independent foreign policy. This is not
 surprising since it is the stock in trade of Honecker's
 foreign policy rhetoric that countries with different
 social systems should find ways to coexist. By this
 logic, what applies to relations with capitalists should
 certainly apply to fellow-if deviant-Marxists. In
 the end, Honecker told Chinese reporters that both
 sides reached unanimity on bilateral relations and
 "some" international issues. Honecker doubtless
 enjoyed hearing his Chinese interlocutors extol the
 GDR's Westpolitik, in particular Hu's praise for the
 East German leader's unremitting efforts to bring
 about international dialogue. The Chinese
 presumably regard the Honecker Westpolitik as a
 seemingly independent tendency to be encouraged,
 especially in view of the GDR-Soviet friction it caused
 Economic Deals
 Honecker's visit also focused on economic relations.
 The delegation contained two economic principals-
 party secretary for economics Mittag and Foreign
 Trade Minister Beil-and the major formal
 agreement was a 15-year economic, scientific, and
 technological accord. Both sides expressed optimism
 that the pact will help boost trade above the expected
 record of about $500 million this year, double the
 1985 level.
 China's modernization plans afford East Germany
 with an opportunity to boost its sales of industrial
 machinery and other manufactured goods to raise the
 PRC's share of trade above the paltry 0.4 percent
 registered in 1985. The East Germans offered mining
 technology in September and probably hope to sell
 strip mining equipment. During the visit, the two sides
 concluded another deal for 300 East German rail
 passenger cars worth $100 million. East Berlin also
 sees China as a source of raw materials and light
 manufactures including consumer goods.
 No Communique: Soviet Concerns?
 In contrast to an earlier working visit to Beijing by
 Polish leader Jaruzelski, there was no communique
 issued at the end of the Honecker visit. Also unlike
 Jaruzelski, Honecker did not stop in Moscow on his
 way home, a stopover that would have signaled quite
 clearly that the roads from China to Eastern Europe
 lead through Moscow. While there is no question that
 the Soviets approved of the long-discussed Honecker
 visit, some recent events may have stimulated Soviet
 unease about the pace of such developments:
 ? The haste with which Jaruzelski arranged his visit
 to China in order to arrive there ahead of Honecker
 may have given the impression of undisciplined
 action in East European efforts to cultivate ties to
 the PRC.
 ? Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev
 apparently did not make much progress on any of
 the points dividing the two sides during his 6-14
 October visit.

 Secret
 ? In the aftermath of the Reykjavik presummit, the
 Soviets may want to concentrate on organizing. their
 arms control policy and not be diverted by the
 necessity to oversee closely the relationships of their
 allies with China.
 For whatever reason, Honecker appeared to take his
 cue and considerably lowered the political profile of
 his visit by avoiding a communique and by taking
 along a relatively low-key delegation of political
 advisers that did not include either party international
 relations chieftain Hermann Axen or "crown prince"
 North Korea and Mongolia Also on the Itinerary
 Honecker sandwiched his China visit with stops in
 North Korea (18-21 October) and Mongolia (26-28
 October). Again in contrast to Jaruzelski (who had
 preceded him on this leg as well), Honecker and Kim
 Il Song issued no communique, most likely because
 the GDR is reluctant at this time to undermine the
 1988 Olympics by supporting North Korea's demand
 for cohosting with South Korea. Commentaries on
 both brief visits were positive, and the economic
 agreements signed in each place unremarkable.
 Outlook
 Neither the GDR nor the PRC is likely to have been
 surprised by go-slow signals from Moscow and will
 assume that even these are temporary. In any case,
 Honecker will have viewed his visit as a personal
 triumph. The new cooperation agreement should pave
 the way for at least modest growth in trade over the
 next few years, and Soviet concerns should not
 seriously affect routine commerce. The East German
 Consulate General established in Shanghai seven
 months ago, for example, will soon grow into one of
 the city's largest in the estimate of the US Consulate
