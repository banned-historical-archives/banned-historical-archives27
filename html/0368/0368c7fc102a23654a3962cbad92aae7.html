 China's 13th Party Congress: A Preview
 Scope Note
 The 13th Chinese Communist Party Congress, scheduled to begin in
 October 25, comes at a crucial juncture for China's reform program.
 Stalled by the fall from power of Hu Yaobang last January, reformers are
 still fighting to regain the initiative, while their conservative critics hope to
 capitalize on the congress to maintain a strong voice in policy matters
 The congress moreover, may be the last hurrah for several of China's
 most senior leaders, including Deng Xiaoping.  Not surprisingly, Deng has
 worked hard in the past few months to strengthen the hand of his closest
 allies--especially Zhao Ziyang--and to ensure that the conclave endorses
 the key elements of his reform program. His more conservative peers,
 also seeing this as their last chance, have sought to advance their own
 proteges to key positions and to redirect the reform program into
 narrower, more orthodox Marxist channels. This series of essays examines
 the key issues and the stakes, as we see them, for the principal players in
 the Chinese leadership and speculates on the outcome and potential
 consequences for the reformers and their program.
 These memorandums were prepared by the Office of East Asian Analysis  Information
 available as of 15 October 1987 was used in there preparations. Comments and queries
 are welcome and may be directed to the Chief, China Division, OEA

 China's 13th Party Congress: Speculating on a Conservative Outcome
 Summary
 Since late August, Chinese reform leaders, including Deng Xiaoping
 and Zhao Ziyang, have repeatedly claimed that the 13th Party Congress in
 October will provide a springboard for "deepening" and accelerating
 reform. Press leaks and US Embassy reporting suggest, however, that
 conservative party elders--who hope to direct reform into narrower, more
 orthodox channels--may not only hold their own but may even emerge
 from the Congress with a strengthened voice in economic policy for the
 near term. If the conservatives indeed do better than Deng and Zhao are
 implying, Deng stands to lose some influence. We would expect greater
 deference to conservatives interests and a slowing, but not a reversal, of
 reform. We also would expect Deng to counterattack as in the past. This
 time, however, he is handicapped by advanced age, the fallout from the Hu
 Yaobang incident, and problems with existing reforms.
 This memorandum was prepared by              (Office of East Asian Analysis, and is 25X1
 the last in a series of typescripts examining issues, personalities and factors bearing on
 this fall's Congress. Information available as of 1 October 1987 was used in its

 Beijing's Public Line
 Following the July-August preparatory meetings at Beidaihe, Chinese reform .
 leaders and official propaganda have been notably upbeat about prospects for reform at
 the 13th Party Congress, to :onvene on 25 October:
 ? In meetings with foreign dignitaries, both Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang have
 left visitors with the impression that the Congress will decisively support reform,
 leading to "intensified" economic measures, the start of effective political reforms,
 and the rejuvenation of the party leadership.
 Mid-level officials in Beijing who privately previewed the Congress document for
 US Embassy officers claim the session will endorse such controversial ideas as
 the thesis that China is in "the initial stage of socialism" and therefore can use a
 wide variety of Western capitalist techniques--including "private enterprise"--to
 expand production.  ,
 ? The official media have run a barrage of contentious commentary supporting
 reform, criticizing views that Zhao has labeled as "conservative and ossified," and,
 for the the first time, publicly commenting on the impending "retirement" of Deng
 The Congress surely will bear Deng's imprint. Almost singlehandedly, Deng
 publicly set the agenda and pushed it to completion, and party propagandists are certain
 to highlight his personal contribution to the Congress' achievements. Indeed, we expect
 Deng and his allies to achieve several important objectives--some symbolic, others
 more concrete:
 ? The departure of the most senior party elders from the Politburo and its Standing
 Committee and the promotion of younger leaders in tune with Deng's and Zhao's
 ideas.
 ? Endorsement of economic reforms since 1978, with additional language pointing
 toward future reform.
 ? Approval in principle of "political structural reform," including the disentanglement
 of party committees from routine government and enterprise administration and
 perhaps a specific allocation of responsibilities among the top party
 organizations.
 ? Adoption of the "initial stage of socialism" theory to lend ideological legitimacy
 to the reform program.                                                      25X1

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 We suspect, however, that the reformers' claims are exaggerated and that Deng
 and Zhao are under heavier pressure from conservatives than they are willing to admit
 publicly.  We continue to see signs of conservative strength; individually they are not
 compelling but taken together they raise the possibility the 13th Congress will not be
 the resounding success reformers claim:
 ? At the behest of conservative ideologues Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun, the party
 disciplined five prominent proreform intellectuals in early August.
 ? Some younger reformist leaders apparently are being demoted:  Wang Zhaoguo.
 an alternate member of the Secretariat and personally sponsored by Deng,
 recently was relegated to a provincial post and almost certainly has lost his seat
 on the Secretariat.
 ? The editor of the staunchly reformist Shanghai World Economic Herald--a
 publication reportedly protected by Zhao Ziyang during the anti - bourgeois
 liberalism episode--is slated to be replaced by the paper's party secretary, a
 political appointee who has meddled in editorial policy.
 ? The Congress document, after five drafts and review by thousands of officials at
 every level, may place heavier emphasis on economic planning--perhaps under
 the rubric of a "national industrial policy"--than expected, and will not be the
 "blueprint for reform" that reformers had touted.
 Besides these developments, diplomatic sources and leaks that have surfaced in
 the Hong Kong press lead us to suspect the old guard has won concessions on every
 important item on the Congress agenda--personnel, economic and political reform, and
 ideology. If these reports are correct, we could easily have a situation after the
 Congress that includes:
 ?  Continued prominence for senior conservative leaders:  virtually all accounts of
 the Beidaihe meetings agree that Chen Yun, Bo Yibo, and Peng Zhen will continue
 to hold highly visible and potentially powerful party posts following their
 so-called retirements in October.
 ? Strategically placed conservative appointees at every important level: a variety of
 diplomatic and media sources claim the Politburo Standing Committee--the key
 party body--will have a rough balance of reformers and conservatives; current
 odds favor a Standing Committee of reformers Zhao and Hu Qili, conservatives Li
 Peng and Yao Yilin, and Qiao Shi as the swing member.
 ? A more conservative State Council leadership: Li Peng is by all accounts set to
 succeed Zhao as premier--if not in October then at the next session of the
 National People's Congress in the spring--with Yao Yilin                           25X1
 slated to become the State Council's second-in-command.                     25X1

 ? Orthodox language in the ideology statement: the Congress' document almost
 certainly will include themes that are clearly identifiable as conservative in origin,
 at a minimum, this will dilute the document's impact as a reformist credo while
 providing an ideological pretext for orthodox criticism of reform.
 ? Perhaps a concession to conservative interests on one or more major policy
 concerns: for example, the public remarks of national leaders and current media
 commentary seem to prepare the way for a period of economic retrenchment and
 for more inclusive economic planning;
 Consequences of a Strong Conservative Showing
 A strong conservative showing in our view would put orthodox party elders in a
 good position to slow and, in some instances, to redirect reform. China already seems
 set for a course of "conservative reform" over the next year that shifts the focus away
 from sweeping systemic measures and increased reliance on markets that reformers
 were trumpeting a year ago, and toward microeconomic tinkering within the system and
 a "national industrial policy" that seems a way to accommodate advocates of large-scale
 economic planning. Yao Yilin's recent admonition--delivered at a joint conference on
 the 1988 economic plan and reform plan--to "be prepared to lead a hard life for several
 years" augurs another period of economic retrenchment and scaled-back reform
 The conservatives almost certainly would attempt to water down plans for
 political structural reform and to divert into random local "experiments," if not to cut off
 altogether, controversial economic measures sanctioned by the Congress. Moreover,
 conservatives would in our view fall into their pattern of seeking a tougher line on
 artistic, cultural, and intellectual policy to combat anew the spread of "bourgois
 If the conservatives do as well as the straws in the wind suggest, Deng stands to
 lose some influence. Certainly most Chinese, both leaders and public alike, would see
 him as having been cut down a notch and attribute it to the Hu Yaobang episode. In
 practical terms, we believe such a result would force Deng into a greater collegiality,
 meaning greater deference to conservative interests, and would restrict his ability to set
 the domestic agenda. For younger leaders who may have hoped to see authority shift
 to them, it would mean that the old men would remain in charge behind the scenes.
 Deng characteristically has rebounded smartly from past setbacks, and we view
 him as unlikely to accept a possible conservative advantage for long. Although Deng's
 authority has eroded somewhat since Hu's ouster, he remains China's central political
 leader. Deng nevertheless would face an accumulation of obstacles--his age, the
 continuing effect of the Hu ouster, problems with the reforms--that would complicate a
 reformist counteroffensive. At a minimum, we would expect him to:

 ?  Provide a strong propaganda buildup for Zhao as China's key day-to-day leader.
 ?  Work through Zhao and his allies to put the best media face on the Congress.
 ?  Try to circumscribe the authority of conservative elders and their
 proteges--perhaps focusing at the outset on restricting the reorganization of
 Zhao's State Council staff, which we expect would receive marching orders from
 Li Peng and Yao Yilin sharply different from those during Zhao's leadership.

 China's 13th Party Congress: A Primer
 Summary
 The National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party
 serves as a national forum for legitimizing the membership of the Central
 Committee and for setting the tone and direction of Beijing's policies.
 Deng Xiaoping has used past congresses, Central Committees. and other
 national party meetings to drive his reform program and, by recasting the
 party's leadership in a reformist mold, to consolidate his power.  Although
 the leadership makes its most important decisions in closed sessions
 before the national conclave, it is left to the congress formally to
 announce the results of the deliberations. The stakes this fall are high as
 reformers and conservatives maneuver to gain personnel appointments
 and influence the direction of China's modernization program.
 This memorandum was prepared by                       (Office of East Asian Analysis,     25X1

 wisdom of the party.  It is used to legitimize leadership changes and serves as an
 occasion to proclaim broad consensus on the party's "line, principles, and policies."
 The party constitution identifies the National Congress as the party's top-ranking
 body and mandates that it be convened by the Central Committee once every five years.
 Although congresses generally have been rubberstamp bodies that, until 1977, served for
 irregular lengths of time, the Chinese propaganda apparatus treats acts of the congress
 as the authoritative "will of the party." As such the congress symbolizes the collective
 The approximately 1.600 congress delegates are selected from China's provinces,
 autonomous regions and municipalities, the central organs--both party and state--and
 the People's Liberation Army.  Although provincial media recently have publicized the
 elections of the delegates. we suspect they are chosen from a oreapproved list of
 The Central Committee, 2 like the congress, is not a "working body" in any real
 sense. Party convention decrees that all party decisions be issued in the name of the
 Central Committee, and the party bureaucracy is termed the "organs under the Central
 Committee." When the committee convenes, usually once a year, it formally constitutes
 China's highest decisionmaking body in place of the National Congress. At all other
 times, however, the power of the Central Committee devolves upon the Politburo, and,
 when the Politburo is out of session, its Standing Committee. The Standing Committee
 makes the decisions that are the basis of Chinese policy. Unless the decisions of the
 Standing Committee are placed before the Politburo for additional deliberation, the
 whose presence gives the committee a representative look,
 The congress's most important task is the endorsement of a new party Central
 Committee--a body whose membership is actually determined in hard,
 behind-the-scenes bargaining 1 among senior leaders.  Most holders of top-level party,
 state, and military positions, including State Council ministerial posts, provincial party
 secretaries and governors, and the military high command, are Central Committee
 members ex officio. Other Central Committee seats may go to individuals marked for
 higher office or to selected members of professions, science, education, or the arts.
 The resort town of Beidaihe has become the annual summer retreat where top
 leaders prepare for upcoming party meetings. At Beidaihe Central Committee retirees
 and replacements are decided, new Politburo and Secretariat arrangements worked
 out, and major policy directions planned.  Sometimes leading nonparty figures are
 invited to attend working sessions to present details of plans and policies relating to
 The Central Committee has expanded with each party congress. The 12th Party
 Congress had 343 full and alternate members, the 11th had 333 members, the 10th
 had 319, the ninth only 278, and the eighth less than 100. The 13th Congress may
 again expand the Central Committee, but State and media reporting suggests that the
 size could be reduced as a 'political structural reform.'

 officials in the Politburo and in top party and state positions. In 1978, the Third Plenum
 of the 11th Party Congress reestablished the CDIC, which oversees the conduct of party25X1
 members. The constitution adopted at the 12th Party Congress specifies that both the
 CAC and the CDIC are under the leadership of the Central Committee, and that the
 heads of both must be Politburo Standing Committee members.  Since then, Deng has
 chaired the CAC, and leading economic conservative Chen Yun has headed the CDIC.
 The congress also endorses the political work report that reviews the state of the
 party during the term of the preceding congress and may set the general line for the
 next five years.  The party chief or his designee delivers the report, which is comparable
 to the annual plenum reports. The work report is endorsed by leaders during the
 Moreover, the congress may promulgate authoritative resolutions on matters of
 broad policy. No party congress since 1958 has produced a specific policy document,
 but plenary sessions of the Central Committee routinely do. Generally, party
 pronouncements are circulated in draft months before a national meeting and, like
 personnel appointments, are hotly debated within the top leadership. At the meeting
 itself, public discussion of the draft is pro forma, but there is nothing to prevent the
 leadership from incorporating additional changes based on comments from the floor.
 Policy statements can be embodied in the work report, rather than separately addressed
 Finally, the congress has the formal right to amend the party constitution. In
 fact, the party charter has been rewritten at every congress since 1956, suggesting its
 wording tends to reflect the political strength of its progenitors rather than any effort to
 establish durable institutions and procedures. Constitutional revisions offer insight into
 the direction and goals of China's current leadership. As such, for example, in the 12th
 Party Congress constitution Deng replaced Cultural Revolution-era wording that stressed
 continuing revolution and class struggle with language emphasizing economic
 The congress is not responsible for naming the party's highest leaders. This is
 the chief function of the first plenary meeting of the reconstituted Central Committee,

 prearranged choices for party General Secretary and membership of the Politburo, the
 Politburo Standing Committee, and the Secretariat. The Central Committee also puts its
 stamp on the membership of the Central Military Commission--the party body that
 oversees the Army--and which again must be chaired by a Politburo Standing

 Deng's Track Record
 National party meetings serve as deadlines that force the leadership to decide on
 controversial issues.  Deng characteristically has done well at such sessions, and has
 used them to advance his reform program.  He has, for example, used the 12th Party
 Congress and the 1985 Party Conference of Delegates3 to transform a party leadership
 originally stacked against him into one that predominantly supports reform:
 ? The composition of the Central Committee has gradually shifted from older,
 idelogically oriented central planners to younger, more pragmatic and technically
 competent officials.
 ? Deng has steadily decreased the proportion of military leaders on the Central
 Committee and the Politburo as part of his plan to distance the Army from the
 party and make the military clearly subordinate to civilians.

 party and government posts. Hunan's party secretary Mao Zhiyong is the only
 Deng also has used the national party meetings to reconstitute the party's
 structure, which was dismantled during the Cultural Revolution:
 ? At the 1980 Central Committee Plenum, Deng reestablished the Secretariat, his
 own power base before it was dismantled during the Cultural Revolution. Deng
 almost certainly intended to bypass the superannuated Politburo as a
 policymaking body by turning over substantial decisionmaking authority to the
 newly created Secretariat.

 Delegates to overhaul the membership of the Central Committee. The lack of
 restrictions on who may attend a specially convened conference--as opposed to a
 formal party congress, which must "elect" delegates--permitted the reformist
 Secretariat to select 300 "at large" delegates, thereby guaranteeing Deng majority
 support at the meeting. The only previous party delegates conference was held in

 policies and measures to decentralize power.

 Cultural Revolution, and criticized policies Mao pursued from 1958 onward.

 on Reform of the Economic Structure," which, although short on specifics,
 established a blueprint for future urban reforms such as the factory manager

 ? Although we believe reformers compromised with conservatives on the tone of
 last year's Sixth Plenum resolution on the "Guiding Principles for Building
 Socialist Spiritual Civilization," the document reaffirmed the reformist line and laid
 the groundwork for devising ideology compatible with China's reforms.
 The 13th Party Congress
 The agenda of this year's congress is more crowded than any since 1956. We
 believe the following issues will constitute the main battlegrounds as leaders maneuver
 to advance their positions:
 ? Composition of Party Leadership. The proportion of identifiable conservatives
 and reformers on the new Central Committee will give a rough indication of
 each's strength.  Both groups will be trying to get as many supporters on the
 Committee and on the Politburo, its Standing Committee, and the Secretariat as
 they can.
 ?     Other personnel changes. We expect Zhao Ziyang to be conf rmed as Party
 General Secretary, but he may retain the premiership until the until the National
 People's Congress (NPC) next spring.  We believe the decision on the next
 premier will already have been made going into the Party Congress. and the
 proceedings of the congress and the following plenum may offer hints of the
 next premier."
 ?       Revision of the Constitution.  The congress will have to make substantial
 changes if Deng resigns from the Politburo but keeps either the chairmanship of
 the CMC or the CAC, as he has indicated he would to several foreign visitors.
 The constitution may also have to be adapted to accommodate organizational
 We expect the next premier to be appointed to the Politburo Standing Committee, and
 he may assume substantial state duties. For example, in 1980 Zhao Ziyang was
 appointed "executive Vice Premier" in charge of the daily supervision of State Council
 work following the Fifth Plenum of the 11th Congress while then-Premier Hua
 Guofeng maintained his title until a September NPC plenum.

 ? Political Structural Reform. A drafting group has been working on a document
 since last spring that reportedly lays out guidelines for poi :ical structural reform,

 among Chinese leaders of the neccesity of economic reform but there is
 disagreement on China's next step.  We believe the congress document will
 summarize the accomplishments of reform over the past eight years and will lay
 the groundwork for further reform.
 ? Ideology. Reformers want a document that establishes an ideological basis for
 reform and protects their program from conservative criticism.  Conservatives will
 probably attempt to insert Marxist rhetoric that might later justify restricting

 China's 13th Party Congress: Players and Stakes
 Summary
 The 13th Party Congress, scheduled for October. is the last party
 congress that leaders of the revolutionary generation can be confident of
 attending. Deng Xiaoping had hinted that this congress would transfer
 power to a new generation. Accordingly Deng, Acting General Secretary
 Zhao Ziyang, and their allies will be pressing to advance their personnel
 preferences and put their stamp on the congress document, but against
 the strong resistance of conservative rivals such as Pang Zhen and Bo
 Yibo. We believe reformers have an edge now, but the party's
 conservative wing will continue to pose a challenge. The month of
 top-level meetings to prepare for the congress probably has seen tense
 infighting.
 This memorandum was prepared byl              Office of East Asian Analysis, and is     25X1
 the second in a series of typescripts examining issues, personalities, and factors bearing
 on this fall's Congress. Information available as of 6 August 1987 was used in its
 preparation.  Comments and queries are welcome and may be directed to the Chief,
 Political Assessments Branch, China Division, OEA                                       25X1

 Four issues are at stake: the succession, political reform, economic
 reform, and ideology.  Preparations for a succession after Deng eventually
 departs will overshadow all other debates and involve selecting appointees
 for top posts and choosing a new Central Committee.  The congress will
 address key policy concerns in a formal document or documents.  A
 decision on political reform centers around reducing the role of the party
 in administrative and economic affairs. A statement on economic policy
 will summarize eight years of reform and take up the questions of
 economic decentralization and the role of the market in China's economy.
 Reformers will also seek an ideological statement to support their
 approach against conservative charges that many reform policies are not
 "socialist." The decisions, in our opinion, will probably reflect a mixture of
 views, enabling both sides to use parts of it to support their positions.
 The Players
 As the leadership meets in Beidaihe for the decisive precongress sessions, the
 important actors in the decisionmaking fall generally into two camps that we and the
 Chinese label, for convenience, reformers and conservatives.  The political spectrum in
 China today is much narrower than in the past, and all the leaders in power have shared
 the goal of undoing Cultural Revolution policies after Mao's death. As reform gathered
 momentum, some leaders grew alarmed at the speed and breadth of reforms being
 implemented or contemplated; this group we call the conservatives. However, there are
 few clean lines drawn, and a number of top figures really constitute swing votes--for
 example, those who support greater autonomy for lower level economic decisionmakers
 uppermost levels of leadership, but have the age factor against them. Most are in their
 seventies and eighties. Conservatives have been unable, until recently, to win
 appointments for their sympathizers, and therefore face an uphill battle at the congress.
 To a great extent, they are attempting to displace an established group.  Nonetheless,
 they have made important gains since Hu Yaobang fell,' placing supporters in importan25X1

 Their conservative opponents are probably numerically dominant at the

 reform sympathizers as well. The post-Mao improvements in China's economic,
 Well-connected Hong Kong political journals and party documents released

 propaganda and personnel posts--for example. Wang Renzhi. new director of the
 Propaganda Department, and Song Ping, the new head of the Organization Department.
 Conservatives go into the precongress battle without a clear commander in chief,
 which also weakens their position. Deng has shown a great ability, in the past, to
 splinter his opposition's leadership, and he probably will have some success at it this
 With all the weaknesses of the revolutionary generation, however, the combined
 clout of its members, most of whom are conservative, should not be underestimated.
 Moreover, in our judgment, their views have a large, if inchoate, constituency of those
 who are frightened or threatened by reform.  Conservatives can also claim to represent
 the voice of prudence and caution, a powerful appeal in China, a society with a turbulent
 recent history and a profound fear of instability.
 All party congresses are important because they remake the leadership and lay
 down the policy line intended to shape the ensuing five years.  However, the 13th Party
 Congress, scheduled for October, is unique in one respect. It is the last party congress
 that many of the revolutionary elders, including Deng Xiaoping, can be sure they will
 attend. Therefore, Deng, his allies, and those opposed to his plans will all be working to
 effect their personnel and policy choices--knowing that this may be their last
 opportunity. As they have in previous years, the leadership has retired to the resort
 town of Beidaihe. where they meet to make the crucial decisions that the congress will
 ratify and announce.  Four interrelated issues are at stake--the succession, political
 reform, economic reform, and ideology.
 The succession--not only to Deng Xiaoping but to several important posts--is
 the issue that, though not formally on the agenda, will underlie all the debate at the
 congress. The 13th is the congress where Deng had hinted he would transfer power to
 a new generation of leaders. Although the ouster of Hu Yaobang in January threw all
 previous arrangements into disarray. we believe that Deng still intends to use this
 congress to set up a group of successors--people not only sympathetic to his aims, but
 with the judgment and prudence to help realize them.  By the same token, conservative
 leaders, like Deng, are eyeing the time when the revolutionary generation will be gone.
 We expect that they, too, will push their own proteges, trying to put enough of them in
 position to affect economic and political policy.

 been very skillful at orchestrating party meetings.
 Deng's experience with Hu Yaobang will, in our view, make him careful to choose
 candidates who will not antagonize the powerful old guard, and whom party elders find
 acceptable.  He will probably have to compromise and deal--we believe his position was
 weakened by the Hu incident--but Deng has a long history of finding the right
 combination of enticement and pressure to advance his goals.  He has also generally
 One of two particularly troublesome succession choices is a new head for the
 party's Military Affairs Commission (MAC), a job Deng now holds. There is, in our
 estimation, a dearth of civilian party leaders who have good relations with the military
 and sufficient prestige to be acceptable to powerful soldier-politicians. Conversely,
 none of the younger generation of military leaders appears to us to have the party
 credentials for a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee, which the job now carries
 with it. The MAC chairman will have to persuade the Army to accept reforms--many of
 which entail a loss of status and revenue for the military--and to keep the Army on
 board with the broad outlines of the reform program. Although we believe Deng has
 diminished the Army's political role, it is still politically prudent to have at least the
 grudging acquiescence of military leaders. One factor in Hu's fall was his inability to
 will gain an edge in the post-Deng maneuvering.
 A number of succession decisions need to be made at the congress. The most
 important post needing to be filled is General Secretary of the Chinese Communist
 Party, formally the highest ranked post.  (In China, power and position do not necessarily
 coincide: Deng, the unquestioned top leader, has never formally held the party's top
 slot)   Zhao Zivang currently is Acting General Secretary; Chinese comments to foreign
 visitors and to the US Embassy indicate he will be confirmed as party chief.  If so, Zhao
 Zhao now holds the post of premier as well as being Acting General Secretary,
 but we expect him to resign the government post.  Even though Zhao has won high
 praise as premier and his experience in many ways better suits him for that job, Deng
 seems intent on separating party and government functions. A wide variety of sources
 indicates, however, that choosing Zhao's successor has not been easy and the decision

 The selection of a new premier is the other particularly contentious personnel
 decision. Because the premiership is a government post, the party congress may not
 make the announcement of a new premier, but the job entails ex officio membership on
 the Politburo Standing Committee, and we believe the leadership will settle on a choice
 probably will not be able to dominate even at the Central Committee level.
 Party bodies will be overhauled at the congress, and both sides want their
 choices on the Politburo, its Standing Committee, and the Central Committee. It is at
 the Central Committee level that conservatives probably hope to make gains--with so
 many slots to be filled, it is harder for Deng to control all the choices. At a minimum,
 one result of Hu's fall is that conservatives will lose less ground at the congress than
 they would have.  In our view, they may even be able to make some modest gains, but

 almost certainly is still being debated. The premier is responsible for overseeing
 economic policy, and as China moves further into difficult and politically volatile areas of
 reform, the job will be difficult.  Stories in well-connected Hong Kong journals, as well
 as hints given a US official. indicate that Deng will opt for an older man as a
 compromise transitional figure, rather than trying to follow his earlier plan of choosing
 someone in his fifties.  Opting for an older man would not only, in our view, be more
 acceptable to conservatives; Deng himself may have more confidence in the skills and
 judgment of one of his generation.
 The congress will endorse a decision on the controversial question of political
 structural reform.  We believe it will be a statement of general principles, not a detailed
 outline. Deng has argued in numerous speeches, including one made in August 1980
 and republished in an enlarged version this year, that political structural reform is a
 necessary corollary of economic modernization.  Calls for political reform were taken by
 some reformist intellectuals to mean genuine and sweeping changes in the direction of
 democracy, which alarmed many in the leadership and contributed to last year's
 crackdown on student demonstrations.  Deng's meaning is much narrower.  His goal is
 greater efficiency, not greater freedom. In Deng's view, political reform entails, as laid
 out in his speech, separating party and government functions; delegating power to lower
 levels; streamlining organizations; reforming personnel selection to eliminate favoritism
 and stress qualifications; and expanding "socialist democracy." However, Deng and his
 reform theorists have been unable to come up with precise details on what exactly
 these goals mean and how to accomplish them.
 The policy disagreements between reformers and conservatives on this issue are
 largely matters of degree, leaving aside those radical reformers, mainly intellectuals, who
 pushed such ideas as a multiparty system. Most leaders favor some devolution of
 power, streamlining, and better personnel selection. But conservative leaders would be
 much more reluctant, we believe, to significantly reduce the party's role in either
 government activity or economic management. They have also shown much less
 willingness to make the sacrifices and take the risks some of these measures carry. In
 particular, they have opposed efforts to streamline organizations because this policy
 threatens to weaken their patronage networks.
 The congress will also issue a statement summarizing reform's accomplishments
 to date and laying down guidelines for future steps. Conservatives and reformers
 disagree on a number of economic questions, but the basic disagreement is over the
 roles of the party and the central planning mechanism in the economy. We expect
 conservatives will attempt to use recent problems--a growing budget deficit, a leveling
 off in grain production, and a shortage of foreign exchange--to hit reform policies and

 argue for their modification.  The reform group in our view, will press strongly for party
 endcrsement of past measures and of a statement justifying reform exper'ments in
 ideological terms. They probably will try to head off their conservative critics, however,
 by maintaining that reforms will be carried out 'niithin the general framework of a
 socialist planned economy.  The success of reform in boosting standards of living gives
 Ideology
 The final issue on the table at the congress is an ideological justification of the
 free-market-style reforms. Deng has indicated that this document will have a reformist
 cast; according to credible Hong Kong press, he ordered that the propaganda, which had
 had a conservative tone in the wake of Hu's ouster, begin pushing reformist themes so
 the document would not come as a surprising departure.  We expect conservatives to
 follow tactics they have used in the past, asking that the document emphasize socialist
 themes even as it announces reformist policies. Last year's Sixth Plenum document, for
 example, reaffirmed several reform policies but had a conservative tone in its theoretical
 sections. Inclusion of such conservative concerns as the importance of resisting
 "bourgeois liberalism" gives the conservative camp a lever it can use to attack reform.

 Reformers historically have had difficulty putting an ideological base under their
 pragmatic policies, because it is hard to find support in Marxist-Leninist theories for
 many of their measures. Although this may matter little to the average Chinese. it is
 important to revolutionary elders and to some party functionaries.  In recent weeks,
 reformist writers have previewed the document's main argument that pragmatic reforms,

 China's 13th Party Congress: The Succession Issue
 Summary
 Deng Xiaoping has had no more success than Mao or Communist
 leaders elsewhere in arranging a succession. We doubt that Deng has
 forged a consensus behind a new succession package since Hu Yaobang's
 downfall in January. Indeed, although Deng still has formidable political
 resources at his disposal, which he undoubtedly will use on Zhao Ziyang's
 behalf. we believe he is not in a position to overcome--either at the
 coming party congress or any time soon--the influence of conservative
 leaders powerful enough to upset his plans once he is gone. Instead, he
 almost certainly will have to accomodate them. As a result, we believe
 the leadership lineup that emerges from the congress will at best
 represent an uneasy compromise that leaves the succession to Deng

 Deng's Goals
 missteps and Deng's own misgivings led to Hu's downfall in January.
 Deng Xiaoping is China's acknowledged "helmsman" less by virtue of his formal
 position than his seniority, prestige, broad network of supporters, and political skills.  It
 was that authority Deng had hoped to bequeath to Hu Yaobang after guiding Hu's long
 ascent to political prominence.  These plans came unravelled when Hu's political
 Failing to establish a durable succession team with Hu at its head. Deng still
 wants to protect his policies and allies after he is dead. Zhao Ziyang, now Acting
 General Secretary, seems to have replaced Hu in Deng's calculations as the leader best
 positioned to keep the reforms alive. We expect Deng will use his formidable influence,
 which remains critical to Zhao, to bolster Zhao's position and authority:
 ? Deng has won for Zhao the post of Acting General Secretary, and will ensure
 Zhao's endorsement as General Secretary at the party congress.
 ? Deng will broker the selection of the top party leadership to provide politically
 compatible company for Zhao within the Politburo, Secretariat, and Central
 Committee.
 ? He almost certainly will grant Zhao substantial say in staffing the party and state
 bureaucracies, thereby assuring Zhao of a broadened political base.
 ? Deng generally has allowed the General Secretary wide latitude in formulating
 party policy and controlling, together with government leaders, the reform
 agenda.
 ? Perhaps most important, Deng will stake his own prestige on the suitability of his
 chosen political heir--those who challenge Zhao know that they challenge Deng
 always particular policies.
 Unlike Mao Zedong, however, Deng is not an autocrat capable of imposing his
 will on the rest of the leadership. Deng is constrained by implicit political rules
 governing the leadership collective.  With China's ruling elite thick with aged grandees
 of independent influence, Deng is compelled to broker patchwork compromises that
 preserve the semblance of leadership unity. Consequently, he cannot promote only his
 protege's political interests while single-mindedly opposing Zhao's rivals at every turn.
 In Deng's consensus-style politics, he has been loath to completely alienate leaders who
 speak for a definable segment of the party, and he consistently takes the views of the
 party's conservatives into account. Deng's apparent equivocation on such issues as
 "spiritual pollution" in 1983 and "bourgeois liberalism" earlier this year demonstrate his
 efforts to strike a rough political balance--and mollify men such as Peng Zhen and Deng
 Liqun sufficiently to ensure their support for at least the broad goals of reform, if not

 For all his ability to manipulate events, Deng probably can do little now to secure
 the future f,r a chosen political heir.  Having more freedom to take positive steps -)
 support Zhao than to remove potential opponents, Deng almost certainly will be unable
 to neutralize leaders powerful enough to upset any plans he may lay.  We doubt that
 patent ploys such as Deng's own "retirement"--together with the departure from senior
 posts of other old guard leaders--will reduce the seniority and deference commanded
 Even presuming Deng had a different succession lineup in mind, we believe he
 recognizes such a package would stand little chance of overcoming conservative
 opposition at this congress.  At most, therefore, we expect him to pursue the traditional
 tactic of packing the party leadership, from the Central Committee to the Politburo
 Standing Committee, with his supporters, thereby seeking to weight the overall political
 balance in favor of reform, with an eye to shaping the future.
 Although Zhao's position will be stronger after the congress, we do not expect a
 clearly defined line of succession to emerge from the conclave  Rather, we
 believe--along with many well-connected Chinese--that the party congress will be
 inconclusive on the succession issue. Middle-level officials close to Zhao's circle of
 advisors have told the US Embassy that they are already looking toward the 14th party
 congress, and even the 15th in 1997, for a decisive victory of reformist leaders and
 The succession issue has dominated the agenda of every major party
 assemblage since 1956. From the late 1950s until his death, Mao repeatedly
 sought to establish a stable line of political heirs, only to reconsider and undo
 his work in every case but the last. When Mao died in 1976, he left Hua
 Guofeng as his chosen successor. The powerful party old guard--resurgent
 after the Cultural Revolution and led by Deng--deposed Hua in late 1980.
 In supplanting Hua, Deng disavowed personal designs on the top spot
 and instead planned to establish his own team, with Hu Yaobang slated for the
 top party slot and Zhao Ziyang as premier and faithful second-in-command. By
 1985, however, Deng seemed to be second-guessing his choice of the
 controversial Hu. That summer he sought leadership endorsement for a deal to
 move both Hu and Zhao off center stage and to hand over the top posts to
 leaders in their fifties who were not themselves transitional. We believe this
 plan foundered on Deng's inability (or, in hindsight, unwillingness) to secure the
 chairmanship of the party Military Commission for Hu, and Deng ultimately
 wound up scrapping his own arrangements. In deciding to sack Hu and elevate

 policies and political legacy were safer in Zhao's more temperate care.

 China's 13th Party Congress: The Ideology Issue
 Summary
 The 13th Party Congress will attempt. in the words of a prominent
 Chinese intellectual, to "unify understanding" on ideology, marking the
 latest step in a nine-year effort to establish the theoretical underpinnings
 of economic reform. Since Deng Xiaoping's emergence as China's
 paramount leader, the party leadership has fought over ideological
 questions perhaps longer and harder than on any other topic.
 Conservatives who remain committed to indisputable party control and
 traditional Chinese Communist values such as frugality and self-sacrifice
 have resisted Deng's push to win general acceptance of a "socialism with
 Chinese characteristics" that sanctions freewheeling market-style
 measures. We expect the document that issues from the Congress to
 provide the coherent rationale for reform that Deng wants, but

 conservatives will try to water it down and will continue to snipe at
 policies they regard as going beyond the bounds of Marxist-Leninist
 tradition and practice.
 Wanted: An Ideological Reformation
 Rulers of China traditionally use official doctrine to legitimize their authority and
 policies. Mao dictated an idiosyncratic brand of Marxism as a way for Chinese to
 understand the world and as a guide to practical action.  Until his death. all policy had
 to pass the test of ideological consistency, with Mao as judge.  Later. Deng worked for
 the dethro
 nement of Mao's ideas but offered little to fill the resulting ideological
 F_           I
 The efforts of Deng and the reformers are not wholly cynical. They hope to
 demonstrate the doctrinal validity of "socialism with Chinese characteristics" both to
 their conservative critics and to foreign socialists who are closely watching China's
 economic experiments. Reformers recognize that despite any successes. their policies
 will always be vulnerable to a challenge on ideological grounds unless they can be
 rationalized in Marxist terms. They therefore want a congress endorsement--formally
 the highest statement of party approval--of a document that is both authoritative as
 doctrir -3 and, if not persuasive to conservative critics, useful as a political club to
 silence carping on points of theory. Either way, the path for policy implementation is
 potentially smoother if Deng can deprive his critics of their most successful tactic over
 the years, -raising the policy dispute of the moment to the realm of basic principle,
 questions, but the party leadership was too divided to bring the session off.
 plenum promised a special national meeting in 1984 that would resolve ideological
 Since 1978, Deng and his allies--not free to act with Mao's impunity--have tried
 to provide a persuasive Marxist basis for their reform policies but have been
 unsuccessful. The revaluation of Mao's theories beginning in 1978 and culminating with
 the June 1981 party resolution on historical questions, the publication of Deng's selected
 works in 1983, the passages on ideology in the 1984 party decision on economic reform,
 and the 1986 resolution on building a "socialist spiritual civilization" all marked attempts
 by reformers to put ideological questions behind them.  The 1983 Central Committee
 means to preserve social order and undergird party primacy.
 Conservative Perspectives
 In our view, conservative leaders are committed to orthodox doctrine for various
 reasons. We believe theorists such as Deng Liqun and Hu Qiaomu are "true believers"
 who stand or fall within the party on their moral credibility. They regard terms like
 "profit," "market price," and "private enterprise"--freely bandied about by reform
 theorists--as evil hallmarks of a capitalist system condemned by all socialist founders
 from Marx to Mao. Other leaders such as Peng Zhen and Bo Yibo probably are more
 opportunistic, regarding ideology as a powerful issue to manipulate, or simply as a

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 Conservative ideologues are unconvinced on three important counts: that
 market-style reforms in theory are consistent vith Marxism-Leninism that theoretical
 constraints will prevent market-style economic reforms from overrunning the socialist
 system: and that the party's political grip can be maintained despite a relaxation of
 central controls.  Consequently, we believe conservatives will seek to include in the
 document limits on reforms they believe threaten party rule and such traditional values
 of Chinese Communism as frugality, self-reliance, hard struggle, and sacrifice for
 collective goals.  They probably also will press for greater emphasis on political
 indoctrination to stem the shift in attitude among Chinese youth and intellectuals toward
 more liberal Western ideas.  Conservatives may want to call attention specifically to the
 campaigns against "spiritual pollution" in 1983 and "bourgeois liberalism" earlier this
 year as instrumental in countering the social and intellectual influence of the vVest
 Back to the "Initial Stage"
 Although we expect the congress statement on ideology to contain passages
 dictated by orthodox leaders--reflecting the usual give-and-take of high-level
 deliberation over key party documents--Chinese officials who have previewed the
 document say it will strongly endorse reform. Drafted under Zhao Ziyang's supervision,
 it will declare that China is in the "initial stage of socialism," during which controversial
 experiments using "capitalist" methods are acceptable. It will argue that the framers of
 classical Marxism-Leninism never anticipated China's particular conditions--specifically,
 a Communist revolution without a capitalist stage of development. Because China never
 developed a solid and diverse economic base, the argument goes, the state must foster
 diversity by permitting a variety of economic forms, including private ownership of
 enterprises, to coexist to provide outlets for native entrepreneurial ability. The result
 will be a flourishing "socialist commodity economy."
 Although the document will sanction elements of capitalist activity, it will claim
 that the reforms are by definition "socialist" because they operate within a socialist
 system. It will argue that socialism and party rule will be guaranteed by the
 conspicuous enshrinement of "the four cardinal principles"--a favorite conservative
 catchphrase that includes upholding the socialist system, the leadership of the party,
 and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought--as unchallengeable dogma.
 Preaching to the Choir
 Although plausible and deserving high marks for ingenuity, the theory behind
 Oeng's reforms will not, in our view, go down well with conservatives. The congress
 document may provide a useful text for reformers to argue from but will change few
 minds and leave the controversy open. As in the past, conservatives almost certainly
 will succeed in inserting pet themes--such as the need to oppose bourgeois
 liberalization--that they can cite later to challenge reform policies. In fact, according to
 the Chinese press, the party began in late August to circulate the fourth draft of the
 congress document for comments and criticism  This in our view provides an eleventh

 hour opportunity for conservative critics to register complaints and propose alternate
 language. We believe the resulting compromise. although not entirely what Deng and
 his allies want, will be even less popular with orthodox leaders and on balance will be a
 strong endorsement by the party congress of the reform program.

 China's 13th Party Congress: Political Structural Reform
 Summary
 Deng Xiaoping has placed political structural reform near the top of
 the agenda for the 13th Party Congress, almost guaranteeing that the
 principles he has long advocated of separating state and party functions
 and devolving some decisionmaking powers will be endorsed in some
 form. Neither Deng nor other reform leaders. however, have spelled out in
 any detail how they hope to achieve these goals.  Indeed, we believe they
 are ;till groping for ways to overhaul China's huge. entwined party and
 government bureaucracies.  With an eye to conservative concerns, the
 reformers are stressing that their intent is to strengthen Communist Party
 rule, not to introduce the kind of Western democratic institutions
 advocated by some radical reformers a year ago. Even so, we believe
 many conservative leaders worry that any loosening of party control over

 In his speech "The Reform of Party and State Leadership Systems" given
 before an enlarged Politburo meeting in August 1980. Deng stated that China s
 leadership system is outdated and in need of reform. Deng criticized the
 current system as being too bureaucratic, of concentrating power at the top, of
 facilitating the abuse of positions, and of blurring the roles of the party and
 state. As a result, Deng asserted that the current system impeded China's
 efforts to move toward a socialist commodity economy, and warned that this

 concentrate on "ideological and political work." Factory party officials have
 resisted implementing the factory manager responsibility system because it

 announced at the party congress this fall.  Starting in July with the republication of
 Deng's original speech, and especially in recent weeks, the reformers in tact have
 mounted a media campaign to build momentum for the endorsement of these reforms
 at the congress. With an eye to conservative concerns, the reformers have restricted
 public discussion largely to administrative reforms, insisting that their intent is to
 strengthen party rule--not promote Western-style democracy--and that they favor
 gradual, step-by-step implementation.
 Reformer's Prescription
 The renewed stress Deng has placed on political reforms indicates. in our view,
 that he still regards these steps as essential to overcome opposition to economic
 reforms from entrenched interests in the party and state bureaucracies. His prescription
 is fourfold
 ? The Separation of Party and Government Functions
 Reformers want to restrict the party to formulating basic policies and principles
 and reduce its interference in the day-to-day administration of government and
 state enterprises. According to recent Hong Kong press, for example, reformers
 plan to propose abolishing the party leading groups, appointed by the party
 committees. in government offices at the ministerial level.  Reformers have also
 sought to strengthen enterprise managers at the expense of local party
 secretaries, who often interfere in enterprise management despite their lack of
 managerial and technical expertise.
 ? The Devolution of Power and the Readjustment of the Administrative
 Structure
 Reformers want to reorganize and streamline the bureaucracy to ensure that it
 facilitates rather than obstructs the implementation of the economic reform
 program.  They particularly want to reduce the size and power of ministries
 associated with centralized planning.  At the same time, they want to expand
 regulatory and judicial departments as well as management companies suited to
 the promotion of a market-oriented economy.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 Ministry of Supervision Finds a Niche
 Reformers probably see the new Ministry of Supervision as an important
 example of the separation of government and party functions.  The new bureau
 functions similiar to the party's Central Discipline Inspection Commission,
 disciplining state officials just as the CDIC hears charges against and disciplines
 party members--including state officials who are also party members. The
 Ministry of Supervision may curb the CDIC's power over these state officials.
 We believe the new ministry also may play a large role in the campaign to
 punish government officials charged with "bureaucratism"--a catchall phrase for
 negligence, mismanagement, or corruption. The ongoing campaign. launched
 after the sacking of the Minister of Forestry for his mismanagemer - of the
 widespread forest fires in Heilongjiang Province last spring, may be another
 attempt to shake up the personnel system.
 Reforming the Cadre and Personnel System
 Reformers want to regularize the methods of recruiting, supervising, training, and
 removing cadres to establish a professional system that will attract the younger,
 educated, and competent personnel that are essential for China's modernization.
 To reduce concern among the rank and file--and to avoid exacerbating China's
 underemployment problem--we believe reformers have downplayed the removal
 of cadres. Instead, they stress the need to transfer and retrain cadres and the
 need for the cadres to be flexible in accepting other assignments, including
 demotions.
 ? Strengthening Socialist Democracy
 The least well-defined goal, it ostensibly means greater participation in the policy
 process and encompasses such proposals as increasing  he role for the National
 People's Congress and the local congresses, making election procedures more
 "democratic," and perfecting the legal system. We assume reformers hope these
 steps will foster greater popular support for the reform program.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 Building a strong legal system to replace China's traditional reliance on
 the "rule of man" has been a goal of reformers since the historic third plenum
 of the 11th National Party Congress in 1978. Premier and acting party chief
 Zhao Ziyang recently told a visiting US official that the strengthening of China's
 legal system is an important aspect of China's political reform.
 The push to develop China's legal system is closely linked to the
 economic reform program and the open door policy. As the Chinese have
 entered into more joint ventures with foreign firms and sought to acquire more
 foreign technology,' their need for lawyers familiar with both contract law and
 international patent and trademark laws has grown.
 To encourage more Chinese students to major in law, official propaganda
 stresses the prestige of the legal profession. Legal training is also becoming
 increasingly common at all levels of schooling.
 Despite this new commitment to "law," "the party remains a law unto
 itself and continues to dominate the legal system. At the top, the party's
 Political and Legal Commission oversees the lawmaking of both the National
 People's Congress and the State Council. Vice Premier Qiao Shi, moreover,
 heads the party commission and is responsible for supervising the Ministry of
 Justice, thus blurring the distinction between party and government authority.
 Worse, the party's discipline inspection departments frequently step in to settle
 criminal cases involving party cadres instead of allowing the courts to try these
 Groping for Answers
 Neither Deng nor other reform leaders have spelled out in any detail how they
 hope to achieve their objectives. We believe the reformers are still feeling their way,
 experimenting with different methods to see what will work--just as they have with
 other parts of the reform program.
 Over the past year, for example, reformers have experimented in 16
 medium-sized cities with reforms designed to reduce overlapping bureaucratic
 involvement in enterprise operations. Some of these cities have either eliminated the
 administrative companies that directly manage state enterprises or changed them into
 " enterprise-type companies," requiring them to become service organizations run for
 profit. Others have consolidated government bureaus Nith overlapping functions or
 authority, hoping to cut down on the redtape and layers of bureaucracy enterprises must

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 disbanded companies.
 These administrative reforms have met with mixed success.  In Maanshan in
 Anhui Province, one of the 16 test cities, local officials found that, by eliminating
 administrative companies, they also eliminated the source of raw materials and the
 marketing network for finished products. As a result, to fill the void they had to create
 temporary offices that, in some cases. are headed and staffed by personnel from the
 longer had a forestry bureau.
 In addition to the 16 cities. other regions have encountered problems.  For
 example, editorials have stressed that local authorities should have the power to
 restructure government offices because of local conditions, instead of following the
 example of provincial- or national-level administrative units.  Yet when Wuhan City in
 Hubei Province merged the Bureaus of Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry into
 one bureau. the Forestry Ministry refused to allocate funds to Wuhan because it no
 Prospects at the Congress
 than a page long.
 The heavy propaganda drive the reformers have mounted almost guarantees that
 the basic principles Deng has long advocated will be enshrined in some fashion in the
 congress document.  Reformers apparently are not ready to submit a detailed blueprint
 for such reforms, however.  In fact, one think tank intellectual recently told Embassy
 officers that the statement on political structural reform would be only general and less
 reform probably intend to work out more detailed plans over the next year.
 We believe, given the reformers' preoccupation with personnel and ideological
 questions, they will be content simply to win such a general endorsement.  Zhao Ziyang
 and other members of a special party committee set up a year ago to study political
 Communist Party itself.
 In our judgment, however. the reformers face an uphill battle in trying to
 implement these measures. Party and state bureaucrats in both central ministries and
 their local organizations will continue to impede reform policies that threaten their
 interests.  Similarly we expect senior conservative leaders to pay lipservice at most to
 political reform while opposing or obstructing the implementation of specific measures
 they regard as threats either to their personal power or to the authority of the

 Indeed, these proposed reforms raise very basic questions about the future role
 and relevance of the party that we believe pose a dilemma for reformers as well.  Deng
 for example, is no more prepared than his more conservative colleagues to allow the
 party to become subordinated to other institutions or an independent legal code.  Yet if
 his proposed reforms are carried out to their logical conclusion, party officials will:
 ?  Be subject to the law like everyone else.
 ? Lose the power to intervene in government and economic decisions.
 ?  See their influence over key appointments at the local and provincial level
 significantly reduced.
 Moreover, conservatives fear that by placing a premium on economic results
 rather that on Marxist doctrine, political reforms will undermine the ideological basis of
 the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy.  We suspect reform leaders regard such still
 largely theoretical issues as far less urgent than the more immediate and pressing
 problem of overcoming continued resistance to reform.

 China's 13th Party Congress: Economic Issues
 Summary
 China's economic performance for the first half of 1987 has
 intensified debate about reform in advance of the forthcoming 13th Party
 Congress. Conservative critics have sounded the alarm at inflation,
 excessive increases in wages and investment, and growing budget deficits,
 while reform leaders have touted eight years of rapid economic growth
 and improved living standards. We believe the two sides have reached an
 uneasy standoff, with agreement on steps designed to improve enterprise
 efficiency. But the rift in the Chinese leadership over the extent and pace
 of market-oriented reforms threatens to turn the key policy issuance of
 the Congress into a vague and guarded endorsement of the role of market
 forces--and the disagreement seems certain to persist after the Congress

 Economics in the Spotlight
 According to accounts in the Hong Kong media, China's economic performance in
 the first half of 1987 was debated with special intensity in meetings leading up to the
 13th Party Congress, scheduled to convene on 25 October.  The Chinese press has
 highlighted sharply divergent signals on economic policy, which we believe reflect deep
 divisions among China's senior leaders over the extent and pace of market-oriented
 reforms.  In late August, for example, Beijing announced a temporary freeze on
 previously decontrolled prices and tighter restrictions on how state enterprises can use
 their retained earnings.  But, at the same time, party journals and reform leaders have
 touted the gains from reforms and affirmed that the implementation of new measures
 will be accelerated after the Congress.
 To be sure, China's uneven economic performance in the first half of 1987 has
 given ammunition to both the reform and conservative camps. Spurred by a 20-percent
 surge in investment spending, for example, industrial output has increased at a
 15-percent annual rate.  But the Chinese press has noted that product quality is poor
 and inventories of unsalable goods are growing. Competition for raw materials for
 industry, and growing demand for consumer goods, have outstripped, supplies. pushing
 prices up by an 8-percent annual rate in June--high by China's standards
 Economic performance in the countryside has, to some degree, bolstered
 reformers' arguments, because the output of nonstaples and rural industries have
 increased rapidly this year.  But production of grain--a politically critical staple--has
 stagnated, and will fall far short of its 3.5-percent growth target, according to a senior
 Chinese economist.  News on the foreign trade front is equally mixed, for Beijing has
 continued last year's effort to trim the foreign trade deficit, slashing it by almost 70
 percent in the first half of 1987.  But although central government holdings of foreign
 exchange increased modestly to more than S3 billion by midyear 1987, they remain well
 below the $12 billion level Beijing recorded several years ago.
 To complicate matters, increased investment and wage payments are contributing
 to the declining profitability of state enterprises, and therefore to budget worries
 Chinese statistics show enterprise losses rising at about a 25-percent annual rate and
 more than one-fifth of state-owned industrial enterprises have recorded deficits this
 year. China's central bank has tried to rein in enterprise spending by raising interest
 rates, but the move has not deterred borrowing because enterprise managers are
 convinced the state will bail them out if they cannot repay the loans.
 The Conservative Critique
 Conservatives have cited China's inflation, excessive investment, budget deficits,
 and foreign exchange shortfalls to criticize reformers for economic mismanagement.
 They argue that market-oriented reforms, which have reduced the scope of
 administrative controls and mandatory planning, are the cause of the economic
 dislocations. They are probably particularly alarmed by State Statistical Bureau figures
 showing that China's inflation rate has increased each month since April.  Conservatives

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 may argue that social stability is jeopardized because the living standards of as many as
 one-fifth of urban workers have fallen this year because their wage gains have not kept
 Conservatives are correct in believing that by relaxing central controls Beijing has
 increased inflationary pressures.  Since the early 1980s, Beijing has broadened enterprise
 autonomy--particularly by allowing state factories to retain a larger share of their
 revenues and permitting them to sell overquota production of industrial goods at
 "negotiated," above plan, prices. However, it has not implemented effective measures to
 make enterprise managers accountable if funds are used inefficiently.                      25X1
 Asiaweek, a Hong Kong-based news magazine, reported in mid-July            25X1
 that the conservatives' strategy approaching the party congress would be to take
 advantage of any economic problems or public disturbances to press for endorsement
 of sharolv limited reforms in the Congress policy document and for acceptance of their
 own oersonnel choices. Judging from past responses to economic problems, we believe
 conservatives .-:ant the Congress to strengthen central control of economic decision
 making and increase attention to mandatory plans.  Conservatives would also like to
 lessen enterprise discretion over investment; lower monetary growth; tighten control
 over prices. land use and trade; and emphasize hard work.  They support efforts to
 increase enterprise efficiency, hence the Congress policy document may endorse wider
 implementation of enterprise performance contracts with supervisory bureaus.              25X1
 policy flexibility is the appropriate response, not greater central control.
 While conservatives argue that the economy's problems derive from the fast pace
 of reform, reformers believe that dislocations result--in part--from piecemeal
 implementation of reforms.  For example, reformers argue that Beijing should substitute
 the threat of bankruptcy for the certainty of state subsidies. to motivate enterprise
 managers to control investment spending and wage increases. To reformers, more
 variety, and other successes since the introduction of reforms eight years ago.
 Proponents of market-oriented reforms have overridden the practical and
 ideological objections of conservatives by arguing that monetary and fiscal policies can
 guide the economy when central controls are relaxed, and by insisting that reforms be
 judged by their ability to produce results, rather than by their conformity to dogma.
 Consequently, reform leaders have been vulnerable to conservative criticism when the
 economy performed poorly. It is thus no coincidence that in recent weeks reformers
 have orchestrated an intense media barrage to deflect attention from the conservatives'
 critiques, recounting improvements in the standard of living, economic growth, product

 The Clampdown on Prices
 According to Hong Kong journals and diplomatic reports. since the early 1980s
 China's top leaders have feared the sort of public uprising that occurred in
 Poland when food price hikes contributed to the growth of the Solidarity trade
 union movement.  With the release of the economic performance statistics for
 the first half of the year and the ensuing debates about policy, senior leaders
 decided to implement an across-the-board freeze on prices and to tighten
 restrictions on investment spending.  Chinese press reports indicated that the
 price freeze was in response to widespread consumer complaints about rising
 prices, particularly of food:
 ? In late August. Beijing ordered prices of consumer goods, including
 foodstuffs, frozen for the remainder of the year. To accomplish this, it
 authorized local governments to set price ceilings on farm produce sold at
 village markets and on overquota production of industrial goods--thus
 retreating on recent policies that allowed sales at negotiated prices.
 ? Beijing announced that only capital construction projects already approved b
 the central government may be started in the second half of this year. And
 if locally funded investment spending exceeds the targets set earlier this
 year, the excess will be deducted from next year's target and responsible
 officials will be disciplined.
 ? Enterprise managers were ordered to keep wage increases from exceeding
 the growth of industrial productivity.
 To ensure compliance, Beijing announced that its annual nationwide inspection
 of prices and finances will begin early this year.
 Reformers worry that, having exhausted the easy immediate gains from reform
 policies in the late 1970s and early 1980s, mounting economic problems could erode
 popular support for reform and slow its momentum.  As a result, reform leaders are
 constantly on the alert for opportunities to press for further gains and avoid economic
 stagnation. We believe they would like to implement a series of related market-oriented
 policies which are especially contentious within the leadership:
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 ?  Reformers would like a bankruptcy mechanism to establish market accountability
 for state enterprises.
 ?  Reformers argue that the state should lease or sell small state enterprises,
 particularly those sustaining losses, to individuals.  This not only would ease the
 government's subsidy burden but would make the factories more responsive to
 market forces.  Moreover, they view the expansion of private enterprises as a
 means of absorbing surplus labor.
 ?  Reform leaders call for further commercialization of agriculture.  Recent articles
 in the Chinese press argue that, to boost grain production, Beijing should hike
 procurement prices and continue to reduce the amount of grain peasants must
 sell under contract to state supply units.
 Looking Ahead to the Congress
 system--while stressing that priority should be given to restoring economic stability
 appear supportive of reform--for example, by espousing reform of the planning
 Because the mixed performance of the economy this year has awarded no clear
 vindication to either the conservative or the reformist camp, we doubt that either side
 will score a clear-cut victory on this issue at the Congress.  If anything, we believe
 conservatives have reached a modus vivendi with reformers that amounts to the lowest
 common denominator of acceptable policies, focusing reform on improving enterprise
 efficiency and deferring the hard choices--such as price reform--until after the
 Congress. Recent public statements by conservative leaders seem carefully crafted to
 far-reaching future reforms.
 Thus despite this year's economic problems, the Congress's policy document will
 probably approve the general direction of economic reforms and affirm that market
 forces can play a key role in driving China's modernization program.  A senior Chinese
 official told US Embassy Beijing that the document will lay the ideological basis for
 demand pressures generated by relaxed central controls.
 We believe, however, that, because of the sharp split among senior officials over
 economic policy, the document will not provide a detailed account of how Beijing plans
 to proceed with reforms.  The Congress probably will couch its endorsement of reform
 in rhetoric that reaffirms China's long-term commitment to socialism, thereby watering
 down its endorsement of market mechanisms. Approval of the Congress document
 therefore will not reduce contention over economic policy. In fact, by treat the
 symptoms--excessive investment spending and price hikes--rather than attacking the
 disease--lack of market accountability--reformers probably have prolonged the period
 until Beijing will have adequate monetary and fiscal tools to moderate the strong

 China's 13th Party Congress: Trade and Investment Issues
 Summary
 Improved trade performance in the first eight months of the year
 probably has muffled debates over the management of China's external
 economic relations in the weeks leading up to the 13th Party Congress.
 Although foreign investment commitments have declined this year--in part
 because potential investors have postponed decisions until after the
 Congress--we believe this issue has not weighed heavily in the
 pre-Congress debates because neither side is willing to advocate a
 particular strategy for dealing with the issue. Nor do we expect state-
 ments relating to the management of foreign trade, investment, and
 external debt to be a significant part of the document that emerges from
 the Congress, because the more thorny issues of leadership succession,
 political structural reform, ideology, and domestic economic reform will
 take precedence. Final decisions on new trade reforms, currency adjust-
 ments, and investment regulations probably will be left for 1988.

 Foreign Trade: A History of Contention
 China's "open door policy" on economic relations with other countries has
 generally been immune from criticism. but how China has managed its foreign economic
 relations has prompted considerable debate in recent years. Reformers and
 conservatives have argued over such issues as the degree of central versus local
 control over contract signing, and whether production is best managed through
 administrative controls--licenses and quotas--or economic levers. including tariffs and
 domestic prices.  Conservatives have criticized the decentralized trade structure in the
 wake of China's large trade deficit over the last three years and the resultant decline in
 foreign exchange holdings and growth in foreign indebtedness. They have also attacked
 other economic reforms that have overheated the economy, boosted demand for
 imported goods, and weakened control over trade and foreign borrowing. Conservative
 criticism intensified when China's foreign exchange holdings dipped below the politically
 In addition, officials from China's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
 Trade (MOFERT) told Hong Kong reporters last February that reform of the country's
 foreign trade system had been put on hold for 1987. Measures discussed in 1986
 included increasing the autonomy of foreign trade corporations while making them
 accountable for their foreign exchange profits and losses. In place of these reform;,
 leaders began to talk about implementing a form of "contract management responsibility
 system" in the trade corporations. Under the contract system, each foreign trade
 corporation would sign an agreement with MOFERT, specifying the foreign exchange the
 corporation would be expected to earn, and the portion to be turned over to MOFERT.
 for Exchange Control's authority to manage external debt.
 Last February, Beijing responded by tightening central controls over foreign
 exchange expenditures and dramatically slowing the signing of most new import
 contracts. Beijing also began drawing up plans to stiffen central control over foreign
 borrowing and in August published regulations strengthening the State Administration
 sensitive $10 billion level in October 1986 and again in January 1987.
 Since the retrenchment, China's trade sector has shown an impressive recovery:
 ? The import ban has taken effect. Although shipments of items contracted for
 before February have continued, imports have declined 5.3 percent during the
 first eight months of the year compared with the same period in 1986, according
 to official Chinese Customs statistics.
 ? Exports, meanwhile, increased 23.4 percent, showing the most significant gains in
 the textile sector, where shipments increased 30 percent.
 ? Accordingly, China's January-through-August trade deficit, at $2.4 billion, is less
 than a third of the $8.2 billion level reached in the same period of 1986. Chinese

 data suggest that the country may even have had small surpluses in merchandise
 trade in June, July, and August.
 ?  These improvements were largely responsiole for a $2 ? billion surge in China's
 foreign reserve holdings from January through June. the last month for which
 data are available, to $12.6 billion.  China's state-held reserves also increased
 modestly, from $2.1 billion to $3.4 billion during the six-month period.
 ? China's rate of foreign borrowing may also have slowed during the year. Beijing
 announced in July that total borrowing from January through June was slightly
 The fact that conservatives and reformers alike have found support for their
 policies in the strong 1987 trade performance figures is one reason for the apparent lack
 of divisiveness over foreign trade issues. Proponents of strong central control credit a
 recentralization of authority over imports in the last two years for the drop in the deficit,
 while proponents of greater decentralization cite the increase in enterprise autonomy,
 greater use of worker incentives, and more flexible pricing policies as the underlying
 We believe another factor muting the debate is Beijing's desire to reassure
 foreign governments that are members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
 (GATT) that political developments in 1987 have not led to backtracking on foreign trade
 reform. Chinese leaders recognize that the willingness of GATT members to accept
 China as a contracting party--of tremendous symbolic as well as practical significance
 to Beijing--depends. in large part, on their perceptions of how rapidly China will
 implement reforms to bring trade practices more closely in line with those of market

 Foreign Investment: The Problem Nobody Wants
 New investment pledges declined 12 percent in the first six months of
 1987, compared with the first half of 1986.  Chinese press reports have
 explained the drop as the natural result of Beijing's efforts to curb investments
 in "nonproductive" projects in the service sector, such as hotels and restaurants.
 The Chinese media have also highlighted the favorable results of several recent
 surveys by US consulting firms that assessed China's investment climate by
 contacting a sample of US joint venture partners in China.
 Although the drop has doubtless been a disappointment--especially
 since new regulations were implemented in October 1986 after a decline in new
 foreign investment earlier in the year--the lackluster response of foreign firms
 has not promoted much debate. One reason is that such debate would benefit
 neither conservatives nor reformers.  Conservatives doubtless consider foreign
 investment a better way to finance China's economic modernization than foreign
 debt, but would nonetheless be unlikely to argue that more should be done to
 attract foreign investment; resolution of many of-the stumblingblocks that
 remain would require giving foreigners greater access to China's domestic
 market, allowing them to convert profits in domestic currency to foreign
 exchange for remittance, and increasing the autonomy of individual
 enterprises--steps they do not endorse. Reformers are also loath to play up
 the disappointing numbers because they recognize that some of the changes
 most eagerly sought by foreign investors--such as more flexibility in converting
 renminbi profits into foreign currency--would inevitably exacerbate problems
 China is having managing its foreign exchange reserves.
 The Party Congress: No New Initiatives Likely
 changes might be implemented.
 Because concerns over the leadership succession, ideology, political structural
 reform, and domestic economic reform have been far more contentious than the
 management of China's external economic relations in recent months, we expect
 statements relating to China's management of foreign trade and investment to be a
 minor part of the document emerging from the Congress. It will probably reaffirm the
 strategy of absorbing foreign capital and technology to foster China's economic
 modernization and call for continued growth in trade and foreign investment. The
 document may also refer to the importance of striving for balance between imports and
 exports, maintaining self-sufficiency in production, and diversifying trade partners and
 commodities. It will probably also allude to continuing reforms of China's foreign trade
 system but omit specifics about what such reforms might entail and how rapidly

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/22 : CIA-RDP04T00907R000300580001-7
 Dissension over particulars is another reason the document will be general
 Although China's recent trade performance has muted differences among China s senior
 leadership over trade management, underlying problems will probably continue to be
 discussed by officials more directly involved in trade and finance in the months
 following the Congress.  For example concern over China's trade deficit has been
 supplanted recently by assessments of the expense of improving China's balance of
 trade. Many of the export gains have been made possible only by increasing state
 subsidies to exporters to cover the gap between the domestic costs of production and
 competitive international prices.  Export subsidies have, in turn, further strained China's
 domestic budget, and will probably contribute to the projected increase in the budget
 deficit, as well as to increased foreign borrowing to finance it.
 Chinese trade and finance officials have apparently not reached agreement on
 how best to wean the trade sector from the subsidies. Officials from the Ministry of
 Finance and the People's Bank of China advocate currency devaluation. according to
 diplomatic reporting. Their views are countered by other economists who contend that
 a devaluation would merely shift subsidies from exports to imports, since at least half of
 China's imports consist of chemicals and mechanical products that are essential for the
 economic modernization program.
 More generally, discussions continue on how to coordinate foreign trade system
 reforms with the implementation of domestic enterprise, tax, and price reforms. MOFERT
 officials object to the contract management responsibility system for foreign trade
 because it forces trade corporations to face the irrationalities of the existing domestic
 price structure. An assistant minister of MOFERT argued in a recent journal that price,
 tax, and enterprise reform are essential to foreign trade reform.  In addition, he claimed
 that the contract system would have limited success even as an interim measure unless
 subsidies were replaced by a system of tax incentives structured to encourage exports
 of manufactured goods rather than the heavily subsidized primary products.  Discussions
 about the pace and scope of foreign trade reforms, changes in the way foreign
 exchange is allocated, the timing of a currency devaluation, and the implementation of
 related price, tax, and enterprise reforms will doubtless continue well into 1988.
