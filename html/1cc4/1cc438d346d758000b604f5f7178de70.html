 The Soviet reply to Britain's note seems to reflect
 a desire to arrive at a political settlement, and the ma-
 jor questions to be settled now are the timing and loca-
 tion of an international conference and the establishment
 of a cease-fire.  The Laotian Army, following the loss of
 Tha Thom, has launched an offensive aimed at retaking Muong
 Kassy, the initial phases of which apparently were
 successful.       However, reports of recent Soviet airdrop
 activities suggest that threats to the government positions
 may be developing in       ang Vieng area south of Muong
 Kassy.

 Opposition to the UN in Katanga reached a new peak
 following an incident on 3 April at Elisabethville air-
 port between UN troops and a Katanga contingent.   Both
 sides later announced that "normal relations" had been re-
 established, but further outbreaks could occur.                                                  Efforts
 to bring about a reconciliation between Gizenga and the
 Leopoldville regime are continuing, apparently with some
 initial success.  The impasse between the UN and Congolese
 at the port of Matadi continues.

 The USSR's initial response to the new Western pro-
 posals at the nuclear test ban talks suggests that
 it is undecided on its,future course.            Soviet delegate
 Tsarapxin limited his remarks to acceptance of those
 Western concessions that agreed with previous Soviet
 positions.  The US delegation believes that the USSR's
 most likely tactic will be to protract the negotiations,
 possibly pending developments in US-Soviet relations.
 Foreign Minister Gromyko told Ambassador McCloy on 30
 March that the Soviet proposal for a tripartite ad-
 ministration of the control system was a "sticking
 point" and admitted that the USSR desired a veto.
 The head of the Polish UN delegation has told an
 American official that the talks at Geneva would be
 deadlocked until after negotiations on general dis-
 armament had started and shown   some signs of progress.

 Increased activity has been apparent in the past week
 among anti-Castro groups both inside Cuba and in exile.
 New outbreaks of guerrilla activity have occurred in
 Oriente Province and near the border between Las Villas
 and Matanzas provinces.  A number of international
 gatherings sponsored by Communist-front organizations
 are planned in Cuba for the coming months, providing

 further opportunities for spreading Castro influence
 elsewhere in the hemisphere.  The Cuban complaint of
 US "aggression" is shortly to be discussed in the UN
 General Assembly's main political committee.
 FRANCE-ALGERIA .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 11
 Although both sides have indicated that talks will
 not begin at Evian on 7 April as scheduled, the door ap-
 parently has not been closed completely on a negotiated
 settlement.   The rebels canceled plans for the talks
 ostensibly because they objected to a recent public
 statement by the French that they would consult with
 other Algerian groups.  The PAG is probably attempting
 to force further concessions from the French,  although
 there are indications that the rebels' willingness to
 negotiate may in fact have diminished.   The French are
 not expected to compromise on their basic position that
 the PAG is not the sole spokesman for Algeria.
 EAST GERMAN REGIME FAILS TO HALT REFUGEE FLOW.  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  12
 Ulbricht's efforts to placate the populace, con-
 ciliate the professional class, and bring the regime's
 economic goals more into line with its resources have
 not reduced the East German refugee flow to West Berlin.
 More than 5,200 refugees reportedly arrived in West
 Berlin over the Easter week end, and more than 30,000
 fled during the first quarter of 1961, up from about
 20,000 a year ago.  These flights not only drain East
 Germany's already short supply of manpower, but also
 impair the regime's prestige.   However, Khrushchev's
 desire to avoid any Berlin incidents at this time pre-
 vents Ulbricht from attempting to solve the problem
 through the imposition of measures to bar East German
 access to West Berlin.
 BULGARIAN REGIME UNCOVERS PARTY OPPOSITION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  13
 Sofia has announced the "discovery" of an opposition
 group within the party.  This group opposes slavish ad-
 herence   to Soviet practices and advocates policies in
 accord with Bulgaria's national interest.   The regime
 last winter had tried to suppress news of the opposition
 groups, but rumors of its existence apparently forced the
 official admission this month.  An effort has been made
 to implicate the Yugoslavs in the matter, probably in
 part to distract attention from the internal causes for
 opposition.  The situation is under control, but serious
 dissatisfaction is reported in the middle and lower
 ranks of the party.

 most champion in Europe.                          He has been attempting to
 convince African leaders that they could profit by
 Yugoslav policy and experience in solving their own
 problems and has privately warned that neither the
 Soviets nor the Chinese Communists can be trusted.
 Now in Morocco, Tito plans to      his tour with
 trips to Tunisia and the UAR.                                                 25X1

 The pro-Western government of the independent Repub-
 lic of Cameroun, already beset by a Communist-influenced
 terrorist campaign, fears that its survival is threatened
 by the results of the recent plebiscite in the neighbor-
 ing British Cameroons trust territory.  The southern
 part of the territory, a stronghold of elements hostile
 to Cameroun's moderate Moslem President Ahmadou Ahidjo,
 voted to join Cameroun, while the northern portion,
 where Ahidjo would expect to find support from conserva-
 tive co-religionists, chose to join Nigeria.  Ahidjo,
 with little apparent prospect of success, is pressing
 in the UN--which supervised the votin   for an annul-
 ment of part or all of the results.                                           25X1

 Senegal's pro-French President Leopold Senghor,
 whose position has been weakening for some time because
 of internal dissension and personal rivalries, faces
 mounting opposition, especially on the part of younger
 and more radical elements.  There is increasing friction
 between him and Premier Mamadou Dia.  The premier's
 apparent determination to press for an early decision
 on a number of pending issues could precipitate a
 political upheaval resulting in the President's en-
 forced retirement.

 Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi was partially suc-
 cessful during his visit to Djakarta last week in estab-
 lishing a new basis for amity in Sino-Indonesian rela-
 tions.   Resentful of Peiping's past belligerence,  however,
 the  Indonesians slighted Chen on his arrival, restricted
 his movements to the Djakarta area, and cut his visit
 by two days.   Nevertheless,  Chen signed a friendship
 treaty and cultural agreement with his hosts and re-
 opened the question of Chinese economic aid.                            He also
 joined with Foreign Minister Subandrio in a call for
 a new Afro-Asian conference,  a move which both have
 long favored but which has been coolly received in
 some other capitals in the area.                                            25X1

 Britain's growing difficulties in international
 markets last year resulted in its largest balance-of-
 payments deficit on current account in the four
 deficit  years since 1951, according to figures re-
 leased in advance of the government's annual budget
 message on 17 April.   Speculation against the pound
 last month resulted in a loss of $173,600,000 in
 Britain's gold and dollar reserves.   Pressures are grow-
 ing for the government to depart from its current emphasis
 on anti-inflationary fiscal policies in favor of measures
 designed to stimulate economic growth.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The civil-military directorate that came to power on
 25 January is trying to overcome the resistance of El
 Salvador's powerful landowning  class to a series of
 moderate economic and social reform laws promulgated in
 March.  These reforms are not being implemented fast
 enough to suit many young officers,  and their pressure
 is likely to bring about a reorganization of the cabinet
 in the near future.

 THE TWO-CHINAS ISSUE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page
 The Chinese Communists are laying increasing stress
 on their opposition to settling the Taiwan problem on the
 basis of a two-Chinas concept.   This issue not only plays
 a decisive part in Communist China's attitude toward the
 UN but is also a critical element in other areas of
 foreign policy.   Peiping insists, for example, that Japan
 must reject the two-Chinas formula before there can be
 any considerable expansion of Sino-Japanese trade.  The
 Chinese Nationalist leadership is equally opposed to
 any de jure separation of Taiwan from the mainland, but
 has on a few occasions demonstrated some tactical
 flexibility on the issue.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 WEEKLY REVIEW
 The Soviet reply on 1 April
 to the British proposals on Laos,
 while accepting the UK sugges-
 tion for a joint appeal by the
 Geneva co-chairmen for a cease-
 fire in Laos, did not advance
 the USSR's position in any es-
 sential respect beyond that
 stated in its aide-memoire of
 18 February to the UK proposing
 the immediate convening of the
 ICC and an international con-
 ference.   However, the Soviet
 note did propose the "inter-
 ested parties" of Laos should
 hold negotiations on questions
 connected with a cease-fire.
 This suggestion provides fur-
 ther evidence that the bloc
 will seek to avoid any commit-
 ments on a formal cessation of
 hostilities prior to a confer-
 ence.
 The Soviet note implicitly
 rejected the Western position
 that a conference cannot be
 held until the effectiveness
 of a cease-fire is verified by
 both the Geneva co-chairmen and
 the International Control Com-
 mission (ICC). Moscow said that
 the ICC should call a meeting

 convocation of a conference.
 This formula suggests that the
 bloc would seek to restrict the
 ICC to  a fruitless  debate,
 at least during  the period
 before an international confer-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 newsmen in Djakarta on 2 April,
 was quoted by Western press
 services as saying that Peiping
 is prepared to respond to any
 intervention by SEATO forces by
 introducing Chinese troops, if
 requested by the "legal govern-
 ment of Souvanna Phouma."   The
 timing of this threat, following
 on the heels of the Soviet note
 to the UK,  suggests that Pei-
 ping's immediate  intention
 is   to  create   a sense of ur-
 gency and generate further pres-
 sure on  non-Communist govern-
 ments to accept bloc terms on
 Laos.
 On 5 April, after waiting
 three days, Peiping broadcast
 its own version of Chen Yi's
 press conference and quoted
 him as saying that if SEATO in-
 tervened and if a request were
 received from the Souvanna gov-
 ernment, China would "not remain
 idle."   In both the Peiping and
 Western press versions of the
 Djakarta interview, Chen re-
 called the Chinese entry into
 the Korean war when the US,
 "menacing China's security, car-
 ried the fighting to the Yalu
 River."   While this Peiping
 broadcast has made Chen Yi's
 warning more ambiguous, it un-
 derscores Communist China's de-
 termination to present its in-
 terests as vitally linked to
 Laotian developments.
 Moscow,  in broadcasting
 Chen Yi's remarks, quoted him
 as saying Peiping "will not
 remain indifferent" to SEATO
 intervention  but  omitted
 reference   to   the Korean war
 or to Nationalist irregulars in
 Laos.
 Chen Yi used his Djakarta
 press conference to allege that
 a threat is posed by the Na-
 tionalist troops, and Peiping
 has increased its propaganda
 attention to this issue over
 the past week.   On 31 March,
 Peiping claimed for the first
 time that the irregulars have
 conducted raids into Chinese
 territory from Laos.
 Communist China, North
 Vietnam,  and the Pathet Lao
 have all indicated their en-
 dorsement of the  Soviet pro-
 posals on Laos.
 Pathet leader Souphannou-
 vong, in a 1 April statement,
 and 3ouvanna Phouma's Xieng
 Khouang "representative" Quinim
 Pholsena,  in a statement of 2
 April, both demanded the with-
 drawal of "US, Thai, South Viet-
 namese,  and Chinese Nationalist
 military personnel." The emphasis
 on this withdrawal suggests it
 is a point which may be  used to
 prolong any cease-fire negotia-
 tions that may be held.
 Laotian Government  spokes-
 men, meanwhile, have indicated
 satisfaction over progress in
 East-West discussions on Laos,
 as well as a readiness to nego-
 tiate with Souvanna Phouma and
 the Pathet Lao toward the pos-
 sible formation of a govern-
 ment of national unity.   The
 danger of a panic appeal for
 assistance from SEATO has been
 reduced by Vientiane's reassur-
 ance that the great powers are

 moving toward achieving a cease-
 fire.                        Laotian spokesmen have
 expressed readiness to accede
 to a cease-fire, although Vien-
 tiane had previously declared
 that the Soviet airlift must
 end and North Vietnamese troops
 must be withdrawn before it
 takes effect.
 The Boun Oum government,
 however, is still concerned
 over the possibility that pro-
 Communist forces will take ad-
 vantage of any transitional
 period before a final settle-
 ment to seize control through-
 out the country.
 Souvanna Phouma in turn,
 during his recent talks with
 British officials, professed
 concern over a possible improve-
 ment in Phoumi's position in
 any interim before the conven-
 ing of an international con-
 ference. Although Souvanna, in
 outlining his  views on the
 composition of a transitional
 government in Laos, seemed to
 appreciate the desirability of
 restricting "leftist" ministers
 to minor posts,  the British
 found him overconfident on the
 prospect of holding early elec-
 tions.  British officials told
 the American Embassy in London
 that despite the risks, they
 regard him as the only Laotian
 offering promise toward a polit-
 ical settlement and a neutral
 Laos.
 Souvanna now is in Paris
 and will visit Belgrade, Warsaw,
 Moscow, and Peiping before re-
 turning to Phnom Penh.
 The Military Situation
 Laotian government troops
 on 5 April launched a combined
 air-ground offensive aimed at
 the recapture of Muong Kassy,
 about 20 miles south of the Phou
 Khoun road junction on Route
 13.  The action involves a si-
 multaneous drive toward the
 town by paratroop  and infantry
 elements airlifted to a point
 just north of Muong Kassy and
 by government forces positioned
 south of the town.   The initial
 phase of this operation appar-
 ently took the enemy by sur-
 prise, and continued success
 would provide a much-needed        25X1
 boost to government morale.
 A developing threat to the
 government forces south of Muong 25X1
 Kassy may be indicated by re-
 ports of Soviet air drops possi-
 The fall on 31 March of
 Tha Thom, the government's main
 base south of the Plaine des
 Jarres, was a serious psycho-
 logical blow to the government
 troops.   They fled in disorder
 under intensive artillery fire
 from heights overlooking the
 town and have withdrawn south-
 ward to Pak Sane.   Meo guer-
 rillas, who have been effective-
 ly harassing the Pathet Lao
 north of Tha Thom, now are in
 a more isolated position and
 have come under increased enemy
 pressure.
 Army officers in Luang
 Prabang have also been concerned
 over unconfirmed reports of Kong
 Le - Pathet Lao flanking move-
 ments around government troops
 blocking the southern approach
 to the city on Route 13 and of
 troops moving toward the city
 from the Nam Bac area to the
 north.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 UN efforts to reach an
 agreement with the Congolese on
 the question of UN troops in
 the lower Congo region remain
 stalemated.   In Katanga, Moise
 Tshombe's military effort
 against Baluba tribesmen
 threatens to involve the UN in
 a clash there.
 UN-Congolese relations in
 Leopoldville have improved dur-
 ing Rajeshwar Dayal's absence
 in New York, but the Congolese
 still oppose the re-entry of
 UN troops into the Matadi area.
 Hammarskjold remains adamant
 that his troops must return to
 the port eventually; however,
 he is attempting a moderate ap-
 proach to the issue.
 On 3 April he told Ameri-
 can and British officials in
 New York that  he would propose
 to the Congolese that a force
 limited for the time being to
 100 Nigerian police be sent to
 Matadi.   He planned to ask for
 an early answer and stated that
 if no favorable reply were re-
 ceived, he would bring the matter
 before the Security Council.
 President Kasavubu follow-
 ing his recent visit to the
 lower Congo has reiterated his
 opposition, asserting that the
 return of UN troops to the port
 would inflame the civilian pop-
 ulation as well as possibly pro-
 voke disorders on the part of
 Congolese armed forces.
 In a 3 April speech to the
 Indian Parliament, Nehru took
 note of the "campaign against
 Mr.  Rajeshwar Dayal" and made
 public his opposition to the
 replacement of Dayal t'either
 now or in the immediate future."
 He implied that India's willing-
 ness to maintain troops in the
 Congo would be partly conditioned
 by the UN's position on Dayal.
 Meanwhile, in a move de-
 signed to placate opposition
 to Belgium in the UN, Brussels
 has announced that it is ready
 to comply with the Security
 Council resolution of 21 Feb-
 ruary calling for the withdrawal
 of Belgian personnel from the
 Congo.   It continues to insist,
 however, that it has no direct
 control over most of the Bel-
 gian military and civilian "ad-
 visers" in the Congo.
 Exploratory discussions on
 a rapprochement between Leopold-
 ville and the Gizenga regime in
 Stanleyville were begun when
 Leopoldville Provincial Presi-

 ing of Kasa'ubu's government--

 visited Gizenga on 3-4 April.
 Kamitatu told an American of-
 ficial on his return that he
 believed Gizenga would accept
 a subordinate ministerial posi-
 tion under virtually any promi-
 nent personality, provided the
 government was approved by par-
 liament.   Further discussions
 between Leopoldville officials
 and Gizenga reportedly are to
 take place this week.
 Discussions in late March
 between the military represent-
 atives of Leopoldville's Gen-
 eral Mobutu and Stanleyville
 commander Lundula reportedly
 were cordial and may lead to a
 meeting of the principals at
 Lisala about 10 April.   The
 military leaders, who believe
 that the UN may intend to dis-
 arm all Congolese armed units,
 fear that the Congo Confeder-
 ation plan proposed at the
 Tananarive conference would
 fragment the military forces
 along with the political dis-
 memberment of the Congo.
 The Gizenga  regime  is
 still  complaining  about the
 failute  of  bloc and African
 states  to  furnish   sup-
 plies.
 Katanga is now the scene
 of greatest tension. Tshombe's
 forces, led by about 60 South
 Africans, have captured Manono,
 their first goal in reasserting
 Tshombe's authority over dis-
 sident areas of north Katanga.
 They apparently have also moved
 on to Kabalo.  The UN Command,
 endeavoring  to  enforce  its
 previously proclaimed cease-
 fire,  has moved Indian troops
 into Katanga at Kamina in the
 face of Tshombe's threats that
 their presence could mean "war."
 Hammarskjold told the General
 Assembly on 5 April that the
 entire Indian contingent of
 4,700 troops would be stationed
 in Katanga.   Most of the con-
 tingent, which is being sent
 by sea,  is scheduled to land at
 Dar es Salaam this week end.
 It will then be airlifted to
 Kamina.
 Elisabethville is tense,
 largely because of fear that
 Indian troops may be landed
 there.   On 3 April there were
 disorders  at  the  airport
 against Swedish troops after
 Katanga government officials
 had aroused the populace to ac-
 tion against the UN.   The next
 day, local and UN officials
 reached an agreement to per-
 mit joint control of the air-
 port by Katanga and Swedish
 troops.  The UN agreed to give
 Tshombe's government notice
 of anticipated movement of UN
 troops into Katanga.
 On 5 April,   however,
 Irish troops  were sent  to
 reinforce  the Swedish   forces
 at Elisabethville without ad-
 vance notice.   Renewed                                                               dis-
 orders                                                                may occur at any time
 if  reports  of the imminent
 arrival  of the Indian troops
 gain public circulation.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The USSR's initial re-
 sponse to the Western proposals
 at the nuclear test ban confer-
 ence suggests that Moscow is
 still undecided as to its future
 course of action.   After having
 previously indicated that a re-
 ply would be forthcoming after
 the Easter recess, chief Soviet
 delegate Tsarapkin on 4 April
 limited his remarks to accept-
 ance "in principle" of those
 Western concessions that accept-
 ed previous Soviet positions.
 He stated that Soviet special-
 ists were still studying other
 portions of the new Western
 plan.   Although Tsarapkin adopt-
 ed a more positive tone than he
 has used in his informal com-
 ments outside the conference,
 his statement represented no
 change in existing Soviet posi-
 tions.
 The Soviet delegate ac-
 cepted 1) the American and Brit-
 ish proposals for a permanent
 ban on testing in outer space;
 2) the Western offer to permit
 Soviet technicians to inspect
 nuclear devices to be used in
 both the research program for
 improving detection methods
 and in explosions for peaceful
 purposes; and 3) Western agree-
 ment to a veto over the total
 budget.
 Tsarapkin showed no flexi-
 bility on those aspects of the
 proposals where the West was
 not fully in accord with Mos-
 cow.   He maintained the Soviet
 position that there should be
 one-for-one parity in nuclear
 detonations for the peaceful
 uses program.   He also stated
 that the USSR continued to in-
 sist on a veto over individual
 portions of the budget and
 charged the West with incon-
 sistency in agreeing to the
 right of an over-all veto with-
 out allowing a veto on specific
 items.   He concluded by describ-
 ing his acceptance as a'"posi-
 tive step."  On the following
 day Tsarapkin again pressed
 the Western delegations to re-
 cord the conference's agree-
 ment in principle to the points
 accepted by the Soviet dele-
 gation.
 Although Tsarapkin failed
 to reiterate the Soviet proposal
 for a tripartite administration
 of the control system, Foreign
 Minister Gromyko told Ambassa-
 dor McCloy on 30 March that
 this was a "sticking point"
 for the USSR and admitted that
 Moscow desired a veto.   Gromyko
 said that while Moscow would
 make a serious study of the
 American proposals, he was not
 impressed thus far.  As an ex-
 ample, he stated that the USSR
 did not consider Western reduc-
 tion in proposed control posts
 in the USSR from 21 to 19 an
 important gesture.
 In a subsequent conversa-
 tion with an American official
 on 3 April, the head of the
 Polish UN delegation, who par-
 ticipated in the McCloy-Gromyko
 talks, stated that he had re-
 ceived the impression from
 Gromyko afterward that the test
 ban negotiations would be
 "locked " with no real progress
 until alter the talks on general
 disarmament had started and
 shown some signs of advance.
 The Pole said he believes the
 USSR is not completely aware
 of the serious negative effect
 a failure at Geneva would have
 on the US attitude toward
 general disarmament.

 Prior to Tsarapkin's re-
 marks on 4 April, the US dele-
 gation had been inclined to be-
 lieve that the USSR would pre-
 fer to have the West take any
 action in breaking off the con-
 ference and that the most likely
 Soviet tactic would be to pro-
 tract the negotiations.  This
 would have the advantages for
 Moscow of prolonging the cur-
 rent uncontrolled moratorium,
 of providing opportunities for
 underlying US and British di-
 vergences to emerge if pres-
 sure mounted in the US for re-
 newed testing, and of giving
 the USSR some justification
 for refusing nuclear weapons
 to the Chinese Communists.
 The delegation, however,
 believes that, in view of the
 forthcoming general disarmament
 talks,  the next French test
 may be used as a possible pre-
 text for a Soviet move to termi-
 nate  the talks--on the grounds
 that a test ban in itself would
 not contribute to disarmament--

 test ban with other disarmament
 plans,   There are no current
 signs that the USSR intends to

 Anti-Castro Groups
 Increased activity has been
 apparent in the past week among
 anti-Castro groups both inside
 Cuba and in exile.   Holy Week
 was the occasion for new popular
 that prospects for reaching a
 quick agreement on an  accept.
 able basis are not bright.
 Soviet propaganda commen-
 tary on the talks dropped off
 during the Easter recess.   After
 their resumption, however,
 Pravda published the text of
 fi aapkin's interview with CBS
 correspondent Schorr on 23
 March in which the Soviet dele-
 gate termed the main Western
 proposals unacceptable.   In an
 interview with the East German
 news service on 30 March, Tsar-
 apkin described the Western
 concessions as "much ado about
 nothing."
 a treaty invalid.
 Referring to the US offer
 of parity representation on the
 control commission, Tsarapkin
 said that consent to the prin-
 ciple of parity "was linked
 with so many conditions that in
 practice very likely nothing
 will be left of it."  He claimed
 that on all other essential
 points except those which ac-
 cepted known Soviet positions,
 the US was "simply adhering to
 its old point of view, which
 is unacceptable to the Soviet
 Union."  Tsarapkin also charged
 that continuation of French test-
 ing                                        25X1

 in several bloc countries, con-

 agreement with the East German
 regime on 29 March providing
 for the exchange of cultural
 groups, TV programs, and "in-
 formative material."   Although
 East Germany remains the only
 bloc country with which Cuba
 does not yet have formal diplo-
 matic relations, recent East
 Berlin broadcasts have reported
 the arrival there of a Cuban
 "mission," apparently permanent,
 which was greeted by officials
 of the East German Foreign Min-
 istry.
 Municipal officials of
 Moscow and Peiping are current-
 ly touring Cuba, returning the
 recent visits by the former
 Havana  municipal councilor.
 The Economy
 The recent visit to Vene-
 zuela by the Soviet ambassador
 to Mexico was followed by re-
 ports that   Moscow   is   seek-
 ing to have Venezuela resume at
 least a portion of its petroleum
 exports to Cuba.   Although the
 Soviet Union has considerably
 expanded its tanker fleet since
 it began providing Cuba with all
 its petroleum needs in mid-1960,
 a resumption of Venezuelan oil
 shipments to Cuba would relieve
 the USSR of at least a portion
 of an expensive burden.
 The Cuban refineries were
 built to process Venezuelan
 crude, and have not operated as
 efficiently with the Soviet
 product, which has a relatively
 high sulfur content.   In addi-
 tion, the "lighter" Soviet crude
 does not provide the quantities
 of fuel oil required by Cuba,
 which necessitates large addi-
 tional imports of fuel oil.
 It is unlikely that Venezuela
 will soon resume its traditional
 exports to Cuba.   In any event,
 Venezuela's insistence on cash
 payment for its oil sales would
 require Moscow either to pro-
 vide  Cuba  with                                                                the  neces-

 000 tons which the Sino-Soviet
 bloc is committed to buy. This
 quantity,  about two thirds of
 the total expected crop, will
 be sold or bartered to the bloc
 at a premium price of four cents
 per pound. The remainder--the
 "sacrifice crop" for which the
 workers  are to receive lower
 wages--is to be sold on the

 The rebel provisional Al-

 modified its 31 March announce-
 ment that it would cancel the
 negotiations scheduled to begin
 t Evian on 7 April, apparently
 in an effort not to close the
 door completely on a negotiated

 the attitude of the insurgents,
 Officials of the Ministry for
 Algerian Affairs apparently feel
 that the rebels'  31 March an-
 nouncement was an attempt to
 exploit Joxe's speech in order
 to rush the French into taking
 a firm position on the issue of
 the exclusive right of the PAG
 to represent Algeria in negotia-
 tions.   France has repeated its
 willingness to talk to the rebels
 on the same terms they agreed
 to in March, but it is not ex-
 pected to compromise its funda-
 mental position that the PAG
 alone cannot decide the future
 of Algeria.
 The PAG position is out-
 wardly a reaction to French Min-
 ister for Algeria Joxe's confir-
 mation on 30 March that prior to
 and during the Evian talks France
 would consult with other Algeri-
 an groups--including the Algeri-
 an National Movement (MNA). The
 PAG considers that any sugges-
 tion that the French would deal
 with the rival MNA on the same
 basis as with its representatives
 would undermine the PAG claim
 to be the sole spokesmen for the
 Algerian people:  The PAG lead-
 ers undoubtedly feel that if
 they went to Evian under these
 circumstances they would be dis-
 credited both internationally
 and in the eyes of the rebel
 fighting forces.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 in Tunis on 3 April that the
 PAG considered Joxe's statement
 symptomatic of basic French un-
 willingness to negotiate "sin-
 cerely" or "realistically."
 Boussouf and Yazid, who stressed
 that they were authorized to
 speak for the PAG, pointed out
 that the rebels had been aware
 since 27 March of Paris'  inten-
 tion to consult the MNA and had
 warned the French publicly and
 privately that any such consulta-
 tions would have to be completed
 before the Evian talks to avoid
 confusing them.
 There are indications that
 the PAG resolve to seek a nego-
 tiated settlement may have di-
 minished.   The US embassies in
 Tunis and Paris feel the PAG
 may have a genuine fear of being
 tricked or outmaneuvered. How-
 ever, Tunisian Secretary of
 State for Information Masmoudi
 asserted on 3 April that the PAG
 was delaying negotiations be-
 cause rebelvice premier Belkacem
 Krim's illness had prevented
 agreement on the composition of
 the Algerian delegation.
 Tunisian President Bourguiba
 told the US ambassador on 3 April
 that the PAG leaders were not
 following his advice to avoid
 excessive caution.  Bourguiba
 further stated his opinion that
 Cairo and Moscow were playing
 on every fear and suspicion of
 the PAG.   He thinks the rebel
 leaders are concerned over the
 complexities of assuming power
 in Algeria,   and  are  not  yet
 ready  to  take   sufficient
 risks  to crystallize independ-
 ence.
 Party leader Ulbricht's re-
 cent "liberalizing" measures to
 placate the East German populace
 and bring economic goals more in
 line with reality have not had
 the desired effect of reducing
 the refugee flow through West
 Berlin.   More than 5,200 East
 Germans reportedly fled to West
 Berlin over the Easter week end,
 in addition to the 30,000 who
 had escaped during the first
 three months of the year;  ap-
 proximately 20,000 fled in the
 first three months of 1960.
 Among the escapees are
 more than 5,500 young men of
 military age who presumably are
 seeking better job opportunities.
 Intellectuals and professional
 men also continue to escape in
 large numbers.   The West-East
 flow--returning defectors as
 well as some West German emi-
 grants--was at one time an im-
 portant countervailing influence
 but appears to have dropped
 sharply over the last 18 months.
 At the 12th plenum of the
 Socialist Unity party Z'SED")- end-
 ing on 19 March, Ulbricht at-
 tempted to take a middle-of-the-
 road position on the refugee
 question, apportioning blame for
 the flights almost equally be-
 tween harsh "sectarian" prac-
 tices by East German officials
 and "recruitment by the slave
 trade, systematically directed
 from Bonn."   Ulbricht is ob-
 viously confronted by a problem:
 Khrushchev wishes to avoid any
 incidents resulting from an im-
 position of harsher East German
 security measures to bar access
 to West Berlin, yet Ulbricht
 must curtail the flights, which
 not only seriously cut into the
 already short supply of East
 German manpower but also impair
 the regime's prestige drastical-
 ly.   He must also consider the
 potentially explosive effect on
 an already discontented populace
 if the Berlin escape hatch is
 closed.
 While there has been no di-
 rect evidence that party leaders
 are criticizing Ulbricht's liber-
 alization policies, the mounting
 intensity of his attacks on
 "sectarians" suggest that mid-
 dle-level party officials are

 becoming increasingly outspoken
 in demanding harsher measures
 to prevent escapes.
 Tpresent Soviet

 do so.   Instead, the SED was
 using the "soft" approach to
 eliminate some of the grievances

 facilitated by a belief that
 the ambiguous outcome of the
 international Communist meeting
 in Moscow last fall permits the
 expression of divergent--even
 Titoist--views.
 The extent of support from
 outside the party is not known.
 The US Legation has noted re-
 cent efforts by the Bulgarian
 authorities to impose further
 restrictions on contacts between
 some Western legations and Bul-
 garian citizens, a move which
 may have been intended to pre-
 vent word of the opposition
 groups from leaking out.
 An editorial in the April
 issue of the party's monthly,
 Party Life, confirms rumors
 that have reached Western diplo-
 mats in Sofia that Dobri Terpe-
 shev and Yonko Panov--former
 leaders ousted for "revisionist"
 sympathies--were ringleaders.
 These two, plus Nikola Kufard-
 zhiev--probably the secretary
 of the Central Council of Trade
 Unions--allegedly organized
 "faithless and distrustful"
 party members who "gloat over
 difficulties" and who have "sold
 themselves to foreign agents."
 Although the editorial did
 not identify the "foreign agents,"
 rumors have linked the group
 with Vladimir Sindjelic, second
 secretary of the Yugoslav Lega-
 tion who was declared persona
 non grata on 7 March.   At that
 time, Sofia publicly charged him
 with having attempted to make
 contacts with Bulgarian citizens
 and with denouncing the Bulgarian
 regime and its policies.
 By suggesting that the
 Yugoslavs are behind the opposi-
 tion groups, the regime may be
 attempting to play down internal
 causes of dissension.   The re-
 gime's overly ambitious economic
 policies of 1959-60 have left
 the regime vulnerable to charges
 of unrealistic planning.   In ad-
 dition, several programs adopted
 in connection with the "leap
 forward"--such as the sweeping
 administrative reorganization
 and rapid merging of collective
 farms--have been accompanied by
 many new problems.
 The US Legation has noted
 a sense of urgency in several
 measures taken since the first
 of the year to deal with agri-
 cultural problems.   This urgency
 may reflect efforts to fore-
 stall further criticism from
 opposition elements.  A full-
 dress party central committee
 meeting will convene on 12
 April to consider all aspects
 of agricultural problems and
 planning.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Yugoslav President has
 been well received at all his
 stops; Ghana and Guinea were the
 high spots. His short visit to
 Mali--arranged after the tour
 was already in progress--was
 also successful. The communiques
 Tito signed with the leaders 'of
 these three states played up the
 themes often espoused by Bel-
 grade, such as anticolonialism,
 the UN's failure in the Congo,
 and aid without strings for un-
 derdeveloped states.
 Tito held a press confer-
 ence on 26 March in Conakry,
 Guinea, which revealed that he
 had discussed questions of do-
 mestic policies with some lead-
 ers and believes the area is
 ready to adopt some Yugoslav
 ideas.   He stated that "the
 goal" of the African peoples is
 "socialist development" but
 that "leading figures in these
 countries do not believe that
 socialism can be attained in
 the classical manner, according
 to a rigid mold"--i.e., as en-
 visioned by the Soviet bloc.
 "There is a tendency among the
 people in these countries to
 follow our example in many
 things," Tito claimed.   In his
 speeches, Tito has consistently
 pictured Yugoslavia as a coun-
 try which has successfully met
 many of the problems now faced
 by Africa, and he has offered
 aid, including financial.
 While in Togo, Tito told
 Prime  Minister  Olympio that
 neither the Soviets nor the
 Chinese Communists are to be
 trusted, according to Western
 diplomats.   "You can do business
 better with the Americans than
 with the Russians," Tito said.
 CAMEROUN
 The Republic of Cameroun
 is pressing in the UN for an-
 nulment of the plebiscite held
 last February in the northern
 sector of the British trust ter-
 ritory of Cameroons, which opted
 for union with Nigeria.   This
 effort by Cameroun is motivated
 largely by the southern sector's
 simultaneous vote in favor of
 joining the Republic. President
 Ahidjo's moderate regime has
 drawn its main support from
 the conservative Moslem rulers
 of the backward northern party
 of Cameroun.
 It now is confronted with
 the prospect of stronger opposi-
 tion from more radically in-
 clined political,-elements com-
 mon to the more modernized
 southern areas of both the Re-
 public and the British Cameroons.
 Cameroun, a country of some 3,-
 200,000 people, now must absorb
 an additional 300,000 Bamileke
 tribesmen living on both sides
 of the border whose restiveness
 in recent years bas.been ex-.
 of the Cameroun People's Union
 (UPC), a Communist-influenced
 nationalist organization.
 In addition, a new and pow-
 erful personal rival to Ahidjo
 has been .projected into Cameroun
 politics in the person of South-
 ern Cameroons Premier Foncha,
 who campaigned much more vigor-
 ously for "reunification" than
 did the Cameroun government.
 Foncha's prestige and bargaining
 position have been boosted sig-
 nificantly by the unexpectedly
 large majority--about 70 per-
 cent--for union with Cameroun.
 Backed by a National As-
 sembly resolution, Ahidjo's gov-
 ernment has instructed its dele-
 gation to the resumed UN Gener-
 al Assembly session to contest
 the plebiscite results in North-
 ern Cameroons and to seek an-
 other vote there--or even in
 both sectors.  As the basis for

 irregularities by British admin-
 istrators before and during the

 A continuation of Cameroun's
 inflexible attitude seems cer-
 tain to impose a severe strain
 on its relations with Nigeria.
 Northern Nigerian leaders, whose
 influence predominates in the
 federal coalition government,
 have publicly stated their vital
 interest in Northern Cameroons,
 which had been administered as
 part of Nigeria's Northern Re-
 gion prior to last October. The
 Communist bloc's failure so far
 to exploit the issue apparent-
 ly stems from an appreciation
 of this Nigerian sensitivity.
 Ahidjo's anxieties have
 been compounded by an apprecia-
 tion of the many thorny practi-
 cal problems--legal, linguistic,
 monetary, administrative, and
 security--involved in the at-
 tempt to federate British South-
 ern Cameroons with the French-
 speaking Republic.   Already
 hard pressed to maintain order,
 he is particularly concerned
 over the possibility that in-
 ternational pressures might
 force the British to surrender
 their responsibilities in the
 southern sector before he can
 find replacements for their ad-
 ministrative and security per-
 sonnel.   Such a development
 would invite new UPC-inspired
 disorders and probably lead to    25X1
 pressure for direct assumption
 of these responsibilities by the
 UN "itself.
 The stability of the
 Senegalese Government, headed
 by pro-French President Leopold
 Senghor,is impaired by internal

 apparently pushed through
 Senegal's recent recognition
 of Communist China and North
 Vietnam in the face of Senghor's
 desire to temporize.
 Other elements of the UPS,
 particularly many younger mem-
 bers whose outlook has much in
 common with that of the militant
 nationalists of Mali and Guinea,
 want to relax,  if not discard,
 Senegal's close ties with France
 (Senegal is one of only six
 states retaining formal member-
 ship in the French Community).
 They object to the President's
 indiscriminate placement of
 friends and relatives on the
 public payroll and his efforts
 to clip the wings of Valdiodio
 N'Diaye, ambitious young inte-
 rior minister and acting defense
 minister.
 These elements are also
 dissatisfied with Senghor's
 refusal to permit a merger of
 the UPS and the only legal
 opposition party, the small,
 leftist African Regroupment
 party  (PRA-Senegal), which is
 popular among student, youth,
 and some labor groups.   The
 President has recently subjected
 this  party to pressures which
 have weakened its organization
 and capabilities.
 A belief also appears to
 be growing within the regime
 that Senghor's removal would
 facilitate a rapprochement with
 neighboring Mali, whose leaders
 have been enforcing a costly
 economic blockade against Sene-
 ;al since last August, when
 Senegal abruptly pulled out of
 its federation with Mali.   Sen-
 ghor's devout Catholicism and
 his French wife do not strength-
 en his position among his over-
 whelmingly Moslem countrymen.
 Last month,  in Dia's ab-
 sence,  Senghor permitted the
 legislature to vote itself a
 substantial retroactive salary
 increase.  Viewing this as an
 inadmissible blow to his auster-
 ity program, Dia fought hard in
 party councils for nullification
 of the assembly's action and
 even threatened to resign.  In
 the end, he and his followers,
 including major labor elements,
 decided not to force a minis-
 terial crisis on the eve of the
 ceremonies held this week com-
 memorating Senegal's independ-
 ence.
 With the celebrations over,
 Dia now is expected to resume
 his fight, pushing vigorously
 on both the salary question and
 other issues.   These include
 a cabinet reshuf f le over which
 Dia and Senghor have long been
 at odds.   Dia could thereby
 precipitate a major political
 upheaval,  including a concerted
 move to force Senghor's retire-
 ment.   Any successor regime
 would almost certainly be anti-
 French and more inclined toward
 the radical African bloc.
 Senegal has a small, ac-
 tive group of Communists and
 fellow-travelers drawn from an
 elite influenced by the French
 left.   These extremists are not
 now in a position to bid for
 power independently, but they
 influence large segments of the
 urban population.  They are in-
 cluded within the leadership of
 PRA-Senegal and the Communist-
 line African Independence party,
 which was banned by the govern-
 ment last July.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Israel views the trial of
 Adolf Eichmann,       to begin in
 Jerusalem on 11 April,  as much
 more than an act of retribution
 against one of Jewry's chief
 persecutors under the Nazis.
 The dispute over the legality
 of Eichmann's seizure and trial
 has already provided Ben-Gurion
 with an occasion for emphasizing
 Jewish nationalism and  Israel's
 claim to be the spokesman for
 world Jewry.   The prime minister
 has also made clear that he ex-
 pects the trial to establish a
 link between the Nazis and some
 Arab rulers, both during and
 since the war.   The principal
 target almost certainly will be
 UAR President Nasir
 BenGurion
 also hopes the trial will "edu-
 cate" young Israelis and remind
 the world of the results of ex-
 treme anti-Semitism.
 There are indications,  how-
 ever,                    that Israeli anticipation
 of these propaganda benefits is
 tempered by uneasiness.   Eich-
 mann's West German lawyer ap-
 parently intends to reopen the
 international controversy over
 Israeli jurisdiction by charg-
 ing that Eichmann was forcibly
 abducted from Argentina and not
 extradited.   Evidence may be
 introduced into the trial about
 wartime bargaining between
 Zionists and Eichmann for the
 release of Jewish prisoners--
 in exchange for trucks and
 other war materiel.   This could
 reflect adversely on certain
 prominent Israelis who took in
 the negotiations and revive
 passions in Israel over allega-
 tions that Hungarian Jews were
 sacrificed in favor of other
 Jews as part of an abortive
 deal.   Former Prime Minister
 Moshe Sharett is most frequent-
 ly mentioned as one who might
 suffer from such revelations.
 Testimony about this inci-
 dent might also involve the
 British Government, which during
 the war arrested the negotiating
 intermediary and put pressure
 on Zionist authorities to re-
 ject Eichmann's offer.   London
 is prepared to rebut criticism
 of its role by citing its strong
 suspicions of the intermediary
 as well as the Nazi interests he
 served in seeking vital war
 materiel, allegedly for use on
 Germany's eastern front.
 The Soviet bloc undoubtedly
 views the trial as an opportunity
 to discredit the West German
 Government by repeating standard
 charges of the Nazi background
 of high-level officials in Bonn.
 East Germany has sent a notori-
 ous West Berlin Communist lawyer
 to Israel with "evidence" impli-
 cating present West German of-
 ficials as Nazi functionaries
 and showing the Ulbricht regime
 as the "good" German state.   it
 probably also will attempt to
 send delegations of East German
 victims to Jerusalem to support
 its case.
 West Germany fears that the
 trial will lead to an increase
 in anti-German resentment in the
 Western world,  and particularly
 that it will add to German-
 American frictions.   There is
 also concern in Bonn that alle-
 gations might come out during
 the trial against leading mem-
 bers of the Bonn government,
 especially Adenauer's aide Hans
 Globke,  who helped draft the
 Nuremberg racial laws.   Adenauer's
 party is concerned that these
 charges might be harmful in the
 September national election.
 The Greek Government is
 expecting the subject of the
 moving of 20,000 Jews from
 northern Greece to extermination
 camps in Poland, and Globke's
 implication therein,  to be
 raised at the trial.   Eichmann's
 personal fate, meanwhile, will
 be determined by his formal
 prosecution for 15 crimes,  12 of   25X1
 which could draw the death
 penalty.

 CHEN 1I IN INDONBtaIA
 The visit did,  however,
 give a further boost to these
 relations, which have been
 slowly improving since last
 summer.   The Indonesian press
 was unanimously friendly, ap-

 President Sukarno.   In an at-

 old ties, Chen announced that
 Peiping was ready to resume its

 since the summer of 1959 when
 the dispute over Overseas Chi-
 nese in Indonesia erupted. Chi-

 up to that time had reached
 $48,000,000, but Djakarta never

 Chen used his visit to com-
 ment on a,number of other issues
 in China's foreign policy, both
 in his discussion with Indone-
 sian officials and in a free-

 particular pains to emphasize
 Communist China's community of
 interests with the Afro-Asian
 nations and made an implied dig
 at the USSR. He was widely quoted
 in the local press--and did not
 later. deny it--as having sug-
 gested that the Western powers,
 as well as the USSR, had domi
 nated'the international scene for
 a number of years but had proved
 incapable of solving world prob-
 lems.   He told his hosts that
 if Communist China and Indonesia
 were to get together with the
 Afro-Asian nations, world ten-
 tions could be overcome.
 In this vein, Chen joined
 with Subandrio in a call for a
 second Afro-Asian conference to
 take up the work of the one held
 in Bandung,  Indonesia, six years
 ago.   Djakarta has favored the
 convening of another such con-
 ference for a number of years,
 as has Peiping.   The idea, how-
 ever, has not been equally popu-
 lar in other important capitals,
 notably New Delhi.
 Indonesian officials who
 talked with Chen were impressed
 with the "tough" tone he adopted
 toward the US.   Just two weeks
 before, he had assumed a con-
 ciliatory tone in a discussion
 with                              in   25X1

 Chen had binteo that Peiping
 might have some desire for better
 relations with the US.   At       a

 is reported to have said he saw
 "no hope" for improved relations
 with the US "if the present

 Despite the sharp deteri-
 oration in Britain's balance of
 payments on current account last
 year, the Macmillan government
 seems likely to continue its
 present economic policies based
 on restraining inflationary
 trends and maintaining inter-
 national confidence in the pound
 sterling.
 Figures published on 29
 March show-that last year Brit-
 ain suffered its largest bal-
 ance of payments deficit on cur-
 rent account in the four deficit
 years since the Conservatives
 came to power in 1951.   Exports
 increased by 6 percent on the
 basis of higher sales in West
 Germany,  with European Free
 Trade Association partners, and

 maintain its commitment to the
 UN Emergency Force in Gaza--
 about 1,200 troops--while at
 the same time making nearly
 5,500 troops and technicians
 available to the UN for service
 in the Congo.
 The army's increased size
 has strained its logistic capa-
 bilities,  its training facili-
 ties,  its officer corps, and its
 materiel situation.   However,  it

 This modest rise was overshad-
 owed, however,  by a 14-percent
 rise in imports, which offi-
 cials attribute to an unusual-
 ly high build-up of inventories.
 Despite this deficit, and
 despite large payments to the
 International Monetary Fund and
 on United States and Canadian
 loans, Britain's gold and dol-
 lar reserves increased $495,-
 600,000 to a total of $3,231,-
 200,000,primarily because of
 an influx of capital resulting
 from the weakness  of the dol-

 the US economy this year will
 sharply reverse the flow.   In-
 ternational awareness of Brit-
 ain's economic weakness brought
 sharp speculation against the
 pound when West Germany and the
 Netherlands revalued their cur-
 rencies in early March; this
 speculation brought a fall of
 $173,600,000 in the gold and
 dollar reserves in that month.
 The annual budget to be
 presented on 17 April will in-
 dicate whether the government
 is sufficiently concerned to
 de-emphasize monetary and cred-
 it restrictions to control do-
 mestic inflation, and to under-
 take a major revision in Brit-
 ain's tax system to stimulate
 economic growth.   With general
 elections some three years away,
 the Macmillan government's op-
 portunity for invoking unpopular
 measures is as great as it will
 ever be, but the new budget
 seems likely to continue along
 previous lines--emphasizing de-
 fense of the pound, and possi-
 bly reinforcing some of last
 fall's modest measures to stim-
 ulate exports.
 Last year's 26-percent
 rise in exports to the Soviet
 bloc will encourage further ef-
 forts in that direction and more
 pressure for relaxation of COCOM
 restrictions. Since trade with
 the Common Market area has also
 been on the rise, the government
 will probably see no reason to     25X1

 an intellectual elite undisturbed
 by interference from the masses.

 Ministry, at 39 is one of the
 promising new generation of
 Austrian diplomats.  As Raab's
 private secretary for five
 years he gained a detailed knowl-

 the government and is said to

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Apparently the reforms are
 still not being implemented fast
 enough to suit a young officer
 group.   These officers are
 aware of the demands for social
 change in the rural areas--
 where visiting US officials re-
 cently reported wide interest
 in President Kennedy's Latin
 American "Alliance for Progress."
 They insist that some cabinet
 members are too much under the
 obstructive influence of wealthy
 Landowners.
 The US Embassy has been
 told that pressure from this
 group is prompting a cabinet
 reorganization in which the
 heads of all ministries except
 labor and public works are to
 be replaced in the near future.
 The changes would be aimed
 at more energetic implementation
 of the reform program rather
 than any radical shift in the
 government's political orienta-
 tion.   There is a possibility,
 however,  that the plantation
 owners and prominent businessmen
 may resort to bribery and sub-.
 sidized violence in their ef-
 forts to frustrate the reforms.
 There are also some reports
 that the pressures for political
 change may even lead to reorgan-
 ization of the five-man civil-
 military directorate that came
 to power on 25 January. If this
 happens, Col. Anibal Portillo,
 its senior military member,
 may emerge as a new strong man.
 Col. Portillo said on 21
 March that approval of an elec-
 tion law was imminent, but that
 congressional elections would
 be postponed beyond earlier es-
 timates to August.   Apparently
 the directorate is delaying in
 carrying out its pledge of early
 elections until'a party sympa-
 thetic to its reform program
 becomes strong enough to win
 over the party followings of
 former Presidents Lemus and
 Osorio.   Once seated,  the leg-
 islature is to elect a provi-
 sional president to finish Le-
 must unexpired term ending in
 September 1962.
 Meanwhile,  there is danger
 of friction with  neighboring
 Honduras.         Many Salvadorans
 regard  President     Villeda
 Morales  as  too tolerant of
 pro-Communist  activity  and of
 Salvadoran  Communist  exiles
 in         particular, and some mil-
 itary  and                                                              other  elements

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 THE TWO-CHINAS ISSUE
 Although Communist China's
 opposition to a two-Chinas for-
 mula is clear-cut and long--
 standing, Peiping faces a dilem-
 ma in fashioning a policy that
 will prevent a freezing of the
 present de facto separa
 tio
 n of
 Taiwan from the mainland.
 Its
 military aggressiveness
 in
 1958,
 by raising
 the specter
 of
 gen-
 eral war,
 crystallized
 two-Chinas
 sentiment throughout.theworld.
 On the other hand, the indef-
 inite- postponement of a military
 showdown risks a continued harden-
 ing of the situation and invites
 growing international pressures
 for a settlement on the basis
 of the long-established status
 quo.   Thus, from Peiping's point
 of view, there are cogent rea-
 sons for shifting policies from
 time to time in order to keep
 the situation in flux.
 At the moment Communist
 shelling of the offshore islands
 is desultory, and there apparent-
 ly has been no important aug-
 mentation of Communist forces
 in the area.  Although Peiping
 now and then refers to its
 "right" to take Taiwan by force
 if necessary, references to the
 "Liberate Taiwan" theme have
 been rare recently.   Present
 policy is described by Peiping
 as "mainly using peaceful means
 to enlighten the Taiwan authori-
 ties with a sense of national
 duty."  Assuming an attitude
 of enduring patience, Chinese
 Communist spokesmen have pro-
 fessed a readiness to wait as
 long as 30 years for Taiwan's
 "liberation."   "Time is our
 good ally," says Mao Tse-tung.
 Lest the decline in mili-
 tary activity be taken as Com-
 munist acquiescence in the exist-
 ing situation, Peiping con-
 stantly emphasizes its opposition
 to the two-Chinas concept.  Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai and Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi spelled out the
 Chinese position in some detail
 in press interviews last Novem-
 ber.   Chen told a group of visit-
 ing journalists that there would
 never be any change in Peiping's
 stand that Taiwan is an inaliena-
 ble part of China.   Chou told
 w u
 succeed only in "tying  things
 up in knots."
 Peiping also has branded
 as "unacceptable" such proposals
 as'UN-trusteeshtp for o r. demili-
 tarization. of Tai,an..or refer-
 ring the matter to the UN or
 the International Court of
 Justice.   It has, moreover,
 refused to separate the problem
 of the offshore islands from
 the issue of Taiwan, insisting
 that all "must be liberated as
 a whole."
 Concern Over Foreign Attitudes
 Peiping feels especially
 menaced by the prospect of
 American backing for the two-
 Chinas concept.
 Peiping has demonstrat-
 e   serious concern about the
 attitudes of other countries as
 well.   It has, for example, de-
 manded that Tokyo stop promoting
 "two Chinas" as one of the pre-
 requisites for both private
 trade and government-to-govern-
 ment relations with Japan.
 Hoping to whet the Japanese ap-
 petite for commerce, the Chi-
 nese relented slightly in early
 1959 and permitted a resumption
 of limited private trade.   In
 all other respects Peiping has
 held fast to its conditions.
 As recently as 2 April, Chen Yi
 warned the Japanese not to fol-
 low a two-Chinas policy.
 In contrast to its atti-
 tude toward Japan, Peiping has
 not demanded that other coun-
 tries sever relations with Tai-
 pei prior to signing government-
 level trade agreements.   it
 signed pacts with Egypt and
 Cuba while those countries still
 maintained relations with Tai-
 wan.                                                        When Peiping signed agree-
 ments with these governments,
 however, it felt they were

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 moving toward recognition, which,
 in fact, they were.        In the case
 of Lebanon, Peiping found that
 it had misjudged Beirut's in-
 tentions toward Taiwan.   A
 trade office opened by Peiping
 in Beirut in 1956 was closed in
 1960 because Lebanon had con-
 tinued to maintain its rela-
 tions with the Nationalists.
 International Organizations
 Peiping is willing to enter
 into bilateral negotiations with
 the Chinese Nationalists which
 could be represented as parleys
 between opposing sides in a
 civil conflict and would not
 prejudice the Communist position
 on the two-Chinas issue.   The
 regime, however, is adamant in
 its refusal to participate in
 a forum--such as the UN--which
 accepts the Nationalists as rep-
 resentatives           of a sovereign
 nation.   It would be a "total
 miscalculation," said Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi,  to think that
 Peiping would exchange Taiwan
 for a seat in the UN.
 Chou En-lai also made clear
 Peiping's categorical rejection
 of any possible compromise on
 25X1      the issue.
 25X1                        Chou affirmed
 a   i     e  so-called Taiwan
 clique is to appear in the UN
 under whatever form, in what-
 ever name, we will definitely
 refuse to sit together with
 them."
 this blow to Taipei's inter-
 national standing will gravely
 impair the Nationalists' morale
 and make them more vulnerable
 to "unification" overtures from
 Peiping.
 In recent months
 Peiping
 may have come to feel
 that
 the
 issue of UN membership
 can
 be
 directly linked not merely
 to
 the ouster of Taipei,
 but
 also
 to the elimination of
 all
 inter-
 national guarantees to
 the
 Chi-
 nese Nationalists.  Although
 there has as yet been no con-
 firmation from official sources
 in Peiping, Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi has been quoted in
 Hungary's party newspaper as
 saying that it will not be pos-
 sible for Communist China to
 take a seat in the UN until the
 United States ends its "occupa-
 tion" of Taiwan and withdraws
 its armed forces from the Taiwan
 area.
 This new condition may
 have been advanced in order to
 discourage further UN efforts
 to work out a two-Chinas com-
 promise.   It is quite possible,
 however, that the reported stif-
 fening of Peiping's terms does
 not represent a final position.
 Chou En-lai hinted at a com-
 promise acce table to Peiping
 ithe     must  orma -  5X1
 y agree to withdraw its forces,
 but that the specific steps and
 timing could be matters for
 "subsequent discussion."
 On this point, Peiping
 seems to have grown progressive-
 ly more adamant over the years.
 In November 1950, Communist
 China accepted an invitation to
 participate in the UN debates
 on Korea.   In 1955, however,
 it refused another UN invita-
 tion to participate in a Se-
 curity Council debate over the
 Taiwan Strait crisis.   The Chi-
 nese would almost certainly
 also refuse any such invitation
 today.
 The Communist estimate
 seems to be that obduracy--even
 if it delays Peiping's entry
 in the UN for years--will pay
 off eventually in the expulsion
 of the Nationalists, and that
 The Chinese Communist re-
 fusal to sit down alongside
 Chiang's representatives ex-
 tends to all international
 bodies.   The regime withdrew,
 for example, from the Inter-
 national Law Association, the
 International Astronomical Union,
 and other organizations that
 accepted Nationalist represent-
 atives.   Objecting to Taipei's
 participation in Olympic games,
 Peiping has refused to permit
 a runner to carry the Olympic
 torch VhrpUgh China en route
 to the 1964 games in Tokyo.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 China's opposition to a two-
 Chinas solution, it does not re-
 fuse to take part in international
 activities which also involve
 Nationalist participation.   The
 USSR's walkout from the Security
 Council in 1950 over the ques-
 tion of Nationalist China's
 presence resulted in a Soviet
 diplomatic defeat on the North
 Korean problem.   Since then,
 the USSR has found it the better
 part of wisdom to bear with the
 existing situation.
 Mali,. Taipei withdrew its embassy
 as soon as the government rec-
 ognized Peiping.   In the case
 of Senegal, some elements in
 the Nationalist government are
 opposed to withdrawing, hoping
 that Taipei's continued presence
 there will forestall the estab-
 lishment of a Chinese Communist
 diplomatic mission.   If such a
 mission is established, however,
 the Nationalists apparently will
 sever diplomatic relations with
 Senegal.
 While the Chinese Communists
 must recognize that it is es-
 sential for the Soviet Union
 to continue to participate in
 international bodies where Na-
 tionalist China is also repre-
 sented, they probably would
 prefer stronger support from
 Moscow on this question.
 For example, Soviet propa-
 ganda on the occasion of the
 Olympic Committee's decision
 to allow Taiwan to participate
 in the 1960 games at Rome was
 typical of the Soviet treatment
 usually accorded the issue.
 Peiping blasted that decision
 in broadcasts to Taiwan and
 elsewhere, but Moscow merely
 reported it in a matter of fact
 way, taking account of neither
 the issue nor Peiping's dis-
 pleasure.
 The Nationalist Position
 Taipei shares Communist
 China's distaste for a two-
 Chinas solution, but for tacti-
 cal reasons has compromised its
 position at least twice in the
 recent past.   In October 1958,
 Chiang agreed with the United
 States to renounce the use of
 force as a means of retaking
 the mainland.   In 1960 he re-
 luctantly allowed a team to
 participate in the Rome Olympics
 under the designation "Republic
 of China (Taiwan)," despite the
 implication that the athletes
 represented only part of China,
 Currently, Taipei is faced
 with a dilemma in Senegal, where
 the government has recognized
 both the Chinese Nationalists
 and the Chinese Communists.  In
 The Nationalist position
 is in part based on apprehen-
 sion that two-Chinas proposals
 have given encouragement to
 Taiwanese separatism and would,
 if implemented, lead to eventual
 domination of the government by
 Taiwanese.   The native Taiwanese,
 who comprise  86  percent of the
 island's population, are by and
 large in sympathy with some
 variant of a two-Chinas solution.
 Kao Yu-shu, a leader of the
 Taiwanese opposition to Chiang
 Kai-shek, recently told the
 American Embassy that virtually
 all of the Taiwanese favor either
 an independent Taiwan or some
 sort of neutralized status.
 The Chinese Communists have
 persistently attempted to ex-
 ploit the repugnance to Taipei
 of a two-Chinas solution, hoping
 to promote friction between the
 Nationalists and their American   25X1
 allies.   In the stream of Chi-
 nese Comm
 to Taiwan
 I                            (Peiping
 Charges that the United States
 is scheming to make its "occupa-
 tion" of Taiwan permanent by
 promoting international accept-
 ance of Taiwan's status as an
 independent political entity--
 perhaps under Taiwanese leader-
 ship.   The Communist press in
 Hong Kong was recently advised
 to play up Chiang Kai-shek's
 opposition to a permanent sepa-
 ration of Taiwan from the main-
 land and thus point up the com-
 munity of interests between
 Peiping and Taipei on the issue.
