 China Emphasizes Moderation;
 Leadership Differences Remain
 The personnel appointments and policy statements
 approved by China's Fourth National People's Con-
 gress are clearly designed to stress moderation and
 continuity.    The brevity of the congress, the first
 in a decade, and the initial secrecy in which it
 was held suggest, however, that leadership differ-
 ences have not yet been ironed out fully.
 The reappointment of Chou En-lai as premier,
 and. the naming of his close ally, Yeh Chien-ying,
 to the sensitive post of defense minister, under-
 scores Chou's continuing power and prestige as a
 seni!, r policy maker.
 'I'eng Hsiao-ping, elevated to the Politburo
 standing committee and named a vice chairman by the
 Central Committee plenum, which preceded the con-
 gress, appears to be Chou's logical successor.
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung, who attended neither
 the plenum nor the congress, has now been away- from
 Peking for over six months.  Only once before has
 Mao been absent from the capital for a longer time,
 and that was immediately before the onset of the Cul-
 tural Revolution when, Mao complained later, he was
 being circumvented and ignored by political oppo-
 nents.
 Mao's continuing meetings with foreign visitors
 indicate that his health remains reasonably good
 and suggests that his absence from Peking may have
 a political justification.  He may, for example,
 have been upset with the decision to wind down the
 anti-Lira, anti-Confucius campaign last July.  Propa-
 ganda articles issued as late as November, which

 may well have reflected the Chairman's personal
 views, appeared to be calling for a further effort
 in the campaign, particularly as it related to an
 assault on the military's political position.
 If Mao has remained in the countryside as a
 political gesture, it is likely that he is "sulk-
 ing in his tent" and has not been deliberately ex-
 cluded from the capital.
 The communiuue issued at the conclusion of
 the congress makes relatively little mention of Mao
 personally.  The guiding role of "Mao Tse-tung
 Thought," however,   as written into the new consti-
 tution and the chairman of the party was designated
 commander of the armed forces.
 All of this suggests that the Chairman is still
 a very active force in Chinese politics.
 The congress approved a list of 12 vice pre-
 miers, down from 15 before the Cultural Revolution.
 Teng Hsiao-ping heads the list, followed by Shang-
 hai party boss Chang Chun-chiao, who gave the re-
 port on the revision of the state constitution on
 behalf of the party Central Committee.  This assign-
 ment is a..iother indication that Chang is acting in
 the post of party secretary general, although he has
 never been publicly identified in that role.

 party constitution on behalf of the Central Commit-
 tee at the Tenth Party Congress in August 1973, did
 not gain a government post.
 Only a single military figure, Peking Military
 Region Commander Chen Hsi-lien, was included in the
 list of vice premiers.  This contrasts with four
 who served in this capacity before the Cultural
 Revolution.
 Li Te-sheng, who lc--t his job as head of the
 army's political department and was severely criti-
 cized last year, has been downgraded and is listed
 with the ordinary Politburo members.  Contrary to
 previous practice, the defense minister is not now
 a vice premier.   These changes indicate that the
 military has been further circumscribed in its
 political role.
 Even more striking is the downgrading of the
 political "left."  With the possible exception of
 Chang Chun-chiao, who rose to prominence during the
 Cultural Revolution but has long since seemed to
 have moderated his political views, no easily
 recognizable leftist was named vice premier.  The
 two most prominent leftists, Chiang Ching and Yao
 Wen-yuan, both of whom had claims to important
 government jobs, were passed over.
 There are now 29 ministries, compared with
 the 40 that existed before the Cultural Revolution.
 Some 15 new ministers were appointed, 6 of whom
 held vice-ministerial rank before the Cultural
 Revolution.   Two former provincial leaders are now
 ministers and most of the other new ministerial
 appointees held high rank before the congress.
 Most ministers are veteran bureaucrats, a number
 of whom were severely criticized during the Cultural
 Revolution.

 The man in th3 aonsitive job of minister of
 education falls into this category; he was secretary
 general of the State Council before the Cultural
 Revolution.  Almost none of the ministers could be
 considered "youthful" or--with the possible excep-
 tion of the new minister of culture--"leftist."
 The position of state chairman, which had been
 held by the disgraced Liu Shao-chi and had figured
 prominently in the Lin Piao affair, has been abol-
 ished.  According to Chang Chun-chia's speech, this
 and other constitutional revisions were designed to
 strengthen the party's control over the state struc-
 ture.
 The new government constitution, which is less
 than one third the length of the old one, repeats
 the fundamentals of moderate economic policies.
 --In agriculture, the production brigade, the
 lowest of the three organizational levels within
 the commune, remains the basic accounting unit,
 as has been the case since the failure of the Great
 Leap Forward.
 --Private plots and individual non-collective
 labor are retained.
 --The constitution repeats the standard formu-
 lation that agriculture is the economic "base" and
 industry the "leading factor."
 Compromise is evident in articles that guaran-
 tee the right to criticize officials and policies
 through public debates and wall posters and state
 that revolutionary committees will remain as per-
 manent government bodies.  Both provisions appear
 to be sops to the political left.

 Chang Chun-chiao's speech did provide a hint
 that there may be friction ahead.  He ncted that
 while state enterprises have the form of socialist
 ownership, in some cases leadership is not in the
 hands of real Marxist:, and the worker masses.  The
 implication of this phrase is not clear, but it
 may mean that new political attacks may develop

 The Washington Connection
 Relations with the US have been given a good
 deal of attention by the Chinese since Secretary
 Kissinger's trip in late November, but the signals
 in the public media and in private comments by
 Chinese officials have been mixed.
 Immediately after the visit, the Chinese gave
 some diplomats the impression of dissatisfaction
 over the resuli-s of talks on Taiwan, although Chi-
 nese continents seemed short on specifics.
 An apparently well-orchestrated campaign, which
 went further, emerged in early December.   It elabo-
 rated the themes that China was displeased over the
 pace of normalization of Sino-US relations and that
 normalization was directly linked to specific
 conditions regarding Taiwan.   This line was spread
 widely to journalists and foreign diplomats by left-
 ists in Hong Kong with ties to Peking, by Chinese
 diplomats abroad, and by officials in Peking.   It
 was, for instance, passed on to Senator Mansfield
 during his visit to China in mid-December.

 Sometime around mid-December, the views of
 knowledgeable Chinese officials on Sino-US rela-
 tions became more tentative.   Senior party offi-
 cial Keng Piao and a Foreign Ministry official
 who deals with American affairs, in separate
 private conversations, avoided characterizing
 Sino-US relations or repeating Chinese conditions
 for normalization even though both were provided
 ideal opportunities to do so. I
 Since then, the Chinese line has turned
 decidedly positive.
 The campaign

 to underscore the negative aspects of Sino-US
 relations seemed to fade in late December, and
 the lines it espoused regarding Taiwan have not
 been heard since.   In mid-January, Foreign Trade
 Minister Li Chiang downplayed the importance of
 the huge imbalance in Sino--US trade which favors
 Washington.  He indicated that China did not
 need an absolute balance and that the PRC planned
 to continue costly purchases of equipment and
 technology from the US.  Earlier, some Chinese
 spokesmen had pointed to the trade imbalance as
 an important irritant in Sino-US relations.
 On another plane, Chinese press criticism
 in December and January of several specific US
 foreign policies may have added to the impression
 of some observers that Peking had soured on
 Washington.   In fact, attacks on the US position
 with regard to Korea, Cambodia, and Third World
 power in the UN, and on the recently enacted
 Trade Bill followed well-established Chinese
 foreign policy lines which have no direct links
 to Sino-US bilateral relations.  Articles on US
 economic problems that tend to put the US in a
 negative light have long been a staple of Chinese
 propaganda and have not increased in frequency or
 intensity, although they have become more ideo-
 logical in cast.
 Similarly, a more even-handed treatment of
 the US and USSR in the joint New Year's editorial
 and recent banquet remarks by Vice Premier Li
 Hsien-nien and Chiao Kuan-hua are almost cer-
 tainly unrelated to Peking's view of Sino-US re-
 lations.

 in an outbreak of war--a newly prominent Chinese

 25X1               New Year's in the Provinces
 Chiang and Liao are veteran civilian cadre
 with long experience in provincial administration,
 as are the three other provincial bosses appointed
 in the last year:   C1%ao Tzu-yang in Kwangtung, Pai
 Ju-ping in Shantung, and Peng Chung in Kiangsu.
 Both Chiang and Liao face a tough challenge in
 asserting their authority in their new provinces.
 Armed clashes between competing factions have been
 reported in Kiangsi, and Peking's attempt to
 settle the dispute by calling rival leaders to
 the capital for consultations apparently has met
 with little success.  A similar situation exists
 in Fukien, where rival groups are split over loy-
 alty to the pre - Cultural Revolution first sec-
 retary, Yeh Fei, who was rehabilitated 17 months
 ago.
 Chiang's and Liao's status as rehabilitated
 former first secretaries may further complicate
 their positions.   Some figures who were purged
 during the Cultural Revolution apparently have
 had difficulty adjusting when returned to
 responsible positions.  One notable case involves
 ex-Anhwei boss Li Pao-hca, who proved ineffective
 in Kweichow because he was afraid to alienate
 anyone.  Moreover, those who have successfully
 made the transition first rejoined the fray in
 January 20, 1975
 The turnout in the provinces on New Year's
 was smaller and was reported in less detail than
 than on National Day, Octob r 1st

 eeping with the IOW-key celebration last year.
 The highlight of the holiday was the identifica-'
 tion of two new provincial first secretaries,
 Chiang Wei-ching in Kiangsi and Liao Chih-kao
 in Fukien.

 lesser posts and were only later promoted to the
 top spot.   Chiang and Liao are the first to go
 directly from Peking to a vacant first secretary-
 ship.  Peking will undoubtedly monitor their
 performances closely.
 The appointments in Kiangsi and Fukien leave
 only three provinces without a publicly designated
 leader:   Liaoning, Anhwei, and Hupeh.  Liaoning
 and Anhwei are closely associated with politburo
 member and party vice chaiz;man Li Te-sheng.  Li,
 who is a military man, was heavily criticized
 during the anti-Confucius campaign, and for a
 time his political survival was in question.   He
 still apparently has powerful enemies in Peking,
 and his presence in Liaoning as Shenyang Military
 Region commander is probably complicating the
 appointment of a new civilian first secretary there.
 This is possibly true in Anhwei as well, where his
 associate Sung Pei-chang is the ranking party sec-
 retary and military man.  The badly factionalized
 politics in Hupeh are probably complicating that
 appointment.
 Accounts of holiday gatherings in other prov-
 inces were notably scanty.  The whereabouts--and
 fates--of Heilungkiang first secretary Wang
 Chia-tao, Shansi first secretary Hsieh Chen-hua,
 Canton Military Region political commissar Jsn
 Ssu-Chung, and Lanchow Military Region commander
 Han Hsien-chu remain unclear, since both their
 home provinces and Peking failed to publish a de-
 tailed account of the local festivities.  The four
 senior military men were all under pcster attack
 during the anti-Confucius campaign and were unex-
 pectedly present in Peking on Nationa'. Day, possibly
 to answer to central authorities for ::heir past con-
 duct.   Three other provincial personalities who were

 A New Accomplice for Lin Piao?
 Chen Hsi-lien, politburo member and commander
 of the politically sensitive Peking Military Region,
 was apparently criticized by historical analogy
 in several articles appearing in major domestic
 publications last fall.  The criticism points up
 the current effort to further reduce military polit-
 ical power in general and the influence of certain
 military region commanders in particular.
 Both these objectives became a major focus of
 the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius campaign last July.
 At that time; posters attacking Chen and politburo
 member Hsu Shih-yu, who now commands the Canton
 Military Region, began to appear with some frequency,
 while poster criticisms of other national arid
 provincial leaders were on the wane.  Attacks against
 Chen-and Hsu had not been prominent during the earlier
 wave of poster criticisms.  In the case of Hsu, the
 poster attacks have continued in his former bailiwick,
 Nanking.  The attacks against Chen and Hsu, and the
 continued stress on enhancing party control over the
 military in domestic media, appear to be part of a
 continuing tug of war between civilian moderates and
 certain regional commanders and their allies at the
 center.
 One of the themes of the anti-Chen articles
 is that Han Hsin, a "senior general" in the Han
 Dynasty who is clearly identified as a Lin Piao
 figure, plotted with a regional military commander
 named Chen Hsi.  This man's surname  s the same
 character as that of Chen Hsi-lien.  r:o.:eover, one
 article notes that Chen Hsi commanded troops in the
 state of Chao, north of the capital.  Chen Hsi-lien,
 of course, commanded the Shenyang Military Region
 in northeast China for years before his rotation

 to Peking.  The article also alludes to the fact
 that the regional commander was in charge of the
 troops defending the border against the Huns (i.e.,
 the USSR), and that he conspired with the Huns'
 through others to try to overthrow the government.
 Lin Piao stands accused of conspiring with the
 Soviets in an attempt to seize power, and the article
 seems designed to link Chen Hsi-lien with Lin's
 alleged plot.
 The charges, which appeared in October and
 November, are ominous enough by themselves.  They
 are further underscored, however, by an article in
 the November Red FZaa by Lo Ssu-ting.  This article
 attacks, in the strongest terms, persons and groups
 during the Northern Sung period who wanted to capitu-
 late to the aggressors from the North.                         One group
 that received heavy fire was the "big landlord die-
 hards."  Many previous articles in the anti-Confu-
 cius campaign have established the parallel between
 the landlords or feudal princes and the military
 region commanders.
 The charge that Chen Hsi-?lien conspired with
 Lin does not seem to have validity.  Chen was one
 of the first military leaders to reappear after the
 Lin affair, and he played a major role in the subsequent
 investigations.   Chen may well have favored a less
 intransigent stance toward the Soviets, however--
 after all, he bore responsibility for defending
 Manchuria against Soviet attacks.   In this event,
 his stance in this issue could now be the basis
 for an effort to undermine his position by linking
 him--however transparent the real evidence--to Lin.
 At the least, the effort to brand Chen a covert
 Lin supporter brings considerable pressure to bear
 against him, and this may have been the objective
 in the short term.  Numerous reports have been re-
 ceived that the National People's Congress was

 being delayed because of delegate selection prob-
 lems, especially in limiting the number of military
 men.  The criticisms of Chen and Hsu Shih-yu could
 have been designed to break this log jam.  The at-
 tacks on Chen could also have been aimed at under-
 cutting his candidacy for defense minister, a post
 that was awarded to Yeh Chien-ying at the congress.
 Like other civilian and military figures, Chen
 survived serious political charges in 1974.  Now that
 the National reople's Congress has been held, it is
 likely that Peking will return to the problem of
 civil-military relations, and it would not be surprising
 to see the charges against Chen and others revived.
 While Chen was the only military man to be named a
 vice-premier--an honor that e en the new Defense Mini-
 ster did not enjoy--his transfer from Shenyang, where
 he was seemingly immune, to Peking in December 1973
 may yet lead to a reduction in hi  political position.

 China and Strauss:  Strange Bedfellows
 Peking is using the current visit. of promi-
 nent conservative German opposition leader Franz
 Josef Strauss to drive home strong Chinese views
 about German reunification, Moscow's threat to
 European security, and the need for European sol-
 idarity against the USSR.
 Strauss received unprecedented treatment in
 view of the unofficial nature of his visit and of
 his stature in German politics.   Strauss journeyed
 outside Peking for a meeting with Mao, he saw Chou
 in a Peking hospital. for an hour, and he talked
 with Teng Hsiao-ping, Chiao Kuan-hua, Deputy Army
 Chief of Staff Li Ta, and a deputy foreign trade
 minister.
 The closest recent parallel to Strauss' re-
 ception was the treatment accorded former British
 Prime Minister Heath in May 1974-  Heath, however,
 was a former head of government and the leader of
 the opposition, and his trip had been planned while
 he was still in office.   Strauss has not been a
 member of a German government for more than five
 years, and he is not regarded as a strong candidate
 for high office in the future.
 China's warm reception plainly reflects that
 Strauss shares many of Peking's views on European
 security and the USSR.   During his stay, Strauss
 expressed deep skepticism of Soviet strategic in-
 tentions regarding Europe and of the durability of
 detente with Moscow.  He indicated that he shared
 Chinese concern over the naivete of some Europeans
 regarding Moscow, and, like the Chinese, he called
 for a strong, united Europe in close military al-
 liance with the US as a bulwark against the USSR.

 According to the West German press, Strauss also
 went so far as to hint at overlapping Peking-Bonn
 interests in restraining Soviet strategic ambitions.
 Strauss said that the continuing division of
 Germany threatened European security, and he praised
 Chinese endorsement of eventual German reunification.
 The Chinese have been unable to elicit public sup-
 port for their views on this subject from several
 European visitors over the months, including the
 chairman of the Christian Democrats--a major oppo-
 sition party--Helmut  Kohl who visited Peking last
 September.
 Judging from initial reports of Strauss' sub-
 stantive discussions with senior officials, the Chi-
 nese moved away from recent new public themes regard-
 ing Europe back toward more familiar and established
 policy lines.  Earlier this month during visits by
 Maltese Prime Minister Mintoff and Dutch Foreign Min-
 ister Van der Stoel, the Chinese had publicly stressed
 the likelihood of US-USSR competition over Europe
 leading to a general war.  Strauss questioned Chiao
 Kuan-hua closely on this score, and, according to the
 Germans, Chiao made evasive and unconvincing arguments.
 The burden of Chinese statements during his visit,
 however, was that the threat. to Europe lay in Soviet
 ambitions.
 The Chinese strongly emphasized to Strauss that
 Washington should shoulder much of the burden of Eu-
 rope's defense, arguing defense of the US begins in
 Europe.

 Peking has entertained a number of prominent
 Western opposition figures who generally share
 Chinese distrust. of Soviet intentions, including
 Heath, Kohl, US Senator Henry Jackson, and now
 Strauss.   Chiao Kuan-hua recently expressed the
 view that European socialist governments "duped"
 by Moscow are the most dangerous forces in Europe.
 Chiao predicted that continued economic problems
 in the West would bring to power more conservative
 governments, distrustful of Moscow.

 25X1          Western Troubles Hurt Trade Balance
 Worldwide inflation is pushing up China's
 import costs while stagnation is cutting the demand
 for its exports.   China's deficit with the West
 in 1974 is estimated at $750 million.            The US and
 Japan caused most of the deficit--$700 million
 and $500 million, respectively.
 Peking has taken steps to reduce payments
 for imports.   Several contracts for foodstuffs,
 fertilizers, cotton, and steel were canceled or
 postponed before the Fall Canton Trade Fair.
 Peking ordered state-trading corporations to pur-
 chase only the most essential technology and
 equipment at the fair.    Highest priority went to
 imports of petroleum, mining, and food-processing
 equipment.   Since the fair, however, Peking has
 asked suppliers to speed up grain deliveries, re-
 flecting concern over a harvest that fell short of
 expectations.
 In addition to curtailing imports, China is
 attempting to switch from cash payments to short-
 term credits for some of its major commodity
 purchases.  Peking has arranged for 150-day credits
 from Japanese banks to purchase $40 million worth
 of fertilizer and $140 million worth of steel,
 payable at 11-12 percent interest.   China reportedly
 has filed a similar request for deferred payments
 on imports of 27 Trident aircrLtt from the British
 firm, Hawker Siddeley.
 China is also trying to increase exports by
 lowering prices for its traditional products--
 silk, textiles, and handicraft goods.   The export
 drive, however, has come at a time when world
 demand for many of these products is declining.

 25X1           New Twist for an Old Slogan
 Chinese propaganda has contained vague refer-
 ences to a "new leap forward" in the last severa:'.
 weeks,,  she phrase calls to mind the frantic and
 destructive economic activity of the "Great Leap
 Forwaid" that so seriously set back economic de-
 velopment from 1958 to 1960.   There is no evidence
 that the new leap heralds a return to those earlier
 radical policies, but the appearance of the phrase
 has caused much speculation in China watching circles.
 The phrase "new leap forward"as
 surfaced perio ica  y in routine PITyagallua  road-
 25X1                    casts from a number of different provinces, suggest-
 ing that the phrase is part of some central docu-
 ment.   It has not been featured in the national
 media, however, as would normally be expected.   Even
 provincial references to the new leap have been
 sporadic and without elaboration.
 The new "leap forward" may be just a fresh
 slogan in the seven-month-old campaign to boost sag-
 ging worker morale and thereby increase production,
 The phrase generally is seen in formulas calling on
 cadre to step up production "to welcome the new lea
 25X1

 forward in 1975,"                                         25X1
 do not seem to indicate that racii-
 ca  new economic policies are in the works, although
 some adjustments in current production plans are
 clearly being made,
 Other observers, however; have suggested that
 the new leap could be a leftist initiative that may
 even culminate in a higher level of agriculture
 collectivization,  long resisted by Chinese peasants.
 A recent editorial in the Hunan provincial paper
 can be cited as evidence:   the editorial stressed

 the "inevitable trend" toward complete collectiviza-
 tion, and demanded that cadre and peasant accept
 this unpopular fact.  Agriculture was completely
 collectivized during the Great Leap, but China's
 leaders were forced to retreat as the Great Leap
 collapsed,
 The Chinese for years have tacitly treated the
 original leap as an abysmal failure and in their
 present economic difficulties, it is unlikely they
 would turn to unpopular policies that had failed
 in the past?  Moreover, the Hunan editorial states
 that the present level of collectivization "suits the
 political and economic conditions,   and warns against
 "blindly" increasing collectivization--a "leftist
 error.."  There may be some increased emphasis on
 working collective holdings in comparison to private
 plots, and responsibility for certain functions that
 can be better handled at higher levels--e.g?,, water
 conservancy projects--may be transferred from produc-
 tion teams to parent production brigades or communes,
 but an upgrading of the overall level of collectivi-
 zation is much less  likely.   In any case,-  the views
 in the Hunan editorial are apparently local ones.
 So far, they have not appeared in other provinces
 nor have they even been repeated in Hunan,
 Chang Chun-chiao's report to the 4th National
 People's Congress endorsed current economic policies,
 including the present level of collectivization,   It
 did not mention the "new leap," but material sub-
 sequent to the congress may help illuminate the "new
 leap forward" and further clarify economic policy in
 general,.  F77                                      I

 25X1             Love the Army--But Love the Party Even More
 A new and potentially significant, aspect of
 Peking's continuing drive to reduce the power of
 provincial military men has recently been revealed
 in provincial circulars issued in conjunction with
 the annual "Love the Army and Cherish the People"
 campaign.  Civilian government and party organi-
 zations as well as military units routinely profess
 their mutual support under the overall principle
 of party control over the army.  This time, the
 first of the circulars, issued by the Tsinan Military
 Region on December .16, was unusually outspoken in
 its prescription for army obedience to party authority.
 As the other circulars have come in, however, clear
 differences have emerged in the degree to which mili-
 tary regions have endorsed the subordination of mili-
 tary units to civilian party committees at corresponding
 levels, indicating that. the idea has encountered re-
 sistance.
 The Tsinan statement remains the most far-
 reaching, and may have been a trial balloon.   The
 circular emphasized that while relationships
 within the military hierarchy were to remain
 unchanged, various military headquarters and units
 must "regard themselves as departments of military
 affairs of local party committees of the same
 level and consciously accept the leadership" of
 these committees.  Moreover, the circular spe-
 cifically stated that all field armies must accept
 the leadership of the provincial party committee.
 This was a new theme and suggested a move to make
 field armies, which are under the command of the
 military region, more responsive to the direction
 of civilian party authorities in the provinces  in
 which the units are stationed.

 Another reason why Tsinan may have been chosen
 to initiate this idea is that the region includes
 only one province, Shantung.   All but one of the
 ten other regions  include two or more provinces.
 Moreover, the party first secretary  i n Shantung is
 also the first political commissar of the military
 region.   Before regional party bureaus were abol-
 ished, they were a check on military regions, which
 are of higher administrative rank  than most prov-
 inces.  Now, this ranking, plus the multi-provincial
 composition of most military regions, gives the
 regional commanders some autonomy from provincial
 party leaders.   Furthermore, some regional commanders
 are members of the politburo or the central committee
 and outrank or at least equate with the rank of
 provincial party leaders.  Finally, in provinces
 that suffer from provincial strife or lack designated
 heads, troop commanders are often persons to be
 cultivated rather than ordered around.  All these
 factors have made it difficult for the divided
 leadership to force the genie of military political
 power back into the bottle.
 Nanking Military Region has come the closest
 to repeating Tsinan's extreme stance.  It may be
 more than coincidence that. Nanking is the former
 bailiwick of politburo member Hsu Shih-yu, who now
 commands the Canton region and appears to be a major
 target of the drive to reduce the military's political
 power.  Hsu was criticized by wallposters  in several
 cities in the Nanking region last fall.   Several other
 regions have ordered their units to obey local party
 committees, but Fuchou and Wuhan have said only that
 it was necessary to "respect" local party committees--a
 b
 su
 tle but nevertheless significant difference.
 Strife-ridden Chengtu Military Region was ambiguous
 in its circular, and Lanchou made no mention of the
 issue at all.   Kunming and Peking (where Commander
 Chen Hsi-lien has been under fire, see page 14)
 have not commented yet.   So far, no clear pattern has
 emerged from the eight regions involved in the December

 25X1            The United Nations:   Disappointment
 I
 The Chinese gave the recently concluded Gen-
 eral Assembly session low marks and were particu-
 larly disappointed by the behavior of the Third
 World countries.  Although the poorer nations
 voted as a bloc more than ever before, they split
 ranks when it came to support for the Chinese-
 backed resolutions on Korea and Cambodia--the
 most important items on the agenda as far as
 Peking was concerned.
 The General Assembly also took actions that
 diluted China's anti-Soviet efforts.  Although
 Peking co-sponsored resolutions affirming Pales-
 tinian rights and inviting the Palestine Libera-
 tion organization to participate in General As-
 sembly work as an observer, this stemmed from a
 desire to keep pace with Third World sentiment
 rather than genuine enthusiasm.  Indeed, the Chi-
 nese did not lobby at all for the resolutions.
 Obviously displeasdd about growing links between
 the PLO and Moscow, Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-
 hua recently told                               that
 the UN votes on the Palestine problem were "not
 too realistic and a bit shortsighted."  He went
 on to depreciate Arafat's speech by commenting
 that it was "a bit romantic."
 To Peking's dismay, Third World countries
 went along with several less important proposals
 backed by the Soviets.  On a number of disarmament
 resolutions, China either had to go down to de-
 feat with the minority or acquiesce to popular
 opinion.   The only bright spot was the passage of
 a resolution calling for the establishment of a
 nuclear-free zone in South Asia, a move that would
 be in the interest of China and Pakistan.  The

 Chinese were hoping to use the Charter of Economic
 Rights and Duties to rally the underdeveloped world
 against the super powers.   It turned out, however,
 that Peking was forced to vote for the charter
 while expressing sharp criticism of certain arti-
 cles that it said reflected Soviet input.   In re-
 porting the debate, NCNA cataloged Peking's reser-
 vations at some length and characterized certain
 provisions as "compromising" and "irrational."
 Peking's disenchantment with Third World
 voting in the General Assembly may have something
 to do with recent comments by a high Chinese of-
 ficial who deals with UN agencies.  Indicating
 that China plans to reduce its contribution to the
 UN Development Program, the official criticized
 the Group of 77, an influential coalition of poor
 countries within the world body.
 It is improbable that the Chinese will sig-
 nificant.ly downgrade the UN as part of their for-
 eign prlicy orchestration.  At the same time, the
 results of the General Assembly session may give
 pause to any plans Peking may have had to increase

 Mobutu's influence could well increase.   The new mil-

 Looking beyond Angolan independence, the Chi-

 important role in southern Africa's political evolu-

 Peking with some influence as black Africa starts to

 Given the calculus of forces at play, Peking
 probably sees greater advantages in peaceful, evo-?

 embroil Peking's prestige in a problem that is rela-

 Chiang Chin g's public activities tend to run
 in streaks.   She often punctuates periods of
 activity with unexplained absences.  Her return
 to view on January 2 after being out of sight for
 a month was, in its own unique way, characteristic.
 One important aspect of her re-emergence was
 unusual--she attended a banquet.   The affair was
 in honor of E. F. Hill, visiting Australian Com-
 munist Party head.  Previously, Madame Mao did not
 normally attend banquets for visiting dignitaries,
 but kept her name in the public eye by showing up
 at picture-taking sessions or cultural performances.
 The banquet for Hill was hosted jointly by
 Wang Hung-wen, Chang Chun-chiao, and Chiang Ching.
 Her presence at the banquet--like an earlier NCNA
 release in late September, which noted that Chiang
 had "entrusted" the Cultural Group under the State
 Council to give a soiree for Mrs, Marcos of the
 Philippines, and her mention along with Premier
 Chou by Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien in his banquet
 toast to Mrs. Marcos--suggested that she was
 attempting to gain a government post at the Na-
 tional People's Congress.   If so her efforts failed.     25X1

 Li Fu-chun suggests that Liang Pi.-yeh is a deputy
 director of the department.   He was listed
 between Yang Cheng-wu, who was recently named a
 deputy chief of staff, and Wei Po-ting, currently
 a deputy director of the department.  Liang could
 be a deputy chief of staff, or even director of
 the General Political Department, although his
 background makes it more likely that -.- is a dep-
 uty.
 Liang was a deputy director of the GPD prior
 to his fall early in the Cultural Revolution.  He
 was paraded through the streets of Peking in early
 1967 along with former marshal Lo Jui-ching, former
 Peking mayor Peng Chen, and other "capitalist
 roaders."
 Liang was    ose to Former Central-South Bureau
 chief and politburo member Tao Chu.  Tao has been
 widely rumored as marked for rehabilitation, but
 has not re-emerged.  Since Liang's return to the
 active ranks came over a year and a half after
 his initial reappearance, it does not necessarily
 foreshadow the return of Tao.

 In an effort to make the down-to-the-country-
 side program more attractive to local youth, Kwang-
 tung officials last July launched a series of
 incentives, including one that allowed one child of
 a retiring urban worker to leave the countryside
 and take the retiring parent's job,                            25X1

 it did nothing to relieve the urban population

 In a few provinces, local leaders
 were apparently using the groups as a buffer between
 themselves and unhappy workers, but a broadcast from
 Shanghai in July indicated that a less active and
 decidedly secondary role was what central leaders
 had in mind                                                        25X1
 Since then, Imferences to the groups' earlier, more
 active, use have disappeared from the provincial
 media, and they apparently have evolved into more
 than ordinary study groups.  Their latest passion,
 according tc: NCNA, is an in-depth review of the
 worsening economic conditions in the West.
