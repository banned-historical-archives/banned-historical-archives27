 V l ETWA~1
 rollowing the unconditional surrender of the Government of So~~~.th
 Vietnam by President Duong Van Minh on 30 April, Vietnamese
 communist broadcasts have triumphantly acclaimed the fall of aaigon
 and publicized a series of communiques from the communist mi1?Ltary
 command, various Saigon organizations, and the municipal "rc~?/olu-
 tionary commi.ttee."  'these communiques and comments were brr~adcast
 by Hanoi and Liberation Radio, quickly joined some five hou~,a after
 the surrender by the seized Saigon transmitter, now identified as
 the "liberated Saigon broadcasting radio, the Voice of the ~aigon-
 Gia llinh People," which linked its broadcasts in parallel ca:Lth
 Liberation Radio for extensive periods.  The PLAT Command .;ommunique
 echoed policies the communists have propc,unded for other ''':Liberated
 areas," calling for civil order and an end to resistance s~~c.id urging
 officers, soldiers, police, and civil servants to "return to the
 people."  The media also publicized an appeal from the "people's
 revolutionary committee" for the southern Mekong Delta area which
 urged the capitulation of soldiers and civilians in areas not yet
 controlled by communist forces.
 The initial Vietnamese communist commentary on the fall of Saigon,
 broadcast repeatedly by the three radios, jubilantly described the
 hoisting of PRG flags throughout Saigon and recalled that the South
 Vietnamese capital had been given the name "City of Ho Chi Minh"
 following the August  Revolution in 1945.  the commentary confirmed
 that the final communist advance on the city--in an o~~eration also
 code-named "Ho Chi rtinh"--had begun on 26 April.  It '..vas on this same
 day that communist media had broadcast an intransigent PRG statement
 which had c3.osed the door on the possibility of tranF~ferring power
 through the facade of an interim Saigon government and had called upon
 the people of the capital to help bring down the South Vietnamese
 Government.
 The initial Soviet reaction to the downfall of the Saigon government
 came on the 30th in a TASS commentary by Sergey Bulantsev which
 po?trayed Saigon's defeat as the "inevitable" fate of a "puppet
 reg?ime."  TASS also carried a brief account of Secretary Kissinger's
 29 April press conference following the announcement that the airlift
 of Americans from Saigon had been concluded.  fhe TASS report noted
 that, in response to a quPStion on the influence of events in Southeast
 Asia on Soviet-U.S. detente, Kissinger had stated that despite ideolog-
 ical differences there was a practical basis for cooperation, particularly
 ?n preventing nuclear war.  Peking's only response so far to the communist
 takeover has been two brief NCNA reports quoting LPA.
 COMMUNISTS SPURNED COMPROMISE BEFORE FINAL ASSAULT ON SAIGON
 The PRG's 26 April government statement effectively blocked the frantic
 efforts by Saigon politicianR to find an acceptable formula for the

 peaceful transfer of potaer tt-rough an interim ;a1Eon government.
 The statement's appeal for the people cf Saigon to join the PLAF
 in destroying the Sa:lgor~ administration and army was promptly
 endorsed in a DR'il Government statement the following day and
 echoed in propaganda which portrayed the PLAF closing in on the
 capital from every side and forecast that a total communist
 victory was at ha:-d.
 On 29 April Liberation Radio responded negatively and directly to
 the political maneuverings in Saigon, dismissing the new administra-
 tion under General Duong Van Minh as another "puppet" regime and
 ca~.ling for "offensives and uprisings'' to "end the war forever."
 This line was echoed in an article broadcast late on the 29th snd
 publi9hed on the 30th in the North Vietnamese party paper NHAN DAN
 under the authoritative byline "Commentator."  Commentator
 dismissed the Minh government as a "Thieu administration without
 Thieu"--the same epithet that had been used by the communists against
 the regime under Vice President Tran Van Huong which took over after
 Thieu's resignation on ??1 April.
 the PRG statement of the 26th represented a drastic change in line
 since the last previous major PRG statement of policy only two days
 earlier, in a government spokesman's statement on 24 April.
 Whereas the statement on the 24th had presented a virtual blueprint
 for the first steps of a political transition through a new administra-
 tion in Saigon, the 26 April statement made no mention of the
 possibility of a new interim regime and it flatly demanded the
 abolition of the "Saigon administration" and the GVN "war machine
 and machinery for coercing and oppressing the people."  It made no
 pretense at flexibility, even warning South Vietnamese "tP~ird force"
 figures--who presumably would have helped form a transition
 administration--that they must now jiin the "people" in the "struggle."
 The 24 April statement by the PRG spokesman, in contrast to the
 government statement issued two days later, not only had advocated
 formation of a new government in Saigon but had offered concrete
 guidance which seemed designed to facilitate such a move.  Apparently
 outlining the minimum concessions required of Saigon, the 24 April
 statement had specified that a new GVN administration must reject
 all U.S. aid and interference, require the withdrawal of U.S. ships
 from Sovth Vietnamese waters, abrogate "antidemocratic laws," and
 release all political prisoners.  It had also demanded the expulsion
 of U.S. "military" and "intelligence agency" personnel, leaving the
 implication that some other Americans could remain behind.

 30 APRIL 1975
 The propsgarn-ia evidence does not make it clear whether the
 communists actually intended the 24 April  statement to open the
 way for a political accommodation--albeit on their terms--or
 whether it was designed merely to further disrupt GVN ranks by
 raising false hopes that acquiescence to  communist demands might
 stave off an assault on Saigon.  An editorial in NHAN DAN on the
 27th, commenting on the previous day s PRG statement, in recalling
 that the PRG at one time had proposed the formation of the new
 Saigon government, suggested that the harsher demands on the 26th
 were necessary because of U.S.-Saigon "disregard" for tre earlier
 YRG demands.  However, there was evidence much earlier than the
 cc-mmunists were delibera~ely avoiding becoming tied to any political
 arrangement which would save Saigon from unconditional surrender.
 Since early April  tY-e Vietnamese conununist media had refrained from
 repeating the PRG's .gtandaro promise tha t it would negotiate with a
 Saigon administration willing to implement the Paris peace agree-
 ment;* the 2.~. April sta~ement had similarly stopped short of
 committing Clue communists to deal with a  new regime in Saigon which
 met its dem-ands.
 There is some media evi~ence suggesting possible disagreements among
 the Hanoi and PRG Vietnamese communists on how to manage the final
 chapter in the Vietnam war.  While the unyielding, militant 26 April
 PRG statement prompted a strong endorsement from Hanoi the following
 day in a DRV Government statement, the markedly more flexible PRG
 spokesman's statement on the 24th--at a lower level of authority--had
 elicited only low-level North Vietnamese  press and radio comment.
 The 27 April DRV Government statement was the first Hanoi statement at
 the government levsl endorsing PRG settlement terms since last October--
 a respo:tse which suggests the possibility  that Hanoi, more than the PRG,
 was pressing for a military conclusion t o the war rather than a temporary
 political accommodation with elements in  Saigon.
 The PRG's highest-level recent formulation of settlement terms prior to
 the 24 April PRG spokesman's statement was in a 21 March government
 statement that drew a DRV endorsem~~~t only at the level of DRV Foreign
 Ministry spokesman.  *tonths earlier the PRG's 8 October 1974 government
 statement, which first d~:manded at an official level thr' removal of
 Thieu as a condition for settlement, had  evoked a DRV G~~vernment state-?
 ment on 11 October in support.  It is no teworthy, however, that last
 October's, DRV statement did not specifically endorse the 8 October PRu
 statement's offer to negotiate with a Saigon government replacing Thieu.
 *  The media's dropping of the PRG offer  to negotiate with a new GVN
 administration is discussed in the TRENDS of 16 April 1975, pages 8-9.

 PRC EPJDORSED CALL FOR LIBERATION OF SOUTH VIETNAM, SCORED U.S.
 When the communists were on the verge of their final takeover in
 South Vietnam, Peking gave its Vietnamese allies some of the
 strongest public support eince the January 1973 Paris peace agree-
 ment.  On 29 April the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued its first
 statement on Vietnam in more than two years, vigorously endorsing
 the call for liberation of South Vietnam voiced in PRG and DRV
 government statements on the 26th and 27th respectively.
 Freviously, official Vietnamese statements in the post-agreement
 period had prompted only lower-level supporting comment in
 PEOPLE'S DAILY.  Three days before the release of the foreign
 ministry statement, Peking also went to unusual lengths in scoring
 the U.S. role in Indochina.  A 26 April PEOPLE'S llAILY Commentator
 article voiced the harshest authoritative Chinese criticism of
 U.S. actions in Vietnam in the past two years in seconding
 Vietnamese communist foreign ministry protests three days earlier
 against the use of "depression" bombs in the fighting at Xuan Loc.
 The PRC Foreign Ministry statement voiced the backing of the Chinese
 Government and people for the Vietnamese communist demand for a
 total end to U.S. involvement and abolition of the Saigon administra-
 tion, and it rebuked the "scheming tricks" by the United States and
 its "lackeys" as a futile effort to play for time by rigging up a
 "Thieu admi-listration without T.hieu."  The statement portrayed the
 South Vietnamese people's struggle as "entirely just," lauded their
 recent "great victories," and depicted "patriotic armymen and
 civilians" as advancing for the "total ov~:rthrow" of the Saigon
 government and the "complete liberation" of South Vietnam.
 Showing some degree of restraint toward the United States; t:~e
 26 April PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article explicitly invoked the
 name of the (;hinese people only in condemning the South Vietnamese
 Government for allegedly using "depression bombs"--CBU-55 bombs.
 While thus not eperifically directing the Chinese people's wrath at
 the United States, Commentator did voice the harshest authoritative
 criticism of the United States on a Vietnam issue since before ehe
 signing of the Paris accord.  Commentator said that Saigon's
 bombing '4aas directed by the U.S. Government," and it portrayed the
 use of such weapons of "mass murder" as consistent with past U-S.
 actions in Vietnam.  Accusing the United States of having used
 "all up-to-date arses except atomic weapons in a wild massacre of the
 Vietnamese people," it recalled the alleged U.S. use of "poisonous
 gases and bacteriological weapons" against the Korertn and Chinese
 peop~..~ during the Korean war--the first resurrection in ten years
 in autt~orita.tive media of this sensitive PRC charge.  The article
 juxtaposed its charges against the United States with ~ reference to
 Hitler's use of poisonous gases and chemical weapons.

 CAMBODIA
 SPECIAL CONGk'ESS CONFIRMS SIHAIWUK'S TITLE, NOTES POLICIES
 A "Special National Congress" of Cambodia, held a week after the
 fall of Phnom Penh, confirmE3 Prince Sihanouk as chief of state
 and head of the Cambodian Front (NUFC) and Penn Nouth as govern-
 ment (RGNU) prime minister and chairman of the NUFC Central
 Committee.  According to NCNA, both leaders were still in
 Peking, Sihanouk remaining with his mother, who died on 27 April
 after a lengthy illness.  There was no indication wP.~re in
 Cambodia the 25-27 April congress was held.  It was chaired by
 R(~i~U Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan, who also read the
 28 April press communique on the congress in a broadcast by
 Phnom '?enh radio.
 The congress communique went further than pronouncements on
 Front congresses this past February and in 1973 in making a
 point of personally praising Sihanouk and Penn Nouth.  The
 current communique called Sihanouk a "great high-rar_king
 patriotic personality" and Penn Nouth a "high-ranking patriotic
 personality," and it said that both had "activel:~~ contributed"
 to the Front's past struggle.  By contrast, the single reference
 to Sihanouk and Penn Nouth in the 26 February 1975 communique
 on the second Front congress had noted their positions bu~ not
 lauded their contribution.*  The 21 July 1973 statement on the
 first congress had referred to Sihanouk and Penn Nouth in their
 respective roles several times but had offered no special accolades.
 "PEOPLE?S" ROLE,         Evidently in an effort to demonstrate the
 NEUTRALITY POLICY        existence of a broad base of popular
 Cambodian support, the communique put
 unusual stress on the important role now being played by the
 Cambodian "people" and their "mass organizations," rather than
 the NUFC and RGNU.  Thus, unlike the pronouncements of past
 congresses, the current communique gave top billing to "people's
 organizations," ahead of the NUFC and RGNU, and stressed the "will
 of the people" as a source of legitimacy fox current policies.

 TRENDS of  5 riarch 1975,  pages  1-2.

 The communique also asserted that the new regime would strive
 for economic equality---"without rich or poor, without oppressing
 and oppressed classes"-'an  elaboration upon pledges by past
 congresses of ample support for all.
 The congress communique reiterated Cambodian adherence to a
 policy of neutrality and voiced an injunction prohibiting "any
 country from establishing military bases in Cambodia"--a slight
 variation on the February 1975 congress prohibition against
 foreign military bases "for aggression."  The current communique
 expressed opposition to "all forms" of foreign interference,
 and it elaborated on past expressions of willingness to accept
 unconditional aid by stressing that "subversion and aggression"
 under the cloak of "so--called humanitarianism" would not be
 tolerated.  Unlike the pronouncements of past congresses, the
 present communique did not criticize the U.S. Administration by
 name, although it did attack "U.S. imperialism."
 PEKING          Following the jubilant Chinese celebration of the

 mother, Queen Sisowath Kossamak, and tiie return of a delegation
 of Chinese journalists from a visit to the Cambodian "liberated

 A 28 April message of condolences on the queen's death, signed by
 NPC chairman Chu Te and Premier Chou En-tai, expressed hope that
 Sihanouk would "translate sorrow into strength" for the work of
 Cambodian recunstruction.  Also on 28 April Sihanouk received
 high-level Chinese mourners led by Vice Precaiers Teng Hsiao-ping
 and Chen Hsi-lien, paying their respects at his Peking residence.
 The callers also included Teng Ying-chao, wife of Chou En-tai, who
 had visited the queen before her death, according to NCNA.  Wreaths
 were presented in the in the name of Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-tai,
 Teng Hsiao-ping, Chiang Ching, and Teng Ying-chao, and flags were
 flown at half mast at Tienanmen and other ufficial sites.

 greeted at a reception on 23 April given by CCP Politburo members
 Yac+ Wen-yuan and Chi Teng-kuei.  According to a 22 April NCNA
 dispatch, the delegation had "a very cordial and friendly conver-
 sation" with Khi,pu Samphan, and was honored at a Front
 banquet hosted by RGNU Interior Minister Hou Yuun and Propaganda
 Minister Hu Nim during its travels in the Front-controlled areas.
 Two NCNA correspondent reports filed by the delegation on 24 and
 28 4~pri1 strongly reflected themes heavily stressed in Peking's
 comment on Cambodia since the fall of Phnom Penh--the exemplary
 fashion in which the Front has employed people's war strategy
 and tactics on its road to victory, and the "close unity and
 increasingly strengthened and developing militant solidarity"
 between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples.  The first report
 described frontline heroics by the Front's forces surrounding
 Phnom Penh ~n the "eve" of that city's fall and recounted the
 delegation's reception by the "cordial and frank" Son Sen,
 "commander" of the Phnom Penh front.  The second described
 incidents madifesting Cambodian goodwill toward the delegation
 and reverence for Chairman Mao, and the delegation's reception
 by Khieu Samphan and the banquet held in its honor by Hou Youn
 and Hu Nim.
 Frc+nt comment on the Chinese visit was restricted to a brief

 KIM IL-SONG PRC VISIT COMhUNIQUE STRESSES UNITY OF VIEWS
 The PRC-DPRK communique on Kim I1-song's 18-26 April visit to China
 stressed the complete agreement of both sides on "all questions
 discussed" and said the visit was "crowned with complete success."
 The communique, carried by both NCNA and KCNA on 28 April, generally
 did not deviate from well-established North Korean and Chinese
 policy lines already reiterated in banquet speeches on 18 and 25
 April.*  The communique took note of the "inspiring" developments
 in Indochina, but did not link events there with the 'situation
 in Korea.  While the communique stated a "demand" that the United
 States immediately stop "aggression and interference" in Indochina,
 it did not specifically describe events there as a U.S. defeat.
 The communique noted Kim's meeting with :iao Tae-tung and Chou
 En-lai, as well as the KWP de'legation's various naeetings with
 former members of the Chinese People's Volunteers who had fought
 alongside the "Korean people" during the war.  Saying PRC-DPRK unity
 had been "cemented with blood" in protracted struggle against
 unnamed "common enemies," the communique promised China and Korea
 would unite "in the common struggle against imperialism and in
 the cause of socialist revolution."
 In their section of the communique the Chinese referred to the DPRK
 as the "Hole legal sovereign state of the Korean nation."  The
 North Koreans have long made such a claim for themselves and have
 pushed this theme more fregaaently in the past several months,
 but Peking has not recently offered high-level support on this
 claim.  A 22 :iay 1973 PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article comment-
 ing on North Korea's adanission to the World Health Organization
 came to close to doing so, calling the DPRK "the true representa-
 tive of the Korean people."  Peking's strong formulation in the
 communique could be construed as an indirect answer to a U.S.
 proposal, Yirst explicitly advanced in public last November by
 Assistant Secretary of State Habib, that contacts between t:te
 United States and North Korea depended on reciprocal steps ~y
 the USSR and PRC towards the South.  Pyongyang had rejected
 this proposal last December.**

 30 APRIL 1975
 The Chinese reiterated support for the "peaceful" reunification
 of Korea and singled out--as had Teng Hsiao-pittg's 18 April
 speech--Kim I1-song's three principles and five-point proposal as
 the "correct way" for reunification.  Like Teng's speech, the
 communique condemned the "Pak Chong-hui clique .supported
 and instigated by iJ.S. imperialism."  Going beyond Teng's speech,
 the communique offered strong--but not unprecedented--support
 "for the South Korean people of all strata in their ~uat struggle
 for the democratization of society and the independent and
 peaceful reunification of the fatherland."  In a 23 October 1974
 banquet speech in Peking for a DPRK trade delegation, Chang
 Shih-Chung, alternate member of the CCP Central Committee, had
 said: "The Chinese workers and people .resolutely support
 the people in South Korea in their heroic struggle against the
 fascist rule of the Pak Chong-hui clique."  Similarly, a
 PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article on 17 December 1973 had voiced
 "resolute support" for the "brave South Korean students and other
 people .in their dust struggle."
 In the communique the Chinese condemned "U.S. imperialism" for
 "attempting to perpetuate the division of Korea" and called
 for the dissolution of the UN Command and the withdrawal of
 U.S. troops from the South, but they did not attach any time
 frame to the demand.  This was the only reference to the UN
 question in any Chinese or Korean comment during the visit.
 The Korean section of the communique was brief, containing
 standard praise of Chinese domestic political developments and
 offering support for the "liberation" of 'iaiwan.
 There was no reference in the communique to Chinese economic
 or military aid to North Korea, although economic and military
 advisers were present for discussions during the visit.  When
 Kim and his party left Peking on 22 April for a two day ~iisit
 to Nanking, the North Korean ministers of finance and of external
 economic affairs remained in Peking.
 In apparent anticipation of the communique, banquet speeches by
 Kim and Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping on the 25th
 contained little of substance, being devoted almost exclusively
 to extolling Chinese-Korean unity and to advertising the
 identity of views between Peking and Pyongyang.  Teng referred
 in his speech to the "complete identity " of views "on the
 international situation, including the situation on the Korean
 peninsula."  Kim cited "present developments in Asia" as proving
 that "no force can check" the "downfal 1 of the imperialists
 and their lackeysy" brit he did not directly link recent events
 to the Korean situation.

 CHINESE GOVERNMENT STATEMENT BACKS S I KKI M PEOPLES ~~STRIJGGLE~~
 A 29 April PRC Government statement strongly re~ect.s India's recent
 "illegal annexation" of Sikkim, pledges Chl,na's "firm support" to
 the "people of Sikkim" In their "dust struggle" against Indian
 "expansionism," anal links the Indian move to Soviet influence.  The
 highly authoritative PRC Government statement, the first such by
 Peking on an international issue in more than a ye~.~r, goes well
 beyond earlier official Peking criticism in sharpness of tone and
 pe~oratives.  It is Peking's most authoritative criticism of
 India since the Indo-Pakistani war crisis in late 1971.
 Th>~ latest PRC s~atement contains elements not found ire an 11 September
 197+ PRC Foreign Ministry statement condemning Indian moves to control
 Siklcim, while omitting some of the earlier charges.  The new statement
 declares that China "absolutely does not recognize India's illegal
 annexation," and it accuses New Delhi of indulging in the "fond dream
 of a great Indian empire" and sub;j~ecting  its neighbors  to 20 years of
 "control, interference, subversion and bullying."  The current statement
 omits criticism of India's nuclear power development plans that was
 contained in the September 1974 foreign ministry statement, as well as
 the earlier statement's personal reference to Indira Gani;hi.
 The new statement accuses- India of having "outdone old-line coloni~~lism"
 by its actions in Sikkim, warns that New Delhi wants "to play the
 supreme lord in South Asia," and charges that India's "expansionist
 ambitions" in this regard have "swelled" in recent years.  In this
 connection, it recalls India's 1971 "dis-nemberment" of Pakistan and
 its February 1975 decision incorporating Indian-occupied Kafhmir into
 the Indian union. Playing up the role of the Soviet Union au the
 "behind-th% scenes boss" of Indian expansionism, the statement charges
 that i`ioscow is the "main threat" to South Asian independence snd the
 "most dangerous enemy"  of the people there.
 In regard to the situation in Sikkim, the statement repeated the 1974
 foreign ministry statement's condemnation by the "ChinESe Government
 and people" of India's actions and pledged not to recognize Sikkim's
 new status.  T.n addition, it firmly rebuked the current poF~erholders
 in Gangtok as "Sikkimese traitors" and offered repeated promises
 of "firm" Chinese backing for the "struggle" of the Chogyal and the
 Sikkim people.  The 1974 statement had not referred to the Gangtok
 authorities, and it had offered only a single pledge of generalized
 Chinese support for Sikkimese resistance.  Peking this time also

 added a warning that New Delhi's present moves "sound an alarm" for
 India's other neighbors, calling on these states to condemn both
 India and the USSR, and expressing confidence in their determination
 ~o strengthen unity and .preserve their independence.
 Only a few days earlier PRC Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien had heralded
 a firm Chinese line against Indian expansion in his remarks during
 his 20-25 April visit to Pakistan.  In a speech at Che strategic city
 of Lahore along the Indian border on 23 April, for instance, Li
 responded to his Pakistani host's praise of Chinese support during
 Pakistan's wars against India in 1965 and 1971 with pointed criticism
 of India's designs in Sikkim and elsewhere in South Asia.  Li made
 a uroad pledge of Chinese support for "the mouth Asian peoples"
 against New Delhi and Moscow and reiterated China's commitment to
 Pakistan's defense.
 PHILIPPINE CP RATIONALIZES PEKING-MANILA CONTACTS
 An October 1974 statement by the Philippine Communist Party (PCP)
 Central Committee seeking to rationalize Peking's dealing with the
 incumbent Philippine administration of President 'iarcos as being
 consistent wish continued Peking support for the Philippine revolution
 was recently publicized by a communist-con rolled clandestine radio.
 The PCP statement of 15 October, written in response to the late
 September visit to China by Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos and
 in anticipation of diplomatic relations being established between
 Peking and rian~la, was serially broadcast for the first known time
 on 17, 19 and 22 April by  he China-based Voice of the Malayan
 Revolution (VOPiR) radio.*  The statement stresses benefits expected
 for the national liberation movement from better Peking-Manila
 relations, claims that increased trade between the two countries
 will weaken "traditional U.S. control and influence" over the
 Philippines, and predicts that the development of educational and
 cultural exchanges will allow Filipinos to gain "a true picture" of
 the Chinese revolution,  thereby fueling their own struggle.
 The statement acknowledged that the PRC-Philippine rapprochement has
 caused uneasiness in the revolutionary ranks, but called "totally
 unfounded" fears that Peking might withdraw its support for the
 Philippines struggle in its eagerness to establish diplomatic relations
 with Manila.  However, it warned that "revolution cannot be imported"
 *  VOMR, which in the past has often carried propaganda directed toward
 Peking-supported insurgencies outside of Malaysia, has not broadcast
 PCP statements or material dealing with the Philippines struggle since
 December 1973.

 with the establishment of PItC ties and that such ties "ennnot
 take the place of the Philippine revolution." which must b e
 carried out "according to Philippine conditions."
 The statement dismissed as "revisionist renegades" those who
 accused the PCP of self-contradiction for. advocating relations
 with Peking but not with Moscow.
 BACKGROUND        The I'hilippinc CP statement is the latest in a
 series of similar atutements by Chinese-eupp orted
 communist parties in Southeast Aaia concerning normnlizntion of
 relations between Peking and the governments which tlieao movements
 oppose.  In no case leas the reaua,ption of diplomatic relations
 ended insurgent party opposition.  For example, following Ne Win's
 trip to Peking normalizing relations in August 1971, the Ilurmesc
 Communist Party in a statement broadcast by the PRC-based Voice
 of the People of Burma denounced Ne Win's government for thinking
 that improved ties with Peking would solve pressing economic and
 political difficulties.  Similarly in Mny 1974, following the
 establishment of PRC-Plulaysian relationa~ the VOMR radio liniled the
 establishment of relations as marking the "bankruptcy" of the
 Rezak government's hostility toward China while accusing Ra zak of
 resorting to "doubledealing tactics" to solve political and
 economic crises.  Recent broadcasts by the Voice of the People of
 Thailand (VOPT). also a PRC-based clandestine radi.o~ have c haracterired
 steps by Bangkok toward catablisl~ment of relations with Peking as being
 takRn only in response to persistent popular pressure.*

 conununiquc's referenre to Syria's military forces and its
 implication of continued Soviet assistance stand in marked
 contrast to the absence of such refr_renccs in the Soviet-
 Egyptian r.ommunique .last week on Fahmi's vial.
 I~urtl~er underr~coring Moscow's intn_rest in  Syrian military mutters,
 tl~c chief of  the Soviet General Staff , Army General V.  Kulikov,
 visited Syria from 22-25 April, virtually simultaneously with
 Kl~addrun's visi.C  to Moscow.**        A conununique on Kulikov's visit,
 carried by 'fAS5 on the 26th, stated that he met with President
 al-Arend and tlic Syrian defense minister and that talks were
 Held on "issues pertaining to military cooperation."  In
 language similar to the communique on Khaddam's visit, it also
 reaffirmed Muscow's policy of "all-round aid and support" to
 the Arabs and expressed the sides' intention to expand contacts
 between their armed forces.
 *   The original version of this phrase, as it first appeared in
 the communique on Egyptian President as-Sadat's April 1972 visit to
 tioscow, acknowledged the Arabs' right to use "other means" to regain
 their occupied territories.  See the FSIS TRENDS of 3 May 1972,
 pages 31-34.     Subsequently,  ~?Ioscow commentators varied ti~is phrase,
 using "different means" and "all means," among others.  The phrase
 has not appeared frequently in recent years.
 **  Kulikov's last trip to the Middy  East was a 27 November 1974
 visit to Lraq.  Prior to that, he had visited Turkey in April 1972.

 WESTERN  ECOPJ.OMI C  CRI S I S
 MOSC04J STRESSES CAPITALIST WORLD TROUBLES. AVOIDS PREDICTIONS
 A stre.~_m of Soviet comment and reportage, mostly low-level, on
 Western economic troubles over the past year has conveyed a
 picture of growing crisis in the capitalist world, accompanied
 by heightened tensions among Western states and between governments
 and peoples.  This portrayal is~c'learly inconsistent with anther
 picture which Moscow paints--that of a blossoming oi~ trade and
 economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western states
 based on the continued dev~~lopment of detente.  The latter is
 still the dominant image ~.~ the Soviet propaganda montage, but
 whether it remains so is clearly a question that may provide an
 index of Soviet leadership attitudes in the run-up to the CPSU's
 25th party congress.
 WESTERN ECONOMIC        The latest high-level assessment of Westerr.
 CRISIS                  economic troubles was provided by Suslov in
 his Lenin anniversary address on 22 April.
 He drew the Western economic crisis in very dark colors, comparing
 it with the depression of the 193U's and contrasting it with the
 prosperity allegedly being enjoyed by the socialist countries.
 Nevertheless, while identifying the Western crisis as a fur*_her
 stage in the general crisis of world capitalism, he refrained from
 predicting a collapse of the capitalist system or any defi~iite
 change from Qxiating conditions.  Indeed, Suslov's praise o~`
 Brezhnev's foreign policy line, and his commitment to the "rstrength-
 ening and deepening of detente" seemed to imply a belief that the
 West is far from being in its final agony.
 TRADE PROSPECTS        A complementary picture o# the Western economic
 situation was provided by A. Mileykovskiy in
 an article in PRAVDA on 26 April.  Also comparing the present crisis
 with the depression of the 1930's, Mileykovskiy argued that the
 situation was even worse now, because all capitalist countries were
 suffering the same symptoms at the same time.  But he nevertheless
 stressed an optimistic note by suggesting that there were ways to
 mitigate the crisis and restore some measure of stability to the
 Western economies.  His ideas were first, curbing the arms race,
 and secondly, trade with the socialist countries, whose economies
 were stable and vigorous.  Seemingly aware that his prescriptions
 could be criticized for a lack of ideological purity, he pointed
 out that the restoration of economic health in the West could go
 hand in hand with political and social changes in the capitalist
 countries.

 CONFIDENTIAL           FBIS TRENDS
 30 APRIL 1975
 Mileykovskiy's article 3.s consistent with a main line of Soviet
 comment in recenC months that has apparently been aimed at pro~ec tang
 a "reasonable" attitude on the trade issue.  Economist Shershnev,
 deputy director of the USA Institute, in a talk broadcast to North
 America on 15 April, for example, directly contested the notion
 that the Soviet Union took pleasure from the troubles of the Gest.
 Quite to the contrary, he asserted, the Soviet Union wants Co
 develop trade, providing the United States does not think that
 by trading with the Soviet Union it is doing the latter a favor.
 Still earlier, Soviet Foreign Trade Minister N. Patolichev
 made an even stronger pitch for trade with the~United States is s
 PRAVDA article on 9 April.  While acknowl.f~lgittg that the socialis t
 states cotild not directly aim at "curing" Western economic ills,
 he nevertheless pointed out that this would be the undoubted
 effect of increased East-West trade, one which the socialist
 states could justify by the fact that it would "ease the burdens"
 on the working people.

 PORTUGAL
 USSR CALLS ELECTIONS SUCCESSFUL, RATIOin~ALIZES POOR PCP RESULTS
 Moscow's immediate reaction to Portugal's 25 April constituent
 assembly elections has been in effect to call them a success
 because they took place in "calm and good order" despite alleged
 efforts by Western media to conjure up a scene of internal
 violence and anarchy.  Soviet media have depicted the elections,
 held on the first anniversary of the 1974 coup, as an endorsement
 by the Portuguese people of the developments over the past year
 under the leadership of the Armed rorces Movement, in alliance
 with the "progressive" political forces.
 But Moscow has found i[ difficult to explain objectively the poor
 showing of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP).*  While candidly
 acknowledging the election figures, it has sought to rationalize
 the low vote for the PCP, attributing this to the influence of
 alleged internal and external "reactionary" pressures on the
 supposedly still politically naive Portuguese electorate.  This
 same argument had been a dominant theme in both the PCP election
 campaign and in Moscow preelection comment.  Brushing aside the
 real PCP standing among the Portuguese people, Soviet commentators
 have generally stressed that the results were a victory for the
 unspecified government "coalition" parties, thus implicitly including
 the PCP among the victors.
 Moscow has echoed statements cf confidence by PCP leader Cunhal
 playing down the significance of the election results and their
 future implications.  Several commentaries--including TASS' first
 general assessment of the elections in a dispatch from Lisbon on
 the 27th, and a 30 April IZVESTIYA article--cited Cunhal's post-
 election assertion that it would be wrong to assume that the election
 results were "the only indicator of the power and influence of
 political parties."  The voting, Cunhal said, "did not fully reflect
 the strength of'the communist party, its influence, its ability to
 mobilize the masses, and its role iii the Portuguese revolution."
 *  The "final" results for the five mayor parties, as announced by
 Lisbon radio on 2~{ April, were as follows:  Portuguese Socialist
 Party (PS), 38 pe~ccent; left of center Popular Democratic Party (PPD)
 26 percent; Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), 13 percent; right of
 center Social Democratic Center Party (GDS), 8 percent; and the
 PCP-allied Portuguese Democratic Movement (MDP-CDE), 4 percent.

 3Q AI'itii,  19; 5
 Similarly, Moscow has pointed out that the election rer+u .ltr+ woulcl
 not affect the composition of the presenC provir+iona]. government
 nor its policies,  implying that  the  I'Ci' and  the  i'ortupuese
 Democr~ntic Movement would not have. to surrender some representarton
 in the cabinet to the Socialist~~nnd the Popular Uemocrnts to rr.flect
 the election proportions.  I'ItAVUA'a Lisbon correspondent V. Yermakov
 said on the 29th, for example, that although the rcuults will be
 analyzed for a long time, "it is quite clear" thr+t the cabineC wfl].
 be "basically the same as before."  In contras+t to this relatively
 optimistic view of the PCP's future role in I'ortupuese political
 life, IZVESTI'`:A's political observer V. Mntveyev, participating in
 the 27 April Moscow radio weekly roundtable, offered u convoluted
 explanation of--if not an excuse for--the I'CI''u poor election
 results.
 CALL FOR UNITED LEFT      Although Soviet comment has generally
 sought to link the PCI' ns closely ae
 possible to the Armed Forces Movement and its policies, Moscow at
 the same time has been implicitly advising the PCP to cooperate
 with other major leftist parties.  Moscow thus seems again to be
 drawing attention to the necessity for maintaining cooperative.
 relationships among the left; the PEtAVDA editorial article of
 21 February on Portugal had explicitly admonished the I'CI' on this
 point.*  Such suggestions now, in view of the disappointing election
 results, might reflect Soviet uncertainty over the future of the
 PCP's relationship with and influence over the movement and
 individual Povement lenders.
 While citing Cunhal's assertion that PCP cooperation with the F;c3vemt:nt
 would continue as before, Soviet comment has emphasized a parallel
 theme, in effect calling for cooperation among the PCI', the Socialists,
 and even the Popular Democrats, to continue the Portuguese revolution
 in alliance with the Movement.  The TASS dispatch of the 27th tend a
 radio commentary on the 28th by one of Moscow's main communist and
 European affairs commentators, Yuriy Shalygin, cited Cunhal as saving
 that the PCP "always believed it desirable" for the Socialist Party
 to join together with the PCP and "other democratic forces in building
 a new Portugal."  Both TASS and Shalygin went on to report Socialist
 leader Soares as saying in effect that the Socailists wanted to
 cooperate with the PCP and the Popular Democrats.  toscow's inclusion
 of Soares' reference to the Popular Democrats is notable in that
 Cunhal, following the abortive 11 March coup, had labeled this party
 as "fascist" and demanded that it be ousted from the government.
