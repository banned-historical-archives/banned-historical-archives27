 PORTUGAL: HANGING ON
 Efforts to break Prime Minister Goncalves'
 tenacious grip on power seem to have lost some
 momentum this week. Goncalves appears to have
 bought some time by threatening to bring his
 Communist supporters into the streets if he is
 removed-an action which could result in civil
 war. The deadline of August 26 that Goncalves'
 opponents had set for his removal passed with
 him still in office. A few days later, however, there
 again were reports that he might be ousted at any'
 moment.
 The anti-Goncalves forces, which had
 gathered support for a relentless drive to oust the
 Prime Minister and reduce the growing Com-
 munist influence, appear to have been sidetrack-
 ed by President Costa Gomes' vacillation and fear
 that Goncalves would make good on his threat to
 provoke civil war. On August 25, representatives
 of the original nine dissident Revolutionary
 Council members led by former foreign minister
 Melo Antunes met with the ruling three-man
 directorate, and a compromise seemed in the
 making.                              25X1
 The Revolutionary Council issued a com-
 munique the same day announcing three
 decisions that seemed to contain something for
 each faction. General Corvacho, generally con-
 sidered sympathetic to the Communists, was
 reinstated as commander of the northern military
 region, after having been suspended the week
 before. At the same time, the operations of
 pro-Communist propaganda division of the arm-
 ed forces general staff were suspended, pending
 an investigation, and it was announced that the
 armed forces general assembly would meet next
 week.
 Rumors of a compromise took on added
 significance when it was learned on August 26
 that army chief of staff Fabiao, designated by the
 Antunes group to take over as prime minister, had
 abandoned his efforts to form a new government.
 Speculation then focused on Admiral Azevedo,
 navy chief of staff, as a possible successor.
 Azevedo might be acceptable to many of Gon-
 calves' supporters in the military, but because of
 his leftist credentials the admiral would probabiy25X1
 be rejected by the Antunes group.

 on offices of the military's propaganda division,
 which had defied orders to close down. The move
 was viewed by some as a show of force by the an-
 ti-Goncalves faction, whose fortunes had seemed
 to be slipping. This claim may have been made
 after the fact, however, to buck up the morale of
 units who saw their chance of reversing the Com-
 munist tide slipping away while their leaders
 bargained in Lisbon and accepted one stall after
 another.
 The Communists, seeing a chance to retain
 Goncalves, took the offensive by organizing a
 united front of extreme leftist parties and
 revolutionary groups and promising a series of
 pro-Goncalves rallies throughout the nation. The
 first of these rallies was held on the evening of
 August 27, just as another round of emergency
 meetings of top military officers was about to get
 under way. With the apparent intention of in-
 timidating President Costa Gomes, who holds the
 ITALY: ARMY REORGANIZATION   44 ..
 The Italian army is beginning to reorganize its
 ground forces. Faced with a tight budget, the
 army has chosen to maintain expenditures for
 equipment and reduce those for personnel.
 The present 36 brigades are to be reduced by
 one third, and the oldest third of artillery pieces
 and tanks phased out. The remaining equipment
 will be modernized over a 10- to 12-year period.
 Military officials hope the changes will result in a
 smaller, less expensive army that is more mobile
 and better prepared. The new army reportedly
 will be made up of 3 corps commands, 4
 mechanized and armored divisions, and 12 in-
 dependent brigades with tactical and logistic sup-
 port. The reorganization will probably not be in
 full swing for several months, and may take years
 to complete.
 Modernization plans call for a greater
 number of armored personnel carriers. Motor
 transport will be increased, over half of the
 remaining artillery and tanks will be replaced or
 re-equipped, and the number of anti-tank
 weapons will jump from about 2,000 to 3,000.
 key to the situation by virtue of his authority to
 dismiss  the  prime  minister,  some  35,000
 demonstrators cheered Goncalves but roundly
 booed the President when he took the platform.
 Underlining the growing chasm between
 Lisbon, the center of Communist strength, and
 most of the rest of the nation, the Socialist Party
 organized a rally of some 50,000 persons in the
 northern city of Porto on the 27th to demand
 Goncalves' removal and to protest the reinstate-
 ment of General Corvacho as regional com-
 mander. One member of the Antunes group had
 earlier predicted the possibility of civil war,
 regardless of the outcome of the current struggle
 for power. The growing anti-Communist violence
 in the north and the apparent determination of
 the Communists in Lisbon make that seem in
 creasingly likely.
 Over the past year, Italian army strength has
 dropped from 311,000 to about 225,000 men. The
 army believes that reducing the number of units
 will allow for more efficient use of the smaller
 number of troops. Economies from the reduction
 in personnel will probably be lost to inflation,
 however, and recent unrest among enlisted per-
 sonnel will probably require that the armed
 forces allocate more funds to improve living con-
 ditions for enlisted men and noncommissioned
 officers. Military service chiefs have already
 dipped  into existing equipment-procurement
 funds to give enlisted men a one-time cost-
 of-living   payment.   The   Defense  Ministry
 reportedly looked the other way.
 The army has asked parliament for about $1
 billion over a ten-year period to provide ad-
 ditional funds to support the new army. Earlier
 this year, parliament approved similar legislation
 for the navy, and chances are good that special
 procurement legislation    posed by the air force
 ro
 will also be passed.

 laborers to work their farms. Claiming that the
 pieds noirs now own most of the land in Cor-
 sica, autonomists demand that all land being
 farmed by "foreigners" be returned to Corsican
 control.
 Another major grievance is the alleged lack
 of  responsiveness  by  the highly centralized
 French government. Corsicans resent the island's
 lagging industrial development and what they
 consider to be the lack of a social action pro-
 gram tailored to Corsican needs. Advocates of
 autonomy accuse Paris of running Corsica like a
 colony and of being interested only in the is-
 land's development as a tourist area.
 Tension has remained high on the island
 since the shoot-out last week. ARC members
 have attacked businesses owned by pieds noirs
 and "mainlanders" and clashed with police. Yes-
 terday one policemen was killed and 13 were
 injured by demonstrators protesting the govern-
 ment's decision to ban the ARC movement. The
 proscribing of the autonomist group and arrest
 of its leader and ten of its top members have led
 to predictions of further serious incidents unless
 Paris backs down and makes important conces-
 sions. According to press reports, the pieds noirs
 fear a civil war may be immanent. The incidents
 of the past week have, in any case, given the
 Corsican drive for autonomy a momentum that
 may force Paris to come to grips with the  rob-
 lem.
 The Polish regime is showing increasing
 sensitivity and even some uncertainty over how
 the population might react to domestic and
 international events. Warsaw's uneasiness may in
 part be because most top-level officials are on
 vacation and the second team is minding the
 store. It could also reflect genuine concern that
 the regime may have trouble controlling public
 reactions.
 For example, the media managed for more
 than two weeks to delay disclosing the details of
 agreements reached between party chief Gierek
 and West German Chancellor Schmidt in Hel-
 sinki. Polish officials at first claimed that the
 silence was intended to help the ratification
 process in Bonn, but their reticence also suggests
 concern about domestic criticism of the agree-
 ments and a desire to prevent an immediate
 flood of applications for emigration by Poland's
 ethnic Germans.
 When the press finally did dribble out the
 details, it seemed to distort the contents of the
 accord in order to give the impression that fur-
 ther Polish demands might be forthcoming. A
 Foreign  Ministry  official  subsequently  dis-
 avowed this interpretation, however, blaming it
 on a lack of press guidance because so many
 officials were out of town.
 The media have also echoed Gierek's de-
 fensiveness about the decisions on humanitarian
 issues at CSCE. In fact, the full text of the
 Helsinki agreement has not been  published.
 Those excerpts that have been carried have care-
 fully juxtaposed stipulations on sovereignty and
 noninterference  with  the  passages  on  freer
 exchanges. The Polish leadership, like other East
 European regimes, is no doubt worried that its
 citizens may expect more from the freer ex-
 change provisions than it is prepared to grant.
 Warsaw is also keeping a close watch on
 popular  reaction  to  its  domestic  economic
 policies. In an effort to overcome continuing
 shortages of meat and milk-and to quiet in-
 creased  popular  grousing                                                                                        about  them-the
 regime announced on August 11 that prices paid
 to producers would be increased. The regime
 evidently felt that it was still politically unwise
 to raise long-frozen consumer prices on these
 and other food items; this week the government
 announced instead that retail prices for tobacco
 would be raised, in some cases as much as 70
 percent. Public reaction to this price hike will be
 watched  carefully,  since economic necessity
 may force increases on other nonessential com-

 Economic and finance ministers of the EC
 Nine, joined by central bank governors, met in
 Venice last weekend to discuss what their gov-
 ernments should do to combat persisting eco-
 nomic  recession  and  its                 consequences  for
 employment within the community. Another
 purpose was to approve a package that would
 permit some progress on international monetary
 reform at next week's IMF meetings in Washing-
 ton, yet avoid a US-French standoff on Paris'
 desire to return to fixed exchange rates. An
 open confrontation on flexible as opposed to
 fixed parities would embarrass the community,
 because France's partners are not anxious for an
 early end to floating currencies.
 France has shifted its tactics somewhat in
 no longer holding up agreement on IMF quota
 revisions and the role of gold in a future interna-
 tional payments system as hostage to an accord
 on how flexible the relations between national
 currencies, or currency blocs, should be. Paris
 still intends to push for a return to exchange-
 rate "stability"-and is now even invoking the
 argument that monetary "uncertainty" plays
 into communist hands-but may hope to elevate
 the question to the highest political levels by
 making it the centerpiece of a summit of the
 "Big Five" free-world industrial countries that
 the French want later this year. This meeting
 may itself be in doubt, however, since the
 smaller members are objecting vociferously, and
 the US and Japan are far from enthusiastic.
 The package which the EC ministers agreed
 to in Venice would:
 ? Allow central banks to make settle-
 ments in gold and engage in gold transac-
 tions on the open market, subject to the
 provision that central bank gold stocks not
 increase over the initial two-year period.
 ? Have the IMF return one sixth of its
 gold to members and sell another sixth, with
 the profits going to benefit the developing
 countries. (Some ministers, presumably in-
 cluding the French, want the money to be
 used  to support commodity agreements,
 while others favor direct aid.)
 ? Have the IMF quota of the US reduced
 to below 20 percent, but increase the qual-
 ified majority vote on important issues to 85
 percent, thereby allowing the US to retain
 its veto power.

 have to be redistributed in order to reflect the
 growth of the oil countries' monetary reserves.
 Apart from the question of what effect this will
 have on US voting strength, the EC is also faced
 with reallocating quotas among its members.
 They hope to resolve this problem before the
 IMF meetings begin.
 On overcoming recession, the EC countries,
 led by Germany and France, continue to stress
 the importance of reflationary measures by the
 US and Japan. The Europeans nevertheless seem
 to be attaching growing importance to the need
 for improved coordination of efforts within the
 community; one country's stimulative program
 could be largely negated by the lack of com-
 plementary measures by its EC partners-with
 whom most of its trade is conducted.
 In Venice the ministers pledged their coun-
 tries to coordinated action, but there is little
 evidence of any central direction despite EC
 Commission  recommendations,  let  alone  a
 planned recovery program at the community
 level. German Chancellor Schmidt is in fact
 giving the major impetus to policy coordination,
 especially among the members of the joint float
 of EC currencies-in which Britain, Italy, and
 Ireland do not participate.
 Italy's  own  ambitious  recovery  plans,
 thought by many economic observers to risk
 setting off a new inflationary spiral, already
 overstep Commission suggestions. The measures
 signaled this week by Germany and France,
 meanwhile, are probably inadequate, and there
 is nothing yet to indicate that the Venice session
 increased or redirected their efforts.

 In a remarkable display of organizational
 skill, communist cadre on August 23 turned out
 more  than 100,000  people  for  their long-
 planned mass rally in Vientiane to formally end
 the city's joint administration, established under
 the 1973 peace accords. The event marked the
 completion of the communist take-over of the
 country's local governing authorities, and with it
 the communists have completed the destruction
 of most non-communist institutions.
 The Royal Lao army has been disarmed
 and integrated into a national army led by the
 Pathet Lao. Those military officers and civil
 servants who did  not flee the country are
 thoroughly cowed, and many have been moved
 deep into the hinterlands for lengthy, humil-
 iating re-education sessions. There is no evidence
 that any have been executed, but many Lao
 believe that the participants will never return to
 Vientiane.
 Communist officials and sympathizers in
 control of local governments throughout Laos
 have been steadily tightening control over the
 people by restricting travel, establishing people's
 militia units, and requiring attendance at daily
 political indoctrination sessions. No significant
 active resistance to these efforts has been re-
 ported.
 The communists thus far have been careful
 not to formally alter the coalition status of the
 national government established under the 1973
 accords  and  personified  by  Prime  Minister
 Souvanna. Communist acting deputy prime min-
 ister Phoune Sipraseuth seemed to go out of his
 way in his speech at the rally to emphasize that
 the PGNU and the Joint National       Political
 Council, which sets policy guidelines, remain the
 "supreme administrations." Phao Phimmachan,
 a senior communist leader who has taken con-
 trol of the Vientiane area administration, also
 pledged support for the PGNU and Souvanna_
 Such  forbearance  should  not be exag-
 gerated, since the Pathet Lao have the organs of
 the  national government firmly under their
 thumb. The real question is how long the com-
 munists will see political advantage in retaining
 the facade of coalition, and how much longer
 Souvanna and  the remaining non-communist
 political figures will be willing to play their
 increasingly insignificant roles in a "coalition"
 now totally weighted in Pathet Lao favor.
 Anti-American  statements  during  the
 speeches were surprisingly subdued, and there
 were no marches on  the embassy or other
 actions against US or foreign residents. In an
 effort to tighten security and guarantee attend-
 ance, the communists had closed the airport and
 the  Mekong  River border, limited vehicular
 traffic on most city streets and closed stores,
 restaurants, and offices.
 J he acceptance of North Korea's applica-
 tion for membership in the Conference of Non-
 aligned Countries in Lima this week--and the
 rejection of South  Korea's parallel bid-will
 improve Pyongyang's prospects for passing a
 resolution at the UN General Assembly this fall
 calling for withdrawal of US forces from South
 Korea.
 Pyongyang has worked hard to win support
 among the nonaligned in recent years, playing
 down its military alliances with Peking and Mos-
 cow while hitting hard at the continued pres-
 ence of US forces in South Korea.
 The South Koreans, hoping to block a
 North  Korean victory  at Lima,  mounted  a
 vigorous lobbying campaign themselves among
 the nonaligned this year. A number of foreign
 ministers spoke in support of Seoul at the con-
 ference, but the North's backers-led by Algeria,
 Cuba,  and  Yugoslavia-prevailed.

 TIMOR: UP FOR ADOPTION
 Lisbon has all but washed its hands of
 Timor. Admitting that the situation is totally
 out of control, the Portuguese have evacuated
 all their military and civilian personnel from the
 island and called for international humanitarian
 aid.
 Commercial vessels have evacuated most
 non-Timorese from Dili, and Indonesian naval
 ships are standing by in the harbor to remove
 Jakarta's consulate staff and any other persons
 who wish to go. The Portuguese governor of the
 colony and a skeleton staff have moved their
 headquarters to a small island off the coast.
 Lisbon has dispatched a special envoy to visit
 both Jakarta and Dili to discuss what can be
 done to resolve the situation.
 Portugal's  public  calls for international
 intervention have thus far been confined to
 humanitarian assistance. In a public statement
 on   Monday,  an    Indonesian spokesman said
 Jakarta believes that humanitarian assistance
 cannot be separated from the more general task
 of restoring security and order. The statement
 called on Lisbon to recognize this and to act
 accordingly.  Lisbon  apparently  did  consult
 Australia and Indonesia about a joint military
 effort  to  help  restore  order,  but Australia
 refused and Indonesia insisted that it must have
 full freedom of action. President Suharto wants
 Lisbon to publicly ask for Indonesian assistance
 to restore order, but Portuguese President Costa
 Gomes,  apparently  for domestic  political
 reasons, has reportedly decided that he cannot
 do so.
 Indonesia's preparations for military inter-
 vention, however, have probably advanced too
 far to turn back now. Suharto's main concern is
 to couch Indonesian intervention in terms that
 will avoid accusations of territorial aggression.
 He will  undoubtedly  insist that any action
 Jakarta takes is intended to restore order so that
 the decolonization process agreed upon earlier
 can continue and the interests of the Timorese
 people can be safeguarded.
 Recent  world-wide  publicity  about the
 deteriorating situation in Timor and the Portu-
 guese evacuation of the capital will work to
 Jakarta's  advantage.  Unilateral  Indonesian
 action undertaken now, in the name of ending
 the bloodshed and with the appropriate dis-
 claimers about territorial ambitions, will prob-
 ably not draw sharp  internati onal                                                                         criticism.

 Prince Sihanouk's plans for further travel,
 following his impending visit to Phnom Penh,
 suggest that he will continue as an international
 spokesman for Cambodia, at least through the
 end of the year. The reception the Cambodian
 communists give the Prince during his visit may
 provide some clues concerning the agreement
 reached in Pyongyang between Sihanouk and
 Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan and a
 more precise reading of Sihanouk's future.
 Sihanouk's Peking office announced recently
 that he will deliver a speech to the UN General
 Assembly "before December," but would stay in
 New York "only a few hours." Deputy Prime
 Minister for Foreign Affairs leng Sary and Foreign
 Minister Sarin Chhak will head Cambodia's UN
 delegation. Press reports indicate the Prince also
 plans to attend the celebration in Hanoi on
 September 2 commemorating the 30th anniver-
 sary of North Vietnam's founding-perhaps on his
 way back to Cambodia.
 Sihanouk returned to Peking from
 Pyongyang on Saturday and was met by vice
 premiers Teng Hsiao-ping and Li Hsien-nien. The
 date of Sihanouk's departure from Peking is un-
 certain. Premier Chou En-lai received the Prince
 and other members of the delegation on August
 26, at which time his return to Cambodia was
 probably discussed.
 The Cambodian delegation wound up its
 four-day visit to North Korea last Friday with a
 joint communique in which each side con-
 gratulated the other on its achievements, and
 "complete accord" was said to have been reach-
 ed. The Cambodian side endorsed the North
 Korean call for the withdrawal of US forces from
 South Korea and the replacement of the armistice
 agreement by a peace treaty. Although no aid
 commitments were mentioned in the com-
 munique, North Korea may have agreed to give
 Cambodia token economic aid.
 The Cambodian delegation participated in a
 round of public functions in Pyongyang-ban-
 quets and a military rally in honor of the Cambo-
 dian communist victory-and also met with Presi-
 dent Kim 11-song. Although the main purpose of
 the side trip from Peking was almost certainly to
 escort Sihanouk back to Peking, the visit afforded
 the Cambodians an opportunity to reaffirm their
 North Korean ties following their victory last
 April.
 INDONESIA: ECONOMY LOOKING UP
 The worst of Indonesia's trade and financial
 problems have passed, and the second half of this
 year should show steady improvement. Real
 growth for this year is now estimated at 7-8 per-
 cent, and oil earnings should permit this rate to
 be sustained well into the late 1970s.

 Most of the recent improvement in the
 payments position derives from higher oil ex-
 port earnings. After dropping to 70 percent of
 capacity for several months, output turned up at
 midyear as the US and Japan began to rebuild
 stocks. The high profit margins allowed the
 companies should ensure a progressive increase
 in production through the end of the year.
 The recent pickup in sales, higher average
 prices, and tax revisions favoring the government
 will permit Jakarta to exceed last year's oil export
 earnings. Earnings from other exports, however,
 will decline by an estimated 20 percent because of
 soft demand for Indonesian raw materials. Im-
 ports, which had been soaring since early 1974,
 are expected to decline in the second half of 1975.
 Jakarta last month put a temporary ban on foreign
 purchases of rice, wheat, sugar, and fertilizer.
 Jakarta has overcome the financial crisis that
 caused default of the state oil company, Per-
 tamina, on a loan earlier this year. It has stepped
 in as Pertamina's guarantor and covered the im-
 mediate payments due on the enormous debt
 owed by the company-$1.5 billion in short-term
 loans and $1.6 billion in long-term loans. Private
 foreign banks have advanced $575 million, enabl-
 ing a rescheduling of some debt payments. Later
 this year, the government is expected to call on
 private foreign banks for an additional $400
 million.
 At the same time, Jakarta continues to attract
 large-scale foreign support for its development
 projects. Japanese banks and corporations are ap-
 proaching the final stages of an agreement to put
 up $2 billion for constructing the large alumina
 project at Asahan, Sumatra, and two liquefied
 natural gas plants. Similar support probably will
 be arranged for the steel project on Krakatau.
 Despite the world recession, Indonesia's
 domestic economy should fare well this year.
 Agricultural output will be buoyed by an ex-
 cellent rice harvest. The slowdown in Pertamina's
 non-oil projects will put only a minor damper on
 the tempo of construction. The rate of iri
 flation-40 percent in 1974-abated substantially
 in the first six months of this year. The
 government's ability to intervene in the market
 with huge stocks of rice and fertilizer should hold
 down price rises during the remainder of
 1975.
 For the second time this month, China's
 official news service has publicized the dis-
 patch of troops to factories in Chekiang
 Province; the leaders in Peking are apparently
 trying to warn other provinces against allowing
 factionalism to disrupt production. Peking has
 not used troops in this capacity since the up-
 heavals of the Cultural Revolution in the
 mid-1960s.
 Over 10,000 troops have been sent in the
 past month to factories in the Chekiang capital
 of Hangchou to quell factional disputes that
 have been paralyzing production and causing
 civil disorder. Troops were initially dispatched
 to the Hangchou factories on July 19. Before
 taking this step, Peking had sought without
 success to resolve the long-standing Chekiang
 problem by consulting with provincial leaders,
 issuing special  directives, and sending
 high-ranking central government and party
 leaders to the province.
 Recent broadcasts also indicate that a
 relatively small number of troops are par-
 ticipating in iron and steel production in Inner
 Mongolia, Kiangsu, and Anhwei. The commit-
 ment of troops to these tasks followed recent
 central directives criticizing sagging iron and
 steel production. There is no indication that
 factional problems in these provinces are as
 bad as in Chekiang.

 With their sudden victory in South Viet-
 nam last spring, Hanoi's forces captured large
 amounts  of  US-made  military  equipment,
 ranging from small  arms to modern ground
 attack aircraft and significant quantities of
 munitions.
 The communists have a problem deciding
 how much of this equipment to integrate into
 their own forces and what to do with any sur-
 plus. One of the options is to provide arms to
 insurgents-a possibility that is causing consider-
 able  concern  in  nearby  countries,  notably
 Thailand and Malaysia. Thai insurgents have
 received aid from Hanoi in the past, and the
 North Vietnamese could now increase their sup-
 port.
 Hanoi could also earn hard currency by
 selling the equipment on the world market. The
 communists face major economic development
 costs in both the North and South and need
 foreign exchange for this. The captured equip-
 ment is worth about $5 billion, and its sale
 would ease the financial burden of development.
 A number of countries in Southeast Asia, the
 Middle  East,  and  Africa  are  reportedly
 interested in obtaining the equipment. Hanoi,
 however, has not yet decided to sell.

 US-made planes are the most valuable mili-
 tary hardware that was captured. The commu-
 nists seized some 1,100 aircraft, including 75
 F-5s and 113 A-37 fighter-bombers. The North
 Vietnamese apparently are integrating some F-5
 and A-37 aircraft, along with MIG fighters from
 the North, into an air division in the Saigon
 area. The US-made fighter-bombers give the
 North Vietnamese a significant ground-attack
 capability for the first time. Until now, their air
 force has had a clearly defensive orientation.
 Spare parts for the aircraft are in short
 supply, but the problem does not seem to be
 insurmountable. The communists can cannibal-
 ize other aircraft and may be able to find re-
 placement parts on the international market.
 In addition to the fighter-bombers, the
 communists seized large numbers of helicopters.
 Among these were about three dozen large
 transport helicopters and more than 400 smaller
 combat-support helicopters, including gunships.
 The  North  Vietnamese  appreciate  the heli-
 copters' mobility and firepower and probably
 will keep some for their own forces; many,
 however, could still be available for sale. The
 communists also captured approximately 50
 transports, including C-119s and C-130s, and
 will probably retain some of them.
 The  North  Vietnamese  got  significant
 quantities of communications and radar equip-
 ment, including relatively sophisticated items
 such as navigational equipment for all-weather
 operations. This and other electronic gear will
 be difficult for them to maintain, and some of it
 may be passed along to the Soviets and Chinese
 in exchange for continued support.
 With the take-over, the communists came
 into possession of some 400 naval craft, which
 they do not need, and approximately the same
 number of transports. The naval craft, mostly
 coastal and river patrol boats along with a few
 deepwater ships, may well be available for ex-
 port.  The  North  Vietnamese  have  already
 organized some of the transport ships to ferry
 cargo between large coastal cities.
 Ground Force Weapons
 The bulk of the captured US equipment
 consisted of ground force weapons and muni-
 tions. The inventory includes 500 tanks-mostly
 M-41s and M-48s-approximately 1,200 armored
 personnel carriers, about 45,000 trucks and
 jeeps, some 1,300 pieces of artillery, nearly 1
 million M-16 rifles and other small arms, and
 thousands  of  mortars,  antitank weapons,
 grenade launchers, and machine guns.
 Much of this equipment appears surplus to
 Vietnamese requirements. The  North  Viet-
 namese army  is already well equipped with
 Soviet and Chinese hardware, and Hanoi's stock-
 piles declined little as a result of the spring
 fighting. The North Vietnamese only recently
 standardized their weapons, and they probably
 would be reluctant to change, since US weapons
 would provide little improvement.
 Prospective Purchasers
 A number of prospective purchasers are
 reportedly waiting for Hanoi to open its doors
 for business. Nigeria, for example, plans to send
 a team to discuss arms purchases. The Nigerians
 are said to be interested in F-5s, helicopters,
 105-mm. howitzers, and M-16 rifles.          25X1
 Aerial photography IIdid show a
 US-made landing craft loaded with US-made
 105-mm. howitzers in Haiphong harbor; this
 suggests that Hanoi may be stockpiling weapons
 in preparation for selling them. Since most of
 the US equipment is readily marketable, it
 seems likely that Hanoi will eventually sell most
 of the armor and other ground force equipment,
 but serious questions of economic advantage,
 political impact, and international reputation
 must be decided before Hanoi begins disposing
 of its stockpile of captured arms.

 THAILAND: POLITICAL TENSIONS
 Long-smoldering political tensions broke
 into the open last week, sparking a wave of
 violent incidents in Bangkok and shaking public
 confidence in Prime Minister Khukrit Pramot's
 government. The most serious incident was the
 ransacking        of  Khukrit's  house  by drunken
 policemen. Elsewhere in the capital, striking
 government  security  guards  abducted  three
 Labor Ministry officials, and vocational students
 burned and looted Thammasat University.
 The incidents were not the work of any
 one group, but rather the result of a general
 right-wing  backlash  against  leftist student
 CPYRCpJrl-Ttests. Some military and other seniior secu-
 rity officers have long maintained that civilian
 rule cannot provide Thailand with civil order
 and political stability..
 More specifically, the police have been
 upset with the government for releasing-ap-
 parently in response to week-long protests by
 student  radicals-nine  student  and  farmer
 activists who had been arrested for kidnaping
 local government officials in northern Thailand.
 Ostensibly,  the  destruction  at Thammasat
 University was prompted by a desire of the
 vocational students to avenge the wounding of a
 comrade during a protest rally there last week,
 but in reality the violence appears to have been
 the work of right-wing provocateurs intent on
 intimidating the students at the university, the
 ideological fountainhead of the radical left.
 Khukrit, finding himself in the middle of
 the political cross-fire, decided to let the vio-
 lence play itself out. He was acutely aware that
 any strong-arm  reaction  by the government
 could easily backfire. A crackdown against the
 students would probably have sparked a new
 wave  of  student  protests,  whereas a move
 directed  at  the police  would  have  further
 alienated conservatives in both the government
 and the military.
 The government's agreement to reopen the
 investigation of the arrested students has for the
 moment restored a sense of calm in the streets,
 but the fundamental distrust between conserva-
 tives and the political left remains.
 While the episode clearly has tarnished
 Khukrit's image as a tough and able adminis-
 trator,  his  popularity  seems  largely  intact.
 Nevertheless, Khukrit keeps a wary eye on the
 generals. He balked at declaring a state of emer-
 gency during the height of the disturbances, in
 part out of fear that it would provide an oppor-
 tunity for the military to step in. The strongest
 advocate for such a measure was army com-
 mander  Krit  Siwara.

 The leftist Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola has made new territorial
 gains in the recent fighting in central and south-
 ern Angola, which has now tapered off. The
 Movement's position is enhanced by weaknesses
 within the two rival liberation groups and the
 inability of the Portuguese to assert any author-
 ity over the territory.
 The Popular Movement established itself
 some time ago as the dominant military and
 political force in Luanda and the exclave of
 Cabinda. The recent fighting gave it control of
 Lobito, Angola's major port, and of most of the
 more important urban centers along the central
 coastline between Luanda and Lobito. It also
 pushed its rivals out of Sa da Bandeira, deep in
 the territory of the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola.
 The National Front for the Liberation of
 Angola is still entrenched in northern Angola,
 where it controls two ports. Since mid-July the
 front has been building a large concentration of
 troops at Caxito and apparently has moved to
 within 20 miles of Luanda this week.
 The National Union still holds the dom-
 inant position in the rich central  highlands,
 particularly in the area around Nova Lisboa and
 Silva Porto. It is making a determined effort to
 recapture Luso, in eastern Angola, and appar-
 ently is planning an offensive to regain Lobito,
 without which it has no major supply point.
 Recently it received fresh supplies from Zaire
 and China, airlifted from Zaire, but it lacks a
 dependable source of military assistance.
 If the National Union and the National
 Front can gain the necessary momentum, they
 may still be able to squeeze the Popular Move-
 ment between them and force it to return to a
 coalition government that can assume sover-

 eignty from the Portuguese in November. The
 Movement may be overextending itself; in some
 areas it is already stretched thin.
 The 22,000 Portuguese troops in the ter-
 ritory are demoralized and distracted by the
 political struggle in Lisbon and are themselves
 divided politically. By and large, they have
 pulled out of the countryside to regroup in the
 coastal cities in order to protect the evacuation
 of whites and prepare for their own eventual
 withdrawal. The Portuguese cannot maintain
 order outside those cities.
 Portuguese  officials  are  attempting  to
 induce the liberation groups to accept a
 modified version of the defunct four-party
 transitional government. They are also sending
 delegations to neighboring African heads of
 state to enlist their support for a return to a
 coalition-type government in which all three
 liberation groups would participate, although
 with diminished authority. So far, there have
 been no takers.

 JORDAN-SYRIA: CLOSER COOPERATION
 A five-day visit to Syria last week by King Hu-
 sayn capped a series of steps over the past few
 months toward closer economic and military
 cooperation between the two countries.
 In a communique issued following the visit,
 the two countries announced the formation of a
 "Supreme Syrian-Jordanian Political Command
 Council" composed of Husayn and Syrian Presi-
 dent Asad. The council is supposed to meet at
 least once every three months to act on
 recommendations of the ministerial committee
 formed at the time of Asad's visit to Jordan last
 June.
 The communique avoided any mention of a
 joint military command, and its specific labeling
 of the new command council as "political" seems
 designed to relieve US apprehensions that a joint
 military command might be established. The
 prerogatives of the command council, which is to
 review plans for "coordination and integration"
 between the two armed forces, seem sufficiently
 broad to permit Husayn to keep his options open
 and to move toward military cooperation with
 Syria at his own pace.
 The communique also lists several other areas
 in which the two governments are to work
 together. In addition to planning for a "unified
 foreign policy," particularly with respect to Arab
 issues, the command council will discuss coor-
 dination of economic and social development
 plans, the formation of joint economic com-
 panies, unification of markets, and the establish-
 ment of a unified customs policy.

 The trend toward closer ties between the two
 countries has created anxiety among some
 elements of Jordanian society. The army, for ex-
 ample, is reportedly fearful that one consequence
 of the new relationship with Damascus will be the
 return to Jordan of the fedayeen in some form.
 Almost without exception, the army is opposed to
 any fedayeen presence, no matter how con-
 trolled. A large number of Jordanians, especially
 East Bank residents, also fear that in any close
 relationship with Syria, Jordan will be dominated
 by her larger, more powerful partner.
 Husayn sees many benefits from closer
 cooperation with Syria. In addition to the obvious
 economic advantages, the King must be especially
 pleased by the more moderate attitude of the
 Asad regime toward Jordan. Conscious, however,
 of the growing apprehensions among some of his
 closest supporters over the new relationship, Hu-
 sayn will move slowly, especially in the area of
 military cooperation.

 BAHRAIN: END OF AN EXPERIMENT
 Bahrain's 20-month experiment with con-
 stitutional democracy came to an abrupt end this
 week when Emir Isa, the ruler of the Persian Gulf
 island, dissolved the National Assembly, which he
 had recessed two months ago because it was
 dragging its feet on a tough law-and-order bill he
 wanted passed. The dissolution was justified on
 the grounds that the assembly had worked against
 the national interest and had become subject to
 the manipulation of leftists.
 Prime Minister Khalifa al-Khalifa, the Emir's
 brother, subsequently pledged new assembly
 elections, but the ruling family apparently does
 not intend to give the experiment in democracy
 another try in the near term. The constitutional
 provision requiring new elections within two
 months of the legislature's dissolution was
 suspended by the ruler.
 Emir Isa's move culminated a carefully
 orchestrated plan devised by the Khalifas to rid
 themselves of the recalcitrant assembly. It was set
 in motion several days earlier by a roundup of left-
 ists and the resignation of the Prime Minister.
 Khalifa was reappointed hours later and proceed-
 ed to form a new government, the Emir having
 accepted his "condition" that the assembly be
 dissolved.
 Most ministers, including those of interior,
 defense, finance, and foreign affairs, retained
 their posts. In a move to suggest action on press-
 ing social and economic problems, four new
 ministries were created. Earlier reports indicated
 that the government plans to announce a series of
 social welfare measures in an effort to secure
 popular support in the wake of moves against the
 assembly.
 There has been no public reaction to either
 the dissolution or the roundup of leftists. The
 arrests were presumably made to forestall agita-
 tion against the dissolution. Leftists were caught
 off guard by the government's move, and for the
 moment they are more concerned about evading
 the security forces than with organizing
 counteraction. Students may demonstrate when
 schools open in the fall, but most Bahrainis seem
 indifferent to the demise of the parliament.
 When the Emir granted a constitution in late
 1973, he expected that the assembly would be a
 docile participant in the new arrangements.
 Bahrain's legislators took their responsibilities
 seriously, however, and resisted the government's
 efforts to have its way.
 The Emir's sudden move to dissolve the
 assembly is the response to be expected of a ruler
 accustomed to almost unlimited freedom of ac-
 tion. The government's justification for rounding
 up leftists exaggerated their subversive threat.
 Although Bahrain has long had a plethora of
 clandestine groups, there is little evidence that
 the immediate security situation was cause for
 serious concern or that political stability has
 deteriorated.

 Page    15   WEEKLY SUMMARY    Aug 29, 75
 A constitutional conference on the future
 of Namibia (South-West Africa), sponsored by
 the South African government, opens in Wind-
 hoek, the territorial capital, on September 1.
 South African Prime Minister Vorster claims
 that the delegates, representing most of the ter-
 ritory's 12 ethnic groups, are free to choose any
 form  of  government   for  Namibia-including
 independence for the whole territory as a uni-
 fied state. The make-up of the conference, how-
 ever, presages the eventual emergence of a loose
 federal  system  that  would  maintain  white
 control   of  the  territory's major  mineral
 resources.
 The delegates to the conference have been
 chosen  indirectly by  legislative  or advisory
 bodies that have been formed for every ethnic
 group. A few of the legislative councils for non-
 white groups have been popularly elected, but
 even the elected bodies are dominated by old-
 line tribal chiefs who usually have gone along
 with South African tutelage.
 The South  Africans say that all ethnic
 groups in Namibia are to have equal standing in
 the conference, even though the groups vary
 widely in numbers and in their capabilities for
 autonomous existence. Some 90,000 whites
 comprise only 12 percent of the population, yet
 the sector of the territory that is reserved for
 whites includes much of the better grazing lands
 as well as the rich diamond and copper mines
 that  contribute  substantially  to  the  South
 African  economy.  On  the other hand, the
 Ovambo tribe makes up almost half of the pop-
 ulation, but Ovamboland, situated along the
 Angolan  border,   has inadequate  resources.
 Ovambos provide most of the unskilled labor for
 the mines.
 Pretoria apparently reasons that fears of
 Ovambo  domination  will  motivate delegates
 from the smaller tribes to back the whites in
 voting for a federal system that will perpetuate
 the present ethnic homelands. Although the
 Ovambos theoretically might control a pop-
 ularly elected  central government, the tribal
 leaders who will go to the conference actually
 want maximum autonomy for Ovamboland.
 A federation might involve no more than
 cosmetic changes in South Africa's policy of
 separate development, which has long incurred
 international  censure. Although some of the
 "petty apartheid" rules that Pretoria has applied
 in the white sector of Namibia have been lifted,
 Vorster has not proposed to abandon the basic
 discriminatory measures that have kept non-
 whites from advancing in the territory's modern
 industries.
 Inside Namibia, the most articulate opposi-
 tion to separate development has come from the
 South-West  African  People's  Organization,
 which wants Namibia to have a unified, pop-
 ularly elected government. The People's Organ-
 ization, whose membership is predominantly
 Ovambo, is the only Namibian nationalist group
 recognized by the UN or the Organization of
 African Unity. Its foreign-based guerrillas have
 seldom penetrated Namibian territory, but its
 youth wing organized a highly effective boycott
 of Ovambo legislative elections in 1973-the
 first popular elections to be held in Namibia. To
 offset the fiasco, South African administrators
 held a new election in Ovamboland last January
 and achieved a 55-percent turnout of eligible
 voters.
 Vorster may have no illusions that the out-
 come of the constitutional conference will be
 acceptable to the UN. His primary intention is

 to show that there is no serious Namibian op-
 position to separate development. If his case is
 to gain credibility, the proceedings of the con-
 ference must be publicized and any draft con-
 stitution must eventually be submitted to a
 freely conducted referendum. Meanwhile, South
 African and tribal authorities must refrain from
 the mass arrests of nationalists they employed in
 1973 during the Ovambo elections.
 Vorster's strategy has already been threat-
 ened by the assassination of the Ovambo prime
 minister on August 16. Although the identity of
 the assassin is unknown, the deed has been ap-
 plauded by several exiled leaders of the People's
 Organization. Moreover, the principal chief of
 the Herero ethnic group claims that agents of
 the People's Organization are plotting his death.
 The South Africans have reinforced their se-
 curity forces  in  Namibia and arrested some
 members of the People's Organization, but they
 have not clamped down on the whole group.
 BANGLADESH: REGIME CONSOLIDATES
 The new government in Dacca, which came
 to power in a military-led coup two weeks ago,
 appears firmly in control. There have been no
 signs of significant resistance.
 Within the army, which dominates the re-
 gime, a power struggle between the young offi-
 cers who led the coup and a faction of senior
 officers seems to be easing, at least for now. The
 latter faction appears to have acquiesced in the
 appointment this week of other senior officers
 to the country's top military positions. The new
 army leaders apparently have the support of the
 coup leadership.
 The disgruntled senior officers, unhappy
 because the coup leaders broke the military
 chain of command and sought an influential
 voice in the government, had been threatening
 to use force against them. The apparent decision
 of the senior officers to back off probably re-
 flects their uncertainty over whether they could
 count on the loyalty of key army units and their
 awareness that fighting within the military could
 provide a pretext for Indian intervention.
 The power struggle in the army has made it
 difficult for President Mushtaque Ahmed to
 establish government policies. Mushtaque has
 not taken any major steps in the economic
 sphere; he is said to favor an increased role for
 private enterprise and foreign investment.
 So far, his government has been concen-
 trating on the problem of corruption. Tough
 martial law regulations have been announced,
 including one that empowers the government to
 deal harshly with corrupt activities by past and
 present government officials. A number of high
 officials from the late president Mujib's govern-
 ment and Awami League party have been ar-
 rested on charges of having illegally enriched
 themselves.
 The new government has continued to
 make efforts to convince India of its desire for
 friendly relations. The Indians have been par-
 ticularly concerned that the regime's apparent
 Islamic orientation-a departure from Mujib's
 heavy emphasis on secularism-could frighten
 many of Bangladesh's 10 million Hindus into
 fleeing to eastern India. To reassure New Delhi,
 Dacca has announced that Bangladesh remains a
 secular state. But it is likely to remain interested
 in  improving relations with  Pakistan, whose
 friendship it views as necessary if it is to obtain
 economic aid from the Islamic countries and
 establish ties with China.
 New Delhi is trying, at least for now, to
 maintain good relations with Dacca. The Indians
 have assured the new regime of their friendly
 intentions and  reportedly have banned anti-
 Bangladesh propaganda in India. They have also
 denied earlier rumors that they had reinforced
 army units near the Bangladesh border. New
 Delhi  acknowledges,  however,  that  it  has.
 strengthened  its paramilitary border security
 forces as a precaution against a refugee exodus
 from Bangladesh, should communal strife occur
 there. India and the Soviet Union have given de
 facto recognition to the new regime.

 CUBA: REACTING TO US MOVE
 The announcement of the partial lifting of
 the US embargo so as to allow American sub-
 sidiaries abroad to trade with Cuba received a
 swift and favorable reaction last week in Havana.
 Prime Minister Fidel Castro continued to insist,
 however, on termination of the embargo on
 direct trade between the two countries as a
 prerequisite to what he called "deep
 negotiations."
 Speaking to a news conference on the occa-
 sion of Mexican President Echeverria's visit,
 Castro made clear his desire to  continue the
 momentum in Cuban-US relations. He called the
 move a positive gesture that "implies an advance
 toward the possibility of creating conditions that
 will allow us to engage in discussion on an equal
 basis and with dignity." Furthermore, he stated,
 "We are willing to negotiate with the US with ab-
 solute seriousness, frankness, and responsibility.
 But we would not like to do so with a dagger at
 our throat."
 Even with the embargo still in effect, Castro
 appears willing to countenance "negotiations on
 how to negotiate." He publicly acknowledged an
 interest in preliminary discussions with official US
 representatives, but he resurrected some familiar
 themes concerning his government's likely
 bargaining strategy. Castro indicated that Havana
 intends to counter US demands for compensation
 for expropriated American property with claims
 for restitution for the damage inflicted by the
 economic denial program. He also mentioned the
 return of the US naval base at Guantanamo as a
 problem that will have to be resolved.
 Castro is in no hurry and appears confident
 that he does not have to make any significant con-
 cessions. He apparently believes Washington is
 under more pressure than he is to make the next
 move. Some in the Cuban leadership will view the
 lifting of the third-country sanctions as primarily
 an effort by the US to end its problems with
 governments that have urged Washington to
 allow local subsidiaries of US companies to trade
 with Cuba. As a consequence, the most Havana is
 likely to do of a concrete nature is to release a few
 US political prisoners.

 ARGENTINA: THE MILITARY PRESSES
 The replacement of army commander in
 chief General Numa Laplane and the reported
 retirement from active duty of Interior Minister
 Damasco as a result of strong military pressure
 have defused yet another crisis. A military revolt
 has been averted for the time being, but military
 critics of the administration are in a much
 stronger position. They may yet seek Damasco's
 removal from the cabinet.
 The new army commander is General Jorge
 Rafael  Videla, formerly head  of the armed
 forces joint staff and one of the leaders of the
 group that pressed hardest for the changes. He
 and others in the group are said to be more
 disposed than other top officers to the idea of a
 military take-over.
 The appointment of Damasco, a 48-year-
 old army colonel, to the cabinet earlier this
 month sparked considerable unhappiness among
 a number of top military commanders. Publicly
 they claimed that their opposition stemmed
 from the fear that Damasco's elevation would be
 interpreted as military interference in the gov-
 ernment. They also raised the issue of protocol
 problems posed by the elevation of a colonel to
 a position technically above that of a general.
 Actually,  Damasco's rise, supported   by
 Numa Laplane, raised other, more fundamental
 problems   for them. There was considerable
 resentment of Damasco's prominent role in
 forming    the  new  cabinet-he  directed  the
 process-and his failure to consult fellow of-
 ficers.                           There  was  widespread  anxiety  that
 Damasco, already a second-echelon presidential
 adviser and an opportunist long identified with
 Peronism, was seeking to build an image of
 indispensability, as the ousted Lopez Rega had
 done before him. Top officers also regarded his
 presence in the cabinet while on active duty as
 linking the armed forces to a hopelessly inept
 government.
 Early in the controversy the army issued a
 communique  acknowledging  the  President's
 bZ
 I? Q
 legal right to name to the cabinet an officer on
 active duty but dissociating the service from
 active support for him. Despite this attempt to
 paper over the problem, it became apparent that
 the issue was important and potentially divisive.
 A desire to preserve military unity may well
 have been the reason even uncommitted officers
 eventually joined the ranks of those who had
 opposed Damasco and Numa Laplane from the
 beginning.
 The  military's  strong  stand  against
 Damasco and Numa Laplane points up several
 factors. Like it or not, the officers are inti-
 mately involved in national politics. Moreover,
 military conservatives have gained the upper
 hand and thus are in an even better position to
 exert pressure on the government, or even alter
 or replace it. Indeed, most Argentines will prob-25X1
 ably interpret the military's move as signaling its
 intention to take a still more active role in
 national decision-making.

 CANADA: LABOR MILITANCY
 ?
 (11111      74/ ?/ '1
 D
 i
 i
 espite   r
 s
 ng unemployment, Canada is
 getting no respite from labor's push for higher
 wages. Rather than confront the unions directly,
 Ottawa hopes to take the starch out of their
 demands by letting the economic slide run its
 course. In the interim, rising wage costs are
 aggravating inflation, and Canada's international
 competitive position is slipping.
 Labor unions show no sign of moderating
 their wage demands after winning record 15-per-
 cent gains last year. This year, hourly rates are
 up  19 percent, while labor productivity has
 remained  unchanged.  In addition to cost-of-
 living adjustments, the many small unions are
 holding out for wage schedules similar to those
 in higher paying industries and regions. Paper
 mill workers in Ontario, for example, are press-
 ing for a 42-percent increase over the next year
 to bring hourly rates in line with those in other
 basic industries.
 Unions are backing their demands with
 lengthy, disruptive walkouts. Strikes at pulp and
 paper  mills  since  mid-July  have  reduced
 Canada's  paper  production capacity  by  30
 percent. Based on the number of walkouts to
 date and the schedule of coming contracts, time
 lost from strikes this year will approach the
 record 9.3 million man-days in 1974. From now
 until the end of the year, contracts covering one
 million workers-including railway, mining, con-
 struction, and textile workers-come up for
 negotiations.
 The wage spiral has given a strong shove to
 labor costs and inflation. Unit labor costs in
 manufacturing rose at a 20-percent annual pace
 in the first half of 1975-double last year's rate.
 Canada thus suddenly finds itself facing one of
 the  worst  inflation  problems of any  major
 country. Industrial wholesale prices have moved
 up 14 percent annually since the start of 1975,
 and consumer prices have risen 9 percent. The
 comparable US figures are 5.6 and 6.8 percent.
 The wage spiral has already pushed hourly
 rates in  many industries above US levels-a
 marked change from the early 1970s, when
 Canadian firms enjoyed a 10-15 percent wage
 advantage. The loss in competitiveness is partly
 responsible for Canada's growing trade deficit in
 manufactured goods. Since January, this deficit
 has been running at a $9 billion annual rate, up
 from $8 billion in .1974 and $700 million in
 1970.
 The rapid  rise  in unit labor costs, the
 increasing frequency of strikes, and the general
 atmosphere  of  labor  militancy  have  made
 Canada less attractive for foreign investment. US
 manufacturers  have  lost  some  of their en-
 thusiasm for investing in a country where unit
 labor costs have been increasing at nearly double
 the US rate since 1970.
 The  government    is  reluctant  to  move
 forcibly because of labor's political clout in
 Ontario and Quebec, provinces vital to Prime
 Minister Trudeau's  Liberal Party.    To avoid
 adding fuel to wage demands, Ottawa is main-
 taining its go-slow policy toward stimulating the
 sagging economy.
 It is also permitting the Canadian dollar to
 drift downward to help compensate for the loss
 in  competitiveness.  Since  early  1975  the
 Canadian dollar has depreciated 3 percent, and
 most observers expect a further 3- to 5-percent
 slump before the end of the year. This would
 hike the cost of imported manufactures, but at
 the same time it would cushion the impact of
 sharply rising labor costs on Canada's inter-
 national  competitive   osition

 Reacting to economic setbacks, complaints
 from commercial and industrial sectors, and
 criticism from the press and proscribed political
 parties, the Rodriguez government is moving
 slightly to the right. In recent weeks, private
 business groups have made known their concern
 vegarding the deteriorating state of the economy
 as manifested in lower foreign exchange earn-
 ings,  deficits  in  the  balance  of  payments,
 reduced reserves, and a decrease in foreign
 Investment.
 To allay this concern, the government has
 expanded incentives for petroleum exploration,
 which had virtually ceased in the face, of restric-
 tive legislation. The government has also crit-
 icized the former natural resources minister,
 who was responsible for creating this problem,
 and appointed a pragmatic, middle-of-the-road
 director of national planning. It intends also to
 replace leftist-oriented doctrinaire economists
 and technicians who had created for themselves
 a "malevolent role affecting all areas of the
 economy and society."
 The confusion in the Ministry of Com-
 merce-a new minister has just been named fol-
 lowing the resignation of two others-is being
 attributed in Quito to the influence of leaders of
 industry and commerce. Appointments below
 cabinet rank also reflect a government effort to
 meet the needs of business.
 In another area, President Rodriguez has
 made several speeches whose purpose apparently
 has been to assure the public and to reduce
 anxieties regarding his regime's intentions. In
 these speeches, Rodriguez has stressed that his
 goals are to eliminate the differences between
 military and civilian attitudes and to establish
 peace and harmony. At the same time, he has
 denied that the military intends to create a
 military state or to perpetuate itself in power.
 Rodriguez' primary concern has been to
 take the heat out of recent criticism of his
 regime, and some of his actions should have this
 effect. His moves also appear to be a tacit
 admission that his government has not been able
 to cope with major problems facing the country.
 Rodriguez may also be trying to portray himself
 as more democratically oriented in order to
 build a following that will support his candidacy
 in the event that he decides presidential elec-
 tions should be held.
 Any hopes that Rodriguez will respond to
 pressure to move further to the right are likely
 to be short-lived. No person or group thus far is
 capable of removing the President by force, but
 the political discontent brewing for more than
 three and a half  ears may begin to boil in
 coming months.
