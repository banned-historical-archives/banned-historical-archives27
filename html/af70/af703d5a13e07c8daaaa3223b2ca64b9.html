 EAST-WEST RELATIONS     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  1
 While continuing to attack Western policies on dis-
 armament, nuclear testing, and Berlin, Moscow has initi-
 ated moves designed to set the stage for a new effort at
 General Assembly session in March or April to be at-
 tended by the heads of government.   The bloc has also
 moved to establish a deadline on the nuclear test ban
 talks and to bring the issue before the UN General
 summit meeting on Berlin by April at the latest.   At the
 UN the bloc delegations are apparently preparing to walk
 out of the disarmament discussion in the Political Com-
 mittee and launch an intensified campaign for a special
 negotiations on these issues.   Khrushchev repeated
 his call for
 Assembly.
 Che Guevara has departed for the Sino-Soviet bloc
 with an economic mission to arrange for next year's trade
 and further integrate Cuba economically with the bloc.
 Soviet bloc military specialists continue active in Cuba
 and many more will be required to train Cubans in the
 use of bloc military equipment.  While most Latin Ameri-
 can governments believe the new US restrictions on ex-
 ports to Cuba were justified, there has been strong
 criticism by Chile and Mexico.   The Castro regime, at
 least for the moment, has increased its popularity among
 the lower classes through the urban reform law.   Scat-
 tered opposition groups, however, continue active inside
 Cuba despite the regime's   denials.   In the Dominican
 Republic, a further weakening of Trujillo's position
 is evidenced in the poor turnout for his birthday
 demonstration on 24 October and in the worsening
 economic situation.

 Events appear to be moving in Lumumba's favor.
 Colonel Mobutu is confronted with growing disorders in
 the armed forces and political opposition in at least
 two provinces.   Mobutu's major difficulty, however, is
 with the UN Command in Leopoldville.   For its part, the
 UN has been unable to discover a local government which
 would have significant Congolese support and satisfy the
 demands for "legitimacy" on the part of Ghana, Guinea,
 UAR, and Morocco.
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE:CONTINUES .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 1
 Preparatory committees are reported to have been work-
 ing for some weeks in Moscow on a resolution to be present-
 ed to the meeting of world Communist parties--scheduled
 to be held around 7 November--which has been called to
 consider the Sino-Soviet dispute.      Recent authoritative
 statements from both parties have reaffirmed their basic
 positions and add to indications that they will find it
 difficult to resolve their conflicting views.
 USSR PURCHASING LARGE FREE-WORLD TANKERS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 3
 To ensure the long-term growth and stability of its
 petroleum exports, the Soviet Union is making a major of--
 fort to expand its relatively small and slow tanker fleet
 by purchasing large, modern tankers in the free world.
 Russian crews have taken possession of two such vessels
 recently constructed in Japan and the Netherlands, and
 the USSR is negotiating with Italy for six or seven
 large tankers.   The expansion of the USSR's oil exports---
 dramatized this year by a commitment to supply all Cuban
 needs--has required substantial readjustments in Soviet
 tanker operations.

 twist and is symptomatic of the great pressures generated
 by this year's agricultural difficulties.   Larionov, the
 party boss of Ryazan Oblast, had been singled out for
 praise by Khrushchev at the December 1959 party plenum
 for his accomplishments in agriculture.   By the time of
 his death in late September, he was in official disfavor,
 apparently for failing to fulfill the extravagant pledges
 for his oblast,to which Khrushchev had pointed as an ex-
 ample for all.
 UNCERTAINTY IN PEIPING OVER FUTURE ECONOMIC MOVES   .  .  .  .   Page  5
 The Communist regime in Peiping appears worried over
 the state of the Chinese economy and uncertain over what
 to do about it.   Peiping's comments on industrial achieve-
 ments so far this year have been uncommonly vague, but the
 major troubles are clearly in agriculture, which Peiping
 admits is still progressing too slowly.   For the second
 straight year the harvest in China will be poor, and this
 will have an adverse effect on food supplies and the
 level of exports.
 GHANA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  7
 Frustrations experienced by Ghanaian President
 Nkrumah in his attempts to promote his pan-African am-
 bitions appear to be influencing him to adopt an
 increasingly less friendly posture toward the West and
 to welcome wider contacts and tactical collaboration
 with the Sino-Soviet bloc.   Moreover, new emphasis by
 Ghanaian leaders on the "transition to socialism" in
 Ghana seems likely to reduce established Western
 economic interests and to provide new opportunities
 for the bloc to exploit.

 Political activity looking toward independence is
 increasing in the four British-controlled territories of
 East Africa.  Elections in Zanzibar are scheduled for
 January and in Kenya and Uganda for February, but progress
 toward self-government continues to be hampered by racial
 tension, tribalism, and squabbles among African politi-
 cians.   A constitutional convention for Tanganyika, the
 most advanced of the four, is set for March, and Julius

 UAR-Jordanian relations appear to be moving into a
 more critical phase and may involve a UAR-sponsored at--
 tempt to overthrow the Husayn regime.
 The Sudanese military
 government's handling of the problem of resettlement
 of some 50,000 inhabitants of the Wadi Halfa area who
 are to be displaced by construction of the Aswan High
 Dam has resulted in riots and has added to pressures
 for a return to civilian rule.               Shifts in the government
 of the oil-producing Persian Gulf state of Qatar are only
 temporary adjustments in a,.factional struggle there.
 THE TURKISH POLITICAL TRIAL  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  12
 Turkey's mass political trial has failed either to
 gain momentum or to capture popular enthusiasm.            There
 has been general criticism of the relatively minor
 character of the charges, designed mostly to ridicule
 leaders of the former regime, which have been presented
 thus far, although 38 of the 500 prisoners face possible
 death sentences for other offenses.  While the regime
 is becoming more sensitive to adverse domestic reaction
 and foreign criticism, it. still seems determined to re-
 move any possible threat to its existence from the
 leaders of the previous government.                                      J25X1

 As a result of antigovernment student disturbances
 in Venezuela between 19 and 26 October, the armed forces
 are on an alert status and President Betancourt's three-
 party coalition has come under severe strain. The
 leftist Democratic Republic Union party, long a dis-
 satisfied component of the coalition, was partly in-
 volved in the violence, and its representatives in the
 cabinet have since resigned on party orders.   The party
 may be considering withdrawing from the government at all
 levels, and aligning itself with the leftist-Communist

 The six-man military-civilian junta that ousted

 to secure the backing of the leftist elements whose
 demonstrations last August and September critically
 weakened the Lemus administration.   The coup was military-
 led, however  and
 the military will main-
 tain control over the civilian component of the junta.
 Ex-President Oscar Osorio, a retired army officer who
 retains strong backing in the armed forces and is widely
 popular throughout the country, will probably emerge as
 the real leader of the new government.   Strongly anti-
 Communist, he is known to favor thoroughgoing reforms
 to alleviate the country's deep-seated socio-economic
 problems.

 The Chinese Communist cult of Mao Tse-tung, which
 has fluctuated with the exigencies of party policies, in
 the past year has-approached idolatry..'The cult has two
 aspects:   the adulation of Mao Tse-tung as a father-figure
 of the Peiping regime who is "great, brilliant, wise,
 compassionate, tender, and trustworthy"; second, the claim
 that Mao is pre-eminent as a Marxist theoretician, "the
 most prominent Marxist-Leninist revolutionary, politician,
 and theorist among all living contemporaries."  The
 present extravagant claims for Mao as the legitimate
 heir of Lenin are interwoven with Peiping's defense of
 its position in the Sino-Soviet dispute.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 While continuing to attack
 Western policies on disarmament,
 nuclear testing, and Berlin,
 Moscow has initiated moves de-
 signed to set the stage for a
 new effort at negotiations on
 these issues.   Khrushchev re-
 eated
 his call for
 a summit meeting on Berlin ear-
 ly next spring.   At the UN the
 bloc delegations are apparently
 preparing to walk out of the
 disarmament discussion in the
 Political Committee .and launch
 an intensified campaign for a
 special General Assembly ses-
 sion in March or April to be
 attended by the heads of govern-
 ment.   The bloc has also moved
 to ` estiblish,'a:i.d :adline oh the
 nuclear test ban talks and to
 bring the issue before the UN
 General Assembly.
 Germany and Berlin
 Khrushchev used his con-
 versation with West German Am-
 bassador Kroll on 18 October
 to make clear his determination
 to settle the Berlin problem in
 1961.  He indicated that Moscow
 will press for an early summit
 conference and mentioned Febru-
 ary or March, or April at the
 latest.   He ruled out any long
 delays, and, as in his 20 October
 speech in Moscow, he indicated
 that postponement of Berlin
 negotiations until after the
 West German elections ,,..in  Sep-
 tember  1961  would  be  unac-

 Khrushchev also insisted
 on ,tbet permanent '.nature of -the
 Oder-Neisse boundary and the
 necessity of an early peace
 treaty with "both German states,"
 as well as a settlement of the
 Berlin problem.
 Khrushchev emphasized his
 desire for not merely normal
 but friendly relations with
 Bonn, and reversed the Soviet
 Foreign Ministry's position by
 agreeing that if West Germans
 in the Soviet Union wanted to
 be repatriated, the procedures
 which lapsed last December could
 be continued.  The Soviet pre-
 mier also agreed to refrain from
 public attacks on Adenauer,
 and indicated he would exclude
 some remarks from his 20 Octo-
 ber speech, which did not con-
 tain the lengthy diatribes a-
 gainst Adenauer, as many Soviet
 pronouncements in recent months
 have.
 Despite Khrushchev's re-
 affirmation of the USSR's in-
 tention not to undertake unilat-
 eral steps in Berlin,  the East
 Germans are continuing to exert
 pressures, although the pace has
 slowed down.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 October 1960
 Disarmament and the UN
 The East Germans made no attempt
 to carry out a threat to inter-
 fere with or prevent a visit of
 Eleanor Dulles and members of
 her "Crusade for Freedom" party
 to East Berlin on 21 October.
 The East Germans have not pub-
 lished their warning against
 this visit contained in a note
 to the US Mission in Berlin on
 19 October.
 The East Germans continue
 to press for a resumption of
 interzonal trade talks and have
 used the issue in a new effort
 to drive a wedge between West
 German,  and West Berlin author-
 ities by calling for separate
 negotiations.
 On 21 October,  East German
 Foreign Trade Minister Rau ad-
 dressed separate letters to Bonn
 and to West Berlin Mayor Brandt
 offering to negotiate And em-
 phas.izing the damaging economic
 effects of Bonn's denunciation
 of the 1961 trade pact.   Rau used
 an interview with a West German
 paper to appeal to West German
 businessmen to bring pressure
 on Bonn for new talks.   He also
 suggested that the West Berlin
 authorities offer new proposals
 .concerning the city's communi-
 cations with West Germany.   East
 German concern over the future
 effects of the cancellation of
 the trade agreement may have
 prompted a special economic mis-
 sion,  including the head of the
 State Planning  Commission, to
 go   to  Moscow last week.
 Since Khrushchev's depar-
 ture from New York on ].3 October,
 Soviet delegates at the UN have
 vigorously pressed his demands
 on disarmament and reorganization
 of the UN executive.   In his open-
 ing speech on 19 October before
 the UN Political  Committee, So-
 viet delegate Zorin echoed Khru-
 shchev's warning of a Soviet boy-
 cott of disarmament negotiations
 in the committee if Soviet dis-
 armament principles were not accept-
 ed as the basis for discussions.
 While calling for general
 and complete disarmament,  Zorin
 pressed the Soviet drive to se-
 cure recognition of three coequal
 blocs by repeating Khrushchev's
 call for the addition of India,
 Indonesia,  the UAR, Ghana,  and
 Mexico to the Disarmament Commit-
 tee, now composed of five Soviet
 bloc and five Western nations. On
 25 October,  Zarin again repeated
 his threat to walk out of the
 Political Committee and renewed
 Khrushchev's call for a special
 assembly session on disarmament
 next spring to be attended by
 the heads of government, who could
 give "clear directives" to a new
 negotiating  committee replacing
 the ten-nation group.
 The Soviet Union may feel
 that a walkout will create pres-
 sure on the West to attend a sum-
 mit session on disarmament and to
 accept Moscow's concept of uni-
 versal disarmament as the basis
 for negotiations.   Bloc propa-
 ganda accompanying such a walkout

 The Soviet Union has indi-
 cated its determination to press
 for a reorganization of the UN
 executive by directly attacking
 Secretary General Hammarskjold
 in the Administrative and Budget-
 ary Committee.  During the past
 week, bloc delegates frequently
 charged Hammarskjold with "ex-
 travagant spending" to further
 US policies in Congo, Laos, and
 Guinea, and the Soviet delegate
 demanded a $50,000,000 ceiling
 on the UN budget for 1961--for
 which the secretary general has
 asked $67,500,000.   It appears
 that the USSR may concentrate
 its attack on the UN Secretariat
 in the Budgetary Committee,
 which reviews the composition
 of the professional staii.   At
 present the Soviet Union and its
 satellites,   with  only  84
 representatives  on  the  staff,

 which Khrushchev called for
 while in New York.   In private
 conversations with Western dele-

 two weeks, Soviet delegates
 said they expected no major
 American  moves  at  the  nu-
 clear  test  ban  talks  before
 the  US  election, and gave
 no  indication  that  any  new

 Moscow.
 Soviet chief delegate
 Tsarapkin told a UN official
 he believed it would be some
 time before US policy would
 be decided and real negotiations
 could be resumed.   In a talk
 with an American official,
 Tsarapkin was "completely un-
 yielding" on the principal
 issues under negotiation.  He
 restated the USSR's position
 that   if  the  US  resumed

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 October 1960
 CUBA AND THE CARIBBEAN
 Che Guevara's ten-man eco-
 nomic mission to Czechoslovakia,
 the USSR, Communist China, North
 Korea, and East Germany left
 Cuba on 21 October.         On the eve
 of his departure, Guevara told
 a television audience that he
 was going primarily to negotiate
 Cuba's commercial exchange for
 the coming year under trade
 pacts with these countries.
 Guevara will probably seek ex-
 panded arrangements with the
 bloc to compensate for items
 that Cuba can no longer receive
 from the United States.   However,
 because of the nature of Cuba's
 industrial plant,  it may be
 forced to seek immediate alter-
 native sources of supply in
 nonbioc countries, which are
 better equipped to supply Cuba's
 import needs.
 His TV talk clearly implied
 efforts toward the further eco-
 nomic integration of Cuba with
 the bloc.   He referred to
 foreign "comrades" in the Cuban
 Petroleum Institute "who are
 going to the USSR to get equip-
 ment" and implied that bloc
 technicians in other industries
 are also performing such serv-
 ices.
 Cuba and Rumania signed a
 trade agreement and technical
 assistance protocol in Havana
 on 25 October, and a joint
 communique declared their in-
 tentionto exchange ambassadors.
 The composition of the Rumanian
 delegation suggests that that
 country may provide Cuba with
 technical assistance for its
 petroleum industry.
 Moscow has moved on several
 fronts this past week to foster
 the impression that there is
 a real danger that the US will
 intervene militarily in Cuba
 and that,  in that event,  the
 USSR stands ready to lend
 every assistance to Cuba.   The
 Soviet objectives are apparent-
 ly to increase suspicion of US
 intentions and to stimulate
 some action by the neutralists
 in the United Nations which
 might put the United  States
 in an  embarrassing position.
 Soviet propaganda cover-
 age of the Cuban situation has
 been stepped up and now in-
 cludes daily warnings of al-
 leged American plans for "coun-
 terrevolutionary invasions,"
 along with denunciations of US
 trade restrictions  and  of
 Ambassador  Bonsai's  recall.
 At the United Nations, the
 Soviet delegation has come out
 strongly in support of the
 Cuban complaint, which includes
 the charge that the US is
 planning to begin a large-scale
 invasion of the country "in
 a few days."
 Despite these efforts to
 arouse concern over the possi-
 bility of US intervention in
 Cuba,  it seems unlikely that
 the USSR anticipates such
 action.   Khrushchev's threat
 on 9 July to use rockets "if
 necessary" in defense of the
 Castro Government in the event
 of US aggression was so quali-
 fied as not actually to con-
 stitute a commitment to any
 specific course of action, and
 it has never been repeated.
 Furthermore,  TASS quoted Khru-
 shchev as saying in a press
 interview on 25 September, when
 asked about his rocket threat,

 27 October 1960
 "...you needn't worry.... Since
 America does not intend to
 attack Cuba, this means that.
 there is no danger whatsoever."
 Soviet bloc military ship-
 ments to Cuba thus far include
 small arms, machine guns, anti-
 aircraft artillery, and tanks.
 More shipments are expected., The
 quantity of this equipment is
 clearly excessive for Cuban in-
 ternal needs and will permit re-
 lease of Cuba's Western-manufac-
 tured weapons for clandestine
 military support elsewhere in
 the hemisphere, should this be
 the Cuban intention.
 In view of the lack of qual
 ified personnel in Cuba, the Cas
 tro regime will be required to
 rely heavily on the Soviet bloc
 for training the Cuban military
 in the use and maintenance of
 the new weapons and military-
 related items such as communica-
 tions equipment and radar.   In-
 creasing numbers of Cubans will
 probably be sent to the bloc
 for training, particularly if
 the Castro regime follows
 through with its apparent de-
 cision to build up a qualified
 "defense force" based on Soviet
 bloc equipment.
 The Cuban Government re-
 sponded to the new US export
 restrictions by increasing its
 propaganda attacks on the United
 States for this "new act of
 aggression."  On 25 October,
 most of the remaining American-
 owned businesses in Cuba were
 nationalized.
 Most other Latin American
 governments appear to feel that
 the US action was justified.
 Official circles in Mexico and
 Chile, however, are critical
 and feel it will give Castro an
 important propaganda advantage
 in the hemisphere.   Other govern-
 ments, while sympathetic to the
 US position, have expressed con-
 cern over what they expect will
 be a strong negative reaction
 among the Latin American public.
 Some of these governments
 may also see the move as obviat-
 ing the need for their own
 participation in any future mul-
 tilateral sanctions against the
 Castro regime.  Many Latin
 American leaders prefer to re-
 gard the Cuban issue as a bilat-
 eral problem between the United
 States and Cuba, and the Ecua-
 dorean foreign minister frankly
 explained that a number of Latin
 American governments are too
 weak to run ahead of public.
 opinion on this issue.
 The Castro regime, which
 has been embarrassed by a num-
 ber of defections this year
 among Cuban officials abroad,
 is apparently recalling dip-
 lomatic and consular officers to
 screen them.  Officials in Bra-
 zil and Mexico are already re-
 turning home, and more will prob-
 ably follow.                                                              A decree of 27
 September removed job tenure
 rights from foreign  service
 personnel.   It is becoming ap-
 parent that those officials re-
 garded as "reliable" for foreign
 assignment are those who unques-
 tioningly accept and are willing
 to promote the Communist position
 on Cuban and international issues.

 In the cities, tenants are
 reported to have reacted with
 enthusiasm to the 15 October
 urban reform law, which offers-
 them the prospect of becoming
 homeowners. The government
 probably calculated that the
 solidification of its support
 among  lower  income  groups
 would  more  than  compensate
 for the further alienation of
 the landlords, many  of  whom
 will lose their  sole  source
 of  income.
 Dominican Republic
 The Trujillo regime is giv-
 ing signs of further weakening.
 One example was the apathetic
 showing, during the 24 October
 rally honoring the dictator on
 his 69th birthday, which con-
 trasted sharply with previous
 staged. demonstrations of "loyal-
 ty."  Trujillo's efforts to
 prove to the world that he is
 implementing a program of "de
 mocratization" .havegenerally
 been recognized as a sham.   Af-
 ter some months in which his
 controlled propaganda media
 followed a viciously anti-US and
 pro-Castro and pro-Soviet line,
 Trujillo's speech on 24 October
 promised "undeviating" friend-
 ship for the United States in
 tacit admission of the failure
 of his previous tactics.
 The economic situation is
 worsening.   Trujillo's efforts
 to promote trade with Western
 Europe have not compensated
 for the financial losses result-
 ing from the country's elimina-
 tion from the benefits of the
 higher price for sugar in the
 US market and from continuing
 Venezuelan efforts to impose
 a petroleum boycott on the Do-
 minican Republic.  Unemployment
 continues to be a serious prob-
 leap, and there are indications
 that present Dominican efforts
 to refinance loans granted in
 past years by Canadian banks
 may fail.
 Dissidents inside the coun-
 try are showing unexplained op-
 timism, which could indicate
 that a new plan to oust the re-
 gime is in the final stages of
 preparation.  There are grow-
 ing rumors in dissident circles
 of an imminent invasion by exile
 groups from Venezuela.   There
 are also indications, :however,
 that those dissidents with mod-
 erate and pro-US views are los-
 ing ground to more radical ele-
 ments, in the underground move-
 ment.  According to the American
 Consulate, these pro-US groups
 were enthusiastic over the role
 of the United States in the Au-
 gust OAS conference that condemned
 Trujillo, but the lack of further
 decisive action against Trujillo
 has  demoralized  them    and
 reduced  their  influence.

 hand, may still harbor the hope
 that Souvanna's government will
 fall and that he will have a
 much more prominent role in a
 successor government.
 Negotiations between the
 government and the Pathet Lao
 in Vientiane are proceeding
 at an exceedingly leisurely
 pace, possibly by design on the
 part of Souvanna.   The negotia-
 tors now are feeling each other
 out on the question of how far
 Laos should go in establishing
 ties with the Sino-Soviet bloc
 and are apparently trying to
 devise the mechanics for a su-
 pervised truce between their
 opposing military forces.   The
 renewal of fighting in Phong
 Saly Province may have reversed
 any progress toward a firm
 cease-fire they might have made
 and could conceivably lead to
 a breakdown in the talks.
 Only preliminary reports
 have been received regarding
 the new fighting in Phong Saly,
 but it presumably reflects im-
 plementation of the First Military
 Region's reported plans to retake two
 posts lost by the: Pathet Lao earlier
 in the month.   Col.  Houmpanh
 has with Souvanna's approval
 reportedly been marshaling his
 forces for such an offensive
 for several days.   He told the
 American army attache on 25
 October that he expected his
 forces to engage the Pathet Lao
 momentarily.
 Col. Kouprasith,
 the nominal commander of the
 Fifth Military Region in Vien-
 tiane,  has denied any build-
 up in the Pak Sane area, al-
 though he does credit the Pathet
 Lao with the capability to
 launch an independent attack on
 Phoumi's forces.   In any event,
 Kouprasith's disapproval would
 probably prove no deterrent if
 Kong Le and his lieutenants
 chose   to resume operations.
 Kong Le has undertaken no
 new initiatives recently, but
 there are increasing indications
 that he is subject to strong
 Pathet influence.   He is re-
 ported,  for example,  to have
 permitted Col.  Singkapo,  a rank-
 ing Pathet military leader, to
 address officers in Vientiane
 on the virtues of a neutral for-
 eign policy.   He is also alleged
 to engage in frequent consulta-
 tions with the wife of Pathet
 Lao leader Prince Souphannouvong;
 she is reputed to be a doctri-    25X1

 result of  the unofficial  Thai
 blockade,  Souvanna has threat-
 ened to ask    the              newly  ac-
 credited Soviet   ambassador
 for aid in alleviating   the
 oil shortage. He  also told
 Ambassador Brown  that    if
 Thailand  persisted in  pre-
 venting the entry of goods into
 Vientiane,   he  would  take
 "this act  of aggression" to
 the UN Security Council.   The
 Soviet ambassador finally pre-
 sented his credentials  to
 King Savang  on 26 October,
 alter having been kept wait-
 ing in  Vientiane for 13 days.
 Colonel Mobutu's control
 seems to be slipping, but this
 does not necessarily guarantee
 the early return of Patrice Lu-
 mumba to power, although events
 appear to be moving in  his
 favor.   Mobutu's decision not
 to   leave   the Congo at this
 time for a personal appeal to
 UN Secretary General   Hammar-
 skjold has probably delayed a
 showdown and the army chief's
 eclipse.
 Chaos within the armed
 forces appears to be widespread,
 with lines of authority unclear.
 Last week mutinies reportedly
 occurred in Leopoldville and
 in the provincial capitals of
 Stanleyville and Coquilhatville.
 Disorderly Congolese troops
 terrorized the African quarter
 of Leopoldville and routed
 the police patrols of provincial
 governor Cleophas  Kamitatu.
 Mobutu flew to Coquilhatville
 in an effort to restore order
 Mobutu apparently is de-
 pending on the 5,000-man force
 based at Thysville--the army's
 principal garrison about 80
 miles south of Leopoldville--to
 regain control of the capital
 city.  However, his recent effort
 to bring an armored unit to Leo-
 poldville was opposed by the UN
 Command,,which ordered its forces
 to set up roadblocks to prevent
 the unit's advance.  On 26 October,
 the UN Command ordered Mobutu to
 withdraw his troops from Leopold-
 ville, and he acquiesced.
 The Thysville garrison may
 assume increasing importance if
 its commander, Lt. Col. Louis
 Boboso,tries to become the new
 strong man of the Congo. Boboso,
 reportedly a stronger personality

 27 October 1960
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Preparatory committees are
 reported to have been working
 for some weeks in Moscow on a
 resolution to be presented to
 the meeting of world Communist
 parties--scheduled to begin
 around 7 November--which has
 been called to consider the Sino-
 Soviet dispute.
 non-
 bloc  as well as bloc  Communist
 party delegations have been tak-
 ing part in at least some of the
 preparatory meetings.   The Chi-
 nese Communists have apparently
 also been represented at these
 meetings,  perhaps by politburo
 members Teng Hsiao-ping and Peng
 Chen,  who apparently  were ab-
 sent from Peiping from mid-Sep-
 tember to 25 October,                   when Peng
 Chen reappeared in Peiping.
 Recent public statements
 from both Moscow and Peiping
 have given no indication that
 either intends to compromise
 significantly on the substantive
 issues in dispute.   Khrushchev's
 20 October speech in Moscow in-
 cluded a vigorous and complete
 defense of Soviet propositions,
 and Soviet publications continue
 indirectly to engage in condem-
 nations of Chinese Communist
 theoretical positions.   In ad-
 dition to these efforts to in-
 doctrinate the population on
 the incorrectness of leftism,
 dogmatism, and sectarianism, an
 attack on Chinese positions was
 probably the purpose of a series
 of three lectures on issues
 which have been in dispute.

 tures which began in Moscow on

 According to a Moscow
 rumor,  presidium member Suslov      2bA11
 has also recently told, a number
 of party meetings in Moscow that
 unless the Chinese admit their
 ideological errors,  a breach
 in Sino-Soviet party relations     25X1
 should be expected.
 Chinese are said to be "unable
 to understand" why the Russians
 are in such a hurry to settle
 the dispute,  and to believe that
 Moscow and Peiping should em-
 phasize their points of agree-
 ment while continuing to dis-
 cuss their differences.   The
 Chinese apparently favor dis-
 cussions but "do not believe
 that the dispute can be settled
 at one sitting."

 suggest a Chinese effort to
 present an appearance of reason-
 ableness prior to the meeting.

 emphastzcd.isolidarity with .the
 USSR and gratitude for Soviet
 aid.
 The mid-October issue of
 the Chinese theoretical journal,
 Red Flag,  has been canceled,
 perhaps because it carried an
 article which the Chinese lead-
 ers decided at the last moment
 would exacerbate the situation.
 Peiping announced on 16 October,
 the day the magazine was sched-
 uled to appear, that it would
 be combined with the next issue,
 to be published at a later, un-
 specified date.
 At the same time,  Peiping
 has not budged from any of its
 basic positions in the dispute,
 continuing to reiterate on
 suitable occasions its belief
 in the necessity of struggle
 against US imperialism. I rther"
 more, the Chinese are openly
 encouraging the Albanians and
 other Communists to support
 their stand.   A telegram from
 Peiping, broadcast by Tirana on
 24 October,  stressed the theme
 of Albania's consistent struggle
 against. "modern revisionism"
 and its great contribution to
 defending "the purity of Marxism-
 Leninism.'"                        Among other actions
 which Moscow may well regard
 as provocative,  Peiping has sent
 a military delegation to Albania,
 and during the last two weeks
 has signed scientific,  technical,
 and cultural exchange and coop-
 eration agreements with Tirana.
 Peiping is using the 10th
 ,anniversary of the entry of its
 forces into the Korean war to
 reaffirm strongly several of
 its basic positions along the
 lines of the Chinese party's
 endorsement in late September
 of Mao Tse-tung's handling of
 the Chinese civil war.   The
 regime's propaganda is asserting
 that the Korean experience is
 applicable to today's world sit-
 uation because the Korean con-
 flict proved that the United
 States is a "paper tiger" and
 that peace cannot be begged for
 but can only be won through "res-
 olute? struggle."
 By emphasizing Sino-Korean
 unity both during the Korean
 war and afterward,,;.  Peiping is
 attempting to give the impres-
 sion that Pyongyang is a stanch
 supporter of Communist China's
 present policies which conflict
 with Moscow's. The North Koreans,
 in effect,  have agreed with the
 Chinese on the practicality of
 a tougher bloc effort to drive
 the United States out of Asia,
 but are more circumspect about
 endorsing all aspects of Pei-
 ping,'s views.
 European satellite leaders,
 with the exception of the Alba
 nians, continue to restate their
 solid support for Khrushchev's
 personal leadership and conduct.
 Party leaders of Czechoslovakia,
 Hungary,  and Poland have made
 this clear in public speeches,
 and top-level government meet-
 ings are expected to be held
 in the other satellites to en-
 dorse Khrushchev's policies
 before the November meeting in
 Moscow.
 The Albanian regime, how-
 ever,  continues to be conspicu-
 ous by its endorsement of Mao's
 views.   In a 25 October speech
 dealing with the UN General As-
 sembly meeting, Albanian Premier
 Mehmet Shehu,  who recently re-
 turned from New York,  asserted
 that China was following a cor-
 rect Marxist-Leninist line in
 its policies.   He praised the
 "valiant" Mao Tse-tung, and
 spoke at length on China's role
 in world affairs.   Shehu played
 down the value of Soviet peace
 proposals and mentioned present
 aspects of Soviet foreign policy
 only in passing,  while criticiz-
 ing Yugoslav "revisionism" and
 American "imperialism" extensively.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 October 1960
 While Albania remains the
 only Communist party which ap-
 pears to be endorsing the
 Chinese party and all of its
 views,  considerable uneasiness
 over the Sino-Soviet dispute
 and its implications continues
 to be evidenced in the other
 satellite parties and in Com-
 munist parties throughout the
 world.   It seems likely that
 this uneasiness exists in the
 Soviet and Chinese parties as
 well, and that they will both
 attempt to use the coming meet-
 ing to prevent a complete break
 in party relations.   Neverthe-
 less, developments of the past
 few weeks add to earlier indi     25X1
 cations that they will find it
 very difficult to resolve their
 conflicting views.
 USSR PURCHASING LARGE FREE-WORLD TANKERS
 To ensure the long-term
 growth and stability of its pe-
 troleum exports, the Soviet
 Union is launching a major ef-
 fort to procure large, modern
 tankers in the free world.  Rus-
 sian crews have taken over two
 such vessels recently construct-
 ed  in Japan and the Netherlands.
 Both of the new tankers origi-
 nally were contracted for by
 Greek owners and prior to de-
 livery were sold to the USSR--
 apparently for cash.
 The Japanese-built vessel,
 of more than 39,000 tons, is a
 particularly significant addi-
 tion, as most of the present
 Soviet tankers carrying petro-
 leum exports are in the 11,000-
 ton class.  The two largest ves-
 sels, Pekin and Varshava, are
 of 30,000 tons; another vessel
 of this class  will  soon  be
 launched. The  entire  bloc
 tanker fleet, with some 136 ships
 and  a  total  of  about
 1,200,000 dead-weight  tons,
 is still small and slow by
 world standards.
 The American Embassy in
 Rome is reliably informed that
 Moscow is offering to purchase
 Italian merchant vessels total-
 ing about 300,000 dead,-weight
 tons in exchange for wheat. The
 USSR has expressed particular
 interest in acquiring two
 tankers of 47,700 tons each,
 which were launched earlier
 this year, and in four or five
 tankers of 35,000 tons each.
 This  proposal  is  the  larg-
 est'.                                                               single  offer  the  USSR

 the moment, willing to pay cash,
 the USSR has aroused consider-
 able interest among Western ship-
 builders, several of whom al-
 ready are supplying other types
 of vessels and smaller tankers
 to the Soviet Union.
 If the present purchases
 are part of a long-range pro-
 curement program, it is likely
 that Moscow will eventually re-
 quest deferred payment  pro-
 visions, as it already receives
 in some capital equipmenttrans-
 actions with Western suppliers.
 COCOM restrictions on the sales
 of tankers to the bloc have been
 drastically eased since 1958;
 the only prohibition  remain-
 ing is against supplying ships
 with speeds in excess of 18
 knots.
 The expansion of the USSR's
 oil exports--dramatized this
 year by a commitment-to supply
 all Cuban needs--has required
 substantial readjustments in
 Soviet tanker operations.   By
 chartering Western vessels,  the
 Soviet Union has been able to
 boost the amounts delivered to
 Cuba and to Other distant des-
 tinations without affecting
 deliveries elsewhere.   In 1959
 more than 60 percent of the 17,-
 400,000 tons of bloc oil moved
 from the Black Sea was carried
 on free-world vessels.
 The low rates prevailing in
 the depressed tanker market and
 the large amount of idle free-
 world tonnage available for
 charter probably preclude any
 immediate transportation diffi-
 culties for the Soviet oil-export
 program.   Soviet economic policy
 is opposed to unnecessary re-
 liance on free-world resources
 of any kind, however, and the
 purchase of large, new Western
 tankers to supplement bloc  .

 THE CASE OF COMRADE LARIONOV--A LESSON FOR SOVIET PACE SETTERS
 On 22 September, the Soviet
 press announced the death after
 a "serious illness" of central
 committee member Aleksey Niko-
 layevich Larionov, first secre-
 tary of Ryazan Oblast in  the
 Russian Republic.   The personal
 tragedy of Larionov, who at the
 December 1959 party plenum was
 probably the most highly praised
 man in agriculture, has a dis-
 tinctly Soviet twist and is
 symptomatic of the great pres-
 sures generated by this year's
 agricultural difficulties.
 Larionov, party boss of
 Ryazan since 1948, reached the
 height of his career in December
 1959.   He was awarded the title
 "Hero of Socialist Labor,"
 decorated with the Order of
 Lenin and the medal "Hammer and
 Sickle" for achievements in
 livestock  production,   and
 singled out by Khrushchev at the
 plenum for lengthy and extrava-
 gant praise.   His past successes
 and his pledge to fulfill the
 Seven-Year Plan livestock goals
 in only three years were held up
 repeatedly by Khrushchev as
 examples to officials in all
 lagging agricultural. areas.
 Larionov could ill afford
 to fail.   "I know  Comrade
 Larionov," said Khrushchev at
 the plenum.   "He would never
 consider taking an unrealistic
 pledge, to sprint, only  to
 founder the next day; that, he

 would not agree to do."        This,
 however,  is exactly what Larionov
 did.
 The quarterly bulletins of
 the RSFSR Council of Ministers
 on the results of the "social-
 ist competition in the produc-
 tivity and delivery of livestock
 products" tell the story. Ryazan,
 still the winner according to
 the October 1959 issue, had by
 the time of the next quarterly
 report in February 1960 dropped
 to fourth place.   In the two
 subsequent reports, in April
 and July, Ryazan was not listed
 among the many oblasts cited
 for good performances.   No fig-
 ures were released on the agri-
 cultural situation in Ryazan,
 nor was?:.~ the nature of Larionov's
 difficulties. revealed.
 On 25 June, a satirical
 poem appeared in the main agri-
 cultural newspaper clearly di-
 rected at Larionov.   The poem
 twitted a certain "Hero Larion"
 for blaming insufficient fodder
 supplies on pilfering mice.
 The piece ended with the sug-
 gestion that getting rid of
 Larion rather than the mice was
 the better solution. The next
 ominous sign for Larionov was
 the removal of two oblast party
 bosses in September, specifiy--
 cally for failing to fulfill
 their, livestock pledges for
 1960.  They had made these
 pledges in response to the pres-
 sure to emulate Larionov.
 Dissatisfaction with Lari-
 onov was demonstrated in the of-
 ficial treatment of his death
 and funeral.   Only an obituary
 and a brief statement of con-
 dolences from the party central
 committee were published.   Al-
 most all other full members of
 the central committee who have
 died in the last five years
 have had a funeral commission
 appointed, a state funeral with
 honor guards, and been buried
 in the Kremlin wall;  Larionov
 was accorded none of these honors.
 The official cold shoulder
 given Larionov undoubtedly re-
 flects Khrushchev's own attitude.
 Larionov's botching of his agri-
 cultural pledges must have been
 a source of considerable dis-
 appointment and embarrassment    25X1
 to Khrushchev,who had lavished
 so much praise on him

 consumption, by its encouragement
 to urban and rural residents
 alike to grow more vegetables,
 by its exhortations to grow more
 catch crops and to go to the
 hills and gather wild plants,
 and by an admission that Chi-
 nese agriculture remains more
 at the mercy of weather than
 does the agriculture of more
 developed countries.   In addi-
 tion, authorities in Kwangtung
 have agreed to exempt peasants
 from state taxes and purchase
 quotas on some of next spring's
 harvest.
 Industry's performance so
 far this year has been somewhat
 brighter than agriculture's,
 from the regime's point of view,
 but Peiping has been uncommonly
 vague about accomplishments.
 Shortages of raw materials have
 plagued various industries, and
 the press  still  expresses
 frequent  concern  over  the
 quality  of  industrial  prod-
 ucts,                   especially  those from
 the   vaunted small-scale enter-
 prises.
 Shortages of petroleum
 products have apparently af-
 fected transport.                    Urban passen-
 ger transport schedules in
 Peiping and Shanghai have re-
 portedly been sharply curtailed.
 Transport  has  been  hard
 hit  this  summer,  with  un-
 usually  frequent                     traffic
 interruptions  because of
 weather.
 There is some evidence
 that China is having difficul-
 ties in fulfilling current
 trade commitments.  Trade dif-
 ficulties have apparently not
 been confined to the bloc.
 Trade with the sterling area
 and  with  Western  Europe
 has  declined  since  early
 summer,   and  the "'.level  of
 China's total  trade  this
 year may   fall  below     last
 year's   high  level.
 Communist China, in spite
 of its rapid economic advance,
 remains dependent on the USSR
 for key items for its industrial-
 ization program and for technical
 assistance.   Some Soviet tech-
 nicians have already been with-
 drawn, and further withdrawals
 could be made.
 In the past, China has been
 permitted to fall behind in its
 short-term obligations to the
 rest of the bloc, principally
 the USSR.   It must face the pos-
 sibility that the USSR, and the
 European satellites in particu-
 lar, may not be willing to per-
 mit China to accumulate addi-
 tional indebtedness in trade.
 Further, the USSR has not greeted
 with any warmth Mao Tse-tung's
 much-publicized sorties into the
 field of economic policy, par-
 ticularly his "three magic keys"
 to economic growth--including
 the leap forward and the com-
 munes.  Although the validity
 of these concepts continues to
 be reaffirmed, recent publicity
 has  not  been extensive,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 October 1960
 Frustrations experienced
 by Ghana's President Nkrumah in
 his attempts to promote his pan-
 African ambitions appear to be
 influencing him to adopt an in-
 creasingly less friendly pos-
 ture toward the West and to wel-
 come wider contacts and tacti-
 calcollaboration with the Sino-
 Soviet bloc.   Moreover,  new
 emphasis by Ghanaian leaders on
 the "construction of a socialist
 economy" in Ghana seems likely
 to reduce established Western
 economic interests and to pro-
 vide new opportunities for the
 bloc to exploit.
 This trend toward greater
 involvement with the bloc would
 be accelerated should Western
 financing for Ghana's extensive
 Volta River hydroelectric-alu-
 minum project not materialize,
 despite the apparent imminence
 of a final agreement between
 Nkrumah's regime and a Western
 consortium which is considering
 the scheme.
 Ghana's drift from the
 West and toward a variety of
 "positive neutralism" showing
 greater parallelism with posi-
 tions espoused by Moscow was
 pointed up dramatically by Nkru-
 mah's performance at the United
 Nations last month.   .Displaying
 none of the appreciation for
 US attitudes he has shown in
 private meetings with American

 ments were consistently critical
 of the West and made clear his
 basic agreement with the Soviet
 Union's attacks on Secretary
 General Hammarskjold and the UN
 Secretariat,
 told his people that his talks
 in New York with Khrushchev had
 convinced him that "Russia wants
 peace more than anything else."
 The chaotic situation in
 the Congo seems to have prompted
 Nkrumah's new course more than
 any other single factor.   There
 are strong indications that he
 has been deeply embittered by
 what he apparently regards as
 the responsibility of 'Western
 "imperialists"--first for the
 "secession" of Katanga Province
 and then for the failure of the
 UN to act as an agent of the
 Lumumba government.   Nkrumah has
 counted on Lumumba to align the
 Congo with a Ghana-led crusade
 for a political union of African
 states.   Since the Soviet bloc's
 unilateral intervention seemed
 to serve the objective of keep-
 ing Lumumba in power,  it did not
 draw Nkrumah's ire,  but rather
 appears to have added to his
 growing disposition,  encouraged
 by influential leftist advisers,
 to collaborate more closely with
 the Communist world.
 In any event,  the USSR suc-
 ceeded in achieving its first
 major breakthrough in Ghana last
 August at a time when its involve-
 ment in the Congo was increasing
 rapidly.   A technical assistance
 and other agreements were con-
 cluded providing for a $40,000,-
 000 credit to Ghana and for trade,
 cultural cooperation,  and the
 purchase by Ghana of four to six
 Soviet IL-18 aircraft.   As a re-   25X1
 suit the number of Soviet tech-
 nical personnel in Ghana appears
 to be increasing rapidly.
 In a speech following his
 return to Accra,  Nkrumah in ef-
 fect accused the United States
 of failing "to take a positively
 decisive stand on the question
 of peace."   At the same time,  he

 Accra seems prepared to
 take greater advantage of edu-
 cational and training scholar-
 ships   offered   by the bloc and
 also to encourage close ties
 between cooperative organiza-
 tions in bloc countries    and
 Ghana's  government-controlled
 National Cooperative Council,
 which has been assigned a major
 role in the "transition to
 socialism."   In   these   areas,
 a particularly prominent role
 is being played by East Germany,
 whose leaders have made Ghana
 one of the principal targets
 in their campaign for recogni-
 tion.   So far Nkrumah's response
 to this effort has been wary,
 although he reportedly agreed
 last month,  in a letter to Prime
 Minister Grotewohl,  that diplo-
 matic relations                                                                    should   be
 established between   the   two
 countries "in due time."
 Political activity looking
 toward independence is increas-
 ing in the four British-con-
 trolled territories of East
 Africa--Tanganyika,  Kenya, Uganda,
 and Zanzibar.   Tanganyika,  the
 most advanced of the four,   is
 scheduled to take a further
 stop toward independence next
 parts of the Central African
 Federation as well.
 Nyerere hopes to sell Brit-
 ish Colonial Secretary Macleod
 on the federation idea before
 the Tanganyika constitutional
 talks open.   If he wins Macleod's
 support,  he will ask for full
 internal autonomy for
 Tanganyika by January
 1962 but delay his de-
 mands for independence
 until the other ter-
 ritories have reached
 a similar level and
 together with Tangan-
 yika can attain in-
 dependence as a unit.
 Otherwise,  he plans
 to drive for full in-
 dependence for Tan-
 ganyika "sometime in
 1961."
 Although the
 British may have some
 qualms about Nyerere's
 federation plans in
 March when a conference is to
 formulate a new constitution.
 Julius Nyerere,  the territory's
 newly appointed African chief
 minister,  is promoting the idea
 of federation of the four ter-
 ritories when they become inde-
 pendent which might include
 view of the problems they face
 elsewhere in the area, they are
 unlikely to oppose him outright,
 both because they tend to favor
 federation as enhancing East
 Africa's economic viability and
 because they are unwilling to
 undermine Nyerere's position

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 October 1960
 The virulence of Husayn's
 attack reflects not only his
 animosity toward Nasir   but
 also the necessity for appeas-
 ing                 his Bedouin and Majalli
 tribal supporters in the Jordan.!
 nian Army, who are still incensed
 over the assassination of Prime
 Minister Majalli and pressing
 for some retaliatory action
 against the UAR.   The speech
 probably was also intended to
 placate the Bedouin-Majalli
 faction for the failure to obtain
 any redress for Majalli's assas-
 sination through UN mediation
 in New York.
 Husayn's attempts to satis-
 fy his army supporters in his
 speeches have thwarted UN medi-
 atory efforts, however, accord-
 ing to UN representative Spinelli
 in Amman.   Both Spinelli and
 Hammarskjold feel Nasir's moder-
 ate attitude toward Jordan in New
 York might well have led to a
 modus vivendi between the two
 countries.  When Husayn arrived
 in New York, he too was prepared
 to make a moderate statement on
 his government's position,  Spi-
 nelli said, but a last-minute
 plea from Amman for a more ex-
 treme statement in deference to
 the Bedouin-Majalli army faction
 resulted in the speech on 3 Oc-
 tober which antagonized Nasir
 and probably provoked his prop-
 aganda blasts in Syria.
 Spinelli stated Husayn had
 appeared contrite in talking to
 Hammarskjold the day after the
 General Assembly speech, and
 that Hammarskjold had told the
 King his speech had dissipated
 the initial atmosphere of con-
 ciliation.   The UAR and Jorda-
 nian foreign ministers neverthe-
 less are quietly consulting in
 New York to see if any progress
 can be made in resolving impor-
 tant points in the dispute,  such
 as the activities of Jordanian
 political exiles in Syria and
 the extradition by the UAR of
 the three alleged assassins of
 Majalli..   Spinelli indicated he
 had reason to believe the UAR
 may be ready to moderate its
 propaganda if Jordan will do
 likewise.   He intends to suggest
 this to Husayn, but admits there
 is "little room for optimism"
 in the present situation.
 The continuation of Jor-
 danian-sponsored acts of ter-
 rorism in Syria promises to
 push UAR-Jordanian relations in-
 to a new, more critical phase.
 The 25 October bombings in Da-
 mascus, apparently instigated
 by Jordanian agents, are likely
 to be followed by further such
 acts.    The  UAR has widely
 puolicized the Damascus bombings,
 as well as earlier ones near
 the Jordanian border,  in an ap-
 parent effort to stir up Syrian
 feeling against Husayn.
 Having adopted this tactic,
 it seems certain the UAR will
 feel compelled to retaliate in
 Jordan or risk the appearance
 of impotence.   UAR involvement
 in the overthrow or assassina-
 tion of Husayn could bring
 direct Israeli military inter-
 vention in Jordan.
 Iraq
 Dissatisfaction with the
 Qasim regime continues to mount,
 and criticism is becoming more
 outspoken.     Most Iraqi contacts
 of the American Embassy in Bagh-
 dad seem to feel that the regime
 is doomed; none, however,  is
 willing to set a date for its
 demise.
 Qasim has lost the confidence
 of "most government officials,
 army officers, and the civilian

 populace."  Dissatisfaction
 largely arises from Qasim's con-
 stant vacillation, from deterio-
 rating economic conditions, and
 from recent instances of patron-
 age of the Communists.
 Plans for a 21 October demon-
 stration in Baghdad by anti-
 Communist religious leaders were
 thwarted when security forces
 arrested a number of members of
 the Islamic party, including one
 imam who had delivered a vicious
 personal attack on Qasim in a
 sermon.
 Evidence of economic dis-
 content lately has become ap-
 parent in the Iraqi press with
 numerous editorials discussing
 price increases and rising liv-
 ing costs.  Demands voiced for
 an official investigation into
 the causes of this phenomenon
 apparently have forced the re-
 gime to seek refuge in the ap-
 pointment of a committee to "in-
 vestigate" the price situation.
 However, it is doubtful that
 this subterfuge will have much
 popular impact.
 Sudan
 Demonstrations and rioting
 took place on 23 October in Wadi
 Haifa, a Sudanese town on the
 Nile near the Egyptian border.
 This was in part a reaction of
 the local inhabitants to a visit
 by several members of the Suda-
 nese cabinet.   The high-level
 delegation came to present the
 government's decision to resettle
 the more than 50,000 residents
 of the town and the surrounding
 area because the territory will
 become a reservoir when the UAR's
 Aswan High Dam is completed
 several years hence.
 The officials told them
 they are to be resettled at
 Khashm al-Girba, on the Atbara
 River in Kassala Province where
 a new dam and irrigation system
 is to be constructed.  Most
 residents of Wadi Haifa, have
 previously indicated their oppo-
 sition to moving to this area,
 preferring either to resettle
 at,.WAdi al-Khowi on the Nile
 some 200 miles south of their
 present location, or on the
 Northern Gezira plain.
 The riots were serious
 enough to require the use of
 tear gas and police reinforce-
 ments.   By 24 October, how-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 -27 '?October 1960
 The Abboud military govern-
 ment has, nevertheless, blundered
 in its handling of the problem.
 Even if it now reconsiders its
 decision, it has added one more
 element to the various political
 and religious groups which are
 exerting pressure for a return
 to civilian rule.
 Qatar
 The Ruler of the small,.oil-
 producing Persian Gulf state of
 Qatar has abdicated as part of
 an attempt by key members of the
 ruling family to resolve a con-
 test between Sheik Ahmad al-
 Thani, the Ruler's son, and
 Sheik Khalifa Ibn Hamid, the
 Ruler's young nephew. The Ruler,
 in his seventies, no longer takes
 much interest in the government.
 Sheik Ahmad now has been named
 Ruler and Sheik Khalifa, heir
 apparent.
 This arrangement will prob-  25X1
 ably not prove durable, especi-
 ally if-
 Sheik
 Knalira Is to be given control      25X1
 over most of the government
 machinery.   Concerned about
 growing unrest and popular re-
 sentment over the extent and
 flamboyance of expenditures by
 the more than 400 members of
 the ruling family, Khalifa hopes
 to undertake political reforms
 and a substantial economic de-
 velopment program. If opposition
 by Ahmad or other members of the
 ruling family blocks the insti-
 tution of such measures, the
 British, who are the ultimate
 arbiters  of  Qatar politics,
 may  be  confronted   with
 traditional   order.
 THE TURKISH POLITICAL TRIAL
 Turkey's mass political
 trial, which got off to a slug-
 gist start on 14 October, has
 failed either to gain momentum
 or capture popular enthusiasm.
 The military regime faces the
 problem of removing a constant
 threat to itself without alien-
 ating the Turkish people or
 seriously damagin"  Turkish
 prestige abroad. Member} of the
 ruling Committee of National
 Union (CNU) appear.. to feel that
 Turkey as a nation:. and they as
 its leaders are as much on trial
 as the members of'the regime
 they ousted on 27 May 1960.
 The primary attention thus
 far in the trial has been fo-
 cused on an Afghan hound sold
 by ex-President  Bayar, an al-
 leged illegitimate child of
 ex-Premier Menderes, and the
 destructive anti-Greek  riots
 of 1955.   The CNU appears to
 have blundered in opening the
 long-heralded political trial
 with a charge of "dog thievery,"
 with  which it apparently in-
 tended to denigrate  Bayar and
 Menderes personally.
 At the present rate, the
 trial, which involves about 500
 defendants and required months
 of investigation and preparation,
 will last so long that the key
 defendants are more likely  to
 meet death from old age than
 from the hangman's noose. As
 the trial drags on, friction
 will probably increase between
 the procedurally correct judges
 and the impatient military. Un-
 less publicity regarding the
 trial is handled more effective-
 ly, the entire venture may back-
 fire  on the present regime.
 The CNU is showing sensi-
 tivity to foreign and domestic

 criticism.  Farmers in the east-
 central province of Kutahya were
 reported to have set fire to
 the forests in the area to pro-
 test the possible execution of
 Menderes.  Pro-Menderes elements
 in the tightly packed Istanbul
 slums are another potential dan-
 ger.   Elements of the Third Army
 apparently either have been or
 soon will be moved into the
 Istanbul area from eastern Tur-
 key as a security precaution.
 The army may be expected to
 crush ruthlessly any group en-
 dangering domestic stability.
 The government has can-
 celed all leaves for the Turk-
 ish National Police for the
 duration of the trial.  The
 police are reluctant to take
 forceful action against popular
 demonstrators because they bore
 the brunt of popular criticism
 growing out of the repression
 of demonstrations before the
 coup.   None of the groups known
 to be critical of the trial ap-
 pears to have the potential for
 mounting a successful counter-
 coup.                   Nonetheless, subversive
 activity, including distribu-
 tion of leaflets.,. posters, and
 threatening letters, continues.
 Opposition to death sen-
 tences for political prisoners
 is increasing in Turkish polit-
 ical circles.   Many Turks fear
 that such action would pave the
 way for future retaliation against
 both the CNU and the Republican
 Peoples' party and would damage
 the further development of Turk-
 ish democracy.  They are also
 concerned over the effect on
 Turkey's prestige abroad.
 Meanwhile, economic stag-
 nation which has plagued the
 country since the coup appears to
 be easing somewhat with a par-
 tial renewal of public confidence
 and the prospects of a record
 wheat crop.  Although domestic
 economic prospects appear bright-
 er, however, Turkey faces a
 significant cash deficit in its
 balance of payments, and Turk-
 ish officials are again sug-
 gesting the need for substantial
 foreign economic aid and a
 further rescheduling of foreign
 debt repayments.

 the US-backed stabilization
 program--despite demands for
 the replacement of Economy Mini-
 ster Alsogaray--but made some
 conciliatory changes in army
 appointments.   War Secretary
 Larcher,  special target of Army
 Commander in Chief General
 Carlos Toranzo Montero, was re-
 placed'by General Rosendo Fraga.
 A new chief of staff was also
 appointed.
 Frondizi established a
 high-level committee under the
 minister of defense to hear con-
 structive suggestions from the
 military on government policy.
 Following several meetings with
 Frondi21, this group announced
 that the armed forces support
 the economic stabilization pro-
 gram but are critical of its
 implementation.   This was a dip-
 lomatically softened version of
 earlier army charges that the
 program was handicapped by in-
 efficiency, graft, and the polit-
 i.cal'. maneuvers of some off i-
 cials trying to woo Peronista
 electoral support for forth-
 coming elections.
 These charges were partly
 responsible for the dismissal
 of Arturo Sabato, executive di-
 rector of the state oil company
 (YPF).   Sabatohad clashed with
 retired General Pedro Charpy,
 unofficial army representative
 on YPF's board of directors,
 over YPF's efficiency and poli-
 cies.   Charpy also objected to
 YPF's plans to solicit offers
 from foreign oil companies to
 operate on a production-type
 contract basis in the south
 flank of the Comodoro Rivadavia
 area, which he maintained should
 be exploited by YPF itself.
 While the majority of the armed
 forces do not object to Frondizi's
 policy--begun in 1958--of per-
 mitting foreign companies to
 participate in oil development
 on a contract basis, Charpy's
 complaints over specific details
 helped spark the recent crisis.
 To expedite action on an-
 other  major military concern--
 Communist influence in labor,
 the universities, and in pro-
 vincial governments--Frondizi
 on 18 October established a
 special commission to investi-
 gate Communist activities.
 Since then, the police re-
 portedly have arrested more
 than 100 Communists in nation-
 wide raids, and the government
 is unofficially reported to have
 asked the USSR to reduce its dip-
 lomatic staff from 15 to four,
 the number Argentina has in Mos-
 cow.   Personnel in the six Soviet- 25X1
 bloc missions in Argentina total
 an estimated 200, including some
 50 with diplomatic status.
 ANTIGOVERNMENT VIOLENCE IN VENEZUELA

 Caracas and several provincial

 are on an alert status and
 President Betancourt's three-

 CURREN' INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The student demonstrations
 were promoted by the Venezuelan
 Communists, the Marxist Leftist
 Revolutionary Movement (MIR),
 and elements of the URD, all of
 which are pro-Castro and have
 reportedly received sizable
 subsidies from the Cuban regime
 and maintained close liaison
 with it.   The meetings were
 called to protest the arrest of
 MIR leaders allegedly responsi-
 ble for a press article inciting
 the "popular masses" to over-
 throw Betancourt,
 These three factions have
 allied themselves closely in
 recent weeks, particularly in
 a sporadically violent struggle
 with Betancourt's Democratic
 Action party for control of
 organized labor, as well as in
 demonstrations of support for
 Castro, toward whom Betancourt
 is hostile.  They will probably
 attempt to exploit the govern-
 ment's critical economic dif-
 ficulties, which include a high
 level of unemployment and a con-
 tinuing decline of foreign ex-
 change reserves,
 Early in September, pro-
 Castro URD Foreign Minister
 Arcaya resigned in protest
 against the governmeht's policy
 toward Cuba, but top URD leaders
 have subsequently given at least
 lip service to the necessity of
 maintaining the coalition.  The
 party's growing dissatisfaction
 is reflected, however, in the
 two further resignations of URD
 ministers and URD demands for a
 new government which will carry
 out a "nationalist" policy and
 find solutions to the nation's
 economic problems.   These moves
 suggest the possibility that
 the URD may be considering with-
 drawing from the government at
 all levels and aligning with
 the leftist and Communist opposi-
 tion,
 The armed forces, which for
 the most part are believed loyal
 to Betancourt, apparently favor
 strong action against agitators,
 and responsible moderate groups
 are demanding similar measures.
 This backing will strengthen       25X1
 Betancourt's hand in dealing with
 any unrest from a possible breakup

 chronic Nicaraguan-Honduran
 squabbles over Nicaraguan exile
 activities in Honduras has fur-
 ther increased bitterness over
 the century-old border dispute
 between those countries which
 now is before the International
 Court of Justice (ICJ).   The
 court's decision in the case is
 expected before December and
 could well threaten the govern-
 ment in whichever country loses
 the dispute.
 Nicaraguan President Somoza,
 who has been a special target
 of Castro's hostility, has com-
 plained that Honduran President
 Villeda Morales is only paying
 lip service to the commitments
 he made under an OAS agreement
 in 1958 to control the activi-
 ties of Nicaraguan revolutionary

 groups.    Somoza charges that
 Honduran expulsion of exiles is
 meaningless, since they are al-
 lowed to return, some of them
 directly from Cuba.   Active
 prosecution and neutralization
 of the rebel groups by the
 Villeda government is apparent-
 ly deterred by two factors:
 financial inability to mount
 adequate army operations in the
 :roadless border area and fear
 that strong action might bring
 into open conflict the already
 feuding left and right wings
 of the ruling party, thus jeop-
 ardizing  the constitutional
 government.
 Villeda evidently does not
 take seriously the Nicaraguan
 suggestion that Cuba might use
 the revolutionaries against his
 government, professing to believe
 that Honduras, as a friend of
 all progressive social movements,
 has nothing to fear from them.
 The embassy lees this attitude
 is based at least partly on
 Villeda's awareness of the pro-
 Castro and anti-Somoza attitudes
 of his party's important left
 wing.
 Somoza and Villeda both
 face considerable domestic op-
 position to their respective
 governments, and a clear-cut
 ICJ decision would pose a real
 threat to the administration of
 the losing country, although the
 disputed area is sparsely settled
 and largely undeveloped. Neither
 Nicaragua nor Honduras is polit-
 ically mature enough to accept
 serenely any adverse results of
 a juridical process, and the gov-
 ernment would be held responsi-   25X1
 ble for a defeat.  Honduras be-
 lieves the Somoza government is
 already using alarms over exile
 activity to divert attention from
 what the Villeda government is
 sure will be Nicaragua's "ab-
 ject defeat at The Hague,"
 The six-man civilian-mili-
 tary junta that replaced Presi-
 dent Jose Maria Lemus early on
 26 October in a bloodless coup
 sought immediately to secure
 the backing of the leftist ele-
 ments whose demonstrations last
 August and September critically
 weakened the Lemus administra-

 States and that the military

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 '27 October 1960
 One of these civilian junta
 members; Dr. Fortin Magana, is
 known to have extreme leftist
 tendencies and has reportedly
 announced that all existing rec-
 ognized political parties, as
 well as the previously illegal
 Communist-front group, will be
 permitted to participate in
 elections due in 1962. Public
 reaction to the change of gov-
 ernment has been generally
 apathetic, although there has
 been some rejoicing in the
 streets, apparently over the
 release of all political pris-
 oners.. Junta members told news-
 men that exiles also would be
 permitted to return.   Probably
 most of those being freed or al-
 lowed to return were pro-Castro
 or pro-Communist participants
 in the August and September dis-
 orders.   Press reports that
 Lemus now is in Guatemala are
 unconfirmed.
 The ouster of Lemus prob-
 ably was engineered by followers
 of ex-President Oscar Osorio.
 Colonels Escamilla and Miguel
 Angel Castillo, a junta member,
 are reported to have held weekly
 meetings with Osorio for several
 weeks prior to the coup. Osorio,
 a retired army officer, appears
 to have strong backing in the
 armed forces, which began to
 consider ousting Lemus after
 he showed himself as a weak
 and inept executive in dealing
 with pro-Communist and pro-
 Castro demonstrators who threat-
 ened the government during Au-
 gust and September.   ()sorio
 would almost certainly attempt
 to implement reforms to al-
 leviate the country's deep-
 seated social and economic prob-
 lems.   While Osorio is known to
 be strongly anti-Communist, he
 might attempt to apply some
 radical reform measures.   The
 US Embassy stated last month
 that as president he probably
 would not be as openly pro-US
 or as amenable to US suggestions
 as Lemus was.
 The Soviet  news agency
 TASS commented  almost immedi-
 ,tteiy,   that Lemus  lost au-
 thority  among the people be-
 cause of "his                                                                complete sub-
 mission  to the interests of
 the United  States."  The New
 China News Agency attributed
 the coup to "seething discon-
 tent" with                                                               Lemus for "fol-
 lowing the United States in' its  25X1
 inter: vention ':in Cuba and suppres-
 sion of democratic forces at
 home. "

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 "Chairman Mao's thinking
 is the only correct thinking
 guiding the party, and if one
 separates oneself from it un-
 der any circumstances...mistakes
 are apt to occur."  This eulogy
 to Mao in 1960 contrasts with
 the position taken in 1956 that
 "our party has always held that
 no political parties or indi-
 viduals are free from flaws...
 and our party abhors the deifi-
 cation of the individual." The
 1956 statement was China's
 somewhat reluctant echo of the
 USSR's denigration of Stalin,
 but the gulf between the two
 pronouncements indicates the
 extent to which the cult of the
 individual has flourished of
 late in Communist China.
 This cult is not limited
 to the often repeated boast
 that Mao Tse-tung is the
 "world's greatest contempo-
 rary theoretician of Marxism-
 Leninism," but extends into
 the personal sphere as well.
 "Great, brilliant, wise, com-
 passionate, tender, and trust-
 worthy" are a few of the ad-
 jectives used to describe him.
 The physical prowess of the 67-
 year-old Mao is acclaimed in
 tales of how he swims the
 Yangtze River, and his person-
 al magnetism is extolled by
 visitors "thrilled" to meet
 him.   His frugality and dis-
 dain for personal comfort are
 popular legends, according to
 the Peiping press.   In short,

 '2ussians have taken obvious um-
 brage at this effort.ru-
 shchev felt it necessary to at-
 tack Mao personally at the
 9ucharest meeting last June,
 compared him to Stalin, and
 stated that Mao's theories are
 formulated without any contact
 with reality.   The Chinese del-
 egate angrily retorted that Khru-
 shchev was the one out of touch
 with reality, and a revisionist
 as well.
 Before De-Stalihization
 Mao Tse-tung was one of
 the original founding members
 of the Chinese Communist party
 in 1921 and has been its un-
 disputed leader for the past
 25 years.   Nonetheless, his
 rise to power within the party
 entailed many setbacks and dis-
 appointments,                            including expul-
 sion from the party central
 committee at one time.   When
 Mao won control in 1935 during
 the "Long March," the Commu-
 nists were on the run and at a
 low ebb in their power.   Many
 of the claims now advanced for
 Mao rest simply on the fact
 that he built the party and its
 military machine into a force
 that eventually defeated the
 Nationalists.   Since Mao was
 successful,  he was "correct."
 Although Mao formally as-
 sumed the party chairmanship in
 1938, the leadership cult did
 not develop until the early
 1:940s.   In discussing the edu-
 cation of party members in 1939,
 for example, party theoretician
 Liu Shao-chi wrote:  "The term
 collective leadership and demo-
 cratic centralism means that
 leadership is not an individual
 matter; on the contrary,  the
 leaders are bound by policies
 that have been derived by demo-
 cratic methods."  Liu did not
 extol Mao's virtues at all in
 that article.
 At the seventh party con-
 gress in 1945, however, Liu--
 influenced in part by the So-
 viet glorification of Stalin--
 set forth the authoritative
 view of Mao as China's counter-
 part of the great Stalin: "Our
 party, and this is very impor-
 tant,  is one that now has its
 own great leader, Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung....   He has pointed
 out to the Chinese people, sunk
 in deep misery, the only clear,
 sure road to complete! and thor-
 oughgoing liberation, the Mao
 Tse-tung road."
 The revised party statutes
 which Liu presented to the con-
 gress paid tribute to Mao's al-
 leged contribution to Marxist
 theory:   "The Chinese Communist
 party takes the theories of
 Marxism-Leninism and the com-
 bined principles derived from
 the practical experiences of
 the Communist revolution--the
 thought of Mao Tse-tong--as the
 guiding principles of all its
 work...."
 If Mao was thus elevated
 to the Marxist pantheon,  the
 Chinese were still careful to
 keep him on a level Subordinate
 to Stalin.   Until the Soviet
 dictator's death in 1953,  the
 claims pressed for Mao were
 carefully hedged and for the
 most part unpublicized beyond
 the domestic scene.   A People's
 Daily editorial of 7 March1953
 eulogizing Stalin put Mao in
 the role of the Soviet dictator's
 disciple:   "The Chinese revolu-
 tion achieved victory under the
 leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung,                                                                following the guidance
 of Comrade Stalin."
 After Stalin's death, the
 new leaders in the Kremlin, per-
 haps still unsure themselves or
 hoping to cement the Sino-Soviet
 alliance, apparently thought it
 expedient to make some gestures
 to flatter the Chinese ego.  Be-
 tween May and December 1953,
 several reviews of Mao's works
 appearing in Pravda and Izvestia
 asserted that Mao iad maU_e__fra-

 treasure chest of Marxism-
 Leninism."   The reviewers point-
 ed out, however, that the value
 of Mao's contributions on Marx-
 ism lies'in their application to
 the Chinese scene, and that it
 would be profitable for revolu-
 tionaries in colonial and semi-
 colonial countries to study his
 work;  they did not concede that
 his work had universal signif-
 icance.
 The cult of Mao in China
 flourished after Stalin's death.
 Thus 1hrushchev's denunciation
 of Stalin and the "cult of per-
 sonality" at the Soviet 20th
 party congress in February 1956
 came as a bombshell to the Chi-
 nese Communists.
 Peiping's response was
 carefully thought out.   A Peo-
 ple's Daily editorial of 4
 pri   1956, entitled "On the
 Historical Experience Concern-
 ing the Dictatorship of the
 Proletariat," did not echo the
 emotional tone of Khrushchev's
 denunciation.   Instead, it es-
 sayed a dispassionate discus-
 sion of Stalin's errors and
 concluded that,  his mistakes
 notwithstanding,  Stalin had
 made a great contribution to
 Marxism-Leninism and that his
 writings would continue to be
 studied in China.
 The Chinese were evidently
 embarrassed by the parallels
 many would have drawn between
 Stalin and Mao; it was deemed
 necessary to congratulate the
 Soviet party for correcting its
 mistakes but to imply that
 Peiping had not fallen into
 similar errors,  inasmuch as
 the Chinese Communist party
 relied "on the wisdom of the
 masses of the people."
 Peiping did little that
 really detracted from Mao Tse-
 tung's stature in the subse-
 quent period,  although it made
 some show of stress on "collec-
 tive leadership." At the eighth
 party congress, which met in
 September 1956, the allusion
 to "the thought of Mao Tse-tung"
 was removed from the party stat-
 utes.   Nonetheless,  speeches
 at the congress were filled with
 laudatory references to the
 party chairman, and Teng Hsiao-
 ping, who presented the new
 party statutes,  stated,  "Marx-
 ism has never denied the role
 of outstanding individuals or
 the role of leaders within the
 party."
 In at least one respect,
 de-Stalinization was apparently
 responsible for a significant
 modification in Mao's own con-
 cept of his role as a leader;
 he appeared to think it more
 necessary than ever to project
 the image of a leader whose
 ear was always attuned to "the
 wisdom of the masses,"  From
 his assumption of power in 1949
 through 1956, Mao apparently
 had made only ten trips outside
 Peiping, but in 1957 alone he
 made 13 trips to the hinter-
 land, and from 1958 to date he
 has made even more inspection
 tours away from the capital. So
 far this year, Mao has spent
 less than half his time in Pei-
 ping.
 Between 1956 and early
 1958, Peiping's propaganda or-
 gans continued to treat Mao
 deferentially, although in a
 more muted tone than before
 de-Stalinization.   The prop-
 aganda was not entirely suc-
 cessful in creating the in-
 tended public image of Mao.
 The party leaders were clearly
 shocked by the anti-Mao senti-
 ments voiced by a few fool-
 hardy intellectuals during the
 "hundred flowers" campaign in
 1957.   According to the Com-
 munist press, criticisms of
 the Chinese leader included
 such statements as "Chairman
 Mao loves to be great and
 meritorious," "meets only those
 who seek to please him," is
 "hot-tempered," "impetuous,"
 and "reckless," and "assumes
 the air of a benevolent god."

 27 October .1960
 There is probably some
 truth in these charges; how-
 ever,  the infrequency of purg-
 es among senior Chinese Commu-
 nist leaders over the past 25
 years suggests that Mao does
 not suffer from the paranoia
 which plagued Stalin.
 Great Leap Forward
 In 1958, Communist China
 inaugurated sweeping economic
 and social changes which were
 hailed as harbingers of a
 utopia: the "great leap for-
 ward" was begun, and most of
 the rural Chinese were reorgan-
 ized into communes.   Peiping's
 aggressive, brash efforts were
 probably predicated on the
 leaders' grim realization of
 the tremendous problems which
 China faced in attempting to
 transform itself quickly into
 a modern,  industrialized na-
 tion.   Desperate measures
 seemed called for, and, in an
 effort to obtain a maximum ef-
 fort from the people, the re-
 gime began to rely heavily on
 "Maoism"--the term used by Pei-
 ping to designate the theoret-
 ical writings of Mao as well as
 his personal qualities as a
 leader.
 An example of the treat-
 ment accorded the party chair-
 man in this period is the speech
 Liu Shao-chi made in May 1958
 before the second session of the
 eighth party congress.   Liu
 credited Mao personally with
 the speed-up of the First Five-
 Year Plan, the proposals in the
 draft program for agricultural
 development, and for progress
 in general.   As Liu saw it,  Mao-
 ism was basic to future economic
 development; achievements would
 come more easily because of "the
 practical experience gained in
 the people's. struggle and of the
 development of MaoTse-tung's
 thinking in the past few years."
 In June 1958 the regime
 launched w major program to pro-
 mote the study of Mao's works.
 Millions of persons spent sev-
 eral hours a week attempting to
 understand Maoism.   The party
 apparently had two objectives:
 to rebuild confidence among
 those whose faith was shaken
 during the antirightist campaign
 of 1957-58 and to inculcate en-
 thusiasm for the new leap-for-
 ward program.
 An attempt to personalize
 the lofty figure of Mao was also
 made.   A spate of articles on
 the theme "I knew Chairman Mao
 when..." appeared in the press.
 Most of these reminiscences,
 written by soldiers who had ac-
 companied the party chairman on
 the Long March or before, were
 filled with tales of his kind-
 ness and consideration.   They
 all included such statements as,
 "I felt in him the love of a
 father."
 Peiping's drive in 1958
 for unparalleled progress fell
 short of its objectives.   Al-
 though much economic headway
 had been made, there was con-
 siderable popular discontent
 with the communes, which had
 been organized too hastily.
 Furthermore, the regime's gran-
 diose scheme to double its iron
 and steel output by establish-
 ing "backyard" furnaces in the
 communes failed miserably.
 In December 1958 Mao Tse-
 tung announced his decision to
 retire as chief of state and in-
 dicated that he wished to de-
 vote his time to writing and
 study and to his duties as par-
 ty chairman.   Tempting though
 it may be to link Mao's resig-
 nation from the government to
 the failure of programs closely
 associated with his name, there
 is no evidence that his author-
 ity had been challenged or that
 his control over the party had
 slipped.
 It is true, on the other
 hand, that the emphasis on both
 Maoism and the adulation of Mao

 as an individual slackened dur-
 ing the period of consolidation
 and review in early 1959.   Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai made a major
 address before the National
 People's Congress in April, for
 example,  in which he mentioned
 Mao only three times.   In a sim-
 ilar speech in May 1958,  Liu
 Shao-chi had invoked the lead-
 er's name 21 times.   Feature
 articles in People's Daily ap-
 peared without any ref-erence
 to the party chairman.
 During the first half of
 1059,  statistical teams at-
 tempted to verify the inflated
 production claims for the pre-
 vious year.   The survey of the
 statistical teams showed that
 these claims had been grossly
 overstated. It became obvious
 to all that the 1959 economic
 goals were completely unrealis-
 tic,  and the regime had to de-
 termine whether it would con-
 tinue to operate on the basis
 of false claims or confess its
 errors.   To do the first would
 have entailed maintaining an
 almost impossible fiction and
 made further planning extremely
 difficult.
 The decision to admit the
 exaggeration of production fig-
 ures and targets was made in
 early August 1959.   The central
 committee did not concede that
 Mao had made errors in princi-
 ple; and fiercely castigated
 those who  had. been "viciously
 slandering and attacking... our
 great leap forward and people's
 commune movement...,   They have
 suffered ignominious defeat."
 In this defensive tone the cen-
 tral committee went on to af-
 firm:   "The wisdom and the
 might of the masses is unlim-
 ited.   Enlightened and led by
 the party and Mao Tse-tung,
 this wisdom and might have be-
 come irresistible,,.,"
 The thesis that the party
 and Mao had been right all the
 time was necessary unless there
 was to be a major purge among
 the leaders.   Presumably Mao
 was too strong to challenge,
 or at least too many of the
 other top leaders had jointly
 authored the extremist policies,
 The image of Mao the omniscient
 was again invoked to inspire
 the doubters and the shaken.
 Shortly afterward, at the
 tenth anniversary of the Chi-
 nese Communist regime on 1 Oc-
 tober 1959, extravagant claims
 were put forward of Peiping's
 achievements.   It was in this
 period that the first sweeping
 assertion was made of Mao's
 universal significance, when
 central committee member Liu
 Lan-tao termed him "the most
 prominent Marxist-Leninist rev-
 olutionary,  politician, and
 theorist among all living con-
 temporaries."
 Of greater importance,  by
 autumn of 1959 several disputes
 had developed with Moscow over
 Chinese domestic programs and
 bloc strategy.   The controversy
 gave added impetus to the Chi-
 nese effort to portray Mao as
 the legitimate heir to Lenin,
 It was deemed essential to show
 that the Chinese, not the Zus-
 sians, were the orthodox Marx-
 ists:   Peiping counted heavily
 on Mao's prestige as a theoreti-
 cian to lend authority to its
 arguments.
 Present Image
 A mass movement 'to study
 theory,         launched by the party
 in December 1959, has continued
 to the present,   Mao's thought
 is portrayed as a development
 and perfection of Marxism, and
 the people are told how fortu-

 seems almost to have replaced
 Marxism in emphasis.  Ideolog-

 make it clear that Mao's inter-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Claims for Mao as a Marx-
 ist theorist are closely inter-
 woven with assertions concern-
 ing his ability as a military
 strategist.   The latter claims
 were spotlighted in August 1960
 when the revolutionary Military
 Museum was formally opened in
 Peiping.   According to an arti-
 cle in the regime's English-
 language edition of Peking Re-
 view, the museum epitom zed_
 '  e correct political and mil-
 itary thinking of Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung, our great, respected,
 and beloved leader."  Appropri-
 ately enough,  the motto over the
 entrance,  in eight-foot gold
 letters, "A Single Spark Can
 Start a Prairie Fire" is in
 Mao's calligraphy and is the
 title of one of his books.
 Additional emphasis was
 placed on the military aspects
 of Mao's thought with the Octo-
 ber 1960 publication of the
 fourth volume of his Selected
 Works, which deals wi     Ee
 UH'Inese civil war and revolu-
 tion.   The commentary and re-
 views of the book use Mao's
 analysis of the civil war to
 defend Peiping's position in
 the present Sino-Soviet dispute.
 To do this, they first en-
 deavor to demonstrate that Mao's
 writings have the stature of the
 other Marxist scriptures.   This
 demonstration is accomplished
 mainly by fiat:   "The Mao Tse-
 tung ideology is Marxism-Lenin-
 ism in its fullest developed
 form in the era of the socialist
 revolution by the proletariat";
 i.e., Mao is the greatest theo-
 rist since Lenin.   Such asser-
 tions do not sit well with the
 Soviet Union.
 Maoism has reached such
 heights in Communist China that
 it seems a permanent part of
 the political landscape--to re-
 main as long as Mao does, and
 perhaps longer.   After the par-
 ty chairman's death or polit-
 ical demise, especially if his
 successor wants to improve re-
 lations with the USSR, it is
 possible that a re-evaluation
 will take place, as in the case
 of Stalin.   If the successor
 wishes to maintain present Chi-
 nese positions against Moscow,
 however,  he will have no choice
 but to retain "Maoism," Peiping's
 pretensions to ideological lead-
 ership will depend heavily on     25X1
 the acceptance of Mao in the
 Communist pantheon.
 As the UN General Assem-
 bly moves toward consideration
 of the Algerian issue, the con-
 tending forces remain stalemated,
 although the pressures on them
 are apparently becoming more in-
 tense.   The rebels continue un-
 der severe French military pres-
 sure, but have received addi-
 tional backing in recent ap-
 proaches to Moscow and Peiping,
 and are almost certain to have
 substantial Afro-Asian support
 in the General Assembly for
 their effort "to international-
 ize" the conflict,

 France's official position, but
 there appears to be a growing
 diversity of French views.   Pop-
 ular opinion now seems to be
 swinging in favor of political
 negotiations with the rebels
 and even toward eventual inde-
 pendence for Algeria, but army
 sentiment is still adamant a-
 gainst such negotiations,  and
 rightist leaders have in the
 past few months become more in-
 clined to challenge De Gaulle
 directly on this issue.
 Despite the apparently
 hopeful evolution of negoti-
 ating positions on each side
 since Do Gaulle came to power,

 both French and rebel positions
 have hardened since the failure
 of preliminary talks at Melun
 in June.   The rebel leaders
 have steadfastly rejected a
 cease-fire without prior polit-
 ical guarantees for the future
 of their movement, and De Gaulle
 has held to his stand that fight-
 ing must cease before political
 terms can be discussed.
 Military Situation
 The approximately 440,000
 French military forces in Al-
 geria--of which about one quar-
 ter are Moslems--confront ap-
 proximately 15,000 rebels dis-
 persed in small units.   An es-
 timated 10,000 other rebel
 soldiers are in Tunisia and
 6,000 in Morocco, but the elec-
 trified barriers which the
 French constructed along both
 borders have made it-increas-
 ingly difficult for rebel re-
 inforcements and supplies to
 enter Algeria.
 ;decent military action
 has been mostly limited to
 minor local operations.                                                                                                                     The
 French claim the level of ter-
 rorist acts in Algeria has
 dropped one third in the past
 year, but the rebels will prob-
 ably continue ambushes, assas-
 sinations, and grenade attacks
 to discourage the emergence of
 a Moslem "third force" willing
 to cooperate with France. Vic-
 tims are far more frequently
 Moslems than Europeans.   The
 rebel underground terrorist
 organization in France on 23
 October renewed its attacks on
 the French police, apparently
 as a demonstration of its abil-
 ity to "carry the war into
 France itself."
 The Melun negotiations
 were broken off primarily be-
 cause of rebel demands to be
 treated as representatives of
 a government, and the Provi-
 sional Algerian Government
 (PGAR) has not modified its
 conditions since then.   It has,
 however, intensified its ef-
 forts to internationalize the

 conflict.   Premier Ferhat Abbas'
 recent trip to Peiping's Na-
 tional Day celebrations and
 two stopovers in Moscow on his
 first visit to the Communist
 bloc were designed to show the
 West that the rebels are in
 earnest when they say they will
 accept Communist aid if neces-
 sary in their fight for inde-
 pendence.   Abbas and his group,
 like a previous rebel delegation
 to Peiping last spring, were
 accorded an enthusiastic recep-
 tion and had several conferences
 with top Chinese officials.   A
 joint communique  of 5 October
 affirmed Peiping's intention to
 give "total assistance and its
 support to the Algerian people
 in pursuit and intensification
 of its armed struggle."
 The USSR, which previously
 maintained a "neutral" stand so
 as not to alienate De Gaulle,
 has dropped its cautious atti-
 tude toward the PGAR.   Abbas
 held talks with high Soviet of-
 ficials in Moscow both en route
 to and returning from his visit
 to Peiping.   Khrushchev, at his
 own initiative, met with mem-
 bers of the Algerian rebel
 "delegation" while in New York,
 and on 7 October
 extended de facto
 recognition to the
 PGAR.
 Tunisia and
 Morocco are support-
 ing the rebels' at-
 tempts "to interna-
 tionalize" the war,
 partly through ef-
 forts to get the UN
 more directly in-
 volved.   Leaders of
 both countries see
 in the UN's Congo
 operations a prece-
 dent they feel
 could be useful in
 solving the Algerian
 problem.   Tunisian
 President Bourgui-
 ba's vague proposal
 of "union" between
 his government and
 the rebels' regime was appar-
 ently offered as a means either
 of jarring De Gaulle into some
 further proposals or of provok-
 ing French incursions into Tu-
 nisian territory which would
 permit a new appeal to the UN
 for protection.
 In addition, Bourguiba
 has recently said that he would
 facilitate the passage of arms
 and volunteers from any source
 to help in the liberation of
 Algeria.   Morocco, anxious not
 to seem less pro-PGAR than
 Tunisia, has magnified several
 recent violations of its terri-
 tory by French troops in Al-
 geria and has publicly consid-
 ered various means of retalia-
 tion.
 While no change has been
 made in the official French
 policy favoring self--determi-
 nation for Algeria, there has
 been a considerable modifica-
 tion of French opinions on the
 subject of Algeria.   De Gaulle's
 constant'  repetition of the
 self-determination and "Algeri-
 an Algeria" themes--sometimes
 on occasions which seemed
 The future of Algeria rests with the Algerians, not as thrust upon
 them by machine gun and knife, but according to the wishes which they
 will freely express through universal suffrage.... The three arrangements
 which it is possible to conceive of will be the object of the consultation.
 One of these would be secession, where some believe independence would
 reside, France would then leave the Algerians, who would have expressed
 their wish to become separated from her.  They would organize, without
 her, the territory in which they live, the resources which they have at
 their call, the government which they desire.... Or else, out-and-out

 Or else, the government of Algeria by Algerians, backed up by French

 contacts with one another.  We want them to look the situation in the
 face, which is to say, to see the necessity of developing Algeria. Later,

 them and for us.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 October 1960
 propitious for spelling out
 further steps--has disappointed
 many who had pinned their hopes
 on a bold  new move to settle
 the question.   The mounting
 frustration in France over the
 Algerian issue has combined
 with discontent on economic
 and other issues to bring De
 Gaulle under the heaviest po-
 litical attack since he came
 to power.
 The spectacular trial in
 September of the "Jeanson net-
 work" of French supporters of
 the Algerian rebels has been
 seized on by leftist, liberal,
 and clerical groups to express
 opposition to the army's meth-
 ods of conducting the war. Calls
 for peace negotiations--in some
 cases even on the rebels' terms
 --have been issued by the prin-
 cipal labor unions and the for-
 merly pro - De Gaulle Socialist
 party.   Teachers' associations
 and the Catholic hierarchy have
 expressed concern for the youths
 compelled to participate in the
 war, and a "manifesto" by a
 group of leading intellectuals
 goes so far as to proclaim the
 right of soldiers to desert a
 wrong cause.
 Rightist leaders have
 countered with appeals for the
 maintenance of French Algeria
 and to patriotism--as in the
 case of the manifesto of 200
 writers, teachers, and French
 Academy members  includin
 Marshal Juin.
 On balance, De Gaulle's
 campaign has succeeded in win-
 ning broad popular support for
 his self-determination policy.
 Most Frenchmen would probably
 accept a carefully handled
 French initiative leading to
 political negotiations with the
 rebels or even to Algerian in-
 dependence.
 Such a move, however, would
 depend on the army, which has
 probably been the principal
 single force limiting ;De Gaulle's
 freedom to solve the Algerian
 problem.   The majority of the
 officer corps appears to be com-
 ing around to the idea that Al-
 gerian independence is inevitable.
 These officers would not acqui-
 esce in any negotiated settle-
 ment requiring the army's with-
 drawal from Algeria, however,
 until they were certain that
 European settlers and ;pro-French
 Moslems were in no danger.from
 rebel elements.
 The army is further con-
 cerned to have at least the ap-
 pearance of a victory over the
 rebels.  Although a number of
 "activists" wish to overturn
 De Gaulle, they could not drag
 the remainder into an overt
 move against him unless he af-
 forded a clear-cut pretext which
 could be interpreted by them
 as a "sellout"' to the rebels,

 ness is doubtful thus far, but
 they at least constitute a prec-

 Moslems on  nonpolitical issues.

 Plan for Algerian economic de-
 velopment announced by De Gaulle
 in October 1958 has not yet
 been formalized, some new indus-

 been attracted.   Pro-

 of Saharan petroleum
 have been stepped up
 with the completion
 of two 24-inch pipe-
 lines between the oil
 fields and the Med-
 iterranean, and pe-
 troleum exports now
 are approaching an
 annual rate of
 6,000,000 tons. Ma-

 been made on con-
 struction of the

 increase in UN members with an

 that this session will pass a
 resolution on Algeria that goes
 far beyond the 1956 and 1957 ex-
 pressions of hope that a solu-
 tion might be found through
 negotiations.
 With the support of the
 African states belonging to the
 French Community, a resolution
 calling for a UN-conducted ref-

 the necessary two-thirds major-

 other members of the Afro-Asian

 India, and Ghana--has already
 begun to influence some of these
 French Community states, although
 counterpressures may be exerted

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 October.1960
 The special weakness of
 France's position in the UN
 this year is that, unless pro-
 French Houphouet-Boigny can
 devise some suitable plan at
 the Abidjan meeting, there will
 probably be no moderating in-
 fluence on the Algerian issue
 from Asian or African UN mem-
 bers,   Unless such a moderat-
 ing influence soon develops,
 it is doubtful that a resolu-
 tion mild enough to be accept-
 able to France's allies will be
 proposed.
 There is a possibility
 that an anti-French UN vote,
 particularly if a resolution
 calls for the UN's physical
 presence in Algeria in any form,
 might produce a new solidarity
 in France behind another govern-
 ment attempt to solve the Alge-
 rian problem as an "internal"
 question,   French press specu-
 lation is running to predictions
 of a move to resume negotiations
 with the rebels--possibly even
 before the UN debate--or,  if
 such negotiations fail, to mateI r
 srl.izd, of new steps by the French
 to create institutions for self-
 government along "Algerian Al-
 geria" lines.
 In line with the latter pos-
 sibility, Premier Debre  has
 hinted that if the military sit-
 uation is basically unchanged by
 spring, the government may take
 the initiative to assure great-
 er local representation in ad-
 ministration.   In either of these
 cases, one motive would be to
 build up a responsible Moslem
 group which might ultimately be
 able to treat with the rebels,
