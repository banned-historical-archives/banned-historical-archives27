 HIGHLIGHTS
 PARIS TALKS:  I'RG Jelegat Lon nf'nd MLnc. Nguyen Th.l Binh, bacl` at the
 57th seas ion of the talks at't' c her ah sencc the previous week, devoted
 her statement to routine crlticism o.t' the rolled pac:Lrication program.
 DRV representative Nguyen M.lnr' Vy reviewed the corrununiut position on
 the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the formation of a provisional.
 coalition government in a serien of queut:lons addressed to the U.S.
 delegation.
 As usual recounting only the proceedings and ignoring the post-session
 press briefing, Vietnamese communist media take no note of DRV spokes-
 man Le Quang Hiep's statement at the briefing that Le Due Tho is still
 "resting" in France or of his noncommittal reply to questions about an
 alleged remark by Soviet Ambassador Zorin, reported in the Western press,
 to the effect that the communist side might withdraw from the talks.
 WAR CRIMES COMMUNIQUE:  A communique from the DRV War Crimes Commission,
 publicized by VNA on 4 March, routinely reviews alleged U.S. "crimes" in
 February, charging the United States with civilian "massacres," use of
 toxic agents, and air raids in South Vietnam and condemning U.S.
 reconnaissance flights and air attacks in the North.
 MOSCOW PROPAGANDA:  Stereotyped propaganda scores Vietnamization as part
 of a U.S. policy of continuing the war and intervening militarily in
 Indochina.  U.S. critics of the Administration are quoted routinely.  Thus
 TASS promptly notes Senator Muskie's 5 March statement at the National
 Press Club that Vietnamization can perpetuate the war and his call for
 the appointment of a new senior representative to the Paris talks.
 SOUTH VIETNAM:  Communist media report scattered actions throughout the
 South.  LIBERATION PRESS AGENCY (LPA) claims on 4 March that these actions
 bear out the "assessment" that the communists are thwarting the
 Vietnamization and pacification programs "step by step" by "dealing
 repeated blows" at the allies.  A Liberation Radio broadcast on the 10th
 says action in the delta exposes the "critical" situation of allied
 Vietnamization and pacification efforts and alleges that several ARVN
 units have been "wiped out" in the area since American troops were
 withdrawn from the delta.
 There is continuing propaganda on the arrest and trial of Saigon
 legislator Tra.. Ngoc Chau.  A NHAN DAN article on 9 March cites the
 Chau case along with other examples of "repression" of Thieu opponents
 and of the Saigon press, charging that the Thieu "clique" stands in the
 way of "the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and freedom"
 and that the people are resolved to overthrow it.

 ANNIVERSARY. OBSERVANCES IN DRV :  VNA reports on 11 March that the VWP
 Secretariat has issued a circular on the celebration of the 20th
 anniversary of the 19 March "day of struggle against U.S. imperialism."
 The circular says the celebrations will denounce "U.S. aggression,"
 particularly Vietnemization.  The 22 April Lenin birth centenary also
 gets propaganda attention:  In honor of the Lenin anniversary VNA
 on 5 March releases a Ho Chi Minh interview on "Lenin and the Vietnam
 Revolution," granted in "early July" 1969 to a correspondent of the
 French CP organ L'HUMANITE.
 PARIS TALKS:  5 MARCH SESSION
 PRG ATTACK ON    Returning to the Paris talks after an unexplained absence
 PACIFICATION     last week, chief PRG delegate Mme. Nguyen Thi Binh
 focused her statement at the 57th session on the allied
 pacification program. She repeated the standard line that U.S.
 pacification policy for the past 15 years has been "nothing but using
 violence so as to impose U.S. neocolonialist domination upon the South
 Vietnamese people."  In implementing this policy, she charged, the
 United States and Saigon have "spared no brutal methods," including the
 use of air strikes, toxic chemical sprayings, ground sweep operations,
 and "complete destruction of villages, massacre and terrorism against
 the population" exemplified by the Sor. My incident and other "sanguinary
 mass murders" committed in South Vietnam.  She provided a graphic account
 of "atrocities" when she again dwelt on incidents alleged to have
 occurred in the course of "operation Sea Tiger" in Quarlg Nam Province in
 November 1969.*  In the urban areas, Mme. Binh said, pacification policy
 is manifest by the GVN's "ruthless" terrorization of all urban social
 strata.  She also noted the recent arrest and trial in Saigon of deputy
 Tran Ngoc Chau, echoing earlier propaganda to the effect that it further
 exposed the "despotic and fascist character" of the leaders in Saigon.
 As usual, Mme. Binh insisted that the only "honorable" way out of Vietnam
 for the United States would be rapid, total, and unconditional withdrawal
 of American forces from South Vietnam and the "giving up" of the Thieu-
 Ky-Khiem administration.  Correct settlement of the war, she added
 routinely, can come only when the United States responds seriously to
 the NFLSV's 10-point solution.
 *  The alleged massacre in Quang Nam in November 119 9, earlier condemned
 in a 15 January War Crimes Commission statement, is also denounced by
 LPA in a 7 March report listing alleged victims.

 11 MARCH 1970
 DRV QUESTIONS ON    The VNA account of the session notes that DRV
 ALLIED POSITION     representative Nguyen Minh Vy asked the U.S.
 delegation a number of questions regarding the two
 "crucial" issues--U.S. troop withdrawal and a political settlement.
 VNA fully reports all the "questions" on these issues, including:
 "When will the United States accept the principle of withdrawing
 U.S. troops and those of the other foreign countries in the U.S.
 camp from South Vietnam without posing any conditions?"  He also
 asked whether the U.S. side will actually withdraw all personnel
 without exception and whether it will accept the six-month period for
 withdrawal as proposed by the PRG delegation.  On the matter of
 political settlement, Vy similarly asked:  "When will the United
 States accept the formation of a provisional coalition government
 so that this government might organize free and democratic general
 elections in South Vietnam?"
 VNA reports Vy's charge that "until now the U.S. delegate has not
 seriously met these questions of principle."  It also quotes his
 assertion that if the United States seriously answers the questions,
 "all concrete problems would be discussed and appropriately settled,
 and on the basis of the 10-point overall solution of the NFLSV and PRG,
 all parties would speedily come to an understanding to sign agreements,
 to end the war, and to restore peace in South Vietnam."
 VNA's report includes some of Vy's remarks on Laos, noting, for example,
 that he asked:  "If the Nixon Administration really wants to get the
 United States out of tha war in Vietnam, why is it involved even more
 deeply in the war in Laos?"
 ALLIED SPEECHES     Giving the customary short shrift to the allied
 delegates' remarks, VNA comments parenthetically
 that "as in previous sessions, the more the U.S. and puppet delegates
 spoke, the more clearly they revealed their aggressive and traitorous
 nature."  The account says Pham Dang Lam "tried to conceal the U.S.
 acts of downgrading the Paris conference with a view to sabotaging it,"
 adding that he "bally-hooed" about the U.S.-GVN side's good will and
 "brazenly blamed" the DRV and PRG side for lacking good will.  Further,
 according to VNA, Lam "shamelessly rehashed the oft-rejected arguments
 about the so-called mutual withdrawal, free elections, etc."
 VNA notes curtly that "Philip Habib"--his position unidentified--tried
 to "evade the fundamental questions which had been raised in the fair
 and reasonable 10-point overall solution."  Instead, VNA complains, he
 spoke of the POW problem and "continued to slander" the DRV and PRG
 and to "distort the correct stand and serious attitude of the
 Vietnamese people."

 CONTINUED CRITICISM OF PRESIDENTIAL REPORT
 The propaganda attack on the President's 18 February foreign policy
 report continues in a Hanoi Radio commentary broadcast on 5 March and in
 a Liberation Radio commentary of the 9th which adds nothing to prior
 Front comment.
 Repeating some of the earlier DRV comment, the Hanoi radio talk also takes
 up the report's listing of five factors conducive--in Hanoi's words--to
 the Vietnamese people's "ultimate surrender" to the United States.  The
 broadcast alludes here to the passage in the presidential report to the
 effect that "allied military pressures, uncertainties in its international
 support, strains within North Vietnam, the recent display of American
 public support for a just peace, and the strengthening of the South
 Vietnamese government under Vietnamization all argue for (the communist
 side) seeking a settlement now."  Arguing that these five "illusionary"
 points are based on a false premise, the commentary says that allied
 military forces have in the past been linable to cope with communist
 forces and that there is no reason to believe this situation will change
 with Vietnamization.  International support for the DRV-PRG side, it
 adds, was clearly manifest at Ho Chi Minh's funeral, among other occasions.
 The Hanoi commentary reacts to the report's reference to "strains within
 North Vietnam," saying the President "invented the fable about disunity
 within the Vietnamese people's ranks."  As for increased U.S. public
 support for the Administration, Hanoi says that President Nixon is "well
 aware" of the size of last fall's antiwar demonstrations and recalls that
 the Democratic Party's policy council recently called for an
 unconditional withdrawal of U.S. forces within an 18-month period.
 Concerning the strengthening of the GVN, the commentary says the "real
 situation" of the Saigon Administration, as brought out many times in
 U,S. press and political circles, is that "it is nothing but a corrupt,
 cruel, and extremely rotten regime which owes its existence to U.S.
 bayonets and dollars."
 INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY
 Celebrating the 60th International Women's Day (8 March) with a "grand
 meeting" on the 7th in Hanoi, the DRV concurrently marked the ninth
 anniversary of the founding of the South Vietnam Liberation Women's
 Union and sent a letter to women in the South.  In addition to recounting
 the meetings and letter, Hanoi radio lists women who were awarded
 Uncle Ho's insignia by President Ton Duc Thang for "outstanding
 achievements," and VNA says on the 6th that the liberation of North
 Vietnam and the building of socialism have enabled DRV women to "give
 full scope to their abilities and exercise their equal rights with

 men in all sphered."  Also on the 6th, Hanoi radio reports an appeal from
 the Vietnamese Women's Union to women throughout the world denouncing
 Vietnamization, U.S. refusal to withdraw from South Vietnam, and
 alleged U.S. violation of DRV sovereignty and security.
 A flurry of South Vietnamese communist propaganda marks the coincident
 international and South Vietnam Liberation Women's Union anniversaries
 with a report--carried by Liberation Radio on the 8th--of a 7 March meeting
 of the women's union and a letter from Nguyen Huu Tho to the union and
 all southern women.  Praising the women's achievements and calling on
 them to continue fighting, Tho's letter also says the armed forces and
 people must be "educated and mobilized to achieve a deep change and
 extraordinary effort" in defeating pacification and Vietnamization.
 Although Nguyen Huu Tho continues to be cited as the author of frequent
 messages, he has not been reported to have made a public appearance since
 his departure from the Soviet Union on 22 November 1969.  His absence from
 public view during this period meant that he missed, for the first time,
 the December anniversary of the NFLSV.  Such an extended absence is not
 without precedent for Tho:  He made no publicized appearances during a

 HA~JOI APPLAUDS. MOSCOW IXDERP AYS, PEKING IGNORES MAX PLAN
 The five-point proposal for a Laotian settlement advanced by the Pathet
 Lao following the communist military victories in the Plain of Jars was
 announced first by an NLHX representative in Hanoi.       It was first
 released by VNA on 6 March, the day before it was announced in the
 Pathet Lao's own media--a reversal of the normal sequence.  While Hanoi
 has enthusiastically supported the NLHX proposal, in a government
 statement and comment including a NHAN DAN editorial, Moscow at first
 merely reported the NLHX Central Committee statement in which the
 proposal was advanced but cautiously avoided acknowledging any details,
 neglecting even to mention that it contained five points.   Moscow
 waited two days to mention the five-point proposal, in reports that
 the DRV supported it, and discussed the substance of the points-- .
 approvingly--only after reporting Hanoi's favorable reaction.  Peking
 has reported the NLHX Central Committee statement but suppressed
 the fact that it contained any peace plan, instead playing up the
 NLHX charges of "U.S. aggression" and avowal of intent to continue
 fighting until final victory.
 THE FIVE POINTS     VNA announced on 6 March that the NLHX Central
 Committee statement proposing the five-point
 peace program was read that day at a press conference by the director
 of the NLHX Information Bureau in Hanoi.  The Pathet Lao news agency
 transmitted the statement the following day.  It has been customary
 for officials of the NLHX Information Bureau to announce such state-
 ments in Hanoi, but only after their release in Pathet Lao media.
 Asserting that the NLHX has repeatedly demonstrated its "good will"
 regarding a peaceful settlement, as shown by its 12-point political
 program advanced in 1968* and by the maintenance of its representation
 in Vientiane, the statement affirms "the necessity of ending the U.S.
 war and finding a political solution to the Laotian problem."  The
 five points include:
 +  The routine Pathet Lao demand that the United States. end its
 "intervention" and "aggression," stop escalating the war, "completely
 cease" bombing, and withdraw its advisers and military personnel.
 The Pathet Lao news agency reported on 23 November 1968 that the
 12-point political program was adopted at the third national congress
 of the NLHX held 25 October to 1 November.  It is a broad platform dealing
 with such matters as economic policy, religion, minority policies, women's
 equality, and culture, as well as with political questions.

 +  The declaration that Laos, in accord with the 1962 Geneva agreement,
 mast refrain from joining military alliances and from allowing foreign
 countries to establish military bases on its soil.       This stipulation
 was included as point 12 of the 12-point program.
 +  A pledge to "respect the throne, to hold free and democratic general
 elections, to elect a national assembly and set up a democratic govern-
 ment of national union truly representative of the Laotian people."
 Point one of the 12-point program had promised respect for the throne,
 in keeping with the Pathet Lao's consistent assertion of its loyalty to
 the King; point six pledged to set up a "democratic national union
 government" and to hold general elections for a national assembly.
 +  A call for a "consultative political conference" of "representatives
 of all Laotian parties concerned" to deal with Laotian affairs and "set
 up a provisional coalition government" during the period from "the
 restoration of peace to the general elections to the national assem-'l.y."
 The NLHX says a "security zone" must be established to ensure the normal
 functioning of the consultative conference and provisional government
 "free from all attempts at sabotage or pressure by forces from inside
 or outside Laos."  The 12-point program did not mention a "provisional
 coalition government," but such a proposal was made in a "working
 program" read by Col. Deuane at the Patriotic Neutralist Forces' (PNF)
 first national political conference in April 1969.  As carried by the
 PNF radio on 2 June 1969, this document called on "all forces whose
 interests concern the deRtiny of the nation" to cooperate in the
 formation of a "temporary national coalition government."  It proposed
 that an elected national assembly subsequently form a "national
 coalition government."
 +  Finally, the five-point program states that unification of Laos must
 be achieved through consultations of the "Laotian parties" and that
 pending unification, "no party shall use force to encroach upon areas
 controlled by another"; "pro-American" forces must withdraw from areas
 they have "illegally" occupied and resettle and pay compensation to
 people "forcibly removed" from their native places; and each party
 must "refrain from discrimination and reprisals against those who have
 collaborated with another party."
 Elsewhere in the Central Committee statement--not in the five points
 themselves--the assertion is made that a peaceful settlement must be
 "based on" the 1962 Geneva agreements and the "actual situation" in
 Laos.  The statement also says the Laotian problem must be settled
 "among the Lao parties concerned."  For these parties to "meet," it
 declares, the United States must, "as an immediate step, stop escalating
 the war and stop completely the bombing of Lao territory without posing
 any condition."  This is a slight expansion of phraseology which has
 been in use since an NLHX Ceatral Committee statement of 22 July 1968,

 marking the sixth anniversary of the signing of the 1962 Geneva agree-
 ments.  The 1968 statement demanded that the United States end
 intervention, and aggression, "first of all" stopping the bombing
 in order to create favorable conditions for the Laotian people to settle
 their on affairs on the basis of the 1962 Geneva agreements and in
 accord with the "actual situation" in Laos.  The 1968 formulation
 omitted a reference to the tripartite agreements which had been standard
 up to that time, substituting the reference to the "actual situation."
 ATTACKS ON     While calling on "the Laotian parties concerned" to meet
 SOUVANNA       to settle the problem, the NLHX statement repeats standard
 attacks on Souvanna personally and on his administration.
 It says the United States "toppled the National Union government which
 had received investitute from the King and recognition in the 1962 Geneva
 agreements" and "rigged up a stooge administration headed by Souvanna
 Phouma."
 Such charges have been a staple of past Pathet Lao propaganda seeking to
 justify the call for a "truly representative" democratic union government.
 A lengthy NLHX Central Committee "memorandum" of 8 July 1969, marking
 the anniversary of the tripartite government and the 1962 Geneva
 agreements, had. said that Souvanna "is no longer the Prime Minister
 of the tripartite government nor leader of the Neutralist Party," his
 party having "integrated itself" into the Rightist Party.
 MESSAGES FROM     Nevertheless, the NLHX followed up the announcement of
 SOUPHANOUVONG     its five-point program by publicizing an "urgent
 message" from its chairman, Prince Souphanouvong, to
 Souvanna Phouma.  According to the Pathet Lao News agency on 9 March,
 the message points to the "grave situation" created by U.S, "escalation"
 and stresses the NLHX's "good will" regarding a peaceful settlement,
 referring to the five-point program.  It says Souphenouvong intends to
 "send to Vientiane at the earliest date possible" a messenger carrying a
 letter to Souvanna, and it solicits Souvanna's "views in this connection"
 so that "necessary arrangements" can be made.  (On the same day AFP
 reported that Souvanna promptly agreed to receive the Pathet Lao messenger
 in a reply transmitted through Soth Pethrasi, the NLHX representative in
 Vientiane,)
 On the 10th the Pathet Lao news agency publicized a similar message from
 Souphanouvong to Khfunsouk Keola, the chairman of the Alliance Committee
 of the PNF.  Later in the day, the Pathet Lao radio carried an NLHX
 Central Committee statement of the preceding day announcing the
 appointment "on 6 March" of it. Col. Pradith Tiengtham as Souphanouvong's
 envoy to deliver letters to the King and Souvanna Phouma.

 11 MARCH 1970
 The last known exchange of messages between Souvanna and Souphanouvong--in
 February 1969, with the Soviet Ambassador as intermediary--had resulted
 in a statement by a spokesman for the NLHX Central Committee criticizing
 Souvanna for making "deceitful statements" and for "making excuses for
 the Americans."
 DRV SUPPORT     A DRV Government statement carried by VNA on 9 March
 applauds the NLHX for advancing "a very important
 initiative which clearly shows its good will and constant desire for
 peace an,?. national concord."  A NHAN DAN editorial follows up the next
 day with sim,!lar praise for the NLHX program as "opening the correct
 way for gett'ling th s situation."  The last previous DRV Government
 statement, on 25 November 1969, had denounced bombings in Cambodia;
 the DRV had not issued a government statement on Laos since
 25 July 1966, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Geneva
 agreement on Laos.
 SOVIET       Moscow has given meager propaganda attention to the 6 March
 CAUTION      NLHX statement, with TASS' initial report brushing over the
 fact that it advanced a peace program and failing to specify
 that the program included five points.  Thus TASS acknowledged on the 7th
 only that the statement called for "a peaceful settlement of the Laotian
 problem based on the 1962 Geneva agreement on Laos and the situation
 existing in Laos."  Moscow does not as a rule pick -up the Pathet Lao's
 references to the "existing situation" in Laos, although it has done so
 on rare occasions in the past.
 Explicit references to the five points first appeared in Soviet media in
 TASS reports on 9 and 10 March of a iiULI, DAN commentary and editorial,
 but neither TASS item spelled out the substance of the points.  Moscow's
 first acknowledgment of the substance appears in a 10 March domestic
 service commentary which briefly reviews the content of the first four
 points but inexplicably ignores the fifth one.  The commentator notes that
 there has yet been no "official reaction" from the United States, although
 "American hawks" are "putting pressure" on the White House to "bar the
 way to a politica.! settlement" in Laos.
 Moscow expresses support for the NLHX proposals in a PRAVDA article by
 Shchedrov, summarized by TASS on 11 March, which says the program "opens
 up a realistic way to a political settlement and reestablishment of
 peace in Laos" and "meets with understanding and support" from democratic
 and peace forces.

 CHINESE      Peking's NCNA reported on 8 March that the NLIIX had issued
 REACTION     a Central Committee statement but omitted all mention of
 a peace program.  NCNA acknowledged only that the statement
 called for settlement of the Laos problem "by the parties concerned" and
 demanded that the United States immediately stop escalating the war
 and unconditionally stop the bombing "to create conditions for the
 Laotian parties concerned to meet."  NCNA played up the statement's
 charges of U.S. aggression in violation of the Geneva agreements and the
 NLHX avowal of determination to "fight on until final victory."  There
 has been no further reference to the statement in monitored Peking media
 to date,
 COI'44UNIST MEDIA ASSAIL NIXON STATEMENT ON LAOS POLICY
 Pathet Lao media waited until 10 March--after giving ample publicity to
 the NLHX initiative--to react to President Nixon's 6 March statement on
 U.S. policy on Laos, then complained that the President sought to deceive
 world opinion about U.S. aggressive actions by appealing to the Soviet
 and British cochairmen of the 1962 Geneva conference on Laos to step in.
 Hanoi, focusing its comment on the President's "admission" of U.S.
 involvement in Laos, echoes the Pathet Lao complaint only in airing a
 statement by thu Alliance Committee of the Patriotic Neutralist Forces--
 the neutralist faction that sides with the Pathet Lao.  Moscow, sensitive
 on the issue of the Soviet role as cochairman, has not acknowledged
 President Nixon's announcement of his letters to the two cochairmen; a
 PRAVDA article declares that the President "made no constructive proposRls"
 to normalize the Laotian situation  Peking, consistent with its suppression
 of the existence of an NLHX peace program, ridicules the President's
 talks about peace and argues for "protracted struggle."
 PATHET LAO     The Pathet Lao radio commentary of 10 March says that the
 COMMENTARY     President, "slandering and vilifying the DRV, requested
 that the 1962 Geneva conference cochairmen help restore
 the principle of Laos' neutrality, in an attempt to deceive world opinion
 into thinking the United States is not invading Laos."  Consistent
 with this comment, the NLHX Central Committee statement advancing the
 five-point proposal notably failed to appeal to participants in the
 1961-62 Geneva conference, as prior NLHX statements had done, addressing
 a call only to governments which love peace and justice and to the
 people of America and the world to demand that the United States
 stop the war; it denounced the United States and Vientiane for resorting
 :o "deceitful allegations about 'peace,'" but it did not go on --as the
 2C February NLHX statement had done--to ridicule the United States and
 :''s "puppets" for having "clamored for the holding of a new Geneva
 conference."

 11 MARCH 19'(0
 A statement by the Alliance Committee of the Patriotic Neutralist Forecu
 dated '( March, carried by Ilanoi's VNA on the 11th, combines an ' xprcosion
 of support for the NLIIX five-point program with the comment that
 President Nixon and Souvanna Phouma "revealed their perfidy" and their
 "scheme to expand the war" when they sent messages to the Geneva
 cochairmen "slandering the NLHX and the DIZV Government and proposing
 the convening of the Geneva conference on Laos."
 The 10 March Pathet Lao radio commentary says the President's state-
 merit showed that "he had no good will in solving the Laotian question
 through peaceful means," having made public his intention to continue
 the war in Laos.  It demands that the United States "implement" the
 five-point solution and let the Laotian people solve their own internal
 affairs.  It asserts that the "Laotian patriotic forces" have "matured"
 and become a "political force," and it insists that no problems
 concerning Laos can be solved "without the approval of the NLHX."
 HANOI        DRV comment is expressed most authoritatively in the government
 COMMENT      statement on the NLHX. proposal.  The statement says that the
 war in Laos has been "escalated" since President Nixon took
 office and that, faced with thiP "irrefutable truth" and with the "wave
 of protest" in the United States and throughout the world, the President
 was "forced to admit" that the United States had become more and more
 deeply involved in Laos.  In other comment Hanoi says the President made
 the statement in response to domestic criticism, and on 9 March a NHAN
 DAN Commentator article caps the attack with the remark that President
 Nixon wanted to "appease public concern" but has been "unmasked as a
 big liar."
 The government statement remarks that President Nixon was forced to
 "concede that U.S. aircraft had been bombing Laotian +erritory," and a
 VNA commentary on the 8th says he "had to admit evasively" that American
 planes flew "reconnaissance" and "combat missions."  He thus "for the
 first time personally admitted" U.S. bombings in Laos, the commentary
 adds.
 In the NHAN DAN Commentator article and elsewhere, Hanoi says the
 President "denied the presence of U.S. combat troops" except for 1,01+0
 "U.S. advisers and personnel."  NHAN DAN repeats the charge that there
 are 12,000 U.S. "military advisers and personnel" in Laos who are
 "commanding and taking part in all military activities of the Laotian
 reactionary forces."*

 The warn in Laos and Vietnam are linked in the government statement and
 in other Hanoi comment noting that the President "conceded." that the
 United States uses Laotian territory "to serve: the U.S. aggroasive war
 in Vietnam."  The 8 March VNA rommenta'ry says the President argued that
 "U S. planes were bombing Laos" to save American and L,llicd lives in
 South Vietnam, thereby "acknowledging" that the United States uses
 Laos as a military base in support of the war in South Vietnam.  (At
 the 5 March Paris scos:' on, Di%V representative Nguyen Minh Vy charged
 that the United States is trying to "retrieve its defeat" in Vietnam
 by escalating thy: war in Laos.)
 Hanoi also rebuts the President's statement on the DRV troop presence in
 Laos, but without acknowledging his remark that DRV troops in Laos are
 at an all-time high of 67,000.  The government statement merely says he
 "distorted the truth" and "impudently accused the DRV in an attempt to
 Justify U.S. aggression in Laos."  The VNA commentary says President
 Nixon "rehashed the slander about North Vietnam's escalation in Laos
 and North Vietnam's continued infiltration into Laos."  The NHAN DAN
 Commentator article similarly says he tried to "blame the tension in
 Laos on North Vietnam's continual infiltration into Laos."
 MOSCOW       Like Hanoi, Moscow emphasizes the theme that  the  President
 COMMENT      was "forced to admit" that the United States bombs Laotian
 territory and that there are "over 1,000 Americans, mostly
 'military advisers,'" in Laos.  These points appear in the initial TASS
 report, in a Zhukov PRAVDA article on the 9th, and in a radio commentary.
 The `!'ASS report adds that although he said there are no U.S. "ground
 detachments" in Laos, the President confirmed that the United States
 is "taking part in military operations on the side of the rightist
 forces."
 Again like Hanoi, Moscow says that the statement was designed to offset
 criticism of the Administration's Laotian policy but that it was
 nevertheless received with "dissatisfaction," and Soviet commentators
 note critical remarks by senators and in the press.
 TASS on 8 March reports VNA as saying the President "repeated the
 concoction on the North Vietnamese escalation in Laos to conceal
 American crimes," but Moscow does not emphasize this charge in its
 own comment.  Rather, in some comment linking the wars in Vietnam and
 Laos, Moscow charges that the United States is trying to use Laos
 in its "aggression" against the Vietnamese.  An 8 March domestic
 service talk by Kharkov on the President's statement cites the
 Washington POST as remarking that Laos and South Vietnam are too
 closely linked to be regarded separately and that the United States
 looks on Laos as "a kind of bridgehead."  In the 8 Marc'.. domestic

 rounlti:.ble discussion, one panel ist--withou'-. mentioning the President's
 statement--notes allegations "in Washington" that U.S. operations in
 Laos are needed "to cut off armn supplies to North Vietnam" and
 rejoins that such supplies cannot in fact be sent from the Plain of
 Jars; hence it in not really a matter of the United States wanting to
 cut of'f' supplies "from North to South Vietnam," but of intervention
 in "a completely independent civil war" in northern Laos.
 Soviet reports and comment on the President's statement fail to mention
 his announcement that he sent letters to the Soviet and British
 Geneva cochairmen asking their help in restoring the 1962 agreements,
 and Shchedrov states in a PRAVDA article on 11 March that the President
 made "no constructive proposals" for "normalizing" the situation in
 Laos.  In the 9 March PRAVDA article, charging the United States with
 responsibility for the Laotian war, Zhukov recalls that warnings about
 the "dangerous situation" had been made in the TASS statement of
 28 February and "by the Soviet Government" last November, but fails to
 specify that the latter was a statement sent to the 1962 Geneva
 conference participants by Gromyko as conference cochairmen.
 PEKING     Peking's first comment on the President's statement, carried
 COWENT     by NCNA on 8 March, notes that it said U.S. actions in Laos
 are "aimed at bringing about conditions for progress toward
 peace in the entire Indochinese peninsula" but also defined the primary
 American objective as protection of U.S. and allied troops in South
 Vietnam.  Remarking on this "gangster's logic," NCNA says that while the
 United States expands the war in Laos allegedly to protect its
 independence and neutrality, the Pre:,idcnt "admitted" that U.S.
 aggression in Laos is intensifying and that the United States will
 continue to increase the "wanton bombing," thus demonstrating that
 U.S. policy in Indochina "will never change."  The commentary expresses
 confidence that the Laotian people will persist in "protracted war" and
 win final victory.
 A subsequent NCNA commentary, on 11 March, asserts that the President
 issued his statement in the face of world condemnation of intensified
 U.S. aggression and that he was "playing counterrevolutionary dual
 tactics" when he "hypocritically" said the United States intends to
 reduce its involvement in Laos.
 In a 5 March PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article, pegged to the 28 February
 NLHX Central Committee statement which acclaimed the Plain of Jars
 victory, Peking ridicules President Nixon for having talked ever since
 he assumed office about "respecting neutrality" and "seeking peace" in
 Laos, when in fact U.S. aggression in Laos has become "even more
 blatant and flagrant."  Commentator charges that the Nixon Administration

 regards intensification of the war in Laos as an important measure in
 coordinating with the Vietnami nation policy in Vietnam, and it scores
 the Americans for, continuing to apply "counterrevolutionary dual
 tactics" in both Laos and Vietnam.  PEOPLE'S DAILY concludes by
 expressing the Chinese people's "resolute support" for the Laotian
 people's "protracted struggle."
 Peking does not as a rule support NLHX statements in this manner and
 in fact rarely comments on Laos except in speeches and message on
 appropriate anniversaries, normally limiting itself to news reports
 citing Pathet Lao media.  Chinese propaganda on the 20th anniversary
 of the Laotian, People's Liberation Army (LPLA) , celebrated on
 20 January 1969, included attacks on U.S. "plots and tricks" and on
 "political deception" regarding "peace talks," as had a 26 December
 1968 NCNA roundup of the year's revolutionary events in Laos.  No
 such comments appeared, however, in Peking's roundup of the 1969
 revolutionary situation or in comment on the 21st LPLA anniversary.

 MIDDLE EAST
 11 MARCH 1970
 MOSCOW CONTINUES PROTEST CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISRAEL, ZIONISM
 Through the week ending 8 March Moscow sustained its protest campaign
 against Israeli "aggression," along with continued denunciations of
 Zionism and defensive protestations by Soviet Jewish citizens that
 no "Jewish national question" exists in the Soviet Unior.  The protest
 campaign, which appears now to be diminishing, has included reports of
 statements by individuals and groups representing various sectors of
 Soviet society, with broadcasts in Arabic carrying expressions of
 support for the Arabs by Soviet Moslem leaders and regional radios
 broadcasting accounts of local protest meetings.  TASS has transmitted
 interviews with officials of peace organizations in East European coun-
 tries expressing "indignation" at Israeli policy.
 Almost half the volume of Moscow's protest propaganda in the past week
 consisted of publicity for the 4 March nr.ess conference of Soviet
 Jews at the Moscow House of Friendship under the auspices of the Soviet
 Foreign Ministry.  As in other comment, participants in the conference
 sought to distinguish between Israel's "extremist" leadership and
 its working people and "progressive forces."  PRAVDA on 10 March, accord-
 ing to the domestic service, publishes "at readers' request" a summary
 of the thesis on "the Jewish question and Zionism in our time" adopted
 by the Israeli Communist Party (Rakah) at its 16th congress in January-
 February 1969.  It was also at the request of "many readers" that
 PRAVDA on 28 February had carried a summary of the report delivered
 at the congress.
 In thematic content the prcpaganda follows standard lines, pressing
 for Israeli withdrawal as the main element of a peaceful solution
 of the crisis. There are still expressions of outrage at the 12 February
 Israeli bombing of the UAR plant at Abu Zabal, and some propaganda
 attention is devoted to the 3 March Israeli attack on "residential
 areas" of Suez. A commentary by Vasilyev in the 9 March PRAVDA says
 U.S. backing makes such attacks possible and notes that Israel will
 "soon obtain deliveries of a new batch" of U.S. aircraft.  He cites
 "world press" reports that U.S. pilots who gained expei-ience in
 Southeast Asia "are also sitting at the controls of Israeli aircraft."
 The pending U.S. decision on possible delivery of further Phantom
 and Skyhawk aircraft to Israel is the subject of speculation by
 panelists in the domestic service commentators' roundtable of 8 March.
 A broadcast in English to North America on the 10th, by "military
 observer" Maj. Gen. Kozlov, remarks that Israel's desire to possess
 "offensive" Phantoms is not dictated by defense needs.  Kozlov states
 that the Arab countries have a "completely up-to-date defensive air
 force" and that their military targets are "reliably protected by an

 extensive, effective antiaircraft system."  He notes with approval that
 the Arab governments are refraining from "extreme retaliatory measures,"
 adding that this restraint indicates that the Arabs "refuse to be pro-
 voked and will not expand the scale of the war."
 Propagandists again display sensitivity to the idea that the Soviet
 Union is seeking special status in the Middle East.  In a 4 March
 foreign-language commentary Kudryavtsev says the USSR does not want
 the Middle East to be used by any state "as a base for operations
 against its southern, European areas" and that therefore it is "out
 of the question" for the USSR to stake out a special position for itself
 in the Middle East.  Panelists in the domestic service commentators'
 roundtable on 1 March react to the passage in President Nixon's
 foreign policy report in which "he states plainly and quite clearly
 and unambiguously that the Soviet Union wants a dominating position"
 in the region for itself.  Matveyev rejoins that there is nothing to
 support the contention that Soviet policy "is allegedly dictated by
 some sort of narrow mercenary motives," while U.S. oil investments
 show that "the good gentlemen in Washington" themselves seek advantages
 in the Middle East.
 Other propaganda discounts any notion of Soviet interest in Middle
 East oil:  TASS on 3 March reports a LITERARY GAZETTE interview with
 the Soviet first deputy minister for petroleum extraction in which he
 "refuted fabrications of the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR" to the effect
 that the oil situation in East European countries was deteriorating
 rapidly and that it "was high time for the Russians to think of how
 they could get hold of Middle East oil."  The minister insisted that
 Soviet oil reserves were huge and that the USSR "cannot complain
 about insufficient oil resources."  Moscow subsequently broadcast
 his statemer:t in Arabic as well as in English to North America and in
 German.
 Current comment pays relatively little attention to the substantive
 aspects of a Middle East settlement.  In a domestic service commentary
 on the 9th Yefremov revives standard criticism of the U.S. proposals
 in castigating James Reston for writing in the New York TIMES that the
 conflict can be solved through a compromise guaranteed by the power
 and resolve of the United States.  Yefremov complains that as Reston
 presents it, Washington "would like to place itself above other
 permanent members of the Security Council" and play the role of "some
 kind of supreme disinterested international arbiter."  If the
 United States really wants the restoration of peace, he adds, it
 could make a "real and considerable contribution" by "stopping
 supplies of offensive weapons to the uncontrollable Israeli military
 and convincing Israel it should leave Arab territory."

 A panelist in tho 1 March domestic nervice commentators' roundtable
 looks to the four-power talks in New York as an approach to a political
 settlement, which the USSR continues to view as "the only reasonable
 way" to a Middle East solution. On the same program, PRAVDA's
 Belyayev recalls that the Soviet Union "once proposed a special.
 session" of the UN General Assembly--a topic long absent from
 Soviet propaganda.  In the context--that "Arab and peacelovir.g people
 have not forgotten" this action--Belyayev seemingly seeks more to
 underline past Soviet initiatives than to hint at future ones.

 STRATEGIC  ARMS
 PRAVDA "OBSERVER" ATTACKS LAIRD BUT SIGNALS NO CHANGE ON SALT
 An article in PRAVDA on 7 March over the aut::tori tative signature "Observe-.-"
 (Obozrevatel) underscores Moscow's continuing concern over U.S. defense
 policy but appears to signal no basic change i-t the cautiously optimistic
 Soviet posture toward the second round of the strategic arms limitation
 talks (SALT) schcduled to open in Vienna on 16 April.  Widely summarized
 by Radio Moscow for foreign audiences, the article does little more than
 sum up themes which have been prominent in less authoritative comment
 and reportage since the closing of the Helsinki phase of the talks in
 December.
 Observer levels a sharp attack against Secretary Laird, who has "recently
 made a whole series of public speeches in which he persistently calls
 for the buildup of various systems of strategic armaments," including the
 expansion of the Safeguard ABM system.  The article notes that last year,
 in seeking Congressional approval of funds for the first stage of
 Safeguard, the Administration had indicated that further development of
 the system would depend to a large extent on the outcome of SALT; "now
 U.S. leaders prefer not to recall this."  In addition to his "zealous"
 advocacy of an accelerated Safeguard, Observer says, Laird has called
 for the creation of new offensive weapons--a new strategic bomber to
 replace the B-52, improved underwater long-range offensive systems, "an
 improved offensive intercontinental ballistic missile, and so forth."
 The Observer article does not mention plans for multiple independently
 targeted reentry vehicles (MIRV), although less authoritative comment
 continues to complain about U.S. development of the vehicles.  A foreign-
 language commentary by  Shakhov on 7 March, for example, notes that
 the decision "to mass-produce multiple warhead vehicles was taken on
 the eve of the opening of U.S.-Soviet talks on issues regarding the
 restraining of the strategic arms race."
 The PRAVDA article rejects Laird's contention that the new programs are
 Justified by the existence of "a 'Soviet threat,"' countering that it
 is "well known that the measures implemented in the USSR in the postwar
 period to strengthen its defense capability were a reply to the
 unrestrained arms race in nuclear missiles and other arms whipped up by
 the United States."  Citing the U.S. press, Observer says Laird's
 campaicn is symptomatic of "the military's excessive influence" and
 serves the "mil.tary-industrial complex" which would like "to start
 a new expensive round in the strategic arms race, whip up a
 militaristic tendency in Washington's foreign policy, and lead
 matters to a further exacerbation of international tension."  He goes
 on to note that Laird's speeches are "legitimately regarded by the

 puulic as a statement or reflection of the U.S. ruling circles'
 positions" and asks rhetorically to what eztent the Secretary's
 "militaristic appeals reflect the position of the U.S. Government."
 Despite its sharp attack on Laird and the "military-industrial complex"
 and its questioning of U.S. sincerity in the negotiations--a propaganda
 tack which lays groundwork for blaming the United States in case the
 talks collapse--the article registers the same attitude of cautious
 optimism that has marked Soviet comment since the Helsinki phase of
 SALT in November-December.  It reaffirms, for example, the "serious"
 Soviet approach to the talks, drawing on USSR delegate Semenov's
 statement in Helsinki as well as on U.S. spokesmen's remarks taking
 note of Soviet seriousness.  It points to the futility of a spiraling
 arms race, both from the economic point of view and from the military
 point of view, and it cites former presidential adviser McGeorge Bundy
 to the effect that "a strategic nuclear engagement cannot lead to any
 kind of gain."  A 23 February domestic service commentary on President
 Nixon's 18 February foreign policy report had noted that the President
 observed "realistically" that both the United States and the USSR
 "have acquired the capability of inflicting on each other unacceptable
 damage, regardless of who strikes first.  The power which provokes an
 exchange of thermonuclear strikes will gain no advantage and certainly
 win no victory."
 Observer concludes that "despite the difficulties, it is obvious that
 there is still time and there are still possibilities for reaching an
 understanding."  The "indispensable" conditions, he says, are the presence
 of good will on both sides and the holding of "honest talks without
 striving to obtain any unilateral military advantages."
 KOSYGIN     Two days prior to the Observer article, at the 5 March
 COMMENT     Moscow ceremony for deposition of the instruments of
 ratification of the nonproliferation treaty, Premier Kosygin
 had also called for good will on the part of both sides in the arms talks.
 He declared that the Soviet Government attaches "great importance" to
 the U.S.-Soviet dialogue on strategic arms limitation and is now preparing
 for the Vienna phase of the talks "in all seriousness."  Reporting the
 Washington ceremony, TASS on the 5th said President Nixon expressed the
 hope that a "favorable atmosphere" will be created at the Vienna talks.
 On 27 February, noting that the President had submitted his annual
 report to Congress on the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
 TASS had reported the President as indicating that the "serious exchange"
 at Helsinki augurs well for the deliberations in Vienna.

 PEKING DERIDES PARTNERSHIP THEME IN NIXON FOREIGN POLICY
 A substantial body of low-level Peking comment on President Nixon's
 foreign policy report continuer to draw a picture of the United States
 as a declining power with a bankrupt global strategy.  Notably absent
 from this picture is any effort to portray the United States as a
 threat to China, nor has Peking staked out a position on key issues
 dividing the two countries.  Moreover, Peking remains silent on
 U.S. initiatives for an improvement of bilateral relations.  Formerly,
 when conveying a quite different attitude, Peking depicted U.S.
 policies as directed at an encirclement of the PRC and scornfully
 rejected specific proposals for improving relations.
 Peking's comment has focused on the President's call for "partnership"
 in dealing with allies and friendly nations.  The partnership theme
 is the subject of articles in PEOPLE'S DAILY on 5 and 7 March which
 deride the President's 18 February foreign policy report as a futile
 effort to develop a new "counterrevolutionary" global strategy at a
 time when U.S. strength is being ser:1.ously eroded.  Both articles give
 broad-brush portrayals of a world situation in which the United States
 is being challenged bo:;h by its allies and. by revolutionary movements
 across the globe.
 A more detailed analysis of the Administration's new Asian policy,
 viewed against a background of postwar U.S. strategies in that area, is
 contained in an NCNA commentary on the 7th.  Mention-of the Chinese civil
 war is followed by the observation that today the PRC "stands firm" in
 Asia as the "powerful anti-imperialist and antirevisionist political
 force" of the present era, "the most reliable friend of the oppressed
 people," and "the hope of the world revolution."  NCNA gives a standard
 lief of armed struggles going on in Asia and uses the Vietnam war as
 evidence that the United States is a paper tiger.  In discussing the
 operation of the Nixon Doctrine in Asia, the NCNA commentary reflects
 Peking's concern over the role being assigned to Japan.  Indicating
 a hope to draw upon residual anti-Japanese sentiment, NCNA claims that
 such a role can only arouse fierce opposition among people of various
 countries that had been victimized by the Japanese during World War II.
 Peking has made use of French President Pompidou's visit to the United
 States to fill in the picture of diminishing U.S. strength by playing
 up signs of French independence and conflicts of interest between
 Paris and Washington.  An NCNA report on 4 March, which characterized
 the U.S. situation today as one of "utter passivity," quoted the
 President as calling for a reduction of commitments around the world
 where the United States is overextended and placing emphasis on

 priority areas "such as Europe."  Significantly, it was precisely this
 observation which Peking selected as its sole citation from Mr. Nixon's
 campaign statements in commenting on the presidential election of
 1968--that is, during another period when Peking studiously avoided
 foreclosing its options toward the United States at a time when
 resur::ption of the Warsaw talks was envisaged.
 Both the 4 March report and an article carried by NCNA on the 8th made
 a point of citing Pompidou's reaffirmations of an independent
 French line.  In the first report, NCNA quoted the French President as
 referring to SALT as "a way of sharing hegemony" and a.i a "danger" for
 countries in both West and East Europe.  The article on the 8th, taking
 note of hostile demonstrations and snubs directed at Pompidou, viewed
 the visit as a partnership "farce" personally directed by President
 Nixon right on the heels of his foreign policy report, in which he
 "bragged about so-called 'partnership."  NCNA charged that President
 Nixon tried to bully his visitor by demanding the restationing of U.S.
 troops in France.

 SING - SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 TENSIONS REFLECTED AS MOSCOW, PEKING PURSUE POLEMICS
 11 MARCH 1970
 As Moscow and Peking continue routine polemical skirmishing, the tense
 facts of life in Sino-Soviet relations have been reflected in the two
 sides' media a year after the outbreak of fighting on the Ussuri.  A
 Soviet cosmonaut has invoked the memory of the Damanskiy Island
 clashes in an article in RED STAR on 5 March recounting his visit to
 border outposts near the area of the clashes.  The article strikes a
 note of "high vigilance" along the border, though without indicating
 a particularly troubled situation at present.  Serving as a reminder of
 the border problem without being provocative, the article seems
 designed to foster a sense of identity between the Soviet heartland
 and distant borderlands--an effort much in evidence in Soviet
 propaganda following the clashes last year.  On the Chinese side,
 in addition to a new attack on the Brezhnev leadership, Peking has
 disseminated an article by an Indian communist which evokes a sense
 of war danger in notably stark terms, though it does not mention the
 border problem.
 MOSCOW     While it makes no direct reference to Sino-Soviet border
 incidents in 1969, cosmonaut Volkov's 5 March RED STAR article
 pointedly recalls an earlier meeting with "the heroes of Damanskiy."
 Recounting his tour of outposts in the Far Eastern Military District,
 he describes his flight into Iman--"the same Iman which was recently
 on everybody's lips"--where he was met by the border guards, one of
 whom he recognized "because of the photographs in the newspapers."
 Emphasizing that on the frontier "everyone must be prepared for
 exploits," Volkov closes with the assurance that "the loyal sons of
 the socialist fatherland" in the Far East have the weaponry to defend
 the country.
 The central press continues to take note of anti-Soviet campaigns in
 the PRC.  A TASS report on 4 Mai,;h, published in the Moscow press the
 next day, describes recent attacks on the economist Sun Yeh-fang in terms
 of opposition to Soviet-style economic orthodoxy.  A LITERARY GAZETTE
 article on the 4th, pegged to the 40th anniversary of the League of
 Leftist Writers in China, decries "the tragic fate" of Chinese literature
 and the current fanning of "war psychosis" and chauvinism in the service
 of Maoism.  The preface to a KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA article on 7 March,
 devoted to the author's reminiscences of his stay in China during the
 early phases of the cultural revolution, observes that everything
 today in China is being subordinated to "war hysteria" and denounces the
 "Maoists" for attempting to implant the "mad idea" that the Soviet Union
 is planning to invade the PRC.

 11 MARCH 1970
 Foreign communists again are invoked to criticize Peking in the name
 of the international communist movement.  Reporting sessions of the
 congress of the Cypriot communist party AKEL, PRAVDA on 7 and 8 cited
 speeches by foreign delegates denouncing the "anti-Leninist" and
 "schismatic" policies of "the Maoist leadership."
 By contrast, Moscow continues to avoid personal attacks on Mao in
 broadcasts to China.  A 9 March Mandarin broadcast over Radio Peace
 and Progress, for example, is careful not to i-ame names in likening
 the rectification campaign in the CCP in the early 1940's to cultural
 revolution purges "in the upper echelons of thy present regime."  It
 speaks in general terms of similarities between the earlier purge of
 "the internationalist core" of the party--those amenable to the Soviet
 and Comintern line--and the current purge of those charged with the
 "cardinal sin" of being well-disposed toward the USSR.  Soviet
 broadcasts to China occasionally refer to "Mao Tse-tung Thought Study
 Classes" or to a Mao quotation but have refrained from direct attack
 on Mao personally since the agreement to hold talks was reached in
 early October, while domestic media and broadcasts in other foreign-
 language services resumed attacks on Maoism by name early this year.
 Soviet concern over improvement in Sino-U.S. relations is evident
 in several Mandarin broadcasts warning that the PRC's anti-Soviet
 policies are abetting the imperialist enemy and harming the cause of
 the socialist camp.  A 9 March commentary alludes to the Warsaw talks
 in warning that no Sino-U.S. talks "will guarantee China's safety from
 invasion and raids" by the United States.  The commentary seeks to
 play on inherited mistrust among the Chinese toward the United States
 and to discredit U.S. appeals for a relaxation of tension as aimed
 at lowering Chinese vigilance and at encouraging Peking to continue its
 anti-Soviet line.
 The triangular relationship is introduced into a discussion of SALT in
 a Mandarin broadcast on 7 March summarizing the authoritative PRAVDA
 article that day on SALT.  According to the broadcast, the arms
 limitation talks "will definitely provide certain answers to the
 so-called Soviet-U.S. collusion" charged by Peking.  There is no such
 reference in the PRAVDA article itself.  The Soviet weekly LIFE
 ABROAD (No. 8, signed to press on 18 February) had earlier turned
 the collusion charge against Peking, arguing that in "entering into
 collusion" with the United States the Chinese are "trying to prevent
 achievement of an agreement" on limiting strategic arms.
 PEKING     NCNA on 8 March carried a "recent" article by the leader
 of the pro-Peking Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)
 which asserts that the danger of war "has never been so real" since
 World War II as "at the present moment" and that there is a "very real"

 danger of the use of nuclear weapons.     But an if to offset the demoralizing
 effect of what it calls "scaremongering" propaganda about the horrifying
 destructiveness of nuclear war, NCNA quotes the article as dismissing
 nuclear weapons as a paper tiger and as expressing confidence that a war
 would bring the liberation of mankind nearer.  Though there is a reference
 to "Soviet revisionist social imperialism," the NCNA summary does not
 mention the border conflict.
 A Peking broadcast in Russian on 9 March resurrects an item originally
 carried by NCNA on 7 February which relates episodes of mutual support
 between the Chenpao (Damanskiy) area border guards and the local militia
 and populace.  The report recalls the March 1969 incidents in which the
 Soviets allegedly committed "armed aggression" on Chenpao Island.  There
 have also been scattered references to Chenpao in recent domestic
 broadcasts.
 Peking's latest attack on "Brezhnev and his gang" is contained in an
 NCNA report on the 7th denouncing the recently concluded Soviet-U.S.
 cultural exchange agreement as the first deal made by the two sides "in
 t1 it frequent activities of collusion" since the beginning of this year.
 As in NCNA's 21 February article on Soviet-Czechoslovak relations, the
 7 March report takes note of. Soviet anti-Chinese polemics in charging
 that "several scribes in the pay of the Soviet revisionist renegade
 clique" have been engaged in "anti-China outcries."

 MOSCOW PRESSES NEED FOR COLLECTIVE DEFENSE MEASURES
 The :)ovieL propaganda 1_111C on the need to strengthen "collective"
 defence metuiures in the ['ace of It growing "1.mperiailsL" threat; is
 sharpened in u. 7 March PRAVDA article by Col. L. Lukonin crit,itled
 "V..I. Lenin on the DcI'enoe of the Socialist Fatherland."  IH;xtending
 Lenin's views  on t,hc defense of "Lhe socialist fatherland" to the
 defense of' "thee socialist commun.ity,"  the  article argues in e.t.'t'ect
 for a [trezhnev-doctrine-type class approach to "the vitally Important
 problem o[.' strengthening the socialist community."  Although the
 Chinese (who are mentioned directly) and the Yugoslavs (who are not,
 named) are targets of Lukonin's attacks on "right" and "left"
 revisionists and opportunists, the article appears aimed chiefly at
 the Romanians, who are resisting Warsaw Pact integration and have
 been reluctant to allow maneuvers on Romanian soil.
 As if to dramatize the Soviet propaganda ,justification for a
 strengthened Warsaw Pact, Lukonin warns darkly that "behind the black
 banner of anticommunism, which is becoming increasingly insolent and
 subtle, the preparation for a new world war is now taking place."
 He declares that in the face of this rising threat, "the socialist
 countries are being forced to intensify their collective measures for
 the armed defense of their achievements"; thus the Warsaw Fact is
 being "steadily strengthened and improved."
 Adapting Lenin's ideas to the exigencies of the present Soviet
 propaganda line, Lukonin explains that "the Leninist definition of
 the fatherland as a given political, cultural, and social environment
 is opposed to the bourgeois nationalist and opportunist interpretations
 of the fatherland as a national and geographical phenomenon."  He
 goes on to define the world socialist system as "the creation of the
 international working class" which "in this   sense acts as a single
 socialist fatherland for the peoples of these countries and for the
 working people of the entire world."  It follows, he argues, that the
 defense of socialism is "a direct international deed, the sacred duty
 of peoples and armies of the socialist states."  The article goes on
 to condemn the non-Leninist approach of those "right and 'left'
 opportunists" and revisionists who "place sovereignty in opposition
 to internationalism" and advance the "so-called theory of support
 only from one's own forces."  Lenin, it points out, resolutely opposed
 any split in the revolutionary forces and "any manifestations of
 nationalism."

 An rciitortal In thr. Albanian ZEHL .1  1101,1111A I.T on 0 March charges the l;ov.tct
 Union with trying to mold Warsaw fact forces into a supra.nat,ional army
 no part of it plan to dominate Eant,crn Europe and use East; Europeans
 In the conflict with China.   Calculated to encourage Romanian resistance
 and t:o stimulate opposition in other East European countries, the
 editorial appears prompted by concern over the prospect of it Soviet-
 controlled international force that could potentially be used against
 Albania.
 'LEItI I i'Qi'ULLIT cites recent articles by Soviet General Shtemcriko and
 Marshal Grechko as evidence that Moscow envisages "Joint military units,"
 commenting that such units would be a first step toward "the total
 integration of the national armies and their conversion into an ordinary
 Soviet; army under the direction and orders of the Marshals of the Soviet
 Union."  Since the units would not operate under any national flag, the
 paper adds, Moscow would use them tc "defend socialism" under the
 1rezhnev doctrine whenever it decided Soviet interests were threatened.
 The editorial says Moscow would try to counter the impression that the
 joint unit3 are occupation troops by dressing them in the uniform of a
 supranational army and stationing them in East European countries.
 In a further effort to arouse nationalist indignation and fear of foreign
 involvement among Moscow's East European allies, the article warns that
 another Soviet objective is to use East European "mercenaries" first as
 "symbolic" forces in the conflict with the Chinese and, should the
 conflict heat up, actually use them against the PRC.
 The editorial points to e. common bond between Albania and Romania,
 praising Bucharest for its resistance to Soviet "threats and blackmail"
 and pledging Albanian "support" for such "fully just" efforts.  It also
 expresses "understanding of the right of the peoples of Yugoslavia to
 defend themselves from any threat or attack."  A prior similar effort to
 deTine a common bond between Albania and the Yugoslavs as well as the
 Romanians was made in an editorial in ZERI I POPULLIT on 11 April 1969,
 condemning alleged efforts by the Soviets to "occupy" Romania as they
 did Czechoslovakia and subsequently to attack Yugoslavia.
 Encouraging Bucharest and other Pact members to resist Soviet inter,'ationist
 pressures, the 6 March editorial concludes:  "We do not believe that the
 peoples of the Warsaw Pact countries and the Soviet peoples will allow
 themselves to become servants of the renegade Brezhnev-Kosygin clique
 and be used as docile tools of its enslaving imperialist policy."

 RCP TAKES MAJOR CREDIT FOR ESTABLISHING GROZA REGIME
 Ceausescu uses the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the catabliah-
 men', of the Grozu regime in March 1945 to underline the notion that the
 Romanian party--and by implication not Moscow--played "the decisive"
 role in bringing communism to ltornnnia.  by emphasizing the
 sacrifices Romania made to achieve its independence, Ceausescu seems
 to be arguing in effect that Romania has earned its right to present
 its independent views in international forums.  The address, broadcast
 by Radio Bucharest on 6 March, acknowledges Moscow's "contribution"
 but observes that the 6 March victory "did not Jun'. happen and was
 not brought about from abroad."  It was won, Ceausescu says, "by
 struggle and grave sacrifices made by the revolutionary democratic
 forces in Romania under the Romanian party leadership."
 Reaffirming Romania's familiar foreign policy principles, Ceausescu
 goes on to declare that his country is "determined to campaign for
 the assertion of these principles in relations among all states and
 to continue in the future, too, to make its active contribution to
 developing collaboration among peoples and the insuring of peace in
 the world."  Thus, he says, at the present Geneva disarmament talks
 it is "necessary for the representatives of all interested countries to
 be able to participate and to express their views."  These remarks seem
 calculated to defend Romania's right to have called at the Geneva
 disarmament talks the preceding day for "an international document"
 that would ban "the us? of force or the threat of force against another
 state under all circumstances."  Reporting this Romanian proposal on the
 5th, AGERPRES  said it a'i.so provided for "renunciation of military
 maneuvers on the territory of other states."  TASS, recounting the
 5 March Geneva session, mentioned that the Romanian delegate called for
 an early solution to the problem of nuclear disarmament but ignored his
 remarks on maneuvers and the banning of intervention in the, affairs of
 other countries.
 PRAVDA       Moscow marks the 25th anniversary of the installation of the
 ARTICLE      Groza regime with a 6 March PRAVDA article by Gerasimov
 which plays up the Soviet role in helping the Groza
 government come to power.  The article recalls how this first communist-
 dominated government supported "the necessity of radically improving

 to impose the 'Marshal Plan' on the country."  Gerasimov also reminds

 GDR DENOUNCES BRANDT, SILENT ON ALTERNATE SUMMIT VENUE PROPOSAL
 Lust German media so far have muintulned complete silence an FfiG
 Chancellor Brandt's 9 March proposal that he and GDR Premier Stoph
 meet in some other city, rather than East Berlin.  Authoritative GDR
 statements broadcast: since the Brundc proposal late on the 9th have
 avoided any reference to a change in venue and persist in harsh
 criticism of' Brandt's proposed Berlin vial'-, in connection with the
 summit talks, labeling it an "unacceptable political provocation."
 Speeches and comment closely follow the polemical line laid down in
 the 9 March GDR Council of Ministers statement.   Warsaw media report
 the resumption of FRG-Polish political talks in Warsaw 9 March,
 while Moscow maintains silence about the resumption of talks between
 Foreign Minister Gromyko and FliG State Secretary Bahr in Moscow.
 BONN "SABOTAGE"      Brandt's proposal for some other, unspecified summit
 OF SUMMIT TALKS      meeting site is ignored completely in a 10 March
 speech by GDR State Secretary for West German
 Problems Herrmann, as well as in East German newspaper comment reviewed
 by ADN on 11 March.  Herrmann reiterates the line set down in the 9 March
 Council of Ministers statement and accuses Brandt of "intentionally"
 making a "political provocation" against the GDR by his planned West
 Berlin visit.   In the most direct reference in current GDR comment to
 the possibility the summit meeting may not be held, Herrmann observes
 that "the international press" is "understandably asking ever more
 openly whether Bonn's aim is not to sabotage the meeting between the
 heads of government."  GDR media have previously stressed that the
 meeting must be held in "the GDR capital, Berlin," and, while
 vehemently denying any attempt to set preconditions, have flatly re-
 jected any Brandt travel plans involving a West Berlin visit; for
 example, Iierrmannpoints out that "tic GDR has presented all practicable
 possibilities" regarding Brandt's travel route.
 GDR 9 MARCH          The GDR Council of Ministers statement, handed to
 STATEMENT            FRG negotiator Sahm on 9 March, was released by ADN
 later the same day, only three hours before release
 of the new Brandt proposal for a change in summit venue.  It sustains
 GDR attempts to cast all blame on the Brandt regime should the Brandt-
 Stoph meeting be cancelled,* while reiterating East German willingness
 *  A May 1967 proposal for summit negotiations, renewed by Stoph in a
 19 September letter accompanying an earlier GDR draft treaty, proved
 fruitless and gave rise to GDR recriminations against the Kiesinger
 government for its insistence upon "sole representation" and its
 "revanchism" and nuclear aspirations, themes also being exploited
 in current GDR propaganda.

 to meet.  Repeating the standard GDR and Soviet view that West Berlin
 is an independent political entity, it calls any Brandt visit to West
 Berlin "a provocation that we cannot and do not wish to accept" and
 adds that the GDR Government "rejects the attempt to create an issue
 of conflict by raising the West Berlin question," which it says is not
 part of the talks.  It r'calls Brandt's earlier assurances in his
 18 February letter to Stoph about stressing areas on which the GDR
 and FRG agree and declares that "if these are not to remain mere words,"
 Brandt must "forego the political demonstration against the GDR."
 The GDR statement makes a strained attempt to extend international law
 to the route traveled by heads of state, arguing that "the principle of
 equality requires" that Brandt, when visiting the other party to
 negotiations, "respect its sovereignty and observe the sovereign rights
 of the GDR in accordance with the principles of international law as far
 as the route is concerned."  It adds that "if" the two states are to
 negotiate, "it is surely quite normal that one should arrive at and
 depart from the railway station or airport of the capital in which the
 government concerned has its seat."
 Compared with the bitter, vituperative NEUES DEUTSCHLAND commentaries
 of 6, 7, and 8 March, however, the GDR statement appears to be a calcu-
 lated effort to present the GDR as patiently seeking a summit meeting,
 a "successful conclusion" of the preliminary talks, and as being
 "interested in holding the meeting soon."  The 6 March NEUES DEUTSCHLAND
 commentary denounced the West German press, "led by the Springer press,"
 for a "deliberate press campaign, daily rising in intensity," that
 employed "deliberate vicious reports," "gross distortions and false
 reports," and "wild speculations" intended "obviously" to "poison the
 atmosphere and pose unacceptable conditions" to the GDR.  This commentary
 denounced Springer papers for their "demands" that Brandt "demonstrative-
 ly" visit West Berlin, saying "no serious politician can assume" the GDR
 would get involved in such actions, "which contravene international
 law" and which would "seriously hamper" the pending four-power talks on
 Berlin, something which the GDR "cannot permit."  A NEUES DEUTSCHLAND
 7 March commentary carried textually by ADN directly questions the
 Brandt-Scheel regime's sincerity and good intentions, accusing it of
 employing a "poisoned propaganda gimmick" at this juncture to wring
 concessions from the GDR in return for "alleged readiness to make
 concessions" on Bonn's part.  Asking rhetorically whether Brandt'a
 attitude is "really better" than his predecessors, NEUES DEUTSCHLAND
 concludes that "the much-vaunted 'accomodation' shown" by the FRG
 "consists of a flood of more or less beautiful words and nothing
 else."  It concludes:  "We do not expect the 'lest German state, as
 it is today, to show any accomodation to socialism, and we on our part
 are not prepared to back down vis-a-vis that state on any point."

 denounces FGR spokesman Ahlero for his "impudence" in defending
 Brandt's right to visit and work in West and East Berlin, calling
 his remarks "the most brazen formula in which Bonn's revanchist
 arrogant claim to sole representation has ever been expressed."
 MOSCOW RESTRAINT     Soviet media continue to employ comparative
 ON FRG-GDR TALKS     restraint in reporting the FRG-GDR dispute.  The
 only available radio comment on the new argument
 over. Brandt's proposal to visit West Berlin in connection with the
 summit is a passing reference in the 8 March Moscow domestic service
 commentators' roundtable.  Observer Nekrasov ingenuously notes that
 "we are not, of course, in a position to know how these consultations
 are going" and attributes to "Western news agencies" the belief that
 how Brandt travels to East Berlin for the summit meeting is the "touch-
 stone" of the preliminary talks.  He adds that behind this issue "which
 one would have thought was a mere formality, a matter of protocol,"
 lies "the demand for recognition of the GDR's full sovereignty" and, on
 the FRG side, "an attempt to gloss over this issue and leave loopholes
 for some kind of revanchist tendencies and ambitions."  TASS omits from
 its lengthy summation of the GDR Council of Ministers statement one of
 the most peremptory GDR assertions, that "equal negotiations can only
 come about if both sides recognize each other ae sovereign subjects
 under international law," and also leaves out some GDR arguments about
 how Brandt should travel to Berlin.  Soviet media have ignored the
 current successive NEUES DEUTSCHLAND attacks on the Brandt regime.
 WARSAW, MOSCOW       The resumption of West German talks in Warsaw
 TALKS RESUME         and Moscow has been reported and ignored,
 respectively, by Polish and Soviet media, just as
 in earlier talks.  Warsaw coverage is limited to brief reportage on
 the arrival of the FRG delegation headed by Duckwitz and the three
 days of meetings concluding on 11 March.  PAP reports on the 11th that
 "a businesslike exchange of views on the matter of normalization of
 mutual relations" took place during the exchanges, which will be
 continued in the second half of April.  A 7 March ZYCIE WARSZAWY
 interview with Polish Vice Foreign Minister Willmann stressed that the
 subject of these talks is "the FRG's recognition of the permanence of
 Poland's western border," a recognition which would "initiate a pro-
 cess of normalized relations" between the two countries.   The subject
 of FRG-Polish trade talks is mentioned in passing by Willmann, and dis-
 cussed at length by Foreign Trade Minister Burakiewicz in a PAP
 interview on 8 March.  He refers to "initial understanding" reached on
 the usefulness of a new five-year agreement on trade and economic and
 scientific-technical cooperation.  Noting progress in some mattes,
 Burakiewicz adds that no understanding has been reached yet on
 "principles" to make a Polish-FRG agreement conducive to increasing
 mutual trade turnover.  He said Poland "fully shares" Brandt's view
 that the political and economic talks are not intertwined and that
 "there is not and cannot be a question of any economic concessions" by
 one side in exchange for "political concessions" by the other.

 Moscow has remained completely silent on the resumption of talks
 between FRG spokesman Bahr and Foreign Minister Grorryko on 3 March.
 This is consistent with its previous handling of the opening two
 rounds in early December and January and early February, which were
 reported on briefly in February and commented upon only onLC.
 FRG INVOLVEMENT IN GAS-CENTRIFUGE ACCORD ATTACKED BY GDR
 Consistent with its warnings over the years about alleged West
 German efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, the GDR Foreign Ministry
 issued a statement on 3 March formally protesting the signing,
 scheduled for the next day, of an FRG-British-Dutch treaty on the
 construction and operation of gas-centrifuge plants for the production
 of enriched-uranium fuel.  In addition to the plants' capability
 to produce reactor fuel, the statement says, they can enrich uranium to
 such an extent that it can be used as the detonator for nuclear weapons
 and can process pure plutonium for weapons.  The statement calls the
 gas-centrifuge treaty an "attempt to circumvent the control obligations"
 of the nonproliferation treaty, noting that one of Bonn's "reservations"
 in signing the nonproliferation accord stipulates exclusion of
 a nuclear facility from the treaty's control if effective control
 of that facility outside West Germany "can'be attributed to a nuclear
 power--that is, Britain."  The statement concludes by recalling Article
 4 of the GDR draft treaty on normalizing relations with West Germany
 which proposes that both states refrain from the acquisition of and
 control over nuclear weapons "in any form whatever."
 The gas-centrifuge treaty also comes under fire in a 4 March East
 Berlin domestic service commentary.  While it does not refer to the
 Foreign Ministry statement, the commentary echoes the statement in
 warning of the plants' weapons capability and puts little stock in the
 assurances of the signatories, who "pretend that this involves a
 purely peaceful project for the fuel supply of nuclear powerplants."
 What is at issue, the commentary observes, "is not a ban of the gas
 centrifuges from the world but the question of who has them and for
 what purposes they are used."
 East German propaganda on the coming into effect of the nonproliferation
 treaty on 5 March touches briefly on the gas-centrifuge agreement.
 Premier Stoph in a 5 March statement, for example, says West Germany
 has combined its signing of the nonproliferation treaty with several
 reservations and has "not abandoned its attempts to secure control over
 nuclear weapons within the framework of NATO or by production
 agreements with other states."  The 6 March NEUES DEUTSCHLAND editorial
 says that the gas-centrifuge treaty, "by means of which Bonn might
 obtain plutonium that could be used in weapons, is an infraction" of
 the nonproliferation accord.

 11 MARCH 1970
 SOVIET       '.LASS reported the GDR Foreign Ministry protest on 3 March,
 REACTION     taking note of its charge that the gas-centrifuge agree-
 ment is an attempt to avoid the control measures of the
 nonproliferation  treaty.  Moscow has otherwise given no publicity
 to the conclusion of the three-nation pact, although Soviet propaganda
 since late 1963, when negotiations on the treaty beger, has routinely
 attacked the plans for the gas-centrifuge plants.
 The only available reaction from the GDR's East European partners comes
 from Poland.  The army newspaper ZOLNEIRZ WOLNOSCI, in a commentary
 reviewed by PAP on the 6th, says the three-nation pact opens new
 prospects for the West German nuclear industry, makes possible
 nuclear production for military purposes, and "is the first step toward
 Bonn's possession of its own nuclear stockpiles."  A 7 March TRYBUNA
 LUDU article on the nonproliferation accord  calls the gas-centrifuge
 treaty a "clear attempt" by the FRG to widen prospects in the field
 of nuclear production, adding that "in our opinion this creates the
 danger that the German Federal Republic might come closer to a
 collision with the nonproliferation treaty."
