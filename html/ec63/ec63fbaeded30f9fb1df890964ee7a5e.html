 NEW TRAINING OUTLINE TAILORED TO MILITARY MODERNIZATION
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 8 Feb 81 p 1
 [Article:  "General Staff Department Approves and Issues Training Outline"]
 [Text]   Editor's note:   The military training outline issued
 by the General Staff Department is based upon the strategic
 policy of the Military Commission of the CCP Central Committee,
 and was formulated on the basis of the existing equipment, on
 synthesizing our army's military qualities, and on assimilating
 the experiences of the war of self-defensive counterattack
 against Vietnam and the results of reforming the training of
 units.  The content of the new outline is rich, the key points
 stand out, and it embodies quite well the features of modern
 warfare.  It comprises the laws and regulations for the train-
 ing of every unit of the army, and is the basic foundation
 for organizing and carrying out training.  In the new annual
 training program, leaders and organizations at all levels,
 especially the leaders and departments in charge of training,
 must conscientiously study the new outline, grasp the essence
 of the outline, be clear about the outline's specific formu-
 lations, and, proceeding from the reality in their unit,
 thoroughly implement the outline by suiting measures to local
 conditions and tasks, so that the training work will be further
 standardized.
 To further adapt to and strengthen the requirements for modernizing our armed forces,
 to improve the combat ability of troops under modern conditions, the General Staff
 Department recently approved and issued a military training outline, which has
 already been sent to one unit after another for a tryout.
 This training outline, based on the strategic policy and guiding ideology on combat
 of the Military Commission of the party Central Committee, proceeding from the re-
 quirements of a future war against aggression, and based on our army's existing
 equipment, conscientiously draws on our army's combat experience, especially the
 experience of the war of self-defensive counterattack against Vietnam, and on the
 results of the training reform in units in recent years.  In the process of writing
 the outline, the commission adopted the method of integrating the higher and lower
 levels to jointly research and write it.  In the outline, there are clear provisions

 for the guiding ideology, content, demands, and methods of training; rules and
 regulations for training; and the-training duties of leaders at all levels.  The
 outline is the fundamental basis for organizing and carrying out training.
 The General Staff Department urges all units, organizations and troops, especially
 cadres and key members in charge of training work, to conscientiously study the
 outline, and, according to the tasks of units and regional characteristics, to
 truly organize and carry out training according to the principles and demands
 stipulated by the outline, suiting measures to local conditions, and-also, in the
 practice of training, to make a point of discovering problems, summing up exper-
 iences, and putting forward suggestions for revision.

 NEW FIELD KITCHEN PASSES OPERATIONAL TEST
 Beijing JIEFANGTJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Feb 81 p 1
 [Article by Chen Yaping [7115 0068 1627]:  "New-Type Field Kitchen Tested in Frigid
 Northeast"]
 [Text]  On 15 January, when the officers and men of an organic infantry battalion
 of a certain regiment was engaged in a winter operational test in the Lesser Xing'an
 [Khingan] Mountains at an extremely ice- and snow-covered position, they ate a
 savory, warm noon meal prepared by a field kitchen developed by the Supply Research
 Institute of the General Logistics Department.
 Proceeding from the existing economic conditions of our country, the Supply Research
 Institute and the Equipment Research Center of the General Logistics Department in
 the second half of last year set about developing a field kitchen in order to
 improve the cooking in our army.  At the beginning of January this year, comrades
 of the Supply Research Institute took a sample of the kitchen to the northeast
 frontier to test it with the troops under frigid conditions.  This field kitchen
 insures the supply of hot meals to battalion-level organizations.  On the basis of
 using it together with existing field kitchen equipment, 10 new pieces of equipment
 were added.  With the exception of a portable tent, all equipment for this field
 kitchen is packed in 12 containers.  It supplies 2 days of provisions for an entire
 battalion and can be transported in two vehicles.  During meal preparation, the
 kitchen equipment can either be concentrated in one place or divided between two or
 three places.  The special features of the kitchen are:  first, it can make full
 use of existing equipment; second, it lightens the burden on the kitchen staff;
 third, with the variety of kitchen equipment in the complete set, wheaten food,
 cooked rice, fried dishes, and soups can be prepared; fourth, it can lessen the
 burden on company commanders; and fifth, it can reduce the kitchen staff's labor
 strength.   The field kitchen is also equipped with 18 soft thermal bags, which solves
 the problem of sending hot meals and preserving their heat, under frigid conditions,
 to the troops.
 The 16 members of this battalion's kitchen staff are divided into a main cooking
 team, a secondary cooking team, and a service team.   The service team sets up three
 portable tents in a period of 10 to 20 minutes.  Each team, through close coordin-
 ation, prepares hot meals for over 300 persons in 1.5 hours.  Then they pack the
 meals in the thermal bags and send them by vehicles to the companies.  Under con-
 ditions of 30 degrees below zero centigrade, the meals maintain a temperature of

 above 70 degrees centigrade for 1 hour 20 minutes.  After this test, the cadres
 and fighters said that this kind of field kitchen meets operational requirements.
 The research institute has left this field kitchen with the unit for continued
 tests in order to further improve it.

 SUB DETACHMENT COMMANDER SETS RECORD FOR CRUISE DURATION
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 14 Feb 81 p 1
 [Article by staff reporter Luo Tongsong [5012 0681 2646]:  "He likes To Be a
 Pioneer"]
 [Text]  The submarine gracefully moored at the dock.
 Detachment Commander Xu Zhiming [6079 1807 2494] with vigorous strides descended
 from the control tower and was immediately surrounded by a welcoming crowd.  "De-
 tachment commander, you are really terrific:  to be far out at sea for so many days
 and still to be in ruddy health!"  "You are a real pioneer!"  Xu Zhiming, leading a
 submarine on a long-distance cruise test, had just set the record for the longest
 cruise by a submarine of our country's navy.
 In 1959, Xu Zhiming was transfered to take part in the People's Navy's pioneering
 work.  Studying diligently, he overcame one by one each tactical and technical
 difficulty.  By 1963, he had become an outstanding submarine captain.  The temper-
 ing of hard living over a long period of time gave him a fearless nature; no matter
 what difficult problem arose, he bravely challenged it.
 On 15 November 1979, JIEFANGJUN BAO reported in a lead item:  a certain submarine
 detachment has successfully tested angle-change firing of torpedoes.  This innova-
 tion was accomplished by the unit led by Xu Zhiming.  He also led his unit in
 studying and training in the difficult tactical and technical topics of a submerged
 submarine passing through an antisubmarine net, the underwater transport of recon-
 naissance soldiers, and coordinated attacks by submarines and the air arm.  He
 stands up under the pain of one failure after another and enjoys the joy of one
 success after another.
 Xu Zhiming is now engaged in testing a new topic--tactical mass drills.
 One day not long ago, black clouds rolled over the sea and waves were running high.
 Xu Zhiming commanded a submarine group that left the dock.  The submarines followed
 each other out of the harbor.  Another tactical group drill had begun.  As the sub-
 marine he was on reached the harbor mouth, a land signal station flashed this signal
 light message:  "Smooth sailing!"

 PROFICIENCY WITH WEAPONS AT HAND WILL OFFSET ENEMY'S SUPERIORITY
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 14 Feb 81 p 2
 [Article by staff special commentator:  "Place Emphasis on Proficient Use of Exist-
 ing Equipment"]
 [Text]  In ancient and modern Chinese and foreign military history, there is no
 lack of precedents in which a military force with backward weapons and equipment
 has defeated a military force with advanced weapons and equipment.  Admittedly,
 in these victories, there were many-sided factors--ingenious strategy and tactics,
 proper organizational command, brave fighting by officers and men, and advantages
 in weather, terrain, or soldiers--but without exception, they were closely connected
 with proficiency in the use of the weapons and equipment at hand.
 In ancient times, a warrior who was highly skilled in the martial arts could, with
 his bare hands, vanquish an opponent armed with a dagger, spear, sword, or halberd.
 In "Water Margin," the skilled stone-slinger Zhang Qing, "without an arrow in his
 quiver," used small stones to knock down, one by one, such brave heroes as Lin
 Chong, Lu Zhishen, and Wu Song.  In the closing years of the Qing dynasty, the
 skilled and bold Yihetuan [Boxers], in the battles to defend Lanfang and Zichulin,
 used daggers, spears, clubs, and cudgels, to repulse one after another many
 assaults by the Eight-Power Allied Forces armed with foreign rifles and cannon.
 With millet plus rifles, our army defeated foreign and domestic enemies equipped
 with airplanes and large artillery pieces and became famous in China and abroad.
 Thus, we see that superb martial arts and consumate techniques can make up for
 deficiencies in weapons and equipment and can narrow the gap between the enemy's
 superiority and our inferiority.
 Today, the times are different, and there has occurred a change in the object of our
 military operations.  The enemy we face possesses the most advanced weapons and
 equipment, and we are doubtlessly placed in a position of inferiority.  However, if
 only our commanders and fighters are able to see the reality of the enemy and our-
 selves, learn from the experience of history, bravely probe into tactics, and boldly
 develop techniques, then they certainly can, under conditions of using backward
 equipment, find methods to vanquish the enemy.
 "Backward equipment cannot be used to fight a modern war"--this is a fairly popular
 statement.  This statement reflects some unsound views.  So-called modern warfare
 means warfare under modern conditions.   It includes the two sides fighting a war

 with each using the most advanced weapons and equipment and also ordinary conven-
 tional weapons.  The facts will certainly not be as some people imagine, viz, that
 modern war is only a competition on the battlefield between sophisticated weapons
 and the victor can be decided by pushing buttons.  With the development of military
 science, guided missiles, nuclear weapons, space weapons, lasers and meteorological
 weapons have appeared, and tanks and aircraft are widely used.  Admittedly, this
 has increased to an unprecedented extent, the unexpectedness and destructiveness of
 war, and the capacity to fight at long range has been greatly increased, all of
 which has had a major effect on the course and outcome of. campaigns and battles;
 but we certainly cannot say that ordinary conventional weapons will not be used and
 that close combat and. night combat are obsolete.  No matter whether it is us or the
 enemy, the objective of attack is always to capture one hilltop after another, and
 the objective of defense is always to defend tenaciously one position after another.
 And the key to capturing hilltops and defending positions is close combat which
 depends on displaying the power of close-combat weapons.  This means that along
 with advanced means of transportation such as the airplane and railroad trains, one
 still must have domestic animals; along with electronic computers, one must still
 learn how to calculate with an abacus.   Compared with the products of advanced mili-
 tary science and technology, some of this equipment looks very primitive and very
 simple and crude, but in practice they are indispensable and cannot be ignored.
 Under specific conditions, backward weapons and equipment can even play a role that
 advanced weapons and equipment cannot.   In the world today, although the Soviet
 and American armies are among the best and are highly modernized, these armies still
 make conventional weapons the most basic equipment for training.   Take antitank
 operations for instance.  They pay attention in training to the use of tanks against
 tanks, aircraft against tanks, and guided missiles and nuclear weapons against tanks.
 At the same time, they also pay an extreme amount of attention in training to the
 use of light infantry weapons and conveniently manufactured equipment against tanks.
 The Soviet army demands that all of its rank- and file soldiers learn how to use
 light weapons against a tank's aiming and observation instruments, to use hand
 grenades, antitank mines, satchel charges, and rocket launchers against tanks, and
 it even trains the soldiers to jump on top of a tank, cover its observation instru-
 ment with a raincoat or smash it with a hammer.  The American army demands that its
 antitank guided missile operators also learn how to use rocket launchers, master
 basic demolition techniques, learn how to erect antitank barriers and use antitank
 mines, and learn how to make and use simple antitank equipment.  If the Soviet and
 American armies, with their already considerably modernized weapons and equipment,
 are still doing this, we have even less reason to ignore training with the equipment
 at hand.
 In comparison with those of the main object of a future war, our army's weapons and
 equipment is backward, but they are certainly not backward to an unparalleled de-
 gree, and even less are they backward to the degree that they cannot be used to
 fight a war.  With regard to this point, we must make a correct analysis and have a
 clear-headed understanding.  Beginning in the 1950's, our army developed from a
 single service arm to a combined arms force composed of all service arms.  Speaking
 of the kinds of weapons and equipment that the enemy has--aircraft, artillery, tanks,
 warships, guided missiles, nuclear weapons, etc--our army, by and large, has all of
 them; it is only that their quantity and quality are not up to those of the enemy.
 This is not a position of backwardness like that of the years in which the Yihetuan

 with rifles and cannon, and neither is it like the position of inferiority in the
 past when our army equipped with millet plus rifles faced enemies equipped with
 aircraft plus artillery.  We possess a definite material basis for defeating the
 enemy, and we must not underestimate our own capabilities.  In the 1960's, our air
 force with ordinary fighter planes shot down American high-altitude reconnaissance
 planes that were performing satisfactorily, our navy with torpedo boats sunk the
 Chiang clique's submarine chasers, and our ground farces used old-type antitank
 mines to blow up Soviet T-62 tanks.  We can see that the skillful mastery and use
 of existing weapons and equipment can mean the good conduct of and victory in war
 under modern conditions.
 Does placing stress on the proficient use of existing equipment mean we will not
 modernize our weapons and equipment?  Obviously not.  The problem is that when it
 is necessary to modernize our equipment we need a process.  At present, our state
 finances are in the red, our people are in difficulties, the entire national economy
 is in a period of further readjustment, and we cannot spend more money to improve
 our army's weapons and equipment.  Added to this are the restrictions imposed by
 our scientific and technological level and our production's technological level,
 which mean that we cannot be overanxious for quick results and expect to modernize
 overnight our army's weapons and equipment.   There is a saying in our China, viz,
 "Fit the appetite to the dishes and the dress to the figure," i.e., adapt oneself
 to circumstances.   There is also an old saying in our armed forces, viz, "Fight a
 war with whatever weapons you have."  The meaning of this is that, in handling
 affairs and thinking of problems, we must always face reality, seek truth from
 facts, and in everything proceed from reality.   The reality before us is that, with
 regard to weapons and equipment, the gap between the enemy's superiority and our
 inferiority is very big, and that this gap cannot be fundamentally changed within
 a short period of time.  Under these conditions, we cannot sit back and wait until
 our equipment is modernized before we train for and fight a war, but we should
 place emphasis on the proficient use of the existing-equipment in training for and
 fighting a war.  In fact, since history began, when two armies waged war against
 each other, the side with inferior equipment never waited until its equipment had-
 been completely improved before meeting the enemy's attack.  We are not reconciled
 to the backwardness of our weapons and equipment, but we also must train for and
 fight a war with the existing equipment--this is the correct conclusion.
 The key to placing emphasis on the proficient use of existing equipment, when all
 is said and done, is to make a great effort to learn, to study assiduously, and
 to work hard at training.  A common saying is:  "The skill in wielding the 18 kinds
 of weapons, i.e., the skill in various types of combat, depends on training."
 Much training can produce skill, much training can lead to skill offsetting one's
 lack of acument, much training can lead to superb skill and a good command one's
 occupational specialty, and much training can make soldiers brave and strong.
 Particularly in modern warfare, we cannot match the enemy in weapons and equipment.
 This situation requires that we redouble our efforts in training hard and master-
 ing the skills of using weapons and equipment better than the enemy, and make plans
 better than the enemy.  Some people say:  "What skills have been acquired by train-
 ing with the existing equipment?"
 Actually, this is not so, Comrades familiar with the situation obtaining in the
 troops' current training know that, after the smashing of the "gang of four," big

 results have been achieved in troop training, but there still exist many problems
 with regard to existing equipment.  For example, correcting for wind direction
 when using the 40-mm rocket launcher is still an old, big, and difficult problem
 armywide. Admittedly, this kind of problem has a bearing on the performance of
 taeapons and equipment, but it is mainly a problem of poor training, inadequate
 techniques, and not attaining proficiency in their use.  It must be borne in mind
 that it will not be easy to become proficient in the use of existing equipment
 and that this cannot be done without a lot of hard work and sweat.  From the
 mastery of the rifle and hand grenade to the operation of technical equipment like
 aircraft, warships, and guided missiles, every movement and essential point has a
 definite standard and scientific basis, and there must be thorough tempering in
 all of them before a high degree of proficiency can be obtained.  If, in peacetime,
 we master the use of existing equipment, when war breaks out we can have a high
 degree of proficiency and handle the equipment very efficiently sot that the
 victories on the battlefield will be big and our casualties small.  Practice in
 the war of self-defense counterattack against Vietnam completely proved this point.
 The proficient use of existing equipment is even more important for commanders.
 Some people feel that "to master weapons and equipment is mainly a concern for
 the fighters and is not of much concern for cadres."  This idea is extremely one-
 sided.  The fighters are the ones who directly operate the weapons and equipment,
 and their proficiency in the use of their weapons has an important effect on
 victory in war, but this certainly does not mean that cadres do not need to become
 proficient in the use of existing weapons and equipment.  On the contrary, the
 cadres should become even more skilled and proficient in their use.  From the point
 of view of training, the fighters' mastery of weapons and equipment depends on the
 cadres' instruction; from the point of view of combat, the fighters' role is dis-
 playing their techniques cannot be separated from the command of the cadres.  In
 particular, the commander of a combined arms force not only must be proficient in
 the use of his own unit's weapons and equipment, but also must be familiar with
 what strength can be obtained from the weapons and equipment of other service
 arms; not only must know well their tactical and technical performance, but also
 must understand the principles of their application.  In this way, the weapons and
 equipment can be put into position, brought together, and combined.  If this is not
 done, it will be very difficult to display the whole power of the weapons and
 equipment and their coordinated operations.  In the history of our country, every-
 body is familiar with the story of how the famous military strategist, Sun Bin,
 helped Tianji win a horse race against King Wei of Qi state by advising him to "pit
 your slowest team of four horses against his fastest team, your fastest team
 against his medium-fast team, and your medium-fast team against his slowest team."
 The secret was that Sun Bin knew the strength of the horses, and he deployed them
 properly and used them skillfully.  It can be seen from this that, for a commander,
 a big factor in securing victory is to be extremely knowledgable about and adept
 in using the existing equipment.
 Like other things, the mastery of weapons and equipment is a process of proceeding
 from the simple to the complex, from the lower level to the higher level.  The
 complex is contained in the simple, the higher level stands on the lower level.
 Modernized weapons and equipment were developed on the basis of existing weapons
 and equipment.  There is a big difference between them, but there is also a mutual
 relationship.  In this sense, only by proficiently mastering existing weapons and

 equipment can we lay a firm foundation and create conditions for the mastery of
 modernized weapons in the future.  If only the entire army, from top to bottom,
 gets to work on this together, with everybody using their brains to think of ways
 of proficiently using the existing equipment, really training every day with the
 weapons at hand, regularly training in the skills of killing the enemy, working
 with perseverance, and keeps improving, then the army certainly can train so. that
 it will be able to defeat a superior force with an inferior force and obtain the
 skills of fighting a modern war.

 OVER 800 LEI FENC ACTIVISTS EMERGE AMONG SHENYANG ENGINEERS
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 24 Feb 81 p 1
 [Article by Jia Hua [0328 5478] et al.:  "A Great Development of the Lei Feng
 Spirit; 'Flowers of Civilization' Appear Everywhere in the Barracks"]
 [Text]  On 15 February, from a meeting to exchange experiences in learning from
 Lei Feng held by the engineers of the Shenyang Units, where Lei Feng was stationed
 when alive, came good news:  In the past year, 864 activists in learning from Lei
 Feng have emerged among the engineers.  This was the 18th batch of activists in
 learning from Lei Feng which has emerged among the engineers of the Shenyang Units
 since the party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong issued the call "Learn.
 from Comrade Lei Feng."
 In the period of time since then, the party committees at all levels of these
 engineers have resisted the unhealthy trend toward negating the revolutionary
 spirit, integrated education in the revolutionary outlook on life, and organized
 the masses of cadres and soldiers to review the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and the
 calls by Comrade Mao Zedong and other proletarian revolutionaries of the older
 generation to learn from Comrade Lei Feng.  Some units have also launched a dis-
 cussion on "whether it is necessary to develop the Lei Feng spirit while engaging
 in the four modernizations."  Each unit has adopted the forms of experience-
 exchange meetings, public lectures, story-telling sessions, slide shows, art exhi-
 bitions, blackboard newspapers, and literary and art performances to penetratingly
 publicize Lei Feng's revolutionary spirit of being clear about what to hate and
 what to love, keeping one's word, being selfless, being oblivious to one's own
 safety, engaging in arduous struggle, and finding it a pleasure to help others; to
 publicize the importance of developing the revolutionary spirit in establishing
 socialist ethics and habits and in constructing the four modernizations in good
 fashion; and to publicize the advanced models among the engineers in learning from
 Lei Feng and in making contributions to the construction of the four modernizations,
 so that the cadres and fighters will quickly strengthen their resolve to learn
 from Comrade Lei Feng under the new historical conditions and will further establish
 a new style of learning from Lei Feng in order to contribute to a high tide in con-
 structing and defending the four modernizations.
 Among the large batch of activists in learning from Lei Feng who have emerged,
 there are advanced models who, like Lei Feng, ardently love the party, who support
 the party's line and its general and specific policies with concrete actions, and
 who consciously put the individual's interests at the service of the revolution's

 interests.  The current leader of the "Lei Feng squad," Song Ruobo [1345 5387
 3134],
 is a veteran fighter of 4 years' service and all along he has been nurtured by
 the
 company to become a cadre.  But the leadership, because of work requirements,
 did
 not transfer him to the training unit for study.  Someone said to him:  "In the
 past 10 years the leaders of. the 'Lei Feng squad' have all been promoted to cadre,
 but you have lost out by taking this post."  He replied:  "One doesn't become the
 leader of the 'Le Feng squad' in order to 'benefit from association with it' but
 in order to 'do one's best, however little it might be.'  Le Feng did so many good
 things for the people, yet when he sacrificed his life he was still a 'sergeant.'
 I want, like him, to be a compulsory serviceman who serves the people heart and
 .soul."  He still, as in the past, enthusiastically does good work in the squad and
 leads all its members to do good things for the local masses, and at the end of the
 year he was again elected a Lei Feng activist.  Among the activists elected this
 time, there were many persons who, like Lei Feng, arduously studied the techniques
 of their military occupations for the sake of the revolution and who are striving to
 become fighters who are both Red and-expert.  Huang Lingxiang [7806 0407 43821, a
 fighter of a certain engineering regiment, entered the service as recently as 1977,
 when he was assigned to do preparation and experiemntal work on liquid explosives.
 Not fearing difficulties, while taking part in the work of preparing and testing
 liquid explosives for 3 years, he carried forward the "nail" spirit, and studied by
 himself the specialized theoretical knowledge of higher mathematics, organic
 chemistry, and explosives theory and the Japanese and English languages, read and
 studied some Chinese and foreign technical materials, and took part in the compila-
 tion of a technical report on five experiments.  In.December of last year, the
 academic committee of a certain research institute appraised the part he wrote in
 the technical report as up to the standard of a state technician.
 Among the over 800 activists in learning from Lei Feng, there are even more who are
 models in the communist style of finding pleasure in helping others.  At different
 posts they have learned from Lei Feng a new work style and made a great effort to
 be pioneers in constructing the socialist spiritual civilization.  Platoon leader
 Tao Guochang [7118 0948 7022], of the 2d Company of a certain pontoon bridge regi-
 ment, last year took his entire platoon to Yuanju ward of Dandong city, where,
 while doing guard duty and patrolling in order to protect public order, they
 bravely and resourcefully dealt a blow to the criminal activities of lawbreakers.:
 He organized all members of his platoon, during the times between being on guard
 duty, to hold the old by the arm and the young by the hand, to push carts and give
 up their seats on buses to others, to repair roads, and fill ditches, to remove
 rubbish, and to help working couples and solitary old people by buying things.for
 them, and helped factories by hauling bricks and unloading goods, etc., doing a
 great deal of good works.  Under the influence of their model behavior, the social
 atmosphere of the entire neighborhood underwent a big change, and the masses have
 warmly commended them for bringing a civilized style to the neighborhood.

 GENERAL POLITICAL DEPARTMENT ISSUES CIRCULAR ON LEI FENG ACTIVITY
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 24 Feb 81 p 1
 [Article: "People Are Talking About Spiritual Civilization, Each One Striving to
 Become a Lei Feng-Style Revolutionary Armyman"]
 [Text]  The General Political Department recently issued throughout the army a
 "circular on launching a deepgoing activity to learn from Lei Feng, to learn from
 heroic models, and to build a highly developed socialist spiritual civilization."
 The circular stresses:  The launching of this deepgoing activity is of major
 significance for smoothly and thoroughly implementing the major policy put forward
 by the party Central Committee with regard to realizing further economic readjust-
 ment and further political stability, for nurturing the younger generation to be
 successors to the cause of proletarian revolution, for carrying forward our party's
 and our army's fine traditions, for strengthening the building of modernized revo-
 lutionary armed forces, and for improving our army's combat effectiveness.
 The circular says that recently the party Central Committee instructed that pub-
 licity on a grand scale must be given to the building of a highly developed socialist
 spiritual civilization.  The all-army political work conference raised demands in
 this regard.   This year on 5 March is the 18th anniversary of the call to learn
 from Lei Feng issued by Comrade Mao Zedong and other revolutionaries of the older
 generation.  At present, to launch a deepgoing activity to learn from Lei Feng, to
 learn from heroic models, and to build a highly developed socialist spiritual
 civilization is an important measure in carrying out the Central Committee's in-
 struction and the spirit of the all-army political work conference.
 The circular urges that there be vigorous publicizing of the major significance of
 learning from Lei Feng and learning from him in the new situation, learning from
 heroic models, and building a highly developed socialist spiritual civilization.
 The broad masses of officers and men must be educated to deeply understand that Lei
 Feng was a great communist fighter nurtured to maturity by Marxisim-Leninism-Mao
 Zedong Thought.  The spirit of Lei Feng and the ideology and moral character of
 many, many heroic models embodies in a concentrated fashion the highly developed
 socialist spiritual civilization and are vivid teaching materials for building the
 spiritual civilization.   Each unit must employ many forms of this activity--e.g.,
 holding public lectures, symposiums, experience-exchange meetings, and soirees,
 running blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers, and organizing book-reading and
 newspaper-reading sessions--thereby making the mobilization and educational work

 lively and down-to-earth.  The cadres must be organized in a planned way to read
 "The Story of Lei Feng," "Selections From Lei Feng's Diary," and "The Story of
 Lei Feng" and to study Comrade Mao Zedong's "Serve the People," "In Memory of
 Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Combat Liber-
 alism," to study Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "How to Be a Good Communist," as well as the
 expositions of other revolutionaries of the older generation concerning the establish-
 ment of communist ideals and ethics.  They can also select from and study relevant
 expositions by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.  This will further raise awareness
 with regard to ideological theory.  In launching this activity, they must further
 strengthen education on the four basic principles and on the party's line and its
 general and specific policies since the 3d Plenary Session of its [11th] Central
 Committee.  They must continue to criticize the attacks on and distortions of the
 spirit of Lei Feng and Communist ideology and ethics made by Lin Biao and the "gang
 of four."  They must rebut all sorts of mistaken opinions that negate revolutionary
 slogans, such as "Don't seek the slightest advantage for oneself but strive to
 benefit others" and "Fear neither hardship nor death," and clarify such confused
 ideas as "Lei Feng's spirit is outdated" and "If one learns from Lei Feng one will
 suffer losses."
 The circular also urges that the focal point in launching the activity be the basic
 level, and that the tasks of all military occupations and professions must be inte-
 grated, and that the strengthening of the building of basic-level party branches and
 of CYL work must be integrated.   The party branches and the CYL branches must make
 concrete plans and take practical measures to commend the advanced and to set.good
 examples.  Party members and CYL members must play the leading role in doing well
 in this activity.  Political organizations at all levels, especially the regimental
 political organizations, must strengthen their concrete leadership in supervising
 and speeding up this activity and in summing up and popularizing experiences; leading
 cadres at all levels must teach by personal example as. well as verbal instruction,
 earnestly practice what they advocate, and continually deepen this activity.   The
 newspapers and periodicals of units must create a large amount of public opinion
 for learning from Lei Feng, learning from heroic models, and building a spiritual
 civilization; they must vigorously publicize the spirit of Lei Feng and the advanced
 ideology and deeds of Lei Feng-type cadres and fighters in every occupation and
 profession in the army.   The literary and art workers in the units must create more
 works--novels, dramas, folk art forms, poems, songs, and paintings--that reflect
 noble sentiments and are beneficial to the building of a highly developed socialist
 spiritual civilization.   Through this activity the spirit of Lei Feng will strike
 more roots in people's hearts, everybody in the army will begin to talk about
 spiritual civilization, and there will be a high'.tide of each and every person
 striving to become Lei Feng-type revolutionary armymen.

 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 24 Feb 81 p 2
 [Article by staff correspondent Li Yuchang [7812 3768 2490] and staff reporter
 Zheng Zongqun [6774 1350 5028]:  "Young Technician Xiao Jing by Diligent Self-Study
 Becomes 'Local Expert"']
 [Text]   "Struggle arduously in life, quietly immerse oneself in work."  This is the
 motto of young technician Xiao Jing [5135 2529] of a signal engineer battalion of
 the Fuzhou Units.  For 3 years he has. assiduously studied his military occupational
 specialty, repairing 940 pieces (sets) of electronic instruments and devices used
 in training the units for prepardness against war and saving the state over 200,000
 yuan in maintenance costs.
 In 1976, Xiao Jing joined the army and came to the repair shop of the signal engi-
 neer battalion.                   Faced with complicated electronic instruments, he resolved to make
 a great effort to master the technology of his occupational speciality.  His life
 is simple and he never carelessly spends a cent, but in buying job-related books he
 doesn't stint in the least.  Besides subscribing to the magazines RADIO, ELECTRONIC
 WORLD, AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, he has bought over 130 books related to his job
 and uses every bit of spare time in self-study.  For several years he has completed
 by self-study a university course in electronics, and took the opportunity of busi-
 ness trips and visits to his family to seek to learn more skills from his former
 teachers and to obtain solutions to knotty problems.
 Owing to diligent self-study, he has gradually mastered the techniques of maintain-
 ing in good repair every kind of signal communications instrument and has become a
 "local expert" who stands out from his fellows engaged in the same work in the
 Fuzhou Units.  The quality of his maintenance and innovation on some instruments is
 quite good.   For example, take the M-17 frequency-selection electronic plane measure-
 ment instrument [M-17 xing xuan-pin than ping ceshiyi 0092 6693 7340 7193 1627 3261
 .6107 0308].   Its bulk was cumbersome and its quality low, and it frequently broke
 down.  After many tests, Xiao Jing successfully developed a new measuring instru-
 ment, greatly reduced in bulk and weighing 1 jin as compared to the other instru-
 ments' 90 jin.  Moreover, the power supply for the instrument was changed from al-
 ternating electrical current to passive circuitry, so that it can be used where
 there is no electrical power supply.  The manufacturing cost for the new instrument
 as opposed to the original instrument fell from 13,000 yuan to 30 yuan.  After trial-
 use for nearly 1 year, it was proved that the instrument's design was rational and
 its performance good.

 Xiao Jing frequently goes to work sites to do rush repairs on instruments, for-
 saking food and sleep.  Once, just as the 5th Company was laying underground cable
 at a certain place six instruments broke down.  After receiving this assignment,
 he worked 46 hours in succession and repaired all the instruments.  In August of
 last year, his unit was equipped with a batch of instruments imported from abtoad
 and, in order to put these advanced instruments as quickly as possible into the
 service of the modernization of national defense signal communications, Xiao Jing
 worked extra shifts and extra hours to translate the data and written materials
 concerning them, to find out their operational laws, and also took in hand and
 taught the work personnel of concerned units how to use them.   In the past 2 years,
 Xiao Jing has taken the initiative, for his own unit and fraternal units, to train
 five signal electronic instruments technicians.
 Xiao Jing's cultivation of his talent through self-study in order to accelerate the
 achievements in modernizing the signal communications of his unit has been commended
 by his comrades.  In May 1978, he had the honor of being admitted into the party
 and after 1 year he was promoted to the rank of technician.

 CRACK INSTRUCTOR GROUP--The artillery regiment of a certain division of the Beijing
 Units has organized some comrades who are comparatively expert in military affairs
 to use their spare time to study and provide new methods for good training.  The
 companies call them a "brain trust" that provides timely help.  Most of the eight
 members of this "brain trust" were trained in military academies and schools and
 are familiar with the existing equipment in artillery units and furthermore possess
 a certain amount of experience in organizing training.   For over 2 months, they
 have made over 10 suggestions for good training.  For example, focusing on the idea
 reflected by "a modern war cannot be fought with the existing equipment," they have
 collected materials on specific battles, both by Chinese and foreign armies, in
 which an inferior force defeated a superior force, and have suggested that each
 company analyze and study "whether one is proficient in the weapons at hand" and
 "what existing training methods need to be reformed."  Also, in line with the degree
 of difficulty in special techniques, they suggested provisions for suitably shorten-
 ing or extending the number of training days; based on the special strengths of
 artillery and its characteristic of requiring mutual coordination, they suggested
 that the special establishment for training be changed from the former system, in
 which the company was the unit, to a system in.which the battalion is the unit.  In
 addition, they have'separately gone to battalions to help instructors prepare classes
 and compile teaching materials.  With the "brain trust" continually offering advice
 and suggestions, the regiment's basic training has attained gratifying results.
 On 20 February, the higher level made a preliminary check and acceptance examination
 in which the regiment's results were rated good and above.   [Text]   [Beijing

 FIGHTER PLANE TRAINING--Two combat regiments of a certain air division of the
 Nanjing Units air force mutually help and learn from each other in training, and
 have separately obtained first and second place in the firing examination for air
 force fighter plane units and have been collectively cited for meritorious service,
 first and second class.  In a circular issued on 6 February, the air force commended
 them.  Regiment B, which in team total points placed second, obtained first and
 third places, with the company as the unit in fighter plane units, during an air
 force firing and bombing competition in 1978.  This time, when the competition in
 cannon firing at ground targets began, one pilot scored 27 points.  Regiment A was
 unwilling to be left behind; its pilot Zhao Haichen [6392 3189 1820] scored 43
 points, breaking Regiment B's record.  After Regiment B learned of Regiment A's
 good results, its commander, Yin Chenglin [1438 2110 2651], immediately went to

 Regiment A and requested instructions in the main points of its methods.  Without
 the slightest reservation, Regiment A briefed him on its experiences.  Regiment B
 then immediately organized its pilots to hold a discussion and.found out problems
 universally existing in the regiment, such as poor equilibrium while piloting planes
 and inaccurate data concerning corrections for sidewinds.  The regiment and
 battalion leaders one by one helped the pilots to overcome their technical diffi-
 culties.  Regiment B then obtained good results in firing rockets at ground targets;
 when Regiment A heard about this achievement, it took the initiative to learn from
 Regiment B's experience.  Mutually helping and learning from each other, these
 two regiments fly wing to wing.   In the competition results, Regiment A's average
 individual score was 1289.3, placing first; Regiment B's average individual score
 was 1188.6, placing second.   [Text]   [Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 24 Feb 81

 SOLDIERS RELEASED FOR TRAINING--A certain garrison division of the Guangzhou Units,
 cherishing its soldiers as a treasure, has deeply tapped latent potentialities so
 that 97 percent of the-companies will receive comprehensive training this year.   In
 January, when the divisional party committee was drawing up the training tasks,
 each of the subordinate regiments asked how the companies were to handle the con-
 struction and production tasks.  The divisional party committee appointed the leading
 cadres who are in charge of military training work to lead a work team into the
 units and make an investigation, after which the committee made a decision:  Con-
 struction work that exceeds objective conditions and is outside the plan will de-
 finitely not be done, construction projects that are not urgent at present will as
 much as possible be considered for the future, and soldiers will not be assigned
 special work on projects that can be done in their spare time.  Based on this guiding
 thought, the committee canceled-two projects outside the plan and changed three
 projects originally called for by the-plan to ones that would be done in the soldiers'
 spare time, thereby allowing five companies to receive comprehensive training in
 turn.  With regard to a small farm along the beach run by a certain regiment, the
 committee, proceeding from reality, improved its production management methods,
 and drew from several companies a small number of personnel to divide up the work
 of joint management, and withdrew the reconnaissance company that had been responsi-
 ble for production tasks and put it into training.  Over 150 fighters last year were
 engaged in production in the division's farms.   This year, by scientifically arrang-
 ing for fish rearing, pig feeding, and sugarcane planting, 28 soldiers were withdrawn
 from the farms back to their companies to take part in training.   [Text]   [Beijing

 LOGISTICS FOR TRAINING--On 6 February, two trucks were driven into the remote bivouac
 area of the 4th Battalion.  Hearing the sounds, the fighters went to meet the trucks
 and helped to unload medicines, beancurd, paper, equipment, flour and other goods
 and materials.  This was the first delivery to the battalion's companies by the
 logistical department of a certain unit in order to insure supplies for the com-
 panies' new annual training program.   To insure that the new annual training program
 gets off to a good start, the leaders of the regiment had, integrating with the
 basic level, suggested to the logistical department that it overcome the work style
 of "putting on airs, not going down to the companies, and finding it to be too much
 trouble to make deliveries to the 'front door."'  Personnel of each section of the
 logistics department resolved to do many good things for the companies.  Before
 training began, they dispatched two trucks with urgently needed goods and materials

 to the 4th Battalion, which was separated by an 8-li road from its parent organiza-
 tion.  Comrades of the ordnance, ordnance repair, and medical sections also went to
 each company and handed out the goods and materials, repaired equipment, and helped
 to solve actual problems.   [Text]   [Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 24 Feb 8 p 2]
 TRAINING TARGETS LOWERED--At the beginning of February, the party committee of a
 certain regiment of the Shenyang Units reconsidered the new annual training plan
 and decided, proceeding from the reality of the unit, to act according to the unit's
 capability and to lower some targets that had been set too high.  When studying the
 relevant documents of the central authorities, the committee linked the high targets
 for training set last year to the fact that in the. yearend test the 1st Battalion
 only reached half the targets and that the 2d and 3d battalions did not completely
 reach the targets.  The committee members felt that, under the influence of the
 leftist ideology in the past, in training work, as in other work, it became a habit
 to set high targets divorced from reality, with the result that the enthusiasm of
 the masses for training was dampened and.the quality of the training was adversely
 affected.  Therefore, the committee organized the leading cadres and the comrades
 concerned in the regiment to investigate the new annual training plan and to solicit
 the opinions of cadres and fighters.   The plan and its targets were then revised.
 The original plan called for the lst Battalion, as the other battalions, to reach a
 target of 50 percent in the "three proficiencies."  The committee noted that over
 the recent 2 years the 1st Battalion had been engaged in construciton work so that
 its training foundation was weak, while the other battalions had been training for
 over 2 years.  Obviously the target for the 1st Battalion were set too high, and
 the committee lowered it to 30 percent.   The number of instrument training exercises
 for new soldiers was reduced from the original 1-5 to 1-3.  The target for the
 average results of new soldiers in rifle training exercises was lowered from excel-
 lent to good and above.  By seeking truth from facts with regard to training targets,
 the fighters' enthusiasm for training was aroused to an even greater degree.   [Text]
