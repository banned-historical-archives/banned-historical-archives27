 Ayatollah Beheshti's remarks on the hostage issue yesterday
 reflect an apparent desire to keep his political options open.
 The Islamic Republic Party chief commented that it
 might be possible to pardon the hostages without a trial,
 if a political resolution of the crisis could be reached.
 He added, however, that the National Assembly might not
 consider the issue until June or July.   (U)
 An astute politician, Beheshti is likely to follow
 shifts in the public mood closely.   He is careful to
 avoid taking an unambiguous position on the hostages that
 could leave him open to criticism.   His maneuvering re-
 flects his judgment that his party?s political survival
 depends upon continued support from the Iranian masses.
 Relations With Iraq
 Both countries, however, continue to exchange propa-
 ganda attacks.   Tehran Radio yesterday evidently called
 for a "holy war" to overthrow the regime in Baghdad.   (U)

 Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in turn is calling
 for Iranians to overthrow Khomeini and is demanding that
 Iran agree to restore Iraq's full sovereignty over the
 waterway between the two countries.   The Iraqi leader
 also is saying that Iran must withdraw from the three
 disputed islands in the Persian Gulf and acknowledge the
 rights of Iran's Arab minority in Khuzestan Province,   (U)
 nearly all members of the diplomatic community there
 have concluded that Iraq neither wants nor expects a
 wider war with Iran.   The Iranians' inferior military
 position makes it unlikely they will initiate major
 hostilities.   The level of emotion on both sides is high,
 however, and minor border clashes could easily lead to
 a confrontation.
 Ghotbzadeh's moderate comments may have been in
 preparation for a trip to various Arab countries now
 apparently scheduled to begin Saturday.   He had post-
 poned a trip to Syria and Algeria, and press reports
 indicate he now may also visit Lebanon, Bahrain, and
 Kuwait.   (U)
 EC Meetings on Iran
 The EC political directors-at the request of Italy
 and France--are meeting in Rome this afternoon to lay
 the groundwork for the EC foreign ministers' session
 next Tuesday on Iran.  Meanwhile in Strasbourg, the EC
 Commission is expected today to recommend to the foreign
 ministers an EC embargo on exports to Iran.

 USSR:   May Day Slogans
 This year's May Day slogans of the Central Committee deem-
 phasize the importance of relations with the US and reflect the
 increasingly             ?  recent Soviet pronouncements on foreign
 policy issues, ~         7
 "nonuse of force" has also been dropped.
 The absence of any reference in the slogans to the
 Soviet peace programs of 1971 and 1976 or to the Con-
 ference on Security and Cooperation in Europe suggests a
 tougher Soviet stance toward issues associated with de-
 tente.   The appeal to the "people of the US and Canada"
 for cooperation has been dropped, and the reference to
 detente is in the context of struggling against the
 "threat of a new world war."  The usual call for the
 in South and Southwest Asia.
 The slogans on both Afghanistan and Iran have been
 changed in ways that point to greater Soviet equity and
 concern in the region.   Afghanistan is now credited with
 "courageously defending the achievements of the April
 revolution" instead of last year?s reference to the "path
 of building a new society,"   The reference to Iran's
 struggle against "imperialist interference" highlights
 the threatening Soviet view of that situation.   A slogan
 on India has been added, reflecting Moscow's concern for
 strengthening ties with Prime Minister Gandhi?s regime
 as a counter to regional opposition to the Soviet role
 industry and machine building.
 Certain slogans on domestic issues indirectly sug-
 gest that there will be even more belt-tightening than
 usual for the Soviet consumer.   For the first time in
 several years, there is no reference to satisfying the
 consumer needs, but there is greater emphasis on heavy
 tional environment than last year's slogans.

 The Soviets'  slogan on Europe indicates that they
 will intensify their efforts to create frictions within
 NATO.   Instead of the usual reference to "imperialist
 plans" for deploying new weapons on the continent, this

 "new American nuclear-missile weapons."   The reference

 Beiiina has again urged the US to exercise restraint toward
 A commentary published in People's Daily on Sunday
 stated that the US decision to break diplomatic ties
 and the "strong reaction" in Iran "will bring further
 deterioration in US-Iranian relations which is obviously
 not in the interests of both countries."   The commentary
 reiterated Beijing's principal concern that the US and
 Iran avoid giving the Soviets any opportunity that they
 can exploit.
 On the same day the Xinhua news agency described
 Soviet tactics designed ultimately to gain control over
 Persian Gulf oil sources.   The report cited Western
 media claims that Soviet forces could seize Iranian oil-
 fields and Tehran before the US could take effective
 counteraction.
 The Chinese have sent a new ambassador to Tehran
 and are likely to continue efforts to cultivate Iran
 while distancing themselves from US sanctions.   Beijing
 has avoided a hectoring tone in counseling US restraint,
 while appealing to the US and Iran to pursue a peaceful
 settlement.

 On the eve of independence, the short-term prospects are good
 for Zimbabwe,
 Prime Minister Robert Mugabe?s conciliatory posture
 toward his former adversaries and his moderate policy
 positions have reassured the country?s whites, Western
 investors and donors,  and South Africa.   Moreover, his
 landslide victory in the election and his credentials
 as a nationalist leader should enable him to meet black
 demands for change at a moderate pace.
 Despite these factors, Mugabe faces some serious
 problems:
 -- The integration of the former Rhodesian
 security forces with his and Joshua Nkomo's
 guerrilla armies into a new national army
 will be a difficult task.
 -- Militants in Mugabe?s highly factionalized
 party and army will want recognition of and
 rewards for their long years of fighting;
 some believe that Mugabe is being overly
 accommodating toward Nkomo and the whites.
 -- Nkomo, who is the leader of the important
 Ndebele-speaking minority, may become frus-
 trated with his subordinate position as Home
 Minister and seek to undermine Mugabe.
 We do not expect these problems to bring down the
 new regime in the short term, and they may be averted
 over the longer term.   If Mugabe were assassinated or
 if there were a large-scale white exodus,  the political
 situation would unravel.

 UK:   Strategic Deterrent
 The Thatcher government almost certainly will procure Trident
 missiles from the US as the major part of an effort to maintain
 obsolescence.
 The government wants to retain a credible strategic
 deterrent to support its new foreign policy activism,
 but details have not been revealed in the new annual
 defense white paper.   The recently announced "Chevaline"
 program is designed to extend the effectiveness of the
 Polaris system for more than another decade, but Polaris,
 like the aging British bomber fleet,  is approaching
 Soviet territory.
 A successor to the Polaris will have to be announced
 within the next few months.   Trident missiles fitted
 with warheads will almost certainly be the choice.   In
 launching the $10 billion replacement program, the Brit-
 ish probably will build five new submarines, each cap-
 able of carrying at least 16 missiles.  A Trident
 capability would permit the UK to strike deeper into
 missiles.
 Selection of the Trident will not preclude the
 option of turning to cruise missiles.   The new Tornado
 aircraft, to be phased in during the early 1980s, can
 carry two cruise missiles.   The UK, moreover, has a
 large fleet of modern surface ships capable of carrying
 cruise missiles, with more on order.   The adoption of the
 underwater-launched Trident ballistic missile makes it
 unlikely that London would equip submarines with cruise
 of 160 US cruise missiles in the UK.
 Since the UK's final announcement will be keyed to
 its own national deterrence program, opting either for
 Trident or cruise missiles--or both--would not affect
 NATO's theater nuclear force modernization and arms con-
 trol program.   Although basing details must still be
 worked out, the government has agreed to the stationing

 LIBERIA:   Cautious Optimism
 The security situation in Monrovia remained stable yesterday,
 and the government bureaucracu is fiunctioning; however, a severe
 rice shortage could occur.
 Business returned to near normal, although banking
 restrictions are hampering activity somewhat.   The trials
 of former government officials reportedly have begun, but
 the outcome is not known.   Former Foreign Minister Joseph
 Chesson was the first to appear.
 The ruling military coun-

 The threat of a critical shortage of rice remains.
 Although the Liberian Government has taken some steps to
 secure new supplies,                                     for about
 10 days at the end o     is month supplies wi-Li be de-
 pleted until new shipments have arrived.   Such a shortage
 could seriously undermine the popularity and credibility
 of the Doe government and raises the threat of further
 violence.

 IRAQ:   Crackdown on Shia Opposition
 The government is mounting a campaign to suppress Shia Muslim
 dissidents, who are being encouraged by Iranian civilian and
 religious leaders.
 Both antiregime violence and Baathist efforts to
 repress it have increased since the assassination attempt
 on a senior Iraqi official on 1 April.   Antigovernment
 incidents have occurred in Baghdad and in the predomi-
 nantly Shia southern part of the country,  including the
 religious centers at Karbala and An Najaf.
 a number of
 Iraqi military otticers were executed recently for pro-
 Khomeini proselytizing in the armed forces.   Other
 arrests and executions may have taken place. Iraq has
 expelled perhaps as many as 17,000 Shias of Iranian
 ancestry over the past several days.
 The government announced last week that any Iraqi
 associated with the Da'wa Party, an extremist Shia
 organization, will be executed.   Baghdad claims the
 group has ties with Iran,  Iraqi Kurdish rebels,  and
 Communists and says that it has seized arms and explo-
 sives belonging to the organization.
 The reputed head of the party, Ayatollah Baqr Sadr,
 has been under house arrest since last June but may
 recently have been moved to a prison in Baghdad.   Rumors
 circulated this week that he had been executed.   Sadr's
 death at the hands of the Iraqi regime would hand Shia
 activists and their Iranian backers an emotional issue
 around which they could rally support and could set off
 the antiregime outburst in Iraq that Iranian leaders
 have been calling for.

 COLOMBIA:   Possible Negotiating Error
 President Turbay appears to be in a no-win situa-
 tion.   Apparently in response to foreign pressure, he
 permitted the terrorists in the Dominican Embassy to
 establish contact with their imprisoned leader, whose
 release has been the terrorists' key demand.   Turbay
 had hoped that the leader would agree that his followers
 had accomplished most of their goals and should now
 The terrorist leader, however, reportedly has re-
 corded a message urging the terrorists to stick to their
 demands.   If the terrorists are allowed to receive the
 message, they almost certainly again will harden their
 negotiating position.   If Turbay does not pass them the
 response, he will be accused of bad faith and will risk
 having the negotiations stall entirely.
 CUBA-PERU:   Impasse Broken
 Two Costa Rican aircraft carrying 235 of some 10,000
 Cubans who had sought political asylum at the Peruvian
 Embassy in Havana arrived yesterday in San Jose, marking
 the beginning of a regular shuttle between the two
 capitals.   In addition to the US,  six other countries
 have agreed to accept a total of 6,300 Cubans.
 Argentina, Portugal,  and Belgium have indicated they may
 accept small numbers of the remainder.   Some 20 Western
 Hemisphere and West European nations--citing adverse
 domestic political repercussions, economic reasons, and
 concern that Cuban agents have been placed among the
 refugees--have refused to accept any.

 USSR:   Economic Denial Program
 A 1.6-million-ton increase during the past week in
 confirmed grain sales to the USSR still leaves the So-
 viets roughly 12 million tons short of their pre-embargo
 target of grain import deliveries for the year ending
 30 September 1980.   The increase, which brings total
 confirmed sales to 7.2 million tons, includes 1.1 million
 tons of Argentine corn and sorghum and 400,000 tons of
 Romanian corn.  A recent statement by the director of
 the USSR's grain procurement agency calling into question
 the status of the Long-Term Trade Agreement with the US
 appears designed to create pressure on the US to relax
 the embargo.  The Soviets have a large need for grain
 to support their livestock program, and we doubt that
 they are willing to forego US grain supplies at this
 time.
 CHINA:   Key Political Appointment
 confirmed his rise to the top level of Politburo leader-
 ship.                        When the full National People's Congress session
 convenes in August,  Zhao may be elevated to the position
 of senior vice premier, now held by Deng, or to the
 premiership, currently held by party chairman Hua Guofeng.
 The appointment yesterday of Zhao Ziyang--a close
 associate of Deng Xiaoping--as one of two new Vice Pre-
 miers was expected after the party plenum in February

 EASTERN EUROPE:   Slowing Economic Growth
 Economic growth slowed last year in all six East
 European countries that belong to the Warsaw Pact.  Ac-
 cording to Western estimates, growth rates ranged from
 3.5 percent in Romania to zero in Poland.   The overall
 slow growth was caused by a continuing falloff in pro-
 ductivity gains in industry, by curbs imposed on imports
 to help reduce mounting payments deficits with hard cur-
 rency countries, and by last year's bad weather that
 adversely affected East European agricultural production.
 MALI:   Setback for Opposition
 President Traore apparently put down a challenge to
 his rule last week when his principal opponent, party
 leader Colonel Diarra, was sent to East Berlin ostensibly
 for medical treatment.   Traore remains on shaky ground,
 however, as Mali's economy continues to deteriorate and
 as many junior Army officers support Diarra.

 Other Arabs believe Assad is in serious trouble and
 are looking for ways either to protect themselves from
 spillover effects or to expand their influence at Syria's
 expense.   Jordan and Fatah, the largest Palestinian
 group, are settling their differences, and both seem to
 be moving closer to Iraq, although Fatah is taking a more
 cautious approach.   For their part, the Iraqis are ex-
 panding their contacts and influence in Lebanon and may
 have increased their support for Assad's domestic oppo-
 continue to control the West Bank.
 The Israelis' perception of growing instability in
 Syria and concern about Soviet influence there will make
 the Begin government more resistant to concessions in
 the Palestinian autonomy negotiations with Egypt.   Syrian
 instability also will reinforce the conviction of Prime
 Minister Begin and his coalition allies that Israel must
 fellow Arab.
 Egypt's President Sadat probably is pleased to see
 one of his most outspoken critics in trouble, but at the
 same time almost certainly is concerned about possible
 adverse regional effects.   The Egyptians and the Saudis
 fear the effects that Syrian unrest could have on Jordan
 and that Moscow may expand its military presence to pro-
 tect Assad.   Some Egyptians also worry about the possi-
 bility of an Israeli preemptive strike against Syria
 and the pressure that would ensue for Egypt to aid a
 of a successor regime have been worked out.
 The Jordanians and the Palestinians will be still
 less willing to risk entering peace talks while Syria
 is in turmoil.   While they welcome increased room for
 maneuver, they remain reluctant to act decisively until
 it becomes clear that Assad will survive or the policies
 17 April-IM
 Lebanon will have a chance to assert greater inde-
 pendence from Syria as long as Assad is preoccupied with
 domestic problems.   If the Syrians have to withdraw most
 of their troops from Lebanon, however. Lebanon will face
 the prospect of renewed civil war.
 If Assad were overthrown, we would have little or
 no warning.  Fellow Alawite military officers who want
 to preserve their dominance pose the greatest threat to
 Assad.   A joint Alawite-Sunni officer coup is possible,
 but it is less likely because of sectarian animosities.
 There is no obvious replacement for Assad.   At the
 outset, virtually any successor would be more unpredict-
 able and probably more radical than Assad.
 Syria could easily revert to the pattern of chronic
 instability that existed before Assad's assumption of
 power.  This situation could lead to increased tension
 with Syria's neighbors, especially Israel.   A weak suc-
 cessor would be unable to propose or respond effectively
 to major foreign policy initiatives and might seek a
 limited military confrontation with Israel to unite the
 country.
