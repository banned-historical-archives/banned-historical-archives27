A 
DeMenezes brothers, executives of Movement for Independence of the Azores 
Portugal: Facing Tough Problems 
An incipient rebellion in the Azores added 
to Portugal's troubles this past wcol, when 
separatists turned a farmers' protest demonstra-
tion into a rally for independence from the 
mainland. The demonstrators forced the resigna-
tion of the civil governor of Sao Miguel Island, 
thus dramatically focusing Lisbon's attention on 
the growing independence sentiment in the 
Azui es. 
Lisbon's response was twofold: It promised 
a sympathetic hearing to the Azoruans' legit-
imate economic grievances, while at the same 
time clamping tight restrictions on separatist 
activities. On June 10, Portuguese authorities 
arrested 29 suspected leaders of the movement 
in Sao Miguel. The leftist-controlled media in 
Portugal are criticizing military and police of-
ficials in the Azores for their handling of the 
demonsuation, and a purge of Portuguese 
represontatives in the Azores known to be in 
sympathy with the separatists seems likely to 
follow. 
Unlike Portugal's African colonies, the 
Azores are regarded as an integral part of the 
mainland. Lisbon will probably yield to many of 
the economic demands of the Azoreans, but has 
made known its strong opposition to the 
nascent independence movement. 
Although the separatists have demon-
strated that they have the necessary following to 
create public disturbances, they have also shown 
themselves to be badly organized and extremely 
vu I nerabie. Further demonstrations by the 
separatists have been proscribed by the Portu-
guese authorities, and the movement is expected 
to go underground for a while. 
Meanwhile, Lisbon is faced with serious 
problems in Angola where the military situation 
continues to worsen. Hostilities between the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola 
and the National Front are pushing the territory 
to the brink of civil war. Additional Portuguese 
troops were airlifted to Angola last weekend, 
but leading Portuguese military authorities are 
in general agreement that there is little they can 
do to control the fighting there. Continuing 
strife in Angola will lead to a further exodus of 
refugees to Portugal and a further rise in un-
employment there. Even more important, the 
Angolan developments will cast a pall over the 
Armed Forces Movement's most significant 
achievement to date?decolonization. 
On the home front, the festering dispute 
between the Movement and the Socialist Party 
over press freedom abated somewhat after the 
Socialists agreed to remain in the coalition gov-
ernment in exchange for the reopening of the 
party newspaper, Republica. The critical issue in 
the Republica dispute?whether the Communist 
printers or the Socialists' editorial board would 
exercise control of the paper?was resolved by

the government in favor of the Socialists. The 
printers are still demanding a voice in editorial 
policy, however, and the agreement could come 
unglued at any time. 
A potentially explosive conflict with Por-
tugal's Catholic Church is also gathering momen-
tum. Lisbon's Cardinal Ribeiro told US embassy 
officials that Communist seizure of the radio 
station operated by the Church and government 
interference in parochial schools are rapidly 
leading to a church-state confrontation. Denun-
ciation of Movement policies from the country's 
pulpits could deal a crippling blow to the ruling 
military's already waning popularity. 
Portugal's leaders are not faring any better 
in their efforts to solve the nation's economic 
headaches. When EC Council President Garrett 
FitzGerald visited Lisbon last week, government 
officials pleaded for EC assistance to shore up 
the sagging economy. FitzGerald noted that EC 
loans could be made only fov specific projects 
and not solely to reduce balance-of-payments 
pressures. As has happened repeatedly in the 
past, the Portuguese were unable to come up 
with specific proposals. FitzGerald emphasized 
the need for Portugal's political development 
along democratic lines and a reduction of com-
munist influence. 
FitzGerald himself is prepared to argue 
within the EC for early aid. EC foreign minis-
ters may agree in principle to be forthcoming 
with assistancr, to Portugal when they meet later 
this month, but implementation of more gener-
ous terms for renewing the trade agreement will 
be tied to the further course of events in Por-
tugal. 
Angola: On the Brink 
The rival armies of the two main nation-
alist groups in Angola's transitional government 
again engaged in heavy fighting in Luanda dur-
ing the past week. Coming on top of recent 
clashes between the same groups throughout a 
wide area north and east of the capital and in 
the exclave of Cabinda, the latest round of fight-
ing appears to have edged the troubled territory 
closer to all-out civil war. 
Most of the fighting over the past three 
weeks was touched off by the Soviet-backed 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, 
which has become militarily stronger than it was 
last winter when the National Front for the 
Liberation of Angola appeared to have a decided 
edge in troops and guns. At present, neither the 
Popular Movement nor the National Front has 
the supplies or mobility to force a military 
showdown. Both groups appear to be preparing 
for such an eventuality, however. 
Outside Luanda, each group has now 
largely secured the areas in which its ethnic 
support is strongest, clearing them of the troops 
of the rival organization. This development has 
undermined a key provision of the independ-
ence accord thot all three nationalist groups 
signed with the Portuguese last January. It had 
assured each group the right to engage freely in 
political activity throughout the territory. 
In the capital, where three rounds of fight-
ing have occurred since March, neither group is 
clearly dominant at this time. The initiative 
seems to rest with the Popular Movement, which

also appears to be in a good position to disrupt 
the National Front's supply routes to the city 
from northern Angola. Portuguese forces in-
tervened in the latest Luancid fighting more 
forcefully than in the past, losing at least three 
dead. After the fighting ended, the Portuguese 
raided arms depots in the city, a move that 
could throw the Popular Movement and the 
National Front off balance for the time being. 
In Cabinda, representatives of the three 
nationalist groups reportedly signed a cease-fire 
that calls for each group to maintain only, a 
token military force in the largest city. During 
the fighting, the Popular Movement, which has 
been active in Cabinda much longer than its 
rivals, apparently succeeded in driving forces of 
the National Front from the city and the adjoin-
ing countryside. 
Further serious fighting seems unlikely, 
pending the outcome of a meeting of the leaders 
of the three groups that is scheduled to begin in 
Nakuru, Kenya, on Sunday. The meeting was 
promoted by Jonas Savimbi, head of the Na-
tional Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola, smallest of the three nationalist groups. 
Savimbi has emerged as a conciliator in recent 
months. His group has tried to stay neutral, but 
was drawn into the recent fighting in Luanda. 
At the Nakuru meeting, Savimbi, Popular 
Movement leader Agostinho Neto and National 
Front president Holden Roberto, as a means of 
easing competition among them, may discuss 
postponing constituent assembly elections until 
after Angola receives independence in Novem-
ber. They may also try to reach agreement on a 
candidate to head a post-independence govern-
ment. It seems clear that any bargains struck at 
the meeting will only serve to postpone a final 
reckoning between Roberto and Neto, who 
display less inclination than ever to co-
operate.

Consortium Defends Decision 
After more than a year of intensive nego-
tiations, the four-nation consortium composed 
of Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and 
Norway has agreed to buy the US-made F-16 
fighter as a replacement for the obsolete F-104 
aircraft. Some of the governm, nts, however, 
face sharp domestic criticism as a result of their 
decision, which is regarded as a blow to hopes of 
developing a European aircraft industry. The 
opposition parties as well as the left wings of the 
governing parties in these countries may revive 
the issue if defense spending and unemployment 
become contentious questions in the future. 
France spearheaded the campaign to "buy 
European," and vigorously promoted its Mirage 
F-1E. Francophones in the bilingual Belgian gov-
ernment favored the Mirage, and Prime Minister 
Tindemans may be in political difficulty as a 
result of the decision. There were veiled hints 
that Paris might consider cooperating in Euro-
pean defense matters if the consortium chose 
the Mirage. Sweden, with its entry, the Viggen, 
tried to exert pressure on Denmark by stressing 
"Scandinavian solidarity" and, like France, of-
fered a substantial eleventh-hour price reduc-
tion. All three planes fulfill NATO require-
ments, but the greater production run for the 
F-16?which was also selected by the US Air 
Force?made the American entry the best eco-
nomic choice. Additionally, some countries may 
got sub-contracts for F-16 components that will 
exceed their expenditures for the planes. 
Last month, Denmark, the Netherlands, 
ani Norway agreed to purchase the F-16 pro-
vided Belgium followed suit. The decision was 
most difficult for Brussels because of its strong 
cultural ties to France and the extensive French 
business interests in Belgium. Two of the three 
parties in Prime Minister Tindemans' coalition 
government have French-speaking wings, and 
the other is entirely French-speaking. Neverthe-
less, the government won a narrow vote of con-
fidence in parliament yesterday following a chal-
lenge by a French-speaking opposition party 
that favored the Mirage.

The minority Social Democratic govern-
ment in Denmark nIso has been criticized for its 
choice of the F-16, but easily won pro forma 
parlia,lentary approval on Wednesday despite a 
Communist-inspired demonstration in Copen-
hagen earlier this week. Nevertheless, Stock-
holm's last-minute offer to Copenhagen of a 
25-percent reduct:on in the price of the Viggen 
may yet cause Prime Minister Jorgensen prob-
lems in Denmark, where there are few sup-
porters of large outlays for defense. 
The Dutch government also encountered 
opposition, especially from leftists in parliament 
who oppose the purchase of any plane to re-
place the F-104. Prime Minister den Uyl, how-
ever, has the backing of the coalition parties for 
his decisiun, which was predicated on a unani-
mous choice by the consortium, and does not 
require parliamentary approval. Nnvertheless, 
one of the small parties in the five-party coali-
tion has called for an investigation to determine 
whether the aircraft companies may have tried 
to influence The hague's selection. Although 
the debate over the government's decision wiII 
probably subside gradually, developments at the 
recent Dutch Labor Party congress are indicative 
of growing and-Americanism in Dutch political 
life that Dutch leaders will have to deal with 
before the elections in 1977. 
Only the Norwegian government can ex-
pect little challenge over its choice. A strong 
supporter of NATO and the Atlantic com-
munity, Norway attaches great importance to 
Western defense cooperation. In addition, Oslo's 
oil wealth will enable it to maintain a relatively 
effective defense contribution to NATO, while 
at the same time underwriting the extensive and 
expensive domestic social welfare programs that 
Norwegian voters demand.1 
SOVIET SUB RETURNS TO PATROL AREA 
The Y-class submarine cruising only 
300 miles off the US east coast for about 
ten days has returned to its normal oper-
ating area in the mid-Atlantic. Although the 
purpose of this unprecedented patrol is still 
not clear, it may have been an attempt to 
provoke a reaction by US antisubmarine 
forces. The Soviets may also want to demon-
strate they can occasionally move the At-
lantic patrol closer to the US. There are 
presently six ballistic missile submarines on 
opera-L:0ml patrol against US targets. Four 
are Y-claFs submarines?two each in the 
Atlantic and the Pacific?and the remainder 
are D-class submarines in the Greenland 
Sea.

CYPRUS: INCONCLUSIVE TALKS 
Another inconclwive round of intercom-
munal talks was held ir Vienna last week under 
the auspices of !JN Secretary General Waldheim. 
Greek Cypriot negotiator Clerides and Turkish 
Cypriot negot,ator Denktash could not come to 
grips with major issues because the constitu-
tional committee commissioned at the first 
Vienna round last month failed to make any 
headway on the powers of the central govern-
ment in the proposed federation. The nego-
tiators, apparently under pressure from Athens 
and Ankara, went through the motions in order 
to maintain the cordial atmosphere created at 
the meeting of the Greek and Turkish prime 
ministers in Brussels last month. 
The negotiators did have some heated ex-
changes. Denktash refused to set forth concrete 
positions on the territorial and refugee questions 
as promised in the earlier round, citing as justifi-
cation the lack of progress in delimiting the 
structure of the proposed federation. He pre-
sented some tentative views on the powers and 
functions of the central government and also 
proposed that a joint transi:ional central govern-
ment be established, pending a final settlement. 
Clerides did not respond to the proposals 
on the central government because Denktash 
had refused to discuss the territorial and refugee 
issues. Clerides did give conditional acceptance 
to the proposal for an interim government, and 
both men agreed to examine the idea in detail 
after the talks. It is doubtful they can agree to 
an interim authority with jusrisdiction over 
significant political matters. 
The talks adjourned on June 7?two days 
ahead of time?because of the constitutional 
referendum for the Turkish Cypriot zone on 
June 8. Denktash reiterated that the constitu-
tion?which was approved by an overwhelming 
margin?is subject to revision when an overall 
settlement is reached. The negotiators agreed to 
meet in Vienna between July 24-27, but this 
will depend on further developments in their 
informal consultations in Cyprus, the progress

ITALY: ELECTION CAMPAIGN WINDUP 
The campaign for regional and local elec-
tions on kne 15-16 ends today, with the 
dominant Christian Democrats still hoping to 
keep their losses to the left within the 2-3 per-
cent range by attracting increased support from 
moderate and conservative voters. 
The harsh debate between the Christian 
Democrats and the Socialists continued to 
dominate the campaign in its iinal week. Atten-
tion was distracted from regional and local 
issues throughout the campaign by discussion of 
what the vote would mean for national politics. 
The entire Socialist campaign has been an 
elaboration on two of their most widely broad-
cast electoral slogans: one advising voters that 
"Italy is changing, but the Christian Democrats 
are not," and the other asserting that a vote for 
the Socialists is the only vote for the left that 
will "really bnther the Christian Democrats." 
They charge that the Christian Democrats, after 
nearly 30 years as Italy's dominant party, are 
too corrupt and conservative to respond to the 
problems that have accompanied rapid social 
and economic change in Italy. Concerned that 
voters inclined to switch to the left might turn 
to the Communists, the Socialists have insisted 
that theirs is the only party?by virtue of its 
access to the government?that can actually use 
leftist votes as leverage against the Christian 
Democrats. 
The Christian Democrats, while claiming 
credit for Italy's postwar transformation to an 
industrialized society, have hit hard at the 
Socialists' failure to advance specific proposals. 
Christian Democrat leader Fani.dni, meanwhile, 
has continued to dramatize the need for tough 
law enforcement and to attack the Socialists for 
their equivocal attitude toward anti-crime meas-
ures recently passed by parliament. 
Fanfani also stepped up his attack this 
week on the distinction the Socialists make 
between themselves and the Communists. He 
produced elaborate statistics, for example, to 
support his argument that the Socialists are 
Page 
running on joint slates with the Communists in 
more localities this year than ever before. The 
Socialists, caught off guard, merely reiterated 
their demand for a "free hand" at the local 
level. 
Among the reasons the Socialists insist on 
this point is the fact that they may have an 
opportunity after the elections to join the Com-
munists in administering two more regions; they 
already share power with the Communists in the 
latter's north-central strongholds of Emilia-
Romagna, Tuscany, and Umbria. The two 
parties now stand a chance of gaining slim 
majorities in the neighboring regions of Marche 
and Liguria. 
Foreign policy issues continued to hinder 
the Communists in their efforts to campaign on 
the claim of running efficient administrations at 
the regional and local levels. Communist chief 
Berlinguer has complained, for example, about 
the preoccupation of the press with such issues 
as Portugal and relations with Moscow. The 
Communists, nevertheless, have mounted a 
vigorous and well-organized campaign and are 
likely to continue their postwar trend of steady 
gains at the polls. 
As the campaign drew to a close, party 
leaders began to think out loud about the future 
of Prime Minister Moro's Christian Democratic - 
Republican coalition, sVll widely regarded as a 
stop-gap measure to jet the country through 
the elections. Most -:omments were cautious, 
however, and no party leader is yet demanding 
Moro's resignation right after the elections. The 
Socialists would probably trigger a crisis if they 
scored dramatic gains?upwards of 3 percent for 
example?but even they seem more inclined to 
leave Moro in place through the summer. That 
would give both the Socialists and the Christian 
Democrats time to firm up bargaining positions 
on the terms for a new government and to have 
them approved by their respective party con-
gresses, tentatively set for the fall.

FINLAND: GOVERNMEN1 RESIGNS 
President Kekkonen has scheduled parlia-
mentary elections for September 21-22 follow-
ing the resignation of Prime Minister Sorsa's 
center-left coalition government last week. Kek-
konen will probably wait until next week to 
dissolve parliament; work should have been com-
pleted by then on several important bills. 
The President is expected to appoint either 
a non-political government of civil servants or a 
"presidential" caretaker government that would 
remain in office until a new cabinet is formed. A 
"presidential" government would consist of na-
tionally known political figutes serving at the 
request of the president and with the permission 
of their respective parties. Kekkonen may opt 
for the latter solution because the conclusion of 
the European security conference will probably 
take place in Helsinki this summer or fall, and 
the President wishes to have a group of dis-
tinguished national figures representing Finland 
as the host government. 
The deeply divided four-party coalition 
broke up after failure of repeated attempts to 
resolve persistent disagreements. The dispute be-
tween the two niajor coalition partners?the So-
cial Democrats and Kekkonen's Center Party?
started in April when the Center Party an-
nounced it would not support the government's 
regional development package. Despite Kek-
konen's intervention and intermittent efforts at 
cooperation, neither major coalition partner was 
willing to compromise. 
Opinion polls indicate that both the Social 
Democrats and the Center Party would 
strengthen their parliamentary representation in 
a new election. A Gallup poll published last 
month indicated that in an election the Social 
Democrats would garner 27 percent of the votes 
and the Center Party could count on 18.7 per-
cent. The same poll indicated that the four 
parties represented in the present coalition?the 
Social Democrats, Center Party, Liberals, and 
the Swedish Peoples Party?are supported by 
54.6 percent of the electorate, compared with  
their 1972 election total of 52.7.1 
FRANCE: NUCLEAR TESTING RESUMES 
The French conducted their first nuclear 
test of 1975 on June 5 at the Fagataufa Atoll in 
the South Pacific. The underground explosion 
was France's first since underground testing was 
terminated in 1965 in Algeria's Sahara desert. 
The French conducted a series of underground 
tests there through the mid-1960s. 
 /Defense Minister Bourges 
said in a communique that the test was a com-
plete success both from the technical and safety 
points of view. 
Paris' decision to resume underground nu-
clear testing follows several years of protest 
against French atmospheric tests in the Pacific 
by Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and several 
 25X1 
west coast Latin American countries. Bourges' 
mention of the safety factor probably was in-
tended to head off another round of protests. 
International reaction to the detonation has 
been muted. Australian Prime Minister Whitlam 
noted that France was refraining from con-
ducting atmospheric tests in the Pacific; how-
ever, both he and New Zealand Prime Minister 
Rowling reaffirmed their countries' opposition 
to any type of nuclear explosions?whether 
atmospheric or underground.

USSR: SEEKING AVIATION TECHNOLOGY 
The Soviets want a modern civil air fleet 
with safety, quality, and maintenance up to 
Western standards, and an aircraft of Soviet 
design that would be competitive in the inter-
national air transport market. 
Recent agreements between the USSR and 
the UK are the latest in a series of attempts to 
acquire the much-needed technology. 
? A science and technology agreement 
signed in March set the stage for more spe-
cific ones between Soviet enterprises and 
UK industries. 
? A protocol signed with Rolls Royce in 
April took the USSR a long step toward 
acquiring the technology to modernize its 
civil air fleet, and in particular toward pro-
ducing a wide-bodied transport. 
The science and technology agreement is 
similar to those signed earlier with the US. Six 
of the 19 specific fields covered by the agree-
ment with the UK pertain directiy to the air-
craft industry. Of the six, one calls for contacts 
and cooperation between British industries and 
Soviet enterprises on gas turbine engines, auto-
matic engine controls, and engine component 
fabrication. 
The Soviets may thus be able to secure 
technical details of a high-performance engine 
comparable to those manufactured by General 
Electric and Pratt and Whitney. The acquisition 
of such technology is, in fact, the chief Soviet 
purpose in negotiating the protocol with Rolls 
Royce. Since March, Soviet delegations have 
met at least twice with teams from Rolls Royce 
to discuss the purchase of an improved engine. 
The protocoi with Rolls Royce opens the 
door for contracts to purchase Rolls Royce 
engines already in production, as well as for the 
cooperative manufacture of these high-thritst, 
turbofan engines. Acquisition of such an engine 
would make possible the production of signifi-
cantly improved versions of wide-bodied air-
craft, such as the IL-86. The joint development 
of improved versions is also envisaged. Such 
engines are essential to efficient, long-range 
operation of large transport aircraft. 
Co-production of engines will result in the 
actual transfer of manufacturing technology, as 
well as operational and maintenance methods 
and processes. With this highly reliable and ef-
ficient turbofan engine technology the USSR 
would overcome the principal barrier to its 
development of transport aircraft that would be 
competitive internationally. 
Soviet Deficiencies 
At present, the Soviets have two serious 
deficiencies in commercial aviation tech-
nology?jet engines and internationally ac-
ceptable avionics equipment. Technical main-
tenance services will also ;lave to be brought up 
to world standards. The TU-154s sold to Egypt 
were a case in point; most became inoperative 
because spare parts and maintenance were un-
available. Cairo eventually returned them. 
The Soviets are from two to eight ears 
behind the US in design and production tech-
nology for transport aircraft engines. They 
started to develop turbofan engines Iter than 
the West did, and then generally concentrated 
on less sophisticated, less efficient models. 
Furthermore, the So...9ts have been unwilling to 
introduce the required complex production 
technology and have been unable to match some 
of the more advanced Western technology used 
in producing engines with greater thrust for less 
fuel. 
By Western standards, the Soviets also have 
serious deficiencies in avionic subsystems, es-
pecially in inertial navigation and flight-control. 
They have had difficulty in achieving high ac-
curacy and reliability in components. Their 
computers are bulky and slow, although they 
have acquired some suitable US computer equip-
ment through third countries.

Model of IL-86 
During the past decade, the USSR has 
maintained a high priority effort to acquire  
Western aircraft technology through 
  France, 
West Germany, tho UK, and the US. Soviet 
officials have used the atmosphere of detente to 
intensify overt collection efforts. 
Intensive technical discussions have been 
held with officials of each of the three US 
manufacturers of wide-bodied aircraft: Lock-
heed, McDonnell-Douglas, and Boeing. In addi-
tion to Rolls Royce, Soviet delegationss have 
visited various engine manufacturers, such as 
General Electric and Pratt and Whitney. The 
Soviets have studied Western business and 
management methods, including marketing 
analysis. 
Some 30 US companies, including Boeing 
and Lockheed, have signed Article 4 of the 
US-USSR science and technology agreement. 
This article, intended to promote contacts be-
tween Soviet officials and private US firms, has 
greatly increased opportunities for Soviet engi-
neering and management personnel to hold di-
rect technical discussions and to observe aero-
space manufacturing equipment in operation. 
No specific aircraft project is in the final 
stages of negotiation, but whatever evolves will 
be subject to US government approval. Never-
theless, a considerable amount of US technology 
has already been revealed through preliminary 
negotiations, proposals, and exchange visits. 
How well the Soviets have been able to use this 
technology is not yet clear. 
One of the Soviet tactics in negotiations 
with the US was to offer to buy wide-bodied 
aircraft as an inducement for the construction 
of a complete aircraft manutacturing complex in 
the Soviet Union by US firms under contract. 
The US has refused permission for the sale of 
such a complex, and this has been a major factor 
in Moscow's decision to move ahead with the 
production of its own advanced transport air-
craft, as  well as to look elsewhere for advanced 
engines. 25X1

IRAN: AIR POWER AND AIR DEFENSE 
The Shah is taking steps to make more 
effective use of the advanced aircraft and 
sophisticated air defense missile, he is acquiring 
Troth the US. His air force, already the dominant 
local air power in the Persian Gull, by the 1980s 
will be able to extend its influence to the 
Arabian Sea. The Shah's plans also call for most 
of Iran's military installations and key industrial 
facilities to be protected by Hawk missile sites 
within the next five years. 
Northrop F-SE Tiger and F-SF trainer 
The air force is rapidly phasing out its 
older model US-built F-5 Freedom Fighters. 
Some 20 of the F-5s were sent to Jordan earlier 
this year and another 12 may 'ae sent this fall. 
An additional 20 are to be returned to the US. 
These aircraft are being replaced with improved 
F-5E "Tiger II" interceptors. The Shah has 
ordered 141 of these new F-5s, plus 28 trainer 
models?some 75 have been delivered. 
The Shah is intent on obtaining the newest 
and best aircraft. In addition to the F-5 Tiger 
Ils, he has some 135 F-4 Phartoms, with an 
additional 70 to be d .1.vered. Irai, also has con-
iracted for at least 80 US F-14s equipped with 
advanced Phoenix air-to-air missiles. The first of 
the F-14s are scheduled for delivery before the 
end of the year. The Shah has expressed an 
interest in acquiring the F-16 lightweight jet 
fighter as well. 
To project his air power into the Arabian 
Sea, the Shah is planning to base F-4s at two 
forward airfields. Bandar Abbas will be the 
home base for two squadrons of F-4s, and an-
other airfield is being built on the coast at Chah 
Bahar, where two fighter squadrons will be sta-
tioned in the late 1970s. From these bases, 
Iranian aircraft could dominate the nearby ship-
ping lanes and reach as far as Bombay, India.

The Shah has re-evaluated the priorities for 
locating the Hawk surface-to-air missiles. Hawks 
will continue to be placed first at key military 
installations, but more emphasis is to be di-
rected at protecting important industrial and 
petroleum sites. The capital area, for example, 
still is to receivo tha largest number of missiles, 
but it will ricq get them until the Isfahan steel 
works and cne Kharg Island petroleum facility 
near Bushehr are protected. 
The overall idr defense plan for the country 
is steadily falling behind schedule, however. 
Some 25 Hawk launchers have been delivered 
under the purchase agreement with the US, but 
none is yet operational. The first site at the 
Vahdati air base will probably not be ready until 
late  this summer?several months behind sched-
ule. 
ETHIOPIA: ANOTHER INSURGENCY 
Ethiopia's military rulers, already beset by 
rebellion in Eritrea and rural unrest in other 
provinces, found themselves embroiled in still 
another conflict on June 1 when heavy fighting 
broke out between Afar tribesmen and govern-
ment security forces in eastern Ethiopia. The 
clashes subsided this week, but the Afars will 
probably continue guerrilla operations in an 
attempt ta fend off control by the military 
council in Addis Ababa. 
Sultan Ali Mirah, the Afar leader, opposes 
the council's socialist policies, especially its land 
reform program. He was one of the few major 
tribal figures to remain free during the council's 
roundup of traditional leaders last year, but he 
felt the council would eventually move against 
him as part of its campaign to destroy Ethiopia's 
old ruling class. He refused repeated council 
requests to come to Addis Ababa, and a council 
delegation that traveled to Afar territory in late 
May was unable to reach an accommodation 
with him. 25X1 
Soon after the fighting began, Ali Mirah 
fled to the nearby French Territory of Afars and  
Issas/ 
  /He will prob-
ably seek additional aid from Arab countries 
and also try to promote cooperation between 
his forces and the Eritrean rebels. 
The Afars are a threat to both the main 
highway linking Addis Ababa with the Red Sea 
port of Assab?site of Ethiopia's only oil refin-
ery?and the railway to the port of Djibouti in 
the French Territory. During the fighting last 
week, the Afars blew up a bridge on the high-
way, setting off panic buying of gasoline in the 
capital. 
Government forces will probably be able to 
control tho main towns in the area, but will not 
be able to completely subdue the Afars. The 
army is already stretched thin. The Afars num-
ber about 200,000, and almost all the :nen are 
armed. Although most of their weapons are old, 
some are recently acquired Soviet automatic ri-
fles and modern Western arms

LIBYA-EGYPT: UNDERMINING SADAT 
President Qadhafi is putting pressure on 
Arab and Islamic leaders to denounce Egyptian 
President Sadat's recent statements concerning 
recognition of Israel and the possibility that 
Israeli cargoes will be permitted to move 
through the Suez Canal. Qadhafi's latest anti-
Sadat offensive may complicate Egypt's efforts 
to put together a joint Arab negotiating policy. 
Qadhafi 
According to the Libyan press, Qadhafi has 
received messages from Syria, Tunisia, Algeria, 
North Yemen, and Bahrain disapproving of 
Sadat's remarks. President Asad is quoted as 
stating, "Syria has not and will not consider 
recognition of the Zionist enemy, which is not 
the right of any chief of state." 
Qadhafi hopes that a general Arab con-
demnation of Egypt's recent moves will isolate 
Sadat and undercut Egypt's credibility as 
spokesman ;:or the Arabs during the next round 
of negotiations with Israel. Libya probably also 
wants to harden Arab negotiating positions 
before the Arab summit later this summer. 
Qadhafi has met with several fedayeen 
leaders in Tripoli to consider other ways to 
block Sadat. He has talked with George Habbash 
and Ahmad Jabril?two of the most radical ter-
rorist leaders?and with Nayif Hawatmah and 
Faruq Qaddumi, members of the more moderate 
Palestine Liberation Organization. All four 
Palestinians denounced Sadat's gestures toward 
Israel, declaring that the Palestinians would not 
accept Israeli use of the Suez Canal. 
The Libyan media have stepped up their 
denunciation of Sadat; some attacks contain 
scarcely veiled calls for the Egyptian leader's 
assassination. Last weekend, the Libyans staged 
the largest anti-Sadat demonstrations since the 
1973 "people's march" on Cairo. Nearly 
10,000?including many Egyptian workers?
participated in a rally in Tripoli. 
These actions are bound to draw a sharp 
reaction from Cairo. They may once again bring 
Libyan-Egyptian relations, which have been  sour  
for many months, to the breaking point.

ARGENTINA 
LABOR PROBLEMS 
Even after a change of economy ministers 
the government is still encountering consider-
able difficulty in its efforts to deal with the 
country's severe economic problems without 
alienating organized labor. 
Not mollified by a 65-percent increase in 
the minimum wage, Argentine workers have re-
acted strongly against price hikes announced by 
Economy Minister Celestino Rodrigo who only 
last week was named to replace an outspoken 
foe of continuing concessions to them. Sharp 
increases in utility rates and the prices of 
gasoline, basic foods, transport, and services 
have provoked strikes by taxi drivers and mari-
time and port workers. Nine persons were 
wounded when police broke up an angry crowd 
of steelworkers protesting rising prices. 
Less than a week after taking office, 
Rodrigo also announced the devaluation of he 
peso to one third its Februacy value and 
endorsed previously approved measures to cur-
tail imports. Argentina has been experiencing 
mounting inflation?it now exceeds a 
100-percent annual rate?and a deteriorating 
balance of payments. In addition, the adminis-
tration has reiterated the urgent need to increase 
productivity, probably in reference to the seri-
ous problem of worker absenteeism. 
The government undoubtedly is in for even 
greater problems with labor. More than a week 
after the announced deadline for completion of 
wage negotiations with industrial unions, the 
Peronist labor confederation announced suspen-
sion of the talks until such time as the full 
effects of the devaluation and price increases are 
known. 
The halt may really be due to dissension in 
labor's ranks and to diminishing support for the 
workers' own negotiators. Indeed, the heads of 
two top labor groupings are rumored ready to 
resign their posts. In the meantime, both sides 
are clearly seeking to play down their differ-
ences, in public at least. Labor leaders, perhaps 
in an effort to buy time, have assuP d workers 
that the eventual agreement will be retroactive 
to June 1, when the old accord expired. In the 
final analysis, however, union leaders may be 
ubliged to press the government hard if they are 
to retain the support of the rank and file.1

GUATEMALA: GROUNDS FOR LINORCE 
Guatemalan President Laugerud appears to 
be embarked on a plan to cast off the extreme 
right-wing member of the two-party governing 
coalition and eventually form a new political 
alliance to govern the countrs . The alliance he 
apparently has in mind would not significantly 
change the conservative cast of the government. 
Current maneuvering by Laugerud centers 
on the election of a president of Congress on 
June 15. This post, a much-sought-after political 
plum, had been held for several years by the 
senior partner in the coalition, the rightist 
National Liberation Movement, led by Vice 
President Sandoval. The Movement lost it last 
year to a small party outside, but closely aligned 
'th, the coalition and wants it back. Laugerud, 
o has been trying for some time to ease the 
p:rty and the power-hungry vice president out 
of the political limelight, is suppo,ting a candi-
date of the Democratic Institutional Party, the 
other member of the coalition. This party, less 
strident in its conservatism, is regarded by 
Laugerud as better suited to his style and pol it-
ical philosophy. 
The two opposition parties, the centrist 
Revolutionary Party and the leftist Christian 
Democratic Party, have thrown their support to 
the Laugerud candidate, making him the 
favorite to win. These parties are only too will-
ing to support Laugerud on this issue, having 
resented the iron-handed and arrogant way the 
Sandoval party has run Congress in the past. 
Moreover, they have been going along with the 
President on other issues in hopes of beinci in-
cluded in any new coalition excluding tl-:e Na-
tional Liberation Movement.i

Movement members are becoming worried. One 
has charged that Sandoval's inability to swing 
the election to their candidate is leading the 
party to ruin. Others claim that a weakening of 
the coalition would weaken the government 
itself. 
5andoval is remaining publicly silent for 
now. Although it is his nature to threaten and 
intimidate in order to show opponents the 
power of his party, he is also shrewd enough to 
know that he would not succeed in any con-
frontation with Laugerud. Laugerud has the 
backing of the army, which, in the end, is the 
chief political arbiter in the country. After a 
final try at persuading Laugerud to pick another 
candidate, Sandoval is likely to go ak .1g with 
the President's choice. 
For the National Liberation Movement and 
Sandoval, losing the congressional 'eldership 
will not necessarily lead to an immediate plit in 
the partnership, but it does indicate, along svith 
previous disputes, that bitterness has grown to  
point where a rupture seems inevitable.1 
COLOMBIA: DECLINING PUBLIC ORDER 
Pressure on President Alfonso Lopez 
Michelsen to declare a state of siege continues to 
mount. Public order is deteriorating, with 
student protests in several cities now added to 
existing country-wide demonstrations against 
economic hardships. Army units have helped the 
national police maintain order, but the army 
high command has made clear its distaste for 
such use of troops except when legalized by a 
state of siege. Last week, following the letter of 
constitutional law, the council of state auth-
orized the President to declare a state of siege. 
Although Lopez remains extremely reluctant to 
abridge civil liberties with such a declaration, it 
Page 
seems only a matter of time until he is obliged 
to do so. 
Student unrest has been focused on the 
rectorship of the National University and a con-
troversy over medical students' management of 
their own clinical training. In an attempt to 
forestall existing and antkipated student prob-
lems, President Lopez appointed a Marxist to 
the rectorship following his inauguration ten 
months ago. In the midst of this month's out-
break of student demonstrations, Lopez fired 
the Marxist rector for failing to provide a useful 
channel of communication between the student 
body and the government. This has only further 
aggravated the students, who have intensified 
their support of residents and interns seeking to 
control one of Bogota's largest hospitals and 
have carried the violence-charged issue to other 
universities and other major cities. 
The key argument in favor of a state of 
siege may well be the politically explosive issue 
of urban transportation fares. Colombia began 
to import oil last year, erasing a tradition of 
abundant domestic oil with subsidized low 
prices at the gasoline pump. Lopez' efforts to 
maintain the price level have led to an increasing 
drain of treasury funds into fuel subsidies. In 
late May, Lopez moved to suspend or minimize 
gasoline imports and ration local consumption. 
This will postpone but not eliminate an eventual 
price rise and a resultant increase in transporta-
tion fares. In the past, even minor fare hikes 
have provoked violent protests by lower income 
riders. Lopez would probably be forced to use 
the army to control such demonstrations, and 
he would almost surely declare a state of siege 
first. 
Lopez may be tempted to act now in 
response to the student unrest and then permit 
gasoline prices and transport fares to rise with 
the army already in control of public order. 
With a mid-term election coming next April, the 
President may prefer to confront sooner rather 
than later what could be the most serious polit-
ical challenge of his tenure.

DOMINICAN REPUPI IC: CRACKr,)WN 
The government has undertaken a sweeping 
crackdown on opponents in the wake of its 
claim that three Dominican terrorists secretly 
entered the country from Cuba on June 1. 
During the past week, security forces have 
carried out searches, set up roadblocks, and ar-
rested several hundred people in what they 
claim is an effort to apprehend three Dominican 
extremists who have been living in Cuba. The 
authorities maintain that the trio was brought to 
the Dominican Republic by thren Puerto Ricans 
who were arrested on suspicion of narcotics 
smuggling on June 2. Military and police forces 
were dispatched to the area where the landing is 
alleged to have taken place, but apparently did 
not find their quarry. 
General Nivar, the chief of the National 
Police, has linked the widespread arrests to the 
guerrilla landing and to "subversive plots." 
Opposition party leaders, students, labor union 
officials, and journalists seem to have been the 
main target of the roundup. Many of the de-
tainees have been released after interrogation, 
but others remain in custody. Fifteen, including 
three important Communist labor leaders, have 
been formally charged with conspiring to over-
throw the government. 
Considerable skepticism has been reflected 
in the press and in public and private statements 
by many opposition politicians and some mili-
tary officers concerning the alleged arrival of the 
three terrorists. There is a suspicion that the 
incident was fabricated by General Nivar to 
bolster his reputation with President Balaguer 
and to steal a march on Nivar's arch-rival Gen-
eral Perez y Perez, the secretary of the interior 
and police. 
Now that the authorities have publicly 
claimed that the three terrorists have returned, 
they will be under increasing pressure to appre-
hend them, otherwise protests against the deten-
tions are almost certain to increase. It will be 
very difficult for the government to continue to 
maintain that the arrested people actually pre-
sent any security threat. General Nivar has been 
making nearly all the public pronouncements on 
the episode, and will probably have to Leal the 
main responsibility if the government cannot  
produce results.) 
25X1 
PERU: NEW ECONOMIC MEASURES 
President Velasco made one of his infre-
quent public appearances this past week pre. 
siding over the traditional pledgo-to-the-flag 
ceremonies in Lima on June 7. The economic 
and political spotlight, however, is increasingly 
on his probable successor, Prime Minister Mo-
rales Bermudez. 
Last week, Morales Bermudez "Innounced 
plans for new economic measures to cohi'uat 
spiraling inflation and a growing budgetary defi-
cit. The plane call for reduction?and in some 
cases abandonment?of massive government sub-
sidies on essential agricultural and petroleum 
products. The measures amount to a significant 
departure from President Velasco's almost sacro-
sanct policy of keeping the potentially volatile 
urban dwellers quiescent through massive sub-
sidies. To offset the anticipated reaction, Mo-
rales Bermudez is urging the government to 
adopt a general price freeze and an increase in 
minimum dal!!! wage and salary levels. 
For some time, international lending age(.. 
cies and technical-level officials within the Peru-
vian government have been recommending 
tough new measures to ward off what they see 
as a serious economic problem. The present 
system of direct and indirect subsidies ac-
counted for approximately half of the 
1973-1974 biennial budget deficii. Further ag-
gravating the economic situation is the apparent 
inability to deal with excessive wage demands. 
Inflation, earlier estimated at 25 percent or 
more this year, now appears to be heading even 
higher.

The economic plight of the government has 
also sparked rumors of devaluation. Although 
these rumors are being given some credence in 
local business circles, there is no evidence that 
the government is planning any such politically 
unpalatable move in the immediate future. Fur-
ther, President Velasco has in the past been very 
firm in stating that his government will not 
preside over devaluation. Morales Bermudez' 
views are not known, although he is generally 
regarded as more flexible on financial policy 
than Velasco. While it is true that he is gradually 
assuming a greater role in the decision-making 
process, particularly in economic affairs, he is 
probably not ready to take such a major step. 
In fact, Morales Bermudez will have his 
hands full in trying to avoid being the political 
victim of his controversial subsidy policy with-
out becoming the focus of opposition on an 
even more controversial issue. As the subsidies 
aru gradually reduced in the months ahead, 
prices will inevitably rise and labor dissatisfac-
tion, already high, will increase. There are indi-
cations that the strong communist trade union 
confederation is feeling increasing internal pres-
sure to refuse or withdraw its support of the 
govarnment. Implementation of the new eco-
nomic measures will do little to assuage such 
pressures. Perhaps symbolic of this new strained 
relationship was the relatively minor role that 
the confederation played in the Flag Day cere-
monies, and the absence of its representatives in 
a "march" of enthusiastic civilians who followed 
Velasco back to the presidential palace. 
Public reaction to the economic measures 
so far has been slight, but it may pick up in late 
July when the government is expected to raise 
the price of petroleum products, a move that 
will almost immediately be felt in the vital trans-
portation sector. 
For Morales Bermudez, much is at stake. 
Successful implementation of the new policy 
and an improvement in the economic situation 
would further strengthen his position within the 
government and solidify his hold on the succes-
sion. On the other hand, a major slip now would 
probably leave the field to other ambitious and  
less moderate generals.

Sam Neua to Luang Prabang for the opening 
session of the coalition's Joint National Political 
Council, which the Prince chairs. Souphanou-
vong has been at communist headquarters for 
the past two months. 
If such a conclave has been called, the 
Pathet Lao leadership will almost certainly want

cesses achieved over the past six weeks and to 
determine the pace at which a complete take-

CHINA-PHILIPPMES: DIPLOMATIC TIES 
Peking's campaign for improved official 
relations with non-communist Southeast Asian 
countries took an important step forward this 
week with the announcement that China and 
the Philippines had established diplomatic rela-
tions on June 9. A trade agreement w As signed 
on the same day, but no details were provided. 
President Marcos sees relations with Peking as a 
vital part of his more general effort to create an 
independent foreign policy and end his nation's 
international image as a US client state. 
Peking now has official ties with two mem-
ber countries of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations. Relations with Malaysia were 
opened last year and, according to recent re-
ports, Thailand s prepared to follow suit with 
an announcement that could come as early as 
next month. That would leave Singapore and 
Indonesia as the only remaining ASEAN coun-
tries having no active diplomatic relations with 
Peking. 
The Chinese used the occasion of Marcos' 
visit to Peking to warn against attempts by the 
USSR to expand its influence in Asia and to 
express Peking's sensitivity about charges of Chi-
nese interference in the internal affairs of other 
countries. 
Chinese fears that the Soviets are attempt-
ing to take advantage of recent communist vic-
tories in Indochina to improve their position in 
the area were evident in the joint communique 
announcing the establishment of relations, as 
weii as in Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's speech 
at the banquet welcoming Marcos. The commu-
nique included a provision condemning any 
country that attempts to "establish hegemony 
or spheres of influence in any part of the 
world," a now standard ingredient in Peking's 
anti-Soviet fare. 
In addition, Teng complimented Manila for 
its opposition to "hegemonism" in recent years 
and pointed out that Southeast Asian countries 
had broad international support for the plan to 
create a zone of peace and neutrality in South-
east Asia, a scheme that Peking apparently be-
lieves will help forestall any increase in Soviet 
influence in the region. Teng confidently de-
clared that Asian countries would quickly see 
through any Soviet "wiles and schemes" in the 
region. 
On the subject of interference in internal 
affairs, the communique stated that both coun-
tries condemn foreign aggression and,,u',)version, 
as well as all attempts by any country to control 
another country or to interfere in its internal 
affairs. In addition, Teng said in his speech that 
China would near "bully" another country and 
acknowledged that a country's social system can 
be decided ' Dniy by its own people." This 
formulation goes slightly further than that used 
at the time of Malaysian recognition and appears 
Lo be another indication that China expects to 
play down support for Asian insurgencies in the 
aftermath of Indochina. 
On the Taiwan issue, the Philippines stated 
in the communique that it "fully understands 
and respects" Peking's claim to the island?a 
standard formulation. The communique also in-
cluded notice of Manila's decision to withdraw 
all official representatives from Taiwan within 
one month. There is a good chance, however, 
that the Philippines will maintain a significant

number of commercial and other non-official 
contacts with the Nationalists on Taiwan. 
In the communique, both sides agreed that 
citizens of one country who acquire citizenship 
in the other automatically forfeit their original 
citizenship, a formula for dealing with the sensi-
tive question of overseas Chinese residents in the 
Philippines. The provision does not take into 
account Peking's responsibilities toward those 
ethnic Chinese who retain Chinese citizenship, 
although Peking has for several years consis-
tently urged overseas Chinese to adopt the citi-
zenship of the country in which they reside. 
CHINA: TRADE RETRENCHMENT 
Worldwide inflation and recession defused 
China's foreign trade boom in 1974 and is lead-
ing to a Ntrenchment in 1975. 
Saaring prices boosted China's import bill 
in 1974 to $7.4 billion, while the economic 
slowdown in the West dampened the demand 
for Chinese goods. Total exports rose to only 
$6.3 billion, resulting in a record $1.1-billion 
trade deficit. China's current account balance 
with non-communist countries plunged $1.3 bi:-
lion into the red, and, despite a greater use of 
supplier credits and short-term borrowing, Pe-
king had to draw down its reserves by $300 
million to finance the gap. 
Sales at the Canton Trade Fairs, a major 
indicator of Chinese exports, point to lagging 
exports this year. Although the Chinese tried to 
boost sales by cutting prices at the fall 1974 and 
spring 1975 fairs, commercially both were 
dismal events. Attendance at the spring fair may 
have fallen to 15,000, compared with the 
25,000 figure Peking reported last fall, and the 
volume of business was probably less than the 
$700-million fall fair level?the lowest in years. 
In an attempt to redress its trade deficit, 
Peking will trim its imports during the year. 
Based on existing contracts, imports of agricul-
tural products will fall from the record $1.9 
billion in 1974 to about $1.3 billion this year. 
China will purchase only 4.4 million tons of 
grain?down from 7 million tons last year?at a 
cost of $675 million. Cotton purchases also are 
down sharply; soybean imports have been 
phased out. 
Machinery and equipment imports, which 
more than doubled in 1974 to $1.7 billion, will 
grow more slowly this year. Much equipment is 
in the pipeline under contracts signed in the past 
few years, but Peking has restricted new pur-
chases to badly needed replacements and high. 
priority machinery such as oil drilling and 
mining equipment. New orders for whole 
plants?$1.2 billion in 1973 and $900 million in 
1974?will probably decline sharply this year. In 
the first four months, Peking only concluded 
contracts for bearings plants worth $20 mil-
lion?a radical scale-down of the $100-million 
facility originally sought. 
Barring a rapid turnaround in the world 
economy, Chinese exports this year will prob-
ably grow little over last year's level. Partial 
trade returns for 1975 indicate that exports are 
up about 10 percent over the same period last 
year. If the trend continues, they would total 
about $6.9 billion this year. With imports likely 
to be about the same as in 1974, the trade 
deficit would be reduced to about $500 million, 
resulting in an improvement in China's hard-
currency balance of payments. 
Despite the deficit in 1974, China's balance 
of payments is not in crisis. Although repay-
ments of short-term credits and progress pay-
ments for whole plants will total more than $1 
billion this year, reserves ate adequate and Pe-
king's credit rating is excellent. Credits for grain, 
whole plant equipment, and Japanese steel and 
fertilizer will finance much of the reduced trade 
deficit in 1975. With continued large remit-
tances from overseas Chinese and some bank 
borrowing, however, China will probably be ab:e 
to avoid drawing down its reserves of gold and  
foreign exchange.  r

BURMA: RENEWED PROTESTS 
Small-srale protests against the Burmese 
government by Audents and workers, largely 
over poor economic conditions, began last 
month in Rangoon. The unrest escalated last 
week, as the protesting groups commemorated 
the anniversary of the violent labor disoiders 
last year, during which troops killed more than 
20 demonstrators. 
Last weekend the protests took on a more 
virulent antigovernment tone as several thou-
sand students marched through the streets of 
Rangoon. A considerable number of workers in 
the Rangoon area joined in, and what had 
originally been work slowdowns became strikes, 
resulting in the closure of several factories. 
Students in Mandalay also staged a demonstra-
tion. 25X1 
This week, the government used troops to 
arrest more than 200 students in Rangoon, after 
ordering the universities closed. The universities 
had reopened only last month, after being shut 
down in December as a result of student-
initiated disorders over the funeral of former 
UN secretary general U Thant. Troops were used 
only after authorities first tried a conciliatory 
policy, announcing that some of the economic 
demands of the workers would be met and send-
ing high-ranking officials to meet with both 
worker and student groups. The meetings with 
students were called off, however, because the 
sessions aroused considerable hostility among 
the students. 
The government's tough measures will 
probably bring an end to the protests, although 
they may lead to further bitterness a ainst the 
regirne.1 
 iThe 
government is publicly blaming the Burmese 
communists for inciting the disturbances, but 
there is no evidence to support  this 
charge. 25X1
