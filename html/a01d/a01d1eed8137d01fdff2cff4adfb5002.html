			   	"Two  of  my  sons  and  one  of  my  nephews  are  with  me  in  Peking.    	My  eldest  eon,

			    	We  did  not  know  what  would  happen  to  us,  if  ~fie  would  ever  come  aut  alive.
			    	The  most  horrible  thing  for  flis  Royal  Highness  was  knowing  that  the  peo-

			    	there  was  nothing  he  could  do  about  it.    	All  day  long,  I  tried  to  raise

			    	very  ill  and  is  said  to  have  become  deaf.'    	Actually,  he  was  quite  well
			    	and  I  was  the  one  with  ear  problems."
			     	She  continued:    	"Three  times  a  year,  Kieu  Sampan  came  to  get  us  ~nd  took
			     	us  out  in  a~eep  to  put  us  on  display  in  the  rural  areas.    	It  was  frightful

				    	[Report  by  Ph3lipp~e  Devillera:    	"IQimers  Return  'Home"']
				    	[Excerpt]    	On  the  evening  of  3  April  I  had  a,meeCing  witr.  People!s  Republic
				    	of  Canibodia  Foreign  Minieter  Hu  aen.    	He  is  28  yeare  old.    	He  originatee		     	,
				    	from  Kompong  Cham,  was  forr~.erly  a  student  and  then  a  Khmer  Rouge  militiary
				    	officer  throughout  the  pertod  1970-77  in  the  eastern  region,   	and  at  the

				    	ber  he  was  elected  youth  leader  before  being  entruated  wiCh  foreign  affaire
				    	in  January  1979.    	According  to  him,   	90  percent  of  population  have  now  re-
				    	turned  to  their  native  villages,  but  the  migration  continues  by  all  avail-
				    	able  means--car,   	bicycle,   	cart,  boat.    	Since  all  pexsonal  effecta  were  con-
				    	fiscated  by  Pol  Pot,   	each  family  has  taken  wha~  it  needs  from  the  cooperative
				    	to  which  it  belonged.    	This  general  migration  is  certainly  having  a  big
				    	effect  on  agricultural  work  and  will  certainly  have  conaequences  for  pro-
				    	duction  but,  Mr  Hun  Sen  said,   	it  was  imposeible  ;o  go  against  the  ardent
				    	wiah  of  the  whole  people:    	to~go  home....
	   	-			 	To  mark  the  I~mer  New  Fear   	(13  April),   	the  government  has  launched  an  appeal.
				    	It  is  also  the  day  of  the  first  furrow,   	and  throughout  the  country  it  eeea
				    	the  start  of  the  main  farming  taska.
				    	"There  is  acarcely  anything  more  Pol  Pot  can  do.    	He  has  forced  many  peas-
				    	ants  to  follow  him  into  the  forest.    	He  has  even  had  many  people's  tendons
				    	cut.to  prevent  them  from  fleeing,  but  every  daq  we  free  more  groupe.    	Pol
				    	Pot  has  only  light  weapons  left.    	All  his  army's  heavy  arma  have  been  re-
				    	covered.    	Admittedly  China  recently  sent  arms  to  him  thraugh  7'hailand,  but
				    	that  will  not  alter  the  reault.    	Pol  Pot's  forces  are  now  being  hunted  down.
				    	They  are  forced  to  move  around  constantly  and  cannot  set  up  any  firm  and
				    	lasting  bases.    	Moreover  Che  aituation  is  returning  to  normal.    	When  the
				    	population  are  back  in  their  famiiiar  environment  they  will  set  about  pro-
