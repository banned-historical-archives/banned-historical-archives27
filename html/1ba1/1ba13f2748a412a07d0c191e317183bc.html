UK plans early withdrawal from Somaliland--According to US Embassy London, the UK Foreign Office has decided to inform the UN immediately of the British plan for turning over the administration of Somaliland to Italy. The Foreign Office indicated that during the next few months Italian personnel and military forces will arrive in the territory and that the transition from British to Italian administration will be completed by the end of March, whether or not a trusteeship agreement between the UN and Italy has been concluded. The Embassy told the Foreign Office that it would be preferable for the UK to remain in the territory until the trusteeship agreement is concluded. 2. India unconciliatory on Kashmir proposals--The US Dele- gation to the UN reports that India has submitted amendments to Security Council President McNaughton's proposals which would in effect: (a) compel the withdrawal or disbanding of all Pakistan-controlled forces (including Azad Forces) in Kashmir without compensating reductions on the Indian side; and (b) require transfer of administrative and military control of the disputed northern area of Kashmir to India and to the Indian-controlled Kashmir state government. (CIA Comment: Contrary to earlier indications that the proposed Indian amendments might be conciliatory, these proposals would resolve all disputed points in India's favor.) 1178 CIA -S S-1'S 3.

The Secretary General added that this decision, which had been reached after consultation with the British Government was made because of Norwegian shipping interests in China rather than for political reasons. 2. India to modify rejection of Kashmir proposals --The US Delegation to the UN has learned that the Indian UN representative has received new instructions from New Delhi permitting modification of India's rejection of Security Council President McNaughton's proposals to break the Kashmir deadlock. McNaughton told the US representatives that India will avoid insistence on the legality of its position and will suggest that the proposals be changed by amendments not yet specified.

The Ambassador adds that the Greek Charge is now convinced, on the basis of this information, that all Greek guerrillas are now in the Tashkent area and that this means there will be no war on Greek borders in the spring of 1950.

(CIA Comment: CIA believes that: (a) India's rejection of the McNaughton proposals is attributable primarily to the personal intransigence of Nehru on the Kashmir issue; (b) the dispute will be aggravated by the almost inevitable public airing of the Kashmir case fol- lowing India's rejection of the McNaughton proposals; and (c) the public airing of the dispute will provide the USSR with an'opporttmity to exploit the differences between India and Pakistan.) 2.

The UK is informing the Israeli Government that: (a) the question of extending the treaty is a matter which concerns only the UK and Jordan; and (b) the UK has no intention of establishing, in peace time, military bases in any territory which Jordan might acquire. (CIA Comment: The decision of the UK to extend the defense treaty to any parts of Palestine which Jordan might acquire will make the Israelis less willing to reach a settlement with Jordan in the present peace talks.) 2, Simultaneous UK recognition of China and Indochina asked-- US Ambassador Bruce in Paris reports that French For- eign Minister Schuman has requested UK Foreign Secre- tary Bevin to postpone British recognition of the Chinese Communist Government (planned for 2 January 1950) until the Bao Dai Government in Indochina can be recognized simultaneously by the UK. In his message to Bevin, Schu- man points out that Bao Dai's powers will be increased before 1 January and that debate by the National Assembly on the Indochina bill should begin about 12 January. The French Foreign Minister calls attention to the new ele- ment introduced by Mao Tse-tungs visit to Moscow and emphasizes his great apprehension that this "proclamation" of Sino-Soviet solidarity would have the effect, if imme- diately followed by British recognition of Mao's regime before de facto recognition of Bao Dai, of "severely weak- ening the spirit of resistance" to Communism thraughout 061 , N Southeast Asia, ocument o.

The Ambassador adds that France is still in the throes of a basic political readjust- ment, which was in no way furthered by the formation of the Bidault Cabinet.

The Ambassador expresses the belief that recognition by the US, along with the UK and some other countries, would greatly facilitate and expe- dite the loss of Asia to the Communists. In conclusion, Stanton strongly recommends that the US promptly issue an official statement setting forth US intentions in regard to recognizing Communist China. FAR EAST 21 DEC 1949 1172 2. INDOCHINA: Chinese Communist troops contact French-- 5 -5 US Consul General Hanoi has been informed by General Alessandri, the French commander in Indochina, that a small Chinese Communist force pursued "surrender- ing Nationalists" across the Indochinese border. The French commander added that the Communist captain in command of the unit, upon being informed by a French officer that he had entered French territory, apologized abjectly" and signified his intention of retiring; before leaving, however, the Communist commander asked that the French officer sign a statement that the Communist force had pursued the Nationalists "to the very limit of Chinese territory." General Alessandri commented that further developments are expected along the frontier re- gions of west China, where the remnants of the Nationalist 14th Army are now located.

Spaak expressed the conviction, however, that the British are steadfast in their opposition to his ap- pointment and have now adopted the tactics of "open neutral- ity" while inducing the Scandinavian countries to spearhead the opposition. In connection with the British contention that ileading OEEC would require Spaak's resignation from the Belgian Parliament, Spaak expressed the belief that there is no legal requirement for his resignation. Spaak added that he would -like to accept the appointment to head OEEC on the basis of a six-months trial period during which he "would be on a leave of absence status from Belgian politics." 2.

Estimate of Soviet position in Europe--US Ambassador Kirk in Moscow suggests that the Kremlin's year-end estimate of the European scene is probably characterized by: (a) satisfaction in general regarding Satellite con- trol and evolution; (b) continuing anger and concern over Tito, tempered by the belief that incipient Titoism is being effectively suppressed in the remaining Satellites; and (c) real hopes for eventual advances in Germany and Western Europe. Kirk points out that although the Kremlin is aware of increased western integration and the loss of Communist control of world labor, the Kremlin never- theless may expect these western gains to be wiped out eventually by the "deepening economic crisis" and "contradictions" between the western powers. The Ambassador concludes that Moscow may again, as in 1947, be considerably ovet-estimating Soviet prospects outside the Iron Curtain in Europe. (C.IA Comment: CIA believes that despite the Kreinlin's optimistic expectations for an eventual western economic crisis and increasing disunity among the western powers, the Kremlin probably recognizes that the USSR has suffered a temporary setback in Europe caused by: (a) military, economic, and political measures undertaken by the western powers; (b) the problems arising from Tito's deviations; and (c) reduced effectiveness of Communist parties in Western Eurwean nations.)

US views on position of world communism-- The Department of State, in considering the implications of the recent Cominform Communioue and an earlier speech by Malenkov, has expressed the view, that the Kremlin's optimism regarding the present position of world communism is .based largely upon Soviet progress in atomic developments and the success .of the Chinese Communists. The Department points out, however, that the communique appears at most to be a Soviet decision to continue present strategy with special emphasis upon a "peace drive" as a means of rallying support and perhaps developing an ideological basis for possible future Communist action in western Europe. In support of the view that the Kremlin is still concerned with areas of continuing weakness � in Europe, the Department points to: (1) the present _ inability of the Kremlin to overthrow Tito; (2) Soviet apprehension lest the Titoist heresy of national communism pread; and (3) the present palitidal sterility of Communists in western Europe. 0 10 DEC 1949 1163 CIA Document No. NO CHANGE in C�lass. 0 DECLASSIFIED TS S Class.

The :Embassy observes that the suggestion to conduct trade with the GDR through committees of Chambers of Commerce was well received by the Commission. 2. UK views on positibn of world communism--According to US Embassy London, the British Foreign Office con- siders that the recent Cominform communique reveals world communism to be in an essentially defensive position despite the Communist victory in China and "the unsatisfactory economic situation in the free world." In support of this view, the Foreign Office contrasts the Soviet strategy of 1947, which was designed to take advantage of the "ripe revolutionary harvest" in Western Europe, with such present Soviet defensive actions as the establishment of an East German Goveriunent, the appointment of Rokossovsky in Poland, and the 'purges in the Satellites ilooment No. o cHANGE in Class.

C. Wu offered Taiwan Governorship�US Consul General Taipei has been informed by K. C. Wu, former Nationalist mayor of Shanghai, that the National Government of China has requested him to assume the Governorship of Taiwan. Wu indicated his willingness to accept the post, provided he is able to: (a) choose his officials personally; (b) control all national and provincial organs on the island; (c) attend all military conferences; and (d) establish a "truly democratic" form of government. Estimating that Taiwan's economy would collapse within two or three months unless aid is received, Wu expressed the hope that the US would accept the change in administration as a "first step in the right direction" and consider extending immediate. assistance, as the reforms he envisions cannot succeed unless aid is forthcoming on a step-by-step basis. .(CIA Comment: CIA believes that Wu would be confirmed as Governor of Taiwan primarily in the hope of involving the US as deeply as possible in Nationalist affairs on 'Taiwan. CIA further believes that Wu probably would be unable either to take independent action as Governor of Taiwan or to halt continuing military and political deterioration on the island.) Separatism in Southwest--US Consul General Kunming reports that a spokesman of the Yumianese separatist group has stated that, despite the lack of US support for the move- ment, serious consideration is being given to declaration of Yunnan's independence from the rest of China.

The most likely dates the members of the defeated Nacionalista Party might choose for inciting a general armed rebellion would be: (1) immediately following the 13 December special session of Congress which meets to proclaim officially Quirino's victory; or .(2) on or about 30 December when "Quirino's inauguration is scheduled to take place. Although sporadic violence and the general dissatisfaction now pre- vailing provide an improved opportunity for inciting armed rebellion, it is unlikely that a lasting or widespread re- volt against the present government can be achieved. Even a short-lived revolt, however, involving rioting and � vollence in Manila, would expose US citizens to injury and US property to damage. .Such"disorders would also provide the Communist-led Huk dissidents with a favorable opportunity for attacks upon US military personnel and equipment in the Clark Field area. Concerning the possible duration, scope, and outcome of an attempted rebellion, three factors are dominant: (1) the leadership of the movement; (2) the Government's capabilities for maintaining order and suppressing the revolt; and (3) the extent of popular support which an armed uprising might Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 TOP receive. Jose Laurel, recently defeated presidential randidate and leader of the Nacionalista Party, is the only available opposition leader capable of gaining widespread support among the Philippine -people. No evidence indicating Laurel's involvement with the reported Nacionalista plans for revolt is available, but his active support of the reported uprising must be considered to be a possibility. The Government's security forces are capable of controlling a Nacionalista-inspired uprising, unless forced to cope simultaneously with a large- scale offensive by the Huk dissidents. Even in this event, the Government forces are probably capable of maintaining security unless the uprising and the Buk offensives were under combined and unified leadership, which is unlikely. Moreover, in regard to possible popular support for an armed rebellion against the Government, a majority of the people sppported President Quirino at the polls and would probably do so again during any critical situation. � - E T .117/ Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 3.3(h)(2) 3.3(h)(2) 24(65 .

Views on Rokossovsky appointment in Poland USMinister T5Is Schoenfeld in Bucharest considers the appointment of Mar- shal Rokossovsky as Polish Minister of Defense and Com- mander in Chief of the Polish Army as "authoritative confirmation" of the general Soviet policy toward integration of Soviet and Satellite military systems envisaged in the secret military protocols of the various Soviet-Satellite Mutual Assistance Pacts. Schoenfeld discounts the view that Rokossovsky will assume the role of an all-Satellite defense coordinator, pointing out that the Soviet military problem in Poland is primarily related to the German sit- uation, whereas the principal Soviet concern in the Balkans is a hostile Yugoslavia. Moreover, Schoenfeld cites past Soviet policy toward the Cominform and the Council of � Economic Mutual Assistance as indicative of Soviet reluc- ta.nce to delegate effective power over the Satellites as a whole to a headquarters outside the USSR.

Davis adds that the Arias government may soon be able to meet three conditions for recognition: de facto control, ability and willingness to meet obligations, and the acquiescence of the great majority of the people. In assessing possible future developments, Davis comments that the greatest uncertainty locally is the outcome of the struggle of the government to free itself from the now thoroughly discredited police clique that placed it in power. Davis believes that although the police have thus far refused to accept any, solution involving the resignation of present police leaders, Arias cannot accept police domina- tion. According to Davis, Arias will probably avoid a direct clash with the police and will eventually outwit the present police leadership. Meanwhile, the Department of State has informed Am- bassador Davis of its intention to exchange views on recognition with other American Republics, centering its inquiry on the present regimes control of administration and territory and its ability and willingness to meet international obligations. -2 - Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 f "Th 24 r6o Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 TOP SEC GENERAL 1.

AUSTRIA: Foreign Minister's suggestions for Austrian Army-- CIA Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber has advised US Legation Vienna that it would be a mistake for the western powers to approach the USSR, either before or after the signing of an Austrian treaty, regarding the establishment of a "pre- liminary" Austrian Army. Gruber suggests that a Soviet� signature on a treaty should be assumed to be approval for the Austrian Government to prepare to implement all the treaty provisions, thus enabling Austria to proceed quietly with its plans for an army during the 90 days between ratification of the treaty and the withdrawal of occupation troops. The Austrian Foreign Minister feels that con- eultation with the USSR would involve the ritik of Soviet refusal for Austrian action prior to the effective date of a treaty and that this refusal would make it difficult for the Austrians to do more than elementary military planning. Gruber is even more apprehensive lest the USSR be given an opportunity to insist that preparations for the future' army be carried out under the supervision of the four- power Allied Council which, Gruber believes, would give the USSR a chance to interfere with the planning and to impede the program. .

BULGARIA: Effects of purges in Bulgaria�US Minister Heath reports that the 6 'c ea s e le s s " purges in all ranks of the Bulgarian Communist Party, as well as present indications that these purges will continue, have brought the entire Communist structure "not too far removed from panic." According to Heath, Bulgarian Communist officials "in all echelons" are now filled with unprece- dented anxiety, fear, and mutual distrust. Heath believes that, although a majority of Bulgarian Communists would welcome a greater degree of independence from the 'Kremlin, the USSR took measures to ensure that no organized threat emerged and that now not even the basis for an organized plot exists. In Heath's opinion, despite the arrest of potential deviationists, the swell of Bulgarian resentment against the Kremlin will continue as long as Tito holds out and life in Bulgaria remains hard and in- secure. Heath doubts that resentment against the Kremlin tan'at this time be developed into a Titoist rebellion, but points to the opportunities for exploiting the schism in the Communist Party by means of a vigorous program of US and Yugoslav broadcasts to Bulgaria. Heath recommends also that an anti-Communist passive resistance network within Bulgaria be established through aid and counsel to refugee resistance organizations abroad. FAR EAST 2.

KOREA: Defenses may be jeopardized�US Ambassador Muccio transmits his opinion that increased prices and altered availability policies adopted for the Military Aid Program (MAP) in Korea will cause US aid to fall short of the minimum requirements outlined in original estimates and will seriously jeopardize the entire US effort in Korea by wakening military support to the Korean security forces. Muccio points out that failure to provide proper and adequate military aid will leave the Republic of Korea open to aggres- sion by the steadily expanding Communist forces in North Korea. Muccio comments further that the South Korean forces are now "seriously checkmated" due to lack of normal replacements for major military items and adds that reductions in MAP supplies would also "kill the possi- bility" of strengthening the Coast Guard which is now wholly Incapable of performing its mission. The Ambassador strongly recommends that pricing and availability policies be reviewed and adjusted to give Korea at least the modest requirements considered to be the irreducible minimum for protecting US interests in Korea.

Lovink told the Consul General that the western powers, by apparently withdrawing from the Far Eastern area and failing to provide "authority" in world politics, may lead the Indonesians to assume a "neutral" position between the East and the West. Lovink added that he has no faith in the projected Southeast Asia Union, which he believes would be susceptible to Communist influence, with China as the potential great Asiatic power. Lovink therefore urges that the US, the UK, and the Netherlands develop a strong concerted policy of political and economic support for Indonesia and that joint military defense commitments be made to the new Indonesian Republic.

Western policy on Germany--The Secretary of State transmits a directive which was agreed upon during the Paris conference with the UK and French Foreign Secre- taries and which is aimed at establishing more normal conditions in Germany. Beginning with the statement that the occupation statute will remain in force until re- viewed, the directive instructs the High Commissioners to prepare for a smooth evolution toward a 1950 program including: (a) admission of the West German Federal Republic to the Council of Europe as an associate member; (b) consideration of Germany for membership in other , international organizations; (c) simultaneous admission of the Saar to the Council of Europe, providing that such action shall not affect its final status; and (d) the gradual establishment by the German Republic of consular and commercial representatives in foreign countries, and a bureau to coordthate the activities of such representa- tives. The directive also states that a committee of jurists will be appointed to examine the legal problems involved in ending the state of war and concludes that the western nations, iikluding the Federal Republic, should avoid as far as possible any action implying de facto or de jure recognition of the German Democratic Republic in the Soviet zone. 14 Nov 1949 1141 � Document No. b No CHANGE in Class. 0 DECLAS3I2LED Class.

Bevin also said that Australia "did not want" recognition before the 10 De- cember Australian elections. At the same meeting, French Foreign Minister Schuman expressed his concern over the Impact on Indochina of the Chinese Communist advance and urged some immediate gesture by the US and UK in support of French policy and the Bao Dai regime.

In support of postponing recognition, Kirk points out that: (a) im- portant areas of China still remain outside Communist control; (b) the USSR has not yet questioned the authority of Chinese Nationalist representatives at the UN General Assembly; and (c) US recognition at this time, in the light of previous public statements, could be interpreted as acquiescence to British and other pressures. The ambassador adds that indefinite delay in extending recognition would "cede increasing initiative to Soviet policy in China and suggests that the Baguio Con- ference (scheduled for early. 1950), or a similar meeting of the .free peoples of Southeast Asia, might provide the best occasion for simultaneous eastern and western recognition of the Chinese Communist regime. 5 - T5 2.

British views on Indochina�US Consul General Saigon has been informed by his British colleague that the common opinion of top British Far Eastern officials at the recent Singapore conference was that recognition of the Communist regime in China would have a serious impact on Indochina, where the present situation is deemed critical. Because UK officials were convinced that failure of the Bao Dai regime would inevitably re- sult in Communist control of Indochina and the subsequent loss of both Siam and Burma, they have urgently recom- mended to the UK that the possibilities of British aid to Bao Dai be examined. 2. Nationalist reply to US statement on Taiwan�In response to a recent statement outlining the US attitude toward Taiwan, GenerVissimo Chiang Kai-shek has informed US Consul General Taipei of his agreement with the US view that improvement of the well-being of the Taiwanese people will strengthen the security of that strategic island. Chiang explains that steps for such improvement are already being taken and points out that economic difficulties are secondary to the serious menace of a Communist in- vasion. In stressing the urgent need for strengthening Nationalist armed forces on the island, Chiang presented the Consul General with a detailed request for US aid, in- cluding "military assistance of a technical nature," which he hoped would prove to be within the scope of present US policy. Chiang concluded that if the US Government decides to meet these requests, the "fullest cooperation" of the Nationalist administration on Taiwan would be forthcoming.

USSR would gain from early Japanese treaty--US Embassy Moscow expresses the view that an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan would be less advantageous to the West than to the USSR. Assuming that such a treaty would provide for the withdrawal of allied occupation troops, the Embassy doubts whether the Japanese, faced with the psychological pressure of strong Soviet forces in the neighboring Far East, could, resist Communist infiltra- tion, propaganda, and revolution, The Embassy points out that communization of Japan would enable the USSR to con- trol the strategic japanese islands and extent Soviet power in the western Pacific, possibly a.s far as the East Indies and Singapore, thus jeopardizing the nations of Southeast Asia.

(The UK has already informed the US of its desire to make a downward revision in the dismantling program, to set an early cut-off date for dismantling, and to apply pressure on the French to agree to these proposal.) 27 OCT 149 1127 Document No. 1�5 NO CHANGE in Class. 0 D DECLASS:1:2'ED Class, CHL,101.:D TO: TS S DDA Menlo , 4 Apr 77 uth: 'Tato;1.rikAdjaziL : Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 24730 ����� Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 TOP SEC GENERAL 26 ocT1949 1126 1. Aspects of East-West trade--In analyzing the over-all effects. of western economic policies during a recent meeting in Loixdon, US ambassadors to the Soviet bloc countries expressed the opinion that western economic policies are already creating economic difficulties between Moscow and the Satellites and offer a major field for "further and better" western efforts. The ambassadors consider the present time to be particularly opportune for effective economic action by the West, largely because: (a) the Satellite economies have not yet recovered from war devastation, shortages, and forced economic re- orientations directed from Moscow; and (b) the Western Euro- pean countries may be more willing to cooperate now than at some future date when pressures to find markets for expanded production will have increased. In regard to long-range eco- nomic policy, the ambassadors point out that Western Europe should seek to expand alternate sources of supply for essential items now obtained from the Soviet bloc and to develop new markets for products of Western Europe's heavy industries.

UK favors early end to German dismantling--According to US Ambassador Douglas in London, the UK is now in favor of a downward revision of the present dismantling program in Western Germany on a selective basis and even favors the fixing of an early cut-off date for dismantling. Douglas con- siders it quite possible that the British will suggest another meeting on the German problem by US, UK, and French for- eign ministers before the end of the year and that, meanwhile, the British will press for a slowdown in dismantling. The Ambassador estimates that the new British attitude largely reflects concern over both the loss of British prestige in Western Germany and the incompatibility Of continued dis- mantling with long-range western objectives in Germany.

In transmitting Jessup's view to US Embassy Rome, the Department of State has re- quested that strongest representations be immediately made to Italian Foreign Minister Sforza if the Embassy judges there is any possibility of changing the Italian attitude. The Embassy is to point out that UN failure to agree on Eritrea would en- danger prospects of any Somali and Libyan solution, thus greatly decreasing chances of achieving any satisfaction for Italy. 2.

Bevin fears that a GA decision to establish a closely unified Libya would frustrate the con- clusion of the desired Anglo-Cyrenaican treaty on defense arrangements; he also believes that GA appointment of an advisory council or high commissioner would be contrary to these British aims.

The UK has been kept informed of these developments and has been requested by the Iraqi and Syrian Governments to determine the attitude of the US toward the projected union. Although unification of the two countries would theoreti- cally reduce instability in the Arab world and thus serve US- UK security interests in the area, it seems unlikely that the proposed merger can be carried through at this time without a seriously disruptive effect throughout the Near East. Despite apparent British support for the plan and the inchoate yearning of Arab nationalists for unity, sa Iraqi-Syrian Union would be faced with complicated practical obstacles which neither of the two parties appears capable of overcoming successfully. In Syria, particularly, the plan would probably meet with con- siderable opposition: from the army, which is shot through with factionalism as a result of the two recent coups; from young ultra-nationalists; from certain powerful Damascus poli- tical leaders, who would naturally dislike Damascus to be rele- gated to a subordinate position vis-a-vis Baghdad; and from the large element in the population which is deeply distrustful of the British and would consider the plan a manifestation of British imperialism. Sentiment in Iraq would probably favor unification. Even there, however, anti-British feeling exists, and the necessity for reviewing the potentially explosive ques- tion of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty might provide a major stumbling block to implementation of the merger'plan. An attempt at Iraqi-Syrian union would also arouse grave misgivings and considerable opposition among ..e other Arab states.

Israel would almost certainly oppose the new development as in- creasing Arab military potential and might well peremptorily settle by military occupation its current boundary dispute with Syria. France would also oppose the union as representing an mansion of British influence into Syria which the French have always considered their own sphere. Under these circumstances, steps toward economic union would appear to offer the two Governments a less risky method of attaining their objectives and would permit more orderly progress toward greater stability in the Near East. A slow but steady strengthening of economic ties � between the two countries would not only confer direct bene- fits upon the area but, by establishing a greater community of interests, would facilitate the eventual Astablishiment of political union. - Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 24715 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749477 RET FAR EAST 8 OCT 1949 1111 I.

The Embassy considers that the Yugo- slav position has not been weakened by these denunciations. The Embassy believes that this Soviet action has been aimed primarily at protecting the Cominform area from the in- fluence of the Tito heresy, rather than at subverting the Yugoslav regime. The Embassy estimates that the Yugoslav reaction to the recent moves will be moderate because the Yugoslays are determined not to be provoked into any rash action. (CIA Comment: CIA agrees with this estimate.) 2. Views on Soviet note on Germany--US Embassy Moscow expresSes the view tt i11i2Oc ber Soviet note on the West German government represents more than a propaganda gesture and may be designed to lay the groundwork for a series of moves calculated to counter western progress in Europe and Germany and to advance the Soviet cause there. The Embassy suggests that even though the note itself gives no decisive hint as to what steps the Kremlin is planning, the USSR may consider this an opportune moment to regain the initiative on the German question and may by this action be laying the groundwork for the establishment of an East German government. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that the Soviet note � primarily represents a final protest for the record against the West German state prior to the early establishment of an East Geiiiisin government.)

Comments on �possible Syrian -Ira ti union�US Ambassador ruce In Paris, In response to the Dfmeut of State's request for comments on a possible union between Syria and Iraq, expresses the belief that the French would be strongly opposed to any such move. According to Bruce, the French Foreign Mice has constantly stressed the maintenance of the status quo in the Near East as a keystone of French policy and would undoubtedly interpret the union of Syria and Iraq as a further extension of British influence In the Near East at French expense. Bruce feels that at a time when the French are worried over US Intentions con- cerning the UK on the one hPad and Europe on the other, the US should not permit its.ehl to be placed in a situation where it becomes directly involved in the deterioration of UK-French relations.

The Yugoslav Minister declared that Yugoslavia is now solely interested in preserving its independence and is convinced that the Austrian treaty, with an agreement on the withdlrawal of Soviet troops from Austria, would be of immense benefit in encouraging Yugoslav resistilnce to Soviet pressure. Bebler admitted that Soviet troops would not leave Austria immediately after the treaty was signed and that the USSR could find a pretext for not with- drawing its troops from Hungary and Rumania, but he ex- pressed the opinion that the USSR would be reluctant at present to face UN crnicism of such evasion of its treaty obligations. The Yugoslav official expressed the hope of his Government that the US will not be rigid in its attitude towards the economic clauses of the treaty because the dargers of no settlement are "far more serious."

Bevin re- ported that although Vishinsky's attitude was much more friendly than it has been in the meetings of the four minis- ters, he yielded very little on the principal points and evi- dently has been given no latitude concerning them. Vishinsky Indicated that if the questions of oil exploration rights, pipe- line, and rolling stock were cleared up, there might not be difficulty on the other articles: he said he would refer a western proposal on oil rights to Moscow. 0 Document No. 1106 NO CHANGE in Class. 0 0 DECLASSIFILD Class.

Views on Tito-Cominform rift--US Embassy Moscow, commenting on the curt Soviet note abrogating the Soviet- Yugoslav Mutual Aid Pact, expresses the view that it still further sharpens the Tito-Cominform conflict and its very shortness could be interpreted as designed to clear away legal obstacles to positive action. The Embassy, however sees no reason for altering its basic estimate concerning the Kremlin's tactics to liquidate Tito by means short of direct military action. The Embassy hazards the guess that this latest Soviet action reflects both the Cominform's failure to goad Tito into taking the Initiative in breaking relations with the 'USSR and the Kremlin's anger over Belgrade's forceful accusations following the Rajk trial in Hungary.
