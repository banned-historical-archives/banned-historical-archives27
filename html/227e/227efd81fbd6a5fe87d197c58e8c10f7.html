 EUROPEAN  SECURITY  CONFERE',I'~CE
 BREZHNEV SPEECH MODERATE ON MOST CONTROVERSIAL !SSUES
 The speech by CPSU General Secretary Leonid Brez' en.ev at the 31 July
 session of the Helsinki summit of the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe was moderate and concilia.L:ory in tone.  Although
 Brezhnev reiterated standard Soviet positions c,a the major contro-
 versial issues, he avoided any show of arrogamcc, stressing instead
 the themes of "consensus" and "compromise" in "Ais characterization
 of the conference agreements.  In his one. Rta'ca:ment that carried
 an abrasive edge, his warning against interference: in Soviet
 internal affairs, Brezhnev did not go beyond .he positions that
 have been repeatedly set forth in the media .clr many months.
 Soviet and East European media have made a b.g play over Brezhnev's
 call for turning political detente into military detente.   But in
 fact--aside from expressing general interest in continuing to pursue
 military detente--the Soviet leader offered no new initiatives in
 his indirect references to the Vienna force reduction talks and
 the strategic arms limitation talks in Geneva.   He said only that
 "oite of the first priority objectives is to find ways to reduce
 armed forces and armaments in central Europe without diminishing
 the security of anyone," and "uppermost in our minds is the task
 of ending the arms race and achieving tangible results in disarma-
 ment."
 Brezhnev said the Soviet Union   viewed the outcome of the 'onference
 "not merely as a necessary summing up of. the political results of
 World War II," but as an "insight into the future in terms of the
 realities of today," a carefully drafted phrase which sidestepped
 the concept of "inviolability of borders."  Pre-summit Soviet comment
 had stressed this pr'.nciple, but Brezhnev in avoiding it seemed
 to take cognizance of Western criticism that the USSR's prime
 concern with CSCE was in nailing down Western recognition of
 World War II borders.
 While Soviet comment in the past tended to ignore the agreements on
 cooperation in the humanitarian field, Brezhnev referred to
 exchanges of information in both a conciliatory and cautionary
 fashion.  He spoke of possibilities of cooperation in areas "where
 It was unthinkable in the years of the cold war," as in "broader
 ?            exchanges of information in the interests of peace and friendship."
 But he also called it "no secret" that information media "can
 serve the purpose of peace and confidence or they can spread all
 over the world the poison of discord," and he expressed the hope
 that the conference results would serve as a "correct guideline"

 for cooperation in this field.                  Soviet concern for this matter
 was similarly  stressed by IZVESTIYA observer Mikhail Mikhaylov
 on Moscow Radio's international observers roundtable on 3 August:
 "Those information media which serve the goals of peace and trust"
 should be "encouraged," but those "who sow dissension  between
 countries and peoples" should "be administered a rebuff," he
 warned.
 Emphasizing the security aspects of the agreement, the Soviet
 leader stated that the "main conclusion" of the conference was
 that "no one should try, on the basis of foreign policy considera-
 tions of one kind or another, to dictate to other peoples how they
 should manage their own internal affairs."  It is only the people
 of each given state, and "no one else," he said, who "have the
 sovereign right to decide the:'.r own internal affairs and establish
 their own internal laws."  Mikhaylov, on the observers roundtable
 program, spelled out one of the implications:   The interests of
 detente would be better served, he said, by developing "mutually
 beneficial trade that is free from all discrimination," rather
 than by "fruitless attempts" to '.'intervene in internal affairs."
 Brezhnev stated that the principles drawn up by the conference
 participants had to be put to practical use and "made a law
 of international life which is not to be breached by anyone."   In
 effect responding to Western views that the CSCE document had
 no binding application in law, an article by SOVIET RUSSIA
 correspondent Viktor Soldatov, as reported by TASS on 1 August,
 referred to unidentified "pronouncements" that the conference
 document had "no juridical nature" and was "merely a declaration
 of intentions which is not binding on anyone."  These "skeptics"
 should be reminded, Soldatov said, that all states have jointly
 worked up the final document and will sign it at the summit level.
 "This will impart to it the nature of a solemn pledge," he declared.
 TREATMENT OF      Moscow's voluminous attention to the Helsinki
 FORD SPEECH       summit revolved around Brezhnev as the central
 figure, with the other leaders accorded due
 courtesy by way of publication of versions of their speeches in
 PRAVDA,  Moscow radio broadcast short summaries of President
 Ford's speech in several foreign--chiefly Asian--languages, but
 Moscow's domestic service reported only that the President had
 addressed the conference, giving no details.
 Excerpts of the President's speech--approximately a third of the
 full text--appeared on page 7 of the 2 August issue of PRAVDA.
 The PRAVDA account deleted his remarks relating to the basic
 principles upon which the United Statee was founded, as well as
 his comments, in addressing the countries of the East, that they

 should recognize American devotion to human rights and freedoms
 and thus to the conference pledges regarding freer movement of
 people, ideas and information.  PRAVDA included his observations
 on the substantial achievements of recent years, but omitted, at
 the and of that passage, his remarks that "detente can succeed
 only if everybody understands what detente actually is," and that
 success of the detente process "depends on new behavior patterns."
 The President's comments on MBFR, SALT, and non-proliferation were
 reproduced in full.  But PRAVDA excised, from his remarks on the
 "special significance" of Berlin, the observation that the CSCE
 results "apply to Berlin as they do throughout Europe."  Nor did
 PRAVDA include his cautionary statement that "crises must not be
 manipulated or exploited for unilateral advantages that could lead
 us again to the brink of war," and his further admonition that
 "the process of negotiation must be sustained, not at a snail's
 pace, but with demonstrated enthusiasm and visible progress."
 EAST EUROPE HAILS HELSINKI RESULTS, CAUTIOUS ON FREER ACCESS
 With the expected qualifications from Bucharest and Belgrade, the
 public assessments of the CSCE emanating front Moscow's East
 European allies have been uniformly lyrical.  The orthodox party
 leaders' Helsinki speeches and followup media comment echoed
 Brezhnev's conference speech in stressing that the CSCE was a major
 achievement of peaceful coexistence, that it enhanced prospects for
 converting political detente into military detente, and that there
 were no victors or vanquished but only equal participants in the
 conference.  In stressing equality and welcoming the participation
 of the non-European countries--the United States and Canada--the
 East European leaders took pains at the same time to note that
 the conference had been convened on the initiative of the Soviet
 Union and the other socialist countries.  The party dailies of
 the USSR, East Germany,and Romania published the full text of the
 final conference document, while those of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
 Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia carried abridged versions.
 Yugoslavia's Tito and Romania's Ceausescu registered qualified
 praise for the conference in their Helsinki speeches, both leaders
 manifesting caution on the freer access issue and Ceausescu describ-
 ing as inadequate the final document's pr:;visions for advance noti-
 fication of troop movements and maneuvers.   The Albanian daily
 BASHKIMI on the 2d portrayed as hypocritical Brezhnev's condeanation
 of foreign dictation of a country's internal affairs.
 The orthodox East European leaders emulated Brezhnev' in softpedaling
 Western acceptance of the post-Wurld War II borders, generally

 approaching this issue indirectly by warning against any repetition
 of territorial conflict in Europe.  There were varying degrees
 of toughness manifested on the issue of more open borders and
 freer exchange of people and information.   In the most inflexible
 stance on the access issue, the GDR's Honecker stressed that
 Europe's past troubles had stemmed from disregard for sovereignty
 and inviolability of borders and that the latter principle was the
 chief criterion in judging present-day policies of cooperation,
 declaring in this context that "security is the stable basis for
 cooperation."  Bulgaria's Zhivkov warned that his country's "gates
 will be open for all people with . . . good and honest intentions
 who are observing the laws, traditions and customs of the house
 they are visiting."  Czechoslovakia's Husak, sensitive to the airing
 in the West of the views of "Prague Spring" liberals, asserted that
 freer exchanges must not be utilized for purposes of propaganda
 a-d hate.   In more restrained terms, Hungary's Kadar noted that
 progress in the area of exchanged was possible only with mutual
 respect for sovereignty and laws, and Poland's Gierek called for
 "deepening mutual confidence" in implementing the conference's
 decisions on contacts, in order to avoid repetition of the
 "tragedies" of the past
 In followup comment, Warsaw's TRYBUNA LUDU on 2 August declared
 that "Europe has found a common language" and predicted that the
 Ford-Brezhnev meeting scheduled for that day would have "positive
 repercussions" on the SALT and MBFR negotiations.  On the negative
 side, the Warsaw military daily ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI of the same day
 complained that Radio Free Europe, located on West German territory
 and financed by American funds, was carrying commentaries on the
 CSCE which "blatantly" contradicted the official U.S. and FRG
 positions in support of the conference.   Similarly, the editorial
 in Prague's RUDE PRAVO on the 2d combined praise for the
 conference with a denunciation of alleged efforts by the press "in
 certain Westein cr:.ntries" to demean and distort the meeting's
 results and to turn the clock back to the days of the cold war.
 The East Germans' tough stance was sustained in the 4 August
 NEUES DEUTSCHLAND editorial, which cautioned that the term
 "peaceful coexistence" connoted differing social systems, "that
 is, a state of antagonism which cannot be done awry with merely
 by good will."  The editorial echoed Brezhnev's Helsinki speech
 in declaring that "no one should try .  .  . to dictate to other
 peoples how they should manage their internal affairs."  In nit
 interview in the same paper on the 6th, Honecker underscored the
 impossibility of international cooperation without strict
 observance of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and inviolability
 of borders.

 ROMANIA, YUGOSLAVIA     Romanian party-state leader Ceausescu
 assessed the security conference positively
 but asserted that it fell short of Bucharest's expectations. In
 particular, he termed the final document's provisions for advance
 notification of maneuvers and troop movements "insufficient," though
 a positive step, and he reiterated Bucharest's longstanding demand that
 a permanent body be established to monitor compliance with the
 final document.    Ceausescu also reaffirmed his position that genuine
 European security requires abolition of blocs, removal. of bases and
 troops from foreign territories, and disarmament.
 Ceausescu's expected emphasis on independence and sovereignty
 included a stingirg condemnation of the use of cultural exchanges
 and information media to encourage "racism, war propaganda and
 hatemongering."  Specifically, he denounced the "misinformation
 activities" of radio stations "on the territories of some states
 participating in the current conference"-- an apparent reference
 to RFE and Radio Liberty.   Ceausescu strongly defended Romania's
 political system under communist rule and asserted that "the
 democracy that is being achieved in Romania is superior, by far,
 to the democracy referred to by certain previous speakers."
 President Tito used the occasion of the security conference summit
 to issue a direct appeal for a hands-off policy on Yugoslavia.
 Reaffirming Belgrade's nonalined position, he asked for "unconditional
 respect for the sovereignty and integrity" of Yugoslavia.   In comment-
 ing on Yugoslavia's relations with its neighbors, Tito also stressed
 the "binding" nature of the principle of the inviolability of borders.
 His generally hopeful assessment of the security conference may well
 have been influenced by his talks with leaders of neighboring states.
 Reflecting some improvement in Belgrade's continuing difficulties
 with Bulgaria, a communique on Tito's 30 July talks with Zhivkov,
 the first since 1967, indicated that their exchange had been "frank
 and friendly" and that they had agreed on measures to intensify
 cooperation.   Tito also met with Austria's Kreisky, who afterwards
 forecast improved relations between the two countries.
 In contrast to the other East European leaders, Tito expressed a
 reserved attitude regarding the implications of the CSCE beyond
 the European continent.   Emphasizing the interdependence of Europe
 with the rest of the world, Tito stressed that detente must not be
 limited to "agreem.ent-seeking" between the big powers or the blocs.
 He asserted that many international crises--which exert pressures
 on nonalined countries--continue to exist, a situation which"gives
 rise to suspicion regarding the aims and even the past accomplish-
 ments of detente."

 PEKING SAYS CSCE ENCOURAGES GREATER SUPERPOWER RIVALRY
 Peking has issued an unusually heavy stream of critical comment
 and reportage on the Helsinki resolutions, characterizing them
 as ambiguous and self-contradictory documents which allow each
 superpower to make its own interpretations, thus providing a
 structure for increased competition in Europe.   Peking has aimed
 the brunt of its criticism at the USSR for "hawking the 'detente'
 trash," while it has depicted the United States as remaining
 vigilant against Soviet expansion.
 Peking's treatment is consistent with its recent propaganda
 line, which has held that the superpower rivalry in Europe has
 reached a "new stage," despite outward signs of East-West relaxa-
 tion, and that the United States has shifted in attention to
 Soviet inroads in Europe following U.S. setbacks in Indochina.
 Peking has focused on recent remarks by President Ford as evidence
 that Washington intends to use the CSCE framework to enhance its
 position in Europe against the USSR.   NCNA coverage of President
 Ford's visits to Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia, transmitted on
 29 July,  3 August and 4 August respectively, played up the
 developing relations between East Europe and the United States.
 A 1 August NCNA report gave special stress to signs of U.S.-Soviet
 tensions outside the formal Helsinki summit meetings, portraying
 the Ford-Brezhnev talks of 30 July and 2 August on SALT, MBFR,
 the Middle East and Portugal as part of the two powers' continued
 "rl.otting against each other."   Separate meetings by President Ford
 and Brezhnev with West European leaders and their contacts with
 the Turkish prime minister were also seen as efforts by both powers
 to compete for European influence.   To underline its case for U.S.-
 Soviet rivalry, NCNA even wl!nt so far as to misquote Secretary
 Kissinger's remarks regarding the Soviet role in Portugal at a
 30 July press conference in Helsinki.
 NCNA stated that Kissinger said "detente must not be used by the
 Soviet Union to intervene in the troubles on our side of the line.
 Activities by any country in Portugal will be considered as contrary
 to the letter and the spirit of the principles of the CSCE."  In
 fact, Kissinger's statement was much less  peremptory in tone.   He
 said: ".  .  . I think we should keep in mind that detente cannot
 be used as a means of asking the Soviet Union to take care of
 all our problems on our side of the line, and a correct analysis
 of the situation in Portugal should emphasize or will emphasize
 that many of the problems in Portugal have indigenous roots and
 others have to do with Western countries, but I repeat what I
 have said previously that a substantial activity of any outside

 country in Portugal would be considered inconsistent with the
 spirit and indeed the letter of the CSCE declaration."
 The article also reported remarks by President Ford and other
 Western leaders defending their interests against alleged Soviet
 efforts to use the CSCE to demoralize and divide the Western
 alliance.  It played up President Ford's statements affirming
 a continuing U.S. commitment to NATO, his rejecting of the notion
 that the CSCE represents a de facto recognition of Soviet dominance
 in East Europe, and his expressed determination to continue an active
 U.S..policy throughout the continent.   The report went on to cite
 FRG Chancellor Schmidt's position on peaceful change of borders
 and desire for a reunified C-rmany as a challenge to Soviet ambitions
 at the conference, hUghlighted French President Giscard's warning
 on the continuing need for a strong Western defense despite the
 CSCE, and made a rare favorable reference to British Prime Minister
 Wilson in noting his defense of continued Four Power rights and
 responsibilities concerning Berlin and Germany.
 Appr
 A 2 August NCNA report focused on remarks by President Ford and other
 U.S. officials on key CSCE issues such as the inviolability of frontiers,
 prior notification for military exercises, free exchange of people
 and ideas, and economic and technical cooperation, presenting them
 as diametrically opposed to Brezhnev's interpretations on the same
 issues.  The report claimed the remarks  are further proof that
 the CSCE declaration is "an empty document" that serves only "the
 needs of the Soviet Union and the United States in their contention
 for hegemony in Europe."  Another 2 August NCNA report pegged to
 the CSCE favorably noted that U.S. disengagement from Indochina
 had allowed U.S. leaders to "shorten their battle fronts" and had
 prompted Washington "to take one measure after another'to turn its
 greater attention back to Europe."  It cited remarks by President
 Ford and Secretaries Kissinger and Schlesinger at NATO meetings
 this spring as evidence that Washington has "minced no words by
 saying that global strategic readjustment was being carried out
 by the United States with a view to protecting Europe and stepping
 up U.S. contention with the Soviet Union in Europe and its flanks."

 DRV IGNORES FORD MEETINGS WITH BREZHNEV, EAST EUROPEAN LEADERS
 Reflecting longstanding Vietnamese misgivings about Soviet-U.S.
 policies of detente, monitored Hanoi media have failed even to
 mention President Ford's meetings with Brezhnev in Helsinki and
 his visits to Eastern Europe.   The only known radio reports on
 the President's European trip were brief news items on 29 July
 on his  stopover  in the FRG.   The radio noted, in a Vietnamese-
 language broadcast, that the President was en route to the
 Conference on European Security and Cooperation which was to be
 held in Helsinki, but provided no further information on the
 conference.   It charged that a statement by Ford in the FRG on
 U.S. commitments "interfered in West Berlin's internal affairs"
 and was "an insolent challenge to the people of the GDR and
 world public opinion."
 Hanoi media had not completely ignored other recent U.S.-Soviet
 meetings but instead had cryptically reported President Ford's
 talks with Brezhnev in Vladivostok in November last year, Nixon's
 visit to Moscow in June-July 1974, and Brezhnev's June 1973 visit
 to the United States.   Prior to the signing of the January 1973
 peace agreement North Vietnam did not directly mention U.S.
 summits with Moscow and Peking and openly indicated opposition
 to , such. meetings in principle.   Thus, Hanoi media did not carry
 reports of President Nixon's 1972 trips to Peking and Moscow but
 media comment was openly critical of policies of accommodation
 with the United States and reflected Hanoi's concern that
 Vietnamese interests might be sacrificed by its allies in the
 interest of detente.

 U,S,-SOVIET  RELATIONS
 MOSCOW NOTES SALT PROGRESS IN FORD-BREZHNEV TALKS
 Against a background of broad coverage and lavish praise for the
 CSCE summit in Helsinki, Moscow's attention to the 30 July and
 2 August meetings between President Ford and General Secretary
 Brezhnev was strictly low-key.  Brief TASS and domestic radio
 reports treated them without fanfare as working meetings, stressed
 the good atmosphere during the talks and noted that SALT was the
 key issue.  Soviet reporting on the second meeting conveyed a
 distinct impression of progress on SALT during the discussions.
 Soviet media commentary on SALT continues to project confidence
 that the remaining obstacles in the talks are not sufficient to
 place a fall signing in jeopardy.
 A recording of Brezhnev's session with she news media after the
 30 July meeting, carried on Moscow domestic radio, included his
 statement that "strategic armaments and a new agreement were the
 central issues of our discussions."  The TASS report of the
 2 August meeting said that issues "on which agreement was reached
 during the talks" will be turned over to the delegations in
 Geneva, while negotiations on "remaining problems" will continue.
 TROFIMENKO ARTICLE      An article by G.A. Trofimenko in the
 27 July SOVTSKAYA ESTONIYA said that "as
 far as can be judged there are no insuperable obstacles now" :o
 insuring that the Vladivostok accord "is embodied in a specific
 agreement by the end of the year."  Though Trofimenko's primary
 purpose in the article was to criticize a series of recent state-
 ments on U.S.-Soviet strategic relations made by Secretary of
 Defense Schlesinger, especially Schlesinger's reported view that
 increased U.S. military strength is not only compatible with
 detente but reinforces it, he did not suggest directly that the
 course of the SALT negotiations had been adversely affected thereby.*
 Trofimenko also blamed the Pentagon for some of the problems that
 have delayed the process of negotiating a SALT TWO agreement.  He
 said that to secure the Pentagon's approval of the terms of the
 *  Defense Minister Grechko and other Soviet military spokesmen
 have made similar claims on behalf of Soviet military might, while
 a number of USA Institute analysts have argued that military
 strength alone could not insure peace.  See the TRENDS SUPPLEMENT
 of 23 August 1973, "Soviet Debate Over the Role of Military Power
 During Detente," and the TRENDS of 24 July 1974, p 11.

 SALT I agreement, tie U.S. Administration had to agree to new
 strategic weapon programs, including the B-1 bomber and the
 Trident SSBN.  According to Trofimenko, the  go-ahead for such an
 "extensive, longterm development program" had "complicated the
 elaboration" of a followon agreement.  Soviet cormnentary on
 SALT TWO has generally avoided apportioning blame for the pro-
 longation of the negotiations, pointing instead to the understandably
 more complex issues now involved.   However, another USA Institute
 observer,M.A. Mil'shteyn, implied that Watergate had also slowed

 U.S. - EAST  E UROPE  RELATIONS
 ROMANIA. YUGOSLAVIA VOICE SATISFACTION WITH FORD VISITS
 Romanian and Yugoslav media treatment of President Ford's visits
 on 2-3 and 3-4 August, respectively, has been warm on atmospherics
 but non-specific as to the details of the discussions.  Romanian
 media have thus far refrained from commenting on President Ford's
 offer of flood relief, although the fact that an offer was made
 was noted in the communique published in the 4 August ROMANIA
 LIBERA.  Similarly, Yugoslav media have avoided mentioning that
 military cooperation was discussed between President Ford and
 Tito aside front a TANJUG text of the President's 4 August state-
 ment in which he referred to this discussion.
 Romanian media had provided warm atmospherics for the President's
 arrival with commentaries welcoming Congressional approval on
 28 July of the long-awaited most-favored-nation status.  The party
 daily SCINTEIA on the 29th typically characterized MvN approval
 as removing a major obstacle to the "overall d--velopment of
 friendly" U.S.-Romanian relations.   Ceausescu also underscored
 the significance of MFN in acknowledging in a 2 August toast that
 Romania "will reap great benefits" although he cautioned Romanian
 citizens that thc.i.r products "must now demonstrate their technical,
 economic and qualitative competitiveness."
 Ceausescu, who assessed his talks with the President as "particu-
 larly positive" and called for even closer cooperation, showed
 concern for Moscow's sensitivities in asserting twice during his
 2 August toast that there is no longer anything "Special" about a
 U.S. Presidential visit to Romania.   He had similarly taken care
 to point up Bucharest's "good" relations with Moscow during
 Kissinger's November 1974 visit.
 YUGOSLAV VISIT      Belgrade comment surrounding the President's
 visit to Yugoslavia portrayed bilateral rela-
 tions between the two countries in glowing terms, but voiced
 concern over continued anti-Tito activities of emigres in the
 United States.   A TANJUG report on the President's 4 August talks
 with Premier Bijedic pointed out that "note was made" of the need
 to prevent such activities.
 Tito voiced "great" satisfaction with the results of his talks
 with the President, particularly regarding the Administracion's
 views on the international economic situation.  Speaking at a
 joint news conference on the 4th, Tito asserted that following
 his talks with the President and Secretary Kissinger, he expected

 that the discussion of international economic problems at next
 month's special session of the UN Gecieral Assembly would achieve
 positive results.
 In discussing other international problems, Tito voiced "particular
 concern" over the Mideast and Cyprus in view of the potential
 danger they posed for the entire Mediterranean.   He also criticized
 the "inflexibility" of Israel on several occasions.   Contrary to
 Western press reports, Tito did not assert that Yugoslavia and
 the United States shared identical views on the Mideast.  Speaking
 at the 4 August press conference, however, he noted the identity
 of U.S. and Yuroslav views re'arding "auxiety" over the Mideast
 situation.

 SINO-SOVIET  RELATIONS
 PEKING PRESSES CHARGES AGAINST SOVIET ASIAN SECURITY PLAN
 Recent Chinese commentaries in PEOPLE'S DAILY and NCNA have alleged
 that the Soviet Union is exploiting the momentum of the conclusion
 of the European Security Conference and the U.S. military pullback
 from Asia following the end of the Indochina war to press its
 :Longstanding proposal for an Asian collective security arrangement.*
 NCNA commentaries on 29 and 31 Jul;  asserted for the first time
 that the Soviet Union was attempting to link its scheme with the
 proposal for neutralization of Southeast Asia sponsored by the
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and with Nepal's
 call for a "zone of peace."  Other Peking comment has advised
 Asian nations that they have more to fear from Soviet expansionism
 than from a continuing U.S. military presence in their countries.
 The 29 July NCNA commentary noted Lhat "of late" Soviet officials
 have been pushing Asian collective security as part of a "new
 move" in the wake of the CSCE and the Indochina war to displace
 U.S. influence and establish Soviet hegemony in Asia.   To support
 its warnings, NCNA pointed to Moscow's growing naval presence in
 ,Southeast Asian waters, its longstanding opposition to ASEAN states'
 claims of jurisdiction over the Malacca Straits, and past Soviet
 statements opposing the ASEAN neutralization scheme.   It also noted
 allegedly growing Soviet espionage activities and promotion of
 pro-Soviet political forces in Southeast Asia as further evidence
 that Moscow has altered its stance on neutralization merely to woo
 ASEAN states into the Soviet "orbit."
 The 31 July NCNA report sounded a related theme, criticizing Soviet
 efforts to link its security plan with Nepal's call for a "zone of
 pea'-e."  The report cited an editorial in a Nepalese weekly which
 said that the proposal is motivated by the Soviet ambition to make
 Asians fight among themselves and to expand its own sphere of
 influence," a criticism strongly reminiscent of charges formerly
 aimed at the "Nixon Doctrine."
 Other recent NCNA reports have supported the ASEAN solidarity efforts
 as cc:zducive to keeping the area free from superpower control.  For
 ins:nnce, NCNA reports on 25 and 28 July reported evidence of greater

 regional cooperation, during Thai Prime Minister Khukrit's recent
 visits to the Philippines and Singapore, noting especially the
 growing harmony of foreign and economic policies among the ASEAN
 states?  And an NCNA raport on 29 July explicitly portrayed ASEAN
 cooperation as an exemplary means to secure regional independence
 from outside interference.
 U.S. RULE      In contrast to its sharpened attack on the Soviet
 ..ecu,:ity plan and military presence, Peking has
 portrayed U.S. influence in Asia as a Yelative source of stability
 and has depicted some recent U.S. military moves there as under-
 standable responses on. the part of a great power to the -unbridled
 expansion of its adversary.  For instance, NCNA on 30 July
 reported without criticism the U.S. Congress' 28 July approval of
 President Ford's plan to expand the U.S. military base on Diego
 Garcia, depicting the U.S. action as a reaction to Soviet military
 moves which NCNA described as the main source of insecurity and
 threat to the region.
 A 28 July article by prominent PEOPLE'S DAILY foreign affairs
 commentator Fan Hsiu-chiu went so far as to rebuke Soviet
 propaganda efforts pressing for U.S. military withdrawal from
 Asia as attempts to clear the way for Moscow's Asian security
 plan.  Warning of Moscow's Asian ambitions, the article referred
 to Soviet military bases in Mongolia, on Japanese-claimed islands,
 and in the Indian Ocean region, noting bluntly that the USSR
 "is attempting to take advantage of the Asian people's tendency
 to demand the dismantling of U.S. military bases as a means
 of secretly sneaking into some Asian areas to seek new bases and
 spheres of influence."  NCNA on the 29th showed similar forbearance
 toward the U.S. presence in advising Asians that they were better
 off facing a U.S. military presence than confronting ambitious
 Soviet "expansionism."  Following the recent U.S. "strategic
 readjustment" in Asia, the article stated, the USSR, "like a
 hungry tiger hiding for a long time and now coming out, is more
 ferocious than the decaying U.S. imperialism."

 KOREA
 DPRI< REGISTERS FORMAL OPPOSITION TO ROK UN MEMBERSHIP
 A 5 August DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement responded
 to South Korea's 30 July application for UN membership by charging
 that the ROK is not qualified for membership as a puppet regime
 and because its participation in the Vietnam War morally disqualifies
 it under terms of the UN Charter.  The argument that the Seoul
 government is a U.S. "marionette regime devoid of an;r independence"
 and therefore ineligible for UN membership has been standard in
 DPRK propaganda, but the charge that the South's UN membership
 would "eventually impair the principle and idea of the UN Charter"
 is new.   Pyongyang has not previously argued that the South's
 international behavior, such as in Vietnam, should bar it from UN
 membership.*  The charge that UN membership for the ROK would be an
 "open violation of the UN Charter" was also made by a DPRK Foreign
 Ministry official in a 5 August news conference reported by KCNA
 on the 6th.
 The Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement had also claimed the
 ROK application was an "open violation" of the decision of the
 28t'a UN General Assembly encouraging North and South Korea to
 work toward reunification, as well as a product of the "two Koreas
 plot" of the United States.   Repeating a standard North Korean
 line dating; from a June 1973 Kim 1.1-song speech, the statement
 urged that Korea enter the UN as a unified country, or as a single
 entity under the name of the Confederal Republic of Koryo after
 a north-south confederation has been established.
 she Foreign, Ministry spokesman's statement did not tie the ROK
 application. for UN membership to an attempt to keep U.S. troops
 in South Korea, but accompanying commentary has done so.  According
 to a 4 August KCNA report, a MINJU CHOSEN commentary, for example,
 argued that by applying for admission, Seoul intended to hamper
 a solution to the "basic question" of withdrawal of U.S. troops
 from the South.  The same commentary also suggested that the United
 States recommended South Korea apply as a "condition for bargaining
 over the application of North and South Vietnam for separate adiris-
 sion," the first time DPRK media have raised this issue and an
 indication of Pyongyang's concern that the admission of the two
 Vietnams could become tied to the issue of Korean membership in
 the United Nations.-
 --September 1973 DPRK government memorandum for the 28th UN
 General Assembly cited ROK actions in Vietnam as an example of Seoul's
 "morally 'e.gradec.i and corrupt" nature, but not as a threat to the
 UN Charte,..

 INDOCHINA
 CAMBODIA NOTES LE DUAN VISIT, DISCUSSES FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES
 A terse "press conmiunique" broadcast by Phnom Penh radio on
 3 August announcing the recent visit to Cambodia of a Vietnam Workers
 Party delegation led by First Secretary  Le Duan suggests that
 relations between the two countries remain strained.  While North
 Vietnam is the first nation to publicly send a delegation to
 Cambodia since the communist victory last April, the reserved
 description of the meeting in the communique was in co,,.itrast to
 communiques issued after previous Vietnamese-Cambodian meetings.
 And just one day after the announcement of the latest visit,
 Phnom Penh radio reported the construction of Cambodian military
 fortifications on islands in the Gulf of Siam which had been held
 by the South Vietnamese Government prior to the communist takeover
 in Vietnam.   Phnom Penh radio in recent days has broken new
 ground on other foreign policy issues, for the first time referring
 to postwar aid from China and favorably noting Bangkok's interest
 in normalizing relations with Cambodia.
 LE DEAN VISI7      Pernaps in deference to Cambodian reticence
 since the communist takeover to publicize
 information on the structure of its postwar leadership, the
 communique on the Le Duan visit did not indicate when or where in
 Cambodia the visit took place or what Cambodian leaders took part
 in talks with the Vietnamese.   Members of the Vietnamese delega-
 tion, other than Le Duan, were similarly not specified.   Hanoi's
 report on the visit, carried by VNA on the 3d, was identical to
 the Phnom Penh radio press communique, although not labeled a
 communique.   An editorial on the visit in the North Vietnamese
 party paper NHAN DAN on the same day provided no additional
 details.
 By contrast, prior to the end of the Indochina war,  Cambodian
 and Vietnamese media had given extensive media coverage to visits
 between delegations from the two nations, with the standard
 lengthy banquet speeches, editorial comment, and joint statements
 of policy.*  The fact that Le Duan headed the Vietnamese delegation

 is consistent with past Vietnamese Practice.   Following the Paris
 peace agreement, the first secretary similarly led delegations to
 Hanoi's major communist allies--to Peking in June 1973 and to
 Moscow the following month--and he headed a delegation to Laos in.
 November 1973, his last publicized trip abroad.
 Consistent with the publicized results of past Vietnamese-Cambodian
 meetings, the communique on the visit said that ur,aniwtty was
 reached on all questions raised during the visit.  The NHAN DAN
 editorial noted, as the paper had following earlier Vietnamese-
 Cambodian meetings, that "good results" had been achieved during
 the visit.   However, the description of the atmosphere surrounding
 the visit was less effusive than during past visits.  Thus,
 whereas the joint communique. on PRG President Phat's December 1974
 talks with Khieu Samphan had said the meetings had been conducted
 in an atmosphere of "the most cordial and warmest friendship and
 with militant solidarity," Le Duan reportedly had "cordial
 conversations in an atmosphere of brotherhood" during his recent
 visit.   The joint communique on Khieu Samphan's April 1974 visit
 to Hanoi said his visit had been "crowned with success and greatly
 contributed to the strengthening and consolidation of the militant
 solidarity and great friendship" between the two countries and had
 translated "in a brilliant way the profound sentiments of combative
 solidarity and indestructible fraternal friendship" that binds the
 two peoples.  By contrast, Le Duan's current visit was said merely
 to have "further strengthened the longstanding bonds of militant
 solidarity and friendship" between Vietnam and Cambodia.
 BORDER ISLANDS      On 4 August Phnom Penh radio reported that
 Cambodian forces had occupied and fortified Koh
 Tunsay and Koh Puo islands in the Gulf of Siam near South Vietnam
 "at a time when the U.S. imperialists and their Thieu puppet clique
 were immediately swept from our territory."  The report was the
 first specific Phnom Penh reference to military occupation of
 islands also claimed by South Vietnam since the height of the
 Mayaguez incident last May.  At that time, Phnom Penh radio had
 referred several times to military measures being carried out on
 islands also claimed by the South Vietnamese noting, for instance,
 in an 18 May broadcast that Cambodian maritime forces on Koh Wai
 Island were to be r_ongratulatef for their heroism against the
 United States.  The radio's only other recent reference to
 Cambodian military action on adjacent islands was contained in a
 25 July Phnom Penh radio report noting that people on Rong Sanlem
 Island--which is situated off Sihanoukville--and "other islands
 of our territorial sea" were "always carrying weapons" to "protect
 their revolutionary administration."

 PRC AID      Phnom Penh radio's acknowledgment of continuing Chinese
 aid was contained in a 3 August report of a 1 August
 greetings message sent by Khieu Samphan to PRC Defense Minister
 Yeh Chien-ying on China's Army Day.  The message cited the
 "longstanding and radiant bonds of militant solidarity and fraternal
 friendship" between Cambodia and China and noted that Cambodia
 continues to receive Chinese "support and assistance" in the
 "new phase" of the Cambodian revolution since liberation.  This
 is the first time since the communist takeover that Phnom Penh
 radio has carried the text of a Cambodian leader's message to any
 foreign country, and it is also the first time that the radio has
 carried a statement signed by Khiau Samphan since it broadcast the
 28 April special national congress communique.
 THAILAND     In a weekly radio international news feature on
 27 July, Phnom Penh publicly welcomed Thai Prime
 Minister Khukrit's recent statement that Thailand hoped to
 normalize relations with Cambodia.  The radio commented that
 "the best prospects ever" currently exist for "good relations"
 between the two states.   Maintaining that Cambodia and Thailand
 have "a long tradition of peaceful coexistence and friendly
 relations," the radio placed Thailand in the same category with
 Vietnam and Laos as "brotherly peoples" with whom Cambodia seeks
 to coexist.   The same radio feature on 3 August for the first
 time favorably reported the policies of other noncommunist
 neighbors, attributing statements critical of SEATO to Malaysian
 Prime Minister Razak and "the governments" of Australia and New
 Zealand.

 HANOI MEDIA STEP UP CRITICISM OF BANGKOK POLICY TOWARD U.S.
 Hanoi media have released a barrage of criticism of Bangkok in the
 past month, abandoning the restraint which had characte_ized public
 Vietnamese statements on Thailand following DRV-Thai talks on
 normalization of relations, held in Bangkok from 21 to 29 May.
 Hanoi's criticism, in both media comment and official Foreign
 Ministry spokesmen's statements, has centered on the Thai Government's
 alleged "collusion" with the United States and has questioned the
 sincerity of Thai Government statements advocating friendly
 relations with neighboring countries.
 The recent Hanoi comment hag not mentioned the DRV-Thai consulta-
 tions which were to have continued in Hanoi following the opening
 round in. Bangkok, and there has thus been no public acknowledgment
 of Thai press reports in mid-July that the Hanoi talks had been
 put off until the end of August.   The timing of the Vietnamese
 campaign against Bangkok, beginning shortly after Thai Prime
 Minister Khukrit Pramot's 30 June-6 July visit to China, suggests
 that Hanoi may have concluded that with the establishment of
 PRC-Thai relations Bangkok had perhaps moderated its avowed
 intention to sever ties with the United States and advance toward
 rapprochement with Vietnam.  Hanoi media had reported without
 comment the establishment of formal relations between Peking and
 Bangkok during the Khukrit visit.
 COMMENT ON THAILAND      The first major outburst in Hanoi's
 SINCE MID-JULY           propaganda campaign against Bangkok came
 in commentaries in the North Vietnamese
 party paper NHAN DAN and the army paper QUAN DOI KHAN DAN on 19 and
 20 July, respectively.   These were apparently triggered by a
 Bangkok announcement that Thai naval units would participate in a
 SEATO exercise with American forces.  Hanoi's displeasure was
 registered officially on 22 July in a statement by the DRV Foreign
 Ministry spokesman which scored both the joint naval exercise and
 a recent statement attributed to Prime Minister Khukrit that SEATO
 should not be "dissolved" since it could still serve the member
 countries in various nonmilitary fields.
 The 19 and 20 July press commentaries and subsequent comment
 illustrated Hanoi's concern over Bangkok's continuing iomilitary ties
 with the United States.   NHAN DAN, for example,
 motives of the Thai leaders in participating in the scheduled naval
 exercise and asked rhetorically whether the maneuvers were intended
 to "intimidate" the Indochinese and Thai peoples, and whether
 Bangkok intended to pave the way for further U.S. military activities
 in the area.  The commentary denounced the joint exercise as a
 "serious provocation and hostile act by the Khukrit administration
 against the Vietnamese people."

 The 22 July Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, focusing on
 Khukrit's statement favoring the maintenance of SEATO, accused
 the Thai administration of "stubbornly trying to preserve" SEATO
 with the aim of "continuing to serve the U.S. imperialists in the
 interference in and aggression against the Southeast Asian
 countries."  North Vietnam appeared determined to continue
 pressure on the issue of Thai military cooperation with the United
 States, and this was underlined when Hanoi media failed to take
 note of Khukrit's less favorable stance on SEATO in the 24 July
 communique issued at the conclusion of his visit to the
 Philippines.  Both in the communique and at press conferences on
 the 24th and 25th Khukrit endorsed the principle that SEATO
 be gradually "phased out," but a 26 July Hanoi radio commentary
 ignored his statement on SEATO while criticizing other remarks
 Khukrit made at his press conferences.
 In the last week of July Hanoi issued two more official protests
 concerning Thailand--a Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on
 the 26th condemning the U.S. use of Thai bases for U-2 flights
 over Indochina and a spokesman's statement on the 31st endorsing
 a PRG note to Bangkok restating South Vietnam's claim to ships
 and planes taken to Thailand at the end of the war by evacuating
 South Vietnamese.  Like the earlier protest on the 22d, these
 statements linked their complaints to the question of improving
 relations with Bangkok.
 The 26 July statement charged that Thai permission for the U.S. to
 use Thai bases for its reconnaissance flights was proof that
 Thailand was "still pursuing the old policy of the dictatorial
 military regime already overthrown by the Thai people" and did
 not correspond to Thailand's "alleged desire" to have good
 relations with Indochinese countries.  The 31 July statement
 suggested that Thailand should "prove" the sincerity of its
 statements on good neighborly relations by returning the evacuated
 ships and planes and "renounce the former dictatorial regimes'
 policy of colluding with the United States to oppose the neighboring
 countries."  While Hanoi's official statement on the PRG note was
 in line with DRV practice in early May when it endorsed a number
 of PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman's statements on the disposition
 of the planes and ships in Thailand, it marked a departure from
 Hanoi's behavior immediately following the Thai-DRV talks in
 Bangkok.  When the PRG sent a note to Thailand on 30 May--the day
 after the Bangkok talks ended--demanding that Thailand return a
 South Vietnamese tugboat, Hanoi failed to provide its usual
 official statement of support.
 Press and radio comment accompanying the DRV spokesmen's protests
 to Thailand have raised other charges against the Bangkok government,

 including complaints that the Thais are cooperating with the
 United States in the construction of a large radar station in
 Chiangmai Province and that they are harboring "reactionaries"
 from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos who plan to carry out subversion
 in Indochina.  A 26 July QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article, from the
 "Current Affairs Review" column, not only reiterated Vietnamese
 objections to the continued presence of U.S. military forces in
 Thailand, but also expressed skepticism about whether Bangkok
 was seriously pursuing negotiations with the United States for
 the complete.withdrawal of those forces.
 BACKGROUND      Although Hanoi comment following the DRV-Thai
 talks at the end of May had avoided the harsh
 criticism of Bangkok expressed in recent weeks, North Vietnamese
 circumspection about the Thai leadership was apparent even then.
 Thus, for example, a 7 June article by NHAN DAN's authoritative
 "Commentator" noted that it was "entirely possible to resolve
 the remaining problems and normalize relations," but that the
 Thai Government must recognize the demands of the Thai people,
 "clearly realize the great changes in Southeast Asia," be
 determined to implement a policy of peace, independence, and
 "true" neutrality, and "definitely separate" from America's
 "neocolonialist policy."*
 Cautious Vietnamese optimism about Thai policies had been reflected
 in a 12 June article by NHAN DAN"s international news editor
 Quang Thai.  The article, reviewing the history of the independence
 struggle in Southeast Asia, had noted that the number of American
 troops in the area was "decreasing rapidly," that the last B-52's
 had left, that SEATO "exists in form only," and that the struggle
 movement in Thailand had developed over the last two years to
 the point where Washington had been "forced" to agree to a total
 withdrawal from Thailand.
 Hanoi's careful handling of its relations with Bangkok during
 June was suggested by a 19 June Hanoi radio report which
 vigorously denied Bangkok reports that North Vietnam was infiltrating
 weapons into Thailand.  The radio denounced the charge as a
 "fabrication" and complained that: the appearance of the allegations
 "prior to the forthcoming arrival in the DRV of a Thai delegation
 for more talks on the normalization of relations" was calculated to
 "poison the friendly atmosphere that prevailed after the first
 round of talks."  This was Hanoi's last known mention of  .he
 anticipated bilateral consultations in Hanoi.

 Thai talks are discussed in the TRENDS of 11 June 1975, pages 11-12.

 PORTUGAL
 USSR CRITICIZES "WESTERN MEDIA" INTERFERENCE, ATTACKS SOARES
 As the efforts to form a new government in Portugal have dragged
 on inconclusively, Moscow has continued to indicate support for
 the Armed Forces Movement (MFA) and Prime Minister Goncalves, but
 has indirectly expressed concern over the delay as "the political
 situation continues to deteriorate."  Western media have come in
 for criticism for spreading "fabrications" about Soviet interference
 while "crudely meddling" in Portugal's .ffairs themselves, and
 Moscow has repeated its contention that the Portuguese situation
 has no connection with detente.  And Socialist Party leader Soares
 has again been assailed in LITERARY GAZETTE for his "demagogic
 attacks" against the MICA, Goncalves, and the Portuguese Communist
 Party.
 WESTERN "MEDDLING"      Moscow has again lashed out at "Western
 media" for interference in Portugal's
 affairs, while brushing off "falsehoods" that the Soviet Union
 has been doing the same.   A Yuriy Shalygin commentary, broadcast
 in English to Asia on 24 July, dismissed as a "fabrication" the
 unidentified "claim that Moscow subsidizes the Portuguese
 communists."  Shalygin in turn accused Western media of going
 so far as to suggest what men should be in the Portuguese
 Government, and cited the Paris LE MONDE as indulging in "outright
 instigation," trying to "prod reactionary groups."  The Common
 Maiket came in for criticism as well,  Shalygin asserting that in
 denying aid to Portugal unless it kept to a pluralistic democracy,
 the EEC was also "doing some prodding."
 Maintaining the position that the Portuguese situation has nothing
 to do with detente,  IZVESTIYA observer V. Matveyev, in an inter-
 national review on 29 July, remarked that Western circles opposed
 to detente tried to portray the situation in Portugal
 "tendentiously," as "an 'example' of the kind of one-sided
 operation of the detente process from which, they say, the Soviet
 Union gains."  Matveyev complained that attempts were being made
 to depict the "complication of the domestic situation" in Portugal
 as having "some sort of relevance to the process of detente in
 Europe."
 Moscow has apparently not taken ndfe of Secretary Kissinger's
 remarks about Portugal in his 30 July press conference in
 Helsinki, when he said that "detente cannot be used as a means
 of asking the Soviet Union to take care of all of our problems
 on our side of the line," but added that "a substantial activity

 by any outside country in Portugal would be considered inconsistent
 with the spirit and indeed the letter of the CSCE declaration."
 Moscow has also passed over in silence President Ford's comment,
 in a U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT interview published on 4 August,
 that "I think it is undoubtedly recognized that the Soviet Union
 is quietly helping the communist elements in Portugal."
 ATTACK ON.SOARES     Following up its 11 June criticism of
 Socialist Party leader Mario Soares,*
 LITERARY GAZETTE on 30 .July carried a report by Soviet radio
 and television commentator I. Fesunenko portraying Soares as
 rallying "reactionary and counterrevolutionary forces" against
 the MFA, Prime Minister Goncalves and the Portuguese Communist
 Party (PCP). Fesunenko did concede that "it cannot be concluded
 that there are any links between the Socialists and the pogromists"
 attacking PCP centers around the country.  But he maintained that
 "the anticommunist hysteria unleashed by Mario Soares has served
 as the nutrient medium in which the bacilli of fascism have begun
 to multiply so rapidly."
 Fesunenko professed to see the situation as having "on the whole
 now been normalized" with the establishment of the ruling
 triumvirate and the announcement "soon" of the composition of
 the fifth provisional government.  But Moscow seemed to suggest
 some impatience over the delay in forming the government ylgn.
 TASS on 4 August reported PCP head Alvaro Cunha]. as declaring
 that "a new government should be formed as soon as possible",
 because the political situation in the country was deteriorating
 "as a result of delays with settlement of the government crisis."
 M..;cow as before has implied support for Prime Minister Goncalves,
 TASS on 31 July reporting that the Portuguese Revolutionary Council
 had "reaffirmed its confidence" in the way Gonsalves was discharg-
 ing his "difficult and responsible task."  And Oleg ;Skalkin, in a
 3 August PRAVDA article, also noted that the Council "expressed
 trust" in the prime minister, and that the Portuguese public
 supported the decision to create the executive triumvirate composed
 of Goncalves, President Costa Gomes, and security forces commander
 Otelo de Carvalho.  In PRAVDA on 31 July, V. Sedykh reported
 de Carvalho as saying the triumvirate arrangement "would make it
 possible to manage affairs in the country better."  Sedykh noted
 that de Carvalho stressed "the 'dynamic' nature" of the Portuguese

 CHINA
 LO JUI-CHING APPEARANCE HIGHLIGHTS PEKING ARMY DAY RECEPTION
 Repeating last year's Army Day performance, Peking this year again
 used the traditional Army Day eve reception on 31 July to mark the
 return to public life of a former top PLA leader, listing ex-PLA
 Chief of Staff Lo Jui-ching as "also present" in its 31 July NCNA
 reception report.  Last year, former Acting Chief of Staff Yang
 Cheng-wu,now first deputy chief of staff, reappeared on Army Day.
 The reception this year was attended by fewer top leaders than in
 1974, when Chou En-lai led the largest leadership turnout for Army
 Day since Lin Piao's fall in 1971.  This year's reception turnc.ut
 was led by Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying, whose toast co the
 PLA called on the army to deepen its study of Marxist theory on
 the dictatorship of the proletariat and to continue to grasp
 revolution and promote production.  Also present were PLA chief of
 staff Teng Hsiao-ping, head c,,f the PLA general political department
 Chang Chun-chiao, and seven other Politburo members or alternates.
 Vice Chairman Wang Hung-wen appeared in Shanghai according to a
 separate 31 July NCNA report on celebrations in Peking, Shanghai
 and Tientsin.  Wang was the only leader named in the report and
 was identified both as party vice chairman and vice chairman of
 the military commission, the first time he has been publicly
 identified in the latter post.* Wang had not appeared publicly in
 Shanghai, his power base before vaulting to the number three party
 post, since September 1973.
 For the thIra year in. sucesssion Army Day did not trigger a central
 flewspaper editorial.  Peking newspapers frontpaged a portrait of
 Mao and printed selected quotations from his works stressing the
 need for discipline and unity within the army.
 Lo Jui-ching, a major rival of Lin Piao, was the first major
 victim of the cultural revolution.  He was purged in 1965, when,
 in opposition to Lin, he appeared to favor a more active Chinese
 policy in Indochina.  After his purge he was criticized for seeking
 to place professionalism and military technique above politics.
 The fall of Lin and increased PLA attention to military training
 *  The 31 July NCNA English and Chinese version of the report
 referred to Wang as a Military Commission vice chairman.  A later
 English repeat of the item dropped the vice chairman reference and
 only used his party title,. as did Shanghai radio's 31 July radio
 report on t1: Army Day meeting.  NCNA Chinese has not carried a
 repeat.

 had long foreshadowed the possibility of his return.  Lo Jui-ching's
 return to public view, after a ten year hiatus, serves to emphasize
 Peking's current stress on the need for greater unity within the
 PLA, particularly at a time when the army is being called upon to
 quiet labor unrest and to safeguard production from factional
 struggle in some areas of the country.*
 Provincial radio reports on local activities to welcome the
 anniversary of the army did not reveal any major leadership
 changes.   Eight of the PRC's eleven military region commanders
 appeared in their localities for Army Day celebrations; Ting Sheng,
 Wang Pi-cheng and Han Hsien-chu did not appear.  Of the three only
 Han appears to be in dubious political health.   Ile was under heavy
 poster attack in the earlier stages of the campaign to criticize
 Lin Piao and Confucius last year., and has not appeared publicly in
 Lanchow since his first appearance there after being transferred
 from Fukien in January 1974.  His rare public appearances since
 then, most recently for May Day, have all been in Peking.

 NOTE
 LIFTING OF OAS CUBA SANCTIONS:               Havana radio promptly acknowledged
 the measures taken by the Organization of American States (OAS)
 during its 16-30 July meetings to revoke the 1964 saanct!ons against
 Cuba.  While still expressing contempt for the OAS, Havana's
 response has been in keeping with the regime's less emotional
 attitude toward the organization in recent years.  It may also
 reflect the fact that the outcome was anticipated, as sur,gested
 by a "Letter from Freddy"--reported by Havana's domestic service
 on 11 July--predicting that "everything will turn out well" and
 the "irregular and scandalous" sanctions would be lifted.
 Predictably, Premier Fidel Castro refrained from comment on the
 OAS session in his annual 26 July speech; according to a LATIN
 report on the 30th, when asked by newsmen about the final OAS
 decision, Castro "answered only with a broad smile."  The most
 authoritative response has come from Foreign Trade Minister
 Marcolo Fernandez, who was questioned by foreign newsmen while
 attending a meeting in Panama.  As reported by Havana's inter-
 national service on 3 August, Fernandes; said the OAS actions
 "do not affect Cuba," which "does not want to be a member of
 the OAS and never will be."  He added, however, that the moves
 might help "solve the, problem" of Latin countries which wanted
 renewed ties with Cuba.  Moscow, consistently characterizing the
 sanctions as "imposed on the OAS by Washington," reported the
 various stages of the OAS meetings.  Soviet comment has emphasized
 the usual twin themes with regard to Cuba and the OAS:  that
 Cuba's economic and diplomatic successes--due especially to its
 relationship with the USSR and the socialist world--have defeated
 the blockade, and that the OAS is "crumbling" under the weight of
 growing Latin unwillingness to "follow Washington's policy."
