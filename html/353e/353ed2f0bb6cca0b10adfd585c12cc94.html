 Banking Reform in China:
 Constructing an
 Economic Lever
 Summary       Chinese reformers are counting on a revitalized banking system to play a
 Information available critical role in controlling economic activity as Beijing implements its
 as of 21 January 1986 ambitious. economic reform program. For more than 30 years under
 was used in this report.
 China's centrally planned economic system, banks were little more than
 cashiers and accountants for the Ministry of Finance, and bank managers
 often were appointed on the basis of political orthodoxy rather than
 economic acumen. Efforts to improve efficiency throughout the economy
 by reducing the scope of mandatory planning and employing material
 incentives, however, forced Beijing to reconsider the role of banks in the
 economy.
 In the complex political struggle that surrounds economic reform in China,
 restructuring the banking system is an important testing ground for the
 reformers. When reforms were launched in 1979, conservatives warned
 that Beijing could lose control of the economy if the central planning
 mechanism was weakened-and argued that strict limits should therefore
 be placed on economic decentralization. Reformers countered that indirect
 economic levers-such as credit levels or interest rates-could be used to
 regulate economic activity occurring outside the plan.
 China's banking system, however, was woefully unprepared to provide
 those economic levers. The central bank lacked tools for conducting
 monetary policy and was hampered by having to conduct both commercial
 and oversight activities. Senior bank officials often had only a dim view of
 modern banking practices, and lower level bank managers-used to being
 told to whom to loan money-had almost no experience conducting project
 evaluations or basing lending decisions on economic criteria.
 In the past seven years, and particularly since 1982, Beijing has made a
 major overhaul of its financial system to enable banks to meet the
 monetary demands accompanying economic reforms. Beijing has expanded
 the authority of, and increased the monetary tools available to, its central
 bank so that it can flexibly adjust credit levels to maintain macroeconomic
 stability while the old regulatory mechanism of central planning and
 administrative directives is partially dismantled. To improve the allocation
 of funds, local banks simultaneously have been given greater autonomy
 over lending decisions, and bank loans increasingly are replacing govern-
 ment budget grants for enterprise investment.

 By reducing the scope of central planning and delegating decisionmaking
 authority to lower levels, Beijing has increased the responsiveness of
 China's economy to monetary policy. Beijing intends to conduct a more
 active monetary policy to maintain macroeconomic stability, but poorly
 formulated or inappropriately executed monetary policy now will have
 a much more deleterious impact on the economy than before the
 reforms.
 The danger of proceeding with industrial reforms before the banking
 system is capable of regulating the economy was illustrated during the past
 two years. Beijing's reform program suffered a major setback in 1984,
 when currency in circulation and loans to industrial enterprises increased
 50 percent. This contributed to runaway industrial growth, a jump in
 inflation, and a sharp drop in China's foreign exchange reserves. The credit
 surge was sparked by increased enterprise autonomy and central instruc-
 tions to banks to provide loans to promote reform. Lax oversight and
 muddled accounting by the central bank allowed credit to increase much
 more than Beijing intended. A tight monetary policy implemented in the
 spring of 1985 has gradually slowed the economy, but continuing investiga-
 tions of credit practices within the banking system suggests that Beijing
 has not recovered from the credit binge.
 Despite the painful adjustments of the 1984-85 period, we believe China
 has been benefiting from bank reform. The increased use of loans in place
 of budget grants, for instance, has sped the turnover of working capital and
 reduced construction periods, and greater flexibility by rural banks to issue
 loans has boosted the development of specialized farming and rural
 industries. Bank willingness to loan more to family and small-scale
 enterprises clearly has stimulated important growth in the private and
 collective sectors of the economy-goals long sought by economic reform-
 ers. Benefits of bank reform have been limited, however, by a shortage of
 skilled bank managers and by continued interference in lending decisions
 by local government and party officials. We believe, moreover, that
 monetary control techniques are not yet reliable, and Beijing faces
 substantial risks that monetary policy may actually be destabilizing-as it
 was in 1984.

 At the party conference in September 1985, Beijing reiterated its determi-
 nation to complete the transformation of the banking system during the
 next five years. We believe Beijing will increase the use of interest rates as
 economic levers, promote greater competition among banks, broaden the
 range of financial instruments available, and establish a short-term capital
 market. Even when the reforms are implemented fully, however, the state
 will continue to dominate the banking sector. Thus, the banking system
 will retain many of the characteristics of a monopoly bank and will provide
 Beijing with a powerful economic control mechanism.
 Bank reform probably will facilitate increased US trade with China.
 Chinese banks may become more willing to lend for imports or joint
 ventures as Beijing grants them greater flexibility in handling foreign
 exchange. Proceeds from the sale of foreign-currency-denominated
 bonds-recently issued for public purchase outside China for the first time
 since 1949-may go toward Chinese imports of US industrial equipment
 and high-technology products. Beijing's decision to allow foreign banks to
 establish wholly owned or joint-venture branches in China's four Special
 Economic Zones will increase opportunities for US banks to set up offices

 Banking Reform in China:
 Constructing an
 Economic Lever
 The Need for Banking Reform
 As Premier Zhao Ziyang stated in a recent interview,
 one of the key problems Beijing's reform program
 faces is how to maintain macroeconomic stability
 while reducing direct government control over state
 enterprises. Before industrial reforms were imple-
 mented, overall economic control was maintained
 through mandatory plans and administrative direc-
 tives. Central planners established output targets for
 key products, and the wages of staff and workers-
 and most prices-were fixed by the state. Central and
 provincial governments determined the scale of invest-
 ment spending, while the Ministry of Foreign Trade
 monopolized imports and exports and strictly con-
 trolled external capital flows. Given these pervasive
 economic controls, unplanned changes in aggregate
 demand could arise only from fluctuations in consum-
 er spending.' An unexpected increase in consumer
 spending, moreover, had little effect on prices or
 employment; its main impact was to increase short-
 ages of retail goods.
 Reforms implemented since 1978 have sharply dimin-
 ished administrative control over economic activity. In
 hopes of improving industrial performance, Beijing
 has reduced the scope of mandatory planning while
 giving enterprise managers greater decisionmaking
 authority. Enterprises now retain a much larger share
 of earnings-which they can use for investment, or
 wages and bonuses-and are permitted to sell over-
 quota production of industrial goods at prices above
 state-set levels. Price and wage controls have been
 relaxed, and more retail goods are marketed outside
 government-run commercial channels.
 Central planning still plays an important role in
 China's economy. By allowing enterprises increased
 autonomy over production decisions, however, Beijing
 Aggregate demand refers to the total demand for goods and
 services produced in an economy, and is made up of consumer
 demand, desired investment spending, government expenditures,
 and net exports (exports minus desired imports).
 has given up an element of direct control over aggre-
 gate demand. As enterprise managers determine in-
 vestment spending and wage payments on their own,
 rather than following guidelines set by central plan-
 ners, much sharper fluctuations in aggregate demand
 may occur.
 Reformers hope to control aggregate demand-and
 maintain economic stability-through indirect eco-
 nomic levers employed by a revitalized banking sys-
 tem.s Monetary authorities in particular have been
 assigned responsibility for adjusting interest rates and
 credit levels to offset undesirable changes in invest-
 ment or consumer spending.
 Beijing also intends to have the banking system play
 an increasingly large role in funding investment pro-
 jects. Reformers recognize that interest-free budget
 grants in the past encouraged wasteful use of invest-
 ment funds and extended construction periods. Beijing
 hopes that interest rates will serve as a lever to speed
 up the turnover of funds, and that banks will investi-     25X1
 gate projects more closely for their potential profit-
 ability.
 When China's economic reform program was
 launched in 1979, the banking system was woefully
 unprepared to undertake an active monetary role.
 Bank managers, used to following administrative dir-
 ectives, had little knowlege of modern banking tech-
 niques. Moreover, China's central bank lacked the

 securities and changes in the central bank discount
 rate), and was hampered by having to conduct both
 commercial and regulatory activities. The primary
 problem reformers faced was that for more than three
 decades Chinese banks had not been allowed to
 operate like banks.
 Within the confines of China's centrally planned
 economy, the banking system was charged with facili-
 tating attainment of the national economic plan, but,
 because most credit was provided from government
 budget grants, banks often served as little more than
 cashiers and accountants for the Ministry of Finance.
 Monetary policy was "passive" in that credit levels
 were not purposefully adjusted to counter changes in
 aggregate demand, and the banking system played
 little role in maintaining financial stability. The bank-
 ing system's close monitoring of currency and credit
 flows, however, provided economic planners with im-
 portant financial data.
 The Ministry of Finance used government revenues to
 supply investment funds and enough working capital
 to enterprises to meet planned production targets.
 Interest was not charged on these budget grants, and
 principal was not expected to be repaid, because the
 allocation of funds was determined by the central plan
 and because enterprises were required to turn over all
 profits to the state anyway. Banks did not offer loans
 for investment, but supplied short-term financing to
 meet enterprises' unplanned needs for funds. Banks
 charged interest on working capital loans primarily so
 they could cover interest payments on household
 savings accounts.
 Banks were supposed to keep the growth of household
 currency holdings in line with available supplies of
 consumer goods, but most of the factors affecting
 household currency holdings were outside the control
 of banking authorities. Credit entered circulation
 mainly through wage payments to urban workers and
 through state purchases of agricultural products. Cur-
 rency was withdrawn when consumers purchased
 goods from state and cooperative firms. The banks'
 role in adjusting currency supplies was to encourage
 additions to, or withdrawals from, household savings
 deposits. Interest rates were set by the state and rarely
 Suppliers of Credit
 Under Political Duress
 During the Great Leap Forward (1958-60) and the
 Cultural Revolution (1966-76), banking policies and
 operations were subject to political criteria to an
 unprecedented extent. During the Great Leap For-
 ward, boosting output rapidly became a means for
 factory managers and local officials to show adher-
 ence to the party line. Banks were instructed to grant
 loans whenever enterprises requested funds to meet
 production targets, and it became almost impossible
 for banks to refuse any loan request. During the
 Cultural Revolution, China's central bank was sub-
 sumed under the Ministry of Finance, and its local
 branches were taken over by party committees that
 used them as personal suppliers of funds for the
 expansion of enterprise output.
 changed, however, so moral suasion was the main tool
 that banks had to induce changes in savings deposits.
 Banks used the ratio of retail sales to currency in
 circulation as a key currency indicator. If the ratio fell
 below a target level-indicating excessive amounts of
 currency in circulation-banks did not have the power
 to stop payment of excess wages or withhold credit
 used to procure agricultural products. Instead, they
 could only alert the appropriate government supervi-
 sory authorities.
 The banking sector used administrative controls to
 keep financial developments in the enterprise sector
 separate from developments in the household sector.
 Enterprises and government units were required to
 settle accounts with each other by bank transfers that
 were closely scrutinized to ensure compliance with the
 economic plan. Enterprises could hold currency only
 under very restrictive conditions, and were not al-
 lowed to extend credit to other enterprises. To prevent
 banks from competing for business, enterprises were
 assigned to particular banks. Individuals received
 cash for wages and sales of agricultural products, but

 For 35 years the People's Bank of China (PBOC) was
 China's central bank and also its largest commercial
 bank. Since 1983, when its commercial banking
 operations were split off, the People's Bank increas-
 ingly has functioned as a true central bank. The
 PBOC has the status of a ministry directly under the
 State Council and is charged with formulating mone-
 tary policy and developing credit and currency targets
 that are consistent with annual economic plans and
 long-run development goals. The central bank con-
 trols the issue of currency, sets interest rates, and
 approves the establishment, closure, or merger of
 financial organizations. The central bank is responsi-
 bleforauditing financial institutions, and, since
 August 1985, has managed the State Treasury-
 overseeing the collection and distribution of govern-
 ment revenues. The PBOC also sets China's exchange
 rate, controls state holdings of foreign exchange,
 regulates the issuance offoreign-currency-denominat-
 ed bonds, and represents the government in interac-
 tions with international monetary organizations.
 The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) was created in
 1955, then abolished in 1957 when its duties were
 taken over by the PBOC. It was reestablished in
 February 1979 to handle banking operations in rural
 areas. The ABC specializes in collecting saving de-
 posits from peasants and offering loans in support of
 agricultural production and rural industry. It is the
 main channel for state loans and investment to
 agriculture, and is responsible for collecting revenue
 in the countryside. The ABC also oversees the opera-
 tions of the rural credit cooperatives.
 The rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) were created in
 the countryside during the period of rural collectiv-
 ization in the 1950s. Although collectively owned,
 they operate essentially as grassroots units of the
 Agricultural Bank. Their resources come mostly
 from farmers' deposits and borrowings from the
 Agricultural Bank, and their funds are invested
 mainly in the rural economy. The RCCs recently
 have been given an expanded role in extending credit
 in the countryside.
 The People's Construction Bank of China (PCBC)
 was established in 1954 to manage the state's capital
 construction funds. Prior to 1979, its primary func-
 tion was to distribute state budget allocations to
 enterprises for investment projects, and to oversee the
 operations of state construction units. Until 1979, the
 Construction Bank was subordinate to the Ministry
 of Finance and the State Capital Construction Com-
 mission, and operated more like a fiscal agent of the
 Ministry than as a bank. The role of the Construction
 Bank has changed significantly during the past few
 years. In August 1979, the PCBC issued repayable,
 interest-bearing bank loans for construction projects
 on a trial basis. The experiment was broadened when
 the State Council decided in November 1980 that all
 capital construction appropriations to enterprises that
 had been granted independent accounting authority
 would assume the form of bank loans. The Construc-
 tion Bank now distributes both appropriations and
 loans for capital construction. It also extends loans
 for the production of industrial commodities for
 export, and takes deposits from construction organi-
 zations and geological prospecting units.
 The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
 (ICBC) was created in January 1984 to take over the
 commercial operations of the People's Bank of China.
 The Industrial and Commercial Bank accepts savings
 deposits from urban residents, enterprises, and

 government organizations, and offers working capital
 loans to state-run and urban collective enterprises as
 well as to individuals engaged in industry and com-
 merce. The ICBC also settles accounts between firms,
 and monitors financial accounts particularly wage
 funds-of state-run enterprises.
 Since 1949 the Bank of China (BOC) has specialized
 in the management of foreign exchange and the
 settlement of China's international trade and service
 accounts. The BOC handles foreign currency loans
 and deposits in China, including remittances from
 overseas Chinese. Besides carrying out investment
 overseas, the BOC offers Chinese and foreign curren-
 cy loans to Chinese enterprises and domestic joint
 ventures. The Bank of China maintains correspon-
 dent relationships with about 1,200 foreign banks in
 1 50 countries, and has opened more than 280 over-
 seas branches (including two in the United States).
 The BOC is also authorized to sell foreign-currency-
 denominated bonds for the central government. Be-
 cause of recent bank reforms, the BOC no longer
 monopolizes China's international financial dealings.
 China International Trust and Investment Corpora-
 tion (CITIC) was established in October 1979 to
 serve as an intermediary in arranging joint ventures
 between Chinese and foreign firms. The goal of the
 corporation is to introduce foreign funds and technol-
 ogy and promote investment in China. Since January
 1982, Beijing has allowed CITIC to raise capital by
 selling foreign-currency-denominated bonds. Besides
 lending funds to domestic joint ventures, CITIC also
 has made equity investments in joint ventures. F_
 The China Investment Bank (CIB) was created in
 December 1981 with World Bank funds to provide
 loans for small-scale industrial modernization pro-
 jects. Unlike CITIC, which seeks investment funds
 primarily from private sources, the Investment
 Bank's main business consists of arranging long- and
 medium-term loans from international monetary or-      25X1
 ganizations-primarily the World Bank. The CIB
 also engages in capital participation with joint ven-
 tures and organizes syndicate loans. The China In-
 vestment Bank works closely with the Ministry of
 Finance and the Construction Bank.
 After being virtually suspended in 1958, the insur-
 ance business was revived when the People's Insur-
 ance Company of China (PICC) was reinstated in
 1980 to provide property and transportation insur-
 ance for households and enterprises. In January 1984
 the People's Insurance Company was split off from
 the People's Bank of China. The PICC handles both
 domestic and overseas insurance and recently has
 developed life, health, auto, and agricultural insur-
 ance.
 Beijing created the Central Bank Council in January      25X1
 1984 to serve as the key advisory body within the
 banking system. The council is headed by the presi-
 dent of the People's Bank and is composed of vice
 presidents and financial advisors of the PBOC, presi-
 dents of the specialized banks, and one vice-minister
 each from the Ministry of Finance, the State Plan-
 ning Commission, and the State Economic Commis-
 sion. The Central Bank Council gives advice on
 monetary policy, analyzes the adequacy of credit
 policies in relation to the economic plan, and exam-
 ines institutional developments within the banking       25X1
 system. 25X1

 could use their currency only to purchase consumer
 goods or increase their savings deposits. Banks did not
 offer loans to individuals.
 Changing the Structure of the Banking System
 Recognizing that banking reform must accompany
 other economic reforms, Beijing has been making
 major institutional changes in its banking system
 during the past seven years. Beijing has reestablished
 a network of rural banks, stopped using its construc-
 tion banks solely as conduits for Ministry of Finance
 funds, spun off the commercial banking operations
 formerly conducted by its central bank, and ended the
 monopoly on international financial transactions held
 by its foreign exchange banks. After key reforms in
 1983 and 1984, China's banking system now consists
 of a central bank and a number of banks that
 specialize in particular types of financial operations.
 The centerpiece of Beijing's bank reform strategy is to
 strengthen the powers of the People's Bank of China
 (PBOC) to enable it to function as a true central bank.
 After being subsumed under the Ministry of Finance
 during the Cultural Revolution, the PBOC was rein-
 stated as a direct adjunct of the State Council by a
 decision of the National People's Congress in 1978.
 The People's Bank, however, continued to be ham-
 pered in its oversight role by having to conduct daily
 commercial operations-including monitoring finan-
 cial activities of state enterprises. A series of banking
 reforms announced by the State Council in September
 1983 significantly enhanced the powers of the PBOC
 as a central bank:
 ? The PBOC was designated as China's sole central
 bank, its right to manage the specialized banks and
 other financial institutions was expanded, and the
 status of the specialized banks, China International
 Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), and
 People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) was
 downgraded correspondingly.
 ? The PBOC's deposit and lending divisions were
 separated from its central banking divisions (and
 transferred to the ICBC when it was formally
 established on 1 January 1984.)
 ? The PBOC's guidance over loans offered by the
 Construction Bank was strengthened.
 ? The State Administration of Exchange Control was
 transferred from the Bank of China to the PBOC.'
 Central Bank Council.
 control over the banking system.
 Although the banking reforms in September 1983
 strengthened the power of the PBOC over the special-
 ized banks, the Ministry of Finance continued to exert
 a strong influence over the banking system through its
 authority to establish economic policy guidelines and
 to interpret regulations. We believe, however, that the
 Ministry's influence was eroded in 1985. A State
 Council decision late in July 1985, for instance, gave
 the PBOC control of the State Treasury-an econom-
 ic department we believe was run formerly by the
 Ministry of Finance. In our view, the Ministry proba-
 bly now exercises very little direct administrative
 The PBOC supervises the banking system through its
 network of branch banks. The People's Bank has
 branches in China's provinces-which are subordi-
 nate to the head office in Beijing-and secondary
 branches in prefectures, large cities, and some coun-
 ties-which are subordinate to the provincial offices.
 Branch banks regulate credit and currency flows in
 their localities and supervise the operations of the
 specialized banks and other financial institutions
 within their jurisdictions. Beijing's goal is for the
 PBOC increasingly to use economic levers-such as
 changes in the central bank lending rate-rather than
 administrative edicts, to guide the credit practices of
 the specialized banks.
 ' The State Administration of Exchange Control, established in
 March 1979, is a specialized financial organ that formulates
 regulations governing the use of foreign exchange, supervises all
 foreign exchange receipts and disbursements, and periodically
 announces new exchange rates.F____1

 How the PBOC Conducts Monetary Policy
 The main focus of monetary policy in China remains
 the development of credit and currency targets that
 complement the economic plan, but Beijing increas-
 ingly is calling on the People's Bank to play a more
 active role managing macroeconomic activity. Central
 banks in market economies use open market opera-
 tions, discount rate adjustments, and changes in re-
 serve requirements to regulate the volume of credit.'
 Open market operations refer to central bank sales (or purchases)
 of government securities to (or from) commercial banks and the
 public. Discount rate changes are changes in the interest rate paid
 by commercial banks when borrowing from the central bank.
 Reserve requirement changes refer to changes in the amount of
 reserves a commercial bank must maintain in relation to its total
 deposits. Open market sales of securities, increases in the discount
 rate, or increases in reserve requirements tend to decrease the
 amount of reserves available to the banking system, and thus, the
 total volume of credit in the economy.
 The primary monetary tools used by the People's
 Bank are quantitative restrictions on the amount of
 loans that the specialized banks can offer. Beijing is
 moving quickly, however, to expand the number of
 monetary control instruments available to the PBOC,
 including reserve requirement and discount rate
 changes.
 The head office of the People's Bank approves credit
 plans for each of the specialized banks-including
 target levels for loans, deposits, and borrowing from
 the PBOC. The specialized banks then assign credit
 ceilings to their provincial branches. On the basis of
 the provincial ceilings established by the specialized
 banks, the PBOC head office instructs its branches on
 how much they can lend to the specialized banks in
 each province. The People's Bank may set additional
 restrictions on particular types of loans and, in the
 wake of excessive credit expansion in 1984, the PBOC
 now maintains quarterly credit limits for the special-
 ized banks. There are no formal penalties, however,
 for exceeding credit limits, and the PBOC has had
 problems keeping specialized banks from exceeding
 their ceilings.
 China instituted a reserve requirement system in
 1984, whereby financial institutions were required to
 turn over a stipulated percentage of their deposits to
 the PBOC. Originally, the reserve percentage was
 based on the type of deposits, but in 1985 a uniform
 reserve ratio of 10 percent was set for all banks.
 The People's Bank increased its discount rate in 1985
 to tighten control over specialized bank borrowing
 from the PBOC. In 1984, the PBOC charged the
 same interest rate on loans to the specialized banks as
 it paid the specialized banks for their reserve depos-
 its-thereby greatly limiting the effectiveness of hav-
 ing a reserve requirement. In 1985 the PBOC in-
 creased its discount rate to 4.68 percent annually,
 while holding the rate on specialized bank deposits
 with the PBOC to 4.32 percent. If a specialized bank
 needed funds in excess of its limit in the credit plan, it
 could borrow short-term funds from the PBOC at a
 5.04-percent annual rate. We expect that in the next

 year Beijing will widen the difference between the
 discount rate and the rate paid on reserve deposits of
 the specialized banks.
 China also is making greater use of interest rates on
 commercial loans and savings accounts as levers to
 enhance macroeconomic stability. After keeping in-
 terest rates almost unchanged during 1965-78, Beij-
 ing raised the general structure of interest rates five
 times in the past seven years. Beijing hopes that
 higher rates on savings deposits will encourage in-
 creased consumer saving-reducing the demand pres-
 sure caused by rapid increases in personal income and
 providing funds for priority investment projects.
 Higher rates on loans are to discourage wasteful or
 unproductive enterprise investment. We judge it prob-
 able that Beijing will raise interest rates again in 1986
 (see table).

 The People's Bank continues to use administrative
 controls to supplement credit quotas and indirect
 monetary levers. For instance, when central officials
 became alarmed that wage payments were growing
 too rapidly in 1985, they reinstated the requirement
 that enterprises conduct all wage disbursements
 through separate bank accounts. The Industrial and
 Commercial Bank is to monitor enterprise accounts,
 and alert the appropriate government authorities if
 enterprises divert bank deposits designated for tax
 payments, investment, or retirement funds into wage
 payments.
 Because China lacks a secondary market for govern-
 ment securities, the People's Bank cannot employ the
 primary monetary control tool used by central banks
 in market economies-open market operations-and
 we do not believe this will be possible for some time.
 Direct sales of treasury bonds by the government,
 however, do provide an important means of absorbing
 excess funds. After being suspended in 1958, Beijing
 resumed issuing treasury bonds in 1981. Initially,
 sales were restricted to state-owned and collective
 enterprises and government organizations, but sales to
 individuals began in 1982 and have accounted for
 about half of the 4 billion yuan sold each year since
 then. Beijing planned to sell 6 billion yuan of bonds in
 1985, with the increase in sales aimed at individual
 buyers.' Reselling government bonds is prohibited, but
 in 1985 for the first time, bonds can be discounted at
 banks to allow individuals to recover their funds if
 they need cash before the bonds mature, and the
 bonds can be used as collateral for bank borrowing.
 Microeconomic Reforms To Improve
 the Allocation of Funds
 on how loans are being used by the borrowers. Banks
 now can lengthen or shorten the terms of loans, and
 some banks may adjust loan rates within a 20-percent
 range of the rates set by the PBOC. If branches are
 able to attract more savings deposits, they have the
 right to extend more loans rather than remit the extra
 funds to their head office, but branches still must
 meet a target established by their head office for the
 net amount of deposits and loans outstanding at the
 end of the year. F_~
 Beijing has given banks much more flexibility to meet
 the needs of customers. In 1982 enterprises and
 organizations for the first time were allowed to hold
 time deposits (which earn much higher rates of return
 than the sight deposits they were required to hold
 previously). Banks also have introduced new types of
 loans, such as housing loans. Some banks have im-
 proved the convenience of their services by organizing
 mobile bank teams that go door-to-door to collect
 savings deposits. F__1
 To improve the allocation of funds between regions,
 Beijing has granted permission for branches of a
 specialized bank to transfer funds among themselves,
 and for a specialized bank to borrow from other
 specialized banks.

 beginning in 1985 pro- 25X1
 vincial offices of the PBOC have been encouraged to
 organize a market for interbank funds. Apparently, a
 specialized bank's excess deposits and unutilized cred-
 it may be released to other specialized banks for a
 maximum of 10 days. The interest rate charged for
 these short-term funds is to be linked to the PBOC        25X1
 discount rate. Although in its infancy, we believe that
 regional differences in rates of return on capital will
 spur rapid development of this interbank funds mar-
 ket-if Beijing permits.'
 China's specialized banks are gradually being trans-
 formed into independent enterprises-responsible for
 their own profits and losses-that operate under
 broad PBOC supervision. Local branches of the spe-
 cialized banks have been given greater flexibility in
 allocating their overall credit targets between differ-
 ent types of loans, and have the right to restrict credit
 to inefficient enterprises or deny loans that would go
 toward financing excessive stocks of goods. The
 PBOC encourages local banks to conduct feasibility
 studies before issuing loans, and to check periodically
 ' In 1985, the bonds offered a 9-percent interest rate for individuals
 and a 5-percent interest rate for institution buyers (which are
 comparable to yields on bank savings accounts). The bonds had a
 five-year maturity with interest and principal to be paid at maturi-
 ty. The PBOC handles the issuance of treasury bonds and the
 payment of principal and interest, and receives a fee from the
 Ministry of Finance for acting as its agent.=
 6 Xue Muqiao, an eminent reform economist, has stated that banks
 in northwest China tend to have surplus funds, while banks in the
 southeast are short of funds. Allowing interregional borrowing
 apparently has caused a flow of funds from the northwest to the
 southeast.

 Bank loans increasingly are supplanting budget grants
 in financing both working capital of enterprises and
 investment spending.' For instance, a middle-level
 official with the State Economic Commission reported
 to Embassy Beijing that, in the next five years, almost
 all funds for technical transformation of state enter-
 prises will be in the form of bank loans. Beijing hopes
 that allocation of investment funds will be improved
 when profit-seeking banks carefully screen prospec-
 tive borrowers and when enterprises are forced to bear
 the costs of financial capital.F_~
 To absorb surplus funds that are outside the banking
 system, and to prod banks to improve their operations,
 Beijing in the past year has begun to experiment with
 new financial forms and instruments such as private
 credit institutions, enterprise shares, and bank
 "bonds." Beijing also is allowing foreign banks to
 increase operations in China, albeit on a limited scale.
 Practical and ideological problems, however, have
 caused some wavering of leadership attitudes toward
 these experiments.
 Popular Credit Institutions
 In what perhaps is a concession to an already flourish-
 ing practice, Beijing is encouraging peasants to pool
 their earnings and form private credit institutions to
 support the development of rural industry and agricul-
 tural production. These "popular" credit institu-
 tions-often taking the form of local credit unions or
 joint-stock operations-were praised by Vice Premier
 Wan Li in a speech at a national rural work confer-
 ence in December 1984 as important supplements to
 the Agricultural Bank and the rural credit coopera-
 tives. Provincial officials, too, have urged peasants to
 rely on their own efforts in raising funds for invest-
 ment. According to provincial media, popular credit
 ' Funds for investment spending come from budget allocations,
 bank loans, self-raised funds, and retained earnings of enterprises.
 Most budget allocations for capital construction now are made as
 interest-bearing loans instead of grants. When loans are extended
 on the basis of budget allocations, the Ministry of Finance has
 claim on repayment of principal, but banks retain interest pay-
 ments. When banks use their own funds to extend loans, the banks
 have claim on both principal and interest.
 institutions often outbid rural banks and credit coop-
 eratives for funds by offering higher rates of return,
 and extend loans at above-bank rates to peasants and
 enterprises that have no other source of credit.
 We believe that Beijing's willingness to loosen control
 of rural credit by sanctioning the development of
 private credit institutions reflects disappointment with
 the pace of reform in the rural banking system. In his
 speech, Wan referred to unresolved structural prob-
 lems thatdimit rural banks and credit cooperatives.
 Chinese press reports in January 1986, however,
 suggest that policymakers are concerned with the high
 interest rates often charged on loans by these institu-
 tions.
 Domestic Trust and Investment Corporations
 With PBOC approval, branches of the specialized
 banks, and some provinces and cities, have set up trust
 and investment corporations to channel surplus finan-
 cial resources of enterprises and local governments
 into new investment activities. The corporations han-
 dle trust loans, trust investments, trust leasing, and
 provide consulting services. Provincial media suggest,
 however, that Beijing temporarily called a halt to
 trust loans in some provinces in August 1985-
 apparently because of concerns about excessively rap-
 id and unregulated growth of these loans.
 Enterprise Shares
 According to a banking journal published by the
 PBOC, 58 cities that are designated as "laboratories
 for reform" have allowed some state enterprises to
 issue bonds to their own staff and workers. Chinese
 media suggest that local authorities also are issuing
 bonds or shares to raise funds for local capital invest-
 ment.
 Bank Bonds
 In August 1985 Beijing announced that the Agricul-
 tural Bank would be allowed to sell 1.5 billion yuan of
 bonds in the countryside to raise funds for rural
 enterprises producing goods for export or firms under-
 taking investment projects that banks deem profit-
 able. The bonds have a one-year term and pay

 9-percent interest on maturity, and funds are to be
 loaned out at interest rates of 12 to 14 percent.
 Beijing also authorized the Industrial and Commer-
 cial Bank to issue 500 million yuan of bonds bearing
 the same rate and maturity to urban residents. Pro-
 ceeds of the ICBC bond sale are to be loaned to urban
 collective enterprises producing consumer goods that
 holds.
 Because bank bonds cannot be traded or discounted,
 they actually are more akin to certificates of deposits
 than bonds, in the Western use of the terms. An
 Agricultural Bank official told Embassy Beijing that
 this type of financing could become an increasingly
 important source of funds. Because the bank bonds
 carry higher interest rates than bank deposits of
 comparable maturity, we expect these financial in-
 struments to be very popular with Chinese house-
 Chinese exchange rate.
 Branches of Foreign Banks 8
 In April 1985 Beijing promulgated an ordinance
 allowing foreign banks to establish wholly owned or
 joint-venture branches in the four Special Economic
 Zones (Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen).
 Upon approval of the PBOC, branches of foreign
 banks will be allowed to settle foreign trade transac-
 tions and handle foreign currency deposits and loans
 and remit foreign exchange earnings for joint ven-
 tures. Foreign banks, however, must follow strict state
 guidelines in setting interest rates on loans and depos-
 its, and can offer foreign currency only at the official
 Chinese reform proponents have stressed the need to
 establish links between the world financial market
 and China's banking system. We believe Beijing
 hopes that, by allowing foreign banks to establish
 branches only in the Special Economic Zones, it can
 gain experience and draw in foreign investment funds
 while limiting the influence of foreign banks on the
 Chinese economy. Beijing also may hope that compe-
 tition from foreign banks will force Chinese banks in
 ' Since 1980 over 70 foreign banks have set up 140 representative
 offices in Beijing and other major Chinese cities, according to
 Chinese press reports. The representative offices, however, are
 restricted largely to providing liaison and consultation services and
 promoting trade.
 the Special Economic Zones to improve their services.
 We believe that allowing foreign banks to open
 branches in the Special Economic Zones may be, in
 part, a tacit admission that China's banking system is
 not capable of handling the burgeoning trade between
 China and Western countries.
 By the end of 1985, one joint-venture bank had been
 established in Xiamen, and four foreign banks had
 been granted permission to open branches in Shenz-
 hen (the first allowed to open in China since 1949).
 Although press reports indicate other banks are inter-
 ested in opening branches, we believe many foreign
 bankers remain wary of restrictions on bank activities
 and potential problems in remitting foreign currency
 earnings.
 We believe Beijing faces two significant challenges to
 carrying out its bank reform program, both of which
 are illustrated by the 1984 credit surge and its
 aftermath. The first stems from a potential conflict
 between granting specialized banks increased autono-
 my, and strengthening the regulatory powers of the
 People's Bank. A primary goal of local banks is to
 maximize bank revenues by increasing the amount of
 outstanding loans, while a main concern of the central
 bank is to maintain macroeconomic stability by-
 among other things-preventing credit from expand-
 ing too rapidly. Therefore, Beijing must carefully
 match increases in bank autonomy with improve-
 ments in central bank control techniques.
 The increased responsiveness of industrial production
 to monetary levers poses a second potential problem
 for Beijing. The state plan is no longer the sole
 determinant of the amount of investment spending by
 enterprises.' Bank loans constitute a growing portion
 of investment funds, and with the devolution of
 decisionmaking authority to enterprises, output has

 become more responsive to the total amount of bank
 credit in the economy. Beijing plans to conduct a more
 active monetary policy to maintain macroeconomic
 equilibrium, but poorly formulated or inappropriately
 executed monetary policy now will have a much more
 deleterious impact on the economy. Increasing or
 decreasing credit levels at the wrong time will cause
 sharper fluctuations in output than before the re-
 forms. Beijing, therefore, must be especially cautious
 in formulating and monitoring credit policy.
 The 1984 Credit Binge
 The dangers inherent in bank reform were highlighted
 by the performance of China's banking system during
 the past 18 months. Inappropriate monetary policy
 and lax oversight caused both currency in circulation
 and loans to industrial enterprises to grow by about 50
 percent in 1984, with almost two-thirds of the in-
 crease coming in the fourth quarter. The credit surge
 continued in early 1985-with the PBOC reporting,
 for instance, that in the first quarter of 1985 the
 Agricultural Bank issued 3.2 times the amount of
 loans to rural enterprises as it did in the first quarter
 of 1984. According to China's State Statistical Bu-
 reau, enterprises used the growth in credit to launch
 new capital construction projects and hike wage
 funds-both of which grew at almost 40-percent
 annual rates during the first half of 1985. Strong
 consumer and investment demands caused industrial
 output to increase at a 23-percent annual rate during
 the same period. The excessive credit expansion
 caused China's official inflation rate to triple during
 1985, and contributed to a 35-percent drop in its
 foreign exchange reserves between September 1984
 and June 1985.
 increase support to economic development before the
 PBOC had developed adequate oversight and control
 mechanisms
 The money supply surge actually began at midyear in
 1984, rather than in the fourth quarter as Beijing
 claims. Figure 3 shows that the increase in currency
 in circulation in the third quarter of 1984 was twice
 the increase that occurred in the third quarter of any
 recent year. Growth of currency and credit acceler-
 ated after the Third Plenum of the 12th Party
 Congress in October 1984 placed the party's stamp of
 approval on measures designed to extend decision-
 making authority to lower levels throughout the econ-
 omy. Demand for credit grew as enterprise managers
 used their increased autonomy to undertake invest-
 ment projects and increase wage and bonus payments
 to workers. At the same time, government directives
 appearing in the Chinese press-as late as January
 1985-called for specialized banks to support reform
 by expanding their loan business. We believe some
 bank managers thought that their bonuses would be
 based on the total amount of loans issued.
 We believe problems monitoring and controlling the
 credit surge arose because the PBOC had been slow to
 disentangle its accounts from those of the specialized
 banks.
 (separate clearing accounts for each
 specialized bank were not established with the PBOC
 until April 1985. We believe specialized banks re-
 sponded to relaxed credit controls by boosting loans,
 and covered the extra lending by running up over-
 drafts with the PBOC. Press statements by central
 bank officials that the PBOC is not a cornucopia of
 funds suggest to us that the PBOC, whether witting or
 not, accommodated the specialized banks' increased

 Causes of the Credit Binge
 Premier Zhao, in his March 1985 report to the
 National People's Congress, attributed the unexpect-
 ed increase in credit to an accidental leak late in the
 year of a government decision to base 1985 credit
 limits on 1984 loan totals. In our view, while this may
 have exacerbated the problem, the credit and curren-
 cy surges were caused by much more fundamental
 errors in Beijing's bank reform policy. We believe that
 policy was bungled when Beijing ordered the special-
 ized banks to use their newly enhanced autonomy to
 demand for funds.
 Monetary Policy Response to the Credit Binge
 In April 1985 Beijing clamped down on credit, using a
 combination of administrative controls and indirect
 monetary levers. At the time, Beijing announced its
 intention to restore monetary equilibrium gradually,

 funds in special bank accounts to be monitored by

 ceeds the state quota or for projects not listed in the

 ? Enterprises and individuals requesting credit were
 required to pledge collateral equaling as much as 50
 percent of the value of the loan.
 ? Banks were ordered to make a better effort at
 collecting overdue loans, and were urged to make
 use of a regulation, promulgated in March 1985,
 that allows banks to acquire the pledged collateral
 of borrowers who cannot repay their loans.
 Aftermath of the Credit Binge
 Although having only a mild impact on the pace of
 industrial production in the six months after it was
 implemented, Beijing's restrictive monetary policy
 caused severe credit shortages in some rural areas.
 Chinese newspapers reported that credit shortages
 contributed to sharp drops in purchases of fertilizer
 and farm implements, and in some provinces farmers
 were forced to accept IOUs when state procurement
 units ran out of funds to purchase the summer
 harvest.
 Banks and enterprises in other regions have circum-
 vented or ignored the tight money policies. Chinese
 press reports suggest that rural industries have proved
 particularly adept at raising funds outside the bank-
 ing system to support rapid expansion of investment
 and output. Recent statements by the president of the
 PBOC that the volume of credit is still excessive, and
 a continuing widespread investigation of credit prac-
 tices within the banking system, suggest to us that
 Beijing has not yet recovered from the credit binge.
 Bank Reform Balance Sheet:
 Benefits and Unresolved Problems
 We believe China already has received substantial
 benefits from bank reform. Agricultural Bank credit
 probably played an important role supporting the
 development of livestock and cash crops by specialized
 The State Council appointed Chen Muhua president
 of the People's Bank of China in March 1985,
 probably to restore order to the banking system.
 Chen, formerly the head of the Ministry of Foreign
 Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT), is an
 alternate member of the Politburo and has a reputa-
 tion as a tough administrator. When Chen was head
 of MOFERT, she recentralized the trade apparatus,
 regained control over imports, and helped put an end
 to the trade deficits and foreign exchange problems
 that plagued China in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
 Unlike her predecessor, Chen holds the rank of State
 Councilor, which gives her equal status with the
 heads of the State Planning Commission, the State
 Economic Commission, and the Ministry of Finance.
 Her position as a Politburo alternate, however, gives
 her higher party status than the heads of the three
 superministries. We believe her appointment to the
 People's Bank is not only consistent with Beijing's
 plans to increase the authority of the PBOC but may
 presage an unprecedented PBOC role in policymak-
 ing.
 households during the transformation of the agricul-
 tural sector from commune-based production to
 household farming. Rapid growth of rural industrial
 production, to a large extent, has been a result of loan
 support from rural banks. We believe that greater
 BOC flexibility in handling foreign exchange has
 facilitated increased trade and promoted development
 of joint ventures in China. Chinese press reports
 suggest that the increased use of loans in place of
 budget grants has sped up turnover of working capital
 and reduced construction periods. The introduction of
 new financial institutions and instruments probably
 has helped tap some of the substantial cash hoards
 reportedly held by peasants. We believe, however,
 that Beijing will be unable to realize the potential

 benefits from bank reform until it has resolved five
 major deficiencies.
 Tenuous Monetary Control Techniques
 By reducing the scope of central planning and dele-
 gating decisionmaking authority to lower levels, Beij-
 ing has increased the responsiveness of economic
 activity to monetary policy. In our view, monetary
 control techniques are not yet reliable, and Beijing
 faces substantial risks that monetary policy actually
 may be destabilizing-as it was in 1984. The potential
 danger is compounded by the fact that Beijing does
 not appear to know how sensitive the economy is to
 monetary tools-and the responsiveness of enterprises
 and consumers probably is changing as the economic
 reforms proceed.10 In meetings with Western econo-
 mists, Chinese officials have indicated that they are
 unsure what the appropriate rate of monetary growth
 should be. Beijing's policy of developing a profit-
 oriented banking system by granting specialized
 banks greater flexibility in issuing loans may be at
 odds with its desire for better PBOC control over
 credit.
 Improper Banking Practices
 The specialized banks do not always use their in-
 creased autonomy in ways that Beijing intended.
 Chinese media report that bank competition for bor-
 rowers has resulted in the issuance of inadequately
 secured loans and the slashing of interest rates (in
 excess of regulations) to unprofitably low levels. Chi-
 nese media also report that local political pressures,
 not economic criteria, continue to determine the
 direction of loans. Some local party officials have
 threatened bankers with the loss of party membership
 if they do not accede to their demands for loans.
 Other press reports tell of local officials browbeating
 bankers for loans, and then using the funds to set up
 illegal companies. Banks apparently have no effective
 way of stopping enterprises from using loans for
 10 The large magnitude of China's currency flows relative to the
 total amount of currency in circulation makes it more difficult to
 maintain monetary equilibrium. In 1984, retail sales were over four
 times higher than currency in circulation, and the value of the
 increase in gross agricultural production corresponded to 50 percent
 of the average stock of currency during the year. A small variation,
 therefore, in wages, prices of agricultural products, or farm output
 could have a large impact on the stock of currency. F__~
 purposes other than those laid down in the loan
 contract, or compelling enterprises to repay them.
 Shortage of Skilled Managers and
 Inadequate Infrastructure
 China faces a critical shortage of skilled bank manag-
 ers. Under the Maoist banking system, managers for
 the most part did not have to make decisions based on
 economic criteria, or conduct loan and project evalua-
 tions, and therefore did not develop the skills required
 by modern banking practices. Beijing also lacks the
 physical infrastructure-such as modern telecom-
 munications and an integrated computer network-
 necessary for sophisticated banking operations (al-
 though Beijing increasingly is introducing computers
 in the banking system).
 Irrational Price Structure
 We believe that banking reform may not bring about
 a significant improvement in the allocation of funds if
 China's present irrational price system is not also
 reformed. In the absence of price reforms, the use of
 indirect monetary tools to control aggregate demand
 might cause a greater misallocation of resources than
 administratively set credit limits. For instance, if the
 PBOC decides to raise interest rates to slow invest-
 ment spending, enterprises that sell goods at high
 state-set prices may continue to afford loans, even if
 the enterprises are poorly managed. On the other
 hand, higher interest rates may force efficient firms to
 reduce borrowing and scale back production if their
 output must be sold at irrationally low prices. Initial
 efforts to reform urban food prices in 1985 caused the
 cost of living to soar and met with stiff consumer
 resistance, and Chinese officials are now saying that
 price stability-rather than price reform-will be
 emphasized in 1986.
 Absence of Enterprise Bankruptcy Laws
 In our view, the lack of bankruptcy laws for Chinese
 enterprises has contributed to Beijing's difficulty con-
 trolling excessive credit. Managers have taken advan-
 tage of their new decisionmaking authority by bor-
 rowing funds to increase investment or employee's

 wages, but, because Beijing still pays the operating
 expenses of state enterprises that lose money, firms
 can expand their borrowing without worrying about
 bankruptcy. Local banks, similarly, expand credit
 freely because they believe higher authorities will bail
 them out if they make bad loans. Beijing recognizes
 the need to allow enterprises to go bankrupt, but the
 irrational price system makes it difficult to determine
 which enterprises should be closed. Beijing, moreover,
 is reluctant to proceed with price reform while infla-
 tionary pressures-caused by excessive credit-are
 still strong. We believe Beijing will resolve its dilem-
 ma by proceeding with reforms on two fronts. First,
 Beijing will improve its ability to conduct active
 monetary policy by increasing and sharpening the
 monetary instruments at the PBOC's command, and,
 temporarily, allow the PBOC greater use of adminis-
 trative controls over credit. Second, Beijing will grad-
 ually implement the other components of its reform
 program, thereby making economic entities more
 responsive to market forces-including monetary
 levers.
 Progress rectifying the five deficiencies will not only
 boost the economic returns from bank reform, but
 also will pay political dividends to Chinese reformers.
 Since the reforms began party conservatives have
 argued that mandatory planning should play the
 primary role in maintaining macroeconomic stability,
 and that strict limits, therefore, must be placed on
 economic decentralization. We believe that reforms
 have proceeded, in part, because leaders are convinced
 that they can control economic activity successfully
 by employing indirect economic levers-such as inter-
 est rates and credit levels. Conservatives are quick to
 attack shortcomings, however, and have criticized
 Deng Xiaoping and members of his reform coalition
 for mismanaging the economy during the past year.
 Successfully transforming the People's Bank into a
 central bank capable of using indirect monetary tools
 to regulate credit in a decentralized banking system
 would, in our view, strengthen the hand of the
 reformers and improve the chances for the overall
 reform program.
 To meet China's ambitious development goals, banks
 and enterprises must make better use of existing
 financial resources. Enhancing the flexibility of banks
 to meet local credit needs and increasingly using
 interest rates to ration funds should, we believe,
 improve the allocation of resources while satisfying
 enterprises' demands for funds without resorting to
 inflationary issuance of currency.
 Progress to date suggests to us that the following
 trends probably will emerge in China's banking
 reform:
 ? Increased Use of Interest Rates as Economic Le-
 vers. Beijing will adjust the structure of interest
 rates more frequently to compensate for changes in
 economic conditions-rates probably will be raised
 again within the next year. Banks also will be given
 greater flexibility in setting interest rates on loans.
 ? Increased Competition Among Banks. Beijing grad-
 ually will allow increased competition among banks,
 both by allowing domestic banks to undertake bank-
 ing operations formerly reserved to a particular
 specialized bank, and by granting foreign banks a
 wider range of activities. Experiments with bank
 competition will be limited at first to the Special
 Economic Zones and then may spread to other areas
 in China.
 ? Increased Range of Financial Instruments. Beijing
 will continue to experiment with new financial
 instruments such as bank bonds (certificates of
 deposit), enterprise shares, and mutual funds.
 ? Establishing a Short-Term Capital Market. Ac-
 cording to a party journal, the president of the
 People's Bank recently said that "conditions for
 opening a short-term capital market are ripening."
 Beijing's initial steps include: allowing banks to
 borrow from each other, permitting the discounting
 or mortgaging of government bonds, authorizing
 interenterprise credit, and allowing banks to raise
 funds by issuing bonds. The president of the PBOC
 made it clear, however, that in the near future

 a large scale.
 Beijing will not allow stocks and bonds to be issued on
 over lending.
 Beijing probably will introduce new banking reforms
 at a slow, measured pace, particularly during 1986-
 87. Some financial reforms, however, such as the
 development of private credit institutions, may prove
 difficult to control. In the short run Beijing will
 closely monitor credit. Although we do not expect a
 repetition of the 1984 credit surge this year, we do
 expect Beijing to experience cycles of overexpansion
 and contraction of credit as it refines central bank
 monetary tools and gives local banks more flexibility
 ate inflation or recession.
 Even if the PBOC successfully develops sophisticated
 monetary tools, we believe Beijing's reforms will
 fundamentally alter macroeconomic conditions in
 China, and the economy may begin to experience the
 periodic bouts of inflation that occur in market econo-
 mies. Poorly formulated monetary policy will accentu-
 conditions.
 When bank reforms are implemented fully, the state
 will continue to dominate the banking sector, and
 foreign or nongovernmental banks will have only a
 limited scope of operations. As such, the banking
 system will retain many of the characteristics of a
 monopoly bank and will provide Beijing with a power-
 ful economic control mechanism. In our view, a
 stronger and more active central bank is compatible
 with an economic system that combines mandatory
 planning and market forces. Monetary policy will
 remain subordinate to the needs of the economic
 plan-and banks will continue to be required to offer
 preferential interest rates to priority sectors and to
 support designated loss making enterprises-but the
 banking system will be able to respond much more
 efficiently and flexibly to credit needs and economic
 We believe bank reform will facilitate increased trade
 with China. As the People's Bank increasingly func-
 tions as a true central bank, the BOC will operate
 more as a commercial bank-and less like a foreign
 exchange bank for the state-and may be more
 willing to lend foreign exchange for imports and joint      25X1
 ventures. Greater competition between the BOC and
 the CITIC for customers may foster trade, as will
 enhanced flexibility in conducting banking operations.
 As a result of bank reform, China probably will play a
 larger role in the international financial system. For
 the first time since 1949, China has issued foreign-
 currency-denominated bonds for public subscription
 outside China, and in the next few years, the BOC or
 the CITIC may consider issuing bonds in the United
 States. Proceeds from sales of foreign currency bonds     25X1
 may go toward Chinese imports of industrial equip-
 ment and high-technology products.
 Successful bank reform would increase opportunities
 for US banks to set up offices in China. The US
 Consulate in Hong Kong reported last summer that
 one US bank already was negotiating to form a joint-
 venture bank in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone.      25X1
 Foreign branch banking is in its infancy, but, as the
 PBOC gains experience regulating foreign branches,
 we expect Beijing to allow more foreign banks in
 China, and permit them to broaden the scope of their
 operations. In the short run, Beijing will continue to
 restrict foreign branches to the Special Economic
 Zones, and to foreign trade and investment financing.
 Reform, however, should provide opportunities for US
 banks to offer managerial services to Chinese finan-
 cial institutions.
