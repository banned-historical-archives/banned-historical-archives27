1 6 SEP 1972 
'Palestinians Munich disclaimer 
taken with a grain of salt 
Special to The Christian Science Monitor 
Beirut, Lebanon 
The belated statement by the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) disclaiming 
responsibility for the Munich attack by the 
Black September organization is a formal 
and tactical move that should not be taken too 
literally. 
Much of its significance turns on the 
meaning to be given to the word "responsi-
bility." If this is taken to mean "with the 
prior knowledge and the prior approval of" 
then the PLO can truthfully deny its responsi-
bility. 
It had no prior knowledge because Black 
September is the one Palestine guerrilla 
group that has managed to maintain tight 
secrecy around itself and its operations, and 
it is well known that there is little or no 
secrecy in the PLO. And there would not have 
been prior approval, for the young men and 
women in Black September broke away 
simply because of what they felt was the 
pussyfooting moderation of the older organi-
zations grouped in the PLO. (Till as late as 
1969 Al-Fatah, the largest group, was insist-
ing that its attacks should be on military 
targets and personnel.) 
But if "responsibility" means "with the 
approval of," then the PLO was telling a 
tactful tactical untruth in disclaiming respon-
sibility because Palestinians at all levels ? 
from university professor to truck driver 7 
approve of Black September unanimously, 
proudly, and defiantly. 
This approval, subsequent to the event, is 
certainly felt, privately, by members of the 
PLO executive committee which issued the 
disclaimer. 
After all, only one Arab ruler, King Hussein 
of Jordan, has expressed disapproval of 
Munich. 
There are, of course, precedents for such 
formal disclaimers. The State Department 
would deny responsibility for some of the 
activities of the Central Intelligence Agen-
cy's undercover operations. And, more apro-
pos, the Jewish Agency in the 1940's always 
denied responsibility for the violent acts of 
the Stern Gang and the lrgun Zvei Leumi, 
though it is now known, backed by a decision 
of the Israeli Supreme Court, that they were 
all part of a single overall organization. The 
PLO is thus simply stating its position for the 
record. 
The Israelis are unlikely to believe it 
because Tel Aviv newspapers are issuing 
what they claim to be lists of the names of 
leaders of Black September which link that 
group which Al-Fatah. But these are no more 
than guesses and part of the propaganda 
game. 
More important is the fact that in its last 
few meetings, the PLO executive committee 
made progress, though painfully slowly, 
toward the unification of its various groups.

field of foreign policy are not necessary 
to its efficient conduct? I suppose there 
must be some. The Senate must have had 
something in mind, or the sponsors of 
this proposal must have had something in 
mind, in making this suggestion. 
In sum, what I am saying, MT. Speaker, 
is that we need to be careful about a pro-

NOTES 
The Ten Commandments of 
the foreign -affairs bureaucracy 
by Leslie H. Gelb 
? and.Morton H. Halperin 
r3-HE AVERAGE READER of the New 
14, York Times in the 1950s must 
have asked: why don't we take some 
of our troops out of-Europe? Ike him-
self said we didn't need them all 
there. Later, in 1961, after the tragi-
comic Bay of Pigs invasion, the 
reader . asked: how did President 
? Kennedy ever decide to *do such a 
damn fool thing? Or later about Viet-
nam: why does President Johnson 
keep.. on bombing North Vietnam 
when :the b?ombing prevents negotia-
tions and doesn't get Hanoi to stop, 
the fighting? 
Sometimes the answer to these 
questions is simple. It can be attrib-
uted squarely. to ?the President: He 
thinks it's right. Or he believes he has 
no choice. As Often as not, though, 
the ans-wer lies elsewhere?in the spe-
cial interests and procedures of the 
bureaucracy and the convictions of 
the bureaucrats. 
If you look at. foreign policy as a 
largely. .rational process of gathering 
information, setting the alternatives, 
defining the national interest, and 
making.decisions,.then much of what 
the President. does will not make 
sense. But if you look at foreign. 
policy as bureaucrats pursuing orga-
? nizatiorial, personal, and, domestic 
political interests, as well as their own 
beliefs about what is right, you can 
explain much of the inexplicable. 
In. pursuing these interests and be-
liefs, bureaucrats (and that means 
everyone from Cabinet officials to 
political appointees to .career civil 
servants) usually follow their own 
version of the' Ten Commandments: 
1. Don't discuss domestic pol-
ities on issues involving war and 
Peace.

new state of Israel. Secretary of State 
George Marshall and State  0 
Under-
secretary Robert Lovett spoke first. 
They were' against it. It would un-
necessarily alienate forty million 
Arabs. 'ft-tin-Ian next asked Clark 
Clifford, then Special Counsel to the 
President, to speak. Arguing for the 
moral element of U.S. policy and 
the need to contain Communism in 
the Middle East, Clifford favored rec.. 
ognition. As related 'by Dan Kurzman 
in Genesis 19-18, Marshall exploded: 
'Mr. President, this is not a matter to 
be determined on the basis' of politics. 
Unless politics were involved, Mr. 
Clifford would not even be -at this 
confetetice. This is a serious matter 
of foreign policy determination . . 
Clifford remained at the meeting, and 
after some hesitation, the U.S. rec-
ognized Israel. 
The moral merits of U.S. support 
of Israel notwithstanding, no one 
doubts Jewish influence on Washing-
ton's policy toward the Middle East. 
And yet, years later, in their memoirs, 
both Truman and Dean Acheson de-
nied at great length that the decision 
to recognize the state of Israel was 
in any way affected by U.S:domestic 
politics. 
A powerful myth is at work here. 
It holds that national security is too 
important, too sacred, to be tainted 
by cross domestic political considera-
tions. It is a matter of lives and the 
safety of the. nation. Votes and in-
fluence at home .should count for 
nothing. Right? Wrong.- National se-
curity and domestic reactions are in-
separable. What could be clearer than 
the fact that President Nixon' Viet-
nam troop reductions are geared more 
to American public opinion than to 
the readiness of .the Saigon foices.to for an American-su tfl invasion 
defend the elves?. Yet the myth 
makes, it bad form for government 
officials to talk about domestic poli-
tics (except to friends and to repor-
ters off the record) or even to write 
about politics later in their memoirs. 
And what is bad form on the inside 
would be politically disastrous if it 
were leaked to- the outside. Imagine 
the press getting hold of a. secret goV-
eminent document that said: ''Presi-
dent Nixon has dedided to visit China 
to: capture the peace issue for the '72 
elections. He does not intend or ex-: 
'pect anything of substance to be 
achieved by his trip--except to scare 
the Russians a little." Few things are 
more serious than the charge of play-
ing, _politics with security. 
Nevertheless, the President pays a 
? price for the silence imposed by the 
myth. One cost is that.the President's 
assumptions about what- public opin-
ion will and.will not support are never 
questioned. No official, for example,. 
ever dared to write a scenario for 
President Johnson showing him how 
to forestall the right-wing, McCarthy-
ite reaction he feared if the U.S. 
pulled ,out of Vietnam. Another cost 
is that bureaucrats, in their ignorance 
of Presidential views, - will use their 
own notions of -domestic politics to 
screen information from the Presi-
dent or to eliminate options from his 
consideration. 
2. Say what will

importance to him?is only one of 
several critical areas in which he 
must make decisions involving do-
mestic policies, other international 
obligations, public mood and public 
opinion, the Congress, the personal-

This.broader view seems,to come

they classify as outsider's or "politi-

WASHINGTON?The Japanese have de 
mended equal time and will get it: Henry 
Kissinger, at liberty between Mexico and 
Moscow, will soon spend three days in Tokyo 
explaining U.S. policies to business and po-
litical leaders there. 
From Japan's viewpoint it 'seems only fit-
ting. After all, the Chinese were awarded 
. three visits by the senior White House adviser 
and the Russians will soon get their turn?so 
why not the Japanese too? Japan is dismayed 
,by some Ameridaii diplomatic tactics, and 
leaders want an explanation from someone 
who, in their eyes, really counts. 
For Mr. Kissinger, it's an opportunity to 
do vital service. Japan remains the main U.S. 
friend in Asia, as the President repeatedly 
states, and so reassuring Toyko is important 
work. Though the White House aide has lim-
ited respect ihr Japanese sophistication in 
foreign affairs, his usual erudition and intel-
lectual brilliance may well calm Tokyo's as-
sorted fears. . 
But back at the State Department the dip-
lomats are increasingly dismayed. The com-
ing Kissinger journey is just one more sign?
in case another is needed?that foreign policy 
! 
! has become a White House preserve, and that influence of the department and Secretary of 
State Rogers is often marginal at best. 
Two Questions 
Much has been written about this shift of 
authority from Foggy Bottom, as State's 
neighborhood is rather inelegantly called. So 
perhaps two questions should be raised: Who 
really cares? And what difference does it 
make? 
- Well, some people do care a great deal. 
Foremost, of course, are the foreign service 
officers themselves. About 3,000 strong, at 
home and. abroad, they joined the diplomatic 
ranks under the illusion they would help steer 
the ship of state. Now they often find them. 
selves shuffling papers for Henry Kissinger, 
deeply suspicious that the White House is 
burying them in busy work while it makes the 
decisions on its own. They have little sense of 
Participation, and a spreading belief that 
their chosen profession has grown irrelevant. 
Assorted internal bureaucratic problems 
add to their gloom. The service is top-heavy 
With rank just when its overall size is shrink-
ing for policy and budgetary reasons; this 
-rneans fewer promotions and fewer challeng-
ing jobs to go around. Moreover, the genial 
Mr. Rogers displays only intermittent interest 
in the bureaucracy he nominally heads. His 
loyalty is basically to Mr. Nixon. Many diplo-
mats think he just doesn't care much about 
State's complex problems, and many subordi-
nates complain that he doesn't work hard 
enough. 
But outside these directly affected bureau-
crat% there seem to be few worries. Sen. 
Pulbright and a few other legislators talk oc-
casionally about putting affairs of state back 
in the State Department. And some Capitol 
Bill staffers?former foreign service officers 8 
among them?also wring their hands, while

nd Fall at Fo 
' say Inez tne power transfer is not a matter of 
great public concern. 
So What does it matter? Can critics prov 
that U.S. foreign policy is bad because State' 
. experts oftert neither devise it nor execute it 
Doing so would be difficult. Even some o 
the most righteously indignant diplomats con 
cede admiration for the main lines of Nixon 
foreign policy. He is pulling troops fron 
Southeast Asia rather than sending more in 
(The current air buildup is dismissed, to 
lightly perhaps, as a temporary aberration) 
Two decades of misguided China policy have 
been reversed, and to popular acclaim. More 
serious negotiations, about more things, are 
now ? under way with the Soviet Union thai 
ever before. Meantime, relations with West 
ern Europe?still the prime U.S. foreign pol 
Icy concern?seem smoother than during the 
1960s. Indeed, many argue that policy is now 
more innovative precisely because it has been 
wrested from a sluggish State Department. 
Bottom 
foreign service officer, who adds candidly; 
"He is often right about that." 
Long-Range Considerations 
All these reasons may expla In why State 
has suffered even if foreign policy has not, at 
least not so far. Yet there are some longer-
range considerations that suggest the Nixon-
Kissinger management could eventually do 
L. disservice to the national interest. 
For one thing, many thoughtful officials 
? believe policy revolves too much around the 
person of Mr. Kissinger?no man to allocate 
authority and acclaim to others. Despite he-
roic workdays, he just doesn't have time for 
eVerything, and important matters can slide 
while his attention is focused on the crisis of 
the day. 
For example, South Asian policy may have 
gone sour partly because the White House 
worried mainly about strategic arms limita-
tion talks and China, ignoring early warnings 
from State. By his own admission, the senior 
advisor has little interest in international eco-
nomic problems; he has tended to slough 
them off. Even Mr. Kissinger's own staff 
grumbles about its inability to get his atten-
tion when some alleged crisis preoccupies 
him; the system funnels everything to him 
and has no other outlets. 
Likewise, the Security Council system has 
grown complex partly because the Nixon-Kis-
singer team believes State incapable of initia-
tive and action. Yet this alternate structure 
seems sure to stifle innovation; despite the 
administration's talks about seeking "op-
tions," the structure it relies most upon often . 
Chokes off backtalk and rival policies. For 
some, it .seems an attempt to ? cure State's 
stodginess by guaranteeing that it will grow 
even inore dull. 
Diplomats wonder if encouraging such me-
diocrity is really what the White House wants. 
Unless some practices are changed, they see 
a foreign service stripped of its best men 
(many now seem to be ?seeking other work), 
leaving plodders charged with representing 
U.S. interests abroad. Some even say the 
quality of young people seeking jobs at State 
has dropped. This doesn't bode well for ira-
pdrtant international negotiations, nor for the 
vital flow of information needed for policy-
making. Bad intelligence can only lead to bad 
policy, these diplomats contend. 
Finally, State's denizens grumble becduse 
outsiders so clearly realize where power now 
les. The Japanese, for example, weren't sat-
shied with the visit last March of Assistant 
Secretary Marshall Green, the top Asian hand 
at State. In requesting a higher-powered per-
sonage, they didn't ask for Mr. Rogers; they 
asked for Mr. Kissinger. 
This transfer wasn't a simple matter of a 
nimble Kissinger out-flanking a lethargic 
Rogers, as some would have it. Mr. Kissinger 
Is a rather cunning bureaucrat in his own 
right, with proven ability to operate within 
the framework of President Nixon's work 
style and prejudices.. But as the principals ex-
plain it, the power shifted basically because 
Mr. Nixon wanted it to, 
He sees management of the federal bu-
reaueray as a key problem of any presi-
dency. Bureaucracies, he thinks, spend too 
much time administering themselves and pro-
tecting their own interests and not enough in 
creating and administering innovative poli-
cies or in responding to the President's de-
sires. Mr. Kissinger seems to share .this view. 
Mr Kissinger, for example, believes the 
policy meetings he heads are leaner than 
those run by senior State Department offi-
cials. In his view, 'he is ruthless about who 
can attend; State lets in anybody with a mar-
ginal interest in the subject at hand. His 
meetings end with crisp decisions; State's 
ramble on to mushy compromises. When ap-
propriate, his give Mr. Nixon a range of op-
tions to choose from; State too often serves 
up a bureaucratic consensus for the Chief Ex-
ecutive to ratify or reject in its entirety. 
Close observers believe there were other, 
more personal, reasons that Mr. Nixon 
wanted foreign policy shifted to the White 
House. 
They think the President has held a grudge 
against State ever since Alger Hiss days, 
when he attacked the department Vigorously. 
Intensifying that grudge may be galling mem-
ories of the 1960s, when Mr. Nixon, a political 
loser, traveled widely. Sometimes he got off-
hand treatment from U.S. embassy personnel 
who saw him as a has-been; he is not a man 
to forget such slights. The President may also 
still see himself as a poor California boy bat-
tling an entrenched Eastern establishment. 
More generally, Mr. Nixon is said to con-
ider the entire federal bureaucracy a Demo-
retie enclave opposed to Republican rule a

The problem is that the White House ad-

BY STEWART ALSOP 
THE GHOST AT FOGGY BOTTOM 
WASHINGTON?Secretary of State 
ham Rogers is an able and likable man, 
but there is beginning to be something 
faintly translucent about him. Despite 
his. claim a few days ago that he was 
"not dispirited" and that in Peking he 
did not feel "excluded at all," there is 
a certain ghastliness about the Secre-
tary since the Peking journey. 
A major political figure in this cruel 
town becomes ghostly as soon as it is 
generally believed that he is on his 
way out. A chief subject of speculation 
in Washington now is not whether but 
when Secretary Rogers will leave the 
State Department, and thus he has be-
come a ghost. 
? Secretary Rogers was already, as in 
the children's game, two-thirds of a 
ghost before the Peking trip. He began 
to look a bit translucent long ago, when 
it first became evident that henry Kis-
singer had far more real influence on 
.foreign policy than the Secretary of 
State. But it was Mao Tse-tung and 
Chou En-lai who really made Rogers 
. a ghost. 
It has been widely assumed that his 
old friend, President Nixon, humiliated 
the Secretary of State for reasons of his 
own when he excluded him from the 
key meetings with Mao and Chou. But 
' that is not really how it happened. 
. What really happened is that the Presi-
dent, as soon as he realized that Rogers 
was in an embarrassing position in Pe-
king, made a real effort to save his Sec-
retary's face; but the Chinese refused 
to cooperate with the face-saving effort. 
SURPRISE 
On the same day the President land-
. ed in Peking, he was summoned to a 
meeting with Mao. Henry Kissinger?
and no one else?was invited to the au-
dience. The President, taken by sur-
prise, acquiesced. He also acquiesced 
in the arrangement for the negotiating 
session starting the next day, in which 
he and Kissinger met with Chou En-lai, 
while Rogers was assigned to confer 
; fruitlessly with the 'newly appointed 
Chinese Foreign Minister, who ranks 
low in the party hierarchy. 
When the President realized that the 
exclusion of Rogers from the key meet-
ings was being interpreted at home as 
a humiliation for Rogers, he set about 
trying to restore his Secretary's pres-
tige. H cat__gin rhoetween 
Rogers a#1rattMilinlieCkrOMbilaS 
answer, and Rogers had to be satisfied 
Chou, plus a conversation on a plane. 
The President had naturally expect-
ed that he would himself have a final, 
wrap-up meeting with Mao, if only for 
ceremonial purposes. He made it clear 
that in -a second meeting he expected 
Rogers to accompany him. Again, the 
answer was dusty?and there was no 
second meeting. 
In short, there seems in retrospect to 
have been a conscious intention on the 
part of the Chinese to exclude the 
American Secretary of State from seri-
ous negotiation, and thus downgrade 
him. There are several theories. .to ex-
plain this intention. One is the obvious 
one?the Chinese believed that the real 
power of decision lay with Nixon and 
Kissinger, not with Rogers: 
SECRECY 
The Chinese may also have been de-
termined to keep the meetings as small 
as possible because they wanted to 
keep the substance of what was dis-
cussed as secret as possible?especially 
from Moscow and Hanoi. They knew 
that bringing in Rogers meant bringing 
in the State Department?and the State 
Department might leak. They may also 
have been concerned that stories pic-
turing Mao as old and unwell?which 
he is?would emerge from any larger 
meeting. 
In any case, it was the Peking mission 
that made Rogers one of Washington's 
ghosts. To see why he has become 
ghostly, it is only necessary to imagine 
President Truman taking Sidney Souers 
?the Kissinger of that era?into major 
summit negotiations and not Dean 
Acheson; or President Eisenhower tak-
ing Robert Cutler and not John Foster 
Dulles. Acheson or Dulles would have 
resigned on the spot. 
. This difficult exercise in imagination 
also suggests the low estate to which 
the Department of State has fallen. It 
has never been lower?not even when 
Joe McCarthy was snapping at Ache-
son's heels. In those days there was at 
least no doubt who was the real Secre-
tary of State and where foreign policy 
was really made. 
The low estate of the Department of 
State is a most serious matter, The Unit-
ed States does, after all, need a foreign 
office to carry on its relations with other wildly popular in the State Depart-
countries. The State Department has ment. But it is hard to think of anyone 
been ailin for years, but it is now mori- else who could make the State Depart-
e 200n1Y06 
with the dream of establishing a secret 
office of 30 people or so to run foreign 
policy while maintaining the State De-
partment as a facade in which people 
might contentedly carry papers from 
bureau to bureau." The State Depart-
ment is now precisely such a "facade" 
?except that the paper carriers are by 
no means contented. This is not surpris-
ing.. There are many able people in the 
State Department, What keeps able 
people in Washington is power, a com-
modity as important in Washington as 
money in Wall Street. The State De-
partment has been drained of all real 
power, which is why it is moribund. 
It cannot now be revived by William 
Rogers. Rogers has introduced useful 
reforms in the department. He has per-
formed usefully in other areas too?no-
tably on Capitol Hill, where he has 
been an expert pourer of oil on trou-
bled waters, and in the Middle East, 
the one foreign-policy area in which 
his influence has been real. Moreover, 
the President is clearly determined to 
."tilt" toward Rogers, in an effort to 
patch up his prestige. 
REVIVAL 
? 
But it is universally assumed that 
Rogers will leave the State Department 
fairly soon, although probably not be-
fore the election. It is this universal as-
sumption that accounts for the Secre-
tary's ghastliness. A chief subject of 
speculation is the identity of his succes-
sor. Most of the speculation centers on 
. Nelson Rockefeller or Elliot Richardson. 
. Rockefeller and Richardson are both 
strong-minded men. Neither would be 
inclined to play second -fiddle, and both 
would try hard to revive the State De-
partment. What the State Department 
needs for its revival is a Secretary of 
State with the absolute confidence of 
the President, unlimited energy and 
toughness, total mastery of the bureau-
cratic machinery, and great expertise 
in foreign policy. 
This is a tough bill to fill, and neither 
Rockefeller nor Richardson entirely fills 
it. There is one man who does?Henry 
A. Kissinger. Admittedly, it is a bit diffi-
cult to imagine a Secretary of State 
with a German accent, however faint. 
Admittedly, Henry Kissinger is not

Policy R 
? By Murrey Marder 
Washtnaton Post Staff Writer 
:Senate concern over the 
"erosion" of the State Depart-
ment's theoretical primacy in 
foreign affairs was disputed 
and brushed aside yesterday 
by Secretary of State William 
P. Rogers. 
"I am perfectly satisfied 
with the way it ; operating," 
said Rogers. The State Depart-
? ment is "happy to play a role" 
. in foreign policy, and "Mr. 
' Kissinger has a role," said Rog-
ers, but "the people elected 
the President" to "make for-
- eign policy." 
? Rogers refused in that fash-
? lion, to debate 
whether he is 
? ;being overshadowed by presi-
dential security adviser Henry 
A. Kissinger. That conformed 
with his insistence on Monday 
that, "I didn't feel excluded at 
all" during the President's 
trip to China. 
As a result, Rogers' words 
deflected the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee yester-
day from its own groping ef-
forts to enhance the State De-
partment's: share in formulat-
? ing foreign policy.. 
The .committee, headed by 
Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-
Ark.) held its first hearing , 
on $563 million requested in , 
authorization funds for the 
? State Department as required' 
by a rider it attached to last ? 
year's foreign aid act. A major ' 
purpose, as Fulbright noted 
yesterday, is "restoring Con-
gress' proper- role in the mak-
ing of foreign policy." 
With Kissinger beyond The 
official reach of the committee 
because he is a White House 
adviser, Fulbright and other 
senators hoped Rogers would 
Join in seeking to strengthen 
State's hand in policy making. 
In theory, that would 
strengthen the role of Con? 
-
gress, because State is obliged 
to be more resonsive to Con-
gress than is the White House.. 
Rogers, however, pro-
flounced himself quite satis-
fied with the status quo. 
He disclaimed , any concerni 
eferids tate e ar men 
le at Senate Heailng 
about having State Departmen 
positions lost in the National 
Security Council staff machin-
ery that Kissinger controls. If 
anything develops "contrary 
to what I think should b 
done," said Rogers, "take it u 
with the President." 
"The system is working ver, 
well," Rogers insisted. e 
foreign policy is very effec 
tive " 
Rogers also came uncle' 
close questioning yesterday 
1 about the need to jettison 
what several senators called 
(remnants of the cold war. 
Sen. Frank Church (D-I-

Southeast Asian Collective De-
fense Treaty of 1954. 
i 
The SEATO treaty is "a

abandoned by France, Britain 
and Pakistan: invoked as "an

other entanglements. 
? 
t ous" and would suggest "a bright suggested various ap- ' 
180-degree turn" in U.S. pol-
icy. 
Church countered that since 
ancient Rome, "no other coun-
e try in history has undertaken 
P so many formal commitments 
as the government of the 
Un!tei States?to 44 coun-
tries." 
Bogers also was challenged 
by Ftdbright and Sen. Stuart 
'1 Symington (D-Mo.) on adminis-
tration support of funds until. 
June 1973 for Radio Free Eu-
rope and Radio Liberty. They 
were previously financed cov-
ertly by the CIA. The dispute 
is in a Senate-House confer-
funding only until June 30 of

The U.S.-C commu-
nique, pledging peaceful co-ex- I i 
proaches for strengthening 
the State Department's posi-
tion in foreign affairs, includ 
ing a -"unified budget for for 
eign affairs." Rogers said that 
would be "too complex." Ful-

View from the fudge factory 
By David 
? Washington 
It looks the same, outwardly ? endless 
antiseptic corridors; subdued lighting; anon-
ymous doors opening into hushed offices; 
the flags and the globe and the slippery 
floor of the diplomatic entrance -on C 
Street. . . . 
This is home to that body of men and 
women whom Franklin D. Roosevelt called 
"cookie pushers," and whom John F. Ken-
nedy characterized as "those people over 
there who smile a lot"?the professional 
?-diplomatic corps of the United States. 
But the "fudge factory" .(as the State 
Department has ingloriously been dubbed) 
is not the same at all, really. To a vvitser__ 
returning after several years, it is even 
more subdued than it was in the late 'CO's. 
It feels even less in the mainstream of U.S. 
policymaking than it felt in Lyndon John-
son's day; morale is low, and the talk of 
the building is often about what might be 
done to redress the balance. 
? ? The thoughts come thick and fast as Presi-
? dent Nixon's party heads to Peking. Dip-
lomats at the State Department welcome 
Mr. Nixon's initiative toward the People's 
Republic. They want to see it succeed. Some 
of them helped in preliminary staff work, 
writing papers for Dr. Henry Kissinger and 
his national security staff. And yet, even 
those officials who would normally expect to 
know the ins and outs of evolving U.S. strat-
egy toward Peking were frank to admit in 
private conyersation a few days ago that 
they did not know the exact state of play. 
It hardly .needs 'restating: Major Ameri-
can foreign policy is formed and executed 
largely in the White House these days. The 
Kissinger staff, according to a late report, 
numbers 46 assistants, with 105 adminis-
trative personnel. Both Mr. Nixon and Dr. 
Kissinger like to plan quietly?and to move 
quickly. Neither demonstrates much regard 
for the diplomatic bureaucracy. They ask it 
. questions, but not for crucial policy recom-
mendations?or so one is led to understand. 
They do not ignore it entirely, but neither 
do they keep it informed of just who is say-
ing what to whom when Dr. Kissinger 
makes his dramatic, secret journeys: to Pe-
king, to Paris. 
Some diplomats, unsurprisingly, don't 
like it at all. No one man, or two men, no 
matter how brilliant, can cover every nu-
ance in dealings with nations such as China 
or North Vietnam, they say. Others are 
seriously concerned with the quality of 
recent appointments to the rank of ambas-
sador: former Treasury Secretary David 
Kennedy to NATO, for instance (consid-
ered by some too old, by others too inex-
perienced); Borg-Warner's Robert Inger-
soll to Tokyo (recognized, as a gracious 
businessman, an expert in business, but 
largely inexperienced in Japanese affairs 
outside business, and a newcomer to Asian 
diplomacy i ppro wad nFic? lb RedeaSt0 
play what the professionals consider an 
enormously significant part). 
K, Willis 
Granted, it is said, that Mr. Nixon has dis-
liked the Foreign Service since 1954 when 
the Republicans came to power with a fistful 
of new slogans such as "massive retalia-
tion." And Mr. Nixon was right: The pro-
fessionals didn't like him, or President 
Eisenhower, or John Foster Dulles.. But 
those days have gone. The world has 
changed. 
Issues are increasingly complex. The bu-
reaucracy of State and the Central Intelli-
gence Agency does possess expertise., built 
up over the years. True, bureaucracy grinds 
slowly?and true, it needs shaking up from 
time to time: prodding, cajoling, pushing. 
Yet, by cutting State out from the crucial 
decisions, the view maintains, the White 
House runs clear and definite risks, both 
now and for the future. 
How, then, to marry professional exper-
tise to the need of the White House to move 
fast and flexibly? One answer: the White 
House could cut in six or .seven top profes-
sional diplomats on China and Vietnam 
strategy. This could serve several purposes, 
it is said: ensure that .all? policy bases are 
covered; prevent further atrophy of State, 
which is becoming more and more cautious 
about making firm recommendations to 
Dr. Kissinger's people ("Where is Henry 
right now, while we're talking?" asked one 
source with a grin; "in Pyongyang? Could 
be . . ."), thereby lowering its standing in 
the White House still more. It could even 
help prevent "leaks" from the bureau,cracy 
of the kind that Mr. Nixon detests. Where 
no one knows anything, the argument runs, 
disgruntlement can lead to erroneous specu-
lating to friendly journalistic ears; it is 
safer, paradoxically, if a few people know 
a lot. 
Professional diplomats have deep respect 
for Dr. Kissinger, and, they say, for Mr. 
Nixon's approaches; privately, however, 
many feel that the quality of the national 
security staff does not equal the best men 
in State. The professionals acknowledge 
that State needs to find ways to keep se-
crets better?to show Mr.. Nixon that it can 
indeed be trusted. 
It asks for the chance.

THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS FUDGE 
FACTORY. By John Franklin Campbell. 
Basic Books. 298 pp. $6.95. 
AAIION EGAL 
Mr. Segal is associate professor of govern-
ment at Cornell University. 
We are living through the end of the 
American Empire. It is a painful process, 
still far from complete, that drastically 
alters the relationships between this coun-
try and the rest of the world. We are 
used to calling, the shots. We have in-
herited from the days when we were 
indisputably on top a grotesque machine 
for making foreign policy that Joseph 
? Kraft wittily dubbed "the foreign affairs 
fudge factory." 
The late. John Franklin Campbell was 
a product of that fudge factory and one 
of its most intelligent critics. He had a 
vision of a world in which the United 
States was neither dominant nor isolated, 
and in which its foreign policy was sub-
ject to rational control and direction. A 
graduate of Harvard and Berkeley, he 
I entered the U.S. Foreign Service in the 
halcyon Kennedy days when the United 
States still had a sense of world mission. 
His rapid career rise contradicted the nor-
mal pattern of a -diplomatic corps that 
has many of the symptoms of a geron-
tocracy. He served as an assistant to 
Under Secretary of State George Ball, 
and then had an assignment as U.S. con-
sul general in Asmara, Ethiopia. His 
superiors had him marked out for still 
better things and choice Washington posts 
were offered to him. 
John Campbell was a man of exuber-
ant humor. He took a temporary leave 
'of absence from the State Department to 
write. this book and to edit?the new and 
lively anti-Establishment quarterly, For-
eign Policy. His journalistic talents as 
well as his comic sense found their ap-
propriate exercise in exploding the porn-
posities of the bureaucracy in which he 
had served his apprenticeship. Yet he 
fully intended before his unexpected 
death at 31 to return to the State De-
partment and a diplomatic career. Un-
like many of his contemporaries who 
abandoned liberalism and its ideals of 
public service in disillusion, John Camp-
bell was committed to gradualism and to 
working within the system. His mind 
focused on the machinery and how to 
reform it, and he has left 'us a sturdy and 
useful book on the subject.. 
one from the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy 
to the organization experts, bereft of 
friends in Congress, and with a budget 
inadequate for its mission, the State De-
f?artment fights to get an occasional word 
in edgewise on foreign policy matters. 
Outweighed by the CIA, the Pentagon, 
the Defense Department, the National 
Security Council, and thirty other agen-
cies of the federal government who have 
permanent staff overseas, it has reacted 
to its loss of political importance with.a 
singular bureaucratic stunt: it has enor-
mously expanded its staff. The result is 
an organization that must be cut in 
half if it is ever to function effectively. 
As an insider, at once committed and 
detached, Campbell analyzes the evolu-
tion of the foreign policy-making ma-
chinery during the growth of the United 
States as a global superpower. He traces 
the effects of numerous commissions, 
studies, reforms, and Presidents which 
amount to the steady erosion of the 
power and authority of the State De-
partment, and the substitution of Presi-
dential policy making through the White 
House entourage; the last Secretary of 
State who had the ear of a President was 
John Foster Dulles. One result is an over-
emphasis on military and defense con-
siderations, which are in any case more 
than adequately represented in the Na-
tional Security Council and other White 
House channels. 
Indeed, the State Department was 
never in the bidding for control of the 
new instruments of foreign policy: in. 
Campbell's terms, the economic bureau-
cracies and the intelligence and prop- 7 
aganda complexes. The CIA and theV 
Defense Department, to name only two 
of the agencies involved, have a global 
intelligence apparatus which dwarfs that 
of State and which is in no way respon-
sible to U.S. ambassadors. The Treasury,. 
Commerce and Agriculture Departments 
have taken international economic policy 
away from State. Even the less glamorous 
task of exporting the. American ,image 
has been captured by the United States 
Information Agency. In spite of its being 
out of a job the State Departmcnt carries 
on its personnel numbers game, and uses 
its resources chiefly in make-work. 
House, physically and spiritual ; abolish 
USIA and turn over U.S. cultural pro-
grams overseas as well as the Peace 
Corps to quasi-independent agencies. The 
competing intelligence networks would 
also be made subject to State Department 
control and direction, and the National 
Security Council be confined to narrow 
military issues. Foreign economic policy 
would be coordinated in a sub-depart-
ment of State. 
It is odd that so astute an observer 
should propose to renovate State through 
executive action while bypassing Con-
gress, and fail to discuss the question of 
the caliber of the Secretary of State 
compared to that of other Presidential 
appointees. Unable to gain Congressional 
or popular support, State is in fact in-
capable of reforming itself and unwilling 
to allow others to do the job. At bottom, 
then, this thoughtful, sensible book tells 
us how to tinker with the machinery but 
leaves aside the question of where the 
vessel should be headed. The foreign 
affairs fudge factory remains intact be-
cause we are not yet ready to abandon 
the global remnants of the American 
Empire in favor of new relationships. 
Probably that policy will have to change 
before we can expect the house that it 
built to fall to the ground.' On the other 
hand, the example of the Byzantine Em-
pire shows that the trappings of power, 
including the hordes of redundant civil - 
servants, often outlive the imperial sub-
stance. When the substance itself is 
fudge, who can say how long the trap-
pings can carry on with their fudging of 
foreign affairs? 
Campbell's response to these con-
ditions was a program to resuscitate the 
State Department and make it once more 
an important instrument of foreign 
policy. He proposed a leaner department 
that would control a single U.S. foreign

EARLY three million Americans 
have now served in Vietnam. Of 
these, about 600 have been Foreign 
Service officers. 
Thus, roughly .20 percent of the 
Foreign Service has been exposed to 
many of the stimuli which have 
turned "nice" kids from Middle-
America into peace freaks, hawks, 
junkies, and even assassins. 
For the FSOs, however, the ex-
perience generally has not had the 
radicalizing effect that it has had on 
many of the military men. The 
FSOs tended to be older and less 
malleable than the American sol-
diers in Vietnam, and their personal 
thought processes were more subtle 
and less striking than those of the 
GIs. Some FSOs were essentially 
untouched by the whole experience, 
reacting no differently than if they 
had been in Paris or Rome. But for 
most, and especially the young, Viet-
nam meant change. It meant a 
violent breaking away from the tra-
ditional diplomatic life and an ex-
posure to the realities of war. 
About 350 FSOs have been as-

(CORDS). They functioned as ad-

, .From limb to time the. question is ask-cd why 
liewspapers -never seem to get anything right and 
one answer, of course, is that. we try, but that we 
arc only human. Another answer, however?and 
better that in the complex and delicate in-
terworkings of the press and the government it 
takes at least a little cooperation by the government 
ill the public is to get -aversion of events which can 
1.1roperly be said to he. right. As a case in point, we 
-would like, strictly For Your Information, to walk 
you through a brief case history involving a news 
story on Page One of The Washington Post, on 
Sept. 3, and a subsequent article on this page on 
Sept. 8. both of which asserted that the Federal 
Pureau of investigation had employed lie detector 
(polyk-sraph) tests in an investigation of State De-
parly:-;ent employees. The original story said three or 
four officials were interrogated in this fashion as 
part of ..a government-wide inquiry into a heal:. of 
.classified Mei:illation having to do with the Ameri-
CiM position kin the SALT negotiations, Today, in 
the letters space on the opposite page, FBI Director 
Hoover states categorically that both stories were 
-rtotally and completely untrue" and _that "at 310 
time did the- 1'13I use polygraphs, as allegod, in its 
investigation." Ile takes us sharply to task for "this 
-inept handling of information." 
Well, we. have looked into the matter and h. is 
clear that. we were wrong about the FBI's use or 
hic, detectors. We are pleased to have this -oppor-
tunity to express our regrets to Mr. Hoover and to 
set the record straight. But we are not prepared to 
leave it at that, if only because the implication of 
Mr. Hoover's sweeping denial ("totally and com? 
pletely untrue") is that the original story was en-
tirely wrong----that no polygraphs in fact -were used 
upon ,.-tt.ate Department employees and this is 
clearly not the case. Nor is it quite so certain whose 
handling of this information was "inept." The facts 
arc, from nfl we can gather, that polygraph jests 
were administered to State :Department officials by 
employees, and with equipment belonging to an 
V outside agency?presumably the Central intelli-
gence Agency which has these instruments avail-
r 
(1. o 
STATI NTL 
able for regular use in security checks of its own 
personnel. ? 
\ _ 
In other words, we had the -Wrong agency, which 
is an important error and one we would have been 
happy to correct immediately, before it had been 
compounded in the 'subsequent article on Sept. 8, 
if somebody in the 'government had chosen to speak 
up. But the FPI was silent until Mr. Hoover's letter 
arrived 1.0 days later, and Secretary of State Rogers,. 
who was asked about the story at a press conference' 
on Sept. 3 in -a half-dozen different ways, adroitly 
avoided a yes-br-no answer every time. 'That is to 
say, he did not confirm the role of the. Fill', but 
neither elid Ile deny it; he simply refused to discuss 
meth,ods,-,thile upholding the utility of lie-detector 
test S in-establishing, probable innocence, if not prob-
able guilt. And that remains the State Department's 
position, even in the face of Mr. Hoover's denial.. 
No Clarification, no confirmation, no.-comment--
despite the fact that the original story in. The Post 
had been chocked with the State Department and 
the role of the FBI had been confirmed by an offi-
cial spokesman on those familiar anonymous, not-
for-attribution terms which government officials 
resort to when they don't want to take responsibility 
publicly for what they say, and which newspaper 
reporters yield to when there is no other way to 
attribute assertions of far.kt. 
The result or this protracted flim.-11;kin was, first. 
of all, to leave the Justice Department and the FBI 
falsely accused of administering lie detectors to: 
officials of another agency, and then, with 1`.1r. 
Hoover's denial, to leak.'e the impression that no 
polygraphs were used at all, and you have to ask 
yourself what public interest is served by having 
tins sort of misinformation circulating around, gath-
ering credence. It is not an uncommon practice, of 
course, for the government, when it is confronted 
in print with an embarrassing and not altogether 
accurate news story, to clam up completely rather 
than help straighten ;out inaccuracies-- especially 
when clarification risks confirmation of that part of 
the story which is accurate. hut ii is not a practice 
that does much to further public knowledge. And. 
still less does it help the newspapers get things 
right.

My attention has been called to an article 
entitled "FBI Uses ?Li.e Test3 in Probe of

September 3, 1971, issue of true l'.:?ashington 
Post and a column, "Fxtracting the Truth: 
Tea Leaves or Polygraph Tests?'? by Alan. 
Barth on September 7, 1971. Both' of these 
ROMS .eatecorically assert. that the-TPA used 
.polygraphs during an Investigation of al: 
leged "leaks" of confidential information at 
the Departutent or State. 
These statements 1%7' Messrs. Marder and 
Earth that the FBI used polygrc.pbs .in this 
investigation are totally and comp-Wtely un-
true.. 
For the information of your readers, the, 
Dopartmerat of Justice on July 30, 1971, in-
. qructed the FBI to conduct a complete in-
vestigation, which entailed rOfilc: interviews 
at the Department 'of State, with regard to 
,alleged unauthori-Led disclosure of classified 
information as a potential violation of the 
espionage laws. We?innuediately instituted 
Ofl i51vestition,141 complisnce with thej)c- ?

" at no time did the FBI use polygraphs, as al-
leged, in its investigation. 
Surely, it is. in the interest  of responsible 
journalism that the basic facts be accurately 
,and. honestly reported. 'I.'his inept handlin-,!,

takes silong exception to both the tone and 
content of the article by Alan Barth on. the 
editorhl page of titli.e* Post On September 7. 
We are disappointed that a paper Of the 
stature of The Post saw fit to dignify with 
publication the compendium of half truths, 
untruths, and rather sophomoric sarcasm 
rePrest'uted by Mr. Barth's -article. We pre 
perhaps naive, knowing that alto Post has 
never been a believer in the polygraph but 
we assert our profound eonvietion that you 
should require factual accuracy, even from 
Nvriteis on your opinion pages. 
Mr. Barth closes with the comment that 
polygraph test is so insulting:, so demeaning 
and. so limn-Hinting, that anyone who Vmuld! 
either administer nr submit to such en ex-
amination is unfit to, represent the United 
liospite his assertion that this can be 
'taken for granted, the ABA believes that 
such strong statements should require some 
modicum of proof. Exactly why a person is 
humiliated, demeaned, and insulted by lining 
given an opportunity to establish 111.; inno-
cence'of serious charges is bayond our corn-
prehension. 
Mr. Barth apparently delights in' esoterie. 
knowlode of variotu..? forms of ord04,,1 but 
conveniently ignores the fact that it was just 
because of such in6Ahods of soothsaying that 
the polygraph was developed. We of the 
ABA would rather stake judgment of our 
veracity upon the objective analysis of a set 
of polygraph charts than upon the swirl of 
tea leaves, even whoh stirred by a person of 
17.if e r- ? ' 
such perception and sensitivity as Mr. Barth, 
We find ourselves troubled by vicious at-
tacks such as those by Mr. "P..t.rth, because 
noWhere does beset forth a :-iy..;tein to re-
place the. one which he is attacking, lie ap-
patently is establishing a new constitutional 
priyilege: The right to lie with impunity. 
Mr. Barth and ethers of his ilk would bar 
effective investigation, would bar psycbs)10;-:,. 
ical testing, would bar polygraph examina-
lions, and would, in general, bar any _means 
thus far developed for getting at truth in 
matters of controversy. 
it is a fact, for example, that even &Arne-
'cors et' polygraph testing concede minimal 
accuracy of the technique to be in the 70 per 
'cent 'nage. Other scientists of impecable 
Icredentiels, which far exceed the:,,, (.2 thr,s, 
APA and certainly Mr. Earth, have es-
tablished accuracy of the. techni slue in. the 90 
per cent range. With all due modesty the 
APA believes that this may oven exceed the 
accuracy of journalistic repoi-ting. 
The recent statement by the SecqvAary of 
State that be believes the poly.su.aph can be 
effiective in clearing the innocent but not in 
identifying the guilty, though somewhat par-
adoxical, is acceptable to the APA. We have 
always belie', adthat the greatest service our 
members can perform is that of assisting 
persons who are falsely'accused in establish-

WASHINGTON, Sept. 2 ? 
State Department personnel are 
being questioned by agents of 
the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation in an effort to determine 
how recent sensitive informa-
tion leaked to the press, the 
department's press spokesman 
disclosed today. 
\ The spokesman, Robert J. 
McCloskey, said in response to 
reporters' questions at a press 
briefing, that the investigation 
had been prompted by concern 
that "stories 'harmful to the na-
tional interest" were being dis-

!officials lie-detector tests in

the news leaks, 
Mr. McCloskey said the FALL 
questioning was ? being done 
"with the approval of the See-
'rotary of State," but be de.-

Powell Moore, an official in 
the Justice Department's infor-
mation office, said that the in-
iyehstigation had been ordered 
by that department's Internal 
Security Division.

The State Department has ts 
own security force that is sup! 
Posed to hives Ligate security 
leaks. 
In recent weeks newsmen 
who report on the State De-
partment have found that peo-
ple there would not see them or 
answer their telephone calls. 
Today, at his regular noon 
briefing, Mr. McCloskey was 
asked a series of questions 
about the investigation and 
other official actions that have 
apparently prompted' officials 
to close their doors to the 
press. 
Taboos Conceded 
Mr. McCloskey. conceded 
that certain subjects had been 
temporarily placed off limits 
for discussion with the press. 
by State Department personnel. 
These include President Nixon's,' 
coming trip to China and thel 
one-man election campaign of 
South - Vietnam's President 
Nguyen Van Thieu. 
But Mr. McCloskey insisted, 
have told them that people 
need not close doors or refuse. 
to return phone calls because 
a subject for a period may be 
off limits for general distribu-
tion." He said there had been 
no efforts to limit "contacts" 
between State Department per-
sonnel and the press, but only 
? to persuade officials to "use 
their common sense in dealing 
with the journalists." --
"The State Department has a' 
deep concern, and I would ex-
pect the public in general would 
understand, that information 
that could be prejudicial to the 
national interest in foreign pol-
icy is not to he published or 
broadcast," Mr. McCloskey 
said. 
Times Article Mentioned 
- He said that F.B.I. agents had 
approached State Department 
officials "on a number of .oc-
casions," but he would not say 
what news articles had been, 
involved. 
Some individAls who were. 
questioned said that the agents 
asked about an article by Wil-
liam Beecher in The New York. 
Times of july 22, giving details 
of United States negotiators' 
positions in the arms limita-
tions talks with the Soviet 
Union. . 
Others were asked about an 
earlier article by Tad Szulc in 
The New York Times about 
arms shpiments to Pakistan. 
Mr. McCloskey said, ''To the 
best of my knowledge, no dis-
ciplinary action has been taken 
against any person ques-
tioned." Asked if a reprimand 
or notation placed in a Foreign. 
Service officer's re-cord was a 
disciplinary action, he said 
that such a reprimand would 
not necessarily be considered 
a disciplinary action.

news briefing that Justice 
Department agents investi-

McCloskey said "this has

"harmful to the national inter-

McCloskey said in response 
to .questions that State Depart-
ment officials have been ad-
vised with renewed emphasis 
recently "to use their common 
sense and discretion" in talk-
ing with newsmen about sensi-
tive security subjects. But he 
-denied that any "written in-
structions" have been circu-
lated to restrict press contact 
with officials.

smaller number, "about three

Secretary of. State William Rogers is allow-
ing to stand, without denial, a published report 
that he has ordered State Department officials 
td refrain from putting anything in writing 
that might embarrass the White house. 
The coincides with the fact that the State 
Department's views on a broad range (4 
American foreign policies are being conveyed 
to the public these days with two simple words 
? "Do comment." 
Part of this turn of events may be the out-
come of the recent publication of the "Penta-
gon papers" with their disclosure of embar-
rassing views held by White. House, State De-
partment, Defense Department and CIA offi-
cials.-
. Fut it also is a result of the exclusion of the 
itate Departmet from participation in many 
--majc.!-7 decisions, such .as those on China, Viet-
nam and dc.valuation of the dollar. 
REFUSE, TO COMMENT 
Frustrated spokesmen for the Slate Depart-
ment, who used to pride theMselvcs on not 
resorting to "no comment" even tho they 
didn't say much; 110W systematically use that 
phrase in response to questions on almost all 
important subjects. 
'Yesterday's State Department briefing was 
typical. Department spokesmen Robert Mc-
Closkey ten the "no- comment' route eight 
different times on as many subjects. 
Mr. McCloskey's reputation for keep his cool 
in difficult circumstances also was blown at 
one point?on the subject of China. 
The day after President Nixon announced 
his plan to 20 to Peking, the State Department 
spokesman told reporters the White House had 
forbidden the department to discuss the sub-
ject of China. 
?A, reporter asked Mr. McCloskey yesterday 
whether there had been any contacts between 
Washington and Peking officials since the Pe-
king visit of Nixon's national security adviser 
Dr. Henry Kissinger. 
"No comment," Mrs. McCloskey replied. 
Asked wh-ethcr the "no comment" was be-
STATINTL 
cause of the White 'House embargo on discus-
sion of China still stood or because there 
might have been some contacts, Mr. Mc-
Closkey said it was primarily because of the '.-
former, .? 
"That means the State Department is sill) 
not allowed .to talk about China?" a reporter 
asked. . 
INTERUPTS WITH .SHOUT 
After a pause; Mr. McCloskey replied: "Al] 
right. lii let it go." 
Another reporter replied: "All right. Fil let. 
it go." , ? 
Another reporter started to ask: "Bob, en 
the same subject . ..?" 
Interrupting with a shout, Mr. McCloskey 
said:. "I'll let it go," 
Asked then about the published report that 
Mr. Rogers has informed officials of the de-
partment not to put anything in writing that ? 
might embarrass the White House Mr. Mc-
Closkey _snapped: "no comment." - 
The reporter was referring to a column by 
Rowland Evans and Robert Novak .which said 
the White House was isolating itself frOm the 
professional career officer in the State Depart-
ment. 
The column said Mr. Rogers had laid dotvn 
new rules en. secrecy as a result of "Mr. Nix-

State's Secrets 
The Pentagon, it seems, was not the 
only Government department to make. 
a top-secret retrospective study of the na-
tion's decisions in Viet Nam. In 1968 
Tom Hughes, then director of the State t./ 
Department's Bureau of Intelligence and 
Research, ordered another report, far 
less voluminous and ambitious but with 
considerable potential ithpact. 
Composed by two State Department 
Asia analysts, the study compared the 
Kennedy and Johnson Administrations' 
key 'Viet Nam decisions with the bu-
reau's own major judgments during the 
same period. In almost every case, the in-
telligence reports called the shots per-
fectly about such matters as the ineffec-
tiveness of the bombing campaign, Viet-
namese political upheavals and North 
Vietnamese troop buildups. Daniel Ells-
berg is said to have read the study as a 
consultant for Henry Kissinger in 1969 
and reacted: "My God, this is astonish-
ing. I thought the CIA stuff was great, but 
these papers are even more accurate." 
After publication of the Pentagon pa-
pers, the two known copies of the State 
Department study have been locked 
away, and Ray Cline, the intelligence bu-
reau's current director, has forbidden 
subordinates to admit their existence.

State began to decline in President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's time throngi 
his use. of personal and, to a large ex 
tent, mili tau diplomacy. The MeCarth 
era subdued State's-personnel into cau 
? tious conformists, relegating .some o 
its ablest officers to oblivion. Moral 
and performance suffered further from 
.arbitrary reforms from the outside, in-
cluding efficiency-expert methods that 
could not possibly assess the quality 
of professional knowledge, negotiating 
skill, or political judgment. 
Moreover, State's budget and ex-
pense account continued to be small 
compared with many other agencies 
in the field, as well as the diplomatic 
services of other big countries. (Not so 
long ago, the American ambassador in 
Bonn had at his disposal for personal 
expenses and entertainment one-third 
of what the West German ambas-
sador spent in Washington.) State, for 
instance, must rely on another govern-
- ment agency for financing its communi-
cations abroad. And State, in common 
with other dePartments, is caught up 
in the habit of multiplying and com-
plicating its structure with inter-this 
? and inter-that committee, meetings, 
clearances, and the rest.

Li What's wrong with the State Depart-
ment? This question has rung like an 
echoing gong down the decades. It has 
been asked by Presidents, by the pub-
lic, and by almost everyone in the State 
Department itself. John Campbell's 
book provides a full and reasoned an-
swer, forthrightly written and con-
vincingly documented. Despite the title, 
the problem is handled in The Foreign 
-Affairs Fudge Factory with sympathy 
and insight. 
The basic malady is the growth of a 
monstrous foreign affairs apparatus 
that has overwhelmed the State De-
partment and its control of?and voice 
in?foreign policy decisions. The De-
fense Department and the Agency for 
International Development, for exam-

ciency. Foreign officifils never cease 
wondering what precise government in

dated emissary is speaking for, or on 
whose exact behalf there he is spending 
money. - 
The author of this well-grounded, 
perceptive study realizes that what is 
wrong cannot be put right at one 
stroke, or even by one President. But, 
basing his thesis on past criticism as 
well as on his own experience in the 
Foreign Service, he calls for a num-
ber of specific, workable reforms that 
could gradually bring order, intelli-

to the making of modern American 
foreign policy.

THE. ECLIPSE OF THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT 
By Dean Zcheson 
? 
TiOR over a decade it has been received as accepted truth in 
the highly charged political atmosphere of Washington that 
" the role, power and prestige of the Secretary and Depart-
ment of State in the conduct of foreign affairs have steadily de-
clined. Accompanying this decline, and accused of causing it, is 
said to have been an increasing part played by the President 
himself in this alluring, fashionable and important activity, 
accentuated, perhaps, by the appearance in the White House of 
a court favorite--a modern Leicester, Essex or Buckingham--
served by over a hundred attendants and constantly advising the 
monarch on these matters in the antechamber. The New York 
Times, in a series of articles published in January 1971, dates. 
'these developments from FDR's time, though adding that the 
trend was arrested "during the Truman and Eisenhower years 
[until] the death of John Foster Dulles in 1959." 
Opinions have differed widely whether the eclipse noted is 
total or partial, radical and sinister, or within constitutional 
limits and historical precedents in relations between presidents 
and the first state secretary and dep'artment created by the first 
Congress. A great deal of the resulting debate has been based on 
wholly erroneous ideas of the nature and source of the national 
power to conduct foreign affairs, so we might do well ?to get this 
, straight before going further. 
II 
The Supreme Court has left no doubt that the federal power 
over external affairs--unlike the power over internal affairs?
is not the creature of the Constitution. The Union, it has pointed 
out, existed before the Constitution, and, with independence from 
Britain, the power to act "in the vast external realm" passed from 
the British Crown to the corporate unity, the United States of 
America. The Constitution strictly limited participation in the 
exercise of this power. "The President alone has the power to 
speak or listen as a representative of the nation. He makes treaties 
?with the advice and consent of the Senate; but he alone nego-
tiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and 
Congress itself is powerless to invade it." The Court quotes the 
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as reporting to the 
Senate on March 7, 1800: " . . the President is the constitu-
tional representative of the United States with regard to foreign 
nations. He manages our concerns with foreign nations and must 
necessarily be most competent to determine when, how, and upon 
what subjects negotiation may be urged with the greatest pros-
pect of success. For his conduct he is responsible to the Constitu-
tion. The committee consider this responsibility the surest pledge

concerned have a right to return 
to these personal files for any 
memoirs or articles they may be 
writing. 
So it is today with William 
Bundy. He has been 'given use 
of a corner in room 5310 of the 
State Department. 
Something like two of the 10 
filing cabinets in the room are 
his, 'that is open to him and 
his secretary, Blanche Moore, 
whom he has kept on at .his 
own expense. 
Bundy is writing a book about 
the same subject as the Penta-
gon subject?the history of the 
policy-making process on . Viet-
nam. 
N at ur all y, these archives 
would be of great use to him. 
Bundy, who is now visiting Lon-
don and works out of the Center 
of International Studies of MIT 
in Boston, is reported to make. 
frequent use of his files here. 
Sometimes he comes to room 
5310 three times a week. 
When the book is completed, 
Bundy?lihe all other former de-
partment officials?will have to 
have it cleared by the Historical 
Office of the State Department. 
There its pages will be gone 
over to make certain no classi-
fied material in the .personal 
files is going into print. 
Security people in the State 
Department are still musing 
over how two copies of the mam-
moth Pentagon archives on Viet-
nam policy could have been in 
the State Department without 
anyone in authority knowing it. 
It took Secretary of State Wil-
liam P. Roger's staff about 48 
hours to find the copies of the 
47-volume studies. 
The reason ? they had gone 
directly into the "personal files" 
of former Undersecretary of 
State Nicholas deB. Katzenbach 
and William Bundy, key depart-
/ mcnt aide on Vietnam under 
President Johnson. Two copies 
? from the 15 made ? were 
sent by the Pentagon by person-
al courier, outside official ellen-
nels, to both men toward the end 
of the past administration in 
1988. 
?The volumes were not regis-
tered with the central filing of-
flee of the department. They 
were not gone through by the 
security office to cheek whether 
any documents needed to be du-
plicated for the department's 
own files. They were put under 
lock and key in the filing cabi-
nets of Katzenbach and Bundy, 
tiiho ? in the haste of the transi-
tion -- neglected to tell their 
successors of their existence.
