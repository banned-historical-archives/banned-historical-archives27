 EXTENSION OF. REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RALPH YARBOROUGH
 OF TEXAS         -
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, March 4, 1965
 Mr. YARBOROUGH,  Mr. President,
 Austin, Tex., my home city, the site of
 the State capital of Texas, has been, and
 is presently enjoying a physical, eco-
 nomic, and intellectual growth of phe-
 nomenal proportions.
 The population of Austin, Tex., has
 doubled in the last 20 years; the en-
 rollment at the University of Texas, lo-
 cated there, has tripled in the last 30
 years;' and the area of the city has al-
 Most doubled in the last 20 years.
 To illustrate the tone of the city in
 combining the nostalgic, historical past
 and the dynamic facelifting of_the pres-
 ent, I ask unanimous consent that an
 article from the Dallas Morning News
 of  Saturday,' February  27,  1965, be
 printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:  ,
 AUSTIN:  HISTORIC  PAST,  DYNAMIC  PRESENT
 (By Allen Duckworth)
 AUSTIN, TEx.-This pearl of central Texas-
 the. State's beautiful capital city-has a his-
 toric and,, dramatic past, a dynamic present,
 an exciting future.
 Most every community in the world has
 an outstanding feature.  But Austin has
 nearly everything you can think of except
 ocean steamers, an active volcano, and a
 glacier.
 The phenomenal growth of Austin out-
 strips most of the state capitals of the
 Nation.
 There are many reasons.
 The State government has grown and will
 continue to grow.
 Recreation and tourism are already big
 businesses.  There are seven-big, beautiful
 lakes on the Colorado River, created by a
 series of dams, and all within a few minutes
 or a few hours of downtown Austin.  And
 the Austin Chamber of Commerce is coaxing
 tourists to "L,B.J. Land" with maps showing
 how to view the President's Texas White
 House, only 60 miles to the west.  Of course,
 the chamber of commerce suggests spending
 the night at an Austin hotel or motel.
 In education, Austin calls itself the brain
 center of the State.  The University of Texas
 enrollment has risen from 7,000 to 24,000
 14 the last 30. years.  There also are St.
 Edward's  University,   Concordia  College,
 Huston-Tillotson College, and the Presby-
 terian Theological College.
 Research centers, both government and
 private, are tied closely to the university.
 The Balcones Research Center has 22 labs
 in operation, some of them doing top-secret
 work.  Want to know how to pack a heavy
 truck for parachuting to earth from an air-
 plane?                          They can  tell  you.  Really.  This
 center occupies  a 393-acre  tract  and 34
 buildings,
 A de artmen      of the university does re-
 searchot variqus agencies of the U.S. De-
 partment of Defense.                              And a number of
 private research outfits are doig contract
 work fpr the Qgvernment.  There's another
 lab that builds yip evidence against law vio-
 lators, such as folks who poison their mates.
 Private  research  organizations  include
 electronics, chemicals, petrochemicals, pre-   ing, now a museum, patterned by a Euro-
 cision instruments, gravity meters, hydraul-                                                                                       pean architect In, exile after a Rhine River
 with the Government labs, this adds up to a
 major industry for Austin.
 Bergstrom Field, a short expressway drive
 to the southeast, is a Strategic Air Command
 base.  World leaders have landed there to be
 guests of President Johnson at his ranch.
 The President himself often arrives there en
 route to his Texas White House.
 The capital city is wonderfully located.
 It is easy driving time to almost any spot
 in the State, with the exception of El Paso,
 593 miles away.  Austin is within 197 miles
 of Dallas, 190 of Fort Worth, 273 of Orange,
 161 of Houston, 286 of Wichita Falls, 351 of
 Texarkana, 277 of Marshall, 139 of Corpus
 Christi, 76 of San Antonio, 231 of Laredo on
 the Mexican border, 329 of Brownsville, 361
 of Odessa.
 Since World War IT, a new airport terminal
 has replaced the old wooden shack which
 once served the city.  The thousand-acre air-
 port with 12,500 yards of paved concrete ramp
 space has 24-hour service 7 days a week.  Be-
 sides the more than 30 flights a day, there are
 45 bus arrivals and departures, 8 trucklines
 in and out of the_ city, 3 freight railways.
 Livability,  says  the Austin Chamber of
 Commerce, is a major attraction which con-
 tributes to the soaring population total.
 Many of those who come to Austin as public
 officials, from Governors to legislators, former
 military  personnel,  university  graduates,
 decide to make Austin their home.     Former
 Governors whose homes were in other cities,
 before election now living in Austin are Dan
 Moody, Allan Shivers, Price Daniel.
 Recreation facilities apparently are unlim-
 ited.  The city government maintains 37
 parks and playgrounds, 21 free neighborhood
 swimming pools, 5 municipal pools, 4 com-
 munity recreation centers, 8 athletic fields, 2
 municipal golf courses and a tennis center.
 And there's the beautiful Austin Country
 Club.   Southwest  Conference  football  is
 played in the university's Memorial Stadium.
 The seven manmade lakes start at Austin's
 city limits and chain northward for 160 miles
 in the Colorado River's wonderland of hills
 and valleys.   These lakes provide fishing,
 boating, water sports, hunting or just loafing
 in some of the luxury or rustic lodges.  The
 dams also are for hydroelectric power and
 flood control.
 Climate usually is ideal.  The city's unique
 location on the Balcones Escarpment from
 the Edwards Plateau distinguishes it from
 the climate of the surrounding area. Normal
 temperature averages 68.2 degrees.  Heating
 and cooling home expenses are reasonable
 because the city is protected to some extent
 from chill winds to the north and humidity
 from the south.
 Those seeking a home or homesite have a
 variety of locations, ranging from grass-cov-
 ered plains to tree-studded hills-new addi-
 tions within the city, estates high in the
 hills or on a lakefront.
 A cultural and entertainment atmosphere
 prevails.  Locally, there is the Austin Sym-
 phony Orchestra, the civic theater, art ex-
 hibits, university lecture series.  The cul-
 tural entertainment committee books operas,
 plays, concerts.
 Fine churches are available for worship by
 those of most any faith in the land.
 Austin has been a beautiful place from the
 beginning.  There was a hamlet in the val-
 ley when  they started building  the  first
 capitol there for the Republic of Texas in
 1840.  It was a two-room log building, sur-
 rounded by a 10-foot log stockade and a moat
 to discourage unfriendly Indians from dis-
 turbing the house and senate.
 The early days of statehood were filled with
 romance.  A German prince once arrived, in
 shining armor, to apply for public lands upon
 which  to establish  a  colony.  O.  Henry
 studio in Austin and there created a master-
 piece which can be seen in the State ceme-
 tery, resting place of hundreds of heroic Con-
 federate dead and some of Texas' great, near-
 great, and not so great--the full-size supine
 statue of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston on his
 bier.
 The French Legation of Republic days is
 still there.  The French Minister, Count Al-
 phonse de Saligny, was quite a problem child
 in olden times.  He complained about the
 pigs in his neighborhood, running at will
 over his garden.
 Austin's growth has been steady from the
 beginning.  But the near-sensational boom
 began after the end of World War II in 1945-
 20 years ago.
 Some statistics:
 The population of Austin in 1945 was esti-
 mated at 110,000.  Today, the estimate of the
 metropolitan area is in excess of 250,000.
 Bank deposits at the beginning of 1945
 were $46,571,522. Last January 1 they were
 $430,701,650, or a 20-year increase of 824.8
 percent.
 In 1945, Austin city limits covered 36.10
 square miles.  Last figures (June 18, 1964)
 showed 59.02 square miles.
 What was Austin like 20 years ago?  And
 what are some comparisons?
 I was assigned to help to report the goings-
 on of the legislature in 1945.   Getting to
 Austin was a tedious drive from Dallas. The
 highway was just a plain two-way traffic
 deal, with slowdowns through many towns
 or villages.  When you finally made the city
 limits, you had to negotiate around the north
 of town, past the State hospital (for mental-
 ly ill), down the university "drag."                                                                                                                                       Today,
 the freeway is almost completed from Dallas
 to the capital.  Already, you can take routes
 that  bypass  such  towns  as Waxahachie,
 Hillsboro,  Waco, Temple,  Belton,  Round
 Rock.  And when you get to Austin, in the
 event you are going on to San Antonio and
 do not desire to stop off, the freeway takes
 you-elevated  part  of  the way-right  on
 through the downtown and suburban area.
 Parking was no problem in 1945.  You just
 left your car for the night in front of your
 Austin hotel. Today, at noontime, you may
 find it difficult to enter a downtown park-
 ing station in the hotel area.  And look out
 for women-today's Austin Police Depart-
 ment employs uniformed girls to put those
 parking violation notices under your wind-
 shield wiper.   They do it without fear or
 favor of those having State official license
 plates, such as members of the legislature.
 The capital had only two hotels which
 could be classified as of the first class, the
 historic Driskill and the late W. L. Moody's
 Stephen F. Austin.  A favorite eating place
 was the Millett Mansion, an ancient native
 stone-and-timber two-story structure where
 you could get a good family-style lunch for
 75 cents.  Today, Austin has some of the Na-
 tion's finest accommodations for travelers.
 A new downtown hotel is the Commodore
 Perry.  The Driskill and the Stephen F. Aus-
 tin                                                                                                                                      have       modernized.  Before  war's  end,
 there were no motels to speak of, just some
 "tourist courts."  Today, Austin has some of
 the  Nation's  finest,  chains  and privately
 owned.  There's a downtown motor-- hotel
 abuilding, just a slingshot from the capitol
 grounds-the Downtowner.  Two of Austin's
 motor inns are unique.  The Terrace, an
 early postwar project, was erected on the
 old San Antonio highway across the Colo-
 rado River to the south, on a hillside, with
 winding roads and paths. Opened only a
 few years ago is the Gondolier, on the beau-
 tified and parklike south banks of the Colo-
 rado.

 Austin had no luxury clubs, of the cocktail-     They include-such groups as the American
 gourmet type, after the war.  Today, the  Legion, State bar, butane dealers, classroom
 town has a club at about every turn of the teachers, council of churches, electric coop-

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN BRADEMAS
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 18, 1965
 Mr. BBADEMAS.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 pleased to call to the attention of my
 colleagues and appropriate officials of
 the State Department a thoughtful edi-
 torial concerning the State Department
 white paper on Vietnam.  The editorial
 appeared in the South Bend, Ind., Trib-
 une on March 2.  The editorial follows:
 WHITE PAPER SAYS IT WELL
 The State Department white paper on
 Vietnam is all the more useful because of its
 timing.                              For it comes when there is mount-
 ing pressure from various quarters to gen-
 erate negotiations for ending the conflict.
 And it is highly important, as the State De-
 partment noted, "for freemen to know what
 has been happening in Vietnam, and how,
 and why."
 In  the  circumstances,  it Is  incumbent
 upon the United States to make clear to the
 world the reasons for Its involvement in the
 struggle and to deal with the criticism of the
 American role.
 The document, it seems to us, does an
 admirable job on both scores.
 It refutes the Communist line that the
 conflict is a civil war and shows it for what
 it really is-a carefully planned and exe-
 cuted aggression from the north aided and
 abetted by Red China and others in the
 Communist camp.
 The evidence is damning.
 Another important reason for issuing the
 paper is the continuing need to keep the
 world informed of the reasons for the Amer-
 ican presence in South Vietnam.
 As the paper notes, we are there because
 our help has been requested by the duly
 constituted government.  And it notes, the
 United States "will not abandon friends who
 want to remain free."
 The paper says that the United States
 would be ready at once to reduce its military
 involvement if peace could be restored, but
 adds significantly "the choice now between
 peace and continued and increasingly de-
 structive conflict is one for the authorities
 Yes, I am the United States of America and  vide lump-sum payment for the unused

 many areas, such as ice prediction, fisheries,
 engineering applications and coastal con-
 trol, they are doing very well.
 In summary, the Soviet oceanographic
 program is massive and slanted toward prac-
 tical  applications.' It Is being carried out
 by large numbers of average people, led by
 top-flight scientists, under the disadvantage
 of commonplace equipment and poor work-
 ing conditions.  Significant advances have
 been made in the last 20 years and the trend
 will doubtless continue.
 Comparison of  the  Soviet and  United
 States efforts is difficult, since basic differ-
 ences exist.  The Soviets stress applications
 and give research a back seat; we pour the
 bulk of our resources into research, and all
 too often pay only lipservice to useful prod-
 nets.                  At the present moment, it would seem
 that Russia is getting as much for their
 money as we are, in the form of practical
 applications.  They seem to lack a strong
 program of fundamental research which is
 clearly necessary to provide the basis for
 achievements a decade or generation in the
 future.  Their shortsightedness in this re-
 gard will sap their strength, surely and soon.
 It  would  be, equally shortsighted of the
 United States to neglect those phases of its
 own effort which are lagging, such as educa-
 tion, shipbuilding, and the development of
 practical applications.  This visit provided
 the opportunity to see a part of the Soviet
 program.  Perhaps   even   more  important
 than that is the opportunity to see the
 U.S. program in a new context, so that we can
 correct our weaknesses and take advantage
 of our strengths.
 The War in Vietnam, VqI-1tickshaw

 OF
 HON. THADDEUS J. DULSKI'
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 4, 1965
 Mr. DULSKI.    Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks, I include the
 eighth in a series of the report by Lucian
 C. Warren, Washington correspondent
 for the Courier-Express, Buffalo, N.Y.,
 on his tour of Vietnam.
 Part VIII, which appeared in the Cou-

 THE WAa IN VIETNAM, VIII-RICKSHAW AWE
 Is No BARGAIN
 (NOTE: Saigon, command post of a thor-
 oughly 20th century war, is an old city that
 retains many of its quaint Asian customs.
 One of these is the rickshaw, that ancient
 surrey with the fringe on top whose human
 "horse" have been swindling the gullible for
 centuries. Here Lucian C. Warren, Washing-
 ton correspondent for the Courier-Express,
 gets taken for a ride by one of these pic-
 turesque pirates.)
 SAIGON,-Coverage of the war in Vietnam is
 strewn With obstacles, not all of the Vietcong
 making.
 On a Fund&y afternoon in Saigon, another
 Department of Defense-sponsored newsman
 Hgrl2ert Brubaker, and I decided, that now
 would be a good time to get the Buddhist
 point of view. The Buddhists are thoroughly
 mixed ul~ in Vietnamese politics and have
 contributed more, than their sharp of insta
 bility to the government.
 NQT DISSUADED
 A U.S. Embassy man tried to dissuade us,
 saying that Sunday was just as much a day
 of rest for the Buddhist as it is for the
 Christian.  But he said that with good luck
 we might find someone who would talk with
 us at the Buddhist Institute on Tran Quoc
 Toan Avenue.
 We took a chance and set off on our
 mission.
 It was a beautiful day and it seemed like
 a good idea at the time to hire two rick-
 shaws to taxi us to our destination.
 INSTRUCTIONS
 A Saigon policeman who seemed to know
 a little English was told where we wanted to
 go and instructed the rickshaw operators.
 Asked how much we should pay our drivers,
 the policeman said 10 piastres apiece.
 A piastre is worth about 14 cents, and the
 fare seemed reasonable.
 So we-set off on our merry way, up one
 street and down another, dallying not long
 on Dal Lo Le Lo Boulevard, or Gia Long
 Street, and not even getting hung up on
 Hong Thap Tu Road, despite fierce traffic.
 TROUBLES START
 We arrived soon at what we thought was
 the institute and our troubles began.  The
 rickshaw drivers squealed their displeasure
 at the proffered 10 piasters, so reluctantly
 and foolishly we tossed them five more apiece
 -7 cents more to buy a little peace.  It not
 only brought peace but the drivers amiably
 conducted us on a tour of the place.
 It was a beautiful place.  All the rich trap-
 pings of a pagoda-Buddha with the many
 arms, incense, teakwood, jade, and the kneel-
 ing devout-were on view.
 Come to find out, however, it was a pagoda
 and not the Buddhist Institute.  Laboriously
 we searched up and down for someone who
 could speak and read a little English, and
 after about 10 minutes found one who told
 our  rickshaw  friends  that  the  place  we
 wanted to go to was on Tran Quoc Toan
 Avenue.
 OFF AGAIN
 It's highly possible that those sly little ras-
 cals knew all along they had taken us to the
 wrong place, and it would have been well
 for us at this point to have hired one of the
 metered motorcabs.
 But Confucius say there's no fool like an
 occidental fool, or he ought to have said it.
 Anyway, we clambered aboard again and were
 oft.
 As near as I could later make out from a
 map, we got to Tran Quoc Toan Avenue via
 Chua Huyen Tran, Ba Huyen Thank Quang,
 Phan Dinh Phung, and Phan Thank Giang
 Streets but I'm a little uncertain that was
 the precise route.
 MORE DEMANDS
 It is fair to State, I guess, that we planned
 out all over the city, so long did it take to
 arrive at our destination.
 This time, it seems, we finally had ar-
 rived at the                                                                                                         Buddhist Institute and now
 came a haggling by our rickshaw drivers
 that would have made Shylock green with
 envy.
 ...Those oriental thieves wanted 50 plasters
 apiece.   In vain  we  argued and  shouted.
 The more we argued the greater grew the
 crowd.
 It might well have turned into a street
 riot, hence we paid off.
 It took 20 minutes to find someone who
 spoke English at the institute.  At this point
 we learned that the U.S. Embassy man was
 right, no official at the institute was present.
 "Come back last week," said a man in
 broken English, who was scornfully.corrected
 by another who suggested we try in 2 days.
 SWITCH TO CAB
 We were, however, not so foolish as to
 play the rickshaw roulette game on the way
 back.
 We hired a small, metered cab and for a
 grand total of only 20 plasters, including tip,
 we were back In our hotel in nothing flat.
 We had not gained the slightest knowledge
 of Buddhist politics and, consideren  our

 total outlay of time and money, the after-
 noon  could  only  by  considered  its                                             most

 Tribute to Mrs. Marie C. McGuire, First
 Woman Chief of Public Housing
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RALPH YARBOROUGH
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, March 4, 1965
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr. President,
 with the proposed creation of a new Cab-
 inet post in the field of housing and
 urban affairs, attention has been focused
 on the importance of having qualified,
 imaginative, and responsible authorities
 in the public housing field.
 I wish to commend Mrs. Marie C. Mc-
 Guire, our Nation's first woman chief of
 public housing, for her work and success
 in this field.  Mrs. McGuire has a long
 history of accomplishments in public
 housing, which has earned her a citation
 from the American Institute of Arch-
 itects.
 As a tribute to this fine person, I ask
 unanimous consent that an article con-
 cerning her, from the Dallas Morning
 News of February 24, 1965, be printed in
 the Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 HOUSING  CHIEF BATTLES  DRAB DESIGN-HAS
 Goon WORD FOR DALLAS
 (By Mary Brinkerhoff)
 The Nation's first woman chief of public
 housing was back in Texas Tuesday, still a
 free-form, split-level, multi-purpose model
 built to stand out on Washington's official
 skyline.
 Mrs. Marie C. McGuire walked off a Braniff
 Airways plane into Dallas' suddenly roaring
 winter  and  talked a while on  everything
 from  local  housing  proposals  to her war
 against drab design.
 When she was off for several speaking en-
 gagements in Fort Worth with Thomas H.
 Callaham, the Public Housing Authority's
 regional director there, and his assistant, E. J.
 Haling.
 She was shown a newspaper report of the
 recent  Dallas  Council  of  Social  Agencies
 recommendation  that at  least       1,000  one-
 bedroom apartments for the elderly be built
 under Dallas Housing Authority auspices.
 This kind of thing is her meat.      When Mrs.
 McGuire was executive director of the San
 Antonio Housing Authority, her pioneering
 apartment project for older people won her
 fame and a Federal appointment.
 For those  who  doubt the need of  low
 income housing for the aged, she offers this
 thought: When such housing is built in a
 city of any size, applicants outnumber avail-
 able units many times over.
 Private "retirement villas" are fine, she be-
 lieves, but they have little bearing on the
 problem which concerns her.  "The difficulty
 is that they are not speaking to the major-
 ity's ability to pay."
 Marie McGuire, famed as a redtape slasher
 during her nearly 4 years in Washington,
 never lost her concern for the individual,
 elderly or otherwise, who lives in public
 housing.
 She hasn't been overawed by her responsi-
 bility for Federal participation in a program

 which operates in more than 2,100 communi-
 ties and represents a total investment run-
 ning into billions.
 And she retains a soft spot for her Vic-
 toria Plaza in San Antonio, still a showpiece.
 It was designed with thought for the occu-
 pants need for beauty, recreation, friend-
 ship-factors to make them feel that "life
 is not over; it may be just beginning."
 Any resident of public housing, she's con-
 vinced, should be able to take pride in his
 home.  And while "I'm all for economy,"
 drabness and poor design are false econ-
 omies to her.
 "After all, we're building environments to
 last for the next 50 to 100 years.
 A corollary is that public housing shouldn't
 be segregated in some grim location.  "It
 should meld in with the community, not
 stand off in the backyards * * *.  You have
 some good public housing sites in Dallas, in
 very pleasant parts of the city.  This is not
 true of some cities."
 Mrs. McGuire strongly opposes housing
 plans which segregate the handicapped, those
 of lowest Income or any group as if they
 were "the dregs of society."
 One way around such segregation was pro-
 vided in the Housing Act of 1961: partner-
 ship between the Public Housing Authority
 aid private enterprise.
 An example is under construction in New
 York by the PHA and a foundation.  Five
 hundred units will be reserved for "low-
 income" occupants, another 500 for those of
 "lower middle" income.  The two kinds of
 tenants will be mixed throughout.
 When an occupant's income rises or falls,
 he changes status-and, in a sense, land-
 lords-through a mere bookkeeping switch.
 He doesn't have to move, and if the change
 is downward, he isn't stigmatized.
 Mrs. McGuire's office receives many in-
 quiries about this system, which has proved
 a boon to private builders  as  well as to
 tenants.
 Also, she observed, the plan "takes a little
 of the sting off" for people who just can't
 swallow the concept of federally financed
 housing.
 The  PHA  Commissioner  reminds  these
 people that her agency's participation in a
 housing project doesn't mean Federal super-
 vision.               "Congress is well aware of controls
 at the local level."
 She explains the PHA's role this way: "We,
 in effect, are the bankers.  And any prudent
 banker certainly watches his investment."
 Home rule applies in the matter of design,
 unless a proposal is downright extravagant.
 "I'm running on a platform of design free-
 dom.  Truly, the area of housing is going to
 reflect what each city wants."
 When a community needs help or advice
 on design, Mrs. McGuire can call on her blue-
 ribbon  panel  of  professional  consultants.
 She has set aside the agency's old design
 manuals as influences toward conformity.
 For such measures and for her general at-
 titude, she was cited by the American In-
 stitute of Architects.
 When her powers of persuasion fail, local
 control sometimes pains her.  She couldn't
 keep a certain city from building "one of
 those round, tubelike towers" with pie-slice
 efficiency apartments for the elderly.
 "I lost that battle."

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. STROM THURMOND
 OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, March 4, 1965
 Mr. THURMOND.  Mr. President, the
 March 9, 1965, issue of National Review
 includes a very interesting article by a
 distinguished South Carolina newsman,
 Anthony Harrigan, of Charleston.  The
 article, entitled "We Can Win in South-
 east Asia," notes that this is a report
 from a firsthand observer who found that
 Americans fighting in southeast Asia do
 not agree with defeatists at home who
 say we must get' out because we cannot
 win.  I ask unanimous consent, Mr.
 President, that this article be printed in
 the Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 WE CAN WIN IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 (By Anthony Harrigan)
 (A firsthand observer found that Ameri-
 cans fighting in southeast Asia do not agree
 with defeatists at home who say we must
 get out because we can't win).
 As long ago as 1963, the New Republic was
 saying: "The war in South Vietnam cannot
 be won."   More recently, Walter Lippmann,
 the oracle of retreat, solemnly declared: "No-
 bedy in his right mind can imagine that this
 kind of war can be 'won'."  Prof. Bernard
 B. Fall, author of "Ordeal., at Dienbienphu,"
 and "The Two Vietnams," lends his author-
 ity to the statement that "any lingering idea
 that the Vietnam war can be ended by the
 surrender of the Communists is totally un-
 realistic."
 The chorus of defeati*M is-loud lS the
 land.  Bearded young beatniks march with
 signs asserting the hopelessness of the strug-
 gle against the Vietcong.   Clergymen and
 teachers of ink ernat4losnl_r~,atji{.write let-
 ters to the editors of the" flew York Times,
 declaring how fortunate the United States
 will be if Ho Chi Minh agrees to negotiate
 a]e establishment of a Yugoslav-type Com-
 home and overseas.   But the professional
 soldier no longer is free, as he was in the
 1950's. to state his case to the Nation.  Un-
 fortunately, no Senator has been as busy
 and articulate in explaining why the United
 States can win in Asia as Senator WAYNE
 MORSE has been in stating the case for cap-
 itulation and withdrawal.
 Nevertheless, the evidence exists to sup-
 port those who believe that an American
 victory is possible in  southeast Asia.   We
 have the ships.  We have the planes.      We
 have the weapons.  All that is required for
 victory is firm leadership, historical under-
 standing, and a resolute people.
 The U.S. public need pay no attention to
 the Lippmann nonsense that Americans can't
 win a, war in Asia. Only 20 years ago the
 United States defeated a superbly organized,
 brilliantly  led  Asian  adversary.   There's
 nothing magical about the soil of Asia.    If
 the United States has the right weapons, the
 proper strategy, and the will to win, it will
 triumph in Asia as it has elsewhere on the
 globe.
 The truth is that we have hardly begun
 to fight in Asia.  But fight we must or, in
 the fullness of time, Chinese-led guerrillas
 will be in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula or
 across the Rio Grande.
 An American victory in southeast Asia is
 a meaningless concept apart from a vision of
 history.  The Vietcong is but an advanced
 guard of a resurgent Chinese Empire.  In
 centuries past, the Vietnam region was one
 of  China's  tributary  states.  The Middle
 Kingdom's power extended to Java and to
 Ceylon, and the great eunuch admiral, Cheng
 Ho, had led fleets as far as east Africa in the
 15th century.  China's history was arrested
 by the European states, and its own inner
 decay.  But with the failure of nerve on
 the part of many once great Western nations,
 China again is reaching out-pushing south-
 ward into Vietnam, with Australia as the
 ultimate goal to the south; aiming, with its
 nibbling at India's frontier, to reach the Bay
 of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, and plan-
 ning to extend and deepen its influence from
 the Congo to Somalia and from the Yemen
 to Albania.
 Such is the vast scope of the Chinese vi-
 sion of conquest.  If the United States is
 to prevent its fulfillment, the American peo-
 ple and Government must clearly understand
 the nature of the struggle in which they are
 involved  and  Its  long-term  perspective.
 The struggle in Vietnam is not an isolated
 conflict, which can be settled by a tidy ac-
 cord                                                                                                                          in which  unpleasant  truths can be
 brushed under a mass of legalistic docu-
 ments.  Vietnam Is a key military campaign
 in the containment of Communist China
 and the reduction of its power.  Our na-
 tional purpose can be nothing less than that
 of suppressing China's warmaking capac-
 ity                                                                                                                          and,  by the  force  of  our  retaliatory
 assaults, convincing Peiping that a south-
 wardcourse of empire is too costly and dan-
 gerous.  If Communist China's leaders are
 compelled to  look northward,  toward the
 empty lands of the former Chinese Empire
 that now are in Soviet Russia's hands, all
 the better.
 Obviously,  a  tit-for-tat  policy  of  light
 retaliatory raids will not force Peiping to any
 fundamental change in its- policies.  A far
 more  comprehensive       and  massive   assault
 will be needed, over a long period of time.
 The United States needs to recognize, to
 begin with, that the problems in southeast
 Asia are essentially military, not political.
 This conclusion is completely contrary to
 the ruling doctrine in the Department of
 State; but even the most deeply rooted doc-
 trine can be altered by the facts.  What
 makes the Vietcong a force in the country-
 side is not its doctrine, but  he fact that its
 doctrine is supported by arms in the hands
 of terrorists.  Mao Tse-tung once said that
 the gun is the ultimate political weapon.
 Only in this sense is the southeast Asian
 struggle basically political.

 TrrE  FmZRAL  DIARY:  JOBNSON  RATES  HIS
 AgppngTEES ON WORN IN FEDERAL SERVICE
 (By Jerry Kiuttz)
 An amazing 61 percent of the 120 personal
 appointments made by President Johnson
 during the 15 months he has been in office
 have been either career civil servants or per-
 sons with wide backgrounds of Federal serv-
 ice.
 No other President has given such broad
 recognition to professional experience in the
 art of government. In fact, nearly all of the
 Johnson appointees have had some expert-
 euce to the Federal service.      on hian, the
 Despite the great Pressures
 President has found time to interview per-
 sonally most of the candidates before their
 appointments are announced to the public.
 He tries to spend at least 30 minutes with
 each appointee to give him an opportunity to
 know him and to exchange views.
 "These people," an assistant explained.
 "are personal appointees of the President
 who is responsible for them.  The President
 will be either credited or discredited for their
 acts. Be locks` to them to carry out his pro-
 grams and policies.  He wants to be ab-
 solutely certain of them and where they
 stand before he asks the Senate to ootfrm
 them ?'
 Vice- President HUsERT H. NVABIM EY also
 is considered a career Government employee
 by the President. He has more than 20 years
 or city, State, and Federal service.
 Chairman John W. Macy of the Civil Serv-
 ice Commission, recently gave the Vice Pres-
 ident a 20-year service pin.  Three years ago
 he gave a 30-year pin to Mr. Johnson.
 The President no doubt looks to the career
 service for a record number of key appoint-
 ments because they are the people he knows
 best. He also must think that their thorough
 knowledge of the Federal service will result
 in good administration that will reflect credit
 on him and the Democratic Party.
 STANDARDS  AND  QUALITIES  OF
 BROADCASTING NEWS
 Mr. MAGNUSON.   Mr. President,
 much has been written and spoken about
 the standards and qualities of broadcast-
 ing news. In 1964 the Radio-Television
 News Directors Association conducted a
 conference, on the problem of establish-
 ing standards for television news film re-
 porting at a station level.  As a conse-
 quence of this conference, a television
 newsfilm standards manual was pre-
 pared.  This is a guidebook and work-
 ing manual for students and profession-
 als in the news film area. Because of
 the interest in this subject, I have pre-
 pared a summary of the factors leading
 up to the adoption of this manual:
 In September of 1963, the management
 of Time-Life Broadcast made this sug-
 gestion to the board of directors of the
 Radio-Television News Directors Asso-
 ciation:
 In the belief that a real need exists for
 the establishment of a set of standards for
 television newsfilm reporting at the station
 level, Time-Life Broadcast suggests to the
 RTNDA that a joint project, designed to
 satisfy that need, should be undertaken.

 Association, "Time-Life" broadcast, and

 COMMUNIST   AGGRESSION   IN
 VIETNAM
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, having
 spoken at length on the subject of Viet-
 nam last week, I have been reluctant to
 take the floor again.  However, a num-
 ber of statements have been made on the
 floor of the Senate and from other plat-
 forms in recent weeks which, in my opin-
 ion, call for comment.
 I first wish to comment on the remark::
 made last week by Secretary-General U
 Thant, because in point of time his was
 the first of several statements on Viet-
 nam which, I feel, should be answered
 in order to set the record straight.
 In his press conference of February
 24,  Secretary-General U Thant was
 quoted as saying the following:'
 I am sure that the great American people,
 if only they know the true facts and the
 background to the developments in South
 Vietnam, will. agree with me that further
 bloodshed is unnecessary.  The political and
 diplomatic method of discussions and nego-
 tiations alone can create conditions which
 will enable the United States to withdraw
 gracefully from that part of the world.
 A statement was subsequently Issued
 attempting to explain and soften the
 impact of the Secretary-General's press
 conference of February 24. it is my be-
 lief, however, that the language used by
 the Secretary-General on February 24
 It was undertaken.  In February-
 March of 1964, the RTNDA Newsfilm
 Standards Conference was held in the
 Time & Life Building, New York City, at-
 tended by 230 delegates.  Represented
 were 94 television stations in 37 states,
 7 universities, and 29 other organizations
 vitally Interested in newsfilmn technique-
 A faculty of 21 recognized experts made
 presentations and conducted discussions.
 This conference was the first attempt
 ever made to establish standards in this
 all-important field of public informa-
 tion and communication.  Never before
 had so many top experts in our field
 come together to communicate to their
 peers what their actual experience has
 taught  them.  The  professional  ap-
 praisal of practical-sometimes diffi-
 cult-problems, the clash and exchange
 of ideas, the candid, constructive criti-
 cism of current inadequacies, all made
 The President has made clear that key
 appointments . to Defense, State, and simi-
 larly sensitive agencies are to 'e made on
 the basis of merit and ability. political con-
 siderations are secondary.
 Mr. Johnson has been heard to remark
 that no one checks on the politics of our
 troops in Vietnam and that their superiors
 here should be equally nonpartisan and
 should base their decisions on what's good
 for the American public.
 He also has told his associates to recom-
 mend to him only those persons for regula-
 tory agencies who will be fair and firm in
 upholding the interest of the public.  He's
 reluctant to appoint anyone who is a repre-
 sentative of a group or special, iinwho t. in
 fact, he prefers to have appointees
 labeled one way or the other and who have
 open minds on agency problems and policies.
 Only a few of what are generally considered
 political appointments have been made by
 the President who, in effect, has told his top
 staff to do their jobs and leave partisan p
 tics to him.

 I have been a strong supporter of the

 every appropriation requested for the
 U.N. and its various agencies.  Despite

 participation in the U.N. bond issue in
 August of 1962, because it was clear that
 the survival of the U.N. was at stake.
 Indeed, I think it not improper to point
 out that participation in the U.N. bond
 issue was approved in the Committee on
 Foreign Relations, on which I am privi-

 of one vote.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                Akx
 I would like to pose a few basic ques-
 tions to those of my colleagues who have
 urged that we turn the problem of Viet-
 nam over to the United Nations despite
 the manifest inability of the U.N. to deal
 with a situation of this magnitude, or
 who continue to urge negotiations now
 when such negotiations would obviously
 culminate in nothing better than a diplo-
 matic surrender.
 If we abandon South Vietnam to com-
 munism, where do they propose to draw
 a new line against the advance of com-
 munism in the Western Pacific?
 What nations do they believe should
 receive our assistance in defending them-
 selves, and what nations do they believe
 we should not help to defend themselves.
 If they propose falling back to a new
 defense line in southeast Asia or the
 Western Pacific, are they prepared to
 support a greater investment in aid and
 American manpower than we have now
 committed to the defense of Vietnam?
 What concrete measures do they pro-
 pose to prevent a massacre of anti-Com-
 munist elements in South Vietnam, on
 the genocidal scale that has character-
 ized the establishment of Communist
 power, especially in the countries of
 Asia?
 I believe that those who urge that we
 find ourselves an easy way out of our
 Involvement in Vietnam have an obliga-
 tion to weigh the consequences of with-
 drawal and to provide specific answers
 for the questions I have here posed.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD at
 the conclusion of my remarks a trans-
 lation of a recent telegram to Saigon
 dealing with a successful action against
 the Vietcong by local militia forces in
 Son My Village.  I think this document
 is all the more significant because the
 unit involved on the Government side
 was made up for the most part of de-
 fectors from the Vietcong.  The thous-
 from areas under Vietcong control-the
 total number of Asian refugees from
 communism rises to approximately 8 mil-
 lion, which is the figure I gave in my
 speech of February 23.

 objection, it is so ordered.

 ary 7, 8, 9, and 10, 1965, the provincial
 Chieu Hoi armed propaganda platoon while
 on duty met with a VC company at My Khe
 hamlet, Son My village.  The platoon has
 shown its drastic spirit of fighting in 3 hours
 and has wiped out the VC company.  Spe-
 cially Trinh-Sang, the squad leader after
 carrying Le-Clhuong a wounded comrade out
 of the battlefield, returned to command the
 fight until the end.  He alone with a sub-
 machinegun has pushed, back two assaults of
 the enemy, killed 15 of them and died after
 he had fired his last bullet.  VC stabbed him
 all over his body with daggers.  Soldier Dinh
 Tru (a mountaineer) a light machinegunner
 has protected his comrades and wiped out
 the enemy with 20 bodies left at the battle-
 field.                                                           Nurse   an Thi Dao has courageously

 OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, U.S.
 SENATE, COMPILED BY ITS SUBCOMMITTEE To
 INVESTIGATE         PROBLEMS  CONNECTED  WITH
 REFUGEES AND ESCAPEES
 The toll in refugees of Communist ag-
 grandizement in Asia is the subject of this
 report.  The refugees include the following
 groups:
 i. Approximately 5 million Koreans who
 fled from North to South Korea following
 the Soviet occupation of North Korea in 1945,
 and, subsequently, during the Korean war;
 2. One million Chinese who fled into Hong
 Kong and Macao before the advancing tide
 of Communist military and political con-
 quest, plus an additional 340,000 Chinese who
 escaped since 1950;
 3. Nearly 40,000 Europeans from mainland
 China, 20,000 of whom, were evacuated to
 the Philippines during 1948-51, the remainder
 having found their way into Hong Kong;
 4. Some 960,000 Vietnamese who fled from
 North to South Vietnam, and adjacent areas,
 in 1954, plus additional thousands displaced
 by the current hostilities in South Vietnam;
 5. Some 60,000 Tibetans who entered In-
 dia and Nepal following the bloody suppres-
 sion of the Tibetan revolt by Chinese Com-
 munist forces in 1959;
 6. The many victims of the India-China
 border war in 1982; and
 7. Approximately  240,000  inhabitants  of
 Laos who, as a result of Communist activ-
 ities, have been displaced from their homes
 in the countryside, and have fled to secure
 areas under the control of the Lao Govern-
 ment.
 R SULTS
 On the enemy's part: 35 VC bodies left
 behind and others being carried off.
 On our part: Three died: But Minh, deputy
 platoon leader; Trinh Song, squad leader and
 translator; Thi Dao, nurse.  Three missing:
 Phan Dung, squad leader, Le Tan May, and
 Nguyen Nuoi (all are soldiers).
 At present, Son My village is completely lib-
 erated and construction works being imple-

 WATER RESOURCES PLANNING ACT
 Mr. ELLENDER.  Mr. President, some
 time ago the Senate considered Calendar
 No. 65, S. 21.  I did not learn about it,
 until a few days after the bill was passed.
 I wish to address myself to it.
 Page D123 of the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
 ORD of February 24, 1965, shows under
 "Bill reported" the following:
 Report was made as follows: S. 21, pro-
 posed Water Resources Planning Act, with
 amendments (S. Rept. 68), page 3392.
 Turning to page 3392, there is a simple
 announcement of the submission of the
 report by Mr. ANDERSON.
 The "Program for Thursday" as re-
 ported in the Daily Digest was as follows:
 Senate met at 11 a.m. and adjourned at
 5:26 p.m. until noon Thursday, February 25,
 when it will continue its consideration of.
 H.R. 45, to amend the Inter-American De-
 velopment Bank Act, pages 3451, 3454.
 Referring to the body of the RECORD,
 there is no indication of anything else to
 be considered by the Senate on Thurs-
 day.
 On Thursday, February 25, the major-
 ity leader moved that the Senate proceed
 to the consideration of Calendar No. 65,
 S. 21, and that it be made the pending
 business.  The committee amendments
 were then printed in the RECORD, to-
 gether with the bill as amended by the
 Senate committee.  By unanimous con-
 sent, the committee amendments were
 agreed to and there was inserted in the
 RECORD an explanation of the bill. Then,
 except for a brief colloquy between Sen-
 ator AmcEN and Senator ANDERSON with
 respect to the interpretation of the
 phrase, "The resolution of the States'

 "that somebody cares about them, is' con-
 cerned about their future."
 The director of the program is a 47-year-
 old educator, Thomas Flagg, who is assisted
 by a deputy and seven counselors.  They
 roam from one city agency to another, wher-
 ever their young people are employed, in-
 quiring as to their progress and with a
 willing ear, for any problems, personal or
 otherwise.
 "It seems to be working," the mayor said.
 COUNTERING RIGHTWING TACTICS
 Mr, ' WILLIAMS of. New ,Jersey.  Mr.
 President, many of us in the Senate have
 become increasingly aware, over the past
 year, of the vicious nature and undemo-
 cratic methods of the extreme right.
 We have seen and heard of examples of
 the far right's infiltrating school boards,
 in attempts to distort-indeed, to de-
 stroy-the educational , principles that
 have made this country great, and to
 implement, instead, their own authori-
 tarian thoughts on education.
 The activities of -this lunatic fringe,
 however, do not stop with school boards.
 They have attacked our national leaders;
 they have viciously fought' dedicated at-
 Geiripts to strengthen our. efforts to deal
 with mental health; and they have ham-
 pered the attainment of civil rights for
 all our citizens. They have intimidated
 :,the  volunteers of..legitimate political
 candidates seeking election to positions
 at all level of government. Worst of all,
 the members of these groups hate started
 rumors and have shouted lies, about any-
 thing that differs with their perverse
 version of w)'iat is right, good, or healthy.
 What truly. saddens me Is the fact that
 in the name of democracy, these often
 psychotic individuals have renounced the
 democratic methods.  In the name of
 democracy, they have abandoned the
 principles that we live by, in favor of
 totalitarian terror and misrepresenta-
 tion,-In view of these facts, Mr. President,
 it is heartening to read a pamphlet,
 recently published by the National Con-
 gress of Parents and Teachers, that deals
 with directly meeting these threats to
 democracy.
 I think this pamphlet is worthy of the
 consideration of the Members of the
 Senate, and I, am sure that all Senators
 will,flnd of interest, the ideas stated in
 . the leaflet. , Therefore, I ask unanimous
 consent that  this, pamphlet,  entitled
 "Extremist Groups: A Clear and Present
 Danger to Freedom and Democracy," be
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the pam-
 phlet was ordered to ,be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 EXTREMIST  GROUPS:  A  CLEAR, AND PRESENT
 DANGER TO FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY,
 Open membership: PTA memberships, now
 about 12 million, represent 'a fair cross sec-
 tion of America.
 Membership is open to all who want to
 work. for children and youth.  There are no
 barr$,erS of color, creed, occupation, or in-
 comb.
 ,Tle PTA is nonsectarian and nonpartisan.
 No, one is'aslsl;d what his religious and politi-
 oCal ' ellefs aad affiliations are.
 ' The 'PTA"is an educational organization
 dedicated to.promoting the welfare of chil-
 dren through  home,  school,  church,  and
 community. .St welcomes all who want to
 learn mRre Oput c ,ii0'en and-act on their
 behalf.
 Procedures: The PTA practices democracy.
 It welcomes dissent as well as assent.  It 'does
 not impose conformity to any doctrine or
 dogma except democracy.
 In the national organization, the State
 organization, and the local association, the
 rule,.is to, &l?ide by majority decisions and to
 respect the right of the minority to disagree
 and work for change.
 tfnity and'iversity:- What brings us to-
 gether in the PTA-our common concern for
 children-is greater than anything that can
 divide us.  Although there are bound to be
 differences of opinion where children and
 schools are concerned, PTA members are not
 youngsters who pick up their marbles and
 go home when they cannot have their way.
 PTA members can tolerate diversity and
 act with unity and enthusiasm on majority
 decisions.  This is the democratic way, the
 PTA way.
 WAYS TO COMBAT UNDEMOCRATIC PRESSURES 1,ON
 PTA's, SCHOOLS, AND LIBRARIES
 In the PTA: Appoint a committee to be-
 come informed on extremist groups, their
 "front organizations," and their tactics.
 Devote a meeting to a factual report by
 the committee , on. extremist groups;  their
 efforts to infiltrate PTA's and influence them
 to withdraw from the State and national
 organizations; and their undemocratic pres-
 sures on schools and libraries.
 Establish the policy that resolutions and
 motions on controversial issues will not be
 voted on until the meeting following their
 introduction.  This assures that the mem-
 bership can be alerted and all views on an
 issue can be fairly represented-and heard.
 If someone comes up with a loaded, un-
 answerable question, ask him to rephrase it.
 Usually he can't, because it's a "canned"
 question.
 Never  mislay your  sense  of  humor.  A
 humorous  remark;. has  more   than once
 pricked an inflated balloon.
 Set a definite, reasonable time for adjourn-
 ment.  This assures that decisions will not
 be made by an extremist minority that out-
 stays the moderate majority.
 Look gift speakers in the mouth.  Find
 out why they want to speak and whom they
 represent.
 Keep the community and the press sup-
 plied with facts about PTA purposes and
 projects.
 Schools: Urge school boards to do the fol-
 lowing:
 Have written statements of policy placing
 responsibility for curriculum decisions and
 selection of textbooks, films, pamphlets, and
 other teaching materials with teachers and
 educational administrative officials.
 Have an information program to sustain
 community understanding of these policies.
 Have clearly defined procedures for deal-
 ing with complaints on curriculum, books,
 and  teachers.  For  example,  require  that
 charges and complaints be made in writing
 and signed by the complainant, referred to
 a special committee, and so on,
 Libraries: Urge library boards also to have
 written policies on book selection; a public
 education program; and definite procedures
 for handling complaints.
 Prepare in advance
 Invite  representatives   from   schools,
 churches,  libraries,  labor, industry, press,
 radio, and TV to a meeting to consider sound,
 democratic ways of dealing with extremist
 :pressures.
 Establish a joint committee for a continu-
 ing exchange of information and ideas.
 Conduct a joint, vigorous education cam-
 paign to make the community aware of the
 importance of freedom of speech and freedom
 4081
 If an attack comes
 Bring it out in the open.
 Insist  that  charges  and  complaints be
 specific, written, documented, and signed.
 Ask the school board or library board to
 hold public hearings.
 Get full press, radio, and TV coverage.
 Seek advice and help from the National
 Congress of Parents and Teachers, your State
 congress, and from such groups as the State
 .education association, the National Educa-
 tion Association, the American Library As-
 sociation, the National Council for Civic Re-
 sponsibility, the National Council of Teach-
 ers   of  English, the National Council  of
 Teachers of Social Studies, and local and
 State colleges and universities.
 EXTREMIST GROUPS:  BOTH OF THE RIGHT AND
 OF THE LEFT
 Most of us believe in the right of others
 to hold and to express views, even extreme
 ones, that differ from our own. (Extremist
 groups try to stifle free expression of views
 opposed to their own.)
 Most of us believe that free access to in-
 formation and a diversity of opinions are
 essential in a democracy.  (Extremist groups
 try to purge school and public libraries of
 publications that are objectionable to them.)
 Most  of  us  believe  the  public  schools
 should not indoctrinate students in the po-
 .U,tical,. economic, religious, or social views
 of any group. (Extremist groups put pres-
 sures on schools to adopt courses and text-
 books that reflect their views.)
 Most of us believe that criticism of public
 institutions and officials is healthy, but that
 criticism should be informed, constructive,
 and  based, on  facts.  (Extremist   groups
 make  irresponsible,  venomous,  and  near-
 libelous attacks on individuals, institutions,
 and organizations that disagree with them.)
 Most of us believe that political, social,
 and  economic change should be      brought
 about by legal, democratic procedures. (Ex-
 tremist groups use  coercion, intimidation,
 and  even  violence to  prevent  or.  force
 change.)
 Most of us believe that patience, good will,
 and intelligent, cooperative effort are needed
 to deal with complicated issues and prob-
 lems.   (Extremist groups are likely to be-
 lieve there are easy, simple, fast solutions
 to complex problems and to advocate over-
 simplified, very often dangerous, measures.)
 Most of us believe in rule by the majority,
 subject to criticism by a "loyal opposition."
 (Extremist groups believe in rule by their
 own minority and label any opposition as
 "disloyal.")
 Tactics of extremist groups
 Front groups:  Extremist groups  set  up
 front  organizations with  high-sounding,
 patriotic names to promote their views.
 Free speakers: They offer to provide free
 speakers in order to spread their propaganda.
 Infiltration:   They  infiltrate democratic
 organizations like the PTA and try to cap-
 ture key positions like the program chair-
 manship.
 They  send  representatives  to  meetings
 with prepared, loaded, unanswerable ques-
 tioins to harass speakers whose views tiliffer
 from theirs.
 They prolong meetings so they can make
 minority decisions after the worn-out ma-
 jority has gone home.
 "Divide and conquer": They try to discredit
 State and national organizations and create
 distrust of their leadership in order to isolate
 local  associations  and  capture  control  of
 them..
 They encourage irrelevant programs and
 debates over organizational details to dis-
 rupt the work of an organization and divert
 it from its own productive activities.
 Blacklisting and labeling: They probe into
 the personal history and political affiliations
 of educators, clergymen, and authors. and

 label as "subversive,'", "un-American," "radi-
 cal" those whose bpflefs and affiliations differ
 from theirs.
 Hysteria and fear: They create fear and in-
 security by highly emotional, inflammatory
 charges of subversive influences in schools,
 government, and community organisations.
 Coercion and intimidation: They threaten
 investigations  of   school   administrators,
 teachers, librarians, and members of school
 and library boards who resist pressures for
 conformity to their views.
 Some groups use social ostracism, economic
 pressures, and even violence to silence dis-
 agreement and impose their views on a coin:
 munity.
 Misrepresentation: They make false charg-
 es and use quotations taken out of context.
 They distribute smear literature and poison-
 pen pamphlets, usually imported from out-
 side the community.
 PRESIDENT'S  MESSAGE  ON  THE
 CITIES
 Mr. HART.    Mr. President, we have
 declared war on poverty, and we want
 better and more livable and attractive
 Communities. An important contribu-
 tion toward the attainment of this goal
 is public housing.  Its extension and
 strengthening, called for by President
 Johnson, are basic to solving our prob-
 lem of urban poverty. In fact, people
 in the public housing field have been
 concerned with poverty for over 26 years,
 since practically everyone served by the
 public-housing programs is in the lowest
 income group.
 A statistical cross section of the ten-
 ant population of low-rent housing proj-
 ects shows that: 52 percent are non-
 white; 47 percent are receiving assist-
 ance or benefits; 24 percent are elderly;
 36 percent of the families with children
 are one-parent families; and 82 percent
 of the elderly and 25 percent of the non-
 elderly have  no gainfully employed
 worker in the family. -
 The median total annual income for
 elderly individuals in public housing is
 $1,100, for elderly families $1,900, and
 for nonelderly families $2,800.
 These are disadvantaged families sub-
 leet to all the stresses imposed by pov-
 erty, ignorance, squalor, ill health, and
 the lack of skill required to participate
 effectively in the urban labor market.
 Not only does public housing help
 solve the problem of providing adequate
 shelter for these people, including those
 displaced by renewal, but it also pro-
 vides social services and incentives to
 help them become better citizens.
 Poor families in public housing share
 with poor families everywhere the ugly
 byproducts of poverty, which include
 problems of motivation, health, educa-
 tion, employment, and social adjust-
 ment.  The Public Housing Administra-
 tion, in close cooperation with other
 government and welfare agencies, and
 national service organizations, has been
 attacking these problems through dem-
 onstration services task forces and com-
 munity services programs.  Wholesome
 environments are created and main-
 tained to develop facilities, programs,
 and services for these low-income fami-
 lies that will help them help themselves.
 In the new war on poverty, the Eco-
 nomic Opportunity Act provides nu-
 merous  poverty-eliminating  programs
 which are directly relevant to local hous-
 ing authority participation.
 Title I of the act provides three sepa-
 rate programs for youth--4 Job Corps,
 Work-training programs, and work-study
 programs.  Who is in a better position
 to identify potential candidates for these
 programs, call the programs to the at-
 tention of these youngsters, and moti-
 vate them to participate, than the proj-
 ect management staff of the local hous-
 ing authorities?
 Also, title It of the economic opportu-
 nity legislation' is intended to stimulate
 and provide incentives for communities
 to mobilize their resources to combat
 poverty through community action pro-
 grams.  Such programs would provide
 services and other activities to develop
 employment opportunities, improve hu-
 man performance, motivation, and pro-
 ductivity, and to better the conditions
 under which people live, learn, and work.
 All local housing authorities have al-
 ready been involved in such action pro-
 grams, and they will work in close co-
 operation with the Office of Economic
 Opportunity in accelerating these com-
 munity efforts.
 Public housing is a cornerstone in the
 national public welfare program.  Its
 basic philosophy is that the end result
 must be better living for its tenants and
 their neighbors, better neighborhoods
 and community growth, better housing
 and bette living.  It all adds up to a
 better ci$y.

 U.S. CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES IN
 VIETNAM
 Mr. BREWSTER.  Mr. President, in
 a recent article, Joseph Young, of the
 Washington Evening Star, paid tribute
 to the Government's civilian employees
 who are on the frontlines in battle-torn
 Vietnam.
 These courageous and dedicated pub-
 lic servants deserve our most humble
 thanks.  They symbolize the wilingness
 of our civil servants in this country and
 around the world to do their job, and
 do it well.
 They live and work under extremely
 hazardous conditions, and without mili-
 tary escorts.
 I ask unanimous consent that Mr.
 Young's article be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Washington Star, Feb. 16, 19651
 U.S.  CIVILIAN  WORKERS  PRAISED  FOR  THEIR
 COURAGE IN VIETNAM
 (By Joseph Young)
 A firsthand report on how Government
 civilian employees are ably and courageously
 performing their duties in battle torn Viet-
 nam has been made by the Deputy Inspector
 General of Foreign Assistance in the State
 Department.
 Howard E. Haugerud had high praise for
 employees of the Agency for International
 Development and those in the Foreign Serv-
 ice, after returning from a month's Inspec-
 tion trip there.
 Haugerud reports:
 "Many of these men whom I visited are
 living under extremely hazardous conditions
 and are constantly subject to injury, kidnap-
 ing, or death at the hands of the Vietcong
 infiltrators, snipers, terrorists, and regular
 military units.
 "They must work with and be respected
 by the district chiefs, village and hamlet lead-
 ers, and often remain in the hamlets over-
 night in the homes of these leaders who are
 generally 'marked Dien' by the Vietcong.
 In order to carry out their missions, they
 must work in areas infested with or threat-
 ened by the Vietcong.   They must do so
 without military escort and generally un-
 armed because of the allegedly more severe
 penalties inflicted by the Vietcong in the
 event of capture while carrying weapons.
 "My purpose in writing is to call attention
 to these Americans, many of whom are young
 and junior in grade.  Because their activi-
 ties are conducted mainly with the Vietna-
 mese people and because they are away from
 the large population centers engaging in vi-
 tal but nonspectacular work, I do not be-
 lieve they are receiving the public credit
 that is due them."
 This reporter is happy to pay credit to
 these courageous and dedicated public ser-
 vants, and by doing so stress that Govern-
 ment civilian employees throughout our his-
 tory-in war, peace, and emergency-have al-
 ways served their country faithfully and
 well.

 about the righteousness of "negotiation,"
 But negotiations are not possible with
 marauders until first they have been forced
 to cease their killing and looting and until
 first they have given some evidence that the
 end of any new "negotiation" will not be the
 same as the end of all other "negotiations"
 going back to 1954-that is, uninterrupted
 Communist aggression.

 NEWARK JOB CORPS A SUCCESS
 Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey.  Mr.
 President, it is indeed heartening to
 learn of the notable success of the job
 corps in Newark, N.J. As a pilot project,
 the Newark Job Corps has removed all
 doubts about the worth of the program.
 The young men and women in the
 corps have been in a training program
 sponsored by the city of Newark.  Un-
 der the leadership of its very able Mayor
 Hugh E. Addonizio, the city has taught
 these young people the skills necessary
 for useful employment.  The girls have
 learned to be nurses aides, librarians,
 and the like; the boys have been working
 in maintenance, communication, and so
 forth, with the city's various depart-
 ments.
 The success of the Corpsmen in learn-
 ing new skills has passed all expectations.
 These youngsters, all of whom are high-
 school dropouts, have proved themselves
 so -capable in their new tasks that the
 city is considering keeping many as full-
 time employees.
 But an even truer indication of the
 success of the program is the fact that
 nearly 50 percent of the members of the
 Corps have resumed their education. It
 is heartening to know that the Job Corps
 has met the challenge of persuading
 these youngsters of their error in letting
 their education drop, and has induced
 them to begin again, where they left off.
 I commend Mayor Addonizio and Mr.
 Thomas E. Flagg, director of the pro-
 gram, for their outstanding efforts to
 help in making this pilot project the
 success it is.
 I am pleased to bring this program
 to the attention of the Senate, for I
 think my fellow Senators will enjoy
 knowing that the efforts and delibera-
 tions of Congress are paying off in rich
 dividends for less fortunate members of
 our society.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that two articles concerning the
 Job Corps in Newark, from the New York
 Times of February 15, be printed in the
 RECORD, I hope all Senators will derive
 the same feeling of satisfaction that I
 felt upon reading the articles. -
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 FIRST YOUTH CORPS IN NEWARK HAILED
 (By Charles Mohr)
 WASHINGTON,  February 14.-Secretary of
 Labor W. Willard Wirtz reported to President
 Johnson today that the Nation's first Neigh-
 borhood Youth Corps in Newark had dispelled
 the idea that the Corps was a make-Work
 concept.
 In a statement of reply, Mr. Johnson said
 the Newark experiment "has encouraged and
 heartened all those associated with it" and
 added that Mr. Wirtz' report was "an early
 indication that we can suceced in this best of
 all efforts."
 The Neighborhood Youth Corps program is
 a major part of Mr. Johnson's antipoverty
 program.  Full-time and summer programs
 are planned to give useful employment and
 training  to  school  dropouts.  The  first
 Neighborhood Corps project in the Nation has
 been in operation in Newark since January 4.
 Mr. Wirtz said today in a memorandum to
 the President that "its success has been so
 heartening and meaningful that it warrants
 a special report to you.,,
 A THIRD CHANCE
 Mr. Wirtz said that the Youth Corps en-
 rollees  were                                                                                            doing  "jobs  that would not
 ordinarily be done" and that "these are jobs
 that ought to be done in the public interest."
 But he put even higher emphasis on a
 statement that "the single most important
 result of the program thus far is in the proof
 it has provided that young persons disheart-
 ened by failure at school and discouraged by
 failure in the labor force do respond with
 hope, confidence, and effort when given that
 important third chance."
 Mr. Wirtz said that there were now 346 boys
 and girls at work In Youth Corps programs
 in Newark's schools, hospitals, library, muse-
 um, planning board, and other public agen-
 cies.
 The total will eventually rise to 700.  The
 youths work 30 hours a week.  All of them
 were dropouts from school and were unem-
 ployed before volunteering for the program.
 He said the total cost of the program was
 $620,000 of which the Federal Government
 had contributed $465,000.
 THE 180 RETURN TO SCHOOL
 Secretary Wirtz said that the brief experi-
 ence at Newark had led to several conclusions
 school because his cousin had told him it
 was the way to "see the world."
 The young man was  quoted as saying,
 "I dropped out and I saw it-the unemploy-
 ment line."
 He was asked, "Have you taken this up
 with your cousin?"
 "Did I," said the boy. "He's got two black
 eyes to say that I ain't going to drop out of
 school no more."
 A girl was quoted as saying that she now
 wants to return to school.  She said:  "A
 high school diploma is more important now-
 and a college diploma is more important
 than  a  high  school  diploma.  You can't
 hardly get a job without a diploma."
 Mr. Wirtz wrote to Mr. Johnson, "This
 birth of second-generation hope is a reward
 without price."
 The Wirtz report said that 112 youths were
 working in the Newark city hospital and
 at the Ivy Haven Home for the Aged.  Most
 girls are working as nurses' aides, but eight
 enrollees are working in the pathology de-
 partment and five in the dietary depart-
 ment.
 Twenty-seven are working in the library,
 museum or in other offices of Mayor Hugh J.
 Addonizio.  Some youths are working in city
 offices such as city planning, finance, per-
 sonnel, and treasury.  Thirty boys work in
 the city motor department learning vehicle
 repair and 13 boys work as linesmen's help-
 ers for the police, and fire department com-

 A SECOND CHANCE Pon 348 NEWARK DROPOUTS
 NEWARK, February 14.-Hundreds of young
 men  and  women,  many  of  whom  never
 worked a day in their lives, have recently
 become very useful to the city of Newark-
 and to themselves.
 Until this year, they were merely part of
 a grim statistic, part of a young population
 that had quit school and, without skills or
 ambition, faced the future with little hope.
 Since  January  4,  however,  when  the
 Neighborhood Youth Corps began its pilot
 project in Newark, hundreds of these young
 men and women have had a second chance.
 WORK AND SCHOOL
 They were taught how to work; they were
 encouraged to go back to school.  Today,
 of the 348 16- to 21-year-olds enrolled in the
 program, 180 are attending evening school,
 if not full-time day school, and all are em-
 ployed.  Their jobs pay $1.25 an hour for
 a 30-hour week.
 All work for the city of Newark.  The
 work depends on their aptitudes.  Some of
 the young men are tree trimmers with the
 Newark Park Department, or sign painters
 with  the  Newark  Traffic  Department, or
 mechanics' assistants in the city

 out that early fears the legislation would pro-
 duce restrictive shipping legislation in other
 countries had no `foundation; it countered
 the argument that cargo preference was un-
 desirable' as  an indirect subsidy on the
 grounds that it was, quite plainly, a direct
 subsidy; and finally, the report speculated
 that the, permanence of the Public Law 664
 legislation would provide an incentive for
 the construction of a modern and efficient
 dry bulk fleet.
 Unfortunately, our experience since that
 report has not borne out the predictions of
 its authors.  Since 1956, 15 countries have
 adopted restrictive shipping legislation, and
 most of the maritime world points to T.T.S.
 practice as the cause. Whatever may be said
 regarding the futility of such laws for the
 countries-in question, and their impact on
 American. trade, it seems clear they are not
 in the best interests of American shipping.
 As a subsidy, direct or indirect, cargo prefer-
 ence has been, a miserable failure: Not a
 single new tramp ship has been built since
 1956, and the cost of keeping the old ones
 in. existence climbs higher and higher.  A
 converted 10,000-deadweight-ton Liberty em-
 ployed in the grain trade costs the taxpayers
 about $700,000  In  freight-rate differential
 payments annually.  By contrast, our most
 modern. finer ships, with 40 percent more
 carrying capacity and twice the speed require
 an average of only $500,000 per year; this
 means an equivalent shipping capability at
 25 percent of the subsidy cost,
 Here, too, the American people are faced
 with a number of alternatives.
 1.' Present programs could be continued-
 at least so long as there is an agricultural
 surplus disposal program.  The result would
 be 4-steady rise in subsidy cost as these ves-
 sels become Increasingly inefficient, followed
 by a rapid decrease in the cost as the subsidy
 disappears with the ships.
 .1. The tramp fleet could be eliminated
 more quickly by simply eliminating the cargo
 preference program.
 3, Cargo preference could be continued,
 but supplemented with construction sub-
 sidy for replacement ships. Because the pres-
 ent production of 100 tramp ships easily
 could be matched with only 22 modern dry
 bulkers, however, any meaningful dry cargo
 fleet cannot be., hitched alone to the cargo
 preference grain trade.  The future of the
 dry bulk fleet, like the rest of our merchant
 3uarine, necessarily depends upon the ca-
 pacity to compete for commercial cargoes.
 Moreover, adding construction subsidy on to
 the existing cargo preference system would
 provide subsidy without any provision for
 mandatory  ship  replacement,  for reserve
 funds, for recapture, or for any of the other
 safeguards of the public interest built into
 the 1930 act.
 4. Cargo preference could be eliminated
 gradually, no faster than some form of direct
 operating, subsidy is substituted for it, mak-
 ing it possible for these ships to compete for
 commercial, cargoes at world rates,   Dry
 bulkers. are more simple ships than liners,
 ;and proposals have been made to construct,
 for example, a 30,000-ton ship for as little
 as $9 million, and operate it with a small
 crew acid .only $300,000 to $400,000 in annual
 .:operating subsidy. In order to give you some
 idea of. what these figures mean, if the pres-
 ent $80 milion per  year  spent on cargo
 preference freight rate differentials were all
 paid in operating subsidy to such new ships,
 we, could,.piaiptaln abort 20.0 modern dry
 bulk ciirriexs, with a total capacity about
 8 times our. present dry bulk fleet.  Even
 with reduced crews on, highly mechanized
 .ships it is obvious where the greatest long-
 terba job opportunity is toibe found.
 ?4iecesily, in making these choices the
 'rit1i11ber .(4 Lgmpeting interests is too great
 to satisfiy everyone completely. In discussing
 No. 41-11
 various new ideas with members of the in-
 dustry, I sometimes feel like the fellow whose
 wife bought him two ties for Christmas, one
 red and one green.-  He expressed delight
 with both, and when she appeared skeptical
 about the genuineness of his feelings, he put
 on the red one to prove it. "What's the mat-
 ter," she said, "don't you like the green one?"
 This kind of a reaction is especially com-
 mon in discussions about our passenger ships.
 American  operators  have  13  remaining
 passenger ships, staffed with crews ranging
 from 260 to 1,000.  In 1965 these ships will
 absorb almost one-quarter of the total money
 available for operating subsidy-about $46
 million.  And if they are expensive to run,
 they are even more expensive to build.  The
 Government's  share  of  replacing  the SS
 'United States today, for example could run
 to about $100 million. Like any other major
 investment the benefits derived from these
 ships-to the industry and to the Govern-
 ment-deserve the closest examination.                                                                                             The
 arithmetic is striking.
 In 1962 the then 15 passenger ships pro-
 duced a loss, before subsidy, of about $44
 million.  The subsidy amounted to $48.7 mil-
 lion, or more than 10 times the after-subsidy
 profits for the 15 ships.  In 1963, financial
 results were _little better.  The subsidy bill
 was nine times the companies' profits after
 subsidy.  Eight  of  the  fifteen  ships  lost
 money even after subsidy, and two others
 did little better than break even.
 By contrast, comparable figures for gen-
 eral cargo ships show a subsidy bill only two
 or three times profits after subsidy.  For the
 companies operating both passenger and
 general cargo ships, the gross revenue from
 cargo operations was three times that for
 passenger operations, and profits after sub-
 sidy were more than seven times as high.
 It is not surprising that shipowners have
 shown little inclination to replace their pas-
 senger ships.
 Nor do the passenger ship operators have
 much hope for improved profits.  The pro-
 ductivity of cargo ships has increased in re-
 cent years,  But 73 percent of the crew on
 a passenger ship are stewards-cooks and
 waiters-and mechanization can do little to
 increase their productivity.  Indeed, it is this
 personal service which tends to attract those
 relatively few people who     travel  by ship
 rather than air.
 Even if passenger ships are not a profitable
 business for the owners or the Government
 it is often argued that they are of great
 benefit to us as a nation.    If so, they are
 surely worth the investment.  But what are
 these alleged benefits?
 How  about  their  balance-of-payments
 contribution?  In 1963, the net balance-of-
 payments contribution of U.S.-flag passenger
 ships was about $47 million. Since we spent
 about $46.3 million in subsidy to secure that
 saving, you can see that it was bought rather
 dearly.  By contrast, in 1962, the interna-
 tional commercial airline industry contrib-
 uted $128 million to our balance of payments
 from passenger fares alone-and without the
 necessity of any contribution from the tax-
 payers.                                                                                       Or compare the like figures for gen-
 eral cargo ships.  In 1963 the net balance-of-
 payments impact of the 285 subsidized cargo
 ships was about $204 million-at a subsidy
 cost of approximately $135 million.  Thus,
 even by standards of return on shipping
 subsidy, the balance-of-payments impact of
 $1 of subsidy spent on a cargo liner is almost
 double the impact of a dollar spent on a
 passenger ship.
 Prestige is also said to be a benefit of pas-
 senger ships.  Of course, prestige is an elu-
 sive thing. Our present operating subsidy
 expenditures for passenger ships would sup-
 port close to 100 modern liner ships, which
 might well do more for our prestige around
 the world than a few passenger ships known
 to be highly unprofitable.
 Moreover, two important reasons for hav-
 ing                                                                                                                                      a  merchant ' marine-trading  leverage
 and stability of freight rates-are virtually
 unaffected by passenger ships.
 Finally, there is national defense. His-
 torically, passenger ships have played a major
 role in our defense efforts.  During World
 war. II, for example, most of our troops were
 transported in ships which once sailed as
 commercial vessels.  By the time of the Ko-
 rean hostilities, however, the situation had
 changed and only one passenger ship was
 removed from commercial service for troop
 carrying to the war zone.  Three small pas-
 senger ships under construction were trans-
 ferred to MSTS but were fitted primarily as
 passenger ships for military dependents.  All
 other troops were carried by MSTS troop
 carriers or by air.
 Our defense needs today still call for a
 passenger ship capability.  But the develop-
 ment of new aircraft, like the C-141 and the
 recently announced 600-passenger plane, is
 eroding the justification for heavy Govern-
 ment investment in constructing and main-
 taining commercial passenger ships.
 To some extent modern cargo liners could
 be converted to effective troopships if nec-
 essary.   Even  commercial  passenger  ships
 must be converted to troop-carrying condi-
 tions-increasing  their  troop-lift          capacity
 sevenfold.  But this takes time, and insofar
 as we still need conventional passenger ships
 it might better safeguard our national se-
 curity if the conversion were done in ad-
 vance, and the ships preserved in the reserve
 fleet in a high degree of readiness-at about
 one-tenth the present actual cost.
 But all of this analysis really adds little
 to the stark' economic reality that Ameri-
 can businessmen have little desire to build
 and operate passenger ships at a loss.  Un-
 less  some  presently unforeseeable                                                                                                                                            change
 comes about, some 5,500 jobs will disappear
 from these ships. over the next 10 years irre-
 spective of how the Government feels about
 the wisdom of this $50 million subsidy ac-
 count.
 The question before us is not whether the
 5,500 jobs will be affected, but whether any
 ships and jobs will be substituted in their
 place.
 Of the 5,500 men on passenger ships about
 4,000, or 73 percent, are stewards who can
 find ready transferability of their skills in
 the hotel and restaurant trades.  But what
 .of the 1,500 deck and engine men?  Their
 jobs are not as easily transferable.  If the
 $42 million passenger ship subsidy were used
 .for cargo liners-even the most highly mech-
 anized  now  imaginable-we  would                                                                                                                                              need
 about 3,000 men to operate them.  The road
 to true job opportunity seems clear.
 Finally, I want to say a few words about
 two aspects of our present system of paying
 operating subsidy.
 First, the trade route idea.
 At the present time the Maritime Adminis-
 tration has designated 80 trade routes and
 3 services as essential to the foreign trade
 of the United States.  A subsidized shipping
 company wishing to move from one trade
 route to another is required by law to under-
 go a long and arduous public hearing, effec-
 . tively  eliminating                                                                                                                                       its  ability  to  respond
 rapidly to competitive pressures.  In addi-
 tion, an operator's activities on any particu-
 lar trade  route-the  frequency  of                                                                                                                                             sailing
 and the ports at, which his ships call-are all
 subject to the approval of the Maritime Ad-
 ministration.
 Many questions are called to mind.  Is it
 not strange to have this high degree of pro-
 tectionism for American operators  against
 only a small part of their competition? For
 U.S. trade route restrictions obviously do not
 affect the foreign companies carrying about
 70 percent of our liner cargo.  What is the
 impact of these restrictions on the behavior
 of American shipping companies?  What are

 Approved Cgrepggj6(1/i0~yCRD 5iM~J46R000300160029-1 March
 the supposed benefits of the system, and how
 real are they?
 It is usually urged that the trade routes
 underlie the "service" concept of the 1936 act,
 and that they serve to prevent cutthroat
 competition.  Each of these assertions re-
 quires close examination.
 As for the first, to my knowledge there is
 not a single American operator serving a trade
 route because he was ordered to do so by the
 Maritime Administration.  In each case the
 operator requested permission to serve that
 route because there was cargo to be carried.
 Look, for example, at the number of foreign
 companies, which may come and go much as
 they please, serving small ports on regular
 schedules  because  the  existence  of  cargo
 makes it profitable for them to do so.  Look
 at the American companies providing regular
 service to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico for
 the same reason.    There Is no reason to ex-
 pect that American companies in foreign
 trade would act very differently even if not
 bound by the strictures of the trade route
 concept.
 And if there is not sufficient cargo to jus-
 tify shipping services at all, I doubt very
 much whether the framers of the 1936 act
 intended that American companies be com-
 pelled to service ports at a loss to themselves
 as well as the taxpayers.  For example, if
 it Is cheaper to ship cargo by barge from
 a smaller to a larger port and then but by
 ship, that is probably the way the cargo
 ought to move.  That is the basic principle
 underlying the new Lykes sea barge clipper
 concept.
 I doubt, therefore, if a relaxation of the
 present rigorous trade route requirements
 would undermine adequate service for Amer-
 ican shippers-quite the contrary.
 Many shipowners have told me that the
 tortuous procedures necessary to gain per-
 mission to operate on a different trade route,
 even for a short time, have forced them to
 forgo many attractive commercial oppor-
 tunities-to the benefit of the merchant
 fleets of other nations.  This reminds me of
 the story about the Cape Cod garbage col-
 lector, whose weekly charge was 25 cents.
 One newcomer, seeking to do a little better,
 asked for his monthly rate.  "$1.50," was the
 reply. When the newcomer inquired why
 the monthly rate should be so much higher
 than four times the weekly rate, the old man
 replied, "The extry is for bein' tied down."
 I rather suspect that we may be paying
 "extry" for tying down our shipowners, too.
 We turn, then, to the question of cut-
 throat competition.  Whenever I hear that
 term, I am reminded of a story an old Texan
 used to tell about the general store in the
 small town where he grew up.  The store
 had a monopoly for many years, but as the
 town grew it began to attract new business,
 and in due course a competitor opened his
 doors across the street from the general store.
 The old proprietor began to bemoan his fate
 to the town at large, and one young man,
 recently back from a freshman economics
 course at the local college said, "But sir,
 isn't that just competition?" "Oh no," he re-
 plied, "it's - worse than competition."  Some
 shipowners have expressed similar sentiments
 to me, explaining that they have competition
 now, and that relaxing trade route restric-
 tions would be worse.
 Since trade route restrictions have no im-
 pact on the activities of foreign shipping
 companies, the danger arising :from a relaxa-
 tion of the trade routes must be seen to come
 from the  competition  of  other  American
 shipping companies.  Some shipowners feel
 that a new American company will come on
 the route and take one-half of the "Ameri-
 can" cargo, putting them both out of busi-
 ness.     -
 But, by and large, an established steamship
 company will tend to stay on its old routes,
 since it is costly and time consuming to de-
 velop new trade relations.  Moreover, such a
 company will consider carefully -whether it   problems has at least one solution.  Some

 the fly-by-night.
 The present rigid system prevents com-
 panics from taking advantage of fluctuations
 in world trade.  And to the extent that it is
 an effective shield against competition, it
 tends to insulate the companies on the trade
 route from the salutary effects of competi-
 tion.  Finally, the present system puts into
 the hands of the Government too much of
 the  question  whether  a  shipowner  will
 change trade routes.
 Finally, I would like to say a few words
 about what has come to be called an incen-
 tive operating subsidy.  I have spoken about
 this issue at length in the past, and there is
 no reason to belabor it here.  But there is
 one common misconception which I would
 like to clear up.
 A number of people have told me of their
 impression that the incentive subsidy is an
 economy measure-that we.will somehow end
 up with a lower subsidy bill.  Nothing could
 be further from the truth.     An incentive
 subsidy may result In increased productivity,
 higher profits and wages, and relatively less
 need for subsidy.  But whatever the needs
 for subsidy may be they must be met if the
 industry is to continue.  No one argues with
 that basic truth.
 I think that $380 million Is a substantial
 sum and, as Maritime Administrator, I feel
 an obligation to insure that it is spent in
 the most productive way possible.  If it is
 being spent under a system which could be
 improved, then that standard has not been
 met.  If it isproducing one less ship than it
 could, and I remain silent, I am not doing
 m job.
 In the shipping business, like most others,
 profits may be Increased by cutting costs or
 increasing  revenues.  But  operators  have
 little incentive to reduce subsidizable costs
 under the present system, for the Govern-
 went will simply pay them less in subsidy.
 This puts a responsibility on the Govern-
 ment alone to maximize the public's return
 from its subsidy bill.  Often Government is
 forced to take positions which segments of
 labor and management find objectionable.
 But tinder the present system it Is inevitable.
 On the other side of the profit picture,
 one of the chief means for most businesses
 to increase the utilization of their capacity
 is by reducing rates.
 The conference system, however, precludes
 this.  It would seem obvious then that the
 system  could be  substantially  improved,
 especially by providing some meaningful in-
 centive to management and labor to cut
 costs--removing the Government from the
 process.
 As I see it, and as I hope you do, as well,
 there are many alternatives open to the
 American merchant marine.   Each of our
 TICLE BY DR. HARROP A. FREE-
 MAN, CORNELL LAW SCHOOL
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have inserted in
 the RECORD an article by Dr. Harrop A.
 Freeman, professor of law, Cornell Law
 School, Ithaca, N.Y., entitled, "A Specu-
 lation on Vietnam." I hope some of the
 aids at the White House will read it and
 at least give the President a review of
 the article, because it expresses the point
 of view that the President ought to be
 following, instead of the warmaking pol-
 icy he is following in Vietnam.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 A SPECULATION ON VIETNAM
 (By D:r. Harrop A. Freeman, professor of law,
 Cornell Law School, Ithaca, N.Y.)
 The current temper of most liberals and
 peace-minded persons in the United States
 seems compounded of shock and terror, as
 the U.N. General Assembly virtually dissolves
 and the United States steps up the war in
 Vietnam withno apparent readiness to ne-
 gotiate.  For myself, I prefer that the core
 of decision as to Vietnam be based on what
 the Vietnamese (north and south, Govern-
 ment and rebels) desire, and on the Viet-
 namese as people.  (I shall later make some
 suggestions as to how to bring this into the
 political picture).  The fact still remains
 that Vietnam has become a political problem
 not left to the Vietnamese and if there is
 to be any solution we must so deal with
 the problem.
 Without myself championing or advocat-
 ing that view, it may just be that politics
 see and are working out a solution either
 by design or accident, more immediate than
 we generally concede.  I propose to examine
 some of the relevant factors.
 It is generally agreed that the United
 States throughout the past century has been
 able to operate the Pacific Ocean as an
 American lake and has sought, but never
 really had, a foothold on mainland Asia
 (the  Dulles  family  has  been  central  to
 this movement).  The Defense Department
 found    the  network      of  British-French-
 Dutch possessions In Asia of utmost impor-
 tance in World War II against Japan, and
 cannot  tolerate the       thought that they
 should not be available in another Asian
 war  (e.g., against China).  The entry of
 Hawaii Into the Union, the independence
 of the Philippines, and the present stance
 of Japan have been used as further justifica-
 tion for, this policy.  France held the line
 in Indochina for 10 years till 1954.  We tried
 to persuade them and/or England to con-
 tinue.   After  the  Geneva  accord  moved

 The military  presence  has  only rendered
 more difficult the civil conflict and prevented

 For Secretary McNamara has clearly had

 McNamara has been a familiar Saigon visi-

 Taylor, is now Ambassador there; and U.S.

 by the Pentagon than by the State Depart-

 American defense plans during the past
 decade have carefully and expensively pre-

 least likely to,face,  And we have not in any
 major sense prepared to fight the kind of
 war both Russia and China surely intend
 to press.
 When  post-Stalinist  Moscow  endorsed
 peaceful coexistence it always reserved one
 vital area.  It openly promised to support,
 wherever possible, what it calls "wars of
 liberation."  Khrushchev tried  to play a
 trick on us in Cuba, but he had to back
 down because he was patently not engaged
 In a liberation war-only in directly threat-
 ening our vital interests.  Our strategy was
 prepared for such. a showdown.
 However, when the Communists stick to
 their own rules they have a demonstrated
 advantage.  The  modern  elaboration  of
 guerrilla  techniques  called "revolutionary
 warfare" by the Communists does not de-
 pend on heavy weapons or atomic arsenals.
 It depends upon simultaneous organization
 of partisan units and civilian administrators
 who seek to rot a selected country from
 within life fungus inside an apparently
 healthy tree.
 For years we refused to face the fact that,
 equipped as we were for holocaust, we had
 neither the trained manpower nor the polit-
 ical apparatus to_ fight revolutionary war-
 fare.                To some degree, under both President
 Kennedy and the brilliant McNamara, this
 was rectified-but only in part. Even today,
 when we have growing special service coun-
 ter-guerrilla units, some with kindergarten
 training  in revolutionary  warfare, we are
 abysmally behind.,
 It is expensive and ineffectual to blow up
 jungle acreage or fill It with paratroopers in
 search of vanishing guerrillas. And we have
 nothing capable of offsetting what revolu-

 There being no objection, the editorial

 as follows:

 Both the military and diplomatic aspects
 of the fighting In Vietnam are stepping up.
 For the first time, American jet bombers
 manned by American crews have been in op-
 eration  against  the  Communist  Vietcong
 guerrillas  in South Vietnam  (as distinct
 from strikes against North Vietnam).
 Diplomacy is engaged on a wide front in
 exploring chances for negotiating a settle-
 ment.  The activity includes the Paris-Mos-
 cow dialog, the quiet soundings of Prime
 Minister Wilson's government, and those of
 U Thant, Secretary General of the United
 Nations.
 Of all this subsurface seething, Mr. Thant's
 efforts (what has come to the surface, that
 is), seemed to be based on realism.  He is
 not advocating, he emphasizes, immediate
 withdrawal of American forces.  He recog-
 nizes that "some sort of stability" must come
 first.
 That is precisely why the Johnson admin-
 istration has refused  to commit itself to
 negotiations now. There can be no worth-

 PRESIDENT CAUTIONS CRITICS OF VIET POLICY
 NOT To FOMENT WAR-JOHNSON REPORTED
 IRKED BY COMMENTS WITHIN OWN PARTY
 (By Carroll Kilpatrick)
 President Johnson took note of the con-
 tinuing debate on Vietnam policy yesterday
 with                             a  warning  that  misunderstandings
 about America's true intentions could lead
 to war.
 With congressional critics apparently in
 mind, the President said that some of his
 predecessors have experienced more trouble
 from domestic than from foreign critics.
 The President, spoke at a White House cere-
 mony honoring winners of the Science Talent
 Search as new debate on Vietnam broke out
 on Capitol Hill.
 IKE HITS "SECOND-GUESSING"
 In Palm Desert, Calif., former President
 Eisenhower indirectly endorsed the  Presi-
 dent's position.
 After a meeting with new Republican Na-
 tional Chairman Ray C. Bliss, the former
 President said that "if we fail to recognize
 the responsibility of the President we will
 divide the country."
 General Eisenhower said that If he dif-
 fered materially with the President he would
 communicate  directly with him.  He said
 that he and Bliss were not going to try to
 "second-guess" the President,
 Mr. Johnson has been unusually annoyed,
 it has been said, by Democratic Senators who
 have assailed America's position in southeast
 Asia.
 "PEACE  IS  FIRST  PURSUIT"
 The President told the high school science
 winners that he hoped they would never ex-
 perience war.  He said he prayed every day
 that "we won't have to call" on America's
 young people to fight again.   "But rather
 than yield our liberty we will," he declared.
 While "peace is our first pursuit," he em-
 phasized, "we must defend freedom not only
 against enemies without but against enemies
 within.,"Some of the great Presidents who have
 lived in this house have found that misunder-
 standing in this country and problems that
 arose in this country, and leadership in this
 country, caused them really more troubles
 than leadership In the world," the President
 said.
 "That was true of Woodrow Wilson, that
 was true of Franklin D. Roosevelt, that was
 true of Harry S. Truman."
 It was even true of. President Eisenhower,
 Mr. Johnson added, "although i did all I
 could to minimize any of the great differ-
 ences."  Mr. Johnson was Senate Democratic
 leader during  General  Eisenhower's  two
 terms.
 The President said he had "not the slight-
 est doubt" that some wars have been brought
 about because  of  lack of            understanding
 "among our own people, and the fact that
 we conveyed the impressions to others which
 they accepted and acted upon which were not
 really 'representative of the         views  of  our
 country."
 While Mr. Johnson was speaking, Senate
 Majority Leader MIKE MANSFIELD Democrat,
 of Montana, told the Senate that the Presi-
 dent was "trying to keep the lid on a danger-
 ous volcano in southeast Asia."
 MANSFIELD  praised  the  administration's
 "white paper" on Vietnam and denied charges
 that the administration has no policy in Viet-
 nam.

 Nevada, commended PROxMIRE: for his speech, tin,,   aw nrnaTa.ms are unveiled almost daily
 a. "This is no time for negotiation.
 Even the discussion would lead our allies to
 believe we are abandoning them."
 Senator HUGH SCOTT, Republican, of Penn-
 sylvania, likewise strongly backed the Pres-
 ident.  He praised him for his "candid" brief-
 Ing to Senators and said that Mr. Johnson
 "made it perfectly clear we intend to stay
 in Vietnam until our responsibilities have
 been achieved."
 "To negotiate from weakness," SeoTr went
 on, "would be to transfer the war to Thai-
 land.  If Thailand goes, Burma goes, and
 India would be under the gun.  The question
 is where do you stop running.  We would
 cease to be a Pacific power', forced back' on
 Guam and the Hawaiian Islands."
 Senator  ERNEST  GRUENING,                Democrat,  of
 Alaska, a frequent critic of U.S. policy, said
 that the white paper added "no new facts

 The cooperation and advice that the busi-

 President Johnson.  In turn, corporate ex-

 because they are convinced the President
 realizes he needs a lasting partnership of
 business  and industry  with  the  Federal
 Establishment.
 Because industry and Government equally
 appreciate the present mutually advanta-
 geous rapport, businessmen are expected to
 travel to Washington in increasing numbers
 during the next few years, both as individual
 visitors and to attend meetings and conven-
 tions of their trade associations and other
 professional groups, insuring even greater
 development of the city.

 been disbursed by people investing in the
 hospitality services which cater to conven-
 tions and casual visitors alike.
 Lyndon B. Johnson adopted the Great So-
 ciety as his slogan soon after he became
 President.  His hopes and dreams were out-
 lined in generalities in last month's inau-
 gural speech and in his state of the Union
 address.  The annual budget message con-
 tained some details on implementation of
 the program, and there will be other special
 messages to Congress which hopefully will
 elaborate still more.
 The.principal objection so far raised to the
 Great Society is that it tries to provide--or
 at least to promise-something for every-

 DEATH OF DR. HERBERT CARLYLE
 LIBBY
 Mrs. SMITH.  Mr. President, in the
 passing of Dr. Herbert Carlyle Libby, of
 Waterville, Maine, and Pemaquid, Maine,
 the State of Maine has lost one of its most
 illustrious sons. He was an outstanding
 scholar and statesman and a leader of
 magnificent proportions.  The world in
 which we live was a better place because
 of him.
 He was one of the early political lib-
 erals in Maine although in his later years
 he grew more conservative. He was the
 wise counselor and friend of innumerable
 Maine citizens and he molded many of
 the young students he taught into future
 leaders.
 He was one of my very best friends for
 without him I would not now be in the
 U.S. Senate. In fact, he was the manager
 of my very first campaign back in 1940
 when I first ran for the House of Repre-
 sentatives. To him I owed so very much.
 In his passing, I extend my deepest
 sympathy to Mrs. Libby and the family.
 I ask unanimous consent that the lead
 editorial of the March 1, 1965, issue of
 the Waterville, Maine, Sentinel be placed
 in the RECORD at this point as it so ca-
 pably evaluates Dr. Libby.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Waterville (Maine) Morning Seri-
 tinel,-Mar. 1, 1965]
 HIS INFLUENCE SURVIVES HIM
 Colby College recently established a Her-
 bert Carlyle Libby Prize in Public Address.
 It. will go to the best speaker in the college
 and is a fitting memorial to the vigorous
 man for whom it is named.
 Dr. Libby, who died Saturday, had as one
 of his many duties while on the college staff
 the  instruction  of  public  speaking  and
 throughout his life he was an active par-
 ticipant in public affairs.
