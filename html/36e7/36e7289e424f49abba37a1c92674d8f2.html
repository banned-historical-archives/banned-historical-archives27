 North Korea Looks at
 Chinese Economic Reform
 Summary         North Korea, pressed by domestic and foreign economic problems and by
 Information available pressure from Beijing, is taking a careful look at the economic reforms that
 as of 27 March 1985 China has implemented since 1978. An unusually large number of high-
 was used in this report.
 level North Korean delegations have visited China in the last two years,
 where                              they have been lectured on the
 benefits of economic liberalization.
 We do not believe that P'yongyang is ready to go far enough with reform to
 improve the country's economic prospects substantially or its economic
 relations with the West. By allowing even a hint of liberalization, however,
 Kim II-song may be attempting to expand his options-and, perhaps more
 important, the options for his son and designated heir, Kim Chong-il-to
 pursue a more liberal economic program should the country's Marxist
 policies continue to achieve results far short of the accomplishments of
 South Korea and China.
 P'yongyang has already taken several measures that, at least on the
 surface, are consistent with a liberal reform program:
 ? The promulgation of a joint-venture law that allows foreign investment in
 North Korea.
 ? The promotion of light industry to improve living standards.
 ? An apparent effort to decentralize economic management and increase
 worker incentives.
 P'yongyang, however, has given no indication that it will accept features of
 market-oriented economies-such as widespread use of agricultural free
 markets and small-scale, private service-related enterprises-that we be-
 lieve are the key to China's recent economic success.
 Past mistakes, such as the massive borrowing to import Western capital
 equipment in the mid-1970s that was followed by default, continue to
 thwart the influx of foreign investment or even the development of a
 significant foreign trade sector, as does lack of access to natural export
 markets such as the United States and South Korea. More important,
 economic liberalization in China has come at a cost to the military-which
 now receives a smaller share of national resources-and some of the
 Communist Party's controls on the population have been weakened. In
 North Korea we see no signs that either the Army or the Korean Workers'
 Party is willing to relinquish the power that economic liberalization
 inherently would entail.

 Secret
 China's interest in trying to persuade North Korea to move toward
 economic liberalization stems from Beijing's concern that its own reforms
 could strain political links to a doctrinally conservative North Korea.
 Beijing appears to be willing to apply some pressure-refusing to increase
 economic aid to the North and allowing unofficial commercial links with
 South Korea to develop-but Chinese officials have told US diplomats
 they doubt they alone have enough influence to effect reform in North
 Korea. They warn that without Western encouragement-in the form of
 better political or economic relations-P'yongyang will be ripe for in-
 creased Soviet influence. Although North Korean-Soviet relations have
 improved over the past two years, we see no indication that Moscow is will-
 ing to increase significantly its economic aid to North Korea.

 Yaobang visited P'yongyang in May, and Kim II-song
 made a return trip to China in November (see appen-
 P'yongyang has kept a watchful eye on the economic
 policy shifts that have swept China in the nine years
 since Mao's death in 1976. These have helped China
 forge strong economic links to the United States and
 could lead to overt commercial links between China
 and South Korea. They have also induced remarkable
 economic growth in China. Key features of the re-
 forms include:
 ? An economic opening to the West that has greatly
 stimulated foreign trade and investment.
 ? A shift in priority from heavy industry to light
 industry with the intent of improving living
 standards.
 ? A decentralization of decisionmaking that, if fully
 implemented, will sharply increase the role of mar-
 ket forces at the expense of the party and the state
 planning apparatus.
 At least since Kim 11-song visited China in September
 1982, P'yongyang has been studying the Chinese
 economic reforms for possible adaptation. In Novem-
 ber 1982, for example, the North Korean party daily,
 Nodong Sinmun, reported that Kim had visited
 China's Sichuan Province (the birthplace of many of
 the reforms under the then governor and now premier,
 Zhao Ziyang) and expressed great interest in the new
 production responsibility system. This system, which
 has now largely replaced the Chinese commune sys-
 tem, gives farmers much more freedom to manage
 their farms and allows them to sell above-quota
 output in relatively open markets.
 Soon after Kim's visit to China
 a North Korean study group had
 visited the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone near
 Hong Kong-China's showplace for its reforms in
 action. According to press reports, four other North
 Korean delegations visited Shenzhen in 1983 and 10
 in 1984, including one in February 1984 led by
 Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam.
 Seven or eight other high-level economic delegations
 from the two countries exchanged visits in 1984,
 providing further opportunities for P'yongyang to
 dix A).
 A visit to China by North Korean Premier Kang
 Song-san last August is of particular interest. Kang, E
 an economic technocrat, was installed as premier in
 January 1984, just after a plenum of the Korean
 Workers' Party (KWP) announced new policies de-
 signed to promote light industry and exports. During
 his visit to China, articles in both the Chinese and
 North Korean press compared that plenum, the
 Eighth of the Sixth Party Congress, with the Chinese
 plenum of 1978 that had marked the ascendancy of
 Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang and the beginning
 of economic reforms
 much of Kang's visit was devote to
 discussions of light industry and that he toured a
 number of factories in Beijing and Shanghai produc-
 ing consumer goods
 ment noted, however, that, while the reforms were
 "unfolding a vigorous and bold struggle ushering in
 great prosperity for China," North Korea "would
 continue to work hard for socialist construction in the
 spirit of self-reliance."
 Kang's cautious statement notwithstanding, even Kim
 II-song recognizes that the North Korean economy
 stands in dire need of reform.

 Secret
 The current state of P'yongyang's long-term economic
 planning process also suggests a need for drastic
 reforms. In his New Year's address this January, Kim
 failed to mention either the Second Seven-Year Plan,
 which ended in 1984, or the Third Seven-Year Plan,
 originally scheduled to begin in 1985. Instead, he
 referred only to accomplishments of the one-year
 1984 plan and the prospects for the annual 1985 plan.
 We believe, therefore, that 1985 is being used as a
 buffer year before a new long-term plan begins in
 1986. Even with the buffer, P'yongyang will find it
 difficult to set reasonable goals, given the extent to
 which industry fell short of the 1984 goals set in 1978.
 We estimate that output in 1984 was only about two-
 thirds of planned levels.
 Because P'yongyang publishes little in the way of
 valid economic statistics, it is difficult to determine
 economic trends. Nonetheless,
 the economy continues to suffer
 from severe shortages of fuels and raw materials, long
 delays in the completion of investment projects, and
 low standards of quality, while the population endures
 threadbare living conditions. We estimate that eco-
 nomic growth has averaged only 3 to 4 percent yearly
 in recent years or about half the South Korean rate.
 North Korea's poor economic performance, in our
 view, stems from several factors:
 ? The high priority given the well-equipped, offensive-
 ly poised military establishment of 800,000 men.
 ? Kim's policy of running the economy at a pace far
 beyond the capabilities of its human and material
 resources.
 ? The Korean Workers' Party's petty tutelage over
 economic activity at the national, provincial, and
 local levels; Kim himself makes disruptive allocation
 changes in the course of his on-the-spot guidance to
 production facilities.
 ? The lack of foreign exchange and the deep-set policy
 of chu the (national and individual self-reliance),
 which have isolated North Korea from global tech-
 nological currents.
 We believe that only major changes in North Korean
 policies or striking reforms in the economic system
 will enable North Korea to improve its economic
 performance over the next 10 years.
 Viewed solely from an ideological perspective, P'yong-
 yang might have less difficulty liberalizing its econo-
 my than has China. North Korea has never experi-
 enced such extremes as the Great Leap Forward
 (1956-60) or the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), fol-
 lowing instead a relatively conservative economic
 course, more along the lines of Khrushchev and
 Brezhnev than Mao. From a practical viewpoint,
 however, North Korea faces serious obstacles to
 reform:
 ? The country's large foreign debt burden and poor
 reputation, which has cut it off from foreign credit.
 ? The reduction in defense spending needed to free
 25X1
 resources for light industry.
 ? The weakened party control resulting from in-
 25X1
 creased reliance on market forces.
 Opening to the West-A Second Try?
 To open the country to foreign trade and investment,
 for instance, P'yongyang must first settle or at least
 make a substantial downpayment on its $1.3 billion
 hard currency debt, which has been in arrears since
 1975. Although a jump in gold sales last year helped
 P'yongyang meet principal payments to some West
 European countries, North Korea missed interest
 payments to Japan and in recent months has again
 missed interest payments to European creditors. We
 believe it would take a sustained increase in hard
 currency exports and further debt payments to give
 North Korea access to new credits. Instead, North
 Korea has had to assign top priority to exporting to
 the Soviet Union and China to satisfy their demands
 that annual trading accounts be balanced.
 Chinese officials claim they had a major role in
 persuading P'yongyang to promulgate a foreign in-
 vestment law in September 1984, and indeed the law
 is very similar to one passed by Beijing in 1979.

 Joint ventures-in which foreign firms provide ma-

 output-in theory provide a way for North Korea to

 In 1984, according to media sources, some 1,400

 and more than likely produce goods of inferior

 ment record.
 Finland, for example, recently rejected a proposal for
 a $12 million nonferrous mining project proposal
 because of P'yongyang's outstanding debt. Other
 would-be investors do not believe P'yongyang has set
 up the complex legal structure that would be required
 to defend their interests. As a result, P'yongyang has
 registered only minor successes: some Japanese com-
 panies have invested in fishing ventures that can
 readily sell their produce in Japan, and a French firm
 is helping build a luxury hotel in P'yongyang. Finan-
 cial terms for the latter project have probably not yet
 been completed, however.
 Light Industry-Can It Compete With the Military?
 Experimenting with light industry to increase the
 supply of consumer goods and improve living stan-
 dards also faces difficulties. Since the Eighth Party
 Plenum in November 1983, North Korean media
 have touted light industry

 consumer goods, few new resources-either manpow-

 Given the economy's inability to meet current require-
 ments for raw and intermediate goods and the massive
 requirements imposed by the defense industry, it is no
 surprise the North Koreans have had difficulty estab-
 lishing light industrial factories capable of producing
 quality consumer goods. In fact, in his New Year's
 message, Kim II-song stated that top priority in 1985
 would go to mining, transportation, steel, and agricul-
 ture in that order, making only a vague reference to
 improvements in living standards. We believe P'yong-
 yang would need to significantly reduce military
 spending levels to allow more investment for light
 industry.
 Market Forces-A Threat to Party Control
 growth and efficiency.
 The most controversial, and what we believe to be the
 most important, of the Chinese reforms comes under
 the general concept of increased use of market
 forces--or economic levers as Chinese and now some
 North Korean literature refer to them-in economic
 decision making. This is closely related to the decen-
 tralization and removal of party politics from enter-
 prise- and farm-level management. China has by no
 means solved the problems associated with combining
 features of command and market economies at the
 enterprise level-in many ways it is just beginning to
 face them. Even so, by allowing some individual
 initiative to develop in agriculture and service indus-
 tries, Beijing has sparked major jumps in economic

 Secret
 January 1985 North Korea took a step toward decen-
 tralizing economic decision making by putting an
 "independent accounting system" into broader use.
 First implemented on a small scale in North Korea in
 1960 and similar to one adopted by China in 1979,
 this system is designed to make enterprises more
 responsible for their own profits and losses and to tie
 worker income more closely to productivity. Under
 the system, a portion of a worker's wages is dependent
 on the work unit's level of output. The individual unit,
 in turn, is given greater discretion in its methods for
 meeting state production targets and more account-
 ability for use of raw materials.
 The Nodong Sinmun and Kullola articles indicate
 that North Korean theorists believe this could lead to
 "capitalist tendencies." They nevertheless argue that
 in the transition period between capitalism and Com-
 munism it is just as dangerous to disregard the
 usefulness of market forces in helping to motivate
 workers and manage factories.
 A marked divergence from Chinese policy, however,
 can be seen in P'yongyang's attitude toward party
 management of the economy, at least as presented by
 the country's media. In an article discussing the
 independent accounting system, Nodong Sinmun, in
 December 1984, stated that, to prevent any "deviation
 in the slightest" from socialism, the party is imple-
 menting the independent accounting system in close
 coordination with the Taean Work System. The
 Taean Work System, established in 1962, assigns the
 KWP an important managerial function in every
 enterprise. Indeed, an article in Nodong Sinmun in
 November 1984 said, "The most important thing in
 increasing the production of consumer goods is to
 increase the role of party and government functionar-
 ies in local areas." Beijing, in contrast, is trying to
 remove the party from day-to-day management re-
 sponsibilities in the factories.
 A related issue is the replacement in China of the
 commune-oriented agricultural system with one that
 lets-farmers exercise more freedom in managing their
 farms and marketing their above-quota produce.
 North Korea has been generally tolerant of small
 private plots and rural markets, but in the 1970s the
 trend was toward increasing collective and state con-
 trol over farmers. In 1977, for instance, P'yongyang
 cut the maximum legal size for a private plot in half.
 Aside from Kim's expressed interest in China's new
 agricultural system in 1982, we have little evidence
 that P'yongyang has liberalized its policy.
 The tentative nature of P'yongyang's experiments
 suggests that North Korea is unlikely in the short
 term to take reforms far enough to make a major
 difference in its economic prospects. The economic
 needs are great, but the political and security costs-
 particularly the weakening of party control over the
 populace-of opening to the West and allowing mar-
 ket forces to operate, even on the scale now being
 allowed in China, must still appear prohibitive to
 P'yongyang.
 The flexibility that P'yongyang is exhibiting, even in
 terms of its modest reforms, suggests that over the
 longer term-most likely after the death of Kim Il-
 song-major changes in economic policy are possible,
 perhaps even likely. Certainly Kim has made it easier
 for his son, Kim Chong-il, to align himself with a
 reformist faction after the elder Kim's death if the
 situation warrants.'
 Whether North Korea takes a reformist path may
 depend in part on China-both the success of Bei-
 jing's own reforms and the degree to which it can
 pressure P'yongyang to follow suit. China's active
 interest in North Korean issues over the past year has
 been demonstrated by the number and level of official
 exchanges with North Korea and by Beijing's willing-
 ness to intercede on P'yongyang's behalf with Wash-
 ington and Tokyo on the issue of North-South talks.
 ' In a similar vein, we believe that Kim II-song's recent initiatives
 toward South Korea and improvement of relations with the Soviet
 Union may be designed to give Kim Chong-il more room for
 maneuver.

 stressed the need for North Korea to
 liberalize its economy and achieve some degree of
 economic parity with South Korea before talks of
 unification could be seriously entertained. Beijing
 claims, moreover, that Kim 11-song appears genuinely
 interested in reforms but that he needs a great deal of
 economic aid from China and better trade relations
 with the West for the reforms to succeed.
 The Chinese statements also include warnings that
 their ability to aid and influence North Korea is
 limited and that the Soviet Union may be using
 China's tilt to the West to gain advantage in P'yong-
 yang. North Korean-Soviet political relations have
 warmed over the past two years, but we have no
 indications that the Soviets are willing to provide
 more economic assistance. Despite being North Kor-
 ea's major supplier of oil and coal, Beijing finds it
 difficult to get P'yongyang to meet its annual export
 commitments, let alone make fundamental economic
 policy changes (see appendix B).
 Even at the risk of alienating North Korea, China is
 putting some pressure on P'yongyang.
 Beijing signed an aid agreement for
 North Korea's 1986-92 economic plan in January that
 offers no increase in the level of aid over the 1978-84
 plan period. P'yongyang had asked for a sharp in-
 crease, especially in oil deliveries. P'yongyang has
 made no mention of the aid agreement, which was
 given media treatment by the Chinese, a fact that we
 read as an indication of North Korean dissatisfaction.
 A more subtle and possibly more effective pressure
 tactic may be China's recent laissez faire attitude
 toward its own trade with South Korea, including its
 willingness to let key South Korean industrial leaders
 visit China and discuss joint venture projects. Public-
 ly, Beijing continues to disavow direct commercial
 links with South Korea, but we estimate that "unoffi-
 cial" trade is now above the level of Chinese-North
 Korean trade.'
 ' We estimate that South Korean-Chinese two-way trade in 1984
 totaled $625 million, compared with our estimated $600 million in

 North Korea-China:
 The Trade and Aid Relationship
 China's primary importance to North Korea, from an
 economic standpoint, is as a source for oil and coking
 coal. China provides about half of North Korea's oil
 and almost all of its coking coal. Oil exports have
 increased slowly over the last decade but, with that
 exception, the volume and scope of two-way trade
 have remained substantially the same since the mid-
 1970s (see figure 1).
 The major impediment to expanded trade is North
 Korea's inability or unwillingness to increase the
 volume of its exports to China. These consist primari-
 ly of anthracite coal, cement, nonferrous metals, and
 various manufactured goods.
 P'yongyang has suppli

 Beijing, meanwhile, has met about 85 percent of its    I
 commitments. This imbalance has led to a buildup of    0   1975    76     77     78     79     80     81     82    83

 purposes, shortfalls in North Korean transfers become

 Probably in response to large North Korean export
 shortfalls in 1983, China slashed its shipments to     30,000-barrel-per-day (b/d) refinery is the second

 tactics in 1978 and 1982. According to press articles, 1970s.) Ponghwa, served by a short pipeline from the
 P'yongyang in 1984 gave top priority to exports to     Chinese city of Dandong, processes all of the Daqing
 China and the Soviet Union. Moscow had also threat-
 ened to cut exports.
 China is also important to North Korea as a source
 for major industrial facilities, provided on an aid
 basis. This project aid, however, is much smaller than
 provided by the Soviet Union. The most important
 Chinese aid project in the Seven-Year Plan (1978-84)
 was the completion of the Ponghwa (also known as the
 Paengma-ri) petroleum refinery near Sinuiju. This
 crude oil imported from China.
 Other major Chinese aid projects include a recently
 completed papermill at Hysean, a 200-megawatt ther-
 mal power plant near Anju completed in the late
 1970s, equipment for a 30-kilometer expansion of  25X1

 fewer than 100 Chinese engineers were in North
 Korea helping with these projects in mid-1984, indi-

 Soviet Union has several hundred and perhaps as
 many as a thousand technicians in North Korea.
 Moscow boasts that it has provided the facilities that
 produce 63 percent of North Korea's electric power,
 50 percent of the petroleum refining and coal mining,
