 China:
 Agriculture in 1983
 and Prospects for 1984
 Key Judgments  China's agriculture in 1983 continued the five-year trend of rising output,
 Information available spurred by exceptionally good weather, increased inputs, and the continued
 as of 14 June 1984 expansion of personal economic incentives. The total value of agricultural
 was used in this report.
 output rose almost 10 percent last year to a record $158 billion. Grain pro-
 duction rose almost as rapidly, reaching a record 387 million tons. Cotton
 production continued its double-digit growth to 4.6 million tons, leading to
 the end of cotton rationing and a preliminary move into the raw cotton ex-
 port market. Beijing also cut back hemp and oil-bearing crops in order to
 reduce large existing stocks.
 Beijing's determination to continue peasant economic incentives was
 underscored early this year with the issuance of Central Document No. 1,
 which:
 ? Extends peasant land contracts from the current three years to at least 15
 years in an effort to encourage peasants to increase investment in their
 land.
 ? Permits peasants to subcontract their land to skilled farmers. Efficiency
 will be improved by allowing specialized production.
 ? Encourages individuals or cooperatives to pool funds and form large rural
 enterprises.
 ? Allows peasants to market their agricultural goods after state quotas
 have been satisfied.
 ? Provides for the formation of small market towns to employ peasants who
 have subcontracted their land.
 ? Exhorts cadre members to undertake more training and accept personal
 responsibility for their work.
 US grain sales to China were halved last year to 3.8 million tons, mainly
 because of a dispute over textile import quotas. China's total grain imports
 fell only 2.3 million tons, however, as Canadian and Argentine sales
 expanded. This year, purchases from each of the major exporting countries
 should approach pre-1983 levels. China will probably not, however, take
 delivery by yearend of all of the 8.2 million tons of US grain required to
 fulfill the Long-Term Grain Agreement. China's unusual purchasing
 tactics this year, moreover, make it difficult to determine their current
 level of grain purchases. The Chinese will probably want to negotiate a new
 grain agreement with the United States to replace the current pact, which
 expires at yearend, but improved domestic food supply and declining world
 prices will prompt Chinese buyers to drive a hard bargain.
 At this early date, prospects for China's 1984 winter grain harvest appear
 good.

 China:
 Agriculture in 1983
 and Prospects for 1984
 Gains in 1983
 Agriculture posted a second consecutive year of dra-
 matic growth in 1983. Grain production, the key
 indicator of the agricultural economy, jumped over 9
 percent to a record 387.3 million tons, according to
 figures released in April by the State Statistical
 Bureau (SSB). Other sectors had even more impres-
 sive gains, aided by an increasing number of peasants
 engaged in rural industry and by the implementation
 of the responsibility system' in forestry production
 (see table 1). The total value of agricultural produc-
 tion grew by 9.5 percent, more than double the goal of
 4 percent for the year.
 Living standards for Chinese peasants continued to
 improve, although they remain well below the world
 average. Per capita income rose 15 percent to an
 average of $157 last year. The gap with urban
 residents continued to narrow as urban incomes rose
 only 6 percent to an average of $266. Living expenses
 in rural areas rose 13 percent to $126 leaving an
 average of $31 per person for savings or investment.
 Per capita income figures are beginning to have less
 significance, however, as peasant incomes diverge
 under the responsibility system. The Chinese press
 has carried numerous stories of exceptional peasant
 families that, having reaped large profits from spe-
 cialized production last year, have yearly incomes in
 excess of $5,000. Some have purchased trucks or cars,
 and one even bought an ultralight airplane
 Production increased last year because of several
 factors, including the further relaxation of rural poli-
 cies under the responsibility system. The production
 and use of inputs also rose (see table 2). Demand for
 these inputs continued to exceed supply, with the
 exception of conventional tractors. Peasants in most
 areas have preferred to purchase their own hand, or
 garden type, tractors since the advent of the responsi-
 bility system. Over 40 percent of the tractors in use

 last year were privately owned. The exceptionally
 good weather last year also contributed. Only isolated
 areas in central and southern China suffered damage
 from early summer floods, which were overplayed in
 the Chinese and Western press.
 Grain Crops
 The SSB's annual communique reports total grain
 production for 1983 at 387.3 million tons, rising 9.2
 percent or roughly 34 million tons, the largest in-
 crease in PRC history.' Since the adoption of the
 responsibility system in late 1978, the Chinese have
 increased their total grain production by 83 million
 tons-more than the entire annual grain production of
 Canada and Australia combined. And despite a 2.6-
 million-ton decline in net grain imports last year, per
 capita grain availability rose 26 kilograms to a record
 391 kilograms.'
 ' Last year's communique reported 1982 production at 353.4
 million tons, implying an increase in 1983 of 9.6 rather than 9.2
 percent. The Chinese evidently have readjusted 1982 production up
 to 354.5 million tons.

 Production gains last year were well distributed geo-
 graphically (see figure 1). Wheat production posted
 the largest increase, benefiting from a larger sown
 area and good weather (see table 3). Henan's impres-
 sive showing reflects the fact that it is China's
 premier wheat producer. The output of miscellaneous
 grains, primarily corn, made the second-largest gain.
 Jilin and Liaoning grow predominantly corn. Jilin's
 harvest last year rose a remarkable 48 percent from
 record 1982 levels. Reporting for the northeast prov-
 inces has noted that 1983 was the first year these
 provinces had fully implemented the responsibility
 system; less mention was made of the nearly ideal
 The only province suffering any real problems last
 year was Xizang. The grain harvest there dropped 20
 percent, the second straight decline because of
 drought. The region's economy, based primarily on
 livestock production, was further damaged last year
 by livestock disease, insects, and a shortage of inputs.
 Problems supplying the remote province were com-
 pounded by limited ground transportation, leading the
 State Council to order 100 tons of livestock fodder
 airlifted to the province.

 a For comparability, tubers are converted to grain equivalent by the
 weight ratio of 5 to 1.
 Transport problems for the rest of the country cen-
 tered on how to purchase, move, and store the im-
 mense increase in grain production. Grain sales to the
 state jumped 35 percent to 97 million tons, filling all
 grain warehouses and forcing authorities in some
 areas to pay peasants to store the grain earmarked for
 state procurement. In some areas local authorities
 simply stopped purchasing above-quota grain, a move
 strictly prohibited by Beijing because of its dampen-
 ing effect on peasant enthusiasm. The large purchases
 turned out to be a mixed blessing for the leadership,
 however, as Finance Minister Wang Bingqian attrib-
 uted most of last year's above- Ian deficit        e
 agricultural purchases.
 Nongrain Enterprises
 Cotton production rose sharply in 1983 because of
 excellent yields in the North China Plain (see table 4).
 The continued large increase in cotton production-
 coupled with an increase in synthetic fiber production,
 reduced domestic demand for cotton fabric, and
 tighter restrictions by textile-importing countries-
 has led to a growing stockpile of raw cotton. Cotton,
 rationing was abolished in December, after 30 years.
 China also has begun exporting some raw cotton.
 Initial interest was low, however, because the size of
 Chinese bales did not meet international standards
 and buyers were unfamiliar with the quality of Chi-
 nese cotton. Subsequent offerings are expected, and
 buyers may be more interested once the quality is
 known. And Chinese officials have stated they plan to
 "New Cotton Procurement Policy").
 increase bale size to international standards. Whether
 China will remain a cotton exporter, and thus a
 competitor with the United States, will depend on the
 impact of new procurement policies (see section,
 The reductions in oil-bearing crops and hemp were
 planned to reduce large existing stocks. Poor procure-
 ment policies were blamed for tea production leveling
 off. Sugarcane output declined largely because of
 poor weather but was partially offset by sugar beet
 production, which had good weather and an expansion
 The number of live hogs at yearend declined slightly,
 probably reflecting a continued decline in the number
 of hogs owned by collectives and peasants moving into
 other, more profitable sideline enterprises (see table
 5). Efficiency of the livestock industry improved, as
 evidenced by the increase in meat supplies. Mixed
 livestock feed production rose 17 percent last year to 7
 million tons. Many individual producers increased
 their production of freshwater fish last year to take
 advantage of a 13.4-percent rise in prices. Overall,
 however, purchase prices for agricultural commodities
 increased only 4.4 percent in 1983.
 1983 Trade
 The dispute over textile quotas highlighted Sino-US
 agricultural trade in 1983. Early in the year China
 announced an embargo on US soybeans, cotton, syn-
 thetic fibers and that it was reducing the purchase of
 other US agricultural commodities because of US
 textile import quotas. The ban on soybeans and cotton
 was largely symbolic; bumper Chinese harvests were
 already reducing the need for imports. US cotton
 shipments totaled only $2 million for the year, declin-
 ing for the third straight year (see table 6).
 The ban had its greatest impact on sales of US wheat,
 for which China had been the largest market. China's
 retaliation was facilitated by its own consecutive
 record harvests and by large supplies and attractive
 prices in other exporting countries. This allowed

 Beijing to make up much of the shortfall by increas-
 ing purchases from Canada and Argentina (see figure
 2). The Chinese had in fact been cutting back on
 purchases of the relatively expensive US wheat since
 late in 1982, several months before the embargo was
 declared.
 The embargo was lifted in early September, but
 purchases did not resume in time to meet the 6-
 million-ton minimum of grain called for in the Long-
 Term Grain Agreement. Last year was the third year
 of the four-year pact, and the first time Chinese
 purchases had fallen below the minimum.
 New Policies for Peasants
 Late last year Beijing initiated a series of directives,
 conferences, and press campaigns calling for a further
 relaxation of rural policies. Several factors probably
 combined to cause the leadership to press for the new
 rural policies. Bumper harvests, the fifth in a row
 since economic reforms were initiated, encouraged the
 leadership to give an even freer rein to the sector of
 the economy that has been the most responsive to and
 supportive of its economic reforms. Other nationwide
 campaigns, notably party rectification and the crack-
 down on crime, also created the proper atmosphere for
 requiring more personal economic responsibility, par-
 ticularly from rural cadre. Moreover, the success of
 some rural reforms required other changes. For exam-
 ple, the increased volume of agricultural production

 has required the liberalization of commercial and
 transport policies. The state's existing storage, trans-
 port, and commercial systems simply cannot handle
 all of the goods.
 Most of the new policies are embodied in Central
 Document or Zhongfa No. 1 for 1984. For the last
 three years, the party has devoted its first important
 directive to a liberalization of rural and agricultural
 policies. This year, local commentaries have cited
 Central Document No. 1 as a guideline for all sectors
 of the economy (see inset, page 8).
 Although the document was not published until June,
 Beijing made extraordinary efforts to publicize its
 main points. In January and February, Peoples Daily
 carried articles or commentaries promoting the poli-
 cies almost daily. Every province has called meetings
 to study the document, and it is clear the new
 guidelines are being disseminated to the lowest level.

 cated that the contents of the document had been

 Old Objections From Cadre
 Cadre resistance to agricultural reform, though di-
 minishing, has still not ceased. US Consulate officials
 traveling in Guangxi Province early this year found
 cadre who were firmly opposed to the new reforms
 and would not acknowledge that the new policies
 would be implemented in their areas. This typifies the
 belief of many cadre, especially at middle and grass-
 roots levels, that the reforms are not truly socialist
 and eventually will be discarded. Other cadre have
 more personal reasons for disliking the reform poli-
 cies. Many stand to lose their influence over peasants
 and some, even their jobs. The crackdown on econom-
 ic crime and the party rectification campaign have
 both led to numerous transfers, demotions, and dis-
 missals of corrupt or politically unsupportive rural
 leaders. There are even some preliminary indications
 that rural economic cadre will be held accountable if
 their localities do not show a substantial increase in
 peasant income within two or three years.
 These actions by Beijing will probably polarize cadre
 response to the new policies. Exposed or fearful cadre

 Central Document No. 1 for 1984-Summary of
 Major Points
 1. Past policies are lauded as improving agricul-
 ture, and readers are encouraged to continue fol-
 lowing the state's leadership.
 Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang have consistently
 cited success in agricultural reform as their most
 important achievement, and they are using it to push
 reform in other sectors.
 2. Tasks for 1984 are to raise productivity, im-
 prove marketing and distribution of products, and
 produce more goods for market by improving the
 responsibility system.
 He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, subsequently stat-
 ed that expansion of the responsibility system in 1984
 will focus on commune- and brigade-run enterprises,
 rural technologies, farm tools, animal husbandry in
 the grazing areas, and the fishing sector.
 3. Peasant land contracts with the state are to be
 lengthened to at least 15 years. Longer contracts
 will be signed for projects such as fruit and timber
 production. Peasants who want to quit farming
 and engage in other enterprises are encouraged to
 subcontract their land to skilled farmers.
 Contracts longer than the current three years were
 deemed necessary, we believe, to bolster peasant
 confidence that the current policies will continue.
 Peasants have been reluctant to invest their own labor
 and funds in land they may soon have to return to the
 state. Lengthening the contracts may be particularly
 important now, as some areas are redistributing their
 land to make plots larger and more economical. Such
 redistribution, according to the document, should be
 done only if the majority of peasants wish, and
 peasants should be reasonably compensated for any
 improvements they have made to their land. Only
 contracted land, and not the smaller private plots, is
 eligible for subcontracting. The peasants are free to
 negotiate the transfer, but it must be approved by the
 collective. Subcontracting is designed to encourage
 peasant families to improve their production by spe-
 cializing in one enterprise, which many have already
 done. Early this year 25 million peasant families, or
 13 percent of the nation's total, were involved in full-
 time specialized production or trade.
 Peasants and collectives are also encouraged to pool
 their money and become shareholders in rural enter-
 prises, particularly those, such as mining, for the
 exploitation of natural resources.
 Regulations allowing the hiring of up to two assistants
 or five apprentices are to be continued. The new
 regulations also state that enterprises which hired
 more workers than permitted but which show some
 degree of meeting the criterion of a cooperative
 enterprise should not be considered capitalist.
 4. All state organizations are to vigorously support
 agriculture. Supply and marketing cooperatives
 and regional economic cooperative organizations
 are to expand and become rural multipurpose
 service centers.
 The Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives are to
 provide better financial services. Chinese media re-
 porting indicates that a dramatic increase in funds has
 been made available in the countryside, particularly
 for households involved in specialized production.
 Such figures are unreliable, however, because there is
 no nationwide definition of a specialized, key, or
 priority household. And even local areas have had
 trouble designating the specialized households that
 are eligible for special loans and bonuses.
 5. Procurement and transportation have not kept
 pace with the development of production.
 Although the economy will remain planned, a call is
 made to decrease the volume and number of commod-
 ities procured by quotas, and the state will ease its
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP85TOO31OR000100160001-8

 Confidential
 control of some prices. This will improve distribution
 while lowering state procurement costs. Obviously,
 private enterprise and a market economy are expected
 to fill in the gap. Subsequent regulations indicate that
 peasants are free, once state quotas are filled, to
 market goods across administrative borders. To trans-
 port the goods, peasants are permitted, either individ-
 ually or jointly, to form their own transportation
 services. They may own or lease motor vehicles,
 vessels, or tractors.
 6. Local governments are to maintain public funds
 sufficient to cover their public-business expenses.
 Government organs are not to charge excessive fees
 for services performed in the countryside.
 Peasants are to cut down on nonproductive expenses
 and reduce the number of cadre, although the salary
 for the remaining cadre should be reasonable. Gov-
 ernment departments cannot require additional levies
 to finance services outside annual local budgets. Such
 fees were reportedly used last year to punish success-
 ful rural entrepreneurs.
 7. Peasant families that leave farming by subcon-
 tracting their land are to engage in small indus-
 tries or service trades in rural areas.
 Beijing planners have said elsewhere they believe 30
 to 40 percent of the rural labor force is surplus. By the
 year 2000, only 30 percent of the rural labor force is
 to remain in crop cultivation; 20 percent in forestry,
 livestock, and fishery production; 10 percent working
 in cities, factories, and mines; and 40 percent in local
 industry and services. Central Document No. 1 indi-
 cates that initial development will be focused on the
 fodder, food, building materials, and small energy
 industries. These industries are to develop in rural
 market towns, keeping peasants from migrating to
 major urban centers. Before yearend each province is
 to select small towns to develop as trial market towns.
 8. Forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery poli-
 cies are to be relaxed to encourage production.
 Grass and trees belong to the person sowing them and
 are inheritable and transferable at a discount rate.
 The responsibility system should be used for both
 livestock and grassland management.
 State farms are to continue implementing the respon-
 sibility system by contracting to households, or to
 mechanical farming teams in areas that are heavily
 mechanized. The farms may also sign contracts with
 nearby peasant families for products or services.
 9. A nationwide cadre training program is to be
 established this year at the county level.
 Cadre and technicians will receive training on a
 rotating basis in the next three to five years in politics,
 science and technology, and management. Rural
 cadre-low in education and scientific or manage-
 ment skills-have often delayed implementation of
 rural policies. Training courses will be designed to
 promote more responsive and efficient local leader-
 ship.
 10. While supporting the new policies, the party
 must work harder to educate peasants ideological-
 ly and politically.
 The easing of economic restrictions must be distin-
 guished from unchanging ideological principles and
 standards for economic crime. Cadre who misuse the
 relaxed restrictions for personal profit are to be dealt
 with severely. The short shift given to ideology is an
 attempt, in our judgment, to avoid arousing confusion
 and debate in rural areas. The ideological justification
 for current rural policies is still highly contentious.

 Confident, Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/19: CIA-RDP85TOO31OR000100160001-8
 will probably be more willing to toe the line. Those
 with political connections or sympathetic superiors are
 likely to drag their feet even more. In either event,
 cadre ideologically opposed to the reforms are now
 more at odds with Beijing and with the peasants,
 particularly those families in specialized production
 earning much more than the cadre themselves. F_
 Prospects for 1984 Crops
 Production this year will benefit from the implemen-
 tation of the new agricultural policies and a continued
 rise in agricultural inputs. If the weather cooperates,
 China will reap its sixth consecutive bumper harvest.
 The 1984 winter wheat crop, which accounts for 85
 percent of the total wheat crop, was sown in good
 conditions last fall. The area continued to expand
 slightly and the harvest could approach last year's
 record crop. The growing season has been dry in some
 parts of the North China Plain, but as of late May we
 see no major problems.
 Spring wheat in the northeast, which accounts for the
 remainder of the wheat crop, had adequate moisture
 for planting this spring. The early rice crop is pro-
 gressing well in the Changjiang Valley, where wet
 weather has delayed the planting of intermediate rice,
 cotton, and coarse grains.
 It is still too early to determine any changes in sown
 area for fall-harvested crops. Projecting the planted
 area is further complicated this year by changes in the
 procurement policies for cotton.
 New Cotton Procurement Policy
 For this year's crop, cotton will switch from the quota-
 procurement system to what is called the proportional
 method. Much like the quota system, this method sets
 in advance a base price and an increased price. But
 the proportional method simply divides total cotton
 production between the two categories according to a
 fixed formula. There are no negotiated sales. In the
 northern cotton area (north of the Chang Jiang), 20
 percent of the cotton will be procured at the base price
 and 80 percent at the increased price. In the southern
 area, 60 percent will be sold at the base price and 40
 percent at the increased price.`
 This method was used effectively last year to control
 rapeseed production. In 1982 more rapeseed was
 produced than the state could purchase and store. For
 1983 the state set procurement levels, paying for 40
 percent at the base price and 60 percent of production
 at an increased price. No state purchases of above-
 quota product were made. Consequently, peasants
 saw less profit in growing rapeseed and shifted more
 land and attention to winter wheat, which is grown at
 the same time. This contributed to the 24-percent
 decline in rapeseed and 19-percent increase in winter
 wheat production last year.
 Peasant response to the change in cotton procurement
 is difficult to predict. The changes appear designed to
 slow the growth in cotton production and further shift
 production from the southern areas to the north.
 Peasants in each area will be evaluating the weather
 at planting time and the profitability of growing
 cotton under the new guidelines. They will consider
 the abolition of both the 5-percent price subsidy for
 cotton produced in the north and the grain and
 fertilizer bonuses for cotton sales. State officials have
 emphasized that, unlike rapeseed, above-quota pur-
 chases of cotton will still be made.
 Trade in 1984
 Sino-US grain trade will rebound from last year's low
 level, but total shipments may not reach 8.2 million
 tons, the level required to fulfill the 6-million-ton
 annual minimum called for in the bilateral Long-
 Term Grain Agreement (LTA), plus the 2.2-million-
 ton shortfall from the 1983 quota. Although the
 Chinese have periodically pledged to purchase the full
 amount, there was little market activity during the
 first four months of 1984. Purchases of US grain
 through April totaled only 3.2 million tons of wheat.
 Of this amount, less than half had been delivered,
 ' Because producton levels from previous years are used to establish
 the proportion procured at the base price, this formula is not as
 disadvantageous to the southern provinces as the ratios imply.

 averaging 350,000 tons per month. Shipments must
 proceed at two and a half times this pace for the rest
 of the year to fulfill the LTA, which only counts grain
 that has left US ports by yearend
 Chinese grain traders have shown more interest in
 early May, however. President Reagan's trip to China
 in April and the lower price of this year's US wheat
 crop have probably encouraged purchases. US grain
 traders now believe the Chinese are prepared to take
 delivery of the entire 8.2 million tons in 1984.
 We believe that it is optimistic to expect the Chinese
 will take delivery of the full amount by yearend. It is
 particularly difficult this year to assess Chinese inten-
 tions, or even their current level of purchases, because
 of Beijing's deceptive purchasing tactics.
 contracts for 4 to 4.5
 million tons of US grain have been made orally, but
 not in writing. Also, the Chinese have stated privately
 since late last year that they have purchased roughly
 1.5 million tons of US grain that has not been entered
 in US export statistics; US firms report substantial
 grain sales to China via Japanese firms, which do not
 have to register the sale or destination until delivery.
 Japanese trading houses could also offer the advan-
 tages of lower interest rates and other nongrain
 concessions. Beijing's motivation for the secretive
 activity with US firms could be to purchase as much
 of the 8.2 million tons as possible before the market
 becomes convinced that China will purchase the full
 amount and prices rise. Even those grain traders who
 are convinced the LTA will be fulfilled must negotiate
 at a disadvantage because of their lack of information
 on Chinese purchases. Chinese traders are very astute
 in playing the US grain market. Their cancellation
 and subsequent repurchase of US grain in late May
 and early June, for example, netted China several
 million dollars from changes in market prices. F_~
 Nonmarket factors again could play a part in deter-
 mining this year's sales. Beijing continues to politicize
 grain trade by linking purchases to other bilateral
 irritants, such as the lack of a maritime agreement. If
 bumper harvests continue to fill all of China's grain
 storage, the ability to store the imported grain could
 limit China to purchasing, but not actually taking
 delivery of the entire amount before yearend. Grain
 imports from Canada and Argentina will decline this

 bound following the drought-inhibited sales of last
 year.
 The Chinese have stated their desire to renegotiate
 the US-Chinese LTA which expires this December.
 China's domestic food supply situation has changed
 dramatically since most of its LTAs were signed four
 years ago (see table 7). That, coupled with a buyer's
 market for grain worldwide, places less pressure on
 Beijing to sign LTAs, as evidenced by the failure to
 renegotiate the agreement with France that expired in
 May 1983. But Chinese planners expect grain imports
 to remain strong in the near future, even with good
 domestic harvests, and LTAs would guarantee sup-
 plies. Thus, Beijing will probably try to renegotiate
 agreements with its largest suppliers, for both political
 and economic reasons, although it may press for more
 flexibility. For example, China may want to commit
 itself to lower minimum annual purchases or to
 averaging yearly minimums over the life of the agree-
 ment.
 Timber sales should rise again this year, marking the
 only other bright spot for US commodity trade. The
 Chinese could reenter the US soybean market to
 replace sales of their own higher value beans to Japan,
 but any purchases should be small with little or no
 impact on the market.
