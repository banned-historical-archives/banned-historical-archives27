 Carter- Oil Equipment* Decision
 Doesn't Worry Soviet Industry
 Journal of Commerce Special
 The Carter administration's
 recent decision to make all oil
 equipment sales to the Soviet
 Union subject to special gov-
 ernment review and a specific
 export licence in response to
 the Soviet government's im-.
 prisonment of dissidents will
 not effect the overall develop-
 ment of the Soviet oil indus-
 . try, according-to Zandar ..
 Takoyev, deputy-minister of
 the oil industry. ' .
 In a recent interview, Mr.
 Takoyev said that the kind of
 foreign equipment which. the
 Soviet Union intends to import
 to speed up development and
 increase the efficiency of its
 oil and gas industry was also
 available from other suppliers
 in Western Europe, Comecon
 and Japan. Any embargo
 would merely rebound on U.S.
 industry, he added. '
 The first major contract to
 be affected by President
 Carter's decision is the $144
 million oil drill bit plant to be
 supplied by Dresser Industries
 (although it appears that this
 sale will be permitted to go
 through).
 But Mr. Takoyev also re-
 ferred to Sen. Henry Jackson's
 demand for' a ban on the
 export of submersible pumps.
 "Mr. Jackson should not try to
 bully us. We shall be produc-
 ing 10,000 submersible pumps
 ourselves this year and a big
 new plant is due to come on
 stream in. Tatara next year
 which will cover all out
 needs," he said.
 According to a recent CIA
 discussion a  r presented to
 the East- est rade Adviso
 ommittee, the Soviet Union    i
 purchas       i ion worth of
 western oil an  as equpmeat,
 an  know-how pus a further
 $4 billion worth of large die-'
 meter pipe in the 1972/76..
 period. The     : share on
 amounted to $550 million. But
 this includes over 1,000 sub-
 mersive purros wit a ' tm;
 capacity ,of more than 3 mil-
 on                                                                    rre s Qer day w, is
 have played a significant role
 in sta itizung production o the
 a m  ra - o a of to ds.
 The United States is also
 recognized to have considera-_ .
 ble technical expertise in the  -
 production of high quality bits.
 for deep drilling, a fact which.,
 is acknowledged by the plan to
 import such a bit plant from
 Dresser Industries.
 The Soviet Union's need to
 import substantial quantities..
 of Western equipment is-
 largely due to the sheer scale .
 of the Soviet exploration and .
 production effort but also re-,
 flects relative technical back-
 wardness in areas like:.
 accurate deep seismic ana-
 lysis, deep drilling techniques- '; .
 and equipment and. offshore.
 technology.
 This technology gap exists.
 largely because most of the_,'.
 expansion of the oil and gas,
 industry up to the late 1960s.
 was concentrated on large and - . .
 relatively accessible onshore:.-
 fields like the Urals-Volga...
 Here technology was devel-.
 oiled to exploit oil and gas-
 from relatively shallow hard
 rock formations. But the ex.
 pansion eastward into Siberia -
 and the existence of large,
 potential deposits in inland sea
 areas like the Caspian aria.
 offshore areas like the Bar-
 ents Sea and off Sakhaliis

 For a good many bright, sophisticated and ordinarily
 skeptical Alnericans, getting into the People's Repub-
 lic of China at this point would be.about as attractive
 as whiniing.a million dollars by taking part in a chain-
 letter operation. Thus it is that some   50 SUCK persons
 have lent their names to a projected China tour that
 has been promoted, somewhat along the lines of a chain
 letter. Each prospect has passed the word along to his
 friends, and most of them have thought someone else
 must have checked into the background, reputation
 and financial 'responsibility of are obscure "Dr. Fr'uill"
 who was behind the scheme and was said to be ex-

 Thomas Lruin, the proprietor, then engaged mainly
 in handling tours to America by groups 'of German and
 Japanese students. He rewarded Arizona householders
 who put them up by promising their free trips to Ger-
 manly or Japan.
 The China tour plan took shape when Fruin went to
 Japan in February and March, a few weeks before the
 celebrated ping-pang match. Louis Prescott says Fruin
 sent back, word  that  Chinese sources there had told
 hull that an American delegation of 250 persons might
 be admitted to China. Later they decided on smaller
 delegations of 75 to 25 each, groul)edi into fields of
 .interest. They incorporated the new venture in May
 as World Youth Visit Exchange Association USA, with
 Pruitt as board chairman.
 former Senators I'Vaylle Morse of Oregon and E1llest James Prescott has  said  that Morse and Greening
 Gruening of Alaska, though Morse issued a statement would be co-chairmen of all "international relations"
 after some premature publicity in Seattle denying that delegation. They were approached after Senator War,

 The Eminent Domain'of the Educational Testing Service
 By Ed Kiersh .f
 Secluded by 400 acres of woods and streams, Henry I
 singer, Zbigniew Brzezinski, General Alexander Haig, David
 Rockefeller, IBM Board Chairman Frank Cary, and several
 prime ministers met recently in a Cape Cod-style building
 in Princeton, New Jersey. The group was platting strategy,
 for a highly secret "Future of the World" conference. They'd
 sought this Camp David-like isolation to discuss world de-
 struction scenarios, defense pacts, and-trade alignments.
 But the site, in addition to providing a maximum-security
 backdrop for think-tank speeches, also offered other diver-
 sions. Delegates had a choice of jogging trails, hiking paths,
 tennis courts, luxurious sleeping accommodations, and gour-
 met dining rooms. Most importantly, however, guests were
 able to renew old friendships with other"powers" at tbecon-~
 ference-their hosts from the Educational Testing Service,
 who are, perhaps deservingly, called "the gatekeepers to the-
 world:'
 .
 Untaxed, unregulated, and unaccountable to the millions
 of Americans who take standardized tests; the Educational
 Testing Service is a kingdom unto itself. Secrecy has been a
 trademark since the organization's birth in 1948, so perhaps
 it's symbolic that Kissinger, Brzezinski, & Co. chose the
 sprawling ETS -"campus" for their conference last spring.
 But since ETS's yearly gross is $80 million, and because its
 network of contacts extends.as far as the White House and
 CIA, symbols are hardly important. The cold realities of the
 corporation are more intriguing.
 Created by the College Entrance Examination' Board,
 American Council on Education, and Carnegie Foundation,
 as a nonprofit test developer, ETS has gone far beyond the
 Ed KiersTr has done inverrigatire reporting for Newsday, New
 simple aclministratior ` of  e' Scholastic Aptitude Tests or
 Graduate Records. Today, TS is an Orwellian empire. The
 company supervises over 300 testing programs (14 per cent of
 all.U.S. testing), and its assets have grown from $1.4 million
 in 1948 to more: than $25 million in 1978. Millions also come
 from government and `foundation research grants. But
 ETS's $80 million yearly gross, compared to its nearest com-
 petitor's $20 million (the American College Testing Pro-
 gram), is attributable mainly to its near-monopoly in several
 educational areas.            =
 Students are essentially captive consumers. Academic or
 professional advancement hinges on filling in multiple-choice
 blanks with just the right amount of. lead from number-two
 pencils on ETS tests like the law boards, Graduate Manage-
 ment Admission Test, or Multi-State Bail Exam. Moreover,
 the potential for abuse becomes more likely as the ETS 'con-
 glomerate expands into diverse fields such as the Student
 Search Service (a financial. and. personal history' inventory
 used for college recruitment); the Law School Data Assess.
 bly Service (another fact-findins program used in admissions
 offices); elementary and high. school 3ninitnuns-competency
 exams; and 50 vocational-licensing tests..
 ` One such threat comes from ETS's linla to the CIA. it's
 interesting. that ETS has hired psychometricians from the
 Office of Strategic Services (the CIA's Word War II fQrerun?:
 ner), and. that CIA entrance exams are devised at Princeton.
 Orm might ask whether the 'CIA has access to ETS comput-
 ers-the data banks that hold statistical information on more
 than 15 million Americans. Foreign students also file finan-
 cial or personal history reports with ETS when they use pro-
 grams such as the Student Search Service, and consequently,
 they too could be targeted for CIA surveillance..        -

 A personality assessment Is simply a guide-to an indi
 vidual's behavior. It describes his weaknesses and strengths,
 'predicts' actions and reactions," and suggests how he can
 be influenced. The psychologist preparing an assessment
 for the agency asks: What are the person's principles? His
 habits? Is he a drinker, awoman-chaser, a reader, a jogger,,
 a hockey fan, a chess player, a.chain-smoker, a'dog ]over,
 a Sunday morning gardener? Who are his friends?.Where.
 is he from? Who was his father?
 Usually the psychologist is unable to interview the,
 subject. So he works with photographs and reports provided
 by agents and other Government employees and informants,
 published materials, and official records. Whenever possible
 the psychologist likes to have a tape-recording of his sub-
 ject's voice to analyze .`..
 Personality assessment in one form or'another is as
 old as the intelligence profession. But it received increased
 emphasis in- the early 1950's from Allen W. Dulles, then
 the director of the agency:. Mr. Dulles had sought neurologi-
 cal treatment for his son, who had been -seriously injured
 in Korea. He went :to see Dr.-Harold, G. Wolfe-, a New
 York neurologist.- Mr. Dulles became interested in research

 But nothing gave the agency the` formula it sought
 for creating its own Manchurian `candidate. And, last week,
 under attack again-for having violated ethical norms in
 the r psychological experiments; agency officals maintained
 t-Xat-they were through tampering with the human. mind.
 They hastened to add, however, that they` had not aban-

 of psychiatry that was perhaps the most benign and may
 have been the only blossom in a rank garden:. The construc=

 political figures.                     : `.
 "The work we're doing now does not involve attempts :
 to modify behavior,",Admiral Stansfield Turner, the director
 of the agency, told a Senate hearing last week. "It involves
 t "the kind of thing we're interested

 He said t
 studying it.
 irs is what will motivate a man to become an agent of -
 the United States is a very difficult situation. We have
 to be familiar with the attitudes and responses of people
 we approach to become our spies."
 Intelligence 'officials call these psychological studies
 "personality assessment." potential spies are indeed as-
 sessed, but the sweep- of the program is much greater than
 the admiral suggested. The agency has developed "personality
 assessments" of Fidel Castro and the late Che Guevara,.
 Mao Tse-tung and his successors, the leaders of the Kremlin
 and the chiefs of state of most of the nations regarded
 as allies of the United States. "You do it on friends and
 enemies alike," said one intelligence specialist, "because
 you can never know when someone's going to switch."
 When the President of the United States goes to meetings
 abroad, he is armed with assessments of the officials he
 will confront, as were members of the United States negoti-
 ating team at the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty talks.
 At times the assessment program has overstepped the
 bounds of the agency's charter, which forbids operations
 directed against Americans inside the United States. The
 agency ordered a personality study of Daniel Ellsberg when
 he was awaiting trial for allegedly having given the Penta-
 gon Papers to The New York Times. An assessment was
 done also of Mr. Ellsberg's lawyer, Leonard Boudin. E. How-
 ard Hunt, a former intelligence agent who was jailed for
 his part in the Watergate break-in, burglarized the files
 of Mr. Ellsberg's psychiatrist to get material for the assess-
 long, Dr. Wolfe, at the behest of the agency, had set up
 the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology at the
 Cornell Medical Center in New York. The society became
 ,an important mechanism for funding a number of agency
 studies directed at manipulating human behavior.
 The Department of Sociology at Rutgers University was
 paid to conduct a study of Hungarian refugees. Dr. D. Ewen
 Cameron of McGill University in Montreal got a grant to
 explore "the effects of repeated verbal signals upon human
 behavior." There was an LSD experiment conducted by a
 team of social and medical scientists at the Massachusetts
 Mental Health Center in Boston. The Educational Testing
 Service of Princeton, N.J., which conducts the National Col-
 lege Board and Graduate :Record Examinations, received
 funds to investigate the relationship between two broad
 theories of personality.
 When the society was disbanded.. in 1965, ,Col. James
 L. Monroe, a psychologist who had been a senior intelligence
 official, and several others joined another agency-backed
 organization called "Psychological Assessments Inc." After
 Psychological Assessments closed its doors a few years ago,.
 Colonel Monroe moved to Texas and set up a firm that
 prepared studies for business and industry. The colonel said
 recently that he hoped the agency had benefited from some
 of his research. "If they're going to make judgments about
 foreign powers," he said, "they've got to know about how
 people function."

 I'm writing on behalf of Mr. John Cartalis, our 1977
 Eisenhower Fellow from Greece.  Mr. Cartalis is pre-
 sently in the United States meeting with his profes-
 sional colleagues as well as officials in government,
 academia and the corporate community.  As you will
 note from the enclosed bio-data, he is a political and
 diplomatic correspondent for the Athens daily newspaper,
 To Vima.
 He plans to be in Washington the week of May 2 and would
 appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss
 the background of U. S. foreign policy toward the
 Eastern Mediterranean.  Since he is in the U. S. as an
 Eisenhower Fellow, and not officially representing his
 newspaper during this period, he will consider the
 discussion off the record.
 I thank you for your consideration of this request and
 for any courtesies that may be extended to our guest
 from Greece.

 Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships, Inc. is a non-
 profit corporation established in 1953 to honor
 Dwight D. Eisenhower for his contribution to
 humanity as a soldier, statesman and world leader.
 The Fellowships are independent of any govern-
 mental, political, or academic affiliation.
 Purpose
 EEF is dedicated to furthering world peace through
 international understanding. It is unique in this
 effort because it involves an exchange of informa-
 tion between nations at the leadership level. Unlike
 academic and research fellowships, Eisenhower
 Fellowships provide a period of travel and observa-
 tion for individuals who have already demonstrated
 outstanding achievement in their respective
 countries and professions. The Fellowships give
 these leaders an opportunity to exchange ideas on
 critical world problems face to face. It is our firm
 belief that there is no substitute for the reality of
 personal contact.
 Selection
 Eisenhower Fellows are men and women between
 the ages of 30 and 45. The selection process is
 conducted by bi-national committees in the
 countries invited to nominate Fellows for a given
 year's program. These committees, assembled by
 The United States Embassies, consist of three
 distinguished nationals, usually including a recently
 returned Eisenhower Fellow, and two Americans
 from outside the diplomatic community. After
 determining the professional field of primary
 importance to its country, a selection committee
 nominates qualified candidates. This process
 sometimes requires competitive screening of many
 applicants. Final selection of one candidate from
 each designated country rests with the selection
 committee in the U.S.
 The Program
 The Fellowships provide three to four months of
 professional consultations, visits, seminars and
 field trips throughout the U.S. EEF assumes all
 expenses for travel to and within the U.S. for each
 Fellow, and provides a reasonable allowance for
 living expenses. Fellows are invited to bring their
 spouses, provided that spouses can remain in the
 U.S. for at least two months.
 A program tailored to individual professional
 objectives is create"ffiPi61ep lL44`004/10/13: CIA-R

 ,~FBII
 1'eelOv~7~  bC1s10   '~0,t NOW, government
 officials, educators, technicians, scientists, and
 professional leaders of all kinds. The Fellows visit
 industries, schools, financial institutions, farms,
 marketing centers, laboratories, historic sites and
 other places of professional or general interest.
 Each Fellow is urged to make intensive inquiries
 along lines which will be most useful, personally
 and professionally, to his or her country. The
 emphasis is on a broad experience rather than a
 concentrated study at a single institution.
 Eisenhower Fellows also have opportunities to
 meet private U.S. citizens and to observe American
 home life. In addition, there are opportunities for
 Fellows to meet each other, and gain better mutual
 understandings of their individual cultures, atti-
 tudes and motivations.
 Support
 Since its inception, EEF has been supported by
 annual contributions from corporations, founda-
 tions and individuals. Approximately 200 donors a
 year contribute funds to meet an operating budget
 of $500,000. In addition, former Fellows in many
 countries have contributed funds or have arranged
 for transportation expenses to be met from
 resources within their countries.
 In 1967, the concept of Sponsored Fellowships
 was established. This plan allows corporations,
 foundations or individuals making major contribu-
 tions to direct the use of their contributions. Donors
 may designate that their monies be used to finance
 the program of a Fellow with a particular profes-
 sional discipline, or a Fellow from a specified
 country. The initial selection of the individual
 Fellow, however, is the prerogative of EEF.
 Success
 The success of The Fellowships is indicated by the
 large number of former Fellows who have achieved
 even higher levels of responsibility in their profes-
 sions. The list includes a former president, a
 prime minister, many men now serving as cabinet
 ministers, ambassadors, heads of industry, uni-
 versities, national and international agencies, as
 well as leaders in a variety of other important fields.
 All told, over 500 influential men and women,
 aided by their Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships
 experience, are in positions where they can foster
 communication, understanding and agreement on

 WASHINGTON - President Carter has.1
 approved a top-secret project to determine
 .what action the government should take to
 prevent Soviet spies from gaining access to
 American industrial secrets and sensitive
 trade information, it has been learned.    .
 Accordilic to administration sources, a
 major Option  ecci r consideration  involves-
 the use of sop isticated electronic egnip-
 ment to encrypt, or ."scramble," private
 telephone calls involving investments, new
 technological developments and other deli-
 cate business. information which might be-,
 useful to foreign.-countries.
 Soirees said Carter signed a memoran-
 dum dealing with steps to counter the Soviet
 rnoniloring of American telephone calls
 about a week ago after a review by his Na-
 tional Security Council.   -
 The project is so sensitive and so
 closely held that only a few top officials in
 the Carter administration and Congress
 _ know about it.
 An informed source, said that Carter
 ordered that the project be conducted under
 the over-all direction of the White House
 rather than exclusively' under the Penta-
 gon's super-secret National Security Agency
 (NSA).
 He did so because of concern over
 possible intrusion by the military into the
 -business world. The NSA ncrn:aily handles

 Researchers Say Students Were. Among 200 Who Took LSD!
 in Tests Financed by C.I.Q..
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER
 Special ".o Thr .New York T13te3
 VASHINGTON, Aug. 7-Students at
 V
 iar lard University, the Massachusetts
 Institute of Technology and Emerson Cot-
 lege were among some 200 persons who
 received LSD in experiments secretly fi-
 nanced by the Central Intelligence Agen-
 cy i t the Boston Psychopathic Hospital
 in the early 1950's, researchers who
 'worked on the studies said today.
 The students, both young men and
 women, were said to have seen paid $20
 each to'drink a tall glass of water with
 the mind-altering drug added and then
 for 10 to 12 hours to participate in a
 series of psychological tests. They had
 been.told they were getting..LSD and that
 their reactions would vary: ? ?
 Some doctors, nurses and attendants
 at the hospital, now known as the Massa-
 chusetts  Mental  Health  Center,  also
 serve'. along with the students as volun-
 teer subjects in the experiments, which
 rang d over four years and. were among
 some' of the earliest studies of LSD in
 the United States, the researchers report-
 ed. -
 T'ne research was ?done:,under grants
 from the Society for the Investigation of
 Human Ecology, a funding mechanism
 created by the C.I.A. in a 25-year project
 to develop ways of manipulating human
 behavior.,
 Documents and Interviews
 T'le intelliger-ce,.;ageitc}r's sponsorship
 of 'the work was uncovered by a team
 of New York Times reporters, sifting
 through. more than: 2,000 agency docu-
 ments and interviewing dozens of past
 and -present intelligence-officials and re-
 searchers around the country.
 Among :,the  data.....reviewed  were
 newly . disclosed. C.I.A,-? documents that
 discuss at-length research .on. "knock-out
 type agents."- The documents refer to
 (unconscious _producingj prob-
 lem" and;,the "productiorsaof'voluntary
 sleep."                7       t  ..
 "Them exists within the agency," one
 1960 document saya, "a `continuing re-
 _-uirement -from the operations divisions
 -or a substance or. substances; that will
 ender an.. individual or animal helpless
 and immobile,. either consciously or un-
 consciously,. until definite, control meas
 _lres can be instituted.
 "The instances and situations where
 such an advantage can' be utilized are
 :oo numerous to be mentioned.
 '
 Another document indicates that the
 agency paid $100,000 in the fiscal year
 1957 for a study that included an investi
 gation of the "curare-like effects of cu-1
 taro  thiols,"  or chemical  compounds;
 analogous to the alcohols.            I
 In 1956, other documents indicate, the
 agency directed that 60 percent of one
 $40,000 contract be devoted to studying
 "the feasibility of utilizing aerosols as
 a delivery system for the various psycho-
 chemicals" such as LSD. In the end, the?
 C.I.A. decided that spray cans, of LSD
 !would not make an effective weapon.
 Dr.. Max Rinkte, who initiated the LSD
 research at the Boston Psychopathic Hos-
 pital, died five years ago. But others who
 participated in the work, including Dr.
 J. Sanbourne Bockoven, now.a regional
 services administrator for the Massachu-
 setts Department of Mental- Health, say
 they did not know that the intelligence
 agency was paying for their research and
 receiving theirreports.
 In. a Senate'hearing last =week, Adm.
 Stansfield Turner, Director of Central In-
 telligence, said that freshly uncovered
 financial records showed that 86 hospi-
 tals and academic institutions had done
 research under the agency's mind.control
 project, many of them apparently unwit-,
 tingly. So far, only a handful of them'
 have been publicly identified.
 At the hearing. Senator ,,Edward M- t
 I 'Kennedy, -Democrat of Massachusetts,
 urged Admiral Turner to notify officials
 cf the hospitals and- universities. involved
 that their institutions had done, research
 for the C.I:A.:Admiral Turner said that

 Emory Medical School doctors did
 not realize that research they per,;
 formed in the .late 1950s involving
 LSD experiments of prisoners at the
 Atlanta federal penitentiary was
 funded by the Central Intelligence.
 Agency, college officials said Tues-
 day.
 Dr. Arthur P. Richardson, dean of
 the medical school, said in response
 to revelations this week about CIA
 involvement in the tests, "We had no
 reason whatsoever to believe this
 money came from the CIA."
 The money was channeled 'to
 Emory through the Geschiktcr Foun-
 dation, a Washington, D.C. organiza-
 tion stPi active in research. It
 amounted to about $25,000 per year
 from 1954 to 1960.
 Most of the tests were performed
 by Dr.. Carl Pfeiffer and. br.' Harry.:
 L. Williams, of the medical school's
 pharmacology department.

 comment. A secretary at the center
 said Dr. Pfeiffer..was;.refusing all.',.

 According to. the current c'hairman'.,.;
 of the pharmacology department, the. 1
 tests Involved -administration of low.
 doses of LSD to sbme 60 prisoners at.
 the federal penitentiary. on .a, volun.
 teer basis.. .
 "In those days, it was believed
 that LSD produced symptoms very
 similar to schizophrenia," said Dr.
 Neil Moran, pharmacology chairman.
 "It was- thought that LSD might
 lead to an answer for, the cause of .j
 schizophrenia. That theory is not :
 ;really accepted any more," Dr.
 ':Moran said. "it was decided that
 LSD did not really mimic the symp-
 toms of schizophrenia."
 According to Dr. Richardson, who,,
 .was associate dean before he became'
 ,dean of the school in 1956, the ex-;
 -periments were valid research at the
 time, regardless of who funded them.
 : 'All we knew was that. we were
 -'.dealing with a bona fide foundation.
 ;I can't really tell you what our posi-
 tion -would have been it' we,.had
 known it was the. CIA," Richardson
 said.
 "I doubt if Nye would have opposed
 It. At that time, it was a very, very
 highly respected organization. I'm
 not sure that back then we thought
 they were as evil as they are made
 out to be now."
 if
 . Richardson said that in'the inter;;
 vening years, he had wondered if- the.
 drug-. tests had' any'
 adverse perms
 rent effects-on the prisoners at the.;
 penitentiary.
 "The doses we used here at Emory'
 were rather. small. . They were not
 large enough to produce the extreme
 { side effects."
 :.-An official. of the U.S. Bureau of
 Prisons said that such testing would
 be. impossible. now. The prisons ex-
 pressly forbid such human experi-
 mentation-on prisoners.
 "But back then we were pretty
 careless about such things. Nobody
 really gave a damn," the prison offi-
 cial said.
 All that was necessary for the ex-
 perimentation was the approval of
 the warden.

 Tass...on Target, for Once
 The Soviet. news agency.Tass, a.favorite source - an Security and Co-operation would look thoroughly
 of information for the. CIA,, has come up with a
 thought that could be converted into one of the more
 stimulating proposals of the.year_ We commend it to
 our friends at the CIA fortress in McLean, Va. Let
 us sketch the background.
 As part of the current spate of cold war comment
 in the Soviet press, Tess recently seized upon Amer-
 ican newspaper disclosures of CIA spying operations
 in the United States against United States citizens.
 "Not so long ago; when the European Security and
 Co-operation Conference started discussing 'human-
 itarian problems,' the Western press tried.to create
 the. Impression that it is the capitalist world that is a
 bulwark of civil liberties," Tass stated, adding: "And
 now It is obvious that fundamental rights of citizens
 are. flouted in the leading country of the 'free
 world: "
 .At the risk of. having our mail opened, our tele-
 phones tapped, our offices broken into and our staff
 infiltrated, we would like to say that Tass is right on
 target.-The fundamental rights of American citizens
 have indeed been flouted by an agency that'has now
 admitted doing such things, plus quite a few more.
 William E. Colby, the CIA director, may try to ex-
 plain away such violations of the law governing his
 agency by suggesting that some overstepping of the
 line is Inevitable when one is in the dirty tricks busi-
 ness. However, we prefer the Tass implication that
 a nation that professes civil liberties should practice
 civil liberties.
 And now to our proposal. We think it would be a
 splendid idea if the 34-nation Conference on Europe-
 into the way each of its participants adheres to hu-
 man rights principles. This might delay the grand xX_.
 summit finale that the Kremlin has been promoting
 for some time. But because the security conference
 from its inception has been nothing more than a So-
 viet ploy to legitimatize its hold on Eastern Europe,
 why the rush? Why not force the United States to ex-
 plain in an international forum how its foreign Intel-
 ligence agency came to feel it had a right to plant
 agents among "dissidents" espousing black rights or
 opposing the Vietnam war? And why not force the
 Soviet Union to explain a system that works in the
 depths where government critics are thrown into
 mental hospitals, exiled from their homes, deprived
 of their livelihoods and condemned to prison.
 Our modest proposal might accomplish three
 objectives, all of which are in the interest of the
 Central Intelligence Agency. First, it would delay
 .completion of the European Security Conference,
 which would be no loss to American diplomacy. Sec-
 ond, it would demonstrate anew that Communists
 remain far more expert than Western capitalists in
 the art of violating civil liberties. Third, and more'
 important, it would remind perceptive officials of.
 the CIA that the unusual, illegal tactics their agency
 adopted for reasons of expediency are nothing but
 milder variations of the usual, government-ap-
 proved tactics of the totalitarian state. Once this is
 clearly understood by CIA agents and all their fel-
 low citizens, Americans might become more vigi-
 lant and successful in defense of their precious lib.
 erties.                      -

 Please forgive my delay in formally letting you

 Although my flashfires are not as global and significant
 as yours, they required my attention nonetheless.
 I am one man who sincerely thanks you on behalf on

 been so castigated by press coverage.
 The enclosed article appeared in one of our local

 dissatisfaction was expressed by me to both newspapers
 for the manner in which your speech was reported.   Here-

 THE HOUSTON POST
 7 January 1976
 The 'deputy director of the Central
 Intelligence Agency said here Tuesday
 that he does not know of any "Cuban
 mercenaries being trained in this country
 for fighting in Angola.
 "There is no CIA involvement in Angola
 with troops or agents," said Lt. Gen. Ver-
 non A. Walters, number two in command
 at the CIA, "and I am not aware of Cuban
 mercenaries being trained here by the
 CIA:'
 Last week White House press secretary
 Ron Nessen would not comment on
 rumors that Cuban nationals living in the
 United States were being hired for Angola
 where Cuba has sent. some 7,000 combat
 troops to fight for the Moscow-supported
 site.
 Walters, speaking at the Executive
 Breakfast Club meeting, said he expects
 the agency will receive a "set of restric-
 tions" and "some reorganization" as a re-
 sult of congressional investigations into
 CIA activities.
 "We are prepared to live with the re-
 sults of the congressional reports if we get
 a fair reporting,  Walters said. "Yes,
 we've had. our share of poor judgment,
 over zealousness, kooks and nuts, but they
 have been few and far between in 27
 years.
 Walters, CIA deputy director three
 years, formerly was with the intelligence
 division for the Defense Department.
 He said that "much of what has been
 brought up and used against, us" through
 congressional inquiries were contigency
 plans rather than policies adopted for use.
 Assassinations, mind -bending drugs and
 use of toxics were discussed within the
 agency, he said, "but in the final conclu-
 sion they were passed over. We were deal-
 ing with possibly the means to retaliate it
 they were used against us."
 The deputy director said that in addi-
 tion to congressional probes, the CIA has
 had to contend with an American attitude
 that intelligence work is "unmoral and
 ungentlemanly."
