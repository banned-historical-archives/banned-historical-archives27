WASHINGTON POST 
2 4 JUA: /27, 
? 
Continued 
ill Inquiry 
uatre_5t,ested 
By George Lardner Jr.. 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
- The Senate intelligence 
committee said yesterday 
:that senior officials of 
both the CIA and 'the FBI 
covered up crucial infor-
mation in the course of 
investigating ? President 
Kennedy's assassination. 
Issuing the final findings 
of 'its protracted investiga-
tions; the ,committee said it 
had been unable to satisfy 
itself as to why the Warren 
Commission was kept in the 
dark, but said that "the pos-
sibility exists that senior of-
ficials in both agencies made 
conscious decisions not to 
disclose potentially impor-
tant information." 
, Filled with tantalizing but 
admittedly inconclusive de-
tails, many of them laid out 
for the first time, the 106-
.page report emphasized that 
it had not uncovered evi-
dence "sufficient to justify a 
conclusion that there was a 
-conspiracy .to assassinate 
President Kennedy." - 
But the committee said 
the -investigative deficien-
cies" it turned up were sub-
stantial enough to raise 
grave doubts about the 'War-
ren Colemi,eione. 1.1; 
to justify continued congres-
sional investigation. 
Sea. Eicher(' S. Schweiker 
(11-Pa., who Played a key 
rule in the Senate assassina-
tion inquiry, said it had 
turned up "important new 
leach;" that were being kept 
secret ill hopes that the per-
re.,:nerit new Senate .1atelli-
1,;ence Committee would NW-
sue theta effectively. 
Othci? potentlall;i? impor-
tant leads that Went unpin-
Sued at the time of the as-
sassination, according to the 
report, included several 
mysterious flights from,, 
Mexico City to Havana. , 
One of ethem reportedly, 
involved a Cubana Airlines 
flight the night Kennedy, 
was killed which was de-
layed in Mexico City for. 
five, hours for an unidentie 
fied passenger.. who finally 
got aboard "without passing, 
through customs" and then'' 
"traveled to Cuba in the: 
cockpit ... thus again avoid-
. ing identification by the pas-
sengers.",e. 
Althou g.h the CIA re-
ceived information to this 
effect on Dec.- 1, 1963, the 
Senate committee said it 
was unable to find any in-
dication that the ? CIA had. 
conducted a felloW-up in-
vestigation to determine the 
identify of the passenger. 
The study dwelt heavily 
on the CIA's clandestine-
plotting against Cuban Pre-
mie. Fidel Castro at the, 
time of the assassination; 
and the determination of: 
U.S. government officials,., 
especially at the .FBI, to deel 
pict Lee Harvey Oswald as 
Kennedy's lone killer. 
Just four days' after the 
President's murder in Dallas' 
on Nov. 22, 1963, the Senate: 
report disclosed, ,Deputy At-
torney General Nicholas 
deB. Katzenbach sent a 
Memo to the White House' 
declaring: ? 
"The public must be antis-, 
lied that Oswald* was the 
assassin: that he did .not 
have confederates who are 
slit! at large; and that the 
evidence was snch that he 
would have been convicted 
at trial." 
Speculation about Os- . 
wald's motives, the Katzen-
bach memo added, "ought to 
be cut off, and we should 
have some basis for rebut-
ting thought that this. was a 
Comniunist conspiracy or " 
(as the Iron Curtain Dress is 
sayinf-0 a right-wing cotispir-:, 
aey to blame it on Com-
mueist 5," 
? By that time, the Senate 
;report showed, the CIA was 
already making - efforts to 
? head off talk .of a conspir-
acy. It attempted, unsuccess-
fully, on Nov. 23, 1963, to 
head off the imminent ar-
rest by Mexican -police of 
Sylvia Duran, an employee 
of the. Cuban copsulate in 
Mexico City with whom Os-
wald had talked on a visit, 
there two months earlier. 
-.Informed by the CIA!s 
? Mexico station, that the ar-
rest Could not be prevented,. 
.a top-ranking, official in the 
CIA's Directorate for Plans, 
Thomas Karamessines, Ca-
,bled back that the arrest 
'could jeopardize U.S. free-
dom of action on the whole 
? question of Cuban responsi-
bility." 
- Questioned by the corn-, 
mittee two, months ago, Kar-
,.amessines, the. report said, 
"could not recall preparing 
the cable or his reasons- for 
issuing such a message. He 
speculated that the CIA 
feared the Cubans were re-
sponsible, and that Duran 
?? might reveal this during an 
interrogation. He further 
speculated that if Duran did' 
possess such information, 
the CIA and the U.S. gove-
ernment would need time to 
, react .before it came to the 
attention of the public," 
Repeettedly raising the 
? possibility that the Kennedy 
assassination might have 
. been a retaliation by Castro 
or his supporters, the com-
mittee said that the CIA had 
been meeting since early 
September with a secret Cu-
ban agent code-named AM-
LASH who was proposing 
an "inside job" against the 
Castro regime, including 
Castro's assassination. 
Although the Senate re-
port does not use his real 
name, AM HASH was a sen-
ior Cuban official and. Cas-
tro intimate named Polar:do 
Cubcia whom the CIA re-
; 'Milted in 1961 as an impor? 
tont "asset" inside Cuba, bet 
Whom siii-rne belie 1. o was a 
..double agent, His talk about

getting rid of Castro was 
communicated to CIA head-
quarters at Langley, Va., on 
Sept. 7, 1;iO3. 
Late on the evening of 
that same clay, Sept. 7. the 
Senate report said, Castro 
held an impromptu. three-
hum interview w Associ? 
' :tied Press reporter Daniel 
Ilarker at an embassy party 
in Havana. In the interview. 
the Cuban premier warned 
against any U.S. efforts to 
assassinate Cuban leaders 
and said: 
"We are prepared to fight 
them and answer in kind. 
United States leaders should 
? think that if they are aiding 
terrorist plans to eliminate 
Cuban leaders, they them-
selves will not be safe." 
The warning apparently 
failed to raise any serious 
apprehensions in Washing-. 
ton. 
On Sept. 12; 1963, several 
days after publication of the 
AP dispatch in U.S. newspa-
pers, an interagency Cuban 
Coordinating Committee 
met at the' State . Depart-
ment and agreed unani-
mously "there was a strong 
likelihood that Castro would 
retaliate in some way 
against the rash 61 covert 
activity in Cuba." 
The so-called 
"brainstorming" session eon-
eluded, however, that while 
kidnapings and attempted 
asassinations of U.S. citizens 
in Latin America might be 
? staged, "attacks against U.S. 
officials" in the United 
States were "unlikely." 
Some CIA officials, such 
, as the chief of counterintel-
ligence on the Special .Af-
fairs Staff for Cuban opera-
tions, thought AINILASH's 
."bona fides were subject to 
question," but the meetings 
with the Cuban operative 
continued. 
On Oct. Oct. 29, 1963. the late 
Desmond Fitzgerald, who 
was then in charge of the 
CIA's Special Affairs Staff, 
met with Cubela after being 
introduced to him as .a 
"personal 'representative" oc 
Attorney General Robert F. 
Kennedy. 
AMLASH, the Senate re-
:port recounted, asked for an 
, assassination weapon such 
?as a high-powered rifle with 
telescopic sights. The matter 
was apparently left unre-
solved but by Nov. 19, three 
days before Kennedy's 
sassination, Fitzaerald told 
AMLASH's ease off to 
inform the Cuban "that the 
rifle, telescopic sights and 
explosives would be pro-
vided." 
Hli.Y.-?11, ady; 
Paris at the time, had hetet 
planning to return to Cuba, 
but on Nov. 20, HY;:l, the re-
port noted, a .Cl. officer 
telephoned him and ze.,ked 
him to wait for a 
on Noy. 22. 
"AMLASII as'eed if use 
nicetinir h-, 
inf.!, and i iso CIA officer re-

Sponded that he did not 
know 'whether it would be 
interesting but it was the 
meeting AMLASH had re-
quested," the report said. 
". . . Thus the Nov. 20 tele-
phone call was the first in-
dication that he might re-
ceive the specific support he 
requested" 
The report indicated that 
AMLASH met only with his 
CIA case officer on Nov. 22 
and not Fitzgerald; as an 
earlier Senate report sug-
gested. At the meeting, the 
case officer cited President 
Kennedy's Nov. 18, 1963, 
speech in Miami "as an in-
dication that the President 
supported a coup." 
Kennedy had called the 
Castro government "a small 
band of conspirators" who 
consituted a "barrier" which, 
"once removed," would en-
sure U.S. support for pro-
gressive goals in Cuba. 
"The case officer t old 
AMLASH that Fitzgerald 
had helped write the speech," 
the Senate report said. The 
-CIA official also said a rifle 
? and explosives would be,; 
..forthcoming and offered the 
Cuban a poison pen to use 
against Castro. "As 
.AMLASH and the case of-
ficer broke ? up their meet-
ing, they were told the 
President had .1:icon assasi-
nated." 
When -Castro heard the 
news in Havana, the report 
said quoting French journa-
list Jean ? Daniel who -was 
meeting with Castro at the 
time, ' the Cuban Premier 
asked. about President John-
son: "What authority does, 
he exercise over the CIA?" 
Despite the CIA schem-
ing, the report said,: neither 
the Warren Commission nor 
the CIA nor FBI officials 
assigned to work on the 
Kennedy investigation were 
told of the efforts against, 
Castro. 
As a consequence. Se.hwei-
kmosaid, no one "ever actu-
ally conducted any full-scale 
investigation to find out 
whether a foreign govern-
ment was involved. 
At the FBI, the report 
-disclosed that six days after 
the 'assassination, then di-
rector J. Edgar Hoover was 
given a report "which de-
tailed serious investigative 
deficiencies" in the bureau's 
handling of 0.swahrs case 
after his return from Roe. 
sia in 1962 as an erstwhile 
Sok let d elector. 
The deficiencies resulted 
in secret disciplinary actions 
against 17 FBI personnel, 
The actions were never cum-
ed to the Warren 
Commiasicm and siiine were 
carried out only after the

the Kennedy murder? 
? The third area for further in-. 
'vestigation, Mr. Sehweiker con-
tends, concerns leads purport-
ing to involve several "mysteri-
'ous strangers" of Cuban origin, 
whom the intelligence agencies 
picked up in the aftermath of 
the murder and then dropped. 
One lead involved reports as-. 
? sem?bled by the C.I.A. about 'a 
Trails unexplored at the time 
grew cold and now are covered 
with the underbrush of passing 
years. 
J. Edgar Hoover, the director 
of the F.B.I. 'at the time of the 
assaination, is dead. So is Allen 
W. Dulles, Director of Central 
Intelligence until the spring of 
1961, a man knewledgeable 
;about the Kennedy Administra-
tion plots against Cuba's Prime 
-Minister, Fidel Castro. 
However, according to Sen-
ator Richard S. Schweiker, the 
Pennsylvania Republican who 
remains among the most en-. 
thusiastic of the assassination 
students and potential conspir-
acy theorists, the previous Fed-
eral investigations of the 
murder 'amounted to "a cover-
up.". 
While Mr. Schweiker has re- Cuban-American -who crossed 
treated from his assertion of from 'Texas into Mexico on 
last October that the Warren .Nov. 23, 1963, and then board-
Commission report would col- .ed a Chban airliner bound for 
lapse "like a house of cards," Havana several days .later as. 
the only passenger. 
Another involved, an uniden= 
tified, person who arrived -in 
he still maintains that there 
are "promising leads." He 
takes this view despite the eon.: 
elusion of yesterday's report, 
which . h helped write, that 
no new evidence sufficed "to 
justify a conclusion that there 
was a conspiracy." 
The focus of a new investiga-
tion, however, would be rather 
limited in scope and different 
in emphasis from the. earlier 
studies. aceording to stall' 
members of the Senate select 
? committee. 
Mr. Schweiker and. with less 
enthusiasm, some of his Senate 
'colleagues, want to tie. up what 
,they klieve to be loose ends 
,remaining in three fields. 
First, as the committee. Puti 
its chairman, Chief justiCe' 
Earl Warroa was ''seeking 
to criticize" tire FBI. 
On t WO separate occasiense 
the r eport added, "Directors 
Hoover asked for ad the dereg. 
? ritary materiel mi Warr* 
cammiesion members anel,

'Mexico city the night of the 
Kennedy murder and boarded 
a Cuban airliner that had been 
delayed five hours to take the 
man to Havana. The pas:zerger 
was not subjected to customs 
controls. 
A Senate official who is 
iclose to the committee investi-
gation said today, 'They feel: 
;there is a conspiracy. But they 
are not ready to point a finger 
yet at pro-Castro or anti-Castro. - 
forces. They also feel there are 
.indications Am/Lash was a 
idouble agent." 
Along with the recommenda-
tion that the new Senate intel-
ligence oversight committee, 
follow up these aspects of the 
assassination, the select com-
mittee has handed over 5,000 
,pages of documents relating to 
its own investigation. 
Senator Schweiker is sched-
uled to appear Sunday on the 
1"Face The Nation" television 
!program to plead his cause for 
'pursuit of the leads. 
'But aides of Senator Daniel 
K. Inouye, who is chairman-of

An Eye for an Eye? 
The Death of JFK 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central 
Intelligence Agency engaged in a cover-up of highly 
relevant information when the Warren Commission 
,vvat investigating President John Kennedy's assassin-
tion in 1963 and 1964. President Lyndon Johnson and 
Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy became party to 
;the effort which consisted of withholding key facts: 
from the Warren Commission. The cover-up?contin-
ues even now 12 years later; the FBI still refuses to turn 
over to congressional investigators some of its most 
sensitive files on the killing of JFK: 
The Warren Commission was never told that Attor-
ney General Kennedy secretly formed?before his 
:brother was killed?a special intergovernmental com-
mittee, which included FBI and CIA representatives, to 
look into the possibility that Cuba's Premier Fidel 
Castro might organize attempts on the lives of high 
United States government officials. That this commit-
tee existed has .been kept secret although information 
;about it reposes in. FBI files_ 
? .The top-secret comonittee was created by Robert 
; Kennedy presumably out of concern that Castro might 
, retaliate against CIA attempts,on his life, carried out 
directly by the agency's operatives and vith help from 
the Mafia. That anti-Castro as,:a:;sination plots were 
? afoot in the early 1960% was unknown at the tine (they 
were disclosed last year by the Senate Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence Activities) and the Warren Com-
mission was not .told of them. Only Allen W. Dulles, 
who had been CIA director, had knowledge of the a nti-
Castro plots, in its ignorance the commission couldn't 
search more intensively into the possible motives of Lee 
Harvey Oswald in killing the l'resident. The commis-
. sion had concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin in 
Dallas, but it acknowledged its inability to come up with 
the motive. 
It does not follow, of course', that the Warren Com-
mission would surely have t raced Os wa ki's motives had 
it known of. the anti-Castro conspiracies and of the 
establishment or Robert Kennedy's secret group some 
time before Dallas. There is still no proof that Castro 
was behind Oswald. But the cover-up made it 
impossible for the commission to seriously pursuc'a line 
of inquiry in this area even thongh there had been 
much discussion of the significance k.,1 Oswald's links 
with the Fair Play for Cuba Commit tee (a pro-Castro 
group in the United States) and his aborted efforts tOgo 
to Cuba two months before he killed JF:K. 
Robert Kennedy, the CIA and the1 w decided to keep 
from the Warren Commission the fact that a special 
group had been set up to protect American leaders from 
possible Cuban assassination plots. To justify its 
existence, it would have been necessary to expose the 
CIA's own conspiracies against Castro. These were 
among.the most closely held secrets of the Kennedy-
Johnson period. That the CIA failed to inform the 
Warren Commission of anti-Castro plots?even 
though the agency was under presidential orders tc. 
provide maximum assistance to the commission?was 
confirmed in a memo on April 20, 1975 written by CIA 
inspector general Donald Y. Chamberlain. to CIA 
deputy director E.H. Knoche. It said: "As far as we can 
tell from all of the materials at our disposition, no one 
( 
discussed with the Warren Commission any alleged 
plan to assassinate Castro. There is also no evidence 
' that anyone known to our records made a decision ! to 
tell the Warren Commission anything about this toe:.c 
or any other matter."Chamberlain added that "we have 
no evidence in our material indicating Castro's 
,.knowledge or the possession of documentation of 
; alleged assassination plots directed against him.-
: Two days later, on April 22, 1975, Raymond G. 
Rocca, then deputy chief of the CIA's 
.,?,,,soi,interintelligence staff, informed Knoche that "our 
records show at every point a marked intent to makeas 
much available to the [Warren Commission] as was 
consistent with the . security of the ongoing 
operations." Rocca also reported that his files do not 
:'show whether the Warren Commission was informed 
.iof a 1962 report from the CIA's station in Guatemala 
according to which a statement was made at a 
;Guatemalan Communist party meeting that "we need 
knot preoccupy ourselves over the politics of President 
Kennedy because we know, according to prognostica-
tion, that he will die within the present year." 
Although, as Rocca put it, the counterintelligence 
staff was the CIA's "working-level point of contact 
with the Warren. Commission," -plans- 'to assassinate 
Castro were not "known to-us in CIA staff."' 
In all likelihood, President Johnson, who knew of the 
anti-Castro plotting, also knew that Robert Kennedy 
had set up his special committee. But there is no 
' indication that he shared that knowledge with Chief 
Justice Earl Warren when the commission was orga-
nized in November 1963. Robert Kennedy's testimony 
before the Warren Commission likewise omitted 
mention of his own fears that assassinations might 
breed assassinations. But it is part of the public record 
that Johnson subsequently commented, without 
elaborating, that President Kennedy might have been 
killed in retaliation for his administration's anti-Castro 
lpolicies. At the time, this remark was taken to mean 
;possible retaliation for the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion 
land subsequent CIA operations against Cuba. 
I. All these facts, secret at the time, may have influ-
enced the Kennedy family in its decision to oppose any 
:reopening of the assassination probe. Again, a new 
.investigation might have led to public disclosures of the 
CIA plotting and tarnishing the memory of John and 
Robert Kennedy. 
Robert Kennedy's interest in aggressive operations 
against Cuba was reported in a document written -by 
John McCone, then CIA director, on October 4, 1962, 
describing a top-level strategy meeting chaired by the 
attorney general, McCone wrote that "the attorney 
general reported on discussions with the President on 
Cuba; dissatisfied with lack of action in the sabotage 
field, went on to stress that nothing was moving 
? forward, commented that one effort attempted' had 
Failed IP 
? Another element of the cover-up was that in at least #, 
50 instances the CIA had, according to an.internal FBI 
memo, ignored materials supplied by the bureau. on 
Oswald's foreign connections. The responsibility for 
following op such FBI leads was in the hands of an ad 
hoc group built around the CIA's so-called "D Staff," a 
clandestine operations center then headed by William

Harvey, a senior agency official. The CIA's counterin-
telligence office, directed by James Angleton, reported 
directly to Harvey's "D sta ff," a nd it too was involved in 
investigating certain aspects of the Kennedy assassina-
tion. Sources contend that the CIA actually destroyed 
some of the materials provided by the FBI. Angleton, 
according to those sources, may have suspected Soviet 
"plants" in the FBI material. The Warren Commission 
never knew about any of it. 
As has been reported earlier, the FBI destroyed at 
least one letter Oswald sent to the Dallas police 
department shortly before the assassination. Oswald 
; demanded that the FBI stop "harassing" his Russian-
born wife Marina and threatened to blow up the Dallas 
. police headquarters if the FBI failed to desist. This 
became known only last year, and the FBI never offered 
a conclusive explanation for destroying the note. 
Likewise, the FBI inexplicably failed to place Oswald on 
its "dangerous list" although it did so with other 
members of the Fair Play Committee. 
-
A CIA memorandum to the Rockefeller Commission, 
which last year investigated CIA abuses, said that the 
agency still feels, as it did in 1964, that the Warren 
Commission should have given more credence in its ; 
final report to the possibility of foreign links in the 
conspiracy against Kennedy. The memo said that there 
were promising leads that were not followed up. This 
statement contradicts the FBI memorandum now in the 
possession of the Senate Select Committee that the 
CIA refused to pursue leads obtained by the bureau. 
However, acute rivalry between the CIA and the FBI 
, already existed at the time?they actually, stopped 
cooperating altogether in 1970?and their estrange-
ment could account for the contradictions. 
The cover-up is among the reasons the Senate Select 
Committee voted on May 13 to recommend a congres-
sional inquiry into the role of the intelligence agencies 
in the Warren Commission investigation, and into 
Oswald's motives. 
The Senate committee first learned of the cover-up a 
few months ago. This is the new evidence the panel 
claims it has obtained about Oswald's motives. Sen. 
Richard Schvveiker of Pennsylvania and Sen. Gary Hart 
of Colorado, who constitute a 'special subcominit tee on 
the Kennedy assassination, have written a separate 
report on the subject. Neither Schweiker nor Hart has 
publicly revealed thus far the nature of the new 
? evidence?the cover-up. There is said to be great 
pressure to sanitize this report while the full secret. 
information would be turned over to the Senate's new 
permanent oversight committee on intelligence or 
whatever other panel might undertake the 
recommended investigation of the Kennedy death.The 
subcommittee report is expected to be issued in mid-
June after the FBI and the CIA have inspected it to 
remove what they may consider "embarrassing" infor-
mation. 
Although senators are far from certain that the 
proposed inquiry would actually provide a conclusive 
. answer about Oswald's motives?the trail has become 
cold in the opinion of many senators?the FBI and the 
CIA could find themselves under charges of obstruc-
tion of justice for having withheld significant material 
from the Warren Commission. 
Among the questions likely to be raised in a new 
1 investigation is why Dulles concealed from the Warren 
Commission, on which he served, the plotting against 
Castro by the CIA. CIA's own records, released in mid-
May, show that the agency had begun to plan Castro's 
; assassination in March 1960, when Dulles was CIA 
'director, and planning had by then begun for the Bay of 
;Pigs. Excerpts from transcripts of the Warren Com-
mission's executive sessions (published in The New 
Republic on Sept. 27, 1975) show that Dulles informed 
his colleagues that there were certain CIA secrets that 
he would keep from everybody except the President of 
the United States. Dulles was addressing the still 
unclarified question of whether Oswald, as maintained 
'by some assassination buffs, had been an undercover 
;FBI informer. 
A similar question could be raised with John McCone 
who was CIA director during the Warren Commission 
!investigations and who should be called to testify in any 
;new Senate inquiry. McCone was familiar with the 
anti-Castro plots and probably knew about Robert 
'Kennedy's secret committee. 
All the indications are that the existence of this 
committee was known to very few people: Robert 
Kennedy himself, probably Dulles and McCone, FBI 
Director J. Edgar Hoover, and a few selected associates. 
Several aides of Robert Kennedy, including a former 
assistant director of the FBI, said in interviews last 
week that they had not known of the committee. They 
said, however, that it was possible that the group, 
acting in secrecy, worked out of the White House 
before and after the Kennedy assassination Or from the 
attorney general's office. . 
The Senate Intelligence Committee learned of the 
cover-up in the course of its long investigation of the 
intelligence community. After references were made 
by witnesses to the Robert Kennedy committee in 
! testimony touching on foreign assassination plots by 
the CIA, the Church Committee asked the FBI and the 
; CIA for their relevant files. It is understood that the 
CIA made some material available; the FBI refused to do 
so for many months. Only recently did the bureau 
agree to allow Senate committee members to read parts 
; of its secret files, but the senators have to do it at FBI 
; headquarters. 
I It was in this manner that senators learned of the 
;scope of the cover-up by the intelligence agencies. 
!They've now requested additional materials from the 
FBI. Some senators are said to believe that further vital 
information on the Kennedy assassination investiga-
tion may turn up in the FBI files. 
It remains unclear why, after 12. years, the FBI is still 
reluctant to let senators see all its files on the assas-
sinations., There are no indications that the bureau has 
been under any pressure from the I'Vhite I louse?
Presiden t Ford was a member of the Warren 
Commission?to withhold material from the Senate. In 
fact, Ford himself may be unaware of the contents of 
the FBI files. 'Nat raises again a fundamental question: 
is the White I louse in full control of the intelligence 
agencies?

In the fall of 1963, two P. irre assassi- By M. STANTON EVANS 
nation plots careened toward 
a day of convergence. 
One of these, in a general way, we have 
known about for years. The victim was 
John F. Kennedy, the ?assassin?accord-
ing to official reports--Lee Harvey Os-
wald. The other we haven't known about 
-until quite recently. Its intended target 
was Fidel Castro, the assassin-to,be 
high-up .figure in the Cuban government,? 
in continuous contact with the CIA. 
The strands of eireums.ance that bind 
these- plots together, along with other 
anomalies, have spurred an outcry for a 
new investgiation of the Kennedy mur-
der. Sen. Richard Schweiker (R.-Pa.) 
and Representatives Henry Gonzalez-
(D.-Tex.) and Thomas Downing (D.-
Va.), in particular, have urged that the 
investigation be re-opened. On the Ken-
nedy-Castro evidence alone, that request 
should be granted by the Congress: 
, In the light of recent revelations 
about. clandestine activities under 
? Kennedy, we have a startling new 
perspective not available to the gen-
eral public when .the Warren Com-
mission made its report. We know 
that through the summer and fall of 
- 1963, the so-called Standing Group 
of the National Security Council, in-
cluding Robert Kennedy, Robert Nle-
Namara, John McCone. McGeorge 
Bundy and Theodore >iiretiseri, re-
viewed and finally iinpkrninitod a 
program el sabotage against the Cas-
tro government. 
This program was personally approved 
by President Kennedy on June 19, 1963. 
"to nourish a spirit of resistance and dis-
affection- against Castro everi as diplo-
matic talks aimed at accommodation 
were also going forward. On Oct. 24, 
1963. 13 major sabotage operations in-
side Cuba were approved. These were to 
be carried out by, or thrOugh, the CIA. ? 
Meanwhile, at-a lower level of govern-
ment, even more serious action was afoot. 
As documented by the Senate Select 
committee on Intelligence, desultory but 
more or less continuous gestures toward 
assassinating Castro had been considered 
by the CIA since the early 1960s, These 
inclodcd such exotic devices as poison 
cigars and exploding seashells, plus con-
versations with -the Mafia on possible 
methods of eliminating the Cuban dic-
tator. 
In addition, CIA operatives met ofl. 
and on for a period of months with a high 
official of the Castro government, known 
by the code name of AM/LASH. The 
subject of assassinating.Castro kept pop-
ping up in these discussions, and while 
the CIA spokesmen reportedly told AM/ 
LASI i they would not support an assas-. 
sination, they did say they would support 
a coup, and promised to provide a cache. 
of weapons. . 
Finally, in the fall of '63, the CIA 
promised to deliver a ballpoint pen rigged 
with a poison hypodermic needle, which 
CIA Director Richard Helms described 
as a device "for getting rid of Castro, for 
killing him, murdering him, whatever 
the case may be." The context was that 
the device was delivered to keep AM/ 
. LASH happy, rather than for actual use, 
a somewhat fine distinction. It was hand-
ed over on Nov. 22, 1963---the day that ? 
Kennedy himself was murdered. 
What makes all this the more incredi-
ble is the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald ? 
was a fanatic follower of Fidel Castro. 
A Marxist and former defector to the. 
USSR, Oswald .had joined- the Castro-
financed Fair Play for Cuba Committee, 
displayed a picture of Castro on his man-
- . 
telptece, and was a subscriber to The 
Militant, the Trotsky Communist pub-
.fication that specialized in running texts 
of Castro's speeches. The witnesses who 
knew him in New Orleans and Dallas 
testified to his absolute devotion to the 
Castro 
Oswald was in contact with the Com-
munist party in New York and the Trot-
skyist Socialist Workers .party, offering 
to do free photographic work for them. 
and he subscribed to the publications of - 
both. What is striking about these other-

At Ludicrous Stage' 
? - 
Editor: The harassment of .the 
CIA by politicians and a few 
irresponsible journalists has now 
reached the ludicrous stage. In the 
wake of the inept handling of the 
Senate and House- ilyiestigations 
and the competiton to leak secret 
documents, we now hear. from 
Robert Horan, the prosecuting 
attorney of Fairfax County, Va. 
Mr. Horan, having discovered that 
CIA headquarters is located in 
Fairfax County, has (according to 
the: New York Tunes) announced 
stead to associate with a Russian expa-
triate couple of decidedly left-wing sym-
path ies.

scuffled in the streets against anti-Castro 
Cuban esl!..and had taken Castro's part 
in a New Orlenns radio debate. 
In other ,,,nrds, Oswald hail a long, 
consistent i.istory of Nlarxist associ-
ation and sentiment, plus a demon-
strated yea fur i iolence, including 
assassioation?hoth geared to the

report, roost of whom are eager to 
downplay any connection between the 
Kennedy murder and left-wing ex-
tremism. 
Finally; when he was arrested in Dallas 
for the murder of Officer J. D. Tippit, Os-
wald demanded to be represented by 
John Abt?attorney for the Communist-

Add the fact that Oswald traveled to 
Mexico two months before the Kennedy 
assassination to arrange for passage to 
Cuba (a request acceded to by Cuban 
but denied by I he Soviet 
Union, which was supposed to have been 
the ultimate object of his journey). All of 
this against a backdrop of steadily 'es-

BY DICK RUSSELL 
The Warren Report, with its 
simplistic conclusions about Lee 
? Harvey Oswald's "inability to 
enter into meaningful relation-
ships," is about to become obso-
lete. Before thins month is up, the: 
; Senate Select Committee on In-

The motive, one way or-the other, 
goes back. to Cuba?either witht 
? Fidel Castro, or against him. 
In the -past few weeks, new 
information has come out. First a

claims the asstissination was en-

' as if Castro had better start pre-

of these, the confusion is only be-
ginning.

him as Rolando Cubela and makes 
a strong case for his having been a

his brother was killed to look into 
the possibility that Castro might

- high. U.S. government officials.' 
One of the Crile stories closes with. 
a quote from Robert Morgan of 
North Carolina. a senator on the 
. Select -Committee: "There is no 
doubt in my mind that John P. 
Kennedy was assassinated by. 
. Fidel Castro or someone under his 
;influence in retaliation for our 
'efforts to assassinate him." 
" But the one man in a good 
position to know Castro's attitude 
toward the Kennedys believes the 
Castro motive simply doesn't 
make sense. - -He is - William

to Guinea and Kenya. current pub-

; America's UN delegation, he un-
dertook secret negot iations,to nor-

Asked last week what he thought 
of the Castro's-revenge idea: 
Auwood scoffed: "Well, I think 
that's ridiculous. It was quite obvi-. 
? ous to me that Castro, at that time, 
; wanted to normalize relations with 
; us_ He had no interest whatsoever 
in breaking this off, he wasn't 
playing any antoe I was on the

In fact, I was supposed to see the 
president richt after Dallas to dis-

asking. Then. if Castro was agree-
able. I was to go down very quietly. 
NOT many people were aware of 
this undertaking."

proposals. And things were moving

? The Kennedy assassination 
brought a halt to all that. For pne

give his okay for negotiations to

journalist who was with Fidel on " 
the day of Kennedy's death, he was 
"shocked and dismayed at the 
news of the assassination"

only did the CIA concludethat the ?

Mountains, Morrow continues, it 
also obtained photos smugglecaout 
by the anti-Castro underground of 
missile launching sites under con-
struction. 13ut the Kennedys chose 
to do nothing at that time. 
eOn a mission to Europe, 
Morrow says the CIA arranged for 
him to make a clandestine $2?10,000 
arms purchase for Mario Kohly's 
Cuban underground. The deal was

later accuaed and ultimately ac-

says he was taken to the weapons 
-warehouse in Athens' by Davi 
Ferric. 
oDuring that same trip. Morrow' 
says the CIA had him pick up an, 
envelope in Paris from an Ameri-
can just returned from an extend-
ed tour of the Soviet Union. The 
envelope, he was told, :as "the 
irJormation wanted from Har-
vey," and had been secreted out of 
Minsk. A year later. Morrow as-
serts he was told by Cabell and 
"Kendricks" that "Harvey" was a 
CIA agent who had gone to Russia 
posing as a defector to participate 
in an Internal security operation: 
make contact with the niece of a 
,KGB colonel and arrange to get 
her out of Russia as a precondition 
for her uncle's defection to the 
West. 
oAfter the Cuban Missile Crisis, 
Morrow claims he was informed 
by "Kenddcks" -of CIA reports 
that the missiles had not been 
removed but taken to hidden sites 
deep in the Cuban interior. Ele-
ments of. the CIA believed that 
Kennedy and Ithrushchev had 
reached a quid-pro-quo agreement 
about missiles in Cuba and Turkey. 
This, Morrow speculates, was 
Kennedy's betrayal?and his 
death warrant. 
oBy mid-October 1962, the CIA 
was worried aboi a losing control of 
one of its anti-Castro grours 
operating out of New Orleans. Ca-
bell, who was no longer deputy 
director but still kept vigil over 
numerous covert activities, repor-
tedly wanted Morrow to find out

oThe last straw for the New 
Orleans conspirators, according 
to Morrow, was- probably the, 
arrest in early October 1963 of 
Mario Kohly, himself, and two. 
others involved in the CIA's coun-
terfeit peso scheme. The Ken-i 
? nedys, Morrow says, had ordered:

arrests and so bust up the CIA's; 
last best hope at undermining, 
Castro's Cuba. .

claims. any firsthand information. 
He goes on to speculate about how 
Oswald was used, the existence of 
an Oswald look-alike in the Lake 
Pontchartrain camp, and the roles 
of Ruby, Shaw, Ferrie, and others., 
'Even what he says he was told' 
staggers the imagination and, in, 
most instances, there is simply no 
way to back it up. He points to a 
vast conspiracy, similar to the dis-
? credited Garrison case, and an 
equally vast cover-up by the Ken-
nedys themselves around - the 
Cuban missile situation. 
? Still, no matter how incredible it 
' seems, the Morrow book cannot be 
dismissed out of hand. Consider,

NEW TIMES 
25 June 1976 
With the help of handwriting analysis, a test called the 
Psychological Assessment System and 30,000 personality files, 
Jim Keehner spent seven years screening CIA agents and 
recruits. He's now on the agency's "useless person" list 
By Maureen Orth 
The young CIA case officers looked intently at their instructor. He was hold-
ing up a lemon. "I want you to take this lemon," he said, "and never let it leave you 
for the next three or four days. Smell it, touch. it. Tell me your feelings about it. Get 
to know your lemon like you've never known another lemon in your life. This is an 
order." 
The instructor was teaching "Personality Theory." He was a CIA psycholo-
gist, an expert called upon to train fresh clandestine operators in some of the secret 
arts of intelligence work. The lemon exercise was supposed to measure and improve 
their sensitivity, and the trainees were required to turn in written "contact" reports 
several days later. It was the usual mix. Some had developed meaningful relation-
ships with their fruits. They rhapsodized for three pages about their lemons and had 
no trouble picking them out from a bowl of dozens. One nonconformist, however, 
merely drew a big picture of his lemon and labeled it with a question mark. Still, the 
instructor, Jim Keehner, was pleased. "I was trying to get them in contact with their 
feelings," he explained. "Feelings had been left out of their previous training, which 
is all cognitive." 
. In 1968 the CIA hired Jim Keehner as a specialist in the agency's .ongoing 
effort to increase the psychological skills and awareness of its employees. A CIA 
case officer's prime duty is to recruit "agents" among foreign citizens around the 
world, and the agency has a vital interest in any method?no matter how far out?
that promises to reveal weaknesses, vulnerabilities and psychic pressure points in 
' possible recruits. 
The CIA. in fact, has become one of the world's foremost laboratories for unit-
., pal.psychologicalAschniques. Keehner's office in the agency's Technical Service Di-
vision had a 'mandate to test anything?from hallucinogenic drugs to computerized 
handwriting analysis?that would help case officers manipulate their agents or other 
unsuspecting potential agents. Keehner's mission was to teach other CIA officers 
how to bring agents under control.. Ironically, the negative nature of his work loos-
ened his own self-control and brought him to the point of a complete breakdown. Still 
bearing the marks of his shattering experience, Keehner hesitantly agreed to provide 
. a portrait of the agency's psychological operations.

We had met for the first lime only a few he "is an official outcast, a, name on the 
CIA's "useless person" list. 
It wasn't always so. .A small, thin, 
36-year-old Kentuckian, Keehner spent 
six years traveling the world for the CIA 
with a packet of suicide pills in his pock-
ct. He never forgot the motto of his 
office: "Every man has his price." His 
job was to find the weakest part of a for-
eign agent's character, his "squeaky 
board," and then tell the CIA how to 
step on it. He tested European bankers, 
Near Eastern journalists, Vietnamese 
farmers, a Buddhist monk and an Afri-
can hashish smuggler. He told them he 
was testing their aptitude, but he was real-
ly charting how their minds worked. 
"We liked some people with low 
intelligence who would follow orders," 
Keehner said. "Then there were some 
mean ones, the killers. But basically I 
'tested nondescript middle-class people 
who did it for the money." 
Back at CIA headquarters in 
Langley, Virginia, Keehner reported his 
findings and taught the case officers how 
to take advantage of them. He also test-
ed the case officers themselves, seeking 
out their weaknesses so that the agency? 
would know how vulnerable they were 
to enemy spies. 
In addition to his direct testing, 
Keehner assessed many potential agents 
indirectly, without the benefit of inter-
views or tests. He used the information 
the CIA collects every year on thou-
sands of unsuspecting foreigners. No 
matter how loyal these people might be 
to their country, the CIA considers them 
potential traitors and labels them either 
"susceptible": or "vulnerable." Today 
the agency still spends millions to study 
them, tap their phones and bug their bed-
rooms in an effort to lure them pr force 
them to become agents. Jt is not a pretty 
business, and Keehner had to plot how 
to bring these targets to the breaking 
point. 
"I was sent to deal with the most 
negative aspects of the human condi-
tion," he said. "It .was planned destruc-
tiveness. First, you'd check to see if you 
could destroy a man's marriage. If you 
could, then that would be enough to put 
a lot of stress on the individual, to break' 
him down. Then you might start a rumor 
campaign against him. Harass him con-
stantly. Bump his car in traffic. A lot of it 
is ridiculous, but it may have a cumula-
tive effect." 
The CIA recruited Jim Keehner 
? under deep cover. He was excited when 
a high-powered Washington outfit called 
Psychological Assessments Associates 
wanted to interview him. PAA, with 
offices in Washington and abroad, is the 
cover .for the agency's psychologists. Its 
recruiters impressed Keehner by telling 
him that if he got the job he would travel 
the world testing the aptitudes of busi-
ness executives for high-level positions. 
It was August of 1964.

ments checked him out for a top secret 
security clearance. Then .the company 
contacted him in Kentucky. where he 
was working in the mental ward of a hos-
pital, and invited him to interview fur-
ther for what he thought was a glamor-
ous job with a private psychological - 
firm: "They called me in," he remem-
bers, "and said, 'This is the CIA. Do you 
want to go on or do you"want to stop?' 
It's a funny feeling when they tell you? , 
frightening, yet thrilling and shocking." 
He barely hesitated before saying yes. 
Visions of dashing spooks danced in his 
head. 
One thing puzzled Keehner about 
the CIA's final interviews, however. 
"They never once asked me about the 
Vietnam War," he said. Neither did they 
probe his views of morality, not in seven 
screening interviews and not when he 
look the CIA's standard lie-detector test. 
No one from the agency questioned 
Keehner about American involvement in 
Vietnam, then at its peak. The oversight 
proved to be significant. 
Keehner's intensive training in 
the clandestine ways of the CIA sur-
prised him. "I was intrigued with spies," 
he said. "But.as soon as I got to training 
I learned that no American who works 
for the CIA is a .spy. Never. A spy is a 
foreign agent who commits treason and 
gives information against his govern-
ment. In the CIA we act as his helpers 
and get information for our country. 
Never call an American a spy." The 
need for secrecy was drilled into him 
over and over again. He had to sign a 
contract binding him not to reveal his 
work to.anyone. 
. After training, Keeliner reported 
to the Washington office of PAA, where 
he set out to learn the rudiments of the 
remarkable test he would soon adnrinis-
ter round the world. Keehner's boss, 
John Gittinger (now retired), scored a 
major breakthrough in measuring per-
sonality development about 25 years 
ago. Gittinger took the standard IQ 
test?the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scale?and converted it to a highly so-
phisticated tool that can predict behavior 
based on personality types. The elabo-
rate Psychological Assessment System 
(PAS) uses a series of letters to catego-
rize individual personality traits: "inter-
nalizers" and "externalizers" (I and E), 
those who see the forest (F, flexibles) 
and those who see the trees (R, regulat-
ed). those who adapt ea,ily (A) and those 
who don't (U). PAS hypothesizes that 
everyone is born with a fixed personality 
formula that is often inotlified in early 
childhood and adolescence hut never en-
tirely altered. 
Because of the I (2",1?N complexity 
and it.; bias toward tt;?neii,- tb.stirty, it has 
not nc.ittil:ir in the 
scientific community. I tio.yever, 1,01110

with the PAS concede that it can 
be effective for ( ?1 A's p.1,1,0s,,,. "If I 
Were getting into the tottitt.e. business:, 
says Denver clinical psychologist Keith 
Davis, "I'd think of the PAS I use it in a 
psychological program aimed at helping 
patients. But people skilled in subtle ma-
nipulation can use it for ? negative pur-
poses." 
"I can be Very sneaky myself 
about predicting behavior and. personal-
ity formulas," says Dr. Charles Kraus-
kopf of the University of Missouri Psy-
chology Department. "We should be 
thinking about this the same way we're 
thinking about nuclear problems and bio-
engineering. It's not something that will 
hide under the carpet." 
Kcehner thinks the public ought 
to know about many of the techniques 
the CIA uses. "One of the tragedies is 
that most CIA research in the basic 
sciences is never made avail.tide to the 
HAmerican public who paid for it," he 
, says. "My boss, for example, was a non-
academic who carried half his work 
around in his head." 
Gittinger finally had a monograph 
of his Psychological Assessment. System 
published in The Journal of Clinical Psy-
chology in April of 1973. Today the sys-
tem is being used in several American 
universities and hospitals as an aid in vo-
cational guidance, marriage counseling, 
correlating personality type with psy-
chosomatic illness arid teaching mental 
patients how to play up their strengths. 
Keehner believes that most people work-
ing with the test have no idea of its use 
by the CIA. And certainly nobody now 
using the PAS outside the agency has ac-
cess to the 3G,000 personality formulas 
the CIA has accumulated over the years. 
The CIA even goes so far as to 
dub the personalities of entire countries 
with the magic PAS initials. The U.S., 
for example, is ERA?"a masculine ste-
reotype"?externally oriented, regulat-
ed in behavior and adaptable. The coun-
try that most resembles the U.S. is none 
other than the U.S.S.R. "The Russians 
are EEUs," says Keehner, "like us, but 
unadaptable. They follow authority. 
blindly." China, on the other hand, is 
1RU (internalived, regulated, unadapt-
able), just like former-President Nixon. 
? "I've never met an IRU I've liked," 
says Keehner. 
In fact, nobody in Keeliner's 
office could stand to watch Nixon on 
television. Out or 15 psychologists in 
Keehner's office, 14 voted for McGov-
ern, not because they loved McGovern 
but because they had all indirectly as-
sessed Nixon. Our former leader fared 
very imoily. Trained to spot lying, the 
CIA psychologists concluded that Nixon 
lied in public most of the time. 
In addition to testii;g. Keohner's 
office? often whipped up psychological 
studies of world leaders. Foreign presi-
dents and their aides had their handwrit-
ing seantinized for signs of psychic iin-
balancc. 1< edifier worked on the files of. 
many foreign officials, but the ttssess.. 
.ments on the really big enchiladas were 
left to his bosses. Keehner happened to 
see Fidel Castro's assessment, and it 
noted he had sex with his pants on. 
Keehner thought the CIA charter 
strictly forbade the agency to assess 
American citizens, so he was surprised 
when the news broke that the agency had 
compiled a psychological profile on Dan-
iel Ellsberg because of what Keelmer 
calls a "bureaucratic screw up." "I 
guess the Plumbers broke into that office 
to get Ellsberg's psychiatric files for the 
shrinks," he said. "We could have done 
it without them. I asked my boss if he 
would have assessed Ellsberg, and he 
told me that we probably would have 
done it if the White House had asked us 
to." 
Keehner's office did assess Com-
mander Lloyd Bucher when the Navy 
spy ship the Pueblo was captured by the 
North Koreans. "We were very in-
volved in trying to figure out how the 
North Koreans might affect the crew 
psychologically," said Keehner. "Buch-
er should never have been commander 
of that ship. He was an orphan, you 
know. lie wouldn't intentionally givr 
away anything. But he was not equipped 
to handie tiny aspect of the sittiation 
was in.'? 
The CIA assessed Sirhan Sirhan 
when Robert Kennedy was assassinated, 
and concluded he was insane. Keehner 
says he knows of no official assessment 
of Lee Lir% ey Oswald, but he says that 
CIA ps,l,cholo2ical experts studied Os-
wald on their own and concluded he was 
incapable of killing the President by him-
self. (One of the CIA employees who 
,worked on the Oswald material 
confirrned both the study and the conclu-
sion.) The agency also analyzed letters 
from American POWs in Nor th Vietnam 
to see if their handwriting showed the 
effects of torture. It did, and sonic of the 
prisoners were judged to be hallucinat-
ing. 
The CIA takes handwriting analy-
sis quite seriously. According to Keeh-
net, the agency's sophisticated methods 
can s ork wonders with a simple hand-
writing sample, to the point, of detecting 
certain diseases before they are subject 
to medical diagnosis. Every New Year's 
Day, all the CIA agents in the Soviet 
Union forwaid their New Year's cards 
from Russian friends to CIA. headquar-
ters so that the handwriting can be 
analyied and filed tovay. 
The :Taney even spent a half mil-

handwriting by computer. It was sup-

Keelinci says, "If you take the test and

The CIA denies it, but Keehner 
says it still uses sexual ruses to entrap

collaborators. In 1969 Keehncr. went to 
New York to give the "aptitude test" to 
an Americaii nurse who had volunteered 
for unofficial ninht duty. "We wanted' 
her to sleep with this Russian," he. ex-
plained. "Either the Russian 'would fall 
in, love with her and clefecL or we'd 
blackmail him. .1 had to see if she could 
sleep with hirn over a period of time and. 
not get involved emotionally. Boy, was. 
she toug.h." 
. Keehner .became disgusted with 
entrapment tearriques. however, espe-
cially. after watchipe a film of an agent in 
bed with a "recruitment target." CIA 
'ease officer's. many of Whom K eehner 
says "got their jollies" from such assign-
ments. made the film ?ith a ldden cam-
era. Keehner was not only repulsed by 
the practice but also found it. quite inef-
fective. "You don't really recruit agents 
with sexual blackmail," he says. "That's 
why I couldn't even take reading the files 
after a while. I was sickened at seeiiig 
people take pleasure in other people's 
inadequacies. First of all, I thought it 
was just dumb. For all the money going 
out, nothing ever came back. We don't 
recruit that many people. Most of our 
agents are walk-ins, people who are easy 
? to buy anyway.", - ? 
Psychologist Ann .Herndon, a for-
mer CIA colleague who quit to go into 
private practice, corroborated Keeh-
ner's view of the CIA's ineffectiveness 
in using blackmail as a recruiting tech-
nique. "I never once saw anyone recruit-
ed in the work! did," she said: "I saw 70 
to 80 cases a month. We haven't yet re-
cruited our first Mainland Chinese, and 
there are at least 14)0 people working full-
time on it." 
"It's pretty much of a game," 
Keehner Said. "People took pleasure in 
the gamesmanship. Everybody was 
looking for a promotion." . 
Every morning at 8:30, when Jim 
Keehner reported for work, he passed 
the inscription in the marble wall of the 
CIA's main lobby: "And ye shall know 
the truth and the truth shall make ye 
free" (John 7:32). Eventually, the words 
began to grate on his nerves. He saw it as 
a symbol of the hypocrisy he felt sur-
rounded by. Also, he became more and 
more disturbed by the moral implications 
of his daily work, which was. centered 
around the PAS testing system, Keehner 
occasionally wondered what would hap-
pen if the government decided to test ev-
eryone and run their genetic ,formulas 
next to their social security numbers on a. 
giant computer. "There are horrible pos-
sibilities,'' he.said. "It's social engineer-
ing and we don't know yet if people can 
beat the test." 
His disaffection with the agency 
first began over the issue of the Vietnam 
War. His office was divided over the 
war, with the younger psychologists op-
posing and the older ones endorsing 
American policy to keep communism 
from spreading, another inch. Keehner 
also disapproved of the military cast that 
Came over the agency durinAits Vietnam 
operations. "The agency was always 
swarming with colonels from the Penta-
gon," he says, "I couldn't stand the 
waste of money being poured into Viet-
nam. 
"My job was becoming more dis-
gusting to me every day. But was over-
whelmed by the CIA. The first year is 
confusion. The second is bewilderment. 
The third it just kind of dawns on you 
what's happening." Keehner, ever a 
staunch Catholic, poured out his doubts 
twice a month in the confessional to no 
avail. "Masturbation was a mortal sin," 
he says. "But when! talked about sexual 
blackmail and manipulating people, the 
priest said it was a grey area." 
It took a while for Keehner to re-
bel. But he found solace in attending 
sensitivity training sessions generously 
financed by the CIA. Touchie-feelie 
techniques were some of the many meth-
ods the agency explored for possible use 
in psychological assessments. They were 
still alive after the CIA had abandoned 
hypnosis, LSD, truth serums and palm-
reading. (ESP, says Keehner, is "still up 
in the air.") Both of Keehner's bosses 
attended early sensitivity training groups 
and found them interesting. They ap-
proved of his request to train as a sensi-
tivity group leader, under cover of 
course. 
Keehner . soon found himself an 
enthusiastic devotee a group grope. He 
thought sensitivity sessions not only per-
sonally satisfying but also a possible 
means of reforming the agency. On 
Mondays he went to Gestalt. On Tues-
days he saw his psychiatrist. On 
Wednesdays and Fridays he did yoga. 
On Thursdays he rested. "I was really 
coming into touch with my feelings for 
the first time. I started strongly vocaliz-
ing my objections to the war atthe office. 
I stopped wearing a tie to work and that 
was against regulations." 
Rebeling was an entirely new con-
cept to Keehner. He had managed to 
grow up and go through 14 years of Cath-
olic education without once disobeying 
his parents or his teachers. No doubt 
those qualities made him an ideal candi-
date for the CIA, but the agency obvi-
ously forgot to assess the effects of con-
temporary self-help therapy. 
In 1971 Keehner was assigned a 
'tour of duty 'in Southeast Asia. He re-
fused to go. One boss told him to "go 
over anyway and sabotage it from the 
field." Keehner still said no. He never 
got another promotion. 
Outside the office, however, 
Keehner was still cautious., He saw his 
psychiatrist once a week for an entire 
year undercover because he felt an-
nouncing where he worked would breach 
CIA security. Instead, Keehner painted 
such a rosy picture of his job at Psycho-
logical Assessments that his psychiatrist 
asked if PAA had any job openings. "1 
thought I could just talk about my per-
sonal problems and set my work aside," 
Keehner said. "But the more I got into 
? 
sinking ship." 
A year later, after Keehner devel-
oped a severe eye infection, the CIA's 
powerful Medical Division put him on 
"medical hold," restricting his duties. 
He was relieved that he no longer had to 
go abroad for assessments, though he 
was still expected to work On files in the 
office. He asked instead if he could train 
incoming CIA recruits, and his request 
was granted. 
In his new training position, 
Keehner enjoyed creative freedom. One 
day in class it gave him great satisfaction 
to play the record Hair and send the re-
frain blasting through camp: "Right here 
in niggertown we've got a dirty little 
war." Then he had the recruits march 
around the room to feel the music and to 
have a little human interaction. The old-
er instructors were amazed. His classes 
were always monitored after that. Next, . 
he requisitioned 40 lemons from Sup-
ply?the first and last such request?and 
had the recruits get to know their lem-
ons. Keehner was not asked back to CIA 
training camp. 
"Ninety-five percent of the people 
who took my course gave it an excellent 
in their evaluations," Keehner says. "I 
hoped the course would make them face 
the reality of what they were doing and 
make them think about the theory that 
`every man has his price.' Later some of 
them said it helped them to get closer to 
people so they could recruit agents bet-
ter." 
Undaunted, he next came up with 
the idea of running week-long sensitivity 
groups for CIA employees as part of 
their -in-agency training. The CIA gave 
its approval, but only after Keehner had ? 
had a little chat with William Colby, who 
was then director of Clandestine Ser-
vices. "Don't let the press know we're 
running these groups." Colby warned. 
"Time or Newsweek will get a hold of 
this and make it sound like we're doing 
something crazy." ' 
Tension is such ail occupational 
hazard at the CIA that the agency is un-
usually tolerant of activities designed to 
relieve its employees' anxiety. But it in-
sists that these activities take place "in 
house" for reasons of security and con-
trol. Keehner's new project became an 
officially authorized outlet for the pent-
up emotions of. the case officers. Ulti-
mately, Recliner's prolonged exposure 
to sensitivity training caused him to slip 
his own psychic moorings. But he was 
happy with his new wink at the onset be-
cause he felt he was helping people 
again. 
Everyone who came Keehner's 
"Human Interaction Lai)" had to take 
the PAS test first', and also have his 
handwriting analyzed. kechner didn't 
want anyone who seemed unstable to go 
through such an .intense experience. Be-
sides, it wouldn't do to have too many Fs 
and not enough Its in a group. "When I 
had all 1:s? once I thought I'd go crazy," 
Keehner says. "Everyone was so sensi-

e Group participants ranged in age 
from 20 to 60. They were mostly middle-
level employees. "The big officers 
wouldn't come because they heard sto-
ries of how people broke down and 
cried," said Keehner, "They'd encour-
age the younger employees to come, 
though," Keehner wanted his charges to 
let it all hang out. They crawled around 
the floor making animal sounds. They 
went on "trust walks": One person with 
his eyes open had to lead another person 
with his eyes closed through the woods. 
They stood in the middle of the room and 
waved in the breeze pretending they 
were flowers. "I played music," Keeh-
ner said, "and told them to go to their fa-
vorite place in the room and imagine 
they were corning tip out of the earth. 
They moved like corn blowing in the 
wind. ? 
o- Meanwhile, Keehner continued to 
. experiment, on his own with new kinds of 
encounter groups. His experience with 
ir Primal Scream therapy, however, 
y ? 
proved to be a nightmare and precipitat-
*ed his eventual downfall with the CIA. 
Primal Scream requires its partici-
et pants to stay nude in a swimming pool 
II for six hours. Keehner began feeling mi-
nt easy when someone put the "Agnus 
Dei" on the pool loudspeakers. After all, 
the music came right from the Mass, and 
it occurred to Keehner that Mass was 
probably where he should be at this 
hour, not naked in a swimming pool with 
a bunch of people in varying stages of 
freaking out. 
At first he tried to concentrate on 
helping others, holding back on his own 
feelings?a mistake. Finally, a leader 
started pressing on his neck.and Keehner 
started screaming. "Then he started 
pushing on my genitals," Keehner ex-
plained. "Well, boy, I let out a scream. 
don't know if it was a Primal Scream or 
not. That's what they called it." 
Within 24 hours of his Primal 
Scream, Keehner was so anxiety-ridden 
he had to take three kinds of tranqui4z.-
ers. He was unable to work. Then lie had 
a case of appendicitis and stayed home 
for six weeks. When he got back to work 
he refused to do any more assessments. 
Keehner went to see John Gittinger. 
"Why did you ever recruit me?" he 
asked: Keehner realized he was "out of 
pattern," a poor boy from Kentucky 
. compared to- most of the Ivy League 
types in the agency. ''1 don't know," 
Giitiu'er replied. 
Keehner continued his human in-
teraction labs, but not assessments. One 
day it was leaked to him he had been put 
on the "useless person" list. He was fo-
rious_ Why hadn't he been told in 
advance? he wanted to know. He 
planned a confrontation. 
Keehner waited until he was at a 
staff lunch with all the other psycholo-
gists. including the head of the entit e 
Technical Services Division. He began 
"I remember this one lawyer who 
had been passed over for promotion. All 
of a sudden he started to cry and cry. lie 
said he felt isolated from all the other 
flowers in the room. His one fantasy was 
that he was a daisy and that he was going 
to die all alone. A couple of days later he 
brought me a colorful poster. It said, 
'Thank God someone is crazy enough) to 
. care for a daisy.' " 
While leading groups, Keehner 
avoided assessments as much as possi-
ble. But one day Kechoer's boss called 
him into his office. "Ile said I wasn't giv-
ing the case officers in the field enough 
support, not getting in and telling them 
how to manipulate and destroy. I said, 
`No, it makes me sick to my stomach.' 
He said, 'It bothers all of us but we don't 
articulate it.' "

about a month later. "The CIA never

of vindictiveness." The agency gave him 
a $15,0(X) contract to continue running 
his sensitivit y groups for a year. Ile was

a 
? By H. R. Haldeman 
"I just wanted to wish you and 
your family a Happy New Year, 
Bob," said Alexander Butterfield in 
an unexpected telephone call to our 
rented home in Arlington. It was Dec. 
31, 1974, the eve of the verdict in the 
Watergate cover-up conspiracy trial. 
Butterfield ? who revealed the 
existence of the White House tapes to 
the Ervin Committee, thus escalating 
the Watergate storm ? had appeared 
originally as a prosecution witness at 
Fourth of a Series 
the trial in Judge John J. Sirica's 
courtroom. Alex later offered to be a 
character witness for me, a move 
which the prosecution twice blocked 
successfully through legal maneuver-
in 
Watching Butterfield wait on the 
witness stand, trying to help me, only 
to be denied the opportunity, remind-
ed me of our long relationship dating 
back to UCLA and the circumstances 
under which he ,came to work in the 
? White House. 
ALEX ORIGINALLY approached 
the White House on his own initiative 
? not because I recruited him. He 
was 'soon to become an Air Force 
general. I have never understood 
why he insisted, against my advice, 
on dropping his commission. Or why 
he suddenly wanted to be part of the 
Nixon team. 
In view of his subsequent role, 
these actions seem even more curi-
ous today. 
Was Butterfield- a CIA agent? 
Maybe. I just don't know. 
In retrospect, I'm ambivalent as to 
whether the agency was out to get 
Nixon. I don't dismiss it as an impos-
sibility. I do believe that there are a 
number of unanswered questions 
-about the break-in at the Watergate. 
The agency had the capacity and 
perhaps, unknown to me, the motiva-
tion. 
Before that fateful day, June 17, 
4972, seven men ? Richard Nixon, 
John Mitchell, John Ehrlichman, 
-John Dean, Jell Magruder, Charles 
Colson, and .?functioned together 
as a very productive team we were, 
the "White House people." 
? 
THE ONLY connection ,any of us 
had with Watergate before then was 
that John Mitchell lived in the apart-
ment complex bearing that name. 
But, since the spring of 1973, we 
were henceforth to become known in 
history as the "Watergate people".; 
The Nixon administration had begun 
fading from a constructive govern-
ment into a defensive, embattled re-
;gime, only to capsize in the summer 
of 1974. 
Suddenly, in a federal courthouse, 
the three senior associates of a re-
signed president of the United States 
? together with two 1972 campaign c 
aides, Robert Mardian and Kenneth' 
Parkinson ? were on trial. It gave r 
me an eerie feeling, sometimes, to d 
realize during their testimony that I. t 
had recruited three of the confessed 
Watergate figures who took the wit-
ness stand during that trial ? Dean, 
Magruder and Colson. And that, as 
Ehrlichman and I waited 
throughout the long proceedings, un-: 
seen but strongly felt, was the brood-
ing presence of Richard Nixon. 
A number of myths still exist about 
the overall relations of the "Water-
gate people," not only with each 
other but with the presidept himself. 
MITCHELL AND I, for example, 
had an excellent working and person-
al relationship, despite the gap in our 
age, background and interests. We 
were generally in agreement on most 
matters, although there were some 
sharp differences regarding person-
Ehrlichman and Mitchell, on the 
other hand, had limited rapport, "a 
? basically different approach to the 
job, and very little mutual trust, fre-
quently dealing at arm's length re-
? garding the policy and operation of 
the Justice Department. 
John Dean's relationship with 
Mitchell ? the father and son anal-
ogy ? was not as close as had been 
publicized. But Dean was to a de-
gree, a protege of Mitchell, and there 
was a strong, personal bond between 
them. Mitchell, for example, was 
concerned that Dean's White House 
role would not be large enough and 
was very reluctant to see him trans-
? fer from the Justice Department. . 
? Mitchell and Jeb Magruder had, as 
far as I know, a good working rela-
tionship. Jeb, who was afraid of 
Mitchell as he was of all senior staff, 
was determined to be Atty. Gen. 
Mitchell's boy at the "Committee to 
Re-elect the President." 
CHUCK COLSON and 
Mitchell ? well, there was 
a strong mutual distrust 
and dislike there. 
With the president, John' 
Mitchell enjoyed a peer 
relationship, absolutely 
unique in the Nixon White 
House. He had full access, 
was very free to disagree 
with the president, and 
argued his points strongly. 
Nixon used him as a top 
level agent in dealing with 
the Cabinet, Kissinger and 
political matters, trusting 
him completely. 
John Ehrlichman and I. 
had been close personal and 
family friends for 25 years, 
going back to our days at 
UCLA. Originally identified 
as a "Haldeman man," 
probably because I re-
ruited him for the White 
House, ?John built his own 
elationship with the presi-
ent with my encourage-, 
neat and assistance. 
Approved 
Nixon had a high regard 
for Ehrlichman's ability 
and judgment. John's as-
sociation with the presi-
dent, however, was often 
slightly strained and 
uncomfortable in a mutual 
way. Analytical and self-as-
sured, Ehrlichman disa-
greed with the president 
without fear, frequently, 
and in a blunt, direct man-
ner. 
JOHN HAD SOME defi-
nite reservations about 
Nixon personally. While re-
specting the president's 
ability and potential, he ex-
pressed concerns about 
Nixon's lifestyle, specifical-
ly in the area of drinking. 
t Dean and Ehrlichman 
worked well together. Ehr-
lichman tutored Dean in the 
many roles of counsel to the 
president, and used him as 
an agent on many matters. 
On the other hand, Magrud-
er and Ehrlichman had no 
real relationship. 
? I forced some degree of 
cooperative effort between 
Chuck Colson and Ehrlich-
man, although there was a 
mutual distrust and dislike 
between them. If Ehrlich-
Man had a fault, he was, 
like Mitchell, weak in his 
judgment of staff people. 
John Dean was the "hot-
dog swinger" in the 
"square" Nixon White 
House, neither awed by the 
building or its chief occu-
pant: He was smooth, han-
dled himself well, and was 
enthusiastically backed by 
Mitchell, Richard Klein-
dienst (Mitchell's deputy at 
the Justice Department and 
his successor as attorney 
general in March 1972), 
Egil Krogh (aide to John 
Ehrlichman named under-. 
secretary of transportation 
in December 1972), and , 
Ehrlichman. 
DEAN'S ? relationship 
with the' president, despite 
suggestions to the contrary, 
did not exist until Water-
gate, and only then as a 
project officer. I recruited 
him, but never saw his FBI 
dossier which was not in-
cluded in his personnel file. 
But that fact didn't worry 
me, since I assumed that 
Dean had been cleared at 
Justice. My former staff 
would be amused to know 
that, regarding Dean, I vio-
lated my own cardinal rule 
laid down for all subordi-:

Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100400001-2 
nates "Don't assume." 
If I had seen Dean's FBI 
dossier it would have bar-
red him from the White 
House. Allegations about a 
conflict-of-interest charge, 
however slight, involving 
his prior affiliation with a 
law firm would have been 
enough to concern me about 
the smoke, whether or not 
there was any fire. 
Chuck Colson was always 
a problem. Frankly, I didn't 
like him, nor did many 
others. His tough, abrasive 
manner earned him a bad 
reputation with all the staff, 
with perhaps the exception 
of Dean. He was a protege 
of Bryce Harlow (an assist-
ant and later counsellor to 
President Nixon), who 
introduced him to the White 
House. I built Colson up, 
and the president, who de-

HIGHLY POLITICAL, 
Colson loved the game, 
spicing it with touches of fa-
naticism. But Colson played 
to Nixon's darker, less ap-
pealing side. He was not a 
seasoned staff man in the 
sense of weighing all sides. 
Chuck took his own view 
and pushed it all-out. If he 
had a key fault it was a will-
ingness, even an eagerness, 
to carry out the president's 
orders indiscriminately. 
Jeb Magruder was an 
ambitious bootlicker (by his 
own self-description). While 
a good project man, he was 
always self-serving and 
weak, pragmatic and with-
out any real convictions. He 
was.full of baloney but I 
found that I could squeeze it 
out of him. I had to run Jeb 
by fear and constant goad-
ing. As with many of the 
junior men on the White 
House staff, I had to chan-
nel and use Magruder's 
self-interest and keep him 
on a tight leash. 
Magruder had no real 
relationship with the presi-
dent at all. Originally tap-
.ped as my assistant, he be-
came John Mitchell's man 
? by his own design. 
DURING OUR three-
month trial in Washington I 
had time to reflect on some 
of the incidents leading up 
to my resignation as chief

Washington Star Staff Writer 
- Alexander Butterfield, the man 
who revealed theexistence of the se-
cret recording system in the Nixon 
White House, is again in the news 
with a suggestion that he might have 
been a CIA agent. ? 
The renewed suggestion of a CIA 
link has left Butterfield somewhat 
puzzled and perhaps a little worse off. 
While others connected with the 
Watergate White House have pros-
pered ? or have been convicted of 
crimes ? Butterfield has been job 
hunting. 
"It doesn't help when your name is 
in the news all the time," says But-
terfield, whose testimony about the 
secret White House recordings came. 
under questioning by the Senate 
Watergate committee. ?

Richard N. Nixon's White House

possibility that the CIA, for some 
motivation unknown. was "out to

Butterfield, a former Air Force 
officer, had joined the Nixon admin-
istration in its first days. He served 
in the White House and as federal 
aviation administrator from 1973 
until last year. 
In his ilevnipapee article, Heide-
mau laes this to say about Butterfield 
sled the CIA:

"In view

today. 
"Was Butterfield a CIA 
agent? Maybe. I just don't 
know. 
"In retrospect, I'm am-
bivalent as to whether the 
agency was out to get 
Nixon," Haldeman writes. 
BUTTERFrELD has had 
to contend with the specter 
of the CIA since last sum-
mer, when a ? former Air 
Force intelligence officer, 
Col. L. ? Fletcher Prouty, 
said he had been told that 
Butterfield was the CIA's 
contact man in the White 
House, a position that would 
not entail spying on those 
for Whom he worked. 
Butterfield has emphati-
cally denied it. "I'm not 
anti-CIA. It just so happens 
that I haven't been (con-
nected with the agency)," 
he says. 
And he has picked up 
some substantial support in 
that assertion. After 
Prouty's comments, the 
Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee looked into the issue. 
Its chairman, Sen. Frank 
Church, D-Idaho, later an-
nounced the committee had 
found "no scintilla of evi-
dence that would substanti-
ate such a charge." 
Butterfield says he long 
ago became wary of those 
who staffed the Nixon White 
House. He says that when 
the Watergate prosecutor's 
operation wits going full 
tilt, he was called in by 
prosecutors to explain a 
memorandum he had writ-
ten that made it appear as.

Butterfield said he was 
able to demonstrate that 
the memorandum had been 
,doctored to give that im-
pression but he was shock-
ed that some one in the 
White House had made the 
attempt. 
with Nixon about the 
"Haldeman problem" and 
the options which might still 
be available regarding it. 
Kissinger, never one of 
the "Watergate people," 
said that even the thought 
of resignation on my part 
was "incomprehensible" to 
him. He told me that if 
Nixon accepted my resigna-
tion, or permitted me to 
leave under any circum-
stances that he, Kissinger, 
would resign immediately.-
"I won't serve in an 
administration which would 
permit such a thing to hap-
pen," he emphasized. 
In several telephone con-
versations over the years 
after I left the White House, 
Henry has expressed the 
same feeling of support con-
cerning my departure, but 
he didn't resign over it: 
Now . 
? 
WHEN ASKED why 
Haldeman might be reviv-
ing the CIA business, But-
terfield says, "I couldn't 
begin to guess," although 
he adds, "he may really 
think that." 
' Butterfield takes issue 
with Haldeman's news-
paper article on several. 
'points. For one thing, But-
terfield had not been select-
ed for, promotion to briga-
dier general, although it 
probably wasn't a bad het, 
since he had been selected 
for full colonel before his 
contemporaries, a signifi-
cant mark of recognition. 
For another thing, But-
terfield says Haldeman 
never advised hint against 
dropping his commission. 
As Butterfield recalls, it he 
was offered a job as Halde-
man's immediate deputy in 
the White House but only if 
he retired from the Alta 
Force and signed on as a 
civilian. 
"He actually did not ad-
vise me to keep- my com-
mission. He said to think 
carefully about it and I 
thought carefully about it," 
Butterfield says. ? 
By December of 1972. 
Butterfield says, he wanted 
to get out of the White 
House and was nominated 
by Nixon to head the Feder-
al Aviation Administration,. 
a post which would require 
him to sever his connection 
with the military service. 
HE ACCEPTED the 
nomination, he said, be-
cause he did not want to ap-
pear "money oriented" and 
because he did not want to 
wish to embarrass the 
president. The resignation 
required by the new post 
ended Butterfield's retire-
ment and other military 
benefits which he had earn-
ed in his 20 years in the Air 
Force. 
The Ford administration 
forced Butterfield's resig-
nation. Later, a bill to rein-
state his military retire-
ment benefits was defeated 
in the Senate amid much 
controversy. Butterfield, 50, 
still has Civil Service re-
tirement. 
For the time being. he is 
doing what he calls -free-
lance consulting," but he 
acknowledges it is a some-
what uncomfortable posi-
tion for a man who spent his 
career in highly structured 
organizations. "I'd like to 
find a job," he says.

ITHE WASHINGTON POST Sunday, June 13,1976 
The 
- 
C010 
?. By George Crile III 
Crile is Washington editor of Harper's magazine. 
N JANUARY, 1975, Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.) 
charged that a senior official of the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration had been offered and had exam-
lined a consignment of exotic assassination devices. The 
instruments included exploding telephones, flashlights 
and cameras, and came complete with triggering mecha-
nisms set to movement, time, pressure, light or sound. 
Their only conceivable use was for anonymous murder. 
. Cot Lucien Conein, the official Weicker named, was 
not in a position to directly deny the senator's assertions. 
For one thing, Weicker produced a memo from the now 
defunct B.R. Fox Co. of Alexandria that seemed to impli-
cate Conein in the company's decision to produce the de-
vices for his consideration. Nevertheless, Conein man-
aged to convince reporters that there was nothing more 
to the incident than the unsolicited mischief of the B.R. 
Fox Co. He had gone to look at some eavesdropping de-
vices that he was thinking of buying for DEA when, 
much to his surprise, he was shown strange weapons 
which he hadn't asked to see and had no intention of 
buying. 
The story made the network news, but with Conein's 
explanation the matter was dropped, and nothing more 
has been heard on the subject. 
Had it been any other Washington official, this ex-
planation might have sufficed. But Col. Conein is no or-
dinary bureaucrat. It seems incredible that there was no 
reaction to the discovery that the man examining the ex-
ploding devices was the same Col. Lucien Conein who 
had been the CIA's notorious Far Eastern operative and 
the only figure associated with President Nixon's for-
mer team to go on to become a senior official of the 
_Ford administration. 
A Legendary Career 
jf T WOULD have been difficult to imagine a more 
turbing appointment than that of Lucien Coneinto al-
most any pest of responsibility in the government, much 
less his appointment to a highly sensitive position involv-
ing the most delicate covert operations. In earlier days 
the French used to. offer two medical degrees: one re-
quiring many years of school, internship and residency, 
and the other calling for an intensive 18-month p1 ogram. 
The short-course doctors were not permitted to practice 
in France but they were given full 'license to operate in 
the Orient. The latter is the kind of license the CIA gave 
Lou Conein. It all but read on his Agency contract: "For 
Use in the Far East Only." . 
Conein's history is by now laeed with legend but the 
following appears to be a reasonable summary of his ex- ? 
ploits before joining the Nixon White House in 1971: 
At the age t2f 17 Conein is said: to have fled his home-
town in Kansas to join the French Foreign Legion. With 
?the entry of the United States into World War II he 
'transferred to the Office of Strategic Services in France, 
where he lived and 1ought441V.fraiopekkg tag& 2 
? hood, who were then part of the Resistance. Before he 
left, Conein says, they made him a member ? an honor 
to bear in mind, for the Brotherhood is an underworld 
? organization deeply involved in the drug trade and con-
sidered even more effective and dangerous than its Sicil-
ian counterpart, the Mafia. 
After the liberation, Conein parachuted into Vietnam 
to join an OSS team fighting the Japanese alongside the 
Vietminh. There he met Ho Chi Minh and Gen. Vo Ngu-
yen Giap. A decade later, in 1954, he was back in Viet-
nam as one of Gen. Edward Lansdale's special team,,, 
charged with setting up a paramilitary organization in 
the Hanoi area. He helped Ngo Dinh Diem consolidate 
his power in South Vietnam the next year and in 1963 116. 
was the U.S. embassy's liaison with the cabal of generals 
who murdered Diem. 
Although be has been accused of engineering the as-
sassination, his actual role seems to have been as the 
Kennedy administration's only direct conduit to the 
coup's plotters. He had occupied this sensitive position 
almost.by default. He was married to a Vietnamese and 
he alone among the Americans was intimate with most 
of the Vietnamese high command. No one else had any-
thing resembling his access to and familiarity with the 
Vietnamese style of doing business. 
Even so, the CIA considered him an unstable commod-
ity and sent him back to Washington. But he soon man 
aged to return as part of an elite 10-man counterinsur, 
gency team under Gen. Lansdale which also included 
Daniel Ellsberg, then still a war hawk. - 
It was Conein's past association with Ellsberg and his 
involvement in Diem's overthrow that brought him to 
:the attention of the White House in 1971. His contact was. 
:E. Howard Hunt, an OSS colleague in World War It 
'Hunt had just begun working with Charles Colson, who 
was intent both on destroying Ellsberg's reputation and 
discrediting President Kennedy (and thus Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, then thought Nixon's most formidable politi-
cal rival). One of Colson's hopes was to cast responsibility 
for Diem's assassination onto President Kennedy him. 
.self. 
' Conein's career was then in a tailspin. He had left the 
, CIA in 1968 and had persuaded a group of past associates 
to back him in a surplus war trading venture in Viet-
nam. By 1970 he had lost all of his and his investors' 
money and was back in Washington, drinking heavily 
and without much hope for the future. It was at this 
point that he was recruited by Howard Hunt. 
Conein didn't offer anything of interest to help the 
White House undermine Ellsberg's reputation but he 
? quickly ingratiated himself with Colson by providing 
. NBC with an interview on the Saigon coup that tied the 
Kennedy administration far closer (in knowledge, at 
least) to that bloody event than before. 
With this entre, be was soon asked to give his opinion 
on how Bud Krogh and his crew of eager young lawyers 
working with the Plumbers in Room 16 might go about 
waging the campaign against drugs just launched by the 
President. 
Operation Diamond 
T IS GENERALLY assumed that the rocits of Water-
.11 are to be found in the creation of the Plumbers 
to investigate national security leaks. But it was Nixon's 
desperate drive against the country's drug epidemic 
Which disclosed to his political operatives what secret re-
sources were available for their use and how to tap 
them: 
To the new President, the country in 1969 seemed to 
be dissolving irretrievably into disorder. Drugs may only 
have been a symptom of a deeper ailment, but seen from 
the White House they were the critical problem from 
which so many other troubles flowed. 
Nixon was so adamant about cutting off the poison 
that in 1971 be declared drugs the country's number one 
Problem and appointed Egil Krogh as his personal aide 
to direct a federal war against nars.ntici diterolf -rom

the White House. 
By the time Conein appeared, Krogh and his young 
aides were desperate to tome up with results for their 
demanding chief. They had concluded that conventional 
approaches to drug enforcement were useless to deal 
with thi.: realities uf the, international narcotics trade. 
The problems were everywhere ? not the least being 
that foreign governments, or at least 'high foreign offi-
cials, were themselves so often part of the trafficking. 
Krogh"s staff was equally frustrated by the reluctance 
of the FLI and particularly the'CIA to join it. J. Edgar 
Hoover had known that dru2S would be a corrupting in-
flunacc on his agents and i.cpt out of it. The CIA was ev-
ery bit as reluctant. From Thailand to Turkey to the Car-
ibbean, those same people smuggling drugs were also 
usclul sources of information on the flow of weapons, 
revolution and international intrigue. The federal drug 
foet esl.; th it these trio-fa:kers be put out of business; 
the CIA wanted to maintain flexibility to gather intellig-
ence. Conchs, then, was just the man Krogh and his aides 
were looking for: a man of the world ? albeit a very spe-
cial world ? who understood the other side and knew 
how to fight it. 
It is uncertain precisely what part Conein played in 
the ensuing White House programs; it can only be 
pointed out that some of them :were so sensitive that 
they required the approval of HenrY Kissinger's 40 Com-
mittee; others appear to have stretched so far over the 
boundaries of legality that they were undertaken in to-
tal secrecy. 
One of these was Operation Diamond, the elaborate 
clandestine organization that Bernard Barker was or-
ganizing in Miami for Howard Hunt. Barker recruited al-
most 200 former CIA Cuban agents and organized them 
into specialized units for future operations. They in-
eluded intelligence and counterintelligence groups and 
a street-fighting arm, Cubans who had brawled for the 
Agency at Communist and anti-Communist rallies across 
Latin America. And there was a particularly sensitive 
sector known as the Action Teams ? an old CIA term 
for units with paramilitary skills including demolition 
and assassination. 
Barker says that Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy talked 
about a number of other operations being organized at 
that time for similar purposes ? Ruby, Opal, Crystal, 
Sapphire. Much later he was told that they were part of 
a larger, White House-coordinated program called Gem-
stone. Much of what Liddy would ultimately propose to 
John Mitchell in his famous $1 mi1i plan of political 
subversion was taken from the Diamond plan that Bar-
ker drafted. Hunt assured Barker that the action squads 
would ultimately be turned against Fidel Castro; in the 
meantime, they would be used in the presidential cam-
paign and then es special soldiers in the international 
drug war. 
Watergate, one might think, should have called a halt 
to such extraleE:al plans for narcotics enforcement; in-
stead it seems that the President merely put a bureau-
cratic face on a guerrilla war. Immediately after the ' 
Join Etirlieliman and Krogh arranged for Co-
nein to be transferred out of the White House to a con-
suiting job with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous 
Drugs. Then, a year later, on July I, 1973, Nixon consoli-
dated all of the previously quarrelling bureaucracies , 
dealing with narcotics into the Drug Engorcement Ad-
ministration; and in November, attracting little atten-
tion in a city ob:;essed with talk of impeachment, Lucien 
Conein was appointed head of DEA's newly formed Spe-
cial Operati-3ns Branch: his job, to create worldwide in-
tellivrice T,'2t.V.C1!?13 ? both insido and outside the 
to Vfentify and ultimately to put a stop 
t3 the work of the major dreg traffickers.

control, people like him can do things other people can-

On a slow day, Conein is often found at Tony's 'or the 
, Class Reunion bar and restaurant, a few blocks from 
DEA's offices, drinking beer and telling stories with a 
bunch of old OSS, CIA and DEA friends. Conein talks 
only occasionally but dominates these gatherings. He sits 
all but motionless save for his compulsive smoking and 
quaffing from a beer battle that looks quite small in his 
thick paw. He has the look of a graying grizzly bear, but 
a better image might be that of a gnarled tree that has

to his visitor's inquiries about him. He then gives his 
stock prefatory tern:ark: "111 tell you anything you want 
to hear but it's nrabehly not the truth." 
Even with th.fa unusual qualification, whatever the 
chief of DEA's Special Operations Branch says- on the 
subject of drugs is necessarily of interest, particularly 
when he starts off with the flat declaration that he 
would never dream oi mounting operations against one 
of the chief sources of narcotics traffic ? the Corsicans. 
"You can get killed that way," he explains. "I will not 
talk about the Ceasicans, period. I happen to be a mem- ? 
tier of the Corsican Brotherhood." 
' "Let me tell yen something," he goes on in a voice that. 
? makes you strain to listen. "When the Sicilians put out a 
contract, it's usually 'united to the continental United 
States or maybe CAnada or Mexico, but with the Corsi-
cans it's internatanal. They'll go anywhere. There's an 
old Corsican proverb: 'If you want revenge and you act 
within 20 years, you're acting in haste.' It wouldn't just 
be me. They'd lethe it out on my children and maybe 
even some grandetiildren. This is the code." 
Amazingly be ei:ids that he would also be wary of run-
ning operations against the CIA's old Cuban agents in 
Miami, a number of whom have gone into the drug 
trade. He compares them with the Corsicans, whose 
effectiveness he Mributes to their training and experi-
ence with the Freach intelligence services: "The Cubans 
have received 2.31 thc? 1.-lidecraft from the Agency. If 
they could get iao Cuba to rrise hell, they can sure as 
bell get into the t_7.5. with drugs." 
The problem in trying to move against such adver-
saries, he explains, is that "we have no cover as far as

tions about his activities at DEA are deadly serious. 
Recruits From CIA. 
THE CREATION of Conein's Special Operations 
Branch stemmed from the Nixon administration's 
Insistence ths t DEA move away from its "buy and bust" 
approach, which yielded only small-time traffickers, and 
create a CIA-styled intelligence capability to identify 
and then eliminate the major suppliers: There would be 
a new intelligence service parallel to the traditional En-
forcement Division. The man assigned to run the new di-
vision, George Belk, was along-time Federal Bureau of - 
Narcotics veteran whose tote,,,11 dree enforcement opera-
tion in Detroit had caused his office to inherit the De-
troit Mafia's old nickname, the "Purple Gang." Belk was 
enthusiastic to a fault, but he had no experience in intel-
ligence and thus relied heavily on Conein for guidance 
in creating what he hoped would becerne an intelligence 
empire. 
The initial problem was that none of the personnel 
available were trained to organize and run professional 
Intelligence operations. A number of retired or active 
CIA men had been recruited in 1972 and 1973 ? the fig-
ure may now run as high as 100. But none of these origi-
nal recruits were operatives; they were analysts or func-
tionaries. What Belk and Conein wanted were men capa-
? ble of establishing intelligence nets to cover entire re-
gions of the world and they asked the CIA if it could 
spare any of its operatives. Conein wanted about 50 but. 
settled for 12. 
The Agency was more than happy to provide DEA 
.with some of its men, for it very much wanted to get out 
of the narcotics work forced on it by the White liaise. 
The CIA was then being drastically cut back and when 
word was spread of the opportunities for advancement 
with the new drug agency a number of operatives were 
Interested. The first recruits were told they would be 
sent overseas with the approximate responsibility of a . 
station chief. Of the 12 accepted none had known -Co-
nein. They all transferred expecting a quick rise to the.: 
top of a new and growing service; all soon bitterly re-
gretted the move. 
Their problems began immediately as most DEA offi-i 
cials resented and suspected the 12 new men before they , 
had even arrived. Two years before, the chief of 13NDD 
had been so distressed by his agency's corruption that, 
'he had the CIA detail him 19 agents to ferret it out. 
Their subsequent success alienated them from many at 
DEA and even managed to cast suspicion over the other 
CIA veterans who joined the new drug agency. 
All kinds of problems flowed from the arrival of Co-
nein's recruits in early 1974. The main difficulty 
stemmed from the bitter attempts of the enforcement 
division to sabotage the growth of the new intelligence 
branch. Enforcement even tried to get the operatives as-
signed to its division. Conein finally directed his men not 
to come to the DEA office until the matter was straight-
ened out. He had them go instead to a "safe house" he 
had acquired for DEA through an old OSS and CIA 
friend. 
A safe house is the CIA's name for a place where 
agents can go in secret: this one was a two-story apart-
ment in the La Salle building at 1028 Connecticut Ave_ 
NW, half a block from the Mayflower Hotel. Conein told: 
his men that the apartment had formerly been operated 
by the CIA. Actually ? as we shall see later ? its ident-
ity Is more mysterious than that. 
It was reportedly in this apartment that Conein and 
his deputy; Sear! iBuch Frank, examined the B. R. Fox as-
sassination devices. Reporters accepted Conein's assur-
ances that he had not expected to be shown the equip-
ment. But according to two senior DEA officials, Conein 
knew precisely what B. R. Fox's representatives planned 
to show him that day.eMore important, they claim that 
he had already developed plans to emilloY them, 
"When you get down to it," explained one of the offi-
cials. "Copein wa organizing an assassination 
He was frustrated by the big-time operators 'who were 
just too insulated to get to . . . He felt we couldn't win, 
the way things were going." 
According to these officials, meetings were held to de-
cide whom to target and what method of assassination to 
employ. Conein then assigned the task to three of the 
former CIA operatives detailed to the Connecticut Ave-
nue safe house. 
The men he chose were former paramilitary case offi-
cers with the Agency's Special Operations Division who 
had run commando raids into North Vietnam. The DEA 
officials described them as first-generation Americans, 
"very young and patriotic and a little naive. They were 
troubled by the assignment but they trusted Conein be-
cause he had been with the CIA. They counted on him 
not to put them in a compromising situation." 
The program was to begin in Mexico. Conein report-
edly had his men prepare operational plans to deter-
mine the feasibility of killing a number of Mexican traf-
fickers with sophisticated exploding devices. For several 
months in 1974 the three, working directly under Co-
nein, traveled back and forth to Mexico. After preparing 
their initial plans he had them identify a number of 
Mexicans to be recruited to carry out the actual mur-
ders. 
According to these accounts, at least one Mexican was 
recruited as an assassination agent. The man had grown 
up in a border town with a number of major traffickers 
and had become a DEA informant after being arrested 
on a drug charge. In exchange for murdering his old 
friends, the DEA agreed to help him become a legal resi-
dent of the.United States. 
The alleged plan was apparently ready to begin by the 
beginning of 1975 when Sen. Weicker made his public 
charge. One of the operatives had already questioned 
Conein on the legality of his assignment. Now, all three 
reportedly rebelled and told Conein they would not par-
ticipate any further. 
"Those three have since been dispatched to the four 
winds, to jobs far from Washington," said one of the. 
DEA officials. "They are bitter about how they were 
used and very afraid of repercussions." 
Conein, in a burst of four-letter words, denied any in-
volvement in such a program. "That is a big lie. That 
is bull  "He said he knew who the sources were and 
that they were the ones who should be investigated, but 
he refused to identify them or to offer any reason why 
they should not be believed. "Go ahead and print it," he 
said twice. "I don't care." One reason he offered to rebut 
the story was that he never had anything to do with any 
programs in Mexico. 
Conein's supervisor, George Belk, now retired, offered 
a different version of Conein's activities. lie said that Co-
nein and several of his agents from the Connecticut Ave-
nue safe house had been working on a program involv-
ing Mexico in 1974. But he said he did not know of any 
plan for DEA to assassinate anyone. "We were trying to 
determine ways and means by which they [the major 
drug traffickers] could be immobilized by the Mexican 
government. ...The idea was to identify the Mexicans 
who were known to be operating... to collect intelligence 
to be passed on to the attorney general's office for ac-
tion by their government." He stressed that there was no 
extralegal activity taking place. 
When asked once again about the reported assassina-
tion program, Belk replied: "That may have been some-
body's concept but nothing ever came of it. As a matter 
of fact, nothing ever happened."

of the exploding devices is considered. News act 0111115

The explanation, is to be found in the identity of the

actual figure behind the B. R. Fox Co. and its arrange-
ments with Conein ? Mitchell Livingston Wer Bell M. 
Wer Bell is one of the world's most successful inventors 
and manufacturers of silencers and such exotic lethal 
weapons as a cigar that fires a single bullet and a swag-
ger stick that doubles as a rocket launcher. But, most im-
portant in this context, he is one of Conein's old OSS, 
friends and, according to staff members on the Senate 
Permanent Investigations Subcommittee, a business 
partner of Conein's at least as recently as 1974. 
In an interview, Wer Bell disarmingly acknowledged a 
recent business relationship with Conein. Further, he 
'proudly asserted that he had worked with Conein to 
provide DEA with assassination devices and that the,B. 
R. Fox Co. had even shared the same duplex apartment 
used by the DEA operatives as a safe house. (This fact is 
confirmed by the La Salle building's records.) 
Conein's apparent use of Wer Bell for DEA operations 
seems all but incredible when the arms manufacturer's 
other activities in 1974 are taken into account. That 
spring, while Conein was readying his assassination pro-
gram, Wer Bell was negotiating a bizarre arms deal with 
Robert Vesco, the fugitive swindler in Costa Rica, Wer 
Bell originally agreed to sell Vest() his entire stock of 2,-
000 silenced machine guns. But he was unable to get an 
export license and so the two reached a tentative agree-
ment to build an Ingram submachine gun factory in 
Costa Rica. (The Ingrain is the same weapon featured in 
the opening scenes or "Three Days of the Condor.") 
These dealings were sufficiently ,menacing to draw 
the interest of Sen. Henry Jackson's Permanent Investi-
gations Subcommittee. Jackson observed that Wer Bell's 
Ingrams are not the "normal military defense weapons. 
This is the kind of weapon ... used for covert purposes 
. shall we say, mini-revolutions or coups or what have 
you." 
Along with Wer Bell's arms deal, the Jackson subcom-
mittee also investigated Vesco's "penetration'? of the 
federal bureaucracy, and particularly the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration. Here it found that the DEA had all 
but killed a promising investigation into charges by a 
government informer that Vesco was trafficking in her-
oin, and that it had then "lost" most of Vesco's file. Even 
more suspicious was the discovery that two of the nar-
cotics agency's wiretap...specialists had flown from Los 
Angeles to New Jersey to sweep Vesco's home and office 
for possible bugs. 
The further the committee probed the entangling re-
lations of Vesco, Wer Bell, Conein and the DEA, the

more questions were raised. For one thing, Wer Bell was 
indicted in 1974, charged with conspiracy to smuggle 
large quantities of marijuana into the country, in a case 
yet to come to trial. The staff wanted to know the pre-
cise nature of his relationship with Conein. 
They had already subpoenaed Conein, Belk and others 
to testify when suddenly the hearings were cancelled. If 
the staff members know why, they don't explain; but 
they also don't conceal their frustration. The decision 
' was not theirs. 
A Pandora's Box 
911 HE RECENT congressional investigations into U.S. 
.11 intelligence activities did not examine narcotics op-
erations, and the President's new guidelines for all other 
intelligence agencies do not even address themselves to 
? DEA operations. DEA is left more or less alone through 
its Inspection Division to regulate itself. It is hard to ex-
pect too much from this check: the man scheduled to he 
appointed to the number two spot in Inspection, Bud 
Frank, is Conein's former deputy. He was on hand that 
day two years ago to review the exploding devices. 
A few months ago, the Justice Department, of which' 
DEA is a branch, conducted an investigation into some 
. of Conein's other operations (see box on opposite page). 
? 
Two attorneys were assigned the task. After reading the 
report of their findings, the assistant attorney general 
concerned instructed them to tone down their conclu-
sions. The attenuated final version was then attached to 
:a genekal report on the intelligence division and strictly 
limited to three copies; one each for the attorney gener-
al, the assistant attorney general, and for Peter Bensin-
ger, DEA's new administrator. 
' It is understandable that no administration would 
wish to take on Col. Conein. It is said that his closet is 
filled with skeletons from his days with the CIA, and 
that he has a lethal knowledge of where a great number 
of other bodies are buried. 
But this alone does not explain the silence of the Ford 
Justice Department. It is unlikely that any investigation 
of Conein could htdp but result in a larger exploration of 
other past and present narcotics efforts and it would 
inevitably have to enter into the tangled world of Wer 
Bell and Vesco. 
Moro than likely no one in the Ford administration 
even knew of Conein's presence at DEA ? or knew any-
thing about his activities ? until recently. By now it 
probably knows mere than it would prefer apparently 
enough to avoid opening this potential Pandora's box in 
the midst of an election year.

about corrupting or killing 'anyone 
who gets in the way of the traffick-
ers. It is no wonder that government 
narcotics officials so often turn for 
assistance to figures as loathsome as 
the trade itself. 
An argument can be made that no 
other kind of person can safely or 
effectively operate in such an envi-
ronment. But just as a man is af-
fected by the company he keeps, so 
too are drug officials and their pro-
grams twisted by the informants 
they employ. The story of Carlos 
Hernandez Rumbaut, one of Deacon' 
l's informants, shows how far just 
one such alliance can go. 
IKE MOST of the Cubans in Dea-
con 1, Carlos Hernandez had 
been at the Bay of Pigs. Apparently 
he first came to the attention of the 
old Bureau of Narcotics and Danger-
ous Drugs (BNDD) when he was ar-
rested in Mobile in 1969 with 467 
pounds of marijuana which he said 
be was going to sell in Miami. His. 
trial, scheduled for April, 1971, was 
postponed when the judge deter-
? mined that his mental state was dis-
turbed. 
? With this curriculum vitae the 
BNDD regional office at Miami saw 
fit the following month to enlist him 
as a "Class 1 cooperating individual." 
He provided some useful informa-
tion; in return, the bureau not only 
paid him $150 but attempted to in-
tercede on his behalf with the Ala-
bama authorities. Unmoved, they 
jailed him pending a new trial. 
BNDD was thus forced to put Her-
nandez on an "inactive cooperating 
individual status." 
. He was then convicted and sent-
enced to 15 years. Not even . this 
cooled the Miami office's ardor for 
Hernandez. He appealed but didn't 
have enough money to post his $25,-
000 bond. Deacon l's chief agent and 
Coneln's right-hand man on the pro-
ject solved the problem by arrang-
ing for one of Deacon l's informants, 
a CIA veteran and a successful Cu-
ban jeweler in Miami, to lend Her-
nandez $12,500. Ile assured the jew-
eler that DEA was in effect gua-
ranteeing the loam As soon as Her-
nandez was released from jail, the 
Miami office put him back on active 
status. 
At this point Hernandez had had 
enough of U.S. justice and fled to 
Costa Rica, where the government 
accorded his drug experience a very 
different recognition. Within weeks 
he was made an honorary member 
of the Costa Rican Narcotics Divi-
sion, then promoted to captain and 
second in command by order of then 
President Jose Figueres. Soon after, 
he becanae Figueres' bodyguard. 
All of this information comes from' 
Hernandez' confidential DEA file, 
which includes CIA reports on Her-
nandez' conduct as a Costa Rican 
narcotics officer. One of these iden-
tifies him and a relative of President 
Figueres as members of a death 
squad that executed at least one nar-
cotics trafficker in early 1973 and 
.had sworn to kill more (a solution to 
the drug problem eerily reminiscent 
of the reported assassination pro-
gram proposed by Conein for Mexi-
co). 
Hernandez' assassination effort as 
well as his other shady activities 
prompted U.S. Ambassador Viron P. 
Vaky to insist in May, 1973, that DEA. 
discontinue its relationship with its 
informant. But Hernandez was now, 
for all practical purposes, the Costa 
Rican narcotics division and the 
;DEA, loath to give up so strategically 
placed an asset, disregarded the am- , 
bassador's directive. In October, 
1973, the Alabama courts denied 
Hernandez' appeal. 
fi ERNANDEZ HAD no intention 
Ii of returning to the United 
States to go to jail. Even so, the mat-
ter might simply have faded away 
were it not for the understandable 
anger of the Deacon 1 informant 
who had guaranteed half of Hernan-
dez' bail. The jeweler, unwilling to 
forfeit his $12,500, demanded that 
Hernandez make good his loss, and 
threatened to track him to Costa 
Rica if he didn't. 
Hernandez, meanwhile, was still 
working with DEA, now in conjunc-
tion with its regional office in Mex-
ico City. He told the drug agency 
that the American government was 
"treacherous" and he threatened to 
"eliminate" anyone who attempted 
to come after him. The embassy in 
Costa Rica became underStandably 
nervous and asked DEA to resolve

the dispute quietly. A special agent 
?was dispatched to San Jose to soothe 
_Hernandez. In a conciliatory mood, 
Hernandez at least agreed not to 
? harm any American narcotics offi-
cial. 
The DEA's machinations to pro-
? tect Hernandez were now forced to 
widen. DEA's New Orleans regional 
? director was sent to persuade the at-
torney general of Alabama and the 
district attorney in Mobile to waive 
the appeal bond forfeiture. But the. 
director's efforts angered the local 
prosecutor, Randy Butler, who not 
only refused to cooperate but made 
Hernandez an issue in his campaign, 
and threatened to tell the world if 
DEA made any further attempt to. 
keep him out of jail. 
And so in late 1973 Carlos Hernan-
dez ? Bay of Pigs veteran, convicted 
drug smuggler, DEA informant, 
Costa Rican narcotics ace, private 
executioner and presidential body-
guard ? was preparing to become 
an international incident, ready to 
go off right in the middle of the 
post-Watergate furor, the moment 
the jeweler set foot in Costa Rica. 
There was no way to appeal to the 
Costa Rican government for help. 
There was an election coming up but 
Hernandez' position in the country's 
narcotics division was so strong that 
, no one felt he could be dislodged. 
Something had to be done quickly. 
Conein's supervisor, George Belk, 
decided to pay the jeweler $12,500 by 
dramatically increasing his monthly - 
cash payments as an informant over, 
the next year. 
It would appear to have been a 
dangerous risk for Belk to authorize 
the payments, since they indirectly 
assisted a fugitive from a drug case. 
But Belk, when contacted, said there 
was nothing wrong with this. "Her-
nandez was a source at the time." 
But he "didn't work for me, he was 
working for the Costa Ricans. The 
guy who was working for us, who 
had provided the bond money, was 
tile crux of the problem." 
Meanwhile, one senior DEA offi-

Cuba denies 
lie to death 
of Kennedy 
Miami (AP)?Cuba's Prime 
Minister Fidel Castro categori-
cally denies his governmen 
had anything to do with the as 
sassination of President John F 
Kennedy. 
But Mr. Castro has implied 
that he will reply in kind to fur-
ther terrorist attacks on Cuban 
property or diplomats overseas. 
In a speech reported over 
Havana radio yesterday, Mr.. 
Castro also said Cuban combat 
troops are being "gradually 
withdrawn" from Angola but 
that civilian personnel are 
being sent to the newly inde-
pendent African nation. 
Speaking in the context of 
terrorism and what he said 
were attempts to kill him and 
other Cuban leaders in the ear-
ly days of the Cuban revolution,, 
Mr. Castro said about the Ken-
nedy murder: 
"Some' imply that such an 
action could have been retalia-
tion by the Cuban revolution for 
the actions carried out against 
the lives of our leaders at that 
time. In truth, we reiterate that 
never has the Cuban revolution

1960s and early '70s. 
The A.C.L.U. said that Federal 
District Judge June Green, in 
an order dated June 11, had 
told George Bush, Director of; 
Central Intelligence, to protecti

Rowland Evans and Robert Novak 
, 
c,overo.. Operation 
That Failed.' 
House Speaker Carl Albert was made 
the agent of an undercover attempt by 
the Nixon administration in late 1971 to 
destroy the effectiveness of a Greek ex-
patriate whose lobbying against the 
military dictatorship in Athens inf uri-
ated the Nixon high command. 
This effort failed only because top of-
ficials in the State Department found 
out about it. They ordered withdrawal 
of a malicious, unsigned memorandum 
that had been sent to Albert and issued 
a private apology to the designated vic-
tim, Elias Demetracopoulos. The memo-
randum on plain white paper was 
drafted by State and Central Intellig-
ence Agency bureaucrats. 
The episode, reminiscent of other 
covert political operations in the 1971-
,1972 ;Nixon White House; can now be? 
brought to light because Albert has an-
nounced his decision not to run for re-
-election. Those involved refused to dis-
cuss the affair earlier because of possi-
ble reprisals from the office of the 
Speaker, the third highest government 
official. 
. The failed effort involved, directly or 
indirectly, White House legal counsel 
John Dean, U.S. Ambassador Henry 
Tasca in Athens, an implacable foe of 
Demetracopoulos, Nixon fund-raiser 
and confidant Thomas Pappas, a rich 
Greek-American with intimate ties to 
-the military junta and who was under 
attack by Demetracopoulos, and lesser 
figures. 
For the Nixon White House, it ended 
on Dec. 29, 1971, shortly after the mem-
Orandum was ordered withdrawn. On 
that day, a highly unusual, written ex-
planation of the aborted effort, said by 
White House operatives to have? been 
unsigned, was sent directly to Dean in 
the White House from the State Depart-
ment. It reviewed the campaign against. 
Demetracopoulos and stated that, no 
matter how controversial he was, no 
? case could be made against him. More-
over, it warned that the intended vic-
tim was considering a libel suit against 
the U.S. government .for the anony-
mous memorandum, which could 
prove extremely embarrassing. 
For Demetracopoulos, however, the 
affair did not end until he had -ex-
tracted a grudging letter from Albert 
fully seven months later. ,The Speaker 
told Demetracopoulos that "a routine 
inquiry (to the State Department) by a 
member of my staff" had triggered the 
-memorandum. Albert said his office 
had sought the background informa-
tion because Albert had been informed 
."you might be seeking an appointment 
at some future date." - ? . 
In fact, Demetracopoulos first met 
Albert in the mid-1950s. He had seen 
him many times between then and De-
cember 1971, and had brought high ex-
parliamentary leaders of Greece, ban-
ished from office during the junta's 
rule, to the Speaker's office to meet Al-
bert. 
Thus, Albert was the victim of a set-
up by the administration, which 
wanted the most prestigious congres-
sional figure possible to make the re-

Mr. Harvey, who was 60 
years old, was said to have

among 10 agents whose iden-

Senate Select Committee on In-

in 1975 of alleged assassination

William E. Colby, then Direc-

argued that disclosure of the 
names of agents would put. 
them in jeopardy of retaliation 
by "irrational groups." 
Mr. Harvey testified before 
the Senate committee that he 
had been told by superiors that 
the Castor assasination plot had

that he had discussed the ef-

quest for background information on 
Demetracopoulos. When he or his staff 
complied, the memorandum calculated 
to destroy the effectiveness of Deme-
tracopoulos was quickly sent to Capitol 
Hill. The clear purpose: to have it 
widely distributed, under the imprima-
tur of the Speaker. 
Two copies of the memorandum 
were taken to the House, one for Al-
bert, the other for the House Interna-
tional Relations Committee, which had 
not asked for it but where it was as-
sumed there would be widespread dis-
tribution. A committee staffer, shocked 
by the anonymous document, gave it 
only to Rep. Benjamin Rosenthal of 
New York, chairman of the European 
subcommittee. 
Similarly shocked, Rosenthal asked 
then Congressional Assistant Secretary 
of State David Abshire why the State 
Department would lend itself to anony-
mous charges against Demetracopoulos 
, that were probably libelous and circu-
late them on Capitol Hill. Abshire, 
caught unaware, discussed the matter 
with then Deputy Under Secretary of 
State William B. Macomber and they 
immediately ordered the two copies of 
the memorandum retrieved 
On Jan. 31, Abshire wrote Demetra-

official apology. The man who ran con-

, meat wrote that he had not "seen, ap-
proved or even heard of the paper 
prior to its very limited distribution" 
and that the department could not 
stand behind "a memorandum contain-
ing questionable material."

as a dangerous gadfly by Mr. Nixon's

Insurance Venture 
Of CIA Produced 
Awkward Situations 
0 0. 0 
New Light Shed on Problems, 
Including Rebuff to Bid for 
Acquisition. SEC Inquiry 
By DAVID IGNATIUS 
Staff ItCpOrteref THE WAt.1, STRRET JOURNAL 
, The Central Intelligence Agency got into 
the insurance business in 1962. Since then, 
the insurance business has got the CIA into 
some awkward predicaments. 
The agency's original idea in setting up a, 
complex of insurance companies was to pro-
vide a discreet means of paying retirement, 
disability and death benefits for double 
agents and other top-secret operatives who 
couldn't receive regular CIA benefits in the 
form of U.S. Treasury checks because of 
possible exposure. 
Lawrence rt. Houston, who helped create 
the insurance operation and who directed it 
until he retired as the agency's general 
counsel in 1973, said the CIA on several oc-
casions even had to rebuff, investors inter-
ested in acquiring what appeared to be a 
healthy insurance operation. Another time, 
"company" officials had to fend off a Secur-
ities and Exchange Commission insider-
trading inquiry that touched peripherally on 
one concern's purchases of a stock. Further 
complicating matters, these headaches had 
to be handled publicly by CIA employes who. 
were merely posing as executives and 
hadn't any independent authority even to 
sign checks. 
These glimpses inside the CIA's- insur-
ance complex, which eventually grew to sev-
eral companies,- emerged from an interview 
with Mr. Houston. While the existence of the 
$30 million CIA insurance complex was dis-
closed in an April report by the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee, Mr. Houston shed new 
light on the problems of managing the agen-
cy's conglomerate. 
Mr. Houston declined, however, to name 
specific companies in the CIA insurance 
complex, which he believes is serving a 
"perfectly legitimate and absolutely neces-
sary purpose." He expressed concern that 
publication of such specific information 
could result in exposure and "serious harm" 
for individuals who have received payments 
through the project. 
Two Existing "Shell" Companies 
The CIA decided to get into the insurance 
business after finding itself scurrying 
around in 1961 to hastily arrange payments 
to the families of four American pilots shot 
down over Cuba in the Bay of Pigs incident. 
The insurance complex was established the 
next year with help from friendly industry 
executives and lawyers, who apprised the 
CIA of two existing "shell" companies and 
offered advice on how to "flesh them nut," 
Mr. Houston recalled. 
While the CIA tries to write contracts 
with its covert operatives that specify regu-
lar employe contributions for pensions and 
insurance benefits, many of the payments 
by the insurance complex have taken a 
more irregular form, Mr. Houston said. For 
example, when an "uninsured" operative re-
tired or died, it was often necessary to back-
date elaborate phony benefit policies and 
.fund them with lump sums from the CIA. 
But it's clear that the role of the insur-
ance complex hasn't been limited to provid-
ing Insurance, The Senate Intelligence re-
port, while approving the general Intent of I 
the project, noted cryptically: "The com-
plex also provided a limited amount of sup-1

The CIA's 'Sex Squad' 
In contrast to the. haphazard sex on 
Capitol Hill, the? Central Intelligence 
Agency for years has conducted an 
elaborate and efficient sex operation. 
Few national secrets have been more 
carefully guarded, but the CIA has 
provided kings, presidents, potentates 
and magistrates with female compan-
sionship. On a lower level, women have 
been made available to defectors and 
CIA agents. 
Sometimes, the CIA's guests bring 
their own partners. More often, the 
agency selects the women from its vice 
files. The agency also provides "safe 
houses" where the liaisons can be con-
summated in protected privacy. 
The CIA's sex shop , according to 
knowledgeable sources, is run by the 
Office of Security. This division acts 
primarily as the CIA's internal police 
force. 
Through field offices scattered 
around the country, the Office of Secu-
rity maintains close ties with-state and 
local police.In each field office, a 
"black book" is kept -of the males and 
, females who can be safely recruited to 
? entertain the CIA's visitors. 
? The black books contain names, tele-
phone numbers and details, gleaned 
I largely from local vice squads. In Wash-
ington, for example, CIA agents paid 
regular visits to the police depart-
ment's vice squad to photograph docu-
ments. 
The late Deputy Chief Roy E. Buick, 
who headed the "sex squad" for years, 
kept exhaustive records on "perverts" 
and "miscreants" around the country. 
He had a close, backroom relationship 
with the CIA, say our sources. 
From 1964 to 1974 the sex operation 
was supervised by security director 
Harold Osborn. 
Each black book entry, according to 
sources with access to the files, con-
tains some fascinating vital statistics?
physical description, measurements, 
health status and sexual specialties. 
This information is used to find sex-
ual partners for princes and potentates, 
defectors and agents. The congres-
sional investigations of the CIA, howev-
er, skirted the sex operation. The 
Mr. Houston conceded that the insurance 1 
company has been used to channel money 
for covert operations, as a "sterilized fund-
ing". device to make the payments difficult 
to trace. (Most of the covert funding appar-
ently was carried on the books as invest-
ment.) But he denied that this was the real 
reason the complex was created. "If the 
complex later got into other agency pur-
poses," he said, "It was because it proved 
itself a useful instrument." He wouldn't 
elaborate. 
Recruited About 50 Buoinessmen 
To help build a cover for the insurance 
complex of foreign underwriting concerns, 
based in such places as Bermuda and the 
Cayman Islands, and domestic investment ; 
concerns, the CIA once recruited about 50 
businessmen and retired government and 
military employes as directors for the com-
panies, Mr. Houston said. They were paid 
$50 to $100 a board meeting, with a maxi-
mum of four meetings a year. Aware that 
they were working for the agency, the direc-
tors Would sometimes be asked to advise on 
investment portfolio decisions. But Mr. ; 
Houston said ha supervis.nd every detail of 
the operanon, including management of tho i

Housiintelligence committee stumbled 
on to the information that the CIA once 
provided an unidentified Middle East 
monarch with female companions. We 
have learned that the king was Jor-
dan's Hussein. 
It's the CIA's own foreign agents, 
coming in from "the cold," who make 
the most use of the "safe houses." 
When an undercover operative reports 
back to the United States, he is whisked 
to a "safe house" and a "case officer" is 
assigned to watch over him. 
The officer is supposed to keep his 
charge happy and to provide for his - 
needs. If the need should be sexual, the 
right contact in the Office of Security 
is called upon. 
The CIA uses sex for an even more 
seamy purpose. As we reported more 
than a year ago, the agency has used 
prostitutes to lure foreign diplomats 
into love traps where their sexual an-
tics were filmed through one-way mir-
rors. The film was later used to black-
mail the foreigners into becoming in-
formants. 
In New York, the CIA maintained ad-
joining efficiency apartments on the 
sixth floor of a high-rise in Greenwich 
Village. On the wall of the blackmail 
apartment was a large painting of two 
ships. The painting was actually a one-
way mirror. 
On the other side of the wail, CIA 
agents could watch the action through 
the see-through painting and film inti- _ 
mate moments. A Japanese screen, im-
planted with microphones, provided 
sound for the blackmail movies. 
In San Francisco, the CIA operated a 
similar apartment equipped with bug-
ging devices, but no observation mir-
rors. The New York apartment was ? 
used from about 1960 to 1966; the San 
Francisco apartment from the late 
1950s to about 1965. 
ll'ooinote: We confronted Osborn 
with the facts about the sex operation. 
He denied that any such operation was 
conducted "during my tenure." A CIA 
spokesman had no comment. Our calls 
to the Washington police and the Jor-

panies as normally as possible. This meant, 
among other things, "laying off" some of its 
policies to regular commercial insurance 
concerns in so-called reinsurance transac-
tions. Mr. Houston, however, would quietly 
notify the chief executives of these compa-
nies that they were actually buying spook in-
surance. The CIA companies also reinsured 
policies from the commercial concerns, 
again to maintain appearance of normality. 
Sometimes: however, the profit-making, 
business-as-usual cover proved to be an em? 
-
barrassingly successful decoy. On several 
occasions, investors approached CIA em-
ployes who nominally headed companies in 
the Insurance complex and suggested that 
the units looked like good acquisition possi-
bilities. We simply never let it come to the 
point of negotiation," Mr. Houston observed.

"CIA Goal: Drug, Not Kill, Ander-

seems to imply that someone was. 
actually thinking about doing away

where in the story is this suggested. 
Second, the headline indicates there 
was a "goal" to drug Mr. Anderson, 
whereas the story merely says 
there "was discussion" about it. 
And finally, nowhere in the story 
is there any allegation of CIA in-

to two "former" CIA employees

CIA Director George Bush Friday 
' challenged presumptions the nation lacks 
confidence in his agency, and he vowed to 
continue cooperating with congressional 
groups looking into CIA operations. 
"I'm not sure how much confidence is 
lacking," he told reporters at a news con-
ference at the Rice-Rittenhouse Hotel. 
"Some things have been wrong.. . but 
the abuses of the past are in the past." 
Bush added: "I think the American 
people support the concept of a strong 
intelligence agency. If they.don't, they'd 
better." 
He acknowledged the CIA's image "is 
not what it should be," but he said putting 
"a PR (public relations) gloss" on the . 
agency would not be appropriate. 
Bush said he hopes negative publicity 
swirling about the CIA will not mean a 
lower agency budget this year: 
"I hope Congress will support the budg-
et levels suggested by the President. . . I 
don't see any widespread effort to cut it." 
The CIA's new director also said the 
spy agency can continue to do its job by 
using new measures aimed at increasing 
outside oversight of its operations. 
"We should disclose and disclose fully 
to Congress," he added, "but Congress will 
have to protect (secrets)."

Bush is making his first visit to bus-

envoy. He addressed the annual meeting 
oi the YMCA of Greater Houston at a 
Friday night banquet at the hotel. 
Explaining at the outset to reporters 
that he would not comment on political 
matters or on sepsitive intelligence issues. 
Bush declined to comment on only a 
handful of questions. 
But he did note U.S. relations with Red 
China are not likely to change in view of 
Continuing political turmoil there. And he, 
also commented that the CIA. and the 
federal government generally, did not 
know Cuba's intentions in Africa before 
the outbreak of the Angolan war. 
"We're still unclear what (Cuba) in-
tends to do," he said. "It's very hard to 
predict." . 
Bush would not discuss prospects his 
Own job as CIA director?a Presidential

CONSTITUTION, Atlanta 
11. June 1976 
'By PAUL LIEBERMAN . 
With almost three decades 
as an official of the Central 
Intelligence Agency behind 
him, John M. Maury has de-
veloped a favorite saying to 
defend some of the agency's 
controversial practices. 
"I think the President of 
the United States ought to 
)have some options between 
sending a diplomatic note and 
sending in the Marines," 
Maury says. 
The -man who supervised 
this country's spy activities in 
both the Soviet Union and the 
Middle East adds that the "vi-
able options" should include 
"political manipulation that is 
supporting a friendly faction; 
. . . propaganda where the 
source is concealed; and per-
haps supporting one military 
faction against another 
Maury worked for the CIA 
from 1946 to 1974. He was 
chief of the agency's Soviet 
Russia Division during many 
of the peak Cold War years, 
from 1954 to 1962. He was 
Chief 
chief of the CIA station in 
Athens from 1962 to 1963. 
For the last two years, until 
he resigned in March, Maury 
was assistant secretary of de-
fense, first under President. 
Nixon, then President Ford. It 
was on behalf of the Defense 
department that Maury was 
in Atlanta this Week, address-
ing a foreign policy forum for 
members of the Georgia 
General Assembly arranged 
? by U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn. 
In an interview after the 
legislative forum MondaY, 
Maury said he thought recent 
congressional investigations of 
the CIA's so-called "covert" 
operations were called for, 
but argued that the CIA itself 
had received unfair criticism. 
"I think sorve,of the covert 
operations we.e a big mis-
take," the former CIA official 
said, mentioning as examples 
the Bay of Pigs invasion of 
Cuba and the secret war in 
Laos. But Maury said many 
covert operations have not 
been the CIA's idea. .

This involves keeping track 
of foreign crisis areas such as 
world grain trends and OPEC 
investments, both of which 
would have an impact on U.S. 
security, he said. 
For most of ,the 29-year his-
tory of the CIA, Intelligence 
efforts have beeh focused on 
Russia, Which is the only' 
country which could physical-

the CIA has been taking a

"Virtually every objectionable 
activity was ordered by the 
president or by the assistant 
for national security affairs." 
Maury said critics thus 
have been wrong to describe 
the CIA as a "rogue ele-
phant." . 
"In fact, it had has been 
highly responsive," he said. 
Maury Said elimination of 
abuses in U.S. intelligence 
operations should not come 
through a ban on covert 
operations. "The answer is not 
to elect a fool ,or a scoundrel 
president," he said. 
Maury characterized Presi-
dent Nixon as an example of 
a "scoundrel,? but said he 
thought most of the leading 
presidential contenders this 
year seem "decent" and "con-
siderably better than" four 
years ago. . 
The former CIA and De-

the civil war in Angola was a

was a . "legitimate national 
interest" in trying to stem 
Soviet influence. Maury said 
we might want to excercise 
our influence there by "nonat-
tributable means." 
Maury said the provision of 
military or financial aid to an 
anti-Soviet faction was a le-
gitimate covert activity in 
that case. He also defended 
the use in some situations of 
reporters as agents. "I don't 
think either of us is compro-
mised if a newspaper man 
shares information," he said. . 
Maury said he knew of 
about a half-dozen cases 
where newsmen were paid for 
information. Usually. he said, 
the newsmen merely did "pas-
sive observation" such as 
evaluating possible targets for 
recruitment as agents. 
"This never gave me any 
qualms of conscience, because 
never .to my knowledge 
we try to influence what went 
into their own news reports," 
Maury said.

WASHINGTON, June 23 (AP) ' 
?The Senate Select Committee

proved today the nomination of, 
E. Henry Knoche to be deputy 
director of the Central Intelli-

Mr. Knoche, 51 years old,'

The committee was formed;

bers of the panel were to be '

Mr. Knoche, who will bead

The chagrin that g

factors. One, that certain newspaper and

business felt, particularly, that while

might ultimately wind up in CIA or Na-

believe for a minute that there were 
newsmen reporting surreptitiously to the 
CIA. Such a link is completely inconsis-
tent with the newsman's job of reporting 
information to the public. 
The- revelation that some. newsmen ? 
however few ? have been on the CIA 
payroll has done untold damage to the po-
sition of trust and credibility that a re-

REGISTER, Des Moines 
7 May 1976 
- The Central Intelligence Agency has committed the 
.big mistake of not making itself understood by the 
American public, William E. Colby, former director of 
the CIA, said here. 
"We need a better way of informing the American 
people of intelligence operations," Colby told a lunch-
eon gathering of the Illinois Bankers Convention at 
Stouffer's Riverfront Towers Tuesday. 
"WE NEED TO share the substantive information, 
but we also need to keep our secret sources, just like 
newspaper reporters. 
"Then there won't be a' surprise when a-story is 
leaked." 
Colby, head of the CIA from 1973 until last January, 
also said the American public has an incorrect image of 
the CIA. 
The old image, he' said, is one? "of spies in tbe 
shadows stealing secret documents. Or stereotype of 
James Bond . . ." 
Colby said intelligence operations have undergone a 
drastic change since World War II. 
"TECHNOLOGY has revolutionized intelligence work 
. . . electronics, photography, computers . . . 
"We now know how many Russian missiles there are. 
There's no debate over the gap." 
Colby pointed to the armed might of the Soviet Union 
in supporting., his contention that a strong U.S. 
intelligence operation is needed. 
"Concerning the importance of the CIA, you have to 
look at-the past and .the future. Fifteen years ago, the 
Soviet Union was vastly inferior (to. the United States). 
But look at them now. 
"AND IN THE FUTURE, several questions arise.

What is Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) covert action? 
It is diplomacy and warfare by 
other means, clandestine efforts to? 
governments or -persons 
to support U.S? objectives, activity 
ranging from propaganda to para-, 
military operations to assassina-
tion-plotting. 
, It is a foreign policy tool too 
often used by presidents. to avoid 
policy, debate. It is the task 
_assigned to the president's "private 
army" to circumvent the. ordinary 
processes of governmental checks 
and balances. 
: It is a function of the CIA which 
requires the retention ot unknown 
numbers of ..standby "assets" 
(agents, journalists, guerrillas) ? 
the so-called worldwide 'infras-
tructure" that-made possible thou-
sands of covert actions in the past 
and will allow for more in the 
future. ? 
It is intervention in the internal 
, affairs of other governments, just: 
one "plausible -denial" step away 
: from violation of international, 
,treaties and conventions. 
It is something most members of 
Congress do not want to know 
- about.. 
The Senate Intelligence Commit-
tee seeks to restrict the future use 
of covert action by itcreasing con-
gressional oversight. The commit-
tee in its .final report calls for the 
establishment of a new intelligence 
oversight committee (or commit-
tees) which would have power to 
approve and disclose the CIA budg-
, 
eCand which. would require prier 
notification by the CIA of covert 
action. ? ? 
The committee's proposal for 
strong' oversight now is being 
attacked and emasculated in the 
Senate., Many of. the .critics are 
members of committees which per-
formed so poorly as CIA watchdogs 
in the past. These .members reject 
the idea of prior notification, of 
budgetary authority, of public dis-
closure of CIA activity ? of over-
sight. - ? 
The purpose of the year-and- a-
half investigation by- the Senate 
and House Intelligence Committees 
was to show how the CIA and other 
intelligence agencies could be 
reined in, not to prove Congress 
unequal to the task. 
CIA covert action creates a 
dilemma for- our democratic sys-
tem:for if a policy is right, why 
should it -not be acted out in the 
open? The Intelligence'Committee 
hopes to eliminate some of the 
more ominous aspects of the dilem-
ma by proposing a ban against 
assassination, subversion of demo-
cratic-governments and support of 
repressive internal security forces 
by the-CIA. It does not reject any of 
the other -reprehensible covert 
?activity, most particularly parami-
litary operations, but evidently 
hopes strong oversight will discour-
age or thwart such activity. 
-If effective oversight cannet be 
achieved, then there is no place in 
our system for covert action and 
all such activity should be banned.

Nixon's Aides Held 
To Have Weighed 
Drugging Columnist 
? WASHINGTON, June 8(UPI) 
?The Nixon White House was 
considering a plan in March 
1972, to discredit Jack Ander-
son, the columnist, by drugging 
him so he would appear in-
coherent in a public appea-
rance, a Senate committee re-
ported today. 
E.. Howard Hunt, subsequent-
ly convicted for the Watergate 
break-in, lunched with a retired 
Cintral Intelligence Agency 
physician at a Washington res-
taurant a stones throw from 
the White House in hopes of 
obtaining a hallucinogenic drug 
for the project. 
Details of the plan to discre-
dit Mr. Anderson, who aroused 
the Nixon Administration's ire 
by publishing secret White 
House transcripts revealing Mr. 
Nixon's "tilt" in favor of Pakis-
tan in the war between India 
and Pakistan involving Ban-
gladesh in 1971, were published 
by the Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence in a special sup-
plement to its final report. 
The drugging project was 
dropped after it was deter-
mined to be impracticable. 
The intelligence committee, 
however, said it "has found no 
evidence" to support Washing-
ton Post report by Bob Wood-
ard, Sept, 21, 1975, that the 
Nixon White House had at-
tempted to assassinate Mr. An-
derson. 
"However," the report said 
a White house 'effort was made 
in consultation with a former 
C.I.A. physician to explore 
mean:: of drurehtg Anderson to 
discredit him by rendering him 
incoherent before a public ap-
pearance. 
"This effort apparently never 
proceeded beyond the planning 
stage." Approved

large number of appearances when

sOmethjng as important as the intelli-
'gence community." 
?Bush said that he is. "nor overly opti-
ng' stic that the creation of the new 
:committee will cut down on the num-
bers of visits to the hill that the direc-
tor Of central intelligence must make."-
Bush said that he will work closely

tunity to get his staff organized Bush

"If I answered every outlandish,

nied any CIA connections,? are

? they had better not risk offend-

Were made in retaliation for a 
. recent Jack -Anderson column 
which said two Soviet newsmen 
in Washington are agents for a 
Soviet, spy agency. And it would 
. appear that the journalist might 
be right. 
A spokesman for The ,Associ-
ated Press in New York put the 
situation into some perspective. 
when he.explained the details of 
the charge against Associated 
Press Correspondent George A. 
Krimsky. The publication ? had 
accused Krimsky, of recruiting a 
young Soviet citizen to work for 
the official Russian news agency 
Tass, then of receiving unau-
thorized "special material" from 
that agency With the. employe's 
help. . 
The AP termed the charge "a 
complete fabrication," pointing 
out it would be "ridiculous to 
assume that Krimsky or any 
American correspondent would 
have the slightest influence on 
who might or .might not work 
for Tass." ? 
? And, indeed,, it would. 
The spokesman probably put ? 
his finger on the real issue when 
he pointed out that allthree cor-
respondents are fluent in Rus-
sian, are able to talk directly 
with Russian people, and have 
.been. in *contact with political 
dissidents in Moscow. 
"Soviet magazines and news-
papers have trumped up charges 
in the past against foreign corre- ? 
spondents :in Moscow who have 
been able; through their knowl-
edge.of languages; to deal direct-
ly with the Russian people, 
particularly dissidents," he said. 
"They hope in.this way to intim-
idate the correspondents and cut 
off news sources with the Soviet 
People." ? ? ? ? 
The Americans have been

he their expulsion. It will be in-

The LLSiQ on Trial 
ve 
When the International Labor .Organization marked 
its fiftieth anniversary in 1969, its distinguished con-
tributions to improving the lot of the world's workers 
and their families were recognized by award of the 
Nobel Peace Prize. Less than a decade later ideological 
polarization within the world labor body has become 
so intense that its survival as a socially effective 
organization is in doubt. 
Whether it still has a useful role to play is being 
tested in the World Employment Conference, now in 
session in Geneva. Delegates from 132 rich and poor 
countries are addressing themselves to easing the 
insecurity and poverty that degrade life for a billion 
people, the vast bulk of them in the developing 
countries. If the final product is a collection of pieties 
aimed at papering over the substantial differences in 
approach among the market economies of the West, 
the Soviet bloc and the third world, the conference - 
will do little to shore up confidence in the I.L.O.'s con-
tinued worth. It will do even less if the attempt at 
-consensus collapses and the conference winds up in 
another round of recriminations. ' , 
The questions at issue go far beyond a rerun of the 
battle over seating the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
tion, which monopolized the delegates' attention at ' 
the start. The disappointing aspect of that episode was 
not the mechanical majority that made a P.L.O. victory 
so predictable but the evidence it provided that the - 
third-world countries ? remain' more preoccupied with' 
bloc politics than with concentrating on realistic solu-
tions to problems that bear with special urgency on their 
millions of unemployed and underemployed people. 
? The United States has been incontestably right in 
leading the opposition to efforts at politicizing the I.L.O. 
The whole point of Washington's threat to pull out of 
the organization next year is to engender reforms that 
would return it to its past course of constructive 
accomplishment. Unfortunately, what is still lacking is' 
any 
any evidence that this country has a positive program 
of even modest creativity to put before the employment 
conference?one that would supply proof the United ? 
States is in Geneva for some purpose other, than to 
say "no." 
It is scarcely enough for the American delegation in 
Geneva to devote its energies to ridiculous position 
papers by the I.L.O. staff, which question the "trickle 
down" benefits to the poorer countries of economic 
growth based on computerized technology and the 
spread of multinational corporations. Instead of merely 
rejecting all third-world proposals for some intermediate 
technology adapted to the needs of n.tarl populations 
with neither skills nor schooling, the United States should 
Offer initiatives comparable in imagination to those 
rAveziced by Secretary of State Kissinger at the United 
NaCicee Inst year and in Nairobi last month. 
The eneewer to polarization in the I.L.O. or any other 
Leiternational agency does not lie in rigidities on the 
part of this Government almost as iron-corseted as those 
that control the spokesmen for the Communist countries, 
all of wheen parade to the conference podium with 
ritualistic testimonials to their success in guaranteeing 
full employment by decree. 
Lure Cleaver 
S,iy,s of 
/mite 
By -George W. Cornell 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK?From what 
he says, he's a changed 
man. 
Eldridge Cleaver, once a 
Marxist, a justifier of vio-
lence, now condemns both. ? 
Once a supporter of the 
Arab world against Israel, . 
he now calls the Arabs fla-
grant racists, defends Israel 
and extolls the long Jewish 
struggle for racial justice. 
"I've developed," he says. 
.matured." ? 
In a three-hour taped in-
terview in the Alameda 
County jail in Oakland, Cal-
if., with two Reform Jewish 
leadtrs, and in letters to 
them, Cleaver said his ideo-
logical:. transformation re-
sulted from experience with 
? communism in Cuba and 
, elsewhere and from living 
in the Arab world. 
"Disillusioning," he called 
it repeatedly. 
The former Black Panther - 
leader, who returned to the 
United States voluntarily ? 
last fall from Algeria after 
seven years in exile to face 
charges of attempted mur-
der in a 1968 shootout with 
? Police, has now become a 
Christian, according to ? the. 
prison chaplain. 
Cleaver said Marxist and 
Arab' societieshe previously 
? had praised in theory were 
in actual practice harsh, 
manipulative and repressive. 
"I didn't.; dig it," he said. 
"There was no possibilityr of 
me relating to it." 
He said returning to 
America was difficult be-
cause he realized his neW 
outlook "would wreak havoc 
among my old 'nevi left' 
friends and among a formid-
; able array of blacks who are 
.imbued with a knee-jerk, 
Third World, skin-game ide-
ology," but that his changed 
views were firm and wrought 
of "hard experience." ? 
"On many points, the pro-
gressive movement in the 
United States is all wet, 
misdirected," he said. "The 
? whole idea of settling polit-
ical problems and arguments 
by terrorist activities ... it's 
something that needs to be 
very seriously and actively 
combated. 
"l'in 40 years old, I want 
to contribute to stability 
and I think I'm ready to do 
that now." 
Cleaver, whose ' ho ok, 
"Sold on Ice," made him the 
darling of revolutionaries of 
the 1960s, first indicated his 
changed outlook, after his 
return, in a Boston Herald-
American article in which 
he condemned "communist 
dictatorships" and "black 
African dictatorships." 
He denounced the United 
Nations resolution equating 
Zionism with racism as a 
"travesty of the truth," say-
ing "Jews have done more , 
than any other people to ex-
pose and condemn racism" 
and that Arab Countries are 
"among the most racist on ? 
earth." 
In his jail interview with 
Albert Morspan of New 
York; vice president of the 
Union of Hebrew Congrega-
tions, and its Los Angeles 
regional director, Rabbi Er-
win Herman, Cleaver said 
that in Algeria and other 
Moslem Arab countries, he 
found racial attitudes "more 
cruel" than in America; and . 
far behind in ideas of jus-
tice: 
"It was just amazing that 
such things exist?like, for 
instance, slavery," he said. 
. "I saw slaves in Algesia. 
? They have slaves in Mauri-
tania. They have slaves in 
al those countries." 
Earlier in Cuba, he said, 
'I found a kind of racist gov-
ernment that was frankly 
hostile . . I quickly came 
into all kinds of conflicts 
with them. The reality was 
much different than I had 
projected . ? They began to 
accuse me of attending sec-
ret black power meetings 
. . . I left Cuba completely 
disillusioned with Cuban 
communism." 
In regard to the Arab-Is-
raeli conflict in the Middle 
East, he said after the Ar-
abs began using "oil as a 
weapon," he detected a shift 
in American policy toward 
Israel. "One could foresee if 
that trend continued, the 
American government was 
capable of sacrificing Is-
rael." 
He said he. is now firmly 
committed to Israel's "exist-
ence and Integrity."

Irrelevant Communists 
By Henrys. Bradsher 
Washington Star Staff Writer 
In a study written before 
the murder of two U.S. 
Embassy officials in Leba-
non, a CIA analyst says the? 
impact of international ter-
rorism is likely to be more 
sharply felt by the United 
States in the next few 
years. 
There is "good reason to 
believe that at least a few 
foreign terrorist groups are 
planning to step up their at-
tacks on American targets 
abroad in the near future," 
the study says. "No matter 
how tough and well publi-
cized a 'no concessions' 
policy the U.S. government 
maintains, it seems likely 
that Washington will be 
targeted by terrorist de-
mands somewhat more fre-
quently in the future. . . ." 
The study warns that 
"sooner or later some (ter-
rorist) group is bound to 
take the plunge" into using 
. weapons of mass destruc-
tion. 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
are difficult to acquire and 
handle, but terrorists might 
- seize a nuclear weapons' 
storage facility or a nuclear 
power plant and threaten 
radiological pollution to get 
publicity and back up their 
? demands, the study sug-
gests. 
"A more pressing threat, 
however," it continues, 
"would seem to lie in the - 
field of chemical, biological 
and radiological agents." 
They are relatively easy to 
acquire, so "the danger, 
that they could turn up in 
the hands of the sort of . 
ultra-radical or psycho-
pathic fringe group that 
would have the fewest com-
punctions about actually 
using them is very real." 
The study was written by 
David L. Milbank of the 
CIA's office of political re-
? search. A foreword to the

the party's presidential candidate 
the Second time the got 23,343 votes 
1972?.03 per cent of the vote), h 
launched his campaign with a stirri 
defense of detente. 
Notice of this event appeared deep 
The New York Times, next to a sto 
with an overshadowing headline: 
Hair Stylist Tops Field 
In Annual Fiddle Contest 
I ask you: Is that any way to report 
the vanguard of the proletariat, chee 
by-jowl with a fiddle contest? Well, a 
?tually, yes. When I called Manhattan i 
formation for the number of t 
CPUSA, the operator, who surely is o 
of the toiling masses, responded with 
Fuestien: "Is that 'Communist' with oi 
m' or two?" Her question illustrate 
the futility of both New York's ethic
Hanel system and the CPUSA. 
? 
The CPUSA has been relegated t 
what Communists call "the adustbin o 
history." But as recently as the earl 
1950s it received public attention out 9 
all proportion to its importance, just a 
the John Birch Society did in the earl 
1960s. Both were examples of the spe 
ters a bored society invents for its ow 
titillation. 
The CPUSA's last chance to becom 
consequential was in 1948 when man 
.of its agents and sympathizers pen 
trated the Progressive Party presiden 
tial candidacy of Henry Wallace who 
poor dear, was the last to know. If Corn 
munists had been successful. throve 
ard What Madame de Steel said of Ger. 
re- mans always has been true of Ameri-
nd. can Communists: They are "vigorously 
for obedient" to every exigency of Soviet 
in foreign policy. Thus The New York 
as Times noted with nice dryness that 
ng .Hall's remarks about._ detentee."paral-
lelled" recent Soviet press attacks on 
in U.S. critics of detente. 
ry Actually, one can almost admire the 
energy the CPUSA has invested over 
the years in rising above self-respect in 
the name of obedience. The Moscow 
on trials (which prompted Alger Hiss' ad-
k-?  miring statement "Joe Stalin certainly 
C- plays for keeps"), Soviet duplicity dure 
n- lug the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet al-
he Hance with Hitler, the partition of Po-
ne - land, the attack on Finland?all of 
a these drew CPUSA applause. 
le Lillian Hellman's anti-Nazi drama 
d "Watch on the Rhine" was attacked by 
a- party critics in 1940 and praised by 
them in 1942. This revolution in es-
o thetic standards was brought about at 
f. ? dawn, June 22, 1941, when Germany at-
y tacked Russia. . ? ' 
I There are scores of reasons why the 
S CPUSA is today and always has been a 
y Potemkin Village, an empty, cardboard 
C- party. But not the least of the reasons is 
n ? the CPUSA's marvelous ability to evoke 
' laughter, as when a prominent member 
e' announced that he had "unmasked the 
hiII
 
m, in in denying Truman the presidescy, then it might have been possible to 
" take them seriously. But with Commun 
1st help Wallace managed to finish 
fourth, behind Strom 'Thurmond's Dix 
iecrat candidacy. 
It is not the least of the ironies of the 
CPUSA's history that it became some-
thing of a national obsession for a few 
years after 1943, after it had conclu-
sively demonstrated its impotence. 
American Communists have always 
? been demoralized by the knowledge 
that they lack courage proportional to 
desire, and that not even their desire 
matches their imported rhetoric. To-
day's Communists know they are like 
the Viennese Communists whhse as-
sault on city hall was halted by a sign 
that ordered "Keep off the grass." 
open Trotskyism" of a rival faction. 
General Secretary Hall, who presum-
ably will rule Soviet America after the 
revolution, is an Ohioan, a bureaucrat 
lacking only a state. He and fellow op-
eratives are gray reminders of what 
- Thomas the Cynic says in Ignazio Sil-
, one's "School for Dictators": "No dicta-
tom' has ever had trouble finding civil 
servants." 
? But were it not already as petrified as 
a dinosaur's skeleton, we would want to 
embalm the CPUSA, the better to pre-
serve it as a monument to the leftism of 
irrelevance, and to that wit who coined 
a slogan appropriate for a CPUSA fac-
tional fight involving Jay Lovestone:

The Soviet Union has 
charged that the commis-

Department rejected the 
charge. 
Congress voted last 
month to create a joint

mission to monitor the way 
provisions of the Helsinki 
agreement are carried out 
by European Communist 
countries. The Helsinki 
agreement, signed by 
President Ford, Soviet

Soviet /ambassador 
Anatoly F. Dobrynin com-
plained Thursday to the as-
sistant secretary of state 
for European affairs, Ar-
thur A. Hartman, about the 
commission. 
According to a broadcast 
in Russian from Moscow, 
Dobrynin contended that 
the United States is trying 
"to assume the right, arbi-
trarily and unilaterally, to 
interpret" the agreement 
and judge whether other 
countries have fulfilled its 
provisions. 
SAID that the 
U.S. commission "contra-
dicts the principle of non-

that "we certainly reject 
? that." 
The Ford administration 
initially was unenthusiastic 
about the commission, feel-
ing it duplicated State e-
partrnent monitoring. 
Opposing it would have left 
the administration open to 
political attacks, however,

come the responsibility of the International Atomic 
.Energy Agency; but the IAEA's safeguards are in fact 
less stringent than these the t..1;S. can impose. in this 
:case, the NRC majority decided that the IAEA's "total 
:safeguards framework" (the accounting and inspec-

:adequate. Mr. Gitiritizy, focusing on the procedures

Now, none of the NRC.members can be said to be

Peter Ramsbotham 
Thoughtful Dissent: A Cornerstone 
Democracy 
; of Maryland by Sir Peter Ramsbotham, the British 
- From a commencement address at the University art 
: -ambassador  to the United States: 
? Our world today is disturbingly familiar, with loy-
alty oaths and guerrilla wars, with charges and count-
er-charges of treason and loyalty, spies and counter- ' 
spies. The United States has again, in recent years, 
faced the question of whether it is a punishable of-
fense for the individual to follow the dictates of his 
- conscience rather than the requirements of his gov-
ernment. The debate is a sharper one here than in my _ 
_ country: The 'British are an older, more tightly-knit ; 
- society, whose strength as a nation has been tested 
, from outside more often, century for century, than" 
the United States. The story of your birth as a nation, , 
and of the opening up of your vast continent, has illu-
minated more dramatically the qualities of determi-
nation, inventiveness and vigor inherent in the Amer-
ican character, which accentuate the strength of will 
of the individual. 
'? Two hundred years ago, the signatories to the Dec-
laration of Independence held certain truths to be 
self-evident. But behind that statement lay an as-
sumption that every American was capable .of per-
ceiving these truths for himself; that each of them 
bore a certain responsibility, as an individual, for a 
H continuous relationship with his government. What 
could not be deduced from the statement of princi-
ples in the Declaration was that there were specific 
political consequences that followed. It turned out 
that different individuals did have different moral 
? apprehensions; and some of these apprehensions 
were wide enough apart to allow for almost directly 
opposite interpretations of the obligations of the colo-
nists in the dilemma they faced. 
Widely varying opinions about the obligations of 
' the citizen are no less a modern phenomenon; indeed, 
no democracy is fully alive without such a debate. It , 
is a question of the degree to which dissent is taken 
and the country's need for unity at the time. The par- . 
; 
ailels between Britain's war with the colonies in the 
1770s and the American war in Vietnam in this last 
decade have been pointed out by modern historians. 
, Both wars raised painful questions of judgment and 
balance, of courage and loyalty. There is a time when 
, dissent and pacifism are intolerable, when a nation is 
fighting for its life. To encourage disunity in such cir-
cumstances can be treason. But there are other times 
when it is possible to afford the luxury of debate and 
disagreement. 
? What, then, is the criterion by which we should 
_ judge the behavior of the dissenter? By the fervor of 
his convictions? By the firmness of his courage? By 
.the worth of the proposed alternative? 
? We are reaching out here to the extreme point of 
. perspective, where a people can effectively pass judg-
ment on themselves. But it is well to remind ourselves 
that the relationship between authority and those dis-
senting from it may, at a time of crisis, be a decisive. 
factor in the survival of the community. . 
Philosophers and historians have pondered over 
these problems for millania, and there is little I can 
add. But I would leave one thought in the minds of ? 
the young people here today?as an injunction to any 
would-be dissenters: that dissent (if you feel you must 
dissenashould be a contribution to, not a subtraction 
from, the strength of your society. There should be a 
; firm element of thought and courage in the founda-
- 'lions of your action. Democracy rests on debate, not 
I-, on mindless opposition. In order to preserve the free-
doms that we have, there are freedoms which we do 
not have, which we must deny ourselves; the free-
Aom, for instance, to escape from the interest which 
society (any society) has in you, as an individual and 
t. as a contributor. 
If your argument measures up to the most strin-
gent, test you can subject it to, in its relationship to 
the truth and to the needs of your country, then foi-
1,: . low it with all the courage at your command.

? Your notions and mine about 
many events and facts are based 
? on dissimilar life experience, and 
therefore may differ considerab-
- ly. Yet the very angle between 
" beams of sight may help us to 
perceive a subject in fuller 
dimensions. I make bold to direct 
? your attention to some aspects of 
freedom that are not fashionable 
to talk about, but which will not 
on that account cease to exist, to 
have significance, ? 
The concept of freedom cannot 
be grasped correctly without an 
appreciation of the .vital objec-
'tives of our earthly existence. I 
am an advocate of the view that 
the aim of life for each of us is 
? 
not to take boundless pleasure in 
material goods, but to take our 
departure from the world as het-
i"- ter persons than we arrived at it, 
better than our inherited in-
stincts would have made us; that 
is, to travel over the span of life 
on one path or another of spiri-
tual improvement. (It is only the 
sum of ' such progressions that 
can be called the spiritual pro-
gress of humanity.) . 
If this is so, then external free-
dom is not a-self-sufficient end of 
people and of societies, but only ' 
means facilitating our unde-
formed development; only a pos-
sibility for us to live a human and 
not an animal existence; only a 
condition in which man may bet-
ter carry out his assignment on 
earth. And freedom is not the ' 
only such condition. No -less than 
outer freedom, man needs unpol-
luted space for his spirit, room 
for mental and moral concentra- ? 
, tion. 
Regrettably; contemporary ci-
vilized freedom is reluctant to 
leave us this kind of space. Reg,. 
rettably, in recent decades :our 
Exiled Russian writer Alexan-
der Sok:henitsun is doing research ? 
at the Hoover Institution in Stan-

, upon receiving .the. American 
Friendship Athard from the Free-

. very idea of freedom has been di-

ple We see that the sum total of

man and of society. It is merely 
potentiality being realized in dif-
ferent forms: All of this is a sub-

freedom which may actually be

Genuinely human freedom is. 
inner freedom, given to us by 
? God: freedom to decide upon our

sponsibility for them. And he 
who truly understands freedom is

ploit his legal rights for mercena-
ry advantage, but one who has a 
conscience to constrain him even in 
the face of legal justification. 
think it will not be too much for 
us to acknowledge that in some re?
nowned countries of the Western 
world in the 20th century, freedom 
, has been degraded in the name of 
"development" from its original soar-
ing forms; that in not one country of

in maneuvering between articles of

Frustration is growing 
among Russian emigres in the 
United States about the' diffi-

here. And the irony is that 
just as Soviet dissidents turn 
to the foreign press to air 
their troubles in Moscow, so 
they are tending to do the

bad tried to attract the atten-
tion of the New York papers, 
' they said, even going to the 
'length of parading with ban-

ignored, . , . . 
They complained bitterly 
that groups which hold huge 
demonstrations in favour of 
Soviet Jews and their right to 
emigrate, take no interest in 
the emigres when they finally 
arrive in the United States. 
This also applied to politicians 
who talked a lot about helping 
Russian Jews ter emigrate. _

FOR CURB ON FOES 
Strive to Win Cooperation 
of Police Abroad After 
New Acts of Violence 
By MALCOLM W. BROWNE. 
Special to The New York Matta 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, June 
18?A bomb explosion at tha. 
Yugoslav Embassy in Washing, 
ton last week has prompted 
a new diplomatic drive by Yu-
goslavia to engage the coopera-
tion of foreign police forces 
against opponents of the Bel-
grade Government 
Already, Belgrade's initiatives 
have borne fruit in West Germa-
ny, where close to a million Yu-
goslays live as migrant workers. 
The West German Government 
has informed Yugoslavia that 
it has formally banned two Yu-
goslav organizations linked 
with terrorist activity in West 
Germany, and has seized quan-
tities of arms from members in 
a series of nationwide raids. 
But discussions between the 
United States and Yugoslavia 
on the subject have been even 
' more acrimonious and tense 
than ever. 
Yugoslavia has charged in 
several notes that United States 
authorities, includiag the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation and 
local police forces, tacitly en-
courage terrorism against Yugo-
slav diplomats. 
An Ominous Shadow 
Tanyug, the official Yugoslav 
press agency, asserted that none 
of the perpetrators of various 
incidents involving Yugoslav 
diplomats in the United States 
had ever been caught or pun-
ished. Tanyug added that "the 
United States authorities are 
taking no measures to suppress 
this criminal activity" and that 
an "ominous shadow" had been 
? cast over Yugoslav-American 
relations. 
A high Yugoslav Foreign 
Ministry office official was even 
more emphatic in a conversa-
tion. 
? "This situation is absolutely 
intolerable," he said, "It is not 
only your. Government that en-
courages these things, it is your 
police and even your embassy 
here in Belgrade." 
The American position is that 
while terrorism in any form is 
a crime in the United States, 
the mere existence of political 
organizations hostile to one or 
another foreign ?government is 
not. 
In any case, the use of the. 
great deal about its flaws and 
defects, although they are dif-
ferent from those of Soviet 
society." 
For. 10 years, they con-
cluded: "American newspapers 
? have made proclamations about 
us, the creative intelligentsia, 
who are not free in Russia. We 
are now here in the United 
States. Why are we now denied 
the right to express our views 
in the pages of America's so-
called free press ? " 
One of the main groups con-
cerned with helping the 
emigres is the American Coun-
cil for ?gr?in the profes-
sions. The council's staff con-
cedes that there is a great deal 
of frustration, particularly 
among the emifres with pro-
fessional qualifications, 
because of the difficulty of 
adapting to American life. 
More and more emigres are 
coming to the United States, 
the council says, rather than 
going to Israel. Over the past 
three years, nearly 2,000 
.people with a professional 
background have arrived, and 
about one third are still with-
out jobs. 
American police againat politi-
cal dissidents from other coun-
tries would face overwhelming 
constitutional and legal obsta-
cles. ? 
This American argument, 
however, has infuriated key 
officials in the Yugoslav Gov-
ernment, reportedly at the very 
top, Among those who have 
expressed special annoyance on 
the subject was Franjo Herl-
jevic, Yugteslay Interior Secre-
tary, who is the chief of police, 
intelligence and other security 
services. 
The main targets of Bel-
grade's campaign abroad have 
been members of the Croatian 
Ustashi movement, a group that 
favors separation of Croatia 
from Yugoslavia. The Ustashi 
are regarded as the ideological 
successors of Croatian Fascist 
collaborators with the Nazi oc-
cupation of Yugoslavia, who 
supplied troops to fight against 
the Allies: 
A History of Assassinations 
Assassination as a political 
tool has a long and important 
history in Yugoslavia and the

Zest is gene  
Unfted Europe lhn 
By PETER J. KUMPA 
Suit Staff Correspondent 
Brussels?The post-war 
dream of a united Europe is 
all but dead. 
For reasons as old as lan-
guage or as new as the recent 
energy crisis, Europeans have 
lost their zest, their momen-
tum and ?debatably.? their 
will to push on to some sort of 
federal superstate. 
Nationalism guides Europe 
once again. It is threatened 
more from regional fragmen-
tation than from federalism. 
In the United Kingdom, for 
example, the movement for 
Scottish independence is deep-
er than any rush toward inte-
gration with the continent. 
Federalism still has its ad-
? vocates. But it is an idea for 
the future once again. Unity is 
praised in theory, admired in 
word but ignored in the tough, 
daily political and economic 
decisions of Europe. 
? The old timetables for 
achieving union through eco-
nomic, then monetary, then 
' political means were once en-
dorsed in principle by leading 
statesmen of all nine coun-
tries of the European com-
munity. That was in another 
era. The goals have been 
scrapped and overtaken by 
events. 
The more modest propos-
als made at the start of the 
year by Prime Minister Leo 
Tindemans of Belgium have 
also been shelved. They are to-
be discussed later in the year 
at more European summits. 
An idea or two may be 
picked from the Tindemans 
report. For the heart of the 
proposal on bow Europe can 
keep the federal idea going, 
little more than talk can be 
expected. 
The mood here in Europe's 
bureaucratic center is heavy 
with gloom over the federal 
future. 
"We are adrift on the high 
seas. The engine has gone 
dead," said one official. 
"But," he added quickly with 
the one promising fact, "we 
are still together on that 
ship." 
Some co-operation natural-
ly continues. If Europe is net 
about to plunge into the vi-
sionary dreams of two dec-
ades ago, neither is it pre-
pared to retreat. 
The fell customs union is 
eept ried tot,e) into effect on 
schedule at the end of 1977. 
The common agricultural pol-
icy remains alive despite sur-
pluses and zooming costs. 
Some progress can be counted 
in the complex process of har-
monization of economies. 
The idea of one Europe 
flickers on because it is easier 
?politically?for the mem-
bers to proceed with the ritu-
als of co-operation rather 
than have none at all. 
. If a potentially unifiable 
Europe is adrift, it has come a 
long way. 
The European community 
now forms a democratic, con-
sumer society with standards 
up to and sometimes surpass-
ing American ones. Europe-
ans enjoy American levels of 
wealth and American-style 
problems of crowded cities 
and the soiled environment. 
The Europeans do co-oper-. 
ate on a number of levels. In 
some areas of foreign policy, 
for example the United Na-
tions, foreign ministers are 
more apt to take similar posi-
tions. At any rate, the idea of 
close consultation is improv-
ing. 
The community has 
brought in Britain after two 
French vetoes. It has included 
Ireland and Denmark to join 
France, Italy, West Germany, 
the Netherlands, Belgium and 
Luxembourg. And it has close 
ties with other European 
countries with excellent pros-
pects to enlarge the communi-
ty in the next few years. 
A serious threat by France 
to break up the community 
was passed in the mid-1960's 
though the price for unity was 
a weaker organizational 
structure 
In all, the record has been 
pretty good. It is the future 
that is disturbing to European 
federalists. 
The progress of European 
unity up to now has come in 
relatively easier fields such as 
tariffs. 
The degree of sovereignty 
surrendered by any state has 
been small. No vital area of 
an individual state's authority 
has been threatened. Europe 
does not speak with one voice 
in foreign or defense policy, in 
monetary co-operation, even 
in such fields as industrial 
harmony or common trans-
port anvil. 
With ernsitive areas left to 
negotiate, Europe was hit 
s al n 
both by the energy crisis and 
the worldwide economic turn-
down. It did not take joint ac-
tion to a significant degree to 
solve these problems. 
Future joint action is hin-
dered by the domination of 
the Council of Ministers that 
took command from the com-
munity's commission a dec-
ade ago,Technically, majori-
ty voting on the council is pos-
sible. In practice, no decisions 
are made without a unani-
mous vote of all nine coun-
tries on any proposal. The un-
derstanding is clear that if 
any one of the nine feels 
strongly enough about an is-
sue, it will not be pressed 
against that country's will. 
This veto power by any 
member of the community 
makes progress difficult and 
uncertain. The best example - 
lies in implementing the 
agreement to have a directly 
elected European parliament 
by 1978. 
Up to now, there has been 
no understanding to update 
the appointed parliament of 
198 members. And it remains 
'a great uncertainty whether 
the July European summit 
will come to any agreement. 
The French are sticking to 
the 198-member figure. The 
British 'would prefer to at 
least double the number lest a 
European parliament come 
into existence with represen-
tation too low for regions such ? 
as Scotland. A failure to agree 
on the size and selection pro-
cess of a European parlia-
ment would be a serious and 
possibly a fatal blow to feder-
alism. 
It is not that the parlia-
ment has any great powers. It 
can dismiss the I3-member 
commission It can ask ques-
? tions 
But federalists count on a 
revival ot the spirit ot unity 
that could came from an insti-
tution that is elected directly 
by the people ot the nine 
states and is not appointed by 
governments In time, its 
powers might he expanded ln 
time. ii may take a broader 
view of issues. a European 
view Mai governments do not 
wish to risk 
The lack of movement in 
the Council of Ministers is 
partially due to the fact that 
the individual ministers rep-
resent governments And any 
eloi4o emit:limit:on of the nine 
countries shows that to one 
.degree or another. each 01 the 
governments has weaknesses 
They may be coalitions as 
in the Netherlands or Den-
mark Or they may have such 
narrow maturities as to tear 
taking positions that could en-
danger them in future elec-? 
wins Li works out so that a 
strong enough lobby in any 
country able to shake a pieee 
of one government can block 
an integrating action of the 
entire Community. 
The hope Of the federalists 
is that a European parliament 
will be able to rise above pet-
ty pressures to become a 
force for integration. France's 
Gaullists fear just that possi-
. bility. ? 
Another hope is the new 
commission with a new presi-
dent that is to take office in 
1977. If the European summit 
agrees to the recommenda-
tions of Mr. Tindemans, then 
the president will be named 
? early, perhaps in July. and al-
lowed some leeway in select-
? ing his commissioners. 
As it is Britain's turn to 
name the president, the choice 
centers on Roy Jenkins, a 
moderate in the Labor party 
and now Britain's Home sec-
retary. If Mr. Jenkins accepts 
.the accolade, he may, as a 
confirmed and enthusiastic 
European, be expected to 
breathe more life into the 
body that proposes solutions 
for the decisions of the Coun-
cil of Ministers. 
Even if the fragile hopes of 
the federalists do come true, 
the outlook for solid progress 
in integration does not appear 
bright. The twin pressures of 
war and poverty are in the 
past. For many reasons, Eu-
rope seems willing to have the 
United States bear the major 
concern for security. Europe 
has neither the stomach nor 
the will to challenge the 
American role. 
It would take the magni-
tude of an American pullout?
' a full one, not a partial with-
drawal of troops?or another 
serious threat of war to turn 
Europe toward greater unity. 
The possibility of one of 
its members-- Italy ? taking 
Communists into its govern-
ment does not unduly alarm 
The community. The West 
Germans may fret over such 
an outcome, but ether states 
are too preoccupied with in-
ternal disputes to show alarm. 
Some Europeans scoff at 
what they consider unneces-
sary Panerican alarm over the

Italian elections. 
Some of this may be due to 
the continuing European atti-
tude that the U.S. meddles un-
wisely in affairs on this side 
of the Atlantic. Through now 
reduced to modest levels, an 
anti-American spirit is never 
too deep in most Europeans. 
They remain determined to 
match the Americans in eco-
nomic power in time. 
The smaller European 
countries in particular?to-
gether with community feder-
alists-- have not been pleased 
with the tendency of the U S.. 
especially in the Nixon-Kis-
singer years, to deal with the 
bigger states like West Ger-
many and France on an indi-
vidual basis. 
WASHINGTON POST 
2 4 JUN 1976 
Joseph Kraft 
The Consequences 
Of Italy's Elections 
ROME?Mamma mia. What a mess 
the Italians seem to have made of the 
elections held here Sunday and Mon-
day- ? 
But, in fact, Italy's long-range outlook 
not so bad. Short-term difficulties, 
while acute, .can be got over if?as a 
price for immediate help?the U.S. and 
its allies insist that the victorious Chris-
? tian Democratic party abandon the hys-
terical anti-communism which has 
come to serve as a screen for corrup-
? tion and inefficiency. 
The truly sad consequence of the 
election was the unexpected triumph 
of the Christian Democrats. They ar-
:.rested a previous slide, winning 38.7 
per cent of the vote for parliament this 
year as against 35.6 per cent of the vote 
in the regional elections last year, and 
38.3 per cent of the 1972 vote for parlia-
ment. 
The Main reason for this gain lies in 
,the promise of change embodied by 
some attractive younger candidates, 
? notably Umberto Agnelli of the family 
which owns Fiat. The anti-Communist 
.drive led by the old gang around party 
president Amintore Fanfani yielded 
very little. For the Demo-Christians 
made their gains not on the anti-Corn-
.munist right, but from the smaller cen-
ter parties, attracted by the promise of 
reform. 
The old gang, however, still controls 
the party. Mr. Fanfani strutted into the 
TV center here in Rome election night, 
arrogant as a peacock, to proclaim a 
triumph for "freedom over commun-
ism." He seems to have in mind a Demo-
Christian regime that does not even 
talk to the Communists.' 
But the old-line Christian Democrats 
.have consistently managed Italy's bu-
reaucracy and vast state enterprises in 
ways .which promote clients and thus 
foster corruption, inefficiency and 
huge debts. There is no reason to think 
they will, of their own volition, change 
now, and make a serious address to Ita-
ly's long-term problems. 
. The long-term problems flow from 
the post-war economic modernization 
of the country. Italy produces first-rate 
products, which sell competitively 
abroad. Exports make up a substantial 
part of Italy's domestic product, and 
they have led a rapid, though not solid, 
35 
recovery from last year's inflation. 
But the Communist unions have im-
posed big wage increases on Italian in-
dustry. Italian wages have risen 168 per 
cent since 1970 as against 48 per cent in 
the U.S., 80 per cent. in Germany, 110 
per cent in France and 134 per cent in 
Britain. 
In consequence, Italian inflation is 
surging, investment is almost invisible. 
and the country has a tremendous ex-
ternal debt. Unless the problems of in-
flation and investment are solved, Italy 
will fall back in the international com-
petition and sink gradually to the level 
of an underdeveloped country with 
South American-style inflation, corrup-
tion and (maybe) military coups. 
The way to turn the economic corner 
Is by an informal accord with the Com-, 
munists. They would moderate wage 
demands in return for a Demo-Chris-
tian pledge to clean up the nationalized 
industries and promote private invest-
ment. - 
The Communists seem willing to go 
along. Though they failed to cut down 
the Demo-Christians, they also scored a 
big victory-34.4 per cent of the parlia-
mentary vote as against 32.4 per cent in 
the regional elections last June and 27.2 
per cent in the 1972 parliamentary elec-
tions. 
The relatively open line of the Com-
munist leader Enrico Berlinguer has 
thus been confirmed by victory at the 
polls. So the problem is to force the 
Christian Democrats to consult the 
Communists on an economic program 
even though they govern without 
them. 
Which is where. the United States 
and the European allies come in. They 
finance Italy through various arrange-
ments which come up for renewal 
soon. Unless they are renewed this 
country will go bust. 
So America and its allies have potent 
means to favor the younger Christian 
Democrats at the expense of the old 
gang by making a condition of any fur-
ther help some consultation with the 
Communists. It would be expecielly fit-
ting for the U.S., which played such a 
role in saving Italy from the bad, old 
Communists, to now save the country 
from the bad, old Christain Democrats.

ance of radicals and religious 
extremists, arrested over the 
past year have included not 
only the expected number of 
students but workers, farmers, 
teachers, young business execu-
tives and a nephew of the shah. 
Total political arrests have 
been estimated by Western 
investigators from Amnesty 
International, the international 
commission of jurists, and oth-
er groups at 300 to 1,000 a 
month. Dissident sources here 
said the current police cam-
paign has raised the number, to 
more than 1,000 monthly, most 
not involved in the underground 
movement at all. 
The underground opposition 
is not regarded as large. The 
number of active members was 
put by Western observers here 
at several hundred, possibly as 
many as 1,000; sources close to 
the dissidents claimed to have 
about 2,000 to 3,000 active 
members in their organizations. 
Since January, 53 suspected 
terrorists have been killed in 
gun battles with the police or 
executed after trials before 
military courts. In mid-May, 10 
were killed in shoot-outs in 
three northwest cities in one; 
day. Later 11 others were killed, 
in Tehran. The same week, 16 ' 
members of an extremist reli-
gious group were arrested in 
another city on charges of 
assassinating one of the 
country's religious leaders. 
Since 1972. more than 300 
Iranians have been executed 
for political activities, accord-
ing to Amnesty International in 
London. ' 
Large numbers of arrests 
-00432R000100400001-2 
have been made since last Octo-
ber, according to sources here, 
with the result that most of the 
cells in the underground 
network have been broken. 
"A year ago, the under-
ground had very well trained, 
armed units that organized sev-
eral waves of attacks, assassi-
nations and other terrorist 
actions over the spring and 
summer," a senior Western dip-
lomat said. "They killed at 
least six police officials, proba-
bly four or five times that in 
actuality, and three members 
of the U.S. mission including 
two Air Force colonels. They 
struck when and where they 
wanted. 
"It took the police a good 
nine months to get on to these 
groups, but they have done so 
with a vengeance. Now the 
police have the initiative and 
the underground is trying to 
regroup, so far with little 
success." 
Several sources close to the 
underground opposition 
acknowledged the effectiveness 
of the secret police campaign 
and said that members who had 
escaped arrest so far had gone 
into hiding and halted most of 
their activities. Many are said 
to have gone abroad, hoping to 
recruit new members from 
student groups in the United 
States, England and France. 
But the ef forts to gather 
more support and new recruits 
are hampered by the lack of a 
cohesive political philosophy by 
the various elements in the 
Zitgtlesf ZiMel Fri., June It 1916- _ _ 
underground, which has tried to 
ally anarchists, Maoists, ortho-
dox Communists and religious 
extremists  'opposing Iran's 
headlong modernization drive. 
Some of the underground 
members see themselves as 
successors to the moderate left-
ists who briefly held power 
here or to the powerful Com-
munist-led Tudeh party that 
even 10 years ago could still 
put thousands into the streets in 
demonstrations that required 
troops and tanks to end. 
But today's radicals find 
themselves without easy issues 
to exploit since the shah's 
"white revolution" will provide 
all Iranians with health care, 
free education, social security 
and worker ownership of 
industry. 
The two issues left?the de 
facto military alliance with the 
United States and political free-
dom here?do not seem to 
move most 'Iranians, who 
instead are consumed with 
improving their own family's 
living conditions. The religious 
extremists denunciations of 
Western values fall on deaf 
ears?Western consumer goods 
are exactly what they want. 
The radicals also lost much 
of their foreign support last 
year with the rapprochement 
between Iran and its neighbor 
Iraq, which had helped finance 
and train the underground. 
Iranian officials say the radi-
cals are still receiving help 
from the Marxist Popular 
Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine and from Libya.

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, Wednesday, June 23, 1976 
Darkest Africa 
To Americans the recent reports 
of riots and repression in South Af-
rica are uncomfortably familiar, 
and our natural instinct is to apply 
American experience to the - situa-
tion by condemning racism, coun-
selling moderation and urging inte-
grationist reforms. This not only 
fulfills the moral precept of the 
equality of men before the law, af-
ter all, but has also been highly suc-
cessful as a practical policy in the 
United States. 
In assessing the prospects of a 
successful multiracial democracy 
in South Africa, though, it is well to 
remember that the United States is 
an immigrant nation with theory 
and experience in striking a balance 
between assimilation and ethnic 
identity, and that it still has not 
resolved its own racial problems. In 
South Africa the situation is far 
more difficult. 
The core of South Africa is the 
2.5 million Boers whose ancestors 
,started to settle Africa in 1652. The 
Boers are among the toughest and 
proudest tribes on earth. When 
threatened by British 'domination in 
the 1830s, they migrated inland 
where they conquered the Bantu 
tribes invading from the north in a 
series of treks and battles that 
make the winning of our West seem 
trifling. Later they took on the Brit-
ish Empire. Insular, fundamentalist 
Calvinist, and fiercely racist; the 
Boers will truckle to no one, least of 
vil the hated blacks. Unlike other 
Colonials," the Boers have no place 
ta:go. They even call themselves 
Af rikanders?Africans. 
The remaining 1.75 million 
whites are mostly of British origin. 
,They, too, are typically racist, but 
because they are English-speaking, 
They can emigrate if the situation 
deteriorates. There are also 2.2 mil-
lion Cape Coloured, the mulatto de-
scendants of early Boer settlers and 
the aboriginal Hottentots, and 750,-
000 Asians; both the Coloured and 
the Asians despise and are despised 
by the other groups. 
Fri., June 18, 1976 log 2ngritz Zimes 
The principal antagonists to the 
? gs?ers are of course the South Afri-
can blacks, some 18 million Bantu, 
an. intelligent and vigorous people. 
Their quality is suggested by the 
warrior reputation of the most fa-
mous of them?the Zulu. The Bantu 
are also racist, against the whites 
and against the other tribes. There 
nothing, to say the least, in the 
history of black-dominated states in 
southern Africa to suggest that a 
Bantu republic would evolve into 
any kind of democracy, let alone a 
m,ultiracial one. 
There is no need or an Ameri-
can observer of this depressing 
s.cene to abandon his belief in the 
iribrality of the integrationist model, 
dr. to falter in moral support to 
dipse South Africans, white and 
tirlack, who courageously urge this 
curse. But as a practical policy, 
aodifying segregation cannot be 
9xpected to mollify the blacks or 
improve the security of the whites. 
The goal of an integrated society is 
_ 
unrealistic considering the dispari-
ties in culture, wealth and numbers 
between black and white. - ? 
One policy that might offer a 
glimmer of hope would be a sharp-
acceleration of the South African 
regime's "homelands" policy. lip to 
now the "Bantustans" have been lit-
tle more than Indian reservations, _ 
but it is possible to conceive that 
they might e%iolve into real nations, 
steadily gaining in independence 
and territory until the white South 
Africans are reduced to "Boer-
stans." Partition is of course sel-
dom a true solution, and in any 
event adoption of a generous home-
lands policy remains a slim hope 
indeed. 
We will have to get used to the 
idea that the U.S. can do very little 
positively for South Africa. It would 
seem a most promising area for a 
policy of strict non-intervention, 
though domestic and international 
pressures will urge U.S. involve-
ment. Americans will want to see 
neither racial equality denied nor 
an outpost of Western , civilization 
destroyed. 
But what can we do? It may be 
useful to make occasional un-
friendly noises, if only because 
South Africa is an international par-
iah. We have already embargoed 
arms sales, but South Africa can 
obtain all it needs from other sup-
pliers. Other embargoes and boy-
cotts would have even less effect, 
even if there were some "solution" 
a boycott policy might be directed 
toward. As for American financial 
investment in South Africa, it is dif-
ficult and probably inappropriate 
for the U.S. government to gauge 
how much it aids the regime and-or 
the Bantu. 
The Russian-Cuban intervention - 
in Angola demonstrates, it can and 
will be argued, the dangers of not 
finding a solution in South Africa. 
Alas, Angola teaches more depress-
ing lessons. The Portuguese colony_ 
was among the most integrated so- ' 
cieties in the world, yet it broke ' 
down into anarchy and white flight. 
Even with the whites gone, a racial 
war broke out among the three ma-
jor tribal groupings and the Com-
munists easily recruited one of 
them. No less can be expected in 
South Africa. 
Violence in South Africa will cer-
tainly continue and probably inten-
sify in coming years; we have just 
witnessed the latest skirmish in a 
400-year war. The only comfort to 
Americans is .likely to be the 
thought that if our experience tella 
little about South Africa, its experi-
ence tells little about us. What is 
happening in Southern Africa is not 
an ultimate statement about race 
relations for all of mankind. But 
neither will UN resolutions, foreign 
boycotts, or pious declarations re-, ' 
solve the historical and cultural 
forces involved. What we are seeing 
is a calamity resulting from immut-
able fate, a tragedy in the literal 
sense of the word.

? were they criminal elements that Cuban Pre-
mier Fidel Castro wanted to get rid of. They 
are fervent revolutionaries. 
Second, although all eagerly want to go 
home, they are not at all discouraged about 
being in Africa. After all, they say over and 
over, they won. 
? Contrary to some reports, they keep in 
touch with Cuba, and they send and receive 
letters from home. But? there their contacts 
pretty much end. 
They all say, for instance, that they do not 
? 
know how many Cubans died. One put it "in 
the hundreds." They do not know when or if 
they are going home. Men like Abdalla are 
typical. He said he came in November and 
expects to leave in October. 
Are the Cubans going to leave? Despite 
such indications as Castro's note read to Sec-
retary of State Kissinger in Sweden several 
weeks ago saying they would be withdrawn, 
? there are no indications of it here. 
The Cuban men on the streets of Luanda 
? have heard nothing of it and, moreover. 
many of them are quietly being switched to ? 
civilian positions. In the flexible?and highly 
effective?manner of the Cuban armed 
forces, men who came as soldiers, like Abdal-
la, are now listed as civilians. He, for in-
stance, is now working in construction. 
With this sort of transferring around, you 
can make almost anything you want of the ? 
numbers game. 
But the Cubans also fulfill several other im-
portant functions at this point. Observers 
close to the situation say they are one of the 
most important supporters of Presidente 
Agostinho Neto's policy of biracialism against 
? men like Nito Alves and Carlos Arocha, min-
ister of planning and development. These 
men, they say, take a black racist position. 
For these reasons, the Portuguese still here 
?and there remain still about 50,000?will 
tell you that they consider the Cuban Marx-
ists their strongest allies. "We all say that 
when the last Cubans sail away, we will be 
. on that boat, too," a Portuguese translator 
? named Lucinda told me. ? 
The Portuguese also tell you that the Cu-
' bans, under a .black commander, put down a, 
small insurrection in the black. suburb of 
? Prenda about three months ago when some 
blacks were "going downtown to kill whites," 
The Cuban forces are about half white and 
; half black. , _

Amin accuses CIA 
of tryirig to kill him 
reutte, 
LONDON ?President Idi Amin of 
Uganda yesterday blamed the CIA 
for an alleged attempt to killhim last 
week, according to a Uganda broad-
cast monitored in London. 
Amin was not hurt when grenades 
were allegedly thrown at his jeepin 
Kampapa on June 10, but his driver 
VMS killed. Knowledgeable sources 
have claimed that the whole incident 
was staged by Amin. 
In effect, while many Socialist countries 
now have missions here, and while some An-
golan officials certainly fear the special pow-
er of the Cubans, the Cubans have shown 
themselves to be both effective and discreet. 
With certain exceptions, their behavior has 
been, as one Portuguese put it, "totally cor-
rect." Except for the officers, who have dol-
lars, the average Cuban has no money at all 
and thus cannot go out and splurge on the lo-
cal economy. 
'Td like to invite you to a beer," one young 
Cuban told me, "but I honestly don't have an 
escudo. All our money goes directly to our 
families in Cuba." 
What's more, they have shown themselves 
to have an equally discreet but direct effect. 
on the government. The form of Marxism be"-
ing developed here, the call for volunteers to 
bring in the sugar harvest, even this week's 
flamboyant trial of the Western mercenaries 
?all show the special touch of the Castroites. 
In short, it would be extremely naive to 
think that either the Cuban involvement in. 
Africa or the African Socialist revolution is 
going to stop in Angola. Indeed, with their 
own trained people and with the support of 
the Socialist bloc, Angola is virtually sure to 
become "the" center of African socialism in' 
the near future. . 
Only this week, for instance, SWAPO, .Or. . 
, -the South-West African P2oples Organization, 
opened its first headquarters here in Luanda-
and pledged, on this "new border" with South 
African-occupied South-West Africa, to 
; crease the fight. The same thing is happening --
with guerrillas now fighting on the Mozam-
bique border against the white Rhodesian 
government. 
?? So some Cubans may be withdrawn and 
some may not, but that really doesn't matter.. 
-They can easily be brought back when they 
".are needed in Rhodesia or South-West Africa 
?which they judge will not be for a couple ? 
of years?and, meanwhile, they are helping' 
to build Angola. 
What really comes out of the Angolan sit- ? 
uation is the fact that the West could easily. 
learn some lessons from the Cubans. While 
this handful of Western mercenaries, who 
come through here as paid killers and misfits,. ? 
were on trial here, the Cubans, who could be 
considered "revolutionary mercenaries," have.: 
given a good example of how it should be done.

Toronto Globe l Mall 
-,..PEKING. June 23 ? Aus-
tralian Prime Minister Mal-
volm Fraser has told China 
he has serious doubts about 
,the ability of the United 
?States to counter growing 
Soviet power, because of dis-
agreement between Presi-
dent Gerald Ford and Con-
gress. ? 
'.Fraser -believed he was 
,speaking strictly privately 
when he. told Chinese Pre-
mier Hua "Kuo-feng on Sun-
-clay evening of his -concern, 
but ,Australian functionaries 
mistakenly distributed trait, 
scripts of his remarks in the 
..press room set up for the 
grirgieg 
prime minister's visit. 
.Fraser linked his concern 
about the United States to 
Soviet intervention in An-

'flied aid by the LLS. Con-
egress. The prime minister. 
-.:said he believed the conflict 
*.between Congress and the 
President- on foreign policy 
"materially contributed to So-
viet intervention* in Angola 
and the ? belief that there 
would not be a reaction 
from the United States." 
..Some years ago, there 
were six or eight significant 
leaders in Congress and if a 
lruggluile 1S, 1976 
_ 
President had their support. 
he Would be assured of the 
liupport of the Congress in 
"certain policies. There is

or in the interests of

The Australian prime min-
ister also expressed concern 
that Vietnam might play the 
same surrogate role for the 
Soviet Union in Asia as 
Cuba ? has in Africa. 
"Because of the attitude of 
the United States, Cuba, has 
not found it very easy to be 
successful in an environ-
ment that is close to the 
United States, but with So-
viet support found no diffi-
culty in causing very grave 
problems in Angola. We 
wonder whether or not Viet-
nam might follow the same 
path that Cuba has. We 
raise that as a question."

uled 'to respond to Fraser's 
points at a later session of 
their talks. The only sub-
stantive remarks of the pre-

the Pacific region. 
e r Signs From China 
, 
- *The .Chinese people are being prepared for the 
..passing of Mao Tse-tung. Chinese newspapers have 
-lately carried pictures of the 82-year-old leader that 
give candid evidence of his increased decrepitude, 
-in marked contrast to the usual practice of portray-
ing Mao as alert, active and vigorous. The purpose 
Of the photos is to signal the Chinese that the inevi-
table time of transition is approaching. That signal 
:Should also be heeded by Washington. 
Sino-American relations have for some time been 
in a state of pause. The absence of movement prob-
-ably .has been dictated by the U.S. political cam. 
-paign, and the reluctance of Washington in this 
period to deal with the outstanding issue between 
-the two countries?American recognition of the 
:goVernment on Taiwan as the government of all 
;china.. 
President Ford, in his last known official message 
.to ?Peking two months ago, looked forward to a 
.!!normalization" of bilateral relations. That word 
.means only one thing to the Chinese: acceptance of 
Peking's sovereignty over all -of China. That even-
tuality has been implicit in U.S. policy since 1972. 
The unanswered questions about how to carry out 
-that policy basically involve timing and mode, 
which specifically mean arrangements that can be 
;.made that would not constitute a sacrifice of Taiwan. 
The model for future Taiwan .policy has been set 
by Japan, which switched its recognition from the 
Nationalist government in Taipei to the Communist 
regime in Peking, while at the same time maintain-
Mg a close, growing and accepted economic rela-
tionship with Taiwan. The U.S. government would 
undoubtedly be able to follow the same course, pro-
vided there were assurances from China that it 
would not seek to win control ()vet Taiwan by force. 
The way in which the Taiwan dispute could be 
resolved, then, is not a major problem. But the tim-

ing of a new formal relationship. with China pre-
sents a problem of perhaps growing urgency, an ur-
gency dictated by Mao's enfeeblement and mortali-
ty. That problem is the focus of an important arti-
cle in the current Foreign Policy magazine by Ro-
ger Glenn Brown, a senior CIA analyst. 
Brown's central point is that the United States 
should move quickly to settle the Taiwan question 
so that it can strengthen its standing in Peking 
while Mao is still alive. If that is done, Brown 
argues, the influence of the pragmatists in the Chi-
nese hierarchy who favor improved ties with the 
West would be augmented in the probably una-
voidable conflict over power that will follow Mao's 
death. Delay, on the other hand, could work to the 
advantage of the radical and pro-Soviet elements in 
the Peking leadership who want to resume ideolog-
ical hostility to the non-Communist world and end 
the Sino-American connection. 
Brown's article is significant on several counts. It 
is a departure from?even a defiance of?Secretary 
of State Kissinger's policy of controlling all govern-
ment-related statements on China, though Brown 
notes that he is speaking for himself and not the 
CIA. And it brings into the open a matter of some 
delicacy in Washington: the U.S. interest in keep-
ing China and Russia on less-than-friendly terms. 
Whatever can be done to bolster the position of the 
moderates in China will serve that interest. 
No one can foretell what the succession in China 
will involve, what balance of forces will emerge. 
But it is plausiEe that the United States may have 
some ability at least to influence the course of 
events, through actions that would support the pol-
icies of Pekings moderate leaders while simul-
taneously serving its own interests. But the time to 
act in behalf of that goal may be running out, as 
Mao's long Lento; nears its end.

two Indian dead. However, the subse-

northern neighbor. 
_ This should encourage President 
Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. 
.Kissinger to negotiate the complete 
normalization of :relations with China 
? before the death of Chairman Mao 
.Tse-tung further complicates the politi-
cal scene in Peking. 
. The failure to establish full diploma-
: tic relations with the People's Repu-
blic of China is damaging Sino-Ameri-
can detente. Considerable evidence 
exists that the pace of normalization 
' has fallen far short of what Peking 
- had anticipated. ? 
?" 
In 1975, intimations of Chinese ir-
? ritation became 'apparent. First voiced ? 
' .in unofficial conversations, they be- ' 
came open on the. eve of President 
Ford's visit last December. The main 
problem is our relationship with Tai-
wan. Our diplomatic recognition and, 
'defense commitment are incompatible 
with the -understandings reached in 
the 1972 Shanghai Communique at the 
time of,Richard M. Nixon's China visit ? 
? ? as President. ? 
These understandings implied that 
with the end of the Indochina war and 
a tacit agreement by Peking not to use 
force against Taiwan, the United States 
? would disengage militarily from the 
-island, dissolve the defense treaty; and 
move toward full diplomatic relations 
with China. 
The issue for all concerned with 
Taiwan's future may be posed in this 
way: Can the American sense of moral 
obligation and our allies' sense of 
United States reliability be sufficiently 
met by an arrangement whereby we 
explicitly renounce a commitment to 
use ,force against force in exchange 
for a tacit commitment by Peking not 
to use force? 
Most proposals that meet the needs 
of United States moral concern and 
our Asian allies' security concerns fall 
short of what is acceptable to Peking. 
Any formal pledge of outside defense 
assistance is incompatible with Peking's 
Insistence?as expressed in the Shang-
hai Communique?that the "liberation 
of Taiwan" is China's internal affair. 
However, what Peking terms "the 
Japanese formula" provides a solution 
to the impasse. This would involve 
termination of our -defense treaty and 
all formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan 
while continuing to maintain trade, 
travel and economic relationships un-
impaired. ? 
Were such a precedent to he followed 
bSe the United States, our official ex-
pression'of interast in Taiwan's peace-
ful' evolution would be significantly 
reinfarced. by the tangible presence 'of 
many American citizens and Considera-
' ble United Stales capital 'on. the island 
Any violation by Peking-of. a tacit 
'understanding:not to ? attack Taiwan 
would challenge important interests 
whose influence. :in and on Congress 
could- not be discounted in advance. 
In addition, because of Tokyo's con-
cern:over sizable - Japanese interests 
there, joint consultation would un-
doubtedly produce an appropriate res-
ponse to signp of an imminent effort - 
by China to take the island by farce. 
To minimize the likelihood of this 
eventually., occurring, however, our 
position must be made sufficiently 
clear and China's tacit acquiescence 
sufficiently credible to provide the 
necessary assurance that Taiwan will 
not be attacked in the aftermath of 
American military disengagement. 
Two underlying imperatives" cur-
rently, render the normalization of 
Sino-American relations urgent. First, 
so long as we remain politically and 
militarily involved with the Chinese 
Nationalists, good relations with . Pe-
king will be vulnerable to political op-
position in China on an issue that 
strikes at the most sensitive nerves of 
Chinese self-consciousness. Not only 
will our bilateral relations be affected 
but also our interaction in other areas 
such as Korea. 
Second; the Peking-Moscow-Wash-
ington ?triangular relationship Is signi-
ficantly involved. After the death of 
Mr. Mao, the present intense hostility 
between China and the Soviet Union 
may, well diminish.' If we have failed,

? A great fiesta is planned for June 6 
in Cuba honoring the nation's "secret 
agents and counterspies." The event 
will commemorate the 15th anniver?
sary of the interior ministry which is 
in charge of internal security. 
It is a peculiar arrogance of strong 
totalitarian regimes to not only glorify 
their inStruments of terror and oppres-
sion but to positively put them on pa-
rade. Thus in Nazi Germany the Ges-
tapo wore the most dramatic uniforms 
and were glamorized at every opportu-
nity. In the Soviet Union the Vast bu-
reaucracy of "security" that encom-
passes the labor and prison .camps. the 
spy agencies and ordinary police, is 
one big family dedicated to the service 
and advancement of the state.

It may lead to the firing squad or inter-

The frolic announced by Havana will 
commemorate Cuban security's victo-

Washington Post Staff Writer 
"I am a good example of 
the results of a policy 
clearly conducted to lose . 
friends," said an exiled Uru-
guayan leader who was once 
considered a friend- of the 
United States in ? ? Latin 
America. ? 
. He is now. in Washington 
to denounce U.S. policy in 
the hernishphere before a 
congressional committee. 
Ex-Sen. Wilson Ferreira 
Aldunate, ? who narrowly 
missed election to the presi-
dency in 1971, accused the 
-State Department of keep-
ing afloat the military re-
gime that shut down dernoc-
'racy in Uruguay three years 
ago. ? 
Wilson Ferreira, 57, is a 
strong nationalist who nev-
ertheless is proud to have 
been named after the Amer-
ican president. Woodrow 
Wilson. Easily as eloquent a 
speaker as Fidel Castro but 
poles apart from him politi-
cally, he is now so embit-
tered against U.S. policy 
that he sees a possible 
American contribution to 
the assassination of a fellow 
exiled ex-senator, Zeiroar ? 
Michelini, in Argentina last 
month. 
"I don't say that itliehelini 
I would have lived hut for the 
'T.S. eation," Ferreira said in 
an interview, "nut peii it inn 
peeled his being saved." 
By Ferrera's account, 
when Michelini sought a 
visa to come here last year 
?also to question U.S. pol-
icy before congressional 
committees?the State De-
partment flagged the Uru-
guayan government,. which 
canceled his passport. 
Uruguay stranded Michel-
ini in Buenos Aires by in-
forming the U.S. and Argen-
tine governments and the 
airlines of the cancellation, 
said Ferreira, who offers ex-
tensive evidence that Argen-
tine troops then killed Mi-
chelini and three other Uru-
guayan exiles at the behest 
of the neighboring govern. 
ment. 
A State Department 
spokesman said that Uru-
guay, not the United States 
initiated discussion of press 
reports that Michelin{ would 
come here. The State De-
partment replied that noth-
ing would prevent the visit, 
the spokesman said, adding 
that there waS no record of 
Michelini's ever applying 
for a visa. 
In arty case, said Ferreira., 
the-Urnuayans would be 
alive today if the U.S. goy-
eminent had warned Argen-
tine President Cm. Jorge 
when they were hid-
'taped --three days before

Thus the poor CIA, whose mistakes 
become gene'riirriT6irtIttae and whose , 
triumphs must remain unknown, is de-
nounced both at home and abroad. The I 
life of, a spy is never easy and it must I 
be particularly trying in a democracy 
where praise and credit are given : 
anonyrnously, but where blame and i 
disgrace canoe very public. 
Even the most dedicated CIA agent 
must look at the approaching festivi-
ties in Havana where his deadly ene-
mies will be garlanded with blossoms 
and feel a slight stirring of envy. But 
that is one of the prices of working for 
a democracy. What is regarded as a 
heinous overstepping of bounds here 
would be seen as clever police work in 
Havana or Moscow. A country is 
known by its heroes. 
Testifying last week. be-
fore the House subcommit-
tee on international organi-
zations, Ferreira said he de-
spairs of any such humani-
tarian intervention: 
"All we want'is to be left 
alone. Our countrymen are 
struggling in all possible 
ways for the defense of the 
principles, ideals and way of 
life that our country took 
from the Constitution of the 
United States. 
"Not one of us could ever 
understand that the im-
mense weight of the same 
nation that defined those 
ideals 200 years ago, and.to-
day celebrates them with 
joy, could continue to be 
given in support for the cue--
mies of our people." 
Ferreira also charged in 
the interview that Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert J. 
McCloskey had misrepre-
sented the status of Uru-
guayan human rights in a 
letter intended to convince 
I Congress that violations had 
diminished. 
McCloskey's letter to sub-
committee chairman Donald 
? M. Fraser (D-Minna quoted 
the International Commis-
sion of Jurists as saying 
Uruguay is "doing ? every. 
thing possible to reduce the 
risk of mistreatment of po-
lit peisoners." 
Tha commission's elan"-
t itra eeneral reepareiled, 
lio w,V,V, that the quote was 
talain out of eanteet and 
that the 'report in fact docu-
mented continuing human-
rights violations. 
Fraser, agreeing with,Fere 
reira's charge, said, "The 
-U.S. government is trying to 
. mislead Congress ? on the 
question of human rights in 
Uruguay." 
McCloskey said that 
while he signed the letter 
as the State Department li-
aison with Congress, it was 
prepared by other officials 
and he was not yet preparea 
to respond. 
? The U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives voted last week to 
cut off military aid to Uru-
guay because' of humnn-
rights violations there. 
As for Argentina, Ferreira 
pointed out that the police 
had not even bothered to 
follow up his urgingS that 
they come collect finger-
prints of those who carried 
off the Uruguayans. In a 
nine-page letter to the Ar-
gentine president ? ho 
concluded: 
"When the hour of your 
own exile ? comes?as you 
can be sure it will, General 
Videla?if you seek refuge 
in Uruguay, an Uruguay 
whose destiny will once - 
again be in the hands of its 
people, we will receive you 
without warmth and without 
affection; but we will guar-
antee you the protection 
which you denied to those 
whose death we mourn to. 
day."
