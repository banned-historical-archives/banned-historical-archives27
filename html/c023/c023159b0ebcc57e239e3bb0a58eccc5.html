 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 RETURN OF SOVIET OFFICIALS TO MOSCOW
 Since early June and par-
 ticularly since mid-July, over
 350 Soviet diplomats and other
 officials have returned to the
 USSR from 42 of the 53 nations
 with which the USSR maintains
 diplomatic relations.   The num-
 ber does not include dependents
 of foreign service officers.
 Some 32 ambassadors, of
 whom six have apparently re-
 turned to their posts, and large
 numbers of lesser diplomatic
 officials are involved in the
 homeward movement.
 CONFIDENTIAL
 as yet been no unusual movement
 of military or naval attachesF
 While the movement of a
 number of diplomats could be
 attributed to summer vacations
 or  to consultations  on the
 countries to which they are
 accredited, the recall of well
 over half of the USSR's ambas-
 sadors suggests that something
 more than routine matters is
 involved.   It seems likely that
 the diplomatic officers could
 CONFIDENTIAL
 have been called back to Moscow
 for general discussions of new
 moves either ,.in foreign policy
 or in the international Commu-
 nist movement, such as the re-
 cent talks with Marshal Tito.
 The returns could also
 indicate important government
 and
 party meetings to consider
 25X1
 as
 and
 yet unannounced
 organizational
 personnel
 changes.
 Ithe Soviet
 party central committee is
 scheduled to meet during the
 latter part of August or in
 early September to discuss the
 activity of Soviet trade unions.
 The plenum may well also have
 been called to hear Khrushchev
 review the international situa-
 tion and report on the Tito
 talks and the trips to Czecho-
 slovakia and East Germany.
 Other problems which might be
 discussed are top-level person-
 nel assignments in both party
 and government, possibly includ-
 ing the question of Premier
 Bulganin's status.
 Such personnel changes
 could involve the replacement
 of some foreign service person-
 nel who have in the-past been
 tied to Molotov, Malenkov, Kag-
 anovich, or Shepilov.   N. M.
 Pegov, the ambassador to Iran,
 will not return to his post in
 Tehran to which he was assigned
 only a year ago; he may be un-
 der a cloud for past associa-
 tions with members of the "anti-
 party" group.

 PEIPING PREPARES CRACKDOWN ON PEASANTS
 Alarmed by a deteriorating
 economic and political situa-
 tion in rural areas, the Chi-
 nese Communists are embarking
 on a major campaign among the
 peasantry.   Peiping's entire
 economic development'program_
 is heavily dependent on its_
 success in extracting grain
 from the peasants and control-
 ling its distribution.  Evi-
 dence.  that  the Chinese Com-
 munists are running into
 serious trouble on this score
 has been piling up, and last
 week Peiping called for a mass
 effort in "socialist educaton"
 among China's 500,000,000 peas-
 ants.
 The authoritative. Peso le's
 Daily set the pitch for the cam-
 pa .gn on 5 August in an editori-
 al.which declared that the food
 question is primarily an ideo-
 logical problem.   In a direc-
 tive three days later, the
 party central committee ordered
 immediate action by all levels
 of the party il+o give the peas-
 ants a "true appreciation" of
 the superiority of cooperatives,
 the necessity for government
 purchasing and marketing of
 grain, the nature of the rela-
 tionship between urban workers
 and peasants, and the importance
 of suppressing counterrevolution.
 This was followed on 10 August
 by another long editorial in
 the People's Daily explaining
 the party line   t forth in
 the directive.
 Peiping has good reason
 to be alarmed about its posi-
 tion in the countryside and to
 insist that peasant coopera-
 tion be assured before the au-
 tumn harvest gets under way
 next month.   Peasant resistance
 to state grain levies has been
 increasing and has been abetted
 in some cases by cadres in

 charge of Agricultural Producer
 Cooperatives and by middle-
 level government officials.
 Peiping complains that coopera-
 tive members have attempted
 to conceal farm surpluses from
 the state in an effort to evade
 forced deliveries and have even
 diverted grain into black-mar-
 ket channels.
 It is this tendency of
 putting individual needs ahead
 of state interests which Pei-
 ping hopes to overcome in the
 present campaign.   Its efforts
 to cope with what is essential-
 ly an economic problem by polit-
 ical means will be aggravated
 by the prospect of a disappoint-
 ing crop for the second-,straight
 year    In 1956 Peiping drew
 heavily on'its grain reserves
 to offset losses from natural
 disasters and, as a selling
 point for the new cooperative
 members, to raise their in-
 come. However, drought and
 floods have struck key grain
 producing provinces of Central
 and North China, and the needed
 bumper crop very likely will
 not be forthcoming.
 The Chinese Communists
 evidently hope they can solve
 these problems by "persuasive
 talks" with the peasants, but
 Peiping's recent major state-
 ments on policy in the country-
 side make, it clear that terror
 is being held in reserve.if
 persuasion fails.   A statement
 in the 5 August editorial that
 "some comrades" see no way to
 reach a compromise between the
 needs of the state and the de-
 mands of the peasants suggests
 that harsh methods have al-
 ready been proposed by some
 party leaders.
 The central committee
 directive of 8 August declared
 that "reactionaries and counter-
 revolutionaries" who raise their
 voices in village discussions
 are to be silenced at once and
 the masses encouraged to demand
 "necessary control" for idlers.
 The State Council has already
 ordered establishment of ad-
 ditional forced labor camps for
 this purpose in a directive on
 3 August.   Outlining plans, for
 the new "education" campaign,
 the central committee indicated
 that "large debate meetings"
 of all members in a coopera-
 tive or village can be held
 "when necessary."  At these
 meetings, the "masses decide
 what is correct or what is
 incorrect"--a technique used
 during the bloody land reform
 campaign which ended in 1953.
 The People's Daily of 10
 August too  an even harder
 line.   The rural problem is
 stated in terms of a continu-
 ing struggle between "social-
 ism" and capitalism.  The
 editorial blames rural troubles
 on the activities of "former
 landlords, rich peasants,
 and counterrevolutionaries"
 who have been inspired by the
 attacks of "bourgeois rightists"
 on the regime last June, and
 concludes that "unless we deal
 a severe blow to these bad ele-
 ments," the r?ra.i  nroLzram will
 break down.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 KHRUSHCHEV'S VISIT TO EAST GERMANY
 Khrushchev during his East
 German tour reaffirmed Soviet
 endorsement of the East German
 plan for a German confederation
 and made it clear there will
 be no unified Germany except
 on Soviet terms.   Khrushchev's
 praise of East German party
 boss Ulbricht indicated there
 would be no relaxation of con-
 trols.   The emph;.sis on the
 "unity of the socialist camp"
 throughout Khrushchev's speeches
 served notice to dissident ele-
 ments in all Communist parties
 that "unity" must be maintained
 by strict adherence to Moscow's
 directives.
 Most of Khrushchev's state-
 ments on reunification and the
 communique.at the conclusion
 of the visit repeated the line
 already taken in the Soviet
 Foreign Ministry rebuttal on
 2 'August of the Western f our-
 power Berlin Declaration.  His
 support for the Socialist Unity
 (Communist) Party (SED) posi-
 tion on reunification reported-
 ly has given East German Com-
 munists a renewed feeling of
 confidence and optimism.  From
 their point of view, the situa-
 tion is much improved.   One
 East German official is said
 to have exclaimed, "The Rus-
 sians will never desert us, we
 will never see German reunifica-
 tion in our time."  Many of them
 evidently had feared they might
 be shelved in some reunifica-
 tion deal with the West.
 Ulbricht's position within
 the party was strengthened by
 Khrushchev's eulogy of him as'
 the "most faithful of all the
 faithful."  This represents at
 least a temporary setback for
 the more liberal elements with-
 in the SED who have been urging
 Ulbricht to permit more economic
 and political freedom.   Ulbricht
 himself will probably construe
 the Khrushchev endorsement as
 vindication of his stand that
 his tough policies have been
 completely correct and that
 there, is:;no L"need: to change them.
 The necessity for unity
 within the Socialist camp was
 repeatedly. emphasized by Khru-
 shchev.  His references to the:
 East:German:party's avoidance
 of factionalism and revisionism
 probably will be understood by
 all Communist parties in the
 bloc as a warning that "unity"
 can only be maintained by strict
 adherence to Moscow policies.
 .The communique states
 that the delegations discussed
 economic relations between East
 Germany and the USSR and agreed
 to hold further talks in Berlin
 to work out an agreement on goods
 deliveries for  the three-year
 period  1958-1960.  A  further
 increase in  trade is anticipated
 during  this period,   despite
 serious  lags in East German
 deliveries  to the  Soviet
 Union  this year.  References
 to  "large-scale  cooperation"
 suggest  that a  further  inte-
 gration                                                                  of East Germany's
 economy  with  that of the
 USSR  is planned. Failure  to
 delineate  economic decisions
 suggests that no new substantial
 Soviet aid  to  East Germany
 was  agreed  on.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 August 1957
 The Adenauer government
 still hopes to help its Septem-
 ber election prospects through
 trade and repatriation talks
 with the USSR, which resumed
 on 12 August after a six-day
 interruption.   Ambassador Lahr
 has presented what the Foreign
 Ministry describes as a "calm
 and conciliatory" statement on
 repatriation aimed at an option
 agreement following 30,000
 Baltic Germans to choose be-
 tween Soviet and German citizen-
 ship.
 Despite the USSR's previous
 unyielding attitude, Bonn still
 feels Moscow will be inclined
 to compromise on repatriation
 because of the apparent Soviet
 desire to normalize relations
 and expand trade.   Since there
 is little pressure from West
 German business leaders for ex-
 panded trade with the USSR, the
 German delegation will not pro-
 ceed with trade and consular
 negotiations until satisfactory
 progress is made on repatria-
 tion.
 If Moscow proves uncompro-
 mising, the German delegation
 will attempt to stall as long
 as possible--preferably until
 after the 15 September elections
 --and in any case force the
 Soviet Union to take the initia-
 tive in breaking off the talks.
 Bonn could then publicize Mos-
 cow's "inhumane" approach to
 counter opposition charges of
 government "inflexibility" and
 inability to deal with Moscow.
 The Adenauer government
 probably feels that the talks
 will help to distract the at-
 tention of the West German
 voter from the unification is-
 sue, which has been prompted
 by East German Premier Grote-
 wbhl's "new" unification plan
 and the "electioneering" of
 Khrushchev in Berlin.   So far,
 the West German press, though
 giving Khrushchev's visit wide
 coverage, has been negative
 and unenthusiastic in its com-
 ment on the offer of a troop
 withdrawal.   One of the leading
 independent dailies character
 ized the visit as "demonstrating
 the deadlock in the reunifica-
 tion issue."  Some editorials
 have speculated that Khrushchev's
 anti-Adenauer campaign may even
 redound in the chancellor's
 favor.
 Opposition Social Demo-
 cratic comment has denounced
 Khrushchev's interference in
 the election as a "great trage-
 dy," while pointing out that
 the offer of a troop withdrawal
 might form the basis for future
 negotiations.
 There are indications,
 moreover, that the West German
 public's attitude toward uni-
 fication has undergone some
 significant changes.   In a re-
 cent survey, more than half of
 those polled did not expect
 peaceful unification in the
 foreseeable future.   In addi-
 tion, about 30 percent of the
 respondents--nearly double the
 number of a year ago--had no
 opinion as to what is the main
 obstacle blocking reunification,
 thus suggesting a waning inter-
 est in the issue.
 These lowered expectations
 on unification may make any
 progress achieved in the Mos-
 cow negotiations toward improv-
 ing general relations between
 the two countries all the more
 essive to the GP 7       7 an public.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 August 1957
 FRANCE'S PROPOSED BASIC STATUTE FOR ALGERIA
 Premier Bourges-Maunoury
 intends to have a draft .Algeri-
 ant statute ready for considera-
 tion at the special session of
 the French National Assembly he
 has promised to call in late
 September.   Paris is determined
 to maintain French authority in
 Algeria, but hopes to devise a
 new basis for French-Algerian
 relations that will head off .a
 critical resolution in the
 United Nations General Assembly
 session this fall.
 For the immediate future,
 ?    the government seems to be plac-
 ing increasing confidence in
 pacification operations and is
 relying heavily on its ability
 to block arms-smuggling by
 sealing the Tunisian frontier.
 It hopes that evidence of French
 resolve to hold Algeria will
 help induce Moslem acceptance
 of a new program..  In any event,
 France is still firmly eschew-
 ing the formula of "independence
 within a framework of inter-
 dependence`" used in settlement
 of both the Moroccan and Tuni-
 sian issues;., in.1955 and 1956.
 Of the several approaches
 to a new French-Algerian rela-
 tionship suggested by French
 leaders, the proposal of Min-
 ister for Algeria Robert La-
 coste for a limited federalissih,
 because it safeguards French
 interests, appears to-be the
 one most likely to gain assem-
 bly acceptance.   Lacoste would
 divide Algeria into a number
 of autonomous regions along
 ethnic lines favorable to the
 European minority.  A single-
 college assembly would be
 elected by both Algerians and
 Europeans on a regional basis
 rather than by direct popular
 suffrage.
 Some features of the tra-
 ditional French assimilative
 approach are added by providing
 for Algerian representation in
 the French National Assembly
 and explicit reference in the
 preamble of the statute to
 -Algeria's status as "an integral
 part of France."  Final author-
 ity in Algeria would reportedly
 still be held by a government-
 appointed minister empowered
 to veto acts that violate the
 French constitution.  A "court
 of arbitration" would judge
 disputes between majority and
 minority groups.
 Despite growing domestic
 and international pressure, the
 Bourges-Maunoury government
 seems incapable of more than
 a minimum compromise program
 aimed at winning National
 Assembly support and mollifying
 opposition in the UN.  A strong
 minority of French political
 opinion, however, doubts that
 any imposed political statute,
 particularly one which fails       25X1
 to promise eventual independence,
 will significant)  affect the
 Algerian impasse.
 THE OMANI REBELLION
 The occupation of Nizwa
 and other key villages in cen-
 tral Oman by forces of the
 Sultan of Muscat, led and sup-.
 ported by the British, has
 ended the initial phase of the
 Omani uprising.  The, rebellious.
 Imam of Oman and his brother
 Talib, prime mover of the re-

 INDONESIAN ELECTIONS
 Incomplete returns from
 the 10 August elections in
 West Java show that the Mas-
 jumi retained first place in
 that area but that the Commu-
 nist Party made considerable
 gains.  The Communists won in
 Bandung, the provincial capital,
 by a landslide vote, and are
 also leading in four of the
 provinces's nine regencies, with
 the Masjumi holding first place
 in the other five.
 Communist electoral gains
 throughout Java have resulted
 primarily from the-direct and
 indirect support given the
 party by President Sukarno and
 the party's campaign tactic of
 identifying itself with him.
 The party's intensive campaign-
 ing, backed by ample funds, was
 also an important factor.  The
 Communists were considerably
 more efficient than their op-
 position in getting their own
 following to the polls and ap-
 pear to have been supported by
 most of the younger voters, in-
 cluding those who have reached
 voting age since 1955.  As a
 result, they have made substan-
 tial inroads into the National
 Party's vote of 1955 and also
 have cut into the following of
 the Moslem parties.

 have announced a desire to co-
 operate against the Communists,
 but have no definite  plans.
 In an obvious effort to counter
 effective non-Communist co-
 operation, Communist Party
 Secretary General D. N. Aidit
 has urged that the non-Commu-
 nists join the Communists in
 "joint administration and joint
 responsibilities" in further-
 ing President Sukarno's "na-

 .has pointed out publicly that
 parties participating in an
 anti-Communist front would be
 "turning their backs on Sukarno,"

 would have his blessing.
 Leading anti-Communist

 Pathet Lao representatives in
 a coalition government and ap-

 can eventually maneuver the
 Pathets into a position where
 they will no longer constitute
 a threat to the royal govern-

 with Interior Minister Katay,
 has evolved an elaborate plan
 whereby the government will

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 August 1957
 The long-standing dispute
 between South Vietnam and Cam-
 bodia over several offshore
 islands 'in the Gulf of Siam has
 recently taken on new impor-
 tance.   Military moves by both
 countries in the area have
 raised the risk of serious local
 incidents.
 Cambodia is increasingly
 interested.in the security of
 its maritime approaches. as work
 on its new deep,..water port. on
 Kompong Siam Bay progresses.
 The Cambodian navy in recent
 months has undertaken "flag"
 patrols to several disputed
 islands off the South Vietnam-
 ese-Cambodian coast.  -Small
 Cambodian marine gar-
 risons have been
 posted on some of the
 islands, and more are
 planned.   The pres-
 ence of French ad-
 visers aboard the
 Cambodian craft may
 have restrained to
 date more aggressive
 moves by the Cambo-
 dians.
 South Vietnam
 has reacted by send-
 ing two reinforced
 Vietnamese marine
 companies to Phu Quoc
 Island.   The Cambo-
 dian government,
 viewing this move as
 a "menace" to its
 new port, has moved
 up long-range guns
 to Ile a 1'Eau off
 the northwest tip of
 Phu Quoc.   Cambodia's
 control over Ile a 1'Eau and
 nearby Ile du Milieu is par-
 ticularly resented by Saigon.
 Last year, President Diem seri-
 ously? considered military ac-
 tion to oust Cambodian troops
 from these islands.
 The Vietnamese government's
 growing conviction that Cambo-
 dia"is deliberately providing
 a staging area for anti-Saigon
 dissident forces along its
 border with South Vietnam is
 an additional sore point in the
 relations between the two coun-
 tries.   Cambodia, for its part,
 considers recent military moves
 by South Vietnam--including
 several border incursions in
 pursuit  of ~ 'dissident  bands
 --as a menace to its security.
 Any military action be-
 tween Cambodia and South Viet-
 nam, both of whom receive Ameri-
 can military assistance, would
 hamper efforts to develop re-
 gional anti-Communist strength.

 DETERIORATING LABOR SITUATION IN INDIA
 Despite the last-minute
 cancellation of the government
 employees' strike planned for
 9 August, New Delhi's handling
 of the situation is likely to
 alienate the employees and
 result in increased Communist
 influence among them.   Although
 the government granted some
 face-saving concessions to the
 unions, the basic reason for
 the cancellation was passage on
 6 August of 'an emergency anti-
 strike bill empowering the gov-
 ernment to fine and imprison
 the labor leaders and fire
 striking employees.
 Some 500,000 employees in
 the postal, telegraph, civil
 aviation, and other departments
 planned to strike for increased
 wages to meet the higher cost
 of living and to force the Con-
 gress. Party to carry out its
 pre-election promise to raise
 wages.  The government took the
 position that it could not af-
 ford to grant extensive pay
 raises lest the wage drive
 spread through the economy
 during an inflationary period
 when the goals of the Second
 Five-Year Plan were already in
 jeopardy.
 When talks in late July
 between Prime Minister Nehru
 and the union leaders failed
 to produce a settlement, the
 government pushed through an
 emergency bill over bitter op-
 position protests giving the
 administration.wide powers to
 outlaw strikes in essential
 services.   Home Minister Pant,
 a leader of the right-wing group
 in the cabinet, forced the bill
 through despite the doubts of
 the cabinet ministers most di-
 rectly involved.  Nehru's in-
 decisive handling of the bill
 left the impression that he
 lacked enthusiasm for it.   He
 apparently yielded for fear
 that a nationwide strike would
 disrupt production at a crucial
 point in the five-year plan.
 The Indian government has
 steadily become more conserva-
 tive in its labor policy as it
 has acquired new employees fol-
 lowing the nationalization of
 the airlines and life insurance
 companies and the growth of
 state-owned industrial enter-
 prises.   The government's labor
 policies are less favorable to
 its employees than are those of
 the large private employers.
 The American embassy com-
 ments that the long-range of -
 fects of the antistrike bill
 may be to cripple the Congress-
 affiliated labor unions'. pros-
 pects for organization of the gov-
 ernment employees, to strengthen
 the power of the Communist Par-
 ty among them, to alienate them
 from the government, and to give
 the Communists an opportunity
 to contrast the "prolabor" rec-
 ord of the Communist ministry
 in Kerala State with the "anti-
 labor" acts of the central eov-
 ernment.

 PEI PI NG DRAFTING:. 19:5.8 ':ECONOM I C
 Peiping is apparently well
 along with the formulation of
 its 1958 economic plan, which
 will launch China's Second
 Five-Year Plan (1958-1962).
 Noting that excessive debates
 and tardy decisions on past
 plans have led to needless
 difficulties, Peiping says
 it began work on the 1958
 plan early in June, even be-
 fore the 1957 plan was pre-
 sented to the National People's
 Congress on 1 July.   Peiping
 estimates that a final draft
 of the 1958 plan will be ready
 in mid-December,  three to five
 months earlier than usual.
 The general lines of the
 1958 plan, were outlined on 10
 August by Po I-po, who is in
 charge of formulating yearly
 plans.   While no specific tar-
 gets were given, Po's remarks
 support earlier speculation
 that Peiping is scaling down
 the original version of the
 Second Five-Year Plan and is
 placing greater stress on do-
 mestic industry to support in-
 dustrialization.   Po opposed
 the importation of any machines
 which can be made, however
 poorly, in China. He went on
 to say that the 1958 foreign
 trade plan must be "exceeding-
 ly flexible" and "adaptable to
 new situations."
 BULGARIANS IN THE USSR FOR
 To help reduce unemploy-
 ment in Bulgaria,   surplus
 workers have been recruitdd
 during the past several months.
 to work in the USSR.   Those
 workers, with their families,
 have been transported-via the
 Black Sea to Odessa and Batu-
 mi, then routed on to their
 destinations.   In all, about
 10,000 workers have "volun-
 teered" to work on state farms,
 in mines, and on various con-
 struction projects in the USSR.
 PLAN
 Several months previously,
 Peiping had indicated that in-
 vestment in 1958 could not be
 "markedly increased" over that
 of 1956.   Po revealed that in-
 vestment in 1958 will be used
 to "reinforce the weak links"
 in the economy, identified by
 Po as agriculture and those
 industries producing raw
 materials and fuels.   He prom-
 ised that expenditures for
 national defense would be
 further reduced and said a
 part of the nation's machine-
 building industry had already
 been converted from military
 to civilian production.
 Apparently, the rigid
 austerity characteristic of
 1957 will be continued, and
 the Chinese consumer can look
 for little improvement in his
 situation.   Po admitted that
 development of consumer goods
 industries is lagging behind
 that of the rest of the econ-
 omy4,but':iftsisted that in-
 vestments in such industries
 must be reduced in 1958.   He
 pointed out that unused pro-
 ductive capacity already exists
 and that any,further ..expansion
 of consumer goods industries
 must await a prior increase in
 the output of the agricultural
 products which support them.

 dates were postponed from March

 The first groups departed from
 Varna on 21,, .'22., and 23 June,
 according to Sofia radio, amid
 ceremony and praise.: for their
 desire to participate in "the
 great socialist construction"
 taking place in the Soviet
 Union.   More than 3,000 work-
 ers were transported on the
 Ukrainia in late;  June and early
 July to Batumi, thence by rail
 to Baku, where they boarded Cas-
 pian Sea vessels for Krasnovodsk.
 Many of these were destined to
 work on state farms in the
 Uzbek SSR and the Kazakh SSR,-
 and about 1,000 were to be em-
 ployed in the construction of
 the Karaganda combine, a met-
 allurgical plant at Temir Tau
 in the Kazakh SSR?
 The Ukrainia also carried
 at least 2,500 workers to Odessa
 during this period.  Of these,
 215 were construction workers
 en route to Magnitogorsk, 100
 were miners going to the Nov-
 gorodskaya mine at Stalino,
 and 1,094 were destined for.
 coal mines in the Donbas, ac-
 cording to Sofia radio.
 Direct pressure probably

 :15 August 1937.
 HUNGARIAN REGIME CRACKS DOWN ON ITS OPPONENTS
 The Kadar regime continues
 to arrest  actual or potential
 opponents to strengthen its hold
 on the country, thus deflating
 hopes openly expressed by Hun-
 garians that changes for the
 better might occur in Hungary
 following the June shake-up in
 Moscow.   Only farmers have'es-
 caped the full force of the re-
 gime's repression,
 The total number arrested
 since the campaign began on 17
 July is probably nearing 10,000;
 Those affected,. all of whom are
 alleged to have manifested op-
 position to the regime during
 and after the uprising, include
 workers and youths--some of
 them Communists--former offi-
 cials of the Horthy regime,
 members of the once powerful
 Smallholders Party, and Roman
 Catholic priests.   The arrests
 may have a subsidiary objective
 of providing evidence to refute
 charges contained in the UN
 special committee report on
 Hungary.
 Concurrently the regime
 has been stifling independent
 criticism and muzzling intel-
 lectuals toward whom some con-
 ciliai~tory gestures had earlier
 been made.  The regime has re-
 cently shaken up the country's
 educational Institutions, in-
 stalling collaborators in key
 spots and removing all persons
 even lightly tainted with sympa-
 thy for the national uprising.
 Culture Minister Kal.lai on.4.
 August declared that all "con-
 sciously harmful elements" had
 been removed
 The regime.in recent weeks
 has also attacked workers, whom
 it.had earlier handled with kid
 gloves.   Transport Minister
 Kassa, an old-time Stalinist,
 announced on 11. August that a
 purge had been carried out on
 the,railroads and that elements
 who had openly participated in
 counterrevolutionary activities
 had ; been.. removed.   Repressive
 measures. in time may be launched
 against factory and construction
 workers, who in. the past  two
 weeks have criticized the re-
 gime's new wage-norm measures.
 The regime has not cracked
 down as yet on the peasants, al-
 though recent arrests of Small-
 holder Party leaders may fore-
 shadow such a move,   Aware of
 the critical importance of food
 production, the regime is tak-
 ing long-term measures to build
 up party strength in the coun-
 tryside, and is permitting the
 peasantry considerable autonomy.
 There has,. been little in-
 dication that the Kremlin is      25X1
 prepared to "sanction any genuine 25X1

 gary,
 Any far-reaching measures o

 There is, however, growing pres-
 sure throughout the area to in-
 crease such trade.   This re-
 newed interest stems from de-
 sires to market surplus agri-
 cultural production and to take
 advantage of bloc offers of
 commercial credit which would
 conserve small gold and hard-
 currency reserves.
 Argentina and Cuba--two of
 the three Latin American coun-
 tries having the largest trade
 with the bloc--have already
 demonstrated interest in re-
 versing the sharp 1956 decease
 in this trade.   Argentine trade
 alone dropped from $188,000,000
 in 1955 to $91,000,000 in 1956.
 Argentina's minister of commerce
 and industry stated in late May
 that his country desires to in-

 $51,500,000 worth of sugar to
 the USSR and East Germany this
 year, almost tripling its 1956
 total trade with the bloc.
 Brazil, the bloc's second
 largest trading partner in Latin
 America, increased its trade
 only slightly to $85,700,000
 in 1956.   A larger increase may
 result from the current visits
 to the bloc of various members
 of Brazilian state legislatures.
 Some 23 deputies from the state
 of Pernambuco were invited to
 attend the :Moscow Youth Festival
 and subsequently to act as a
 "trade commission representing
 northeastern Brazil" in a vir-
 tually expense-free tour of
 other bloc countries.   Similar
 invitations were reportedly re-
 ceived by other state legisla-
 tures, including that of Minas
 Gerais, which was invited to
 send five members of its com-
 mittee on steel industries to
 inspect steel installations in
 Poland.
 Uruguay's trade with the
 bloc-4-though-still in fourth
 place--increased 43 percent dur-
 ing 1956 because of a sharp
 rise in imports to use accumu-
 lated credits, and its officials
 have expressed interest in
 further expansion.   Signature
 of a payments agreement with
 Communist China was
 delayed in early June
 by internal political
 maneuvering rather
 than by opposition to
 the agreement.
 A campaign to
 promote coffee sales
 to China and the USSR
 as well as elsewhere
 to counter an "ever-
 increasing surplus"
 was urged by the Co-
 lombian representa-
 tive at a meeting of
 the Coffee Federation
 of Central America
 and Mexico last May.
 Sim lar  a ti ents
 and pressure from Saivacioran
 coffee growers have resulted in
 Salvadoran consideration of a
 trade agreement with Poland,
 which would be the first Central
 American trade agreement with
 the Soviet bloc.  Costa Rica is
 considering the barter of sur-
 plus tobacco for Czech manufac-
 tured goods, which are finding
 increasing acceptance in Latin
 America.

 HAITIAN POLITICAL SITUATION
 Haitian national elections
 reportedly postponed are now
 promised for sometime next
 month.       Behind-the-scenes polit-
 ical maneuvering and some popu-
 lar dissatisfaction with mili-
 tary rule have combined to keep
 tension high.
 The issue of general elec-
 tions, which was at least partly
 responsible for unseating four
 preceding provisional govern-
 ments, is the military junta's
 most immediate problem.   Already
 postponed three times, "free
 elections" has become a politi-
 cal panacea''popularly believed
 to offer the only solution to
 Haiti's problems.   Any discern-
 ible attempt to rig the elec .
 tions or to delay them unreason-
 ably would, as in the past,'pro-
 voke violence.   On 3 August,
 the junta, headed by Brig. Gen.
 Kebreau, issued a'communiqu6
 committing itself to holding
 elections during September,'
 thereby alleviating some of the
 tension caused by its failure
 to publish an electoral decree.
 or relatively free elections.
 Supporters of other leading
 candidates may, however, pro-
 mote unrest in an attempt to
 prevent an election rigged in
 Duvalier's favor.
 Certain political factions,
 particularly those representing
 Magloire interests, are reported
 attempting to postpone the
 Kebreau.'s recently adopted
 independent attitude has weak-
 ened claims that elements con-
 trolled by Paul Magloire--the
 dictatorial president ousted
 last December--were influencing
 him to arrange the election of
 a Magloire candidate.   Kebreau
 is now rumored to support the
 candidacy of Dr. Francois Du-
 valier, believed by many ob-
 servers to have the best chance
 of winning either "official"
 elections or to have the presi-
 dent chosen by political bar-
 gaining in an elected legisla-
 ture rather than by direct popu-
 lar vote as promised by the
 junta.   By delaying the elec-
 tions, Magloire elements would
 hope to create enough popular
 opposition to the junta to cause
 its ouster and give them a         25X1
 chance to step in.   At present
 the junta appears ca able of
 maintaining control.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 COMMUNISTS WIN BRITISH GUIANA ELECTION
 In view of Dr. Cheddi
 Jagan's victory in the 12 Au-
 gust election, Governor Renison
 will probably appoint sufficient
 nominated members  .to  give
 Jagan's Communist faction of
 the People's Progressive Party
 a working majority in the Leg-
 islative Council of the colony.
 Jagan's success shows the
 failure of British efforts to
 promote more moderate leaders
 since the suspension, of the
 constitution in 1953, when
 Jagan was also the chief polit-
 ical leader.
 Jagan and his followers
 won nine of the 14 elective
 Legislative Council seats.
 Jagan's bitter rival, Lyndon
 Forbes Burnham--who broke with
 Jagan in 1956--gained three
 seats for his faction of the
 PPP.   The British reported much
 local disappointment before
 the election that Burnham and
 Jagan and his wife Janet had
 not been able to settle their
 differences; there have been
 no indications yet that they
 will cooperate.   Two moderate
 parties, the United Democratic
 Party and the National Labor
 Front, won one seat each.
 In view of Jagan's elec-
 toral majority, Governor Reni-
 son began consultations with
 him on 15 August about becoming
 chief minister and probably
 will soon appoint sufficient
 Jaganrfollowers to give him a
 working majority.   Jagan told
 the press on 15 August that he
 is "prepared to play ball with
 the governor" in forming a gov-
 ernment.   The governor is em-
 powered to appoint up to 11
 members who, together with
 three top government officials
 and the 14 elected members,
 form the 28-member Legislative
 Council.
 The governor has some con-
 trol over the government's
 action by his power to suspend.
 or_ddla.y legislation and to
 revoke his nominations.   Should
 disorders develop, a British
 company. is available outside
 the capital and a bill was re-
 cently introduced to permit
 the conversion of the police
 into a military force in an
 emergency.
 Although Jagan might work
 within the existing constitu-
 tional framework initially,
 both he and. Burnham have de-
 manded radical constitutional
 revisions to permit early in-
 dependence.   Burnham, who would
 accept independence within the
 Commonwealth, recently sought
 the aid of British members of
 the House of Commons to change
 the constitution.   Jagan seeks
 complete independence and is
 opposed to joining the develop-
 ing West Indian federation.

 PART III
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 GOMULKA'S POLAND TODAY
 The wave of nationalist
 emotion that swept Gomulka into
 power has subsided. The re-
 gime is making some progress
 toward broadening its popularity
 by allaying serious public griev-
 ances notably, in the spheres of
 religion,.nationalism and agri-
 culture.   Dissatisfaction is
 growing, however, particularly
 among the workers, whose status
 has not improved materially.
 The regime's effectiveness in
 dealing with this problem has
 been hampered by continued weak
 party control in many local
 areas,
 At the present time, the
 outlook for Gomulka is favor-
 able despite serious labor un-
 rest.   His leadership will
 probably be confirmed at the
 party congress in December,
 and the.present Polish policies
 will in all likelihood continue
 in 1958.
 Although Gomulka is a loyal
 Communist, his internal policies
 and political outlook,vis-a-
 vis the Soviet Union confirm
 him as a deviationist among bloc
 leaders.   The Soviet leaders
 have serious reservations about
 many of Gomulka's policies and
 about the Polish armed forces
 under Gomulka's control, which,
 from their point of view, are
 unreliable.  For the foreseeable
 future, however, the USSR will
 probably publicly endorse the
 Polish regime for lack of any
 practical  alternative.
 Gomulka reportedly has been
 in ill health and should he be re-
 moved from leadership for rea-
 sons of health in the near fu-
 ,.ture, serious problems of sta-
 bility would arise.   He probably
 would be succeeded by a collec-
 tive leadership of men close to
 him who would attempt to con-
 tinue his present policies.
 Otherwise, and particularly if
 the Natolin Stalinist faction
 should seize power, a crisis
 might develop within the party
 and country serious enough to
 bring about political and pos-
 sibly military intervention by
 the USSR.   Since military inter-
 vention would doubtless set off
 a large-scale Polish uprising,
 it is unlikely that the Soviet
 leadership would intervene mili-
 tarily except-as a last resort.
 Although Gomulka is a pop-
 ular figure, the Polish people
 as a whole remain anti-Communist.
 Gomulka's strength continues to
 rest more on his symbolization
 of opposition to elements the
 Poles detest most--the Soviet
 regime and the Stalinists--than
 on programs which are widely
 supported.  Thus, as the Polish
 internal situation stabilizes
 and fear of a reversal of the
 progress made in October de-
 clines, his popular support may
 decline also.
 Internal Party Support
 Party support for Gomulka
 has apparently increased since
 the party's ninth plenum both
 among the party central com-
 mittee and the rank and file.
 Extreme elements which have
 opposed his policies have been
 discredited in some cases and
 brought into line in other cases
 and are probably incapable of
 forcing significant alterations
 in the Gomulka program.
 The June-Soviet party
 plenum provides Gomulka with a
 strong precedent in dealing
 with the opposition, especially
 the Natolin Stalinist faction.
 If Gomulka is able to consolidate
 his position at the December
 party congress, the Stalinists
 will thereafter constitute a
 decreasingly serious threat to
 his leadership.   His reliance
 mainly on centrist forces within

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 August 1957
 the party to consolidate his
 power appears to have been a
 necessary expedient, and does
 not mean he has altered his
 political outlook.        Gomulka
 evidently continues to believe
 that his policies as  outlined
 in October 1956 are in the best
 interests of the Polish nation.
 The Intelligentsia
 The intelligentsia has be-.
 come somewhat reconciled to the
 Gomulka regime.  The extreme
 liberal group has lost both
 numbers and fire.  Censorship
 is a continuing source of bit-
 terness, but the regime's will-
 ingness to open the country to
 some Western cultural influ-
 ences and its abandonment of
 the demand for "socialist real-
 ism" have somewhat softened the
 extreme liberals' opposition
 to Gomulka.   In addition,
 stricter regime censorship poli-
 cies, and a more realistic ap-
 praisal of the danger posed by
 .the Stalinists, have tempered
 their extremist demands.  How-
 ever; in the future the dilemma
 between allowing intellectual
 freedom and the necessity to
 limit broad ideological discus-
 sion will continue tobe a major
 problem for the regime.
 The Church
 The Gomulka regime has
 secured valuable political.sup-
 port on critical occasions from
 the Roman Catholic Church in
 Poland, and their agreement
 signed in November 1956 extend-
 ing major concessions to the
 church has been implemented.
 without serious repercussions.
 Both church and state in Poland
 are in basic agreement on two
 issues:   it is to the advantage
 of both to   coexist without open
 recrimination and to keep na-
 tionalism and anti-Soviet feel-
 ing among the populace under
 control.   It seems likely that
 some of the church's demands
 for additional concessions may
 be granted, and a major rift
 appears improbable, at least
 prior to the party congress.
 The Peasants
 The Polish farmer's faith
 in the permanence of his rela-
 tive freedom of iniative in
 agriculture has been strength-
 ened by the regime's progres-
 sive repeal of laws designed
 to further the socialization
 of agriculture.   Peasants are
 cultivating more land and mak-
 ing.greater investments than
 ever before.  This year's crops
 promise to be the nation's
 largest since the war.  Any
 reversal of agricultural policy
 would immediately stimulate
 overwhelming peasant opposition,
 and is-therefore unlikely.
 The Workers
 Industrial workers have
 attained the least improvement
 in their status of any segment
 of the Polish population.   An
 unequal distribution of wage
 increases and a subsequent
 stoppage of all wage raises
 have caused considerable dis-
 satisfaction.
 There are indications that
 the regime may be unable to hold
 the line at the present wage
 level.   Early this month three
 strikes of serious proportions
 were reported in the meat pack-
 ing,chemical, and transport in-
 dustries.  The first two were
 said to have been settled only
 after significant wage increases
 and "concessions" had been
 granted by the government.   The
 third and largest, however, was
 apparently dissolved with only
 a token concession.
 Such disturbances could
 set off a chain reaction of
 worker demands and government
 concessions resulting in still
 greater inflationary pressure
 on an already strained econ-
 omy.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 August.1957
 The workers' councils are
 popular on the whole, and in
 some cases have managed to ex-
 ceed their limited jurisdiction.
 According to the regime, they
 now exist in about 70 percent
 of the country's industrial in-
 stallations.  In some cases they
 abolished the hated norm-piece-
 Work wage system and have helped
 to assure a steady flow of raw
 materials. The prospects for
 .above-plan industrial produc-
 tion are promising, though
 largely contingent on Soviet
 raw materials.  The production
 of consumer goods is being
 boosted, as is that of building
 materials, to meet the acute
 housing shortage.
 Foreign Policy
 Poland's geopolitical po-
 sition, as well as the impor-
 .tance it attaches to its re-
 covered territories, limits
 Gomulka':s flexibility in the
 foreign policy field.  His for-
 eign policies will probably
 continue essentially to con-
 form to those of the bloc as
 long as his own promises of
 noninterference in Polish in-
 ternal affairs are not com-
 promised.  Although suspicious
 of the West, Gomulka acknowl-
 edges the Western heritage of
 Poland's culture.
 The regime looks to both
 China and Yugoslavia for moral
 support on its internal poli-
 cies.  The Poles believe spe---
 cific expressions of Chinese
 support will be made during
 Mao Tse-tung's prospective trip
 to Warsaw.   Poland's official
 relations with Yugoslavia have
 been cautious during the period
 of fluctuating Soviet policy
 toward that country, but fre-
 quent exchanges of Yugoslav-
 Polish delegations have con-
 'tinued.   Since the Soviet par-
 ty plenum in June,. favorable
 official and press references
 to Yugoslavia have increased
 markedly in Poland, and consulta-
 tions between Gomulka and Tito
 appear a distinct possibility.
 arricial Soviet support of-the
 Gomulka regime has been increas-
 ingly warm in public pronounce-
 ments since the Polish ninth.
 plenum and the June plenum in
 Moscow.   Fear in official Polish
 circles of Soviet intervention
 in Poland has subsided.  As
 Gomulka consolidates his posi-
 tion within the country, the
 possibility of.direct Soviet
 alteration of Polish internal
 policy diminishes and his for-
 eign policy will probably be-
 come increasingly independent.
 The regime's policy toward the
 West appears to be geared to
 avoid anything which the USSR
 is known to oppose, while it
 the same time expanding in all
 directions not specifically
 condemned by Moscow.
 Poland is likely to be-
 come more closely and more
 rapidly tied to the West than
 any other bloc nation.  New
 contacts should gradually
 diminish Gomulka's personal
 distrust of the West, and in-
 crease pressures for greater
 contact with the West from
 other ranking Polish leaders..
 Any economic aid ext.ended.to
 Poland would help Gomulka to
 remain in power and encourage
 him to develop more independent
 relations with Western countries,
 though he probably would not
 alter his basic ties with the
 bloc.
 USSR.
 As long as Gomulka con-
 tinues in power, the Soviet
 leaders will have to cope with
 the spread of heretical ideas
 and practices to the other
 satellites and possibly to the

 EUROPEAN FEDERATION:   PROSPECTS AND PROBLEMS
 With French National As-
 sembly approval, in July, the
 treaties establishing EURATOM
 and the European Economic Com-
 munity (Common Market) will al-
 most certainly come into force
 about next January.   The pro-
 ponents of European unity are
 now turning to the perplexing
 problems of consolidating their
 victory.   The difficulties
 which confront them are in
 part of their own making:   the
 treaties are inadequate instru-
 ments and the entire effort
 could still come to naught.
 The real challenge, however,
 derives from the fact that,
 with EURATOM and the Economic
 Community about to be put into
 force, the goal of a federated
 Europe becomes a practical pos-
 sibility--provided its advo-
 cates can cope with the multiple
 implications its achievement
 would involve for Europe, for
 the Atlantic community, and
 perhaps, in,the long run, for
 the balance-of world power.
 Politics and Ideology
 The importance of the 'is-
 sues at stake has its origins
 in the historic development of
 the European movement and a
 basic conflict within it which
 has never been resolved.  From
 the beginning, the idea of
 European cooperation was con-
 ceived as the best solution to
 the three fundamental problems
 of postwar Europe--political
 and economic rehabilitation,
 mutual guarantees against a re-
 vival of German power, and the
 permanent reconciliation of
 French and German national in-
 terests.   These were the prac-
 tical political objectives of
 the Brussels pact of 1948, the
 Council of Europe, and the Or-
 ganization for European Econom-
 ic Cooperation (OEEC), and they
 were the ultimate goals of the
 Coal-Steel Community (CSC) as
 well as of the abortive European
 Defense Community.   (EDC)

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 15 August 1957
 While there was a general
 acceptance of the "idea of
 Europe" as the keystone of
 European reconstruction, there
 was never an equal measure of
 agreement as to how these ob-
 jittives were  best  to  be
 achieved.   On the surface a
 disagreement over methods, the
 latent dispute was in fact a
 fundamental difference over
 ideology among those who in-
 sisted on bringing to the Euro-
 pean movement the diverse phil-
 osophies of previous political
 experiences:   the formalism of
 the French, the empiricism of
 .the British in the organization
 of the Commonwealth, and to a
 considerable degree the federal.
 development of the United States.
 Often troublesome and de-
 laying, this basic conflict
 .came to a head in 1950, with
 the British. in effect relin-
 quishing their major role in
 the European movement to the
 French.   By deciding at that
 time to proceed  with the
 Schumann Plan without the par-
 ticipation of London, the six
 continental countries  which
 eventually formed the CSC ac-s
 cepted the French and American
 idea that.a united Europe should
 be a federation in which common
 institutions would exercise
 "sovereign" powers granted it
 by a constitution.
 They also accepted a basic
 strategy which they believed
 would bring federation about:
 (1) supranational powers would
 be progressively increased un-
 til European institutions be-
 came the dominating political
 factor on the Continent;  (2)
 only those countries willing to
 accept the supranational thesis
 would participate initially;
 and (3) the resulting community
 or communities,, as an "attract-
 ing nucleus" of an expanding
 federated state, would be open
 to. countries which at first
 -might stand aside.
 The Last Chance
 for a situation which would
 truly test the validity of their
 thesis.   Influenced by the pros-
 pect in 1950 of a temporary
 surplus of steel. in relation to
 existing demand, they chose first
 to apply it to regulating the
 continental market for coal and
 steel.   It is not without sig-
 nificance that the British gov-
 ernment later signed an associa-
 tion agreement with the Coal-
 Steel Community, yet the impact
 of the experiment was on the.
 whole too small--on members and
 nonmembers alike--to set in mo-
 tion the dynamics that had been
 hoped for.
 With the European Defense
 Community, however, the federal-
 ists--in the widely shared be-
 lief that the USSR was about to
 repeat in Western Europe the ag-
 gression which. had been committed
 in South Korea--erred in the
 other direction by attempting
 to resolve within the European
 framework a problem which proved
 in fact capable of resolution
 only within the framework of a
 broader European organization--
 the Western European Union (WEU)
 --and.NATO.
 In EURATOM and the Economic
 .Community, however, there is
 reason to believe that the pro-
 ponents of federation have been
 offered both their best and prob-
 ably their last chance.   In the
 eyes of the pro-Europeans, four
 major crises since the defeat
 of EDC have produced a "deep
 acceptance of the idea of Europe"
 which never existed before:
 (1) A major energy short-
 age has developed which, unless
 the resources of the Continent
 are combined to combat it,
 threatens Europe with economic
 stagnation in a matter of a
 relatively few years.
 (2) Europeans want for
 themselves a standard of living
 which is feasible without infla-
 tion only within the framework
 of amass market and the bene-
 fits such a market would bring
 The continental federalists           in specialization, mass produc-
 have?had to wait seven years                                  tion, and higher productivity.

 (3) The "loss" of the Suez
 Canal, coming as it did after
 the postwar Anglo-French re-
 treat all over the world, has
 further demonstrated the weak-
 ness of Europe's two most power-
 ful nations to defend their
 vital interests, especially
 when those interests are not
 identical with the objectives
 of American foreign policy.
 (4) The relaxation of
 world tensions since the death
 of Stalin has raised the specter

 ment in which Europe might par-
 ticipate--if at all--only as a
 junior partner of the United

 therefore, a "logical necessity."

 has. come into force, there will
 be..no way back.   There will
 only be a way aheadf toward a
 fuller economic community which
 will lead toward. a political
 community.   Without the Common
 Market, the political community
 is merely a serious parlor game
 which commits no one in any
 way.   With it, however defec-
 tive it may be, it is impossible
 to escape a political arrange-
 ment which exercises authority
 over the policies of its.mem-
 ber countries."
 Observers have noted even
 in the interim committee for
 the Economic Community a "col-.
 legial spirit" devoted to the
 protection of the "interests
 of the six."  The hope is en-
 tertained, moreover, that this
 attitude will continue in the,
 commissions for EURATOM and
 the Economic Community and that
 from them will emerge a "Euro-
 pean dynamism."  The theory of
 "self-generation" is also ad-
 vanced:   thus, the countries
 are so deeply committed by
 the treaties that even their
 deficiencies, notably in ag-
 ricultural and financial policy,
 will necessitate a greater and
 greater intervention in the
 political decisions which are
 ordinarily reserved to sover-
 eign governments.
 Doubts and Fears
 While the obstacles to a
 "political Europe" are still
 enormous, the best proof of
 progress may well be the re-
 actions of those who are second-
 arily concerned.   In the many
 controversies which have been
 raised over the potentialities
 of the Economic Community,.
 there has-been a strong assump-
 tion that those potentialities
 are very great.   Those who
 emphasize the necessity of broad-
 er.and looser organizations for
 Europe and the Atlantic com-
 munity seem to fear the political
 as well as economic influence of

 Austria, whose trade is
 chiefly with these countries,

 them on the political grounds
 that a renunciation of sover-
 eignty would involve a threat
 to its neutrality.   Spain and
 Portugal, after consulting
 with each other on the economic
 integration of Europe, have
 specifically disavowed associa-
 tion with arrangements which
 might affect the "Iberian na-
 tional character."  And the
 Soviet Union has drawn a care-
 ful-distinction between inof-
 fensive loose agreements on
 "economic and similar problems"
 and the Common Market which it
 contends will be "subordinate
 to the aggressive aims of NATO."
 On the economic side, it
 was inevitable that the pro-
 spective combination of six

 power would provoke interest
 and concern among all countries
 with which they trade and com-
 pete.   To the extent, laoreov:er,
 that the treaties excite the
 suspicion that the six intend
 to reserve  to themselves a
 favored world position with
 protective tariffs, the dismay
 and alarm of those who are left
 out is quite justified.  What
 is considerably less justified
 is criticism which fails to
 recognize that a customs union
 by its nature is discriminatory
 and that lower costs and cheaper
 exports are the legitimate ad-
 vantages which the Economic
 Community seeks to attain.
 Britain: An Evaluation of Policy
 No response to the renewed
 vitality of Europe has provoked
 greater perplexity on the Con-
 tinent than the attitude of
 London, and the. evolution of
 British policy has been par-
 ticularly revealing of the spe-
 cial difficulties the Economic
 Community seems to pose.
 As in the case of the CSC,
 the British government at first
 stood aside, evidently expect-
 ing that the treaty negotia-
 tions would never bear fruit.
 When the negotiations continued,
 however, with increasingly fa-
 vorable prospects, London de-
 nounced the project in the OEEC.
 This was succeeded in mid-1956
 with an offer of economic ac-
 commodation--the "free trade
 area" proposal.   Last December
 when the negotiations had
 reached their final and most
 crucial stage, Foreign Secre-
 tary Lloyd suggested a reor-
 ganization of Europe's institu-
 tions in accordance with a
 "grand design"--a proposal
 which,, in view of its timing.
 and conception, was greeted on
 the Continent in general with
 marked suspicion.
 The free trade area pro-
 posal, however, was accepted
 by many as a new and significant
 shift on the part of London in
 the direction of a pro-Euro-
 pean policy.   This belief was
 buttressed, in particular, by
 the pro-European record of the
 new Macmillan cabinet in Janu-
 ary 1957, and by the continuing
 eagerness of his government to
 pursue negotiations within the -
 framework of the OEEC.   The evi-
 dent intention of London to re-
 establish with this proposal
 the leadership of the European
 movement which it had relin-
 quished some six years before
 has been marred, however, by
 the supplemental remarks of
 some officials, which, while
 "Do I understand Oarold,
 ' hat" you are propo541$
 nlarria, e or Ju5t tI,AT we
 should live ToPetljer?"
 not reflecting the program of
 the Macmillan government, seem
 to suggest no change of heart.
 Thus last June Sir David
 Eccles, president of the British
 Board of Trade, shocked a Dutch
 delegation by describing the
 CSC High Authority and the pro-
 posed commissions for EURATOM
 and the Economic Community as
 "irresponsible aggregates of
 European civil servants"--ir-
 responsible, he explained, be-
 cause they are "not answerable
 to the British House of Commons."
 In the course of a public appeal
 for Commonwealth support of
 the free trade area, Eccles
 earlier observed:   "Twice in my
 lifetime Western European na-
 tions, or one of them,  (attempted)

 to dominate others and form a
 hostile bloc across the channel
 which would threaten the very
 life of the United Kingdom.
 Now, six countries in Europe
 have signed a treaty to do ex-
 actly what, for hundreds of
 years, we have always said we
 could not see with safety to
 our own country.   It would not
 be in the interests of the
 Commonwealth that it should
 happen."
 While the "grand design"
 is now the subject of a leisure-
 ly study from which it may
 never emerge, the first general
 discussions on specific free
 trade area proposals will prob-
 ably occur at a ministerial-
 level meeting next October.
 The  crosscurrents in this
 October meeting may be as por-
 tentous as any in Europe's re-
 cent history.
 To many in Continental
 Europe, it will appear eminently
 desirable that Britain, what-
 ever concessions may be. required
 because of Commonwealth ties,
 be drawn closer to the Continent
 with commitments from which
 there is no escape.   Many will
 see a vital and necessary role
 for the United Kingdom in Europe
 as a counterweight to the power
 of Germany, as a balance to
 the protective bias of France,
 and as a link to the United
 States.  Many have recognized
 that this will require from
 London,- in reassessing its
 status.as a world power, a
 greater adjustment of its role
 as an independent mediator be-
 tween.the Continent and Wash-
 ington than it has yet made.
 But the question will be
 raised:   What sacrifices  will
 British participation entail
 for the Europeans?  Without the
 free trade area, the "attractive
 force" of the Common Market re-
 mains intact, and those coun-
 tries--notably Denmark--which
 seem to hang in the balance
 might have no alternative to
 full membership in the Economic
 Community and the relinquish-
 ment of the measure of sover-
 eignty this would involve.
 Moreover, if London seriously
 believes that an integrated
 Europe per se is a "hostile
 bloc" and that the free trade
 area is a means to thwart its
 achievement, even the long-run
 chances for fruitful coopera-
 tion may be slim.   In that case,
 by conceding too much, the
 Europeans may incur the risk of
 sacrificing the only set of prin-
 ciples which have offered any
 serious hope of uniting Europe.
 THE OUTLOOK FOR INDEPENDENT MALAYA
 Overshadowing the orderly
 evolution of Malaya toward self-
 government--Which will be
 achieved on 31 August--is the
 long-range threat to its sta-
 bility and independence posed
 by the presence of the largest
 proportion of Chinese of any
 Southeast Asian nation--some
 38 percent of the total popula-
 tion.   Since the founding of
 the Malayan Communist Party
 (MCP), the Chinese have pro-
 vided more than 90 percent of
 its membership, and even among
 Malaya's non-Communist Chinese,
 large numbers are emotionally
 oriented toward mainland China.

 activities among the Overseas
 Chinese as a threat to develop-

 would prefer to keep Malaya's
 Chinese isolated "from any ex-

 While Malaya
 will probably follow
 a cautious pro-West-

 certain factors fore-
 shadow a gradual in-

 exert considerable in-

 India, which considers
 Malaya within its

 will also attempt to

 similar to its own

 have considerable im-

 tionalistic feeling, language,
 religion, and background.  The
 livelihoods of the two. largest
 races,ase, in the main, derived
 from.entirely, different forms
 of economic activity--commerce
 for the Chinese and agriculture
 for the Malays.
 The Malays have been the
 privileged group under the Brit-
 ish,'who have supported special
 rights for. them in landowner-
 ship, citizenship regulations,
 and government employment.  The
 Malays have been successful in
 incorporating most of these
 privileges in the new constitu-
 tion which will, they hope, pre-
 vent them from being overwhelmed,
 both politically and economic-
 ..ally, by the more aggressive
 and energetic-Chinese.
 The Chinese fear that the
 Malays will enact extensive
 anti-Chinese legislation.  Thue,
 despite their past aloofness
 from political activity, many
 .Chinese now feel they must work
 .for sufficient participation
 in, the government to guarantee..
 protection of their interests.
 Internal Politics
 The most hopeful develop-
 ment for the future stability
 of Malaya has been the emergence
 of the moderately led Alliance,
 which represents Malaya's three
 racial groups and which controls
 5.1 of the 52 elective seats in
 the, legislature.   It consists.-
 of.'the United Malay National
 Organization (UMNO), the Malayan
 Chinese Association (MCA), and
 the Malayan Indian Congress
 (MIC).   Because of its multi-,
 racial crake up  top Alliance
 must, on most issues, adopt a
 compromise position between
 extremist. Malay and Chinese
 demands.   There is, at present,
 no effective opposition to-'the
 Alliance, and its overwhelming
 majority in the legislature
 probably assures continuity
 and political stability until
 the elections scheduled for
 late 1959.
 Without the unifying issue
 of independence, however, the
 Alliance may 'find itself in-
 creasingly vulnerable both to
 internal divisive influences
 and to appeals aimed at its
 members by rival communal par-
 ties outside the Alliance plac-
 ing racial above national in-
 terests.
 The UMNO of Chief Minister
 Abdul Rahman, thanks to the
 overwhelming support given it
 by the Malay population, has
 dominated the-Alliance and.
 thereby the Federation govern-
 ment.  Almost all Malays are
 'automatically enfranchised, and
 have traditionallybeen favored
 in government employment.

 are in the main politically
 apathetic, few are qualified
 voters, and the Chinese: popula-

 Chinese who preserve their tra-
 ditions but feel their. first
 loyalty to Malaya, and two
 smaller but influential groups,
 the "Queen's Chinese" who look
 beyond Malaya to the UK and the
 Commonwealth, and the Kuomintang
 Chinese, loyal to Taiwan.
 Continued fragmentation of
 the Chinese community may pre-
 serve Malay domination of the
 political scene for the foresee-
 able future, and Malay predomi--
 nance.within a moderate confed-
 eration-of racial communities
 such as the Alliance may prove
 to be the only way to maintain
 political stability.
 The primary threat would
 be an effort by ultranational-
 1st Malay politicians to use
 latent Malay fear and distrust
 of Chinese to destroy the UMNO
 and with it the Alliance.  Dis-
 criminatory legislation or a
 use of police powers threaten-
 ing vital Chinese economic and
 cultural interests would antag-
 onize and unite the fragmented
 Chinese, thereby playing direct-
 ly into the hands of Peiping
 and the MCP.
 Malayan Communist Party
 The armed strength of the
 Communist terrorist forces is
 approximately 2,000.  Chinese
 comprise an overwhelming major-
 ity of the Malayan Communist
 Party membership and support,
 although the party,is now
 making,, considerable effort to
 increase its strength among the
 Malay and Indian populations.
 It has been evident for
 several years that the party
 wished to abandon its unsuccess-
 ful policy of armed rebellion
 and leave the jungle in order
 to enlarge its covert subver-
 sive activities, especially in
 labor unions and Chinese schools.
 Efforts to negotiate a settle-
 ment have failed, however, and
 the remaining terrorists are
 too well known by the security
 forces to enable them to return
 to political activity without
 a settlement.  Communist lead
 ers may therefore try to solve
 their dilemma by sacrificing
 the jungle organization in order
 to concentrate all available re-
 sources on subversive activities.
 The main danger of success-
 ful Communist subversion appears
 to be in the Chinese middle
 schools, which are inadequate
 and turn out poorly educated
 and discontented young Chinese
 who see little opportunity in
 Malaya.  The Chinese schools
 appear. more vulnerable to sub-
 version than the other primary
 Communist target, the labor un-
 ions, mainly because non-Com-
 munist unions present a fairly
 effective counter to the Com-
 munists.
 The amount of direction
 .and support for Communist
 activity in Malaya furnished
 by the Chinese Communist Party
 is assumed to be extensive.
 Now that political independence
 is virtually achieved, Peiping
 is already publicizing demands
 for "economic" freedom for
 Malaya and for legal recognition
 of the MCP, apparently as first
 steps in its long-range goal of
 making Malaya a Communist satel-
 lite.
 Economic Outlook
 Relatively speaking, Malaya.
 is not overpopulated and, if
 political conditions remain
 stable, Malaya's economic out-
 look appears bright.   A merger
 of Malaya and Singapore, desired
 by the latter, would be eco-
 nomically beneficial to both,
 but is, at least for the time
 being, politically impossible.
 The addition of Singapore's
 1,000,000 Chinese would relegate

 a minority in their own country.
 Malaya's economy, however, re-
 mains vulnerable to the fluctua-
 tion of tin and rubber prices
 on world markets.
 'The Federation government,
 through a system of subsidies,
 is encouraging the planting of
 high-yield rubber trees to keep
 natural rubber in a favorable
 competitive position vis-a-vis
 synthetics.   Significant expan-
 sion of tin production during
 the next few years is unlikely
 because of uncertain market
 conditions and the difficulty
 encountered by the British and
 Chinese tin producers in find-
 ing and acquiring suitable tin-
 bearing lands,-which are large-
 ly owned by the Malays.
 New Constitution
 The new constitution pro-
 .vides for a constitutional
 monarchy.  There will be a bi-
 cameral parliament, including
 a senate and .a house of repre-
 sentatives.                         The term of the
 house is limited to five years.
 The prime minister must be a
 member of the house and enjoy
 its confidence, while other
 cabinet officers may be members
 of either the senate or house.
 This legislative organization
 will not be implemented im-
 .mediately, however, for the
 present partly elected and part-
 ly nominated unicameral legis-
 lature will remain in office.
 until 1959.
 After independence, Islam
 will become the state religion,
 and Malay and English will be
 official languages.  There is
 a bill of rights guaranteeing
 basic liberties.  A federal
 system will be maintained and
 each of the 11 states will
 adopt a parliamentary democracy
 with an elected unicameral leg-
 islature, a responsible head
 of government, and a constitu-
 tional ruler.
 Defense Arrangements
 While many Alliance leaders
 are favorably disposed toward
 SEATO, they may conclude that
 membership is politically in-
 expedient, especially since the
 proposed UK-Malaya defense
 treaty will tend to align them
 with SEATO without the political
 liabilities of formal member-
 ship.   The treaty will provide
 for the maintenance of strategic
 British military bases in Malaya.
 for the country's defense and
 for continued British assistance
 against the terrorists..   In ad-
 dition, the Malayan armed forces
 will continue to receive British
 equipment and training.
 Malaya's potential role in
 'Southeast Asian, defense looms
 large in Australian and New
 Zealand defense thinking.   Both
 countries now have small forces
 in Malaya as part of the Common-
 wealth "strategic pool," to be
 augmented rapidly in the event

 SOVIET. BLOC CIVIL DEFENSE (1956-1957)
 Following Marshal Zhukov's
 increased emphasis on civil de-
 fense in his speech before the
 Soviet 20th party congress in
 early 1956, programs for civil
 defense and civil defense train-
 ing have made good progress in
 the USSR and,in certain Euro-
 pean satellites.   Prior to 1956,
 Soviet bloc civil defense prep-
 arations seemed largely directed
 toward countering the effects
 of World War Ii-type attacks,
 but since then preparations
 have been geared more closely
 to defense against atomic weap-
 ons.
 In the past year.  and a
 half, much atomic information
 has been released to civilians
 in the USSR, although descrip-
 tions of weapons effects have
 generally been limited to those
 associated with a Hiroshima-
 type atomic bomb.   Increasing
 numbers of heavy bunker-type
 shelters have been reported
 seen in the satellites, special.
 civil defense battalions have
 .been formed in Hungary, and
 civil defense supplies have
 been issued there and in-Czecho-
 slovakia and probably elsewhere
 in the satellites.   Organiza-
 tion of civil defense in 'the
 satellites'continueS to reflect
 Soviet leadership.
 In addition to the costly
 installation of shelters in
 new buildings, the Soviet bloc
 is carrying out other expensive
 .projects, such as civil defense
 'training, construction of "outer
 belt" highways, issuance of
 .some civil defense supplies,
 and other shelter construction.
 Soviet Civil Defense
 Civil defense preparations
 have been accelerated in the
 USSR in the last year.   Public
 participation has been encour-
 aged through regional defense
 conferences, new periodicals,
 new atomic civil defense man-
 uals,television broadcasts,.
 I
 and training films.   Civil de-
 fense exhibits, posters, and .
 well-equipped mobile demonstra-
 tion units have also been used.
 The 30,000,000-member Vol-
 untary Society for Cooperation
 with the Army,,Air.Force, and
 Navy (DOSAAF) is the organiza-
 tion principally responsible
 for civil defense promotion and
 training.   Aided by the Red
 Cross and other organizations,
 it is engaged in a massive
 program to, give the Soviet popu-
 lation atomic civil defense
 training.   A corps of instruc-
 tors has been trained in a net-
 work of DOSAAF air defense,
 schools for this purpose.
 Completion of initial
 atomic defense training of the
 population has been announced.
 Although it is doubtful that
 all citizens were indoctrinated
 under the program,. training has
 probably-been widespread in
 DOSAAF, the Communist Party,
 and key industries.   Completion
 of civil, defense courses is
 required, and those workers who
 do not pass an.examination are
 required to repeat the course.
 To supplement the atomic de-
 fense course, every citizen of
 the USSR over 16 years of age
 is to receive 22 hours of in-
 struction in a new defense
 course,_to be completed by the
 end of.1958, on antiair and
 atomic, bacteriological, and
 chemical (ABC)  defense, ac-
 cording to a recent announce-
 ment.
 Auxilia.r.y medical person-
 nel are receiving special courses
 in atomic civil defense, and
 other workers expected to fill
 civil defense operational roles
 are probably being given spe-
 cialized.instr.uction..  Air raid
 drills and a step-up in civil
 defense training in industrial
 plants.since 1955 have been re-
 ported from several areas.

 The partial decentraliza-
 tion of industrial and govern-
 mental control in the USSR may
 improve civil defense organiza-
 tion and operations by permit-
 ting better integration of vari-
 ous civil defense groups at
 the local level as well as more
 local decision-making.
 Urban civil defense fire-
 fighting crews will have spe-
 cial shelters available in the
 outskirts of populated areas,
 according to a Soviet article
 of last year, and other civil
 defense services presumably
 will have dispersed facilities.

 tronic plants, petroleum re-
 fineries, chemical plants,
 cement plants, and food-proces-
 sing plants.  Civil defense
 bunkers are also to be built
 in county seats and in each
 administrative district of
 Budapest.
 According to the specifi-
 cations, the roof, walls, and
 base floor of the shelters are of
 concrete at least -.R.6 feet thick
 The shelters are equipped with
 air locks and ventilating equip-
 ment; an independent water-sup-
 ply and power=generating equip-
 ment; medical supplies includ-
 ing a store of narcotics, bone
 setting materials, minor surgi-
 cal supplies, and X-ray appa-
 ratus; radio and telephone
 service; and two days' food
 supply.
 a civil defense headquarters
 bunker in Hungary, the first
 noted in the Soviet bloc, as
 having walls and ceiling of
 Hungary has been building air
 raid shelters since 1951, and
 heavy bunkers have been com-
 pleted in munitions factories,
 steel mills, radio and elec
 reinforced concrete three feet
 thick.   The command-post in-

 a radio station, gasoline gen-
 erator, telephone exchange,
 and sanitary facilities.

 Hungary several years ago and,
 is
 scheduled to train seven 500-
 man battalions a year from 1955
 through 1958.   Inductees have
 attended training two evenings
 a week for nine months and full-
 time summer field training for
 three months.   This has been
 followed by monthly refresher
 meetings.
 Personal equipment issued
 to members included police-
 type uniforms, rubber suits,
 oxygen masks, aid pencil-shaped
 dosimeters.   Unit equipment
 included mobile decontamination
 apparatus and chemical detector
 tubes.   A civil defense head-
 quarters in one city was re-
 ported to have work clothing,-
 protective clothing., shoes,
 500 blankets, 500 flashlights
 with batteries, 3,000 first-
 aid kits, radios, beds, engi-
 neer tools, movie projectors
 and films, but only one Geiger
 counter.

 mmeica  supplies stored at one
 location which, apparently com-
 prised a complete field hos-
 pital of 100 beds; Hungarian
 pharmacies were maintaining
 stocks of emergency medicines
 and supplies of a first-aid
 nature.
 Civil defense preparations
 in the other satellites are in
 varying stages of development.
 Bulgarian and Czechoslovak
 civil defense is probably as
 well advanced as that of Hun-
 gary.   Poland has been very
 active in initiating civil de-
 fense measures during the past
 year. Rumania has made only
 modest progress, and East Ger-
 many recently announced that It
 would goo
 measures.
