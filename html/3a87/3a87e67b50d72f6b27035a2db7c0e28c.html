Two years ago the Ch.inee communiets held thcir 
ninth party congress to eark the ?victorioue con-
clusion of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution 
and to announce the formati of a new ruling elite 
ostensibly more responsive to Mao Tse-tung end his 
heir-designate, Defense Minister Lin Ping. The sur-
vivors of the "revolution," who were named at the 
? congress to fill all of the 25 seats on the polit-
buro, were not, however, a loyal phalanx of dedi-
cated Maoists. Instead, they represented an uneasy 
conglomerate of disparate civilian and ailitarY 
terent groups thrown up by the twists and turns of 
the campaign launched in 1966 to purge and revitalize 
the nation"s power structure. Their relations in the 
? past had been marred by bitter personal quarrels and 
rivalries, and despite the legitimacy conferred on 
them by election to the politburo, it was clear that 
,all but 4 few superannuated figures would wish to con-
solidate their political positions further in antici-
pation of the eventual passing of Mao. tor nearly a 
year this fregile coalition presented virtually an un 
changing public face. Beginning in March 1070, how-
ever, a native of unexplained shifts in the politi-
cal hierarchy in Peking strongly suggested that the 
leadership was entering a period of extended t444i4A 
and more direct confrontation--a confrontation in-
tensified by the process of reconstituting china's 
party and government apparatus and promoting *eonomic 
and social recovery following the turmoil that had 
? disrupted national life during the Cultural Revolu-
port was p cored by the Offiaa at Cur 
Z4genoe and dia *sad within CIA..

67 when the Wuhan Military Region Commander

and &subsequent series of editorials inspired by 
' the radical* that called for the "small handful' of 
revisionist leaders in the army to be *dragged out' 
touched off a wave of Red Guard attacks on PLA 
' leaders. At the same time, there were indications 
that the notorious "May 16 Corps'--an ultraleftist 
group beaded by second echelon CRG leaders, such as 
journalists Wang ..t end Chi Pen-yu--was maneuvering 
to oust premier Chou Rn-lai and several military re-
gion, commanders. All of this radical sound and fury 
came to an, abrupt halt in September when a number of 
important regional military leaders who feared for 
their.political survival and who vented to restore 
order apparently joined Chou Rn-lai in braking the 
radicals drive to intimidate or purge their opponent' 
in the central government and regional military hier 
archies. This was not a revolt against MAO, but it 
did ?demonstrate an increased ability and willingness 
on the part of the conservative forces to coalesce 
when directly threatened by the ultraleftists and to 
attempt to deflect Mao's decisions to 4 course more 
ceptable to themselves. 
The end of the radical thrust was signaled 
when the vitriolic Madame Mao (Chiang C)Ung) appar-
ently was forged to beat a retreat. She gave a major 
speech on 5 September in which she praised the PTA's 
political performance, denounced the "Mir 16 Corps,' 
and demanded that leftist Red Guard fictions turn in 
their arcs and cease criticising local military au-
thorities. At the same time, several CRG leaders 
of the "kw 16 Corp.' were purged, and the group 
ostensibly was dissolved. Thus, the When Inciden 
earned the CRG considerable enmity within military 
circles $ but it also probably convinced the CRG

the political danger to themselves if China's prin-

by February 1968 only five of the original 17 members 
of the CPO still survived. The remaining leaders-

peared that the comparative stability of the Chi-
nese leadership and the unifying influence of Men 
Tse-tung would prevent A protracted power struggle 
until Mao's departure from the scene. The launch-
ing of the Cultural Revolution proved, however, that 
for some time past mao had not been undisputed leader 
of the party, that his own power interests and ideo-
logical predilections could prove a disunifying 
factor, and that the struggle among his heirs was 
already under way. This struggle continues to be 
complicated by major questions concerning the limits 
of Mao's authority, the capabilities of his desig-
nated successor, the persistence of deep-seated 
quarrels over the proper mix of pragmatic and doc-
trinaire prescriptions in policy-making, and the 
heating up of volatile personal rivalries within the 
p7litburo. The succession problem is further compli-
cated because the probabilities are high that death 
or ill health might scion strike down any or all of 
China's top three leaders. Mao at 77 seems to be 
Ln good health, but how much longer he will be around 
is doubtful. Lin Piao although a mere 63, has a long 
history of debilitating ailments and might not even 
last as long as Mao. 'Chou En-lei at 73 seems full

mao's determination to avert any possible chal-

in the army, party or government apparatus. The 
fact he felt the need for these designations, how-
ever, seems to reflect considerable internal tension 
and a realisation that the $11000OsiOA could prove 
difficult. Vinally, the highly personalised na-

mg the Chinese succession question, there can be 
no definitive assessment of how the present leader-
ship is going to cope with the problem. At the mo-
ment, the influence of the comparative moderates 
in the military administrator group on the politburo 
seems stronger than that of the radical Maoists. In 
assessing the political future of china's leadership, 
however, the problem is not simply to determine which 
leader is up or down at a given moment but also to 
understand the manner in which compromises are made 
between ideological and pragmatic considerations. 
Will the leadership, for example, continua to toler-
ate the politically unpalatable but economically 
essential institution of private plots and material 
incentives? Will it recognise the limited appeal of 
abstract revolutionary theory in motivating human be-
havior and instead emphasise nationalistic and per-
sonal goals, both of which are hotter understood and 
generally supported by the people? These ars the ' 
questions at the root of the conflict at the top in 
china today. At present, time seems to be on the 
side of those leaders who are generally more con-
cerned with political, social, and economic ration-
alisation than with the pursuit of pure revolution.
