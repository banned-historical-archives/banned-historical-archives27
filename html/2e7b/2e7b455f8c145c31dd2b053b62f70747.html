SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS: SLOW BUT STEADY PROGRESS 
SUMMARY 
Since General Secretary Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech in July 
1986, the USSR has moved to address directly China's fundamental 
security concerns while China has become more receptive to Soviet efforts 
to project flexibility on the issues. The range and level of political 
contacts have grown and trade has risen dramatically from USS300 million 
in 1982 to roughly USS2.6 billion. Cultural and other non-political 
contacts are now almost daily occurrences; border tensions have been 
reduced; progress has been made on the border demarcation issue: and 
each side has begun to portray publicly the other's experience in economic 
reform in a positive light. 
Although the Chinese continue to resist Soviet calls for a summit 
and resumption of party-to-party ties, the likelihood of a high level 
meeting within the next year--between foreign ministers, prime ministers, 
or presidents--has increased. Moscow seems pleased with the pace of 
progress to date and is unlikely to force that pace by making any grand 
gestures that would put Beijing on the spot. Instead Moscow is likely to 
continue to nudge Beijing to upgrade relations by making small unilateral 
gestures to insure progress continues toward eventual rapprochement. 
These could include a withdrawal of a small number of troops from the 
border, more movement on a Cambodian settlement, or concessions on the

border dispute. Moscow may also probe for new areas of parallel interest, 
such as concern over Japan's defense policy. 
While Beijing appears to have decided that Gorbachev is sincerely 
striving to reduce Sino-Soviet tensions as part of his effort to create a 
more peaceful international environment in which to pursue domestic 
reform, Chinese Kremlin-watchers continue to debate the extent of 
Gorbachev's flexibility and his staying power in the face of continued 
opposition at home. Moreover, the Chinese believe that the Soviet Union 
will remain the principal threat to China over the long term, and recognize 
that Soviet and Chinese aspirations in Asia will continue to be at odds. 
In his speech at Vladivostok in July 1986, Secretary General Gorbachev made it 
clear that Moscow intends to increase its political and economic influence in Asia. The 
chief target of Soviet courtship in Asia is China. Both Moscow and Beijing seek a stable 
and non-confrontational relationship--especially along their border--in order to 
concentrate on domestic reforms and modernization. Both sides also seek to use their 
improving relations with each other to increase their leverage with Washington and their 
ability to maneuver within the Sino-Soviet-US strategic triangle. 
Moscow seeks a normalization of relations with China marked by the resumption 
of party-to-party ties. It has also repeatedly called for a summit and would probably 
view one between Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping as a major step toward the resumption 
of party ties even though Deng is not the leader of the Party. The Soviets may still have 
some hope of bringing the Chinese back into the "socialist" fold eventually, but for now 
and the foreseeable future would gladly settle for a China which is equidistant from the 
US and the USSR. Moscow would like the array of Sino-Soviet contacts eventually to 
match China's existing relationships with the US--including regular high level visits and 
some form of military contact. At a more specific level, Moscow may want to codify 
the relationship with a statement of principles--similar to the declaration on "basic 
principles of relations" signed by the US and USSR in 1972--which would include some 
form of non-aggression clause. 
Moscow is taking advantage of warming Soviet-US relations in the wake of the 
INF agreement and the Soviet-US summit in Washington to encourage China to respond 
to Soviet initiatives to improve bilateral relations. General Secretary Gorbachev's call 
for a summit in his interview with the Chinese international relations journal, 
Liaowang--the first Chinese interview with a Soviet leader in more than two decades--
was clearly intended to capitalize on any nervousness in Beijing created by the Soviet-
US summit in Washington to encourage the Chinese to upgrade the level of the Sino-
Soviet political dialogue. Although the Chinese told the US Embassy in Beijing that 
Liaowang did not have prior Ministry of Foreign Affairs permission for the interview 
and Chinese press accounts of the interview omitted Gorbachev's call for a summit, we 
suspect Beijing may have intended to prepare educated Chinese readers for--and remind 
the West of--the possibility of an eventual breakthrough in Sino-Soviet political contacts. 
Moscow, for its part, probably is convinced the publication of the interview is 
proof that Soviet efforts to address Beijing's three obstacles to normalization--the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan, Moscow's support for Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, and 
the Soviet military buildup in Mongolia as well as along the Sino-Soviet border--are not

? 
being dismissed in Beijing as merely rhetoric. A Soviet Foreign Ministry official told 
US Embassy officials in Moscow in February that the interview could not be interpreted 
as anything else but a "calculated political move" by Beijing. 
The recent warming of US-Soviet ties has apparently left Beijing wondering 
about the implications for China. Chinese officials and scholars have expressed concern 
that Washington may devalue its relations with Beijing as warmer US-
Soviet ties develop and may be less receptive to Chinese positions on a range of bilateral 
issues such as technology transfer and Taiwan. 
The Soviet-US summit and INF agreement also coincided with a period of Sino-
US tensions over Tibet, human rights, family planning, and Washington's decision last 
October to suspend a planned liberalization of sensitive high technology exports to China 
because of Chinese silkworm missile sales to Iran. Although the US lifted its freeze on 
further liberalization of technology exports to China in March, China may still conclude 
that progress in its relations with  the USSR might make the US more responsive to 
Chinese concerns on other issues. 
Growing Political Contacts 
Under Gorbachev the range and level of political contacts have grown, although 
both sides acknowledge that these are still limited. Chinese leaders believe that 
Gorbachev sincerely desires better relations and are more receptive to Soviet political 
overtures, although still careful to avoid any appearance of party-to-party relations. 
Moscow has begun briefing the Chinese after Soviet-US arms control talks in Geneva 
and sent Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev to Beijing after the Reagan-Gorbachev 
summit in Washington. The Foreign Ministers meet regularly at the opening of the UN 
General Assembly, but China has refused to schedule an exchange of foreign ministers' 
visits agreed to in 1985. Moscow and  Beijing have also begun to exchange views on 
regional issues such as Latin America. 
Many of the delegates visiting each country serve in both a governmental and 
party capacity. Moscow tends to handle contacts with the Chinese in party channels to 
ease the way for the formal resumption of party ties while China handles them only in 
governmental and nonofficial channels, reiterating that it is not ready to restore party 
ties. 
Soviet press coverage of the Chinese party congress and Chinese media treatment 
of the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution last fall illustrate Soviet courting of 
China through Party channels and China's positive but cautious response through non-
party channels. The Soviets publicized Gorbachev's message of congratulations to Zhao 
Ziyang on his election as General Secretary of China's Communist Party--congratulations 
never acknowledged in the Chinese press--and Party Secretary Dobrynin received the 
head of the Chinese Friendship Association delegation attending the Bolshevik 
Revolution anniversary. For the anniversary, Zhao Ziyang--using his non-Party title of 
Premier of the State Council--as well as others sent greetings to President Gromyko and 
Premier Ryzhkov. The Chinese also hosted a reception in the Great Hall of the People 
and had Vice Premier and Politburo member Wan Li--identified in Chinese media only 
in his governmental position--attend a reception at the Soviet Embassy. 
At a reception in February marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the 
Soviet Army, Soviet Defense Minister Yazov--in a speech subsequently cited without 
comment in the Chinese press--extended Soviet courting of China to the military sphere 
by putting a positive gloss on Soviet actions in the Far East and stressing positive 
changes in the military situation along the Sino-Soviet border. He noted that the

elimination of SS-20s in Asia under the INF treaty highlighted Soviet efforts toward 
military detente in Asia and claimed the Soviets had reduced the number of their troops 
along the Sino-Soviet border in addition to the partial withdrawal from Mongolia in 
1987. Yazov also sent greetings marking the 60th anniversary of the Chinese Army. 
Steady Progress in Non-political Spheres 
The range and level of economic, cultural, and scientific exchanges have steadily 
expanded since a sports agreement was signed in 1981. The Chinese have been more 
receptive to Soviet overtures under Gorbachev for expanding non-political contacts, and 
exchanges of visits to the respective capitals and even to local areas have become almost 
daily occurrences. Moscow sees the trend in exchanges in these areas as setting the stage 
for movement in political relations 
Trade has increased dramatically from SUS300 million in 1982 to SUS2.6 billion 
in 1986. Although it declined 20 percent last year, apparently because of China's 
inability to meet some of its supply commitments, Chinese dissatisfaction with certain 
Soviet equipment, and the decentralization of foreign trade mechanisms in both countries 
which hindered implementation of central directives at the working levels, the Soviets 
expect it to rise by 25 percent in 1988--a realistic expectation in our view--bringing it 
back roughly to 1986 levels. According to the US Embassy in Moscow, a Soviet official 
predicted in February that trade will return to the 1986 level but will not go beyond that 
in the near future because of temporary disruptions resulting from the recent 
reorganization of Soviet foreign trade mechanisms, lack of quality products to trade, and 
lack of real experience in modern economics. Another factor that will probably 
constrain trade is that both the USSR and China consider their access to western 
technology and trade with the West as more valuable than their economic ties to one 
another and will probably continue to export their better quality goods to the West 
instead of to each other. Disputes over product quality have already surfaced. 
Border trade has increased in importance now that local regions on both sides are 
allowed to engage in direct trade, and provinces not on the border are also permitted to 
trade goods through the border provinces. Such trade directly helps the depressed 
economies of border regions which cannot compete with the exports of the major 
populated areas and represents trade over and above that controlled by the annual 
bilateral agreements. Both sides are cooperating to develop the infrastructure to 
accommodate increased border trade, including a railway link between the capital of 
Xinjiang province in China and the Sino-Soviet border through the Dzungarian Gate, 
which is expected to become operational in 1991. According to Chinese media, Beijing 
issued a document in March designed to facilitate development of Xinjiang's export-
oriented economy. Growth in border trade, however, is constrained in the near term by 
the limited size of the Soviet far eastern market and the limited variety of products 
manufactured on both sides of the border. 
Scientific, cultural and academic exchanges occur almost daily in the outlying 
areas as well as in Beijing and Moscow. An intergovernmental plan for cultural 
cooperation for 1988-1990 was signed in December to further develop these contacts. 
Exchange visits of youth, trade union, media, medical and Academy of Sciences 
delegations have also become commonplace. Friendship delegations from individual 
cities have exchanged visits, and scholars have visited to learn about the other country's 
economic reform program. Student exchanges resumed in 1983 and contacts between 
Soviet and Chinese think tanks are growing.

These academic and think-tank exchanges have coincided with an increase in 
discussions and commentaries on the parallel nature of Soviet and Chinese reforms. 
Although each side realizes the limited applicability of each other's reforms, the fact 
that Soviet and Chinese media over the last two years have portrayed them in a positive 
light is a reversal of the critical nature of such commentaries in the past. The Soviets 
are no longer presenting the Soviet model of socialism as superior and a model to be 
copied by all socialist countries, and the Chinese no longer publicly belittle Soviet 
reform efforts as too little, too late. Soviet media portray the parallel interest in 
economic reform as an important area of common ground that can form the basis for 
closer bilateral relations across the board. The publication of Deng Xiaoping's selected 
works in the USSR and the publication of Gorbachev's book in China further underscore 
the growing interest in learning about one another's experiences with reform. 
Movement on the Obstacles 
At the ninth round of Sino-Soviet normalization talks in October 1986, Moscow 
altered its approach to Beijing's three obstacles to normalized relations by publicly 
abandoning its original position that these were "third country" issues that Moscow was 
not empowered to discuss. Although efforts to improve Sino-Soviet relations began 
under General Secretary Brezhnev, the agreement in 1986 to discuss these issues--not 
just listen to what the Chinese had to say about them--was a watershed and paved the 
way for the steady progress in the relationship to date. Since that time, the Soviets have 
withdrawn some troops from Mongolia and have agreed to withdraw from Afghanistan. 
Beijing seems to use the three obstacles as a tool to control the pace of progress 
in political relations. By reserving the right to determine whether Soviet actions on the 
obstacles are significant, Beijing can raise or lower the price to Moscow of improved 
relations. Beijing thus is capable of declaring at any time that Moscow has met China's 
concerns on the obstacles enough to warrant an upgrading of political relations, possibly 
to include a summit. 
Beijing, for example, has altered its position from demanding resolution of all 
obstacles to singling out Cambodia and changed its rhetoric from calling on Moscow to 
force Vietnam to withdraw to calling on Moscow to "urge" Vietnam to withdraw. In 
public and private comments, China continues to cite the Cambodian obstacle in order to 
counter Soviet claims of progress in relations. Nevertheless, the fact that China has 
singled out Cambodia as the main obstacle--and links it alone to a Sino-Soviet summit--
raises the possibility that progress on this issue alone could create an opening for a 
breakthrough in political relations. 
Cambodia 
The USSR  wants an eventual political solution in Cambodia, 
but its immediate objective is to convince Beijing--without alienating 
Hanoi--that it is trying to address Beijing's concerns on this issue. To this end, Moscow 
has stepped up the level of its involvement in the search for a negotiated settlement. 
Moscow has not yet, however, appeared willing to strain relations with Hanoi by 
publicly adopting positions that could undercut Vietnamese interests or through coercive 
action such as reducing military or economic aid--steps that could force an early 
Vietnamese pullout. Instead, Moscow clearly hopes that highly visible efforts to promote 
negotiations and private diplomatic pressure on the Vietnamese will be enough to 
convince Beijing of its sincerity.

--The Soviets publicly supported the talks in France in December and January 
between resistance leader Prince Sihanouk and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun 
Sen and provided financial and logistical support for the Hun Sen delegation, 
--A Soviet Embassy official in Beijing has confirmed to US Embassy officials 
that the Soviets, as reported in a Western press story, are willing to meet with 
resistance leader Prince Sihanouk. a Soviet 
Embassy official held an inconclusive meeting with Sihanouk's son, Ranariddh, 
before the January round of Hun Sen-Sihanouk talks--the first Soviet contact 
with Sihanouk's faction. 
--Moscow also publicly supported the Cambodian government's five-point peace 
proposal of October 1987, which calls for, among other things, a coalition 
government that would include  the three resistance factions and a senior 
government post for Sihanouk. 
Moscow may also be moving in private to go a step further toward satisfying 
China's demands that the USSR "urge" Vietnam to withdraw. 
the Soviets have begun to prod the Vietnamese more energetically to seek a 
political settlement. They are asking Vietnam to "retreat somewhat from its maximum 
demands" concerning Cambodia Moscow is talking directly  
to Hanoi's client regime in Phnom Penh about a settlement. 
 the Soviets are 
emphasizing to Vietnam their growing impatience with the stalemate in Cambodia and 
the economic burden on Moscow of Vietnam's occupation. 
The Soviets may be resorting to public pressure on Hanoi to withdraw from 
Cambodia. A report in the Western press in February quoted an unnamed Soviet 
diplomat in Beijing as saying that Vietnam would withdraw by 1990 because the burden 
of its presence in Cambodia was "intolerable"--leaving it ambiguous whether the burden 
was intolerable to Hanoi or to Moscow. A Soviet Embassy official in Beijing told the 
US Embassy that the article was meant as a hint to Vietnam of Moscow's dissatisfaction 
with the Cambodian situation. Despite the official's claim that the interview was aimed 
at Hanoi, however, the choice of a diplomat in Beijing to give the interview to the 
Western press suggests that the article was intended at least as much to impress China 
and the West as to prod Hanoi. In any case, the story was the first public statement by 
the Soviets about the financial burden of Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia. 
the Chinese believe the Soviets are becoming 
more forthcoming on the Cambodian issue. They told Under Secretary of State 
Armacost in November that the Soviets were somewhat more flexible during the 
discussions in Beijing in October, agreeing for the first time that Cambodia should  
emerge as a neutral country and offering to help bring about a political settlement. 
Beijing has also adjusted its position in the past few months to demonstrate a 
willingness to compromise. China's press offered support for Sihanouk's efforts in his

negotiate an agreement they cannot live with, they apparently recognize that Moscow, by 
pressuring Hanoi and Phnom Penh to negotiate with Sihanouk, has taken a step toward 
accommodating Chinese interests. 
Afghanistan 
Chinese officials have stated privately for years that the Soviet presence in 
Afghanistan does not threaten China, and Afghanistan has clearly been the least 
important of the obstacles to the Chinese. Nevertheless, the Chinese have reacted 
positively to Moscow's agreement to withdraw. Even before this agreement, China 
softened its usual media criticism on the anniversary of the Soviet invasion in December, 
and Chinese commentaries have highlighted Soviet efforts to create an acceptable  
environment for withdrawal. 
would be willing to cooperate in moving a settlement forward 
perhaps by participating in an observer force to monitor the Soviet withdrawal. 
The Military Buildup Along the Border 
The Soviets withdrew one of their five divisions from Mongolia last year, playing 
it up as one more unilateral Soviet gesture to reduce military tensions with China. They 
have given considerable play to the INF agreement in propaganda aimed at China, 
presumably because the Chinese have included the SS-20s in the Soviet Far East as part 
of the buildup of Soviet forces along the border. Defense Minister Yazov claimed in his 
speech in February that the USSR has not added to its ground forces in Asia for a 
number of years, and has not increased the size or scope of military exercises in the 
region. In fact, although the Soviets have kept the size of their exercises constant, they 
continue to modernize their ground, air, and naval forces in the region. 
China for its part, while privately recognizing the Soviet withdrawal of one 
division as a concession, minimized the gesture in its media and public comments. The 
Chinese media called for the withdrawal of all divisions from Mongolia and in Beijing's 
view, the Soviet military presence in Mongolia is only one Dart of the problem of the 
Soviet military buildup along China's northern border. 
increased civilian contacts--including border trade and 
the opening of river ports--suggests that tension has lessened somewhat along the Sino-
Mongolian and Sino-Soviet borders over the past four or five years. In fact, both sides 
played down a border incident in July 1986; the Chinese ignored a wayward Soviet 
missile which apparently landed on the Sino-Soviet border in September 1986; and they 
continue to ignore occasional Soviet aircraft intrusions into Chinese airspace. On the 
negative side, the Chinese do take exception to the Soviet reconnaissance flights over the 
sensitive Yellow and East China Seas--where Beijing conducts missile tests--which 
involve overflights of North Korean territory. North Korea granted the Soviets 
overflight rights--the first flight occurred in December 1984--apparently in return for 
Soviet promises to provide P'yongyang with advanced Soviet weapons. 
Moscow has proposed confidence building measures along the border such as 
notification of troop movements and mobilization and invitations to observe military 
exercises, but Beijing continues to insist that Moscow reduce its forces along China's 
northern perimeter first. Several factors could persuade Moscow to consider and 
implement substantial military drawdowns should it deem the political climate right for 
such a gesture:

--the improvement of Soviet monitoring capabilities and the substantial 
technological superiority over Chinese forces allows the Soviets to better monitor 
and control the border region. 
--the political leadership, already pressuring the Soviet military to reduce and 
conserve resources, may conclude that reducing tensions along the Sino-Soviet 
frontier is part of a set of conditions necessary to implement Gorbachev's plans 
to effect some reallocation of resources from the military sector to the civilian. 
--the warming of relations to date and increased economic ties, including border 
trade, have generally lowered tensions along the border and reduced--but not 
eliminated--the mutual perceptions of threat. 
--organizational and structural changes in Mongolia's four divisions will enable 
Mongolia to protect Soviet security interests to a greater extent in the future. 
The ongoing redeployment of Mongolian Army assets to the primary avenues of 
approach may be an indication of Soviet intentions eventually to shift  more of 
the defense burden to indigenous forces. 
Moscow probably would not offer significant troop cuts as a unilateral 
concession, despite its overall advantage in air and ground forces along the border, but 
would consider such a move as part of a broader political agreement. 
Progress in the Border Talks 
Although the border demarcation issue is not one of the three obstacles, the 
Soviets, in our view, regard a solution to the territorial dispute along the border as a 
prerequisite to any significant troop cuts. A breakthrough on the border issue could set 
the stage for progress on other issues as well. Soviet concessions on the border to date 
already signal to the Chinese that Moscow is now treating Beijing as an equal--a 
primary source of continual tension. 
Gorbachev broke the long impasse on the border issue at Vladivostok wheri he 
publicly announced Soviet agreement with the long-held Chinese position that the border 
passes along the main channel of the Amur River, in effect acknowledging Chinese 
claims that the disputed islands in the river are on China's side of the border. (This 
position was privately accepted by Soviet border negotiators since the 1960s, but the 
Soviets always excluded the main islands opposite the Soviet city of Khabarovsk) Two 
months later, in September 1986, Foreign Minsters Wu and Shevardnadze announced that 
both sides had agreed to resume border talks at the deputy minister level after a nine-
year suspension. Beijing and Moscow conducted a joint survey of the Amur River last 
summer and signed an agreement in November on the use of border water resources. 
The working group agreed in February to conduct joint aerial photography. The Soviets 
are certainly aware that aerial photography will show that the islands are on the Chinese 
side of the main channel. 
Nevertheless, the border talks most likely will be protracted. The last meeting of 
the experts group was in early April and focused on the technical aspects of organizing 
joint aerial photography of the eastern sector. Although we believe Moscow is prepared 
eventually to return the more than 700 smaller river islands to Beijing, the main sticking 
point in negotiations will probably be the fate of Tarabarovskiy and Bol'shoy 
Ussuriyskiy Islands (Heixiazi Dao) located directly across from Khabarovsk. The 
Soviets may eventually be willing to acknowledge Chinese ownership of those islands. 
Soviet Far Eastern Institute Director Titarenko told US Embassy officials in Moscow in

March that the Khabarovsk section of the border dispute was resolvable in that it was 
not essential to Beijing and therefore the Soviets could offer "attractive compensation." 
Alternatively, the Soviets may be prepared to cede those islands in return for some kind 
of assurances from the Chinese not to build any military or intelligence collection 
installations on the islands. Moscow will also probably be careful to claim that the 
natural flow of the river has changed the border in order to avoid setting a precedent 
that could apply to the Northern Territories claimed by Japan or to any other disputed 
territories along the USSR's borders. 
Domestic Constraints on Gorbachev 
Gorbachev could face opposition within the leadership to making concessions to 
the Chinese on troop withdrawals from the border or on the territorial issues. If so, the 
sharpest criticism would probably come from the military and key leaders sympathetic to 
military concerns such as KGB Chief Chebrikov and "Second Secretary" Ligachev- - 
whose views on defense are closer to those of the traditional military line than are 
Gorbachev's. They have been the most critical on domestic issues but have not yet 
addressed Asian relations directly. The military probably would oppose a return of the 
islands opposite Khabarovsk and would almost certainly disapprove of any Soviet 
proposal unilaterally to withdraw troops from the border area that could upset the 
current configuration of forces. Gorbachev would probably need tangible evidence of 
Chinese willingness to agree to a mutually acceptable border accord--possibly involving 
Chinese concessions on the Pamir area on the western sector of the border in exchange 
for Soviet concessions on the river islands in the east. He may also need assurances that 
the Chinese would be willing seriously to discuss mutual force reductions along the 
border, which he could probably sell domestically as a way to channel savings into the 
domestic economy. Gorbachev would probably also want a commitment from the 
Chinese to attend a summit or establish party ties. 
The Chinese Domestic Equation 
We can identify no strong pro-Soviet constituency in the Chinese leadership, and 
fear of imperiling crucial trade, technology, and other ties between China and the West 
inhibits even those who would like to see China follow a middle road between the 
superpowers. Many of the party have little interest in sharply improved relations with 
the Soviets. They see China's interests as best served by expanded contact with the more 
technologically advanced--and wealthier--West. Some leaders, especially those in their 
50s and 60s--many of whom are Soviet-trained- -support treating the two superpowers as 
more or less equivalent. Their statements suggest that they are not so much pro-Soviet 
as suspicious of the West. Some, such as Premier Li Peng, also have indicated that they 
believe greater economic ties with the Soviet Union would be advantageous to China. In  
particular, trade with the Soviets would preserve scarce foreign currency holdings. 
Perhaps the most important impediment to full normalization of Sino-Soviet 
relations is the firm opposition of China's top leader Deng Xiaoping. Deng is deeply 
distrustful of the Soviets and skeptical that greatly improved relations with the USSR 
would yield significant benefits for China. We believe he has already achieved his main 
goal--relaxation of tensions on the border. Deng tightly controls Chinese policy toward 
the Soviets, and whle some other senior leaders favor a less restrictive policy, they have 
been unable to influence this issue much. 
Deng has the support of senior military leaders, who tend to follow Deng's lead 
in foreign policy. Moreover, many of them share Deng's supicions, remembering Soviet

? 
failure to support the communists during the Chinese civil war and the experiences of 
the 60s. However, among the second-tier military leaderhip, which includes a number 
of Soviet-trained generals, there is some sentiment in favor of a middle course between 
the US and the USSR. 
After Deng's death, we expect some softening on the Chinese side; although the 
successor generation is not enthusiastic about the Soviets, most of them probably lack 
Deng's almost visceral dislike. For pragmatic reasons--trade advantage, cheaper goods, 
Soviet concessions, possible increased leverage in the strategic triangle--Deng's successors 
will probably accelerate China's gradual policy of relaxation. However, we doubt that 
they will take the step the Soviets want--party-to-party relations--soon. It remains  an 
unpopular and potentially politically risky move with few apparent gains for China. 
Outlook 
Moscow and Beijing appear to be moving toward an eventual rapprochement--
albeit far short of the close relationship of the 1950s. Beijing is giving Moscow positive 
signals while carefully controlling the pace. We expect Moscow to continue to try to 
nudge Beijing to upgrade political contacts by making more unilateral gestures perhaps 
including a withdrawal of a small number of troops from the border, more explicit 
public commentary on a Cambodia settlement, or concessions on the border dispute. 
Moscow may also attempt to elicit Beijing's public support in areas where parallel 
sentiments already exist such as on US policy toward Central America, SDI, and 
concerns about Japanese defense policy, as well as probe for new areas of possible  
convergence.  
Although unlikely, we cannot altogether rule out a characteristic "grand gesture" by 
Gorbachev to push the Chinese further. He is limited, however, in the areas in which 
he can make such a gesture. We do not believe, for example, that the Soviets are 
prepared to take the steps needed to prod the Vietnamese out of Cambodia, or to 
withdraw unilaterally a substantial number of their forces from the border. Since they 
have already announced their forces will withdraw from Afghanistan, the only remaining 
area for a grand gesture would be the border demarcation dispute--perhaps a unilateral 
announcement by Gorbachev that the Soviets have decided to give China the disputed 
islands opposite Kharbarovsk. However, Gorbachev is unlikely to "throw away" what 
could be an important bargaining chip in the future for an uncertain Chinese response. 
The Soviets have had less success eliciting a positive Chinese response when they have 
pushed hard in public for a leap forward in relations--the Chinese were slow to respond, 
for example, to the Vladivostok speech--and Gorbachev is unlikely to risk destroying 
the current momentum by putting the Chinese on the spot. Beijing is not now prepared 
to respond with a "grand gesture" of its own such as reestablishing full party-to-party 
ties, and would resent Moscow's effort to force the issue in this way. 
Short of an all-out push for a full normalization of relations--which probably 
would include occasional summit meetings, periodic high-level meetings, and the 
restoration of formal party-to-party ties--the way seems clear for an exchange of visits 
of foreign ministers, premiers, or presidents within the next year. Both sides agreed in 
principle to a foreign minister's meeting apart from the meeting held each fall at the UN 
General Assembly but they have never followed through. This agreement could be

reactivated and a meeting could be set in either Beijing or Moscow, possibly in 
conjunction with the border talks or normalization discussions. A resumption of some 
form of military contacts would also be a sign of significant progress in the relationship. 
Historical animosities, reciprocal perceptions of threat, and Chinese reticence to 
upgrade relations will probably prevent a return to the alliance relationship of the 1950s. 
The Chinese are sensitive about their sovereignty and position within the socialist 
community, and despite Soviet assurances that Moscow wants a relationship based on 
equality, Beijing will remain skeptical of Soviet overtures. Beijing also seeks to maintain 
an independent stance vis-a-vis Moscow and Washington and will avoid an alliance in 
order to maintain leverage within the triangle. Both countries need Western technology 
and capital for their respective modernization drives and China in particular would be 
careful not to jeopardize its access by entering into an alliance with the Soviets. 
Although a closer relationship may lead Moscow and Beijing to be tougher in 
their bargaining positions with the US--especially if both see their leverage in the 
strategic triangle as enhanced by closer relations--better Sino-Soviet relations would not 
necessarily have a negative impact on US interests across the board. Should the Soviets 
and Chinese, for example, begin to cooperate on such issues as jointly restraining North 
Korea or pressing Vietnam and the resistance toward a Cambodian settlement, this 
cooperation could have positive implications for stability in East Asia. At the same 
time, however, the Soviets and Chinese will continue to compete for influence elsewhere 
in the region, especially in Southeast Asia and eventually in South Korea.
