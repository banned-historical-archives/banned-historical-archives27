 Combat activity in the Taiwan Strait area has
 stepped up, including air and naval clashes and
 heavy Communist artillery bombardment of the Chin-
 men (Quemoy) area.                       The Chinmen Defense Command be-
 lieves.an attack on                            Tatam and Erhtan is imminent,
 and a Communist broadcast of 28 August warns that
 a landing on Chinmen is imminent.   The Communists
 continue to build up their strength in the strait
 and
 area
 ,
 have increased their groan   orces in  as   China.
 The Communists may believe that the bombardment of
 Chinmen and seizure of one of the smaller islands
 will seriously impair Nationalist morale and pave
 the way for capture of all the islands.  Chiang Kai-
 shek has indicated he would inform American officials
 before retaliating against the mainland.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 DE GAULLE AND FRENCH AFRICA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  . Page 1
 The coordinated Algerian National Liberation Front
 sabotage and terrorist attacks throughout France which
 began on 25 August may signal the opening of a campaign
 designed to encourage massive abstention of Algerians
 in the forthcoming French constitutional referendum.
 The FLN actions may also be intended as a warning to
 France that no solution is possible in Algeria except
 independence.   De Gaulle's assurances to tropical Africa
 that the overseas territories can opt for independence
 at any time will alarm rightists pressing for "total
 integration" of Algeria into France.   Approval of the
 constitution is still expected, but these developments
 may help deprive.De Gaulle of the overwhelming majority
 he hopes for.
 WORLD REACTION TO NUCLEAR TEST SUSPENSION ANNOUNCEMENT.    Page 2
 With few reservations, the free world welcomed the
 US-British conditional offer to suspend nuclear testing
 for a year beginning 31 October.   The French Government,
 however, made clear its intention to proceed with its
 nuclear weapons program.   Considerable British and other
 European press comment centered on the problem posed by
 Communist China's nonparticipation in the disarmament
 negotiations.   Although Moscow has not directly replied
 to the proposal, it is criticizing the delay in putting
 the suspension into effect and the conditions attached.
 UNEASY CHURCH-STATE TRUCE CONTINUES IN POLAND .  .  .  .  .  . Page 3
 The Gomulka regime has charged that the Catholic
 Church's preparations to celebrate Poland's 1,000th
 year are actually intended to create a climate for po-
 litical activity by the clergy.   The current regime at-
 tacks on the church are probably designed mainly to win
 Gomulka the support of rural party functionaries, who
 have long had difficulty in asserting their power in the

 Gosplan nevertheless retains control over the supply

 important supply movements among the republics.
 SOVIET SALES UPSETTING WORLD MARKET FOR TIN .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page 5
 Soviet sales of tin outside the bloc have in-
 creased nearly tenfold in the past two years.  They
 now threaten to disrupt the operations of the Inter-
 national Tin Council and thus cause new difficulties
 for the economies of Bolivia, Malaya, and other free
 world producers.   Metal sales are an important source
 of foreign exchange for the USSR, and Moscow, intent
 in addition on discrediting the Western tin manage-
 ment plan, will probably maintain       h level of
 sales of tin in the world market.
 RUMANIAN REGIME TIGHTENS DISCIPLINE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page 7
 The Rumanian regime is conducting a major drive
 against embezzlement of state funds and theft of pub-
 lic property.   Theft and corruption have reportedly
 cost the state nearly $250,000,000 in 1957-58.        The
 present campaign corresponds with a general effort by
 the regime since late spring to tighten internal dis-
 cipline-an effort reflected in a minor purge of the
 party central committee in June.   There are indications
 that the current drive will not be limited to the eco-
 nomic sphere, but may involve such elements as students,
 intellectuals, and party members.

 BURMESE GENERAL ELECTIONS EXPECTED IN NOVEMBER .  .  .  .  .  . Page 10
 Premier Nu has canceled the budgetary session of
 Parliament and is expected to call for general elec-
 tions in November.   The contest will be between the
 two factions of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom
 League (AFPFL) and the two factions of the National
 Unity Front (NUF). Since it is possible that no par-
 ty will gain a clear majority, Nu's faction of the
 AFPFL may again needaa coalition with the pro-Commu-
 nists in the NUF.   This would.undercut the premier's
 insistence on insurgent surrenders and might push Burma
 further toward the Communist bloc.
 SOVIET ARMS DELIVERIES TO AFGHANISTAN .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . Page 10
 Afghanistan has received additional arms, apparent-
 ly under the Soviet bloc assistance programs announced
 in August 1956.   The most recent deliveries may raise
 the total value of such assistance.   Since known bloc
 arms credits to Kabul total only $32,000,000, the USSR
 is probably giving Afghanistan substantial disco
 similar to those extended to Syria and Yemen.
 RECENT BY-ELECTION RECORD OF INDIA'S CONGRESS PARTY.  .  .  . Page 12
 The continued gradual decline of Nehru's Congress

 assembly and national parliament seats since the date
 of the last national elections in March 1957.           Congress
 party leaders recognize their organization's basic weak-

 The recent convention of the leftist but non-

 ty, took a cautious approach to the elections sched-
 uled for 23 November, probably because it is aware
 of the hostility of the military toward the party.
 The major achievement of the convention was to reaf-
 firm the leadership of former President Romulo Betan-
 court's moderate wing over the more radical youth ele-

 At the meeting of the Arab League foreign minis-

 mold the league into an instrument to further his as-
 cendancy in the Arab world.   He may bring about a re-
 organization under which the Arab states would relin-
 quish a portion of their cont     over foreign policy
 to a Nasir-dominated league.                                               25X1

 The ability of Ceylon's leftist labor unions to
 upset the island's economic and political stability
 has increased during the two and a half years of Prime
 Minister Bandaranaike's rule.    Strikes called by the
 most powerful unions, dominated by rival Communist
 leaders, have disrupted the operation of Colombo port
 almost continuously since late 1957. The government's
 recognition of the dangers created by irresponsible
 labor elements may eventually cause it to adopt sterner
 labor policies in areas of vital economic importance.

 Since Khrushchev became party first secretary in
 1953, an unprecedented number of persons assigned to
 key positions in Moscow and in the Russian federation
 (RSFSR) have been drawn from the Ukraine, where Khru-
 shchev was party chief for 12 years.   Ten out of 25
 members of the party's ruling body are or have been
 Ukrainian officials.  Many of these promotions reflect
 Khrushchev's preferential treatment of former associ-
 ates, who, he apparently feels, will be loyal to him.

 PART I
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 TAIWAN STRAIT SITUATION.
 The  build-up      of  Chinese
 Communist strength in the Fukien
 area continues, and significant
 combat activity has occurred,
 particularly in the Chinmen
 (Quemoy) area, where over 100,-
 000 rounds were fired into the
 islands by the Chinese Commu-
 nists through 28 August.
 That  greater  harassment,
 possibly even an invasion at-
 tempt on the Chinmens, may be
 expected is indicated by a 28
 August Chinese Communist broad-
 cast calling upon the National-
 ist troops to surrender and
 warning of "imminent landings
 on Chinmen"   This  is  the
 strongest commitment to spe-
 cific action made thus far by
 the  Communists.  The heavy
 shelling of Tatan and Erhtan
 on 27 August has led the Chin-
 men Defense Command to specu-
 late that an attack on these
 two islands is imminent.
 The shelling of Chinmen
 began on 23 August and appar-
 ently took the Nationalists by
 surprise, as they sustained
 about 300 casualties, mostly to
 personnel who were unable to
 reach shelter.  More than 20,-
 000 shells were fired by the
 Communists in the initial bom-
 bardment; the principal target
 was the Nationalist defense com-
 mand headquarters area, where
 communications were knocked out
 and US MAAG installations were
 damaged.   The Nationalists re-
 turned the fire.  The bombard-
 ment of the islands has con-
 tinued  intermittently  since
 the 23rd, but subsequent at-
 tacks have been lighter. The
 high rate of fire indicates
 that the Communists have been
 able to provide good logistic
 support to their artillery.
 The artillery attack has
 been supported by air strikes
 and naval operations.  The Com-
 munists reportedly used small
 flights of fighter aircraft in

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 August 1958
 Chiang continues to press
 for a definite statement of US
 intent regarding the offshore
 islands.   He has stated that
 he does not regard Secretary
 Dulles' letter to Congressman
 Morgan on 23 August to be suf-
 ficient.                        The minister of de-
 fense, however, has rather warm-
 ly supported the letter.
 Chinese Communist officials
 are intimating that Peiping in-
 tends to take the offshore is-
 lands.
 Peiping has
 not yet informed the mainland
 populace of Secretary Dulles'
 23 August warning,  but in in-
 ternational broadcasts it has
 quoted foreign press stories
 which stress that Chinmen and
 the Matsus form "an integral
 part of China."
 The Chinese Communists may
 believe that continued artil-
 lery bombardment and any suc-
 cessful seizure of a small off-
 shore island would seriously
 undermine Nationalist morale
 and consequently prepare the
 way for bolder action against
 the larger offshore islands.
 ing produced relatively little
 reaction  in Western  Europe.
 There was virtually no official
 comment and the press in most
 countries gave the events ex-
 tensive news coverage but took
 no strong line editorially.
 Every major London newspaper
 has commented editorially, how-
 ever,   with most attacking US
 policy and insisting that Com-
 munist China must replace the
 Chinese Nationalists in the UN.
 Only_the conservative Telegraph
 and the independent weekly Econ-
 omist take an opposite view,
 fio T-insisting that defense of
 Formosa,  like that of Berlin,
 is important to the free world.
 Peiping radio continues to           The developments were gen-

 Taiwan    Strait area from bloc
 and Asian  neutralist news-
 papers.
 References in bloc propa-
 ganda to Peiping's possible par-
 ticipation in international
 councils are increasing.  A 26
 August Peiping broadcast, in
 referring to the West's recent
 offer for a nuclear-test-ban
 agreement, quoted the Manchester
 Guardian's comment that  ranee
 and Communist China are left
 out:   "Where will the West place
 China?"  In the past, Peiping
 has been virtually silent on
 its possible participation in a
 test-ban agreement.   The offi-
 cial newspaper of the Polish
 Communist party, Trybuna Ludu,
 commented on 2? AUgUSZ that
 Asian countries believe it is
 "high time" for the US to rec-
 ognize Communist China and admit
 it to the United Nations.

 the Asian nations, but, except
 in Japan, there was little ini-
 tial criticism of the Chinese
 Communists for their aggressive
 moves, and little sympathy ex-
 pressed for the Nationalist
 cause.
 Indian Prime Minister Nehru
 made a noncommittal statement
 on 26 August to the effect that
 Chinmen and Matsu are very near
 the Chinese coast and that oc-
 cupation of these islands, by
 Taiwan is a constant cause of
 friction.   Nehru told Parliament
 on 27 August that he saw no par-
 ticular significance to the land-
 ing of US marines in Singapore.
 One important Indian news-
 paper stated that the offshore
 islands form an integral part
 of Chinese (Communist) territory
 and blamed American aid to Taiwan
 for creating tension in this
 area.  Another highly regarded
 conservative paper, admitting
 that it is difficult to say who
 is provoking,whom, suggested
 that the Nationalist garrisons
 should be withdrawn from the is-
 lands.   Indians as a whole would
 probably favor the return of the
 offshore islands to Communist
 China. They would, however,
 deplore any Communist aggressive
 action against the islands which
 might lead to war in the Far
 East.
 Japan's concern was demon-
 strated by a rash of press, radio,
 and TV coverage, most of which
 laid the blame for growing ten-
 sion squarely on the Chinese
 Communists.   Part of this con-
 cern stems from fear that Japan
 might become involved involuntar-
 ily in any fighting because of
 American military operations
 from bases there.  While the
 Japanese officially support the
 US position in defending Taiwan,
 they view the offshore islands
 as an integral part of the main-
 land and would probably protest
 the use of Japanese bases in
 their defense.
 Merdeka, which is often re-
 garded as a spokesman of the In-
 donesian Government, believed
 that the Communist attacks are
 aimed at neutralizing National-
 ist "harassment" of the main-
 land.   The paper, which has long
 been sharply critical of Taipei,
 nevertheless implied that the
 Communists are largely responsi-
 ble by wondering if the Commu-
 nists would risk war.
 While no official reaction
 has been reported from Seoul,
 South Korea's attitude was ex-
 pressed by.+.its ambassador to
 Taipei, who said that his gov-
 ernment would not remain idle
 if drastic changes take place
 in the Taiwan Strait.
 In the Philippines, Presi-
 dent Garcia and foreign affairs
 spokesmen limited their comment
 to expressions of concern, and
 indicated that the situation is
 under study to determine whether
 the Communist action is related
 to the coming UN session or
 "portends something serious."
 The chairman of the Senate For-
 eign Relations Committee ,t,ac-
 knowledged that a Communist
 take-over of Taiwan would con-
 stitute a serious threat to
 Philippine security.   Press
 editorials stressed the dangers
 of a rash move by either side.
 Two  Melbourne  papers
 viewed the bombardments as a
 Communist challenge to US policy,
 posing the dilemma of abandon-
 ing the offshore islands with
 resultant damage to US prestige,
 or of possible war over the off-
 shore islands which would be
 the "height of folly;"  One
 paper asserts the  situation

 points .out the precarious nature
 of following US policy on Com-
 munist China.
 Cairo radio has reported
 extensively on developments in
 the Taiwan Strait and has quoted
 one newspaper as warning Secre-
 tary Dulles that US armed inter-
 vention would almost certainly
 bring the USSR in on Peiping's
 side.  Another paper is quoted
 as criticizing US nonrecognition
 of the Chinese Communist regime,
 a standard minor theme in the
 semicontrolled UAR press.
 In Lebanon, the developments
 have had front-page  coverage
 with special attention to the
 alerting of US forces in the
 Far East.   An Israeli radio com-
 mentator questions whether the
 attacks on the Chinmen Islands
 are a political maneuver with
 the principal purpose of'increas,-
 ing the tension between the two
 world blocs and preventing any
 rapprochement between Moscow
 and the West in which Communist
 China does not participate.
 Soviet and East European
 propaganda has given only routine
 brief coverage to Peiping's re-
 ports of specific incidents of
 bombings and strafings in the
 Taiwan  Strait area.   Rather,
 commentators have concentrated
 on tying a number of incidents
 together to present a picture
 of "new US aggressive intent"
 toward Southeast Asian and Far
 Eastern nations--acts which
 have forced Communist China's
 "defensive"  reaction.  Washing-
 ton's "game," it was asserted,
 is to create a new center of
 tension in order to distract
 world attention from "continu-
 ing aggression" of US and Brit-
 ish troops in the Middle East
 despite the "US defeat" in the
 UN General Assembly.
 The list of "provocations"
 attributed to the United States
 included the issuance  of the
 State Department memorandum on
 nonrecognition  of Communist
 China, the "endless stream" of
 US arms shipments (including
 modern weapons) to Taiwan, the
 encouragement of Chiang Kai-
 shek's "criminal activities"
 (shelling offshore islands),
 the "landing" of US marines
 in Singapore, the appearance
 of the Seventh Fleet in Indian
 waters, and the arrival of Sec-
 retary of the Army Brucker in
 Tokyo.
 All of these "provocations,"
 said Moscow, show clearly that
 US foreign policy "aims at caus-
 ing dangerous crises, and is
 based on adventurist  plans
 against peoples who have risen
 in the national liberation
 struggle"--including Indonesia
 and other countries  in  the
 area.
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 Tension in Jordan relaxed
 :. sorethalt just prior to UN Sec-
 retary General Hammarskjold's
 arrival in Amman on 27 August,
 .largely as a result of the im-
 ,pact of the Arab-sponsored UN
 resolution.   The UN action was
 interpreted by the government
 of King Husayn and Prime Min-
 ister Rifai, however, as giving
 at best only a temporary relief
 from heavy pro-Nasir pressure.
 Despite the resolution, Damascus
 radio resumed attacks on Husayn

 on 26 August by broadcasting
 speeches delivered against the
 King at a rally in Damascus;
 Cairo radio has made similar
 attacks, using quotations from
 Moscow.
 Rumors are still circulat-
 ing of a possible cabinet shift
 to'a "caretaker" government
 which would provide a transi-
 tion to a pro-UAR regime. Former
 Prime Ministers Khalidi and
 Majalli are the most frequently
 mentioned for this role.
 Lebanon
 President-elect Shihab ar-
 ranged a meeting of opposition
 politicians and rebel partisan
 leaders on 25 August  in the
 hope that they might issue a
 call for moderation and a return
 to normal conditions in Lebanon.
 General Shihab's hope was disap-
 pointed, however; although lead-
 ers from  outside Beirut were
 said to favor moderation, the
 statement produced by the meet-
 tng called for the immediate
 withdrawal of foreign troops,
 the immediate departure of Pres-
 ident Chamoun, and a continua-
 tion of the strike--and, by im-
 plication, the terrorism at-
 tendant to enforcing it.
 All of these conditions
 have.been put by the rebels many
 times before; their reiteration
 at this stage suggests ei=ther.,
 that they dare not retreat pub-
 licly from their previous stands
 or that they themselves will
 continue to regard their effort
 as unsuccessful unless and un-
 til one of their number is in-
 stalled as the real ruler of
 the country.   The outstanding
 rebel candidate for prime min-
 ister under Shihab appears to
 be Rashid Karame, the Tripoli
 rebel leader who this week held
 a "review" of his forces while
 visiting the rebel stronghold
 in the Basta quarter of Beirut.
 ,The meeting of the rebel lead-
 ers of course received maximum
 security protection by the Leb-
 anese Army.
 Although Nasir has publicly
 praised Shihab, UAR support for
 the rebels continues.  However,
 the Syrian commandos who were
 holed up in Beirut and some
 other "specialists" are reported
 to have been returned to the
 UAR in.Lebanese trucks.
 Iraq
 Xenophobia, aroused to
 greater heights by the Baghdad
 "treason" trial of former Iraqi
 Chief of Staff Daghestani in
 which the court is seeking to
 implicate the United  States,
 continues to find expression in
 the middle and lower echelons
 of the Iraqi regime despite the
 professions of friendly attitudes
 made by Prime Minister Qasim
 and other ministers.   There is
 considerable minor harassment
 of American and British diplo-
 matic missions and personnel--
 telephone lines cut off, passes
 demanded from visitors to em-
 bassy quarters, refusal to per-
 mit reopening information of-
 fices--and an  increasingly
 virulent anti-Western tone to
 the radio.
 UAR-Israel Arms Race
 Both the UAR and Israel
 apparently recognize the pos-
 sibility of a showdown between
 them should the situation in
 Jordan deteriorate  rapidly.
 Israeli leaders have repeatedly
 stated that they cannot tolerate
 being surrounded by states un-
 der Nasir's control.  Against
 this background, both countries
 have moved in the last two months
 to acquire more and better arms.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 DE GAULLE AND FRENCH AFRICA
 The coordinated Algerian
 National Liberation Front sabo-
 tage and  terrorist                        attacks
 throughout France which began
 on  25 August  may signal  the
 opening of a campaign designed
 to encourage  massive absten-
 tion of Algerians in the forth-
 coming  French                   constitutional
 referendum.   The FLN actions
 may also be intended as a warn-
 ing to France that no solution
 is-possible in Algeria except
 independence.   De Gaulle's as-
 surances to tropical  Africa
 that the overseas ter-
 ritories can opt for
 independence at any
 time will alarm
 rightists pressing for
 "total integration"
 of  Algeria  ;into
 France.   Approval
 of the constitution
 is still expected,
 but these develop-
 ments may help de-

 the overwhelming ma-

 De Gaulle's
 African tour produced
 concessions which may
 be a  deliberate
 Strategy to make the
 new constitution more
 palatable to the Af-
 rican leaders.
 Votes in the  overseas terri-

 of the total eligible vote in
 the referendum.
 The African reaction has

 WORLD REACTION TO NUCLEAR TEST SUSPENSION ANNOUNCEMENT
 Free World
 With ' feW reservations, the
 free world enthusiastically
 welcomed the  US and  British
 conditional offer on 22 August
 to suspend  further  nuclear
 weapons tests for a year begin-
 ning 31 October.   Reaction was
 lessened by attention centered
 on the special General Assembly
 resolution on the Middle East.
 French Foreign Minister
 Couve de Murville followed up
 the US-UK announcement with a
 statement on 24 August that
 France's nuclear plans remained
 unchanged.  A French Foreign
 Ministry atomic energy official
 complained bitterly to US rep-
 resentatives that France had
 not been consulted and was be-
 ing put in the position of the
 "villain in the piece."  This
 official stated that France
 could not conduct its own nu-
 clear test prior to 31 October,
 but as  "the only country in
 the world that cannot renounce
 testing" is prepared to stand
 firm against world opinion,
 "especially in the UN."
 Otherwise, the Western
 move brought high praise from
 official and unofficial sources
 throughout the  free  world.
 Much of the British press was
 ecstatic--"hope dawned for the
 world," according to the Liber-
 al News Chronicle.   The Japa-
 nese generally v ewed the an-
 nouncement as a direct result
 of their own antitest campaign,
 and have  scrapped previous
 plans to push a test ban reso-
 lution in the forthcoming regu-
 lar UN General Assembly meet-
 ing in favor  of a policy of
 close consultation with the
 United States.   Indian Prime
 Minister Nehru hailed early
 press reports of the US.deci-
 sion as "good news"; no Indian
 paper to date has had any strong
 criticism for the American con-
 ditions, and several have sug-
 gested that the Soviet Union
 now must show its good faith
 by entering negotiations lead-
 ing toward firm agreements.
 Expression of disappoint-
 ment that Britain was carrying
 out its current test series be-
 fore the suspension's effective
 date, however, came from sever-
 al Asian press sources and
 from the British Labor and Lib-
 eral press.   Considerable Brit-
 ish comment regrets that France
 and especially Communist China
 present major obstacles to prog-
 ress  toward  a  world-wide nu-
 clear disarmament agreement;
 several Swiss and Dutch papers
 also comment on the problem of
 Peiping's role.
 Soviet Bloc
 The Soviet Union has thus
 far made no direct official re-
 ply or comment on the US and
 British announcements.   Initial-
 ly, Moscow issued factual ac-
 counts of the announcements; how-
 ever, subsequent Soviet commen-
 taries criticized Washington
 and London  for delaying  the
 opening of talks  and effec-
 tive  date                                                             of  suspension un-
 til 31 October.

 Cardinal Wyszynski, declare
 that the thousand-year-old Pol-
 ish Church will never be ::sep-,
 arated from the nation and to
 renew their "national vows"
 to press for greater religious
 freedom under the state.   In
 renewing the vows, the Polish
 people are continuing the cam-
 paign started last year to
 rally the populace to the sup-
 port of the church'-s efforts to
 maintain its independence and
 to win even greater freedoms
 from the Communist regime.
 The campaign has been so
 successful in revitalizing re-
 ligious lay activities on a
 wide scale that the  Gomulka
 regime apparently fears  the
 church will ultimately  suppl,atnt
 the party as the principal pow-
 er in Poland.   The party press
 has charged the church with;us-
 ing preparations for the cele-
 bration of Poland's 1,000th
 year in 1966 to create a climate
 for political activity by the
 clergy.
 Serious discord has also
 risen over religious education
 and the control over distribu-
 tion of Catholic charities.
 While the 1956 church-state
 agreement provides for religious
 education in Poland's schools,
 the regime has placed some ob-
 stacles in the way by refusing
 to license nuns and monks as
 teachers on the grounds that
 they are not qualified.  A per-
 sistent press campaign has re-
 peated charges that the church
 is trying to force children
 into religious courses and is
 discriminating against non-
 Catholic students.   The  Catho-
 lic charities question remains
 unresolved because Cardinal
 Wyszynski refuses to cooperate
 with the government in distribut-
 ing charitable goods received
 from  Catholic  sources  on

 the grounds that this is the
 church's exclusive function..
 While repeatedly claiming
 that it will not violate the
 1956 agreement, the regime has
 launched a strong press cam-
 paign against the church, which
 in some instances has been
 virulent and slanderous, and
 which has charged the church
 with  publishing   antistate
 .pamphlets and trying to recover
 church lands given to the peas-
 ants.
 These charges could just
 as well have been made a year
 ago, suggesting that  the
 church's activities  alone are
 not the  reason      for the  cur-
 rent                    campaign.      Gomulka's
 overt  moves against, the church
 at this time are probably in-
 tended mainly to discredit the
 clergy, in an effort to win
 the support of local party
 leaders who have been demoral-
 ized by their loss of authority
 to the village priests.
 Wyszynski has limited room
 for compromise with Gomulka,
 even if he should be so in-
 clined.                                                                    While there is no evi-
 dence that he is being pressured
 by the Vatican, any compromise,
 by Wyszynski, even of a minor
 nature, would meet with opposi-
 tion from the senior clergy and'
 the strongly anti-Communist
 populace.   While both church
 and state appear determined to
 avoid  a  serious  break  In
 their  truce,   extremists  on
 both  sides  make-.it ;.diffi-
 cult                                                                for   them  to  maintain
 the  delicate, balance. ~     25X1
 Under a new system  for
 planning and administering the
 supply of commodities for So-
 viet industry and construction,
 ,certain detailed functions
 formerly performed by USSR Gos-
 plan have been delegated to the
 republics, predpminantly to the
 Russian Republic (RSFSR) and
 to the regional councils of na-
 tional economy (sovnarkhozy).
 Under the new measures--which
 further implement Khrushchev's
 1957 economic reorganization
 proposals--USSR Gosplan never-
 theless retains control over
 the supply of critical items and
 continues to direct the more
 important supply movements among
 the republics.
 As presented in the USSR
 Gosplan theoretical journal
 Planned Economy, the new pro-
 cee. prow-es that in those
 minor instances when the USSR's
 total production of a commodity
 is concentrated in the economic
 area of a single sovnarkhoz,.

 that sovnarkhoz will plan the
 distribution of the item.   In
 the same way, when Soviet pro-
 duction of a commodity is con-
 centrated within a single re-
 public, the Gosplan of that re-.
 public will plan its, distribu-
 tion.   Distribution of a com-
 modity produced in not more
 than three republics, with 80
 to 90 percent of total output
 concentrated. in a single re-
 public, will be planned by the
 Gosplan of that republic.  The
 supply of some 5,000. items
 formerly planned by the min-
 istries under USSR Gosplan su-
 pervision apparently is affected
 by this supply reorganization.!
 Items which are produced
 widely among the republics or
 which are "of all-union signif-
 icance" remain a USSR Gosplan
 responsibility and will be
 planned and administered by the.

 recently.   These supplant the
 former ministerial supply and
 marketing organs which had been
 "temporarily" consolidated into
 USSR Gosplan during the first
 phase of Khrushchev's reorgan-
 ization to avoid supply disrup-
 tion.  With this "freeze" of
 supply relations in effect,
 USSR Gosplan reportedly planned
 the distribution of about 6,000
 items for 1958; some 760 of
 these items were "funded" com-
 modities, with distribution ap-
 proved by the USSR Council of
 Ministers.   Under the new set-
 up, USSR Gosplan will plan and
 administer the supply of those
 items formerly "funded" as well
 as some others, bringing the
 total number of commodities cen-
 trally distributed to about
 1,000.
 This supply reorganization
 belatedly brings the Soviet sys-
 tem of industrial supply more
 in line with Khrushchev's re-
 gional system of economic or-
 ganization.   The new system also
 is intended to foster the devel-
 opment of direct relations be-
 tween consumer and supplier en-
 terprises.  This will occur,
 however, only to the extent that
 enterprises can work out their
 supply patterns more easily with
 sovnarkhozy and union republics
 than with USSR Gosplan.
 .Implementation of these meas-
 ures in the field of supply is
 intended to bring economies in
 transportation and to encourage
 more efficient production spe-
 cialization through subcontract-
 ing, improvements which had been
 foregone by the  regime  ten"
 porarily  in  fear that  sup-
 ply. disruption                                                                might    de-
 velop if all the                                                                    measures
 were  implemented  simulta-
 neously.                 (Pre-
 pared  by ORR)
 Soviet tin sales rose from 1,-
 000, :tons in 1956 to .about 10,000
 tons in 1957, 6 percent of free-
 world consumption, and rose to
 7,000 tons in the first half of
 1958, 14 percent of free-world
 consumption in that period.
 This level of sales threatens
 to disrupt the operations of the
 International Tin Council, with
 which the USSR has so far re-
 fused to cooperate.   This or-
 ganization of tin producers and
 consumers maintains a buffer
 stock designed to prevent ex-
 cessive price fluctuation and
 to ensure adequate supplies at
 reasonable prices.   Tin exports
 play an important part in the
 economies of Bolivia and Malaya
 particularly, and the recent
 Russian sales have brought the
 USSR under sharp criticism in
 both countries.
 Malaya, producer of one
 third of the free world's tin,
 has been seriously hurt by tin
 export restrictions. Production
 has reached its lowest point in
 11 years;, 39 'percent of, the iaines' ian
 operation in December 1957 have
 been forced to shut down while
 most others are operating only
 part time.   On 24 August the
 Malayan Government appealed to
 the Soviet Union, the United
 States, and the United Kingdom
 to cooperate in preventing fur-

 Metal sales are important
 to the USSR as a source of for-
 eign exchange, and Moscow may
 also be trying to discredit the
 Western tin-management plan.
 It sold about $20,000,000 worth
 of tin in 1957 and $15,000,000
 worth , in the. first, half 'of this
 year.  To counter the growing
 Soviet deliveries, the UK as a
 leading member of the tin coun-
 cil is urging other tin-consum-
 ing countries to cooperate in
 imposing at least temporary im-
 port controls on Soviet tin on
 1 September.
 Following a de-
 cline in tin consump-
 tion.and a halt in US
 stockpile purchases
 last year, the tin
 council bought up the
 10,000-ton-free-world
 surplus- production
 and the 10,000 tons
 of Soviet tin which
 were added to the al-
 ready saturated world
 market.  The continu-
 ing decline in world
 demand for tin, plus
 a rise in the tin
 council's purchases
 to 22,000 tons in
 March of this year
 to maintain prices,
 has made necessary
 the imposition of ex-
 port quotas on the
 six producing coun-
 tries in the free world.
 By mid-August the
 tin council had nearly
 exhausted its resources.
 Soviet shipments of
 800 tons in mid-August
 .and the expected ar-
 rival of 400-500 addi-
 tional tons by the
 28 AUGUST 1958 end  of this month are
 believed by the British
 to be sufficient to break the
 tin management plan.   The pro-
 ducing countries, chafing under
 the severe export restrictions
 placed against them,      are cutting
 their production by as much as
 30 percent, while the resources
 which they have contributed to
 the tine  council in effect are
 used to buy up Soviet tin.
 The USSR for its part--
 with production of about 15,000
 tons, imports from Communist
 China of over 20,000 tons, and
 increasing domestic substitu-
 tion of,other metals for tin--
 is able. to increase its ship-
 ments of tin to the free world.

 RUMANIAN REGIME TIGHTENS DISCIPLINE
 The Rumanian regime is con-
 ducting a major drive against
 embezzlement and petty thiev-
 ery, problems not new to Rumania
 but particularly severe at this
 time.   Death penalties have
 twice been exacted for.crimes
 allegedly involving,misappro-
 priation of state funds or theft
 of public property, and Bucha-
 rest has recently created a
 special bureau "to carry out
 financial control over state
 enterprises and institutions."
 The decision probably derives
 from the reported disclosure
 at a June plenum of the party
 central committee that in 1957-
 58 the regime had lost 1.5 bil-
 lion lei ($250,000,000 at the
 official exchange rate) through
 theft or destruction of state
 property.
 The demands of party and
 government newspapers for an
 "unceasing struggle" against
 remnants of "decadent bourgeois
 liberalism" suggest that the
 drive--limited thus far to eco-
 nomic crimes--may be expanded
 to include literary and ideo-
 logical spheres. `-.The regime's
 top spokesmen in the creative
 arts have demanded that writers,
 critics, and musicians "defend
 the people's democratic regime,
 public property, and the rights
 of citizens."
 The US Legation has re-
 ceived unconfirmed reports of
 the wholesale dismissal and,
 in some cases, the arrest of
 government employees,  profes-
 sional people, and minority
 leaders for political unreli-
 ability, and anticipates that
 the drive may develop into a
 general vigilance campaign.
 Yugoslav press sources report
 that a "party verification"
 drive has begun in Rumania with
 the dismissal of high-ranking
 functionaries, including at
 least one regional party secre-
 tary, for "serious disciplinary
 mistakes."  These moves prob-
 ably do not result from any
 serious threat to the regime,
 although they may be intended
 to discourage any interpretation
 of the recent withdrawal of
 Soviet forces as a weakening in
 the regime's internal security
 position.
 The June plenum called for
 greater ideological vigilance
 and intraparty discipline and
 for adherence to the tenets of
 "socialist morality"; it also
 reorganized the party control
 commission--the body which would
 be responsible for carrying out
 any widespread purge of the
 party--and dismissed several
 top officials, including four
 candidate members of the central
 committee.   Since then, the
 penal code has been amended to
 include drastic punishments for
 sabotage, treason, or economic
 speculation, and jurists have
 been instructed to mete out ex-
 emplary sentences in cases of
 theft or corruption.

 SIHANOUK'S VISIT TO COMMUNIST CHINA
 Premier Sihanouk, during
 his visit to Peiping, emphati-
 cally reaffirmed Cambodia's
 commitment to a policy of ~neu-
 trality.   Following up Cambodian
 recognition of Peiping in July,
 both countries have appointed
 ambassadors.
 Chinese leaders accorded
 Sihanouk unusual attention
 during the visit.   Mao Tse-tung
 on one occasion talked with him
 for six hours.   Chou    En-lai
 held "many talks" with Sihanouk
 and, with Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi, personally escorted him on
 some of his tours, including
 a visit to China's first atomic
 reactor.
 Sihanouk's itinerary con-
 centrated mainly on industrial
 areas of Northeast China, and
 seems to have been designed
 to impress iiim with the coun-
 try's industrial advances. In
 the joint communique issued at
 the end of the visit, Peiping
 said it was ready to extend
 economic assistance in addition
 to the $23,000,000 grant made
 In 1956.   The Chinese Communists
 promised gifts of small iron
 and steel works, which proba-
 bly would be showpieces since
 Cambodia has insufficient coal
 and iron resources to develop
 a steel industry.
 Although Chou En-lai ex-
 pressed sympathy for Cambodia
 in its border problems with its
 neighbors--an obvious reference
 to South Vietnam and Thailand--
 the communique made no reference
 to military aid.   Cambodian of-
 ficitls  in Phnom  Penh  have
 sought to reassure the United
 States that Cambodia's attitude
 toward the West is unchanged
 despite Sihanouk's statements
 in Peiping suggesting a more
 pro-Communist position.   The
 Cambodian army chief of staff
 has told an American military
 official that his government
 had no desire to have a Chinese
 military mission in Phnom Penh
 despite dissatisfaction with
 "Inadequate" US aid.  A cabinet
 member stated flatly that recog-
 nition of Peiping did not pre-
 sage a "military alliance" or
 acceptance of Chinese Communist
 military aid.
 The cabinet official also
 said tiaa:t,:despite.the Cambodian
 belief that the Chinese Commu-
 nists had "scrupulously observed"
 Chou.. En+lai's 1956 pledge not
 to intervene in Cambodia's af-

 possible subversion in schools.

 BURMESE GENERAL ELECTIONS EXPECTED IN NOVEMBER
 Premier Nu's cancellation
 of the budgetary session of Par-
 liament, scheduled for 28 Au-
 gust, has intensified political
 campaigning for what promise to,
 be Burma's most closely contest-
 ed elections since achievement
 of independence in 1948.   The
 elections are expected to take
 place in November.   No single
 party will go to the polls with
 .an assured majority, and for
 the first time district commis-
 sioners throughout Burma agree
 that free elections can be held.
 Established party leaders are
 already campaigning vigorously,
 and new parties, including one
 which is avowedly Communist,
 are being organized.'
 Nu's precarious eight-vote
 majority in Parliament has de-
 pended on the 44 votes held by
 the Communist-influenced Nation-
 al United Front (NUF) since the
 vote of confidence in June. Al-
 though Nu has been able to es-
 tablish firm ties with Dr. E
 Maung, president of the moderate
 Justice party in the NUF, neith-
 er his "clean" Anti-Fascist
 People's Freedom League (AFPFL)
 nor the opposition "stable"
 AFPFL, headed by former Deputy
 Premiers Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein,
 has been able to enlarge its
 support in Parliament.
 General elections are being
 forced on Nu by violent dissen-
 sion in the NUF.   While the Jus-
 tice party and the crypto-Com-
 munist Burma Workers party are
 anxious to maintain a coalition
 with Nu, the radical left wing
 of the front has broken away in
 protest against American mili-
 tary aid abd.tbe government's in-
 sistence that insurgents sur-
 render before their political
 rights are restored.
 In the coming elections
 there will be four major con-
 testants--the "clean" and "sta-
 ble" wings of the AFPFL and the
 moderate and radical factions of
 the NUF.   Because of Nu's im-
 mense personal popularity and
 his control over government
 finances,
 e premier an     e
 "clean" AFPFL are in the strong-
 est position.   They expect the
 "stable" AFPFL to be the chief
 loser.    Until the NUF dissen-
 sion became public, it was
 widely predicted that the pro-
 Communists, who won 34 percent
 of the 1956 vote, would make
 sweeping gains.  With the
 breakdown of party discipline,
 however, NUF prospects may de-
 cline sharply.
 Probably no single party
 will emerge from the vote with
 a clear majority, thus endanger-
 ing the country's political sta-
 bility.                                                                   Such a development would
 force on Nu another government
 in which his majority would de-
 pend even more on the pro-Com-
 munist elements in the NUF.
 Under these circumstances, it
 is doubtful that he would be
 able to maintain his anti-Commu-
 nist position and his insistence
 on insurgent surrenders.

 NEW SOVIET EMBASSY IN IRAQ
 The new Soviet Embassy in
 Baghdad has been staffed with
 a group particularly well quali-
 fied to expand penetration ef-
 forts in Iraq.   The USSR had
 had no diplomatic representation
 in Iraq since the latter broke
 off relations in 1955.   Moscow
 was quick to recognize the new
 Iraqi regime, oLnd the first con-
 tingent of Soviet diplomats ar-
 rived in Baghdad on 4 August.
 The ambassador and at least one
 counselor speak Arabic, and the
 staff as a whole is heavily
 weighted with area specialists.
 Ambassador Grigory Zaytsev
 minister to Iraq from 1944 to
 1948.   An experienced economist
 and Arabic scholar, he most re-
 cently served as head of the
 Near East Department of the So-
 viet Foreign Ministry.   He is
 a graduate of the Oriental In-
 stitute in Moscow and  also
 speaks Persian.
 Counselor Yevgeny Podvigin,
 who speaks classical Arabic
 fluently, was second secretary
 in Lebanon from 1946 to 1948
 and maintained close contacts
 with Communist leaders through-
 out the Levant.   He made trips
 to Palestine in 1947 to meet
 members of the Pan-Slav Union
 and the Arab League of National
 Liberation.   He was first secre-
 tary in Egypt from November 1950
 to August 1952 and attended the
 Suez Conference in London in
 1956.
 Counselor Aleksandr Semiosh-

 from 1948 to 1956.   Prior to his
 assignment to Israel, he is be-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUGARY
 28 August 1958
 It seems probable that the
 Soviet Embassy staff will make
 a strong attempt to strengthen
 the Iraqi Communist party and
 to influence the Kurdish na-
 tionalists.   Formerly suppressed,
 the Iraqi Communist party has
 become active since the coup;
 it favors close relations with  25X1
 the USSR and opposes union with
 the UAR, although it would ac-
 cept federation.
 Argentine President From-
 dizi's new labor law is evident-
 ly designed to win his adminis-
 tration the badly needed sup-
 port of organized labor.   It
 has, however, aroused fears in
 some segments of conservative
 opinion that it will aid Peron-
 ista efforts to regain politi-
 cal power.   These fears, together
 with opposition ..attacks  on
 Frondizi, have generated new
 rumors of a military coup--which,
 however, seems to lack sufficient
 support at this time.
 The controversial labor
 legislation--which became law
 on 27 August--calls for new eleo-
 tions in all unions within 90
 days.   This has been strongly
 opposed by the military, "demo-
 cratic" and Communist labor
 leaders, and by various politi-
 cal groups who fear that Peron-
 istas will regain control of
 organized labor, which was Per-
 on'.I principal power base.
 The present situation, in
 which about two thirds of or-
 ganized labor is controlled by
 anti-Peronistas and about one
 third by neo-Peronistas and
 Communists, does not accurately
 reflect rank-and-file sentiment.
 After the provisional Aramburu
 government had outlawed trade
 union or political activity by
 former Peronista leaders, many
 Peronistas abstained from vot-
 ing in union elections.   Since
 then the position of the "demo-
 cratic" elements has been weak-
 ened by lack of mutual coopera-
 tion, and the ban on trade un-
 ion activity by former Peronistas
 was  lifted by amnesty measures
 last May.   The old-line pro-
 Peron leaders--are reported plan-
 ning to resume union leadership
 but encountering strong resist-
 ance from the neo-Peronistas.
 Frondizi, whose party dom-
 inates congress, evidently cal-
 culates that the younger neo-
 Peronista trade-union leaders
 would be the'likely victors in
 new elections and that they
 could be oriented into positive
 support for the administration,
 possibly carrying with them a
 large party of Peron's former
 following.   He needs labor's
 support because of its political
 importance and ability to under-
 cut his

 PARITY PREPARATIONS FOR VENEZUELA' S ELECTIONS
 The recent convention of
 the leftist but non-dommunist
 Democratic Action (AD), Vene-
 zuela's largest party, took a
 cautious approach to the elec-
 tions scheduled for 23 November.
 The major achievement of the
 convention was to reaffirm the
 leadership of the moderate wing
 over the more- radical youth ele-
 ments.
 After several weeks of ne-
 gotiation, Venezuelan political
 parties have not yet agreed on
 an election formula to implement
 the unity program which they en..
 dorsed after the fall of dictator
 Perez last January primarily to
 meet the threat of a return to
 military rule.  Avoidance of
 interparty strife necessitates
 arrangements for a joint presi-
 dential candidate, for repre-
 sentation of parties in legisla-
 tive bodies, and possibly for
 a tentative apportionment of
 top executive positions in the
 new government.
 Spokesmen of At, which
 holds the balance of power in
 the negotiations, have previous-
 ly refrained from defining the
 party's policy On grounds that
 the national convention would
 have to determine it.  The con-
 vention, however, merely em-
 powered its newly elected ex-
 ecutive committee, headed by
 former ,President Romulo Betan--
 court, to continue multiparty
 discussions to select nonpolit-
 ical candidates for the presi-
 dency  without recommending
 specific candidates or revealing
 its stand on other election
 problems.
 Ab's caution may be due in
 part to pressure of the military,
 many of whom are hostile to the  25X1
 party and equate it with Commu-
 nism.
 Larraza-
 baal,.who has substantial backing
 within AD and the endorsement
 of the Communists, has tended
 to support civilian elements
 vis-a-vis the military and is
 considered a leading presiden-
 tial contender.
 The government junta has set
 up the electoral machinery and
 is proceeding with the registra-
 tion of eligible voters.   Party
 leaders, therefore, must soon
 reach agreement on an election

 At the meeting of the Arab
 League foreign ministers in
 Cairo on 6 September, UAR Pres-
 ident Nasir may attempt to mold
 the league into an instrument
 to further his asCendaacy in
 the Arab world.   Under the cover
 of strengthening the league, he
 may bring about a reorganiza-
 tion under which the Arab states
 would relinquish a portion of
 their control over foreign pol-
 icy  to  a  'Nasir-dominated
 league, thus, in effect bring-
 ing them into the UAR--or the
 somewhat looser UAS
 confederation '.in-
 eluding      Yemen--by     CArab League States
 the back door.   The
 death of Iraq's Nuri
 Said and the replace-
 ment of the Hashimite
 regime there by a
 professedly pan-Arab
 revolutionary govern-
 ment have removed the
 last major obstacles
 to such a scheme.
 The league has
 long been regarded
 as the highest ex-
 pression  of  Arab
 unity--an incomplete
 and imperfect expres-
 sion of unity but
 one which,  in the
 language of the Arab
 radios, could "grow
 into reality and perfection be-
 cause it responds to the deep-
 est yearnings of the Arab peo-
 ple."  However, it has not re-
 flected the political realities
 of the Arab world--in fact, the
 tensions and conflicts among
 the Arab states were brought to
 the surface within the league
 and seemed greater by contrast
 with the ideals which it in-
 tended to achieve.
 The immediate impetus for
 the formation of the league was
 the initiative taken by Nuri
 Said in 1942 when he proposed
 the formation of a "greater
 Syria" which would have included
 Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Trans,jor-
 dan,  and Palestine.   Nuri be-
 lieved this union would give
 the Palestine Arabs strength to
 resist the growing menac.e:  of
 Zionism.   From its inception
 the plan had many enemies--the
 anti-Hashimite Saudis, Lebanese
 Christians, and Farouk's Egypt.
 In the end the league was formed,
 not as Nuri had envisaged it, but
 on a looser and more general pat-
 tern, with Egypt taking the lead.
 At Alexandria in October
 1944 a general Arab conference
 formulated what has come to be
 known as the "Alexandria Proto-
 col."  It delineated the out-
 line of an Arab League and en-
 visaged the progressive surrend-
 er of sovereignty by the mem-
 bers.
 By the time the charter of
 the league was signed in March
 1945, however, the concept of
 the organization had again been
 altered drastically.   The proto-
 col originally had stated that
 "in no case would a state be

 permitted to pursue a foreign
 policy which would be detri-
 mental to the policy of the
 league or any of its member
 states."   Decisions  o1c  the
 league council were to be bind-
 ing on all members, and Le an-
 ese independence and sovereign-
 ty were to be respected.                  As
 finally signed, however, the
 charter was a watered-down ver-
 sion of the protocol,  stating
 that only those states which
 voted for a decision were bound
 by it.
 This changed version re-
 sulted from Egyptian and Saudi
 maneuvers to keep Iraq and
 Transjordan from uniting with
 the other Arab states of geo-
 graphic Syria--Lebanon, Syria,
 and  Palestine.    Thus,   the
 league enshrined rather than
 resolved the fundamental con-
 flict between the Hashimite
 states on the one side and
 Saudi Arabia and Egypt on the
 other, which continued through
 the Palestine War of 1948 and
 into the postwar period.   Until
 Iraq joined the Baghdad Pact,
 the rivalry between the two
 Arab blocs were usually kept
 below the surface.   After 1955,
 however, the conflict broke out
 at league meetings.  Nasir op-
 posed all league efforts to rec-
 oncile : Egypt and Iraq as long
 as Iraq adhered to the Baghdad
 Pact, implying that the unity
 for which the Arabs call was to
 be denied until Iraq would join
 with Egypt in a regional  "neu-
 tralism"  outside the pact.
 With a new government in
 power in Iraq and Hashimite
 Jordan reduced to impotence,
 Nasir now may be ready to re-
 organize the league as a hold-
 ing company under which all
 Arabdom may be brought under
 Egyptian "management" in the
 name of Arab neutralism.   The
 most important of the ideas now
 being circulated in the Cairo
 press is the "suggestion" by
 the league's secretary general,
 an Egyptian,  that the charter
 be amended to provide that "all
 resolutions adopted by a major-
 ity  be  binding  upon  all
 members."
 This is a return to the
 Alexandria Protocol of 1944,
 except that it is now the Iraqi
 ambassador who appears to be
 deprecating.   tie necessity of
 amendment.     He  asserts  that
 a mere revitalization of the
 league's machinery and "eradi-
 cation of the roots of the
 polities  of  certain  Arab
 governments"--presumably Jordan
 and Lebanon--are all that are
 needed.   Saudi  Arabian  and
 Libyan  representatives have
 publicly favored amendment of
 the charter--possibly in the
 belief that by strengthening
 the league they will ward off
 absorption by the UAR.
 It seems likely that if
 Nasir obtains an abdication of
 independent foreign policy by
 the league states, he will then
 move to make the league domi-
 nant in defense, finance, edu-
 cation, and other fields, grad- 25X1

 of the other Arab states in the
 name of Arab unity:.

 The ability of Ceylon's

 nomic importance.
 Urban Labor
 Since the economy of Cey-
 i  n  is heavily dependent on the
 Tamils dominant
 SECRET
 export of tea, rubber, and coco-
 nut products through the port
 of Colombo, the two important
 areas of union strength are among
 the rural plantation workers
 and the urban labor force in
 Colombo.   Control of the urban
 unions is contested keenly by
 Dr. N. M. Perera's opposition
 Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samaja
 party  (LSSP),  which owes no al-
 legiance to Moscow; cabinet min-
 ister Philip Gunawardena's Trot-
 skyite Viplavakari Lanka Sama
 Samaja party  (VLSSP), which also
 opposes Moscow; and the ortho-
 dox Communist party.   Bandara-
 naike's Sri Lanka Freedom party
 is a relative newcomer to the po_
 litIGal and. labor fields, ,and its
 influence with laboris negligible.
 Perera--leader of the par-
 liamentary opposition and one
 of the most astute
 politicians in Ceylon
 --controls the most
 strategic elements of
 urban labor.   A rough
 estimate of the three
 parties' total urban
 labor strength.indi-
 cates that _the LSSP
 controls about 70 per-
 cent, the VLSSP about
 7 percent, and the
 Communists 20 percent.
 LSSP-affiliated
 unions now dominate
 the port of Colombo.
 Outside the port, the
 LSSP controls a. wide
 variety of Colombo's
 government employees
 --represented by the
 Government Workers'
 Trade Union Federa-
 tion--and some employ-
 ees in private firms.
 Its ability to dis-

 February-March  1958,        when
 strikes occurred among, hotel,
 mercantile, and engineering
 trade workers and in private
 oil companies.  The benefits
 which labor reaped from these
 strikes were attributed by
 workers largely to the LSSP,
 and the failure of recent Com-
 munist- and VLSSP-led strikes
 has further solidified the
 LSSP's labor support.
 The Communist party's ur-
 ban labor strength is less
 formidable than the LSSP's, but
 that party also is capable of
 extensive economic disruption.
 Its following exists princi-
 pally among workers in private
 Colombo trading firms and among
 white-collar government employ-
 ees in Colombo.
 Two Communist-led: strikes
 last spring failed to benefit
 the party, however.   The gov-
 ernment not only dealt resolute-
 ly with a strike of its own em-
 ployees but supported the con-
 tention of private employers
 that a strike against their
 firms was illegal.   As a result,
 some dissatisfied unions ap-
 parently shifted their alle-
 giance to Perera's LSSP,
 Strikes by Philip Gunawar-
 dena's unions have not caused
 extensive economic damage and
 have been generally ill timed.
 With the bulk of Ceylon's
 urban labor controlled by two
 far-leftist opposition parties,
 strike activity is one of the
 chief threats to economic and
 political stability.   The fact
 that the top Communist and LSSP
 leaders have substantially more
 popular appeal than Gunawardena,
 a cabinet minister, further de-
 tracts from the government's
 potential labor support.  This
 is particularly true of Perera,
 whose parliamentary stature and
 popularity with the workers
 make him the most powerful op-
 position figure on the island.
 His articulate criticism of the
 government's antistrike activ-
 ities has cast him in the role
 of the principal defender of
 democratic rights for labor.
 The government is partially
 to blame for the economic and
 political deterioration which
 has resulted from the steady
 growth of urban labor unrest.
 Its former pro-employee bias
 contributed to the lack of la-
 bor discipline, and its general
 endorsement of union activity
 gave free rein to far-leftist
 labor elements which were held
 in check by the former ruling
 United National party.  The
 prcaocnt government's belated ef-
 forts to bring undisciplined
 labor under control by adopting
 a hard line toward the Commu-
 nist-led strike of its own em-
 ployees last April and through
 the nationalization of Colombo
 port on 1 August are unlikely
 alone to remedy the situation.
 The least politically ac-
 tive but by far the largest
 organized labor group in Ceylon
 is composed of some 300,000
 workers on tea, rubber, and coco-
 nut estates.   The entire planta-
 tion labor force numbers at
 least 600,000 and consists pri-
 marily of Tamil-speaking work-
 ers of southern Indian origin,
 the great majority of whom have
 no Ceylonese citizenship.
 The largest estate labor
 union, with a membership of about
 200,000,  is the non-Communist
 Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC)
 led by S. K. Thondaman.   The
 CWC's leadership has shown re-
 sponsibility thus far, and dur-
 ing the past two years the or-
 ganization has refrained from
 major agitation except for a
 one-day token strike in Decem-
 ber 1957.
 The Democratic Workers'
 Congress (DWC), formed in early
 1956 by pro-Communist Abdul
 Aziz,   is  the  second.  largest
 estate labor union with a claimed
 membership   of  50,000.    The

 influence of the DWC's Commu-
 nist-dominated leadership over
 the union's rank and file has
 been negligible.   The union ap-
 parently has not yet managed
 to attract elements from the
 large section of unorganized
 plantation labor,  and has re-
 cently lost strength to Thon-
 daman's union.   The LSSP and
 Communist plantation unions--
 with a membership of about 35,-
 000 and 2,500 respectively--
 probably are among the least
 influential of Ceylon's major
 trade organizations.
 Instances of cooperation
 between plantation and urban
 labor have been rare.   Thonda-
 man's CWC staged a one-day
 strike last December in support
 of demands made by striking
 unions in Colombo,  and most
 plantation unions supported the
 LSSP's protest against the gov-
 ernment's antistrike measures
 in Colombo last spring.   Co-
 operation of this type is not
 likely to become widespread,
 however,  in view of the two
 groups' geographic separation,
 the lack of political awareness
 among the mass of plantation
 workers, and the differing po-
 litical views of their leaders.
 A Communist-Trotskyite move
 to form port and municipal united
 labor  fronts  in  order  to
 increase urban labor's bargain-
 ing power is a remote possibil
 ity at present.   Perera--whose
 support would be essential to
 successful urban labor unity--
 can effectively press his unions'
 demands unaided by the Commu-
 nist and VLSSP unions.   He will
 probably attempt independently
 to increase the LSSP's strength
 and initiative in port and mu-
 nicipal labor affairs.
 Strikes similar to those
 which plagued the island almost
 continuously from November 1957
 through   May  1958  probably
 will not recur immediately aft-
 er the government decides to
 lift the emergency rule imposed
 on 27 May.   However, a long
 continuation of the existing
 calm is unlikely.   Occasional
 minor strikes and slowdowns prob-
 ably will be staged to harass
 the government,: through more wide-
 spread  labor  agitation                                                                    may
 be  checked  until exploitable
 issues such  as  the  cost  of
 living, lack of economic prog-
 ress, or antilabor discrimina-
 tion by government and private
 employers again take precedence
 over communal problems.
 CHILE'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
 Chile's presidential elec-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 August 1958
 In the long run,  an Alessandri
 government might indirectly im-
 prove the prospects of the al-
 ready well-established Commu-
 nist party by neglecting the eco-
 nomic interests of the lower
 classes.
 Allende, on the other hand,
 would probably attempt to insti-
 tute extensive  land  reform
 through taxation of idle lands.
 He would also demand greater
 control over and an increase in
 taxes for the US-owned copper
 companies which supply Chile
 with 65 percent of its foreign
 exchange.    Allende has stated
 that he will cancel the US-
 Chilean military pact, oppose
 the PL 480 program for Chile,
 open trade and diplomatic rela-
 tions with the Soviet bloc,  and
 maintain an isolationist neutral
 course in the cold war.
 Although he has frequently
 attacked US policies and has the
 support of the Communist party,
 which was legalized early this
 month, Allende has stated that
 US development capital is es-
 sential for Chile.   It would
 not be inconsistent with Chilean
 politics for him to end his co-
 operation with the Communists
 after he is elected.   Allende
 is probably the only candidate
 capable of implementing the
 needed land reform and the re-
 organization of Chile's paper
 industry,  two measures which
 would tend to stabilize the
 economy and,  in the long   run,
 weaken the Communist party.
 As the outstanding exponent
 of Christian Democratic philos-
 ophy for Chile for the last 20
 years,  Frei would attempt eco-
 nomic and social reform along
 more orthodox and less violent
 lines than Allende.   Frei is
 anti-Marxist and anti-Communist,
 but he favors a high degree of
 state intervention in economic
 processes and believes in the
 SECRET
 necessity of agrarian reform.
 Short of an improbable coopera-
 tion with either the anticleri-
 cal Radicals or the Popular Al-
 liance Front, the Christian
 Democrats could not obtain the
 necessary party support to im-
 plement major aspects of Frei's
 program.   The Christian Democrat-
 ic party lacks a solid national
 organization and is dependent
 for its support on the individual
 following of Frei and that of
 other independent persons or
 groups in the provinces, a sup-
 port that cannot be discounted
 in view of the unusually large
 independent vote in Chile.
 The Radical party continues
 to back Luis Bossay--despite the
 hopelessness of his candidacy--
 in order to maintain the party's
 unity, which has made it Chile's
 largest political party and en-
 abled it to elect three presi-
 dents since 1938.   Evidently
 hoping to reach a working agree-
 ment with the winner, Radical
 leaders have generally avoided
 attacking the other candidates
 personally during the campaign,
 concentrating instead on Pres-
 ident Ibanez.
 The candidacy of independ-
 ent Antonio Zamorano is totally
 discounted.
 Regardless of which candi-
 date wins, the new government
 will be faced with inflation
 and a severe shortage of for-
 eign exchange, which will be
 almost impossible to remedy as
 long as the present low price
 for copper continues.   Faced
 with a discouraging economic
 picture,  the new president will
 probably turn to the United
 States for the  economic  as-
 sistance   necessary                                                                     to   imple-
 ment  his programs.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 August 1958
 THE UKRAINIAN PARTY--SOURCE
 Since Khrushchev became
 party first secretary in 1953,
 an unprecedented number of per-
 sonnel assigned to key jobs in
 Moscow and in the Russian fed-
 eration (RSFSR) have been. drawn
 from the Ukrainian party appa-
 ratus.   At the presidium level,
 the addition last June of N. V.
 Podgorny and D.  S. Polyansky
 as candidate members brought to
 10 out of 25 the number of those
 in the party's ruling body who
 are or have been Ukrainian offi-
 cials.   The current leadership
 in Kiev is better represented
 on the all-union central com-
 mittee than at any time in the
 past, and many regional party
 organizations in the RSFSR are
 headed by men who previously
 served in the Ukraine.   In addi-
 tion, several of these people
 are to be found both in the
 USSR government and in prominent
 posts in the smaller republics
 --two of them as republic party
 chiefs.
 Given the size and import-
 ance of the Ukrainian party and
 what appears to be the natural
 inclination of the Ukrainian
 clique in the Kremlin to pro-
 mote former associates, it is
 likely that the Ukraine will
 remain a major source of cadres
 for some time to come.
 Party Qualifications
 The use of the Ukraine as
 a recruiting ground for leading
 party and,  to a lesser extent,
 government cadres was fairly
 common before Stalin's death.
 As the most densely populated
 republic after the RSFSR,  the
 Ukraine has the second largest
 party.   As a result, more seats
 on the all-union central commit-
 tee.have always been allocated
 to'the Ukraine than to.any oth
 er republic except the RSFSR.
 Although political patron-
 age seems to play a large role
 in the selection of leading
 cadres from the Ukraine, the
 OF LEADING SOVIET CADRES
 republic is one of the best
 sources for party administrators
 for other reasons.   Because of
 the importance of the Ukrainian
 party, men who have served suc-
 cussfully in Kiev are particu-
 larly well qualified for work
 in Moscow.   In most cases,  the
 Ukrainian candidate for a post
 in the central apparatus is
 familiar with the complex work-
 ings of a major Communist party
 and with the party's role in
 administering a highly indus-
 trialized and agriculturally
 important state.
 The Khrushchev Machine
 By the. time of the 20th
 party congress in 1956 it was
 clear that Khrushchev had used
 his 12-year stint  (1938-49) as
 Ukrainian party chief to build
 up a powerful following which
 was to become the hard core of
 his support in the central com-
 mittee in Moscow.   Using tactics
 learned from Stalin, he rebuilt
 the war-shattered Ukrainian par-
 ty with men of his own choosing
 ,
 many of whom,  like Aleksey
 Kirichenko and Leonid Brezhnev,
 had served with him as political
 officers in the Red Army.   These
 he posted in   key  positions
 throughout the republic, pri-
 marily in the oblast first sec-
 retaryships.                                                                         Unlike Stalin, he
 was careful to cultivate the
 personal friendship of his un-
 derlings; the record of the
 Ukrainian party congress in 1949
 indicates that he was on a first-
 name basis-with almost all of
 his regional party chiefs.
 Khrushchev apparently be-
 gan to maneuver his cohorts in
 the Ukraine into positions from
 which they could eventually
 gain central committee status
 as early as December 1949, when
 he was transferred to Moscow as
 third-ranking secretary of the
 all-union central committee.
 From 1949 to 1952 there was an
 unusually high turnover in the
 Ukrainian party leadership,  but

 almost all of those who lost

 in important jobs.   Brezhnev,
 for example, was displaced as
 party boss in Dnepropetrovsk
 Oblast and took over the direc-
 tion of the Moldavian republic
 party in 1950.   Zinovy Serdyuk,
 named a secretary of the repub-
 lic party central committee in
 1949, was transferred to Lvov
 Oblast in 1952; two years later
 he replaced Brezhnev as party
 chief in Moldavia.
 The expansion of
 the presidium at the
 :19th party congress
 in 1952 was evidently
 used by Khrushchev to
 see that his supporters
 got a foot into the
 door of the top ruling
 group.  Of the four
 Ukrainian officials
 elected to the central
 committee,  two--Demyan
 Korotchenko and Leonid
 Melnikov--became full
 members of the presid
 :ium, and Brezhnev was
 elected a central com-
 mittee secretary and
 presidium candidate.
 Both Korotchenko and
 Brezhnev were dropped
 in the revamping of
 the party command after
 Stalin's death but
 later regained their
 prominence.
 In the immediate
 post-Stalin period,
 Khrushchev proceeded
 somewhat slowly in
 transferring Ukrainian
 functionaries into
 vital spots,  and the
 situation in the re-
 public's leadership
 remained comparatively
 stable from 1953 to
 1955.   As his hold on
 the first secretaryship
 tightened, however, he
 began openly to assign
 his trusted lieutenants
 to important jobs.
 While the February
 1954 reassignment of
 Brezhnev as second--
 and later first--secretary of
 the Kazakh party seems to have
 grown out of the inauguration
 of the "virgin: lands program"
 that month, the assignment of
 Serdyuk as Moldavian party chief
 and of A.  I.  Struyev as party
 boss in Molotov (now Perm) Ob-
 last and the elevation of Kir-
 ichenko to candidate membership
 on  the  party  presidium have
 the   earmarks  of purely   po-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 August 1958
 At the plenum of the cen-
 tral committee in July 1955,
 the decision to convene the 20th
 party congress the following
 February was announced.         There-
 after, Khrushchev made his most
 conspicuous moves ensuring the
 election of former Ukrainian
 co-workers to the new central
 committee; between July and
 December, four officials from
 the Ukraine were transferred
 into RSFSR oblast organizations
 where they would be virtually
 assured of election to the cen-
 tral committee.
 20th Party Congress
 The composition of the 20th
 party congress showed that Khru-
 shchev's operations had paid
 handsome dividends.   The Ukraine
 sent 191 delegates to the con-
 gress, compared with 153 at the
 19th congress.  On the basis of
 one delegate for every 5,000
 members of the party, this in-
 dicated a growth of some 200,000
 in the republic party's member-
 ship since 1952.   Such an in-
 crease alone, however, does not
 account for the fact that the
 Ukrainian representation on the
 central committee was exactly
 doubled.  Whereas four full and
 five candidate members had been
 elected to the committee at
 the 19th congress, eight full
 and ten candidates were named
 in February 1956.
 In addition, all four of
 the Ukrainian party workers
 transferred into RSFSR oblasts
 in the latter half of 1955 be-
 came full members of the central
 committee, as did those who had

 had come from the Ukraine. The
 prominence of the Ukrainian par-
 ty was further shown by the fact
 that,  excluding military fig-
 ures, 34 of the 133 full members
 of the central committee had
 been or were at that time func-
 tionaries of the Ukrainian par-
 ty or government.   Among the
 candidates,  19 out of 121 had
 been service in the Ukraine.
 Post-Congress Developments
 Khrushchev's:,hold on the
 Soviet party was considerably
 stronger after the 20th congress.
 He had, in the central party or-
 gans, not                     only the support of
 his Ukrainian associates, but
 also that of persons he had
 cultivated in Moscow after 1949.
 Particularly since his purge of
 the  antiparty  group in June
 1957 and the accompanying elec-
 tion of three more of his former
 Ukrainian subordinates--Korot-
 chenko, Audrey                                                                  Kirilenko, and
 Vasily Mzhavanadze--as candidate
 members of the party presidium,
 Khrushchev's strength  with-
 in the party  appears                                                             formidable.
 Although Khrushchev's per-
 sonal contact with the Ukrainian
 party organization is no longer
 close,   the Ukraine remains a
 leading  supplier of   cadres.
 Younger men like P.  Ye. Doro-
 shenko, chief of the central
 committee's department of agri-
 culture for the union republics,
 continue to advance  from the
 Ukraine into responsible posts
 at the center. Too young to have
 been members of the  coterie
 formed by Khrushchev during the
 1938-49   period,  they  may owe
 their  advancement  in  part
 to  the patronage of the older
 group from the Ukraine. Now
 that Kirichenko is a full-time
 party secretary, for example,
 he may be influential in filling
 posts with persons who worked
 under him after Khrushchev left
 the Ukraine.                          25X1
