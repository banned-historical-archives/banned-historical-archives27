 "AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES ON ASIA AND THE PACIFIC"
 Sen. John Sparkman
 President-elect Jimmy Carter takes office at a time when
 America's position in Asia and the Pacific is more favorable
 than at any time prior to World War II.
 President Truman was sworn in while World War II was
 still raging: President Eisenhower assumed office amid the
 burden of the Korean War: Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
 inherited both the beginning of America's deep ink.oivemer:t
 ill indochina and a policy to contain China which. with time,
 became counterproductive: President Nixon took office
 after the Southeast Asian involvement had become a full-
 scale war: and President Ford was sworn in as America's
 policy in Indochina was rapidly failing.
 Thus, relative to the problems that recent Presidents have
 faced. President ('arter will be confronted by few pressing
 issues in Asia and the Pacific.
 - American forces are not involved in conflict in Asia.
 Only the 40.000 l S. troops in Korea remain on the Asian
 mainland.
 - Except for relations with Vietnam. Cambodia. Laos and
 North Korea. which are kept distant by choice, relations with
 Japan and all other nations in the region are good.
 - U.S. policy toward China has changed from containment
 to one which recognizes reality.
 -- The dire predictions of a loss of American prestige
 throughout Asia as a consequence of the collapse of
 American-supported regimes in Indochina have not
 materialized.
 - The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has made
 promising steps toward regional cooperation.
 The factors augur well for President Carter as he begins to
 plot a course for American policy in Asia. But the slate is not
 clean. There are potential trouble spots and problems which
 must be dealt with. Among these are:
 1. Of foremost importance is the question of normalizing
 relations with the People's Republic of China. America's
 relations with the country that contains one-fourth the pop-
 ulation of the globe have been at a stalemate since liaison of-
 fices were established in Peking and Washington three and a
 half years ago. The Taiwan issue is the only obstacle to nor-
 malization. I suspect. the U.S. policy of not facing up to this
 problem has been largely for political reasons relating, first,
 to President Nixon's Watergate problems and, later, to
 President Ford's campaign for re-election. Further delay in
 facing up to the Taiwan issue could make the ultimate deci-
 sion more difficult and controversial. I believe that a way can
 be found to protect America's interests in Taiwan.
 2. Nearly a quarter century after the end of their war, the
 basic conflict between North and South Korea remains un-
 resolved. As the last vestige of American military involve-
 ment on the Asian mainland, American troops in South
 Korea maintain units in front-line positions. These United

 Korea Human Rights
 Dear Editor:
 I would like to congratulate Mr. Earl Voss for writing such
 a soothing article-'on "Human Rights" (THE ASIA MAIL.
 Nov. 1976). I certainly enjoyed reading the article and I have
 no doubt that there will be many Koreans as well as our
 American friends who felt the same way as I did about the
 article. I do hope that Mr. Voss' thoughts on Korea will
 reflect in the foreign policy of (the) Carter administration.

 On China Ties
 Dear Editor:
 Thank you for the interesting copy of THE ASIA MAIL. It
 will fill a great need and I wish you success.
 I certainly subscribe to the belief that our relations with
 continental China must be adjusted. I do not believe we are
 justified in sacrificing the interests of the Formosan Chinese
 as we seem now so ready to do.
 Americans seem always so ready to slip back into the old
 sentimental attachment to China, the patronizing missionary
 Big Brother approach now transmuted into political terms.
 Don't let THE ASIA MAIL become a resurrected I.P.R.
 production. Be sure the hard-liners get a hearing as well as
 the China-lovers.
 What are we to do if Chiang Ching-kuo thanks us one day
 for our past help and then announces that he has invited
 Moscow to become his protector and guarantor? I wish one
 of your proposed symposia could review the alternative
 courses that may be possible.

 Prophet of Doom
 Dear Editor:
 Robert Ichord is a prophet of doom. Unfortunately, he's
 right!
 His article "Nuclear Technology Diffusion in Asia" in the
 December issue of THE ASIA MAIL certainly gave me pause
 for considerable reflection.
 It's frightening to think that ten years ago no one in Asia
 had either nuclear power or nuclear weapons. Now, two
 Asian giants are capable of blowing everybody up and -
 from the Ichord article - others will soon follow.
 Ten years from now, who won't have nuclear weapons in
 Asia? That's the question that needs answering. What will
 become of us when the likes of Kim II-sung, Park Chung-hee,
 Ferdinand Marcos and Lee Kuan-yew are armed with
 nuclear weapons?
 President Carter, a nuclear technician, has his work cut
 out for himself.

 Pro-Military Bias
 Dear Editor:
 Your December banner-headline "Thailand Seeks
 Stability" shows the obvious pro-military bias of THE ASIA
 MAIL. Actually. the October 6 coup was the most de-
 stabilizing event to occur in Southeast Asia since the Tonkin
 Gulf incident of ten years ago.
 When Thailand had its democracy. Southeast Asians had a
 chance at regional cooperation in the aftermath of the In-
 dochina war.
 The military coup undermines all possibility of coopera-
 tion and makes another Indochina war inevitable ... hardly
 a "stabilizing" development.

 On Japan's Economic Vitality
 Scott Runkle
 Economic experts are in general agreement that inter-
 national economic recovery will be as critical as it will be dif-
 ficult. The New York Times' leading economic writer,
 Leonard Silk, even states that: "the most acute economic dif-
 ficulties that Mr. Carter is likely to face as President will be
 global".
 In this global context, there exists a little-understood
 paradox as regards Japan. On one hand, U.S. steel and
 electronic manufacturers are increasingly vociferous in their
 protests about American purchases of competitive Japanese
 goods. And in Europe, the outcry against Japanese imports
 becomes ever-louder.
 On the other hand, Japan itself is troubled by the fact that
 its industrial production has slumped for the third month in a
 row, with consumer spending also down, while its inflation is
 hovering around 10 per cent.
 Therein lies a paradox which is worrisome not only to
 Japan, but also to the United States. Japan, lfke the U.S., is
 one of the "locomotive" economies; the health of its $58
 billion market for imports from dozens of nations affects in
 substantial measure the rate of world recovery. Conversely,
 when the Japanese economy is in the doldrums, as it appears
 to be now, international recovery is slowed.
 The ever-closer interdependence of the economies of the
 United States, Japan and Western Europe is one of the
 critical considerations for the U.S. and Japanese
 governments. However, the special circumstances of Japan's
 economy are still little understood in the United States, mak-
 ing it tempting to use Japan (and particularly its export sur-
 plus to the U.S.) as a handy "whipping boy".
 Far more than any other major, industrial nation, Japan
 was severely mauled by the oil crisis of 1973 and its after-
 math. Japan is almost wholly dependent on imported oil (80
 per cent from the Middle East) for its energy, unlike the
 United States, which not only has domestic oil, but also large
 supplies of coal and natural gas. Whereas Japan paid $6
 billion for its oil imports in 1973, it now pays a staggering $20
 billion for a smaller quantity of oil. The oil crisis triggered a
 devastating inflation in Japan (at a yearly rate of over 30 per
 cent at one time) and, when the government had to apply the
 deflationary brakes, caused a severe recession. Moreover,
 Japan ran a large deficit in its balance of payments in this

 difficult period: $10.0 billion in 1973, $6.8 billion in 1974 and
 $2.7 billion in 1975.
 Only in early 1975 did Japan begin to emerge from its
 long recession. As the U.S. economy picked up steam, the de-
 mand for imports of Japanese automobiles, electronic
 products and steel rose sharply. Japan's world-wide exports
 increased by 19 per cent through September 1976. with most
 of this increase reflecting growing demand in the United
 States and other industrialized nations. U.S. imports from
 Japan rose 35 per cent over 1975 (when such imports actually
 dropped 10.4 per cent). Largely on the strength of its buoyant
 export sector, as well as on the expansion of domestic
 demand, Japan's real GNP shot up 13.4 per cent in the first
 quarter of 1976, but grew only 4.5 per cent in the second
 quarter and, according to Japan's Economic Planning Agen-
 cy, slumped to 1.3 per cent growth in the third quarter.
 Because its recovery was slower and shallower than that of
 the United States, Japans' overall imports rose only 10.5 per
 cent in the first three quarters of 1976, making for a con-
 siderable global trade surplus during this period. As the year
 progressed. however, export growth slowed (as predicted)
 while imports picked up more rapidly.
 The most dramatic increase in Japan's imports was from
 developing nations, and notably those of Asia. Most Asian
 nations registered a sharp increase in their exports to Japan
 in 1976, and those of South Korea. Taiwan. Singapore and
 Malaysia were up by 50 per cent to 100 per cent in the first
 nine months of 1976. greatly stimulating the economic
 recovery of these nations.
 At first glance. Japan's trade position looks enviable.
 However, Japan imports far more services than it exports
 and it must therefore export more goods than it imports -
 an important but inadequately understood factor in its
 foreign economic relations. This is the reverse of Great
 Britain, for example. which traditionally has a surplus in "in-
 visible trade" to offset a trade deficit. This "invisible" factor
 is so important for Japan that "the Japanese economy could
 not survive without a surplus of trade balance," as explained
 by the Embassy's Financial Minister, Mr. Fujio Matsumuro,
 speaking in late 1976 before the National Foreign Trade
 Council in New York.
 In the first nine months of 1976. Japan's invisible trade
 balance (mostly transportation, insurance. tourism and
 repatriation of profits) was $4.6 billion in deficit, while its
 merchandise balance of trade was $6.6 billion in surplus -
 making a net surplus of $2 billion. Moreover. almost all of
 Japan's invisible deficit is with the United States and
 Western European countries. In 1974, for example, its total
 invisible deficit was $5.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion was
 with the United States and $1.5 billion with Great Britain.
 Thanks to its merchandise trade surplus, Japan showed a
 modest balance of payments surplus of $2.2 billion during the
 first 10 months of 1976, after three years in which it suffered
 an aggregate deficit of $19.6 billion. While this short-term
 reversal is welcome. it constitutes no bonanza for Japan.
 which will still show a huge four-year (1972 through 1976)
 deficit of approximately $17 billion in its balance of
 payments. This, rather than Japan's current (and possibly
 short-lived) surplus in its merchandise trade balance, is the
 salient fact of Japan's international economic position.
 In sum, weighing the invisible deficit against the merchan-
 dise surplus. Japan is by no means taking advantage of its
 trading partners. nor is it "getting rich" on its apparent trade
 surplus.
 What about Japan's exports to the United States' Japan
 does not force its products on American consumers, nor are
 these products produced by "cheap labor", nor are they
 "dumped" in the U.S. market. Today. Japanese goods are
 often more expensive than comparable American-made
 merchandise. and must compete on the basis of quality and
 reliability. Typical examples of this are Sony color TV sets,
 which cost $50 to $100 more than most other sets of com-
 parable size, and Nikon cameras. which are prized for their
 quality despite high price tags. Likewise. Japanese cars are
 sought after by American consumers as being high in quality.
 style and dependability, not necessarily because they are
 cheap.
 American consumers have shown great preference for
 such Japanese products. During the first 10 months of 1976.
 although sales of foreign cars in the U.S. decreased to 14.9
 per cent of the total U.S. market compared with 19.3 per cent
 last year. Japanese cars were so popular that they
 represented 60.5 per cent of total import sales as contrasted
 with 51.3 per cent in 1975. Toyota and Datsun are the best-
 selling imports, with Honda now overtaking Volkswagen for
 third place.
 Likewise in electronics, Japanese tape recorders, stereo
 sets. pocket computers, color TV sets and CB radios are in
 heavy demand by American consumers (7.7 million Japanese
 CB sets alone were imported in the first 9 months of 1976).
 Steel is another matter, where price is important. but
 where Japanese mills have no built-in advantage. On the con-
 trary, overall raw material costs of iron ore, coking coal and
 energy are actually higher in Japan than in the United States,
 and wages (including fringe benefits) are comparable. Yet
 Japanese steel is highly competitive in world markets,
 primarily because of modern equipment. advanced
 technology and high productivity.
 Indeed, production costs of Japan's steel industry soared
 by 56.3 per cent (mostly in raw material and energy costs) in
 the period 1970-75, while production costs in the United
 States were up only 9.3 per cent. Even with this disadvan-
 tage, Japan's steel prices for heavy plates and sheets (for ex-
 ample) rose substantially less than comparable U.S. prices.
 thereby improving the competitive position of Japanese steel
 in world markets and even in the United States.
 A striking illustration of Japan's handicap is coking coal.
 Japan's coking coal comes mostly from West Virginia - the
 same source for Pittsburgh's steel mills. But whereas this
 coal travels only a few dozen miles to Pittsburgh. to get to
 Japan it must go by train to Newport News, Virginia before
 making the long sea voyage to Japan. Despite such intrinsic
 disadvantages, Japan's exports of finished steel were 33
 million tons in 1975, of which 9.9 million went to Asia. 6.3
 million to the United States. 5 million to the Middle East and
 4.1 million to Western Europe. The United States bought
 less than 20 per cent of Japan's steel exports in 1975. con-
 trasted with 53 per cent in 1968.) In 1975. moreover. in order
 to produce this steel, Japan bought $1.7 billion of U.S. coking
 coal and $277 million of U.S. scrap.
 The competitive position of Japanese products in U.S. and
 world markets has been obtained despite Japan's almost
 total lack of raw materials and energy, and despite its great
 distance from most large industrial markets. Basically,
 Japan must "live on its wits" and its skills as a processing
 economy, being alert to marketing new products quickly and
 taking advantage of new techniques for producing them ef-
 ficiently.
 Examples of alert Japanese entrepreneurship are
 numerous, ranging from the early introduction by Japan of
 transistorized radios and TV sets to development of relative-
 ly pollution-free automobiles well before Detroit. Looking
 toward the future, Japan has already developed a new
 electric car which has a range of 300 miles without charging
 batteries and a top speed of 60 miles per hour.
 Not only do Japanese consumer products meet a real de-
 mand and need in the United States (and in many other
 countries) but, in the case of steel, the availability of
 efficiently-produced and price-competitive Japanese steel is
 an important deterrent to inflation in an industry which has a
 long history of inflating prices in the absence of such com-
 petition.
 Nonetheless, despite high consumer demand for Japanese
 products, U.S. steel and electronics manufacturers are ex-
 pected to press for new protectionist barriers against
 Japanese products in early 1977. They are expected to point
 to Japan's trade surplus with the United States as evidence

 On Tokyo's Steel Exports
 Richard P. Simmons
 The U.S. Steel industry is continually being urged to achieve
 a greater degree of economic efficiency and, indeed, we are
 committed as an industry to allocate huge sums to this ongo-
 ing goal. But domestic industry competitiveness is only one
 side of the economic equation. Another side is foreign trade
 policy.
 If the U.S. and international trade policies are such that
 they condone or ignore practices by which other
 governments through agreements or understandings can
 manipulate access to the American market - without our
 knowledge or without our concurrence as a government --
 then these policies need to be overhauled. Otherwise. the
 domestic steel industry and its workers are operating under a
 false premise, namely. that increased productivity and ef-
 ficiency are the answer to foreign competition.
 Our steel industry which provides the country with its
 supply of steel mill products. is a major industrial compo-
 nent of the U.S. economy. Combined steel company employ-
 ment approximates 700.000 persons. including those in
 mining.  transportation  and  other  non-steel  related
 operations. In 1975. these workers received almost $10 billion
 in wages and salaries.
 Manufacturing companies and other users requiring steel
 as their basic raw material. employ millions of workers of
 the U.S. economy. Before they can allocate capital for expan-
 sion. they must have guaranteed access to an assured source
 of steel for at least a major portion of their requirements.
 Thus economic growth in the U.S. and growth of industrial
 job opportunities depend in substantial part on an adequate
 supply of steel.
 But just as the United States can no longer take for granted
 the adequacy of its national energy supply. neither can it
 assume that the future supply of steel will always be ade-
 quate for our national requirements. Formidable economic
 barriers to the necessary expansion of steelmaking capacity
 are a major concern of the American steel industry. They are
 also at the heart of the world steel industry's concern.
 It is clear our domestic economy needs an expansion of
 steelmaking capacity if our economy is to continue to grow
 and if we are to remain strong as a nation.
 The current outlook gives us no assurance that the substan-
 tial gap between the steel .industry's capital requirements
 and its potential future sources of funds can be bridged. If
 profitability and capital availability do not improve, the
 economic consequences are obvious: scarcities of many steel
 products: fewer new jobs created: fewer existing jobs main-
 tained. slower economic growth and increased dependency
 on uncertain foreign sources.
 Steel expansion must occur in this country. if the U.S. is to
 have a supply adequate for future growth conditions. And
 from the viewpoint of real comparative advantage, it makes
 sense to expand in the ITS.. since our industry is now one of
 the two most efficient low-cost producers in the world, with
 an ample home supply of raw materials.
 Steel. for the past fifteen years. has been a deficit account
 in the U.S. balance of trade. Last year imports into the
 United States exceeded exports by $2.2 billion. For the first
 nine months of this year, the deficit is already $1.9 billion.
 Compared to the rest of the world. the American steel in-
 dustry ranks among a diminishing minority. We operate as a
 private enterprise industry within a world steel industry
 directly and indirectly supported by foreign governments.
 Today an estimated 44' of world raw steel production is un-
 der direct government ownership.
 Foreign government ownership and subsidies in steelmak-
 ing do not necessarily create an efficient steel industry. and
 are not something we envy. On this score. the American in-
 dustry's business performance can be compared to that of its
 leading world competitors. With respect to productivity of
 capital. although inadequate by any yardstick. the U.S. in-
 dustry is clearly the world leader in return on assets
 employed. With respect to the efficiency of labor utilization
 -- that is man hours per ton produced -- our industry and
 Japan's - about equal --are the world leaders.
 But foreign government ownership. subsidies. and social
 policies do affect the international conditions under which
 we must compete both at home and abroad. Labor is regard-
 ed as a fixed cost in many foreign steel industries. In order to
 maintain employment in their own steel sectors. foreign
 suppliers come into market on the low side of the cycle with
 imports at prices not reflecting their full costs of production.
 and therefore their true comparative advantage. They leave
 on the high cycles. The cyclical swings for the t1 S. producers
 are thus amplified, resulting in less efficient production.
 higher costs. and discouraging future investment. The im-
 January 1977.     Tjie Asia Mail
 pact on U.S. steel employment is naturally traumatic. We ful-
 ly understand that,if we want our kind of economy to con-
 tinue. then competition must prevail not only with other
 economies. but among ourselves. We do not want to cartelize
 the steel industry and would refuse to participate in any
 arrangements designed to fix production rates or prices in
 our own or world markets.. even if proferred to us. We do not
 want trade policy assistance from our government but we do
 not know how to compete with foreign companies who do
 not have to earn a profit or generate capital for investment.
 Nor do we intend to ignore the increasingly blatant violation
 of U.S. and international law in the trade area.
 We shall continue to press for steel sector discussions in
 GATT, to alleviate the problems inherent in governmental
 intervention in steel trade and foreign commercial practices
 which reflect these interventions. Unless a concerted effort
 is undertaken by the U.S. and other steel producing nations
 to respond to the need for a truly effective steel sector
 negotiation. we can only look forward to continued inter-
 national trade friction in steel. It would be a sad commentary
 if lack of cooperation among governments were to yield
 negative rather than positive results in the steel trade sector.
 As to the current arrangement between Europe and Japan.
 unfortunately. the evidence we are presenting here today
 does not apply just to a one-time agreement through the year
 1976. There is clear evidence that steel restraint agreements
 between Europe and Japan. if allowed, are bound to con-
 tinue into the future. And the evidence indicates that such
 agreements will develop between Europe and other
 countries exporting steel to the EEC.
 For our government officials who are concerned about
 trade liberalization, these developments taking place in the
 world steel market should be cause for consternation. Let me
 cite some facts. Imports into most of the developing
 countries are already controlled, largely to protect their
 domestic steel industries. Japan is a closed market for im-
 ports: only 200.000 metric tons were imported in 1974. The
 European Economic Community is rapidly becoming a con-
 trolled market for imports.
 The result: only the United States. and a few smaller ex-
 traneous markets remain free and open to imports. Is this
 what trade liberalization is all about? Should we stand idly by
 as a government and permit the constriction of world steel
 trade to take place, while thereby increasing the deflection of
 steel into the United States market? Let me read from the In-
 dustrial Bank of Japan. September. 1976 Quarterly Sum-
 mary:
 "Turning to market geography. the creation of an export
 cartel within the Japanese steel industry means that a cut-
 back in exports to the expanded EEC market will probably
 be unavoidable. This phenomenon should be balanced out by
 major growth in exports both to the United States and those
 two giants of the Communist world. China and the Soviet
 union. For an industry like steel. which had to withstand the
 cold blast of the 1975 recession. the bright prospects for 1976
 exports and the economic recovery they will fuel is a warm-
 ing sign indeed."
 To condone this parceling of the international
 marketplace. with the U.S. the one major open world
 market. is to condone the perpetuation of a double standard
 for steel trade policy. If our industry is efficient and cost
 competitive. should it be weakened by bilateral actions large-
 ly of other nations who seek protection of their home
 markets and free access to ours'' This is what our case is all
 about.
 Let me call your attention to some recent developments
 which lend support to my contention that we are witnessing
 only the beginning of trade-deflecting bilateral
 arrangements.
 On July 21. 1976 the European Commission came forward
 with a document entitled. "The Problems of the Steel In-
 dustry". The document is popularly known as the Simonet
 Plan. referring to Mr. Simonet who is a member of the EC
 and   whose   responsibilities   include   the  Steel
 Directorate. The Simonet Plan consists essentially of three
 parts:
 1. Analysis and continuous statistical monitoring of the
 steel markets:
 2. Improved coordination of investment trends leading
 eventually to equilibrium between supply and demand: and
 3. Initiation of appropriate procedures in the event of a
 crisis. on the basis of indicators defined in advance.
 What concerns us as an industry and should concern the
 trade officials in the U.S. Government is how under part
 three  the E('  intends  to regulate imports of steel
 duringperiods of self-proclaimed "crisis." As we understand
 the anti-crisis plan which is to become operational in early
 1977, the Commission intends to issue production guidelines
 and to fix minimum reference prices in a crisis situation.
 But. for the domestic measures to be effective, the Com-
 munity plan intends that steel imports will be indexed to
 production.
 How does the Simonet plan propose to regulate imports?
 Permit me to quote from a recent European report sum-
 marizing Mr. Simoneh's statement before a meeting on
 November 25 of the ECSC Consultative Committee:
 "... it is not a question of fixing import quotas, but by
 negotiation the Commission will merely try to secure a
 reasonable attitude from the steel exporting countries who
 should be able to adapt their deliveries to the Common
 Market to the production cuts adopted by the Community
 steel industry."
 During the course of the debate on November 25, a
 representative of the French iron and steel industry
 reportedly stated that "the fixing of import quotas should be
 avoided since this is bound to lead to retaliatory measures
 which would affect other economic sectors of the Com-
 munity." A representative of the Luxembourg iron and steel
 industry "stressed," according to the report. that "the
 success of the anti-crisis plan will largely depend on the ex-
 tent to which certain third countries agree to limit their ex-
 ports. The ideal solution would be for these reductions to
 correspond to the production cuts made by the European in-
 dustry."
 So. here we are confronted with a plan that may become
 effective in a few weeks in which the European Common
 Market is emphasizing its intent to encourage restraint
 arrangements with Japan and other steel exporting countries
 whenever the European steel market is in a crisis situation.
 The European objective is clear: Avoid the imposition of
 formal import quotas because this may lead to GATT com-
 plications and the threat of retaliation: instead, achieve
 restraint of trade by use of so-called voluntary bilateral
 restraints which are simply transparent ploys to avoid ac-
 cusations that such agreements are clear violations of GATT.
 It should not come as a surprise to those involved in mul-
 tilateral trade negotiations that cooperation has not been
 forthcoming from the EEC or Japan on the issue of steel sec-
 tor trade negotiations. or on reform of the GATT safeguard
 procedures. In fact, why should we expect any such coopera-
 tion when the European Coal and Steel Community develops
 bilateral solutions to their problems while continuing their
 policy of increasing exports to the U.S.?
 Moreover. as long as Europe continues to exert voluntary
 bilateral pressure on Japan and other exporting nations to
 restrain steel imports. GATT Article XIX dealing with
 safeguards will be meaningless. Japan may also wish to avoid

 The Dimensions
 Of Sufism
 Mystical Dimensions of Islam
 By Annemarie Schimmel
 The University of North Carolina Press
 1975, 506 pps. $14.95.
 Bernice Williams Foley
 In the author's own estimation, writing about Sufism. which
 succinctly can be defined: "To find joy in the heart when
 grief comes," is a difficult, almost impossible task. And yet,
 Annemarie Schimmel. Professor of lndo-Muslim Culture at
 Harvard University. has accomplished the impossible, as it
 were, and has reached her goal in her chapters on this
 religion's theosophic speculations, its history. psychology
 and its mystical Persian poetry.
 I.7aism is the accepted name for Islamic mysticism. Its two
 iiiajor facets, scholarly theoretical discourses and popular
 saint worship. bring to the devotees of Sufism the under-
 standing that they have spiritually reached only what is
 already within themselves.
 Historically, the origin and early development of this
 mysticism of the East were generated out of Muhammad's
 own mysticism. Several specific theories attest to the above
 statement. These, explained by the author, will interest
 scholarly students. For the general reader, the portion of the
 book devoted to Persian and Turkish mystical poetry has
 great appeal. These poetic lines may be interpreted either as
 mystical or erotic, and the dissension between these two
 schools of thought is deep. Then - in a brief and surprising
 statement -- the author denigrates both of these theories of
 interpretation by writing. "Yet both claims are equally wide
 of the mark."
 Professor Schimmel believes that, in the typical lyric
 poetry of these eastern countries. certain Islamic images
 taken from the Koran and the Prophetic tradition can turn
 into symbols of a purely aesthetic character. There is scarce-
 ly a poem of the greatest masters of Persian. Turkish and
 Urdu poetry that does not reflect the religious background of
 Islamic culture. One must not look, therefore, for either a
 purely mystical or for a purely profane interpretation of
 these poems. Their ambiguity is intended. The poetry of
 Sufism is a hybrid of the mystical and erotic. The author
 declares that English translations lose much in opalescence
 She stresses the importance of poetry in the study of Sufism
 and she devotes many pages to this study. quoting poetic
 lines and interpreting their meanings.
 The Islamic roots of Sufism are deep. "Sufism is to possess
 nothing and to be possessed by nothing." In its formative
 period. Sufism meant mainly an interiorization of Islam and
 the declaration that God is One. The Sufis have always
 remained within Islam They designated Adam as the first
 Sufi. endowed with God's spirit. After Adam's fall, he did
 penitence in India for 300 years until he became a true Sufi.
 The words of the Koran are the cornerstone of Sufic
 mysticism. Herein are the beginnings of the Muslim belief in
 free will and predestination. an unusual combination.
 Muhammad is the first link in the spiritual chain of Sufism.
 These mystics equate all earthy governments with evil. They
 believe in color symbolism, with green being the highest and
 heavenly color. They have the same spiritual divisions of
 Heaven which correspond to those named in the Christian
 Bible, the Terrestial. Telestial and Celestial Kingdoms of
 God. These are the degrees of Heaven to which the souls
 proceed after death. The degree is determined by that per-
 son's purification achieved while still it his mortal body.
 Fasting and sleeplessness are important parts of Sufism.
 If this author has omitted any important facet of Sufism
 during its historical development and that of its literature
 (chiefly poetry). this reviewer is not aware of it.
 Professor Schimmel's balanced treatment offers the
 reader a fine. overall concept of mysterious Sufism. She ex-
 plores its psychology and its religious orders. Her emphasis
 on Islamic poetry is justified. The reader is not surprised to
 learn from the inside jacket that Annemarie Schimmel has
 had long acquaintance with and personal knowledge of
 Turkey. Iran and the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent. She has
 published numerous books and translations in German.
 Arabic and Turkish.
 To paraphrase two lines in this book which read. "A man
 asked Abu Hats. Who is a Sufi:" " -- we can say: the reader
 of this volume will never again ask 'who is a Sufi." because
 he now knows.

 Problems for President Carter
 Future of U.S. Military in Asia
 Stefan H. Leader
 When President Carter takes office on January 20th he will
 find U.S. military forces in Asia and the Pacific in a state of
 flux and uncertainty with numerous policy issues in need of
 early attention. He will have the opportunity to exercise
 strong leadership and make several important decisions on
 the future of these "forward deployed" U.S. military units.
 and by so-doing. put his personal mark on U.S. Asian policy.
 There are now about 134,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors. airmen
 and marines scattered across Asia and the Western Pacific.
 The bulk of these forces are in Japan 145.000). South Korea
 (40.000), the Philippines 114.600), Guam (9,600), or aboard
 the 50 warships of the Navy's Seventh Fleet (18.900). The
 remainder are scattered among Australia (700). Taiwan
 (2200), Thailand (1200). Midway and Johnson Islands (about
 1.000 total).
 The largest U.S. military force in Asia is in South Korea.
 and consists of about 33,000 soldiers, most with the Second
 Infantry Division, and about 7,100 airmen supporting three
 squadrons of F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers. The Navy has
 only a very small force of about 200 officers and men in South
 Korea. The U.S. also maintains about 600 nuclear weapons in
 South Korea and U.S. officials have said they might be used
 in the event of war.
 U.S. ground troops and nuclear weapons in South Korea
 were significant political issues in the U.S. even before
 Jimmy Carter raised questions about them in the course of
 his campaign. Carter's assertion, that if elected he would
 withdraw U.S. ground forces and nuclear weapons from
 South Korea, focused public attention on the matter once
 again. Revelations about the oppressive policies of the Park
 government and its use of bribery to foster a favorable
 climate of opinion in the U.S. Congress have eroded support
 for the U.S. presence in South Korea and could give Carter
 Carter
 (Continued From Page 1)
 States forces inevitably will be involved in fighting if there is
 an outbreak of hostilities. The tree-cutting incident which
 resulted in the death of two American officers and the subse-
 quent reinforcement of U.S. forces in the area clearly il-
 lustrates the dangers inherent in the Korean situation.
 Unfortunately, the continued presence of these troops has
 been made to appear to he the symbol of the American com-
 mitment to Koeea. Yet, the commitment to Korea is contain-
 ed in the mutual security treaty with that country which
 pledges that. in the event of an armed attack on South Korea,
 the I U.S. will "act to meet the common danger in accordance
 with its constitutional processes." That commitment will re-
 main regardless of haw many American troops are on the
 scene.
 During the recent campaign. President-elect Carter stated
 that he favored withdrawing U.S. ground forces "over a time
 span to be determined after consultation with both South
 Korea and .Japan." This basic approach was endorsed by
 former Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird who said in a
 recent interview: "South Korea doesn't need our ground
 troops. American manpower is not the important thing:
 South Korea has a two-to-one edge on the ground." The
 defusing of the Korean situation will be one of the most sen-
 sitive and vexing problems confronting the new Ad-
 ministration.
 3. Indochina is an area which also deserves early attention
 by the President. It is time for American policy toward
 Southeast Asia to look to the future and not the past. The
 Ford Administration policy of opposing trade or other
 elations with Vietnam. Cambodia and Laos, of vetoing Viet-
 nam's application for admission to the United Nations and of
 refusing to send an Ambassador to Laos has not been effec-
 tive. This policy has not obtained information about
 America's missing-in-action and it is out of step with the
 policies being pursued by the non-Communist nations of
 Southeast Asia. I am now persuaded that unless there is a
 change in policies by the Vietnamese and Cambodians we are
 far more likely to obtain information about our missing-in-
 action through normal relations than through continuation of
 the existing policy.
 strong congressional support for a phased reduction of U.S.
 ground troops in South Korea.
 President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger have
 insisted that no changes be made in U.S. military forces in
 South Korea on the grounds that any change in the status quo
 would be destabilizing. They have expressed concern that
 any withdrawal of U.S. forces might be seen as a sign of
 weakness and might tempt an attack.
 The future of U.S. military forces and bases in the Philip-
 pines is also under a cloud as a result of efforts by the Marcos
 government to alter the terms under which the U.S. makes
 use of its three bases in the Philippines, the Subic Bay Naval
 Base, Clark Air Force Base and Cubi Point Naval Air Station.
 Negotiations have been under way since April 1976 on the
 future status of these U.S. bases. The, Philippinos have
 demanded that the U.S. acknowledge nominal Philippine
 sovereignty over the bases by flying the Philippine flag and
 appointing Philippine commanders. In addition the Marcos
 government has demanded annual rental payments. This
 could take the form of cash, additional military aid or both.
 The attitude of President-elect Carter on the Philippine
 base issue is a source of some uncertainty. It is possible that
 Carter's interest in the moral dimension of foreign policy -
 particularly human rights issues - could lead the new Ad-
 ministration to take a somewhat more critical look at the
 Marcos government and U.S. ties to it. If this were to occur it
 could have major ramifications for the U.S. military
 presence in the Philippines.
 Another area where the future of U.S. ties is uncertain is
 Taiwan. U.S. military forces on Taiwan have declined steadi-
 ly since the U.S. and China signed the Shanghai cqmmunique
 in 1972. and will probably continue to decline. However, a
 substantial number of the 2200 military personnel remaining
 on Taiwan are involved in mainland oriented intelligence ac-
 tivities and there is some reluctance in the intelligence com-
 4. Although relations with Japan are good, they could be
 better. In the past. American policy has too often taken
 Japan for granted. There should be closer consultation and
 cooperation between the countries than in the past and there
 should be no more shocks. as in the Nixon Administration.
 5. In the Philippines, the negotiations for continuation of
 the U.S. bases are likely to remain in abeyance until the new
 Administration has time to assess the situation. With
 goodwill on both sides and an appreciation of the importance
 of the bases to both countries and to stability in the Pacific. I
 am confident that satisfactory arrangements can be worked
 out.
 6. The October military coup in Thailand. which threw out
 a fledgling parliamentary system, could eventually present
 the United States with a dilemma. The final departure of
 American military forces from Thailand last July was in the
 interest of both countries. Any overture by the new Thai
 government to turn back the clock in this respect should be
 examined very carefully. In view of the smouldering in-
 surgency in the northeast. Vietnamese suspicions of the new
 government, and the existence of the multilateral SEATO
 treaty which has practical application only to Thailand. the
 seeds for trouble in Thailand may sprout. I hope that the new
 Administration will be cautious in this situation.
 7. Congressional concern over human rights matters is par-
 ticularly acute when considering foreign aid provisions for
 South Korea. the Philippines and Indonesia.
 Congress has taken an active interest in foreign policy
 matters relating to Asia in recent years and I expect that it
 will continue to do so. President-elect Carter is well aware of
 Congress' determination to play a more active role in the
 shaping of foreign policy, as demonstrated by his November
 23 meeting with the members of the Senate and House Com-
 mittees which have primary responsibility for foreign policy
 matters. The spirit of his meeting with members of the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Relations is a good omen for future
 cooperation between the President and the Congress.
 In summary. while the Asian scene surveyed by the newly
 inaugurated President Carter is likely to be basically benign,
 potential troubles lie ahead, and there is an agenda for ac-
 tion.
 munity to move these activities elsewhere. Assuming a con-
 tinuing commitment by the new Administration to improved
 relations with the PRC a solution to this problem will have to
 be found.
 The future of the mutual defense treaty with the
 Nationalist government of Chiang Ching Kuo, presents a
 somewhat more difficult problem. Recently Senatoo Man-
 sfield returned from a trip to the People's Republic and urg-
 ed immediate termination of the U.S. treaty with Taiwan.
 Mansfield's statement has already generated opposition from
 other senators. The future of the U.S. treaty with Taiwan will
 undoubtedly be a difficult issue for the new Administration
 even if the withdrawal of U.S. troops is not.
 A final issue of some importance involves the future of the
 Seventh Fleet in the Western Pacific. For years the Seventh
 Fleet and its powerful aircraft carriers has been the domi-
 nant military force in the region. It still is. Navy philosophy
 has been "keep as much of the fleet deployed as far forward
 as possible." Recently, however, budgetary restraints and
 overhaul backlogs have forced the Navy to look at the
 possibility of reduced forward deployments.

 True Confessions'of a U.S.
 Foreign Service Wife...
 Bailey Morris
 In many ways. Nina Hudson's is a tale of survival, the story
 of a woman who learned to manage as a dependent. as "com-
 pany baggage'' in a bureaucratic system that doesn't bend for
 individuals.
 There are no real villains in Hudson's story. but to women
 like her. it is a dark and forbidding chronical of loneliness
 and ultimate frustration.
 She speaks of the other side of a life traditionally thought
 of as glamorous. filled with foreign travel, high-level
 diplomatic contacts and sparkling functions.
 .And though it has taken nine years to bring Hudson to the
 point where she can talk about it. even now. she is a little
 hesitant. She doesn't want to embarrass anyone. doesn't
 want to denigrate the life. doesn't want to expose her hus-
 band and herself.
 She feels strongly. however. that something needs to be
 said about the frustration. about the spouses of foreign ser-
 vice officers driven to illegal work. to divorce and even to
 medical evacuation.
 Only recently. she says. .she heard that the State ])apart-
 ment is studying the divorce rate among foreign service
 employees and ''mediyacs'  medical evacuations) of women
 with nervous conditions brought on by their lives in foreign
 countries.  11 has gotten to be quite a problem." she says.
 so imam people have been medically evacuated from
 different posts
 A State Iepartment medical officer said there is no such
 study- underway although at one time such a study had been
 considered ..We did have an accumulated list which iden-
 tified individuals but with the passage of the I'rivacv Act we
 either had to declare it or destroy it and we destroyed it.'' he
 explained. A meaningful study would have involved the in-
 dividuals, he said. However. the Department does have "the
 number'' of medical evacuations which have occurred over
 the past five years because of psychiatric problems.
 alcoholism or drugs. The rate of medivacs seems relatively
 stable from year to year, the officer said. and involves less
 than 100 persons annually.)
 Nina Hudson has been hack in this country for only a few
 weeks   after three years overseas   and it is clear that she
 is a stronger person now than when she left
 Speaking in a soft southern voice. her finely-sculptured
 mouth pursing and relaxing as she talks. Hudson tells about
 making it to the mid-career level of foreign service life  but
 not wilfirrut great cost.
 The lite has taken her to three foreign countries where she
 has gone underground. so to speak. in order to work illegally
 at two of the three posts-
 . There are lots of people who have gone around) these
 rules r the work permit and job laws in foreign countries) and
 solved their individual problems but it's always awkward for
 them because they hays to face the fact that they're breaking
 the Lm  She explains
 Once. when offered a job she couldn't hear to turn down.
 Ifudson tried to give up her diplomatic immunity but was ad-
 vised that she couldn t   not unless she wanted to become a
 test case
 _( wing up diplomatic immunity often comes tip in comver-
 sation oycrscas but vou're always told you can't do it
 that you 11 have to give up everything. including commissary
 privileges.'' she savs.
 I nable to cut through the tangle of rules and regulations at
 her last post. Hudson made an illegal arrangement which
 allowed her to work professionally as a textile designer And
 she feels better for it
 To understand what finally pushed Hudson into accepting
 a well-paying job and organizing a women's action group at
 her last post. it is necessary to go back to the beginning.
 Leaning forward. pushing a hand through her frosted,
 brown curls, Hudson speaks of her first years as a foreign ser-
 vice wife.
 She. like many- others, was 'thrilled'' by the prospect of
 the life. When her husband's first assignment turned out to
 be "a good European post," it seemed even better.
 At that time, she thought of herself in the traditional roles
 of wife and mother. 'When we went overseas. I thought that
 we would have a family ... I thought that I would take on
 January. 1977      The Asia Mail
 the roles of chief cook and bottle washer and I was happy to
 do it.'' she says.
 But that didn't happen. ''We didn't have a family so it
 wasn't enough to just sit at home." she explains. Nor was it
 enough for her to involve herself in the activities which were
 then required of foreign services spouses.
 Chuckling. half with amusement and half with distaste. she
 describes her first dealings with an ambassador's wife - the
 chatelaine of the mission.
 'She the ambassador's wife) had written a book on social
 usage and she was very rigid ... Every month she had a
 coffee for embassy wives which you were required to
 attend." Hudson says.
 You had to go unless you were sick and called in to say
 you couldn't he there ... you had to be there a few minutes
 before the doors were opened and if you were late. the doors
 were closed and you weren't allowed in," she explains.
 "I was young then and down at the bottom of the totem
 pole so I just sort of did these things routinely, without
 questioning." she says.
 Still. she remembers being "inwardly horrified" about it
 all. Specific incidents stand out in her mind. Once, for ex-
 ample, one of Hudson's friends "was called down in public
 and severely reprimanded for not having attended a coffee."
 This sort of thing couldn't happen now, not since 1972
 when spouses were declared independent and therefore not
 required to participate in any foreign service activities. Still,
 it stands out in Hudon's mind as the incident that spurred
 her into taking one of the first steps in her quest for personal
 independence. "Everything ... has been built on top of
 something else." she says.
 Hudson remained active - going to school, learning the
 language and fighting the work permit problem. She also
 continued her search for odd. jobs, though remaining essen-
 tially a "homemaker" in a foreign country.
 "Most foreign service people are very resourceful ... if
 they are not working. they go out and explore the country.
 learn the language ... The ones who don't do this are the
 ones who have real problems." she says.
 At some point   Hudson's not quite sure when - dis-
 illusionment set in.
 "The romance of anything new just lasts for so long and
 then. you want depth." she says. "Suddenly. it's the super-
 ficiality of the existence that's disturbing."
 For awhile. she says. the entertaining and parties had been
 fun. But it didn't remain that way.

 Five years before the near-bankruptcy of New York, The Washington Monthly, the liberal
 magazine that questions liberal orthodoxy, began its attack on the swollen bureaucracies with
 articles called "We're All Working for the Penn Central" and "America the Featherbedded."
 We then questioned the high salaries and pensions enjoyed by civil servants and warned of
 the growing power of public employees' unions.
 The Washington Monthly has been ahead of its time in many other ways. It was the first
 magazine to reveal the political contributions of the dairy lobby, and in ill article that won
 two of journalism's most distinguished awards, the first to tell of the Army's spying on
 civilian politics.
 It was the first to reveal the Nixon impoundments, the first to report why Congress didn't
 investigate Watergate before the election, and in so doing, became the first monthly magazine
 to do original reporting about Watergate. In an article that won yet another award, it told
 "Why the White House Press Didn't Get the Watergate Story."
 Our article on the dangers of nuclear hijacking was a year ahead of The New Yorker's.
 Our case against social security was made two years before Harper's. And two years before
 Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.'s The Imperial Presidency, we published "The Prince and His Courtiers

 Bargains Down Under
 Ruth Lor Malloy
 IT'S A GOOD TIME TO BUY A KANGAROO. The recent
 171Z`- decrease in the cost of the Australian dollar means
 171'2 lower prices there for North American visitors.
 For example. the Austrail Pass which used to be $135 for
 14 days of first class rail travel in Australia, now is $111
 Air fares to Australia even on QL'ANTAS, however. are not
 affected.
 KOREAN AIRLINES makes a bid in the cheapest-air-fare-
 to-Asia department with a $650 round trip fare from Los
 Angeles to either Seoul. Taipei or Manila. This is still more
 than the $493 San Francisco to Hong Kong rate of the Asian-
 American Recreation Club mentioned last month.
 There are advantages though. You book only 10 days in ad-
 vance, not Asian-American's 35. You fly on regularly
 scheduled flights with no chance of cancellation, the airlines'
 clerk insisted.
 But you do have to stay 30 days -- not 29 or 35. For flights
 to Taipei and Seoul, you have a choice also of 60 or 90 days.
 There are no stop-overs.
 Flights can be booked through any travel agent or phone
 (800) 421-8200. There are two flights a week.
 NEW YORK-KABUL-NEW YORK on a 7 to 120 day excur-
 sion is another bargain at $735. Passengers fly Pan-Am. Air
 India. Lufthansa or British Airways to London or Frankfurt
 and then change to Ariana.
 Ariana Afghan Airlines is at 535 Fifth Avenue. Suite 1609.

 THINKING OF ADOPTING an Asian child? Here's what
 some American adoption agencies and volunteers are saying:
 - It is best to keep a child in his biological family and the
 best way to do this is to help the family as a group. Next
 choice is to place the familyless child in an adoptive home in
 his own country. If these two cannot be done. then place-
 ment in an adoptive family in another country is
 recommended.
 -- Most of the adoptable children come from South Korea.
 One agency. Holt, is also working in the Philippines and ex-
 pects to be ''opening adoptions in Thailand in the foreseeable
 future." Kathy Sreedhar and Americans for International
 Aid find homes for Indian children.
 - The number of infants needing overseas homes is
 decreasing in Korea because of increasing adoptions by
 Korean families. The Korean government is currently plan-
 ning to lower the number of foreign adoptions by 20 per cent
 a year with all foreign adoptions ceasing in 1980. Some agen-
 cies are skeptical that this will happen, however. South
 Korea is sensitive to North Korean criticism that it is
 "selling" its children.
 - Eurasian babies, especially girls. are more in demand in
 Hong Kong, Thailand and the Philippines than children who
 do not have a caucasian parent. On the black market, some
 Thai families have paid $10,000 for one Eurasian. A
 Caucasian-Filipino baby could cost up to $7,000.
 If anyone has a theory why this is so, do let me know.
 The mothers are usually bar girls who receive little if any
 of the money. the babies being sold by their pimps or bar
 owners. In many cases, the mothers must pay back debts in-
 curred while they were in no shape to work.
 Such black market children have no legal rights: they
 could be abandoned if the step-parents die. There is no
 follow-up, no way to insure that the children are not abused.
 - In the past, there have been no legal adoption agencies
 in Asia. Traditionally, the extended family took care of
 orphaned relatives.
 - A legal adoption of an Asian child in the U.S. costs
 upwards from about a thousand dollars including transpor-
 tation. It can take a minimum of 6 months.
 Because we're looking for places that other readers can
 also patronize, we must have names and addresses.
 Marks will go for the most interesting reasons: e.g. there's
 a tiny hotel run by a family in Bali where the old grand-
 mother sits in the lobby, warmly greeting the guests to her
 "home." If she likes you, she might ask her grandchildren to
 lend you their bicycles. She might even send a grandson
 along as a guide - free. You feel she cares .. .
 Another example: theres a blue and white houseboat in
 Kashmir, a favorite because of the mountain setting and the
 exotic world that comes floating out to you - the vendors
 each selling fresh flowers, honey, fresh fruit, candy, hot
 coffee, clothes - a tailor comes too.
 A little paddle boat is at your disposal. cushioned,
 canopied, with curtains drawn at your behest. It has a helpful
 paddleman, taking you from lake to another, stopping if you
 wish. to watch the wood-carvers. And in the evening, the
 owner comes to chat by lantern light and , Ps to sell his
 copperware. Bantering with him is fun.
 Need more time? We're extending the deadline to the last
 day of January. Judges will be a panel appointed by the Asia
 Mail, annonymous because we haven't found volunteers yet.
 It will be up on the tricks of hotel public relations people (I
 hope I.
 Remember. it's 100 words or less, prose or poetry. Asia for
 us (we never did very well in geography) is Afghanistan east
 to Hawaii with Australia thrown in as a bonus.
 The hotels must be accessible to most people. This
 eliminates hotels in the People's Republic of China, North
 Korea. Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea because the average
 tourist cannot visit there.
 It does include Samarkand, Bukhara and Tashkent, places
 in Soviet Asia that are relatively easy to visit.
 First prize is a two-year subscription to the Asia Mail; se-
 cond prize a one-year subscription: third prize - there will
 be six of them - are Asia Mail T-shirts.

 - Some agencies will accept single parents. especially for
 hard-to-place older or handicapped children.

 "Favorite Hotel in Asia and Why" Contest announced last
 month, a hotel is any structure in which a stranger can
 customarily sleep overnight for a fee.
 This eliminates most government bungalows, school dor-

 U.S. Policy in the Mel
 Michael Morrow
 Beyond the flightline, the straight rows of cement block
 buildings, the cyclone fencing and the guardposts, Udorn did
 not wait. A dreary, decadent and often violent town, it had
 grown like a wart on the backside of the war. Now it
 shriveled, and only five journalists had stayed the extra day
 to watch stragglers Lutz and Jones earn their asterisk in the
 history books.
 And so they did at 10:31 on the morning of December 20,
 1975. Pilot Joe Lutz and Radar Operator Rich Jones, neither
 of whom had ever dropped a bomb in anger, eased their ail-
 ing Phantom off the Udorn runway. The mottled green im-
 age disappeared like a blowfly against the dry season sky of
 Northeastern Thailand.
 n February 1859, the fleet of French Admiral Rigault de
 Genouilly seized Saigon: an era began. In April 1975, the
 troops and tanks of NVN General Tran Van Tra re-took the
 city; an era ended. Be seeing you. Lutz: sorry you missed
 out, Jones. It is just no longer necessary, desirable, or even
 very possible to permanently base American combat air-
 planes in mainland Southeast Asia.
 End of story? Not quite. At the 432nd Tactical Fighter
 Wing's Udorn headquarters. a rusting metal arch was left
 behind. Attended by a hedge of red "feung fa," the arch bore
 three words: "And Kill Migs." More than a quarter of a cen-
 tury, but still only a link or two in the chain of command
 divided that left-over slogan from an historic injunction of
 former Secretary of State Dean Acheson.
 On the eve of communist takeover in China in 1949.
 Acheson launched a committee to reassess the United States'
 Asia policy: as he wrote in a memorandum to Philip Jessup.
 he had just one underlying concern:  You will please take it
 as your assumption that it is a fundamental decision of
 American policy that the United States does not intend to
 permit further extension of communist domination on the
 continent of Asia or in the Southeast Asia area ..." And so
 the United States has fought. and paid others to fight. Every
 Secretary of State since then has subscribed to the Acheson
 assumption.
 American intelligence knew that from the Yenan period
 onward, the Chinese communists were receiving little aid
 from the Soviet Union. Acheson, and many other senior
 American diplomats, chose nonetheless to envisage a
 monolithic Communist Block because they saw it assaulting
 the free market world they believed in.
 Given his historical place and time, Acheson at least had
 the excuse of Stalin for his mistake. But the policy that has
 followed from his assumption in Southeast Asia, and par-
 ticularly in the Mekong countries of Cambodia, Laos.
 Thailand and Vietnam. has been, bluntly put. a policy of kill-
 ing communists, or those poeple so aligned or so described.
 It has been a policy of opposing drift toward or rapproche-
 ment with "the Left" as a matter of principle.
 As Professor Hans Morgenthau and others pointed out
 long ago. it has been a stupid policy; it has been a brutish
 policy and it has been a failure. However it is still a policy
 that endures. and now Cyrus Vance. who if not present at the
 beginning then enough so later on, is Secretary of State.
 I)o we have any reason to think that the Acheson assump-
 tion will be put to rest" Not much. I should think, but
 Thailand and the Mekong Basin generally is the place to look
 for an answer. If Mr. Vance, his boss Mr. Carter. and
 whoever else it is who will count in the new administration's
 formulation of foreign policy. intend a new strategy for
 Southeast Asia. they should know that this is the terrain that
 counts. If they intend just another game of dominos. then
 they owe Mr. Kissinger and the Republican presidents he has
 served a debt for doing so little to get American policy out of
 that rut.
 "Fifty-two months and ten days ago. in a moment of
 tragedy and trauma, the duties of this office fell upon me.
 President Lyndon Johnson told the American people wearily
 on March 31, 1968. His address that night not only marked
 the end of his own political career, but also the beginning of
 an end to the Vietnam War. Rhetoric aside. it carried
 promise.
 In that March speech Johnson repeated a pledge he had
 made at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in April
 1965: "that the United States would take part in the great
 work of developing Southeast Asia, including the Mekong
 Valley -- for all the people of that region ... (that) North
 Vietnam could take its place in this common effort just as
 soon as peace comes.'
 Well, peace has come. It has not come on'American terms
 because those terms were historically untenable, but it has
 come nonetheless, and the President's words have more
 relevance to our time than they did to his: "Over time, a
 wider framework of peace and security may become
 possible. The new cooperation of the nations of the area
 could be a foundation stone .. .
 In announcing his Pacific Doctrine in Honolulu in
 December 1975, President Ford allowed that "Peace in Asia
 requires a structure of economic cooperation reflecting the
 aspirations of all the peoples of the region." The only struc-
 ture he mentioned, however, was the Association of
 Southeast Asian Nations. "Americans will be hearing much
 about the ASEAN organization." the President said. "All its
 members are friends of the United States." The Indochina
 countries are not friends of the United States - Vietnam in
 particular. ASEAN so far has all the makings of another anti-
 communist club with the Mekong River as its most critical
 frontier. The notion of Mekong cooperation once suggested
 by President Johnson has become anathema.
 It is indeed ironic that during the period 1957-75 the United
 States gave $45.6 million to the UN-sponsored Committee for
 the Coordination of Investigations of the Lower Mekong
 Basin, the only functional regional body linking Thailand
 with its Indochina neighbors, but cut off funding of the Com-
 mittee shortly after the fighting had stopped in Indochina.
 Despite signals from Laos and Vietnam that they wanted
 the Mekong Committee to continue and expand its activites:
 the $1.3 million American grant for fiscal 1975 was limited by
 an act of Congress to Thailand's use only. and the Bangkok-
 based secretariat was told that even Thai-related aid could
 not be expected in the future. The largely American-
 controlled United Nations Development Program also cut
 the Committee's funding. Only the intervention of UN
 Secretary General Kurt Waldheim. who visited Bangkok
 briefly in February 1976 has assured sufficient budget to hold
 the Committee's secretariat together until mid-1977.
 Such information should not come as much surprise. The
 United States now twice vetoed Vietnam's admission to the
 United Nations since the war's end. and formal American
 diplomacy remains in the hands of men whether they are
 loyal to Mr. Kissinger or Mr. Vance is of little importances
 whose contempt for the Vietnamese is only thinly veiled.
 Which calls back to mind the last few days of 1975. As
 Lieutenants Lutz and Jones were struggling with a fluttery
 rudder at Udorn air base. and as the anniversary of the
 Christmas bombing was fast approaching. four American
 Congressmen journeyed to Hanoi.
 Coming when it did. the visit was itself significant. Prime
 Minister Pham Van 1)ong told the Representatives that
 theirs was -a meeting starting peace and friendship between
 the two countries '' Whether history proves him right or not
 we shall wait and see. The words in any case were accom-
 panied by a gesture. The ashes of three missing American
 flyers (Navy Commander Jesse Taylor. Air Force Captain
 Ronald Perry and Air Force Lieutenant Colonel ('rosley Fit-
 ton) were turned over in a simple ceremony on the tarmac of
 Gia Long airport.
 The Vietnamese took the occasion seriously and handled it
 with a certain magnanimity. even permitting an American
 military officer accompanying the Congressmen to change
 into uniform and to drape American flags over the three
 small wooden boxes which held the ashes. In dignity. the
 men began their journey home.
 Ambassador Charles Whitehouse, a former aide to
 Ellsworth Bunker in Saigon and previous to his Bangkok ap-
 pointment ambassador to Laos. was noticeably missing from
 the honor guard that removed the remains now in metal
 military coffins) from the UN plane that had shuttled the

 Congressional party to and from Hanoi. Only when the cof-
 fins had been placed on a waiting air force C-130 did the Am-
 bassador's long black limousine pull up before the small
 cluster of newsmen and officials. Whitehouse, accompanied
 by a silver poodle, emerged dressed in a dapper beige lounge
 suit. "I hope you don't mind a macabre question" he
 quipped: "how big were the boxes?"
 Ambassador Whitehouse remains at his post, last seen in
 November turning over four American helicopters to
 Thailand's Border Patrol Police. Since the October 6 coup in
 Bangkok. Thailand's future is now the macabre question.
 Out to avenge an alleged (and it would appear fabricated) in-
 sult of Thailand's Crown Prince, Royalists, spearheaded by
 units of the CIA-inspired BPP, burned alive, beat to death,
 sexually assaulted and hung leftist men and women students
 from Bangkok's prestigious Thammasat University. As one
 writer put it. the event marked the beginning of "Southeast
 Asia's equivalent to the Civil War in Spain."
 Despite the denials, it is difficult to believe that the U.S.
 government did not at the very least have an oblique role in
 the October 6 coup, and in the carefully orchestrated brown-
 shirt violence leading up to it during the previous two years.
 In any case Washington finds Bangkok's new radical rightists
 more to its liking than its old bourgeois democrats. and it
 was almost obscene how quickly news was leaked that
 Americans in civilian clothes had been based at reactivated
 Takhli air base to support military aircraft dropping in to and
 from the Indian Ocean base on Diego Garcia.
 In Thai history October 6 will likely prove the headwaters
 of a river of no return. It has driven many of Thailand's finest
 intellectuals into the mountains, or across the Mekong into
 Laotian exile, and it has locked Thailand's socialists into a
 life or death struggle with Thai monarchists. The "residual
 presence" of the American military in Thailand, about which
 former Defense Secretary Schlesinger was so concerned, has
 been secured for the time-being, and foreign businessmen
 may even be able to count on five years of relative stability.
 But the line has never been drawn like this before, and the
 ramifications of civil war could well spread far beyond
 Thailand's borders.
 A civil war in Thailand must now be taken as inevitable. If
 the Acheson assumption holds, then the United States will
 likely be drawn in on the side of the monarchists, and
 American influence will go to hardening ASEAN into an anti-
 communist block. In that event, Indochina countries, Viet-
 nam in particular, will not only be excluded from region-
 wide plans for economic cooperation, but forced to contend
 with a gameplan the ultimate result of which would likely be
 the ongoing bifurcation of their own Mekong Basin com-
 munity. The domino theory can still be made a self-fulfilling
 prophecy.
 The emerging political and economic potential of the
 Mekong countries has already established that they
 themselves can fill much of the "vacuum" left by the retreat
 of American hegemony on the end of the Second Indochina
 War. The crucial question - and one over which the United
 States as the most active outside power still holds influence
 - has become "how." not "whether" these countries will
 conduct their own relations, and particularly how Bangkok
 and Hanoi. epicenters of power in the Mekong Basin. can ac-
 commodate one another.
 The notion of such an accommodation is not so novel as
 might first appear. Although it is now all but forgotten
 history. Ho Chi Minh once lived in a small Thai town not far
 from the Mekong River. and he once received small arms
 from the Thai government to fight the French. In 1947, then
 Thai Prime Minister Pridi Phanomyong, leader of the Thai
 resistance during World War II and like Ho Chi Minh a
 recipient of American aid during that period, journeyed to
 France in an unsuccessful attempt to mediate Indochina's in-
 dependence. Having failed, in September 1947 he invited the
 Indochina revolutionaries into a formal association called the
 Southeast Asian League: somewhat ironically the first
 attempt at a regional community.
 The winds of the Cold War had already begun to blow, and
 Pridi was soon forced into exile by a coup d'etat that
 restored to power pro-fascist collaborators of Japan's World
 War II occupation. For a brief period, however, the Viet-
 namese and Lao independence movements had actually
 operated from a wooden house on Bangkok's main street.
 Silom Road. "I hoped that when these people had regained
 their independence we could work closely with them," Pridi.
 who is still in exile, told an interviewer in Paris two years
 ago.
 Pridi not only helped lead the 1932 putsch that ended ab-
 solute monarchy in Thailand, but was Thammasat Univer-
 sity's first rector, helping to explain the leading role the

 THE
 Polynesia's Sacred Isle
 By Edward Dodd
 Dodd. Mead & Company. 1976, 224 pps.. $10.00
 Donna Gays
 Edward Dodd's third book in "The Ring of
 Fire" series on the culture of Polynesia is a
 personal narrative in which he attempts to
 lure the romanticist, not the historian or
 anthropologist. There are few statistics.
 judgements or evaluations in "Polynesia's
 Sacred Isle."
 As part of the Society Island group, Raiatea
 is an insignificant island only 20 miles long and
 some 10 to 12 miles wide, lying some 3000
 miles from the nearest continent. It is a
 hundred miles northeast of the more
 popularly-known Tahiti. The name "Raiatea"
 in the old Polynesian language can best be
 translated to mean "expansive sky."
 Dodd first came upon the island in the late
 1920's with a group of fellow Yale graduates
 who were attempting to sail around the world.
 Although none of them completed the trip,
 Dodd was so enamored of Raiatea that he
 returned in the late 1950's with his wife. It was
 then they met Turo who was to become like a
 son. Eventually, the two families shared a
 home.
 At Fetuna, on the southern end of the
 island. the Dodds built their dream house to
 which they have returned nearly every other
 year for two to four months at a time for the
 past dozen years. Turo. his wife, and his ever-
 growing family occupy the house the
 remainder of the time.
 Raiatea,  according  to Dodd,  is the
 birthplace of the Polynesian culture. It has
 been written elsewhere that. while Raiatea
 was the spiritual center. Tahiti has been the
 cultural center. It was, however, to Raiatea
 that the settlers came from Samoa before
 settling on the other islands.
 Dodd attempts to explain Raiatea's
 significance through chants and recitations
 that remain from the past.
 He explores the geological and botanical
 history of the island and writes of the ''tiare
 apatahi," a rare flower flourishing some 2,000
 feet high atop the sacred mountain of
 Temehani. This beautiful flower is a botanical
 wonder that refuses to thrive elsewhere in the
 world.
 Dodd speculates on how the trees, fruits and
 flowers came to be a part of the legends.
 superstitions. customs, religion and history of
 the island.
 We learn that Raiatea is the central-Pacific
 birthplace of the still-practiced art of fire-
 walking.
 It is the origin of the breadfruit. We learn
 also that the Raiateans are master-builders of
 the canoe. particularly the great double-
 canoes which took the islanders to Hawaii, the
 Cooks and New Zealand.
 Dodd writes at length of the Ariori Society
 who would be regarded by most cultures as
 obscene, evil entertainers in a tightly organiz-
 ed society free of sexual morals. A greatly
 respected, or perhaps feared group. they were
 capable of spreading the gospel of Oro, an an-
 cient diety, in a highly effective manner. It is
 perhaps because of this that the people
 accepted Christianity so readily from the mis-
 sionaries who arrived in the 1800's.

 It is this situation which the band of economists faced in
 1972 which called forth their greatest efforts. The relevance
 of Dr. Dhar's 1966 paper was that the analysis of the problem
 which he had given them still applied in 1973. Dr. VKRV Rao
 and his colleagues updated Dr. Dhar's analysis and prepared
 the case for presentation to the Prime Minister.
 According to men who sat through that first meeting with
 the Prime Minister in September 1973, the Prime Minister
 remained relatively quiet but receptive to the arguments and
 proposals which the small band made. In the discussion I)har
 and Rao lead the Prime Minister through the intricacies of
 what was proposed.
 After hearing the economists out she proposed that the
 men make their proposal to the cabinet. This was arranged
 by' her in October 1973. Prior to the meeting the working
 paper had been circulated to key members of the cabinet - a
 group that would later be lablelled as the "Economic Com-
 mittee. "
 In addition to the economists, the cabinet ministers who
 attended this meeting were Y. B. Chavan-External Affairs,
 C. Subramanian-Finance, T. A. Pai-Industry, and D. P. Dhar-
 Planning. and J. Ram-Agriculture.
 The meeting was a heated one but the six economists won
 the argument by simply pointing to the chaos that existed in
 the economy. They pointed out that the drought occured
 because the irrigation was not in place. They noted that there
 was no coordination between the central bank and the
 finance ministry so that money was being created far faster
 than increases in production. They noted that private
 business had not expanded its investment and that the public
 sector was running at an unexplainable deficit.
 Although it was not included in the working papers the
 economists were critical of the fact that. as far as economic
 policy was concerned. the cabinet did not coordinate its
 policies. Each ministry did as it chose without any attempt to
 find out how their policy either meshed with the economic
 plan or how their actions affected other ministries.
 Although the cabinet was far from happy with the criticism
 it received and by no means convinced that the program be-
 ing offered would work, the cabinet, at the Prime Minister's
 prompting. agreed to extend discussion of the working
 paper. However, there was one key result of this meeting.
 Shortly after the meeting the Prime Minister told all
 ministers that no decision on economic matters could be
 taken without first being cleared by the inner cabinet com-
 mittee comprised of the above minishers.
 According to V. Ramachandran. P N. Dhar's assistant, this
 decision to enforce economic disipline on the cabinet marked
 the first time in history that the cabinet had to clear every
 decision to see if it conformed to the five year plan.
 "This decision." he said. "created the institutional
 mechanism to assure coordination at the top. In the past
 every cabinet member created policies based on his desires.
 As a result. Indian planning, which had always been praised
 for its foresight. was frustrated by poor policy implemen-
 tation. Now all policies must conform to the plan."
 Over the next few months. Ramachandran continued.
 there were repeated cabinet meetings. "We met two or three
 times a week. There were constant disputes between the
 cabinet and the economists. Had it not been for P.N. Dhar
 and the Prime Minister, the working paper would have been
 shelved. "
 And C.H. Hanumantha Rao recalled. "Separate meetings
 had to be held with each minister and his staff. We tried to
 convince the ministries either to retract old programs or to
 implement new ones. This went on until the spring of 1974."
 As a result, each ministry was told to draft its own
 fanuary' 1977      The Asia Mail
 proposals, which were reviewed by the cabinet's inner
 economic committee. and either approved or sent back for
 revision.
 As the months passed a new group emerged in the second
 echelon of the cabinet. and these men eventually played
 pivotal roles in the development of a new economic policy.
 Some of the key figures were: Man Mohan Singh of Finance:
 S. Chakravorty of Planning: P.N. Haksar of Planning and B.
 Javlin of Industries.
 Two early symptoms of India's new economic mood were
 apparent in May 1974. The first was that India had
 successfully concluded negotiations with the World Bank for
 a $1.5 billion loan. That the Bank had set conditions on the
 loan was known at the time. Later it was learned that the
 Bank had accepted the six economists's working paper as a
 basis for granting credit.
 The second symptom was the government's strong action
 in crushing the national railroad strike in May 1974. by first
 securing railroad property and then sending in troops.
 And finally the government's policy was made explicit in
 July 1974, exactly a year before the emergency, when Mrs.
 Gandhi spoke at the opening ceremonies of the Institute for
 Economic and Social Change at Bangalore. This Institute had
 been founded by Dr. V.K.R.V. Rao. And the Prime
 Minister's speech is recognized as the turning point in the
 nation's economic policy. The program which she then enun-
 ciated. had the full support of her cabinet and was the result
 of nearly a year's work. Mrs. Gandhi's three major points
 were that:
 -Cost of living allowances to labor were to be impounded
 in order to check the nation's inflationary spiral:
 -One-third of dividends were to be impounded as well. to
 control corporate spending until the economy cooled off:
 -Taxes on windfall gains were to be increased.
 One point that Mrs. Gandhi failed to mention, but which
 was vital to the new policy, was that there would exist a new
 coordination between the Finance Ministry and Reserve
 Bank of India: and that henceforth. government spending
 and money creation were to be limited, taking into con
 sideration actual productivity.
 Coming as it did just six weeks after the government crush-
 ed the railroad strike, the Prime Minister's speech had an
 almost immediate effect. as the Finance Ministry took action
 to see that the new policies were implemented. The result
 was that over the following 11 months wholesale prices fell
 by nearly 13 per cent. as the quantity of money in circulation
 was controlled.
 During this same period leading up the declaration of an
 emergency the government took other actions to stimulate
 the economy, such as liberalization of imports. regularization
 of license capacity. and delicensing of some industries. In ad-
 dition, more funds were allocated for irrigation projects. and
 incentives were increased to encourage exports and farm
 procurement programs.
 These policies were implemented one at a time, and were
 never announced as being part of the government's new
 overall economic schema. Indeed, few noted the changes
 because this period was one of further deterioration on the
 political front.
 Near anarchy reigned throughout India. A combination of
 Gandhists, right-wing Hindu nationalists and communists
 threatened to topple the government. In February 1975 D.P.
 Mishra, the Minister for Railways. was assasinated. In April
 1975 the opposition forces joined to form a loose coalition.
 The State Government of Gujerat was overthrown. Eighteen
 million man hours were lost to strikers. Mrs. Gandhi was
 'lied in a lower court and convicted of a minor campaign
 violation. And it looked as though the gain made against in-
 flation under the new economic program would be lost as a
 result of the political upheaval.
 It was against this background that Mrs. Gandhi declared a
 state of emergency.
 This declaration. backed by the arrest of opposition
 leaders and muzzling of the nation's media. crippled the
 divisive forces. Stability soon returned to the political and
 economic fronts. and over the next year the economy took a
 major turn upward.
 The nation's GNP grew by 10.6 per cent. Agricultural out-
 put. aided by a good monsoon, grew by 18 per cent. Exports
 grew by 10 per cent during a period when world trade,
 overall. decreased by 6 per cent. And the public sector, under
 Mrs. Gandhi's dictate that it become more productive, grew
 by 16 per cent and turned in a handsome profit for the first
 time.
 These results were attributed to the government's new
 economic program.
 To understand what has occurred since the government
 began its new economic schema it is worth recapping the ma-
 jor policy changes over the past two years:
 Effective control of the money supply was implemented.
 -Rlost industries were delicensed.
 --Public enterprises were directed to become more ef-
 ficient, to increase capacity utilization and to increase
 profits.
 --Export incentives were increased.
 -Imports were liberalized.
 -A first priority effort was made to increase irrigation
 projects.
 -Taxes were lowered on income and assets, including for
 corporations.
 --Outlays for the private sector were increased by 68 per
 cent in the final Fifth Plan document issued in 1976.
 -Tax incentives for research and development were in-
 creased.
 -Foreign capital inflows were encouraged.
 -Expenditures in power generation were doubled for in-
 dustrial and farm use.
 -Twenty million tons of grain stocks were accumulated as
 a hedge against drought.
 -The government began to actively solicit foreign loans
 and grants.
 -Efficiency was increased in posts, telegraphs and other
 communications facilites.
 Nearly all of the above was taken into account in the first
 point of Mrs. Gandhi's twenty point program which she
 issued at the time the emergency was declared:
 "The streamlining of production, procurement and dis-
 tribution of essential commodities, strict economy in govern-
 ment and the continuance of steps to increase productivity."
 As one of the economists responsible for India's economic
 turn-around put it. "That one paragraph in the 20 point
 program is our paragraph. It summarizes our program."
 The working paper provided to the government by the six
 economists was designed initially only to control the in-
 flationary situation which had arisen during 1972-3. As the
 working paper said at the outset,
 "We would like to make it clear at the outset that we are
 dealing with the short period problem of inflation and unrest
 that has overtaken the country today and threatens to bring
 to a halt the attempt that is being made to combine economic
 growth with social justice ..."
 Whatever the economists' design the program they in-
 itiated in 1974 has more than short run implications. The
 very concept of combining economic growth with social
 justice implies that the economic plans of the future must
 emphasize growth first, followed by social justice. unless the

 sector reflects the belief of the six economists that the public
 sector had been operating well below capacity and was not in
 need of increased outlays until current capacity was utilized
 efficiently. Thus the decision to restrict outlays in this sector
 is part of the long run policy to make the public sector pay its
 own way.
 The third change in the plan is the continued reduction in
 regulation and control in industry. As one economist in the
 planning commission put it.  This group of policies helps
 both the private and the public enterprises because it
 reduces red tape and decentralizes decision making."
 Finally, the acknowledgement in the final fifth plan that
 overseas loans would be acceptable carries with it the
 recognition that savings in India are not adequate yet. This is
 a realistic conclusion that eliminates the need for further
 rhetoric about economic autarchy.
 The planners are aware that they will have to increase ex-
 ports to pay off foreign loans and also have to increase
 capital inflows in the form of new investment. As one critic
 put it. 'When you accept foreign loans you have to accept
 foreign capiial.'
 All four changes in emphasis in the newltiv completed plan
 give strength to the thesis that the working paper of the six
 economists has had a permanent effect on the planning
 process and that the new plan is following the Tobin Mlason
 Model as used in Korea. Taiwan, the Philippines and Brazil.
 While the model has been chanced to meet Indian stan-
 dards, there is little question that the economists responsible
 for the change arc aware of the influence of the model on
 their thinking. Moreover. they point out. that their model in-

 Dhar. a Kashmiri. smiled at this point and said. ''But it will
 bring the kind of results that it has brought elsewhere."
 Too modest to predict the economic miracle these policies
 have brought in other countries. Dhar prefers to say that
 ''development comes in pauses and lurches.- Yet many of
 his colleagues are sure that the new policies will result in
 growth rates of at least 6' ~ a near from now to the end of the
 century. Yoginder Alagh, who is responsible for long term
 prospective planning, said, 'India is on its way." And his
 boss Dr. Shankar Ghose. the financial wizard who straighten-
 ed out the finances of West Bengal and is now planning
 minister. said. 'Y'ou can say that the Indian economy has
 reached its takeoff at last.''
 With the change in policy initiated by the six economists
 and the concretization of their ideas in policy and in the new
 five year plan, it has become possible to look at projections
 of India's future with the confidence that the policies are
 suited to growth and to balance the needs of social justice
 with the requirements of growth.
 It is interesting to note that both the planning commission
 and an independent study commissioned by the Ford Foun-
 dation agree on future projections. Both groups of
 futurologists are looking for growth rates of nearly 5.6 '1 to
 7" per annum between now and the year 2001. At these rates
 the per capita income of Indians would treble by the end of
 the century and the GNP will increase to nearly 270 billion
 dollars in the same period. This will give India, by the end of
 the century, the same GNP as Japan's in 1970.
 F. A. Mehta of the Ford Foundation. who published an
 overall view of the Indian economy this year in the Ford
 Foundation's "Second India Series". believes that the above
 rate of growth is eminently reasonable for the Indian
 economy and that even if the population of India grows from
 its current level of 600 million to one billion by the end of the
 century per capita income will more than triple.
 The essential underpinning of the growth projections of
 both the Ford Foundation and the government planners is
 the agricultural projection. as agriculture accounts for over
 half of the total GNP.
 It is remarkable, therefore. that both forecasts have
 chosen a 4" rate of agricultural growth as achievable.
 On the industrial side. again both groups are forecasting in-
 dustrial growth at the rate of between 7 and 9'( between now
 and the end of the century.

 to expand. we will certainly be able to increase production by

 the century."
 Hr. V.M Rao in his book in the Ford Foundation Series
 also posts a 4   rate as attainable. but cautions that the
 record of the Indian government in carrying out programs in
 the agricultural sector is anything but encouraging.
 Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that the long run itn-
 plic'ations of irrigation will only be achieved through periods
 of trial and error. '.Host economists now warn that the

 For foreign investors, there is It new set of instructions

 to those issued in the past, there is a change in tone in the
 new booklet. As more than one official in the government
 says. "We are open to projects that bring in new technology
 more jobs, and create exports."
 In part, the new atmosphere is due to an awakening in In-
 dia than foreign savings can hest be attracted to India if new
 capital comes in the form of investment. This is particularly
 true since the government seems more willing than ever to
 try the IMF rules, which it has not done in the past.  The
 government has seen other countries like Brazil and Iran
 succeed within the western rules and now we want to he one
 of the success countries."
 It is when this whole mood is appreciated that one can see
 closely the reality of the high projections of the futurologists.
 It has to be stressed that India today is following a model

 is simply no reason to believe that it will not be successful in

 Yankee Teacher
 In Meiji Japan
 An American Teacher in Early Meiji Japan
 By Edward It. Beauchamp
 The University Press of Hawaii
 1976, 154 pps, $4.75 paper.
 This is the 17th publication in a series. Asian Studies at
 Hawaii. published by The University Press of Hawaii, and
 gratifying evidence it is of the growing effectiveness of the
 East-West Center concept, an early Lyndon B. Johnson
 promotion dating back to his days as Senate Majority Leader
 .
 in the 1950s
 In this doctoral thesis, now-Professor Beauchamp provides
 it somewhat misty picture of William Elliot Griffis' brief but
 important turn as one of the yatoi )employed foreigners) who
 helped Japan emerge from its long isolation in the Meiji
 Restoration period Griffis had the unusual opportunity of
 working as a teacher both in the remote feudal setting of
 Fukui and in Tokyo, then a brand new national capital in its
 early development phase. from 1870 to 1874. Meiji had conic
 to the throne only two years before Griffis' arrival.
 Griffis performed scientific experiments in the Emperor
 Meiji's presence and worked with the Meiji statesmen who
 helped transform Japan from Feudalism into a modern
 state.
 Beauchamp's picture is somewhat misty because the
 materials from which he worked were limited, principally
 letters from Griffis to his family in Philadelphia. Beauchamp
 draws sparingly front Griffis' many publications, including
 his most important work. "The Mikado's Empire." con-
 sidered to have been the most widely read work on Japan in
 this country up to World War lt. Beauchamp provides, non-
 etheless, an interesting introduction to the formidable tasks
 the Japanese undertook in bringing their isolated culture
 into full contact with the outside world. The Japanese
 reserve in accepting American missionaries is a case in point.
 Some of the early American missionaries' activities in the
 Orient can make some of today's Americans wince, but Grif-
 fis' role was apparently less disturbing. For instance he
 cautioned Japanese Christians in Tokyo and Yokohama
 against embracing the peculiarities of one particular sect of
 Christianity. no matter how hard some of the more zealous
 missionaries pushed. When Christ's apostles spread His
 word, Griffis wrote in a letter to Japans a Christians, the
 Christian religion "was greatly influence  by the peculiar
 kinds of mind in the various nations. Ilene Christianity was
 variously modified, just as the same seed  Ill be modified by
 various soils and climates." Europe ins' versions of
 Christianity became diverse just as their languages became

 1878).
 diverse. Griffis wrote, and since the Japanese were a
 homogeneous people. there was no need of introducing the
 various sectarian dimensions of Christianity.
 Griffis worked hard to elevate the position of women in
 ,Japan, but with only modest success. There was still a good
 deal to be done when Ethel Weed and her small hand of
 Japanese women went to work on the some problem in
 MacArthur's occupation.
 It is interesting that Beauchamp finds Griffis going along,
 to the extent that he does, with the traditional Japanese
 myth that the imperial family descended from the heavens,
 thus laying the basis for the divinity of the emperor. Griffis
 could not accept all this as true history, but lie did find a cer-
 tain element of truth in the details of tine stories. Griffis con-
 cluded that the historical accounts of various ancient rulers'
 exploits. "though exaggerated in mirage and fable, are in the
 main. most probably historic." He found many disbelieving
 ,Japanese, of course, among them one student explaining
 simply that "it is my duty to believe In them" (the myths.)
 Griffis wrote in 1915 of the dangers that the institution of
 the emperor might be captured someday by ambitious men
 for their own manipulations, to the detriment of the
 .Japanese people as a whole. That, of course, happened 20
 years later, to the present occupant ^flhe throne, who non-
 etheless survived to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his
 reign - stripped. however, of his forefathers' claim to

 Under these pressures, there will be a need, for a national
 Asian American networking system for information
 retrieval, for lobbying, for keeping different community
 groups informed as to what is happening where. Also need
 for National level organizations that Asians and communities
 can turn to for counsel and coordination of efforts will
 become more critical. For example, the National JACL has
 encouraged the sponsoring of Vietnamese refugees by in-
 dividual chapters. But leaving it at this is too parallel to the
 government's effort to find sponsors for Vietnamese
 refugees and stopping there. The proposed self-help
 resources centers elevates the JACL effort beyond such
 limitations. Sponsoring chapters will be needing advice, if
 not help in the form of technical assistance, information.
 workshops or field consulting. As refuge families go through
 various stages of adjustment and integration into community
 life, problems and needs will change. Rather than leave the
 solution to each chapter and draining unnecessary energy in
 duplicated trials and errors, a pooling of skills in resolving
 these issues with a field staff will not only provide an ef-
 ficient use of resources but can contribute also to morale in
 unifying all these support communities together.
 One of the better avenues for recognizing the needs of the .
 Asian American community from a national level is the crea-
 tion of offices or projects such as the Office of Asian
 American Affairs, the National Project on Asian and Pacific
 Island Americans of the US Commission on Civil Rights, the
 Pacific Asian Coalition, the Asian Studies Programs, not to
 speak of other possibilities such as a federation of Asian
 Women or a council of Asian American Churches. For the first
 time, and when the need becomes most apparent, there is
 the makings of a nation wide network of similarly concerned
 efforts that can respond to Asian American communities in
 their efforts to broaden access, stay in touch with other
 groups, enable resource sharing and working in concert on
 problems of mutual concern.
 The need to implement such a network linking Asian
 American communities and groups for the purposes men-
 tioned takes on a sense of urgency. This is influenced by the
 politics of the Indochinese refugee situation and the com-
 plexity of circumstance surrounding the Asian experience in
 America. On the one hand here is the need to focus attention
 on the maldistribution of services and the limits to which the
 resources of the ethnic community can be taxed to resolve
 problems arising among its own people without the
 assistance of government funding. At the same time, there is
 the delicate balance of organizing communities to become
 more effective political entities without unduly arousing the
 hositility of a public suspectible to the mention of visible
 scapegoats, especially at a time of economic depression and
 continued system breakdown. Asians have been cast in this
 role all too often in the past.
 There is also the problem of enlightening administrators
 who hunger for examples of success and find it both political-
 ly and intellectually convenient to continue to assume that
 Asian Americans do not have problems and are not about to
 veer from this myth unless confronted by facts or pressure or
 both. Among the offices that do respond. as in the case of the
 Task Force on Refugees, the response can be limited or even
 counterproductive if based on experiences with Europeans
 and insensitive to the needs of people from the Eastern
 Hemisphere.
 All this adds up to the continued need for Asian American
 communities to develop parallel institutions while also
 widening avenues for greater input into exsisting institutions.
 This means encouraging and supporting organizing at the
 local level within specific Asian groups while also pushing
 ahead nationally on a Pan-Asian basis. In such context. a
 networking system takes on central relavance.
 What then about the specific role of Asian American
 communities to new immigrants? On the one hand there is
 apathy or indifference if not some hostility. According to
 those working on services to new immigrants, some of this
 inaction can be attributed to the struggles and battles waged
 in the past without assistance in a Laissez Faire, competitive
 market system. Then there's the belief that newcomers are
 no different in their needs or privileges from what the earlier
 pioneers experienced and' hence should have to work out
 problems themselves. On the other hand, there are those
 who see in a common Asian identity, a kinship predicated by
 mutual need for survival - that is if one is in need. then all
 are needed. For those Asian Americans who see the realities
 of a society where it is just as common, if not easier, for in-
 dividual Asians to be judged categorically rather than on in-
 dividual merit, there is good cause to rally to assist other
 Asians in need.
 Certainly America is a long way from the open society it
 would like to claim to be with well informed citizens judging
 everyone on individual merit. Despite the response of
 military base personnel and their families towards the In-
 dochinese refugees, the latent pools of animosity in many
 veterans who fought against Asians over the past 40 years
 does not make matters any easier. Examples of the latter are
 cases of discrimination both overt and covert involving Asian
 Americans working with former officers now in ad-
 ministrative positions.
 If anything, the influx of immigrants means a rekindling
 and renewal of each Asian American's identity. Though peo-
 ple may be more scattered and assimilated into different
 communities, the bond of Asian ethnicity rests more on
 social nearness than it does on common residence. The fact
 that Asians are a recognizable minority makes indifference
 and escape from the issues that much more difficult and un-
 realistic. Given this reality, what are the roles for Asian and
 Pacific Island American communities?
 For one thing, Asian Americans provide a very vital
 linkage between the ethnic and dominant community. Many
 service agencies, staffed by Asian Americans. are as much in-
 formation clearing houses and conduits matching resources
 to needs, as brokers and go betweens that prevent the im-
 migrant from being completely isolated from the society he
 came to be part of.
 Secondly there is the matter of meshing the needs of the
 settled Asian Americans with the needs on the new Due to
 the visibility and numbers of the latter, and the apparent
 visibility of their problems, aid that comes to the Asian
 American community tends to favor the immigrants as
 witness language skills centers. manpower services. and im-
 migrant services. In contrast, unbelieving authorities work-
 ing on the assumption that there are no problems among
 Asian American born here. are slow to respond. Working in
 concert can expedite matters.
 Then there is the matter of Pacific rim policies that affect
 old and new Asian and Pacific Island Americans alike. Tied
 into this is the reality of understanding ones cultural
 heritage as a basis of understanding more clearly ones iden-
 tity in the face of larger issues such as the foreign policy of
 the United States. Just as the youth in the minority com-
 munity must look beyond elders in the community for the
 source of his restraints, so the Asian American must see how
 his life and affairs of his community are affected by larger
 global issues.
 Tied to understanding ethnic and cultural heritage is the
 stuff of survival. Chances for social improvement are
 greater, as Kramer has discussed in her book about minority
 community. when there is a strong family at the core along
 with a strong cultural heritage. Culture need not instruct one
 in how to survive but does offer reasons for survial. To sur-
 vive, the why proceeds the how. When one wants to five. one
 finds a way.
 Lastly the Asian and Pacific Island American can add to
 the vitality of the minority community, making more clear
 its function as a way station than a trap. All people in a
 mobile society are like ships at sea. Some carry cargo of
 different types and some get battered in storms. We all need
 places to dock. to rest and to repair, a place to check in.
 Refugees, immigrants, marginal people and the socially
 mobile all have needs for safe ports in safe territories. The
 minority community can be such a vital way station,
 providing critical resources and psychic support, being nur-
 turing and supportive without suffocating or limiting
 members in the guise of the security that it provides.

 The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts
 By Maxine Hong Kingston

 Arielle Emmett
 Maxine Hong Kingston, a Chinese-American who has never
 seen her homeland. attempts an exorcism in her first work.
 "The Woman Warrior." She is determined to rid herself of
 the demons that riddle her Chinese and American past, to
 sort out the dreams and nightmares of her life in a
 Chinatown laundry, and to ask. once and for all. "what is
 Chinese tradition. and what is the movies
 T: ese are by no means modest goals. Kingston plows into
 uiem headlong. wielding her pen in anl act of frenetic confes-
 sion like the sword of the legendary woman warrior. Fa Mu-
 lan, whom she longs to emulate. But redress of grievances -
 and there are many. indeed - is simply not enough.
 Kingston is writing a memoir, and in doing so she fails to give
 the reader a coherent framework upon which to fully under-
 stand the complexities of her life.
 The problem is clearly one of style. not substance. The
 author begins her story, in fact. with a brilliant idea   her
 mother's account of a forbidden chapter in the family's past.
 the history of a disgraced aunt.
 "You must not tell anyone ... what I am about to tell you.
 In China your father had a sister who killed herself. She
 jumped into the family well. We say that your father has all
 brothers because it is as if she had never been born."
 Kingston's aunt commits suicide because she bears the
 child of an anonymous man, not her husband's, incurring the
 wrath of the starving, ghost-mongering villagers who curse
 and ransack the family house even prior to the baby's birth.
 The aunt is thereafter stripped of her name and identity
 forced to roam the underworld "always hungry." begging
 food from other ghosts because her own family refuses to
 feed - and recognize --- her. Kingston somehow identifies
 with this "No Name kk oman." who is at once a rebel, a vic-
 tim, and an outcast. and in writing the memoir she seeks. in
 a way. to properly avenge the woman's death
 Her tool of vengeance however, is a fantasy. Kingston at
 an early age is infected by her mother's incessant "talk-
 stories'. about the fabulous dynasty-wrecker. Mu Lan. a
 swordswoman trained by the immortals for 15 years in the
 tactics and mind-tricks of monkeys. tigers. and dragons. This
 warrior woman. the author adds. is the only female with
 enough power to supplant her own father in battle. and "get
 even" with anyone who means her family harm.
 Significantly. Kingston envisions herself as this woman
 warrior. bearing the names and grievances of her on family
 carved in blood upon her back.
 The grievances are too numerous to be counted.
 Kingston's family in China, she reports. is gradually and
 pathetically whittled away by the Communists. Ifer mother,
 Brave Orchid. a "scientific'' and headstrong woman trained
 in Canton in medicine. midwifery. and exorcism. is forced to
 give up her lucrative and honored practice and revert again
 to a "slave-wife" in the family's Chinese laundries in New
 York and California: both of which are lost. Her father grows
 thin and loses hope of returning to his homeland: yet another
 aunt, Moon Orchid, goes read after being rejected face-to-
 face by an affluent. Americanized husband who left her in
 China thirty years earlier. Maxine herself, a sullen, resentful
 child, flunks kindergarten and paints all her pictures in black
 for the first three years of school. Fueled by her mother's
 fears. she grows up hiding from all the barbarian "ghosts"
 around her - "Grocery Ghosts," "Social Worker Ghosts."
 the "Noisy. Red-Mouthed Ghosts ' who taunt the family in
 their laundry. She is tormented by memories of her grand-
 father equating girls with "maggots": of her mother force-
 feeding the family with "blood puddings awobble" and
 bowls of monkey brains and skunk. And her childhood
 answer to being tortured is to torture others - which she
 does, very effectively, in the school lavatory after hours.
 We can't argue with Kingston's vision, however dark. The
 weakness of the memoir is not its truth. but the way in which
 she records it. Taken individually. many episodes are indeed
 powerfully and succinctly written. Kingston particularly ex-
 cels at catching the nuances of an intimate moment: "I
 helped my parents carry their tools. and they walked ahead

 DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS ON JAPAN AND KOREA,

 CHINA'S SCIENTIFIC POLICIES
 Implications for International Cooperation; by Charles P.
 Ridley; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy
 Research, 1150 17th St., NW, Washington, DC 20036, and
 Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, Stan-
 ford University, Stanford, CA, 1976, 92 pps.. $3 paper. The
 prospects for future exchange of scientific information
 between the U.S. and the P.R.C. will offer little for the
 American scientist involved in new research in his field,
 according to this new AEI-Hoover policy study. Internal
 political factors and power struggles within China have
 resulted in the disruption and shifts away from work in
 basic medical research, biochemisty and organic
 chemistry. The Chinese, however, are interested in
 cooperation tied to utilitarian and applied research in
 agriculture and medicine which have a direct effect on
 national development.
 THE MAKING OF A PEASANT DOCTOR
 By Yang Hsiao: Foreign Language Press, distributed in
 the U.S. by China Book & Periodicals, 2929 24th St., San
 Francisco. CA 94110;  1976,  199 pps.. $1.50 paper.
 "Barefoot doctors," a product of the Cultural Revolution,
 work the fields as well as prevent and cure illnesses for
 China's peasants. Hung-yu, as one of those educated by
 Mao Tse-tung Thought is determined to serve his fellow
 villagers while fighting the class enemy in this short pic-
 turesque novel.
 SUN YAT-SEN
 Frustrated Patriot: by C. Martin Wilbur: Columbia
 University Press. 562 West 113th St., New York. NY
 10025; 1976, 413 pps., $16.50. Dr. Sun's 30-year fund-
 raising efforts among overseas Chinese and foreign in-
 vestors and his unsuccessful attempts to acquire support
 from the major foreign powers are the central topics of
 this new book describing the former Chinese leader's
 frustrated political life. Strongly devoted to the political
 reform of his country. he drafted imaginative plans for
 China's economic development. Impossible to achieve in
 his own day, they were to become interwoven into plans
 for international cooperation for the aid of un-
 derdeveloped nations.
 YENCHING  UNIVERSITY  AND  SINO-WESTERN
 RELATIONS, 1916-1952
 By Philip West; Harvard University Press, Cambridge.
 MA 1976, 330 pps., $16. Founded by Western missionaries
 in 1916, Yenching University was an impressive example
 of Western-Sino cooperation. The ties between
 Easterners and Westerners at Yenching in the early half
 of this century were both educational and religious. It was
 a rising national consciousness, student radicalization
 and, ultimately, war that stamped out that religious bond
 by the late 1940s.
 RUSSIAN STUDIES OF CHINA
 Progress and Problems of Soviet Sinology: by E. Stuart
 Kirby; Rowman and Littlefield, 81 Adams Dr., Totawa.
 NJ. 07512: 1976, 209 pps., $20 Soviet concerns in all fields
 of China studies, including hisotrical, cultural, polticial
 and economic, are surveyed. While the book is not all-
 comprehensive, it does provide the reader with an in-
 troduction to the formalized studies which have been on-
 going for nearly three centuries. Mr. Kirby focuses on
 present-day ideology and information.
 WOMEN IN THE WORLD
 A Comparative Study. Lynne B. Iglitzin and Ruth Ross.
 editors: Clio Books, 1976, 429 pps. The emancipation of
 Chinese women, changes in China's marriage law, and the
 effect of industrialization on Hong Kong's women are just
 three areas covered in this collection of essays expressing
 women's views and rights. The book, which recognizes
 that women are developing their own strengths and con-
 sciousness of the need for change, was an outgrowth of a
 January 1977      The Asia Mail
 1974 symposium, "Social and Political Change: The Role
 of Women." sponsored by the Center for the Study of
 Democratic Institutions and the University of California.
 THE LONG AND SHORT OF CHINESE COOKING
 James Rollband, Crossing Press, Trumansburg. NY
 14886. 1976, 223 pps., $9.95 hardcover, $5.95 paper. A com-
 plete and comprehensive guide for the novice cook in-
 cludes information on methods, equipment, ingredients,

 ASIA'S NEW GIANT
 How the Japanese Economy Works; edited by Hugh
 Patrick and Henry Rosovsky; The Brookings Institution,
 1775 Massachusetts Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20036;
 1976, 943 pps., $19.95 cloth, $10.95 paper. How the
 Japanese have managed their economy over the past two
 decades and an assessment of present and future
 economic prospects are examined by a group of leading
 U.S. social analysts paired with some younger Japanese
 scholars. This highly recommended book provides a basis
 for understanding how Japan emerged from devastation
 following World War II to become the world's third
 largest industrialized nation in less than a quarter of a
 century.
 INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION IN JAPAN
 By Richard E. Caves and Masu Uekusa; Brookings In-
 stitution; 1976, 168 pps., $9.95 cloth, $3.50 paper. The
 authors set about to disprove the accepted theory that
 Japan's industrial society differs from those of the West
 in structure and practices. Caves and Uekusa explain the
 similarities and differences between the industrial
 organizations of the U.S. and Japan and conclude that the
 influence of Japan's institutions on the economy differ lit-
 tle from Western industrial economies.

 HOW JAPAN'S ECONOMY GREW SO FAST
 The Sources of Postwar Expansion; Edward F. I)enison
 and William K. Chung: Brookings Institution: 1976, 265
 pps.. $10.95 cloth, .$4.95 paper. The sources and
 magnitude of Japan's growing economy are compared to
 those of the West. According to the authors, Japan's high
 growth rate resulted from five major areas: Increase in
 labor, increase in capital, reallocation of labor from
 agriculture and self-employment, improved technology in
 production, and economies of scale. Denison and Chung
 see little decline in the high growth rate for the rest of the
 20th century.
 JAPAN'S MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES
 By M.Y. Yoshino; Harvard University Press, 79 Garden
 St., Cambridge, MA 02138; 1976, 191 pps.. $12 50. The
 rapid growth of Japan's economy, its accomplishments,
 implications on the rest of the world and the impact on
 her own culture and society, are significantly examined
 by Professor Yoshino. Because Japan is seeking mul-
 tinational development, present cultural practices within
 the business community must be reexamined and new
 managerial practices must be adopted. The author
 proposes that this may weaken Japan's stability and
 strength.
 JAPAN: THE PARADOX OF PROGRESS
 Edited by Lewis Austin; Yale University Press, 92A Yale
 Station. New Haven. CT 06520; 1976, 338 pps.. $20.00.
 Japan, center of a paradoxical struggle between tradition
 and modernity, faces a changing future that holds a cer-
 tain amount of danger for this nation so dependent on
 outside sources. Eleven essays examine different facets of
 Japanese culture and the problems of a society wherein
 rapid growth generates conflict between traditional
 values and advanced technology. Such problems as how
 Japan, the world's third largest economic power yet
 dependent almost entirely on imports of raw materials,
 would exist in a world of scarcity and how Japan's non-
 violent international policy can survive in a time of
 nuclear proliferation.
 THE NEW ECONOMICS OF GROWTH
 A Strategy for India and the Developing World; by John
 W. Mellor; Cornell University Press: 1976, 335 pps.,
 $11.50. Development strategy is determined by economic
 factors. Mr. Mellor has determined that increased
 employment and greater participation of the poor rather
 than a redistribution of existing output will result in
 greater economic growth. For both rural and urban
 development, the author chooses a plan for technological
 change in agricultural production. India is the blueprint
 for the underdeveloped world.
 PLAIN TALES FROM THE RAJ
 Images of British India in the twentieth century; edited
 by Charles Allen; St. Martin's Press, 175 Fifth Ave., New
 York, NY 10010; 1975, 240 pps., $12.95. Experiences vary-
 ing from the carefree Edwardian childhood to the loss of
 confidence in Anglo-India, the war, partition, departure
 and final regrets comprise this transcription of the
 reminiscences of some 70 ordinary British men and
 women who went to India over the past 50 years. Mos-
 quito nets and snake charmers come alive in these stories
 which were once part of a radio series by the same name.
 THE AGE  DISTRIBUTION OF THE INDIAN
 POPULATION
 A reconstruction for the states and territories, 1881-1961;
 Sudhansu Bhusan Mukherjee: East West Center. East
 West Population Institute. 1777 East-West Road,
 Honolulu, III 96822: 1976, 280 pps., $5.00 paper. A book
 primarily intended for demographers, economists, and
 planners involved in India's population studies, it is also
 widely accepted by others as a substantial study of the
 subject as it pertains to the present and future. India, uni-
 que as a developing country having an ongoing series of
 population reports for more than a century, has made lit-
 tle information available to scholars in the past. The East-
 West book provides numerous tables and diagrams perti-
 nent to the study.
 A MEDITATOR'S DIARY
 A Western Woman's Unique Experiences in Thailand
 Temples: by Jane Hamilton-Merritt; Harper & Row
 Publishers. 10 East 53rd St , New York, NY 10022: 1976,
 157 pps.. $6.95. The author's struggles, fears and often-
 hallucinatory experiences during meditation draw the
 reader closer to the real world of Buddhist meditation.
 This personal account of a Western woman's experiences
 living in Buddhist monasteries in Thailand relates not
 only the changes in her, but offers a practical introduction
 to home meditation and tranquility
 PHILIPPINES: THE SILENCED DEMOCRACY
 By Raul S. Manglapus: Orbis Books, Mary Knoll, NY
 10545; 1976. 205 pps., $7.95. Written by the Philippine's
 most notable political exile, this book reveals how the
 needs and desires of Ferdinand Marcos are served by the
 military and economic leaders in the U.S. He uses the
 book as an appeal for a return look at America's role in
 the Philippine's past especially from the time of Teddy
 Roosevelt and his "Manifest Destiny." The second half of
 the book is devoted to that period in history as written by
 Manglapus in 1974 in his musical comedy, "Manifest
 Destiny"
 BALI PROFILE
 People, Events. Circumstances, 1001-1976; by Willard A.
 Hanna:  American Universities Field Staff, 4 West
 Wheelock St.. Hanover, NH 03755: 1976. 140 pps.. $9.95
 paper. A dearth of information is available on the culture
 of Bali, but little has been written about her historical
 relationships with Westerners. Willard Hanna has put into
 chronological order the development of this rapidly grow-
 ing Pacific Island and the influence Western visitors and
 rulers, particularly the Danes and the Dutch, have had on
 colonialism, revolution and modernization.

 any discussion in the GATT on bilateral restraints resulting
 from the flood of steel exports from Japan to other
 countries. In 1976. ,Japan's steel exports will total $10 billion
 about one-sixth of the dollar value of all Japanese exports
 with more than $2 billion routed to the open U.S. market.
 Rather than face questions in GATT posed by these restraint
 agreements concerning fair and non-discriminatory rules for
 the conduct of world trade in steel Japan may prefer to con-
 tinue quiet bilateral arrangements with Europe when they
 become necessary.
 But where will that leave the United States? I would aver
 - out in the cold when it comes to fair and equitable rules
 for international trade in steel.

 the testimony of C. William Verity. Chairman. Armco Steel
 Corporation, before the Section 301 Committee of the Office
 of Special Trade Representative for Trade Negotiations in
 Washington D.C. Dec. 9.:
 "Lets say the Japanese can sell steel in our market if they
 are $30 below our price - even though this price may be well
 below their total cost. They can get away with this because
 they are not dependent on profits for their survival. As a key
 industry and instrument of national policy. they know that
 the Government will see to it that the steel companies get
 the money necessary to carry out national economic and
 social objectives. Therefore, they can afford to export at
 prices we couldn't touch. The Japanese believe that such
 financial support to the steel industry is better than putting
 out $12,000 a year in unemployment benefits to an un-
 employed steel worker.
 "Why not do the same thing in America?
 ... First, American steel companies cannot sell for long
 at a loss because we neither have nor want government sub-
 sidies.
 "... Secondly, steel trade with Japan is a one-way street.
 Although they have no official restraints on steel imports
 now. I am convinced that they would never allow substantial
 tonnages to enter their market in competition with domestic
 steel. The Government would keep it out through "Ad-
 ministrative Guidance" or other means. In contrast. the U.S.
 market is virtually wide open - in both good and bad
 times. "

 `Confessions'
 (Contined from Page 9)
 "I realized that people would come to our house and it was
 just because of John's job . . . People would sit there and
 never ask me what I was doing. what my interests were . . . I
 mean whole evenings would go by and not one person would
 ask me ... I was just the cook," she says.
 One day, Hudson was horrified to discover "a pattern
 developing in my life." It was a pattern of "learning
 languages and leaving a country and not having anything to
 show for it."
 It frightened her. "It was a nice experience but I wanted
 something to build on."
 With these seeds of growing discontent. Hudson moved to
 her husband's third post - An Asian country with one of the
 largest U.S. missions abroad. It was there that things began
 to snap into place.
 When they first arrived, she says, "I was so wrought up ...
 I said to my husband, 'I keep doing these things and it never
 leads to anything.' "
 Along with the "frustration and boredom" Hudson
 brought to Asia. she felt determined not to learn another
 language but to pursue her design work, instead.
 Early in the first year at her third post. Hudson reached
 yet another turning point. "When we got married in 1964."
 she explains, "my mother gave me 'The Feminine Mystique'
 and a book by Ashley Montague called "The Natural
 Superiority of the Female' ... At that time, I said. 'Mother, I
 don't want to be superior' ... and I wouldn't read the
 books."
 But, by the time she got to Asia, "I was getting frustrated
 ... I didn't really know what was wrong and I didn't know
 what my feelings were about why I couldn't get the work per-
 mit. I just knew I was irritated and something seemed unjust
 about the whole thing." she recalls.
 ''I started probing to find out who was in a similar situa-
 tion ... and I found lots of them." she says.
 Through it all. Hudson says, her husband was "very sup-
 portive." even when she was at a low point and the going was
 rough. The ''pressure" she felt not to embarrass him only
 added to her problems.
 "When I'm not very happy ... I can tell you it affects us all
 .. I know it creates a morale problem for my husband and I
 can't help but believe it does for the State Department,
 generally," Hudson says.
 Other husbands were also supportive, according to Hud-
 son. who says the spouse's action group started quite small
 but kept growing.
 Most of the spouses - in one case, a man - joined the
 group after a personal experience left them frustrated and
 hostile, Hudson says.
 By this time. Hudson was working illegally in a job that,
 while not in her field, had been easy to get.
 "I taught English in a school that had been hiring
 diplomat's wives for years ... No one had ever gotten a work
 permit ... Everyone advises you when you get the job just to
 keep your mouth shut ... As long as the embassy doesn't
 know about it, it's okay." she says.
 Hudson continued to plug away at design work until she
 finally received her reward - a small job doing some art
 work for a magazine. From her magazine designs came an
 offer from a huge textile firm to do work on a royalty basis.
 Hudson took it, fully realizing she had broken through a
 barrier.
 "I realized that there was a certain amount of luck involv-
 ed and I wished that everybody could have the luck," she
 says.
 This time, when Hudson came back to the States, she had
 something to build on - designs that are still bringing in
 royalties and which have led to offers from big apparel firms
 here.
 She thinks she now has what she has been looking for -
 "the personal satisfaction of doing something that someone
 else wants, of feeling fulfilled ... of standing on my own."
 Still, Hudson feels scarred by the experience and the
 "needless" difficulty she encountered getting where she is.
 She is certain if the State Department took even a slight in-
 terest in the problems of spouses - showed a willingness to
 discuss them and correct the ones that can be solved -
 everyone would benefit.
 And that is why she agreed to tell her story.

 Mekong
 (Continued from Page 13)
 young intellectuals of that university have played in bringing
 change to what is still a semi-feudal country. October 6,
 which followed a wave of assassinations of left-wing figures,
 has once again swung the pendulum against such
 rationalizers. Pichai Rathanakun, Foreign Minister before
 the coup, and the first Thai Foreign Minister ever to visit
 Hanoi, is now in exile. Anand Panyarachun, Undersecretary
 of Foreign Affairs and architect of what was called a new
 Thai foreign policy of 'equidistance" has been removed
 from his position.
 Among those arrested after the coup was Pansak
 Vinyaratn, editor and publisher of a Thai news weekly, who
 in 1974 became the first Thai journalist in recent times to
 openly travel to Vietnam and to report about his experience.
 Pansak was released on a large bond only after his arrest
 attracted widespread international attention. Khaisaeng
 Suksai, an elected Socialist Member of Parliament who less
 than two years ago led a Parliamentary delegation to Viet-
 nam, fled into exile in Laos even before October 6 after his
 party's Secretary General was gunned down in Bangkok.
 Since the coup. he is said to have joined the resistance and to
 be one of the leaders of a government in exile now forming.
 Even before October 6, American attempts to counter a
 rapprochement between Bangkok and Hanoi so upset one
 Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman (who has since lost his job)
 that he remarked: "When a big power does it. you call it
 detente: when we do it. you call it defeatism ... We have liv-
 ed with the Vietnamese more than 400 years. We know
 perfectly well their mentality. Why can't you (Americans)
 allow us to live in peace for five years. Then we can show you
 that we can be a neutral country, or at least play a part in
 neutralizing the region for the benefit of every superpower."
 In May 1975 a Bangkok English-language magazine.
 Business in Thailand, ran an article describing the Viet-
 namese as "an aggressive, acquisitive, bellicose and
 xenophobic race imbued with delusions of superiority and a
 Messianic sense of manifest destiny. It can be safely conclud-
 ed that the Vietnamese have not lost the will, the appetite.
 nor the determination for conquest ..." The article was in-
 spired - like a similar one in Bangkok's major English-
 language daily. the Bangkok Post - by an American army
 study ("External Support to the Thai insurgency: the 35th
 PL 95th NVA Combined Command") which quietly - and
 anonymously - surfaced during the final throes of fighting
 in Cambodia and Vietnam. The study. which was also cir-
 culated among Thai officials, purported a Vietnamese
 master plan to bring the Western bank of the Mekong, and
 indeed the entire lower Mekong watershed, under Hanoi's
 political and economic suzerainty.
 Certainly Vietnam emerges from the second Indochina
 War with unprecedented prestige and strength. Thailand. on
 the other hand. finds itself wedded to the United States in a
 downgraded anti-communist alliance, and domestically rack-
 ed with social upheaval the dimensions of which remain un-
 certain. Still, there is little or nothing to support the allega-
 tion that Vietnam has territorial or political designs on
 Thailand, that the Thai Communist Party would cooperate
 with such designs should they exist. or that the Thai Com-
 munist Party or any other political group could coopt
 Thailand's present revolutionary tendencies toward such an
 end.
 Given the political, military and economic realities which
 pertain, the Mekong River as a new Southeast Asian Maginot
 Line is folly, regardless of whether one stands on the West
 Bank or the East bank: to so conceive it is only to serve
 "bellicose and xenophobic" prophecies like the Acheson
 assumption.
 The Vietnamese appear to have grasped this far better
 than the Americans. On the war's end, while the United
 States was busy with the Mayaguez incident and other
 maneuvers which intentionally or otherwise frustrated Thai
 efforts at ostpolitik, Vietnam sent two high-level delegations
 (one led by the deputy foreign minister) to Bangkok, the first
 dispatched anywhere in the world once the fighting had
 stopped.
 Unfortunately, failure in Indochina appears to have taught
 theUnited States more about the erosion of its own political
 institutions under the weight of superpower than about the
 myopic and negative way it has played the superpower role.
 In fiscal year 1975 alone American military assistance to
 Thailand ($42.5 million) was roughly equivalent to the total
 1957-75 American assistance to the Mekong Committee ($45.6
 million). In 1976, American military assistance budget for
 Thailand was nearly doubled (to $81.75 million), while as
 mentioned earlier, that of the Mekong Committee's was cut
 entirely.
 An argument can be made for destructiveness for its own
 sake, but international relations of that type have no place in
 the repertoire of a leading global power if we are all to es-
 cape the apocalyptic tendencies of our century. The point
 remains that if there are to be constructive relations in the
 Mekong Basin the valencies of the Basin must be promoted.
 The limitations of American power acknowledged, the
 United States is in a position to assist with the task.

 of me so straight. each carrying a basket or a hoe not to over-
 burden me, their tears falling privately ..." Too often,
 however, she forgets the vital dictum that "less is more,"
 playing with words to the point of absurdity and inflating an
 image until it practically pops:
 "Her forehead and knees against the earth, her body con-
 vulsed and then released her onto her back."
 (Question - are "her body" and "her" separated in this
 situation? Can one release the other onto "her back"?)
 "The round moon cakes and round doorways, the round
 tables of graduated size that fit one roundness inside
 another, round windows and rice bowls ... The villagers
 were speeding up the circle of events ... This roundness had
 to be made coin-sized so that she would see its circumference
 ... People who refused fatalism because they could invent
 small resources insisted on culpability .. .
 Whatever that means. When Kingston grows erudite she
 writes kitsch - it's as simple as that. Her habit is to
 manipulate a reader's impression by carefully interjecting a
 generality, abstraction. or value judgement into a specific
 gesture. "My aunt combed individuality into her bob, her
 body and her complexity seemd to disappear." "Brothers
 and sisters had to efface their sexual color," and positively
 the worst - "Concrete pours out of my mouth to cover the
 forests with freeways and sidewalks."
 By far Kingston's biggest mistake is that she devotes so
 much time to the story of her nameless aunt and the aveng-
 ing warrior, only to drop them in the remaining narrative
 like hot potatoes. And though we can infer that the mere
 reporting of these two spirits is, as the author states, suf-
 ficient "vengeance - not the beheading, not the gutting, but
 the words," we are still left with the hollow feeling that both
 Mu Lan and No Name Woman were sacrificed for the com-
 pany of lesser ghosts.
