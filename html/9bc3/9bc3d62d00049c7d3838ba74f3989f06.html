 Summary
 Information available
 as of 5 September 1986
 was used in this report.
 of an Embass
 China's Diplomats in the
 United States: The Maturing
 cooperation since the normalization of relations in 1979.
 Since 1983 Beijing has transformed its Embassy in Washington from a
 fledgling establishment designed merely to monitor bilateral relations into
 an organization that pursues China's national interests with increasing
 effectiveness: The motivation for the changes was the signing of the
 Shanghai Communique on 1 August 1982. The communique downplayed
 the question of US arms sales to Taiwan, removing what had been the pri-
 mary obstacle to broader political, commercial, technological, and military
 Affairs.
 Expanding relations between the United States and China necessitated
 major changes in the quality, number, and variety of Embassy personnel.
 First, the Embassy needed a competent ambassador, experienced in
 international affairs and Sino-US relations. It also required a more
 apolitical staff, able to provide the kind of objective analysis needed by
 Beijing to shape policy toward the United States and to deal with an
 increasing number of complex technical issues, such as nuclear fuel
 development, satellite technology, and textile quotas. To meet these needs,
 Beijing has since 1983:
 ? Twice replaced its Ambassador.
 ? Sent officials with greater experience in Sino-US affairs and with more
 technical training.
 ? Increased the Embassy staff by 47 percent (from 77 in 1983 to 113 in
 1986).
 ? Appointed more non-Foreign Ministry officials (in 1983 only 21 percent
 were not diplomats; now 58 percent, or 68 of the 113, come from outside
 the Ministry).
 ? Reduced the Political Affairs Section's authority over specialized trade
 and S&T issues, giving more responsibility to the technical personnel in
 sections such as Commercial Affairs and Science and Technology
 By putting more experienced, specialized diplomats in the four major
 sections-Political Affairs, Commercial Affairs, Science and Technology
 Affairs, and the Defense Attache's Office-Beijing has greatly improved
 the Embassy's ability to report on US policy and to promote Chinese
 interests:
 ? Political officers now meet regularly with a wide variety of US officials
 in Washington and no longer base their analysis primarily on US media
 reports. They have developed a better understanding of US politics and
 are more effective lobbyists than were their predecessors.

 ? The commercial section, despite internal coordination difficulties, now
 has a cadre of highly trained specialists who are better equipped to
 handle the nuances of trade negotiations, military procurement, and
 investment.
 ? To keep up with Beijing's growing demand for technology and military
 information, the Science and Technology Affairs Section and the
 Defense Attache's Office have sharply increased the number and sophis-
 tication of their employees. These new officials have a better understand-
 ing of complex scientific and military subjects

 China's Diplomats in the
 United States: The Maturing
 of an Embassy
 The signing of the Shanghai Communique in August
 1982 opened a new phase in Sino-US relations by
 removing obstacles to broader political, commercial,
 technological, and military cooperation. Beijing, how-
 ever, entered this new phase with an ambassador-
 Chai Zemin-who was unable to effectively direct an
 embassy with growing responsibilities. US State De-
 partment officials say Chai was appointed more for
 his Chinese Communist Party (CCP) credentials than
 for his expertise in US affairs; moreover, he relied
 heavily on Foreign Ministry instructions, showed little
 energy or creativity in administration, and discour-
 aged his staff from meeting with US counterparts.
 The April 1983 appointment of Ambassador Zhang
 Wenjin put a seasoned diplomat in charge of the
 Embassy. A US affairs expert, Zhang had participat-
 ed in meetings leading to the 1972 visit to China of
 then President Richard Nixon. He was highly regard-
 ed by senior Chinese leaders and his Foreign Ministry
 peers for his administrative skills and his understand-
 ing of international affairs, as well as for the quality
 of his political analysis, according to US diplomats in
 Beijing.
 Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have told US
 diplomats that Zhang was assigned to Washington to
 invigorate Embassy reporting, which until then had
 been drawn primarily from the US media. He made
 two personnel decisions that enabled the Embassy to
 develop a broader range of sources and upgrade the
 quality of its reporting. In June 1983 Zhang trans-
 ferred then San Francisco Consul General Hu Dingyi
 to the Embassy as Deputy Chief of Mission. Hu's
 superior performance in dealing with West Coast
 politicians and businessmen made him an attractive
 choice as a role model for Embassy officials, who
 rarely left their offices to meet with Americans and
 were often ignorant of impending US decisions, ac-
 cording to US officials in Washington. At the Embas-
 sy Hu actively encouraged political officers to aban-
 don their closeted workstyle, meet more regularly
 with their US counterparts, and learn in advance
 about changes in US policy.'
 informed analysis of US policy.
 In October 1983 Ambassador Zhang personally ar-
 ranged the transfer of Zhang Zai, a longtime personal
 and professional associate and then deputy director of
 the Foreign Ministry's American and Oceanian Af-
 fairs Department, to the Embassy's Political Affairs
 Section. US diplomats in Beijing at that time said
 that Zhang Zai, one of China's leading America
 watchers, could be counted on to provide a more
 In May 1985 Ambassador Zhang was replaced by
 Han Xu, widely acknowledged as the Foreign Minis-
 try's highest ranking specialist on US affairs and one
 of the few Chinese Government officials to have dealt
 with US officials since the 1940s.2 During World War
 II Han drove ambulances for US pilots shot down
 over China. After the Communists defeated the Na-
 tionalists in the civil war, he delivered China's request
 for recognition to the US Embassy in Beijing. In
 February 1972 he played a major role in the visit of
 President Nixon. The following year Han was as-
 signed to Washington as Deputy Chief of the PRC
 Liaison Office (now Embassy). He remained there
 until 1979, when he returned to the Ministry as Vice
 Foreign Minister in charge of American and Oceani-
 an affairs.

 Han and Zhang: Cut From the Same Cloth
 Han Xu and Zhang Wenjin have followed similar
 career paths. They served simultaneously in the
 Foreign Ministry (1950-64, 1970-73, 1980-83) and
 abroad (1973-76). Both were purged during the early
 years of the Cultural Revolution (1967) but, like
 several leading Chinese diplomats at that time, were
 probably protected by then Premier Zhou Enlai. The
 only major difference in their careers came during
 1973-76, when Han was deputy chief of the Liaison
 Office in Washington and Zhang was Ambassador to
 Canada (Beijing's premier America-watching post
 from the 1950s until the opening of the Liaison Office
 in 1972). Later, both men returned to Beijing to serve
 in turn as vice foreign minister in charge of US affairs
 (Zhang, 1978-83; Han, 1983-85), each immediately
 prior to appointment as Ambassador to the United
 States.
 Since becoming Ambassador, Han has renewed rela-
 tionships formed with US Government and industry
 officials when he served at the Liaison Office. During
 official and informal meetings with US officials he
 has spoken knowledgeably-usually without notes or
 other assistance-on topics ranging from purchasing
 land for diplomatic housing to chemical weapons and
 nuclear proliferation. Han, who in the past impressed
 Western diplomats as being stern and sometimes
 blunt, has surprised US officials in Washington with
 his congenial manner and a diplomatic style that is
 less pedantic than it was in Beijing. State Department

 officials say that his February 1986 airing of Chinese
 objections to US arms sales to Taiwan was considera-
 bly less shrill and vehement than past performances.
 This probably reflects his diplomatic skill and adapt-
 ability as well as improvement in the broader US-
 Chinese relationship.

 Wang Li, who frequently departs from official rheto-

 Ambassadors Zhang and Han have relied increasingly
 on the Embassy's two minister-counselors, 18 counsel-
 ors, and defense attache to oversee daily operations.
 The counselors supervise the staff, prepare reports to
 Beijing, and serve as the Ambassador's point of
 reference for specific bilateral issues.' (See chart.)
 During the past three years they have gained greater
 latitude in determining which issues are of interest to
 Beijing and how they should be reported, according to
 a variety of US officials. By virtue of their training
 and familiarity with Sino-US affairs, the counselors
 at the Embassy today are well qualified to manage
 their increased responsibilities. Indeed, on the basis of
 our conversations with US diplomats in Beijing and
 with US Government           officials in Wash-
 ington, we believe many of them are the leading US
 affairs experts in their home organizations. Of the 20
 current counselors, 16 led or participated in Sino-US
 negotiations before assignment to Washington, 13 had
 previously traveled to the United States, and 10 have
 been involved in Sino-US affairs for over a decade.

 ' Most Embassy sections are headed by counselors; Political Affairs
 and Commercial Affairs, which have 10 and three counselors,
 respectively, are headed by Minister-Counselors. The Chinese
 diplomatic system is similar to the British Foreign Service in that

 The Model Counselor
 Minister-Counselor Zhang Zai exemplifies the new
 breed of counselor. He frequently ran the Embassy in
 Ambassador Zhang's absence and is now both the
 Embassy's second in command and head of the
 Political Affairs Section! He speaks fluent English
 and has been active in Sino-US relations since 1971,
 when then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger secret-
 ly visited China. Zhang has told US diplomats in
 Beijing that he returned to the Foreign Ministry in
 1971 because discussions during Kissinger's visit
 clearly revealed a lack of officials with either an
 understanding of US affairs or a command of the
 English language (he had joined the Ministry in 1949
 after attending Beijing University but had been criti-
 cized by the radical Red Guards at the height of the
 Cultural Revolution and sent to a farm).
 Unlike his predecessors, Zhang holds regular discus-
 sions with a variety of US officials, including mem-
 bers of the National Security Council, the State
 Department, and Congress. People who have dealt

 with him say that in formal meetings he is quietly
 assertive and prepared to discuss any number of
 current issues, but that his remarks generally do not
 contradict the Beijing line. They have observed, how-
 ever, that during informal discussions Zhang will
 criticize his superiors' decisions if he believes they are
 wrong.
 We believe Zhang Zai has begun to staff the Political
 Affairs Section with seasoned America watchers who
 are also apparently his political allies. He was respon-
 sible for having Wang Li, a longtime friend, assigned
 to Washington as a political counselor in February
 1985, according to US diplomats. Wang, who has
 dealt with Americans since the 1950s-when he was a
 translator for the Neutral Nations Armistice Com-
 mittee in Panmunjom-had spent his entire Foreign
 Ministry career in the American and Oceanian Af-
 fairs Department. In 1980 he earned an M.A. degree
 in international relations from the Johns Hopkins
 University School for Advanced International Stud-
 ies.
 The Technical Specialists
 Beijing has strengthened the Embassy's ability to
 oversee activities in other areas by assigning as coun-
 selors non-Foreign Ministry officials who are familiar
 with Sino-US affairs, speak English, and are techni-
 cally qualified. These new counselors have managed
 their duties more successfully than did their predeces-
 sors, who lacked such abilities, according to a variety
 of Washington officials. Counselors Chen Shibiao
 (commercial) and Lu Jingting (science and technology)
 the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
 Trade (MOFERT) from 1983 until 1985, he negotiat-
 ed the 1984 Sino-US Industrial and Technological
 Agreement, arranged for the visit of the US Presiden-
 tial Trade Mission during the summer of 1984, and
 participated in the 1984 sessions of the Joint Econom-
 ic Commission and of the Bilateral Investment Treaty
 Talks. As a member of Premier Zhao Ziyang's and
 President Li Xiannian's delegations to the United
 States during 1984 and 1985, respectively, Chen
 chaired the commerce-related discussions.
 A career State Science and Technology Commission
 (SSTC) scientist, Counselor Lu Jingting has been
 involved in Sino-US scientific cooperation for over a
 decade; his predecessor had only three years' experi-
 ence in handling bilateral scientific issues before
 coming to the Embassy. Since arriving in Washington
 in October 1985, Lu has familiarized himself with key
 Washington organizations and their personnel who
 handle Sino-US scientific relations, according to offi-
 cials of the Departments of Commerce and State.
 Before coming to Washington, he had served since
 1984 as deputy director of the SSTC's Exchange
 Center, where he was responsible for monitoring
 exchange programs involving Chinese and foreign
 students, scientists, and businessmen. That same year
 he was appointed to the UN Advisory Board on
 Science and Technology Development. As deputy
 director of the SSTC's Foreign Affairs Bureau from
 1974 until 1979, Lu met with numerous visiting US
 scientists, including a delegation from the American
 Aeronautical and Astronautical Society in 1978.
 are two examples.
 Commercial Counselor Chen Shibiao speaks English
 and is skilled in dealing with Americans
 Since coming to Wash-
 ington in August 1985, Chen has participated in Sino-
 US talks on such issues as textiles, steel quotas, and
 COCOM restrictions. In contrast to his predecessor,
 who had handled Sino-European trade affairs before
 coming to Washington, Chen had previously focused
 almost exclusively on US affairs. As director of the
 US and Canada Division of the Third Department of
 Beijing's post-1983 effort to appoint well-qualified,
 well-educated officials extends below the counselor
 level. On the basis of conversations with US officials
 in Beijing and Washington, we believe the Embassy's
 33 first secretaries are representative of recent staff
 assignments.
 Like the
 counselors, the first secretaries are well acquainted
 with Sino-US affairs-55 percent (18) were involved

 in Sino-US affairs before being assigned to Washing-
 ton, and 30 percent (10) have served previously in the
 United States. The current group of first secretaries is
 also well educated-45 percent (15) are known univer-
 sity graduates, 85 percent (28) speak some English,
 and 18 percent (6) have been trained in at least one
 additional foreign language.
 Staff quality appears to have been improved by the
 assignment of highly trained specialists from Chinese
 corporations, institutes, and commissions with a stake
 in specialized negotiations and reporting. Fifty-five
 percent (18 of the 33 current first secretaries) were
 sent by non-Foreign Ministry organizations, and 39
 percent (13) have specialized technical skills in such
 areas as heavy machinery, antisubmarine weaponry,
 and space systems. These officials use their expertise
 to handle negotiations on issues of interest to their
 home organizations and, according to US officials in
 Washington, provide good reporting on those issues.
 One example is Commercial First Secretary Chang
 Liangcai of the China National Machinery Import
 and Export Corporation (MACHIMPEX), China's
 leading trader of industrial equipment. Appointed to
 the Embassy in September 1983, he oversees talks
 regarding trade in heavy machinery and reports on
 US actions affecting his corporation. He maintains
 close ties to officials of MACHIMPEX, according to
 Commerce Department officials. As a company offi-
 cial from 1979 to 1982, Chang helped attract and
 coordinate heavy machinery exports to China. Imme-
 diately before coming to Washington he served for a
 year as a deputy division chief in MOFERT's Loan
 Project Office, where he was exposed to the intrica-
 cies of arranging trade agreements.
 The staff also has a stake in fostering good Sino-US
 relations. Unlike their predecessors, who rose through
 the ranks during the Soviet alliance and the Korean
 and Vietnam wars, when Beijing advocated an anti-
 US foreign policy, this generation of professionals has
 established careers during a time of improving bilater-
 al relations. Of the first secretaries, for example, 42
 percent (14) began after the early 1970s. Subsequent
 years have seen the creation of numerous US-related
 jobs in Washington and Beijing and the expansion of
 a cadre of US affairs experts who see strong relations
 as important to their careers. Because of their person-
 al interest, they seem more eager than their predeces-
 sors to work out differences with their US counter-
 parts, according to US officials. This eagerness, how-
 ever, probably stops far short of willingness to concede
 on important points.
 Political First Secretary Lian Zhengbao, Cultural
 First Secretary Su Guang, and Science and Technol-
 ogy Second Secretary Jing Zhaoqian
 epresent this younger group. Lian Zhengbao,
 now 45, was appointed first secretary in 1985. He
 meets regularly with his US counterparts and has
 discussed a variety of subjects, including China's
 objections to the US Government's use of the term
 "Republic of China" in its publications and Beijing's
 concern that Taiwan officials would obstruct inquiries
 into the 1985 murder of Chinese-American Henry
 Liu. Lian, who joined the Foreign Ministry in 1965,
 after graduating from the Ministry's Institute of
 International Relations, has been active in Sino-US
 relations since joining the US Affairs Division in
 1970. He served as a notetaker during Henry Kissin-
 ger's secret visit to Beijing in 1971 and has told US
 diplomats that he helped draft the first communi-
 que-which China ultimately tabled-on normaliza-
 tion of relations.
 Su Guang, 42, is the youngest first secretary in the
 Cultural Affairs Section. Appointed in March 1985,
 he had served with the Chinese People's Association
 for Friendship With Foreign Countries since the mid-
 1970s. He was the official interpreter for Chen
 Xitong, the mayor of Beijing, during Chen's 1984 US
 visit. A language major in college, Su was accepted by
 the Monterey Language Institute in California in
 1979 but was unable to attend.
 As the representative to the United States from the
 Ministry of Astronautics Industry, Jing Zhaoqian, 44,
 has been the principal contact for US Government
 and industry officials during negotiations to purchase
 a direct-broadcast satellite. Trained as an engineer-

 Secret
 Life at the Embassy
 The assignment to Washington of Chinese diplomats
 who are younger and more familiar with US affairs
 has led to increased curiosity about American culture
 and society. With better English-language capabili-
 ties than their predecessors, Embassy personnel-
 particularly those at the second-secretary level and
 above-routinely attend cultural and academic
 events, serve as keynote speakers at international
 conferences and seminars, and no longer shun the
 media. The first staff members (other than the Em-
 bassy's regular chauffeurs) obtained their drivers'
 licenses in 1985 and can now operate the Embassy's
 fleet of tourbuses and minivans to take frequent trips
 to areas of historic or scenic interest. The staff has
 visited such sites as Colonial Williamsburg, Niagara
 Falls, and Disney World/EPCOT Center.
 The Embassy is a close-knit group of families who
 live, work, and play together. All members-except
 the Ambassador and a few of his personal staff-live
 at the Embassy. (According to the State Department,
 an agreement concluded in 1984 allowed the Chinese
 to purchase two separate properties for Cultural
 Affairs Section offices and housing, but officials have
 not yet moved into these facilities.) In late 1984 the
 Washington Post reported that, within the Embassy,
 daily routines varied but most staff members began
 their day at dawn with morning exercises. After the
 news and breakfast, workers went to their offices
 from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Following dinner, most
 participated in evening exercises and then watched
 television or a Chinese or American movie. Sports are
 frequent diversions, and many members jog around
 the Embassy in the morning and swim and play
 tennis at the Ambassador's residence in the after-
 noon.

 technical knowledge, relaxed style, and command of
 English.
 The assignment of trained specialists familiar with
 such complex issues as textile quotas, technology
 transfer, and military weapons procurement has en-
 abled the Embassy's four major sections- Political
 Affairs, Commercial Affairs, Science and Technology
 Affairs, and the Defense Attache's Office-to man-
 age their specialized tasks independently. Because of
 the sections' new autonomy, the Political Affairs
 Section is no longer able to dominate nonpolitical
 areas, as it did before 1983. US commercial officials
 once had to discuss all significant issues with Embassy
 political officers because commercial or S&T and
 technology personnel were incapable of holding mean-
 ingful talks. US military and government officials in
 Washington say that, since the 1983 appointment of
 Defense Attache Zhang Wutang, Chinese military
 attaches have asserted greater control over military
 issues, discussing them not only with US Department
 of Defense officers but also with officials in the State
 Department and the National Security Council. F_
 Although the assignment of better trained, more
 specialized personnel has made non-Foreign Ministry
 sections more independent, it has also created coordi-
 nation and communications problems that did not
 exist when the political section oversaw all major
 issues. Commercial Counselor Chen and Science and
 Technology Counselor Lu, in particular, are often
 bypassed by subordinates who come from different
 organizations and report directly to their superiors in
 Beijing, according to their US counterparts. US offi-
 cials in Washington say Embassy officers in the
 Commercial and Science and Technology Sections
 frequently fail-often deliberately-to inform their
 superiors of specific projects, leading to delays in
 routine business and ignorance of current events.
 Science and Technology Counselor Lu Jingting's sur-
 prise at learning of the well-publicized October 1985
 resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary
 Margaret Heckler epitomizes this problem. State
 Department officials say that, despite the section's
 responsibility for arranging the Secretary's visit to      25X1
 Beijing later that year, Lu's staff failed to inform him,

 leaving him unaware of the resignation several weeks
 after it occurred.
 Political Affairs: The Vanguard of Improvement
 Since 1983 the Political Affairs Section has improved
 its ability to deal with US officials; we believe that its
 reporting has also improved markedly. The close
 association of the Foreign Ministry's best America
 watchers, including Ambassadors Zhang and Han, as
 well as other senior US Affairs Division personnel
 assigned to Washington, has enabled the section to
 understand and work with Americans more success-
 fully than it did under Ambassador Chai. Current
 political officers, in contrast to their predecessors,
 make more of an effort to bounce ideas off their US
 counterparts and are not as inclined to base their
 analysis strictly on US media reports. Working break-
 fasts and luncheons are no longer a rarity-the 1985
 nuclear cooperation agreement was formulated entire-
 ly through a series of working lunches with State
 Department officials in Washington, for example-
 and demarches are delivered on a diplomatic level
 without the nationalistic rhetoric that accompanied
 them in the past.
 New and Improved Reporting. Since the appointment
 of Ambassador Zhang, the Embassy has sought to
 improve its political analysis and boost the influence
 of its reporting in Beijing. Reporting from Washing-
 ton-like that from other missions-has traditionally
 carried little weight with foreign policy makers

 Foreign Ministry's assignment to the Political Affairs
 Section of knowledgable officers such as Zhang Zai
 and Wang Li was in large part a response to com-
 plaints from senior leaders about the quality of Em-
 bassy analysis. The assignment of better officers-
 and their increased interaction with US officials-has
 resulted in more informed, complete, and unbiased
 interpretations of US policies and views. For example,
 State Department officials say that, during the 1985
 negotiations to include China on the list of countries
 eligible to receive US foreign aid, a Chinese political
 officer read to his US counterpart the text of a
 telegram before it was sent to Beijing in order to
 ensure that US views were accurately represented.
 The message, containing the Embassy's analysis of
 the issue, used exact quotes from and the names of US
 officials to support its comments. US diplomats in
 Beijing report that ensuing discussions with their
 Foreign Ministry counterparts were more successful
 than they had anticipated.

 Secret
 the Embassy's lobby-    25X1
 We believe Ambassadors Han and Zhang have used
 their influence to get the Embassy's analysis to top
 leaders. Unlike Chai, both were chosen by Deng
 Xiaoping, and Han has stated publicly that he reports
 directly to Deng. Neither Han nor Zhang hesitated to
 return to Beijing to participate in foreign policy
 discussions affecting Sino-US relations, according to
 US diplomats in Beijing. This personal involvement is
 important because Chinese foreign policy making
 remains highly centralized; we know
 that Deng, with the assistance of
 Premier Zhao Ziyang and CCP Secretary Hu Yao-
 bang, is the ultimate arbiter in major foreign policy
 decisions.
 The New Lobbyists on Capitol Hill. The Political
 Affairs Section's highly successful efforts to interact
 with officials in the executive branch of the US
 Government have not yet been matched on Capitol
 Hill. In the past, Embassy political officers did not
 understand how Congress operated, tended to remain
 "behind the curve" on issues of concern to them, and
 frequently missed opportunities to expand their influ-
 ence
 Although Beijing's lobbying effort on the Hill is still
 in its infancy, during the last three years the section
 has improved its technique and added new programs.
 Zhang Zai and Wang Li-the most active lobbyists-
 have a better understanding of how US Government
 policy is made and are more tolerant of political
 posturing than were their predecessors
 Capitol Hill regularly,
 Zhang and Wang work
 ing during the 1985 Congressional debate over provid-
 ing AID family planning assistance funds to China
 illustrated its maturing finesse. During this debate,
 several US Congressmen raised the issue of whether
 China, which advocates forced abortions, should re-

 ceive US assistance.        the Chinese were 25X1
 unable to curtail Congressional discussion of family
 planning and medical practices,
 the predictable approach would have been to declare
 it an issue of national sovereignty, harangue the
 United States for bullying, and angrily issue political
 demarches and public pronouncements condemning
 Congress. In this instance, however, the Chinese
 pursued their interests in a low-key manner, sending
 formal letters and holding constructive one-on-one
 talks with key US Congressmen and Senators.
 In addition to improving its style, the Embassy has
 during the last three years added to its lobbying
 resources:
 ? It has increased its use of established US lobbying
 groups. In 1985 China ranked fourth among Asian
 nations in the number of lobbying firms retained; it
 employed 24 such firms.
 ? It created a formal organization in 1984 to coordi-
 nate trips to China for Congressmen during the
 January and August recesses. US officials say the
 Chinese organization, modeled after Taiwan's long-
 standing program, has become more popular and
 effective than Taipei's efforts because of a willing-
 ness to grant access to senior leaders.
 Ambassador Han has told State Department officials
 that because of the number and complexity of issues
 affecting China, two new officers will expand the
 Embassy's network for knowing how, when, and why
 Congress will act.

 Secret
 Commercial Affairs: Slowly Making Needed Changes
 Appointments to the Commercial Affairs Section
 since 1983 have infused the group with experienced,
 well-educated, and young officers who are more active
 in meeting their US counterparts than were their
 predecessors
 Of the 11 first and second secretaries, 10
 have a commercial background; 16 of the section's 20
 members speak some English. All of the members
 below the first-secretary level are in their thirties or
 forties.
 Unlike their counterparts in the Political Affairs
 Section, however, the commercial officers lack initia-
 tive and teamwork, according to US Commerce De-
 partment officers, who add that the commercial offi-
 cers tend to view their jobs as routine desk work and
 are frequently ignorant of recent developments. Coop-
 eration is further hampered because members come
 from two ministries, four corporations, and one com-
 mission and because each organization tasks its own
 employees and requires them to report directly to it."
 Within the ranks of the counselors and first and second secretar-
 ies, the section includes five members from MOFERT; three from
 the SEC; two each from MACHIMPEX and the China National
 Chemical Construction Corporation; and at least one each from the
 Xinshidai (New Era) Company, the China National Petroleum
 Corporation, the China Council for the Promotion of International
 Trade, and the Ministry of Chemical Industry.0
 Beijing's emphasis on diplomatic professionalism has
 caused Chinese Communist Party (CCP) influence
 and activities at the Embassy to ebb. US officials who
 meet with Embassy officers say that, under Ambas-
 sadors Han and Zhang, diplomats have been able to
 miss party meetings to attend business functions-
 unlike their predecessors, who were required to at-
 tend all political study sessions. Embassy personnel
 who miss these meetings are usually briefed by the
 party secretary at a later date.
 Like all Chinese institutions, the Embassy maintains
 an internal CCP committee, created and staffed by
 the party to relay directives and to monitor the
 loyalty of its members.
 Within the past year Beijing has moved to strengthen
 the section by posting three new counselors to oversee
 key functions:
 ? In August 1985 Chen Shibiao was assigned to
 handle trade negotiations.
 ? In September 1985 Ye Zhenhua was assigned to
 oversee military procurement, an area of growing
 importance and one with which Commercial Coun-
 selor Chen was unfamiliar.
 ? In June 1986 Xu Ji was assigned as economic
 counselor to attract US investors.

 in China, an area which received little attention under
 his predecessor.' The former director of the Foreign
 Affairs Bureau of the State Economic Commission
 and one of China's leading experts on international
 finance, Xu has dealt with US financial and banking
 officials since 1979 and appears well qualified for his
 current post.               he is knowledgeable
 on international economic and financial issues and has
 supported closer ties with the United States in these
 areas.                               he favors
 forcing Chinese companies and enterprises to obtain
 backing from foreign investors because these creditors
 would want a return on their investment and therefore
 would ensure that their Chinese partners ran their
 operations efficiently and profitably.
 ' In December 1984 Beijing created an economic counselor position
 at the Embassy to get economic analysis from a post that was not
 reporting and to boost the level of US investment in China. Liu
 Guangpu, an experienced SEC official who filled the post when it
 was created, encouraged his staff to develop contacts with several
 US economic think tanks; the section, however, continued to base
 its analysis on US media reports. For example, US diplomats in
 Beijing say that senior Chinese financial officials were unprepared
 for the 1986 reintroduction of protectionist legislation, having
 believed Embassy economic reporting-which was based on US
 press reports-that the US protectionist tide was ebbing. F

 ? Since 1983 the section has increased its efforts to
 identify and recruit Overseas Chinese scientists
 willing to teach or lecture in China, according to the
 FBI. In 1984 the section helped develop a program
 that regularly sends such scientists to China, where
 their expenses are paid by the individual ministries,
 institutes, and universities that benefit from their
 expertise.
 The section's ability to obtain the information Beijing
 wants has been bolstered by the assignment of nine
 highly specialized scientists and engineers-including,
 for example, a satellite engineer from the Ministry of
 Astronautics Industry, a physicist from the State
 Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), and a
 health sciences specialist from the Chinese Academy
 of Sciences-to replace the seven generalists who
 made up the staff before 1983. The new personnel
 have pursued their contacts more vigorously than did
 their predecessors, according to the FBI, and because
 of their advanced scientific training can elicit more
 useful information in technical dialogues.
 As the Embassy's technical experts, they also help
 manage technology-related programs that cross bu-
 reaucratic lines. For example, US Government and
 military officers say that science and technology
 officers work closely with their counterparts in the
 Defense Attache's Office and Commercial Affairs
 Section to oversee issues relating to technology trans-
 fer or COCOM-controlled equipment. Other US offi-
 cials note that the staff cooperates with members of
 the Education Affairs Section to monitor the activities
 of PRC students in the United States and guide their
 studies at US universities. Science and technology
 officers also manage the Embassy's annual pur-
 chase                   -of an estimated
 80,000 US Government publications, including those
 issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
 ministration, the Defense Technical Center, the Na-
 tional Technical Information Service, and the Depart-
 ment of Energy.
 Defense Attache's Office:
 Growing Awareness of International Affairs
 The 12-member Defense Attache's Office gives Bei-
 jing a highly effective means of monitoring worldwide
 military affairs, say Department of Defense officials.
 A Growing Covert Collection F4,6`ort
 The FBI reports that the
 largest number of officials engaged in covert opera-
 tions now serves in the Science and Technology
 Affairs Section and the Defense Attache's Office,
 although a significant number of consular and cultur-
 al officials are engaged in covert recruitment of
 Chinese-Americans and Taiwanese living in Washing-
 ton.
 Rivaling the Embassy's political officers in their
 willingness to meet with their US counterparts,,Chi-
 nese military officers frequently visit the Pentagon to
 discuss issues ranging from current events in Afghani-
 stan, Central America, and the Middle East to the
 evolving Sino-US military relationship. The attaches
 attend briefings, seminars, and social functions to
 collect and report information on US military strategy
 and equipment, as well as US information on Soviet
 and Taiwanese military forces.

 We believe the DAO's effectiveness can be attributed
 to Defense Attache Zhang Wutang's vigor and intelli-
 gence and the unit's cohesiveness and relative freedom
 of action. Zhang has been highly successful in setting
 an example for his staff in interaction with Ameri-
 cans, according to US military officers. Assigned in
 August 1983, he has impressed US Government and
 military officials with his knowledge of world affairs,
 weapons technology, and military strategy and histo-
 ry. They say that he is open and willing to express
 opinions on most subjects-although he generally
 does not deviate from the official line-and that he
 stands in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Xu Yimin,
 The DAO functions as a well-disciplined military unit
 with a single chain of command. Unlike the Commer-
 cial and Science and Technology Sections, with their
 variegated membership, the DAO operates under
 orders from PLA headquarters in Beijing and is thus
 highly responsive to its consumers' needs.'
 Zhang keeps Ambassador Han abreast of the office's
 activities, US military officers say it is often only as a
 matter of record. They add, however, that Zhang's
 ability to interact with his colleagues has kept the
 Embassy's civilian officials from extensive infighting
 over the DAO's independence.
