 Return of USSR to  N Security Council. Probably reflcts
 Soviet decision to attain eventual negotiated settlement
 of the Korean war
 The return of the USSR to the UN Security Council
 probably reflects a Soviet decision to attain on the best pos-
 sible terms an eventual, but not necessarily early, negotiated
 settlement of the Korean war,  The USSR may well estimate that
 North Korea faces ultimate defeat by the US and the UN and that
 a more advantageous compromise ,settlement can be obtained
 during the period of North Korean military successes,  The Kremlin
 has, since the beginning of the Korean conflict, very carefully
 avoided any formal involvement of either the USSR or its Satellites
 which might stand in the way of a negotiated solution.  In the
 past the USSR has eventually withdrawn from positions (Iran,
 Greece, Berlin) when faced with sufficient Western strength and
 determination.  Furthermore, the Kremlin may well be concerned
 with the coalescing of the non-Soviet world behind the US through
 the UN and the partial mobilization of American industry and man-
 power,
 By returning to the Security Council, the USSR can
 and will, through use of the veto, deter this organ from
 adopting any resolution signifying an intention to go beyond
 the 38th parallel in order to unify Korea and/or to punish
 North Korean aggression.  It is unlikely, however, that the USSR,
 even if it plans an aggressive move in another area in the near
 future, is reentering the Security Council with any real hope
 that its veto power alone would keep the US from taking such
 action as it doomed necessary against now aggression.  The US
 and other members of the UN can, under Article 51 of the UN Charter
 which relates to self defense, act against it,

 Minimum Soviet terms for a compromise solution of the
 problem of Korea will probably not be forthcoming as long as
 North Korean military successes continue.  Initially, the USSR
 may Hake any peaceful solution contingent on a proposal to with
 draw UN military forces and to hold early all-Korean elections
 undor'UN supervision.  The Kromlin may believe that these elec-
 tions, following North Korean military successes, even if a North
 Korean withdrawal to the 38th parallel ensues, would result in
 either ,immediate or early Communist control of Korea.. While the
 USSR may attempt to make any Korean settlement contingent on the
 entry of Communist China into the UN, defeat on this issue is
 extremely unlikely to cause a resumption of the Soviet boycott
 of the Security Council,  If the'Soviet Union fails in its attempt
 to have early elections in Korea, it will probably devote its
 primary UN efforts to protection of the 38th parallel and the
 North Korean regime,  (SECRET)

 a_  mirrored i  recent SED Consross
 The speeches and decisions of the recent SED (Socialist
 Unity Party) Congress reveal no basic change in Soviet tactics in
 Germany.  They indicate, however, an intensification and accelera-
 tion of the tactics the USSR has pursued in Germany since the
 formation of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) - consolidation
 of Communist-powor in the GDR, integration of the GDR into the
 Soviet orbit, and constant pressure on West Germany.
 The attitude of the Congress toward the German Federal
 Republic (GFR) and the Western Occupation Powers was extremely
 hostile and belligerent.  Loading East German officials frankly
 and openly announced that the Communists. would perform acts de-
 signed to cause unrest in West Germany.  They urged West Germans
 to resist Allied Occupation preparations for Western defense, and
 called on all Germans, including ex-Nazis, to join the "National
 Front in erdor'to overthrow the Bonn Government and expel the
 Western Powers,"  West Germans wore told that they were not

 legally obligated to obey the Western Occupation Powers because
 the Western Powers had forfeited their right to remain in
 Germany through violation of the Potsdam Agreement.  In order to
 give more skillful direction to the Communist effort to gain
 influence in West Germany, the Congress transferred primary res-
 ponsibility for the "struggla for peace" in the German Federal
 Republic from the ineffectual KPD (West German Communist Party)
 to the SED.
 The Congress displayed no lack of confidence in the
 ultimate establishment of a united Germany under Communist
 control.  President Piock claimed that discontent was growing
 among the masses in West Germany as a result of Western Occupa-
 tion policy, and that an eventual "eruption" was "certain."
 Deputy Premier Ulbricht, in discussing the merch.nt fleet the
 GDR will build as a part of its Five-Year Plan, stated that
 East Germany would not establish a port on the Baltic coast as
 the "time will come when Hamburg and Lubeck (West German ports)
 will be at the disposal of the GDR."  For the present, according
 to Ulbricht, the GDR, by agreement with Poland, will use part
 of Stettin.
 The organizational changos in the Sod, which ware
 announced at the Congress, are additional steps in the consoli-
 dation of Communist power in East Germany.  The now party
 statute, eliminating a former provision that office holders be
 selected on a one for one basis from Communist and Socialist
 s=ks, abandons all pretense of equality between the two parties
 composing the SED.  In contrast to the former SED Executive
 Committee, which consisted of an equal number of forror Con-
 munists and Socialists, Communist officials hold a substantial
 majority in the new SED Central Commiittee.  The now party
 statute, which closely patterns that of the USSR Communist
 Party, stator clearly that the party aim is the trostablishment
 of the political power of the workers."  East Gorman Deputy
 Premier Ulbricht, the now secretary-general of the SED, expressed
 the desire of the-GDR to enter the Economic Council for Mutual
 Assistance (CIIqi),, the so-called Soviet counterpart to the
 Marshall Plan.  Entry of East Germany into this organization will

 Soviet tacticsin Iran combine official friendliness
 andrevoluti on    ae is Lo. subversive  ,r coups
 The Soviet Ambassador in Tehran has recently dis-
 played marked friendliness to the Iranian Goverment and to
 American officials.  On 24 July the Soviet llribassador called on
 the Iranian Prime Minister to state, on behalf of his government}
 that the USSR. was most anxious to be of any assistance possible
 to Iran and to resume normal trade relations.  The Ambassador'had
 not previously paid a courtesy call on the head of the new govern-
 mont end, according to the Prime Minister, the Soviet Ambassador,
 Tthad not called on any Prime Minister of Iran for as long as
 anybody can remember."  The now US Ambassador in Tehran and Mrs.
 Grady have boon shown almost ostentatious cordiality by the
 Soviet Ambassador and his wife.
 At the some time, however, the clandestine 4zorbaijan
 Democratic station, located in the USSR, has broadcastncreasing -
 ly revolutionary appeals to the Azerbaijani and especially to the
 Kurds, who are being told that "Kurdistan is one country and it
 should be liberated."  The clandestine radio has directly charged
 Iran with violating the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty (which permits
 Soviet troops to enter Iran under certain conditions) and alleges
 that the Kurds will rise up against the Govornrlont "if and when
 the Soviet Army enters Iran.tt
 Displaying friendliness on an official level, while
 at the some time strengthening local subversive organizations,
 is generally characteristic-of current Soviet tactics in the
 Near and Middle East.  Iran, however, has been subject to official
 Soviet pressure since May 1950.  This recent chow of friendliness
 may mean that the USSF?, is extending its ttpoaco campaign" to Iran.
 It may indicate Soviet satisfaction in the recent Iranian
 assurance, in answer to a Soviet note, that no Americans would be
 used in surveys near the Soviet border.  (In this connection, it

 in  ), nx~li--Soviet orbit trade
 The latest evidence indicating trade between Eastern
 Europe and Spain is contained in a detailed report of a compon.
 cation account for the export of Spanish goods to transit Sweden.
 Cor..uaodities valued at nearly 0l7.5 million each way are to be
 exchanged through an especially established Swedish firm which
 will servo as an intermediary.  Spanish agricultural, chemical
 and mineral exports will be balanced by the import of a million
 tons of Polish coal,
 The following.facts substantiate this transaction:
 (1) The USSR desires Spanish wolfror,m and pyrites, while Spain
 needs coal and wheat,  (2) Four thousand tons of-Polish coal.,
 said to be the first shipment under this account,, wore imported
 last March by Spin via Portugal..  (3) Both the  35 million
 figure and the existence of the Swedish firm have been previous-
 ly reported,  (4) Late in June the Swedish Charge dtAffairos in
 Madrid denied that the Swedish Government was officially in-,
 volved as an intermediary, but he acknowledged the existence of
 a deal between "Spanish entities and some foreign national, not
 Swedish, in Sweden."
 The persistence of reports regarding Spanish-Orbit
 trade negotiations indicates that Eastern Europonn trade with
 Spain through devious channels may be expected to develop further.
 Such trade is economically logical.  Each area has products which
 would require hard currencios if purchased elsewhere.

 Transportation and supply, in addition to political
 difficulties, will probably prevent Orbit-Spanish trade from
 reaching substantial proportions.  Moreover, it is not believed
 that Spain will be able to fulfill its obligations in a deal of
 such proportions, but regards the arrangement as a "hunting
 license" rather than a firm commitment.  Franco, however, is
 interested in any advantageous foreign trade and undoubtedly
 considers the threat of a Spanish-Soviet rapprochement a use-
 ful weapon in his campaign for US aid,                           (SECRET)

 11 western military attache in Sofia has recently
 reported that Bulgarian soldiers on the Yugoslav frontier have
 "good morale for any conflict with the Yugoslavs."  If true,
 the USSR has made marked progress in its campaign to inspire
 in Bulgarian troops the will to fight an aggressive action and
 counteract somewhat widespread disaffection in Bulgaria.  Such
 results, although not confirmod, would increase military and
 civilian potentialities of Bulgaria as a tool of Soviet-
 inspired aggression.
 I,arge shipments of Soviet equipment and supplies
 into Bulgaria during the past few months probably have improved
 morale of the army.  The widespread purge of Bulgarian array
 officers, which began in 1946 and continued with varying in-
 tensity until the removal of the chief of staff and his
 assist=ants in 1949, doubtless weakened both the noralo  and
 efficiency of the than poorly equipped army.   Sovietization of

 It is likely that the advisors have boon well chosen by the
 Kronlin to tighten discipline and increase military efficiency.
 Such improvement in performance of Bulgarian units might tend
 to boost soldier morale and perhaps even offset resentment
 created by Soviet domination.
 The desire to become a large and powerful nation has
 boon an historic Bulgarian objective.  Successive defeats in
 war since the end of the nineteenth century have progressively
 whittled away the coveted territory in Macedonia which Bulgarian
 troops have several times occupied.  A concerted Soviet propa-
 ganda conpaign designed to convince Bulgarians that they are in
 inminont danger of attack from neighboring countries who how
 hold this coveted territory has boon stopped up.
 During the past few months there is some evidence
 that the USSR has also tried to bolster Bulgarian civilian
 morale?  Since May two joint decrees of the Central Corimittoo
 of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers
 havo hold forth the hope that the collectivization drive would
 be ohised and distribution of consnor goods to the people would
 be oxpoditod.  There is no'possibility that such announced
 intentions-are sincere?  Even a short-torn surcoaso from Soviet
 oppression, however., would probably have a popular reaction.
 It would thus appear that the Kremlin is making
 efforts to strengthen the military and civilian morale in
 Bulgaxia, which., if successful, would increase the Bulgarian
 war potential,  (SECRET)

 The final major stop nocossary to complete the

 taken with the recent introduction of a bill in the Polish
 Sojm (Legislature) to establish and define the functions of a

 Justice), and operates on the same level as does the executive.

 the laws by all ministries and institutions subordinate to
 then, and has greater supervisory authority than does the Supreme

 the proposal, agreed unanimously that it was unacceptable, and,
 professing lack of authority to sign it or even discuss it with
 state roprosontativos, suggested that the Government submit it
 directly to the Vatican.  The substance of the agreement is un.-

 primarily to confuso the oppononts'of communism and to deprive
 the Government, as far as possible, of an excuse for repressive
 action.  The Party actually will abandon its violent tactics

 the Partyfs strength, there is no reason to believe that this
 successful tactic will be dropped.
 It is noteworthy that the CPI's new tactic follows
 almost exactly the instructions for colonial areas carried in
 the Corrinforn Journal of 27 January 1950; and that the Resolution
 embodying the now tactic includes an abject apology, addressed
 directly to Mao Tse-tung, for "utterly wrong, irresponsible,
 and slanderous criticism made against hies by the former Politburo"
 of the CPI?  On both those counts, the CPI's now tactic boars
 witness to'the solidarity of international communism as a
 world-wide, Moscow-dirocted movement.
 If this now tactic is conscientiously adhered to and
 if factional strife within the Party can be successfully sup-
 pressed, it is believed that the CPI stands to make substantial
 gains both in-rural areas and among Indiats government officials,
 intellectuals, and white collar workers, many of whom are already
 predisposed toward a Marxist viewpoint.  (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Recent indications of a possible deterioration in
 Yugosl.aviaxs economic' situation point to the possibility that not
 only will the Yugoslav Government-have difficulty in meeting some
 of its export connitnonts'but may, through a continuation of its
 present economic policies, further reduce the already low standard
 of living of the Yugoslav people.  The significance of those
 developments to US interests is highlighted by the recognized
 importance of maintaining an independent Yugoslavia and developing
 the Titoist heresy among World Communists,
 The report by the Chairman of-the Economic Council
 of the Yugoslav Government, Boris Kidric, on the Economic Plan

 lation.
 Kidric stated that foreign exchange difficulties
 necessitated a revision of production goals in some light ire
 dustries with the result that production of consumer goods
 industries were not oxpanded according to plan and in some cases
 fell below last year' while basic industries and capital construc-
 tion received priority for raw materials and equipment. AtLothor
 factor having an adverse effect upon the living standards was the
 faulty distribution of moats and fats.
 There was no indication that conditions during the
 latter half of 1.950 would be improved.  Kidric stressed the
 fact that the country must direct efforts toward the basic
 branches (heavy industry) of the Five Year Plan and absolutely
 subordinate all other tasks to this one.   This will moan that
 investments in consunor goods industries will continue to be
 sacrificed for-hoavy industry so long as foreign exchange
 difficulties exist..
 In'addition'to the alleged requirements of heavy--
 industrial dovolopnent,, the Yugoslav Government lust face e

 ominous character.  In order to perfect Yugoslav defensive
 capabilities,, considorable oriphasis of necessity is placed on

 Yugoslaviats own efforts,,  Since Yugoslavia is not eligible for
 arms aid fron the'Wost and indeed appears reluctant., for
 political reason, to hake any open request for Western military
 assistance., the Tito Go'vornnent apparontly hopes to supplement
 its own inadequate military manufacturing facilities with pur?-`
 chases from "neutral" countries such as Sweden and Switzerland.

 With invostrnont priorities going to heavy industry

 A further deterioration in the standard of living
 will probably increase local discontent and weaken morale at a
 time when the Govornrient itself appears aware of the necessity
 of-augmonting its popular support.  Much of the Coninforra
 propaganda boomed at Yugoslavia is currently stressing the
 decline in the Yugoslav itandard of living, allegedly because
 of Western exploitation of the CountryTs resources and Tito 'to

 In addition, the Czechs still remain adanant regarding the

 The underlying reason for Czochoslovakiats concilia-
 tory attitude toward, and vigorous promotion of, non-Orbit

 imports, Orbit comritnents would not be fulfilled.  In addition
 the Czechs have probably realized that nationalized property
