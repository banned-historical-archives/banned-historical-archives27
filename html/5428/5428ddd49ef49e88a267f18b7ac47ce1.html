 MV1ORANDUM FOR:
 ecretary,   ecutive Committee
 FROM          :  Bruce C. Clarke, Jr.
 SUBJECT       :  Agency Long-Range Planning
 1.  Over the past several months, in response to Executive
 Committee (ExCom) guidance provided at the 11 April meeting, the NFAC
 has been developing a list of candidate critical long-range problems
 that the Agency will have to address over the next decade (Attachment 1).
 During the course of this activity it has become apparent that we are
 unaccustomed to thinking in the terms required for long-range planning.
 It is now obvious that the NFAC must take additional steps to fully
 develop an intelligence-driven, long-range problem set, and a mechanism
 for attacking them, before we can be of hel  to the DDS &T and the DDO i
 their own long-range planning efforts.
 2.  In order to get: this process started in the NFAC, I intend to
 take the following steps over the next several weeks:
 a.  I will meet with my office directors to review
 and discuss the problems that have been identified.
 Criteria must be developed for distilling the problem set
 to the most important problems and to examine approaches
 for the NFAC to use in our long-range planning.
 b.  The office directors will be asked to identify
 individuals in their offices for the purpose of assembling
 a small group in each office to refine the problem set.
 c.  With the assistance of my office directors, four
 to six individuals from these office working groups will
 be selected to form a core group for develo in  the NFAC
 planning process to continue this effort.:

 3.  Considerable attention also has been given to developing a
 flexible long-range collection strategy for attacking the large number
 and variety of intelligence problems that have been identified.  Con-
 tinuation of the Pilot Collection Program (PCP) approach would require
 that only a few problems be selected from the many facing the NFAC.  An
 alternate approach to the PCPs is presented in Attachment 2 which pro-          25,
 vides a more comprehensive concept of addressing our problems.  I be-
 lieve that this approach will be more cost-effective, and allow us more
 flexibility in the use of the Agency's limited resources.
 4.  Reports on our progress will be made to the ExCom over the next
 several months.  Once sufficient progress has been made in the NFAC on
 this effort, it would be of help to us if representatives from the D/O
 and D/SET would review our work and assist us in planning our course of
 action.  One or two individuals from each directorate would be suitable
 for this interaction.

 CANDIDATE LONG-RANGE Ih=IGENCE PROBLEMS    -
 SOVIET UNION
 *1.          Balance of Power.  The Soviet Union continues to increase the
 capabilities o     t eir strategic weapons systems and may, during the next
 decade, obtain offensive weapon superiority over the United States.  It
 is vital to assess what changes would take place'in the areas of Soviet

 *2.  Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception--the Effect on
 Intelligence Production.  We have long recognized that t e Soviet Union
 has expressed a basic policy wherein deception is a major goal in all
 military and political activities.  Many instances of deception applica-
 tions have been observed, although usually in isolated occurrences.  It
 can be anticipated, however, that the USSR has the capability to engage
 in widespread, organized, and comprehensive deception practices if they
 should decide that the advantages will offset the costs in terms of
 resource and program inefficienc`Tes.  Should this occur, the Intelligence
 Community needs to understand how and where intelligence production will
 be affected, and take steps to nullify the effects of deception activities
 if necessary.
 *3.  Indications and Warning.  Over the past several years, the
 Soviet Union has been able to greatly increase their knowledge of-the US
 Intelligence Community's collection. capabilities.  As a result of this
 recent knowledge, they will undoubtedly make a number of changes in
 operating procedures for both their offensive and defensive programs.
 The Intelligence Community needs to assess how these changes will affect
 our I&W ca abilities and what action needs to be taken to counter these
 changes.

 *6.  Future ii.lz      ystems.  Intelligence prod   ions of future
 Soviet military systems, especially for aerospace defense, are criti-
 cally important to US defense policymakers for their impact on SALT as
 well as on US weapon decisions.  Of particular concern are the tech-
 nological options open to the Soviets to improve their ability to
 counter the present and projected US low-altitude air-breathing missile
 threat and the time frame when relevant   stems may enter the inventory.
 7.  Applied Sciences and Emerging Technologies.  Present day
 physical and life sciences and emerging technologies can be expected to
 contribute to future civilian and military systems developments and
 perhaps form the basis for the-emergence of military and economic threats.
 Of particular concern are foreign, notably Soviet., science and technology
 policies, research capabilities and activities in the physical sciences
 and advanced technologies, as well as the transfer of technology to the
 USSR and its assimilation there.
 8.  Biological/Chemical Warfare.  Independent judgments are con-
 tinually being sought on a range of assessments on the current BW/GV
 threat to NATO and in a2 port of CW treaty negotiations
 *9.  Military Technology Developments.  Extremely important policy
 questions in US strategic posture hinge on. Soviet capabilities in ad-
 vanced technologies in a number of key areas such as:
 a.  Acoustic and non-acoustic technologies appli-
 cable to ASR' and their impact on future Soviet ASR' force
 capabilities.
 b.  Directed energy, including the pace, scope and
 direction of Soviet programs and likely availability dates
 of potential directed energy weapon systems.
 c.  Microelectronics and the application of this
 technology to military systems.  New Soviet weapon systems
 will depend on improvements in onboard electronics for
 their effectiveness.
 .d.  Advances in inertial guidance components are of
 particular relevance in understanding Soviet efforts to
 improve missile accuracy.  Such developments as maneuvering
 reentry vehicles and homing cruise missiles would further
 threaten the US land-based missile force.

 they are   king progress in improving their defenses
 against penetration at low altitudes.  Stile must monitor
 their activities over the next 5-10 years very closely to
 determine whether they can develop effective counter-
 measures to US weapons like the cruise missile.
 f.  Effectiveness of Soviet ABM and ASAT efforts may be
 curtailed somewhat by arms agreements, but the Soviets con-
 tinue to conduct RFD programs in these areas.  We must be able
 to assess the results of these programs which will incorporate
 higher forms of technology in future years.
 *10.  Soviet Reliance on Spacecraft and Their Vulnerabilities.
 The Soviets are expected to continue their emphasis on space with
 improv systems for intelli ence atherin  warning and weapons sup-
 port.
 11.  The general area relating to Soviet science policy (as opposed
 to analysis of specific SF,T disciplines or areas) that governs current
 and will govern future performance of Soviet SF1T, including military
 research and development will continue to be of major concern.  The per-
 formance of the Soviet S&T community is a major key to USSR's policy and
 capabilities because its leadership heavily depends on that performance
 for the implementation of its policies at.home and abroad.  The future
 performance of that community (including military RFD and production)
 will be specifically affected by a number of developing systemic and
 societal problems such as:  the impact of increasing, already-pervasive
 Party rule on the SF~T community; the changing composition of the nation-
 alities and the growing social stratification with their impact on the
 training, utilization and attitudes of future Soviet S$T personnel; the
 growing complexity of inter-elite group relations (e.g., between the S&T
 community on the one hand, and the Soviet military, governmental bureau-
 cracy, and the Party apparatus on the other); the demographic changes
 with the resulting implications of upcoming labor shortages; the effect
 of looming generational changes on the Soviet S&T hierarchy and ranks;
 the problem of misemployment of Soviet S&T personnel; organizational
 problems related to interactions among the Academy of Sciences, the
 ministries, the State Committee for Science and Technology, and Gosplan.

 Science, the Ministry of Health and the military medical academies with
 regard to research and development, development of health care delivery
 systems and health and environmental regulations.
 12.  Soviet dependence on foreign (and particularly US) science and
 technology will be a key issue during the next decade.  Analysis of this
 question would further illuminate the amount and kind of possible lev-
 erage the US might have in influencing Soviet internal and external              25
 policies and developments affecting US national interests and security.
 Such an analysis could also contribut  to our assessment of current and
 future Soviet military capabilities.
 *13.  Domestic Stability.  The Brezhnev regime may very well have
 mortgaged future for current stability in the political, social, and
 cultural spheres by striving generally to preserve the status quo,
 pursuing a nondisruptive incremental.ism to achieve modest improvements,
 and avoiding the really hard issues. While the prospects for continued
 stability in the short run (3-5 years) are relatively good, in the long
 term the cumulative effects of two decades of conservatism will be felt
 in several areas that are key to the regime's stability.  The most
 salient of these areas, which will require close monitoring through
 intensified collection and analytical efforts, are the following:
 a.  A generational change in the Soviet political
 elite, that could result in a regime more dynamic, aggres-
 sive, and possibly threatening to Western interests;
 b.  Severe economic resource strains, exacerbated by
 growing consumer expectations, that will require adjust-
 ments in economic, military and foreign policy priorities;
 c.  Worsening demographic trends that could result in
 social and labor dislocations, intensification of national-
 ist antagonisms, and military discipline problems; and

 *2.        Missile and Space Programs.  China's missile and space pro-
 grams have been limping along for anumber of years.  However, there
 are recent signs of increased activity in both areas. We expect the
 quality and quantity of these systems to reach threatening levels over
 the next decade.
 3.         Science and Technology Policies, Strategies and Developments.
 Policy and strategy may be determinants of long-range trends in China's
 technological development.  S&T developments, including the assimilation
 of both indigenous and imported technology derived from both the physical
 and life sciences, will provide the base for the modernization of China's
 industry and the military.
 4.  Domestic Stability.  The PRC's record for preserving political..
 stability is not one which encourages predictions of long-term tran-
 quility.                 The death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the ensuing purge of his
 radical supporters, however, have brought about a major change in the
 character of domestic politics in China.  The new leadership, though
 still itself divided over several fundamental issues, is firmly com-
 mitted to setting China on a course of stable economic growth and pros-
 perity and has vowed to abandon the kind of mass mobilization campaigns
 that so disrupted political and economic routines in the past.  To pre-
 serve their rather fragile political unity, however, the leadership has
 tended to avoid the most difficult policy decisions and postpone making
 a clean and complete break with the past.  While this probably has been
 necessary to avoid a serious collapse of authority, it has heightened
 tensions within the leadership itself, and hobbled the bureaucracy in
 dealing with the accumulated problems of 20 years of Mao's misrule.
 Wile it is unlikely that the political infighting that still character-
 izes the regime will lead to widespread instability in the short term
 (3-5 years), it will continue to have a negative effect on the regime's
 ability to deal effectively with the more serious problems confronting
 it.  These problems, which merit increased collection and analytical
 efforts, include'the following:
 a.  The grooming and promotion of capable, young
 leaders to replace the current gerontocracy;
 b.  The continued alienation of many young people
 and intellectuals, angered over past treatment and pes
 simistic about the current government's ability to deal
 with China's problems;
 c.  The continuation of serious economic problems, com
 pounded by a weak infrastructure, insufficient planning,
 bureaucratic inertia, =inept management and rising consumer
 expectations;

 related to the biomedical. sciences continue to be of great interest to a

 tions of operations in space; implications of the radiobiological
 effects of devices emitting radiation; impact of advanced biological
 techniques (e.g., recombinant DNA) on industry; agriculture, medicine
 and. possibly military capabilities; the extent and nature of biomedical
 support for military operations and civil defense; and to population

 *7.  Monitoring of Social Change and Political Stability of Foreign
 Countries.  Cross-cultural indicators of social changes need to be iden-
 tified s- that the relationships between social change and political
 stability can be developed.  Methodologies are needed that address the
 questions of change and stability.  At this point, it is not known what
 social changes really are or how they can. best be measured.  The ideal
 program would be one that resulted in a model of relevant factors associ-
 ated with social change.  This model would be based upon valid empirical
 indicators which could be easily-updated by the analyst, and would            25X

 COLLECTION AND PRODUCTION PL.   NG
 PURPOSE
 To develop an approach to long-range planning which is comprehen-
 sive in.terms of the collection and production of intelligence, and
 emphasizes efficient use of resources.  17
 SUbMARY
 25X1
 -  The PCP approach, by its very nature, requires that a few problems
 be selected from the many facing NFAC.  Limited collection resources are
 then focused on those selected problems, if not to the exclusion of the
 remaining problems, at least to their detriment.  Such an approach is
 good, if a few problems stand out as being far and away critically more
 important and of greater interest than all the others.  This does not
 appear to be the case.  Of the 35 problems identified, we are hard-
 pressed to select a few which affect national security, or even national
 interest, to a markedly greater extent than the others. This indicates
 that a collection strategy needs to be developed and implemented for  -
 attacking as many different problems as possible.  By first identifying
 the intelligence problems which will confront us in the future, then
 defining overall collection strategies, and finally developing collec-
 tion assets which can satisfy data. requirements for many of the future
 problems, it will not be necessary or appropriate to artificially limit         25
 our attention to a small fraction of our future needs.  A broad, compre-
 hensive planning approach is recommended in this paper that will be more
 cost effective than the continued use of the PCP approach.

 work on long-range planning for production and analysis.  The
 main task would be to develop a realistic intelligence "future"
 to be used to derive an intelligence-driven, long-range problem         25,
 set.  Once completed, it can be used as guidance for formulat-
 ing the Agency's long-range plans for production and administra-
 tion as well as human and technical collection.
 --The ExCom approve and support the development of a flexible
 long-range collection strategy that:
 is based upon the knowledge gained over the past
 four years from using the PCP approach;
 is capable of attacking a nz ber of intelligence
 problems simultaneously;

 assets; and

 . can be developed within the limited resources that
 the Agency will have during the next decade.
 DISCUSSION
 The primary approach to solving critical intelligence problems has
 been to focus high-level attention on them and to apply more resources.
 The PCP approach is a current example of using this technique for prob-
 __lem solving... It has served to:
 define and describe these intelligence problems;
 ? perform detailed target analysis.to determine
 possible vulnerabilities to collection;
 ? encourage and support new collection initiatives;
 ? fine tune existing analysis and collection tech-
 niques; and ? assure adequate management attention.
 Several factors become evident while reviewing the report written
 by the ExCom Staff on the effectiveness of this approach against the two
 current PCP problems.

 few highest priority problems requiring these particular
 kinds of collection can be handled simultaneously.  Since
 the senior staff of the NFAC identified more than a dozen
 Soviet problems they believed needed the attention of
 senior Agency management to solve, it is readily apparent
 the Agency needs to develop a long range collection
 strategy that is capable of:

 (1) attacking a number of problems simultaneously;
 (2) making the maximum use of assets; both those
 that presently exist and those that are cur-
 rently under development; and
 (3) being implemented within the limited resources
 that the Agency will have during the next decade.
 c.  Not all problems lend themselves to being
 attacked by the PCP approach.  Unless other methods of
 attacking them are developed, the needed intelligence
 may never be collected.  The problem sets need to be
 studied to develop collection strategies that address
 most, if not all, of the problems.  Critical problems for
 which potential solutions cannot be found may need special
 treatment.
 d.   It probabl  takes about five ears for a PCP
 effort to pay off.
 25X1
 Thus there
 is no apparent time advantage to concentrating resources
 on a specific target if other collection approaches
 with much broader capabilities could be developed in the
 same length of time.
 These limitations need to be taken into account when consideration
 is being given to developing methods to attack critical, long-term
 intelligence problems.  It is clear that the Agency does not have the
 resources to attack more than one additional Soviet problem using the
 PCP approach.  Yet a number of high-priority Soviet problems have been
 identified that need to be addressed by the Agency during the next dec-
 ade.             The only reasonable solution is for the Agency to develop and
 implement a flexible long-range collection strategy for attacking the
 number and variety of intelli ence problems that have been and will
 continue to be identified.
 The NFAC must take the lead in beginning the planning cycle which
 will ultimately lead to the Agency being in the best possible position
 to answer critical intelligence questions.  Steps that should be taken
 are the development of:
 a realistic intelligence "future," derived
 from data provided by NFAC offices and pre-
 sented in a manner conducive to RFD and
 resource planning;
