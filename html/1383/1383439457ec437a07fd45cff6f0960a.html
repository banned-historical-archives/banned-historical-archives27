 Senator Proxmire.             The Subcommittee will come to order.
 Admiral Turner,   we are very pleased that you are with
 us this morning to make what has become an annual presentation
 of the intelligence community's views of the allocation of resources
 in the Soviet Union and China.
 As you know, we are anxious to have a full discussion
 of the substantive issues so that we might better understand
 economic developments in the two largest communist countries.
 We are also anxious to make this information available to the
 rest of Congress and the public as,quickly as possible.
 In the past, we have tried to publish the proceedings
 as soon after the transcripts have been sanitized as we could.
 We have done this, but it has taken several months from the
 date of the initial presentation.
 This year,  in addition to publishing the full hearings,
 we would like to be able to make public the dialogue between
 you and the committee, and perhaps also a summary of the
 presentation.   Of course, these excerpts would have to be
 declassified.
 Do you think this can be done so that we can make
 public at least portions of this hearing within the next
 two or three weeks?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir.
 Senator Proxmire.   Very good.   That would be very helpful.
 Senator Hatch, do you have a statement?

 STATEMENT OF ADMIRAL STANSFIELD TURNER,
 DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
 Admiral Turner.   Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.
 I am pleased to be here.   I understand that the CIA
 has been coming up here for several years to give this
 kind of assessment and providing the Committee with economic
 studies for 15 years.   In addition, we have and will continue
 to provide you with reports from time to time, as they become
 available.   As I mentioned to you. personally, I feel that is a
 responsibility which we should continue and we should increase
 the amount of information that is made available to the public.
 We would like this morning to discuss the Soviet economy
 and its prospects along with the defense sector.   We will pro-
 ceed from there to the Chinese economy and its defense sector.
 I will be assisted by Dr.  Sayre Stevens on my right,
 who is the Deputy Director for Intelligence at the Central
 Intelligence Agency.
 (Slide GNP Growth)
 Admiral Turner.   Our review of the Soviet economy is a
 particularly significant one for this year because we have
 taken a look at the long-term prospects.   It has been about
 five years since we have taken this kind of perspective,  and
 we have come up with what Ithink. are some important and
 different conclusions about the Soviet economy and its long-
 term outlook.

 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165AQg0500140002-3
 We have studied this and restudied it.   We have called in
 outside economic experts and we think we are on the right
 track.   We will be interested in your responses this morning,  sir.
 We think the Soviet Union is entering into a period
 of reduced growth potential, due first to bottlenecks in key
 commodities, especially crude oil., but also to a near certain
 contraction in the growth of their supply of labor.
 The basic problem is that the formula for maintaining
 their level of growth over the past 25 years, which has
 been to increase the inputs of labor and capital to make up
 for the inefficiency in the way they utilize them, does not
 appear to us to have long-term prospects.   They are not going
 to be able to continue to do this over the next ten years or
 Up to 30 percent of their Gross National Product currently
 goes into capital investment.
 As a result, we think Moscow is going to be confronted
 with some very difficult policy decisions, especially involving
 energy use,  imports from the West, relations with Eastern
 Europe, and the size of their armed forces.
 We think their policy options are limited, and we also
 note that the responses which they are going to have to make
 are likely to be complicated by the fact that when all these
 economic problems come to the fore, they well may be facing a
 change in political leadership and all of the uncertainties of
 a post-Brezhnev era.

 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165AQD0500140002-3
 Admiral Turner.   Let me now go on in some greater detail
 as to why I anticipate this slow-down in Soviet economic
 growth.
 I would start by saying   that first, things have not :been
 going well for the Soviet economy recently.
 As shown on the left, GNP growth has been declining,
 from an average of about 5 percent in the 1960's to about 3.7
 percent in this decade.
 In 1976,  industrial growth, as shown on the center bar there,
 was the slowest since World War II.
 Finally, on the agricultural side, you can see what a. had
 five years they had before 1976.   It was in 1976 that they
 really had a good year.
 (Slide--Working Age Population)
 The second factor working against them in the long run
 which I mentioned previously is the expected sharp drop in
 the rate of growth of the labor force, beginning in the late
 1970's. This derives from a decline in the birthrate in the
 1960's. It has already been reflected in a decline in the
 number of new entrants into the labor force, but, as this graph
 shows,  it will become much more acute by the early 1980's.
 The working age population by then will grow less than
 1/2 percent annually, compared with about 1.8 percent during
 the 1970's to date.

 Approved For Rele  a 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165AO0000140002-3
 A further complication is that those additions which
 will be taking place to the labor force during this period
 will come largely from the ethnic minorities from Central Asia,
 who do not readily move to the labor short northern industrial
 areas.   They are not people who want to be displaced.
 (Slide--Average Annual Rate of Growth in GNP)
 Admiral Turner.   Productivity gains in the Soviet Union
 have been slowing for years, and in addition, there are new
 problems today which are likely to depress productivity further.
 The left-hand series of bars here are the Gross National
 Product that we saw before, but added to it is the Soviet pro-
 jection in their five year plan of a 5 percent growth over the
 next five years.
 The interesting point is that the middle bars show the
 rate of growth of the inputs of capital and labor combined
 and you can see that they themselves predict a drop in the
 rate of growth in their five year program.   Yet, the last bars,
 which show the combined productivity of these factors,  indicate
 that they expect an unrealistic increase in productivity.
 In short, even allowing for the fact that 1971-1975 in-
 cluded some bad agricultural years, what they are expecting
 over the next five years is more than they achieved even in the
 1950's.   We don't think they are likely to be able to achieve
 this productivity with those inputs of labor and capital.

 Approved For FJease 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80MOO1654P00500140002-3
 Let me elaborate on some of the reasons for that.
 The first is that the fuels and raw materials which
 they are going to have to draw upon in the next decade are
 simply getting more expensive.                They have to go further east
 of the Urals to get them.
 Another is that the Soviet economy is simply becoming
 larger and more complex and the mechanisms which they have for
 centralized control of it are becoming less and less adequate
 to the task.
 Third is that in adding to plant and equipment, they have
 to move into more technologically sophisticated areas and it
 is more expensive to do so.
 Perhaps most importantly is the looming oil shortages,
 which, as you know, we have discussed in another report which
 we sent out on an unclassified basis not too long ago.
 If I may,  I would like to elaborate on that because it is central
 to our overall analysis here.
 (Slide ---Soviet Oil Production)
 Admiral Turner.   This is our prediction of Soviet crude
 oil production which,    as you can see,  is on a steep rise at
 this point.   We expect it to peak in the early 1980's and then
 to decline.
 The reasons for this are first that the Soviets today are
 emphasizing current production, rather than development and
 exploration.   They are not discovering new oil reserves as
 rapidly as they are depleting them.

 Approved For Rjeease 20Q41  14SS MA   P80M0016   ?005001400024
 Secondly, while last year they produced 10.4 million
 barrels of oil per day--and we think this is close to their
 estimated maximum potential of 11 million to 12 million barrels
 a day--we still expect that they are going to fall to between 8
 and 10 million b/d by 1985,         in large measure because the pro-
 duction technique that is keeping their production high today is
 a water flooding method which pushes the oil out, and that, over
 time,  simply leads to seepage with the end result that a very
 large amount of fluid has to be pumped out to get a given amount
 of oil.
 Senator Hatch.   Admiral, that is still quite a bit of oil
 per day, though,  isn't it?
 Admiral Turner.  Yes.
 Senator Hatch.   Isn't that a little bit more than ours?
 How many million barrels of oil a day do we get?
 Admiral Turner.  We consume about 18 million barrels of
 oil a day.
 Senator Hatch.  But we produce about 8 million of those,
 don't we?
 Dr.  Stevens.   We produce about 8 million.
 Senator Hatch.   So actually, we are producing less
 oil today than the Russians with our much more highly mechanized
 society.
 Admiral Turner.   There is no question about that.

 comparison so that I would have the right perspective.
 Admiral Turner.   In 1976,  the Soviets were the largest
 oil producer in the world in millions of barrels of oil per
 day,   slightly more than the Saudi Arabians.
 Senator Hatch.   I don't think a lot of people realize
 By 1985, you expect them to be down to about 8 million
 barrels of oil a day?
 Admiral Turner.   8 million to 10 million by 1985, and
 I will detail why I think that is going to have some
 severe impact on them, even though it is nonetheless a large
 amount of oil.
 Senator Hatch.   Are they getting most of their oil east
 of the Urals?
 Admiral Turner.   They are getting most of their oil
 west of the Urals.     They are still tapping those fields,  and
 also a very giant field east of the Urals called Samotlor in
 Western Siberia.
 They are still tapping the Urals-Volga area but it is
 running down, and they are having to move progressively
 further east.
 The giant Samotlor field we think will peak in about
 a year or two,  largely because of the use of water flooding.
 They will have to go to either off-shore areas in the north

 or further out into Siberia, or hope to find extensive new
 fields in the Samotlor region.  But even in the Samotlor
 area, they are in an inhospitable climate, and transportation
 problems are going to grow as they move north and east.
 Senator Hatch.   How much of this oil do they use per
 day?
 Admiral Turner.  They exported nearly 3 million barrels
 a day in 1976.
 Senator Hatch.   Do they utilize the rest or do they
 conserve and save it?
 Mr. Diamond.   No.  They are utilizing everything else.
 Admiral Turner.  An interesting aspect of this is that
 as they use more and more water flooding, they get more and
 more water out per barrel of oil.   They are very dependent
 upon high-speed, high-capacity submersible pumps, which at
 this time they obtain only from the United States.
 Now in the mid-1980s,  they will surely look at ways to
 find alternative energy sources:   coal, water power, gas,  and
 so on.   But again, most of these resources lie east of the
 Urals and it is going to take heavy capital investment and high
 transportation costs to exploit those.
 Senator Proxmire.   What you said is that all of this oi]_
 is being used by the communist nations, by the Soviet Union and
 the Communist Bloc nations.

 Admiral Turner.   No.   All but about 1.3 million barrels
 a day.
 Senator Proxmire.              You said that they export about 3
 million barrels a day in 1976, of which about 1 million went
 to Communist countries.      Where does the rest of it go?
 Mr.  Diamond.   About 300,000 barrels a day goes to soft
 currency noncommunist countries, and the balance of 1 million
 barrels a day goes to the hard currency western countries.
 Senator Proxmire.   So, that would mean,  if they are
 going to have the same amount of oil go to Communist Bloc
 countries, they would simply be unable to have the exchange
 they would need to buy from the West.
 They would not be able to meet their growth with additional
 oil,   the growth which you projected they would have.   In other
 words, you cannot say that they could get along with the amount
 of oil that they have now if that is their only energy source
 because they are growing, as you said.   The other communist
 countries are also growing,  so they would need more to take
 care of the needs of Russia and the needs of her satellite
 countries, and they won't have that additional means.
 Admiral Turner.  That is correct.   We have projected in
 our energy study that for 1976-80 there will :beabout 3.5 to
 4 percent annual increase in oil demand in the Soviet Union.
 That, plus continuing to supply the Eastern Europeans, who
 expect not the 1.4 million they got in 1976 but 1.6 million b/d

 by 1980,  is going to tax them,  let alone their being able to sell
 this other million barrels a day, which currently brings them
 about $4.5 billion of foreign exchange every year.
 So, what I am getting to is that they are going to be
 pressed either to meet their own domestic requirements for a
 growing economy, or to supply the Eastern Europeans as pro-
 jected, or to get the hard currency exchange to buy technology
 and other goods from the West.
 They have a crunch in one of those three areas.   We
 don't know how to predict which way they will respond to
 those crunches, but we think each one has a very interesting
 and significant aspect, not only from the Soviet point of
 view, but from ours and that of the entire Western World.
 Senator Hatch.   I don't mean to keep interrupting you,
 but the water flooding approach that you have indicated
 really results in leaving a lot of the oil in the ground.
 Admiral Turner.  Yes.
 Senator Hatch.   Are they coming up with sophisticated
 means of secondary recovery of oil over there?
 Admiral Turner.  They are talking about new means of
 secondary and tertiary recovery.
 Senator Hatch. Are we cooperating in helping them
 to create secondary recovery measures?
 Admiral Turner.   There are several technical agreements
 between the Soviets and US oil firms for cooperation in enhanced
 recovery operations.

 Mr.  Diamond.   We are selling them a lot of equipment.
 This fall they are planning to sign contracts for US equipment-
 to start a gas lift operation.   Instead of using water they
 will use gas pressure to recover oil.   In October contracts
 may be signed for $1 billion worth of US gas lift equipment.
 Unless they get access to that and to 1,000 submersible pumps
 for lifting fluid in other fields, we feel they won't be able to
 obtain the results shown in that production chart you saw
 earlier; we feel they will not be able to work out that scenario.
 We feel that as a minimum, they have to have access to US
 technology of this kind.
 Senator Hatch.   I see.   Have they tried nuclear methodology
 over there, to your knowledge?
 We tried it out in Colorado and it did not work very
 well.   I was wondering if they tried it with any success.
 Mr. Diamond.   The Soviets used nuclear detonation to
 improve oil yields at a field in the Urals-Volga region in the
 early 1970's.   Some success was claimed.
 Senator Hatch.   Okay.
 Again,  I am sorry to hold you up on this, but I think these
 are important questions.
 Have they made any great strides in alternative forms
 of energy,  such as fusion, nuclear fusion?
 Dr.  Stevens.   They have been very active in the develop-
 ment of a fusion program, but it is all very definitely in the
 development stage--really,  in the research stages.

 Senator Hatch.   So, they have not brought anything through
 to fruition, but they are working hard,  just as we are,  in
 this area?
 Dr.  Stevens.   Right.
 Senator Hatch.   There are no advantages to them in the
 alternative energy systems?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Not between now and the mid 1980's.
 We anticipate that     by.  1985,  2 percent of their total energy
 will come from nuclear sources.
 Senator Hatch.   Are they going ahead with their forms of
 breeder reactors?
 Admiral Turner.  Yes, they are.
 Senator Hatch.   They will definitely be able to capture
 that intensification of nuclear energy through the breeder
 system that-we are now apparently phasing out, or phasing
 down.
 Dr.  Stevens.   They have a small breeder reactor.   They
 are preparing to build a large one, but they are still in the
 stage of trying to investigate it.
 Senator Hatch.   They are not as far along as we are in
 Dr.  Stevens.   Oh, no, they are ahead of us.
 Senator Hatch.   They are ahead of us in breeders?

 Senator Hatch.  So, you are saying that at their peak,
 they hit 12 million barrels a day, and that is less than what
 they really need if they are going to continue to service the
 Eastern Bloc countries.   They may have to pull back the
 other 1,300,000 barrels a day from the West,  is that it?
 Admiral Turner.   (Nods affirmatively.)
 Mr. Diamond.   1,000,000 barrels to hard currency countries
 and 300,000 to soft currency countries.   They will pull that.
 back.
 Senator Hatch.    But that will still not solve their
 problems by the mid-1980's, will it?
 Admiral Turner.   No, and it will create other problems
 for them.
 Senator Hatch.  Oh,  sure.
 Admiral Turner.   These will be of considerable importance.
 Senator Hatch.   It means that they will have to have a
 terrific capital outlay to keep their industrial economy
 going by getting oil from either the Middle East or elsewhere,
 or they are going to have to put pressure on to acquire oil
 clandestinely.
 Admiral Turner.   Yes. We have observed in their country
 as in most others, that the rate of economic growth is roughly
 parallel to the rate of energy consumption growth.   They face
 this prospect.   We feel that they do not have the opportunities
 that the United States does to conserve energy.   Most of their

 vehicles are industrial/commercial vehicles.
 Senator Hatch.  So, what it really comes down to is the
 fact that the Middle East is going to be a hot center,
 irrespective of the Palestinian/Israeli/Arab various crises
 that already exist?
 Admiral Turner.   That is certainly true.   There are
 lots of reasons for that in this energy sphere, too.
 If the Soviets become a net importer of oil, which we
 think their demands will require--now we don't say that they
 will import oil, but we say that the combination of what we
 think they can produce--
 Senator Hatch.   If they want to grow, they are going to
 have to.
 Admiral Turner.   If they want to maintain a reasonable
 rate of growth and to service the Eastern Europeans,  and to
 earn hard currency, yes.   But, of course,  if they are going to
 import oil,  they will not be earning hard currency that they
 earn from exporting oil. They are in a real crunch here.
 As I was about to say, we don't think they can conserve
 as readily as can we, or even the Western Europeans.   They
 don't have as much automobile and vehicular consumption.   They
 only use 3 percent of their oil today for household consumption.
 Senator Hatch.   So, this will deter modernization
 throughout Russia and will keep them still almost a primitive
 society--comparatively speaking, of course.

 Admiral Turner.   That is certainly one of the conclusions
 as to the possibility from this whole briefing,  that is,  that
 a slowdown in their economy is forthcoming and this will be
 reflected in a reduced rate of growth.
 Senator Proxmire.   Admiral, we do want to give you a
 chance to present your whole statement.   Can you tell us
 how long it will take for you to present your. whole position,
 both on Russia and China,  if there are no interruptions?
 Senator Hatch's questions have been excellent and very
 helpful.   But I would like to know-this so that we can time
 the hearing properly.
 Admiral Turner.   I would think there is about another
 25 minutes of presentation,  sir.
 Senator Proxmire.   All right.   Suppose you go ahead with
 that, and then upon your conclusion we will each, in turn,
 question you.   We need to get a view of the picture as a
 whole.
 Senator Hatch.       I would hope, Mr. Chairman, that we
 might be able to ask you a quick question if we have one.
 Senator Proxmire.   Of course,  for purposes of clari-
 fication that would be fine.
 Senator Hatch.   Thank you.
 Senator Proxmire.   Go ahead, Admiral.
 Admiral Turner.   I think we have covered most of what I
 wanted to say on oil.

 We think they would then have to look, because they
 cannot do a lot of conservation, at whether they cut oil
 exports to the Eastern Europeans,  at whether there are other
 ways to find foreign exchange so that they can perhaps buy
 oil from outside.   We think that they can do something to
 increase their foreign exchange from non-oil exports, but that
 probably will be only about a 10 percent a year increase as the
 maximum, and this would not be enough to avoid an overall re-
 duction in their hard currency earnings.
 We think they could increase their gold sales, because
 their production of gold is going up.   On the other hand, they
 would meet a point of diminishing returns as the market price
 of gold will go down if they put too much on the market.
 We think they could try to sell more high-cost,  sophis-
 ticated armaments, as they have been doing.   But here again
 we are talking about a 10 percent growth rate, which would not
 be a sizeable addition to their foreign exchange.
 We think they are going to find it difficult to obtain
 oil from the Middle East by barter because they do not have
 that much to offer to people who have lots of hard currency
 available.   Their goods are simply not that competitive.  The
 Middle Eastern people would prefer to buy from the West in
 general.
 The Eastern European question is going to be a big one
 for them, and Moscow is going to have to carefully weigh the

 trade-offs of continued economic support to their satellites
 and their desire to use some of that oil for export for hard
 currency.   They may ask the Eastern Europeans to share some
 of the burden of their oil shortage, but this, of course,
 would make the Eastern European economic situation more
 difficult than it is today, and would possibly threaten the
 stability of the linkage between those people and the Soviet.
 Union.
 I will move now from oil to agriculture and that aspect.
 of the Soviet economy.
 Agriculture will, we believe, continue to be a major
 headache for the Soviets.   Soviet farm production has in-
 creased far above the level of a decade ago, but still cannot
 provide the quality diet that the Soviet population desires.
 The demand for meat is rising faster than production,
 placing a severe strain on the Soviet grain-livestock economy.
 Although much of the additional farm output reflects a
 massive infusion of investment and industrially produced goods,
 good luck with the weather has also been important.  For the last
 decade or so we believe the Soviets have enjoyed above-avera.ge
 weather conditions in their main grain producing   areas.
 According to the law of averages, they should have more below-
 average years sometime in the future.

 But,  even under favorable weather conditions, their
 imports of farm products have accelerated in recent years,
 and their program for dampening the sharp fluctuations in
 grain output by shifting production to lower risk weather
 areas has made farm products increasingly costly.
 Well, if the weather does turn against them to what
 would be a more normal condition, we expect they will con-
 tinue to have sizeable requirements for importing grain,
 in particular.
 Looking at the overall economic forecast, we must take
 into account the uncertainty in the future trends of the
 policy options available to the Soviets.   These are limited,
 but which ones they select will have an important effect on
 us as well as on themselves.
 If they can avoid these serious energy bottlenecks
 about which we have been talking,  they can probably achieve an
 overall economic growth rate of about 4 percent a year through
 1980,  and perhaps 3 percent during the first half of the 1980's.
 To do this,  there are several things that they may want
 and be able to do to try to maintain their growth rate near 3 1/2
 to 4 percent.
 (Slide--Annual Rate of Growth of Inputs to Economy)
 Admiral Turner.   This chart shows that the growth in sown
 acreage of the Soviet Union is going to remain about the same.
 We don't expect them to bring sizeable new land areas into
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165A000500140002-3
 Approved For Release 20041    ,'A  I   IRB80MO016500500140002-322
 production.   The chart also shows that their growth in avail-
 able man-hours, given the problem I mentioned before of declin-
 ing inputs of labor,  is going to decline.
 The same holds true for the capital stock, and that means
 that the combined growth of total inputs of stock of plant
 and equipment and labor will decline.
 The red lines indicate what they might do if they put in
 special measures.   The bottom red line is what we call a manpower
 program.   There are a number of actions which they could take.
 They could create additional incentives so that people do not
 retire as early.   While current incentives exist for workers
 to stay on the job after reaching retirement age, only one
 quarter of them do.   It would be possible to increase this
 number by raising financial incentives or by raising the relatively
 low retirement age.
 They could also change their educational policy.   They
 have a full secondary education program now and they could get
 people out into the labor market earlier by reducing the
 number who get a full secondary education.
 And, of course,  they could cut the armed forces if they
 felt it was mandatory to tap that sizeable pool of manpower.
 We don't think that these measures could have more than
 a one-time effect, as we show here,  to offset the decline
 in the additions to the labor force which we earlier described.

 In investment programs, they have a number of options.
 The principal ones relate to the defense field.   They could
 shift defense industrial capacity to production of invest-
 ment goods.   However,  as we all know, defense production is
 what the Soviets do best, and they might be reluctant to fore-
 sake that.   Also,  as we all know, resources that have been
 traditionally invested in defense are not as easily trans-
 ferable to civilian sectors as are some others.
 They could also in the investment program stretch out
 research and development and production schedules in defense
 oriented industries.   They could also try to improve their
 overall productivity by reforms of economic management.   But
 here,  as we are all aware, the centralized bureaucracy has its
 interests and there are also political and ideological factors
 involved as'to how far-reaching the reforms are they could
 make in the way they manage their economy.
 What we are saying, then,  is that in the middle line
 here,  even with a good, tough manpower program and with as
 much effort as they can make to arrest the lower rate of growth
 of investments,  the combination is not going to have, in our
 view,  a substantial impact over the next decade.
 Perhaps they could keep their economic rate of growth
 up to about 4 percnet, as I suggested, but then it looks to
 us as though at best it is going to be below 4 percent.

 On the other hand,  if they do not take these corrective
 measures, particularly with respect to their oil program, their
 economic growth may drop even lower, to 3 1/2 percent in the
 near term and to 2-2 1/2 percent in the first half of the 1980's.
 Let me emphasize that we are talking about average
 figures here.     Performance in some years could be better  or
 it could be worse.
 (Slide--Ability to Absorb Imports)
 Admiral Turner.   These economic problems awaiting the
 Soviet Union in the 1980's will strongly affect its relations
 with us and with the entire Western World.   Even under the
 most favorable assumptions we have displayed here for hard
 currency earnings,  including cutting their exports to Eastern
 Europe,  the Soviet Union will experience a hard currency
 squeeze in the early to mid-1980's.
 This chart shows their ability under two estimates to
 continue the rate of non-grain hard currency imports at a
 ratio of Gross National Product that they are doing today.
 It shows that we think it will have to fall below the current
 ratio at some time in the future.
 This may mean that the Soviet Union will turn to us in
 the next decade for substantial long-term credits, especially
 those needed to develop their oil and gas industries.   They
 need US technology, as I have indicated, to develop those
 industries,  and they may well need US credit with US
 Government guarantees to achieve that.

 Finally,  turning to the critical area of defense, a
 slowdown in economic growth is likely to trigger debate
 in Moscow over the future levels and patterns of military
 expenditures. Yet, as we all know, military programs have
 considerable momentum and powerful political and bureau-
 cratic support.
 We do expect defense spending to continue to increase
 during the next few years at something like the recent
 annual rates of 4 to 5 percent because of this built-in
 momentum.   However, as the economy slows, ways to reduce
 growth of defense expenditures should become increasingly
 urgent to major elements of the Soviet leadership.
 Internally,  the reduced growth potential means that
 the Soviet'consumer will fare poorly during the next five to
 ten years,  relative to his gains under the current leader-
 ship.   With the overall economic growth rates that we
 consider likely, per capita consumption could grow by no
 more than 2 to 2 1/2 percent a year, compared with about 3
 percent since 1965.
 As a result, we do not anticipate any closing of the
 gap in living standards with the West, or for that matter,
 even with Eastern Europe.

 We believe that on balance,  consumer pressures will
 remain manageable nonetheless, although worker incentives
 may be adversely affected.
 As Soviet leaders obtain a better perception of the
 resource problems ahead,  they will be led to consider policies
 rejected in the past as too contentious or lacking in urgency.
 Some might be persuaded that basic organizational and
 management reforms in industry are necessary, but that will
 raise the spectre that such reform would threaten political
 control.
 Consideration of other options,  such as accelerating
 investment at the expense of defense or consumption, or
 reducing the armed forces to enhance the civilian labor
 force, could also result in strong leadership disagreements.
 In concluding,  i would like to stress the vast uncertainty
 facing the Soviets and us as new leaders inevitably come for-
 ward in the 1980's to cope with these economic problems which
 we have been discussing.
 We will be watching these developments closely and we
 stand ready to support you, Mr. Chairman, and your committee
 in any way we can in this area.
 Now I would like to turn the floor over to Dr. Stevens
 to talk about Soviet defense costs,  if you would like,  sir.

 As you know,  the security that surrounds Soviet defense
 spending makes it very difficult for us to get very good
 figures on their spending.
 Moscow announces only one statistic, which is a single
 line entry for defense,  in the annual state budget.   There
 has never really been a successful method for determining
 precisely what activities they are covering with this budgetary
 figure.
 It serves a political purpose, and we have found it
 useless as an indicator of either the magnitude or the trend
 of defense spending in the Soviet Union.
 For example, the announced budget cuts since 1972 are
 simply incompatible with the growth in Soviet forces that
 we have seen take place.
 We estimate the costs of Soviet defense activities really
 by putting price tags on observed and estimated Soviet defense
 programs and then aggregating all of that information to deter-
 mine total figures.
 We estimate,  first of all,  the cost in rubles,  so that
 we can measure the impact of defense on the Soviet economy
 as a whole.   We can look at the economic considerations that
 affect Soviet defense planning, and finally, we can get-an
 idea of the relative priorities that the Soviets assign to

 We also estimate the costs in dollars to provide a
 simple comparison between the Soviet programs and US
 defense program.   Each year we completely review all of our
 data and we endeavor to improve the methodologies that we
 use and take into account any new information that we get in
 the course of the year so as to produce a new estimate.
 First of all,  I would like to review our current ruble
 estimate of Soviet defense spending.   This is, of course,
 particularly important because it sizes the defense burden
 that the Soviets feel in their economy as a whole.
 As you will recall, the ruble estimate we presented
 last year was substantially higher than our previous
 estimates.   The reasons for this change and its significance
 have been widely misunderstood. We raised our estimate because
 we discovered that in the past we had underestimated the prices
 of Soviet defense goods.   This was due primarily to lack of
 understanding of the price inflation in the USSR and a change
 in pricing policy that occurred in 1967, which led to the removal
 of what in the past had effectively been a subsidy on defense
 purchases.
 The increase in our ruble estimates did not represent a
 change in our estimate of Soviet defense activities or Soviet
 military capabilities.   It was really based upon these price
 discrepancies that we discovered.
 Senator Proxmire. I hesitate to interrupt, but I think
 this is so important.

 Are you saying that your estimate did not indicate a
 step-up in Soviet investment in resources in defense, but
 simply a reassessment of the prices, of the inflationary
 effect?
 Dr. Stevens.        The dramatic increase in the ruble costs
 of the Soviet program,    as we estimated it, was due primarily
 to this change in pricing.
 Senator Proxmire.   So,  it did not mean as much of an
 increase in resource allocation to defense as it seems?
 Mr.  Diamond.  That's right.
 Admiral Turner.   The percentage of their Gross ?National
 Product going to defense increased in our estimate not because
 their defense programs are larger than we thought, but because
 the efficiency of the defense sector of their industry is much
 less than we had believed.
 Senator Proxmire.   I see.
 Dr.  Stevens.   There was some growth in the hardware
 estimate, but it was small as compared to the change in the
 ruble estimate.
 This change did carry with it some important intelligence
 judgments,  and these, of course,  are reflected in this pricing
 change that we have identified.    The first, as Admiral Turner
 has pointed out,  is that the Soviets are far less efficient at
 producing defense goods than we had previously estimated them
 to be.   Of course,  it is clear that the impact of the defense

 Approved For tease 2004/OW 4 3G1  RDP80M0016SWO0500340002-3
 program on the economy is greater than we had previously
 estimated it to be.   All of this emphasizes the preparedness
 of the Soviet leadership to accept those burdens and it
 reflects their deep commitment to defense programs.
 The work that we have done in the past year in making
 that change has strengthened our confidence in the revisions
 that we made.   This year we find no big changes in either
 the overall magnitude of their program, as we see it in
 ruble terms, or in the trends that it is taking.
 (Slide - Soviet Defense Spending in Rubles)
 Dr. Stevens.   This chart shows the ruble estimate for
 the years 1970-76.    The blue band reflects our estimate in
 1970 rubles with "defense" defined according to the U.S.
 definition of what activities are in a defense program.   The
 width of the band represents the uncertainty that we have in
 making this estimate.   The red band above it reflects how the
 Soviets might view their defense costs if they do not look
 at the defense program in precisely the same terms as we in
 the United States look at ours.
 There are other costs,  for example, a number of space
 costs,  space program costs, which the Soviets might identify
 as being part of their defense programs.
 As you can see, using a definition which encompasses
 a range of activities comparable to those in the U.S.  defense

 Approved For Base 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M0016500500140002-3
 program, we estimate Soviet spending at some 40 to 45 billion
 rubles in 1970.   By 1976, the total outlays for these purposes
 had grown to somewhere between 52 and 57 billion rubles.   Using
 the broader definition, which I pointed out the Soviets might
 use,  that amount has risen from 45-50 billion in 1970 between
 57 and 62 billion rubles in 1976.
 I should point out again that these estimates are cal-
 culated in terms of 1970 ruble prices.   This use of a constant
 price base has a dual purpose.   First, using this basis enables
 us to reflect only real changes in-the level of Soviet military
 activities, rather than monetary changes which might result from
 price inflation.
 Secondly, our estimates on the Soviet economy as a whole
 and our estimates of its economic performance are calculated
 on the same basis,  that is, on the basis of constant 1970
 prices.   This enables us,  then,  to compare directly defense
 costs with other sectors of the Soviet economy.
 No single'measure adequately describes the economic impact
 of the Soviet defense effort.   Defense spending, as a share of
 Gross National Product, can of course be used for this purpose.
 Using the estimates that we have made,  the Soviet defense
 effort absorbs some 11 to 12 percent of the Soviet GNP.   if
 you were to base this on the broader definition of the defense
 program,  that share would rise to somewhere between 12 and 13
 percent.

 Because the rate of growth in defense spending and in
 GNP were roughly the same during 1970 to 1976,  there was
 little change over period in the share taken by defense.
 The percentage of machinery output allocated to defense
 is another economic aggregate of some importance.   You can use
 that to describe the impact of defense programs on the economy
 as a whole.   Soviet defense takes about a third of the output,
 of the machine-building and metal-working sector, and this,
 of course,  is the sector which produces investment goods as
 well as military weapons.             _
 A comparable figure in the United States in the post-
 Vietnam period is about 10 percent.   So, as you can see,
 there is a significant difference.
 The defense bite is also large in metallurgy, where it
 takes about one-fifth,  in chemicals, where it is about one-
 sixth, and in energy, where it also consumes about one-sixth
 of the total in those areas.
 Even these measurements tend to understate the impact on
 the Soviet economy because they fail to take into account
 qualitative considerations.   Most importantly, defense takes
 the lion's share of the high-grade scientific,  technical,
 and managerial talent that exists in the Soviet Union.   It
 similarly draws heavily on the output of scarce and high
 quality materials, components, and equipment that are pro-
 duced in the Soviet Union.

 As Admiral Turner mentioned earlier, we expect the long
 term growth in defense spending to continue into the 1980s at
 an annual rate of about 4 to 5 percent.   Programs for the
 next generation weapon systems are now under development.
 These new weapons will be more complex and more costly, and
 we simply do not see any indications that the Soviets are
 dismantling their defense research and development or industrial
 capacity to divert it to. other issues.   The Soviets, of course,
 have made a tremendous commitment to the development and to
 the maintenance of these capabilities.
 Let me now turn to the dollar estimates, for a more
 direct comparison with our defense program.
 Our estimates of the Soviet program in dollar cost terms
 are intended to provide a general appreciation of the magnitude
 of the program and the activities.   We developed these estimates
 on the basis of what it would cost in the United States to
 develop, procure, man, and operate a military force of the
 same size and with the same inventory of weapons as that
 fielded by the Soviets.
 We also incorporated what it would cost to operate that
 force as the Soviets operate it.
 The dollar costs that I am about to describe are expressed
 in 1975 prices.   A constant price is again used so that real
 changes in military forces are not masked by inflation.

 This year,  for the first time, our figures on U.S.
 spendings are in outlay terms, rather than in Total
 Obligational Authority.   Because we have priced the Soviet
 defense program effectively in outlay terms, we are getting
 a better comparison by making that change.  .
 Our indicators of the relative levels of U.S. and
 Soviet defense activities present basically the same picture
 which we have described to this committee in the past.
 (Slide - Dollar Cost Comparison-Total)
 Dr. Stevens.   As you can see from the chart, this is a
 dollar cost comparison for the 1966-1976 period as a whole.
 It is not shown on this chart, but the total costs of the two
 programs in dollar terms through this period are roughly
 equal.
 The estimated dollar costs of Soviet defense activities
 grew steadily over the period at an average rate of about
 3 percent, while U.S.  outlays declined after 1968 and from
 1972 on are lower than they were in 1966.
 As aresult,  the estimated dollar costs of Soviet defense
 activities exceeds the U.S. by a widening margin in every
 year after 1971,  and by 1976,  as you can see, they are about
 40 percent higher.
 If we add the costs of military retirement programs to
 both these estimates,  the Soviets still exceed the U.S. by
 about 30 percent.

 Finally, if costs for military personnel are subtracted
 from the basic estimates on both sides, then the estimated
 costs for the Soviet program are nearly 30 percent higher
 than in the United States.
 (Slide - Soviet-US Investment & Operating Costs)
 Dr.  Stevens.   For 1976,  the estimated dollar costs of
 Soviet programs exceed U.S. defense outlays in all major
 categories.
 In the case of investment, which includes procurement
 of new weapons, equipment, spare parts, and construction of
 facilities, you can see that the Soviet figure is about twice
 that of the United States in 1976.   This, of course, reflects
 the steady buildup of the Soviet forces over the entire period,
 and the even sharper decline in U.S.  investment after the peak
 of the Vietnam buildup in 1968.
 The estimated dollar cost of operating a force is almost
 15 percent higher in the Soviet case than for the U.S.   In
 the area of personnel, the larger component of operating costs,
 the estimate for Soviet programs exceeds the U.S. by more than
 60 percent, reflecting the large Soviet manpower base.
 In 1976,  although Soviet military manpower levels are about
 twice those of the U.S., the dollar costs of their personnel are
 only 60 percent greater.   A major reason for this apparent
 anomaly is the significantly different structures of the two
 forces.

 Strategic forces include all those forces assigned

 period,  the level of Soviet activity for strategic forces
 measured in dollars has been nearly two,and one-half times
 greater than that of the US.   In 1976, the Soviet level is over
 three and one-half times that of the US.
 Intercontinental attack forces include ICBMs,  submarine
 launched ballistic missiles, and bomber aircraft.       Over the

 1966-1976 period as a whole, the level of Soviet activity
 as measured in dollars is 50 percent greater than that of the US.
 In 1976,  it is over 100 percent greater.
 Within the respective intercontinental attack forces,
 the relative activity levels are mixed.   The Soviets'  emphasis
 has been on ICBMs and SLBMs.   The estimated dollar cost of
 Soviet ICBM programs over the entire period is almost 4 times
 cumulative US spending and over 6 times the US level in 1976.
 For SLBMs, the Soviets lead by 1.5 in both time frames.   In
 contrast,  in relative terms the US.has emphasized its bomber
 forces.   Over the 1966-1976 period, US spending on intercon-
 tinental bombers has exceeded dollar cost of Soviet activities
 by 300 percent and for 1976 by almost 200 percent.
 (Slide--Dollar Costs:   General Purpose Forces)
 General purpose forces include all ground tactical air,
 naval,  and mobility forces  (airlift and sealift).   Over the
 1966-76 period, cumulative US outlays for general purpose forces
 exceed estimated dollar costs of Soviet activities by about 10
 percent.   Since 1971, however, the Soviet level is larger
 than that of the US and is one-third greater in 1976.
 Within both the US and Soviet general purpose forces,
 land forces take the largest share of the costs.   Outlays for
 US land forces decrease after 1968, however, while the estimated
 dollar costs of Soviet activity increase steadily.   In 1976, the

 Approved For P49.ease 2004103/11 M&& RDP80M0016500050014000Z 3
 Soviet level of activity for these forces, measured in
 dollar terms,  is about 90 percent greater than that of
 the US.
 The second largest share of general purpose forces,
 in terms of dollar costs,  is for what is classified as General
 Purpose naval forces  (not including carriers of SSBNs).   The
 costs of these forces remain relatively constant for both
 countries over the period.   In 1976 estimated dollar costs
 of Soviet activities are about 20 percent higher than US out-
 lays.
 The US outlays for tactical air forces  (including naval
 attack carriers)  are greater than the estimated dollar costs
 of comparable Soviet forces.   Soviet activities are increasing,
 however, while US outlays   have been decreasing since 1968.
 US outlays in 1976 are about 20 percent greater than dollar
 costs of the Soviet forces.
 Dr.  Stevens.   As you have indicated in past years in our
 discussions of costing these military programs, our use of
 dollar cost comparisons do have a systematic bias favoring the
 Soviets.     This bias reflects what economists term the index
 number problem.
 Different countries use more resources and mix them in
 a fashion that will reduce the costs overall.   In other words,
 they tailor their programs to take advantage of the relatively
 cheap resources and capabilities of their countries.
 So, a bilateral comparison drawn in terms of the prices of

 of course,  is common to all international comparisons of
 economic activities.
 In order to look at the extent of this problem we
 have made some rough calculations of the ruble value of the
 US program.   There are some real difficulties in doing this.
 We have little direct information with regard to
 estimated Soviet costs of producing US military equipment.
 Rough ruble cost estimates are derived by applying a few highly
 aggregative ruble-dollar ratios to the US expenditure data.
 We also had problems converting US cost categories as
 "contingency funds" and "other" into rubles.
 These problems are complicated by the fact that whereas
 in the United States we had the technological capability to
 produce almost all types of Soviet equipment,  there is some US
 equipment that the Soviets do not have the technology to pro-
 duce.                       In such cases we follow accepted economic procedures by
 using the dollar-to-ruble conversion rate applicable to the
 closest substitute goods produceable in both countries.
 Our tentative calculation suggested the comparison in
 rubles is not radically different from that in dollars.
 Comparing the two, we find that the "index number" effect is
 discernible, but not extreme.   For the comparison in dollars,
 the ratio is 1.4 to 1 in favor of the Soviets;  in the case of
 our ruble comparison,  it is 1.25 to 1.

 So, we believe that there is some difference in the two
 comparisons, but that it generally supports the kind of figures
 and the kind of trends that we have been developing through
 the years.
 Admiral Turner.   Mr. Chairman, we are running well over my
 time estimate.   I wonder if this next item, which is miscellaneous
 questions which you submitted, could be placed in the record and
 we could go on.   Of course,  if you prefer, we would be glad to
 discuss them.
 Senator Proxmire.   Suppose you give us the section on
 quality control, which I understand follows this, and then we
 can go ahead with our questions.   Ithink that is important
 and should not be omitted.
 Admiral Turner.   All right.
 Dr.  Stevens.   Mr.  Chairman,  the Soviets clearly feel a
 good deal of pressure to do a better job of quality control.
 The approach that they are using is essentially one of brute
 force.   It is an inefficient method that relies upon producing
 a high output of goods and then simply rejecting a good deal of
 what is produced.
 This is really the only feasible course of action given
 the labor-intensive approach which they take to their weapons
 production.
 They depend on what we call the Voyenpred system and on
 a system of fines for faulty production to ensure quality control

 for military hardware.
 The Voyenpreds are military representatives who are located
 at the plants who monitor weapons production in all of its
 phases.   They have three major functions:   to prevent production
 bottlenecks by being expediters for the necessary material in-
 puts;                      to police the pricing of military products;  and finally,
 to ensure that products sold to the military meet all the quality
 standards required.
 Management is also motivated to enforce quality control
 because they are potentially liable should the product fail
 to perform adequately.
 This represents their approach to the quality control
 problem, which is, as I said, pretty much of a brute force
 tactic.
 Admiral Turner.   May I move on to Soviet civil defense,
 Senator Proxmire.   Yes,  sir.
 Admiral Turner. We have done an extensive review in this
 area in this past year.   It is not completed yet.   We are not
 ready to estimate the magnitude in dollars or rubles of their
 effort, nor give a comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness.
 We do believe that theSoviets have been gradually, but steadily,
 increasing their civil defense effort.   Their program is ambitious,
 it is not apparently a crash effort.
 It appears to us that in the late 1960's or early 1970's
 there was a shift of emphasis, particularly when it came under
 military direction.

 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M001Qi5000500140002-3
 Mr.  Chairman, there are three elements to any civil
 defense program.   The first is your ability to protect leader-
 ship;                        the second is your ability to shelter and protect the
 population in general;  the third is to protect some economic
 capability for a post-attack or post-war recovery.
 I would like to discuss each of these briefly in turn.
 With respect to protecting the leadership in the Soviet Union,
 we believe the Soviets have a reasonable opportunity, with
 warning, to protect a large percentage of their key military
 and civilian leadership.
 As far as the overall population is concerned, there are
 four elements to protecting a population.   One is urban
 shelters,  two is evacuation procedures,  three is reserve of
 essential supplies to support the population, and four is some
 form of indoctrination and training in the necessary procedures.
 The Soviets have a shelter program, although we do not
 know the total number of shelters.
 Despite the shelter program we believe the Soviets will
 still rely heavily on dispersal and evacuation to protect
 their urban population.
 Soviet plans call for the key workers and essential
 personnel to travel to dispersal sites that are outside the
 cities, but close enough that they could commute back.   Non-
 essential personnel we expect would be evacuated up to 300
 kilometers away.

 Approved For&lease 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M0016000500140002-3
 In this connection, the third point, stocks of supplies,
 we do feel that they have large stocks of food, water,                                        fuel,
 and medicine located outside the urban areas.   Supply levels
 are sufficient for minimum subsistence needs for weeks or
 perhaps months; but they might well face problems in distri-
 buting these supplies in the face of a major attack.
 Fourth and finally, we see little evidence today of
 serious efforts at mass indoctrination  of the population or
 in actual exercising of the evacuation procedures.
 The third element of civil defense is protecting some
 portion of the economy.   Here the Soviets include dispersal
 of their plants, hardening measures, and industrial civil
 defense units, and strategic reserves of essential materials.
 The civil defense program calls for locating new
 industries outside the urban areas, and for increasing the
 space between buildings within industrial complexes to reduce
 potential damage.
 In point of fact,  industrial expansion during the past
 15 years has not significantly reduced the overall industrial,
 vulnerability.   Heavy industry remains concentrated in large
 urban areas.
 Building patterns in many industries have become more
 dense rather than more spread out as intended.
 Overall, we do not believe that the existing preparations
 could prevent a general breakdown in the economy in the event
 of a US retaliatory strike.

 In conclusion, we believe the Soviets do not possess
 a civil defense capability that would enable them to feel
 that they could with reasonable expectation absorb a re-
 taliatory strike at levels of damage that would be acceptable
 to them.
 Yet, Soviet civil defense is an integral part of their
 military strategy for the conduct of nuclear war, and the
 Soviet Union is making more progress and effort in civil
 defense today than is the United States.
 We do not interpret this as meaning that the Soviets
 are planning to initiate nuclear warfare, but they do appear
 to be thinking through its consequences should it occur,
 and their need to plan for survival and post-attack recovery.
 Now we are ready to move on to China,  sir.
 Senator Proxmire.   Suppose we do this.   I know that the
 Senators would like to ask questions.   China is certainly
 very important, but the Soviet Union is of such overwhelming

 could proceed to questions now.

 ahead with China.
 Dr.  Stevens.   I will run through this very quickly if
 I can,  Senator.
 1976 was, of course, a very momentous year for China
 because of the deaths of both Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai,
 the arrest of Mao's widow and the "gang of four," and the
 massive earthquakes which really had an impact on the economy,
 in several different ways.
 (Slide -- Growth of GNP)
 Dr.  Stevens.   We have made some rough estimates of
 economic performance in 1976, though it has been very difficult
 to do because of the small amount of official reporting that
 we get. Our estimates for 1976 indicate a slight gain in
 agricultural output and a small decline in industrial produc-
 tion, with the net result that there was no growth in the
 Gross National Product last year.
 There were,  as I said,  a number of problems.   Political
 factionalism disrupted production in industry and elsewhere.
 The earthquake in the Peking-Tientsin-Tang-shan area caused
 enormous loss of life and extreme damage, both in industrial
 output of such things as coal and in transportation.

 Approved ForIease 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M0016000500140002-3
 Dr.  Stevens.   Agricultural performance was disappointing;
 grain output was 280-285 million tons, the same as in 1975,
 and cotton production was down.
 (Slide--Grain Imports)
 Dr.  Stevens.   Until late 1976, China drew down its
 grain reserves to avoid spending hard currency for new grain
 imports.   Peking then accelerated purchases of grain, and you
 can see that this year China will import a good deal of grain
 from the Western World.
 (Slide--Trends  in Foreign Trade)
 Dr.  Stevens.   China's foreign trade fell by about 10 per-
 cent in 1976,                       the first decline since 1968.
 As you can see,  for the first time since the early 1970s,
 China moved into a surplus situation in its trade balance.
 Trade with Japan, which is China's prime trading partner,
 was down about 20 percent.
 (Slide - US-China-Trade)
 Dr.  Stevens.   US exports to China dropped dramatically
 in this period,  as you can see from this chart, which shows
 the fluctuations caused by various export programs beginning
 and ending through the period.
 Senator Proxmire.   That is really amazing.
 Dr.  Stevens.   This year,  1976, was the first year that
 US imports of Chinese goods exceeded our exports since 1972
 when export controls were lifted.
 If I may now move on to the economic prospects for 1977,

 as a year of readjustment and are putting high priority on
 restoring the economic order.
 In industry and transportation,  sizable gains over last
 year's poor performance can be expected.   Recent official
 claims have noted month-to-month increases in industrial
 output and railway performance.
 In agriculture, on the other hand,  the prospects are
 not good.   A drought in the north China plain has reduced
 winter wheat production.   This could be made up by a good
 fall harvest, but it has again aggravated the problem of
 tight supply in grain.
 In foreign trade,  1977 will be a year of adjustment with
 only moderate growth.
 A new round of plant purchases will not begin before
 late this year and may be delayed if the agricultural per-
 formance is such as to require them to import additional grain
 from abroad.
 China's new leadership began its term in October with
 economic issues clearly high on its docket.   After a series
 of national conferences to consider economic problems and
 prospects, the present leaders have revived the long-term
 modernization program announced by the late Premier Chou En-lai
 in 1975,  and apparently are using this as the basic blueprint
 for how they intend to proceed.
 Agricultural modernization is clearly going to be given
 top billing.   With cultivable land already under intensive use,

 China must increase yields by greater use of modern inputs
 such as chemical fertilizer and new seed strains.
 In industry, Peking will devote more resources to
 raising the level of technology and restoring balance,
 particularly in heavy industry.   Structural imbalances. in
 the steel sector and capacity shortages in mining must be
 straightened out.   Peking must also pay greater attention to
 improving efficiency throughout the economy, which will require
 reforms in planning and management, and a strengthening of
 worker incentives.
 The new leadership is keenly aware of the importance of
 scientific and technical work to its plans for modernization.
 It is facing now the problem of restoring an educational system
 severely weakened by the Cultural Revolution.
 China will also look more closely at the modernization
 of its national defenses.   The pace of military modernization
 has been the subject of considerable debate over the past
 several months.   There are indications that the civilian
 leadership would prefer to hold back on modernization until
 some basic economic problems can be taken care of.
 There are two particular obstacles that the Chinese face
 in improving economic performance.   The first of these is the
 inability of the central government to effect real control
 over provincial and county   resource allocations.   The second
 is labor unrest, which has occurred as a result of dissatis-
 faction with the lack of wage increases over the years.

 Neither of these problems is going to be easy to solve.
 Both constitute difficult problems for the new leadership.
 Admiral Turner.   Very quickly, on the Chinese defense
 side, we have a lack of good information on their defense
 expenditures.   We are able to keep a pretty good count on their
 hardware, not on their manpower and support costs and other-
 wise.   We do believe that they spend 8 to 10 percent of their
 Gross National Product on their defense.   We believe that
 because of the elementary nature of their economy,  this is a
 far larger drain on their advanced-industries, their sophisticated
 industries, than it is in either the Soviet Union or the United
 States.
 (Slide --- Estimated Military Expenditures -Index)
 Admiral Turner.   The history of Chinese defense expendi-
 tures,  as we best estimate them, is a considerable rise, peaking
 in 1971 and dropping sharply and levelling off to a plateau
 ever since.   We think this reflects a reduced estimate of the
 probability of war with the Soviet Union after this drop in
 1971;  continuing intense competition for economic resources;
 and difficulty simply in developing follow-on military systems
 that are up to date.
 We don't think that this reflects a marked drop in the
 size of the Chinese armed forces, but rather a slowing in the
 modernization of them.   In short, basic policy today in the
 defense spheres in China appears to be a priority towards
 agriculture and industry, with a gradual but reduced level of

 modernization and upgrading of the military forces.   In
 short, they are holding military spending in check and are
 doing only selective improvements on it, but they are main-
 taining their overall force levels.
 That, sir, completes our prepared presentation.
 We are happy to respond to your questions.
 Senator Proxmire.   Thank you, Admiral.
 That concluding remark that you made on the Chinese military
 suggests to me that it is a very, very limited kind of threat.
 After all,  their Gross National Product is about 10 percent of
 ours, and if they are spending 8 percent of their Gross National
 Product in defense,  it means a very small military force, at
 least in terms of modern strike force, as compared to ours, or
 to that of the Soviet Union.
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  Sir.   They have a very limited
 nuclear intercontinental strike capability.   In fact, they are
 just bringing on their first weapon that could even reach the
 United States.
 As far as ground warfare is concerned, our only real
 potential point of contact at this stage or potential would
 be Korea.   I think they do have some potential there with
 a repeat of the massive human attack.

 Senator Proxmire.   One of the sections of your excellent
 testimony which you had to skip over in the interest of time
 concerned Soviet technology,  their technology as compared to
 ours.
 One of the most startling revelations that we had last
 year when Director Bush came up to testify before us was his
 argument that Soviet military technology was behind ours.
 He put it this way.   He said that there was no significant
 area where they were ahead of us and many significant areas
 where they were behind us.
 In the two pages you have which deal with Soviet and
 US technology comparisons, you  indi_c,.7.6 ':        areas where
 they trail us,  such as electronics,  cor..:t:`2 s, design and
 manufacturing technology incorporated into the Soviet air-
 craft and missiles.   Is the picture still the same as far
 as technology is concerned,  that we are ahead of the Soviet
 Union in important respects and that they are not ahead
 of us in any?   Is that a fair statement?
 Admiral Turner. I would be a little loath to make a
 categorical statement that they are not ahead of us in
 any.   They are certainly ahead of us in some areas of
 application.
 Senator Proxmire.   Such as?
 Admiral Turner.   In some areas of command,  control
 and communications of military forces I would say they are

 Approved For Vejease 20B4J8  (1 SF  -   P80M0016  p00500140002-3
 ahead of us in application more than in technology; that is,
 they put more resources into that area.
 Senator Proxmire.   Can you give us an overall assessment?
 Admiral Turner.   An overall assessment would be that we
 are well ahead of them in military technology.   With brute
 force techniques, however,  they do achieve about the same
 end result in many areas that we do with much more sophisticated
 techniques.   For example, they will put multiple computers in
 a system,  each of much less sophistication than the one we
 put in ours.
 Senator Proxmire.   It shows a higher cost, but not
 necessarily a higher effectiveness,  right?
 Admiral Turner.   That's correct.
 Senator Proxmire.   Are you saying that the USSR defense
 spending exceeds ours in 1976 on a dollar basis by 30 to 40
 percent and if so,  I just wonder what that means?   What you
 are saying,  as I understand it,  is for us to reproduce the
 Soviet defense establishment,  it would cost 30 to 40 percent
 more than we spend on our own defense.
 Is that right?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir.
 Senator Proxmire. However, much of that Soviet defense
 establishment would be irrelevant for our needs.   They have a
 large number of troops on the Chinese border,  for example,
 right?
 Admiral Turner.   That's correct.

 Senator Proxmire.   They have a problem of suppressing
 dissent in the satellite countries,  so they quarter substantial
 troops in that area.
 Admiral Turner  (nods affirmatively.)
 Senator Proxmire.   Does it allow for their lesser  effi-
 ciency,  their lesser technological development than ours, or
 not?
 Mr.  Burton.   Sir,  actually it is US technology and pro-
 duction that enter into these estimates,  so it is what it would
 cost us to reproduce the Soviet design.
 Senator Proxmire.   Then there is one other element here.
 Perhaps I am wrong, but I have heard and I get the impression
 that the Soviet Union has very much more of a concern with
 defense, defense against air attack,  the civil defense which
 you mentioned,  that they are defense-minded or defensive-minded,
 as compared with offensive-minded, much more than are we and
 other countries.   Would that not account for some of the dif-
 ference?
 What I am trying to say is in comparing the Soviet Union
 with us, the relative force,  effectiveness,  and efficiency of
 the Soviet Union, we don't have the concern,for example, with
 a bomber attack that they seem to have.   I understand that they
 have the most heavily defended air space in the world.   Of
 course,  that is enormously costly and would account for part
 of their immense expenditure, would it not?

 Admiral Turner.   Yes sir.   The Soviets have deployed a much
 more ambitious air defense system than the US.
 I think you can look at the history of the Soviet armed
 forces since World War II and in all categories they began with
 a quite defensive orientation.     I, of course, am most familiar
 with the naval sphere,  and I would say that the origin of their
 navy was to protect against incursions from the sea towards
 their homeland.
 I think that in all areas in the last decade we see this
 merging into a much more offensive potential.   Whether that
 is their intent or not,  I don't know.   But it certainly is not
 a defensive move to build up their tank inventory and their
 artillery on the western front of Europe as much as they have.
 Similarly, with their airforce,  they are going largely from
 fighter interceptor defensive aircraft to multipurpose attack
 and fighter aircraft.   Similarly with their navy,  they are
 going from short-range capability to defend their coastal
 waters to a worldwide demonstrable capability,  including even
 small aircraft carriers.
 Senator Proxmire.   I only have time for one or two more
 questions.   I have only 2 or 3 minutes left.
 Let me ask you this.
 This whole presentation has been fascinating, but one
 of the interesting elements was the one you started off with
 on which Senator Hatch had some very good questions.   This
 concerns me.

 You talked about the Soviet oil oroduction and the effect
 that that is going to have on the Soviet economy, perhaps even
 on the Soviet military as time goes on.   You do concede un-
 certainty in some of your facts,  including the amount of proved
 reserves, estimated by you at 30 to 35 billion barrels.
 In view of our own uncertainty about U.S. reserves, what
 is the margin of error in your estimate?   Could it be off by
 a factor of two or more, and if so,  isn't it possible that the
 rest of the analysis is flawed?
 Admiral Turner.   I hesitate to say how much the estimate
 of reserves could be off without asking anybody else if he
 wants to guess about that.
 Mr.  Diamond.   Senator, that is true, but you have to
 remember the definition of what we mean by "reserves."   These
 are not what is in the ground.   These are recoverable reserves
 and what we consider to be at a reasonable economic cost.
 Senator Proxmire.   So do you agree that they could be
 twice as high as is estimated?
 Mr.  Diamond.   That is true. It could be tremendous.
 For example,  in this country we claim 30 to 35 billion barrels
 of recoverable oil but total reserves may exceed 100 billion
 barrels.      The experts believe that with current technology
 only about one-third of these reserves are recoverable.

 Admiral Turner.   Even if they have twice as many re-
 coverable reserves as we think,  in the next decade they
 cannot turn that into oil on the surface of the earth.
 Thus we do not think that invalidates the analysis which
 we have been presenting to you today, sir, because we are
 saying that in the next decade, the pressures which we
 tried to demonstrate this morning are going to exist.
 Senator Proxmire.   Are you saying that you are sure
 that they will not be able to produce, say 12 million
 barrels a day in 1985?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir.   That is our prediction,
 that they cannot even sustain the 10 million that they are
 doing today.
 Senator Proxmire.   But they have the reserves in the
 ground,  so why not?
 Admiral Turner.   Because if they have not made suf-
 ficient progress towards developing those reserves, they
 cannot get it out by 1985, particularly in the inhospitable
 and remote areas in which they have to work.
 Senator Hatch.    Admiral,  as I see it,  at your highest
 estimate they have 12 million barrels a day.   Now we have
 presently a need in the United States for about 18 million,
 considering no gain or no particular growth.
 They have a lesser industrialized economy than we do.
 They have what, 50,000 manufacturing facilities in Russia

 as compared with 295,000 in this country.   I don't see how
 they can use 10 to 12 million barrels a day.   I am wondering
 if they are storing that.
 Admiral Turner.   In 1976 they exported about 3 million
 b/d.   Half went to other Communist countries; half to other
 areas. That means that they used about 7-1/2 million
 barrels a day, which is little less than half of ours.
 Senator Hatch.   I see.   That would correspond with the
 differences in the economies.
 You suspect that for them to have any type of growth
 at all they have to keep energy production going.
 Admiral Turner.   Yes, sir.   That is the record;  their
 economic growth and their energy use have been in parallel
 all these years.
 Senator Hatch.   To change the subject, when I first
 came to the Senate, we were told that they did not have very
 much of a civil defense system.      Now you have told us today
 that they have a civil defense system, one of such a nature
 that if we had a retaliatory attack, the majority of their
 people would survive,  and much of their leadership would
 survive.
 Is that correct, or have I misconstrued what you said?
 Admiral Turner. Assuming some hours of warning,  the
 majority of their leadership would survive.

 I think the ability of their population to survive is
 very much in doubt.   There is considerable uncertainty that
 they could hope to protect a reasonable percentage of their
 population at this time.
 Senator Hatch. And just as much uncertainty that they
 could protect their industrial centers.
 Admiral Turner.   There is very little probability,  in
 my opinion, that they could protect their economic base.
 They have not followed through on their plans to space and
 relocate their industry.
 Senator Hatch.   What about the tensions between China
 and Russia, on the Manchurian borders,  for instance?
 Admiral Turner.   The tensions there are pretty deep-
 rooted.   The Soviets have indicated a willingness to nego-
 tiate, but there is little sign of give on the Chinese side.
 The Chinese say that the Soviets must  evacuate the islands
 in the Amur River and acknowledge that they were granted
 to the Soviet Union under an unjust treaty before they will
 even negotiate on whether the islands belong to one side
 or the other.
 In addition, there is a large island opposite the city
 of Khabarovsk, which the Soviets would not give up for
 strategic reasons.
 Senator Hatch.   Just this past week I read some articles
 where it was suggested that we are dropping the ball economically

 and strategically in not strengthening relationships with
 China which would bring concomitant pressure on the Soviet
 Union.
 Are you of that same opinion?
 Admiral Turner.   Senator, you are taking me into the
 area of policy-making for our government, and as an unbiased,
 objective purveyor of intelligence,  I would rather stay out
 of that if I may.
 Senator Hatch.   But it still has a relationship to
 this area, because our trade, you have indicated, has gone
 sharply down below what it was just a few years ago.   We
 were at a very high peak and then all of a sudden we have
 dropped to the point where we import more than we export
 with regard to the People's Republic of China.
 What I am concerned about is this.   Should we be
 fostering a program where we increase our trade with the
 Peoples'  Republic, which would also unsettle the Russians,
 and is there any way that we can increase our trade since
 we have had such a drastic fall-out?   Is that strictly because
 their economy has bounced up?   Just what are the reasons?
 Admiral Turner.   I believe that we have seen a deliberate
 effort on the part of the Chinese to get their overall trade
 back in balance.
 Senator Hatch.   To be self-contained?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes.   Although the Chinese have made
 greater use of foreign trade in recent years to spur economic

 development,  self-reliance remains. their stated policy.   For
 example,  the imports of complete plants over the past several
 years will enable the Chinese to reduce, or at least hold
 down,  imports of such items as steel,  fertilizer,  and textile
 fibers in the future.
 Senator Hatch.   Is there any indication that they are
 willing to increase trade relations with us so that we can get
 back to where we export more than we import?
 Admiral Turner.   I see little indication of that.   They
 will increase trade with the US when it suits their purpose,
 but Peking's policy has been to limit purchases from the US
 when alternative supplies are available.   The rapid rise of
 the US to the position of China's second largest trading
 partner was, of course,  the result of large-scale Chinese
 purchases of agricultural products in years when world supplies
 were tight and China's traditional suppliers could not meet
 its needs.   For the peak trade years 1973-74 agricultural
 commodities accounted for more than 80% of US exports to
 China.*   Other Chinese purchases have been items such as Boeing

 include limited US demand for Chinese goods,  lack of MFN-status
 for Chinese exports, US controls on strategic exports, and
 the absence of direct banking and shipping facilities due to
 the still unresolved frozen assets/claims problem.
 Senator Hatch.   I have one other question and that is
 this.   Since coming to the Senate, I have had occasion to talk
 to some of our military people who are concerned that the Soviets
 may be developing these special high-technology weapons that
 your report indicates they have not developed, such as the
 particle beam weapon, various sensor devices, various forms
 of monitoring technology, et cetera.   Is there any reason for
 that disparity?   Some of these people seem to talk very
 intelligently about it and I have heard both sides.   Some
 decry everything that others cite.
 Admiral Turner.   We have analyzed the particle beam weapon
 in particular in some detail.   It is our belief that the com-
 ponent technologies that would be required to build that sort:
 of capability are not advanced enough in the Soviet Union to
 give them the prospect of being anywhere close to developing
 such a weapon.   Most of the evidence adduced to the contrary
 is based on the assumption that a particular facility in the
 Soviet Union is dedicated to this purpose, and additional

 assumptions about their state of technology.   We think all of
 these     assumptions are questionable.   Further, we don't see
 signs of those efforts required for pulling this together.
 Senator Hatch.   Are they working on particle beam weapons
 or something close to it?
 Admiral Turner.   I cannot either confirm or deny that as
 I don't have positive evidence that they are not.
 Senator Hatch.   We really do not know, then.
 Admiral Turner.  We really do not know.
 Senator Hatch.   But you do question seriously whether or
 not they have reached that form of technology at a high state
 of art?
 Admiral Turner.  We don't know that they are doing it,
 but we have fair confidence that they don't have the required
 technologies at a sufficiently advanced stage yet.
 Senator Hatch.   I  see.   Thank you.

 Admiral Turner.   Thank you,        sir.
 Senator Sparkman.   Of course, we have been dealing with
 part of that part of the world in the Foreign Relations
 Committee.   I want to say just this, with reference to a
 question asked by Senator Hatch just before he left.   it
 deals with the confrontation,  if we can call it that, between
 the Soviet Union and the Peoples'  Republic of China.
 Back in 1973,  I believe it was then,  I was in China and
 I had a conference with Chou En-lai, who was still living
 at that time.   I remember quite well, during the discussion
 he expressed the hope that the United States would maintain
 its strength in Western Europe, particularly with the NATO
 nations,  as opposed to the Warsaw Pact nations.   He said that
 if we kept them busy there, they could not carry on as well
 as otherwise on the northern border.   Now remember, he made
 this statement.   He said,  just think how you would feel if
 you had an enemy army of a million men on your northern
 frontier.
 I have often thought of that with reference to the
 relationship between the two countries.
 Admiral,  I greatly enjoyed your statement.   I appreciate
 it and want to thank you for it.
 Admiral Turner.   Thank you,  sir.
 Senator Sparkman.   I just don't see how you get all
 of that information.     I am not going to ask you how, of course.

 (General laughter.)
 Senator Proxmire.   Senator Roth.
 Senator Roth.   Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.
 I, too, want to congratulate the Director.   I think it
 was a very fine presentation.
 There is one question that I have.
 As I understand your testimony in the case of China,
 they are really placing defense as a last priority,  they
 place agriculture and industry ahead of their defense and
 military needs; whereas in the case of the USSR it is pretty
 much the opposite in terms of their top priority.   The Soviets
 are placing their consumer needs way down on the list.
 Now if that is accurate,  it would appear that the
 imbalance,  if we can call it that, between the USSR and China
 is going to grow.   I have heard it said that some people think
 for that reason the military in China may desire some kind
 of accommodation with the USSR.
 Is there any evidence or any reason that you can see
 that there may be an effort for rapprochement or accom-
 modation between those two countries?
 Admiral Turner.   I see no evidence of any current
 moves in that direction or inclination to move in that
 direction.
 Senator Roth.   The Soviet Union,  according to your
 prediction,  faces very serious economic problems.   I suspect
 that one of the problems we face on the Hill is to what extent,
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165A000500140002-3
 Approved For we. ease 20 4(9O lS1S f   WP80M0016W00500140002-3 65
 if at all,  should we provide economic assistance in one form
 or another.   One example that we have worked with in the past
 is to help them develop their natural oil and gas, particularly
 in Siberia.     If we, say, together with the Japanese join in
 helping that development, would that substantially change the
 energy picture as far as the USSR is concerned?
 Admiral Turner.   Well, the word "substantial" is a problem
 for me.   It certainly is apparent that the Soviets today need
 help to hold their own,   let alone to proceed, and that if they
 are going to develop new fields in Siberia, they are going to
 need outside financing as well as outside infusions of tech-
 nology.
 So, while we do not believe that kind of assistance will
 appreciably change the predictions I have given you between
 now and the mid-1980s,  it certainly could be an important factor
 in whether they begin to come back up this downward slope that
 we showed you after the mid-1980s.   That kind of help is not
 likely to start producing oil for probably another decade.
 Senator Roth.   Do you have any predictions as to what
 recovery could be under a large scale program,  say of 20 or 25
 years?   Do you have any prediction on the number of barrels
 a day?
 Admiral Turner.   I don't think so, but there is no
 doubt that there is lots of oil out there, right, Doug?
 Mr.  Diamond.  Yes,  sir.
 There are no predictions.   One of our consultants
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165A000500140002-3
 Approved For W ease 20/`  ~GIIAI IBP80MOO16.O0500140002-3  66
 feels that unless massive infusions of investment and
 technology are poured in, not only from the US but also
 from Western Europe, production may not turn up in the
 last half of the 1980s or early 1990s.
 The required investment effort boggles the mind.   For,
 example,  in this 1976-80 five year plan, they are putting
 in 20 million tons of pipe or 24,000 miles of oil and gas
 pipeline,  just in this five year plan.   The Alaska pipeline
 is only 300 miles long.   To accomplish this goal, the
 Soviets would have to lay an Alaskan pipeline every six to
 eight weeks, under comparable or even more inhospitable
 conditions.   This is an indicator of required effort for
 investment in the transmission system alone.
 So, when you talk about overall magnitude of outlays
 of investment for capacity to develop and transport oil
 for 1976-80 beyond, no expert would hazard a guess as
 to how many billions of dollars of Western help would be
 required to run production of oil up.
 Senator Roth.   I believe at one point you said the
 Soviets may seek assistance from us.   Would you be a
 little more specific about the kind of assistance they
 might want?
 Admiral Turner.   I think it is primarily our techno-
 logy they are after and that they can only get if they
 have hard currency or credits in hard currency areas;

 specifically, we have referred several times to the tech-
 nology for oil development.   Today it is techniques for
 getting it out of the ground under existing conditions.
 But as they move into the frozen north more,  I think they
 will be looking to us for all kinds of technology in
 pipeline development,  exploration techniques, and so on.
 Senator Roth.   Thank you.
 I have one last question, Mr.  Chairman.
 With respect to civil defense,  is there any possibility
 that these efforts might be directed towards protection in
 a conventional war if they decided they might want to move
 in Europe?   Could these facilities be useful?
 The Chinese have warned us that the Soviet Union is
 going to move in Europe.   Could this be the purpose behind it?
 Admiral Turner.   There is no question that these shelters
 would be even more effective against a conventional attack.
 Senator Roth.   Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.
 Senator Proxmire.   I have one question at this point
 and then I will yield to Senator Javits.   I know that he has
 been waiting very patiently.
 Is there any possibility that the civil defense effort
 is an effort designed not to protect themselves against an
 attack by us, which as you said would seem to be pretty
 devastating, but against a nuclear attack from the Chinese?

 Approved For  elease 20UlliODAi$   FA4WP80M0016SA000500140002-3 68
 Admiral Turner.       I think that the Soviets have consid-
 erable concerns about that, yes,                                 sir.
 Senator Proxmire.   And it would probably give them that
 protection against the Chinese pretty effectively, wouldn't
 it--in view of the fact that they have less megatonnage,  less
 accuracy,  less precision,  far fewer warheads,  less follow-on
 capacity,  and so on?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes.   There is no question that the
 Chinese do not have the capability today to take out a sub-
 stantial percentage of the Soviet population or leadership
 or industry simply for a lack of weapons.   So yes, civil
 defense becomes proportionately more useful under those
 circumstances.
 Senator Proxmire.   Thank you.
 Senator Javits.   I have two questions and I will ask
 them separately.   You spoke of per capita consumption
 diminishing to a 2 percent annual growth rate for the
 individual in the Soviet Union.   We constantly hear that
 every once in a while they have to divert from their funda-
 mental concentration of roughly 13 percent of the GNP on
 military weaponry, et cetera,  in order to do something
 for the civilian sector.   What causes them to do that?
 There is no public opinion,  there are no elections, there
 is no press,  there is no radio, no television.   Why do
 they have any need to respond at all to the individual?

 69

 I have been to the Soviet Union on a number of occasions.
 The people seem to be fairly well shod.   I am told that they
 eat adequately--after all, you can live on pretty little
 compared to the way we operate around here.
 What is the pressure on them to do anything for the
 consumer?
 Admiral Turner.   Let me ask some of the Soviet experts.
 Doug?
 Mr. Diamond.   Senator, there are really three types of
 pressures.   As we measure Soviet per capita consumption,
 it is roughly one-third of the US, perhaps half that of Western
 Europe, and 70 percent of that of Hungary and Poland.
 Secondly,  in particular areas,  such as quality of
 diet, one out of every two calories they consume is still
 from starchy staples,  such as grains and potatoes.   Their
 starchy-staple ratio is the highest of any advanced industrial
 country in the world.   Meat consumption is 40 percent of ours
 and 70 percent of that of Poland and Hungary.   The queues for
 certain kinds of goods, especially selected high quality foods,
 are long.   Perhaps you may have seen them.
 We have had reporting over the last year of consider-
 ably more discontent in the mid 1970s than there was at
 the end of the 1960s.   This does not show in rioting,
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165A000500140002-3
 Approved For   lease 20UNCLA  - f l     P80M0016S000500140002-3 70
 as it did in 1962, when Khrushchev raised prices on some
 foods, but it may show up in a lower level of productivity,
 for example.
 Senator Proxmire.   Did you say a lower level of
 productivity?
 Mr.  Diamond.   A lower rate of growth in labor producti-
 vity,  and that includes absenteeism.
 Thirdly,  it is widely believed that Russians are more
 stoic than their counterparts in Eastern Europe.   The Poles
 will take to the streets more quickly.   But, when Brezhnev
 and his colleagues observe what happened in Eastern Europe
 over the last 20 years, especially widespread demonstrations
 in Poland in 1970 and 1976, this causes them concern.
 Because of these kinds of pressures we judge that the
 leadership will feel that some growth in per capita con-
 sumption is required although they will be unable to prevent
 a slowdown.
 Senator Javits.   For me, the most important part of
 what you have said has been the figures,  that they live
 only 70 percent as well as the Hungarians and the Poles,
 and 50 percent as well as the West Europeans.
 I think that is all extremely important.   I think
 that we,  in the Congress,  should be very interested in
 to what extent the public is manifesting its will some-
 how, even in a country which is held in such an iron grip
 as this one.   I gather, as a necessary corollary, that as

 Approved Forelease 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M0016W00500140002-3 71

 far as the military people are concerned, they eat all
 right and sleep all right if they are not subjected to any
 of these problems.   Is that correct?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Yes,  sir.   They get their daily rations.
 Senator Javits.   The Russian soldier in my father's
 day was very expendable.       He ate almost anything, he slept
 anywhere,  and he was literally a slave.   But that is no
 longer true.
 Admiral Turner.   But his pay is not good if he is a
 conscript,  and you are aware,  sir, of the signs of dis-
 content we have had,                         such as the pilot who flew the aircraft
 to Japan.
 I do not want to portray that as a major problem at
 this point, but at least it is interesting as an indicator.
 Senator Javits.   On the positive side you are able
 to testify that they are taken pretty good care of,  isn't
 that right?
 Mr.  Diamond.   That is right,  sir,  in a comparative
 sense,  inside their own economy, but not by our standards.
 Senator Javits.    I understand that, of course.   I
 just told you about Russian soldiers from my personal
 experience.   I know from whence they come.
 But I was interested in where they are now.
 The other thing that interests me is your statement,
 which I want you to confirm,  that the USSR will experience
 a hard currency squeeze in the 1980s.   This means that

 UNCLASSIFIED                                 72
 they may have to turn to us even more for credits and
 technology.
 This is a critical point for this reason.   The USSR
 and the Eastern Bloc owes Western Europe about $30 billion
 right now, and the United States is only in for about
 $5 billion,  that is, United States banks.   As a matter of
 fact,  it is only about $1.5 billion to the USSR.
 There is a big policy question which you may not even
 want to answer at this time.   You may wish to think about
 it.    There are certain factual questions which relate to
 this question of policy.
 Should we continue this policy of relatively easy
 access to the credit markets of the world by the USSR?
 Or, should we turn against it in a very affirmative and
 decided way and use that, by linkage, with Angola, the
 Middle East, or any other place?
 The same is true of technology over which we have
 surrendered control.
 On the other hand,  it is said that the Russian hardness
 on the Jewish emigration question was attributable to the
 limitation of $300 million in Export-Import Bank lending,
 which is meaningless to them now, except as a matter of
 respectability, which was imposed by the Congress.

 This to me is the critical area,  these economic
 questions.     The question I would like to ask you Admiral,
 is what facts do you have to cast light on this question.
 This is what I would like to get at.   This is to me
 the basic question:   what leverage is there in the economic
 and technology relations between the United States and the
 Soviet Union that if,  as a matter of policy, we wish to
 employ--and that is not your business,  it is our business
 and the President's--we could?   We have to know what are
 our capabilities.   And I ask you, are we abreast of that?
 Admiral Turner. My best response to that at the
 moment, Senator Javits,  is that I feel a great responsi-
 bility to provide you the factual information that would
 help you approach that decision.   I feel that one of the
 most significant things about this long-term forecast
 of the Soviet economy that we have presented today is that
 it highlights that the Soviets have a limited number of
 options for what we think is a serious problem.
 Senator Proxmire.   Senator McClure.
 Senator McClure.   Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.   First let
 me apologize for coming in late.      There is nothing more
 important to me than this, unfortunately except for this
 particular morning.
 I have only two questions and perhaps you have already
 touched on these.

 Do you note any diversion within the Soviet economy
 away from military production and toward energy production?
 With reference to all of the demands on pipeline building
 and the rest of it,  I have not seen any diversion away
 from military production in order to meet that energy need.
 Admiral Turner.   No, sir, we do not either.
 Senator McClure.   It would seem to me,  then,  that
 the corollary is that if they have this tremendous problem
 confronting them, then military preparedness has all of
 the priority which we have attributed to them in that
 area in the past.
 Admiral Turner.  That is our view,  though we don't
 know how they will weigh that if and when this prediction
 really dawns upon them.
 Senator McClure.   So we don't know for sure whether
 we can supply the technology or the economics for that
 energy production.  It would certainly reduce the pressure
 for diversion of those things from energy production, but
 it might not result in any difference except increased
 energy capacity?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir.
 Senator McClure.   The other question is in regard to
 the point,     a very cogent point, that Senator Javits made
 about the relative standard of living of the Russian people.

 If they are only at 70 percent of the Eastern European
 countries and at 50 percent of Western Europe, that is
 significant, but it is significant only if they conceive
 it in that way.   If they are nevertheless moving up,  if
 their standard of living is rising each year and they feel
 relatively better off this year than last year and they
 don't know that they are worse off than someone else, that
 would have little significance, wouldn't it?
 I believe that what you are
 saying is certainly the right perception; that what the
 Soviet consumer sees of his relative position if probably
 more dominant in his thought than any hypothetical com-
 parison with outside.                          However,  I don't think we can
 discount outside influence completely because of the
 increasing amount of communication in the world today.
 Even the Soviets are travelling more than they used to.
 Senator McClure.   That would than indicate that in-
 creased contacts between countries might exacerbate that
 domestic problem for them?
 Admiral Turner.   It certainly would have some input.
 Senator McClure.   Thank you very much.
 I have no f ur ether questions.
 Senator Proxmire.   Admiral, do you have any preliminary
 estimates of Soviet grain production this year, what their
 targets are and what they are likely to achieve?
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165A000500140002-3
 Approved For$,alease 20g /8/1I - FA-P P80MOO16SAD00500140002-3  76
 Mr.  Diamond.   The target is 213.3 million tons this
 Senator Proxmire.   Just what does that mean?   How
 much of a dropoff is the expectation?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Last year's production was 224 million
 metric tons and that was a record.   Moscow would probably
 consider anything over 200 million to be quite satisfactory.
 The Department of Agriculture has a preliminary
 estimate of 225 million tons.   We agree with that estimate,
 although it must be stressed that it is very early in
 the season.   Much of the grain remains unripened, very
 little has been harvested.   Right now, however, growing
 conditions are very good.
 Senator Proxmire.   An article in  "The Washington Post"
 about six weeks ago reports that the figures for meat
 production for the Soviet Union are lower than for the same
 period last year and that the planned industrialization of
 agriculture is not likely to succeed unless the resources
 allocated to the military are reduced.
 Can you comment on that?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Meat production in the first quarter
 of this year remained below the first quarter of 1976.   It
 is just starting to turn up as the result of a sharp
 upturn in use of feedgrains from the record 1976 crop.

 Senator Proxmire.   Well, is there a connection--have
 they reduced in any way their military expenditures?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Oh,  absolutely not.              There is no direct
 relationship.
 Senator Proxmire.   Are they using troops in the fields
 at all?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Yes.
 Senator Proxmire.   More than usual?
 Mr.  Diamond.   We don't have a measure.
 Senator Proxmire.   Admiral,  I would like to ask you
 about some criticisms of the CIA.   I am sure that you
 remember the controversy over the so-called Team B review
 of last year's National Intelligence Estimate of Soviet
 strategic capabilities.
 At that time I made a public comment that criticism
 of the intelligence process was healthy and that conflicting
 ideas made good estimates.   At the same time,  I was highly
 critical of having one ideological group with one viewpoint
 represented as the only outside critical review body.
 Do you intend to have intelligence estimates reviewed
 by any outside panels,  and if so, will you insure that a
 wide body of opinion is represented?
 Admiral Turner. Yes;: sir.   I am moving toward that.
 Senator Proxmire. It was a view that was very good
 and intelligent.   I think that General Keegan is a man of

 great ability and I admire his ability.   But he represents
 a particular viewpoint,  and the other viewpoint, which it
 might be also wholesome and healthy to have, did not seem
 to be represented.
 Admiral Turner.   I think an ideologically structured
 Team A-Team B thing is not a normally good idea.   I would
 not reject it entirely, but I think it is something upon
 which I would look with suspicion.
 I think Teams A and Teams B can be good.   My first hope
 is to put into the process that we have as a standard matter,
 enough divergent opinions that we do not have to go out and
 get Teams A and Teams B.   I would hope that we have that
 interplay right within our organization, possibly by bring-
 ing in outsiders on an ad hoc basis,  if particular skills
 or viewpoints are needed.
 Senator Proxmire.   I can understand that and I think that
 makes for a neater operation.   But at the same time I would
 think that some people outside, who are not subject to the
 discipline. or the inhibitions that any person in the organi-
 zation is likely to be, would be freer to be more aggressive
 and more critical in suggesting areas where the CIA may be
 off base.
 Admiral Turner.   I think that is basically true.   I am
 planning to create a group of consultants.   We will look at
 a particular estimate that is being done,  such as this one

 on strategic forces,  and we will call from that group the
 right'mix of people to join in the estimate.               This would not
 be on a full-time basis, but we would ask them to come from
 the beginning of the exercise and to follow it right through
 and to critique as we go along.
 Senator Proxmire.   The public debate over the Team B
 episode seemed to indicate that the so-called hard-liners
 won the day and forced the CIA to re-evaluate its opinions
 about Soviet military strength.
 Did that in fact happen?
 Admiral Turner.   I really have not dug into that, Senator.
 But the CIA people assure me that that is not the case.
 In addition,  the story got vastly distorted in the press.
 Senator Proxmire.   As I remember the articles--which I
 thought were real shockers--in the "New York Times," there
 were 25 specific points covering a wide spectrum of differ-
 ences of opinion voiced by General Keegan.   I wrote a letter
 to the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff asking him to
 comment on each one.   But it was not just a narrow area,
 at least not according to General Keegan's criticisms.   It
 was rather broad.
 At any rate, General Keegan has publicly taken the CIA
 to task for a variety of mistakes,  ranging from myopia to
 deliberately hiding the facts from the policy-makers.   For
 example, he suggested that:   the CIA has considerably

 underestimated the Soviet threat;               the CIA contrived to
 reduce the estimated range of the Backfire bomber in order
 to salvage the SALT II accords;  the CIA has become politi-
 cized; the intelligence community has been wrong about
 parity and wrong about virtually every great Soviet scien-
 tific and military advance since World War II.
 Let's take those in order.
 Has the CIA consistently underestimated the Soviet

 Admiral Turner.   I don't believe so, no.
 Senator Proxmire.   Has the CIA contrived to reduce the
 estimated range of the Backfire bomber in order to salvage
 the SALT II  accords?
 Admiral Turner.   No.
 Senator Proxmire.   What about the argument of politi-
 cization of the CIA?                           What is your answer to that?
 Admiral Turner.   I won't speak for the past, but I will
 defend to the death that we are not politicized today,  sir.
 I feel that my responsibility is to stand clear of the
 policy-makers and to give the President,  the Senate, and
 the House objective, unbiased intelligence to the best that
 a human being can do that.
 Senator Proxmire.   What about the charge that the
 intelligence community--not just the CIA, but the whole

 intelligence community--has been wrong about parity and wrong
 about virtually every great Soviet scientific and military
 advance since World War II?  What is your answer to that?
 Admiral Turner.       I think that that is an incorrect
 generalization.   I cannot imagine that the intelligence
 community, or the CIA,  has been wrong on every advance that
 the Soviets have made.
 Senator Proxmire.   Exactly the opposite has been my
 impression.   Of course the CIA has made mistakes; what
 institution does not make mistakes?   But at the same time,
 according to hindsight,  it would seem that you have been
 more accurate than the other agencies have been.
 Admiral Turner.   I believe we have been generally
 accurate and objective.
 As a military officer,  I have always valued the CIA
 estimates.
 Senator Proxmire.   Last year the JCS Chairman, General
 Brown,  said that our strategic targeting plans,  "to take
 Soviet civil defense into account," instead of targeting
 population per se,  are now targeting primarily Soviet
 military targets, command posts,  and military-related
 industry.
 If that is the case, do we need to be concerned about
 Soviet population protection measures, and if so, why?

 Admiral Turner.   To the extent that one considers that
 the Soviet Union's decision on whether or not to initiate
 strategic warfare takes into account what their population
 loss will be.
 Senator Proxmire.   So this may be a tipoff as to whether
 or not they are interested in a first strike?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir.
 Senator Proxmire.   But obviously,  if we are not shooting
 to kill people but to knock out military targets, command
 posts and military-related industries so they would have no
 military capability,  it is irrelevant whether they have
 shelters or evacuation plans,  isn't it?
 Admiral Turner.   Well, sir,  strategic nuclear warfare
 would not be so neat that you would get only the factories.
 Senator Proxmire. Of course.   That would not be our
 principal objective.
 Can you give us figures for total Soviet arms exports
 during the past five years?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes,  sir,  I am sure we can.   Can't
 Mr.  Diamond.   Yes,  sir.
 Senator Proxmire.     Would you get that to us for the
 record?
 Admiral Turner.   We would be pleased to do so, Senator
 Proxmire.

 This table reflects a substantial upward revision of the
 dollar value of Soviet arms exports and agreements in 1972-75
 made possible by new information on Soviet prices for major
 items of equipment.
 Senator Proxmire.   What is the confidence level of margin
 of error for the figures in that area?   Are the estimates
 reliable to within 10 percent, or to a factor of two or
 three--in the Soviet arms exports?
 Mr.  Diamond.   Yes, sir.   We will make that a part of
 the record, too, Senator. I cannot answer that right now.
 Senator Proxmire.   All right.
 COMMITTEE INSERT
 Soviet delivery values are considered to be reliable
 within 20 percent.   In fact, they should be considered

 a minimum figure;  undetected shipments of weapons systems
 and related equipment and unknown additional price increases
 could raise the total values by as much as 20 percent.
 Senator Proxmire. Does the latest information suggest
 that at the present time they are exporting more.   What
 does your most recent data indicate?
 Mr.  Diamond.   I think the facts are that it has levelled
 off.   There is a change in the mix, a change in the compo-
 sition.
 Admiral Turner.   There is another point that I have
 asked to have studied very carefully, Senator, and that
 is the difference between aid agreements and aid deliveries.
 Generally speaking;  their deliveries are considerably
 behind their commitments.
 Senator Proxmire.   Do the estimates include spare
 parts, military. construction,  supporting equipment, and
 supporting services,  as well as weapons?   -
 Admiral Turner. Let me check on that, Senator, and
 answer later if I may.
 COMMITTEE INSERT
 The data on Soviet military deliveries include military
 hardware  (land armaments,  aircraft, missile systems,  and
 naval boats);  support equipment such as radar,  communications

 gear,  and vehicles;  and an estimated allowance to cover
 ammunition, spare parts,  and unidentifiable support items
 that normally are received by military forces.   Excluded
 are the costs of military construction,  training, technical
 assistance, and supply operations.   While this aspect of
 the Soviet program is relatively small,  it could increase
 delivery levels by 10-15 percent annually.

 Senator Proxmire.   Would you agree that Soviet weapons
 possess less sustainability and reliability than U.S.
 weapons?      For example, is it correct that Soviet logistics
 are not too good,        that they do not have good turn-around
 capabilities,  that they have a kind of throw-away philosophy
 with regard to many of their combat units and weapons?
 Admiral Turner.   I am reluctant to go quite that far.
 There are lots of elements to logistics.   In terms of
 quantity I think there is evidence in Europe,  for instance,
 that Soviet logistics are not bad, particularly in the
 Warsaw Pact arena.
 Senator Proxmire.   What about reliability?
 Admiral Turner.   Soviet equipment tends to be more
 simplistic in design than is ours, but it is generally
 reliable for the purpose for which it is intended.
 Senator Proxmire.   How about turn-around capabilities?
 Admiral Turner.   By turn-around, do you mean if it is
 broken down, can they repair it and bring it back again?
 Senator Proxmire.   That's right.
 Admiral Turner.   I don't really have a specific
 opinion on that.   I will try to see what we can give you.
 Sayre, did you want to say something?

 Dr.  Stevens.   Well,  as the Director mentioned,      their
 design is often focused on simplicity.
 Senator Proxmire.   That should be helpful to them.
 Dr. Stevens.    Yes, indeed.   It often is.   The very
 lack of sophistication in Soviet equipment makes many
 items easy to repair by relatively unskilled personnel.
 Senator Proxmire.   Would you agree that due to the
 lack of precision engineering and quality control in their
 defense production that there is a likelihood that many
 of their weapons will not fire?   Do they have a serious
 reliability problem in that sense?
 Admiral Turner.   I would not be willing to agree with
 that right off hand,  Senator.   Their equipment is in many
 cases more elementary than ours, but it usually does the
 job.
 Senator Proxmire.   Have analyses of Soviet weapons
 such as the MIG-25 disclosed problems of sustainability
 or reliability, or any other problems concerning the
 quality of production?
 Admiral Turner.   Sayre?
 Dr. Stevens.   The people who have looked at that equip-
 ment feel that if the design were taken one step further
 and a production engineering job were done on it,  it would

 Approved Fo Release 200 F83i1$S:t AJ   P80M001f.5A000500140002-3 88
 be possible to make it more effective and cheaper to pro-
 duce than is now the case.   The emphasis now is often on
 ease of production and the use of interchangeable parts.
 The ability to perform the design mission is never com-
 promised, however.
 Admiral Turner.   Overall,  Senator,  I have had the
 impression over the years that the Soviets could not main-
 tain their equipment in as high standards of year-round
 reliability as can we; but that if they knew when war was
 going to start,  they could peak at a very high level of
 readiness and reliability.
 Senator Proxmire.   Did the analysis of the MIG-25
 show it to be less technologically advanced and more
 expensive than we had thought it was?
 Admiral Turner.   I will ask Dr. Stevens to supplement
 my thoughts on this because he has been in on this in
 greater detail,  I am sure.   My reaction to your question
 is a qualified yes.   That is,  the internals of the airplane
 were not as sophisticated as they would have been had we
 designed the aircraft, but the overall capability is there.
 Sayre?
 Dr. Stevens.   That is right.   It is a design choice.
 Senator Proxmire.   That would increase its cost,
 wouldn't it?  My question was two-fold.   First,  it went
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165A000500140002-3
 Approved Fo Release 20 91yeANAs    -9P80M001f. A000500140002-3  89
 to the effectiveness of the weapon, of the MIG-25 and the
 technological advancement of the MIG-25;  second,  it went
 to the cost.
 You wouldn't say that it cost more, or that it
 probably performed reasonably well because of the redundancy
 they have built in at considerable cost, would you?
 Dr. Stevens.   That is right.   The use,  for example,
 of tubes in the electronics of that aircraft may have
 surprised some people.   The use of integrated circuits,
 of solid state stuff, would produce more reliable electronics,
 and probably cheaper electronics--if that were the only
 comparison to be made.
 Senator Proxmire. Do you mean that they are still
 using vacuum tube technology?
 Dr. Stevens.   There was vacuum tube technology in the
 MIG-25.
 Admiral Turner. But there were other things, such as
 steel,  in it,  too, right?
 Dr. Stevens.   Right, stainless steel instead of
 titanium.
 Admiral Turner.   Of course, working titanium is
 frightfully more expensive, but it gives you a real   payoff
 in performance.   This is true today,,  so you can imagine
 the differences in cost when the MIG-25 was designed--1961-
 1963.

 Senator Proxmire.   I have only a few questions on China.
 To what extent was the poor performance in China due
 to earthquakes and other natural disasters, and would there
 have been growth but for the natural disasters?
 Admiral Turner.   Would you tackle that one, Mike?
 Mr. Field.   Poor performance in China last year was
 due both to one-time factors and to longer-run ones.   The
 earthquake was certainly one of the most serious in the last
 century. It ranks with the great Tokyo earthquake of 1927.
 The loss of life was very severe, and it was in a highly
 industrialized area in North China.   The earthquake alone
 might have taken 1 to 2 percentage points off the rate of
 industrial growth.
 A second factor in the low rate of growth was the
 political disruption connected with the deaths of Chou and
 Mao and with the throwing out of Mao's widow and the rest
 of the "gang of four."   When we look at the output by
 province--those for which we have some information--we see
 a definite correlation between the degree of political
 disruption and the economic performance.   This is a second
 reason for the poor performance.
 Then there are long-run factors.   Problems in the
 allocation of investment over the last five to ten years
 resulted in bottlenecks.   The whole extractive industry is
 Approved For Release 2004/03/11 : CIA-RDP80M00165A000500140002-3
 Approved For; Release 20DUDI'RS:ILIA RDP80M001    000500140002-3 91
 underdeveloped.   For example,  the demand for nonferrous
 metals for which they have ores is higher than their ability
 to produce.   So they have had to import,  to spend hard
 currency to import nonferrous metals.
 In the iron and steel industry,  emphasis has been too
 much on the crude steel capacity and not enough on the
 iron ore extraction or rolling.   So,   these problems in
 the allocation of investment have created bottlenecks.
 The last factor I would say that is a long-run factor
 is productivity.   There has been very little improvement
 in the wages or the standard of living for the industrial
 labor force.   In times of political disruption, when the
 Chinese workers have had a chance to express their opinions,
 they have demanded higher wages.   This dissatisfaction
 with wages, of course, gets translated into poor morale
 and low productivity.
 So,  the poor performance is therefore a combination
 of the earthquake and the political disruption that are
 one-time,  short-term factors,  and then of various under-
 lying problems,                       such as allocation of investment and problems
 of handling incentives.
 Senator Proxmire.   Thank you very much.
 It would seem that the Chinese represent a very, very
 powerful force on the continent around China, particularly

 in Korea and in Vietnam and other parts of the Asian land
 mass, but that they are of virtually no military significance
 elsewhere.   That is just my instinct in view of their size
 and in view of the kind of force that they have.
 You conclude that the Chinese rely  on copies of Soviet
 weapons developed in the 1950's.   Would you summarize to
 what extent Chinese aircraft, missiles,  ships, and ground
 equipment are basically copies of Soviet designs of the
 1950's.
 Admiral Turner.   They are very largely copies of those.
 They are about 20 years behind
 the Soviet Union,  let alone ourselves,  technologically,
 isn't that so?
 Admiral Turner.   Yes, I would say 15 to 20 years.
 Dr. Stevens.   They have,  for example, built a fighter
 aircraft,  a Chinese version of the MIG-21, which is in
 very limited production.
 Senator Proxmire.   When was the MIG-21 first built
 in the Soviet Union? Was it in the 1950's?
 Dr. Stevens.   It was the late 1950's.
 Senator Proxmire.   And China's MIG-21 is in only limited
 production?   It is evidently not a great success.
 Dr.  Stevens.  That's right.
 On the other hand,  they apparently have built a nuclear
 submarine and they are capable of production advanced radars.

 But in general, when it comes to aircraft,  ships,  and
 so on, what they have done is taken the equipment that the
 Soviets gave them before the break and improved upon it.
 But it is equipment of older Soviet design.
 Admiral Turner.   But they are developing their own
 strategic rocket force,  their own intercontinental missile
 force. They are doing that on their own.
 Senator Proxmire. Admiral and gentlemen,   thank you all
 very, very much.   I want to echo what other members of this
 committee have said and I want to emphasize it.   You have
 done a superlative job.   This has been a very, very fine
