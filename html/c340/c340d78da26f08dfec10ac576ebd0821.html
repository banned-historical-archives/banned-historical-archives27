 Georgy Arbatov's long article in Pravda last week has been touted privately by
 several Soviets as a very important statement. The full text of the article is now
 available and is noteworthy for its concern about political trends in the US. It
 reiterates Moscow's commitment to greater cooperation, especially in the area of
 arms control, while blaming Washington for current bilateral difficulties, and is
 specifically critical of the Ford administration.
 In discussing the article with US embassy contacts, some of Arbatov's
 colleagues, unlike Arbatov himself, have privately acknowledged the serious damage
 Angola has inflicted on US-Soviet relations. These same sources have nevertheless
 called attention to the "positive" tone of Arbatov's article and the significance of its
 appearance in Pravda, contrasting it with the attitude of "some" in Moscow who are
 less sanguine about current trends than Arbatov and these sources.
 Arbatov's analysis of the recent course of US-Soviet relations is familiar fare:
 The ideological struggle between the two nations must and will continue, but much
 has been done to lessen the threat of nuclear war. Arbatov credits a changing
 correlation of world forces with prompting favorable changes in US foreign policy.
 He notes signs of backsliding in Washington, however, under the pressures generated
 by US economic and political problems and the realities of the US presidential
 campaign. In undisguised criticism of President Ford, Arbatov attacks the concept of
 "peace through strength" as reminiscent of cold war attitudes. He warns that
 concessions made during a political campaign may persist beyond the elections,
 "sometimes creating serious difficulties."
 Arbatov analyzes recent US foreign policy setbacks (he mentions Southeast
 Asia, Portugal, "miscalculations in the eastern Mediterranean," and Angola) as being
 the result of wrong-headed policies in Washington, rather than of any communist
 intrigues. Referring to the inevitability of occasional reverses for both superpowers,
 he argues that "detente" must not be made a scapegoat. He said that for its part,
 Moscow never expected the path to be easy, but is determined to press ahead.
 Finally, Arbatov concludes his analysis by noting that current problems
 between the US and the USSR should not jeopardize the gains made in arms control.
 His message seems to be that progress can still be made despite other setbacks to the
 relationship. His stress on the continued need for arms control probably reflects
 genuine Soviet concern about strategic stability in a period of deteriorating relations
 and prolonged stalemate at SALT.

 Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey, the only cabinet minister from
 Wilson's government that Prime Minister Callaghan has asked to stay on, yesterday
 announced  a  mildly reflationary  budget that reaffirms the government's
 commitment to reducing inflation through the social contract.
 The budget, which entails a $22-billion deficit in the fiscal year running
 through March 1977, calls for selective tax cuts if the trade unions accept tougher
 wage controls.
 Included in Healey's tax package are unconditional tax relief measures-aimed
 largely at the elderly, children, and widows-as well as a few minor investment aids.
 Revenue losses from the tax cuts will be partly offset by higher excise taxes on
 alcohol, cigarettes, and gasoline. Personal income growth from an expanding
 economy is expected to provide a higher base to tax, increasing the overall revenue
 take.
 The largest part of the tax relief, however, is contingent on labor's acceptance
 of an annual limit on wage increases of about 3-percent. The Chancellor is expected
 to have a hard time selling this to the unions. He may have to accept a higher pay
 limit with less tax relief. Under current guidelines, wage increases have averaged 10
 percent.
 In addition, Healey has scheduled a 13-percent increase in government spending
 in the fiscal year ending in March 1977. The projected increase is down sharply from
 the 29-percent rise registered last year; in real terms, it represents almost no change.
 Fulfilling his side of the government's agreement with the unions, Healey plans
 to increase the temporary employment subsidy from $18.50 to $37.00 per week.
 Pensions are also to be increased, at a budget cost of $740 million.
 Healey emphasized that economic recovery must be based on the expansion of
 exports and import substitution rather than on massive government spending. He
 ruled out the prolonged use of import controls as a means of solving Britain's
 problems, but indicated the government might use selective controls.
 Reaction to Healey's budget speech was mixed. Len Murray, general secretary
 of the Trades Union Congress, objected to a 3-percent pay limit on the grounds that
 it is inflexible and does not take pay differentials into account. Margaret Thatcher,
 head of the Conservative Party, objected to the conditional nature of the tax cuts
 and to the large role that the unions play in deciding on tax cuts that affect the
 majority.
 The Confederation of British Industry and the London stock market reacted
 positively to Healey's proposals. F777          I

 The Italian Socialist Party is maneuvering to bring down Prime Minister Moro's
 Christian Democratic minority government. The Socialists are demanding either an
 early  parliamentary election or the replacement of Moro by an emergency
 government that would involve a limited but formal role for the Communists in
 national policy-making.
 The clash in parliament last week over legalized abortion provided the catalyst
 for the Socialist initiative. The Socialists had been trying to introduce abortion upon
 demand within the first 90 days of pregnancy. The Christian Democrats, however,
 joined neo-fascist parliamentarians to pass narrowly an amendment that would
 permit abortion only in a limited number of circumstances.
 The Socialists were infuriated not only by the substance of the amendment but
 by the Christian Democrats' tactic of using neo-fascist votes to win their point.
 Despite the neo-fascists' position as Italy's fourth largest party, they are normally
 viewed as political pariahs by all of the other parties. The pivotal role that the
 Christian  Democrats allowed  the neo-fascists to  play in the abortion vote
 undoubtedly strengthened the Socialists' conviction that they get nothing in return
 for their support of the Moro government.
 Parliamentary debate on abortion has been suspended until next week. The
 Christian Democrats are trying to patch things up, but the Socialists are in no mood
 to compromise.
 A meeting of the Socialist directorate yesterday revealed strong sentiment in
 favor of either an early parliamentary election or an emergency government open to
 some kind of Communist involvement. The directorate gave Socialist chief De
 Martino a mandate to consult with major political and labor leaders to solicit their
 views on how to deal with a broad range of problems facing the country.
 The Socialist tactic is seemingly designed to demonstrate that Moro's minority
 government is too weak to shape a consensus on economic and other policies. By
 consulting others, the Socialists are trying to spread the blame in the event the
 government does collapse.
 De Martino said after meeting last night with Prime Minister Moro and
 Christian Democratic leader Zaccagnini that the Socialists and Christian Democrats
 remain far apart on the abortion question but that further attempts would be made
 to reach an agreement. De Martino is scheduled to meet today with Communist
 chief Berlinguer.

 Interior Minister Fraga remains optimistic about prospects for the government's
 liberalization program despite strong challenges from both left and right.
 Fraga told Ambassador Stabler on April 5 that the reforms would not be
 derailed by the formation of an opposition front. He affirmed that there was no
 serious friction within the cabinet and specifically denied a divergence of views
 between himself and Foreign Minister Areilza. Areilza was rumored last week to
 have threatened resignation over the arrests of some Communist members of the
 opposition front.
 The interior minister also claimed that Prime Minister Arias-though concerned
 about the effect of liberalization on the right-had accepted the government's
 program and would defend it. Arias' minor role in recent weeks has been due in part
 to poor health, Fraga said, but the Prime Minister would soon address the nation on
 television to outline the government's accomplishments and objectives. He would
 also personally defend the key law on political associations in an appearance before
 a parliamentary committee.
 Fraga seemed confident that parliament would act without delay on the various
 reform measures already submitted by the cabinet. He did not say when he expected
 the bills to be passed, but the process could take one or two months. The interior
 minister was instrumental in formulating the government's reform program and may
 be overly optimistic about its prospects.
 The government has recently run into stiff conservative opposition to its plan
 to move quickly on labor reform in hopes of heading off opposition attempts to stir
 up labor unrest this month that would culminate in massive demonstrations on May
 1.
 Far rightists entrenched in the leadership of the Spanish Syndical Organization
 showed their muscle recently by electing a staunchly conservative falangist to fill a
 vacancy on the Council of the Realm instead of selecting the new reform-minded
 secretary general of the syndicates as tradition dictated. This was followed by sharp
 criticism of the minister for the syndicates for proposing reforms in line with recent
 worker demands and a blunt warning to him that reforms cannot be imposed from
 above by appointed government officials.
 The government has apparently backed down on its plan for early action and
 now will reportedly concentrate on the syndical congress, which will probably be
 held in July. The congress will be bigger and more representative than ever before,
 and the government, armed by then with the results of a survey of grass-roots
 s ndical opinion. hopes to be able to ram its reforms through the congress.

 The Soviets continue to play down the significance of Cairo's abrogation of the
 Soviet-Egyptian friendship treaty in discussions with Western officials.
 Y. D. Pyrlin, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official responsible for Middle East
 matters, recently told a British official that the abrogation only formalized an
 existing situation.
 The Soviet official said that although relations might be sour "for several
 years," Moscow expects them to improve eventually. He even held out the prospect
 for eventual rapprochement with President Sadat. Pyrlin said that Moscow's friends
 in Egypt are encouraging the Soviets to maintain their economic aid program to
 provide an opening for better political ties.
 The Soviet ambassador in Cairo told US Ambassador Eilts on Monday that the
 USSR had no plans to withdraw Soviet "technical" advisers now in Egypt. Moscow,
 he added, was prepared to sign the trade agreement the two sides negotiated last
 year. He predicted this would probably take place in late April or early May.
 Soviet public comments, on the other hand, are designed to promote Egyptian
 apprehensions about future Soviet actions and to raise doubts as to the wisdom of
 Sadat's actions. This theme originally appeared in Moscow's formal protest note to
 Cairo last week, and since then has received prominent play in the Soviet press.
 Moscow media have refuted Egyptian charges that the USSR was niggardly
 with economic and military assistance, and have hit hard on the idea that Sadat's
 ill-conceived economic policies would eventually prove his undoing.
 The USSR's protest prompted charges of Soviet meddling from the Egyptian
 press and public figures. In a gesture that received wide domestic publicity, Egyptian
 officials refused to accept the Soviet note.
 This bravado notwithstanding, the failure by the Egyptians to publicize all of
 the specifics in Moscow's rebuttal suggests they are concerned that the Soviet
 attacks might fall on some receptive ears.

 The strong showing by the four major parties in Sunday's election may indicate
 a trend toward a less fragmented political system and increase the prospects for a
 more stable government.
 The complete, but still unofficial, results of the election show that only four
 parties gained more than 10 seats. The previous parliament had nine parties with 10
 or more seats.
 The Democrat Party, by winning 115 seats, may be in a position to head a
 coalition. Speculation in Bangkok so far has centered on a coalition of the
 Democrats with the Social Justice Party or the Thai Nation party.
 Only 140 votes are required to defeat a no-confidence motion, and, with 115
 seats, the Democrats' leadership should be in a strong bargaining position in
 apportioning cabinet portfolios among rival personalities and parties. If factionalism
 does not become a problem within the Democrat Party, a coalition with any of the
 larger parties and one or two small ones should be much less vulnerable to defections
 than the outgoing coalition, which includes some 17 parties.
 The election results show a clear swing away from the left. Leftist parties held
 37 seats in the previous National Assembly, but on Sunday, the leftists were only
 able to elect six candidates. The swing reflects voter reaction against leftist-instigated
 unrest over the past year. It was also encouraged by a strong right-wing campaign of
 intimidation against leftist electioneers and army-backed measures to stack the odds
 in favor of conservatives.
 Democrat Party leader Seni Parmot, the apparent choice to form a new
 government, has stated that he would not include any leftists in his coalition. This
 should please the military, which was concerned that leftists would be allowed in
 Khukrit's coalition. The military will likely be more disposed to accept a coalition
 including either the Social Justice Party or the Thai Nation Party, both of which
 enjoy strong military backing.
 Whatever its precise structure, the new government probably will be more
 pro-Western than its predecessor and will place greater value on relations between
 Thailand and the US. The new government may also be more determined to
 eliminate dissident activity and internal unrest and violence.

 Chinese radicals during the past month have broadened their offensive against
 policies associated with Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping by attacking his program for
 modernizing the military, although thus far no changes are observable. The radicals
 have generally confined their attacks on military policy to wall posters, avoiding
 press discussion of this sensitive matter.
 At issue is Central Directive 18 which was approved last summer and calls for
 greater efforts to upgrade China's conventional forces. The posters charge that the
 directive overemphasizes military proficiency and that Teng sought to reduce the
 political influence of important military figures in the provinces.
 Indeed, Teng worked hard over the past three years to remove the military
 from civilian politics and to curb their political power generally. These posters are
 evidently a radical attempt to capitalize on the military's disaffection.
 In addition to rotating regional and district commanders from their bases of
 power and replacing them with civilians, Teng "rehabilitated" and promoted to
 important positions in Peking a number of military men whose long advocacy of
 rapid modernization of China's military establishment and arsenal had in many cases
 led to their purge early in the Cultural Revolution-at the very time that regional
 and local officers were beginning to assume great administrative and political
 responsibilities. The regional commanders could have seen this rehabilitation as a
 threat to their influence within the army.
 Posters criticizing Teng for claiming the army was ill-prepared for combat seem
 designed to exploit any latent resentment against Teng for pursuing such tactics. In
 fact, the charge that Teng overemphasized military proficiency calls into question
 important aspects of Directive 18.
 On the other hand, plans are moving ahead to convene a national conference on
 defense industries in the near future. These plans were set in motion in late
 February, suggesting that military priorities relating to modernization have not yet
 changed appreciably. In fact, local and regional commanders almost certainly would
 be pleased to see their weapons arsenal upgraded and expanded-if this was not

 Aside from the modernization issue, there have been wall poster attacks on
 other aspects of Teng's policies toward the military. One of the most significant
 charges is that Tend monopolized control of the army. This seems to be an attempt
 to win over those who opposed his appointment as army chief of staff, the first
 civilian ever named to this post.
 Although the evidence is sparse, the criticisms thus far do not seem to have had
 much impact. Important military figures, particularly in the provinces, have shown
 little enthusiasm for the campaign against Teng. Most of the officer corps favor
 Teng's efforts to upgrade the army's fighting capability. Others may not be
 completely satisfied with Teng, but in the long run are likely to find a less agreeable
 alternative in the radicals. As for those army officers whose sympathies lie with the
 radicals, their views probably paralleled the wall poster criticism, but they otherwise
 still seem to be keeping their heads down. F77           I        25X1
 A crowd of about: 4,000 Greek Cypriots marched on the US embassy in Nicosia
 on April 6 to protest the signing of the US-Turkish Defense Cooperation Agreement.
 Most of the demonstrators remained behind police barracades, but a group of
 about 600 stoned the embassy. Despite stepped-up police protection, a handful of
 demonstrators entered the embassy grounds and replaced the US flag with Greek
 and Cypriot flags.
 The Cypriot government had hoped to prevent any violence. The Cypriot
 police, who used barricades and tear gas, had firm orders that the embassy was to be
 protected. Cypriot National Guard officers were ordered to assist the police if
 necessary.
 Opposition to the defense agreement is growing among the Greek military. In
 addition to the government's suspension of base negotiations with the US, Athens
 has withdrawn from a scheduled joint naval exercise. The Greek navy has also
 refused to approve visits of US naval ships to Greek ports. It is not clear, however,
 how long the prohibition will last, and at least one exception has already been made.
 In addition, the Greek ambassador to NATO reportedly has said that the defense
 agreement will not affect Greece's upcoming negotiations with NATO, but indicated
 that the US base negotiations will be seriously affected.

 The austerity program outlined last Friday by Argentina's new civilian
 economics minister is a comprehensive package of tough measures designed to slow
 galloping inflation, curb widespread  illegal  economic activities, and provide
 investment incentives. It promises radical fiscal reform-including sharp cuts in
 government employment and efficient operation of state enterprises-and stresses
 production, profits, and an increased role for private enterprise. The program
 includes steps to revive the agricultural sector and to promote exports.
 Although less explicit about foreign relations than about the domestic
 economy, the minister outlined plans to repeal the restrictive foreign investment law
 of 1973 that has kept foreign capital from entering Argentina. Plans also call for an
 early  settlement of outstanding  nationalization cases  involving  mainly  US
 companies, and an approach to international monetary authorities for aid in
 covering the country's estimated $1.4-billion foreign exchange gap as soon as the
 government can show actual economic progress.
 One aspect of the domestic program may lead to an early showdown with
 labor. A decree signed Friday terminates the present price controls and permits
 businessmen to raise prices to profitable levels in order to encourage investments,
 which have been stagnating. A similar lifting of price controls last July caused prices
 to skyrocket. Labor demanded and got massive wage hikes, fanning the inflation and
 torpedoing the government's stabilization effort.
 Because the military government has reserved the right to determine wage
 increases, it can break the price-wage spiral. If labor resentment is strong enough to
 require severe government repression, however, an important element in the
 recovery  program-rapidly increased production-will be undermined and the
 recovery rate greatly slowed.
 The new military government's success in reversing the economic decline of the
 last several months will depend largely on maintaining the tacit cooperation it has
 had from most of the population since assuming power on March 24. Unless
 improvement is clearcut and rapid, cooperation could fade quickly, forcing the
 government to take more repressive measures. With dictatorial powers, government
 leaders will be able, at least for a time, to enforce programs even against considerable
 opposition, but it will be unable to guarantee success.
