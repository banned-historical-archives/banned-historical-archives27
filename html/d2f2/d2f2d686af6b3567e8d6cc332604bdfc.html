 INDOCHINA
 Vietnamese communist propaganda on the U.S. antiwar protests seizes
 on the mass arrests in Washington on 3 and 4 May as evidence of
 President Nixon's "obduracy" in pursuing the war and "repression"
 of peaceable citizens who demand a deadline for withdrawal of U.S.
 troops from South Vietnam.  A notably abusive article in the DRV
 army's QUAN DOI NHAN DAN calls the police ac;.ions, taken in "panic,"
 an exposure of the President's "fascist, cruel. face."  The
 President's televised press conference of 29 April was pictured as
 an attempt to thwart the antiwar protests, and Hanoi radio said the
 President "brazenly declared" that neither the demonstrations in
 the streets nor the opposition in Congress %rill make him change his
 Vietnam policy.
 Hanoi propagandists continue to take issue with President Nixon's
 insistence that there cannot be a total U.S. troop wi.thdrewal until
 prisoners are released.  There is no acknowledgment of the allie4
 proposals--cited by the President on the 29th--for the immediate
 release of sick and wounded and the transfer of some prisoners to
 a neutral country.  Instead, the media highlight what is called
 the DRV's "new initiative" at the Paris session of the 29th for
 immediate discussion of a withdrawal deadline so that the question
 of releasing prisoners can be taken up.
 Routine Moscow comment on the antiwar demonstrations says the
 President is becoming more isolated as opposition to the war
 increases.  Particular note is taken of calls in Congress for a
 troop-withdrawal deadline, and Moscow gives prompt pro forma
 support to the DRV "initiative" of the 29th.
 Peking's propaganda on the U.S. protests is confined to reportage
 which focuses on the authorities' "brutal suppression" of the
 demonstrators but refrains from extensive personal abuse of the
 President.
 Peking marks the first anniversary of the founding'of Sihanouk's
 Royal Government of National Union--announced 5 May 1970--with a
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial and a greetings message from Chou En-lai
 to Premier Penn Nouth.  Moscow thus far has ignored the anniversary,
 in keeping with its failure to recognize the Sihanouk government.
 it has been giving low-level publicity to a "solidarity week" mark-
 ing the first anniversary of the U.S. incursion into Cambodia.
 HANOI, FRONT ASSAIL PRESIDENT'S "REPRESSION" OF DEMONSTRATORS
 Vietnamese communist media at first carried largely routine reports
 of the daily ev'-nts in the antiwar demonstrations in Washington.

 But following the mass arrests on 3 and 4 May, there is a
 barrage of propaganda holding the President responsible for
 the "repression" of the demonstrators:  VNA on the 5th
 carried a message of "sympathy" from the Vietnam Committee
 for Solidarity with the American People, and Hanoi radio
 has broadcast articles from both the party paper KHAN DAN
 and the army or,-,,an QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.
 Earlier VNA reports had taken :cote of the demonstrators'
 aim, on the 3d and 4th, of obstructing traffic in Washington
 in order to bring government operations to a standstill, but
 this objective is obscured in the propaganda attacking the
 President.  QUAN DOI NHAN DAN is the most abusive when it
 declares:  "Nixon's fascist, cruel face was again exposed
 completely.  Panic-stricken by the protest movement which is
 mounting and spreading throughout the United States, Nixon
 used policemen and military forces to ruthlessly repress and
 terrorize the defenseless peace-loving Americans."  Both
 papers report that 7,000 people were arrested, and NHAN DAN
 observes that "hundreds" were wounded.  The party paper says
 that from California the President called the Washington
 police chief and ordered that he "take rescute measures" to
 cope with the protesters.  It notes that "brothers Davis and
 Hoffman, Dr. Benjamin Spock, and many other demonstration
 leaders" were arrested, but it adds that the demonstrators
 were not deterred and that they held aloft the PRG flag and
 chanted "Hail to Ho Chi Minh!  The NFLSV will certainly win."
 The propaganda pictures the President as increasingly
 isolated and on the defensive but inflexible in his pursuit
 of "aggression."  The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article of 5 May
 says that at his 29 April news conference "Nixon brazenly
 stated that he was not intimidated at all, that his govern-
 ment would continue to advance on the bellicose, dictatorial
 path, and that demonstrators who infringed the law would be
 appropriately dealt with."  The army paper adds that on
 1 May "on Nixon's orders" tens of thousands of U.S. tt?oops,
 along with the police, began preparing for a counteroffensive
 against the "honest, peace-loving Americans."  Earlier
 reaction to the President's press conference had pictured it
 as an attempt to thwart the antiwar movement, and two Hanoi
 radio broadcasts on the 30th reported the President as having
 "brazenly declared that neither the demonstrations in the
 streets nor the opposition in Congress will make him change
 his Vietnam policy."  ;?.uch of the propaganda, including the

 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article of the 5th, notes the President's
 frequent public appearances in which he has tried to "Justify"
 his Vietnam policy.
 The propaganda has repeatedly stresses: the diverse nature of
 the demonstrators, and a NHAN DAN commentary of 3 May says the
 massive demonstration in Washington on 24 April "will go down
 in the history of the United States as the greatest of its
 kind in composition, strength, and mettle."  The earlier
 demonstrations of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War are
 also cited, as evidence of disaffection among servicemen.
 Both Hanoi and Front media report that U.S. troops in Saigon
 demonstrated on 28 April and that they handed out leaflets
 which, among other things, expressed support for the current
 demonstrations in the United States.  A 3 May Hanoi radio
 commentary says the demonstrations in Saigon "have further
 motivated antiwar actions among the U.S. military ranks in
 South Vietnam" and have also "influenced the thoughts and
 feelings of the puppet soldiers and officers."
 On 2 May, Liberation Radio carried a message from a group of
 captured U.S. servicemen, described as "against the war,"
 welcoming the reported GI antiwar demonstrations in Saigon.
 The message recalls that the 26 April PLAF Command order*
 specified that the Liberation forces will not attack GI's
 who oppose the war.  The PLAF order was also recalled in a
 speech at a meeting held by the South Vietnam Committee for
 Solidarity with the American People.  Liberation Radio
 reported on the 29th that the meeting took place "in a
 liberated area in South Vietnam," but it gave no date.  DRV
 media on the 26th had reported a meeting in Hanoi that
 evening of its Committee for Solidarity with the American
 People.  In remarks broadcast by Liberation Radio on the
 30th, the vice chairman of the Solidarity Committee recalled
 the PLAF's 26 April instructions on attitudes to be taken
 toward U.S. servicemen who oppose the war.  The speaker also
 reportedly called antiwar activities of U.S. veterans "the
 first important step of the antiwar movement of U.S. troops."

 ALLIED PROPOSALS ON POW'S IGNORED; DRV "INITIATIVE" HAILED
 While comment on the President's press conference stresses his
 linking of a U.S. troop presence in South V.etnam with the
 POW's, it ignores most of his specific remarks on the prisoner
 issue, including his reference to allied priposals made in
 Paris that day.  Similarly, Vietnamese communist accounts of
 the 29 April Paris session obscure the allied proposals;
 instead, communist media highlight what is called the DRV
 delegate's "new specific proposal."  According to the VNA
 account, Xuar. Thuy's "concrete proposal" was that the U.S.
 representative set "a reasonable time limit" for a total
 U.S. troop withdrawal to be considered by the parties
 "immediately today," so that they could then discuss the
 problem of releasing captured military men.'
 VNA charges that the U.S. delegate "dodged this concrete
 proposal."  Regarding the allied delegates' speeches, VNA
 says only that they "still resorted to perfidious contentions
 about the so-called prisoner-of-war problem" and that the.
 Vietnamese communist delegates "exposed the U.S.-puppet dark
 scheme."  (Ambassador Bruce proposed that POW canes in both
 North and South Vietnam be open to inspection by international
 humanitarian organizations or third party governments to be
 agreed upon by both sides.  GVN delegate Lam.recalled his
 government's 26 January proposal concerning the repatriation
 of sick and wounded prisoners and its 8 April offer to transfer
 prisoners held captive for a long period of time to a neutral
 country.  Lam also asked the North Vietnamese to propose
 adequate measures for the release of the sick and injured and
 to suggest their choice of a neutral government.)
 *  The communist delegates at the Paris sessions have routinely
 reiterated the PRG proposal that the United States announce
 its agreement to withdraw all troops by 30 June 1971 so that
 the parties can discuss "at once" the question of guaranteeing
 the safety of the withdrawing forces and the release of all
 captured military men.  Sporadically, as at the last three
 sessions, they have indicated that if the United States does
 not find that date agreeable, it.should "set another reasonable
 date to be considered by the other parties."

 Hanoi media have been at some pains to call attention to Xuan
 Thuy's 29 April "initiative" and to obscure the President's
 press conference remarks that day as well as his subsequent
 proposal that some of the POW's be transferred to Sweden.
 Thus, Xuan Thuy's "new specific proposal that the parties
 immediately discuss a time limit" for total U.S. withdrawal
 has been repeated in the DRV Paris spokesman's 30 April
 statement--carried by VNA on 1 May--on the President's press
 conference; in another VNA item on 1 May accusing the Nixon
 Administration of using the POW question for "propaganda"
 purposes; and in a 4 May statement by the DRV spokesman in
 Paris, carried by VNA on the 5th.  This latter statement
 postdates the President's suggestion of a transfer of
 prisoners to Sweden; however, it is described merely as
 having been made "in connection with the Nixon Administration's
 references to the so-called question of prisoners."  Completely
 obscuring the allied stand, the DRV spokesman complained that
 the President and the U.S. delegation at Paris "have refused
 to respond positively to the DRV's specific proposal."  The
 spokesman also repeated the charge that "Nixon's raising the
 so-called prisoner-of-war question is nothing but a maneuver
 to cover up the Administration's crime of aggression and count-
 less war crimes and to justify its stubborn refusal to fix a
 reasonable time limit for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops."
 Hanoi and Front comment on the President's press conference .
 noted that even people in the United States do not support the
 Administration's position on prisoners.  Thus, Hanoi's initial
 reaction to the press conference in a radio broadcast on the
 30th said the President's "arrogant argument" that troops would
 remain in South Vietnam as long as U.S. prisoners were not
 released has been rejected by such men as Senators Muskie,
 vavits, and Stevenson, who have pointed out that the way to
 get U.S. prisoners released is to withdraw all troops.  On the
 same day Hanoi radio also cited Senator Mansfield as saying
 that the only correct way to settle the question is to set a
 troop-withdrawal deadline.
 A Hanoi radio broadcast to U.S. servicemen in South Vietnam
 on the 4th cited Senator Muskie as stating that the continued
 presence of U.S. troops in Southeast Asia will prolong the war,
 not speed the release of U.S. prisoners.  The broadcast also
 quoted Muskie as saying on the day after the President's press
 conference, "I can't recall a war in which prisoners have been
 exchanged before the war was settled."

 The initial 30 April Hanoi broadcast alone acknowledged that
 the President reiterated his five-point peace proposal of

 FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN AGAIN PROTESTS U1S, BOMBING OF DRV
 The latest in the continuing series of protests over U.S. air
 strikes by the DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman is a 29 April
 statement which scores action in Vinh Linh area and Ha Tinh
 Province.  It charges that from 21t to 27 April U.S. aircraft,
 including B-52's, bombed Huong Lap village, "north of the 17th
 parallel in the DMZ," and that U.S. planes bombed "a number of
 localities in Huong Khe district, Ha Tinh Province" on the
 28th.*  The protest says that the army and people of Ha Tinh,
 "fighting bravely," downed a U.S. plane.  The alleged downing
 had been reported promptly on the 28th by DRV media in reports
 which claimed that the total of downed U.S. planes now stood
 at 3,392.
 Routinely, the protest "energetically denounces and sternly
 condemns" the U.S. "acts of war" and demands an end to all
 encroachments on DRV sovereignty and security.  Xuan Thuy Ft
 the Paris session that day, as reported by VNA, "energetically
 protested" the recent "continuous dispatch" of U.S. planes to
 violate the DRV's airspace and bomb "a number of places on its
 territory."  He demanded that the Nixon Administration respect
 the U.S. commitment to "totally and unconditionally" stop all
 encroachments on DRV sovereignty and security.
 *  The U.S. Command in Saigon reported on the 29th that U.S.
 planes attacked missile and antiaircraft sites 85 and 115 miles
 northwest of the DMZ on the previous day, after they had been
 fired upon.

 MOSCOW REPORTS PROTESTS. PICTURES PRESIDENT AS UNRESPONSIVE
 Moscow deplores what it portrays as a failure on President Nixon's
 part to be swayed by the big U.S. antiwar demonstrations, but its
 treatment of the protests has been limited and almost entirely at
 the routine propaganda level.  The 30 April May Day editorial in
 PRAVDA did bring up the subject, but only briefly in the statement
 that "mass antiwar demonstrations, in which 750,000 people took
 part in Washington and San Francisco alone, have recently spread
 through the United States."  A commentary by Kozyakov in English
 on the 3d says the continuing demonstrations show that the
 "silent majority" on which the Administration relies for support
 has now spoken and is not supporting official policies; instead,
 the antiwar protesters demand a deadline for the withdrawal of
 U.S. troops.
 Limited, low-level Soviet reaction to the President's 29 April
 press conference stressed that he tried to "justify" and "explain"
 continued aggression in Indochina in the face of the growing
 antiwar demonstrations.  A domestic service broadcast on the 30th
 observed that the American public was "disappointed" at the
 President's stand--advocacy of a "tough line" in Indochina at a
 time when the antiwar campaign is going on all over the country.
 The initial TASS report of the press conference said the President
 was "compelled to admit" that the demonstrations were of a massive
 nature, but it added that his remarks that "lawbreakers would be
 prosecuted" contained an "unconcealed threat" to the demonstrators.
 TASS on 29 April also saw an effort at intimidation in the
 decision by the House Internal Security Committee to investigate
 organizations sponsoring the Washington demonstrations--the
 National Peace Action Coalition and the People's Coalition for
 Peace and Justice.
 Soviet media noted plans by the demonstrators to block traffic in
 Washington on 3 May and thereby close down the government.
 Subsequent reports acknowledged that the traffic arteries remained
 open but stressed police use of truncheons and tear gas.  TASS also
 noted the "record number" of more than 7,000 arrests, including
 the arrest of organizer Rennie Davis.  The domestic service on the
 3d cited press reports that the President--who remained in
 California--sent Police Chief Wilson a message instructing him
 to treat the demonstrators "fairly but firmly."  Moscow observed
 that the "firmness" was evident in the arrests and use of tear
 gas but that "fairness" was not to be found.

 OPPOSITION      A dispatch from IZVESTIYA's New York correspondent
 IN CONGRESS     Sturua, published in the paper on 29 April, took
 note of increasing Congressional opposition to the
 President's Indochina policies and concluded that the present
 "troubles" in the Capitol are symptomatic of the "storm" shaking
 the entire United States.  It is no coincidence, he said, that
 the "mutiny" in Congress coincides with the antiwar "spring
 offensive."  Documenting a shift of opinion in Congress against
 Administration policies, Sturua pointed out that Senators
 Church and Cooper have introduced a bill proclaiming as a
 "national objective" the total withdrawal of U.S. troops from
 Vietnam; that the Hatfield-McGovern bill calling for withdrawal
 before 31 December 1971 is getting increasing support in the
 Senate; and that Senator Hartke is sponsoring a resolution
 calling for immediate withdrawal.  Sturua also noted that in the
 House the Democrats passed a resolution to withdraw all troops
 by the end of 1972--the first time the Democratic majority has
 refused to support the President on the war.  Commenting that
 the approach of elections is whipping up the "infighting" all the
 more, Sturua said that the Democrats are making political.capital
 out of "Nixon's war" while the Republicans are preparing an
 "escape route."
 Moscow also continues to publicize statements by memLcrs of
 Congress critical of the President's Indochina policies.  On
 1 and 2 May TASS briefly reported remarks by Senators Fulbright
 and Muskie criticizing the President's refusal to set a with-
 drawal date.  TASS singled out Fulbright's comments on ABC's
 Issues and Answers, but it ignored his critical remarks on violent
 demonstrations.  TASS has also reported that more than 20 senators
 and representatives will take part in a nationvide "antiwar tour" to
 explain legislative proposals for fixing a deadline.
 POW ISSUE The 30 April Moscow domestic service account of
 President Nixon's press conference notes that in
 reply to a question the President said a contingent of troops
 would remain in South Vietnam for "an unlimited length of time,"
 but it does not acknowledge his  statement that the residual
 force would remain as long as the DRV holds U.S. POW's and until
 South Vietnam can defend itself.
 Moscow's reports fail to acknowledge the exchange at the press
 conference in which the President criticized the DRV's stand on
 POW's and pointed to the allied offer at the Paris conference
 that day to repatriate sick and wounded DRV prisoners and send

 others to a neutral country.  However, Moscow has commented
 favorably on the "new initiative" of the communists at the
 29 April Paris session in which they again offered to discuss
 the release of prisoners if the United States agreed to a
 troop-withdrawal deadline.  A TASS commentary by Kharkov on
 30 April and a Glazunov foreign-language radio commentary on
 3 May praise the "constructive" initiative and criticize the
 United States for dismissing it as "nothing new."  The U.S.
 "who-cares attitude" toward the Paris talks and "negative
 reaction" to all DRV and PRG proposals, Glazunov says, amount
 to the position of a "persistent aggressor" who aspires to
 victory on the battlefield.
 PEKING DEPICTS ADMINISTRATION RUNNING "SCARED" BEFORE PROTESTS
 While continuing to spare President Nixon extensive personal
 abuse, Peking's reportage on the U.S. antiwar demonstrations--
 at the Capitol, the Pentagon, Selective Service headquarters,
 and the Justice Department--portrays a wave of brutal police
 and military repression undertaken by a frightened U.S.
 Administration.  The Chinese reports picture a massive influx
 of demonstrators undaunted by repression and determined to
 continue to make themselves heard.
 The "scared Nixon Administration hurriedly called out large
 numbers of police and troops for brutal suppression," NCNA
 said on 4 May, and a "scared" President Nixon "came out himself
 on 29 April threatening to 'punish' the demonstrators if they
 refused to 'obey the law.'"  The NCNA item did not specifically
 mention the President's press conference, however.  It added
 that the demonstrators camping in West Potomac Park were
 forcibly dispersed by "helmeted police armed with truncheons"
 and that "nearly 1,500 persons had been arbitrarily arrested
 earlier in the week."  Underscoring the demonstrators' resolve
 to "carry on the struggle," NCNA quoted one protest leader to
 the effect that "the police atrocity 'in no way stops our
 plans.'"
 LE DUAN REMAINS IN USSR AS OTHER DRV DELEGATES DEPART

 reported his "recent" visit to Sebastopol, where Moscow had
 said he had arrived on 25 April.  There are no available
 mentions of his whereabouts since then.  His stay of more
 than a month in the USSR is unusual; his past visits to the
 USSR, for the 23d CPSU Congress in March-April 1966 and for
 the Lenin centenary in April-May 1970, each lasted about
 three weeks.
 Nguyen Duy Trinh, a member of Le Duan's delegation to the
 24th CPSU Congress, went on to Sofia to attend the Bulgarian
 party congress and left Bulgaria for home on 27 April via
 Moscow and Peking.  According to TASS and VNA, Kosygin
 received Trinh on the 29th for talks on the Indochina
 situation and on "further development of the all-round fraternal
 cooperation between the USSR and the DRV."  VNA reports that
 he stopped in Peking on 1 May, and NCNA reported his departure
 "for home" on the 3d.  There is no available indication that
 Trinh conferred with top Chinese leaders.
 The leader of the NLHS delegation to the CPSU congress, Kaysone
 Phomvihan, went home from Moscow via Peking without attending
 the Bulgarian congress.  While in Peking he was received by
 Chou En-lai and attended Sihanouk's 25 April banquet marking
 the first anniversary of the Indochinese people's summit
 conference, after which he visited cities in southzrn China.
 NCNA reported on 30 April that he left "for home" from
 Nanning.
 Nguyen Van Hieu, who led the FRG delegation to both the CPSU
 and Bulgarian congresses, was reported by the Sofia radio to
 have left Bulgaria on 3 May.  There has been no further report
 of his whereabouts.

 S I N 0-U, S,  RELATIONS
 PEKING DENOUNCES U1S, STATEMENTS ON STATUS OF TAIWAN
 Peking has reacted sharply and authoritatively to State
 Department spokesman Bray's 28 April statements that
 sovereignty over Taiwan represents an unsettled question
 subject to future international resolution and that it
 should be resolved by the two rival Chinese regimes.  In
 the customary pattern of authoritative comment on a
 current development, Peking's reaction took the form of
 a PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article accompanied by a
 heavily editorialized NCNA report on 4 May characterizing
 Bray's press briefing as new evidence of U.S. hostility
 and interference in China's internal affairs.  The NCNA
 report contains Peking media's first direct response--
 a negative one--to recent U.S. gestures toward improving
 relations with the PRC.
 Peking's rejoinder to Bray's statements provides the
 sharpest expression to date of its concern lest the
 international community seek an accommodation on the
 China question thc.t would fall short of the PRC's major
 objectives.  In comment on its diplomatic moves in recent
 months and on the question of UN representation, Peking
 has displayed apprehension over efforts to arrive at a
 formula that would in some measure preserve the inter-
 national standing of Chiang Kai-shek's regime and leave
 the formal resolution of the China question indeterminate.
 This issue became especially topical after the PRC-Canadian
 recognition agreement, in which Canada was permitted
 merely to "take note" of Peking's claim to Taiwan without
 endorsing'it.  At that time, Peking voiced concern over a
 tendency within the international community to have
 recourse to what a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on 15 October
 called "the new gimmick" of a "one China, one Taiwan"
 formula as a variation of the "two Chinas" policy.
 STATUS OF TAIWAN     Taking issue with Bray's statement that
 Taiwan's status remains an unsettled
 question, the Commentator article and the NCNA report
 advance unusually specific historical and juridical
 arguments for the PRC's claim that, Taiwan and the
 Pescadores are a part of its territory.  Thus, after
 recalling Japan's occupation of Taiwan at the end of the

 5 MAY 1977.
 19th century, Commentator cites the Cairo and Potsdam declarations
 as proclaiming the restoration of Taiwan to China and recalls a
 January 1950 statement by President Truman acknowledging Chinese
 authority over the island.  Taking exception to Bray's clarifying
 statement that the Cairo and Potsdam declarations represented a
 statement of purpose that has never been formally implemented,
 Commentator rejected this "barefaced lying" on the grounds
 that "the then Chinese Government" as3umed control of Taiwan
 in 1945 and that thus "China has resumed the sovereignty over
 Taiwan" from that time on.  The PRC's position, then, is that
 the international question has long since been resolved and
 that its recovery of Taiwan remains purely a Chinese internal
 affair.
 The thrust of Peking's argument is directed at Bray's statement
 that sovereignty over Taiwan is unsettled.  His suggestion that
 the two Chinese governments might resolve the question between
 themselves is not examined separately and on its merits; rather
 it is cited only in conjunction with the statement that the
 sovereignty question is subject to international resolution,
 as indicating the "self-contradictory and nonsensical"
 character of Bray's remarks and as representing "a flagrant
 interference" in China's internal affairs.
 Apart from quoting Bray's references to the two Chinese
 governments, Commentator makes no mention of the Chiang
 regime.  The NCNA report, citing Bray's references to U.S.
 diplomatic and treaty relations with "the Chiang Kai-shek
 gang," follows a standard line in reading into these
 references a "sinister design" of the Nixon Administration
 to "continue to be hostile towards the Chinese people and
 to perpetuate its forcible occupation of China's territory
 Taiwan."
 TAIWAN "LIBERATION"     Characteristically, Peking has been
 vague about how it intends to gain
 control of Taiwan.  The Commentator article, after denying
 that Taiwan is a question for international resolution and
 reaffirming Peking's opposition to any two-Chinas arrangement,
 reiterates the line that "when and how the Chinese people
 liberate Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair" in
 which no foreign country has any right to interfere.  Quoting
 Mao as declaring that the Chinese "are determined to liberate
 Taiwan," Commentator deals with the U.S. presence in the
 area in the following imprecise terms:  "The U.S. armed
 forces must pull out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits.  The
 U.S. aggressors have to pull out in any case and are not
 allowed to behave otherwise."

 Peking has not reported Chou En-tai's statement to Edgar Snow
 last year distinguishing between liberation of Taiwan as as
 internal matter and the U.S. military presence as an
 international one.  According to Snow, Chou expressed Chinese
 readiness to negotiate on the latter question.      This formula-
 tion of the Taiwan issue had been advanced by Chou in the
 past.  In official pronouncements in recent years, notably
 the foreign ministry statement of November 1968 proposing
 resumption of the Warsaw talks, Peking has coupled a demand
 for withdrawal of U.S. armed forces with a call for Sino-
 U.S. relations to be based on the five principles of peaceful
 coexistence.  As in its current reaction to Bray's press
 briefing, Peking has insisted that the status of Taiwan
 and the island's future control are not subject to inter-
 national negotiations.
 Peking has not demanded abrogation of the U.S.-ROC treaty,
 presumably preferring to regard this as a dead letter
 if the United States undertakes to withdraw from Taiwan.
 TWO CHINAS     Peking's forceful reaction to Bray's
 statements attests to its overriding
 concern over anything smacking of a two-Chinas solution--
 a concern overshadowing any satisfaction it may have
 drawn from Bray's remarks as implying erosion of U.S.
 support for the ROC's claims.  The NCNA article notes
 that Bray's briefing followed the submission on 26 April
 of a presidential commission's report on U.S. policy on
 the United Nations.  According to NCNA, the report
 advocates a "one China, one Taiwan" formula for resolving
 the China representation issue in the United Nations.
 NCNA also quotes President Nixon's remark at his 29 April
 press conference that the report is being given.
 consideration in high councils of the government.  This
 sequence of events, according to NCNA, shows that the
 United States is intensifying efforts in behalf of a
 "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" formula and
 that Bray's statement about Taiwan's unsettled status
 was "precisely aimed at preparing public opinion for
 this plot."

 NCNA's account does not mention the President's dismissal of
 the suggestion for negotiations between the Chinese regimes
 as "completely unrealistic."  Beyond his reference to the
 commisbion's report, the President's discussion of Sino-U.S.
 relations and the Taiwan question is ignored in the report.
 PEOPLE'S DIPLOMACY     While the PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator
 article is confined to a rebuttal of
 Bray's statement on the juridical status of Taiwan, the NCNA
 report discusses this issue within a broader context of
 Sino-U.S. relations.  According to NCNA, there has been
 "a new development in the friendship between the American
 and Chinese people" since the visit of the U.S. table
 tennis team.  In Peking's first comment on Washington's
 recent initiatives toward the PRC, NCNA scornfully
 observes that the Administration "hastily made various
 geptures . . . as if it wanted to improve relations" in
 an effort to gain political capital at a time of
 "unprecedented isolation at home and abroad."  Bray's
 statements and the other evidence of an attempt to separate
 Taiwan from the mainland, NCNA concludes, show that the
 Administration's professed intention to esteilish normal
 relations with the PRC "is all humbug."
 Before the NCIA report on Bray's statement, Peking had
 not commented on the political implications of recent
 Sino-U.S. developments.  Apart from an anomalous
 Shanghai broadcast, the uniformly friendly PRC
 propaganda on the American table tennis players' visit
 even avoided making a distinction between the American
 people and their government.  An authoritative
 endorsement of people's diplomacy was given in
 Peking's May Day joint editorial, which commended
 friendly exchanges between the people of various
 countries and the Chinese people.
 While Peking had taken care to keep the atmosphere
 surrounding Sino-U.S. relations clear in the wake of
 the table tennis team's visit, the recent U.S.
 statements on the sensitive Taiwan issue have moved
 it to make a more direct pitch for political pressure
 on the Administration to change its China policy.
 This application of people's diplomacy is reflected
 in the closing passage of the 4 May NCNA report,
 which says the American people "always wish to be

 friendly with the Chinese people" and portrays the American
 people as supporting Peking's aims regarding Taiwan.  NCNA
 ends with a warning that the Nixon Administration "will only
 make itself more isolated at home and abroad and end in
 utter failure" if it should "cling to its hostility toward
 the Chinese people"--that is, if it seeks a compromise on
 the China question falling short of Peking's fundamental
 objectives.
 Peking's sharp reaction to U.S. statements on the Taiwan
 issue accords with the position set forth in a major
 policy address by Huang Yung-sheng on 27 June 1970, the
 20th anniversary of the U.S. "occupation" of Taiwan.
 After reiterating opposition to any formuia for
 separating Taiwan from the mainland, Huang stressed that
 "U.S. occupation of Taiwan by armed force" is "the
 crucial issue" in Sino-U.S. relations and that a
 relaxation of relations is "out of the question" until
 the United States undertakes to withdraw its armed
 forces from Taiwan.  As in its current reaction,
 Peking's comment at that time derided the Nixon
 Administration's call for improved relations with
 the PRC as a maneuver to circumvent public pressure
 for a change in policy.
 PRC REAFFIRMS CLAIM TO SOVEREIGNTY OVER SENKAKUS
 While taking exception to U.S. statements raising the
 question of Taiwan's status, Peking has also reacted
 to recent disclosures that administrative contr%.~l over
 the disputed Senkakus will be acquired by Japan as part
 of the Okinawa reversion plan.  A PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article on 1 May and an NCNA report the
 follo'ing day forcefialy reassert the PRC's claim to
 sovereignty over the Senkakus and excoriate "the
 Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang" for allegedly selling
 out Chinese territory and resources by taking part
 in joint development projects with the Japanese and
 the South Koreans.  While denouncing the United States
 for being hostile to the Chinese by acceding administrative
 rights to Japan, Peking has ignored the U.S. distinction
 in this case between administrative rights and sovereignty.
 As in its comment on the Taiwan question, Peking is
 concerned to deny that the question of sovereignty is
 unsettled and subject to negotiations.

 The 1 May article is the most authoritative Peking comment on
 the Senkakus since a PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article of
 29 Dacembe2.  Unlike the December article, which focused
 mainly on the offshore oil and other resources of the
 Senkakus, it is essentially concerned with juridicia?_
 questions of sovereignty.  Peking's current propaganda
 is also notable for an effort to rally patriotic support.
 Thus, Commentator scorns the Nationalist Chinese for
 acting "servilely and humiliatingly" toward the Japanese
 and says "burning wrath among all the patriotic Chinese"
 has been aroused over the Senkakus issue.
 Commentator commends the Overseas Chinese for launching
 "a patriotic campaign" over the issue.  Peking's first
 endorsement of agitation by Overseas Chinese on this
 matter appeared in a 23 April NCNA account of a demonstra-
 tion held in Washington on 10 April.  The account reflected
 Peking's effort to turn the Overseas Chinese against the
 Nationalist regime, quoting the demonstrators as angrily
 denouncing "the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for its
 treacherous act in selling out China's territory and
 sovereignty."  Peking has not mentioned the recent
 demonstrations in Taiwan on the Senkakus question.

 MIDDLE EAST

 MOSCOW SEES ROGERS TRIP AS EFFORT TO REFURBISH U.S. IMAGE
 Soviet propaganda on Secretary Rogers' Middle East tour, which
 began on 1 May in Saudi Arabia, sustains Moscow's ongoing
 criticism of U.S. motives i., the area.  In line with comment
 since the 23 A',ril anno,incement of the trip, Soviet
 propagandists reject the notion that it represents a
 serious effort at mediation of the Middle East situation,
 citing Washington's "pro-Israel bias."   Commentators
 continue to criticize U.S. aid to Israel--including the
 shipment of "oifensive" Phantom aircraft--and alleged
 U.S. opposition to the reopening of the Suez Canal as
 proposed by the UAR.  Reports on Rogers' stops in Jordan
 and Lebanon, on the 2d and 3d respectively, have high-
 lighted local protests over U.S. support for Israel.
 Primakov on 2 May, in the first of three installments of
 an interview with a Radio Moscow correspondent broadcast
 to Arab listeners, said the Secretary's trip can in no
 way be called a mediation mission; the only such mission,
 he added, is the one undertaken by Dr. Jarring.
 Primakov remarked that no one had entrusted Rogers with
 his mission--"neither those at the United Nations nor
 anyone . . . from the Big Four, whose delegates are
 conducting consultations" on the Middle East.  Pointing
 up continuing U.S. support for Israel, he concluded that
 the trip is not taking place because of a change in
 Washington's policies, "but because the United States
 is forced to camouflage still further the objectives
 of its policy."  In his interview on the 3d, Primakov
 said the Rogers mission "contradicts" that of Jarring.
 Primakov and others press the line that oil is a major
 factor in a U.S. effort to refurbish the American image
 in the Middle East.  In Primak.ov's words, the United
 States had dispatched Rogers to the Middle East at
 least in part to safeguard American oil monopolies--
 which "cover about 60 percent of the American balance
 of payments deficit"--against "the blows of the Arab
 national liberation movement."  Taking a different
 tack, commentaries in Persian and Arabic on 29 April
 mentioned profits accruing to American oil companies

 from the closing of the Suez Canal.  The broadcast in Arabic
 concluded:  "We can see how American oil companies stand
 behind the Israeli policy of destruction which aims at
 disrupting the operation of the Suez Canal."
 A 3 May broadcast in Arabic, quoting the Arab press,
 said Rogers' visit is viewed as an attempt by the United
 States to portray itself as a neutral in the Arab-Israeli
 dispute; Rogers is in fact, however, "submitting suspect
 proposals which amount to Arab surrender."  The commentary
 also quoted a joint statement by "progressive" Lebanese
 organizations to the effect that the United States is
 "seeking not only to impose surrender on the Arabs and
 deal a blow to the Palestinian people, but also to
 consolidate the regimes which are pursuing a pro-American
 course in the Arab countries," allegedly hoping to set
 up "a bloc directed against the Federation of Arab
 Republics."
 TASS on the 4th, reporting Rogers' arrival that day in
 Cairo, cited the MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGiNCY for the
 statement that along with the UAR initiative on opening
 the Suez Canal to international shipping, "the stand
 of the United States in the question of a settlement
 of the Middle East crisis" would be discussed.  A
 28 April Moscow commentary in Arabic, more forthcoming
 than the bulk of Soviet comment, had stated that the
 USSR "is ready to support any positive initiative
 aimed at the establishment of a just peace in the
 Middle East, including an initiative from the Jnited
 States."

 YUGOSLAVIA
 PARTY PRESIDIUM OUTLINES STEPS TO MEET "SERIOUS" SITUATION
 A lengthy communique issued on the League of Communists (LCY)
 Presidium meeting held on Brioni from 28 to 30 April, broadcast
 by Radio Belgrade, acknowledges that the economic and political
 situation in Yugoslavia is "serious."  But it seeks to assure
 foreign and domestic audiences that the country is not on the
 brink of disintegration by portraying the LCY as in "complete
 unity" in its efforts to find solutions to pressing problems.
 Although Tito appears to have induced the participants in the
 session to curb public polemics and to agree on general approaches
 in speeding up reforms, the vagueness of some of the proposals
 enumerated in the communique suggests that many of the specifics
 remain to be worked out.
 The document announces that an LCY conference--the highest party
 body between congresses--will be held soon to discuss the party's
 "role and organization.'.   TANJUG reported on 4 May that the Croatian
 Central Committee will meet on the 11th to consider Presidium deci-
 sions, and other republican parties may be expected to take similar
 action.
 Analyzing Yugosla.via's current situation, the communique broadly
 attributes present difficul'ies to insufficient development of
 self-management relations. structural disruptions in the economy,
 discord among the republics, and increased nationalism.  Although
 prior to the Presidium session Tito had promised to name names and
 threatened to purge the LCY of those who violate unity--a course
 he may yet pursue during the planned party reorganization if party
 officials try to frustrate LCY decisions--the communique limits
 itself to e. general call for a .3truggle against bureaucratic cen-
 tralism and nationalism.  It comes down particularly hard on the
 latter:  "The LCY is unanimous in its assessment that nationalism
 is the basis for rallying all anticommunist forces, that it under-
 mines the trust and unity of the peoples and nationalities of
 Yugoslavia and leads to the undermining of the unity of the League."
 The communique goes on to cite the need for the LCY to strengthen
 its political and ideological role and to take a more active part
 in trying to solve the nation's problems.  In particular, it calls
 on the party to vigorously implement economic stabilization mea-
 sures and to work to create conditions for a general agreement on

 the economic system.     Noting that opposition to the LCY's course
 has appeared in the public media, the communique calls on party
 officials to "take measures to insure that communists will more
 resolutely" crack down on opposition to LCY policy.
 In an apparent effort to paper over the Serb-Croat dispute over
 alleged Croatian ties with Ustashi emigres abroad, the communique
 accepts the Federal Executive Council's conclusions, released in
 a statement on 28 April, that "hostile elements" abroad had tried
 to  discredit the Croatian party leadership but that federal
 organs had no part in the "conspiracy."  In an'ostensible non
 sequitur, the communique adds vaguely that "the session also noted
 shortcomings in the work of certain security services which must
 be eliminated in the shortest time through the work of superior
 organs." The Executive Council's statement, as reported by TANJUG,
 had made no mention of "shortcomings" in the state security
 apparatus, but it did call on both federal and republican organs
 to "strengthen the personnel of the security services" in order
 to combat "hostile activities."
 The Croatian Central Committee had specifically charged in a
 communique on 8 April that hostile elements abroad and some
 federal organs were disseminating allegations that the Croat
 leadership was linked with Ustashi emigres abroad.  Although
 the Croatian Central Committee communique did not name the State
 Security Service (SDB) as the responsible, federal organ, subse-
 quent Croatian calls in the FederaliAssembly for reorganization
 of the SDB clearly reflected a view of the SDB as the culprit.
 TITO SPEECH     In a May day speech in Labin, Istria, Tito gave
 a rambling report on the Brioni meeting in which
 he underlined the need to proceed from words to deeds and promised
 "energetic" action against opponents of the LCY's course.  Although
 he acknowledged that the debate at the Presidium meeting was "sharp"
 at the beginning, he said that unity was achieved on all questions.
 Noting that similar League discussions had taken place in the past
 (and by implication without significant results), Tito firmly added
 that "the question of execution of decisions is not a matter which
 should be left on paper.  No, this matter must move into practice
 and be carried out."  Although he urged communists to start
 immediately to resolve the present crisis, he noted tha'  it will
 "probably take a few months" and added that during that period
 "there will be cadre changes" and a "regrouping" in the Federal
 Government.  Stating that the planned reorganization of the LCY
 will make it "a more efficient protagonist of the further buildir,
 of our country," he added:  "We shall do this in the shortest time,
 too."

 As if to underscore the urgency of the need to implement party
 and government reforms, Tito raised the spectre of unnamed
 domestic and foreign enemies trying to disrupt Yugoslavia.
 Warning against "all deformations among ourselves," he assailed
 universities which "retain and tolerate lecturers who work against
 our system, slander our leadership, and serve foreign interests,"
 thereby misleading the youth.  He was also critical of the Yugo-
 slav press for disseminating "misinformation" and "slanders" and
 promised to take "energetic action" against unnamed papers that are
 "introducing trouble among the people."  He went on to express con-
 cern over the activities of unnamed foreign "intelligence services"
 which he said were exerting "incredible pressure" against Yugoslavia.
 Adding that the Presidium had decided to "discover the roots of these
 various intelligence attempts," he called for national vigilance
 against the introduction of "misinformation from outside" designed
 to discredit Yugoslavia.

 EAST GERMANY
 HONECKER TAKES OVER IN ORDERLY TRANSFER WITH SOVIET BLESSINGS
 Warm personal tributes from Soviet and East Buropean leaders as
 well as from his own party have accompanied Walter Ulbricht's
 resignation as party First Secretary in favor of his long-time
 heir apparent, Erich Honecker, in the kind of well-oiled
 transfer of power that is a rarity in East European communist
 history.  The only other publicly untarnished stepdown of a
 top East European leader in recent years was Janos Kadar's
 relinquishing of the post of Hungarian premier shortly after
 the reemphasis on collective leadership in the USSR with
 Khrushchev's removal in October 1964.
 Ulbricht tendered his resignation in a speech to the SED
 Central Committee on 3 May.  After informing the plenum of
 his decision--"which has not been easy for me"--to step down
 as party leader because of "old age," he received encomiums
 from Honecker and in a letter from the SID Central Committee
 read by Premier Stoph.  TASS promptly recounted the plenum
 proceedings and publicized cordial messages from Brezhnev
 both to Honecker on his election as First Secretary and to
 Ulbricht on his election to the honorary post of "Chairman"
 of the SED.*  The Soviet leader's message to Honecker under-
 scores continuity, noting that the new SED leader's career
 has been guided by "the outstanding leaders of the German
 working class movement, Wilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht."
 It notes Honecker's ''big contribution" to strengthening
 friendship between the SID and CPSU and the East German and
 Soviet people.
 The new division of powers in the GDR is described by Brezhnev
 as "an embodiment of the important Leninist principle of the
 successiveness and collectivity of party leadership."  His
 message to Ulbricht says "we all know very well and highly
 appreciate the immense contribution" the veteran GDR leader
 has made to the building of socialism and to friendship between
 ADN announced on the 5th that the eighth SED congress in
 June will be opened by new SED Chairman Ulbricht, presumably
 the ceremonial function of welcoming visiting delegations by
 name, after which Honecker will deliver the Central Committee
 report.

 the East German and Soviet parties and people.  The message
 also echoes the passage in the SED Central Committee's letter
 of appreciation to Ulbricht which recognizes his new status as
 that of another member "working in the collective of the
 Politburo."  Ulbricht had said, in concluding his resignation
 speech, that he would "continue working in the collective body
 of the Central Committee and the Politburo according to my
 strength" while "conscientiously" carrying out the function
 of State Council Chairman, which he retains.
 From East European sources, prompt reports of the SED leader-
 ship change have come from Czechoslovak, Polish, Hungarian,
 Romanian, and Yugoslav media.  In the only available comment
 from any of these sources so far, TANJUG said the change "did
 not come as a surprise" and went on to highlight the factor of
 Ulbricht's age--a factor of obvious import also for the
 Yugoslav leadership picture.  The commentary added that "it
 is clear now why, a number of days before, Ulbricht did not
 leave for a visit to Romania as scheduled," to sign the new
 GDR-Romanian friendship treaty.
 The first monitored telegram of congratulations from East
 Europe came from Husak to Honecker on the 3d--released by
 CTK before TASS released Brezhnev's.  Summing up the East
 European response, TASS quoted ADN late the next day as
 reporting that "cordial felicitations" to Honecker and
 messages to Ulbricht "paying tribute to his outstanding
 work" had been sent by Gierek, Husak, Kadar, and Zhivkov.
 AGERPRES had carried messages from Ceausescu to the two GDR
 leaders Several hours earlier.
 HONECKER     Firm solidarity with the CPSU pervaded both
 SPEECHES     Honecker's acceptance speech and his speech
 presenting to the plenum the report of the SED
 delegation, officially headed by Ulbricht, to the March--April
 CPSU congress.  In accepting his "heavy responsibility,"
 Honecker declared that "the guarantee of our further secure
 and successful progress lies primarily in our unbreakable
 fraternal alliance with the party of Lenin, with the CPSU."
 In introducing the SED delegation's report to the CPSU
 congress, Honecker said the Soviet congress results were
 "of inestimable value for the shaping of the developed
 socialist social system in the GDR," adding that the SED
 delegation report "stresses explicitly in this context

 - 211 -
 that the way to socialism and its main characteristics are
 determined by general laws."  He also heavily stressed economic
 "integration" in CEMA, as he had done in a 20 April article in
 PRAVDA on the 25th SED anniversary, and praised Brezhnev
 personally for his remarks at the congress on the virtues of
 "businesslike" economic planning.
 Commenting on GDR policy toward the FRG and West Berlin,
 Honecker used language very similar to that used by Soviet
 Foreign Minister Gromyko in his 3 April speech to the CPSU
 congress.  First pointing out that  ratification of the
 r LLscow and Warsaw treaties with Bonn would have "favorable"
 repercussions throughout Europe, Honecker said that the
 ratification of these treaties, the convening of an all-
 European security conference, and "the settlement of West
 Berlin's problems" are "necessary and important steps" toward
 a lasting peace in Europe.  But he immediately added?--as
 Gromyko had done--that these steps "must be carried out in
 parallel, without waiting for the solution of one question
 before moving on to the second," and noted that the policy of
 solving issues in parallel "is the point of view of the CPSU
 as well as of the SED."  He described West German efforts to
 link ratification of the treaties with a West Berlin settlement
 as "hopeless attempts" and remarked that Bonn's "babbling
 about so-called intra-German relations" had been rebuffed at
 the CPSU congress.
 Again asserting complete unity between the CPSU and the SED,
 Honecker said that "both parties, and with them the other
 fraternal parties, are also agreed that nothing has changed
 with regard to the reactionary and aggressive character of
 imperialism and the FRG."  The East Berlin radio account of
 the speech does not, however, make it clear whether Honecker
 directly mentioned the Bonn government or the SPD/FDP coalition.
 BACKGROUND     Although Ulbricht has periodically been out of
 the limelight because of illness in recent
 years, his own remarks and the plenum announcement cited only
 "age" and not health as the reason for his stepdown as First
 Secretary.  On 21 April he delivered a lengthy speech on the
 SED's 25th anniversary, carried live by the East Berlin
 domestic service, in which he may have implied his impending
 stepdown in a passing remark on the subject of plan fulfill-
 ment:  "I do not want to prejudge the Central Committee report
 to the eighth party congress," scheduled to open on 111 June.

 As at the CPSU congress, he did not include any direct attack
 on Peking in that speech.  Honecker, however, assailed "the
 Mao Tse-tung group" in a speech outside the congress, in
 Magnitogorsk on 4 April, and the Chinese leadership came under
 similar attack in a NEUES DEUTSCIILAND editorial on the CPSU
 congress summarized by PRAVDA on 29 March.
 The East German press in the last few years has amply hinted
 at Honecker's status as heir apparent in almost invariably
 including him in group pictures involving Ulbricht and Stoph,
 usually with Honecker and Stoph at a similar distance just
 behind or beside Ulbricht.  In GDR party-government delegations
 to international communist gatherings, Honecker has regularly
 been included as an extra man, with no counterpart in
 delegations from the other. Soviet bloc countries.  He has been
 Ulbricht's stand-in at domestic functions and as the SED
 representative on such occasions as a GDR party-government
 delegation's visit to Moscow in July 1969; during another
 such visit to Warsaw that same month on the Polish 25th
 anniversary, a celebration also attended by Brezhnev, Kosygin,
 Husak, and Svoboda; and at the Bulgarian party congress of
 20-25 April this year.  After the close of the CPSU congress,
 TASS on 12 April reported Brezhnev's "cordial" meeting with
 both Ulbricht and Honecker; Stoph, who was also a member of
 the SED delegation, was not mentioned in the report.
 ADN's biography of Honecker, carried on 3 May, says among
 other things that the new leader "last year attended all
 important meetings of the party and state leaderships of the
 socialist countries" and "took an active part in the preparation
 and execution of the international conference of communist and
 workers parties in Moscow in 1969."

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 KOSYGIN IS SLIGHTED IN SUPREME SOVIET NOMINATIONS
 Downgraded to third place in Brezhnev's listing of the
 Politburo at the close of the 24th CPSU Congress, Kosygin
 is the victim of new protocol setbacks in the course of
 nominations to the RSFSR Supreme Soviet.  The first
 nominating sessions took place on 27 April, and they
 were reported in the papers of the next day.
 In the nominations from Moscow city--the only ones in
 which epithets are applied and hierarchical order is
 directly comparable to that of 1970--that of Brezhnev
 was listed first, Podgornyy second, and Kosygin third,
 reversing the order of the latter two in the April 1970
 Supreme Soviet nominations.  Additionally, in PRAVDA,
 MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, and most other papers, Kosygin was
 granted exactly the same epithets as Podgornyy
 ("promin.ent political and state figure"); in 1970
 Kosygi.n had been a "true Leninist and important
 political and state figure" while Podgornyy was only
 a "prominent figure of the Leninist Communist Party
 and Soviet state."  IZVESTIYA differs from the other
 papers in snubbing Kosygin further, by deleting his
 epithet while including Podgornyy's.
 On the other hand, Podgornyy and Kosygin received the
 identical number of nominations--as had happened also
 on the first day in April 1970.  At the May Day parade
 too, Kosygin and Podgornyy followed their familiar
 pattern of flanking Brezhnev at the tribune, giving no
 further hint of any change.
 Interestingly, Brezhnev stood out less from the leading
 troika this year than in 1970.   Whereas Brezhnev received
 far more first-day nominations than Kosygin and Podgornyy
 in 1970--from 16 areas as against six--this year his
 16 regions were almost matched by the 15 which nominated
 Kosygin and Podgornyy.  Whereas PRAVDA's report on the
 first day in 1970 (25 April 1970) reported the epithets
 for Brezhn,:!v but deleted those for Kosygin and Podgornyy
 (IZVESTIYA lid report the praise for Kosygin and Podgornyy,
 and PRAVDA belatedly added epithets for them on 30 April),
 this year all papers except IZVESTIYA carried epithets
 for all three top leaders.

 PRC  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 MAY DAY LEADERSHIP TURNOUT PRODUCES NO SURPRISES
 The May Day festivities in China this year reflected Peking's
 increased attention to foreign affairs, with little attention
 paid. to domestic affairs in the joint editorial or in rally
 comment.  Mao and Lin Piao made their customary appearance at
 the massive Peking rally; NCNA portrayed Mao as "in excellent
 health and high spirits."
 Three Politburo members continued their lengthy absence from
 the public scene by failing to appear at the Peking rally.
 Hsieh Fu-chih, although he was named head of the Peking CCP
 Municipal Committee in March, maintained his year-long absence.
 Politburo Standing Committee members Kang Sheng and Chen Po-ta
 also remain undo; the cloud which enveloped them last fall.
 As on National Day last October, when Chen Po-ta's appearances
 had already ceased, NCI'A listed Standing Committee members
 along with other members of the Politburo.  This time Peking
 offered some explanation for the absences by using a formula
 dating from October 1969 to the effect that the name list
 excludes those not present in Peking and "absentees on
 account of work or sickness."
 Two former Politburo members made their first public appearance
 since 1969, listed as vice-chairmen of the Central Committee's
 Military Commission:  Chen I, former foreign minister, and
 Hsu Hsiang-chien, one of the old marshals.
 No comprehensive list of provincial appearances on 1 May is
 yet available, but provincial leaders listed as present in
 Peking on 1 May may provide some indication of which provinces
 are now undergoing central review before forming party
 committees.  The two top leaders of Sinkiang, which has
 reported much lower-level party activity, were both listed
 among Central Committee members in Peking.  A vice chairman
 from Yunnan, whose chief died last year, and from Szechwan,
 where leadership factionalism has been severe, also appeared
 in the listing.  Several leaders from provinces that have
 established their CCP committees also appeared.

 5 MAY 197.1
 Editorial comment for this year's holiday came in the form of
 an unexciting joint RED FLAG-PEOPLE'S DAILY-LIBERATION ARMY
 DAILY editorial released by NCNA on 30 April.*       Domestic
 issues were underplayed in the editorial, which stressed
 the PRC's international solidarity with the world's working
 class.  The editorial merely outlined the need for greater
 work efforts to fulfill the 1971 national e;;onomic plan
 and to achieve the objectives set at the Ninth Party
 Congress.  "Victories on all fronts" must also be won to
 greet the 50th anniversary of the CCP (1 July) and the
 promised Fourth National People's Congress.
 The editorial made the usual plea that "senior cadres
 in particular" increase their study of Mao's vorks, a
 major PRC propaganda theme since the second party pienum
 last September, in order to meet "the arduous domestic
 and international tasks of our party."  Some progress in
 the 9-month campaign for senior cadres to undertake
 intensive study of Mao's works was indicated in a 2 May
 NCNA review of May Day celebrations.  NCNA offered
 unusual praise for "leading cadres at various levels
 in particular" for their "progress in criticizing
 revisionism."  The report then applauded "many leading
 cadres" for their serious study of Mao's works.  On
 3 May, NCNA again portrayed upper-level cadres as
 playing an exemplary role in nationwide meetings held
 to celebrate May Day by studying Mao's Thought.
 *  Last year, May Day served as the peg for a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 editorial which drew a connection between the utilization of
 Mao's Thought and the successful launching of the PRC's first
 artificial satellite.  No editorial comment appeared for the
 holiday in 1969.  A joint RED FLAG-PEOPLE'S DAILY-LIBERATION
 ARMY DAILY editorial was released in 1968.
