 After pursuing a largely one-sided quarrel with Iraq over the past two months,
 Syria abruptly announced yesterday it would release more Euphrates River water to
 Iraq as a "gesture of good will." A Syrian government spokesman said that, as a
 result of the mediation of Saudi Oil Minister Yamani, Syria now had hope a
 permanent agreement on sharing the river's water could be reached soon.
 Iraq will be relieved by the Syrian gesture; the cutback in the flow of Euphrates
 water threatened the livelihood of thousands of Iraqi farmers. Baghdad, nevertheless,
 has refused to be provoked by Syrian harassment and propaganda, apparently
 believing that President Asad would drop the dispute once it had served his
 purposes.
 Asad probably believes he has amply demonstrated that Syria can exert severe
 economic pressure on Baghdad at any time if the Iraqis try to meddle in Syrian
 internal affairs. Neither Iraqi political intrigue in Syria, nor Asad's antipathy for the
 Baghdad regime is expected to end as a result of this step. The release of the
 Euphrates water,  however,  should ease tensions, at least temporarily.

 President Kenyatta is reported to have forced the parliamentary committee
 that is investigating the murder of regime critic J. M. Kariuki to delete two names
 from its report. Committee members probably saw this deletion as the only way to
 avoid their arrest or the disbanding of parliament.
 The report, released yesterday, criticizes the police for covering up the crime
 and planting false evidence. By implication, it also attacks the regime and is likely to
 keep alive popular dissatisfaction with Kenyatta. The report alleges that Colonel Ben
 Gethi, the commander of the paramilitary police and a mainstay of the regime, lured
 Kariuki into the hands of his murderers. According to the press, the names deleted
 at Kenyatta's insistence were those of a senior cabinet member and a high-ranking
 police official-in all likelihood Minister of State Mbiyu Koinange and Police Chief
 Bernard Hinga.
 Kenyatta and his top associates, badly shaken at first by the hostile reaction to
 Kariuki's murder, have resumed a confident and combatative manner. Throughout
 May, delegations of government and party officials met with Kenyatta to pledge
 loyalty and southern Kikuyu politicians-Kenyatta's main supporters-held rallies at
 which the President's critics were castigated. In late May, Kenyatta got tough with
 university students, a leading source of anti-government sentiment in the ca ital
 using paramilitary troops to quell the students and close the university

 Tehran is re-evaluating its

 The situation in Beirut reportedly is returning to normal. All roads are open,
 and the street fighting that paralyzed the city for two weeks has died down.
 Prime Minister - designate Rashid Karami said yesterday that some progress was
 being made toward forming a new government, but he stressed that the restoration
 of calm is just as important. Lebanese security officers have cleared the streets of
 barricades, and the sporadic shooting that kept residents home on Monday has been
 halted after concerted efforts by security officials and politicians.
 Karami's efforts to set up a cabinet of national unity are being continually
 blocked by leftists who demand that the right-wing Phalanges Party be excluded
 because of its part in the street, fighting. Phalangist leader Pierre Jumayyil has
 rejected any suggestion that his party should be boycotted. After calling on
 President Franjiyah, Karami said, "We have agreed on the plan to be followed in
 forming a government."
 Karami's efforts to improve the security situation notwithstanding, incidents
 such as the killing of the commander of the National Liberal Party militia
 demonstrated that security conditions are still poor. Former president Shamun's
 supporters-who had not played a prominent role in the earlier hostilities-may now
 be drawn into the conflict, which threatens to assume sectarian overtones. This
 could have a polarizing effect on Christian and Muslim personalities who have sought
 to preserve their neutrality in order to exert a calming influence during the past two
 weeks. In this atmosphere, the rapid formation of a new cabinet in which all
 segments of  the population have confidence  is of particular importance

 Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and his Pathet Lao deputy, Phoumi
 Vongvichit, broke no new ground in separate conversations on June 2 and 3 with
 Assistant Secretary of State Habib.
 Both Lao leaders reaffirmed the communist-dominated coalition government's
 desire to maintain "good" relations with the US. They also made a strong pitch for
 continued US assistance, but with the standard Pathet Lao caveat that such aid must
 be unconditional and given directly to the Lao government.
 In his discussion with Habib, Phoumi essentially reiterated a line he had taken
 earlier with the US charge and acting AID director. He said that Laos was about to
 embark on a long-range economic development program and that US assistance
 would  be welcome-particularly  during  the  first  two-year,
 "healing-the-wounds-of-war" phase. This is not the first time Phoumi has described
 American aid in the context of war reparations.
 Phoumi said he would personally supervise negotiations on a new assistance
 agreement. He also indicated he did not "think" there would be any more
 "disorders" directed against Americans in Vientiane.
 Meanwhile, Souvanna's lack of touch with reality and his acquiescence to
 Pathet Lao viewpoints were abundantly apparent in his discussion with Habib. He
 repeatedly emphasized that, in his view, "nothing had changed" in the
 Lao-American relationship. The Prime Minister blamed "excited young people" for
 the recent anti-American demonstrations in Vientiane, and argued that AID, not the
 US, was the prime target.
 Souvanna also maintained that there had been no real change in Laos, merely
 an "evolution of attitudes." He said that in light of the "new situation," he had:
 --"ordered" the two sides to collaborate;
 --"ordered" Phoumi and acting Pathet Lao Defense Minister Khamouane
 Boupha to purge the Royal Lao Army of "undesirables" and to integrate the
 communist and non-communist armies;
 --"asked" Phoumi to staff the coalition administration with civilian officials
 from Sam Neua.

 The Pathet Lao, according to Souvanna, have no intention of taking over
 Laos-at least not for another "five or six years." The Lao communists, he insisted,
 were "reasonable nationalists" not dictators, who respected the monarchy and who
 had never formed a separate government during their long years of isolation in Sam
 Neua.
 Souvanna gave no hint of any intention to resign or to go abroad.
 Labor-management confrontations have intensified in Bangkok and labor
 leaders have threatened a general strike for today unless the government yields to
 their demands. Although the labor movement lacks sufficient strength to force a
 nationwide shutdown, selected strikes could cause serious problems.
 Prime Minister Khukrit Pramot is personally leading government efforts to
 resolve the disputes. By appearing on television and directly involving himself in the
 mediations, Khukrit is following the precedent set last year by his predecessor. At
 that time, a similar approach, coupled with the enactment of stronger pro-labor laws
 and establishment of a nationwide minimum wage, enabled the government to
 resolve the crisis.
 Continued inflation, with high prices unmatched by high wages, seems to be
 the main issue for discussion in future bargaining sessions. Labor unions have
 demanded the resignation of a tough senior police official and the disbanding of a
 security unit at a local hotel--the scene of disturbances last month. Government
 negotiators should have little difficulty in settling these issues.
 Labor forces have traditionally worked closely with student groups. Together
 these groups represent a formidable force with potential nationwide impact.
 Historically, labor has desisted from using violence, and the current attitude of
 students indicates their preference for peaceful action. At this juncture, both
 organizations most likely are fearful of military intervention and reprisals aaainst
 them and will not actively promote disorder.

 The Soviets are putting out the line that there has been a turn to the left in
 China's domestic politics. Their purpose evidently is to suggest to the US and others
 in the West that any improvement in relations with China will not be durable. The
 tougher line appears timed to counter whatever gain Chinese Deputy Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping may have made during his visit to Western Europe last month and to raise
 doubts prior to President Ford's trip to Peking.
 This message was conveyed forcefully by Mikhail Ka itsa chief of the Soviet
 Foreign Ministry's Far East Division,
 Kapitsa asserted that Premier Chou n ai s position had been weakened
 by the National People's Congress and that the "Shanghai" group, including Mao's
 wife Chiang Ching, had moved into dominant positions overseeing the party and the
 government. Kapitsa's deputy, Igor Rogachev, has made similar points about Chinese
 politics to a US diplomat in Moscow.
 Kapitsa and Rogachev made these assertions as if they were beyond dispute; in
 fact, neither of the reputed leftists, Chiang Ching nor Yao Wen-van, has been
 appointed to the Politburo standing committee, nor is there any sign that leftists
 have gained control of it or of the party's control commission, as Kapitsa claimed.
 Moreover, the Soviets themselves have heretofore interpreted the National People's
 Congress as a victory for Chou and the moderates.
 the new predominance of the Shanghai group
 would lead to an interisi icai:ion o the struggle against both the Soviet Union and
 the US. He did not speculate about what new policies China would follow, but he
 implied that there was a good possibility of tougher days ahead for Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 Kapitsa raised the issue of the Soviet helicopter crew that has now been in
 Chinese hands for more than a year and about which the Soviets have said very little
 in the last six months. He argued disingenuously that Soviet authorities were under
 public pressure to do something about the crew and stated that the Chinese
 ambassador had been told Moscow may be compelled to retaliate.
 I
 A similar motive lay behind Kapitsa's description of the developing situation in
 Southeast Asia. He said the 'Soviets wanted all countries in the region to strengthen
 their defense against "Chinese expansionism" and, for this reason, were now
 prepared to take a more favorable attitude toward the Association of Southeast
 Asian Nations.

 Kapitsa described the outcome in Vietnam as a great defeat for China and by
 implication a corresponding victory for the USSR. He was less enthusiastic about
 Cambodia and even wept a few crocodile tears for the people of Phnom Penh.
 Without giving any specifics, Kapitsa professed to see factions within the Cambodian
 leadership and took care to describe the pro-Chinese faction as "savages" who were
 responsible for the excesses. This factional formulation provides a rationale for
 Moscow to seek ties with Cambodia even while condemning sotto voce the
 Cambodian leaders.
 On Japan, Kapitsa asserted that should the Japanese accept the hegemony
 clause in a treaty with China, it would freeze Soviet-Japanese relations for a long
 time. He also linked the hegemony issue to the question of the Northern Territories,
 suggesting that the Soviets might show some flexibility if Tokyo resisted Chinese
 pressures. He obviously hopes that such assertions will get back to the Japanese and
 stiffen their resolve with China. Rogachev, has told a US diplomat that Moscow
 anticipates that, in the end, Tokyo will agree to the hegemony language. The
 implication is that the onus for the resulting "freeze" in relations will lie with Japan.

 BURMA: Labor unrest in  Rangoon is continuing, and the government
 apparently is ready to use 'force if necessary to prevent the situation from getting
 out of hand. Thus far, the protests have been peaceful, but work slowdowns to
 demand larger food rations and higher wages reportedly are spreading. There are
 rumors that a general strike is planned to commemorate the anniversary on Friday
 of last year's violent clash between troops and demonstrating workers. Government
 leaders are meeting to discuss the situation, and troops are said to have been sent to
 the sites of two of the slowdown strikes. The government apparently does not
 believe the problem is crit'Jcal, but if the unrest becomes widespread, the army
 almost certainly will be able to quell any disorders. Despite rumors of an alliance
 between the workers and students, Rangoon University is calm and there have been
 no further reports of student disturbances during the past week.
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: President Balaguer has given cabinet-level posts to
 two of the top military officers who resigned last month. General Enrique Perez y
 Perez was designated secretary of the interior and police, and Rear Admiral Emilio
 Jimenez was named secretary of foreign relations. As interior secretary, a post he has
 held twice before, General (Perez will technically be the immediate superior of his
 archrival, General Neit Nivar, whose appointment as chief of the national police was
 the motive for Perez' resignation as army chief of staff on May 9. Balaguer's cabinet
 shifts are in line with his policy of balancing military contenders for influence
 against each other, seeming to favor first one and then the other. He is careful never
 to allow any of the ambitious generals to accumulate enough support to move

 ROMANIA: President Ceausescu will arrive in Brazil today and move on to
 Mexico on Saturday. At both stops he will push for increased economic cooperation
 and will seek support for Romania's bid for observer status at the meeting of
 nonaligned foreign ministers in Lima this August. Brazil resumed full diplomatic
 relations with Romania only last year and has already concluded a bilateral
 economic accord that provides for Romanian imports of Brazilian iron ore. Romania
 has heretofore had to depend largely on the USSR for its iron ore. Ceausescu's
 discussions in Mexico are expected to focus on President Echeverria's promotion of
 the UN charter on the economic rights and duties of states. Ceausescu is also a
 strong advocate of national control over exploitation of natural resources. He will
 probably offer the Mexicans technical aid in developing their rapidly expanding
 petroleum industry.
