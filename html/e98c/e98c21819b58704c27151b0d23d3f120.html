 PRESIDENT'S  CHIN A  TRIP
 PEKING GIVES VISIT AMPLE COVERAGE WITHOUT COMIENTARY
 Peking has provided extensive coverage tA President Nixon's visit
 while observing a virtual standdown In polemical propaganda on
 U.S. policies and act.ton .generally since the P.resident's arrival
 on 21 February.   With Mao's extraordinary meeting with the
 President on the very fj.tst day signaling the major attention
 to be accorded the visit, Pek..in 's coverage seems designed to
 set the stage for what Chou En-lai on the 21st said could be
 "a new start" in Sino-Amer.icari relations.  While providing this
 coverage, highlighted by a generous spread in PEOPLE'S DAILY on
 the 22d, Peking has latgalyavoided anti-U.S. polemics.   It has
 originated no comment on U.S. activities since the PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article on the 200 supporting the DRV protest
 against the U.S. bombings,* and i.` has mentioned the United
 States only in passing or indirectly in news items on Indochina.
 Reflecting the anomaly of a visit by the  }rief of state of a
 country with which the PRC does not have diplomatic relations,
 Peking reported that the visit was at the invitation of the PRC
 Government but offered no other characterizativn.**  Nor was
 there any explicit characterization of the atmosphere at the
 Peking airport, the banquet .on the first day, or the various
 meetings.  Peking did, however, note that the fl&gs of the two
 countries were flown and .their national anthems played at the
 *  See the Indochina section of this TRENDS.
 ** Haile Selassie paid "a state visit" last October.  Chinese
 reports on the arrival and subsequent ceremonies explicitly
 depicted a "warm" atmosphere.  In other types of recent visits,
 Burmese Premier Ne Win--a target during the Chinese cultural
 revolution of virulent .propaganda attacks--made a "friendly and
 informal" visit last August; Paki.atan's Bhutto arrived for a
 "fr.i.endly visit" at the invitation of the PRC Government last
 November, when he represented a political party rather than the
 Pakistani Government; and .DRV Premier Pham Van Dong made an
 "official friendly visit" at the invitation of the Chinese party
 and government, also in November.

 airport and the banquet.  Taken together with the fact that
 Mao's meeting with the President took place on the first day,
 the characterization of their conversation as "serious and frank"
 would seem to indicate,. frum Peking's standpoint, that the visit
 should be viewed by the world as a serious attempt to address
 the differences dividing the two countries and to seek areas of
 common interest.
 PRC MEDIA COVERAGE     Reportage on the activities of the
 President's group has been disseminated
 broadly in PRC domestic and international media, giving Chinese
 and foreign audiences factual accounts of the arrival, the
 banquet on the 21st, the various meetings, and sightseeing and
 other activities. The mast extensive coverage appeared in the
 press and broadcasts on the 22d reporting the meeting with Mao
 and other events of the .ftrst day.  Thus, for example, the
 main evening newscast in Radio Peking's domestic service on the
 22d opened by reporting that PEOPLE'S DAILY devoted extensive
 space to the meeting with Mao and followed with reports on the
 banquet of the 21st, including the toasts, and on the talks
 between the President and Chou and between Secretary Rogers and
 the Chinese foreign minister.
 The photographic display in the 22 February PEOPLE'S DAILY was
 more generous than the coverage given other visiting noncommunist
 chiefs of state since the cultural revolution.  Previous visitors,
 including two Pakistani presidents, Die Win, and Emperor Haile
 Selassie, were each accorded two trunt-page pictures in PEOPLE'S
 DAILY and one or two pictures an inside pages after they had met
 Mao.  President Nixon was pictured three times on the front
 page and four times on inside pages.  This is comparable to
 the treatment accorded .Romanian Pretn.dent Ceausescu after meeting
 Mao, when there were also three front-page photographs plus six
 additional ones on inside pages.  But the President was not granted
 an honor given to Ceausescu and other communist leaders--a front-
 page photograph of the leader alone, with no one else, on the
 day of his arrival.  Like other chiefs of state, Ceausescu did
 not meet Mao until later in the visit rather than on the first
 day, and met Mao only once.
 first filmed reports came on  the evening ui the 22d, leading
 off the transmission for that day and being repeated at the
 close.  The two-mi.nu' a official film ''f the meeting with Mao came

 first, followed by 10-minute films of the arrival in Peking
 and the banquet, including portions of both the President's
 and Chou's toasts, and finally a two-minute film of the
 afternoon meeting with Chou.  On the 23d, the initial 17
 minutes of the transmission were devoted to filmed reports
 of the preceding day's activities, including the second
 meeting with Chou and the ballet performance.
 So far the TV coverage parallels that given to Haile Selassie's
 visit last October.  The emperor arrived on the morning of
 6 October, and there was no TV reportage that evening; on the
 7th, 8th, and 9th, filmed reports of his activities lasting
 28, 9, and 22 minutes respectively led off the TV transmissions.
 A five-minute film of Mao's meeting with the emperor was shown
 on the 9th.
 Peking made a point of providing the "compatriots" on Taiwan
 with coverage of the President's visit.  A broadcast by the PLA
 Fukien Front radio to Taiwan on the 22d was wholly devoted to
 the events of the first day of the visit.  A broadcast on the
 same day by Radio Peking to Taiwan devoted the first seven of
 eight items to the visit.
 As part of its worldwide dissemination of reportage on the visit,
 Peking has beamed reports to Southeast Asia in various languages,
 including Vietnamese.  Radio Peking has also kept its Russian
 listeners informed on the visit.
 PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE      Peking's coverage has consisted solely
 of                        of reportage without. commentary, but
 the five principles of peaceful coexistence"--capping the front-
 page of the 22 February PEOPLE'S DAILY and enunciated by Chou
 at the banquet he gave on the 21st--have provided a leitmotif.
 Chou :.alled the President's visit "a positive move" affording the
 leaders of the two countries an opportunity of meeting in person
 to seek the normalization of relations and to exchange views on
 questions of concern to the two sides.  Noting that contacts
 between the two countries were suspended for more than 20 years
 for "reasons known fully to all," Chou said "the gate to friendly
 contacts has finally been opened,'` and he expressed confidence
 that the day "will surely come" when the common desire of the
 two peoples to promote the normalization of relations and to work
 for the relaxation of  tensions "will be realized."

 Acknowledging that the twc countries' social systems are
 "fundamentally different" and. that "great differences" exist
 between their governments, Chou declared that these differences
 should not hinder China and the United States from establishing
 "normal state relations". on the basis of the five principles
 of peaceful coexistence, and "still less should they lead to
 war."*  Though Chou claimed that Peking had "consistently"
 pursued a policy of seeking, negotiations with the United States
 since 1955, his invocation of the principles of coexistence on
 the day of the President's arrival represents another milestone
 in a development that dates back to late 1968.  At that time,
 when Peking was taking a notably more flexible ideological and
 political stance in the wake of the Soviet invasion of
 Czechoslovakia in August 1968, a PRC Foreign Ministry statement
 in 26 November had called for a resumption of the Sino-U.S.
 ambassadorial talks in Warsaw after the President took office
 and revived the proposal for a Sino-U.S. agreement based on
 the principles of peaceful coexistence.  Peking's revival of
 this approach marked a striking shift in its strategy of
 pursuing the rivalry with the Soviets by attacking their policy
 of detente.   (At the time of the Sino-Soviet treaty anniversary
 in February 1965, for example, Foreign Minister Chen I said
 peaceful coexistence with the United States was "out of the
 question.")   The November 1968 statement claimed that Peking
 had "consistently" followed the line of coexistence in Sino-U.S.
 relations for the past 13 years--thus dating this policy back
 to the same point Chou did in his toast.
 In the passage in his toast calling for peaceful coexistence, Chou
 said that as early as 1955 the PRC Government publicly stated that
 "the Chinese people do not want to have a war with the United
 States and that the Chinese Government is willing to sit down
 and enter into negotiations with the United States Government."
 This wording appeared in .a statement issued by Chou at the Bandung
 conference in 1955--where Chou became prominently associated with
 espousal of a negotiated approach to Sino-U.S. tension--and in
 formal reports that -year to the National People's Congress.
 Chou'a toast contained no reference to a specific issue, but
 the 1955 statement he recalled had expressed a readiness for
 negotiations on relaxing tension in the Far East and specifically
 *  The 7 October 1969 PRC Government statement agreeing to open
 border negotiations with the USSR said that "irreconcilable
 differences of principle" should not prevent them from "maintaining
 normal state relations" on the basis of the five principles of
 peaceful coexistence.  The statement said there was "no reason
 whatsoever for China and the Soviet Union to fight a war" over
 the border issue.

 in the Taiwan area.  At that time Peking had explicitly expressed
 an interest in the "peaceful liberation" of Taiwan and professed
 a willingness to enter into negotiations with "the responsible
 local authorities of Taiwan" to prepare this resolution of the
 problem.
 "A NEW START"      Chou concluded his toast with an expression of
 hope that through "a frank exchange of views"
 to gain "a clearer notion of our differences and make efforts
 to find common ground," a "new start" can be made in relations
 between the two countries.  He took not  of the President's

 In a reflection of Peking's evident sensitivity to charges that
 its invitation to the President may enhance his electoral
 prospects, the NCNA account of the 17 November departure cited
 reports that the visit has the support of "a number" of U.S.
 senators--quoting Senator Humphrey by name--and that both houses
 of Congress had approved a resolution supporting the trip.  In
 contrast to other communist sources, Peking's recent comment on
 the President's Vietnam peace initiative avoided citing the U.S.
 election in denigrating his move.
 LEADERSHIP         So far the leadership turnouts for the President
 TURNOUT            have been mostly confined to those active leaders
 thought to be close associates of Chou En-lai,
 and none of the older, semiretired leaders has made an appearance.
 Except for Chiang Ching's appearance at the ballet performance on
 22 February, the Politburo members generally regarded as "leftist"
 in orientation, such as Shanghai leaders Chang Chun-chiao and Yao
 Wen-yuan, have not met the President.
 The President has not yet-seen Tung Pi-wu or Soong Ching-ling, one
 of whom usually functions as chief of state.  Tung, who sometimes
 acts as a host during formal state visits when diplomatic relations

 Haile Selassie.  In a departure from the usual practice, Tung was
 formally designated "acting" PRC chairman in a 24 February message
 to Kuwait on its national day.  He had previously been identified
 as acting chairman in October 1969, in a message to the DRV, but
 he is normally termed deputy chairman.

 In a similar departure-from normal practice, Wu Te was identified
 as "acting" chairman of the Peking revolutionary committee in the
 first NCNA English transmission reporting the President's arrival.
 In a subsequent, fuller account of the arrival and in reports of
 other events, however, he has been identified by his usual title
 of vice chairman.  Wu has served as Peking chief since Hsieh
 Fu-chih dropped from an active public role in 1969, but he has
 not previously been identified as "acting."  The Chinese do not
 normally use the "acting" designator unless the absent holder of
 an office is not expected.to return.   (Chi Peng-fei was designated
 acting foreign minister while Chen I was still alive but presumably
 not expected to be able to resume office.)
 PEKING ASSESSES U.S. CHINA-POLICY BEFORE PRESIDENT'S ARRIVAL
 Coinciding with the President's departure for the trip, Peking
 offered an appraisal of U.S. China policy in a polemical account
 of the President's foreign policy report to Congress.  Peking's
 assessment, an 18 February NCNA account providing the first
 direct Chinese comment on the message, included the first
 substantive discussion.of.the.President's China visit since
 the invitation was announced last July.  The NONA account also
 discussed Secretary Laird's 15 February defense report, observing
 that the two reports complement each other as evidence that U.S.
 foreign policy remains "one of global aggression and power
 politics backed by strength.'
 In addressing sensitive issues of Sino-U.S. relations and the
 President's visit, NCNA.took a firm but balanced approach
 centering on the Taiwan.problemwhile implicitly leaving the
 door open for improving-relations-between the PRC and the United
 States.  NCNA cited the President's observation that China is a
 "dedicated opponent".of.the United States as indicating that
 "U.S. imperialism has no wish to change its hostile policy"
 toward China.  As if to document-this claim, the account quoted
 the President's statements that the dialog with the PRC would not
 be at the expense of friends and..that diplomatic and defense ties
 with the ROC would be maintained..  This showed, according to NCNA,
 that the Nixon Administration has "not yet relinquished" its idea
 of "one China, two governments."
 The formula cited in the.NCNA.acco.unt as objectionable is one that
 was added last year to Peking's list of offensive formulas.  Attacks
 on it, reflecting Peking's. sensitivity over any tendency within the

 international community to accept an accommodation that would
 confer legitimacy on the Chiang regime,               prominent after
 the seating of the P.RC in the United Nations, figuring particularly
 in reaction to Japanese efforts to straddle the Taiwan question.
 The statement quoted-by NCNA on Washington's commitments to the
 ROC is followed immediately in the President's foreign policy report
 by the assertion thatthe.ultimate relationship between Taiwan and
 the mainland is not a matter for the United States to decide and
 that a peaceful resolution of this problem by the parties would
 help reduce tension.  NCNA's failure to cite this assertion is
 consistent with Peking's virtual silence on U.S. suggestions that
 the Taiwan question might be resolved between the contending
 Chinese parties.  Last spring, in reaction to a State Department
 spokesman's suggestion.to.this effect along with his assertion
 that the status of Taiwan remains to be determined and is subject
 to future international resolution, Peki-:g did no more than
 acknowledge and subsequently ignored the former suggestion while
 directing its fire at the notion of Taiwan's status remaining
 undetermined.
 Further elaborating on the Taiwan issue, the NCNA account claimed
 that the President is in the "grip of insuperable self-
 contradiction" in talking about relations with the PRC while
 saying that the United States would not turn -;:s back on its old
 friend in Taiwan.   It added, however, that the PRC "Government
 and people"have "always been friendly toward the American people"
 while  opposing the "policies of war and aggression of U.S.
 imperialism."  This carefully balanced formulation, while failing
 to strike the hopeful note of a new opening that marked last
 spring's ping-pong diplomacy, was notable for associating both
 the government and people of China in. expressing friendship,
 and it avoided an invidiov_ 4istinction between the U.S. Government
 and the American people.
 Rounding out its comment on Taiwan, NCNA reiterated the demand--
 termed an "unswerving position"--that the United States withdraw
 its forces from the island as well as from Indochina, Korea, and
 elsewhere.  When voicing a similar. demand in the context of an
 authoritative discussion of Sino-U.S. relations in mid-1970, a
 Chinese leader had declared that a relaxation of relations was
 "oi'. of the question" .so long as. the United States refused to
 withdraw from Taiwan..  The NCNA account of the foreign policy
 report avoided any such categorical statement.

 24 FEBRUARY 1972
 Underlining Peking's, more flexible approach with an implicit
 justification for receiving the President despite the differences
 recounted by NCNA, the account concluded by stating that affairs
 between countries must be settled-by the countries concerned
 through consultation--a dictum. attributed to Mao in the
 authoritative New Year's Day editordal.  In contrast, Peking's
 assessment of the President's foreign policy report last year
 ended with the forecast.that "a storm of real people's revolution
 will arise" in the United States and sweep him into "the garbage
 heap of history."
 OTHER ISSUES      Apart from the notable discussion of Sino-U.S.
 issues, the NCNA account followed routine lines
 in commenting on other.issues covered in the President's report.
 As part of Peking's effort to reassure its Indochinese allies of
 support, NCNA endorsed the PRG's seven-point peace plan and its
 elaboration of "two key problems," said the questions of the
 Indochinese countries can be settled only by their peoples
 themselves, and claimed that the recent step-up in U.S. air
 activity gave the Lie to the peace talks "fraud" propounded by
 the President on 25 January.
 On other Asian issues, NCNA registered special concern over alleged
 U.S. encouragement of Japanese military expansion, drawing
 implications for Chinese security interests.  Citing the Laird
 report as supporting the modernization of Japan's forces, NCNA
 said Washington's policy would arouse "high vigilance and
 firm opposition" by the Chinese and other Asian peoples.
 Dwelling on plans in the foreign and defense reports calling for
 an expansion of U.S. arms. expenditures, NCNA echoed earlier
 assessments of the same issue in comment on the State of the
 Union message last month, viewing tha military buildup as
 directed chiefly against the USSR -while making no direct
 reference to China's security.  In contrast to Peking's
 treatment of the 1971 foreign policy report as an indication
 of alleged Soviet-American collusion to divide up the world,
 this year's account concentrated mainly on Washington's
 increased competition with Moscow,.parricularly in regard to
 Europe, the Middle East, -and arms development.  NCNA made
 only passing mention of the President's discussion of
 negotiations with the USSR on Berlin, SALT, and other issues
 and avoided altogether his comments on the trip to Moscow this
 spring.

 In line with last year's treatment, Peking's own assessment of
 the President's report was preceded by pickups of hostile foreign
 reaction, including authoritative comment from Hanoi, Tirana, and
 Pyongyang.  But in using this proxy comment Peking took care to
 avoid spoiling the atmosphere surrounding the President's China
 trip, muting the sharp personal invective against the President
 contained in the foreign comment and omitting passages that
 could be read as criticism of the visit.

 MOSCOW EXHIBITS RESTRAINT, USES PROXIES TO STRESS CONCERNS
 Soviet media have handled President Nixon's arrival and activities
 in Peking with the same restraint that marked their anticipatory
 comment, reflecting concern not to jeopardize ongoing U.S.-Soviet
 negotiations or spoil. the atmosphere for the Presider 's impending
 visit to the USSR.  Registering concern over the implications of
 a Sino-U.S. rapproachement, they have continued to impugn Peking's
 motives in particular and to avoid direct censure of the President
 by picturing him as under pressure from "circles" in Washington.
 Scant, slanted cov3rage of the trip in dcmestic media betrays
 Moscow's sensitivity about publicizing the President's summitry
 in Peking to Soviet audiences.  The official attitude was spelled
 out by Yuriy Zhukov in PRAVDA on the eve of President Nixon's
 departure, in a 17 February article belatedly conveying Moscow's
 first authoritative reaction to the President's 9 February report
 to Congress on U.S. foreign policy:  Zhukov wrote that a judgment
 of the trip must await its concrtAo results, while pointing with
 foreboding to  signs that the Peking ',adership and "certain
 circles" in the United States harbor motives detrimental to Soviet
 bloc interests.
 Broadcasts chiefly for foreign consumption have drawn heavily on
 proxy comment from friendly sources and from the Western press to
 sharpen the portrayal of the U.S.-Chinese contacts as anti-Soviet
 in essence and prejudicial to the national liberation movement.
 In broadcasts in Mandarin, Moscow has intensified its efforts to
 fan domestic opposition to the trip.  A broadcast in Mandarin on
 the 22d, not mentioning the trip directly, aired a strong attack
 on the PRC leadership by Polish First Secretary Gierck, including
 an expression of hope that "the Chinese people and the Chinese
 ccrninunists will manage to reject Mao's dangerous line and restore
 socialist principles in China's policy."
 NEWS COVERAGE     TASS' initial report of the President's arrival
 on the 21st read in full:  "U.S. President
 Richard Nixon arrived in Peking for an official visit* today at
 the invitation of the PRC."  This single-sentence report was
 published on the inside pages of the central dailies, where routine
 foreign news items normally appear.  Radio Moscow's announcer, after
 *  As noted above, Peking itself did not attach any such label to
 the visit.

 reading the brief report in the domestic service, went on to cite
 an AFP report that "on the eve of the President's arrival in Peking,
 U.S. B-52's stepped up bombing the entire tf!rritory of Indochina."
 Moscow's only comment so far on the reception accorded the President
 came in a domestic service newscast on the 21st, when the announcer
 observed that the "reserved" welcome at the airport was only
 "a sham" staged for Chinese domestic consumption and that "the real
 action takes place in the wings, .  . . where the Chinese leaders
 offered words of welcome to the White House boss."
 TASS reported later on the 21st that the President met with
 Mao Tse-tung and that "according to R. Ziegler, they had a serious
 and frank talk."  On the 22d, briefly reporting the preceding day's
 banquet, TASS said the speeches delivered by the President and Chou
 indicated that "not only Sino-American relations but also international
 problems are being discussed at the talks."  TASS noted that the
 President "stressed that the sides had common interests that
 outweighed all the differences," and it singled out from Chou's toast
 the statement that bilateral differences "should not prevent China
 and the United States from establishing normal state relations."
 TASS concluded by quoting the New York TIMES to the effect that at
 the banquet the Chinese leadership extended "a heartfelt reception
 to the President, whose traops are still staying in ."aiwan and
 whose armed forces are continuing military operations in Vietnam."
 On the 23d, reporting that the President had his third round of
 talks with Chou and that Secretary Rogers met with Foreign Minister
 Chi Peng-fei, TASS said newsmen in Peking had noted "a sharp step-up
 in the Chinese press coverage of R. Nixon's visit," with pictures
 of the President, Chou, and Chiang Ching attending the ballet.  TASS
 got in a dig at the end:  "Local observers," it said, noticed that
 Peking media were making no references to "American imperialism" and
 that the Peking press has also "sharply reduced reports about
 American air raids on the DRV and the bombings of South Vietnam."
 TASS added that two articles on Vietnam in that day's issue of
 PEOPLE'S DAILY "speak about the struggle of the Vietnamese
 patriots against nameless enemies."
 SOVIET COMMENT      Zhukov's PRAVDA article on the 17th, examining
 the President's foreign policy report, reiterated
 the now standard Soviet position keynoted by Gromyko in the UN
 General Assembly on 28 September:  The USSR regards steps to
 normalize relations between Washington and Peking as "natural" so
 long as "this is not done at the expense of other states' interests."
 Zhukov added suspiciously that "the President considered it necessary

 to point out that while certain U.S. political circles are exert-
 ing pressure in favor of utilizing the new U.S. approach to
 Peking to exploit Sino-Soviet tension, U.S. policy is not
 directed against Moscow."  On the matter of U.S.-Soviet rela-
 tions, the widely broadcast Zhukov article deplored the
 President's "unjustified accusations" against the USSR but
 concluded by citing Brezhnev on the importance of improving
 relations between the two countries.*
 Reasserting the official wait-and-see line on the President's
 China visit, Zhukov went on to state that "the perfectly logical
 thing will be to determine the political essence of this visit
 by its real content and result."  But again the caveat:  "It is
 impossible to ignore the evidence of the desire of both the
 Peking l6ddership and of certain circles in Washington to
 utilize the process of development of Sino-U.S. contacts to
 the detriment of international detente and against the interests
 of the socialist community."
 While Zhukov's article raid not spell out Moscow's specific con-
 cerns, a panelist in Radio Moscow's weetcly roundtable discussion
 on the 20th said that from a close reading of the views of
 "American political. observers" one could infer that the aim
 of U.S.-Chinese contacts, "though it is not discussed openly,
 is to try to divide Asia into spheres of influence--a Chinese
 and an American one."  More pervasively, in some domestic
 comment as well as in propaganda for foreign audiences, Moscow
 has continued to air suggestions that a deal on Indochina,
 behind the backs of the Indochinese, may be in the making in
 Peking.  Kondrashov in IZVESTIYA on 19 February attributed the
 charge to U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.**  There has been wide
 play in this context for U.S. Communist Party leader Gus Hall's
 remark, at the CPUSA congress, that "if the Peking leaders make
 a deal with the ruling circles of the United States, this will
 be a serious threat to peace and the interests of the peoples."
 *  Soviet propaganda on the 54th anniversary of the Soviet army
 and navy, 23 February, treats the United States routinely.  In
 pro forma language which has characterized propaganda on this
 occasion in recent years, Moscow has repledged the USSR to a
 policy of peace, warned against the threat of "imperialism"
 headed by the United States, and affirmed the USSR's intent
 to maintain an adequate defense posture.

 of this propaganda line.

 PRAVDA DEFENDS CPSU'S CHINA POLICY ON EVE OF NIXON TRIP
 Concern to offset the notion that Soviet intransigence toward
 the PRC had exacerbated Sino-Soviet tensions and thereby
 spurred Peking to turn toward the United States seemed
 reflected in a PRAVDA article by 0. Borisov on 18 February,
 expounding a gratuitous defense of the CPSU's China policy
 on the day after the President began his journey to Poking.
 Widely broadcast to communist audiences in particular, the
 article, entitled "The CPSU's Foreign Policy and the Further
 Consolidation of the World Socialist System," sought to absolve
 the Soviet leadership of blame for the current low estate of
 relations with Peking and to put the onus for current tension
 squarely on the Chinese leaders.  Elaborating the stock Soviet
 argument on this score, Borisov maintained that while the Soviet
 party and government have been pursuing "a principled, con-
 sistent" course toward normalization of relations with the
 PRC, "this course has encountered stubborn resistance from the
 Peking leaders, who stand on positions of anti-Sovietism,
 great-power chauvinism, and nationalism."  Moreover, Borisov
 charged, Peking's policy of "anti-Sovietism" has "intensified"
 in connection with the President's trip to the PRC.
 Setting out to document a portrayal of failures in Chinese
 foreign policy, Borisov cited the PRC's support for Pakistan
 in the conflict with India and added that in general Peking's
 leaders have been "unmasked as supporters of the aggravation
 of international tension."  In the same vein, he said the
 Chinese leadership's efforts to make Peking the center of the
 world movement have failed, as have their attempts to create
 a pro-Peking bloc among the socialist countries and to "torpedo
 CEMA and the Warsaw Pact."  In sharp contrast, Borisov main-
 tained, communist unity has been enhanced by the "tireless
 efforts" of the CPSU and the Soviet state, and "the peace-loving
 policy of the Soviet Union has borne fruit."
 RADIO MOSCOW SEEKS TO FAN ALBANIAN ANXIETIES OVER VISIT
 In a blatant effort to play on Tirana's suspicions about the
 President's talks with its principal ally, a Radio Moscow
 broadcast to Albania on 20 February observed that "Peking's
 turn toward Washington has created a very dangerous situation
 for Albania."  The broadcast explained that since Albania is

 depundent on the PRC politically, economically, and militarily,
 it cannot openly criticize the President's trip to Peking; but
 neither can it decrease its criticism of Washington, because"this
 would have a negative influence on the prestige of Albanian
 leaders."  The broadcast went on to say that Washington is
 interested in improving relations only with Peking--"a policy
 based on anti-Sovietism"--and "has no intention of recogni.-ing
 the Albanian People's Republic," against which it has been
 pursuing a hostile policy since the end of World War It.
 Another Moscow broadcast to Albania on the 22d, bemoaning Tirana's
 estrangement from the Warsaw Pact, concluded that "historical
 experience shows that Albania, as a poor socialist state, can
 develop comprehensively only under conditions of equal coopera-
 tion with all the socialist countries."
 So far, Tirana's coverage of the President's visit to Peking has
 been limited to very brief reports, attributed to NCNA, of the
 President's arrival, his talks with Chou, and his attendance at
 the banquet.
 EAST EUROPEAN ALLIES STRESS "ANTI-SOVIET" ASPECT OF TRIP
 Moscow's hardlining allies in Eastern Europe have followed its
 thematic lead but not--with the notable exceptions of Budapest
 and East Berlin--its restraint.  There have been pro forma
 echoes of the official Soviet position that normalization of
 Peking-Washington relations is a "natural" development which
 can only be welcomed if it contributes to peace and does not
 adversely affect other countries.  The Czechoslovak party organ
 RUDE PRAVO, reasserting this line on 21 February, noted that
 it was shared by "our allies."  But the dominant line is that
 the two conditions are not likely to be met.   Czechoslovak,
 Polish, and Bulgarian comment is pervaded by charges that anti-
 Soviet motives underlie the Siro-U.S. contacts, as well as by
 suggestions that the Chinese leaders are prepared to sell out
 Hanoi in a deal with Washington.  Prague's comment has been
 notable for recollections of the Sino-Soviet border clashes
 in an effort to dramatize the portrayal of a U.S. exploitation
 of a bellicose Chinese stance toward the Soviet Union.
 East Germany, by contrast, has refrained so far from any original
 comment, although the party organ NEUES DEUTSCHLAND and the East
 Berlin radio have aired a few commentaries on the trip from

 other Soviet bloc sources stressing the alleged anti-Soviet
 aspect.  Hungarian comment has been measured in tone and so
 far  devoid of charges of anti-Sovietism.
 Romania gave the President's trip predictably ample news coverage
 from the outset, prudently holding off until the 23d before
 welcoming the visit in an authoritative article in SCINTEIA.
 Yugoslav media have registered enthusiastic applause for the
 trip, calling the Mao-Nixon meeting an augury of "serious possi-
 bilities for a rapprochement."
 PRAGUE ON PRC        Czechoslovak comment prior to and during the
 MILITARY STANCE      trip has been unique in elaborating on U.S.
 use of the Chinese military stance vis-a-vis
 the Soviet Union.      Thus RUDE PRAVO commented in an article on
 the 12th that "the murderous volleys" fired by Chinese soldiers
 at the Ussuri River in 1969 "awakened Nixon and his 'China'
 policy" to the opportunity to secure Chinese "cooperation"
 against the Soviet Union.  On the 17th the paper seized on a
 statement by Secretary Laird to the effect "that Chinese guided
 missilesare threatening the majority of cities and other targets"
 in south and east Asia "and a substantial part of the Soviet
 Union."  In thus "setting one socialist country against another,"
 it added, the Secretary was spurred by the policy of the PRC
 leadership "with its anti-Soviet orientation."  On the 22d,
 RUDE PRAVO reported an "extensive campaign" by Chinese authori-
 ties to "explain" the President's visit to the Chinese people,
 in which Chinese soldiers were "reminded of the recent clashes
 on the Sino-Soviet borders" and told that "the Russians were
 worse than the Americans."
 GIEREK ON MAO   PZPR First Secretary Gierek, rumored to be at
 odds with the Soviets over some aspects of his
 domestic reforms, delivered one of the most vigorous attacks
 against Mao's leadership by any East European party leader to
 date, in a Katowice election speech on the 21st.  Without mention-
 ing the President's visit directly, Gierek said China "is now
 turning against its natural and infallible allies, the socialist
 countries," adding that the course of "the Maoist Chinese leader-
 ship is aimed against the interests of the entire socialist
 community, including the vital interests of Poland."  He came
 close to calling for the overthrow of Mao in voicing a "hope
 that the Chinese people and the Chinese communists will find
 enough strength to discard the dangerous Maoist course . .  . ."

 A fairly heavy volume of Polish comment on the President's trip
 has emphasized the alleged anti-Soviet aspects.  An article in
 the 24-:.lJFebruary issue of the government daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY,
 entitled "Nixon's Chinese Gambit." argued that despite alleged
 assurances by the President and his aides that "their Chinese
 gambit is not directed against the Soviet Union at all," other
 statements in U.S. media "leave no doubt" that the move is
 designed as "a trump card in the anti-Soviet game."
 BUDAPEST     A relatively small volume of comment in Budapest
 media so far has treated the visit with some detach-
 ment and in language largely free of invective.  Thus the Hungarian
 Government daily MAGYAR HIRLAP on the 21st "approved" the
 resumed U.S.-Chinese contacts and added only that it was "diffi-
 cult" to say whether eased tensions would result.   In low-keyed
 terms, it commented that "the press of the socialist countries
 considers the escalation of the U.S. air war in Indochina the
 most regrettable prelude to Nixon's Peking visit."
 25X1
 Starting on the mornj.ng of the 21st, the Bucharest
 radio carried factuat reports on the President's
 arrival in Peking and subsequent activities, including his
 "serious and frank" talks with Mao and summaries of the toasts
 exchanged by the President and Chou En-lai.  All the reports
 cited NCNA as the source.
 The first original commentary in Bucharest media appeared on the
 23d--a SCINTEIA article by one of the paper's leading inter-
 national commentators, V. Iliescu, summarized at length by
 AGERPRES.  Entitled "A Positive Event in International Life,"
 the article welcomed the U.S. break with a long-standing policy
 of "ignoring the existence of the People's Republic of China"
 and hailed the trip as "proof of a realistic stand."  Predictably,
 SCINTEIA took the occasion to press Romania's advocacy of
 "negotiations and direct contacts" among all states, declaring
 that the President's China visit and his planned journey to the

 Soviet Union "are fresh proofs of the universal validity of this
 method."  Reiterating Bucharest's line on the need for "active
 participation of. R11" states in the solution of international
 problems, Iliepcu concluded that "public opinion" in Romania
 is following the Sino-American dialog "with interest" and
 believes it will "stimulate the positive course of events
 towards detente" and world peace.

 Vietnamese communist media have continued to ignore President Nixon's
 trip to Peking while pressing their vitriolic attack on the Fresident
 and his policies.  The recent series of articles by NHAN LAN's
 Commentator included one on the 19th which observed pointedly that the
 Vietnamese are victoriously fighting against U.S. "aggressive
 imperialism, the number one enemy of all nations."  On 22 February,
 the day after the President arrived in Peking, VNA announced that
 the People's Army Publishing House has put out a took entitled
 "Nixon's Criminal Records" which documents "crimes" perpetrated
 under the Vietnamization policy.
 The U.S. air strikes against the North on the 16th and 17th, during
 which Hanoi claimed seven planes were downed, prompted a DRV Foreign
 Ministry statement--the first issued at that level rather  than by
 the ministry spokesman since the flurry of statements during the
 sustained strikes at the end of December.  The air strikes and other
 U.S. "escalation" moves are called further proof of the "hypocrisy"
 of the President's eight points.  Propagandists continue to demand a
 positive response to the PRG's seven-point proposal, particularly to
 the "two key points" elaborated on 2 February.
 On the eve of President Nixon's arrival in Peking, the PRC went on
 record as officially supporting the DRV's protest against the
 16-17 February U.S. bombings with a 19 February PRC Foreign Ministry
 statement followed by a PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article the next
 day.  Peking normally supports DRV Foreign Ministry statements in
 this manner, and had done so during the December strikes.
 Thus far Moscow has failed to react officially to the recent U.S.
 bombings of the DRV, although TASS as usual promptly reported the
 DRV Foreign Ministry statement.  The strikes at the end of last
 yea- had occasioned a 30 December Soviet Government statement.
 Moscow comment has pointed out that the recent escalated bombings
 took place on the eve of the President's trip to Peking and has
 continued to warp of a backstage Sino-U.S. deal on Indochina.
 DRV. PRG ATTACK PRESIDENT. MAINTAIN SILENCE ON PEKING VISIT
 On the eve of the President's trip to Peking, Hanoi and Front media
 sustained their sharp attacks on U.S. policy.  Particularly noteworthy
 is a 19 February NRAN DAN Commentator article which discusses the
 unchanging nature of imperialism in orthodox terms, saying President
 Nixon "has revealed" that Vietnam is to be used as "a major springboard
 for attacks on the world socialist system."  The article also continues

 Hanoi's personal abuse of the President when it says he "speaks
 of peace tirelessly, but the more he does so, the more affirmatively
 the world public, thinking of his acts, brands him a loathsome,
 bloodthirsty hawk.  He fervently calls for an end to the war
 while actually prolonging and expanding it.  He publicizes his
 readiness for negotiations, E'tt keeps blocking all progress at the
 Paris conference."
 While the Commentator article, like other Vietnamese communist
 propaganda, avoids any explicit mention of the President's visit
 to Peking,* it is presumably with the visit in mind that the
 article says that "while trotting around the globe to peddle his
 peace philter," the President continues to escalate the war.  The
 article was initially carried only by VNA in English and in
 Vietnamese, but Hanoi radio broadcast it belatedly in the domestic
 service on 24 February--at a time when P#.king was giving ample
 publicity to the President's visit.
 The Commentator article does not repeat Hanoi's charge that a prime
 aim of U.S. policy is to split the socialist countries, but this
 charge recurs in a Liberation Radio commentary broadcast in
 Vietamese on the 22d, the day after the President arrived in Peking.
 The commentary echoes earlier Hanoi propaganda when it says that
 at the beginning of his career the President "revealed his frenzied
 opposition to communism, to the sccialist countries, and to the
 world national liberation movement."  It adds:  "After the Chinese
 revolution triumphed in 1949 Nixon was deeply embi~tered and
 nurtured an unabated grudge . . .  .  He sought by all means to
 capitalize on the internal disagreements of the socialist camp in
 order to further his interests, split countries in the socialist
 camp and the world communist movement, and perform the trick of
 'peaceful evolution' through economic cooperation and other

 maneuvers."  The commentary concludes that no matter how frequently
 the President may today insist "that he is eaber for peace and is
 opening an era of negotiations, ho can in no way conceal his crimes
 and his extremely reactionary nature."
 Hanoi had most recently repeated the charge of U.S. attempts to
 divide the socialist countries in the NHAN DAN Commentator
 article of 13 February which accused the President of professing a
 "readiness to negotiate" in order to divide the gocialist camp.
 Similar charges had appeared in the 10 February NHAN DAN
 Commentator article and in broadcasts early this month of
 Truong Chinh's speech delivered at the Vietnam Fatherland Front
 congress in December.  The alleged maneuvers of the President to
 divide the socialist countries had also been cited in an article
 by Thanh Tin in the January issue of the DRV party journal
 HOC TAP.  Thanh Tin has analyzed U.S. policy in articles in
 HOC TAP in January or February of each year since 1969.  This
 year's article, labeling the President an "archimperialist,"
 echoed the tone of Tin's January 1971 article, which said the
 President had "achieved records for his stubbornness, brazenness,
 and brutality."

 MOSCOW! LINKS BOMBINGS WITH NIXON TRIP, SCORES EIGHT POINTS
 Thus far Moscow has failed to react officially to the 16-17 February
 U.S. bombings of the DRV,* although TASS as usual promptly reported
 the DRV Foreign Ministry and Foreign Ministry spokesman's statements
 as well as the 19 February Hanoi press conference at which five
 captured American pilots were presented.
 ATTACKS        Moscow's comment has pointed out repeatedly that the
 ON PEKING      escalated bombings took place on the eve of President
 Nixon's trip to Peking, continuing at the same time
 to play on Vietnamese fears of a backstage Sino-U.S. deal on
 Indochina.  Commentators say the timing of the bombings is designed
 to show Peking that the United States intends to maintain its
 influence in Asia, and they again say that Washington has been
 gratified at Peking's restrained reaction to the bombings of the
 past few months.  A Kuznetsov domestic service commentary on the
 21st described as a "stage play" both "certain pronouncements in
 Peking propaganda" criticizing U.S. Vietnam policy on the eve of
 President Nixon's arrival and Peking's "reserved" airport reception
 of the President. TASS and Moscow radio reports on the 23d,
 citing "local observers" on the absence of references to "U.S.
 imperialism" in the Peking press while the President is in China,
 noted that two PEOPLE'S DAILY articles that day referred to the
 Vietnamese patriots' struggle against "nameless enemies."
 A Kondrashov article in IZVESTIYA on the 19th typified Moscow's
 comment raising the spectre of a backstage deal on Indochina,
 generally using the proxy of Western press observers or East
 European communist media.  Kondrashov quoted U.S. NEWS AND WORLD
 REPORT as saying the President evidently hopes that "as signs of
 agreement with the United States grow, Peking will make use of
 its influence in Hanoi to arrange an acceptable settlement of the
 conflict in Indochina."  Ukraintsev picked up the same quotation
 in a domestic service commentary on the same day and claimed that
 "U.S. Administration spokesmen have repeatedly said they hope to
 reach some kind of agreement with Peking on matters linked to the
 Indochina war."  The Americans are relieved at Peking's "restrained
 reaction" to the U.S. bombing, Ukraintsev said, repeating the
 *  Moscow had waited until the end of the sustained 26-30 December
 bombings of the DRV to react officially, but it reacted then at a
 higher level than either Hanoi or Peking--with a 30 December
 statement at the government rather than the foreign ministry level.

 frequent charge that the bombings are aimed at inducing an
 Indochina settlement advantageous to the United States.
 The charge of a Sino-U.S. deal on Indochina was elaborated in a
 broadcast in Mandarin on the 18th over the purportedly unofficial
 Radio Peace and Progress, which called the "premeditated" bombing
 a prelude to the talks in Peking--a demonstration that the U.S.
 stand on the Vietnam issue is "still stiff."  The broadc::st cited
 "American observers" as saying President Nixon will try to make
 the Chinese leaders agree to a "compromising settlement" behind
 the backs of the Vietnamese.  It went on to charge that Washington
 has hinted that U.S. economic aid to China and Sino-U.S.
 trade will depend on "China's patticipation in the collusion
 behind the Vietnamese people's backs."
 U.S. EIGHT POINTS      Some commentators say President Nixon's
 peace plan is merely a "smokescreen of
 peace rhetoric" to cover up intensified aggression.  Alexey
 Leontyev said i.n a 21 February English-language talk, for example,
 that by making proposals which the other side cannot accept,
 Washington is "trying to justify continued military operations
 ratb^r than promote negotiations."
 While Moscow has followed Hanoi's lead in focusing on the U.S.
 proposals for U.S. troop withdrawal and elections in South Vietnam,
 an IZVESTIYA article by Mikheyev on the 16th also brought up a
 cease-fire and prisoner exchange.  Mikheyev complained that the
 U.S. plan makes withdrawal conditional n't only on the release
 of captured U.S. pilots but also on a cease-fire throughout
 Indochina, calling this a demand that the communists lay down
 their arms and reconcile themselves to "U.S.-supported regimes."
 The commentator also observed that the eight points speak only
 of the withdrawal of U.S. "troops," not of U.S. "advisers," nor
 of the cessation of U.S. military aid to Saigon, Phnom Penh, and
 Vientiane or the liquidation of U.S. bases in Indochina and
 Thailand.  He commented that the proposal on the South Vietnamese
 elections is merely an effort to preserve the Saigon army, police,
 and administrative apparatus and that Thieu's "retirement" would
 thus be meaningless and the election a "farce" like his election
 in October 1971.  Mikheyev concluded with an expression of support
 for the PRG's 2 February "elaboration" of its seven points, citing
 the substance of the proposals including the new demands for a
 deadline for U.S. troop withdrawal and Thieu's resignation.

 PRC OFFERS PRO FORMA SUPPORT TO DRV ON U.S, AIR STRIKES
 On the eve of President Nixon's arrival in Peking, the PRC went
 on record as officially supporting the DRV Foreign Ministry
 statement protesting the 16-17 February U.S. bombings in the usual
 manner, with a PRC Foreign Ministry statement on the 19th and a
 PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article on the 20th.  While the state-
 ment assails Secretary Laird by name for making "truculent war
 threats" in asserting that such "so-called 'protective reaction'
 raids" will continue, it does not mention President Nixon or the
 "Nixon Administration."  The most recent previous PRC Foreign
 Ministry statement on the bombing, on 29 December, made a passing
 reference to the Nixor_ Administration.
 The current statement complains that "the 'eight-point proposal'
 recently dished up by the U.S. Government was camouflaged with
 the cloak of 'ending the war"' and says that the current actions
 "shed the disguise of sham peace and laid bare the aggressive
 features of the U.S. aggressors," but unlike the December state-
 ment it does not take the United States to task for failing to
 respond to the PRG's seven-point proposal or for having
 "obstructed" the Paris talks.  It does, however, conclude with the
 demand that the "U.S. Government" stop its war of aggression in
 Indochina, "cease to support the puppet regimes in the Indochinese
 countries," and withdraw U.S. and "vassal" troops totally,
 unconditionally, and by a set date.  The statement scores "U.S.
 imperialism" for attempting to bolster its "Vietnamization" plan
 by air war in order to perpetuate its "forcible occupation" of
 South Vietnam, but it does not mention "Laoization" or "Khmerization"
 as the December statement did.
 The statement concludes with the affirmation that the Chinese
 Government and people "firmly support" the Vietnamese and other
 Indochinese peoples in their war against "U.S. aggression" but
 does not add the warning, contained in the December statement,
 that the Chinese Government and people are "closely watching"
 U.S. moves in Indochina.   It says that U.S. imperialism "cannot
 shake the Vietnamese people's determination to fight their war
 of resistance to the end," but it avoids expressions of
 gratification, which appeared in the December statement, over
 U.S. "disastrous defeats" in Indochina and the "exciting victories"
 of the people in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
 The PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article similarly avoided mentioning
 the President by name while scoring Secretary Laird's warning of the

 possibility of continued "protective reaction" raids.  The
 article complained that while the "U.S. Government" professes
 a desire to "end the war" in Vietnam, "its acts are contrary
 to its professions."  Commentator went on to assail the "war
 provocations and blackmail" of "U.S. imperialism."  Expressing
 the "full support" of the Chinese Government and people for
 the DRV stand in the 17 February DRV statement, the article
 added--unlike the PRC Foreign Ministry statement--that the U.S.
 Government "must accept" the PRG's seven-point proposal but dio
 not mention the PRG's 2 February "elaboration."  PEOPLE'S
 DAILY expressed the conviction that the Vietnamese and other
 Indochinese peopl-se, "fighting in unity," will win final victory.
 DRV CLAIMS SEVEN PLANES DOWNED, DISPLAYS CAPTURED PILOTS
 The heavy U.S. air strikes on 16-17 February just above the
 demilitarized zone in Vinh Linh area and Quang Binh Province
 were first protested in a routine DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's
 statement on 16 February.  A DRV Foreign Ministry statement
 appeared the next day--the first at that level since the 26 and
 29 December 1971 foreign ministry statements issued during the
 intensive 26-30 December raids against North Vietnam.*
 In its initial report on the 16th, Hanoi mentioned strikr'q "at a
 number of populated areas in Quang Binh Province and Vinh "inh
 zone" and claimed that two ilanes were downed and "a number of
 aggressor pilots annihilated or captured."  The foreign ministry
 spokesman's statement issued later in the day repeated the
 claim of downed planes and charged that the United States had
 sent "many fighter aircraft to repeatedly strike at many areas"
 in Vinh Linh and Le Thug district, Quang Binh Province.  On the
 17th a radio report said that U.S. planes had "attacked a number
 of populated areas in Quang Binh" that day and that four planes
 were downed and "many aggressor pilots wiped out or captured."
 It claimed that in addition to the two planes downed the
 preceding day, "the Vinh Linh armed forces and people downed
 one more planethat was not previously reported," making a total
 of seven for the two days and bringing Hanoi's grand total to
 3,440.

 On the 24th, Ilanoa. lasued another 1)IWV Forel.gn NI.n1.str.y spokesman's
 statement condemning U.S. "will- acts" from 1.8 to 23 February.
 During that period, the spokesman charged, U.S. planes including
 B-52's bombed 1'  )ng Lap village and U.S. artillery "from south
 of the demi.l.itLiilzed zone" and U.S. ships shelled the villages
 of Vinh Son, Vinh Gl.ang, Vinh 0, -ivid Vinh Quang, located "north
 of the 17th parallel in the DMZ."  He also charged that U.S.
 aircraft "daily strafed a number of positions" in Quang B.Lnh
 Province from 18 to 22 February.
 The foreign ministry statement of the 17th charged that the United
 States on the .,6th and 17th had "repeatedly" sent many aircraft
 against heavily populated areas in the Vinh Linh area and Quang
 Binh Province, and it "strongly condemned this new extremely
 serious U.S. military adventure" against the DRV.  The spokesman's
 statement the day before had called the strikes on the 16th
 "extremely serious acts of war"--a more usual description.  The
 foreign ministry statement paralleled earlier ones in calling
 the strikes a challenge to U.S. and world public opinion and a
 "gross encroachment upon the sovereignty and security of the
 DRV."  But it stopped short of the harsh 29 December statement,
 which had called on the governments and peoples of the "fraternal
 and peace- and justice-loving nations" to struggle to stay the
 hands of the "U.S. aggressors" and had pointedly noted that the
 DRV is a "socialist country and a sovereign and independent
 nation."
 The 17 February foreign ministry statement inexplicably did not
 include the charge that the strikes violate the U.S. pledge to
 cease bombing of the North--a charge contained in all seven of
 the previous DRJ Foreign Ministry statements on U.S. actions
 against the North issued during the Nixon Administration.  But
 U.S. statements on continued bombing so long as the U.S.
 prisoners are held are again scored in a 24 February DRV War

 policies are prolonging and expanding the war and causing more
 "crimes," was reportedly sent to the antiwar assembly held in
 Versailles from 11 to 13 February.

 25 January, 'rcynically declared that 'the United ;states reserves
 the right to resume bombing North Vietnam us long as our men are
 detained."'  Thu document cites the periods of bombings in 1.970
 and 1971 which had prompted DRV Foreign Ministry statements.       It
 does not mention the 1.6-1.7 February itrikem specifically, but
 4, seems to allude to them when it  arns that as long as the
 United States persists In its Vietnamization policy and bombing
 of the North, captured U.3. military men will continue to be
 detained "and the list will be made still longer, as was shown
 by the outcome of the U.S. air strikes .aunched against North
 Vietnam in late 1971 and early 1972."
 The spokesman's protest on the 1.6th said that the U.S. "seriouj
 acts of war" had unmasked "the fraudulent peace allegations of
 the Nixon Administration."  The foreign ministry statement similarly
 said that the Administration's "deceitful protestation of peace"
 had been exposed.   In cataloging alleged U.S. provocations, the
 statement assailed the dispatch of additional aircraft carriers
 and B-52's to the area and U.S. "threats" to use air power against
 the DRV.  And it noted that the United States had "arbitrarily
 postponed for an indefinite period of time the 145th session of
 the Paris conference."  While neither of the protests mentioned the
 U.S. eight-point proposal, it has been brought up in other comment
 on the air strikes.  For example, a NHAN DAN editorial on the 19th
 said that the air strikes, coming on the heels of the "brazen
 undermining" of the Paris talks, show that the eight points "are
 obviously for deceitful purposes."
 Hanoi did not reveal the exact number of
 pilots captured until they were presented at
 a press conference on the 19th by Ngo Dien, chief of the Information
 and Press Department of the DRV Foreign Ministry.  Dien recalled
 two similar press conferences last December* as he introduced the
 five captured pilots and charged that they afforded further evidence
 of the Nixon Administration's "crimes."  The pilots, according to
 Ha-'oi's radio report, were photographed and allowed to speak
 briefly.  They were identified as Ralph W. Galati, William R.
 Schwertfeger, Kenneth J. Fraser, James D. Cutter, and Edwin A. Hawley.
 Dien asserted at the press conference that the U.S. bombings in the
 latter part of 1971 had been "severely condemned" by public opinion

 and that the now strikes "clearly prove that the Nixon Administration
 is a warlike and stubborn administration,"  lie derided the
 Administration for "boasting about peace" and its eight-point plan
 while engaging in actions that contradict irs words.  Dien also
 charged that contrary to U.S. statements announcing the end of the
 bombing of the North, on the 18th "many aircraft" were again sent
 to bomb many regions in Quang Binh and "warships close to the
 shore opened fire on the Vinh Linh zone."
 Dien referred disparagingly to the Administration's concern about
 U.S. prisoners of war, ztating that the only way to secure their
 release is to end the war and respect the basic national rights of
 the Vietnamese people as set forth by the PRG in its seven-point
 proposal and the two-point clarification of 2 February.
 VIGILANCE      The claimed downing of the seven planes and the
 capture of the pilots prompted immediate praise from
 the VPA High Command and the press as evidence of heightened
 vigilance in Quang Binh and Vinh Linh.  On the 17th a VPA High
 Command congratulatory message* applauded the downings, as did
 NHAN DAN and Hanoi radio  ;ommentakies. A QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 editorial followed on the 18th, and a NHAN DAN editorial on the
 19th.  The VPA High Command message commended the armed forces
 and people of Quang Binh and Vinh Linh for "scoring outstanding
 early-spring feats of arms" in "heightening vigilance and fighting
 well." Asserting that the United States "will resort to many more
 reckless schemes and moves to intensify the war in order to
 avert their inevitable failure," it warned that the people and
 armed forces "must therefore be very vigilant and stand combat-ready."
 There are routine calls for heightened vigilance and combat
 readiness, particularly in the QUAN DOI NHAN DAN's editorial of the
 18th.  The editorial registers confidence, claiming that throughout
 the North  he people and armed forces "were prepared to spot,
 intercept, and destroy the U.S. aggressors if they dared attack us."
 But it urges further efforts to emulate Quang Binh and Vinh Linh
 and notes that those exemplary areas are not "subjective"  or
 complacent over their achievements.
 The 19 February NHAN DAN editorial says that "for nearly two months,
 implementing the High Command's combat order," Quang Binh and
 Vinh Linh "have made every effort to enhance combat-readiness
 and increase their fighting strength."  It points to the preparedness

 DRV, PRG PROTEST U,S, POSTPONEMENT, WALK OUT OF PARIS SESSION
 The U.S. postponement of the 145th Paris session scheduled for
 17 February was protested by the DRV and PRG delegations in
 statements issued in Paris on the 16th and carried in Vietnamese
 communist media the following day.  On the 17th both delegations
 sent messages to the allied delegations--publicized by VNA on the
 18th and by LPA on the 19th--again protesting the unilateral
 decision to cancel the session and proposing that the 145th session
 be held on the 24th.
 On 24 February LPA and VNA, within an hour of each other, reported the
 developments at the 145th session that day--with the DRV and the PRG
 reading separate statements on suspension of the meeting and proposing
 that the 146th session be held on 2 March.  VNA, but not LPA, reported
 that the two communist delegations walked out after reading their
 statements.
 The DRV statement, read by Xuan Thuy, said the decision to suspend the
 145th session was a manifestation of the DRV Foreign Ministry's
 "vigorous protest" over the 16-17 February U.S. air strikes against
 North Vietnam.  Thuy did not mention the Versailles gathering explicitly
 when he accused "the U.S. delegate" of using "gross" language with
 z-.gard to"peace-loving people of the world, including the American
 people."  And he said that in its 23 February message to the DRV, the
 U.S. delegation "implied that it would continue to sabotage the Paris
 conference."  Thuy's statement repeated the claim that the U.S.
 "escalation" of the air war further exposed the "fallacious"
 character of the Nixon Administration's words about peace.  The PRG's
 statement on the 16th, protesting the U.S.  postponement of the
 session, had specifically mentioned the eight-point plan in saying
 its nature was exposed by the stepped-up military action and the
 increase in B-52 sorties.

 LE DUC TWO MEETS U.S. VISITOR; OTHER LEADERS' MOVES REPORTED
 VNA announced on 22 February that the American scientist George Wald
 had recently visited the DRV and, while there, had met a number of
 captured U.S. pilots and talked with Le Duc Tho.  The report
 identified Tho in his position as special advisor to the DRV
 delegation to the Paris conference and said that the meeting, on
 21 February, was "cordial."  VNA said that Tho "further explained"
 to Wald the "serious stand and well-wishing attitude of Vietrsm"
 and stressed that the Vietnamese would fight "until complete victory."
 Le Duc Tho has not normally met with Americans visiting the DRV,
 although he--along with Pham Van Dong and Nguyen Duy Trinh--received
 Cyrus Eaton and his wife in December 1969.  Dung is the leader who
 most frequently meets visiting Americansi when they are received at
 a high-level; Hanoi reported his meetings with at least three U.S.
 antiwar delegations last year.  It is possible that Dong did not meet
 with Wald during his week-long stay in Hanoi because the Premier has
 been occupied with activities surrounding the visit of Sihanouk, who
 arri?.~ed in Hanoi on 12 February.  On the 23d VNA announced that Dong
 had accompanied Sihanouk on a trip to Haiphong and the Quang Ninh
 coal mining area from 19 to 21 February.  Hanoi's reports on
 Sihanouk's public activities have also noted that on 14 February,
 on the eve of the lunar new year (Tet), he was received by Le Duan,
 Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Nguyen Duy Trinh.
 Hanoi media reported that Dong accompanied Sihanouk during his
 activities on the 15th, but there have been no reports on what
 Sihanouk did from 16 through 18 February.
 Consistent with past practice, Hanoi media during the week since Tet
 have been publicizing various holiday activities by the DRV leadership,
 but without providing precise dates.  For example, as late as
 23 February VNA noted that "on the occasion of the lunar new year"
 Le Duc Tho had visited medical facilities trevting "cadres back from
 the front."  Similarly, a 21 February domestic broadcast noted
 that Truong Chinh had "recently" visited a foreign trade branch
 exhibit, and a broadcast on the 20th said Le Duan had paid a Tet
 visit to a publishing house.* Other low-level activities of Le Duc Tho
 in Hanoi were noted on 24 February in a VNA report that on the 22d he
 had visited an art museum.

 HANOI ARMY PAPER REVIEWS INDOCHINESE MILITARY SITUATION
 Hanoi comment on the military situation includes an article in the
 17 February QUAN DOI NUAN DAN, broadcast to the domestic audience,
 which offers some new analysis of allied military Strategy while
 reflecting the standard optimism that the Indochinese "peoples"
 are in an advantageous war situation.  Reviewing the fighting
 throughout Indochina, the article turns first to Laos where, it
 routinely claims, the "enemy" in late 1971 was "dealt a staggering
 blow on the Plain of Jars."  In a seeming allusion to allied
 speculation about the likelihood of an offensive in South Vietnam
 this winter, the article notes that the action on the Plain of
 Jars took place "while the Nixon clique was fearfully making
 preparations to cope with the eventual attacks by the PLAF
 on various battlefields in South Vietnam."  The allies' "strategic"
 defeat, according to QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, not only worsened their
 military position in Laos but also "had a strong effect on the
 general situation" in Indochina and undermined "the Americans'
 big scheme to attract and disperse their adversary's forces on
 the northern Laos front in order to shield their lackeys' troops
 in South Vietnam."
 Also surveying the fighting in Cambodia, the article maintains
 that the balance of forces in that country is "very unfavorable
 for the Americans and their lackeys."  Arguing that South
 Vietnamese troops can no longer assist the Phnom Penh forces,
 the article notes the recent pullback of ARVN forces from Cambodia,
 adding that their "defens.Lve position in northeastern Saigon, in
 the high plateau, and in the Mekong Delta has obviously worsened."
 It cites action in various parts of South Vietnam, asserting among
 other things, that Saigon troops have been "strongly attacked" in
 the highlands and that "the Kontum and Pleiku provincial capitals
 have been under pressure and on permanent alert."
 QTTAN DOI NHAN DAN maintains that the allies have failed in their
 effort to "attract and disperse their adversary's forces" and that
 "the Americans' setbacks in Laos and Cambodia have affected their
 war situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield, causing the
 Saigon puppet troops to become more passive."  It concludes,
 routinely, with the prediction that the Indochinese peoples will
 continue to deal "new painful blows on all battlefields."

 PRC  FOREIGN                     AFFAIRS
 FBIS TRENDS
 24 FEBRUARY 1972
 NEW APPROAC;i SHOWN IN ONE OF TWO NEW RECOGNITION AGREEMENTS
 Peking has sustained its diplomatic momentum with announcements
 on 15 and 19 February on the establishment of diplomatic relations
 with Mexico and Argentina, representing the 21st and 22d such
 accords in the series of agreements beginning with the one with
 Canada in October 1970.   In addressing the Taiwan issue, the
 agreement with Argentina followed the Canadian formula--
 Argentina recognized the PRC Government as the "sole legal
 government of China" and added noncommittally that it "takes
 note" of Peking's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan.  In line
 with the recognition agreement with Peru late last year,,the
 Chinese expressed support for Argentina's claim to jurisdictio<
 over adjacent waters to a limit of 200 miles.  The communique
 also recorded agreement to adopt "active measures for the
 development of trade."
 In contrast to this unexceptional treatment of the Taiwan and
 other issues in a recognition agreement, the agreement with
 Mexico and the followup PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on 17 February
 notably departed from Peking's practice since October 197n by
 passing up all prior formulas for dealing with the PRC's claim
 to be the sole government of China.  The Sino-Mexican communique
 made no mention of this claim or of Taiwan, stating simply that
 the two sides had decided to establish relations on the basis
 of what amounts to four of the five principles of peaceful
 coexistence.*  In Peking's only allusion to the Taiwan problem
 in connection with this recognition agreement, the PEOPLE'S
 DAILY editorial cited Mexican President Echeverria's speech
 in support of seating the PRC in the United Nations last fall
 for the statement that "the sovereignty and territorial
 integrity" of the PRC are "juridically indivisible"; PEOPLE'S
 DAILY noted that Mexico had subsequently undertaken the
 "courageous" step of breaking its relations with the Chiang
 Kai-shek government.
 *  The fifth of the principles, the one specifically dealing with
 "peaceful coexistence," was omitted.  The use of the five principles
 of coexistence in the series of recognition agreements has
 followed no regular pattern.  The principles of "nonaggression"
 and "peaceful coexistence" were omitted in the agreements with
 Canada, Italy, Chile, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Lebanon, and
 Iceland.  The principle of "nonaggression" was omitted in the
 agreements with Cyprus and Cameroon.  None of the five principles
 were cited in communiques with Kuwait, San Marino  Iran  and Rwanda.

 24 FEBRUARY 1972
 In addition to the Canadian formula now repeated again in the
 case of Argentina, Peking has accepted two other formulas for
 acknowledging its claim to be the sole legal government of
 China. In Peking's preferred formula, the other side rerogr,izes
 thn PRC as "the sole legal government of the entire Chinese
 people," thus implicitly recognizing Peking's claim to Taiwan.
 The most accommodating tormula used prior to the Mexican agree-
 ment provides recognition of the PRC Government as "the sole
 legal government of China" without any reference to the Taiwan
 question.
 Peking's approach in the Mexican case suggests a more confident
 attitude now that the PRC has been seated in .he United Nations
 and Sino-U.S. and other developments have greatly enhanced its
 international standing.  Thus, provided the other country will
 take the initiative shown by Mexico--acknowledging on its own
 that China is "Juridically indivisible" and breaking off diplo-
 matic relations with the ROC-Peking may be even more flexible
 in the recognition negotiations than it showed in the series of
 agreements dating back to the compromise with Canada.*  Apart
 from tougher cases in which the Taiwan question has acquired
 special importance, as with the United States, Japan, and
 possibly Britain, Peking may wish to appear less defensive
 and more accommodating on this issue while broadening its diplo-
 matic standing across as wide a front as possible.
 *  Before this series of agreements, Peking had not always
 demanded a formal statement on its legitimacy as the sole
 government of China.  Thus, the Sino-French recognition agree-
 ment of 27 January 1964 contained only a declaration of intent
 to establish relations and ignored the question of representa-
 tio< of China.  A Chinese statement on the following day,
 however, defensively and vigorously reiterated Peking's claim
 to Taiwan.

 NUCLEAR-FREE ZONES      The Chinese followed past practice by
 extending support to the recognizing
 government on an issue important to that government, in the
 Mexican case going on record in the communique in support of
 the Mexican-backed proposal for a nuclear-free zone in Latin
 America.  PEOPLE'S DAILY widened this endorsement by noting
 that the PRC gives "active support" to the "Just stand of
 all peace-loving countries for the establishment of nuclear-
 free zones or peace zones."
 Notwithstanding this expression of support, Peking has not
 formally signed the protocol on a nuclear-free zone in Latin
 America.   In the last Chinese pronouncement on this subject,
 the PRC's UN delegate Chen Chu addressed a First Committee
 session on 10 December discussing a protocol to be added to
 an earlier treaty on such a zone.  Annommcing that the PRC
 would not take part in the vote, Chen pointed out that the
 PRC has no soldiers stationed abroad, has no military bases
 on foreign soil, and has pledged not to be the first to use
 nuclear weapons.  Fe declared that this "p.lncipled" stand,
 which he contrasted with that of the two superpowers, is
 "the best support to the good wishes of many countries fo:
 the establishment of nuclear-free zones and peace zones."

 USSR -ARAB RELATIONS
 24 FEBRUARY 1972
 On the heels of Egyptian President as-Sadat's 2-4 February talks
 in Moscow, Soviet-Arab contacts have stepped up with the
 10-17 February "official friendly" visit to the USSR of an
 Iraqi party-government delegation led by Revolution Command
 Council Deputy Chairman and Ba'th Party Regional Command
 Deputy Secretary Saddam Husayn.  On the 23d, a Libyan
 Government delegation led by Economy and Industry Minister
 'Abd as-Salam Jallud arrived in Moscow on what Cairo media
 described as the first visit of an official high-level
 Libyan delegation to the USSR.  In the Middle East, Soviet
 Defense Minister Grechko was in Cairo for talks 18-21 February
 after visiting Somalia.  And a Soviet party-government
 delegation led by CPSU Central Committee Politburo member
 and First Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers
 Kirill Mazurov arrived in Damascus on the 21st for a six-day
 visit to Syria.
 IRAQI-SOVIET COMMUNIQUE SUGGESTS FUTURE TREATY RELATIONSHIP
 The communique on Saddam Husayn's visit is marked by a much
 more cordial tone than that on his previous Moscow talks, in
 August 1970.  Most significantly, it seems to foreshadow another
 Soviet-Arab treaty in recording the sides' agreement to study
 the question of "what supplementary measures can be taken in
 the near futuri to appropriately consolidate and embody in
 treaties" the two states' relations and "raise them to a new
 and higher level."  Saddam Husayn, in his 11 February luncheon
 speech as reported by Baghdad radio, spoke of the need for
 "developing relations between cur countries to the level of a
 firm strategic alliance."  The version in the 12 February PRAVDA
 reduced this to "strengthening the ties between our countries,"
 although it did record his further statement that "we look toward
 the day when qualitative progress is effected in the character of
 relations between us," as well as his remark that the "firm
 strategic alliance" between "our peoples, parties, and governments"
 is the foundation on which relations are and will be based.
 The communique notes that Saddam Husayn was received by Brezhnev
 and by Podgornyy and held talks with Kosygin.  Moscow had notably
 failed to report Brezhnev's meeting with Egypt's as-Sadat, but,
 in contrast, gave wide publicity to the Brezhnev-Saddam Husayn

 meeting:  Broadcast reports of the latter meeting, beamed
 world-wide, accounted for over half the total publicity on
 the Iraqi visit, and exceeded the attention given to as-Sadat's
 stay in Moscow.  The report on the 15 February meeting, held in
 a "frank and friendly atmosphere," noted that the sides
 "exchanged views"on the Middle East and condemned "Israeli
 aggression."  Questions of the further development of bilateral
 relations were discussed, the report added, as well as "examina-
 tion of the question of strengthening friendly ties" between
 the CPSU and the Iraqi Ba'th.  The communique expresses satisfac-
 tion with the state of "friendly links" between the parties and a
 "mutual desire" to develop them further.  The 1970 communique had
 mentioned only that "useful meetings" were held between party
 representatives.
 The current communique records the sides' desire to further
 develop political, economic, and "military" cooperation--the 1970
 document expressed Iraq's appreciation of Soviet assistance in
 strengthening Iraq's "defense power"--as well as cooperation
 in creation of an Iraqi national oil industry.  According to
 the communique, the Soviets support Iraq's oil policy, while
 the Iraqis express appreciation for Soviet aid in developing
 and exploiting oil resources.  The communique--like that in
 1970--notes Soviet acceptance of an invitation to Brezhnev,
 Podgornyy, and Kosygin to visit Iraq.
 While the Middle East crisis was dismissed in the 1970 communique
 with the observation that the sides "exchanged views" on the
 subject, the problem is currently addressed in routine language
 blaming the tense situation on "Israeli imperialist aggression"
 supported by assistance from U.S. "imperialist circles and
 international Zionism."  The sides state that a just and
 durable peace cannot be established without "liberation of all"
 occupied Arab territories and.securing the "legitimate rights"
 of the Palestinian people.  The communique includes stress on
 the need for '..,ity of action of the Arab states.  Howe'er,
 Baghdad radio in reporting Kosygin's 11 February luncheon
 speech omitted or altered all his specific references to other
 Arab countries, and in the communique substituted "Iraq" for
 "the Arab countries" in a reference to "the Arab countries'
 anti-imperialist course" in foreign policy and successes in
 "progressive social-economic changes."

 24 FEBRUARY 1972
 Along the lines of the Soviet-Egyptian communique on as-Sadat's
 Moscow visit last October, the Iraqi and Soviet sides "resolutely
 condemned" attempts by international imperialism to spread
 "anticommunist and anti-Soviet feelings" aimed at breaking up
 Arab solidarity and Arab cooperation with the socialist countries.
 PRAVDA carefully edited out Saddam Husayn's accusations against
 Iran in his luncheon speech, merely noting that he "touched on
 the question of Iraq-Iran relations, setting out his government's
 position."  The communique strikes a compromise in condemning
 "imperialist" intrigues in the gulf and calling, as did the 1970
 communique, for liquidation of "imperialist domination" in the
 area and abolition of foreign military bases.
 INTERNAL    Propa`?rnda surrounding the visit -seems to suggest
 AFFAIRS     the Soviets are hopeful that the Iraqi. regime intends
 to im?ilement its "Nationrl Action Charter" of last
 November and open the door to political activity in Iraq by
 other "progressive, anti-imperialist forces"--specifically,
 the Iraqi Communist Party and the Kurds.  Thus Brezhnev, in his
 15 February meeting with Saddam Husayn, was reported by Moscow's
 domestic service to have welcomed the Ba'th Party leadership's
 desire to "unitq all anti-imperialist and progressive forces"
 in  he country to strengthen the country's national independence.
 And Kosygin in his 11 February luncheon speech pointed to
 "important changes" in Iraq, citing efforts by the Ba'th and
 "other progressive parties and oi.ganizations" to set up a
 national front of all progressive forces in the country,
 which he said would undoubtedly facilitate Iraqi advancement
 "along the path of progressive socio-economic reforms."  And
 he expressed confidence that this would be furthered by steps
 by the Ba'th Party and the government such as nationwide
 discussion of the N tional Action Charter and "further
 implementation" of the 11 March 1970 statement on a "peaceful
 democratic settlement" of the Kurdish problem.
 Koryavin, in the 10 February IZVESTIYA, assessed the charter
 as ranking "among the most important political events" occurring
 in Iraq.  He pointed out that there had been no "nationwide
 action program of any sort" in Iraq in the last few years, and
 no cooperation between the country's main progressive forces--
 the Ba'th, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and the Iraqi CP.
 Explaining the "transitional period" in Baghdad, Koryavin
 pointed to Iraqi CP support for the dratt charter and the
 charter's provision for Kurdish participation in state affairs,
 remarking that peace in Iraq has opened up broad prospects for
 the Kurds.

 A more dubious assessment of the state of affairs had appeared
 in a NEW TIMES article (No. 49, December 1971) by R. Petrov.
 While regarding the charter as a "major positive step," he
 noted a struggle within the Ba'th between progressive 'ices
 and elements "tied to moribund social relationships" c   to
 the foreign oil monopolies, and concluded that only the
 future wot:ld show to what extent the proclaimed progressive
 aims could actually be achieved.  In the course of analyzing
 the "two key political problems" facing Iraq--the Kurdish
 question and the problem of establishing a "national democratic
 front of progressive forces"--Petrov not only ticked off the
 former fr-:Zings of the Iraqi Ba'th, but noted that the Iraqi
 CP and the Kurdish Democratic Party had also engaged in self-
 criticism of past faults--"leftist' deviations" in past CPI
 activity and "extremist elements' activities" in the Kurdish
 movement.
 VISIT OF LIBYA'S JALLUD GIVEN MINIMAL PUBLICITY BY MOSCOW
 Thus far Moscow has only briefly acknowledged the arrival of a
 Libyan Government delegation headed by Economy and Industry
 Minister Jallud on the 23d "at the invitation of the Soviet
 Government."  TASS the same day carried a two-sentence announcement
 that Novikov, vice chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, had
 received the deleg.--tion.  On the 24th TASS reported that Novikov
 and the Libyans began talks that day "in a friendly atmosphere"
 and "exchanged views" on questions of mutual interest.  The only
 monitored Libyan report has been a 21 February LIBYAN NEWS AGENCY
 item that Jallud had left for Cairo en route to Moscow at the
 head of ~-n official delegation for talks with Soviet officials.
 But Libya takes the occasion Lo warn Iraq of the dangers of
 concluding a treaty with the Soviet Union.  Bayda radio on the
 23d cited an "authoritative source" at the foreign ministry as
 saying "it is almost confirmed" that Iraq is about to conclude
 a treaty with the USSR, and expressing Libya's "extreme concern"
 over this trend "which the fraternal Arab countries have begun
 to follow."  Declaring that this  trend takes the Arabs back to
 the days of the Baghdad Pact and "Western imperialist countries'
 treaties," the statement adds that Libya views this attitude as
 a "serious violation" of the Arab League Charter.

 Moscow's limited propaganda attention to Libya In the past
 two months has included commentaries in Arabic, one in late
 January and one in early February, hailing the termination of
 Libyan agreements with Britain and the United States.  The
 second commentary praised Libya's struggle to eradicate
 imperialist influence and to establish cooperation with
 "progressive states" sucii as Egypt and Syria.  It pointed
 noted that the latter countries' successes along the roar  of
 independent national development have "depended more and more
 on the support and help" of the Soviet Union and other
 socialist states.   In December, Moscow had indirectly responded
 to Libyan criticism of the Soviet role in the Indian-Pakistani
 conflict with a TASS pickup of an article in the Lebanese CP
 daily AN-NIDA' condemning "the anti-Soviet campaign in the
 Libyan press."
 GRECHKO, EGYPTIANS "EXCHANGE VIEWS" ON MILITARY COOPERATION
 In line with Moscow's propaganda treatment of recent Grechko
 visits to Iraq and Somalia, the Soviet defense minister's
 18-21 February "friendly official" visit to Cairo was given
 limited publicity.*  (Grechko's Somali visit, originally
 scheduled for December, was postponed due to his reported
 illness in Baghdad.. Iraq.was the first leg of that trip
 which, according to Moscow in early December, was also to
 have included Syria.) Soviet and Egyptian media briefly
 reported his activities, TASS noting on the 19th that
 Grechko, accompanied by the Soviet ambassador and "the
 chief military adviser," Col. Gen. V. Okunev, was received
 by President as-Sadat on the 19th.  Another TASS dispatch
 on the 19th reported that Grechko that day inspected troops
 of the Third Field Army.  And it added-that at a luncheon given
 by the army commander, Grechko affirmed that the USSR "will
 be giving all kinds of assistance" to the Egyptian people,
 and charged the United States and Israel with trying to "sow
 seeds of mistrust" between the Soviet and Egyptian peoples
 and between the armed forces of the two states.  A one-sentence
 TASS item on the 20th said that Grechko and War Minister Sadiq
 "continued talks" that day..

 gratitude for the Soviet Union's "great support and assistance"
 In strengthening the armed forces and the country's "defense

 ability."
 (Similarly,a "Joint statement" on Grechko's official friendly
 visit to Iraq last December, according to TASS, said the sides
 "exchanged views" on strengthening and further developing military
 cooperation, and the Iraqi side expressed appreciation for the
 "big help and assistance in strengthening the defense capacity"
 of Iraq.  The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY's version additionally said the
 two sides "reached agreement on further developing military
 cooperation.")
 A Moscow commentary broadcast in Arabic on the 18th, heralding
 the Grechko visit, asserted that Article 8 of the Soviet-Egyptian
 treaty, on military cooperation, "has gravely perturbed" Tel Aviv
 and Washington.  It added that this military cooperation "serves
 the cause of establishing peace and security" in the Arab East
 as well as the consolidation of Egypt's ability to repel the
 "Israeli invaders."  The commentary went on routinely to recall
 that in the communique on as-Sadat's recent Moscow visit the
 sides confirmed their determination to seek a "Just settlement"
 in the Middle East on the basis of Security Council Resolution 242.
 An Arabic-language commentary on the 22d, noting the "exchange of
 views" on military cooperation during Grechko's visit, assailed
 "dirty attempts" by the Arabs' enemies to distort the nature of
 this cooperation and isolate the Arab peoples from the support

 MOSCOW SEES PEACE THREAT IN GREEK HOME-PORT, C')7JRUS ISSUES
 Moscow comment echoes the 15 February Soviet Government statement
 on the U.S.-Greek home-port arrangements, charging that the U.S.
 naval presence constitutes a threat to peace in the Mediterranean.
 And propagandists claim that Greece, at American behest, is
 pressuring Cyprus in fulfillment of a NATO plan to turn the
 island into "a major NATO base."  Focusing on the bruader as''ct
 of the U.S. naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean, Moscow
 repeatedly points out that the Greek "bases" are located in direct
 proximity to the borders of the Soviet Union and other socialist
 countries.  A KRASNAYA ZVEZDA review on the 20th by i'onomarev
 and Malyshkin summed up the propaganda charges in declaring that
 the Pentagon leaders intend to switch a proportion of U.S. ships
 to Greece from bases in Spain and Italy to control the entire
 eastern Mediterranean, "threaten the southern borders" of the
 Soviet Union and other socialist countries, support Israel's
 "aggressive aspirations," and pressure the Arab states.
 Moscow also rebuts the "old grating arguments" of "an allegedly
 'growing Soviet threat' in the Mediterranean," a PRAVDA article
 by Ivanov on the 18th calling this Greek "ballyhoo" which was
 used in the past to Justify implementation of the Truman Doctrine
 and the Marshall Plan.  A Volskiy article in IZVESTIYA on the
 17th/, protested that Soviet intentions in the Mediterranean are
 only peaceful.  In `r.. is connection Volskiy recalled Brezhnev's
 statement, in his 30 March CPSU Congress report, that after a
 political settlement in the Middle East it would be possible to
 consider further steps aimed at a military detente in the
 region, particularly at turning the Mediterranean into a sea of
 peace.  Volskiy insisted that normalization of the situation
 in the Mediterranean is "linked primarily" with a Middle East
 settlement.  Citing Soviet foreign policy actions representing
 "Lhe USSR's 'peace offensive' in the Mediterranean," he listed
 Brezhnev's visits to France and Yugoslavia, Kosygin's Algerian
 and Moroccan visits, and Egyptian President as-Sadat's recent
 talks in Moscow.
 Volskiy recalled that Brezhnev in his 11 June election speech
 last year had stated that the USSR die' not consider it an ideal
 situation when navies of the great powers cruise for long periods
 miles away from their own shor.:s, and "we are prepared to solve

 this problem, but . .  . on an equal basis."                 Since early fall.,
 Moscow media have largely ignored the issue of naval talks.
 Among other items, the KOMMUNIST editorial for January, reviewing
 the Soviet peace program, noted without comment that the USSR
 "has advanced a proposal on solving on an equal basis the
 problem of naval forces operating far from their native -l;.,res."
 A Dobrov commentary in Italian on the 23ri, deploring the silence
 in official circles in Rome over developments in the Mediterranean,
 is notable for the observation that "in Spain there is talk about
 a plan for a Mediterranean security system based on agreements
 between the countries concerned."  Moscow has rarely, if ever,
 addressed itself publicly to Spanish initiatives, promoted from time
 to time, on Mediterranean security.
 TREATMENT            Highlighting Soviet propaganda attention to
 OF CYPRUS            Cyprus in the wake of the 11 February Greek
 Government "ultimatum" to Nicosia, a PRAVDA
 article by Yuriy Yasnev on the 17th entitled "Hands Off Cyprus!"
 asserted that the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries
 "cannot remain indifferent" tJ developments around Cyprus.  PRAVDA
 routinely added that the Soviet Union supports Cyprus'
 independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, the
 dismantling of "war bases" on the island, and a peaceful solution
 to the Cyprus question without any outside interference.
 Propagandists note support in Cyprus for the government's
 policy and cite President Makarios as declaring at a rally that
 various plans for imposing a solution on the Cypriot people against
 their will cannot succeed.  Moscow has publicized statements by
 some Soviet public organizations in support of Cyprus, as well as
 statements by Cypriot, Greek, and Lebanese communist parties on the
 situation.  But it apparently has not replayed a Turkish Cr appal,
 broadcast on the 18th by the Turkish-language clandestine "Our
 Radio," which charged both the Greek and Turkish "juntas" with
 delivering ultimatums to Cyprus and preparing to invade the island
 and noted that the Makarios government has the support of the
 socialist countries.
 CYPRUS       The propaganda furor over tl'z Greek "ultimatum" and
 TALKS        the ensuing Greek-NATO "threat" to Cyprus' independence
 has contained re'atively few references to the fate of
 the intercommunal talks.  A Mirkov article in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA on
 the 15th alleged that "NATO agents" broke up the talks to create a
 pretext for foreign interferen~?e.  Taking up the standard theme that
 a plot against Cyprus was concocted at the NATO Council session in

 Lisbon on 3-4 June 1971, Markov claimed that the wrecking of the
 intercommunal talks was part of Lice plan formulated in Lisbon.
 And a Chirkov commentary in SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA on the 16th accused
 NATO agents of spreading the "provocative story" that the Greek
 and Turkish Cypriots cannot live together in the same state.  He
 went on to charge that NATO, taking advantage of "the disagreements
 that have arisen in the process of official negotiations" between
 representatives of the "Greek and Turkish communities," was trying
 to tie the island to NATO.
 The fullest discussion c;f the status of the talks appeared in an
 unattributed article in NEW TIMES (No. 7, 11 February 1972) which
 claimed again that frustration of the dialog between the communities
 was part of the Lisbon plan, and that the interruption of the
 negotiations last September was "primarily the handiwork of NATO
 agents."  Soviet propaganda on Cyprus in the past several months
 focused on the usual allegations of NATO plots with only a few
 passing references to the discussions on widening the intercommunal
 talks to include UN, Greek, and Turkish representatives.  Now
 NEW TIMES has explained that President Makarios, countering "this
 NATO maneuver," asked the United Nations to appoint a representative
 of the UN secretary general as an observer at the negotiations.
 Greece and Turkey in turn, the article went on, proposed increasing
 the number of participants by adding their own representatives
 acting as legal advisers on constitutional matters.  NEW TIMES
 noted that in October the UN secretary general sent Cyprus,
 Greece, and Turkey a memorandum proposing, an increase in the number
 of participants in the negotiations, which was accepted by the
 Cyprus Government.  And in late January UN official Guyer held
 discussions in ''costa with the government "and community leaders"
 about negotiations with the participation of the United Nations
 and representatives of Athens and Ankara.  NEW TIMES added that
 "even this decision, which is to some extent a compromise," was
 not to NATO's liking, and charged "NATO agents" in Cyprus with
 stepping up subversive actions to frustrate the new phase of
 negotiations.

 ECUADOR
 CUBA ADOPTS WAIT-!X,-SEE STANCE TOWARD NEW MILITARY REGIME
 Attentive but noncommittal Cuban reportage of events surrounding
 the successful 15 February military coup in Ecuador reflects an
 inclination to defer a judgment of the new regime until its
 policies and intentions become clearer,  The coup thus shelves,
 at least for the time being, the warming trend in Cuban-Ecuadorean
 relations--highlighted by Castro's 4 December talks in Guayaquil
 with now-ousted President Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra on the return
 leg of his extended visit to Chile.  But Havana's ample publicity
 for the new leaders' promises of reform and its citation of a
 Chilean comment on their apparently "progressive" leanings
 suggest an initial judgment that the new military regime is
 likely to carry forward the trend Castro had viewed w:.th favor
 in Velasco Ibarra's.
 NEWS COVERAGE      The Cuban Communist Party organ GRANMA has
 carried daily without comment "the latest
 news reports on EcuadoL," including pronouncements of the new
 military leaders, recognition of the new government by various
 countries, and appointments of high-ranking government officials,
 with many of the reports credited to news agency dispatches.
 Havana radio and PRENSA LATINA reportage of developments touched
 off by the "quick, bloodless coup" F--trayed the new military
 government headed by Brig. Gen. Guillermo Rodriguez Lara as
 an independent, nationalist-oriented regime.  PRENSA LATINA
 reported Velasco ibarra's arrival in Panama and quoted him as
 saying he  as not sad about the military coup but was "through
 with politics."  Quoting Santiago's PURO CHILE on 17 February,
 PRENSA LATINA said that "something about this coup makes us feel
 that this has not been 'Just another coup"' and that, considered
 as a whole, the first decisions taken by the military government
 in Ecuador " how a progressive mentality."
 PRENSA LATINA dispatches on the 19th and 20th reported announce-
 ments by the new government that it "will carry out wide reforms
 in the country's education system," that its road construction
 policy "will not be guided by private interests but will be
 based on technical criteria," and that it will "carry out a
 complete revision of its oil agreements."  PRENSA LATINA also
 reported that the co'xpists had cancelled the elections scheduled
 for 4 June and had ar-ounced "a plan of structural changes which
 will benefit the maj _ity."

 24 FEBRUARY 1972
 In contrast to its coverage of the Bolivian coup last August,
 Cuban media conveyed no suggestion that outside elements had
 been involved either in the planning or the execution of the
 coup.  PRENSA LATINA duly carried Rodriguez' denial that the
 military leaders "had used other revolutions as an example
 and model" and his claim that the revolution "is strictly
 Ecuadorean in spirit--an Ecuadorean intention, an Ecuadorean
 yearning."  It quoted his comment that "our movement" is neither
 fascist nor socialist and that "we speak of a nationalist
 revolution . . . because someone had to change the structures
 that were outdated for the life of a modern state,"
 BACKGROUND      Recent Cuban comment on Ecuador has stressed
 the Velasco Ibarra government's stand in the
 "tuna war" with the United States and its resistance to various
 acts of U.S. "economic aggression" against Latin American nations.
 In early December Castro indicated a favorable view of the
 Ecuadorean Government, associating it for the first time with
 the governments of Peru and Chile, particularly in view of its
 voting record in the United Nations on the China representation
 question.  In his 3 December farewell press conference in
 Santiago, Chile, Castro defended the Ecuadorean Government
 against a reporter's allegation that it was "fascist":
 Although the Ecuadorean Government was "not a revolutionary
 government," Castro declared, it had nevertheless demonstrated
 its "absolute independence" of the United States by voting
 with Cuba, Chile, and Peru for the expulsion of Taiwan from
 the United Nations.  Reiterating the line that Cuba's reestab-
 lishment of diplomatic relations with other Latin American
 nations hinges on their demonstration of independence from the
 United States, Castro asserted that "there are no contradictions"
 in his visit to Ecuador and that "there would be no contradiction
 if the Ecuadorean Government were to wish to establish diplo-
 matic relations with Cuba,"
 In a 4 December interview in Guayaquil, replying to a question
 on his talks with the Ecuadorean president, Castro described
 Velasco Ibarra as "a vigorous, likable person" who had made
 "some thought-provoking statements in regard to Cuba."  Stating
 that his brief visit to Guayaquil was "merely to greet" the
 Ecuadorean president and to "make his acquaintance and excharge
 views," the Cuban prime minister expressed Cuba's appreciatii,n
 for the "gestures" represented by Ecuador's votes on the UN
 China representation question.

 CHINA  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 SECOND LIAONING PARTY PLENUM DENOUNCES "SWINDLERS"
 On 20 February Shenyang radio reported that the second "enlarged"
 plenary session of the Liaoning provincial party committee
 was held from 1 to 13 February.  Nearly 300 persons attended
 the session, including an unspecified number of the full and
 alternate member9 of the provincial party committee and
 "responsible comrades" of party committees at the municipal,
 regional and county level.  The session was presided over by
 Politburo member Chen Hsi-lien, Liaoning's first secretary,
 and Tseng Shao-shan, second secretary.  Although no other
 members of the provincial party committee were mentioned in
 the report, all but one have made relatively recent public
 appearances; Deputy Secretary Mao Yuan-'sin, nephew of Mao
 and a former Red Guard leader, has not appeared publicly since
 April 1971.
 Although the need to strengthen party unity to overcome the
 harm done by "swin"'lers"--a term that has become identified
 with Lin and his followers--has been a common theme in all
 other recently reported provincial party plenums, the reportage
 on the Liaoning plenum is more explicit in indicating that the
 Lin Piao affair has hindered the rebuilding of party units
 within the province.  The radio report, for example, linked
 the failure to complete the total rebuilding of the provincial
 party apparatus with the negative influence of "swindlers who
 had illicit relations with foreign countries and attempted
 to change the line and policies of the party."
 Indicating that gaps still exist within the provincial party
 apparatus, more than one year after the formation ofitthe
 provincial party committee, the report was able to claim only
 that "party committees at various levels have mainly been
 established."  Calling for speeding up the work of "party
 building, criticism of revisionism, and rectification of work
 styles," the session stressed the need to strengthen party
 building as well as the party's centralized leadership, and
 concluded that "all party members, in particular the members
 of party committees at various levels, should strengthen
 their party concept and place themselves under the party's
 absolute leadership."  Party members were told to "improve the
 party committee system" and to "conscientiously implement
 democratic centralism and strengthen the party's collective

 leadership."  New party members are to be accepted "actively
 and prudently," and it was reiterated that party committees
 should strengthen their leadership over revolutionary committees
 and mass organizations and "grasp firmly and well the work of
 improving and building the Young Communist League, particularly
 the strengthening of YCL work in schools."
 A 20 February LIAONING DAILY editorial greeting the conclusion
 of the plenary session revealed that in the past year "the
 work in some areas was not done well" and stressed that "it is
 necessary to further expose and criticize the criminal activities
 of Liu Shao-chi and other swindlers."  Asserting that this
 task is a "question concerning not only a certain single
 individual," the editorial stated that it is "imperative" to
 make "full use of these people as teachers by negative examples
 and mobilize the masses in depth to criticize them and wipe
 out their pernicious influence."  The editorial argued that
 "this is a task of prime importance at the present time and
 it should be grasped firmly, meticulously, and successfully."
 The concern for increasing party control over all social
 organs expressed in the reports on the Liaoning plenum--an
 intensified theme in PRC propaganda since the purge of
 Lin Piao and several other top military leaders last fall--
 was echoed in an unusually frank HOPEI DAILY editorial
 broadcast by the Hopei radio on 21 February.  Declaring that
 the quest.io.i of "whetcier to consolidate and strengthen the
 party leadership or weaken and destroy it" is an "important
 criterion for distinguishing between genuine and sham Marxism,"
 the editorial condemned those "swindlers" who "opposed the
 leadership of the party w-thout restraint" and "deliberately
 destroyed the organizational principles of the party."  Without
 centralized party leadership, it was asserted, "there will
 inevitably appear a state of either dual leadership or plural
 leadership--a state of anarchy."

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 CRACKDOWN ON CULTURAL FIGURES IN UKRAINE CONTINUES
 The Ukrainian cultural crackdown begun in early January has
 continued to gain momentum.  At a 1/ January meeting of the
 Kiev writers organization chairman Yuriy Zbanatskiy denounced
 "poisonous weeds" like Anatoliy Kuznetsov, Aleksandr
 Solzhenitsyn and Vyacheslav Chornovil for providing "spiritual
 food for Munich radio stations" (LITERATURNA UKRAINA,
 8 February).  He declared that such facts must not be
 overlooked and that youth and "our inexperienced comrades"
 must be more actively protected from harmful influences.  He
 complained that the writers union had been too lax in
 admitting young writers and evaluating their work.  Among
 those criticized by Zbanatskiy was former writers union
 secretary Vitaliy Korotych, whose latest work was alleged
 to contain "non-class" poems.
 The 21 January CPSU Central Committee decree prompted editorials
 in the two leading party papers (RADYANSKA UKRAINA, 29 January,
 and PRAVDA UKRAINY, 1 February) criticizing a variety of authors,
 literary journals, publishing houses, film studios and
 institutes.  Similar editorials appeared in the Komsomol
 papers (MOLOD UKRAINY, 8 February, and KOMSOMOLSKOYE ZNAMYA,
 11 February) criticizing ideological defects in the literary
 work of the Komsomol press.  The writers union paper
 LITERATURNA UKRAINA ran two editorials on the decree
 (28 January and 8 February); in the second editorial the
 editors conceded that they had committed errors similar to
 those condemned by the decree.  On 10 February the writers
 union presidium met to discuss the decree (LITERATURNA
 UKRAINA, 15 February), and on 11 February the Ukrainian
 Central Committee convened a conference of leaders of
 creative unions, literary institutes, newspapers, journals
 and publishing houses to hear a still unpublished speech
 by Ukrainian culture secretary F. D. Ovcharenko (RADYANSKA
 UKRAINA, 12 February).
 Interestingly, among those participating in the discussion
 at the 10 February presidium meeting was the notable
 dissenter B. D. Antonenko-Davidovich, who along with the
 recently arrested dissidents Ivan Dzyuba and Vyacheslav
 Chornovil, refused to testify at the November 1970 Moroz
 trial and co-authored an open protest against the court's

 lawlessness.  He was singled out for attack in the 8 February
 MOLOD UKRAINY editorial on literary criticism which censured
 Dnepropetrovsk's youth paper for printing an enthusiastic
 review of his recent book "even though the literary critics
 and public had greeted the book's appearance negatively."
