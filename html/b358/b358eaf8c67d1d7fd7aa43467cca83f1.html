 PRODUCTION OF PRECISION SCALES IN CHINA
 One-ten millionth of one Gram Super Precision Scales
 Recently China has been achieving considerable success in producing
 precision scales, which are thus far manufactured in only a few countries
 of the world.  The most noteworthy one among them is the vacuum-quartz
 small-quantity heat scales, whose production, in small numbers, was begun
 this year at the Shenyang City Glass Laboratory.  It is a super-precision
 balance which has a minimum sensitivity of one-ten millionth of one gram.
 Test production of these scales was achieved by the Metal Laboratory of
 the Chinese Academy of Science, and the Shenyang City Glass Laboratory
 began their manufacture.
 In a scientific laboratory test, the variation of mass must be observed
 often under the condition of vacuum and/or of high heat.   Such variation
 is extremely small and is difficult to measure without the help of a highly
 elaborate balance.  The precision small-quantity scales hitherto produced
 by China had had a minimum sensitivity of one-millionth of one gram.
 Although this balance was so elaborate as to weigh even a piece of cotton
 fiber or an ink spot on a piece of paper, it was unable to meet neces-
 sities adequately.
 The smallest weight used for the newly-produced quartz small-quantity
 heat balance, which has a minimum sensitivity of one-ten millionth of one
 gram, weighs 0.01 mg  and is finer than human down; and during the opera-
 tion it could be blown away unless the operator stops his breath.  This
 balance is composed of three parts, namely, vacuum, heat, and balance.
 The parts of the balance are set in the vacuum system, are resistent to
 high. temperature and corrosion, and are made of quartz glass which has a
 very small factor of expansion.  The balance can measure metal or high
 temperature test material which is heated to 1,000 degrees centigrade,
 and the sensitivity and accuracy of the balance are not at all affected
 even by carbondioxide or steam.
 One-millionth of one Gram Precision Scales
 Produced by the Peking Optical Instrument Manufactory
 Although the above points out an epochmaking achievement in the
 recent meter industry in China, the precision small-quantity scales with
 minimum sensitivity of one-millionth of one gram are produced at the
 Peking Optical Instrument Manufactory and the Shanghai Scales Manufactory.
 According to the Jenmin Chipao of January 24, 1966, the Peking Optical
 Instrument Manufactory succeeded prior to this spring (January of the lunar
 calendar) [sic] in the test production of high-precision balance which has
 a maximum weighing capacity of 20 grams.  According to the report, the
 production of this high-precision balance was said to have been possible
 only after the ideological struggle of whether or not to tackle the heavy
 burden of revolution and achieve a high technological standard.  Half a

 year prior to this, the National Meter Bureau requested this factory to
 present a test product of a super high-precision scales.  Then there were
 a variety of opinions:   some supported the request; some were skeptical
 about its success; others argued that such a high-precision balance was
 produced only in a few countries of the world and that their factory was
 not equipped with the necessary means to produce such scales; and still
 others maintained that the precision scales hitherto produced in China
 reached barely the third-class standard, and a high technological standard
 should be achieved step by step; hence second- and the first-class test
 products should precede the super-class test product.  However, it is said
 that meanwhile a movement to study the thought of Mao Tse-tung was launched
 and the spirit to overcome difficulties to produce this super-class pre-
 cision balance was generated.   Thus the key engineers began to review the
 up-to-date experiences of the test production of precision small-quantity
 scales; and by making the best use of the valuable results of experiences,
 they finally succeeded in designing a blueprint for the high-precision
 balance.  The craftsmen are reported to have succeeded after a series of
 trials in the test production of all the 400-odd parts needed to make a
 high-precision balance in approximately half a year.
 One-millionth of one Gram Scales Produced by the
 Shanghai Scales Manufactory
 According to a telegram dispatched by the New China [News] Agency
 from Shanghai on October 17, 1965, the Shanghai Scales Manufactory also
 succeeded in producing a precision small-quantity balance which has a
 minimum sensitivity of one-millionth of one gram and a maximum weighing
 capacity of 2 grams.
 The weight used for this precision small-quantity scales is smaller
 than a grain of white confectioners' sugar crystal and can be blown away
 even by a single careless breath.  The balance has a very keen sensitivity,
 and when it is approached by a hand, it is able to sense even so slight
 a variation of weight as is caused by the body temperature of man.   Con-
 sequently, the balance is kept in a controlled-temperature room with a
 separator attached outside.  Both the materials to be weighed and the
 weights to be used are carried in through two "windows" by the revolving
 pan of the scales.  The windows are always closed and the switch is bon-
 trolled completely from the outside.  This precision balance is used by
 a national meter certification authority for the measurement of standard
 weight; apart from this, it is necessary for the laboratories and test
 rooms of scientific research organizations, universities, and professional
 schools when they measure the mass of a matter.
 The Shanghai Scales Manufactory which produced this balance also
 manufactured in 1960 a small-quantity balance which was capable of weighing
 one-two hundred thousandth of one gram.  Subsequently, in early 1963, it
 received a mission for test production of one-millionth of one gram pre-
 cision small-quantity balance and succeeded in its test production in late
 1964.  According to the above-mentioned source, in foreign countries, copper

 and aluminium are used for the beam of a precision balance, but the engin-
 eers of the factory have made the beam using a more ideal material.  This
 material is said to be relatively light and to have a high degree of mech-
 anical proof, and the effect of heat upon this material to be relatively
 small.  The manufacture has a margin of error of about one graduation (one-
 millionth of one gram), and this index is a considerably advanced one even
 by international standards.
 In the course of the test production, both the engineers and the workers
 made great efforts to overcome the difficulties associated with revisional
 test.  The test, of course, must be conducted in a controlled-temperature
 room, whose temperature must be fairly high.  Since there was no temperature-
 control facility in the factory, they built a simple such facility through
 their own efforts.  As a result of their experiments, they also discovered
 a comprehensive method of testing a precision small-quantity scales, and
 thus prepared the necessary condition for the formal production of this
 manufacture henceforth.
 Shanghai Linung Scales Manufactory and Shenyang
 Teko Scales Manufactory
 Among other factories which have been promoting the production of high
 precision scales are Shanghai Linung Scales Manufactory and Shenyang Teko
 Scales Manufactory.
 Early last year the Shanghai Linung Scales Manufactory manufactured
 three kinds of high precision standard scales with a large weighing capacity,
 each having a load capacity of 1 kg, 5 kg, and 20 kg.   These standard scales
 are the precision gauges necessary for the mining industry, scientific
 research organizations, and the laboratories of universities and profes-
 sional schools; their respective graduation units are 0.5 mg, 2.5 mg, and
 10 mg; and each of them has the precision of one-two millionth of its full
 scale.  For example, when a 1 kg material is weighed by the 1 kg scales,
 even the additional weight of 1.6 cm-long hair is immediately indicated on
 the scales.
 It is the Teko Scales Manufactory of the Shenyang City which succeeded
 in producing China's first second-class 5 kg balance and first-class 1 kg
 balance, having been enlightened by Shanghai Linung Scales Manufactory
 which is a sister factory of the former.  Although the Shenyang factory is
 one of the factories in China which started to produce scales relatively
 early, it could, until 1965, produce only fifth-class scales of compara-
 tively low accuracy.  Hence early last year, on the occasion of reviewing
 the performance of the factory, various questions were raised and answers
 were sought on its inability to produce high-precision scales above the
 fourth class.
 Traditionally, the scales produced by this factory were an imitation
 of foreign products; and because of their complicated structure, much
 material was wasted and not only was the cost of production high, but also
 the quality of the products was relatively inferior.  Within the last few
 years, the factory carried out a number of improvements, yet was unable
 to achieve a significant breakthrough.  Some people thought that it was no

 mistake to imitate foreigners because the latter had several decades of
 experience in scales production, whereas they themselves were still young,
 inexperienced, and lacked in expertise and suitable facilities.  Against
 such spiritual state, however, the factory branch of the Chinese Communist
 Party organized the employees of the factory so that they should learn the
 relevant writings of Chairman Mao; and thus by liberating their thoughts
 and elevating their recognition, it succeeded in producing, with a single
 leap a fourth-class 5 kg balance.  Then some leading members of its
 management who were satisfied at this result, took a strong pride in their
 achievement.
 Before long, however, a group of the "union of the three" -- the
 leading members of management headed by the vice chief of the factory,
 Chang Chung-Fu, technicians, and laborers -- visited Shanghai Linung
 Scales Manufactory, which had been a long-time competitor of the Shenyang
 Teko Scales Manufactory, for an observational study.  They were very sur-
 prised at learning that the Shanghai factory was producing third-class
 5 kg scales.  Upon returning to their factory, they rallied all their vigor
 in order to produce second and first-class scales by leaping over the bar-
 riers of producing third-class scales, and commenced the engineering and
 test-production activities for second-class 5 kg and first-class 1 kg
 scales, organizing a small team of the "union of the three" for the test
 production of new manufactures.  Owing to the herioc ambition of the
 employees to overtake and bypass the advanced plants'and to their clear
 understanding of the significance of catching up at a bound even the seem-
 ingly insolvable problems confronted in the course of engineering and test
 production were smoothly solved and the two kinds of high-precision scales,
 which until then China had never been able to produce, and which were
 urgently needed for scientific research organizations and the department
 of weights and measures, were produced in only three months.

 RAPIDLY PROGRESSING CHEMICAL FERTILIZER PRODUCTION
 Development of a Unique Chinese Way
 Through Technical Innovation
 Currently a great task of Chinese industry is to support agriculture,
 and the production of chemical fertilizer occupies an important place in
 this task.      This year, as also last year, promises rich harvest of wheat;
 and chemical fertilizer is an important factor in this regard.
 On the other hand, the export of fertilizer has always occupied the
 foremost place in Japan-China trade.   Inasmuch as export to China amounts
 to 40 percent of the total Japanese export, Japan seems to be considerably
 interested in China's chemical fertilizer industry.   Since chemical ferti-
 lizer was already dealt with in number 55 (November 1, 1965) of this Report,
 this issue will treat the major movements of this year.
 During January-May, the Production [of Chemical
 Fertilizer] Increased 500,000 Tons Over [the
 Figure Set in] the National Plan.
 This year, China's chemical fertilizer production progressed even fur-
 ther.   During January-May, the daily output level of chemical fertilizer
 rose conspicuously above that of last quarter, which had had the highest
 level of last year; and overall 500,000 tons of chemical fertilizer were
 produced above the level yet in the National Plan (a telegram dispatched
 by the New China tNews 9Agency on June 9, 1966).   The quality of nitro-
 genous manure has been stabilized and the quality of phosphatic manure has
 been further elevated.   The consumption of electric power, raw materials,
 and 4other  materials is generally lowered and the cost of production
 decreased.
 The nitrogenous manure produced in Shanghai during January-May this
 year shows a 40-odd percent increase compared with the same period of last
 year, and during January-February, Kuangchou,,, too, produced nitro-
 genous manure 60-odd percent more than in the same period last year.
 This year ally Q large-scale, medium-sized, and smalllVK chemical
 fertilizer plants scattered in various districts of China  ave achieved
 a production increase through the movement of "bringing politics to the
 fore" and of studying the works of Mao Tse-tung, and are making new change
 in enterprise.  Advanced plants are continuously maintaining a stable, high
 rate of production this year, and are making further progress; hitherto
 relatively retarded plants are rapidly advancing to catch up with the ad-
 vanced ones; and thus great strides are being made in the over all produc-
 tion level.   The new plants are rapidly reaching advanced engineering
 standards with a vigor to bypass all the others, and some of them are even
 ahead of older plants by breaking the traditional frame.   For several years,

 a variety of technical innovations introduced by the Chinese chemical fer-
 tilizer industry has been all the more widely and systematically adopted, and
 unique Chinese production techniques, facilities, and management methods are
 bearing fruits.
 Tanyang Chemical Fertilizer Plant Succeeded in
 Devising a New Chinese Way of Production Process
 At the end of January, it was reported that the new nitrogenous manure
 production process, which had been successfully developed by the Shanghai
 Academy of Cherical Engineering, Peking Chemical Engineering Laboratory, and
 the    =ate
 '~            Yaiyang Chemical Fertilizer Plant, after several years of.
 research under the direction of an eminent Chinese chemist Mr. 'H ou Te-pang,
 was recognized as technically advanced and economically reasonable after a
 comprehensive technical examination conducted by the Ministry of Chemical
 Industry in accordance with the request of the National Science Commission.
 Compared with traditional ones, this new process requires shorter pro-
 duction process, less materials and fewer facilities, less capital invest-
 ment for basic construction, shorter working period for plant construction,
 and less consumption of raw materials  for generating power.   Judging from
 the example of the Tanyang Chemical Fertilizer Plant, the construction of a
 small plant with the annual production capacity of 5,000 tons of synthetic
 ammonia takes ordinarily about a year and a half and costs only 7 million
 Yuan of investment capital, which is approximately half of the capital
 needed for the construction of an old-process plant
 The bicarbonate of ammonia produced through    is new process is a
 solid chemical fertilizer which contains only about 17.5 7 of nitrogen;
 it is soluble in water, almost neutral, and harmless to the soil.   Since
 it contains carbon dioxide, it is easily absorbed by the roots of agricul-
 tural crops and is advantageous to their growth.  According to several
 years' experiments conducted by agricultural science authorities and the
 results-of-its application to large agricultural areas, this fertilizer, if
 used properly, has proved to be as effective as nitrogenous manure.   The
 only problem is that since the bicarbonate of ammonia is easily soluble,
 relatively more precaution is required for its packing and use.
 Application of the Tan9ang-type
 New Process to Large Plants
 Although this new process has been spreading among small plants of
 various districts, it is now being adopted for the construction of large-
 scale and medium-size nitrogenous manure plants.   The view of the authori-
 ties is that although the adoption of China's new process in manufacturing
 bicarbonate of ammonia has already been making considerable progress, it
 would have to make further progress in order to meet the agricultural demand
 for nitrogenous manure.   Consequently, research on various problems connected
 with bicarbonate of ammonia is currently being promoted more systematically,
 so that its production is further economically and effectively stabilized

 As for the Tanyang Fertilizer Plant itself, the projected production
 capacity for synthetic ammonia was 2,000 tons in 1963 (the actual accom-
 plishment was 2,600 tons of synthetic ammonia, and 10,000 tons of bicar-
 bonate of ammonia); in July 1964 the projected annual production capacity
 was raised to 5,000 tons for synthetic ammonia and to 20,000 tons for
 bicarbonate of ammonia; likewise in the first quarter of 1965 it rose to
 6,500 tons and 26,000 tons respectively; and in the second quarter of the
 same year it made a further stride toward the level of 8,000 tons and
 32,000 tons respectively.
 China Tackles 70-odd new Technological
 Developments This Year.
 This year, new technological developments, for which throughout the
 nation chemical fertilizer plants are selectively promoting experiment and
 research by adopting the methods of the internal  union of the three     the    "`-
 leading management staff, engineers, and workers AN and the 4externali              tL+~
 union of the three - the plants, scientific research organizations, and
 universities and professional schools %*(amount to a total of 70 item).
 These include new techniques for the shortening of the production
 process, simplification of facilities, and optimum utilization of local
 raw materials.   Currently, those plants which have acquired these tech-
 niques are already reaping elementary fruits, and some are planning  to
 acquire these techniques.   It is deemed that the technical level of China's
 chemical fertilizer production will enter a new stage when these new tech-
 niques are accomplished.
 The Gas Generator is the Neck
 of the Nitrogenous Manure Plant.
 This year the popular movement for technological innovation and tech-
 nological revolution has added further depth and breadth.   Employees have
 made many revolutionary proposals on the neck of production and are effec-
 tuating production efficiency.   In the production of nitrogenous fertilizer,
 the gas generator and compressor are the major facilities for manufacturing
 synthetic ammonia.   Since last year, however, in nitrogenous manure plants
 everywhere, the production efficiency of the gas generator has not been
 able to keep pace with that of the compressor  owing to the latter's over-
 all elevations s.dthis has come to restrict the production increase of
 ammonia.   The solution of this problem is indeed the key to this year's
 production increase.   Therefore,in order to cope with this crucial issue,
 the chemical fertilizer plants of various districts are propagating tech-
 nological innovation through broad mobilization of masses.
 Previously, the gas manufacturing workshop of the Nanking Chemical
 Fertilizer Plant operated according to old standards* and the coal-bed
 inside the gas generator was so low as to be easily blown off.  As a result
 of earnest research, the technical staff of the factory conclude  that-the
 above facts were responsible for hampering production increased   ter much
 experimentation, they discovered a new method of operation, that is, "high
 coal-bed, high wind-pressure, and high generator temperature."  Since the

 adoption of this new method of operation for every gas generator in all work-
 shops, productivity has risen more than 30 percent.   The employees of chemi-
 cal fertilizer plants of all districts have been raising the productivity of
 the gas generator by increasing the time for gas production with a minimum
 break of the generator.   Currently, the goal of one compressor for one gas
 generator is realized in nearly every plants some plants have "9 compressors
 for 7 gas generators"W and thus the production capacity of synthetic ammonia
 is being raised in all aspects.
 Productivity is Raised Tremendously
 by Every Plant in Shanghai.
 The large Shanghai Wuehing Chemical Fertilizer Plant, which was built
 by China's own efforts, has been conducting continuous research to improve
 its facilities and manufacturing methods.  As a result, its present produc-
 tivity of ammonia is twice as high as originally projected production ca-
 pacity.   The present productivity of small chemical fertilizer plants scat-
 tered in the suburbs of Shanghai is     an annual production of 3,000 tons
 of ammonia as compared with the projected original capacity of annual pro-
 duction which was 800 tons of ammonia.   For several years these chemical
 fertilizer plants have encouraged technological innovation and revolution,
 and have dug out the potential of their facilities.   Since the second half
 of last year, the employees of these small chemical fertilizer plants have
 been breaking superstition more boldly than evert" they improved the synthetic
 towers which had been regarded as taboo and had been called the "tiger's
 tail."  The leadership of the authorities of Shanghai City has selected ex-
 -perienced laborers and technicians from various factories and improved the
 factories one by one, making a concentrated attack "on superstition f.   Pres-
 ently in such factories as Chia.ting, Putung, Nanhui, etc., the productivity
 of the improved ammonia synthetic towers is generally 20 %-30 % higher than
 the originally projected level.
 Reconstruction of the Old-type
 Ammonia Synthetic Tower.
 As for the reconstruction of the old-type ammonia synthetic tower, the
 Thermal Engineering Study and Research Team of the Department of Power Ma-
 .4,)c    e~ys o  Chinghua University, which collaborated with a chemical plant in
 ~~~CNw      ~     `u-s ie     succeeded in developing ping a new method.   This study team dis-
 covered that the low productivity of the ammonia synthetic tower of the fer-
 tilizer plant was responsible for the weakness of current chemical fertilizer
 production when it investigated the plant in 1963 in order to unite tstudyk
 with production.   Thereupon,, the team began to tackle the problem of recon-
 structing the ammonia synthetic tower- and  ft r a successful research, it it.
 went back to the chemical plant in in order to work out a technical
 reconstruction of the synthetic tower in cooperation with the plant.  At
 first, however, some staff of the plant held the view that it would be better
 to construct a new modern synthetic tower than to reconstruct painstakingly
 the old-style synthetic tower of 1940.

 Chemical Fertilizer
 Those professors and students of Chinghua University and the workers
 and technicians of the chemical plant who participated in this technical
 reconstruction work determined to open a unique way based on the reality
 and necessity of China.   There is a considerable number of this type of
 old synthetic towers in China.   If they can successfully reconstruct one
 old-type synthetic tower, the reconstruction of all old-type synthetic
 towers will be accelerated, and the amount of China's chemical fertilizer
 production will be raised.       this has a greater significance than con-
 structing new synthetic towers of complex structure.
 Reconstruction of Synthetic Tower Without
 the Help of Foreign Writings.
 In this technical reconstruction, they discovered through their elemen-
 tary research that the low productivity of.old-type synthetic tower was -due
 to an inadequate conductivity of heat.   They tried to increase thermal con-
 ductivity according to a method described ina foreign book; however, after
 a realistic research, they realized that  with such a method described in
 the foreign.bookk they could not truly solve the problem of thermal conduc-
 tivity  related to this kind of synthetic tower.   Thereupon, through a de-
 tailed analysis in accordance with the operating conditions of the old-type
 synthetic towers, they grasped the main contradiction of thermal conductivity
 and created a new method.
 According to this new method, they set out the first technical recon-
 struction of an old-type synthetic tower, but the productivity did not in-
 crease much though thermal conductivity was strengthened.   Some attributed
 this to excessively good thermal conductivity.  Afterwards, however, they
 discovered through a research on the basic data that the productivity had
 not increased in spite of the increase in thermal conductivity because re-
 lated problems had not been concurrently solved, and that the main contra-
 diction upon adopting a newly-built reaction tower had already been moved
 to the related problems.  Therefore) they concentrated their efforts on sol-
 ving the problems related to thermal conductivity.   Thus~+through the second
 technical reconstruction, the daily productivity of thin old-type reaction
 tower has come to bypass the advanced world standard.
 Furthermor3 in summing up the practical experience of the two previous
 technical reconstructions, they discovered a structural defect which had
 not been completely solved even with the second technical reconstruction.
 Therefore, more improvements were needed from structural point of view.   How-
 ever, no clues to the solution of this problem were found in current foreign
 writings.  Yet they were all the more determined to achieve something which
 had never been done by foreigners, and in the end with the help of the wisdom
 of many they succeeded in devising a new structure.   Thus at last in its pro-
 ductivity, the old-type synthetic tower of the 1940's has come to be ahead
 of the new-type synthetic tower of the 1960's and reached the advanced
 standard of the world.

 Old-type Synthetic Towers Throughout the
 Country Undergo Technicai-~s.econstruction
 Through the Chinghua University Method.
 This technical reconstruction was begun in May 1964 and completed in
 October 1965. As a result of the technical reconstruction, the productivity
 of old-type installation rose by more than 70 percent, and the quantity of
 ammonia production of the entire plants increased a great deal.   This tech-
 nical reconstruction, which is implemented together with a great repair work
 for the ammonia synthetic tower, requires no great deal of money, needs only
 a short period of production suspension, has a great effect upon production
 increase, and yet is easily diffused.   Currently many synthetic towers of
 the same type throughout the country are adopting the reconstruction methods
 of this chemical plant; promoting a partial technical reconstruction$ Zffd
 although there is a degree of differences  'among different towers, all of
 them are achieving-success in increasing production.   The joint conference
 of National Economic Commission, National Science Commission, the Ministry
 of Chemical Engineering, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Chinese
 Academy of Science which convened around last February, confirmed the sig-
 nificance of this reconstruction method particularly for economic construction.
 Some Technological Achievements of Small Plants
 Are M re Advanced Than Those of Large Plants.

 The aforementione  new process of the small nitrogenous manure plate
 with annual produoiv ~Wc~~ eo~f 2,000 tons, which was successfully in-
 troduced by                     anyang Chemical Fertilizer Plant, has been
 hardening its basis among small plants.  These newly-built small plants
 have advantages in experimenting in new techniques of production because
 they are small in scale and easily movable.  After succeeding in the ex-
 perimentation of the new process, within the last several years  these
 plants succeeded in the creation of many new techniques and facilities by
 adopting the method of the "union of the three" both within and outside the
 plants, raised the technological standard of China's synthetic ammonia in-
 dustry a step further, and made a significant improvement of the new process
 of chemical fertilizer production, which was devised for the first time by
 the Chinese.   Presently some of the new techniques, manufacturing methods,
 and facilities which are widely adopted by small-size nitrogenous manure
 plants are already advanced more than those which are employed by large-
 scale plants.   Since the scientific researchers of the engineering division
 of various districts have always been working closely with their employees
 in plants, any technical achievement obtained in the course of production
 has been immediately utilized for engineering.   Thus they have been able to
 revise the engineering project for a small-type nitrogenous manure plant
 constantly so as to make it economically more rational and technically more
 advanced.  At the present time, the small nitrogenous manure plant needs
 much less investment capital for its construction and its construction speed
 has become much faster than ever.   It takes only half a year to build a

 Small Plants Occupy Eighteen
 Percent of Nitrogenous Manure Production.
 During January-May this year, 20-odd newly  uilt small nitrogenous manure
 plants in China began production; furthermore, the construction of a group of
 small plants is being accelerated and they are expected to begin production
 one after another this year and  ext.  When all these new plants begin pro-
 duction, the productive capacityis expected to rise far above the annual
 productivity of small nitrogenous manure plants hitherto possessed by China.
 Since 1961, the productive capacity of small nitrogenous manure plants
 has been doubled almost every year, and the ratio of which the small plants
 occupies in the national total of nitrogenous manure production has increased
 every year  in 1961 the total amount of production by small nitrogenous ma-
 nure plants occupied only 2 % of the national total;r yet in 1965 it rose to
 12.4 %; and this year it is expected to reach 18 7 (a July 14, 1966 telegram
 from New China 'Tews  Agency).
 Improvement of the Quality of Phosphatic
 Manure and of the Utility of Phosphorite
 The main task of this year in the production of phosphatic manure is to
 continuously raise the quality of phosphate and the utility of phosphorite
 powder.  Although most of the phosphorite powders used at the phosphatic
 manure plants of various districts were of relatively bad quality and were *,.-low
 quality mineral powders, the quality of phosphate has been improved, and the
 ratio of the first-class phosphatic manure increased a great deal.   The con-
 vertibility in phosphate production roset/3 % everywhere as compared with last

 With this method it is possible to increase the effective content of phos-

 build a large warehouse for maturation.  With this method, the effective

 A new chemical fertilizer ammoniated superphosphatic lime has formally
 begun to be produced by Kuangchou Nitrogenous Manure Plant.   The facilities
 for this new fertilizer production were engineered, manufactured, and in-
 stalled by the employees of the plant.
 This year the Kuangtung-sheng Chinese Merchant Investment Company will
 construct ten chemical fertilizer plants in special districts, such as
 Shar:shan, Meithsien, Hui.yang, Chanchiang, Haknan, etc.   Each of these plants
 will have an annual output capacity of 3,000-5,000 tons.   Last year the
 company built the Mei-hsien Phosphatic Manure Plant, the Ta:6shan-hsien
 Huachiao (Chinese Merchant) Chemical Fertilizer Plant, the Huichou Phosphatic
 Manure Plant, and the Kai-ping Nitrogenous Manure Plant which has a projected
 annual production capacity of 25,000p an- all of them are in operation.
 A soluble phosphatic manure plant in Ma- rate  City having an annual pro-
 duction capacity of 60,000 tons began to operate in early March; its daily
 output has become as much as projected; effective content of phosphirus is
 18 % plus; and all are first-class products.                             b
 Although the annual production of the Hsingn.ing General Chemical En-
 gineering Plant was 400-odd tons of superphosphatic lime in 1960 when it was
 established, today its annual production amounts to 20,000 tons; most pro-
 ducts are of qualified standard; and the cost of production is at three-
 fourths of the beginning period.
 The first nitrogenous manure plant of the Special District of Shantou
 _..;the Hsing'huo Nitrogen Plant Aft began its operation formally on February
 10, 1966.   Its annual producti6n capacity is 3,000 tons of synthetic am-
 monia (liquid ammonia 12,000 tons).   The plant was built with support from
 many quarters and completed only in 8 months.
 Yunnan-sheng
 The five newly-built or expanded soluble phosphatic manure plants i
 Yunnan-sheng are beginning to operate one after another (New China fNew
 .Agency, March 28, 1966).  These are located in Hsuanwei, Chu'hsiung, Yuu?hi,
 Chinning, and An`ning; and when these plants formally commence their opera-
