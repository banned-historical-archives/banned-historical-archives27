6 October 1960 
DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
USSR: Red Army Major General Nikolai A. Talensky, a 
noted writer on Soviet military doctrine, has condemned the 
idea that war might be justified if it meant the end of capital-
ism. In the magazine "International Life," Talensky said that 
after another war, which "could not fail" to be a world war, 
"the earth's population would be cut in half, and it would be the C 
most active and mostculturedpart of mankind that would disap-
pear." He concluded that a mass surprise attack cannot bring 
victory for the attacker because the retaliation could still 
destroy all his vital centers. 
The article, which has been given added stature by a re-
view, by TASS, is a direct attack on the Chinese Communist 
attitude that the dangers of nuclear war have been overrated. 
Talensky is also in effect reiterating to the Chinese--who con-
tinue to clamor for Taiwan-=that the concept of limited war is 
invalid because it would risk full-_scale war. This is the most 
emphatic major article on military theory to appear in the 
Soviet press since the Sino-Soviet dispute sharpened at the 
Bucharest Conference and indicates an effort to show in prac-
tical military terms why the coexistence line must he follnwPd 
Sino-Soviet Dispute: At an Albanian-Chinese friendship 
rally in Peiping on 4 October, China and Albania unequivocally 
affirmed their solidarity in the Sib-Soviet dispute over world 
Communist strategy. The Chinese endorsed the Hoxha regime 
for its "completely correct," uncompromising struggle against 
imperialism and modern revisionism, and the Albanians, in 
turn, lauded Peiping's defense of the purity of Marxism-Lenin-
ism. In attacking Tito as a "traitor to the world proletariat," 
both underscored their displeasure at Khrushchev's gestures of

 hud 
friendship to Tito at the United Nations. Moscow must view 
Albania's continued defiance as a threat not only to its cam= 
paign to isolate Peiping but also to its authority over the 
Eastern European satellites. The Soviet leaders can be ex-
pected, therefore, to take measures to bring Albania into 
line as quickly as possible. (Page 1)

man delegation headed by a left-wing neutralist paves the way 
for early peace talks with the Communist Pathet Lao. ebou-
vanna meanwhile is becoming increasingly negative on the ques-

district office was attacked by a band of 60-100 guerrillas, the 
largest Communist force noted in the area since 1955. Commu-
nist infiltration into central South Vietnam from the Laos border 
may increase with further deterioration of the Laos situation, 
complicating further us internal problems faced by the 
Diem government. (Page 4)

European Confederation Common Market officials are 
high y suspicious of Britain's current efforts to promote some 
�/, 
kind of association agreement among the Common Market, the 
Outer Seven, and the Commonwealth by taking advantage of De 
Gaulle's proposals for a European confederation. They are C ,.-� 
convinced that the De Gaulle plan can eventually be "channeled" 
to serve at least in part the Common Market's objectives, but 
apparently regard the British pressures as a real threat. Ac-
cording to the deputy chief of the American Mission to the Com-
mon Market, his British colleague has led him to believe that 
London continues to "seek in every way to retard if not prevent 
any real economic or political integration on the Continent."

China and Albania Reaffirm Solidarity of Ideological Views  
Tirana and Peiping have seized the occasion of the Chinese 
Communist 11th anniversary celebrations in Peiping to exchange 
unequivocal affirmations of solidarity in the current Sino- Soviet 
dispute. The love feast climaxes a year punctuated by Albanian 
expressions of sympathy for Chinese policies despite Soviet dis-
pleasure and pressure. 
The leader of the Albanian delegation to the Chinese cele-
brations, Deputy Premier Abdyl ICellezi,said at a 4 October rally 
that the Chinese, under the "wise and flexible" leadership of 
Mao Tse-tung, have always followed correct political, ideologi-
cal, and economic policies. He added that China was defending 
the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and that the friendship between 
the two countries had been personally endorsed by Albanian party 
leader Enver Hoxha and Mao. Kellezi's statements were pre-
ceded by a warm endorsement of Chinese Communist policies 
by Hoxha in a 30 September speech in Tirana. 
Chiang Nan-hsiang, chairman of the China-Albania Friend-
ship Society, in turn labeled the line of the Albanian Workers' 
(Communist) party "completely correct," and asserted that 
"neither towering mountains nor deep oceans" could separate 
the Chinese and the Albanians. The Chinese even went out of 
their way on 2 October in Peiping to demonstrate their pleasure 
with the Albanians by sending a higher ranking delegation to the 
China-Albania.,;, Friendship banquet than they sent to the Soviet 
ambassador's reception. 
Chinese and Albanian statements describing Tito as a "run-
ning dog of imperialism" appear to have been for the purpose of 
showing displeasure over Khrushchev's gestures of friendship 
toward Tito at the UN General Assembly. 
The Chinese apparently are willing to provide more than 
mere propaganda support to Albania. Chinese business repre-
sentatives in Hong Kong are reliably reported to have been

seeking to purchase unspecified amounts of wheat for shipment 
to Albania in 5,000-ton lots beginning in October. Albania is 
believed currently to be short of wheat, and this commodity is 
not in the Albanian-Chinese exchange list this year. 
Moscow must view Albania's continued willingness to defy 
Moscow as a threat not only to its campaign to isolate Peiping 
but to its authority over the East European satellites. All 
efforts to bring the Albanians into line�including the use of 
official snubs and possibly some direct effort to bring about 
Internal political change--have evidently failed. Moscow can 
be expected to undertake further and more direct measures, in 
an effort to bring Albania in line before the November meeting 
in Moscow of world Communist leaders.

The Situation in Laos  
Radio Vientiane announced on 5 October that the Souvanna 
Phouma government had appointed a four-man delegation for 
the impending peace talks with the Communist Pathet Lao. 
Quinim Pholsena, Souvanna's extreme leftist minister of infor-
mation, will head the delegation, and armed forces command-
er General Ouane will be a member. The Pathet Lao had previ-
ously appointed a three-man delegation, all of whom are mem-
bers of the movement's Communist inner core. 
[Premier Souvanna told Ambassador Brown on 5 October 
that he was worried about the increased strength of the Pathet 
Lao and considered it imperative to start negotiations before 
the Pathet Lao became even stronger. Souvanna added that he 
planned to go to Luang Prabang on 6 October to plead with the 
King to order General Phoumi and Prince Boun Oum of the 
Savannalchet Revolutionary Committee to join in support of his 
government. 
Souvanna's emphasis on Phoumi's rallying to his government, 
rather than on negotiations for a compromise with Savannakhet, 
reflects his confidence that he has gained the upper hand in his 
struggle with Phoumi. He apparently now feels that his position 
is strong enough to avert the political negotiations the King has 
been promoting for the purpose of forming a new government 
of national unity under some other premier. He:  
ordered his associates in Luang Prabang to or-
ganize a popular demonstration in his favor timed to coincide 
with his visit to the royal capital. Such a move would be well 
calculated  to dissuade the King from asking for Rolm nna's res-
ignation:a

Communistsitrep Up Guerrilla Attacks in Central Region of  
South Vietnam  
Two incidents in late September point to growing Commu-
nist guerrilla action in the central mountain provinces of South 
Vietnam, the area hitherto least affected by the intensified 
Communist campaign of terrorism and subversion which be-
gan early this year. Civil Guard troops in one coastal prov-
ince inflicted several casualties and captured rifles and sub-
machine guns after encircling a Communist hide-out on 17 
September, On 20 September, a district office in Quang Nam 
Province, about 100 miles south of the truce line, was attacked 
and ransacked by a band of 60-100 guerrillas, the largest - 
Communist force noted in the area since 1955. 
In a discussion of the latter incident, South Vietnamese 
President Diem told American Embassy officials that a Com-
munist commander killed in the clash carried instructions 
from Hanoi to blow up certain bridges throughout the region. 
/Diem's brother and political adviser in the region, Ngo Dinh 
an, also recently stated that the September attacks indicated 
a departure in his area from past Communist tactics of propa-
ganda and sporadic terrorismd This region, traditionally called 
Central Vietnam, was formerly a Communist stronghold, but 
has been generally quiescent since the departure of Viet Minh 
troops after the 1954 truce divided the country into North and 
South Vietnam. It is vulnerable to further Communist infiltra-
tion across its common borders with North Vietnam as well 
as from Laos, should the situation there further deteriorate. 
(Vietnamese Army units are stationed near the border with 
North Vietnam, but have been employed against the Communist 
guerrillas principally in the delta provinces southwest of Saigon, 
where the subversive campaign has been most intense. The 
American army attach�as reported that on 28 September, 
following an attack by a large Communist band 20 miles west 
of Saigon, the army retaliated with its most effective example 
to date of a combined operation, using ground and air forces(

The Situation in the Congo  
Although the power struggle in Leopoldville between Mobu-
tu and Lumumba continues, UAR Ambassador Ghaleb has ex-
pressed apprehension for the prospects of deposed premier Lu-
mumba. On 3 October, Ghaleb urged that Cairo grant further 
financial aid to Lumumba in view of the "critical" situation in 
the Congo. On the same day, Lumumba was publicly criticized 
by members of the Congo legislature. 
the UAR "has reached the 
high point with regard to Lumumba's position through the sums 
which we have paid to him, andthedescent has in fact begun now." 
The ambassador added, "The sum of money which was given to 
Lumumba, despite its small size, was a decisive factor... in saving 
Ltirnumba," The last known UAR gift to Lumumba. in an un-
known amount, was made in mid-September. 
Ghaleb asked Lumum-
ba to estimate the amoint of money necessary to buy off Mobutu. 
In Kata,nga, where sporadic tribal violence continues, anti-
Belgian remarks by an official of the ruling Conakat party may 
presage a party split. Ndala Kambola, a rival of President 
Tshombd for leadership of the Conakat, on 4 October charged 
Belgium with "sabotaging" ICatanga's independence and threat-
ened the nationalization of Belgian companies there. Tshombd 
subsequently disavowed Kambola's threats and disputed his 
claim to speak for the party.

Common Market Officials Fear British Exploitation of 
ropean Confederation Plan  
The De Gaulle proposals for a confederation of the six 
European Common Market countries are evidently regarded 
by Common Market officials as a lesser threat to the future 
development of the European Economic Community than the 
possibility of British exploitation of it. According to the 
deputy chief of the American Mission to the Common Market, 
recent talks with Community officials have revealed a "dedi-
cated conviction" that the De Gaulle plan "will eventually be 
channeled" to serve at least in part the Common Market's 
objectives. This optimism is tempered, however, by reali-
zation of the extent to which London is using the opportunity 
provided by the De Gaulle plan to renew pressure for some 
kind of association agreement among the Common Market, 
the British-led Outer Seven, and the Commonwealth. 
London is exerting its pressure for such an agreement 
primarily on Bonn. Common Market officials believe that 
thus far the West German Foreign Ministry is resisting these 
pressures and has not yet produced any new plan for linking 
the Community with Britain and the Commonwealth. They 
are not sure, however, how firm this resistance is, and be-
lieve that Adenauer�ordinarily a strong supporter of the 
Common Market--is increasingly influenced by German in-
dustry, which has long wanted an economic association broad-
er than the Community. If London and Bonn can work out such 
a plan, it will then be cleared with the respective members of 
the Common Market and the Outer Seven and presented as a 
fait accompli to the United States, which is opposed to any 
preferential arrangement between the two groupings. 
The initial reaction to the De Gaulle proposals has prob-
ably encouraged London to pursue its efforts to reach an ac-
commodation with the Common Market. Many within the Com-
mon Market have pointed out that, by proposing to put curbs 
on the supranational development of the Community, De Gaulle j

was removing one of London's major objections to it. More-
over, immediately after his July visit to De Gaulle when the 
confederation proposal was first advanced, Adenauer�apparent-
ly somewhat piqued with De Gaulle and with the Common Market 
--proposed to Macmillan a new survey of the accommodation 
problem. 
This may have encouraged London to expect agreement on 
more favorable terms than it is likely to get. The deputy chief 
of the American Mission to the Common Market believes his 
British colleague has recently made it "abundantly clear that 
Britain continues to seek in every way to retard if not prevent 
any real economic or political integration on the Continent" and 
has been told by him that "British policy on the Six-Seven issue 
has not changed in the slightest."
