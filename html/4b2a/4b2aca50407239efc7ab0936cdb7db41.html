 Soviet comment on the proposed Geneva conference last
 week devoted particular attention to the role of Communist
 China but failed to provide any clear indications of probable
 Communist lines of action.  Pravda stated that the invitation
 to Peiping marked the beginning f a "new approach" to th
 solution of international problems and that this actually
 meant the recognition of the Chinese People's Republic as a
 great power.
 Chinese Communist comment reflected satisfaction wit
 the Berlin agreement as a first step in gaining general
 acceptance by the international community.  The Chinese press
 obscured the distinction between the Soviet proposal for a
 five-power conference and the agreements actually reached,
 admitting only that the Western powers did not reject the
 Soviet proposal "outright" and that "other states directly
 interested" are to attend at Geneva.
 Communist propaganda gave much greater attention to
 Indochina than to Korea.   It left no doubt that one of
 Molotov's chief aims in agreeing to the Geneva conference was
 to block any possible increase in American military assistance
 to the French and Vietnamese.   Moscow charged that "aggre4;live
 forces in the West" want the Geneva conference to fail and
 that American strategy in the Far East is based on a continu-
 ation of the war in Indochina.   The Czech radio asserted
 that, in the light of these American objectives, the calling
 of the Geneva conference is a "severe setback for Washing-,on"
 and a Budapest editorial observed that the conference "assumes
 special significance."
 Soviet comment on the prospects for agreement at Geneva
 was generally limited to warnings that the conference wilt
 have "positive results" only if the participants recognize
 that the "final settlement of the Korean problem and peace
 in Indochina are possible only on the basis of respect for
 the lawful interests of Asian peoples fighting for their
 freedom and independence."  Peiping, however, asserted that
 "increased American intervention in Indochina is making the
 issue more complicated."   It added that since the United
 States had agreed to discuss the question of restoring
 peace in Indochina, "it should at once stop its intervention
 in the war so that the question may be settled through ne-
 gotiations at Geneva" and warned the French that they should
 try to "get rid of American intervention and control" if
 they wish to settle the Indochina question peacefully.

 Ho Chi Minh  in a broadcast of 3 March accused the United
 States of "another step" toward direct intervention in
 "allowing the American air force to participate" in the Indo-
 chinese war.
 Inside the USSR,  Soviet planners, in another move to
 bolster agricultural production, announced an ambitious
 program for expanding acreage under cultivation.   By 1955,
 more than 30,000,000 acres of virgin but largely marginal land
 are -to be plowed, of which over 5,000,000 acres are to be ready
 this spring, for planting mostly with wheat.   Areas singled out
 for special attention are in the Urals-Volga region and in
 Kazakhstan, where failure to push acreage expansion was men-
 tioned among the shortcomings of the recently ousted party
 leadership.
 Although the climate in the area scheduled for expansion
 is not favorable for permanent cultivation, production will
 possibly be good in the first few growing seasons when de-
 ficiencies in normal rainfall may be offset by the accumulated
 moisture in the soil.   In the 1930's, however, when similar
 experiments were conducted in bringing new land under cultiva-
 tion, early successes were followed by a period of total crop
 failure.  Again in 1940, the Soviet government announced a
 grain acreage expansion program in Siberia.' The present move
 to shift some wheat production to new soil is apparently in-
 tended to make more land available for fodder crops in the
 traditional wheat areas.
 The Eastern European Satellites are also attempting to
 increase acreage under cultivation.   Since the institution of
 the new economic policy,  the Hungarian and Rumanian governments
 have opened a total of about 2,000,000 acres of fallow state
 reserve lands for cultivation by individual as well as collec-
 tivized peasants.   The Czech regime is encouraging independent
 farmers to move to border regions to work unused agrirn11tural
 lands formerly owned by Sudeten Germans.   Several Satellite
 govPr-men.ts are also encouraging the planting of small private
 vegetable plots by nonagricultural workers.

 EGYPTIAN REGIME SHAKEN BY CRISIS OVER NAGIB
 The weak compromise reconciliation between General h`agib
 and Colonel Nasr invites further internal struggles in Egypt and
 may lead to the disintegration of the Revolutionary Commend Coun-
 cil (RCC).   Nasr's authority and that of the RCC have beE-n seri-
 ously weakened by developments which resulted in Nagib's restora-
 tion as president on 27 February, two days after his removal from
 that office and the premiership.
 The future relationship between Nagib and Nasr is still un-
 clear.   Despite a declaration of renewed solidarity, the situa-
 tion is ripe for a contest for power among various military fac-
 tions supported by outlawed political groups.   There are indica-
 tions that the RCC,  forced to restore Nagib, intends to restrict
 his authority.   If Nagib refuses to accept a limited role,  fur-
 ther dissension can be expected.    The Moslem Brotherhood and
 other extremist elements have reportedly played a part in Nagib's
 return and may be expected to try to establish working relations
 with cliques inside the government or with any faction attempt-
 ing to seize power.
 25X6
 While the RCC is at present reportedly cracking down on un-
 ruly elements, its continuing authority is still uncertain. Plo-
 ting and maneuvering within the council, as well as the possibil-
 ity of challenge from new military groups,threaten its previously
 undisputed position.
 There is little prospect for an early return to conA~titu-
 tional government, despite the public statements by Nagib on his
 return to office.   The necessary preparations are lacking and
 the military regime has no political organization with which to
 contest an election.  The political instability and the increased
 influence of extremist sentiment have reduced chances of an
 Anglo-Egyptian settlement on Suez.
 25X1
 25X1
 In the immediate future a period of confusion, internal
 maneuvering, and loss of power by the RCC is likely, with the
 resultant development of a more absolute military dictatorship.
 Extreme rightist anti-British sentiment, reflected by the Mos-
 lem Brotherhood,will probably increase.   The  Communists are not
 expected to play a significant role.

 IRAQI FOREIGN POLICY THREATENS ARAB LEAGUE
 Iraqi prime minister Jamali has defied the Arab League
 by pushing his proposal for a new Arab federation and by
 publicly announcing a military alignment with the West de-
 spite the league's standing rejection of such cooperation.
 These actions unmistakably challenge Egyptian leadership of
 the Arab world and threaten the very existence of the Arab
 League.
 Iraq aspires ultimately to a union of the Arab states of
 the Fertile Crescent -- Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Iraq -- under
 the Hashemite family which now rules in Iraq and Jordan.   On
 12 January at an Arab League meeting in Cairo, Jamali broached
 a proposal for the federation of two or more Arab states, par-
 ticularly Iraq and Jordan and possibly Syria.   This proposal
 was a rebuke to those who perennially preach Arab unity but
 accept the ineffectual, ten-year-old league.  The idea provoked
 stiff opposition from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Shishakli's
 Syria.
 The Iraqi government subsequently was accused by Shishakli
 of actively plotting his downfall and King Saud of Saudi Arabia
 told the American ambassador that he had documentary proof of
 this plotting.   Jamali hurried to Jordan to assure King Hussain
 that the federation proposal posed no threat to Hussain's life
 or throne.
 Recent events in Syria and Egypt have unexpectedly favored
 Iraq.   Shishakli, a strong opponent of Iraqi-Syrian unity, has
 been eliminated.  Egypt has been so shaken internally as to
 weaken any Saudi-Syrian-Egyptian alliance and lessen its ability
 to prevent Jordan from succumbing to Iraqi approaches.   I._-aq
 can now be expected to exert more pressure on Jordan and to
 exploit the more favorable situation in Syria.   Any success
 here would hasten the disintegration of the already seriously
 weakened Arab League.
 Meanwhile, Iraq is indicating a willingness to strengthen
 its collaboration with the West for the defense of the Middle
 East and has shown a definite interest in joining the Turkish-
 Pakistani security pact.   Recently, in answer to Egyptian
 attacks on Iraq's foreign policy, Jamali publicly declared that
 Iraq would join any pact at any time its interests would there-
 by be served.

 Approved For2elease 2004/0S/&17'RiC-i DP79-00927M'00200150001-5
 The weakness of the government in Iraq is internal.   Nuri
 Said, who controls parliament and whose support is necessary
 to keep Jamali in office, has opposed his reform program.       For
 constitutional reasons, Jamali must now make changes in his
 cabinet or resign.   If he is not continued in office, he is
 likely to be replaced by another pro-Western government, prob-
 ably under Nuri Said.   In either case, the government would be
 in a better position to meet the domestic opposition to align-
 ment with the West.
 In the past, anti-Western agitation has seriously en-
 dangered internal order, but the government seems prepared to
 handle any disturbances which threaten at present.   The boldness
 of Jamali's statements may have caught the opposition off base,
 and the weakness revealed in Syria and Egypt may deflate the
 fervor of anti-Western Arab nationalists.   The outlook for
 eventual Iraqi participation in a Turkish-Pakistani pact there-
 fore seems less unfavorable than before.
 Iraq's adherence to the pact would be a severe blow to
 the prestige of the Arab League and its collective security
 pact.   It would call for profound reconsideration by the Arab
 states of many basic attitudes and policies.

 GUATEMALAN ARMY INCREASINGLY CONCERNED OVER COMMUNIST TREND
 The loyalty of certain key officers in the Guatemalan
 army to President Arbenz apparently is wavering because of
 their concern over the growing Communist influence in his ad-
 ministration.
 The 6,000-man army is the only organized element in the
 country capable of decisively reversing the Communist trend.
 it                                                                                25X1
 has long been considered loyal to Arbenz as a leading army
 officer and former minister of defense.  Arbenz in turn has
 given its members unprecedented economic benefits in the way
 of improved pay, housing, and opportunities for graft.  Lately,
 however, some high officers seem to have become increasingly
 disgruntled.  Among their chief grievances are the inability
 to obtain much-needed military equipment from the United States
 and the country's growing international isolation, both direct
 results of Arbenz' pro-Communist policies.
 The Communists have been careful not to provoke the army,
 but their efforts to prevent it from hindering them can be ex-
 pected to arouse intensified resentment.  By arming labor "shock
 brigades" and by attempts to condition the rural Indian masses
 for violent action, party leaders apparently hope to develop
 sufficient armed strength to neutralize the army should it turn
 against theme   According to the American army attache, Mouzon
 and the army chief of staff have separately indicated thei-pn
 awareness that armed Communist-led groups represent a threat
 to the,army.
 There is no conclusive evidence that top officers are yet
 prepared to oust Arbenz or have made determined efforts to get
 him to turn against his Communist supporters.  Arbenz could not
 long remain in power, however, against firm army pressure.

 The 123-110 vote of confidence given Premier Scelba by
 the Italian Senate on 26 February foreshadows a similarly
 thin majority in the lower house this week or next, and
 parliamentary difficulties for the government on every impor-
 tant issue.  The moderate leftist composition of the cabinet,
 however, probably makes it the greatest threat in the past
 five years to the popular appeal of the Communists and Nenni
 Socialists.
 Scelba?s cabinet is the first to reflect the leftward
 swing in the election of last June and to meet the widespread
 objections to monopoloy of the government by the Christian
 Democrats and their close association with the church.   The
 Ministry of Education was given to the anticlerical Liberal
 Party and the vice premiership and key ministries of finance,
 public works, and labor went to the Democratic Socialists.
 The latter, having thus gained in both prestige and opportuni-
 ties to push reform measures, may now be able to win over
 some of the Nenni Socialists.
 Scelba has a record of fearless action against extremists
 of both right and left, and domestically he will be able to
 take a firm line without the fear, which handicapped previous
 premiers, of being labeled a fascist dictator.  The failure of
 the recent Communist demonstrations against him have strength-
 ened his position and encouraged the non-Communist unions to
 draw away from the unity of action with the Communists which
 has characterized the past six months.
 In foreign relations, however, Scelba?s room for maneuver
 will be more restricted.   He will have to take into account
 the drop in popular support for active cooperation with the
 United States and the mounting pressure for more East-West
 trade.   Despite assurances to the American embassy, the cabinet
 probably does not want to risk its existence on EDC and was
 reluctant to push for action on the treaty prior to some favor-
 able decision on the Trieste issue.  There are other indications
 that the Italian government also wants to wait for French
 ratification.
 The government's margin of support in parliament is thin
 but a widespread desire in political circles to avoid new
 elections now, which might be necessary should Scelba fall,
 will be a factor tending to maintain him in power.

 FINNISH ELECTIONS MAY SHOW SMALL COMMUNIST GAINS
 The special Finnish parliamentary elections on 7 and 8
 March are expected to result in small gains for the Communist-
 dominated People's Democratic Union (SKDL) and the Social. Demo-
 crats, but major shifts in the country's policies or political
 alignments seem unlikely.  The elections, originally scheduled
 for July, were advanced in an effort to end the unstable polit-
 ical  situation which has existed since the resignation cf the
 Agrarian-dominated Kekkonen government last November.   TI-ere
 are no critical campaign issues.
 The SKDL, which in 1951 increased its representation.-. in
 the 200-member parliament from 38 to 43 seats, is expected to
 win two or three of the 51 seats now held by the Agrariars.
 Simultaneous losses to the Social Democrats, however, will al-
 most certainly keep the number of is seats below the 49 it
 won in 1945.   The SKDL may profit from the USSR's recent
 agreement to liquidate Soviet trade deficits in Western cur-
 rencies and to grant a gold loan to Finland.   Travel diffi-
 culties at this time of the year in the far north, where the
 Agrarians and the SKDL dominate the political scene, will
 probably have less effect on the disciplined SKDL electorate
 than on other voters.
 The Social Democrats, largest single party with 53  .eats,
 have been strengthened by the gradual improvement of Finland's
 economic situation and a lower level of unemployment.   Par-
 ticipation of the Social Democrats, who have abstained from
 the present government, is considered essential to the ee,-
 tablishment of any stable coalition.
 The three smaller bourgeois parties, which hold a total
 of 53 seats, may also gain some strength at the expense of
 the Agrarians.  The Kekkonen government's economic policies
 were often unpopular, and Kekkonen's personal handling of
 Finnish-Soviet relations antagonized the conservative wing
 of his party.
 All political parties agree that for both political and
 economic reasons Finland must maintain good relations wi*h
 the Soviet Union.   SKDL demands for participation in a new
 government will almost certainly be rejected, however, aid
 all non-Communist parties can be expected to resist firmly
 any Soviet attempts to encroach on Finland's sovereignty:
 The chief postelection development now anticipated is a
 stronger parliamentary effort to remedy Finland's basic c-co-
 nomic ills, the worst of which is the high cost of industrial
 production.

 The Yoshida government is preparing to revise important
 features of the American occupation reform program during the
 current Diet session.   These changes would recentralize political
 and economic power along traditional Japanese lines and might
 threaten civil liberties and parliamentary government in Japan.
 Proponents of the "reconcentration" point out that it will
 provide the government with the means to deal more effectively
 with economic problems and internal subversion and at the same
 time help create more favorable conditions for rearmament.
 The recent trend toward conservative unity has assured
 Prime Minister Yoshida of Diet support for measures to re-
 centralize the police, restrict teachers' political activities,
 reassert direct government control over the civil service, and
 amend the antimonopoly law.   Of more far-reaching importance
 is the establishment of special committees in the Liberal and
 Progressive parties to study proposals for a major overhaul
 of the American-inspired constitution.
 Many influential conservatives advocate the restoration
 of Tokyo's control over local governments, with a simultaneous
 reduction in the size and powers of local assemblies and the
 abolition of local boards of education.  Deputy Prime Min:?_ster
 Ogata's proposal that prefectural governors again be appointed
 by Tokyo by-passes constitutional guarantees of local autonomy.
 In the labor field, stronger curbs placed on strikes in
 the coal and power industries in the summer of 1953 may now
 be followed by legislative action clamping down on slowdown
 tactics by government employees and granting the government
 greater authority over wage arbitration procedures.
 A tendency toward flexible interpretation of the 1953,
 amendments to the antimonopoly law has opened the door to
 economic reconcentration as well by permitting, subject to
 government approval, the formation of trusts, cartels, inter-
 locking directorates, and price-fixing agreements.
 The reconstitution of the Mitsubishi Trading Company, a
 leading prewar Zaibatsu concern, heads a list of projected
 mergers which will probably hasten the elimination of the
 small competitor.   Japanese big businessmen contend that large
 combines and controlled competition are essential to economic
 stability and the recovery of Japan's prewar foreign trade.

 Although recentralization is being effected in the name
 of economy and efficiency to mollify public opposition, the
 underlying  reason is a Japanese preference for the traditional
 way of doing things.   The proposed restrictions on labor and
 teachers' activities, however, are exceptions,                  motivated by a
 desire to curb leftist activities.
 Most of the older conservatives believe that Japanese
 spiritual regeneration and closer supervision and control over
 the lives of the people are necessary if the nation is to re-
 cover its status as a great power.   Toward this end, demands
 have been made to strengthen the imperial institution.   Similarly,
 the minister of education advocates the reintroduction in the
 schools of compulsory morals instructions and of the banned
 kendo, or Japanese fencing,  in order to rekindle the Japanese
 spirt,and restore national self-pride.
 A strong reaction against this "reverse course" has come
 not only from the leftists, but from the press and the youtiger
 generation.   Although revision of "un-Japanese" reforms is often
 favored in principle, distrust is widespread that the revisionists
 may go too far.   Newspapers have attacked the police revision
 bill, which centralizes control over police throughout Japan,
 as recreating the threat of a police state, and the proposed
 appointment of prefectural governors as unconstitutional.
 The revisionist movement is now under the control of  he
 more moderate conservatives, who though favoring a degree of
 centralized control comparable to the 1920's, wish to avoid
 the more unsavory aspects of Japanese militarism and ultra-
 nationalism of the 1930's.   Even Yoshida has spoken of the
 need to guard against the re-emergence of the extreme rightists
 whom he considers a greater danger than the leftists.
 At least some parts of the recentralization program appear
 certain to pass the Diet in view of the endorsement of the con-
 servative opposition.   Nevertheless, criticism of the police
 bill by some conservative Diet groups, plus the continuing
 cabinet scandals, will probably lead the government to dilute
 its proposals and shelve the more controversial issues until
 a more opportune time.

 SUCCESSORS TO MAO TSE-TUNG
 In the event of the death or retirement of Mao Tse-twig,
 the Chinese Communist regime would probably be headed initially
 by a coalition drawn from his four principal lieutenants.   While
 these men presumably would pursue the same basic policies,  their
 regime would face problems maintaining its stability and autonomy.
 During the plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party's
 central committee in February,  the Peiping press announced that
 Mao was "on holiday."  As Mao would have been expected to attend
 this important gathering, his absence has stimulated speculation
 on his possible illness.   Mao is 60,  and he has been reported for
 years, without confirmation,  as suffering from various dangerous
 disorders.
 Mao has been the unchallenged leader of the Chinese C:,-nnmunist
 Party for almost 20 years.   As chairman of the party,  the central
 government council and the military council,  he appears to be the
 regime's final authority on all major matters.   It is very doubt-
 ful that any one person has currently either the prestige ()r the
 ability to replace him in these three positions.
 Chinese press treatment of Peiping's leaders suggests that
 Mao would be succeeded initially by some combination of hi,, four
 principal lieutenants,  possibly ruling as a collegium.   For the
 past three years the press has ranked Liu Shao-chi,  the party's
 vice chairman who presided over the recent plenary session in
 Mao's absence,  as second only to Mao.   Of other leaders,  tie
 press has described only three besides Liu as Mao's "close
 comrades-in-arms" -- Chu Teh,  commander of the army; Chou l.n-
 lai, premier and foreign minister; and Kao Kang,  chief of the
 state planning commission.
 Liu, Chu, Chou and Kao,  all members of the party's polit-
 buro and all except Kao members of its secretariat, have long
 been publicly committed to Mao's policies.   All have followed
 him in repeatedly affirming their identification with the Soviet
 world view and program,  and in giving explicit recognition to
 Soviet strategic and doctrinal leadership.   Although their
 private views may conceivably be less positive, they would
 not be likely to alter a course which has thus far been
 successful.

 A split among Mao's successors on basic ideological grounds
 seems improbable, but there is always a possibility of a strug-
 gle for:personal power with a resulting period of instability.
 While the identity and strength of factional groupings in the
 Chinese Communist leadership is uncertain,  there are persistent
 reports that Mao's lieutenants have personal followings.   In
 any contest for primacy,  Liu Shao-chi would appear to have a
 slight edge, although Chu Teh, Mao's oldest comrade and the
 chief surviving symbol of the original movement, might become
 the formal head of the regime.  The chances for Chou En-las or
 Kao Kang initially becoming either the actual.'or nominal leader
 of the regime seem somewhat less.
 The regime's stability might also be affected adversely by
 competition among the principal branches -- the party,  the
 government and the army.   The party under Mao has been able to
 control both the government and the army by a system of concur-
 rent positions, with party leaders occupying all key posts in
 the other, two.   Any post-Mao split among the party leaders --
 for example, with Liu dominant in the party,  Chu in the army,
 and Chou in the government -- might extend throughout the three
 structures, although its intensity cannot be calculated.
 The emerging leadership, whether collegial or individual,
 would be unable initially, in any case, to command the degree of
 allegiance given Mao by the party rank and file and by groups
 outside the party whose support has been essential to Peiping's
 program.   Although the Orbit emphasis on collective leadership
 since Stalin's death has led to some modification of Chinese
 propaganda on Mao's personal leadership, he is still the symbol
 of Communist achievements in China and Communist promises for
 the future in the eyes of the great bulk of the party and its
 supporters.   His disappearance from the scene would probably
 result in a decline in the regime's prestige within China as
 well as abroad.
 The USSR might well try to exploit any instability in the
 Peiping regime arising from the succession question.   Thus far
 Moscow has appeared to deal -- uniquely -- with Peiping on a
 state-to-state basis, apparently refraining from any attempt
 to subvert Mao's control.  One of Mao's successors might
 sooner or later bid for Soviet backing against the others,
 thus increasing the Kremlin's opportunities for compromising
 the Chinese party's organizational autonomy.   In any event!
 Mao's successors,  lacking his stature vis-a-vis Soviet leaders,
 would probably find themselves at a greater disadvantage in
 negotiating with the Soviet Union.

 SHARP 1953 DECLINE IN SATELLITE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH
 TO CONTINUE IN 1954
 Official figures on the abrupt slowdown of East European
 industrialization in 1953 underscore the magnitude of the
 economic difficulties confronting the Satellites.  Plans for
 1954 in several countries call for still smaller increases in
 industrial production as a result of the curtailment of in-
 vestment in heavy industry and the diversion of resources to
 previously neglected production of agricultural and consumer
 goods.
 The growth in industrial output claimed by East Germany,
 Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria ranged from 17
 to 23.6 percent in 1952 and from 10 to 14.4 percent in 1953.
 Only in Poland was there no sharp drop in the growth rate in
 1953, when industrial production expanded by 17.5 percent as
 compared to 20 percent in 1952.
 While these declines were accentuated by the new programs
 adopted in mid-1953, they had already become apparent early in
 1953, and were due largely to difficulties which arose from
 attempts to achieve broad-scale industrialization with little
 regard for the material resources available, and from a coercive
 agricultural policy which caused widespread peasant opposition.
 Apathy among workers, caused by consumer goods shortages,
 inflation, and confiscatory currency reforms, made for :=ow
 labor productivity.
 Only downward revisions in the annual goals during 1953
 made it possible for most Satellites to state that industrial
 production plans had been exceeded.   Czechoslovakia, how-
 ever, claimed only 99-percent fulfillment.   The origi.na_ 1953
 Hungarian and Rumanian plans called for production increases
 of 16 and 24 percent over 1952, but were "overfulfilled" by
 gains of only 11.8 and 14.4 percent respectively.
 The greatest difficulties arose in the fuel and power
 industries.   Failure to meet coal output quotas and the re-
 sulting shortages of electric power were a primary factor in
 limiting industrial expansion.   The elimination of these,
 shortages is one of the main tasks outlined for 1954..
 Further sharp declines in the growth of industrial out-
 put have been announced for 1954.   Industrial production is
 to be only 12 percent in Poland, 5.1 percent in Czechoslovakia,
 and 405 percent in Hungary.   Czech president Zapotocky's state-
 ment on 25 February that "our special aim is the proper

 proportioning of military production so as not to impede
 the rising living standards of our people" is a clear in-
 dication that military expansion is being subordinated.
 Rumania, which has not yet announced its 1954 plan goals,
 experienced a growth rate below eight percent during the
 second half of 1953, and its industrial production will prob-
 ably                        expand at about this rate in 1954.   In East Germany, due
 to the end of reparations payments and other uncompensated
 deliveries which took about nine percent of industrial output,
 no further decline in industrial growth is expected in 1954.
 These plans, by curtailing investment in heavy industry,
 will enable the Satellite governments to devote a larger part
 of their national income to increasing production of agri.c:ul-
 tural and consumer goods, in the hope of providing greater
 work incentives and raising labor productivity.   Most of them
 have announced that some progress was made in late 1953 in
 increasing the retail trade turnover, although sketchy evidence
 suggests that the accomplishments were limited.
 While official announcements revealed that 1953 agricul-
 tural production was somewhat above the very poor 1952 l-gels,
 the minor increases were inadequate to meet the needs of most
 of the Satellites.   Collectivization, which had been vigorously
 pushed in 1952 and early 1953,slowed down drastically after
 the new course began, and in hungary and Czechoslovakia there
 has been an exodus of peasants from collective farms.   P-,-;r
 weather during the fall planting season will help make it
 difficult to reach 1954 agricultural goals.
 The measures adopted for 1954 and 1955 are not sufficient
 to overcome the shortages of key raw materials,  low labor
 productivity, and peasant opposition, and if the Satellites
 attempt to return to their harsher policies of industrial=.zation
 and collectivization in 1956, when new coordinated five-year
 plans are scheduled to begin., they will probably be conffionted
 with even greater peasant and worker resistance.

 SOVIET POLICIES IN MIDDLE EAST UNDER MALENKOV
 The more temperate policies of the Malenkov regime have
 found particular application in the Near and Middle East,
 where the nature of a number of outstanding problems enabled
 the Kremlin to make conciliatory moves without jeopardizing
 its strategic interests.   These policies, which have entailed
 expansion of Soviet political, economic, and cultural activities,
 are aimed at forestalling any recovery of Western influence,
 particularly any Western-supported defense arrangement.
 Within five months after Stalin's death, diplomatic rela-
 tions were re-established with Israel.   A note to Ankara re-
 nounced Soviet territorial claims against Turkey and expressed
 the belief that mutual agreement could ensure Soviet security
 in the Straits.   With the appointment of a new top-ranking
 ambassador to Iran, plans were set afoot for resolving outstand-
 ing financial disputes and border problems, including the dis-
 position of the jointly held Caspian Sea fisheries.
 Soviet representatives of all ranks have reflected the
 Malenkov policy of demonstrating Soviet "good will."   The dis-
 semination of printed propaganda, often in native languages,
 and the showing of Soviet films increased in the major states
 of the area, and a number of cultural delegations,  including
 prominent non-Communists, were invited to visit the USSR.
 Soviet trade policies, aimed at strengthening ties with
 underdeveloped countries and stimulating the flow of raw
 materials to the USSR, prepared the ground for raising the
 previous low level of trade.   The USSR signed various agree-
 ments,  formalizing commercial relations with Israel and re-
 portedly with Lebanon, and calling for sharp rises in already
 established trade with other countries.
 Moscow scored its most outstanding success in Iran, where
 agreements signed in June and September quadrupled 1952 trade
 quotas.   These agreements brought scheduled Soviet-Iranian trade
 to an all-time high.   Fulfillment of these agreements would
 raise the Soviet share of Iranian foreign trade to about 40
 percent of the present total, which is abnormally shrunken by
 the curtailment of oil exports and trade with Britain.   An
 innovation in economic policy was demonstrated in Afghanistan

 where, in addition to customary trade quotas under a long-
 term agreement, a transaction was concluded in January pro-
 viding for a $3,500,000 loan and technical assistance to
 cover the construction of two grain warehouses, a flour mill,
 and a bakery.  There are indications that other such offers
 to Middle Eastern states may be forthcoming.
 Soviet trade with Egypt is apparently to be continued
 under a barter agreement now awaiting the approval of the
 Egyptian council of ministers.   This agreement, which is to
 be signed jointly by the USSR and Rumania, will provide for
 an exchange of $11,200,000 worth of Egyptian cotton for Orbit
 kerosene and other petroleum products at prices at least 10
 percent below the world market.
 The only reverse to Soviet political influence in the
 Middle East occurred in Iran with the replacement of Mossadeq
 in August by the pro-Western Zahedi government.   Soviet prop-
 aganda in Iran has followed a markedly restrained tone since
 Zahedi came to power, probably because Moscow believes that
 a campaign against his government would only push him closer
 to the West.  Moscow is unlikely, however, to settle any out-
 standing problems with the present Iranian government without
 significant concessions from Tehran.
 The USSR has consistently avoided giving any impression
 of partiality in the Arab-Israeli dispute.   Its "pro-Arab"
 votes in the UN have probably been an extension of its pri-
 marily anti-Western strategies rather than a policy of outright
 support for the Arabs.   The resumption of relations with Israel
 and the Soviet ambassador's subsequent presentation of his
 credentials in Jerusalem instead of Tel Aviv were both balanced
 by Soviet explanations to the Arab states.
 Western defense planning in the area provoked an exten-
 sive Soviet propaganda campaign beginning in September and
 culminating in Soviet and Chinese notes to Pakistan in November
 and December respectively.   The notes asked for "clarification"
 of reports about American-Pakistani negotiations for an "aggres-
 sive" military bloc of Middle Eastern states and about plans
 for air bases "near the frontiers of the USSR."  The pendiag
 agreement between Turkey and Pakistan was attacked by Soviet
 propaganda as tantamount to extending NATO to South Asia.
 Should Afghanistan or Iran move to enter such an agreement, the
 USSR would probably protest on the basis of the provisions of
 its treaties with both countries.

 ox-FItIAL
 The USSR can be expected to develop further its present
 policy in the Middle East, exploiting the opportunities pro-
 vided by the Arab-Israeli problem, jealousies among the Arab
 states, and the oil dispute in Iran.  The USSR's failure to
 date to take greater advantage of these problems probably
 reflects an unwillingness to offer the economic or military
 assistance necessary to replace Western influence and appre-
 hension that increased activity might produce vigorous Western
 counteraction.  There is no indication that the USSR regards
 a support of an internal Communist revolution in any particular
 country as practicable at this time.
