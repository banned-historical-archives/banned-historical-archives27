 two decades.  One-manifstatlon of our cogs-
 mon determination to frustrate the Commu-
 nist design to conquer Europe was the crea-
 tion of NATO.  Elsewhere In the world we
 have formed other. alliances,  The United
 States alone has suffered 150,000 casualties,
 since the end of. World War II in this effort
 to contain the.sgread of communism.'
 This worldwide effort by nations of the few
 worst has not been undertaken out of s
 simple quisoyd defig'bt to engage In taw"
 in distant places. ,Nor furs Is signify a de.
 sire to establish a new colonWism or any
 kind of special position.  The war In Vietnam
 is not only the struggle of a small ustion to

 tween the doctrine that "wan of revolution."

 Although the North Vietnamese have their
 own motives for their aggrealpa. In South
 Vietnam and have played the leading role,
 they have atwa p been backed by the Gringos
 Communists.  Should their aggression be
 s ucceesfuL the, Chinese Communists will
 have seen positive proof that their approach
 to International relations Is oorrsst.
 Such an outcome might well lead the
 Soviets. In their desire to ratsdn the leader-
 ship of the Communist bloc, to adopt a more
 belligerent stance In their relations With
 the outside world.  This would surely affect
 the West
 It would also be regarded everywhese as a
 reflection of the inability or lack of will of
 the free world to prevent aggression.  What,
 for example. Would be the reaction In Europe
 If the United States were to withdraw truss
 southeast Asia An the face of its commitment
 The - state of public opinion In the United
 States itself would also be afbeted.   Should
 YNstrssaa bs l"+ost,_ many vices would' be heard
 urging us to effect to 'resign harm the world"
 to fall back onto our "fortress America," and
 to gird up our loans for a contest with
 guided missiles.  This too would be some-
 recognition that the war is above }1l a pout-
 leas matter. In which the adbefeace of the
 people to the Government Is the crucial
 factor.
 lb an" this effort the United States has
 built up an able organization In Vietnam to
 a.elat the Vietnamese.  Ambassador Taylor.
 Ambassador Johnson, and General West-
 moreland head an American organization
 which has trained and helped to build the
 Vietnamese Army.  On the economic card
 social front the United States has contrib-
 uted to the building of aobocts, cdlndm and
 better farms, all of which are essential to
 gaining and holding the political support
 that must be had to win the war.  And we
 try to help in every way in tratolng civil
 administrators and In orating political en-
 ergy in the country:.
 Some have said that despite this effort the
 war in Vietnam cannot be woo.  Yet recent
 history shows that we have bees fighting
 wars of this sort -fax the past 20 years and
 that the record Is creditable. We of the
 free world won in. Greece, we thwarted the -
 Qommualst aggression in Eurea. we won to
 Malaya, we won In the Philippines. and we
 can. win in Vietnam.  We must persist and
 we must not play into the enemy% IIwdss
 by csuntiug on a quick sensational and esag
 way out,                     -
 Persistent execution of the political and
 military plans which have been agreed to
 will bring victory-provided outside paes-
 cures do not become too great.  These out-.
 side pressures occur la many torox, such as
 th problem of sahctdules from which Viet-
 namr can be attacked and the - Vietcong
 helped with  impunity.  Infiltration from
 such sanctuaries cannot be.atlowed to defeat
 the efforts the Vietnamese are laaktng.  We
 will not shrink from tolling such measures
 as seem necessary to cope with It,. .
 Another form of ^autstde.pyeuti e" Is fife
 desire in sans. quarters for on international

 that means you get a good man in each
 precinct-the arnaileet unit of government--
 to be chairman. and a ga:x1 committee of
 young men who have it stake In the -in-
 munity, who have a fan.liy, who own a farm,
 or who own a home, or who want to get
 ahead in  business or something-and you
 form a counterterrorist precinct committed.
 And then, with the help of the police---
 and where there lent any police (and there
 lsn't any in most places In Vietnam), you
 have the Army and the local militia backing
 you,  You  then  oo5iduct  a  census,  Jesus
 Identification cards, have a curfew, and
 everybody who is out aster 8 o'clock has to
 expiala why, or, if he doesn't, they give him
 the buatness.  And thus you go through each
 precinct with a tine-tooth comb.
 Now, .that's how you get rid of terrorism.
 And it isn't very fast, but it can be very sure.
 It has worked in many places where It has
 been tried-in Kuala Lumpur; In Algiers; in
 the Philippines; and in the city of Saigon.
 And then everybody gives the village chief
 and the chief of police where there is one
 some confidence that he may be going to
 live, and then he in turn can interest himself
 in the security of the people, aril you begin
 to get an upward spiral.  And then you can
 bring  in your  doctors,  and your school-
 teachers, and your welldlggera, and the ani-
 mal  husbandry people--and  all the other
 people that make life worth while.  :3o, that's
 one part of the problem.
 One of the best things that any American
 has ever said about Indochina that I've read
 with sold by the late Gen. Bedell Smith, who
 was the U.B. repreieritative at Geneva in
 1954, after the French had been defeated at
 Dlenbienphu.  Georges  Bidault,  who  was
 then  the Prime  Minister of France,  told
 Bedell Smith that he was thinking of reliev-
 ing General Navarre because of the defeat
 at Utenblenphtt. And General Bedell Smith
 said, "Any second-rate general could win In
 Indochina  If there werb a proper political
 atmosphere.-  A profound remark.
 Because, you sec. In this struggle there's no
 front, there's no rear, there are no flanks--
 and when the fighter wants to hide, he goes
 into the average Vietnwmese man's  home.
 When he wants to rest, he goes into the
 average Vietnamese man's home.  When he
 wants something to eat, he goes into the
 average Vietnamese man's home.   If he's
 wounded and he wants to get taken care of,
 he goes into the average Vietnamese man's
 home.  It he wants information 6s to what
 the army Is doipg, and as to what the Arrier-
 ics.na are doing, he goes into the Vietnamese
 home--and the old lady, the old grand-
 amother who is 85 years old, she can sit there
 and we what goes on, and she can tell him
 all about what she sees on the road-if she
 wants to.
 Well, now, the minute the everyday citizen.
 living in his home in Vietnam, says to the
 Vietcong, "You can't come in here to hide,
 You can't come In here to sleep and rest, you
 can't come in here to get food, you can't
 came here to have your wounds bound up-
 we aren't going to give you any informs-
 tlon"-the war's over.
 I was asked this question recently: "I sup-
 pose when we get rid of this Instability, then
 we can go ahead and win the war."  I said:
 When you get rid of the instability, there
 isn't any war.  The Instability is the prob-
 Ietn."
 This  is an oriental  country,  a  tropical
 country.  Now think of what that meats.
 In the tropics, nature is rich-much, much,
 richer than it is in the north. 9o, a poor
 mad, living in the Mekong Delta looks at the
 water of the rice paddy where the rice grows
 and sees fresh water fish swimming around,
 There are also ducks swimming on the sur-
 face, that eat the fish.  Then no place in
 Vietnam Is far from the ocean.  So this poor
 No. 12----- 9
 man can eat rice, fresh water fish, duck, and
 some of the most marvelous salt water fish
 in the world out of the South China' flea,
 There are also coconuts and pineapples and
 all manner of vegetables.  Living right there,
 he can, for next to nothing, have a per-
 foctty marvelous diet without traveling more
 than a few hundred yards.
 So this oriental and tropical Vietnamese
 has everything he needs close to home.  But,
 in addition to being oriental add tropical,
 he is also often a Confucianist. This means
 reverence for one's ancestors; it means great
 loyalty to family and to the small local group
 consisting largely of relations and near-rels,
 thous.  This is the loyalty which counts for
 him above all-others-for which be is willing
 to die.
 How natural for some of these oriental,
 tropical, and Confucianist Vietnamese to say
 to themselves:  "Why should I extend my
 frontiers 500 miles and pay taxes, and have
 an  army,  and a  navy, and  a  diplomatic
 corps, and all the trappings of a Western
 nation-state, when r don't need it?  It's all
 right for these people in the North-they
 have to, but I don't need to."  And, this
 would be an unanswerable argument-if It
 were not for Communist China.   It Is the
 nearness of Communist China which means
 that they must become a modern nation-
 state In order to survive,  In 1964 more Viet-
 nainese realized this than In 1454.  But it
 still goes against their traditions.
 Thus the concept of national government
 does not mean there what It meant in the
 West.  And a loyalty to such groups as Roa
 Hao and Coo Dal have a vitality for which
 there Is no counterpart in the West.
 So, what you aee there-and r think I may
 have Invented a word for it-Is a strong
 sense of peoplehood-and of group and fam-
 ily loyalty-but not the same sense of na-
 tionhood that we have.  These people think
 of themselves as Vietnamese, as being of a
 distinct race, which they are-you don't have
 to be there 5 minutes before you we that,
 They think of themselves as having their
 own language, which they have-their own
 literautre, their own an. their own history.
 They go 'way back-it's a very old civilita-
 tlon,  They do not want to be overwhelmed
 and absorbed by the Chinese,  but their
 "peoplehood" often doesn't involve the same
 attitude toward the flag. and the Republic,
 and the nation, and all those things that in
 the West we go out and die for.
 These people are brave, I must have talked
 with 5o of our young West Point captains,
 and, believe die, there are some young men
 that we can all be proud of.  They're with
 the Vietnamese army battalions.. They are
 enthusiastic about the bravery of the Viet-
 namese soldier-his oourage, his toughness,
 the long-suffering quality that be has,  But
 his loyalty has a Vietnamese quality to It,
 He Is loyal to his group, be Is loyal to his
 region, he Is loyal to his unit.  In our own
 Western European history many years ago
 them was, for example, the hike . of Bur-
 gundy, and the Duke of Normandy, and the
 Duke of Piciardy, and finally It was put to-
 gether and became France. Well, this coun-
 try is evolving from this medieval lack of
 rational orgatiiratton into the 20th century.
 It's making progress.  But It isn't-and it
 never was the same kind of country that we
 have In the West, and It shouldn't be judged
 that way.
 In the caws of Malaya, It took 12% years
 to win the struggle against the Vletoong of
 Malaya.  And the thing that turned the
 balance against the Vietcong. was when a
 political arrangement was reached between
 the Malay community and the Chinese com-
 munity.                                                                           When that was reached, then they
 were on their way. And I believe that, when
 a settlement is reached between the prin-
 cipal communities within Vietnam. then that
 913
 will be the beginning of a new day for that
 country.
 In conclusion: The struggle in Vietnam is
 as example of Mao Tee-tung's statement
 that "yotlttee to war without bloodshed and
 'war Is politics with bloodshed." Thus, poll-
 tics and war are opposite sides of a coin-
 or, as has been said, "the two wheels, or
 wings. of statecraft." Armed combat Is thus
 only one-and not necessarily the most tin.
 portant--segment of war,
 The struggle in Vietnam is thus not a
 war In the sense that World War It:?-tMt
 Xorea-was a war, because total etlitagy
 success In Vietnam unaccompanied by Itil!-
 effort will solve the problem; the probtern iit
 thus the despair of the headline writer and
 of the political stump speaker or of any
 kind of black and white phraseology.
 Therefore,,thaee who try to make you tibias
 that there is a quick solution or a simple
 solution or an exclusively military solution
 axe doing you as much of a disservice as art
 those who tell you that there is no hope,
 that we must pull out and that anothr
 southeast Asian conference (added to the
 two which have been already held- and dlai,
 honored) will do other than turn South Viet-
 nam over to the Cotn:nunista.
 They also do you a disservice who deny
 !
 that much has been achieved, that the =Ili-
 tsry program, the economic                                                                                                                              program, the
 social program, the informational program
 and the various technical programs have all
 accomplished much-have Indeed built the
 springboard of victory--and .that it Is the
 political,  counter-subversive.  counter-tar-
 roriat program which still needs special at-
 tention.
 It is accurate to say that a glass is halt
 full of water and it is equally accurate also
 to Say that a glass Is halt empty.  To dwell
 on the fact that we have not achieved vdo-
 tory does not negate the other fact that we
 have prevented defeat-and that a stalls-
 mate is much better than a defeat.
 It is not the American tradition to get
 lsanicky whenever there is rough weather--
 and to get desperate 'whenever It becomes
 clear-as it does every day-that a quick
 purely military victory is impossible.  It we
 decide only to Interest ourselves in the nice,
 quiet, neat countries  (which do not need
 our help) and abandon all the rough, tough,
 difficult places to the Communists, we will

 tough world which to aimed straight at the
 destruction of the United States and 'W'hich
 will make our present effort in Vietnam seem
 mild Indeed.  Win Or lose, the stakes tit
 Vietnam are enormous.  And we need not
 lose.
 THE NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL

 editorial In the Washington Post, Cant.
 meeting on a study by the National Com-

 The recent changes in the rules of the
 other body are a recognition of this fact;
 and?I am hopeful that, before logy, both

 EARLY AND FULL DEBATE ON
 SOUTH VIETNAM IMPERATIVE
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, last
 Friday, January 15, 1965, the able and
 distinguished senior Senator from Idaho
 [Mr. CHURCH], one very well versed in the
 foreign affairs of the United States,
 stated:
 The Senate has a responsibility in the field
 of foreign affairs. We have suffered from too
 much conformity of thought on the matter
 of Vietnam.  A dissent constructively ex-
 pressed, indeed, a full-fledged debate on the
 subject of Vietnam, is long overdue.  At the
 very least, such a debate would give the
 American people a better idea of the alterna-
 tives available to us.  It would give the
 President more elbow room, should he need
 it, within which to deal with this difficult
 situation in southeast Asia.
 I concur wholeheartedly in Senator
 CHURCH'S recognition of the need for a
 full, frank, and open debate in the U.S.
 -Senate-of, the situation in South Viet-
 nam. The American people have a right
 to demand such a debate on a subject
 matter so important to their future wel-
 fare and to the welfare of the Nation as
 a whole.
 As a matter of fact such debate has
 already started.

 GERALD L. STAN,
 .
 In tile issue of the American Legion
 magazine for August 1964, some of the
 pro and con arguments for our present
 position in South Vietnam are set forth
 by the able and distinguished senior Sen-
 ator from Massachusetts [Mr. SALTON-
 STALL]  and myself.  I ask unanimous
 consent that those arguments under the
 heading "Should U.S. Troops Be With-
 drawn From Vietnam?" be printed in full
 in the RECORD at the conclusion of these
 remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-

 (See exhibit 1.)
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, last
 Sunday, January 17, 1965, in the New
 York Times Magazine a similar discus-
 sion of the pros and cons of our con-
 tinued                                                               unilateral presence in South
 Vietnam by the able and distinguished
 senior  Senator  from  Oregon  [Mr.
 MORSE], and the former Ambassador to
 South Vietnam, Mr. Lodge, were set
 forth.  I ask unanimous consent that
 this discussion also be printed in full in
 the RECORD at the conclusion of my re-
 marks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 2.)
 Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, both
 of these debates in the Nation's periodi-
 cals serve a most useful purpose. But the
 debate on South Vietnam should be
 brought to the Senate floor for here
 there can be give and take which in
 years past has been used so often to
 focus public attention on vital issues.
 And at this time there can be no more
 vital issue than our future course of ac-
 tion in South Vietnam.
 The U.S. position in South Vietnam is
 steadily deteriorating. It is deteriorating
 despite the massive military and financial
 aid the United States is increasingly
 pouring into that country and despite the
 stepup and extension of our Air Force
 bombings which, although they have

 TROOPS BE WITHDRAWN FROM
 VIETNAM?
 YES
 ERNEST  GRUENING,  Democrat,
 of Alaska)
 The war in South Vietnam is not and
 never has been a U.S. war.  It is and must
 remain a fight to be fought and won by the
 people of South Vietnam themselves.
 Will to fight and will to win must come
 from the spirit of the South Vietnamese.
 The United States cannot instill that will
 in them.  For the past 14 years, U.S. military
 and economic aid to South Vietnam has
 totaled nearly $3 billion, but despite state-
 ments of leaders of both political parties,
 Vietnam continues to be rocked by internal
 strife which drains the nation of its re-
 sources.
 The root of the present dilemma in which
 the United States finds itself in South Viet-
 nam lies in the aftermath of France's defeat
 at Dienbienphu on May 7, 1954.  Today-10
 years later-the U.S. position resembles that
 of France although we haven't used a quar-
 ter of a million troops, yet.
 Those who compare South Vietnam today
 with South Korea of the 1950's make a great
 mistake.  South Korea had the will to fight
 and to win.   South Korea was a country
 invaded from the north--South Vietnam is
 a country divided within itself by a civil
 war.  More important-in Vietnam we are
 alone; in Korea we were in there as part of
 the United Nations effort.
 Where are our allies in South Vietnam?
 Over 200  Americans have  been  killed in
 South Vietnam, as we fight alone. Prospects
 are that we will continue to do so.
 The theory was advanced by the late John
 Foster Dulles that the United States must
 keep South Vietnam strong to prevent the
 fall of Cambodia and Laos to Red China
 like a row of dominos.  We poured aid money
 into each domino, including $300 million
 into Cambodia, yet it recently neutralized
 itself and fell of its own accord, thereby
 voiding the Dulles progression theory ad-
 vanced during the Eisenhower administra-
 tion.
 I consider the life of one American worth
 more than this.putrid mess.  Let us do a
 little hard rethinking.   Must the  United
 States be expected to jump into every fracas

 all over the world, to go it all alone, at- the

 perience has shown us that expenditure of
 blood and treasure has resulted In failure?

 of undertaking' to defend areas such as
 South Vietnam, whose people are so reluc-
 tant to fend for themselves.  Let us keep
 on, by all means, supplying them with arms.
 Let us continue to give them the means if

 We must reassess the Dulles doctrine of
 seeking to engage communism on its own
 ground-12,000 miles away.
 The situation in South Vietnam and else-
 where in southeast Asia cries out for inter-
 national solution.  The problem will not be
 resolved in battle but around a conference
 table.  The United Nations is such a confer-
 ence table.
 NO
 (By Senator LEVERETT SALTONSTALL,Republi-
 can, of Massachusetts)
 The withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
 .Vie tam would assure the Communists of vic-
 tory there and result in a drastic defeat for
 the United States-morally, politically, and
 psychologically.
 The issues at stake in South Vietnam reach
 far beyond our minimum objective of preserv-
 ing the non-Communist social order of that
 country.  The war in Vietnam is a struggle
 for the survival of U.S. leadership in the fight
 against Communist expansion, not only in
 southeast Asia but throughout the world.
 Those who propose U.S. withdrawal, a nego-
 tiated settlement, or the neutralization of
 South Vietnam as alternative solutions for
 terminating the conflict there, have failed to
 grasp this underlying significance of the war
 and. the importance of its outcome upon the
 U.S. world position.
 While it may be debatable whether we were
 prudent in doing so, nevertheless, the un-
 alterable fact remains that the prestige of
 the United States has been fully committed
 to the prevention of a Communist takeover
 of South Vietnam.  If the United States
 should fail to honor that commitment by
 disengaging from South Vietnam, our default
 was disastrously affect world opinion and
 would surely be construed by the nations of
 the world as evidence of our weakness and
 vacillation in coming to grips with com-
 munism.
 Moreover, from the military standpoint, the
 U.S. formula for advising and assisting the
 South Vietnamese to resist Communist-in-
 spired wars of national liberation rests in the
 new concept of counterinsurgency-now un-
 dergoing its acid test in the rice paddies of
 the Mekong River Delta.  If this defensive
 concept falls in its purpose to overcome the
 creeping aggressions of Communist guerrilla
 warfare, the United States will have to admit
 to a military defeat in being incapable of
 devising effective military tactics to cope with
 that type of warfare.  As a consequence, an
 increase in guerrilla wars can surely be an-
 ticipated not only in southeast Asia but
 throughout the world as communism expands
 without U.S. military hindrance or resistance.
 Politically, a defeat in South Vietnam will
 be the catalyst for the nations of the Orient
 to aline themselves with Communist China
 which would, as a result of U.S. disengage-
 ment, become the dominating influence of all
 of Asia.  Should South Vietnam fall, it is
 more than likely that  communism  would
 eventually triumph in southeast Asia through
 subversion, bloodless coups, or guerrilla wars.
 The neutralization of South Vietnam is
 appealing in principle but it has thus far
 failed in Laos.  Similarly, a settlement under
 United Nations auspices is attractive in prin-
 ciple, but there is no assurance that the
 Communists would not undermine and sub-
 vert United Nations efforts in South Vietnam
 as they did In the Congo.
 The United States, whether rightly or
 wrongly, is so involved morally, militarily and
 politically, and its prestige so fully commit-
 ted in South Vietnam that it cannot coun-
 tenance a defeat there. Consequently, under
 present conditions U.S. troops cannot be
 withdrawn if we are to avoid serious inter-
 national repercussions.

 WE MUST LEAVE VIETNAM
 (By WAYNE MORSE)
 Ten years ago the United States embarked
 upon an adventure in South Vietnam that
 was just about 100 years out of date.  While
 Britain, France, and the Netherlands were
 terminating  their rule  over  their   Asiatic
 colonies, the United States began trying to
 establish its own beachhead on the Asiatic
 mainland.
 Although present at the Geneva Conference
 of 1954, which drew up the accord whereby
 France withdrew from its old colony of Indo-
 china, the United States refused to sign the
 final agreement.  So did one of the subdivi-
 sions of Indiochina, South Vietnam.   The
 United States began a heavy program of
 financial and military aid to a new Premier
 In South Vietnam who, we believed, was most
 likely  to  preserve  a  Western orientation.
 When it came time for the 1956 election
 throughout both North and South Vietnam
 required by the Geneva accord, we and our
 client in Saigon, Ngo Dinh Diem, realized it
 would be won by Ho Chi Minh Is followers not
 only in his own North Vietnam but in the
 South as well.  South Vietnam refused to
 proceed with the election.
 In the last decade we have explained our
 policy as one of helping a free government
 resist Communist subversion.  But South
 Vietnam never has had a free government.
 In its 10 years of existence its governments
 have been picked for it by the United States
 and maintained by our heavy doses of eco-
 nomic and military aid.        -
 The fraudulence of our claim has been
 starkly exposed by the successive coups in
 Saigon and by the piecing together of one
 government after another by the American
 Embassy. Leaders suspected of favoring neu-
 tralism or any form of negotiation for set-
 tlement of the civil war are firmly excluded
 from Government ranks.  The major tools
 we have used in manipulating political and
 military leaders have been various threats
 and promises regarding our aid, which now
 hovers around the level of $600 million a year
 In a country of 14 million people.  This sum
 is exclusive of the cost of keeping 23,000
 American "advisers" and large contingents
 of aircraft in the country.
 In fact, our official explanations of why
 we are there now play down the "helping a
 free government" lineand play -up American
 security and American prestige as the stakes
 In Vietnam.  At least, the explanations are
 getting closer to the truth, which is that the
 United States took over this quarter of Indo-
 china in 1954 when the French pulled out.
 Having  intruded  ourselves  into  southeast
 Asia, where we never were before, it was this
 country and not the Communists who made
 our prestige in Asia the issue.
 Our Secretary of  State often says that
 "China  must  leave her  neighbors   alone."
 Under this premise, our officials have vaguely
 threatened to expand the war to North Viet-
 nam and possibly China if we cannot win in
 South Vietnam.  But there are no Chinese
 forces in South Vietnam nor Chinese equip-
 ment in appreciable amount. Americans are
 still the only foreign troops in South Viet-
 nam.
 Nonetheless, China has the same interest
 in what goes on in the subcontinent of south-
 east Asia as we have in Mexico, Cuba. and
 other countries of Latin America.  She will
 increasingly  resist  having  hostile govern-
 ments on her borders, as do Russia and the
 United States.    We recognize and accept this
 principle as regards Russia, but we refused to
 recognize it as regards China.
 This has been true even though we have
 watched other Western nations ousted from
 Asia and Africa by rising nationalism.   It
 was inevitable that once China became part
 of this tide she would reassert her interest
 in the governments on her borders.  A re-
 awakened China would assert this intern:?t
 whether she were Communist or not.      The
 more we escalate the Vietnam conflict, the
 more likely China is to intervene directly.
 In South Vietnam, we invite China's ap-
 prehension, but more than that, in trying to
 surround China with American bases and
 pro-Western states, we have to buck not only
 communism but anticolonialism.  One of our
 many mistakes is to equate the two, es-
 pecially when antiwhite feeling is directed
 against the United States.  Advocates of a
 containment policy for China, similar to that
 applied to Russia with some success in the
 late 1940's and 1950's, overlook the impossi-
 bility of maintaining Western strongholds in
 Asia, no matter what their purpose.  What
 we could do in white Europe and even the
 Middle East is not to be imposed upon an
 Asia that is united in at least one respect-
 its determination to see the white man sent
 back to his own shores.
 With our great wealth we can sustain the
 current war effort In Vietnam indefinitely,
 even if it is escalated.  But it will never end
 because our presence and our selection of
 Saigon's rulers will always inspire rebellion.
 Far from maintaining our prestige in Asia,
 our present policy in Vietnam is eroding it.
 The fact that we are losing despite the steady
 increase in our aid, the addition of +23,000
 American advisers, and complete American
 air domination, has already led several Asian
 nations to throw out  an anchor  on  the
 Chinese side.  Of the famous dominoes that
 were all supposed to fall to China if we
 failed to take up the French  burden  in
 southeast Asia, Burma and Cambodia have
 already  neutralized  themselves. Pakistan
 has made it clear that the aid she gets from
 us is directed against India and not against
 China, Japan and India, the largest non-
 Communist nations of Asia, who might be
 expected to be the most helpful to us in
 Vietnam,  have  not  associated  themselves
 with what we are doing there.    A few days
 ago India's Premier Shastri urged a new in-
 ternational conference to negotiate a settle-
 ment.  He asked the United States not to
 press for a military decision and urged that
 we avoid a major military conflict.
 Of all the  nations  touted  as  potential
 Chinese  victims, only Australia and  the
 Philippines have offered tangible help in
 South Vietnam.  The Australian contribu-
 tion amounts to some 66 advisers and 3 air-
 cargo  planes.   The  Philippine  offer  of                                                                                                                             a
 force of volunteer veterans was  turned
 down.
 That is the extent of the local interest
 and support  for the American view that
 we are saving all of Asia from communism
 by our policy in Vietnam.  Surely if one of
 these so-called dominoes believed it, they
 would be fighting side by side with us in
 Vietnam.  They are not, because they see
 us having to run faster and faster just to
 stay in the same place in Vietnam.   They
 see that the bulk of its people are too in-
 different  to American  objectives  to resist
 the Vietcong.   They know that sooner  or
 later we will have to leave and they do not
 want to jeopardize their own standing in
 Asia by supporting a last-minute white
 intervention.        -

 crawl back from the limb we crawled out

 Asia Treaty Organization, the United Na-
 tions or a reconvened Geneva conference
 we could seek to establish an international
 presence in Vietnam to stabilize and pacify
 the country while it develops political in-
 stitutions.  Our refusal to sign the accord
 of 1954 has always made suspect our claim
 that we were enforcing it.
 In truth, our enforcement has taken the
 form of violations far more massive than
 any violations by North Vietnam.  Our jet
 air forces and bases, our helicopter fleet,
 the  23,000  U.S.  military  advisers are  all
 violations of the 1954 accord.     So are they
 violations of section after   section of the
 United Nations Charter, under which we
 are pledged to seek peaceful solutions to
 disputes and to lay before the U.N. those
 disputes we are unable to solve peacefully
 through means of our own choosing.  We
 have done neither in Vietnam.
 A negotiated settlement in South Vietnam
 is the first solution we are obliged to seek.
 Of course, it would mean some guaranteed
 neutralization of the country.  That would
 give its war-torn people the best chance they
 have yet had to construct a country of their
 own, something the French, the Japanese,
 the French again, and now the Americans
 have not given them.
 If we fail to reach a negotiated settlement,
 then the U.N. Charter requires the dispute
 to be laid before a regional organization,
 such as SEATO, or one of the U.N. bodies.
 Both groups have the capacity to police the
 country; both the more likely to bring it
 some degree of cohesion than is the United
 States with its unilateral intervention in
 pursuit of our own interests.
 Some Americans have busily erected an
 enormous pyramid of disasters they contend
 would result even from this limited Ameri-
 can retrenchment.  They see America as a
 power in the Pacific only if we and our
 friends control all its shores instead of just
 its northern, eastern, and southern shores,
 plus the island fringe off its western shore.
 Most important, they ignore the impossibility
 of creating an American foothold on that
 shore in mid-20th century, communism or no
 communism.
 Many countries, East and West, have ac-
 commodated themselves to the end of the
 old order in Asia.  We will, too, eventually.
 The only question is how much blood and
 money we will waste first trying to turn the
 clock back.

 WE CAN WIN IN VIETNAM
 (By Henry Cabot Lodge)
 "Pulling out of Vietnam"  Is exactly the
 same as "turning Vietnam over to the Com-
 munists."  Such  a  course would not  be
 merely imprudent, but actually extremely
 dangerous.
 Geographically, Vietnam stands at the hub
 of a vast area of the world-southeast Asia-
 an area with a population of 240 million
 people extending 2,300 miles from north to
 south, and 3,000 miles from east to west.
 The  Mekong  River, one of the 10 largest
 rivers in the world, reaches the sea in South
 Vietnam. He who holds or has influence
 in Vietnam can affect the future of the Phil-
 ippines and Taiwan to the east, Thailand and
 Burma with their huge rice surpluses to the
 west, and Malaysia and Indonesia with their
 rubber, oil, and tin to the south.  Japan,
 Australia, and New Zealand would in turn
 be deeply concerned by the communization
 of South Vietnam.
 Historically, Vietnam has long played a
 part in  the  political development of the
 Far East.      For many centuries it was under
 the occupation or influence of the Chinese
 and was used by the Chinese as a means of
 enforcing their hegemony over the whole of
 southeast Asia.  The Vietnamese did_not en-
 joy this experience and have traditionally
 done what they could to throw off Chinese
 overlordship.  In a very real sense, there-
 fore, the present struggle is one of self-
 determination.
 But today Vietnam should be seen as one
 more instance in a long series of events
 which began in Iran, Turkey, and Greece
 after World War II; which include the seizure
 of Czechoslovakia; which led to the Marshall
 plan in Europe; which caused the Korean
 war, the Malayan emergency, the Huk re-
 bellion in the Philippines, and the Berlin
 crisis,  In all these widely separated places
 the Communist bloc has tried to subvert and
 to undermine the free world in order to
 spread its control and its suppression of free-
 dom.
 In opposing this Communist onslaught, the
 free world has stood together for nearly two
 decades.  One manifestation of our common
 determination to frustrate the Communist
 design to conquer Europe was the creation
 of NATO.  Elsewhere in the world we have
 formed other alliances.  The United States
 alone has suffered 160,000 casualties since
 the end of World War II in this effort to
 contain the spread of communism.
 This worldwide effort by nations of the
 free  world  has not been undertaken  out
 of a simple quizotic delight in engaging in
 battles in distant places.  Nor does it sig-
 nify a desire to establish a new colonialism
 or any kind of special position.  The war
 in Vietnam is not only the struggle of a
 small nation to exist, but it is also an open
 encounter between the doctrine that "wars
 of revolution," as the Communist call them,
 are the wave of the future, and our belief
 that in the future nations should be allowed
 to develop their own destinies free from out-
 side interference.
 Although the North Vietnamese have their
 own motives for their aggression in South
 Vietnam and have played the leading role,
 they have always been backed by the Chi-
 nese Communists.  Should their aggression
 be successful, the Chinese Communists will
 have  seen  positive proof  that  their  ap-
 proach to international relations is correct.
 Such    an  outcome might well lead      the
 Soviets, in their desire to retain the leader-
 ship of the Communist bloc, to adopt a more
 belligerent stance in their relations with the
 outside world. This would surely affect the
 West.
 It would also be regarded everywhere as a
 reflection of the inability or lack of will of
 the free world to prevent aggression.  What,
 for example, would be the reaction in Europe
 if the United States were to withdraw from
 southeast Asia in the face of the commit-
 ment to assist the nations there?
 The state of public opinion in the United
 States itself would also be affected.  Should
 Vietnam be lost, many voices would be heard
 urging us in effect to "resign from the world,"
 fall back onto our "fortress America" and gird
 up our loins for a contest with guided mis-
 siles.  This too would be something which
 neither Europe nor the rest of the free world
 could ignore.
 Because of all these considerations, the
 United States has undertaken to support the
 Vietnamese both politically and militarily,
 in an effort which has cost us lives and treas-
 ure.                                                                 The effort has not been in vain.
 Although we are not yet victorious, we have
 achieved a stalemate, which is surely much
 better than defeat.  On the economic and
 social front the United States has contrib-
 uted to the building of schools, clinics, and
 better farms, all of which are essential to
 gaining and holding the political support
 that must be had to win the war.  And we
 try to help in every way in training civil ad-
 ministrators and in creating political energy
 in the country.
 Some have said that despite this effort the
 war in Vietnam cannot be won.  Yet recent
 history shows that we have been fighting
 wars of this sort for the past 20 years and
 that the record is creditable.  We of the
 free world won in Greece, we thwarted the
 Communist aggression in Korea, we won in
 Malaya, we won in the Philippines, and we
 can win in Vietnam.  We must persist and
 we must not play into the enemy's hands
 by counting on a quick, sensational, and easy
 way out and then being disappointed when
 it does not occur.
 Persistent execution of the political and
 military plans which have been agreed to
 will  bring victory-provided outside  pres-
 sures do not become too great.  These out-
 side pressures occur in many forms such as
 the problem of sanctuaries from which Viet-
 nam can be attacked and the Vietcong helped
 with impunity.  Infiltration from such sanc-
 tuaries cannot be allowed to defeat the ef-
 forts the Vietnamese are making.  We will
 not shrink from taking such measures as
 seem necessary to cope with it.
 Another form of "outside pressure" is the
 desire in some quarters for an international
 conference here and now.  We do not op-
 pose the idea of holding international con-
 ferences as an abstract proposition-if they
 are held at the proper time and under the
 proper circumstances-but we think that to
 hold a conference now would serve no good
 purpose  and  would  seriously  undermine
 morale  in  South  Vietnam.   Consider the
 reasons:
 1. There have already been two conferences
 on southeast Asia (one on Vietnam and an-
 other on Laos), the terms of which were
 satisfactory  but  which  the Communists
 violated  before  the ink was dry.   Before
 holding another conference there must be
 some sign that the Communists of Hanoi
 and Peiping are prepared to let their south-
 ern neighbors alone.
 2. For the South Vietnamese to go to a
 conference now with a large and aggressive
 fifth column on their soil would amount to
 a surrender.  A conference not preceded by
 a vertifiable Communist decision to cease
 attacking   and  subverting  South   Vietnan
 would be nothing more than a capitulation.
 3. There is clearly no agreement between
 us and the Communists on the simple prop-
 osition to let South Vietnam alone.                                                                                                                                            A con-
 ference held in an atmosphere of bitter dis-
 agreement could only make matters more
 dangerous than they already are.
 So-called  neutralism is  another  outside
 pressure standing in the way of the success-
 ful prosecution of the war in South Viet-
 nam.   Neutralism  that                                                                                                                                         does   not  include
 some means of enforcement, that does not
 include North Vietnam, that means South
 Vietnam  will  be alone  and  disarmed, is
 nothing more than surrender.  It should be
 opposed for Vietnam just as it is opposed for
 Berlin or for Germany.   It takes strength
 to be neutral. South Vietnam is not strong
 enough today to be neutral.
 In truth both Vietnams are "neutralized"
 now by article 10 of the Geneva accord of
 July 21, 1954, which said: "the two parties
 shall insure that the zones assigned to them
 do not adhere to any military alliance and
 are not used for the resumption of hostil-
 ities or to further an aggressive policy."
 This provision was formally approved by
 article  5 of the  final  declaration of the
 Geneva  Conference  of    1954,  which  the
 U.S.S.R., Red  China,     France, the United
 Kingdom, the United States, Cambodia, Laos,
 North and South Vietnam attended.
 We must therefore insist before there is
 any discussion of a conference or of neutral-
 ism, that the Communists stop their aggres-
 sion "and live up to the agreements which

 ceases, there can be peace.  At present, the

 force, and, of course, when they use force
 they must be met with force, as they were

 met with the strong and united opposition
 of the free world.
 It seems that conflicts In far-off places are
 precisely those which have often brought
 war and calamity to all of us.  Manchuria
 seemed far away in 1931; the subversion of
 Czechoslovakia by Hitler seemed remote to
 the United States in 1938.  Persistence, and
 unity in the face of Communist pressure
 have succeeded in Europe and in southeast
 Asia, and can succeed again.
 Mao Tse-tung said: "Politics is war with-
 out   bloodshed;   war   is   politics   with
 bloodshed."
 The struggle in Vietnam is not a "war" In
 the sense that World War II--or Korea-was
 a "war," because total military success in
 Vietnam, unaccompanied by success in other
 fields, will not bring victory.  A many-sided
 effort is needed; no single effort will solve
 the problem; the problem is thus the despair
 of the headline writer and the political
 stomp speaker employing black-and-white
 phraseology.
 Therefore, those who say that there is a
 quick solution or a simple solution or an
 exclusively military solution are doing as
 much of a disservice as are those who say
 that there is no hope, that we must pull out
 and that another southeast Asian conference
 (added to the two which have been already
 held--and dishonored) will do other than
 turn South Vietnam over to the Communists.
 They also do a disservice who deny that
 much has been achieved, that the military
 program, the economic program, the social
 program, the informational program, and
 the various technical programs have all
 accomplished much-have indeed built the
 springboard of victory-and that it is the
 political, countersubversive, counterterrorist
 program which still needs special attention.
 It is accurate to say that a glass is half
 full of water and it is also accurate to say
 that the glass is half empty.  To dwell on
 the fact that we have not achieved victory
 does not negate the other fact that we have
 prevented defeat-and that a stalemate is
 much better than a defeat.
 It is not the American tradition to get
 panicky whenever there is a little rough
 weather.  If we decide only to interest our-
 selves in the nice, quiet, neat countries
 (which do not need our help) and abandon
 all the rough, tough, difficult places to the
 Communists, we will soon find ourselves sur-
 rounded by a rough, tough world which Is
 aimed straight at the destruction of the
 United States and which will make our
 present effort in Vietnam seem like the
 mildest of pink teas.

 FOUR STUDENTS SHOT IN VIETNAM AS RIOTING
 SWEEPS Two CTTIEs-2,000 AT HUE DEMAND
 OUSTER OF HUONG AFTER OUTBREAK OF VIO-
 LENCE                  IN  DALAT-TROOPS  EVADE VIETCONG
 TRAP
 SAIGON,  SOUTH  VIETNAM, January  17 -
 Anti-Government demonstrations by student
 and Buddhist groups swept the central Viet-
 namese cities of Hue and Dalat today. Four
 students were shot and wounded.
 '['he rioting occurred as the Government
 reported two new clashes with Communist
 guerrillas.  In one battle, a Government unit
 outwitted the Vietcong and inflicted heavy
 casualties as they were preparing an ambush.
 At Hue, the ancient imperial capital near
 the North Vietnamese border, 2,000 students,
 including some Buddhists, massed outside
 the radio studio and shouted demands for
 the dismissal of Premier Tran Van Huong.
 They were angered by reports that the four
 students wounded in Dalat had died.  Actu-
 ally the students were being treated at a pri-
 vate clinic and the nature of their wounds
 was not disclosed.
 In the Dalat demonstration, 500 students
 paraded through the streets, forcing shops to
 close.  Policemen and troops set up barri-
 cades to keep order, but the preventive meas-
 ures  shortened  tempers  and  rocks  were
 thrown.
 A U.S. Embassy source said there were re-
 ports that a Vietnamese national policeman
 in civilian clothes had fired the shots.
 The demonstrators were reported to include
 students from two Government-run high
 schools-the Hung Dao School for boys and
 the Bui Thi Xuan School for girls-and from
 a Buddhist school.
 In the fighting at Tayninh, near the Cam-
 bodian border, meanwhile, Government forces
 killed 25 Communist rebels after discovering
 a Communist ambush plot.
 Instead of breaking through the rebels'
 roadblock, the Government troops halted and
 called for reinforcements to steal behind the
 Vietcong troops lining the road.
 Two Government soldiers were killed and
 one was wounded.  A number of Vietcong
 weapons were seized, including 11 rifles, 2
 pistols, 2 carbines, and a radio.
 In other action, Government troops using
 105-mm. artillery fire, supported by Viet-
 namese Air Force strikes, drove off two Viet-
 cong companies 10 miles south of Binh Gia.
 U.S. military spokesmen said two Govern-
 ment outposts had withstood the Vietcong
 assault despite casualties totaling 10 killed
 and 15 wounded.  The artillery fire and the
 air strikes finally drove off the Communist
 forces, the spokesman said.

 THIRTY PERCENT OF VIETNAM DRAFTEES DESERT
 WrrssIN 6 WEEKS
 (By Jack Langguth)
 PHU BAT, SOUTH VIETNAM, January  18. -
 Tram Niem, a 28-year-old potato farmer, was
 recently drafted into the South Vietnamese
 Army, and he does not like it.
 "There has not been enough food for the
 past 3 weeks," the new private said.
 Although the winds were raw on the rifle
 range, he was firing in his bare feet,  He
 had never worn shoes before his induction
 and the, boots the army issued to him had
 left bleeding blisters on his heels and toes.
 Thirty percent of the draftees inducted
 with Private Niem 6 weeks ago like the army
 even less than he.  They have already de-
 serted.
 That percentage is standard for the Dong
 Da National Training Center at Phu Bai,
 near Hue in central Vietnam. Some recruits
 leave to attend to family problems, then
 return to camp.  There is no organized at-
 tempt to pursue and punish the men who
 do not come back.
 TRAINING IS VERY HARD
 Another private, Hoang Ton, the father of
 two children, said he was looking forward
 to leaving the army as quickly as possible.
 Private Niem's thin face was alert and mo-
 bile as he gave his reasons for wanting to
 return to his nearby village.  Private Ton's
 expression was sullen.  "All of the training,"
 he said through an interpreter, "is very hard
 for me."
 Unless he also deserts, Private Ton's return
 to civilian life is far off.  Both volunteers
 and draftees are usually held in the regular
 army for the duration.  In some instances,
 men have been released after 3 years of serv-
 ice, but a new soldier cannot count on it.
 During his service a soldier's pay is ade-
 quate.                                                                       A private receives 1,600 piasters, al-
 most $13 a month.  Woodcutters in this prov-
 ince learn a quarter of that.
 The training that perplexes Private Ton
 is based on U.S. Army manuals. It is divided
 into a 5-week basic course and a 4-week
 period of advanced combat training.  An
 added 3 weeks of training, which had been
 trimmed to speed the output of recruits, will
 soon be restored.
 The most time for any one aspect of mili-
 tary training, 50 hours, is given to teach-
 ing the new soldier to use a carbine.  Eight
 hours is devoted to teaching him to use the
 heavier M-1 rifle.
 Only 12 hours in the first 5 weeks are given
 over to political indoctrination
 Complaints about the food here go beyond
 the griping traditionally done by soldiers.
 The floods south of Hue have made trans-
 portation of supplies difficult and student
 protest  demonstrations  have  kept  many
 stores closed.
 Lt. Col. Tran Heuu Tu, who commands
 the Dong Da center, is allotted 15 piasters
 a day, about 12 cents, to feed each trainee.
 COOKING SOMETIMES EARLY
 Rice and meat strips are cooked in outdoor
 vats.  The food is then set out on plank
 tables hours ahead of time, sometimes with
 plastic sheets stretched across the plates to
 keep flies off.  Soup is heated and served in
 scrub buckets.
 Australian and American advisers at the
 camp do not interfere.  "We're not here to
 lecture them on sanitation or anything else,"
 one adviser said.  "We save our nudging
 for those areas of tactics where we might be
 able to contribute something."
 Dong Da is responsible for guarding Hue
 Airport ammunition dumps and a classified
 American radio-research unit in the area.
 Regular reconnaissance companies, back at
 the  center  for refresher  training,  handle
 most of the night patrols.
 Although the hilly countryside Is dotted
 with Communist-led Vietcong bands, the pa-
 trolling is generally uneventful.  When the
 Communist guerrillas have ventured out in
 any numbers, Government troops, with an
 assist from the trainees, have driven them
 back and inflicted heavy casualties.
 Despite these successes, the practice has
 been for Government patrols to huddle to-
 gether at dusk and move only during day-
 light hours when Vietcong activity was lim-
 ited.
 After forceful objections by the Australian
 advisers, Colonel Tu this week changed the
 procedure.  He ordered his men to travel at
 night in eight-man patrols.
 The new method has not yet been per-
 fected.  On the first small patrol the Viet-
 namese troops set out with live geese and
 chicken slung over their shoulders.
 While Western advisers deplore a prevail-
 ing lack of aggressiveness they have found
 that with proper leadership the Vietnamese
 make good soldiers.
 "And when leadership fails," one Austral-
 ian officer said, "You hear some lovely sto-
 ries about our men picking up a few Viet-
 namese by the scruff of the neck and saying
 'You're coming with me.' "

 DELAY  OR DIPLOMACY  IN  VIETNAM?
 Is U.S. military and diplomatic policy in
 South Vietnam the haphazard, improvisatory,
 Micawberish affair that it may seem when
 viewed from one angle?  Is Washington-as
 well as Saigon-merely waiting for "some-
 thing to turn up," which could point out a
 new path through the jungle of American
 troubles in southeast Asia?
 Or are recent American actions-specid-
 cally the heavy bombing raid against the
 bridge at Ban Ban in Communist North Viet-
 nam and the presence of atomic weapon-
 bearing Polaris submarines in Asian waters-
 part of a well-thought-out and complex dip-
 lomatic maneuver?
 We get no hint of an answer from Wash-
 ington.  This silence would be expected if
 Washington is conducting a delicate diplo-
 matic maneuver.  It would also be expected

 if, unhappily, Washington did not know in
 which way to move or what policy to follow.
 Three choices seem to lie before. Washington
 in South Vietnam today:   (a) to keep on
 helping South Vietnam fight to the bitter
 end, with a constant stepping up of Ameri-
 can military action, (b)a negotiated peace
 with the Communist North, and  (c)  to
 abandon the entire effort as quickly and as
 decisively as possible.
 Each of these courses is difficult. The first
 is the one which has been tried, but which
 does not seem to be succeeding.  The third
 would cause a disastrous decline in American
 prestige in the area, and would raise grave
 doubts all over the world as to Washington's
 determination to live up to its many commit-
 ments,
 The middle course is the one which appears
 to be receiving a wider and wider hearing in
 Washington.  Yet, if the present American
 -policy is veering toward negotiation, why the
 stepping up of the military effort?  May it
 not be with the intention of sitting down at
 the conference table in as strong a position
 as an otherwise disastrous situation will per-
 mit?
 If such is the case, it is understandable
 why Washington must refuse to answer the
 evermore insistent questions of those who
 demand to be told what the United States
 plans to do about southeast Asia.  If the
 United States is seeking to build a strong
 bargaining position, through an increased
 demonstration of military might, it cannot
 be expected to weaken that position by talk-
 ing about it.
 Perhaps Washington is not following such
 a delictae diplomatic maneuver.  Perhaps it
 is merely groping and hoping.  Perhaps it is
 prepared to step up its military intervention
 to the point where it believes that North
 Vietnam can be made to reconsider the cost
 of its growing intervention in the Com-
 munist rebellion in the south.  We do not
 know.  But it is doubtful if, with the war
 going as badly as it has in recent months,
 the answer can be long delayed.

 12 o'clock noon on Friday next.

 THE VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION  closing.  So far the only help we've received
 CLOSING OF LINCOLN HOSPITAL   from the Federal Government is to close the
 PROTESTED                            - veterans hospital.
 Mr.  HRUSKA.  Mr. President, the
 Veterans'  Administration  has  deter-
 mined that several VA hospitals should
 be closed.  The hospital at Lincoln,
 Nebr., is included among those to be
 eliminated.
 Many of us in the Senate and in par-
 ticular on the Appropriations Commit-
 tee have a great appreciation for the im-
 portance  of  eliminating  unnecessary
 spending. There are, however other con-
 siderations in spending the taxpayer's
 money. One of these is the defense of
 our country, past as well as future. We
 have a continuing obligation and duty
 to provide adequate and necessary care
 for our veterans.  When any doubts
 arise concerning the economy of cutting
 back on those who have given of their
 health and their lives, these doubts must
 be resolved in favor of providing ade-
 quate medical care for our ex-service-
 men.
 This obligation is not met by shipping
 veterans off to our overcrowded and dis-
 tant urban centers to spend their more
 difficult days. It is not met by removing
 them from their homes, the places they
 have chosen to return after defending
 their country. It is not met by sending
 them somewhere because others have
 chosen to go there or, in some cases, can
 afford to go there.
 Our veterans are human beings, not
 units or numbers to fill beds. We must
 see that they are treated as human be-
 ings who have come to the defense of
 their country when it needed them the
 most. The national conscience can allow
 no less.
 The distinguished majority leader, the
 Senator from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD],
 has pointed out the losses suffered by the
 State of Montana in defense installa-
 tions and now in defense obligations.
 Lincoln, Nebr., has suffered a similar
 fate.  It and Miles City, Mont., are the
 only cities to be hit by both the closing
 of a veterans hospital and an Air Force
 base, all within a few weeks.  We hear
 much talk about the computers which
 make these decisions, but are computers
 really coordinating all the factors which
 must be considered?  If so, their com-
 munications have broken down.
 When the Lincoln Air Force Base was
 closed, an economic development expert
 was sent by the Department of Defense
 to help Lincoln overcome the impact of
 the cutback. While he was busily giving
 advice, the hospital closing was an-
 nounced. I am told that he had to call
 back in disbelief to the Veterans' Admin-
 istration to confirm the announcement.
 Just as the Administration neglected to
 inform Members of Congress, it appar-
 ently failed to inform the Department of
 Defense.
 The president of the Lincoln Chamber
 of Commerce, Thomas Pansing, said
 that a team sent out by the Federal Gov-
 ernment to soften the blow of the air-
 base closing told him:
 The Federal Government would do every-
 thing possible to ease the impact of the
 Mr. Pansing summed up the feeling of
 many Nebraskans when he said:
 We can't afford too much more help like
 this.
 My fellow Nebraskans and I know that
 our economy can withstand these clos-
 ings.  It will set us back `but we will sur-
 vive. The Federal Government may well
 find another activity' to conduct in
 Lincoln.  But that is not the question.
 The question is: Will this provide the
 care needed by our veterans?
 I am gratified that the Veterans' Af-
 fairs  Subcommittee  will  study  this
 question. I ask unanimous consent that
 a letter sent to the chairman of that
 subcommittee, Senator YARBOROUGH, re-
 questing that such a study be conducted
 be printed in the RECORD at the conclu-
 sion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit-1.)
 Mr. HRUSKA.  Mr. President, when
 the Veterans' Administration briefed
 members of the Nebraska delegation on
 this action, we were not satisfied that the
 closing of the Lincoln Hospital was fully
 justified.  Additional  information has
 been requested from the VA on the future
 medical needs of veterans in the region
 served by the Lincoln facilities. It is my
 hope that the Veterans' Affairs Subcom-
 mittee will examine this factor in study-
 ing the decision.
 Let it be clear that this decision to
 close these facilities is the decision of the
 Veterans' Administration, the Bureau of
 the Budget, and through the Bureau the
 ultimate decision rests with the Johnson
 administration.  The sole elected official
 participating in this decision is the
 President.
 As Members of the Senate, we did not
 receive notice that these closings were
 under consideration until the decision
 had been made.  Within a few days
 after I was notified of the decision, an
 announcement was made that no more
 patients would be admitted to the Lin-
 coln Hospital.  It is my hope, therefore,
 that the Veterans' Administration will
 take notice of the congressional hearings
 and reverse its policy of refusing admis-
 sion to patients.
 I am gratified at the announcement
 that hearings are scheduled on the sub-
 ject of the closing of all Veterans' Ad-
 ministration hospitals, and I earnestly
 commend to the subcommittee the merits
 and facts which pertain to the proposed
 closing of the hospital in Lincoln, Nebr.

 should be accorded the objectives of the pro-

 national commitment made to our veterans,
 and the firm obligations flowing therefrom.
 if any doubts appear in the balancing of
 these factors, they must be resolved in favor
 of the medical care which our servicemen
 have earned and to which they are entitled.
 It is strongly felt, as I am certain the con-

 to the humane, moral, and overall wisdom of
 the course it proposes.
 To that end, I join with those of our
 colleagues who have already called upon you
 as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Subcom-
 mittee to make a thorough study and inquiry
 into all these closings, and that the situation
 in Lincoln and in Nebraska be given a search-
 ing, scrutiny with them.

 ministrations announcement, my colleague
 Senator CURTis and I held a conference in
 my office with Dr. Linus Zink who was cour-
 teously requested to be present by Mr. Driver,
 Administrator of the Veterans' Administra-

 which the Veterans' Administration decision
 was based.  Frankly, at the close of the meet-
 ing, neither my colleague nor I were satisfied
 that a case had been made out to justify the
 announced action.
 Dr. Zink agreed to transmit to us additional
 information which will be sent to you for
 the subcommittee records and consideration
 upon its arrival.  Communications and pro-
 tests from Nebraskans -veterans, patients,
 employees, and others-have come to me.
 They are being sent to you for the record
 also.
 It is hoped that arrangements for hearings
 will be made and announced soon, and vig-
 orously pressed.

 "COMMUNITY SERVICE--WE BUILD,"
 KIWANIS THEME FOR 1965
 Mr. HRUSKA.                     Mr. President, Kiwa-
 nis International has adopted for its ad-
 ministrative theme for 1965, "Commu-
 nity Service-We Build."
 An impressive presentation of the
 theme, the objectives and committee
 emphases for this year is being made this
 month at local Kiwanis clubs throughout
 the Nation.
 Mr. Robert Hasebroock, member of
 Downtown Kiwanis Club of Omaha,
 Nebr., has sent me a copy of the presen-
 tation "as an outstanding example of
 what freemen, through voluntary action,
 can and will do without government
 assistance."
 The Kiwanis program is characterized
 in this quotation from the presentation
 of its 1965 theme:
 There can be no building by freemen un-
 less men are free.  If we are to assume the
 continuity of Kiwanis service, we must as-
 sume the continuity of a society In which
 men are free to work toward goals which they
 themselves have chosen.  Service clubs have
 no reason for existence, even if permitted to
 exist, in a society where all services are pro-
 vided by the state; pervice clubs would have
 no sustaining force in a society where the
 state denies the existence of a Supreme Be-
 ing.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have the text of the theme pres-
 entation printed In the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the theme
 presentation was ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 COMMUNITY SEavIc&--WE BUILD
 They dreamed a dream.
 In an age obsessed with the material, they
 dreamed that man could give primacy to the
 spiritual.  Though nation was rising against
 nation, they dreamed that man could do to
 others what he would want others to do to
 him.  They dreamed that, in the heart of
 man, apathy could be supplanted by aware-
 ness-that Indifference could be transformed
 into  concern,  and  self-concern into self-
 giving.
 Fifty years ago-they dreamed a dream.
 The merchant, the teacher-the farmer,
 the banker-men of all callings-joined in
 that dream, having faith in the ideal that
 men working together in community service
 mightchange the world.
 Through the golden anniversary of Kiwanis
 International, we acknowledge our debt to
 those men of vision, and our awareness of
 the golden legacy which they created, nur-
 tured, and now lay at our feet for us to
 protect, enrich, and bring to fruition.  No
 other group of men has received a richer
 heritage than we.
 But dreams can pass into nothingness, and
 fade away like morning dew. Each age must
 dream anew.  "Each age is a dream that- is
 dying or one that is coming to birth."  With
 gratitude, we glance behind us; with a sense
 of destiny, we strive ahead, looking to the
 stars and hearing God's promise to Isaiah:
 "For behold, I create new heavens and a new
 earth."
 Change and permanence are the only cer-
 tainties in our future.  Change will bring
 about its own enchanting miracles-new op-
 portunities to serve, new resources to  use,
 new dreams to dream. No seer can yet set
 down the course of man in the next century
 or the next decade.  But as change is cer-
 tain, so too is permanence.  The star that
 led the camel caravan in the days of the Pha-
 roah guides the astronaut in his orbit.  The
 principles which have endured through the
 past 50 years of Kiwanis history will en-
 dure permanently, guiding us as surely as
 the Pole Star in determining the course we
 shall pursue.  Man can change and produce
 change, but man cannot alter the eternal.
 Let us then resolve to focus our sights on
 the principles which have characterized our
 50 years of service: faith in God, the dignity
 and freedom of the individual, citizenship
 responsibility, patriotism, and good will.  Let
 us resolve that as community service has
 been the dominant philosophy under which
 Kiwanians have served for 50 years, com-
 munity service will be the dominant philos-
 ophy of Kiwanis for the next 50 years.
 Whatever changes may occur in our manner
 of life or fortunes, whatever changes may
 occur in our organizational structure or our
 immediate  objectives,  community  service
 ,can be the permanent characteristic of Ki-
 wanis history.
 The past, then, is our introduction to a
 continuing drama.   As we enter this golden
 anniversary year, we draw the curtain for
 act 2, playing our roles according to the
 scenario provided by our forebears.  Reflect-
 ing our rededication to the spirit of Ki-
 wanis-past, the renewal of our vows to Ki-
 wanis-present,  and the affirmation of our
 faith in Kiwanis-future, our administrative
 theme for 1965 is "Community Service-We
 Build."
 The golden anniversary year provides no
 occasion for marking time while we celebrate
 the past.  The need and the opportunities
 for Kiwanis service were never greater.  The
 1965  theme  of  "Community       Service-We
 Build" not only provides the continuity for
 the mainstream of Kiwanis history; it chal-
 lenges us to complete the unfinished work at
 hand.  Stated in another way, the theme
 says: "Through services to our communities,
 we will build a better world in 1965."
 But where shall we build, and what shall
 we build?  What are our objectives for 1965?
 There can be no building by freemen un-
 less men are free.  If we are to assume the
 continuity of Kiwanis service, we must as-
 sure the continuity of a society in which men
 are free to work toward goals which they
 themselves have chosen.  Service clubs have
 no reason for existence, even if permitted to
 exist, in a society where all services are pro-
 vided by the state; service clubs would have
 no sustaining force in a society where the
 state denies the existence of a Supreme Be-
 ing.  If the time should ever come when we
 look upon man and see him as no more than
 a well-fed, well-housed organism in a god-
 less world, a statistic without individual
 freedom or dignity, then we can be certain
 that the service club movement is ancient
 history.  Our whole existence depends upon
 the freedom of the individual to act inde-
 pendently and to serve his Creator according
 to the tenets of his faith, whatever that faith
 may be, so the first objective for 1965 is that
 we build, defend, and preserve our heritage
 of freedom, our belief in God, and the dig-
 nity of man in his human and spiritual re-
 lationships.
 Two thousand years ago, it was recorded
 that a voice from Heaven spoke to shepherds
 tending their flocks and said: "Glory to God
 in the highest, and peace on earth to men
 of good will."  Whatever our religious faith
 may be, none can deny that good will is es-
 sential for the maintenance of peace and the
 strengthening of bonds among the free na-
 tions of  the                                                                                                                                     world.  Even among- nations
 which would be friendly, the seeds of dis-
 trust, of envy, and of fear are always pres-
 ent: this is a fact of life.  But distrust, envy,
 and fear can be germinated by ignorance and
 nurtured by misunderstanding.  It is pos-
 sible, as'the people of Canada and the United
 States have so dramatically demonstrated,
 for men of different nations to do to others
 what they would want others to do to them,
 yet this would not be possible without under-
 standing.  We know too little about our
 brothers In the other nations of the free
 world; we must work purposefully in 1965
 to bring about maximum contacts, maxi-
 mum communication, and, in turn, maxi-
 mum understanding.  Our second objective
 for  1965 is that we build international
 understanding by demonstrating the basic
 principle of the Golden Rule, using as an
 example Canada-United States good will.
 It is idle to speak of freedom without be-
 lieving in economic freedom.  Part of the
 heritage of freedom is that man has the right
 to own property, to operate a business, to
 pursue a profession of his choice, ' and to
 save, spend, or invest his earnings as he
 chooses.  This economic system has brought
 us strength; it has brought us prosperity;
 it has made independence possible.  It must
 be preserved from all substitutes and de-
 fended against all who would weaken it.  We
 cannot well defend or preserve what we take
 for granted, what we do not understand. It
 is imperative that we ourselves and the youth
 of our nations understand the fundamental
 principles of a free economy.  Therefore, our
 third objective for 1965 is that we build an
 understanding of and appreciation for the
 private ownership of property by educating
 ourselves and our youth in the principles
 of a free capitalistic system.
 Government at any level takes on the char-
 acter of those who govern.  Where our lead-
 ers are weak, our government will be weak;
 where strong, our government will be- strong.
 Patronage does not insure performance; lx--
 tegrity is not a necessary product of popu-
 larity.   Character and competence are the
 hallmarks of responsible leaders.  Kiwanis

 Any application by the Bank for bond
 sales in our market will be reviewed on its
 merits in the light of. the concrete situation
 at the time-including our own balance of
 of payments and the effect of any Bank bor-
 rowing thereon.
 Yet at the end of December the World
 Bank announced that it will float a $200
 million bond issue in the United States
 beginning on January 18, an announce-
 ment that coincided with the news that
 the U.S. balance-of-payment deficit had
 reached record proportions and required
 a special message from the President to
 the Congress regarding steps to curb it.
 I trust that this special message will
 report the reasons for permitting this
 World Bank bond issue to proceed at
 the very time when it would have the
 worst possible impact upon our balance
 of payments.
 Finally, I ask unanimous consent to
 have printed at this point a letter I have
 addressed to the Secretary on January
 8 concerning this matter.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 JANUARY 8, 1965.
 Hon. C. DOUGLAS DILLON,
 Secretary of the Treasury,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. SECRETARY : I wish to recall my
 letter to you of October 13, 1964, in which I
 expressed concern over the prospbct that the
 World Bank would seek to raise new capital
 in the U.S. market.  In your response of
 October 27 you stated that the United States
 should not at present prohibit "any and all
 attempts by the Bank to mobilize private
 funds for development through bond sales
 to U.S. residents."  There nevertheless was
 at least an implication that the bulk of the
 $300 to $400 million of new capital required
 by the World Bank might be raised outside
 this country.  According to the New York
 Times of December 29, however, the World
 Bank has now announced it will float a $200
 million bond issue in the United States be-
 ginning on January 18.
 It seems to me that the key sentence in
 your October 27 letter was the following:
 "Any application by the Bank for bond
 sales in our market will be reviewed on its
 merits in the light of the concrete situa-
 tion at the time-including our own balance
 of payments and the effect of any Bank bor-
 rowing thereon."  Frankly, I am not aware
 of any measurable improvement in our bal-
 ance-of-payments situation during the past
 2 months; indeed, I would assume the con-
 trary from the New York Times story of
 December 30, 1964, by Richard E. Mooney-a
 copy of which is attached.  The article re-
 ports that the OECD annual review of the
 U.S. economy contains the advice "that more
 curbs on outfiowing capital may be needed
 to put the country's international payments
 in better balance."  Yet the proposed World
 Bank bond issue appears a dramatic move in
 the opposite direction.
 In these circumstances, I would like very
 much to know just what sort of review of
 the Bank application took place within the
 U.S. Government,  Specifically, was approval
 of the application given by the National
 Advisory  Council on  International  Mone-
 tary and Financial Problems, and was the
 WAYNE MORSE.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I express
 my appreciation to the Senator from
 Missouri  [Mr. SYMINGTON],  who has
 performed yeoman service for the Sen-
 ate in his constantly challenging the ad-
 ministration's policies in regard to the
 balance-of-payments problem.
 Most respectfully I say to my Presi-
 dent, "You had better take a long, hard
 look at the record of your Treasury De-
 partment in this field before you send up
 any special message on the subject, be-
 cause you are going to be confronted
 with a long series of questions here in
 the Senate in regard to the policies that
 have been followed by the Secretary of
 the Treasury, which, in my judgment, are
 unfortu\iate policies, to say the least."
 N U.S. ACTION IN LAOS
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I see no
 other Senator who wishes to speak dur-
 ing the morning hour. I ask unanimous
 consent that I may proceed for an addi-
 tional 3 minutes on another subject.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that there be printed
 in the RECORD a UPI article appearing in
 this morning's New York Times entitled
 "U.S. Terms Raids in Laos Justified by
 Red Violations."
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 U.S. TERMS RAIDS IN LAOS JUSTIFIED BY RED
 VIOLATIONS-SAYS  COMMUNISTS  DISREGARD
 GENEVA ACCORDS-STRIKES To CONTINUE IF
 NEEDED
 WASHINGTON,  January  18.-The Johnson
 administration contended                                     today that U.S.
 military actions in Laos, such as the air
 strike last Wednesday against a bridge, were
 justified by Communist                                       violations of  the
 1962 Geneva accords establishing Laotian in-
 dependence and neutrality.
 It also made clear that it intended to con-
 tinue using U.S. military force, if necessary,
 to maintain Laos against Communist incur-
 sions.
 The administration's position was made
 known in two forms-a Presidential defense
 message to Congress and a statement issued
 by the State Department.
 ASIAN PROGRAM UNCHANGED
 In his defense message, the President re-
 affirmed                                                                                                        that  "our  program  remains  un-
 changed" in southeast Asia.                                                                                                          He said the
 United States would continue to give military
 and economic assistance to nations such as
 Laos and South Vietnam, which are "strug-
 gling against covert aggression in the form
 of externally directed, undeclared guerrilla
 warfare."
 In Laos, he went on, the United States has
 demonstrated since 1950 its commitment to
 freedom,  independence,  and  neutrality by
 "strengthening the economic and military
 security of that nation."
 "We shall continue to support the legiti-
 mate Government of that country," he de-
 clared.
 The President stressed that "the problem
 of Laos Is the refusal of the Communist
 903
 forces to honor the Geneva accords in which
 they entered in 1962."
 The State Department "also said that the
 American military actions in Laos were "en-
 tirely justified" by the repeated Communist
 violations of the 1962 accords.
 POSITION QUESTIONED
 Whether the United States still felt bound
 by the 1962 accords was questioned after it
 was disclosed that Americans had conducted
 bombing missions against key points in the
 supply routes used by the Communists from
 North Vietnam Into Laos.  Reconnaissance
 missions were acknowledged earlier.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE, Democrat, of Ore-
 gon, charged .last weekend that such attack
 and reconnaissance missions represented a
 U.S. violation of a provision of the 1962 ac-
 cords.  This prohibits the introduction of
 foreign military troops in Laos.
 When the question was raised last Friday,
 it was met by silence at th4 State Depart-
 ment.
 Today, however, the Department was pre-
 pared with a statement providing a justifi-
 cation for the air missions.  At the same
 time it still refused to confirm  that the
 United States had been conducting bombing
 missions against Communist targets in Laos.
 The statement, given by the Department
 Press Officer, Robert J. McCloskey, said:
 "We continue to support the Geneva agree-
 ments and the independence and neutrality
 of Laos which they are intended to achieve."
 Mr. McCloskey declined to say whether
 U.S.  assistance  included  the  air  strike
 Wednesday by a squadron of U.S. fighter-
 bombers against a strategic bridge near Ban
 Ban in central Laos.
 Mr. McCloskey did say that any "assist-
 ance" had been given at the request of Prince
 Souvannah Phouma, the Laotian Premier.
 The  Prince  is  understood  to  have  de-
 manded that there be no announcement
 about the missions.
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I wish to
 quote a paragraph or two of that article:
 The Johnson administration contended to-
 day that U.S. military actions in Laos, such
 as the air strike last Wednesday against a
 bridge, were justified by Communist viola-
 tions of the 1962 Geneva accords establish-
 ing Laotian independence and neutrality.
 It also made clear that it intends to con-
 tinue using U.S. military force, if necessary,
 to maintain Laos against Communist in-
 cursions.
 That  statement  is shocking.   Mr.
 President, I say there is no question
 about the fact that the U.S. military has
 conducted these raids. There is no justi-
 fication on the part of my party's ad-
 ministration for concealing from the
 American people this fact and no justifi-
 cation for not issuing a formal official
 statement that the United States is mak-
 ing war in Laos and killing American
 boys in that war.
 Mr. President, I am shocked that such
 a policy is being followed by the State
 Department and the Pentagon, and that
 we let the American people learn of our
 warmaking activities in southeast Asia
 through war correspondents. Then our
 State  Department  and  our  Pentagon
 attack those war correspondents.    I
 happen to be one who defends these war
 correspondents, because time and time
 again they have demonstrated that they
 will not follow the propaganda line of
 the State Department and the Pentagon,
 for if they followed that line, they would
 be nought but kept journalists on the war
 front.
 Mr. President, we are greatly indebted
 to the fat that at least our war cor-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE              January 19
 respondents abroad insist upon putting
 into practice the precious constitutional
 meaning of freedom of the press.  But
 the article to which I have referred is
 very interesting.  It states further:
 Whether the United States still felt bound
 by 1962 accords was questioned after it was
 disclosed  that  Americans  had conducted
 bombing missions against key points in the
 supply routes used by the Communists from
 North Vietnam into Laos.
 M:r. President, Britain, France, Rus-
 sia, and China are some of the other
 countries that signed the treaty along
 with the United States.
 The treaty set up an International
 Control Commission composed of India,
 Poland and Canada, to investigate any
 violations of the treaty and of the cease-
 fire between the rival Laotian factions.
 The London Observer reports that in
 the British view of the treaty, it is up to
 this Commission to investigate whether
 there has been any breach of the treaty.
 It is true that the American bombing
 raid took place in territory controlled
 by the Pathet Lao. Whether the Pathet
 Lao would permit the Commission to in-
 vestigate U.S. complaints of violations
 is doubted by American authorities,
 hence the resort to force of arms.
 Mr. President, my opposition to war-
 making policies of the United States in
 Laos is the same as my opposition to the
 unjustifiable killing of American boys in
 South Vietnam in a warmaking policy of
 our Government there.
 What we ought to do is live up to our
 obligations and call upon our allies to
 live up to their obligations under the
 United Nations treaty.  Great Britain,
 Canada, France, and the other signa-
 tories to the United Nations Charter, in-
 cluding the United States, ought to be
 calling upon the United Nations to make
 a report to the world in regard to the vio-
 lations of the Laotian treaty by North
 Vietnam, Red China, and possibly others.
 But, in my judgment, there is no hope of
 avoiding a massive war in Asia in the
 very near future if the United States con-
 tinues to take this present attitude-an
 attitude which was expressed by the
 American Ambassador in the United Na-
 tions not so many weeks ago in that un-
 fortunate speech he delivered before the
 Security Council, in which he said, in ef-
 fect, that the United States Intends to do
 what it thinks needs to be done in south-
 east Asia, and the rest of the world can
 take it and like it.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MoN-
 RONEY in the chair).  The time of the
 Senator from Oregon has expired.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that I may proceed
 for 2 more minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Is there
 objection?  The Chair hears none, and
 the Senator from Oregon is recognized
 for 2 additional minutes.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I wish to
 say to our Ambassador to the United Na-
 tions and to the President of the United
 States that they are skating on thin ice.
 The danger is that we are going to see
 an outbreak of a massive war in Asia be-
 cause of the unilateral action of the
 United States in making war in South
 Vietnam, in clear violation of the United
 Nations Charter, in violation of the
 Geneva accords of 1954, and in violation
 of our long standing, professed ideals
 that we are a nation that believes in sub-
 stituting the rule of law for the jungle
 law of military might.
 We are now practicing an application
 of the jungle law of military might as
 a substitute for our ideals.  So long as
 there is any hope of avoiding that war
 and helping to bring my country back
 inside the framework of international
 law and laying this whole threat to the
 peace of the world before the United
 Nations, the voice of the senior Senator
 from Oregon will be raised in that cause.
 I believe the time is long overdue when
 the President of the United States should
 proceed to make clear to the world that
 the United States stands ready for a
 review by the United Nations of the whole
 threat to the peace of the world.  The
 issue of the Congo will be coming up. I
 hope that the United Nations will go back
 into the Congo. Yet there are forces in
 the United States that would have the
 United States go into the Congo on a
 unilateral basis and allow the killing of
 American boys there in carrying out a
 unilateral American military policy.  I
 pray that before it is too late, we will
 try to put on the spot, so to speak, our
 alleged allies in the United Nations-
 Great Britain, France, Canada, Italy,
 and all the rest-who claim that they
 believe in the substitution of peaceful
 procedures for military force.  Let us
 ask them: "Are you willing to stand with
 us in trying to work out an honorable
 peace that will not result in carrying out
 all the fears that are being expressed by
 increasing hundreds of thousands of sin-
 cere, patriotic Americans, who are rais-
 ing the question: `How much longer are
 we going to cai^ry out a unilateral course
 of action and killing American boys in
 South Vietnam, when we have not yet
 exhausted peaceful procedures for the
 settlement of the dispute through the
 United Nations?"'
 I ask unanimous consent to have print-
 ed at the close of these remarks an edi-
 torial from the Wall Street-Journal of
 today entitled "If Vietnam Falls."
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 IF VIETMAN FALLS             -
 If the United States is forced out of Viet-
 nam one way or another, what does it then
 do about the rest of southeast Asia?
 The question may never have to be an-
 swered, and the U.S. Government undoubted-
 ly hopes it won't have to be.  Conceivably,
 in some fashion totally unclear at present,
 the Communist Vietcong attacks can be halt-
 ed and stability at last restored in Saigon.
 But since no one is putting many odds
 on that possibility, It is essential to consider
 the implications of failure and withdrawal.
 Though the United States has no known in-
 tention of suddenly up and leaving-its pub-
 lic statements emphasize just the opposite-
 it could be compelled to abandon the effort
 for at least a couple of imaginable reasons.
 One might be a military determination
 that the war is unwinable even in the lim-
 ited sense of getting the Reds out of South
 Vietnam; certainly there is nothing to indi-
 cate we are making headway after these
 lengthening years of costly struggle.   An-
 other reason might be that the Vietnamese
 would in effect ask the United States to leave,
 either through their leaders of the moment
 or through an evident unwillingness of the
 people to go on fighting.
 The South Vietnamese in general haven't
 shown notable zeal for the fight anyway, and
 their attitude Is  understandable enough.
 Not only does the conceptual distinction be-
 tween communism and freedom hold com-
 paratively little meaning for most of them;
 they have also been in this war, with the
 support first of France and then the United
 States, practically since World War II.
 As for the Saigon governments, if that is
 what they should be called, they have been
 unable to win the support of the people or
 exercise stable rule; the United States, with
 all its aid and influence, has been unable
 to promote or maintain such a government
 since the overthrow and killing of Diem in
 late 1963.  While the Diem regime was ob-
 viously no model of abstract democracy, very
 few governments are that, in Asia or any-
 where else, it did manage a degree of sta-
 bility.
 The United States which condoned the re-
 moval of Diem, is perhaps too preoccupied
 with governmental modes and deportment.
 If we have an important stake in southeast
 Asia, our policymakers need not to be so in-
 sistent that the government in Saigon be
 civilian  and  virtuously  democratic;  what
 should matter, from the point of view of our
 interests, is that it be an effective govern-
 ment able to invest citizens and soldiers with
 a will to rout the Communists.
 If  those  objectives  prove    unattainable
 and the whole thing blows up in America's
 face, it is needless to say America's interests
 will have suffered severe damage.  For our
 part, however, we are not convinced that it
 has to be catastrophic damage.
 The basic U.S. Interest in southeast Asia
 is not, or should not be, solely the preserva-
 tion of a non-Communist South Vietnam as
 though it were in a vacuum;  rather, the
 American concern is to keep Red China from
 expanding-insofar as the United States is
 reasonably capable of doing so. If that can-
 not be done with regard to South Vietnam,
 we still must consider the area as a whole.
 In that broader context, failure in Vietnam,
 if it happens, does not automatically doom
 all southeast Asia.  There are other,  and
 maybe more defendable, areas of resistance
 to communism and to Red China in partic-
 ular.  Thailand  is  a large one.                                                                                                                               Malaysia,
 currently more directly menanced by Indo-
 nesia's pro-Communist Sukarno than by
 Peiping, appears to be a firm one.
 The United States does, we believe, have to
 stand firm against Red Chinese imperialism.
 But whether the major stand is taken at
 Thailand, Malaysia, or indeed the Philippines
 or Australia should be determined by the
 cold considerations of a given nation's will
 to fight, terrain, logistics, and all the normal
 military bases for judgment.  If we look only
 at South Vietnam as the be-all and end-all
 of our southeast Asia policy, we risk not only
 profound disappointment but also perhaps
 inadequate thinking and preparation for the
 larger problem.
 To say we might lose in South Vietnam is
 not defeatism but military realism, no matter
 how much it may be hoped that the country
 can somehow be kept out of Communist
 hands.  What must be hoped most of all, in
 our view, is that the officials in Washington
 are paying full attention to Asian strategy
 in the event they cannot hold Vietnam.

 Debate on U.S. Policy on Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. GEORGE McGOVERN
 Or SOUTH DAKOTA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 ~uesday, January 19, 1965
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Mr. President, a
 continuing and in my Judgment, very
 constructive debate,- on U.S. policy on
 Vietnam is underway. Right now, I be-
 lieve, there exists what amounts to a
 deadlock _ between the state of South
 Vietnam, aided to an increasing extent
 by the United States, and the Vietcong
 guerrillas, aided to an increasing extent
 by North Vietnam. It would be difficult,
 and probably impossible, for South Viet-
 namese forces to win a final military vic-
 tory, since there appears to be a grass
 roots cooperation with the Vietcong
 throughout much of the countryside. On
 the other hand, it would be equally dif-
 ficult for the  Communist forces to
 achieve a final. victory over the South
 Vietnamese, with their strong U.S. mili-
 tary backing.  The U.S. forces are un-
 doubtedly able to remain there indefi-
 nitely and to prevent a Communist take-
 over in that manner; yet there is raised
 with increasing frequency the question
 of whether we might achieve basically
 the same results, over the long run, by a
 negotiated settlement which would spare
 the Vietnamese.people the long suffering
 and economic devastation of continued
 warfare.  It would also avoid the con-
 tinued financial drain and loss of life
 now being suffered by the United States.
 Few Americans favor an immediate
 and unqualified pullout.  I believe the
 commitment we have given the leaders
 of South Vietnam and the concern we
 have for. the people there would make it
 impossible for the United States to with-
 draw Immediately. Yet it is not too soon
 to discuss the terms on which a with-
 drawal might ultimately be possible, and
 to assess the long-term requirements for
 the settlement of an issue which is basi-
 cally political, not military. During the
 present struggle, we should not remain
 silent, with bated breath, as it were,
 waiting for a sudden resolution of the
 problem,  which  is  most  unlikely.
 Rather, we should use, here in Congress
 and throughout the country, the exist-

 cies and forms of settlement, so that the
 American people, as well as the adminis-
 tration, will be better equipped to take
 further actipn , at , an opportune time.
 Prolonging the conflict indefinitely could
 only mean continued painful losses for
 both sides.
 In this connection, Mr. President, a
 debate  ver U.S. policy on Vietnam
 was published in the New York Times
 magazine  of _ January  17.  The  de-
 bate was between the Senator from Ore-
 gon  [Mr. MoesE] and Henry Cabot
 Lodge, former Ambassador to South
 Vietnam.  Both points of view-"with-
 draw now" or "fight on to victory"-
 were presented clearly and cogently.  I
 ask unanimous consent that this presen-
 tation be printed in the Appendix fol-
 lowing my remarks, in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 WE  MUST  LEAVE  VIETNAM
 (By WAYNE MORSE)
 Ten years ago the United States embarked
 upon an adventure in South Vietnam that
 was just about 100 years out of date.  While
 Britain, France, and the Netherlands were
 terminating  their rule  over  their Asiatic
 colonies, the United States began trying to
 establish its own beachhead on the Asiatic
 mainland.
 Although present at the Geneva confer-
 ence of  1954, which drew up the accord
 whereby France withdrew from its old colony,
 of Indochina, the United States refused to
 sign the final agreement.  So did one of the
 subdivisions of Indochina, South Vietnam.
 The United States began a heavy program
 of financial and military aid to a new Premier
 in South Vietnam who, we believed, was
 most likely to preserve a Western orienta-
 tion.  When it came time for the 1956 elec-
 tion throughout both North and South Viet-
 nam required by the Geneva accord, we and
 our client in Saigon, Ngo Dinh Diem, realized
 it would be won by Ho Chi Minh's followers
 not only in his own North Vietnam but in the
 South as well.  South Vietnam refused to
 proceed with the election.
 In the last decade we have explained our
 policy as one of helping a free government
 resist  Communist subversion.   But  South
 Vietnam never has had a free government.
 In its 10 years of existence its governments
 have been picked for it by the United States
 and maintained by our heavy doses of eco-
 nomic and military aid.
 The fraudulence of our, claim has been
 starkly exposed by the successve coups in
 Saigon and by the piecing together of one
 government after another by the American
 Embassy.  Leaders suspected of favoring neu-
 tralism or any form of negotiation for settle-
 ment of the civil war are firmly excluded
 from Government ranks.  The major tools
 we have used in manipulating political and
 military leaders have been various threats
 and promises regarding our aid, which now
 hovers around the level of $600 million a
 year in a country of 14 million people.  This
 sum of exclusive of the cost of keeping 23,000
 American "advisers" and large contingents
 of aircraft in the country.
 In fact, our official explanations of why we
 are there now play down the "helping a free
 government" line and play up American secu-
 rity and American prestige as the stakes in
 Vietnam.  At least, the explanations are get-
 ting closer to the truth, which is that the
 United States took over this quarter of In-
 dochina in 1954 when the French pulled out.
 Having  intruded  ourselves  into  Southeast
 Asia, where we never were before, it was this
 country and not the Communists who made
 our prestige in Asia the issue.
 Our Secretary     of State often says that
 "China must leave her neighbors alone." Un-
 der this premise, our officials have vaguely
 threatened to expand the war to North Viet-
 nam and possibly China if we cannot win in
 South Vietnam.  But there are no Chinese
 forces in South Vietnam nor Chinese equip-
 ment in appreciable amount.  Americans are
 still the only foreign troops in South Viet-
 nam.
 Nonetheless, China has the same interest
 in what    goes on  in the subcontinent of
 Southeast Asia as we have in Mexico, Cuba
 and other countries of Latin America.  She
 will increasingly resist having hostile gov-
 ernments on her borders, as do Russia and
 the United States. We recognize and accept
 this principle as regards Russia, but we re-
 fused to recognize it as regards China.
 This has been true even though we have
 watched other Western nations ousted from
 Asia and Africa by rising nationalism.  It
 was inevitable that once China became part
 of this tide she would reassert her interest
 in the governments on her borders.  A re-
 awakened China would assert this interest
 whether she were Communist or not.     The
 more we escalate the Vietnam conflict, the
 more likely China is to intervene directly.
 In South Vietnam we invite China's ap-
 prehension, but more than that, in trying to
 surround China with American bases and
 pro-Western states, we have to buck not only
 communism but  anticolonialism.   One of
 our many mistakes is to equate the two,
 especially when antiwhite feeling is directed
 against the United States.  Advocates of a
 "containment" policy for China, similar to
 that applied to Russia with some success
 in the late 1940's and 1950's, overlook the
 impossibility of maintaining Western strong-
 holds in Asia, no matter what their pur-
 pose.  What we could do in white Europe and
 even the Middle East is not to be imposed
 upon an Asia that is united in at least one
 respect-its determination to see the white
 man sent back to his own shores.
 With our great wealth we can sustain the
 current war effort in Vietnam indefinitely,
 even if it is escalated.  But it will never end,
 because our presence and our selection of
 Saigon's rulers will always inspire rebellion.
 Far from maintaining our prestige in Asia,
 our present policy in Vietnam is eroding it.
 The fact that we are losing despite the steady
 increase in our aid, the addition of 23,000
 American advisers, and complete American
 air domination, has already led several Asian
 nations  to  throw  out an  anchor on the
 Chinese side.   Of the famous dominoes that
 were all supposed to fall to China if we
 failed  to take up  the French  burden  in
 southeast Asia, Burma, and Cambodia have
 already  neutralized  themselves. Pakistan
 has made it clear that the aid she gets from
 us is directed against India and not against
 China.   Japan and India, the largest non-
 Communist nations of Asia, who might be
 expected to be the most helpful to us in
 Vietnam, have  not  associated  themselves
 with what we are doing there.   A few days
 ago India's Premier Shastri urged a new in-
 ternational conference to negotiate a settle-
 ment.                                                                                                                                    He asked the United States not to
 press for a military decision and urged that
 we avoid a major military conflict.
 Of all  the nations  touted as  potential
 Chinese victims,  only  Australia and  the
 Philippines have  offered  tangible help in
 South Vietnam.    The Australian contribu-
 tion amounts to some 66 "advisers" and three

 the principal nations.  These trends and de-
 velopments have in turn strengthened inter-
 national competition in the field of money
 and banking:  they have also created new
 opportunities.
 Within a relatively short span of time,
 U.S. banks have girded themselves to play a
 prominent role in world finance.  With the
 dollar the leading international currency,
 the United States the world's largest exporter
 and importer, and U.S. money and capital
 markets the single most important source
 of financial resources, this has been a nat-
 ural evolution.
 PATTERNS OF BANK LENDING
 American commercial banks- engaging in
 international business extend both short-
 and long-term credits.  According to deft-
 nitions used by official statisticians, short-
 term credits are those with a maturity up
 to 1 year; they are frequently renewed from
 year to year.  Loans beyond 1 year are called
 tern loans.    These term loans have been
 customary in domestic  financing in  the
 United States for a quarter of a century and
 have, since World War II, spread to the field
 of international financing.
 U.S. banks have outstanding short- and
 long-term credits abroad of $9.5 billion. U.S.
 exporters,  importers,  and  industrial and
 commercial firms also grant credits to their
 foreign clients; these amount to $2.3 billion
 at this time,
 Of the short-term bank credits, about $1
 billion are short term, and $3.5 billion are
 largely on behalf of customers.  An addi-
 tional $2.5 billion of the short-term bank

 subject is set out in the December issue of

 COMMERCIAL BANK TERM LOANS  ABROAD
 In the world today, nations are exchanging
 goods in rapidly growing volumes. Our own
 exports have expanded from $15 to $25 bil-
 lion in the past 10 years.  Understandably,
 the remarkable expansion of world trade has
 required growing supplies of credit.
 Commercial banks in the United States
 and other principal trading nations extend
 credits to their foreign correspondents and
 customers.  Indeed, the resources of com-
 mercial banks constitute a pool of private
 international liquidity that is drawn upon
 by creditworthy borrowers in creditworthy
 countries throughout the world.
 Along with direct investment in bricks
 and mortar, commercial bank credit abroad
 has greatly expanded over the pa.t 15 years
 as private U.S. capital has replaced U.S.
 Government aid to Western Europe and
 Japan-aid that had been an essential. in-
 gredient during the `earlier postwar period
 in reinvigorating world commerce.  In re-
 cent years, private financing has received
 further  impetus ?rom -the restoration of
 meaningful currency convertibility among

 credits represent bankers acceptances. After
 a long period. of inactivity, these have grown
 remarkably since 1950, with the encourage-
 ment of the Federal Reserve System; most
 acceptances are made under arrangements
 that involve exports from the United States.
 Loans to foreign banks and customers today
 amount to about $5.7 billion, of which $2.2
 billion are short term, and $3.5 billion are
 term loans.
 THE ANATOMY OF TERM LOANS
 There is general  agreement that short-
 term loans by U.S. banks are indispensable
 as a means of financing U.S. trade and other
 international business that directly benefits
 the U.S. balance of payments.  Sometimes,
 however, the question is raised-particularly
 by those who tend to blame the U.S. balance-
 of-payments deficit on private capital invest-
 ments abroad-whether loans in excess of 1
 year serve purposes beneficial to the U.S.
 balance of payments.  To assure export fi-
 nancing and "normal recurring international
 business," the administration's proposal and
 the House-approved bill for an interest equal-
 ization tax r exempted bank loans made in
 the ordinary course of business as well as
 all  obligations  maturing  within  3  years.
 Before the tax was enacted last September,
 however, a provision was added in the Senate
 giving the President standby authority to
 extend the tax to bank loans with a maturity
 of 1 year or more.
 I The tax and its implications have been
 reviewed in the April and November 1964
 issues of this letter.

 The author of this amendment; Senator
 ALBERT GORE, of Tennessee, stated that it
 seemed a foregone conclusion that the ex-
 emption  of  commercial  bank  term  loans
 would be used to avoid the tax and char-
 acterized it as an important loophole.    In
 his testimony before the Senate Finance
 Committee last June, Secretary of the Treas-
 ury Douglas Dillon pointed out that the
 rise in long-term bank loans had started be-
 fore,there was any thought of the tax and
 that, in the light of detailed information
 made available to the Treasury, any possible
 evasion of the tax through use of bank loans'
 could not be more than
 total bank loans."
 Changes in direction of the flow of loans
 to  less-developed  and developed countries
 have been remarkably similar to the changes
 in patterns of direct investment.  Until 2
 or 3 years ago, the direction of the flows
 had  been   mainly   to  Latin  America  and
 Canada.  In recent years, most of the term
 loans have gone to Europe, particularly to
 Italy during late 1963 and early 1984, and to
 Japan.   The shifts in the geographic dis-
 tribution are summed up in the second table.
 Over the past year, changes in bank credits
 abroad, short as well as long-term, have been
 particularly  influenced  by  borrowings  by
 Japan.  These have grown substantially to
 support the expanding volume of Japanese
 Trade  and    business  activity. In  recent
 months, the rate of bank lending to Japan.
 has slowed down.  As noted in these pages
 last   month, Japan     has   floated sizable
 amounts of bonds in European markets.
 A HELPFUL rNNOVATION

 tions is an adaptation of techniques devel-
 oped in the United States for domestic lend-
 ing.  As is well known, term loans in the
