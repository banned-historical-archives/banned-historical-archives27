Secrecy in government, either to 
protect, bureaucratic bumbli.ig or for 
legitimdte protection of vital- national 
defense and foreign policy documents, 
? is an issue that will not go away. The 
balance between an informed public 
and government censorship is not easy 
to strike. 
:One of the latest proposals comes 
from Rep. William S. Moorhead, Pen-
nsylvania Democrat, who introduced 
legislation intended to give "top se-
cret" documents only three years to 
live outside of public scrutiny. He 
claims that President Nixon's directive 
? revamping the security system is 
"unworkable, unmanageable and filled 
'Will technical defeats and massive 
loopholes." The bill would create a 
nine-member independent regulatory 
body and give it extensive power over 
the security classifying system of the 
executive branch. Top-secret stamps 
I. 
would go only to top officials in the 
White House, State Department, Pen-
tagon, Central Inteljj,gence A4,gency and 
AtomicTiTeity Commission. 
The only exemption would be pro-
vided for highly sensitive national de-
fense' data, such as codes and in-
telligence sources. They could be hid-
den only when invoked by a president 
or top official, and even this would 
need approval of the new commission. 
As with all good endeavors in this 
field, there is no reason to believe that 
it will be much more successful than 
previous attempts. The first obstacle 
is the imperfectability of human judg-
ment. What should be secret to one 
may not even be classified a s 
restricted by another. The temptation 
to hide one's errors of ()Mission or 
commission is well-nigh irresistible. 
Once set in motion, a classification 
system seems to,develop a life or its

Million or more documents in the 
Pentagon, for instance, would require 
a substantial army of intelligen. men 
of mature judgment, working in shifts 
around the clock for many, many years. 
The best hope of these reform efforts 
is that it will make officials hesitate 
to classify indiscriminately. The final 
holie is that good common sense will 
be applied to the Issue of security

of vain, egotistical men of little minds:

Fulbright: No time for relies 
Amodest little pamphlet put out by 
'the U.S. Information Agency ten 
years ago said that USIA "tells America's 
story abroad." How simple it seemed: 
Uncle Sam reciting "Once upon a time 
in 1776 ..." to an underdeveloped na-
tion on his knee. It's a different story to-
day, as our propaganda machine tries to 
find the right words and the right tone 
of voice. for a period in which the nation 
is simultaneously at Nvar, at peace and at 
odds with itself. 
. In Washington last week, USIA won 
approval of its new budget at the cur-
rent $200 million level, but only after 
the Senate restored cuts made in com-
mittee that would have reduced the 
agency's film and print activities and all 
but :dismantled the Voice of America. 
The authorization squabble grew out of 
continuing rivalry-between Congress and 
the White House .over foreign affairs, 
and a running feud .between USIA di-
rector Frank Shakespeare, a conservative 
former network executive who helped? 
design President Nixon's TV image in 
the 1968 campaign, and Sen. J. William 
Fulbright, chairman of the 'Foreign Re-
lations Committee and a critic of USIA 
since its inception . in 1953. While the 
showdown vote was an Administration 
.victory, it did nothing to clarify such 
questions as bow good or bad our propa-
ganda actually is today, how it should 
? change or evolve in the 1970s, and 
whether Americans should be able to 
see and hear it themselves. 
Theoretically, the law protects the 
American public from being propagan-
dized at its own expense by forbidding 
USIA to show its wires on the home 
front. Exceptions have been made in re-
cent years, however, and last month, 
despite objections by Senator Fulbright 
and others, Sen. James Buckley, the 
conservative New York Republican, 
showed a USIA propaganda film about 
Czechoslovakia on his TV show. After the 
broadcast, Fulbright's committee passed 
a measure that would reaffirm and clad- B 3TOM HOMETE: ?

or ears on the stuff for which they're 
paying $200 million a year. 
What do we really tell our friends 
and enemies abroad? What effect does 
it have? "Czechoslovakia: 1968," the 
Academy Award-winning short that 
kicked up the fuss on the Buckley show, 
is an efficient and particularly repellent 
piece of goods. Starting with sweetly 
pastoral (and occasionally fake) shots 
from 1918 and ending with the Soviet 
invasion of 1968, it reduces 50 .years of 
history to thirteen minutes of short takes 
and shrewd juxtapositions. that Make 
strong appeals to the emotions, and some-
times misrepresent history. Newsreel 
clips of' the Soviet Army's liberation of 
Prague from the Nazis in 1945 are inter-
cut with those. of Hitler's occupation, 
suggesting one was as bad as the other 
when, in fact, Czech Communists and 
non-Communists alike greeted the Sovi-
ets with open arms. The film has no nar-

Czech for "freedom." The same style is

The National Security Coun-
cil is proposing tougher regu-
lations to keep classified infor-
mation out of the hands of un-
authorized government offi-
cials, defense contractors and 
the public. 
It suggests that President 
Nixon may want to go as far 
as seeking legislation similar 
to the British Official Secrets 
Act, which wculd have the ef-
feet of imposing stiff criminal 
penalties on anyone who re-
ceives classified information, 
as well as on those who dis-
close it. 
The recommendations are 
? 'contained in the draft revision 
of the executive order that has 
governed the security classifi-
cation system since 1953. 
the Departments
draft was submitted to 
? e Departments of State, De-
fense and Justice, the Central 
? Intelligence Agency and the 
( Atomic Energy Commission 
last month for their com-
ments. A copy was obtained by 
The Washington Post yester-
day. 
? After suggestions have come 
,back from those agencies, a re-
vised 'draft. is expected to be 
.sent to the President for ap-
'proval on his return from 
China. 
The National Security Coun-
cil draft is the result of a 
year's work by a special inter-
agency committee headed by 
. William H. Rehnquist, for-
merly an assistant attorney 
general and now a Justice of 
the Supreme Court. 
. National Security Council 
sources said yesterday that 
Rehnquist's contributions to 
the revision were "very impor-
tant.. . . 's. ,He did yeoman 
work." 
Rehnquist resigned from the 
Inter-agency' committee when 
he was sworn in as a member 
of the high court last month, 
and he has not been replaced.

form, 'the NSC draft would

the national well-being.

was used in the Previous regu-

cation of information.

sification said yesterday that 
national security is generally

which permits the classifica-

The NSC draft also provides 
for classification of anything 
whose "unauthorized* disclo-

condition than was previously' 
imposed. 
The preamble to the draft 
states that "it is essential tha-', 
the citizens of the United 
States be informed to the 
maximum extent possible con-
cerning the activities of their 
government," but adds that it 
is "equally essential for their 
government to protect certain 
official information against 
unauthorized disclosure." 
The draft, says the NSC, is 
intended "to provide for a just 
resolution of the conflict be-
tween these two essential na-

WASHINGTON, Jan. 3?Pres-
ident Nixon was "furious" with 
his subordinates during the re-
cent India-Pakistan war for not 
taking a stronger stand against 
India, the syndicated colum-
nist Jack Anderson reported 
today. 
Mr. Anderson quoted Henry 
A. Kissinger, the President's ad? 
visor on national security, as. 
having told a meeting of seniot 
Administration officials: "Pre 
getting hell every half-hour 
from the President that we are 
not being tough enough on In-

According to Mr. Anderson 
Mr. Kissinger directed that al: 
United States officials "show a 
certain coolness" to the Indians. 
"The Indian Ambassador is not 
to be treated at too high a 
level," he is quoted as having 
said. 
The quotations in Mr. An-
derson's column today were the 
latest in a series of verbatim 
reports of secret White House 
strategy sessions dealing with 
the crisis that the columnist has. 
published during the last several 
days. 
His column is syndicated to

The publication of the re-
ports, which Mr. Anderson says 
are classified "secret sensitive," 
has infuriated the White House 
and unsettled national security: 
officials. 
? Government sources con-
firmed today that an investiga-
tion had been started by the 
White House to determine who 
leaked the classified documents. 
-The sources said the new in-
vestigation, reportedly being 
conducted by the Federal Bu-

at individuals in the State and 
Defense Departments, and on 
the National Security Council 
staff who have had access to

the columnist are not official

rather notes prepared by repre-

The notes he has published 
so far, the columnist said, are 
from those taken for the. De-

signed by two Pentagon offi-
cials.. . . 
Mr. Anderson said he had 
received scores of other classi-
fied documents, including se-
cret intelligence reports and 
cablegrams, that he intended to 
publish during she next two 
weeks. 
"1 am trying to force a show-

Mr. Anderson said neither 
he nor members of his staff had 
vet been questioned by Gov-
ernment investigators, but that 
he had "positive" information 
that the F.B.I. had already in-
terrogated individuals at the 
White House and State and De-
fense departments in an effort 
to discover who had provided 
him with the documents. 
Aide Declines Comment 
Gerald L. Warren, the acting 
Press Secretary at the White 
House, declined today to say 
whether an investigation had 
been ordered. He also declined 
all comment on the Anderson 
columns. 
In the column published to-
day, Mr. Anderson quotes from 
notes taken during the. Wash-
ington Special Action Group's 
meetings of Dec. 3, Dec. 4 'and 
Dec. 8. 
In the first session, he quotes 
Richard Helms, director of Cen-
tral Intelligence, as saying the 
Indians were "currently en-
gaged in a no-holds-barred at-
tack on East Pakistan and that 
they had crossed the border 
on all sides." 
"Dr. Kissinger remarked that 
if the Indians have announced 
a full-scale invasion," the col-
umn continues, "this fact must 
be reflected in our U.N. state-
ment." 
On Dec. 4, Mr. Kissinger is 
quoted as having said, "On AID

In late November the Central Intel-
ligence Agency conducted a series of 
"senior seminars" so that some of its 
important bureaucrats could consider 
its public image. I was invited to 
attend one session and to give my 
views on the proper role of the 
Agency. I suggested that its legitimate 
activities were limited to studying 
newspapers and published statistics, 
listening to the radio, thinking about 
the world, interpreting data of recon-
naissance satellites, and occasionally 
publishing the names of foreign spies. I 
? had been led by conversations with a 
number of CIA officials to believe that 
they Were thinking along the same 
lines. One CIA man after another 
? eagerly joined the discussion to assure 
me that the days of the flamboyant 
covert operations were over. The 
upper-class amateurs of the OSS who 
stayed to mastermind operations in 
'Guatemala, Iran, the Congo, and else-
where?Allen Dulles, Kermit Roosevelt, 
Richard Bissell, Tracy Barnes, Robert 
Amory, Desmond Fitzgerald?had died 
or departed. 
In their place, I was assured, was a 
small army of professionals devoted to 
preparing intelligence "estimates" for 
the President and collecting informa-
tion the clean, modern way, mostly 
with sensors, computers, and sophis-
ticated reconnaissance devices. Even 
Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot, would now 
be as much a museum piece as Mata 
?Hari. (There are about 18,000 em-
ployees in the CIA and 200,000 in the 
entire "intelligence community" itself. 
The cost of maintaining them is some-
where between $5 billion and S6 
billion annually. The employment 
figures do not include foreign agents or 
mercenaries, such as the CIA's 100,000-
man hired army in Laos.) 
A week after my visit to the "senior 
se inar" Newsweek ran a long story 
n "the new espionage" with a picture 
of CIA Director Richard Helms on the 
' '? Ope

spread confusion about its own work. 
The world of Richard Helms and his 
"specialists" does indeed differ .from 
that of Allen Dulles. Intelligence organ-
izations, in spite of their predilection 
for what English judges used to call 
"frolics of their own," are servants of 
policy. When policy changes, they 
must eventually changd too, although 
because of the atmosphere of secrecy 
and deception in which they operate, 
such changes are exceptionally hard to 
control. To understand the "new 
espionage" one must see it as ipart of 
the Nixon Doctrine which, in. essence, 
is a global strategy for maintaining US 
power and influence without overtly 
involving the nation in another ground He,

But we cannot comprehend recent tigE 
developments in the "intelligence corn- nel 
munity" without understanding what fur 
Mr. Helms and his employees actually Prc 
do. In a speech before the National ny 
Press Club, the director discouraged/w 
journalists from making the attempt. d( 
"You've just got to trust us. We are 
honorable men." The same speech is 
made each year to the small but 
growing number of senators who want 
a closer check on the CIA. In asking, 
on November 10, for a "Select Com-
mittee on the Coordination of United

activities of the Central Intelligence 
Agency," Senator Stuart Symington 
noted that "the .subcommittee having 
oversight of the Central Intelligence 
Agency has not met once this year." 
Symington, a former Secretary of

It has been a joyful occasion, the 
, 40. 
S 
teau of Lynn and Mary Ann Harbert 
of California. 
As thankful as everybody is, how-
ever, let there be no outpouring of gra-
titude toward the People's Republic. 
Mr. Fecteau, it should be noted, ser-
ved 19 years of a 20-year term, and 
Miss Harbert was Imprisoned for 
three years on as yet no known charge. 
Indeeil, were it not that other Amer-
icans are in the People's Republic's 
custody, an inquiry should be insti-
tuted on what happened to Miss Har-
bert's sailing companion. The fact that 
he still was being "questioned" more 
Than a year after his arrest by the 
Chinese, and thereafter allegedly 
committed suicide, suggests he was 
receiving anything but normal treat-
ment. 
The other regrettable aspect of 
these developments is that the United 
States apparently is caught in the 
;unfortunate position of having main-
tained throughout the years of Fec-
teau's imprisonment that he was not 
,engaged in espionage when ap-
prehended, whereas his former wife 
!now flatly states the Chinese were 
"not lying"1 when they charged he 
? vas. 
'Persons who volunteer for Central 
ung up 
Intelligence Agency employment must 
agree, it is to be presumed, that if 
their cover is exposed they cannot 
expect their government to irnmedi- ' 
ately admit they were spies and beg 
for consideration. It rrfight even in-
vite harsher punishment, in fact, to 
do so. 
' 
But it does seem that in these many 
years, the CIA or the State Depart-
ment would have found some method 
of getting out from under the apparent 
false disavowal on Fecteau. Perhaps 
some effort was made. If so, the facts 
should be reported?the CIA couldn't 
lose any more face than it has over, 
this case. 
The Soviet Union initially denied 
that the late Rudolph Abel was th 
espionage work. But once he was im-
prisoned here, Moscow made such a . 
mighty effort to obtain his release, 
exchanging for him the prisoner of 
prisoners, U-2 pilot Gary Powers, sym-
bol of years of Soviet frustration, that ., 
it was tantamount to admitting Abel's 
spy role. The Soviet escaped a little 
more gracefully than President Eisen-
hower, who first lied about Powers'? 
duties. . . 
Espionage is always a heroic occupl-
tion, but as a business between nations 
it would be less Sordid if some method 
could be found to avoid the lie when, 
it is uncovered.

WASHINGTON ? President Nixon's 
'aides have begun weighing the pros and cons 
or an unusual scheme to gain freedom at last 
Ycir imprisoned American John T. Downey. 
41. by providing a "face-saving" formula for 
Chinese Communist leaders. 
Under the plan President Nixon. during 
his Feb. 21-28 visit to mainland China: 
would propose to the Chinese leaders that 
Downey. of New Britain ,c7cAagled 
into the President's personal custody. 
ordrittir.vIN'ix on would concede that when 
Downey was captured during the Korean 
war in November 1952. Downey was in fact 
working for the Central Ilitelliqence t_l&wcy 
(CIA). as the ChinesZ ITS'Ye insistMTraiong. 
That would represent the "face-saving" part 
'of the formula. 
Administration officials maintained a 
closed-mouth attitude Tuesday about the 
Downey case and the cases of two other 
Americans known to be languishing in 
Chinese prisons. They saw some ray of hope. 
,however, for the release of the trio. 
. 
On Monday. the Chinese Communists 
'surprised the world by releasing Richard 
Fecteau. 44. of Lynn. Mass.. and Mary Ann 
Habert of Menlo Park. Calif.. as a gesture to 
improve the atmosphere in advance of 
'President Nixon's visit. 
? At the same time, they commuted the life 
sentence of Downey to five years. 
All of this was an outgrowth of National 
.Security Adviser Henry A. Kissinger's 
'recent discussions with Chinese Premier 
Chou En-lai to lay the groundwork for the 
President's forthcoming Peking talks.. 
The arrangements provide for -free-
wheeling" discussions among the President, 
'Premier Chou and Communist party 
Chairman Mao Tse-Tung. 
This would seem to leave room to bring 
up the Downey case, and that of two 
_ 
servicemen also remaining in Red Chinese 
Captivity ? Air Force Capt. Philip E. Smith 
and ,Navy Lt. Robert Flynn. 
The White House and the State 
Department have been urged to use the 
.'face-saving" formula by Downey's 
relatives and friends. including Sean 
Downey of McLean. Va., and the prisoner's 
old Yale classmate, Jerome A. Cohen, now a 
faculty member at Harvard Law School. 
"I have aruged that the question of whose 
face is saved iAippirtaReel infikrttlaele 
r., 
eme r? 
'5 redti 
saving a life," Sean Downey Said in' a 
telephone interview. "I have received some 
encouragement from the White House. 
"The State Department's reaction has 
been more conservative. The word you get 
there is that the situation is very delicate 
and they don't want to rock the boat. 
-This is really a tragic situation. John 
Downey was an honor graduate from Yale 
in 1952. He was a football player and a 
wrestling champion ? a young man of great 
promise ? yet he has hardly enjoyed a year 
of adult life." 
Downey and Fecteau were captured 19 
years ago. At the time. American officials 
identified them as civilian employes of the 
U.S. Army whose aircraft disappeared on a 
flight from South Korea to Japan. . 
'The Chinese Communists insisted 
Downey and Fecteau actually were CIA 
agents who were attempting to set up 
guerrilla bases in northeast China. 
As long ago as last summer. Cohen 
proposed the United States admit Downey 
and Fecteau were spies in an effort to 
secure their freedom, 
The question arises?whether the face of 
the United States government is involved. 
The State Department is sticking to its story 
that the Chinese Communist charges against 
Downey and Fecteau were trumped up. 
But Fecteau's divorced wife, Margaret 
Fecteau, held a news conference at hem 
Lynn home Tuesday and was quoted bl 
several Boston area newspapers as saying 
"The Chinese haven't been lying" about thE 
spying charge. Later, however, she denied 
having made that comment. 
Sean Downey, a business consultant wh( 
also does consulting work with the Justice 
Department on community relations, had no 
patience with the State Department's public 
attitude. 
"What harm can be done now in: 
, admitting whatever mission John was on?" 
Sean Downey asked. "You just about have 
to assume he had some link with the CIA.'" 
What does the phrase 'civilian employe of 
the U.S. Army' mean if it doesn't mean.. 
something like that?'.' 
The two Downey cousins are almost the 
same age and have always been par-
ticularly. close. From 1941 to 1947, they 
lived just two doors away from each other in 
Wallingford. Conn. ,

Red China's 22-man United Nations delegation 
received a.tumultuous reception upon its arrival. in 
New York, last week, with the press seeming to tum-
ble over itself with compliments for the "high qual-
ity" of Mao's diplomatic representatives. But even 
as the new delegation was being hailed, by various 
groups in this Country, evidence is accumulating that 
Red China intends to employ the U.N.- as a major

Once during, Il\c conversation his hands seemed to' absfird. with tae proble.rns 
shake. He 'was lis.hting his second or third cigarette, 
rather a 15t for 1i.12 short time he had been talking. The 
Dervous edge vt,zs' peculiar ? it didn't jibe with ?the kind 
of image Victor Torchetti had painted of himself. 
A real-life sp,) who came in from the cold, 'Marchetti as a 
14-year veteran of the Central Intelligence AgencY who 
has just autta.srod a book called "The Rope Dancer." The 
Dovel purports to show spicinage work for what it really 
is, as Marchr-Dt experienced it. What he described, while 
dressing last Th es:.lay morning, is hardly nerve-fraying, 
"Not all spies are dashing, handsome, debonair," he said 
with anti-Jae/las Bond certainty. "The average stay is 
married and lives in the suburbs, belongs to the PTA, or 
is a scoutin star." Marchetti was all of those things, and 
' he indicated that his job was equally unextraordinary. 
1 WD.I\ KED. OUT of Washington, was _permanently 
.2s-signori; to. heaclex;a:ters, and occasionally went on over-
seas assigamenits. For example, years ago we were inter-
ested in Sevlet -rtillinary aid, ?so I might go to -Indonesia for 
:as lone' as ten week, to try to got a better handle on what 
the Soviets dere up to." , 
. But most -of the time, the ex-agent stressed, he was 
eng-afied in collating and interpretinj vast ? supplies of 
informaon cOming in from sources all over the globe. It 
;as painstaking, arduous work, bureaucratic tedium that 
.diffeVe i from corporate tedium only in that it dealt with. 
rational security instead of marketingstrategy. 
"The bulk of the information acquired today is through 
satellites, overhead sensors, and electronic sensors,- Mar-
Chetti said., again subverting We martini-mistress - mys-
tique that , permeates espioriage? literature. He added that 
much additional information comes through diplomatic 
and. official channels, with newspapers and magazines 
providing most of the remainder.- - . 
. 
FIDGETING RESTLESSLY, the aspiring writer smiled, 
and partially amended his de-r'ornantich?oil -heresy." 
? "Maybe 10 per cent- of all the people engaged L. 
spionage work are back alley spies. But of these, 10 out 
of 20 are faking it under the cover of diplomacy. They try 
to acquire local agents in the country where . they're 
working." ' . .. 
To the. disillusionment of spy-novel afficionados every-
where, . however, Marchetti emphasized that there are . 
very,' very few agents living overseas witliout cover, and - 
. that their contribution is of marginal value. "It's kind of 
like fishing ? you throw them out and sooner Or later 
" you get a strike." . 
- No clue to the speaker's own unease emerged as he 
I discussed. hit; idea for the book. "I was just sitting around 
- talidng :Vitli another agent. We were saying that things in ? 
the agency were so screwed up that it wouldn't he 
. surprising to_ _find . that a :Russian was running .. it. We 
. _ ._... . . _ . 
kill. We're like two guys standing across the 
each other with triggers on mortars, cannons, 
We don't need it," he said, 10:oping his tie. ' 
? .ii0" 
IN ABS VIEW, the sam'e kind Of thinking that lel to 
the arms buildup is reflected in the structure of the 
modernCIA."It's too big, tdo costly, with too much military ? 
influence." Marchetti says ,the quality of the agency sSTATIN-
product ? good data ? has been diluted accordingly. 
We need more control fforn within .the organization, and. 
street from 
and rockets. 
More directly from the outside." ? 
Separately, Marchetti condemns the "cold war Mentali-
ty" that colors much' of the CIA's thinking,' and translates 
to poor estimates of the international situation. "Cuba is 
the perfect example," he said eagerly, recounting the: 
misguided thinking that led the U.S. to back 'Battista 
against,. Castro under the mistaken assumption that most 
Cubans also were anti-Castro. 
Then, he says, when' Castro won after all, the U.S.. 
labeled him a. -Marxist and forced him into. Russia's, 
? embrace. "That's what's wrong with -Vie.,trio.m and Laos 
today," Marchetti continues, "we're 'trying to support 
? governMents not representative of the people." 
ALMOST TO THE end of his reasons for resigning from 
the -CIA, the cheerful novelist finished dressifIg. nnei 
readied himself to face anew the rigorous publicity tour. 
And still he eluded any indication of 'why he seemed 
slightly ecla. 
'I disliked the' clandestine' atmosphere onen finds in aa - 
organization like the CIA," he said, finalizing the list.. 
:`What Lathers me most is when some guys got restlessin 
. the CIA and military intelligence a few years ago. With . 
' groups like the SOS, the Black Panthers, mil with civil 
unrest in' general, people in the ClA began to wouder 
what they should do about it." 
Drawing on yet another cifcarette. Mnichetti expiained 
.? ----
.that such internal disorders are -pror.,,erly the co 
the FBI or the army, not the GIA. Neverth 
vociferous minority of the agents ? the "specks' . 
?ti. calls them ? began to say, "1,ife're the enp.t, 
should do the work." 
--Meant it as a joke, of course, but that's where the book-
? began." ? ' 
WITH THE PUBLICATION of "The none Dancer," 
Marchetti terminated a long,' distinguished career with the 
CIA. He was assistant to the director of the entire agency 
I when he resigned,- and prospects, for the future were 
good. So why did he quit? 
"I'd lost a great deal of faith in the agency and its 
policies. If I couldn't believe in it, I couldn't serve it," he 
said sounding more like a Campus politician than a 
haf?dbitten "spy." In truth, Marchetti left for a variety of 
reasons, some of them intriguing for the insights they 
lend to the arcane workings of the CIA. 0119- ittilitAt* 491f0i100010.0061-161? 
THIS RATIONALE could lead to, trouble at hbrn

That bombshell out of Great 
Britain about the expulsion of 
405 Soviet diplomats and offi-
cials for spying has had one 
predictable effect. 
'It. has revived editorial corn-
/ ment and ?. cocktail chatter 
about. our owinCentral Intern- ' 
gence. Agency and the "coV-
ers" it nses for spies. And it 
' has aroused new spasms of 
naive (namel-it to the effect 
that our country ought to get 
out of the cloalt-and-dagger 
.business. -? 
Well, just as sure as Mata 
?llari was a woman, the expul-
sions will not halt massive So-
viet spying in Britain -- or in 
the United States,, atthe Unit-
ed Nations or anyplace else. 
- Some Americans just can't 
.get over the sanctimonious ?o-
lion that spying is a dirty busi-
ness that, like dandruff, we 
can wash right out of our hair. 
Some spying is a sordid, 
-dangerous . business. It in-
volves blackmail, sexual en-
trapment, peepin tomism, 
double-crosses, political and 
character assassinations 
and outright mur&r, 
Yet, spying is not nearly as 
bad as are some of the. alter-
natives to having a good sys-
tem of intelligence. Not many 
Americans. would accept yid, 
herability to a sneak aucleai: 
attack as the price for getting 
rid of spies. 
The .fact is that if we are to 
move closer to peace we are 
likely to go through a period of 
more spying rather than less. 
- - Millions of sensitive, intelli-
gent 'Americans deplore the 
fact that in the decade of the 
3.060s the United :States and 
8oviet. Union poured a trillion 
..dollars into arms. -These 
Americans know that we shall 
never rescue our cities or save 
man's environment or find a 
cure for -cancer unless we can 
slop the arms race and its 
miid waste of wealth.. 
)--flit the glaring truth is that 
distrust stands in the way of a 
curtailment in the manufac-
ture of horrible weapons, not 
to mention the .destruction of 
those already .in arsenals. 
Steps toward disarmament 
will. proceed only as rapidly as 
intelligence procedures make 
it possible for rival countries 
to be reasonably sure that 
they will not be destroyed by 
the perfidy of a potential ex't.,?-
my. 
As far ahead as man can 
see, the United States and the 
Soviet Union will launch so-
phisticated satellites whose 
fantastic cameras will record 
troop movements, missile em-
placements, production cen-
ters for fissionable materials, 
weapons storage. areas and 
other N,ital inforMation bear-
ing on the other country's (or 
China's) intentions. 
It is taken for granted by 
American officials that the So-
viet Union will 'keep 30 or so 
trawlers operating off the 
shores of the United States, 
their powerful, sensitive clec-
tronic gear intercepting U.S. 
diplomatic and military mes-? 
? sages, picking up conversa-
tion .'at U.S. airfields and bas-

Star Staff Writer 
' Early in1 ..63 a group includ-
ing former officials of the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency and the 
State Department soiled down 
after dinner at the Harold Pratt 
House, on New York's Avenue, 
to discuss some of the CIA's 
problems. 
A record of heir conversa-
tion shows that the particular 
?concern of the group that night 
was how to provide a deeper 
cover- for Americans gathering 
information by using non-
governmental organizations as 
fronts.

A record of the discussion at 
the council's headquarters on 
that evening, Jan. 8, 1968,' has 
been circulated to some newspa-
pers by a gtoqp of self-styled 
radicai scholars based in Cam-
bridge. 
It portrays with some new de-
' tails, the structure and the style 
of the American intelligence 
community. The document is 
?'timely in the wake of events last? 
weekin London, where 105 
memb-
ers of the Soviet commu-
nity there, including employes 
Irons the Soviet embassy, trade 
delegation, tourist agency, Mos-
cow Narodny Bank and Aeroflot 
Airline were uncovered as esp16-
nage agents, and banned from 
. the country without replace-
ments. . . . 
- -? ? It was- a 'fear of just such an 
incident, apparently, that domi-
nated the conversation at Pratt 
house that night.

agents '"need to operate under 
deeper cover." 
Bissel recounted ruefully the 
uproar over the CIA's exposed 
funding of the National Student 
Association's overseas a.ctilvities 
and said, "The CIA interface 
with various private groups; inn-
eluding business and student 
groups, must be remedied." 
He noted that the problems of 
American spies overseas "is fre-
quently a problem of the State 
Department." 
"It tends to be true that local 
allies find themselves deiding al-
ways with an American and an 
of I i .c i a I American?since the 
cover is almost. invariably as a 
U.S. government employe," 131s-
ml is reported to have said. 
'? `There are powerful reasons 
for this practice, and it will al-
Ways be desirable to have some 
CIA personnel housed in the em-
bassy compqund, if only for lo-
cal 'command post' and commu-
nications requirements. 
"Nonetheless, it is possible 
? and desirable,, although difficult 
and time-consumirog, to build 
overseas an apparatus of unoffi-
cia). cover," Bissel is quoted as 
"This would require the use or. 
? creation of private organiza-
tions many of the personnel of 
which would be non-U.S. nation-
als, with freer entry into the 
local society and less implica-
tion for the official U.S. pos-
ture." 
Use Non-Americans 
Bissel said that the United 
States needed to increase its use 
of non-Americans for espionage 
"with an effort at indoctrination 
and training: they should be en-
couraged to develop a second 
loyalty, more or less compara-
ble to that of the American 
staff.". 
He added that as intelligence 
efforts -shifted more toward Lat-
in America,. Asia and Africa, 
"the conduct of U.S. nationals is 
hassles, trade delegations, and - .likely to be increasingly circum-
other U.S. agencies in countries !scribed. The primary change

es." 
An unidentified former State 
Department official -responded 
to Bisset that he agreed -with the 
need to change coves, noting 
that "the initial agreement be-
tween the agency and State was 
intended to be 'temporary'' but 
nothing endures like the ephem-
eral." 
Another: participant noted that 
very little attention was paid to 
revelations of the CIA's use of 
supposedly. independent opera-
lions such as "Radio Free Eu-
rope." he added, "One might 
conclude that the public is not 
likely to be concerned by tha 
penetration of overseas ?iaatitu-
tions; at least not nearly so 
much as by the penetration of 
U.S. institutions." 
This participant was quoted as? 
saying, "The ? publia. doesn't 
think it's right:they don't know 
where it ends; they take a look 
at etheir neighbors." Then he 
asked whether "this suggested 
expansion in use of private insti-
tutions should include those in 
the United States, Or U.S. insti-
tutions operating overseas?" 
In response, clear distinctions' 
were reportedly made between - 
operating in the United States 
.and abroad, and the suggestion 
was made by bissell, "One 
might want CIA to expand its 
use of private U.S. corporations, 
but for objectives outside file 
United States."

There also was a diligent rerao-.

the like, with one, noticeable 
lapse. 
In a discussion of the effect of

who have journeyed back and
