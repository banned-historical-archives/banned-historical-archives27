ISRAEL: Palestinian Glider Attack 
Israel will hold Syria responsible for Wednesday night's daring 
suicide hang glider attack, claimed by the pro-Syrian Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, in which 
six Israeli soldiers were killed and at least seven others were 
wounded. 
The PFLP-GC operates several training camps in Syria and Lebanon, 
and air training takes place at the Mayda'a camp, east of Damascus. 
Hang aliders were first spotted at Mavda'a in August 1986. 25X1

In claiming responsibility for the attack, the Damascus-based 
PFLP-GC said the operation was dedicated to Ariel Sharon, whom 
they charged with responsibility for an attack more than 30  years ago 
against the Palestinian village of Qibya in northern Galilee. 
Comment: The attack almost certainly could not have been carried 
out without prior Syrian knowledge. The decision by the PFLP-GC, 
however, to attack the military outpost rather than more vulnerable 
civilian targets in Qiryat Shemona may reflect Syrian efforts to 
distinguish between acts of terrorism, which Damascus claims it 
opposes, and acts of national liberation, which it supports. Given 
Syrian efforts to distance itself from acts of international terrorism, 
Damascus is unlikely to sanction attacks against civilian targets by 
groups with which it is so closely identified. 
Israeli retaliation most likely will be directed at PFLP-GC locations in 
Lebanon. The PFLP-GC maintains its Lebanese headquarters at the 
Tanayil camp, south of Shtawrah, and its southern command 
operates from the Mukhayyam Ayn al Hulwah refugee camp, near 
Sidon. Although less likely, Israel may strike Palestinian targets inside 
Syria, given the dramatic nature of the attack and the number of 
Israeli casualties.

Turkey's Political Parties 
Motherland Party (ANAP)? led by Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, ANAP was formed in 1983. A 
center-right party promoting free market economic reforms, ANAP comprises three principal 
factions representing parties before the coup: moderate conservatives from the Justice Party, 
religious conservatives from the National Salvation Party, nationalists from the National 
Action Party. 
Correct Way Party (DYP)? led by former Prime Minister and Justice Party chairman 
Suleyman Demirel, DYP is Motherland's chief competitor on the center right. It is composed 
principally of former Justice Party members. 
Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP)? led by Erdal Inonu, this party is an amalgam of the 
Populist Party, which ran in 1983, and the Social Democratic Party, which failed to gain the 
military's approval to contest that election. A center-left grouping, SHP is made up primarily 
of adherents of the former Republican Peoples Party (RPP), which was founded by Ataturk 
and led for more than two decades by Ismet Inonu, Erdal's father. 
Democratic Left Party (DLP)? led by former Prime Minister and Republican People's Party 
chairman Bulent Ecevit. In fact, it was Ecevit who displaced the elder Inonu and gave the 
Republican People's Party its leftward tile after 1973. DLP is also a center-left party but has 
failed to attract many former RPP members, largely because of Ecevit's refusal to relinquish 
any control over the party's program and policies. 
Other Minor Parties? three other parties are contesting this election: Nationalist Labor 
Party, Reformist Democracy Party, Prosperity Party; but none is given a chance of winning 
the 10 percent of the vote necessary to enter parliament. The most familiar of these is 
Prosperity, a reincarnation of the Islamic fundamentalist National Salvation Party. It is led by 
Necmettin Erbakan, who was reinstated with Demirel and Ecevit when the political bans were 
lifted in September.

TURKEY: Election Preview 
Prime Minister Ozal's Motherland Party is a heavy favorite to 
retain its parliamentary majority when Turks vote Sunday in their 
country's most open election since the military coup in 1980, 
Comment: Ozal will probably keep, and possibly strengthen, his 
majority in the National Assembly. All recent polls put his party well 
within reach of the approximately 40 percent of the vote needed to 
win a majority in Turkey's weighted proportional system. Election laws 
passed in September and last month work in the government's favor 
by limiting the parties' access to the media and by creating 46 bonus 
seats, which are likely to go to Motherland. Indeed, Ozal is so far 
ahead in the polls that attention has shifted to his health problems 
and to whether his party will win the two-thirds majority needed to 
push through constitutional changes Ozal has hinted at. 
Polls now put the center-left Social Democratic Populist Party of 
Erdal Inonu a distant second, 20 to 30 percentage points behind 
Motherland. Most observers had expected former Prime Minister 
Demirel's center-right Correct Way Party to be a strong contender, 
but the party has had 
financing difficulties and poor morale and organization. Four other 
parties, including the Democratic Left Party of former Prime Minister 
Ecevit, are not expected to gain the 10 percent of the vote necessary 
to enter parliament 
There is a small chance that Ozal's party could fall just short of a 
majority. Polling remains an imprecise science in Turkey, and rural 
areas?where much of the opposition's strength lies?are 
undersampled. Moreover, some 2 million disenfranchised voters, 
whom few ex ect will support Ozal, regained the eligibility to vote this 
month 
Should no party receive a majority, Turkey could again fall into the 
divisive and ineffective coalition politics that plagued the country 
before the military intervened in 1980. Indeed, the biggest challenge 
may be for Turkish voters to prove that the most democratic election 
in seven years will do more than return the country to the instability of 
the 1970s

INDONESIA: Student Discontent 
Indonesian students, increasingly restive over stage-managed 
politics and corruption among senior government officials and 
within President Soeharto's family, are challen in overnment 
prohibitions against campus political activity. 
In midyear, students on several campuses demonstrated against 
tuition increases and the national soccer lottery, which they believe 
violates Muslim prohibitions on gambling, 
The US Consulate reports that as many as eight youths were 
killed last month when students in southern Sulawesi, protesting a 
requirement to wear motorcycle helmets, clashed with security forces. 
Security officials in Sumatra headed off a planned sympathy 
demonstration by students, threatening to suppress it forcibly 
because of possible antigovernment overtones. 
Early this month, student activists staged a rally at the Bandung 
Institute of Technology after blanketing the campus with banners 
denouncing Soeharto's family and the military, 
Comment: Indonesian youths traditionally have led campaigns 
against corruption, although in recent years they have been 
quiescent. The danger for the regime is that student and Muslim 
concerns will converge. Such a combination could become a potent 
antigovernment force. 
Student restiveness poses no immediate threat to the regime, and 
security forces can probably contain any local incident. Nevertheless, 
demonstrations are likely to continue through the period up to 
Soeharto's pro forma reelection next March and will encourage 
Jakarta to clamp down further on open opposition. Authorities have 
prohibited students from organizing political activities on campus 
since 1979

BAHRAIN: Shia Activism 
Shia activism in Bahrain is growing; although there have been no 
serious disturbances, the ossibility of sporadic political 
violence is increasing. 
over the past two months local 
Shias have used every religious holiday to hold political gatherings. 
These activities, which have been drawing large crowds, are generally 
accompanied by inflammatory speeches against the ruling Al Khalifa 
family and the US naval presence in Bahrain. On several occasions 
young Shias have worn red "martyr" headbands and carried Iranian 
flags. 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
the increased Shia activity is 25X1 
a product of Iran's slanted media coverage of events in Bahrain, its 
efforts to reorganize the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, 
and provocative speeches by Bahraini leaders of the Islamic Call 
Party. The government's reluctance to crack down on subversive 
activities to avoid provoking tensions and antigovernment activity 
may also be encouraging the Shias. 25X1 
Comment: The majority of Bahrain's Shias, who make up 70 percent 
of the population, continue to support the ruling family. Many have 
been in Bahrain for generations and have acquired a stake in the 
country's political and economic structure. Nonetheless, groups such 
as the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain and the Islamic Call 
Party are recovering from setbacks suffered in recent years and 
appear to be gaining support. Eventually they may stage political 
demonstrations or even terrorist attacks against a local or US target. 
The odds are good that Bahrain's security service, which is well 
trained  will be 
able to control such activity. The ruling family would be prepared to 
implement tougher security measures, including cracking down on 
local Shia leaders, if Shia antigovernment activity risked upsetting the 
political balance on the island.

IRAN: Mobilization Efforts, 
Iran began its "Mobilization Week" yesterday and is planning rallies 
and maneuvers involving volunteers in some 25 cities. The activities 
will culminate in major demonstrations in Tehran and Qom on 
Wednesday and the dispatch of volunteers throughout the country to 
the front. Iranian media claim that 600,000 volunteers will be involved 
in the exercises 
Comment: Although the number of volunteers involved are probably 
exaggerated, Tehran is likely to raise 100,000 to 150,000 troops as 
reinforcements for a major ground offensive this winter. Iran is 
continuing other preparations for an offensive, and it will take three to 
six weeks for the new troops to be trained and moved to the front.

AFGHANISTAN-USSR: Soviet Operation in Paktia Province 
Soviet and Afghan forces are conducting a large combat operation in 
Paktia Province to counter insurgent activity around Khowst and 
Gardeyz. The US Embassy in Kabul reports two Soviet armored 
columns of approximately 700 vehicles moved south toward Gardeyz 
early this week. 
Comment: The situation for the Afghan regime's forces in Paktia has 
gotten worse during the past two weeks, especially near Khowst. 
Insurgent forces have repeatedly harassed the Afghan units in the 
area, overrun several posts, and may be preparing to conduct heavy 
attacks on the Afghan infantry division headquartered at Khowst. This 
increased insurgent activity has apparently prompted Soviet forces to 
react. They may be preparing to reopen the Gardeyz to Khowst 
road?which has been closed for several years?in an effort to 
resupply the garrison at Khowst.

COLOMBIA: Traffickers Maneuver Against Extradition 
Colombian drug traffickers are positioning themselves to forestall 
kingpin Jorge Ochoa's extradition to the US. Despite a government 
announcement?intended to reduce the likelihood of violence?that 
Bogota will not extradite Ochoa until he serves a jail term for customs 
violations, concerned traffickers have threatened a Colombian 
journalist and the US Consulate in Barranquilla, prompting a 
temporary closing of the Consulate.  
President Barco on Monday ordered a number of steps to upgrade 
domestic security. 
Comment: Barco's attempt to extradite Ochoa is constrained by the 
Colombian legal system, which voided the 1979 extradition treaty with 
the US and failed to establish a precedent for extradition under other 
international agreements. Any attempt to extradite Ochoa using 
extralegal measures will leave the government open to criminal 
charges and public criticism. Meanwhile, the slow pace of the 
decisionmaking process is buying the traffickers time to work for 
Ochoa's release and to plan retaliatory action against Colombian 
officials and US interests in Colombia if he is extradited. 
GREECE: End to Economic Austerity 
The Greek Government ended its two-year austerity program on 
Wednesday by presenting a budget to Parliament that calls for higher 
spending across the board and reduced value-added and personal 
income taxes. Additional revenue from a special tax on corporate 
profits and other measures will not fill the gap, and Athens expects 
the budget deficit to climb by 24 percent next year. Moderate Minister 
of National Economy Simitis resigned yesterday, citing his opposition 
to the government's softened stance on wage increases. 
Comment: Simitis, whose resignation almost certainly will erode 
business confidence, probably believes he had lost the ear of Prime 
Minister Papandreou to leftist rivals, who will continue to press for 
loosening the economy. The government's budget proposal is almost 
sure to pass and is bad news for the recently improving Greek 
economy. Inflation, the current account deficit, and Greece's credit 
rating are likely to suffer. Papandreou appears to have readopted his 
election-winning formula of favoring workers at the expense of 
business, although the tax changes will not significantly affect voters 
until just before June 1989, the latest date an election can be called.

MALAYSIA: Press Controls Proposed 
On Tuesday, Kuala Lumpur proposed legislation to strengthen the 
government's control over Malaysia's press and the distribution of 
foreign publications. According to the US Embassy, the legislation 
would give the government power to refuse to issue printing permits, 
suppress publications for up to six months, and prohibit the 
importation of publications it considers a threat to public order. 
Comment: The bill will be debated in Parliament on Wednesday and 
comes one month after a government crackdown on political activists 
that resulted in 106 detentions and the closure of four newspapers. 
Prime Minister Mahathir, with majority party backing, will almost 
certainly be able to enact the legislation, which he views as essential 
to controlling political dissent and preventing racial violence. 
Opposition parties, however, most of which represent minority 
interests, will view it as a further infringement of their democratic 
rights, and the legislation runs the risk of heightening racial tension. 
VANUATU: Ruling Party Favored in Election 
The ruling Vanuaaku Party is likely to increase its majority of 
Vanuatu's 46 parliamentary seats in Monday's polling?the second 
national election since independence in 1980. The US Embassy in 
Papua New Guinea estimates the party, which controls the media and 
all government agencies, should win 25 to 35 seats. Prime Minister 
Lini, physically weakened by a stroke in February, is running for 
reelection but may not seek another term as Prime Minister, 
according to the Embassy. 
Comment: The election will also determine the relative strength of 
numerous factions within the Vanuaaku Party. Lini could probably 
retain the prime-ministership if he chooses; his resignation would fuel 
a power struggle between his supporters and those of party Secretary 
General Sope when Parliament convenes on 11 December. Gains by 
Sope?an opportunist largely responsible for the country's dealings 
with Libya?would assure continued radicalism in Vanuatu's foreign 
policy.

Gorbachev's Shift to the Center 
the more 
conservative members of the leadership began this year to grow increasingly uneasy with the 
scope and accelerating pace of Gorbachev's reform. Their outspokenness?especially over 
the summer?prompted Gorbachev to back away from some of the more controversial 
aspects of his program: 
July-August 
September 
October 
November 
Ligachev publicly voiced concern about excesses of glasnost and 
democratization, noting new freedoms had dredged up "scum and 
debris" and warning against any "deviation from socialism in the 
direction of a market economy, ideological pluralism, and Western 
democracy." 
Gorbachev told media chiefs on 14 July to continue open discussion 
of controversial issues but warned them not to go beyond limits of 
socialism. He told the officials that some people are just waiting for 
"you or me to make a mistake ... to turn it against the entire process 
of democratization and glasnost." 
KGB Chairman Chebrikov echoed Ligachev's concerns, warned that 
Western intelligence services are trying to exploit democratization to 
"divide the party from the people." 
Gorbachev reaffirmed his commitment to reform while offering 
reassurances that the party will not be destabilized. In Murmansk, he 
said that if backtracking is allowed "that will be it; our restructuring 
front will fall apart." In Leningrad, he assured listeners that there will 
be no Chinese "Cultural Revolution" style assault on the party. 
Gorbachev delivered cautious Revolution Day address and 
repudiated Yel'tsin the following week. In a speech to senior party 
officials on the 20th, he warns that "conservatism" and "artificial 
avant-guardism" both lead to a "dead end."

Special Analysis 
USSR: Gorbachev on the Defensive 
Under pressure from more conservative members of the Soviet 
leadership, General Secretary Gorbachev appears to be 
distancing himself from the radical reform wing of the party for 
the moment and moving to a more politically tenable middle 
ground. This tack follows a series of challenges and setbacks 
that culminated in the recent ouster of his former ally Boris 
Yel'tsin as Moscow party leader. Gorbachev is still setting the 
political agenda and appears in no immediate danger of losing 
his job, but he will have to show his supporters he has not 
compromised too much in an effort to preserve leadership unity. 
Gorbachev's reform campaign appeared to peak in June at the 
Central Committee plenum, which backed his plans for 
comprehensive economic reform and strengthened his control over 
the party's leadership bodies. Since then, more conservative 
members of the leadership, led by Gorbachev's de facto deputy, 
Yegor Ligachev, have signaled growing discomfort with the scope and 
pace of the General Secretary's reforms. 
Gorbachev has responded with a more cautious approach on certain 
controversial issues while continuing to promote his reform agenda 
vigorously. He apparently has tried to avoid further polarizing the  
leadership and provoking a showdown with Ligachev. 
The Revolution Anniversary and the Yel'tsin Affair 
Conflict in the Politburo came to a head on the eve of the 70th 
anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. Gorbachev reportedly had 
planned to use his anniversary speech to criticize basic features of the 
repressive, authoritarian system Stalin created in order to legitimize 
further movement toward reform. But he was evidently forced to 
water down the most provocative sections of the speech in response 
to objections from party conservatives. He denounced Stalin's purges 
but stopped short of questioning the main lines of the dictator's 
policies. 
The slowing of reform in some areas sparked a major clash at the 
Central Committee plenum held last month to endorse Gorbachev's 
anniversary speech; Yel'tsin surprised the leadership by taking the 
case for radical reform to the generally conservative Central 
Committee.  The resulting debacle was a major setback for 
Gorbachev.

The Yel'tsin Affair?What Was at Issue? 
Boris Yel'tsin's impetuous behavior probably precipitated his removal, but his conflict with his 
nemesis Ligachev was rooted in a clash over the limits and character of reform: 
? In cadres policy, Yel'tsin had removed 23 of 33 district party heads. 
But city officials who felt threatened found a protector in Ligachev, who reportedly 
blocked personnel changes in the capital. 
? In his attacks on corruption and elite privileges, Yel'tsin also collided with Ligachev, 
who reportedly tried to get Yel'tsin to modify his criticisms of special stores and other 
perquisites for party members. Those in Moscow who suffered under the 
anticorruption campaign constituted a major source of opposition to Yel'tsin. 
? In the economic reform area, Ligachev reportedly interfered with Yel'tsin's attempts 
to promote joint ventures in Moscow with capitalist firms and to introduce cooperative 
publishing houses. 
? Ligachev evidently thought Yel'tsin was not doing enough about social discipline. He 
is said to have bypassed Yel'tsin to chastise city officials for laxity in combating crime 
and drug abuse and reportedly criticized Yel'tsin's management of the antialcohol 
campaign. 
Yel'tsin also clashed with Chebrikov over reform. 
? Chebrikov reportedly criticized Yel'tsin for seeing too many foreigners and talking too 
freely. 
25X1 
25X1 
? Yertsin is said to have criticized the KGB, maintaining that it  needed to be cut back in 
size and authority. Gorbachev also wants to 25X1 
slash the number of KGB officers and reduce KGB monitoring of citizens in the USSR. 
Yel'tsin's reported criticism of Gorbachev himself was evidently due to frustration that the 
pace of change had slackened. He is said to have charged Gorbachev with allowing a 
"triumphal" tone in press discussion of restructuring, even though little had actually been 
achieved so far, and he reportedly implied that Gorbachev's toleration of a "cult of 
personality" detracted from the reform effort.

Gorbachev has tried to limit the damage to his reform program and to 
his own reputation, but his failure to protect Yel'tsin has cost him 
some credibility with many reform-minded Soviets. Many members of 
the Moscow intelligentsia?a group that has stron ly su ported 
Gorbachev in the past?now feel betrayed. 
Outlook 
Gorbachev still appears to have sufficient support in top leadership 
bodies to retain power. By adding close ally Aleksandr Yakovlev and 
two other party secretaries to the Politburo in June and removing 
Geydar Aliyev last month, Gorbachev probably has ensured a working 
majority for continuing reform at a measured pace. He is also still 
dominant in the Secretariat, regardless of the probable departure of 
his ally Lev Zaykov, Yel'tsin's successor as Moscow party boss. 
Within both the Politburo and Secretariat, Gorbachev's economic 
reform initiatives appear to have more leadership  support than his 
push for glasnost or "democratization." 
The General Secretary's support is more tenuous in the Central 
Committee, where a majority of members attained their positions 
under Leonid Brezhnev and many feel threatened by Gorbachev's 
reform policies. They may interpret Yel'tsin's removal as indicating 
that they can now drag their feet on reform. Gorbachev has sought to 
prevent such complacency, however, telling senior party officials last 
week that "attitude toward restructuring" will be the main criterion for 
holding party office. 
In the coming months, the pressure will be on Gorbachev to show that 
his reform agenda will not be compromised or rolled back. His ability 
to use the media to press his program will be especially important so 
that opponents of reform and those still sitting on the fence do not 
conclude that the conservatives have won the day. Gorbachev also 
needs to make personnel appointments at all levels of the party to 
augment his support before the special All-Union Party Conference 
next June, which could be a watershed in his tenure as General 
Secretary. He evidently wants to use that meeting to change the 
composition of the Central Committee and gain authoritative 
endorsement of his most controversial policies. If he fails to regain the 
initiative by that time, the momentum for reform will diminish and his 
own political future will become increasingly uncertain.

Special Analysis 
POLAND: Referendum Politics 
Despite uneven support from party activists and continuing 
public cynicism, party-state leader Jaruzelski's outmaneuvering 
of the opposition and the lack of a better alternative could still 
produce a narrow, unenthusiastic approval of the Polish 
Government's reform program in the referendum on Sunday. 
Many Poles are disgruntled with the government's emphasis on 
price hikes, but Jaruzelski's cultivation of the Church while 
keeping Solidarity on the defensive has improved the chances of 
a favorable outcome. Jaruzelski will continue to seek a positive 
response, but, in the event of a negative vote, his commitment to 
reform may lead him to doctor the results. 
The referendum is part of Jaruzelski's campaign to implement 
comprehensive reforms in a manner persuasive to both a restive work 
force and doubtful foreign creditors from whom Poland wants new 
hard currency loans. The vaguely worded referendum questions?one 
economic, one political?were not published until last month after 
Jaruzelski?as proof of his commitment to reform?announced a 
restructuring of the leadership and streamlining of the bureaucracy. 
The first question seeks public acquiescence in sustaining two or 
three years of austerity to revitalize the Polish economy; the second 
calls for support for partial democratization of the political system. 
Warsaw?in response to public criticism?promised more detail on 
what it had in mind for the economy. However, the price reform 
proposals for 1988, announced in the Polish press on 14 November, 
were surprisingly severe?while fuels and residential rents would 
double or triple. Warsaw claimed subsidies would largely offset these 
increases, but the harshness of the proposals has reinforced popular 
belief that reform simply means massive price hikes. Warsaw has 
done a bad job justifying the need for higher but more realistic prices 
as a means of stimulating industrial expansion that would in turn 
result in higher real wages and more consumer goods in the future. 
Jaruzelski's Referendum Strategy 
The government's courting of Catholic Church support for the 
referendum has not elicited an endorsement. Nonetheless, a joint 
communique by Jaruzelski and Cardinal Glemp in midmonth 
proclaiming general satisfaction with Church-state relations has been 
portrayed in some localities as tacit Church support, according to US 
Consulate reporting from Krakow. Moreover, some of the proposed 
political reforms as sear specifically designed to appeal to moderate 
Catholics.

Top Secret 
Meanwhile, Jaruzelski has capitalized on the division within the 
Solidarity leadership over the reforms?which are initiatives that 
borrow from earlier Solidarity proposals. Solidarity's initial call 
for a boycott?since rescinded?was hastily conceived and, 
criticized by Glemp; 
Solidarity's indecisiveness makes the group appear weak and 
obstructionist. Jaruzelski's eleventh-hour overtures for cooperation 
appear designed to keep Solidarity leaders on the defensive. 
One problem area for Jaruzelski, however, has been persuading some 
regional party activists to encourage participation in the referendum. 
According to Consulate reporting from 
Krakow, regional party officials observing local cynicism and apathy 
have expressed strong doubts of their own; many are fearful that their 
own incomes will suffer; strong supporters of reform in Chelm fear 
that a negative response on the referendum will undermine the party. 
Surprisingly, however, even pessimistic observers estimate 
participation of 60 to 70 percent of eligible voters on Sunday. 
Prospects 
Whatever the outcome of the referendum, Jaruzelski's personal 
identification with the reform program probably will compel him to 
announce a favorable response to both questions. A yes vote appears 
fairly certain on the political question?although the party plenum will 
not decide on a political reform resolution until next week?but less 
so on the economic. The regime may not have to tamper with the 
results, however, if Solidarity-inspired abstentions result in a weak 
turnout. The lower the overall vote, the fewer undecided voters 
Jaruzelski must sway to attain a majority of ballots cast. 
Attracting the additional votes from among the undecided may not be 
difficult; despite strong cynicism, many Poles realize reforms are 
necessary, according to Consulate reporting. Some?young 
marrieds, for example, facing 20-year waiting lists for apartments?
may vote for economic reforms out of desperation with a tired 
economy. The Polish media are now full of programs on economic 
reforms in preparation for the referendum. 
Jaruzelski probably hopes the results of previously unannounced 
mock referendum held last Sunday in a small town outside Warsaw 
will dissuade negative votes. The leadership claims that 62 percent of 
eligible voters participated in the experiment and that more than 
90 percent voted for both referendum questions?figures that seem 
contrived in view of the lack of participation observed by the Western 
press at one polling station.

Special Analysis 
EASTERN EUROPE- Seeking Computer Technology 
USSR: 
Moscow is pressing Eastern Europe harder to provide it with 
advanced computer technology to speed its modernization 
program. East Europeans probably will redouble their legal and 
illegal efforts to acquire Western technology, complicating 
Western efforts to safeguard sensitive equipment while 
expanding commercial relations with the USSR and its allies. 
Soviet leader Gorbachev believes that closing the gap with Western 
computer technology is essential to the success of economic reforms 
under way in the USSR and several East European countries. The 
USSR has concluded that previous CEMA efforts to coordinate 
national programs to overcome the lag in computer technology have 
been ineffective and that greater direction from Moscow is needed. 
Even if the USSR can, as it claims, begin soon to produce a faster, 
more powerful computer for export, its computer technology will still 
be about 10 years behind that of the West. And the current attempt to 
produce supercomputers by the end of the century will?even if 
successful?leave Eastern technology at least five years behind. 
Moscow may encourage East-West joint ventures, as with Western 
Europe's EUREKA program for advanced research. Joint ventures 
within CEMA have not worked well, and changes in currency 
exchange and pricing incentives discussed at a recent CEMA meeting 
in Moscow are not likely to yield major dividends in the near future. 
One measure of Soviet interest in joint ventures with Western Europe 
may be Moscow's hints that it would acknowledge West Berlin as an 
EC member in return  for Soviet-East European participation in 
EUREKA. 
The interest of Western governments in expanding economic ties to 
Eastern Europe will increase the difficulty of protecting advanced 
computer technology. Such technology is one of the few commodities 
for which Moscow and its allies are willing to spend hard currency and 
for which they are liberalizing their joint-venture laws.
