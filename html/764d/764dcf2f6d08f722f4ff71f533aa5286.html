SCOPE NOTE 
The increasingly rapid growth of the Communist insurgency in the 
Philippines and the absence thus far of any effective government effort 
to counter the threat raise the prospects that a Communist government 
could come to power in Manila. This Estimate examines the growth of 
the New People's Army (NPA) and the Communist Party of the 
Philippines (CPP), and assesses the near-term prospects (three to five 
years) for the insurgency and the government's counterinsurgency 
program. The implications for the United States of a Communist 
takeover also are examined. 
President Marcos, beset by an opposition effort to start impeach-
ment proceedings and growing public allegations of vast financial 
investments overseas by the first family and its cronies, may advance 
the time of a presidential election from 1987 to November 1985 by 
resigning in September (45 to 60 days before the election). While such a 
move would provide Marcos with some political advantages?catching 
the opposition while still in a state of disarray and, assuming his 
reelection, giving him a new mandate for six more years?it also could 
exacerbate opposition dissatisfaction and provide the CPP/NPA with 
ammunition to expand their grassroots support base in the country-
side?reinforcing the assessments in this Estimate.

KEY JUDGMENTS 
The Communist-led insurgents in the Philippines are in an ideal 
position to benefit from the malaise prevalent throughout their country: 
? Popular support for the Marcos government is at an alltime low. 
? The prospects for meaningful political reforms under this 
regime are slight. 
? Economic recovery will proceed only slowly. 
? The military's response to the New People's Army (NPA) is for 
the most part inept and often counterproductive. 
It is unlikely that the military's performance will improve enough to 
stem increased NPA activity in the near term. 
The NPA is likely to continue to grow and will gradually increase 
the size and frequency of military actions to include assaults against 
better defended targets and expanded night operations. 
We believe government forces may soon cede de facto control of 
some lowland areas and rural highlands to the Communists in many 
regions of the country. 
The Communists continue to prepare to bring their revolution to 
the streets of Manila. Such an event would further undermine the 
Marcos government, though it would place the CPP/NPA apparatus in 
Manila at considerable risk. The Communists, however, cannot hope to 
achieve a military victory in the near future without substantially more 
arms and ammunition than they now possess. Nevertheless, we judge 
they will continue to rely primarily on internal sources for arms and 
funding. 
In sum, we believe that, if present trends continue, within the next 
three to five years, the insurgents could stalemate the military in the 
countryside and bring widespread urban terrorism to the streets of 
Manila. We also believe, however, a major governmental crisis during 
this period could give a coalition dominated by the Communists, or the 
Communists themselves, an opportunity to seize power without first 
achieving a decisive battlefield advantage. 
Our bleak prognosis, however, could be altered by a number of 
developments, chief among which would be the installation of an

effective, reform-minded, non-Communist government in Manila.' This 
could come about as the result of an orderly constitutional succession in 
the event of Marcos's death, his forced removal from office by military 
coup, or his defeat in the 1987 presidential election. Any new non-
Communist government would have an opportunity to remedy the 
country's many ills; with an improved economy and a calmer political 
environment, a reduction of the Communist appeal would be within 
reach. At the same time, any successor government would face most of 
the same formidable problems confronting Marcos?and without his 
experience or other assets. Whether a new government could make 
more headway against the insurgency or economic problems is an open 
question. 
A less likely development that could alter our bleak prognosis 
would be for Marcos to recognize that reversing the current ominous 
trends requires him to initiate sweeping, fundamental reforms, 
including: 
? Holding credible elections in 1986 and 1987. 
? Depoliticizing the AFP. 
? Implementing a coordinated counterinsurgency strategy and 
pursuing it vigorously. 
? Adopting programs that would stimulate economic recovery. 
We are agreed, however, that the chances are extremely low for Marcos 
undertaking any or all of these measures. 
The current situation could give rise to some very serious problems 
for the United States. We could see a prolonged period of -civil war," 
with the government increasingly hard pressed, serious terrorist and 
insurgent attacks on US persons and installations, growing anti-Ameri-
canism, and a period of hard choices for the United States?including if 
and when to abandon Marcos. Even if the Communists ruled out direct 
attack on US citizens, increased violence would pose a substantial 
danger to the almost 100,000 Americans in the islands and US economic 
interests there. Under these circumstances, US efforts to prop up Marcos 
probably would be counterproductive in that the United States would 
be seen by most Filipinos as supporting an unpopular dictator. As long 
as Marcos remains in power, we see little prospect for success against the 
insurgents. At best, US aid might retard Communist expansion. 
A takeover in the Philippines by Communists or by a government 
heavily influenced by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) 
would be viewed by countries in the region?particularly other ASEAN

countries and China?as a setback of historic proportions, perhaps even 
more devastating than our defeat in Vietnam. Besides the loss of US 
bases, it could also mean a significant loss of US credibility and prestige. 
Among other results likely to follow a CPP/NPA takeover are: 
? US forward-basing strategy would suffer due to loss of the bases, 
and US power-projection capability would be adversely 
impacted. 
? The Philippines might permit Soviets access to the military 
facilities?at a price?thereby increasing Soviet influence in the 
region and diminishing the United States'. This would pose a 
significant strategic threat to US friends and allies in the region.

DISCUSSION 
Background to the Present Crisis 
1. The current insurgency can be traced to 1968 
when several young Communists, led by an ardent 
Maoist, Jose Maria Sison, attempted to inculcate Mao's 
ideology into the moribund pro-Soviet Communist 
Party of the Philippines (PKP). Failing in this attempt, 
they split with the PKP and formed a new Communist 
Party, the pro-Beijing Communist Party of the Philip-
pines (CPP), with the aim of bringing armed revolu-
tion once more to the Philippines. They linked up with 
the remnants of a small Huk guerrilla band, which 
they renamed the New People's Army (NPA). 
2. Sison's guerrillas Quickly sought to establish a 
permanently liberated base in the Cagayan Valley of 
northern Luzon, in imitation of Mao Zedong's experi-
ence at Yenan. But they were no match for the 
Philippine armed forces, who mounted several cam-
paigns in the early 1970s, forcing the CPP/NPA to 
abandon the fixed-base strategy. The Communists 
then opened guerrilla fronts in several remote parts of 
the countryside, emphasizing armed propaganda 
teams rather than military activity. Throughout most 
of the 1970s they remained an irritant in remote parts 
of the countryside while the military's attention fo-
cused on the Muslim insurgency in Mindanao and the 
Sulu archipalego islands 
3. Communist expansion during the early 1970s was 
slow. They experienced numerous setbacks and 
learned by trial and error. By the 1980s, however, they 
were well entrenched on all major islands and were 
operating in nearly every province. Since the assassina-
tion of opposition leader Benigno Aquino in August 
1983, CPP/NPA political and military action has 
escalated rapidly. Taking advantage of widespread 
popular disenchantment with the Marcos family and 
other internal problems, the Communists have fo-
mented numerous antiregime rallies and strikes, re-
cruited several thousand new guerrillas, and stepped 
up NPA military operations throughout the country-
side 
4. These insurgents are markedly different from the 
previous Communist insurgents, the Huks, who fought 
the government from 1946 to 1954, and again in the 
1960s. CPP/NPA leadership today includes young 
intellectuals from all parts of the Philippines, not just 
central Luzon; they rigorously pursue a Maoist strate-
gy emphasizing political organizing of the rural popu-
lation and protracted guerrilla warfare. By analyzing 
the revolutions in Vietnam and Nicaragua, they have 
learned the importance of manipulating international 
public opinion to their benefit. 
The CPP/NPA Organization 
The Party 
5. The Communist Party of the Philippines?which 
we estimate 
to be about 30,000 to 45,000 strong?is a 
tightly knit organization led by dedicated revolution-
aries who are well trained and highly disciplined 
t controls villages inhabited by at least 5 
million people and is contesting government control of 
villages inhabited by another 5.5 million. For the 
purpose of this paper, we use the term Communist-
controlled village to mean areas where: 
? A Communist -shadow government- has been 
established. 
? Communist peasant, women, and youth associa-
tions are functioning. 
? Most of the population is sympathetic and gives 
material support to the insurgents. 
? At least 50 percent of the population can be 
mobilized for protest actions. 
? NPA militia units may be present. 
6. As with all Communist parties, the CPP and its 
military arm, the NPA, is under control of a small 
dedicated Central Committee, that makes all impor-
tant decisions regarding ideology, strategy, and man-
agement of the party. Central Committee directives 
are implemented by committees at the village level, 
the NPA at each level is under the command of both 
the local party committee and higher level NPA 
commands, and united front activities are directed by 
a similar interlocking command structure. This system 
of command and control has provided both strong 
central direction and local flexibility in implementing 
orders from above.

7. The CPP is organized along both territorial and 
functional lines and, since 1984, by rural and urban 
responsibilities as well Six regional 
commissions, each headed by a Central Committee 
member, were created in the 1980s to cope with the 
geographic spread of the party and to ensure that all 
subordinate committees operate in accordance with 
the party line set by the Central Committee. Five 
functional commissions oversee party activities in the 
areas of foreign and domestic propaganda, military 
affairs, mass movements, and united front activities. 
The United Front 
8. The National Democratic Front (NDF), the par-
ty's main united front organization, is in the forefront 
of the CPP's overt effort to form a broad alliance of 
Filipinos opposed to the Marcos government.  
9. Its united front organizing skills have historically 
been the weak link in the CPP/NPA insurgency. The 
party's efforts to form a broad alliance of Filipinos 
opposed to the Marcos government have suffered 
setbacks repeatedly due to the capture of front mem-
bers and the dogmatic policies of party leaders. Party 
leaders, realizing this weakness, are now concentrating 
on united front activities to ensure a role for the party 
in any successor government. The CPP/NPA has 
begun to scatter party cells, infiltrating the leadership 
of some organizations, forming new ones seemingly 
independent of the party when necessary, and estab-
lishing alliances throughout Philippine society in sup-
port of the party's revolutionary objectives. 
11. The party has also infiltrated organized labor 
through the NDF and considers this sector one of its 
best penetrated. Party influence in the Kilusang Mayo

Uno?May First Movement?accounts for much of 
the increasingly militant tone of union activity. The 
labor movement in the Philippines is badly fragment-
ed, and Communist control is tenuous among many of 
the leftist labor alliances. Despite this, party plans to 
continue fomenting labor unrest make strike activity 
likely to remain high in the months ahead.

nationwide, is characterized by strict discipline, opera-

we estimate the 
NPA to have about 15,000 to 16,500 regulars orga-

village militia and local guerrilla units

various organizations described below, depending on 
circumstances 
13. Regular Units?Regular Mobile Forces. The 
Regular Mobile Forces are the best trained, equipped, 
and organized guerrillas. These full-time forces are 
responsible for most of the large-scale raids and am-
bushes. NPA regulars operate at three levels?district, 
guerrilla front, and regional?under the direction of 
their respective party committees. 
14. Main Regional Guerrilla Units (MRGU) and 
Secondary Regional Guerrilla Units (SRGU) of be-
tween 50 and 300 men each are equivalent to a regular 
company of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. 
They normally confine their operations to the estab-
lished guerrilla fronts throughout the country. The 
MRGU is a mobile force of about 100 to 300 guerrillas 
that can link up any time with an SRGU or local 
guerrilla unit, forming a combined force to conduct 
guerrilla operations. Within the past two years, the 
NPA has frequently combined such forces to success-
fully attack poorly defended government targets. 
MRGUs in Mindanao can now field 200 to 300 men, 
but units of this size are still in their formative stages 
in most regions. Operations involving 100 to 200 
guerrillas throu hout the rest of the country are not 
unusual 
15. Regular Units?Armed City Partisans. The 
NPA uses classic urban guerrilla tactics to bring the 
war to the cities. Four- to seven-member guerrilla 
Reporting varies. The Philippine Government publicly reports 
that there are no more than 45 fronts. 
teams?called Sparrow Units?specialize in killing 
police, other government employees, and informers 
whom the party identifies in its propaganda as respon-
sible for abusing the people.  
he NPA has been organizing for combat 
in Manila since 1980 and now has about 300 to 600  
people involved in these activities in the capital. 
16. Irregular Units?People's Guerrillas. In mu-
nicipalities and villages where the party is contesting 
control or is already firmly entrenched, local guerrilla 
squads of 10 to 20 irregulars are formed by the NPA, 
both to support regular insurgent military forces and 
to operate independently. These local guerrilla squads 
operate together with NPA regulars in or close to their 
home villages, sometimes in coniuction with much 
larger guerrilla units. They are usually poorly armed 
and may play only a supporting, rather than a combat, 
role in large NPA operations. By day, a guerrilla in

such a unit works at his normal job; at night, or in 
emergencies, he is available for assignment by his 
party superiors. 
17. Irregular Units?People's Militia. A militia 
unit is the lowest echelon of party organization at the 
village level. These units of about 15 to 20 persons 
operate directly under the village committee rather 
than the NPA. The militia are villagers, male and 
female, who are covertly recruited and given the 
critical responsibility for defense of villagers in CPP-
controlled areas against government reprisals and pro-
tection of resident or visiting cadre. A secret unit 
within each village militia is responsible for enforce-
ment of party discipline, which includes assassinations. 
Communist Strategy and Tactics 
18. The CPP/NPA follows a political and guerrilla 
strategy of protracted revolutionary guerrilla warfare, 
following the teachings of Mao Zedong as modified by 
party founder Jose Maria Sison. The strategy empha-
sizes the importance of painstakingly building a base 
of support in the countryside among the peasant 
population. Guerrilla warfare is seen as complement-
ing the political program in which party members and 
front groups work to undermine the Marcos govern-
ment and legitimize their own organization 
19. To broaden its popular appeal, the party in-
creasingly is citing Nicaragua as an example of a 
revolution in which Marxist-Leninists, moderate oppo-
sition, and church workers successfully united to over-
throw a dictator. The CPP/NPA portrays the Sandinis-
ta regime as one where the Christian plea for social 
justice has been realized without the repressive politi-
cal and social controls of other Communist countries. 
This analogy has an appeal to some Filipino Catholics 
who oppose the Marcos regime but have misgivings 
about uniting with Communist revolutionaries. 
20. Another aspect of CPP/NPA strategy, though 
not well publicized, is the party's consolidation plan. 
According to Sison, once the Communists come to 
power, there will be a subsequent "socialist revolu-
tion" to consolidate Communism in Philippine society. 
Although united front tactics and coalition govern-
ment proposals are articulated now, when the People's 
Democratic Republic of the Philippines has been 
established, the party alone will be responsible for 
transforming the society into a "proletarian dictator-
ship." At that time, the "blood debt to the people" 
owed by the landlord class and other "enemies of the 
people- will be avenged 
21. It is in the political sphere that the Communists 
now see their most advantageous prospects. The CPP

is maneuvering for a role in any government that 
would be formed should Marcos die in office and is 
actively promoting the concept of a coalition govern-
ment in which it would legally participate. In a switch 
from its previous position of advocating a boycott of 
elections, the CPP/NPA now intends to actively par-
ticipate in the 1986 nationwide local elections, sup-
porting candidates they have co-opted, while disrupt-
in the election process in areas where they are weak. 
Operation of a Guerrilla Front 
22. The CPP/NPA concentrates most military ac-
tion in rural areas. Guerrilla fronts, typically located in 
mountainous terrain adjacent to a populated lowland, 
consist of a series of zones or areas. A "red zone" 
contains the guerrilla base and surrounding base area. 
Guerrilla bases, although extensive in size, are not 
fortified military encampments. Rather, the NPA 
forces live in several established contiguous barrios?
usually 10 or more?which differ little from other 
barrios. In some instances, these barrios are surround-
ed by a defensive perimeter of trenches and foxholes, 
but in most cases the NPA has abandoned these bases 
without serious losses as government forces prepared 
to assault them (see figure 5) 
23. Beyond this core is a "pink zone," the area 
within the front where most political and military 
activities to contest the government's control are con-
centrated. Urbanized areas within this zone, controlled 
by the government and its forces, are usually classified 
as "white areas.- The party is now stepping up efforts 
to penetrate these cities and towns, organizing white 
area committees and urban guerrilla units in most 
fronts. Areas that lie outside the guerrilla fronts are 
also labeled white areas, but, as the fronts expand, 
party strategists expect these white areas to disappear. 
24. NPA Regular Mobile Forces are housed and 
trained in the guerrilla base area, which provides a 
reliable operational center, secure sanctuary, and rear 
area for the party's local political and military organi-
zations. NPA regulars operate throughout the guerrilla 
front from these bases; large units attacking govern-
ment forces and small armed propaganda teams in-
creasing party influence in villages are scattered 
throughout the front. 
The CPP/NPA's Progress 
25. Communist long-term efforts to politicize the 
rural population against the government are increas-
ingly paying dividends. New guerrilla fronts are being 
formed regularly, and the number of villages falling 
under Communist control has expanded rapidly since 
mid-1983 In southern Mindanao, 
for example, where the CPP/NPA is very active, 
current Constabulary estimates?which we believe 
very conservative?indicate the Communists have 
more than doubled the number of villages they control 
since the Aquino assassination in 1983. 
one-ttura ot tne 
approximately 1,600 villages in the region?are now 
under Communist control, and they are contesting 
control of another third 
25X1

25X1 
25X1 
26. The level of insurgent activity has been increas-
ing steadily over the last decade, with the most 
dramatic growth occurring since 1980. Last year, 75 
percent of the more than 5,000 violent incidents were 
initiated by the NPA Even discounting 25X1 
the 1,300 ballot box snatchings that occurred during 
elections in 1984, there were nine times more violent 
incidents in 1984 than 10 years earlier and 50 percent 
more than in 1983. 25X1 
27. NPA units nationwide now routinely attack 
government forces. These include 100- to 300-man 
assaults on poorly defended armed forces garrisons 
and economic and strategic targets. Despite recent 
government sweep operations in Mindanao and north-
ern Luzon, the NPA?not the armed forces?still 
initiates most of the military actions. Most CPP/NPA 
front commands schedule at least one attack on gov-
ernment forces per month; in Mindanao, they plan 
two per month. Raids, which net the guerrillas favor-
able publicity and firearms, increased by 53 percent in 
the past year-216 were carried out in 1984. By 
attacking weakly defended targets with large com-
bined guerrilla forces, the NPA is assured a tactical 
and propaganda victory 
28. Most guerrilla-initiated incidents are focused on 
assassinations and assaults on individuals to acquire 
weapons. Such incidents are now common nearly 
everywhere. In 1984, 
government and civilian casualties as a result of these 
incidents totaled 2,600 
killed and 1,400 wounded. 
External Support

receive any sizable foreign financial assistance or arms 
supplies. Beginning in the 1960s, Beijing provided

terminated in 1975. l'ilembers of the Central 
Committee have admitted that 
the party's most significant foreign financial support

. NDF contacts with the 
Soviets were first reported in 1982. A -reconciliation" 
between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and 
the CPP/NPA is reportedly now being tested in joint 
efforts in the labor sector between unions affiliated 
with the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) 
and the CPP/NPA's labor front, the Kilusang Mayo 
Uno (KMU). If true, this supports President Marcos's 
recent charge that the Soviet-controlled WFTU has 
been funneling money to both WFTU-affiliated labor 
unions in the Philippines and the KMU. Nevertheless, 
we judge that for the next year or two the Communists 
will continue to rely primarily on internal sources for 
arms and funding. 
Growing Popular Support for the Insurgency 
32. The CPP/NPA's remarkable growth and the 
danger this poses to stability cannot be attributed 
solely to its own efforts or the appeal of Communist 
ideology. We believe that, in areas controlled by the 
party, some people cooperate voluntarily with the 
CPP because of its seemingly honest approach to 
correcting political and economic ills. The insurgent 
threat would be far less serious, however, if fundamen-
tal political and economic problems did not exist?a 
breakdown in the traditional political order, large-
scale poverty and economic troubles, and the perva-
sive perception of knilitary 
maintaining the Marcos regime in power. 
33. Political and economic power are monopolized 
at the top by a small oligarchy, while at the bottom the 
mass of Filipinos live in poverty without real input 
into the political process. The trappings and symbols of 
democracy exist, but they overlay a patron-client 
system inherited from Spanish rule and earlier tribal 
traditions. Until recently, the hierarchical network of 
patrons, held together by personal loyalties and oper-
ating much like a political machine, provided essential 
goods and services to the people in the countryside in 
return for their support. Because much of the coun-
try's wealth depended on agricultural production, 
power was distributed widely among regional barons 
rather than concentrated in the hands of a few leaders 
in Manila 
34. After World War II, economic modernization, 
the lure of the -good life" in Manila, land reform, and 
other such factors began to undermine the influence of 
the regional chieftains and concentrate power and 
wealth more in the capital. President Marcos dramati-
cally accelerated this trend in the 1970s when he 
imposed martial law, which enabled him to concen-
trate greater power in his own hands at the expense of 
regional leaders. He now handpicks not only Cabinet 
officers, but also mayors and other local officials?a 
privilege traditionally reserved for the regional elite.

In many areas this has created officials more depen-
dent on, and responsible to, President  Marcos than to 
the needs of their local constituencies. 
35. Similarly, a few favored Marcos cronies have 
been given?often by presidential decree?control of 
large agricultural and industrial monopolies that domi-
nate the economy and seriously disrupt the operation 
of a free market. These personal associates retain their 
favored position by demonstrations of loyalty to the 
President and financial support for his political ma-
chine?the KBL. Those who do not contribute time 
and money risk expropriation of their business empires 
and loss of political influence to others more willing to 
cooperate. We believe that a recovery of the troubled 
Philippine economy depends on the President's dis-
mantling of the crony system, but, in view of his 
declining popular support, we are skeptical that he can 
acce it the loss to his own power that this would entail. 
36. Attempts to reduce the plight of the rural poor, 
such as President Marcos's agrarian reform program?
which is limited to 14 percent of the country's farm-
land?have, in our view, increased poverty and wors-
ened income distribution: at least 20 million rural 
Filipinos live in poverty?as defined by the World 
Bank as an annual income of less than $160?and their 
numbers are increasing; the landless poor account for 
nearly 40 percent of households in rice- and sugar-
growing areas; and several million Filipinos live in 
Manila's slums. The outlook for the next several years 
is not encouraging. Even if President Marcos initiated 
a sweeping economic reform program, we estimate 
that the majority of rural Filipinos will still be living in 
poverty in 1990 
37. Overall, the Philippines faces a prolonged strug-
gle resuming even modest economic growth under the 
burden of its $25 billion foreign debt. The recovery 
will be especially sensitive to adverse developments in 
the international economy and domestic political tur-
moil. Even if all goes well at home and abroad, the 
debt crisis will continue to depress economic activity 
through 1990, and the political costs of austerity for 
the government will be substantial because of rising 
unemployment and higher taxes. At the same time, we 
anticipate a period of rapid growth in the working-age 
population-3.3 percent annually?projected to be the 
highest in Asia, which would ensure that the average 
Filipino ex eriences little improvement in living stan-
dards 
38. Most Filipinos blame official corruption for 
much of their government's poor performance. They 
point to the enormous personal wealth of President 
25X1 
Marcos and his family, mostly accumulated while in 
power, and note that they have invested large sums 
outside the country. And although enriching one's self 25X1 
while in office has been a generally accepted practice 
in the Philippines, the extent of the President's inter-
vention on behalf of family and friends has exceeded 
cultural norms. Stories of other officials both high and 
low participating in illegal logging activities, misusing 
public funds, operating protection rackets, and involv-
ing themselves in other corrupt practices have prolif-
erated and been exploited by the Communists. Wheth-
er all these tales are true or not?and we believe many 
are?most Filipinos fully accept their validity and 
have little faith in government institutions. 25X1 
39. Abuses perpetrated by corrupt officers and 
undisciplined personnel and a general breakdown of 
peace and order have severely shaken respect for the 
military and the police. Many Filipinos question the 
government's ability to protect them from lawless 25X1 
elements and to dispense justice equitably. Murder, 
kidnapings, torture, and lesser abuses have become 
commonplace occurrences in recent years. Many al-
most certainly have been committed by overzealous 
officials in their pursuit of Communist insurgents, a 
pattern that began while suppressing the Muslim 
40. In any event, we believe real and perceived 
abuses have been a major factor in many Filipinos' 
choosing to join the insurgent ranks. This is especially 
true of the growing number of Catholic clergy and 
nuns who support the Communists. Some already play 
important roles in the insurgent organization, such as 
Conrado Balweg, a rebel priest, NPA commander, 
and, now, popular Filipino folk hero. Priests and nuns 
among the CPP/NPA have recently stepped up their 
efforts to popularize the Nicaraguan experience, hop-
ing to convince their colleagues disenchanted with the 
present government and its military abuses that coop-
eration with the insurgents will not adversely affect 
the Church's interests. 
41. Politicization of the AFP by President Marcos 
has also contributed to the deterioration of the militar-
y's reputation. Until a few years ago, most Filipinos 
viewed the AFP as a professional and competent force. 
The military took pride in a record of protecting the

nation's security, defending the constitution, and not 
becoming involved in politics. After the imposition of 
martial law in 1972, however, President Marcos began 
blatantly to select officers for key assignments and 
promotions based more on personal loyalty than mili-
tary competence. The morale of the officer corps 
plummeted, and the perception that politics rules the 
AFP has become the conventional wisdom for many 
Filipinos. 
Weaknesses of the NPA 
42. The CPP/NPA is not without its problems. The 
CPP/NPA's popular "Robin Hood" image has become 
somewhat tarnished in some areas. The population in 
Communist-controlled areas is discovering that the 
Communists have no magic solutions for economic 
realities and are much more thorough tax collectors 
than the Philippine Government. Another result has 
been popular resentment, as many learn that fear and 
intimidation play a more important role once the 
CPP/NPA assumes de facto control over an area and 
democratic ideals?such as consent of the governed?
are swept aside. We anticipate that such disillusion-
ment will grow as the Communists attempt to expand 
their mass base, making the CPP/NPA increasingly 
vulnerable to a sophisticated, coordinated counterin-
surgency effort. Moreover, a dramatic increase in 
urban violence, particularly in Manila, could be the 
spark that ignites the middle class into action against 
the dangers posed by the Communists. 
43. Beyond this, the NPA lacks a reliable logistic 
pipeline to support a guerrilla war. Other CPP/NPA 
weaknesses include: 
? No foreign sanctuary. The Philippines is geo-
graphically isolated. Neither Malaysia nor Indo-
nesia, the nearest countries, will permit Commu-
nist insurgent bases on their soil. 
Penchant for paperwork. The Communists keep 
detailed records and files that are regularly 
discovered when cadres are captured at their 
homes or safehouses. When compromised, such 
information provides government security forces 
with a better understanding of the insurgent 
organization, membership, and plans. 
? No charismatic leader. The CPP/NPA has no 
one of the stature of Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, 
or Fidel Castro. The Central Committee and 
senior cadres in prison are virtually unknown to 
the public. 
? Anti-American rhetoric. Party propaganda por-
trays the United States as an imperialist nation 
and the sole prop supporting the Marcos govern-
ment. To some Filipinos, this propaganda rings 
hollow. 
? Non-Communist elements in the NPA. In the 
attempt to stress nationalism over Communism, 
the party appears to have accepted under its 
banner many individuals who have a grudge 
against the government but lack ideological com-
mitment to Communism. In Kalinga Apayao, 
several hundred guerrillas belonging to an ethnic 
minority recently defected from the NPA but 
continue to war against the government. 
? No combined-arms capability. The NPA has 
demonstrated an ability to use small-unit guerril-
la tactics effectively but to date has not used 
combined arms?the coordination of different 
types of military units?in its operations. Should 
the Communists decide to attack well-defended 
military installations, they will find it necessary 
to use direct and indirect fire from machineguns 
and mortars to support their assault forces 
The Government Response 
44. The government has been slow to accept the 
seriousness of the Communist threat and has still not 
implemented or even agreed on a comprehensive 
coordinated strategy for coping with the insurgency. 
Even if it did, the armed forces suffer from deficien-
cies in leadership, discipline, training, weapons, equip-
ment, and logistic support and overall funding?so 
serious that its capability over the long term to stem 
the advance of Communist power is doubtful. 
45. Recently many Cabinet officers and military 
leaders have begun to take the Communist threat 
seriously. Defense Minister Ponce Enrile, among oth-
ers, recognizes the danger posed by the insurgents and 
advocates a coordinated governmentwide effort to 
deal with the threat. Enrile 
now speaks openly of the alarming 
growth of the insurgency and complains bitterly about 
government inaction, which he attributes almost solely 
to President Marcos. Enrile earlier took the lead in 
attempts to activate a centralized high-level counterin-
surgency program directed by the National Security 
Council. President Marcos intervened personally to 
squelch the idea and chastised his Defense Minister for 
acting without authorization.

46. Despite a recent public relations campaign by 
the government, the President views the insurgency 
problem in primarily military terms. He has said 
economic programs and civic action must wait until 
AFP clearing operations have eradicated the guerrilla 
presence. Moreover, he has chosen to direct the entire 
counterinsurgency effort personally, as he did against 
the fledgling NPA in the early 1970s. He has stated 
that he reviews all expenditures over $3,000, calls field 
commanders, and approves the use of field artillery. 
Although we doubt that he does this more than 
occasionally, he does have the Regional Unified Com-
mand (RUC) Commander reporting directly to him, 
thereby cutting out the Defense Minister and the 
Chief of Staff, who complain that their broader 
counterinsurgency proposals cannot be implemented 
without the President's approval, which they cannot 
get. Accordingly, we believe that President Marcos is 
contributing to the insurgency problem and hindering 
its solution 
47. We believe the President's reluctance to dele-
gate authority and his failure to implement a coordi-
nated counterinsurgency program stem primarily 
from a fear that it might undermine his own power. 
He lacks confidence in the ability of many of those he 
has surrounded himself with, and feels far more secure 
relying on his own considerable talents than trusting 
his survival to men chosen more for political reliabil-
ity. He may fear that the creation of a counterinsur-
gency czar might come back to haunt him as hap-
pened when President Quirino appointed Ramon 
Magsaysay to take charge of eradicating the Huks in 
the 1950s. Magsaysay turned his considerable power 
and prestige, gained from the successful Huk Cam-
paign, against Quirino to become President himself. 
48. Many hoped that the appointment of General 
Ramos, a West Point graduate, as Acting Chief of Staff 
would result in reform of the AFP, an end to military 
abuses, and a more vigorous prosecution of the war 
against the Communists. Indeed, he has made limited 
progress in each of these categories. We are doubtful, 
however, about his long-term capabilities, given the 
poor showing of the PC during his tenure as its 
commander. 
49. Ramos admits that he has only been able to put 
a dent in the problems of corruption and human rights 
violations. Unless the President authorizes a thorough 
housecleaning of the AFP?a development we consid-
er unlikely?Ramos's ability to initiate meaningful 
military reforms is seriously circumscribed. Even if 
the President decides not to reinstate General Ver as 
Chief of Staff, assuming he is acquitted of responsibil-
ity for the assassination of Aquino, the prospects for his 
agreeing to the removal of incompetent but otherwise 
loyal officers are not good. Marcos may ask both Ver 
and Ramos to step down and appoint another loyalist, 
such as the Commander of the Army, General Ramas, 
to the post. In any event, the twin problems of 
politicization of the AFP and military abuses are 
unlikely to be resolved soon. 
50. General Ramos's attempts to improve the AFP's 
military capability have proceeded slowly. Some im-
provement in the AFP's logistic system and its ability 
to supply field units has been achieved with assistance 
from the Joint US Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG). 
Budget restraints, however, handicap the efforts. Seri-
ous shortfalls in almost all key items of military 
supplies?particularly mobility assets and communica-
tions gear?exist, severely limiting the AFP's combat 
capability. Retraining, another of General Ramos's 
priorities, is also proving difficult because Marcos will 
not authorize redeployment of units from around 
Manila, and the money is not now available for a 
major force expansion. 
51. Elements of the AFP and PC charged with 
carrying the war to the Communists still lack the 
initiative. Regional combat force ratios in part help 
explain this situation. The average regional ratio of 
Philippine combat forces to armed insurgents is about 
4:1. (See figure 11.) Only in Metro Manila 
does the AFP have a decisive advantage (36:1). Else-
where, many regional commanders find themselves 
confronted by an enemy force of virtually equal size. 
In firefights the guerrillas often seem to have more 
firepower and equal, if not greater, stocks of ammuni-
tion than government forces. And both sides rely 
almost exclusively on movement by foot for tactical 
mobility. In areas such as Samar and Negros, the AFP 
is moving back from the highlands to protect the cities 
and in many other areas are spending more time 
defending bases than on the clearing operations called 
for by President Marcos. 
Near-Term Prospects 
52. We believe the Communist insurgency has the 
potential to grow more rapidly during the next three 
years than at any time in the past. The Communist 
Party is now in an ideal position to benefit from the 
malaise prevalent throughout Philippine society: pop-
ular support for the Marcos government is at an all-
time low; the prospects for meaningful political re-
forms under this regime are slight; and economic 
recovery will proceed only slowly. Accordingly, the

Communists, promising real political, economic, and 
social reform appear to many as the only credible 
alternative 
53. A third alternative to Marcos and the Commu-
nists is the moderate opposition. Unfortunately, the 
moderate opposition is divided and lacks extensive 
grassroots organization. There is, however, a differ-
ence of view on its near-term prospects. Some believe 
that over the past two years the moderate opposition 
has gained credibility and momentum and point to its 
performance in the 1984 elections as evidence of 
growing strength. Those who hold this view believe 
that a government led by the moderate opposition 
would be committed to reform and?if it came to 
power in time?would have a chance to stabilize the 
deteriorating internal situation. They also believe most 
politically informed Filipinos are guardedly optimistic 
that a government led by the moderate opposition 
would be a step forward. Others believe that absent 
some remedy of the fundamental weaknesses cited 
above and the development of a cohesive program, the 
moderate opposition will have difficulty further ex-
panding its credibility as an alternative to Marcos, 
especially in rural areas where the insurgency is 
strong. Those who hold this view believe the perfor-
mance of the moderate opposition in the 1984 election 
is attributable more to anti-Marcos sentiment than as a 
sign of support for the opposition as a credible alterna-
tive. 
54. The military's response to the NPA is for the 
most part inept and often counterproductive. Given 
the Armed Forces' inadequate funding, poor logistics, 
uncertain leadership, and the politicized nature of the 
officer corps, it is unlikely that the military's perfor-
mance will improve enough to stem increased NPA 
activity in the near term. If the elections planned for 
1986 and 1987 are contentious, fraudulent, and vio-
lent, they will drive more people into the ranks of the 
Communist Party. Although circumstances may 
change, President Marcos intends to remain in office 
beyond 1987 despite the deep-rooted and irreversible 
public antipathy toward him. 
55. The NPA is likely to continue to grow and will 
gradually increase the size and frequency of military 
actions, and improve its military tactics to include 
assaults against better defended targets and expanded 
night operations. We believe government forces may 
soon be forced to cede de facto control of some 
lowland areas and rural highlands to the Communists 
in many regions of the country. 
56. Without improved leadership, training, and lo-
gistic support, the government forces cannot protect 
the population, economic, and strategic targets and 
simultaneously pursue the enemy. The Communists, 
however, cannot hope to achieve a military victory in 
the near future without substantially more arms and 
ammunition than they now possess. If the party does 
arrange for weapons purchases abroad, they must also 
arrange for clandestine arms deliveries to various 
islands in the archipelago. We believe substantial 
deliveries would be difficult to accomplish.

57. Party efforts to join ranks with the MNLF 
insurgents have not, and probably will not, succeed. 
The MNLF is beset with defections, financial prob-
lems, and factionalism along ethnolinguistic lines. Nur 
Misuari, leader of the largest and most radical group, 
the Tausug Muslims, has advocated cooperation with 
the CPP/NPA for some time, but he commands little 
allegiance among Muslim guerrillas outside of Sulu. 
Communist propaganda aimed at the Muslim commu-
nity has not been able to overcome longstanding 
hatreds. Although Misuari may help arrange arms 
purchases for the NPA, we believe there will be little 
cooperation between the two insurgent groups in the 
next three years. Moreover, as the NPA increases 
activity in MNLF areas of operations in Mindanao and 
presents a threat to established MNLF extortion activi-
ties, there will be even more friction and enmity 
between rival insurgent groups. 
59. In sum, we believe that, if the present trend 
continues, within the next three to five years the 
insurgents could stalemate the military in most of the 
countryside and bring widespread urban terrorism to 
the streets of Manila. Between now and the end of the 
decade, we expect to see no improvement in the 
current negative trends: 
? Continued expansion of the areas under 
CPP/NPA control. 
? New military sophistication by the NPA, includ-
ing operations by larger formations of troops. 
? Expanded political infiltration by the CPP. 
We also believe, however, a major governmental crisis 
during the next three to five years could give a 
coalition government dominated by the Communists 
or the Communists themselves an opportunity to seize 
power without first achieving a decisive battlefield 
advantage. 
60. Our bleak prognosis, however, could be altered 
by a number of developments, chief among which 
would be the installation of an effective, reform-
minded, non-Communist government in Manila. This 
could come about as the result of an orderly constitu-
tional succession in the event of Marcos's death, his 
forced removal from office by military coup, or his 
defeat in the 1987 presidential election. Any new non-
Communist government would have an opportunity to 
remedy the country's many ills, and, with an im-
proved economy and a calmer political environment, a 
reduction of the Communist appeal would be within 
reach. At the same time, any successor government 
would face most of the same formidable problems 
confronting Marcos?and without his experience or 
other assets. Whether a new government could make 
more headway against the insur ency or economic 
problems is an open question 
61. Other developments that could alter our bleak 
prognosis would: 
? Require Marcos to undertake steps we believe 
are unlikely: 
- Credible 1986 and 1987 elections. 
- A coordinated national counterinsurgency 
strategy being adopted and vigorously 
pursued. 
- The AFP receiving adequate funding for 
force expansion, counterinsurgency training, 
additional mobility assets, and communica-
tions gear. 
? Or require tactical mistakes by the Communists: 
- The CPP/NPA experiencing unresolved lead-
ership struggles that sap the vitality of the 
insurgency. 
- Widespread repressive control measures and 
heavy taxation undermining the insurgents' 
support in the countryside. 
- Excessive urban violence in Manila arousing 
strong public criticism and renewed support 
for the government. 
- Losing their nationalist credentials and claim 
of independence by relying heavily on out-
side powers for support. 
- Miscalculating NPA strengths and AFP weak-
nesses by mounting a strategic offensive pre-
maturely.

Implications for US Interests 
62. The current situation could evolve into a pro-
longed period of "civil war," with the government 
increasingly hard-pressed, serious terrorist and insur-
gent attacks on US persons and installations, growing 
anti-Americanism, and a period of hard choices for the 
United States?including if and when to abandon 
Marcos. Even if the Communists ruled out direct 
attack on US citizens, increased violence would pose a 
substantial danger to the almost 100,000 Americans in 
the islands and US economic interests there. Under 
these circumstances US efforts to prop up Marcos 
probably would be counterproductive in that the 
United States would be seen by most Filipinos as 
supporting an unpopular dictator. As long as Marcos 
remains in power, we see little prospect for success 
against the insurgents. At best US aid might retard 
Communist expansion 
63. A Communist takeover in the Philippines or a 
government heavily influenced by the CPP would be 
viewed by Asian countries?particularly the other 
ASEAN countries and China?as a setback of historic 
proportions, perhaps even more devastating than the 
US defeat in Vietnam. Besides the loss of US bases, it 
could also mean a significant loss of US credibility and 
prestige. Among other results likely to follow a 
CPP/NPA takeover are: 
? US forward-basing strategy would suffer due to 
loss of the bases, and US power-projection capa-
bility would be adversely impacted. 
? The Philippines might permit Soviet access to the 
military facilities?at a price?thereby increas-
ing Soviet influence in the region and diminish-
ing the United States'. This would pose a signifi-
cant strategic threat to US friends and allies in 
the region 
Threat to US Facilities and Personnel 
We do not consider the principal threat to US bases 
in the Philippines to be military. Rather, Communist 
Party propaganda?citing the presence of US military 
facilities on Philippine soil as the most visible manifes-
tation of America's imperialist intentions and an affront 
to Philippine sovereignty?aims to make continued US 
use of the bases politically untenable in the eyes of any 
future government. The CPP, however, is not the only 
source of the anti-US-bases movement. Respected non-
Communist, nationalist political leaders of the pre-
martial-law period have also called for removal of the 
bases. To avoid charges of serving the interest of -US 
imperialism,- any successor government may have to 
demand either renegotiation of the bases agreement on 
terms more favorable  to the Philippines or the abroga-
tion of the agreement 
A direct attack on one of the bases or ancillary 
facilities is possible?and threats of military or terrorist 
action have been received?but the NPA is much more 
likely to selectively target US personnel or attempt to 
place bombs in US installations. Direct assaults against 
the bases by guerrilla units would, in the near future, be 
counterproductive and costly. The NPA leadership is 
aware of their limited firepower, lack of fire support, 
and the difficulty of secretly massing troops for a 
surprise attack in Central Luzon. Party leaders also 
realize that such action would justify increased US 
military actions. Limited weapons and ammunition-
stealing operations cannot be ruled out. 
Assassination of Americans, on the other hand, could 
easily be accomplished by trained NPA sparrow units. 
Such attacks were planned by party leaders in 1977 and 
1979 but were thwarted by US countermeasures. Some 
of these party leaders are still in power. NPA leaders 
have repeatedly said they will target US personnel if the 
United States provides expanded counterinsurgency as-
sistance to Manila.
