 East Asia:  Short-Term Prospects
 Summary
 Developments in East Asia over the next
 several months are unlikely to impinge
 significantly on US interests.  Washington's
 major bilateral relationships with Japan and
 China should remain on course, and continued
 economic recovery throughout most of East Asia
 .should ease some domestic frictions and
 bilateral trade problems, at least, in the
 short run.  Moscow, of course,. will remain
 alert for opportunities to expand its
 influence, but we foresee no shift in Soviet
 strategy that could alter the security
 .       framework in the region.
 There are', however, Some possible developments that could
 seriously affect US interests.  Washington's relations with
 Manila, for example, would be severely strained if an
 unconstitutional regime seized power following the death or
 incapacitation of President Marcos--particularly in light of a
 pending US Congressional review of assistance to the
 Philippines.  South Korea, shaken last year by the KAL shootdown
 and the bombing in Rangoon, faces the prospect of a dialogue on
 the future of the peninsula that would involve its vital national
 security interests.
 This memorandum offers some speculation on these and similar
 possibilities, while briefly reviewing some of the longer range
 trends that will continue to affect US interest in the region.
 This memorandum was prepared by the Office of East Asian
 Analysis.

 Major Bilateral Relationships..
 China.  Premier Zhao's recent visit to Washington and
 Beijing's treatment of it give clear indications that China wants
 to establish a smoother working relationship with the Reagan
 administration in 1984 in order to place Sino-US relations on a
 more solid foundation.  The Chinese apparently believe that the
 President's reelection chances are good and that they must
 establish close and effective ties to him.
 In addition to its economic and technology needs, Beijing
 also has strategic concerns in mind.  Chinese officials have
 conceded privately that China has not been able to improve its
 position in the Sino-Soviet-US triangle and has even lost
 ground.  They fear that the United States continues to underrate
 China's importance and may believe that the Sino-Soviet talks
 have reached          n securit  issues.  In any event, the
 Chinese hope                                    hat
 strengthening relations with t e Uni e   a es wi 1 improve their
 position between Moscow and Washington, and enhance their access
 to US technology and markets.  Indeed, because it is an election
 year in the United States, Beijing also may believe that it has
 increased leverage with the administration on key bilateral
 issues and will probably press for more advanced technolo
 including arms technology, before the President's visit.
 The one factor that could disrupt the relationship is
 Chinese sensitivity about US arms sales to Taiwan.  The intensity
 of the Chinese reaction would depend on US handling of such
 sales, including the extent of the publicity, as well as
 Beijing's estimate of the impact of the arms on Taiwan's armed
 forces and on China's domestic political situation.  If Deng
 Xiaoping and other senior Chinese leaders concluded that the
 weapons sales would expose them to severe domestic criticism,
 they would react sharply.
 The Chinese, however, clearly want to avoid controversy over
 Taiwan.  They will probably to try to mute differences with the
 administration over Taiwan until US elections are over, while
 continuing to prod Washington to observe the joint communique.
 Overall, we believe that strategic and economic
 considerations will govern the substance of China's policy toward
 the United States over the coming year.  Although there may be
 debate in the leadership over the precise level of China's
 relations with the United States and the Soviet Union and over
 China's tactics in the triangle, there appears to be liter
 .fundamental disagreement over the opening to the west.

 Japan.  As for the economic issues to be addressed by
 Washington and Tokyo during the coming months, we believe that:
 --   Japanese leaders realize that they must negotiate
 seriously in order to ease economic strains in the
 relationship, particularly during a US election year.
 --   Their ability to make concessions has been only
 marginally restricted--if at all--by their electoral
 setback in December.
 Even so, Japan's current account and its trade surplus
 with the United States will be even larger this year.
 The extent to which the US-Japanese relationship
 becomes a campaign issue in the United States may, in
 the final analysis, depend more on the state of the US
 economy than on the amount of progress on the issues.
 Mindful that election year pressures in the United States
 could lead to more overt protectionism, Japanese leaders are
 trying to build a credible record of progress in negotiating with
 the United States during the next few months in order to
 strengthen the proposition that cooperation is the best way to
 deal with bilateral economic problems.  They also hope, however,
 that Washington shares this notion and will not risk serious
 friction by pressing for major concessions.
 Prime Minister Nakasone's new government is politically
 stronger than most would have projected immediately after the
 setback the Liberal Democrats suffered in the December
 elections.  Nakasone is in reasonably good position to deal with
 bilateral issues, most of which do not have to involve review by
 the Diet.  Military spending has been set for this fiscal year,
 and the next major decision on defense will come this summer when
 Japanese leaders must seriously consider whether to abandon the
 traditional limitation of one per cent of GNP on the military
 budget.  Until then, Nakasone will probably maintain the lower
 public profile on security issues that he adopted in mid-1983
 when his forward leaning posture threatened to become
 counterproductive.
 Nakasone's ability to make concessions on economic issues
 remains limited, however; more by the traditional domestic
 pressure groups--especially in agriculture--than by the lower
 number of seats his party holds in the Diet.  In any event, Tokyo
 will avoid major concessions.  In addition to the domestic
 backlash such moves might arouse, Japanese leaders by tradition
 are inclined to move incrementally.  They further believe that
 the nature of the issues necessitates a continuous negotiating
 process and that Japan's trade surplus with the United States
 de
 .
 will grow this year no matter what concessions are ma
 ~~?

 Over the next few months, Nakasone will probably profit from
 a relatively united Liberal Democratic Party.  This could begin
 to change by summer as potential contenders in party elections
 for president--and hence prime minister--in November look for
 ways to challenge Nakasone.  If factional maneuvering began to
 undercut his leadership, Nakasone could threaten to hold another
 Lower House election.  He reportedly would prefer to avoid one,
 even though the Liberal Democrats would probably regain some of
 the seats lost in December.  In any event, a summer election in
 .laDan would disrupt ongoing negotiations with Washington.
 Succession Politics
 The endemic problem of succession politics will probably
 manifest itself somewhere in East Asia this year.  The list of
 possibilities is long, including North or South Korea, China,
 Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Burma.  The sudden
 departure of the top leader in any of these countries would bring
 political uncertainty and could lead to a crisis.  With one or
 two exceptions, however, political changes of this nature would
 be unlikely to impinge dramatically on the United States.
 The most obvious exception is the Philippines, where a
 succession struggle is already under way.  The death or
 incapacitation of President Marcos would force the succession
 issue at a time moderate opposition groups would be unprepared to
 gain from it.  Indeed, the odds of a military coup and/or a bid
 for power by Mrs. Marcos would rise appreciably.  Should an
 unconstitutional regime seize power, Washington's relationship
 with Manila would come under considerable strain, in part because
 a US Congressional review of a military bases compensation
 package providing military and economic assistance to~_h_e
 Philippines would probably be under way at the time.
 Another exception is Korea.  The mutual antipathy on the
 divided peninsula makes political uncertainty--in the north or
 the south--especially dangerous.  Indeed, the death of Kim I1-
 song would almost certainly lead to considerable anxiety and
 tension throughout the peninsula.  Kim has been grooming his son
 to succeed him, but his succession is by no means assured.  A
 "palace struggle"--as opposed to a widespread breakdown in
 order--is therefore possible; if it were prolonged, serious
 factional conflict could develop and at least some South Korean
 leaders would be tempted to interfere.  We believe that any major
 changes in North Korean policy would occur only after a successor
 had consolidated his authority, and that this process will prove
 to be relatively long.  No successor is likely to amass the power
 wielded by Kim I1-song.
 In the South, constitutional provisions for an emergency
 succession appear no more promising or 'durable than they did
 under President Park.  If Chun were assassinated, the army would
 probably once more impose martial law and assume control while

 contemplating a successor from within its ranks.  Although we do
 not believe the sweeping leadership changes that occurred after
 Park's death would not be repeated, the transition would give
 Pyongyang an opportunity to try to exploit.
 Although of considerable importance in the longer run,
 succession politics on Taiwan are not likely to generate
 immediate problems.  In an effort to create a stable succession,
 Chiang Ching-kuo has personally orchestrated the inclusion of
 increasing numbers of ethnic Taiwanese into the party and
 government.  There is, however, no clear cut successor--
 especially since Premier Sun suffered a stroke in February--and
 there is a slight chance that Chiang's abrupt departure from the
 scene could undo his plans for a consensual succession with
 significant Taiwanese involvement.  On the other side of the
 Taiwan Strait, Chiang's death would increase apprehensions in
 Beijing about its prospects for dealing .with a leadershia no
 longer dominated by fellow mainlanders.
 Should Deng Xiaoping die in the near future, his leadership
 of China would probably pass to one of his generational peers, a
 member of the old guard whose seniority and personal connections
 approximate Deng's.  We believe the leadership would avoid a
 divisive power struggle and that the younger Hu Yaobang would
 remain titular head of the party, presiding rather than ruling,
 much as he does under Deng.  Still, political tensions and
 infighting would be likely to grow, with some negative
 implications for foreign policy.  During previous periods of
 domestic uncertainty, Beijing has tended to become more rigid on
 foreign policy and the leadership has reacted more sharply to
 real or imagined provocations from abroad.
 New leaders in Indonesia and Burma would almost certainly
 come from the military given the predominance of that institution
 in both countries.  Whether or not the succession process was
 relatively smooth, it is difficult to foresee a new leader in
 either country making a fundamental change in policy direction,
 or a situation developing that could affect US elections.
 Elsewhere in the region, a political shakeup is at least possible
 in Malaysia because of a national bank scandal, and a Labor Party
 victory is also possible in New Zealand although elections there
 are unlikely to precede those in the United States.
 The Economic Outlook
 The economic outlook in East Asia this year is perhaps more
 promising than in any other region.  Ind~ed, South Korea, Taiwan,
 mers
 f
 i
 or
 c per
 and Singapore should rank among the very best econom
 in the world.  Overall, however, activity will not expand at
 traditional rates and there are some major long-term problems.

 i                          i
 The economic growth outlook in Tokyo is better than it has
 been since the late 1970s.  Most forecasters expect GNP growth to
 top 4 percent.  Domestic demand increased in late 1983 as private
 consumption picked up and private housing investment rebounded.
 The strength of the domestic recovery should boost imports and
 help keep the trade surplus from getting further out of hand.
 But Tokyo will be faced all year with record breaking surpluses,
 and will be struggling to contain protectionist forces abroad.
 The Chinese economy is expected to continue growing at a
 relatively rapid pace, with agriculture and industry both
 performing well.  In view of their favorable balance of payments
 position, the Chinese are expected to relax import restric
 this year but will probably retain a modest trade surplus.-~~~~5
 The Australian economy should rebound sharply from its
 negative growth in 1983.  Inflation should drop appreciably,
 although unemployment will probably remain high for another 2 to
 -                         -- --~
 and real unemployment will continue to be a major problem.        25X1
 The Philippines presents a sharp exception to this generally
 promising outlook. Manila is already in the midst of a major
 economic crisis and is rescheduling its foreign debt.  Although
 growth prospects are reasonably good in Thailand and Indonesia,
 both could come under some pressure from their foreign debts if
 the international economic recovery falters.  Even South Korea,
 with its excellent performance record and credit rating, is
 potentially vulnerable to a cutback in private bank lending
 because of its $40 billion foreign debt--the third largest among
 developing countries--about one third of which is short term.
 Economic links between the United States and East Asia
 continue to grow, but with some worrisome trends all too
 evident.  Last year, East Asian countries accounted for about 30
 percent of total US trade, compared with about 24 percent ten
 years earlier.  The value of US trade with East Asia last year
 amounted to $135.billion; ten years earlier, total US trade was
 about $140 billion.  For more than a decade, t-Fie United States
 has run a trade deficit with East Asia--one that is steadily
 mounting.  Ten years ago, the ratio of US imports to exports
 (from and to East Asia) was 1.1 to 1; last year, that ratio had
 reached 1.7 to 1.
 Trends in the trade of manufactured goods are especially
 noteworthy.  Last year, East Asia provided about 47 percent of
 all US imports of manufactured goods, up from 33 percent a decade
 ago.  In 1983, the value of East Asian manufactured goods
 imported by the United States came to $72.3 billion, compared
 with total US manufactured imports of about $41 billion a decade
 ago.  The ratio of US-manufactured imports to exports (from and

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/02/22 :CIA-RDP04T00367R000201430001-3
 ?        to East Asia) ran about 1.9 to 1 ten years ago; in 1983, it was
 2.4 to 1.
 Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan constitute the
 overwhelming proportion of East Asian manufactured trade with the
 United States.  Together, they provided over 40 percent of all US
 imports of manufactured goods last year; their combined surplus
 with the United States in this category totaled $46.7 billion--
 $12 billion more than the overall US trade deficit with the
 entire region.
 In time, the complaint often heard in the United States
 about Japan--that it gets a free ride on defense only to take
 advantage in trade--may be extended more broadly to the region.
 In any event, the basic dichotomy that has long marked East
 Asia--growing economic prowess and continued reliance on the
 United States for security--continues to hold. and arobabl.y will
 only become more pronounced in the future.
 Regional Security
 Moscow's gradual yet sustained military buildup remains a
 key dynamic in the regional security setting.  Since 1978, the
 USSR has concentrated on the deployment of strategic weapons--
 nuclear armed submarines and aircraft, and more recently SS-20
 missiles.  Overall, the buildup appears designed to counter US,
 Japanese, and Chinese forces, either separately or in alliance.
 For that very reason, the Soviet buildup has been a major factor
 impelling China, Japan, and the United States toward closer
 cooperation.  On the diplomatic level, Moscow has been primarily
 concerned with deterring and, if possible, reversing the
 development of such cooperation.  In doing so, the USSR has taken
 a hard line toward Japan--in light of its longstanding alliance
 with the United States--and a notably more flexible approach
 toward China.
 Moscow, however, appears to face a dilemma in attempting to
 make real progress in Sino-Soviet relations while also dealing
 with the United States and Japan.  To substantially improve
 relations with Beijing, the Soviets must negotiate security.
 issues important to the Chinese, e.g., reducing forces near their
 common border.  At the same time, they now face a US military
 presence in the region that is increasing for the first time
 since the 1960s and that is being augmented by better equipped
 Japanese forces.  Indeed, the Soviets have impressed upon the
 Chinese that there can be no discussion of Soviet forces in the
 Far East without considering the presence of US and Japanese
 forces in the region.
 Nonetheless, we expect Moscow to persist on its present
 course without giving up any real ground to the Chinese.  If so,
 the problem in time will clearly shift to the Chinese side, e.g.,
 whether to continue Sino-Soviet talks in the face of a seeemingly
 endless Soviet force buildup.  Since the talks began over a year

 ago, for example, Moscow has created an additional division on
 the Chinese border, deployed a bomber squadron to Vietnam for the
 first time, and continued its deployment of SS-20s in the Soviet
 Far East.  The evidence suggests that Beijing is still prepared
 to be patient in dealing with Moscow, but we wonder how long this
 Although Moscow's relations with Pyongyang have been
 distant for some time, there have been some indications of a
 warming trend over the past year.  More recently, Soviet
 officials have said that a marked improvement in relations will
 occur this year.  If a thaw does take place, the Soviets might
 provide a strong endorsement of North Korea's proposal for talks
 with the United States and South Korea.  They have been
 circumspect about the proposal so far, probably because of some
 initial confusion about its origin.  But North Korea's objective
 in talking with the United States--a peace treaty leading to the
 withdrawal of all US forces from South Korea--is one Moscow fully
 For their part, the North Koreans probably will persist with
 their proposal in the hope that it will become a campaign issue
 in the United States.  They may also perceive a potentially
 exploitable difference between the essentially non-committal US
 response and the strongly negative South Korean reaction to their
 proposal for three-way talks.  In addition, the current emphasis
 on diplomacy is a useful way for Pyongyang to blur memories of
 the Rangoon bombing.  As a result, the North will probably
 continue to publicize its offer, seeking bilateral contacts with
 the United States, and subtly denigrating South Korea.
 In the South, popular emotions stirred by the KAL shootdown
 and the Rangoon bombing last year could be fueled further if a
 dialogue on Korea does develop.  The importance of the issues
 involved--the US security commitment to Seoul as well as
 reunification itself--is both broadly shared and deeply felt.
 Indeed, the speed with which Seoul withdrew its approval of
 three-way talks--once they were proposed by the North--reflects
 considerable sensitivity over any discussions between the United
 States and North Korea about security conditions on the
 peninsula.  In our view, South Korean leaders firmly believe
 that, barring a fundamental change in North Korean policy that
 would include a far smaller share of resources for the military,
 there is no real alternative to the US security commitment and
 the presence of US forces in the South.
 This conviction would generate a certain level of anxiety
 among South Koreans whether talks were three-way or involved
 additional parties.  Another potential problem facing Seoul
 should talks begin is the prospect of different approaches
 surfacing in the South over the issues involved.  Public
 divisiveness and resulting tensions could become severe if they

 pitted the government on one side and a substantial group  e~ d by
 someone like opposition leader Kim Dae-Jung on the other.
 In Southeast Asia, the impasse over Kampuchea seems likely
 to continue.  Although it can be argued that no one is entirely
 satisfied with the current situation, it also seems clear that no
 party is about to conclude that a major change in strategy would
 be in its best interest.  Relations between Hanoi and Moscow
 appear firmly in place as does the cooperative effort between
 Thailand and China.  In contrast, Sino-Vietnamese relations
 appear as frigid as ever, with the Chinese applying more military
 and psychological pressure on the Sino-Vietnamese border than
 they did last year.
 Thus far this dry season, Hanoi has refrained from major
 military operations along the Thai-Kampuchean border in order to
 emphasize its interest in a dialogue with ASEAN.  There has been
 no real give in Hanoi's position on the issues however, nor is
 any change likely within ASEAN.  As a result, Hanoi's diplomatic
 probing could end with Foreign Minister Thach's recent tour
 through ASEAN and Australia.
 Meanwhile, Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchean (DK) forces have
 become more aggressive.  Helped both by increased Chinese
 military assistance and the absence of a Vietnamese dry season
 offensive, they have struck Vietnamese positions near the border
 and deeper in the interior.  However Hanoi weighs the results of
 its diplomatic efforts, it will so   r later have to deal with
 the increased DK military effort.
 If the DK continues to grow, it could prove to be as much of
 a problem for ASEAN as for the Vietnamese.  It is possible, for
 example, that the increasing disparity between the military
 capabilities of the DK and the non-Communist Kampuchean
 resistance forces will lead a majority within ASEAN to question
 seriously whether the non-Communists will ever be able to play a
 meaningful role.  In such an event, ASEAN could be expected to
 intensify pressure on the United States to provide direct
 military assistance to non-Communist forces, or alternately, to
 begin exploring an accommodation wit     that would severely
 strain ASEAN's relations with China.
