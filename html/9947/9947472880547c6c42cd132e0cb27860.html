 them most directly.
 Mr. Chairman, although I feel that
 this section of the bill is without ques-
 tion unconstitutional, I do not believe
 it to be any more unconstitutional than
 the rest of this bill.
 In 1963 Supreme Court Justice Harlan
 stated in the case of Peterson against
 Greenville :
 Freedom of the individual to choose his
 associates or his neighbors, to use and dis-
 rose of his property as he sees fit, to be
 irrational, arbitrary, capricious even unjust
 in his personal relations are things all en-
 titled to a large measure of protection from
 government interference.
 This language states as clearly as pos-
 sible that the Federal Government has
 no business telling a person to whom he
 may or may not sell his home.               CORRECTION OF ROLLCALL

 But while you're thinking of how good
 things would be, you might also stop and
 remember the some 4,500 boys who have al-
 ready paid the supreme price, their lives.
 You might also think of the thousands who
 have been wounded, many crippled for life,
 because while people in this country protest,
 hold marches and demonstrations, burn draft
 cards and write their  congressman about
 how bad and awful this war is (these men,
 who several months ago, in a great many
 cases, hadn't even seen an M-14 or a 45, who
 knew no more about the ways and means of
 war than about the man in the moon, much
 less places such as Chu-1i, DaNang or even
 Viet Nam itself) were and still are fighting
 and dying in a war of which few even know
 how it started.  But yet, you could ask any
 one of them why they were there and behind
 every reason would be an answer similar

 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, a con-
 stituent and good friend, Lee Durieux, of
 Mount Vernon, Ohio, was in town last
 week, He left his mark. He was attend-
 ing a meeting of the International Plat-
 form Association and was present when
 Dean Rusk opened up a session to ques-
 tions and answers.  Lee offered the ques-
 tion :                         -
 Why don't we bomb the port of Haiphong-
 and to hell with Russian shipping?
 What Mr. Durieux did not expect, how-
 ever, was the evasive and questionable
 answer which the Secretary _ of State
 gave.
 My constituent came up with about the
 best summation of the handling of the
 Vietnamese war that I have seen as yet.
 He noted:
 It is like a mackerel hanging in the moon-
 light-it shines and stinks.
 To clarify the matter, Mr. Durieux
 wrote to Drew Pearson.  A copy of his
 letter follows. It is a good summation of
 what many Americans from our part of
 the country are thinking.  Congratula-
 tions, Lee, and please come to Washing-
 ton more often:
 WASHINGTON, D.C.,
 July 23, 1966.
 MR. DREW PEARSON: Yesterday after Dean
 Rusk's speech, I handed you a card with the
 question, "Why don't we bomb the port of
 Haiphong-and to hell with Russian ship-
 ping?"  I note that this made headlines in
 the newspapers.
 I was, however, disappointed with Rusk's
 answer even though I feel he was the top
 speaker so far in the IPA.
 I too was a flier during WW II and can re-
 call that we had more than a dozen places
 like Vietnam to conquer, but in those days we
 went in to win!  Therefore, you can under-
 stand my bluntness and inability to compre-
 hend this "half-vast" war in Vietnam!
 I have two sons in college; one of which
 is going into the army in 2 weeks-the other
 carries a draft card.  I would prefer that
 these sons go into the service to end this
 war, not a part of appeasement and delayed
 action.. I would like for Mr. Rusk to name
 one instance since 1945 that the Communists
 haven't backed down when we showed sin-
 cerity and force!  I would even go so far as
 to state that I would like to see us dare
 China to come into this war just for an
 opportunity to knock out their atomic in-
 stallations before the day comes that we all
 know will come when they will be able to
 "deliver" these weapons.
 I have always admired your comments and
 editorials; I also feel you have been a god-
 send to the IPA.
 Sincerely,
 lions of our fellow citizens who live on
 fixed incomes. Today, I have introduced
 two bills which are directed particularly
 at the needs of this group of people-
 the aging.
 This past year I have had the privi-
 lege of serving on the Republican Na-
 tional Task Force on the Problems of
 the Aging. If there is any one fact which
 stood out in the course of our investiga-
 tions, it is the fact that inflation and the
 consequent rise in living costs have often
 brought harsh and dire consequences to
 our senior citizens.
 Inflation steals from everyone, but
 those who live on pensions and fixed in-
 comes are especially hurt.  When infla-
 tion takes place, the purchasing power of
 the dollar goes down.  Money that has
 been allocated to the later years of one's
 life often becomes inadequate in meeting
 unforeseen increases in the cost of vital
 goods and services.
 Congress has not remained entirely
 oblivious to this problem in the past.
 The social security and the railroad re-
 tirement programs have had their bene-
 fits raised periodically.  However, these
 increases have been sporatic and uneven.
 Between these increases, there has usu-
 ally existed a period during which the
 purchasing power of the pensioners' dol-
 lar has drastically declined. For exam-
 ple, our task force found that between
 1956 and 1964 inflation cost social secu-
 rity pensioners approximately $1.4 billion
 in loss of purchasing power.
 Statistics such as this are alarming,
 but not nearly as alarming as the dep-
 rivation suffered by those of the aging
 who cannot keep pace with the rising
 cost of living.  Mr. Speaker, I believe
 that my two bills will directly aid those
 caught in this squeeze.
 Our task force recommended that the
 Social Security Act and the Railroad Re-
 tirement Act be amended to provide an
 automatic increase in their insurance
 benefits which is tied to increase in
 the Consumer Price Index, the principal
 indicator of inflation.  My bills are de-
 signed to accomplish this objective by
 raising those benefits when there is a 3-
 percent cost-of-living increase.,
 I am pleased to note that the Repub-
 lican leadership in the House of Repre-
 sentatives have joined our efforts to
 achieve these goals.  Enactment of my
 twin proposals is essential if we are to
 meet the needs of the aging.
 Mr. Speaker, under my proposal the
 increased benefits will not necessitate an

 it has its bright prospects and bad ones.  It

 HORTON SUBMITS BILLS TO HELP
 AGING  KEEP PACE  WITH                     IN-
 CREASES IN COST OF LIVING
 (Mr. HORTON asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. HORTON.  Mr. Speaker, increases
 in the cost of living are a concern to all
 increase in taxes.  Inflation brings with
 it increased wages.  In turn, increased
 wages will naturally bring increased pay-
 ments into social security and, addition-
 ally, the benefits paid represent a smaller
 proportion of an individual's wages as
 his wages approach the maximum limit-
 $6,600.  Therefore, because of these fac-
 tors, there will be no increase in payroll
 deductions to finance my proposal.
 I believe that my bills, if passed, will
 have an immediate and immensely bene-
 ficial impact on our senior citizens. Mr.
 Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to sup-
 port these bills. We need to act immedi-
 ately if we are to meet the present needs
 JIM FARLEY AT 78
 (Mr. JOELSON asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the body of the RECORD and to
 include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. JOELSON. Mr. Speaker, because
 of the admiration which we all feel for
 James A. Farley, I am sure my colleagues
 will enjoy reading the following article
 about him by Ernest Cuneo. It appeared
 in many papers, and was published by
 the Morning Call in the congressional
 district which I represent on May 31,
 1966.  It is good to know that "Jim"
 Farley is still going strong, and I am sure
 that we all wish him many more years of
 success and accomplishment.
 The article follows:
 NEW YORK.-Big Jim Farley was 78 years
 old yesterday.  He celebrated with his usual
 78-hour work week.  Since his last birthday
 he has attended 125 dinners and 70 luncheons
 at many of which he was principal speaker.
 He also traveled 60,000 miles by land, sea,
 and air, visiting 20 countries, including all
 European capitals, all Central American capi-
 tals, and the principal cities of Mexico.  He
 reads the box scores of every major league
 ball game-without glasses-as part of his
 habit of reading at least four newspapers
 every day.  He is 6 feet 3 inches tall, literally
 in the well-known pink, and his 205 pounds
 haven't varied in the last 20 years.
 He has a most peculiar walk, one of very
 quick and very short steps.   His towering
 figure seems to scoot through the New York
 winds, in spite of the fact that it is inter-
 rupted every 10 paces by some one who wants
 to shake his hand.  Perhaps no man since
 Daniel Webster's Boston has so much received
 the adulation of a city. New Yorkers give him
 the respect accorded Al Smith and the affec-
 tion bestowed on Jimmy Walker.
 There is an astonishing simplicity about
 this most sophisticated of men.  He still has
 the clean wholesomeness of the lanky coun-
 try boy who played first base for the town
 team 60 years ago.  He brought this same
 zest to politics.  The Democratic Party was
 his team, and he gave it all he had.
 From 8 every morning till 6 at night, he's
 in there pitching for his current team, Coca-
 Cola Export.  He's head of it, but he puts on
 no airs.  He calls himself a salesman, and sell
 he does.
 Jim was the second of five boys.  His father
 was a Hudson River schooner captain, sailing
 bricks down to New York City. He prospered.
 He bought two small brickyards.     But just
 before Jim was 10, his father went out to
 harness the horse to go to a neighbor's fu-
 neral.  The halter was long, the horse frisky.
 Suddenly wheeling, he kicked Captain Farley
 in the chest.  He died that night.
 Ellen Goldrick Farley, Jim's mother, would
 run neither a schooner nor brickyards.    Cap-
 tain Farley left no debts, small assets, sturdy
 bodies,  an    honorable  name,  and  a  great
 mother   for   his  boys.   Jim  promised  his
 mother he would never touch an alcoholic
 drink, and he never has.     He doesn't smoke
 either.  These are tremendous advantages for
 a man to bring to the hard-dealing games in
 the smoke-filled rooms of politics.
 Jim wanted to be Town Clerk.  An Irish-
 American Catholic Democrat stood as much
 chance in the rock-ribbed Republican town
 of Grassy Point then as Mao Tse-tung stands
 of being elected Governor of Utah now.  But
 Jim took to the mails.  Apparently Republi-
 cans                                                                                                                          like  to receive  letters  because      they

 States, then practically a concomitant of be-

 Committee.  He deserved it as its chief cus-
 tomer alone.                     Being at the head of the Post
 Office Department did not soothe his letter-
 writing propensities; it inflamed them.  Fol-
 lowing the 1932 campaign, he signed 22,000
 first-name letters of thanks; In 1936, 27,000.
 And not when he got around to it; immedi-
 ately.  Within a week after election, there
 were 27,000 families in thousands of cities
 and villages proudly exhibiting the letters of
 thanks with the famous green-ink signature.
 HOW TO SUCCEED
 Parley, a boy who never graduated from
 high school, has 22 honorary degrees.  He,
 with President Herbert Hoover, were the two
 distinguished members of both parties select-
 ed to reorganize the United States executive
 department.  He has served on New York
 State's sacrosanct Banking Commission, and
 its Boxing Commission, and is currently on
 its Racing Commission. He can discuss as an
 expert whether foreign trade will expand (he
 thinks it will multiply) or whether Mickey
 Mantle is swinging too hard (he thinks he is).
 About 10,000 letters will pour Into his office
 this week.  The whole world waved to Jim
 Farley on his birthday.
 And Big Jim beams back.  To him this is a
 great big wonderful world.
 THE IRS AUDITORS' IMAGE
 (Mr. FASCELL asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the body of the RECORD and to
 include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. FASCELL.  Mr. Speaker, the au-
 ditors of the Internal Revenue Service
 often have been depicted as unreason-
 able, almost inhuman automatons, in-
 terested solely in squeezing every pos-
 sible cent from taxpayers,. regardless of
 how far they have to stretch the tax
 laws to do so. I believe it is fair to say
 that that impression has so grown that
 the average taxpayer who has not gone
 through the experience dreads the pos-
 sibility that sometime he will be put
 through the auditing process.  The In-
 ternal Revenue Service has done much
 to attempt to dispel the unfavorable
 image of its audits and auditors, by in-
 sisting that its auditors deal in all fair-
 ness with taxpayers.                     Nevertheless, in-
 stances continue to arise in which IRS
 auditors are accused of overzealousness,
 to the point of ]harassment.
 The May 5, 1966, issue of the Reporter
 magazine contained an article entitled
 "The Tax Appeal Ordeal," in which the
 author, Mr. William R. Frye, detailed
 his experiences with IRS audit proce-
 dures.  Perhaps the author fully sum-
 marized his feelings of what he had been
 through when he said it was "a miser-
 able experience."
 The article follows:
 THE TAX-APPEAL ORDEAL
 (By William R. Frye)
 Pity the poor taxpayer.  He assembles his
 records, studies  the  instructions,  wrestles
 with the forms, pays his tax-and then sits
 back to await doomsday.  Doomsday, for him.,
 is the day Form 3R73 arrives with this mes-
 sage:  "Your above-described tax return or
 document for the year indicated has been
 assigned to the above-named Agent for ex-
 amination.  Please communicate with the
 Agent.. . .
 The possibility of being audited is the third
 dimension  of  the  Income-tax  nightmare.
 Substantiating that office at home, finding
 that Washington hotel bill, proving   that
 lunch was a business entertainment-these
 could be more difficult than making out the
 return itself. They could even be impossible.
 Some sixty-six million personal income-tax
 returns were filed in fiscal 1965; 3,092,000--
 one in twenty, or just over five per cent-
 were "examined," as the Internal Revenue
 Service puts it.  Deficiencies, or taxes due,
 were found in fifty-one per cent of the cases,
 producing $1,063,000,000 in additional rev-
 enue; refunds were paid by the government
 fourteen per cent of the time, for a total of
 $47,052,000.  No change was made in thirty-
 five per cent of the returns.  The average
 deficiency was just below $700; the average
 refund just above $100.  Aside from gamblers
 and other special cases, only 1,216 of those
 who were examined (or 0.04 per cent) were
 prosecuted for fraud.
 How many of the more than 1.5 million
 taxpayers who were made to pay additional
 tax really had short-changed the govern-
 ment, accidentally or intentionally?   How
 many ran afoul of an IRS overeager to maxi-
 mize collections?  The IRS feels sure it was
 practically always right (an understandable
 view), but many taxpayers are by no means
 sure.
 I know how they feel.  I have just been
 through the mill.   Mine was  one of the
 relatively rare cases-one in seven-where
 the taxpayer is found to have overpaid his
 tax.  The return had been prepared for me
 while I was abroad and contained several
 major errors in the governments favor.  I
 was due for a refund.
 It was, nevertheless, a miserable experience.
 Day after day after exhausting day was taken
 up in minutely detailed, repetitive nit-
 pick-ing.  Accountants whom I told about the case
 said that they had never known an audit to
 be so detailed and prolonged.  At the end of
 each session, I was assigned to prepare fur-
 ther data for the next visit-a task requiring
 long days and longer nights, sometimes run-
 ning into weeks.  (Everything involved had
 happened three years before.)   My profes-
 sional life was intermittently disrupted for
 more than seven months. The lost time was
 worth conservatively $4,000 to $5,000-and
 since I was self-employed, I had no way to
 cushion the loss.  Moreover, legal and other
 fees ate up much of the refund.
 The only comic relief was that each time
 I was ordered to dive deeper into the records,
 I came up with a new accounting error in
 the government's favor, and hence a larger
 potential refund.   This was not what the
 agent had in mind. "How am I going to
 justify my time?" he asked.  Finally, as a
 consequence of another of his probes, I dis-
 covered  a $1,500 reimbursement that had
 been reported, both as income and as a credit
 against expense.  Whether by coincidence or
 not, the roof promptly fell in.
 My agent (or his supervisor)  re-opened
 the whole audit and disallowed deductions
 that previously had been fully substantiated.
 The law had not changed; the facts had not
 changed; nothing had, except that someone
 seemed to have decided that letting a tax-
 payer get back that much money would not
 look good at all on the report of such a pro-
 longed audit.
 I could appeal the ruling, first to a "con-
 feree"-a higher official of the IRS--and then,
 if necessary, to a still higher one, I could
 even go to tax court.  But in the process,
 the additional time lost and the new legal
 fees Incurred could more than wipe out any
 tax recovered.  It seemed I would have to
 take the licking; either way, I would lose.
 After considerable additional  dispute,  the
 agent reconsidered and an appeal became
 unnecessary.   But in my bitterer moments,
 I felt my government had subjected me to a
 form of legalized extortion.
 THE HIGH COST OF APPEALS
 A spot check of accounting firms in the
 New York area suggests that thousands of
 taxpayers every year may have similar un-
 pleasant experiences.  Similar, that is, not
 in the denial of refunds that are due but in
 the levying of additional taxes which they
 consider unjustified but which they cannot
 recover economically through the normal ap-
 peal process.  By comparison with the total
 number of returns filed, the number of these
 taxpayers may be small, but to the people
 concerned it is a serious matter.
 Mr. S., a partner in a New York accounting
 firm that specializes in tax work  (because
 of his continuing dealings with the IRS, he
 insisted on remaining anonymous), said he
 used to fight, on behalf of his clients, as
 many  as  fifty  appeals  at  a  time.  But
 in virtually every case, once the appeal was
 over the client was so angry at the size of the
 accounting bill that, whatever the results of
 the appeal, Mr. S. would lose the account.
 So he made it a firm rule never to handle
 appeals.   He now negotiates with the las
 agent as stoutly as posible the first time
 around, and then proposes to the client that
 he accept the outcome, favorable or other-
 wise.  If the taxpayer wants to appeal, some
 other firm must take the case.   His rela-
 tionship to the client is then finished either
 way.
 The effect of this policy is that In cases
 where Mr. S.'s advice is accepted, the gov-
 ernment has been allowed virtually to dic-
 tate its terms to the taxpayer on the issues
 in dispute.  If Mr. S. is right, many if not
 most appeals are too expensive to be practi-
 cal.   Other accountants are not quite so
 sweeping; but they say that unless at least
 $1,500 to $2,000 In tax is involved, the tax-
 payer can scarcely expect to break even from
 an appeal to "conference," even if he wins.
 Unless he feels qualified to handle it on his
 own, he must pay an accountant $50 to $200
 a day, not merely during the conference it-
 self but throughout a period of preparation.
 And the taxpayer's own time is also a, factor.
 Still higher appeals, beyond the conference
 stage, are not considered economical, unless
 something in the neighborhood of $10,000 in
 taxes is involved.  The ras does not release
 figures on how many cases went to confer-
 ence; but In 1965, 21,737 disputes (less than
 one per cent of the total) were handled at
 the appellate level, the next stage, and only
 5,448 (roughly one quarter of one per cent)
 were disposed of by the tax courts.   The
 money In question however, was in the hun-
 dreds of millions.
 The man who decides to do without costly
 help is, in effect, throwing himself on the
 mercy of the IRS.  Mr. C., a partner in a
 Connecticut  consulting  firm,  was  on  the
 road five days a week, year round, returning
 home only for weekends.  He naturally had
 a large travel and entertaintment deduction.
 When the return was selected for audit, he
 could not take time off to attend personally;
 his "billing rate" (the rate at which clients
 were charged for his services)  was $250 a
 day, and he was fully booked.   So he sent
 his wife to the tax auditor, armed with can-
 celed checks and credit-card bills.  The audi-
 tor contended there was not proof the travel
 was not personal, and disallowed the whole
 amount.  The wife did not know how to pro-
 test persuasively.  So the whole year's travel
 was lost.
 This couple could have hired professional
 help, but did not.  Many others cannot af-
 ford to.                                                                                                                                           Few men making less than $15,000
 a year care to pay $15 to $50 an hour for an
 accountant, let alone $25 to $100 an hour for
 a lawyer. A return showing a $4,000 Income
 is not as likely to be examined as one show-
 ing $400,000, but it can happen.  The test,
 the IRS says, Is not the size of the income
 but whether there is anything unusual about
 the return, anything that causes raised eye-
 brows.  If the ax falls, the little men have
 no choice but to fend for themselves.

 STAKES IN VIETNAM
 Mr. SMATHERS. Mr. President, the
 Arizona Republic takes us to the heart
 of the Vietnamese situation in an edi-
 torial commenting on waves of public
 optimism and pessimism over the fight-
 ing in southeast Asia.
 President Johnson  and Secretaries
 Rusk and McNamara have put matters
 into perspective, the newspaper says,
 after an unduly optimistic impression
 sprang from the President's guarded
 news conference remarks early in July.
 Whatever else, the Republic comments,
 Americans should realize that the fight-
 ing is going better for us than for the
 enemy, that a new element of stability
 has asserted itself in Saigon and that a
 campaign of economic and social recon-
 struction is progressing in South Viet-
 nam.
 The stakes are high, says the newspa-
 per-high enough for patience and forti-
 tude at home as well as courage and
 strength on the other side of the Pa-
 ciflc.
 I wish to insert this editorial in the
 RECORD.
 There being no-objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Arizona Republic, July 14, 1966]
 VIETNAM PENDULUM
 President ,fohnson made an optimistic as-
 sessment of the Vietnam war in his July
 4 interview on the ranch.  He said "diplo-
 matic reports" indicate the Communists "no
 longer expect a military victory."  He felt
 the air raids on the oil depots near Hanoi
 and Haiphong had destroyed well over half
 of the  enemy's reserves and equipment.
 "Success will be ours in Vietnam." he said.
 if these guarded statements were parlayed
 into the  general impression that Ho  Chi
 Minh_ was hanging on the ropes and that his
 backers were likely to throw in the towel
 at any minute, that is unfortunate.   For
 such is not the case.
 This week, Secretary of Defense McNa-
 mara put matters into better perspective
 when he told a news conference he was "cau-

 BOMBINGS CLEAR AIR
 Mr. SMATHERS.              Mr. President, the
 Copley newspapers detect a new feeling
 of pride and sense of purpose among the
 American people.
 They suggest it dates from the day our
 planes bombed the oil storage facilities
 near Hanoi and Haiphong.
 The  newspaper  organization  agrees
 with President Johnson that we would
 rather reason than fight, but we never
 run from duty nor desert an ally. The
 air strikes served notice to the enemy
 that the price they may have to pay for
 aggression might not be to their liking.
 And they represent tactical action aimed
 at a quicker honorable peace in Vietnam.
 I offer for the RECORD the Copley edi-
 torial as it appeared in the Elgin, Ill.,
 Daily Courier-News.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 any conditions, the price of the war to him
 must be made untenable.
 The air strikes against oil storage and other
 strategic targets were a plain notice to the
 enemy that the price they might have to
 pay for the war might not be to their liking.
 On a purely military level, the latest air
 strikes undoubtedly hampered the flow of
 supplies to the south and as a result saved
 many American lives by reducing the Viet
 Cong ability to wage war.
 For these reasons, the long delayed air
 strikes are really tactical action for a quicker
 honorable peace in the embattled nation.

 SUMMIT MEETING WITH
 DE GAULLE
 Mr. CHURCH.  Mr. President, this
 week's issue of Newsweek suggests that
 some diplomats, in both Washington and
 Paris, see a good chance for a meeting
 in  September between President de
 Gaulle and President Johnson.  Presi-
 dent De Gaulle has planned a trip
 around the world, stopping in southeast
 Asia to visit Cambodia, and according
 to Newsweek, has scheduled a 48-hour
 stop on the French, Caribbean island of
 Gua eloupe on his way back from the
 Pacific.
 As Senators know, I visited Europe in
 early May. In a report to the Committee
 on Foreign Relations, entitled "Europe
 Today," I made a number of recommen-
 dations. One of them was that effective
 communications must be restored be-
 tween the French and American Govern-
 ments.. I suggested, in this connection, a
 THE DANGER OF EMPIRE MT ASIA
 Mr. CHURCH.  Mr. President, the
 course of the war in Vietnam has begun
 to generate an uneasiness that we may
 be slipping unawares into the role of a
 colonial power in Asia.  A recent edi-
 torial in the July 12 edition of the Lewis-
 ton, Idaho, Morning Tribune raises a
 clear alarm over this possibility. Quot-
 ing two widely respected foreign corre-
 spondents, the editorial concludes with
 the following warning:
 Two American presidents have said this
 must never be permitted to become an Amer-
 ican war.  It not only has become an Ameri-
 can war, but South Vietnam has become an
 American enclave and Southeast Asia has
 become a bog from which we will have a
 most difficult time escaping.  The possibility
 of empire by accident is by no means remote.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD the
 editorial from which I have quoted, en-
 titled "The Danger of Empire in Asia,"
 published in the Lewiston, Idaho, Morn-
 ing Tribune of July 12, 1966.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE DANGER  OF EMPIRE IN ASIA
 Is the United States in danger of stumbling
 into empire in Asia?  C. L. Sulzberger, the
 foreign affairs columnist of The New York
 Times, thinks so, and a reporter's conversa-
 tion with some military officers bears him
 out.
 Sulzberger pointed out in a recent column
 that the United States has plowed millions
 of dollars into Southeast Asia in the form of
 harbor developments,  roads  and  military
 bases.  He believes the temptation may be
 great, once the shooting war ends, to seek to
 protect these enormous investments by main-
 taining a strong American presence there.
 This  would  create  the  danger  "that the
 United States might unoonsciousv create an
 empire in Southeast Asia.  At whatever cost
 we must avoid any absent-minded imperial-
 ism that would not only contradict Amer-
 ica's national philosophy but could lead to
 nothing but trouble."
 One can scarcely argue with Sulzberger's
 point of view.  Yet there are ominous signs
 that some military men on the scene are
 not daunted by the prospects of empire.
 Richard A. Dudman, a roving correspondent
 of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, is writing a
 aeries  of  reports  from  Saigon.  American
 officers in South Viet Nam, he writes, are now
 speaking in terms of 400,000 U.S. troops in
 Southeast Asia by the end of this year and
 possibly 600,000 by the end of 1967.   "Some
 speak seriously of needing a total American
 buildup of 1-million men."  Dudman adds:
 "Carried  to its  logical conclusion,    the
 Americanization of the war could conceivably
 lead to a complete American takeover of
 South Viet Nam.  A widely respected Amer-
 Scan  commander  advocates  this  course
 privately in so many words.
 "'We should occupy and rule this coun-
 try,' he says, 'instead of pretending to respect
 the sovereignty of a government that really
 is  only  temporary and  illegal  and could
 change tomorrow.  It would be more efficient,
 and probably the end result would be better
 if we abandoned the idea of assistance and
 pacification and settled for subjugation, re-
 garding                                                                                                                                           South Viet  Nam     as  an enemy
 country ...' "
 Two American presidents have said this
 must never be permitted to become an Amer-
 ican war.  It not only has become an Amer-
 loan war, but South Viet Nam has become an
 American enclave and Southeast Asia has
 become a bog from which we will have a most
 difficult time escaping.  The possibility of
 empire by accident is by no means remote.-

 EDITORIALS COMMEND 'SENATORS
 BYRD OF WEST VIRGINIA, ERVIN,
 AND DIRKSEN  ,
 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed in
 the RECORD two editorials entitled "BYRD
 Sparks U.S. Promise of Aid To End Race
 Riots" and "Would Lift Confession Bar,"
 published in the Huntington, W. Va.,
 Advertiser of July 26, 1966, and an edi-
 torial entitled "Congratulations to Sen-
 ator DIRKSEN," published in the Chicago
 Tribune of July 18, 1966.
 In connection with the latter editorial,
 the concluding sentence, I believe, is
 very pertinent:
 For  his  successful  leadership  Senator
 DIRKSEN deserves the thanks and congratu-
 lations of the American people.
 I certainly subscribe to that sentiment.
 There being no objection, the edi-
 torials were ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 [From the Huntington (W. Va.) Advertiser,
 July 26, 1966]
 BYRD SPARKS U.S. PROMISE OF-AID To  END
 RACE  RIOTS
 Law-abiding Negroes and responsible civil
 rights workers as well as other conscientious
 citizens will welcome the federal govern-
 ment's promise of assistance to cities har-
 assed by race riots.
 The announcement of federal aid was made
 by Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach
 in response to a letter by Sen. ROBERT C.
 BYRD (D-W.Va.) to President Johnson urging
 him to use the power and prestige of his
 office to stop the outbreaks of "lawless and
 provocative demonstrations."
 Sen. BYRD'S letter declared "There is no
 rational justification for tolerating these in-
 credible attacks on firemen, policemen and
 innocent victims."
 In calling the President's attention to the
 responsibility of the federal government to
 discourage  outbreaks  of  lawlessness,  Sen.
 BYRD was serving the cause of law-abiding
 Negroes as well as the public generally.
 His  statement  that  continued      violence
 would set back the cause of civil rights was
 substantiated in part by the announcement
 from New York that extremism was sharply
 cutting contributions to the more militant
 organizations.
 There are also Indications in Congress that
 riots are causing reluctance to enact the ad-
 ministration's civil rights measure now pend-
 ing.
 Much of the money for civil rights efforts
 has come from northern liberals.  In spite
 of this some of the militant individuals and

 Minerals: Canada's diversified mineral in-
 dustry is pacing the world in growth rate.
 Output has tripled in value since 1950 and
 is expected to approach the 4-billion-dollar
 mark this year as Canada-
 Leads the world in nickel, zinc and asbes-
 tos production.
 Ranks second after the U.S. in total out-
 put of uranium and of molybdenum, a vital
 additive in steel manufacturing.
 Beeps Its place as the world's third biggest
 producer of aluminum.
 Stands fourth in output of lead, fifth in
 copper and iron ore, and sixth in production
 of potash.  Canada ranks ninth in output of
 oil and gas.
 The future, to Canadian geologists and
 mining men, is even more exciting than the
 feverish present.  The potential of Canada's
 mineral wealth Is awesome.  The rush to
 measure it and bring It out of the ground is
 turning the country into the world's biggest
 mining camp.
 Ores: Two big iron-ore bodies, far to the
 north, are getting attention.
 One is on Baffin Island, almost 300 miles
 beyond the Arctic Circle.  There, Baffinland
 Iron Mines has mapped more than 127 mil-
 lion tons of high-grade ore that can be
 shipped directly to mills without upgrading.
 In the Yukon, Crest Exploration, Ltd., a
 subsidiary of Standard Oil of California, has
 located an estimated  11  billion tons of
 medium-grade ore.  The deposits are near
 the Snake River, close to the boundary be-
 tween the Yukon and the Northwest Ter-
 ritories.               A rail line nearly 600 miles long
 would be needed to haul the ore to tide-
 water at Skagway, Alaska, but an existing
 narrow gauge road, the White Pass & Yukon,
 might serve as the final leg, from White-
 horse, Yukon Territory, to Skagway.
 The search for nickel, too, is moving north-
 ward.               A belt of mineralized rock cutting
 across the Ungava Peninsula In northern
 Quebec is believed to hold rich nickel de-
 posits.  Canada now produces 80 per cent
 of the world's nickel, mostly from mines in
 Ontario and Manitoba.
 Metals locked together: Canada's booming
 base-metals industry feeds chiefly from ore
 bodies that produce more than one metal.
 The big nickel deposits in Ontario and
 Manitoba also are major producers of copper
 concentrates.  Zinc, lead and copper-often
 with silver included-are found linked in
 various combinations in the mineralized
 rock that is found throughout Canada.
 Spurred by a worldwide shortage and high
 prices, the search for copper deposits now is
 centering  in  the  mountains  of  British
 Columbia and the Yukon.
 Several copper mines in Western Canada
 already In production are being expanded,
 and a number of new bodies of ore are being
 developed to meet Japanese requirements.
 Production from a deposit found on an
 island in remote Babine Lake in northern
 British Columbia is to start this year at a
 5,000-ton-a-day rate.
 Potash success story: Within the last four
 years, Canada has emerged as a major pro-
 ducer of potash-an ingredient in much of
 the world's fertilizer.
 Thick beds of potash were found far un-
 derground in Saskatchewan by oil drillers.
 During 1965, three companies were In pro-
 duction, two others were sinking shafts or
 wells, and three more had announced major
 potash projects.
 Production in 1965 totaled 1.3 million tons
 of refined potash, either by mining or by a
 process using wells to pump dissolved potash
 to the surface.
 By 1970,   is estimated, 750 million dollars
 will have been invested in developing.  Sas-
 katchewan's potash beds, and Canada will be
 producing 7 million tons of potash, enough
 to make it the world's largest supplier. Re-
 coverable potash in vast Saskatchewan beds
 has been estimated at 60 billion short tons,
 about half the world's known supply.
 Asbestos is another giant Canadian indus-
 try. Asbestos Corporation, Ltd., a major pro-
 ducer with large mines in Quebec, is spend-
 ing 50 million to develop a large deposit at
 Asbestos Hill, 1,100 miles north of Montreal.
 The mine is expected to be turning out
 100,000 tons of asbestos fiber a year in 1970.
 It will be shipped to plants in Canada,
 Britain and the U.S. from Deception Bay, on
 Hudson Strait, during the phort ice-free sea-
 son there.
 Uranium marks time: Canada has the big-
 gest known reserves of uranium--an esti-
 mated 200,000 tons producible at $5 to $10
 a pound.  Even under current conditions of
 relative depression in the uranium market,
 Canadian production is second only to that
 in the U.S.
 Most mines in the major producing areas--
 Beaverlodge, Sask.; Elliot Lake and Bancroft,
 Ont.-are shut down or operating only part
 time.
 Rising world demand, however, is expected
 to revive the uranium-mining industry In
 the  1970s,   Stockpiling  by  the  Canadian
 Government is helping  to     keep the mines
 functioning.
 Forests: Canada leads the world in news-
 print production, ranks second In the pro-
 duction of wood pulp for other paper prod-
 ucts and fourth in output of lumber and
 plywood.
 Exports of Canadian forest products total
 nearly 2 billion dollars.  New mills are being
 built all across Canada to meet the growing
 demand for newsprint and other paper goods.
 Currently, Canadian timber workers cut
 an estimated 8 billion feet of wood annually.
 Experts say the forests of the country could
 sustain an annual yield of 12 billion cubic
 feet under intensive management.
 Oil and gas: Vast quantities of oil and
 natural gas in Canada's sedimentary rock
 provide one of the best guarantees of future
 prosperity.
 "As far down the road as we can see.,"
 says a geologist-executive of the oil industry,
 "Canada will have oil for world markets."
 Present known reserves are set at 7.7 bil-
 lion barrels of oil, enough for 23 years of pro-
 duction at the present rate, and 44.4 trillion
 cubic feet of gas, a 35-year supply.  These are
 the proven reserves of fields that have been in
 production. for some time.
 There are new discoveries in northern Al-
 berta and northeastern British Columbia that
 soon will send the official estimates of reserves
 soaring.
 It is believed that more than a million
 cubic miles of sedimentary rock, of the type
 that bears oil and gas, lies under Canada's
 northern regions.
 On the basis of the North American average
 of production per cubic mile, the oil potential
 of the Yukon Territory is set at 3 billion
 barrels of the Northwest Territories at 13
 billion barrels and of the .Canadian Arctic
 islands at 33 billion barrels.
 Oil from sand: Oil-impregnated sands :fie
 close to the surface under several hundred
 square miles of wilderness along the Atha-
 baska River in northern Alberta.  This "tar
 sand"  can  be  mined  by  strip-mining
 processes.
 Production is to begin next year on a
 limited basis,  Great Canadian Oil Sands
 Ltd., a subsidiary of Sun Oil Company, is
 rushing a 230-million-dollar plant and pipe-
 line system into completion.
 Early next year, the firm will start pump-
 ing 9:5,000 barrels of oil a day through Its
 266-mile pipeline.
 Water: Canada now produces 22 million
 kilowatts of hydroelectric power.  All of it,
 plus 7 million kilowatts produced by ther-
 mal-electric plants, is used by Canada's own
 booming industrial machine.
 Giant new projects are under way in Que-
 bee, British Columbia and Manitoba.  All
 told, U.S. power authorities believe, 7 million
 kilowatts of new hydroelectric power will be
 available for export to the U.S. within the
 next decade.
 Electric power in Canada is now a billion-
 dollar business.  But much of the value of
 the country's hydroelectric resources shows
 up in the form of exports. Canada's position
 as the third-biggest producer of aluminum,
 for instance, is due to its plentiful supply of
 hydroelectric power.
 Canadians are beginning to view their al-
 most limitless flows of fresh water as a val-
 uable source of export dollars.
 Arthur Laing, Minister of Northern Affairs,
 sees water "as one of the prime resources of
 the Yukon-one which I predict in the fu-
 ture will be of equal, if not greater, impor-
 tance than the mining industry
 Two plans are being pushed in the U.S. to
 make use of the waters of the Yukon River-
 the Rampart Dam proposal in north-central
 Alaska and the North American Water Alli-
 ance proposal.
 The latter is a plan advanced by private
 engineering interest with support from some
 western members of Congress.  It would di-
 vert Alaskan and Yukon water southward
 through a network of waterways reaching
 into Mexico and across the plains to the
 Great Lakes.
 The U.S. stake: In the race now going on
 to develop the resources of Canada, the big-
 gest spenders are American firms or their
 Canadian subsidiaries.
 Foreign corporations, mostly from the U.S.,
 already own or control more than half of
 Canada's industry.   American-owned firms
 dominate the oil and gas fields and their
 pipelines.  Nearly 60..per cent of Canada's
 mineral production belongs to outsiders.
 One Canadian leader who welcomes even
 more American investment is Premier W.
 Ross Thatcher of Saskatchewan, who has
 this to say:
 "In the last several years, American capital
 has been responsible for a dramatic trans-
 formation of Saskatcehwan from an impov-
 erished 'have not' province to its present
 position  as  one  of  the  most .... 11
 .
 U.S. companies are spending heavily in
 the search for oil and gas, in developing
 Saskatchewan's rich potash beds, and in cre-
 ating a pulp and paper industry in the
 Province.
 "Had our doors been even partially closed
 to America's capital," Mr. Thatcher says, "we
 would still be one of Canada's backward
 Provinces.  The Government of Saskatche-
 wan, in the months ahead, intends to take
 every practical or feasible step to attract
 additional American investment."
 National policy toward foreign investment
 in  Canadian resources,  and  ownership  of
 those resources, may change in the future.
 But meanwhile in Canada, with the help
 of U.S. dollars, the  biggest deveolpment
 boom of modern times is under way.

 A HELPING HAND-TAX INCENTIVES
 Here are the ways Canada encourages min-
 eral development:
 1. A full write-off of exploration, drilling
 and excavation costs in connection with the
 search for minerals.
 2. Any company with income from min-
 eral production can write off its off-property
 exploration costs against its mineral income.
 New syndicates for mineral exploration can
 write off cost against future mineral income,
 with unlimited carry-forward privileges.
 3. Income from production of new mines
 is exempt from income tax for three years.
 4. Depletion allowance of 331/3 per cent for
 most types of oil, gas, prime-metal and in-
 dustrial-minerals operations on net income.

 Treatment of AmeWans Captured by the
 North Vietnamese
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. STROM THURMOND
 OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Friday, July 29, 1966
 Mr. THURMOND.  Mr. President, on
 Wednesday, July 27, 1966, the Augusta
 Chronicle, Augusta, Ga., published an
 editorial entitled "The Mark of the
 Beast." The editorial concerns itself
 with the treatment of American fliers
 captured by the North Vietnamese and
 reports of executions by beheading.  It
 also takes note of the barbaric actions
 of the Communists who have been shoot-
 ing our wounded on the field of battle.
 This entire area is a most serious prob-
 lem and demands immediate and affirm-
 ative attention.  I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the editorial be printed in the
 Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE MARK OF THE BEAST
 mane"  Communists  summarily  beheaded
 the American they had caught.
 These men, wounded on the battlefield
 or fleeing a prison camp, were beyond com-
 bat status.  They were defenseless, and by
 all the rules of civilized conduct were pris-
 oners.  By the vicious and barbarous way in
 which they were done to death, they join
 many thousands of others in  South Viet
 Nam who have suffered hideous deaths at
 the hands of Communists.  They share the
 fate of village chiefs and their families tor-
 tured to death to intimidate the villages.
 They share the fate of civilians in Saigon
 who  have  been  callously  bombed  into
 oblivion by the Viet Gong who-we are told
 in some quarters-simply are seeking their
 rights.
 Regardless   of  who  is  spared  from a
 trumped-up "war crimes" trial in the prison
 camps of North Viet Nam, these men were
 given not even the benefit of mock trials.
 They were simply slaughtered by Commu-
 nists acting like Communists.
 Such incidents mark the character of the
 forces under Ho who will be enabled to perpe-
 trate more of the same kind of atrocities if
 we can just be persuaded to cease oil depot
 bombing, and let more of the killers move
 south.  They mark the foreseeable action of
 future waves of invaders if we will just "de-
 escala?te," or withdraw our forces and let
 Ho's horror sweep over the South Vietnamese
 countryside.
 Such incidents place the mark of the beast
 also on the Soviet Union, which is supposedly
 a peace-loving member of the United Na-
 tions, and on Red China, for which many
 persons in a soft-on-communism bloc are
 trying to  win  UN  membership.   Russia's
 active participation' in aggresion by sending
 weapons and munitions to Hanoi, and Pe-
 king's vociferous moral support and threats
 of intervention brand them as being un-
 worthy of associating in the society of civil-
 ized nations.
 A group of American fliers captured by the
 North Vietnamese after being shot down will
 not be tried as "war criminals"-yet, at least.
 That's the word relayed to our government
 through diplomatic channels.
