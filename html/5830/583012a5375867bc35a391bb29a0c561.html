 DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE

 Questions and Answers
 to Chief, Domestic Policy Branch, OEA,
 Central Intelligence Agency
 Summary
 China's ambitious economic reform program, which
 was formally endorsed at October's party plenum, has
 generated a wide range of questions about its nature.
 This typescript addresses some of the most frequently
 asked questions, including:  how the Chinese program
 compares to Hungary's economic reforms and Lenin's New
 Economic Policy (NEP); whether China is approaching
 capitalism; and whether the reforms can be reversed.
 technology and easier access to US markets.
 It is our ,judgment that although China's economic
 reforms are similar to Hungary's and the NEP, they
 differ significantly in the first instance in their
 implementation--because of the vast differences in the
 two economies--and in the second, in their intended
 permanence.  The reforms will allow market forces a
 greater role in allocating resources, but China's
 economy ,will remain essentially socialist.  We believe
 it will be difficult to undo.the reforms once
 established, but we expect Beijing to tighten and
 loosen guidelines to meet the inevitable dislocations.
 We do not rule out the possibility that, under certain
 circumstances, China might retreat to tighter central
 control as it did in 1981.  It is very unlikely,
 however, that future leaders would return to the
 demonstrably bankrupt economic policies of Mao.  As the
 reforms are phased in, we believe the opportunities for
 Western businesses, including US firms, will increase.
 We also expect increased Chinese demand for advanced

 What Are The ~teforms?
 Experiments with individual urban reforms have been under way since
 1979, but October's Third Plenum of the 12th Party Congress was an
 important benchmark in Beijing's campaign to alter fundamentally the way
 the regime makes economic decisions.  The plenum's key document, "Decision
 on Reform of the Economic Structure," officially placed the party's stamp
 of approval on specific policies, provided. essential Marxist justification,
 and placed the urban reforms in the broader context of the pa~c
 rectification effort and the successful agricultural reforms.
 The policies themselves seek to change the structure, method, and
 incentives of industrial management in order to improve efficiency and thus
 industrial performance.  The urban reforms are more complicated than the
 agricultural ones and~as such are more dependent for their success on all
 aspects working together.  The most important are:
 --Reform of the Planning System.  China is gradually moving away from
 the rigid central planning system that it modeled on the Soviet Union.
 Under the reforms, production of certain items of national
 importance--such as steel, petroleum products, chemicals and
 foodgrains--remain. under mandatory state quotas.  Most products,
 however, are to be produced under "guidance plans" that are set by the
 state but that the enterprises can adjust to meet changing markets.
 Consumer items and over-quota"production of most goods are to be
 regulated by China's equivalent of an open market.
 --Enterprise Autonomy.  A major goal of the reforms is to increase the
 authority of enterprise managers and reduce the power of party and
 government officials in economic d~acisionmaking.  Managers already
 have more power to develop production and marketing strategies, hire
 and fire workers, and set prices and wages; the power of central
 ministries and provincial governments is reduced correspondingly.
 Competition between enterprises is~encouraged.
 --Price Reform.  In perhaps the most important reform, Beijing has
 begun to adjust domestic prices.  Prices of key products--such as coal
 and oil--will still be set by the state but at levels that better
 reflect relative scarcities in the economy.  The prices of many other
 products--including most manufactures--are allowed to fluctuate within
 bounds set by the state in response to market conditions.  Supply and
 demand alone determines the prices of minor consumer goods such as
 certain clothing products, cosmetics, and even minor foodstuffs.
 --Wage Reform.  Wages, once guaranteed regardless of output or
 qualifications, will now reflect job performance.  Workers with
 greater productivity will receive higher wages.  Wages will reflect
 seniority, the cost of living, and skills in great demand.

 cuNriutNiiH~
 --Tax System.  Instead of turning all profits over to the government,
 enterprises pay taxes and retain the remaining profits.  Enterprise
 managers can use after-tax profits for worker bonuses, investment, and
 so forth..
 --Bank Reform.  The banking system is being reorganized.  Bank loans
 are increasingly ,replacing government grants as the source of capital
 for enterprises.
 --International Trade.  International trade and foreign investment in
 China is being further encouraged.  City and provincial governments
 have expanded authority to deal with foreign firms.  Foreign trade
 enterprises, which will be allowed greater leeway in doing business,
 can now operate as commissioned agents for manufacturers and importers
 of most products.  Foreign firms engaged in joint venture production
 can sell their output domestically as long as the venture's foreign
 exchange expenditures and receipts are balanced.
 When The Reforms Are Fully Implemented Will China Have A Capitalist
 Economy?
 Although a distinct departure from orthodox central planning, these
 reforms will not transform China into a capitalist economy.  The state will
 continue to own the means of production, and will still have direct control
 over output, pricing, and distribution of key products.  Output of other
 products will continue to be regulated according to guidelines established
 by the state.  The state will also retain the right to appoint or remove
 enterprise managers and shut down-inefficient enterprises.
 Entrepreneurs have been allowed to establish small privately-run
 enterprises such as repairshops, restaurants, and tailor shops, but these
 activities now involve only 1 to 2 percent of the nonagricultural labor
 force. ~In the countryside, farmers-lease land from the state. and contract
 with the government to produce a given quantity of output.
 China's leaders are committed to retaining the essential socialist
 nature of their economy, and are very sensitive to charges that they are
 introducing capitalist reforms.  Western press depiction of the reforms as
 "capitalist" provides ammunition to the opponents of reform.
 How Do The Chinese Reforms Compare With Hungarian Economic Reforms?
 The Chinese reforms are similar to those in Hungary, but the
 dissimilarities between the  two economies suggest to us that they will
 follow different courses.  Granting enterprise managers more autonomy,
 decentralizing banking, enhancing work incentives, and basing prices on
 market conditions, are important components of reform in both countries.
 The similarity of reform initiatives is due, in part, to the frequent
 consultations between Chinese and Hungarian economists over the past few

 How the reforms actually unfold will be strongly influenced by the
 special characteristics of each country.
 --China has a continental economy and is largely self-sufficient,
 while the Hungarian economy is far smaller and heavily dependent on
 foreign trade.  Hungary's reliance on trade has enabled it to use
 world prices as a reference for setting domestic prices.  China will
 be more likely to adjust prices to domestic market conditions.
 --Compared with Hungary, China's vast market, abundance of labor,
 and rich resources make it more attractive to foreign investors.
 --China lacks the well-educated managers and technocrats that are
 needed to run autonomous enterprises.  Hungary has more experience
 with economic reform, and has better educated managers available,
 including sophisticated bankers.
 Political differences are also significant.  Deng Xiaoping fully
 supports the reforms, and has the political clout to coopt or override any
 opposition that may arise.  Janos Kadar not only must satisfy reform
 opponents in his party. but must also consider the Soviet reaction to
 Hungarian reforms.
 How Do The Reforms Compare With Lenin's New Economic Policy?
 There are pronounced similarities between China's recent economic
 reforms and elements of Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP), which was
 launched in March 1921.  As with the Chinese reforms, Lenin's program was
 designed to establish incentives for increases in labor productivity and
 efficient management of enterprises
 In the Soviet countryside, an in-kind tax on agricultural production...
 replaced the onerous policy of forced requisitions of output.  Farmers were
 allowed to keep production in excess of the tax and were permitted to hire
 laborers to help with farm operations, measures'~similar to those introduced
 in China.
 Small enterprises were leased to private managers, or in some cases,
 returned to their original owners.  Managers of state enterprises were
 given enhanced decisionmaking authority to dismiss incompetent and reward
 productive workers.  Enterprises could use a  ortion of their profits to
 pay bonuses to workers and managers
 Foreign investment in Russia was encouraged.  Large enterprises not
 operated by the state could be leased to foreigners.
 Unlike the Chinese program, the NEP was launched in the midst of
 economic stagnation and peasant revolt brought on by abrupt nationalization
 of industry and agriculture.  China's rural population has been relatively
 passive for more than 30 years following Beijing's introduction of strict
 state control.  Lenin rationalized the NEP as a necessary transitional

 phase in the march to communism.  China's leaders today emphasize that
 reforms must occur because               a "commodity economy stage"--a
 precursor of true socialism.
 Four years after the death of Lenin, the experiment with economic
 liberalization ended.  Although the reforms had restored industrial and
 agricultural production to their pre-war levels, Stalin decided to pursue a
 different policy.  The approval of the first Five Year Plan brought with it
 collectivization~of Russian agriculture and an emphasis on rapid
 development of heavy industry under state guidance.  The  hin  a intend
 their reforms to last well into the next century
 The risks to the reform program are two-fold:  short-run economic and
 social disruptions that may occur as the reforms are introduced; and
 political opposition within the party itself.
 Two potential economic problems of special concern are inflation and
 unemployment.  As central control over prices is relaxed, we expect the
 combination of shortages of consumer goods, pent-up demand, and large
 savings accounts to cause a sharp rise in prices.  To preserve the real
 income of urban workers, and to forestall widespread dissatisfaction, the
 state may have to increase wage subsidies, thereby worsening budget
 .deficits.  We do not believe, however, that any long-term price spiral will
 ensue because the fiscally conservative government is unlikely to resort to
 use of the printing press to finance consumer spending.
 If the state ends subsidies to losing enterprises, inefficient
 factories may be forced to close.  Since labor mobility is low in China,
 pockets of relatively high unemployment could result that will be difficult
 to relieve.
 In the .political arena, we believe there is opposition to the reforms
 from party bureaucrats who lose power as decisionmaking is decentralized,
 and from ideologues who are disturbed by the departure from the
 egalitarianism of the Maoist era.  Although clearly on the defensive, we
 believe opponents of reform will seize any, short-term problems to argue for
 On the other hand,?a successful reform program could conceivably lead
 to demands for further economic decentralization and consequently
 controversy in the party--possibly even in the reform wing.  Although not
 inevitable, popular pressure for additional reform may eventually be
 accompanied by demands for political liberalization
 We_believe that China's leaders are well aware of the risks inherent in
 the reform program, and are therefore proceeding cautiously in implementing

 Are The Reforms Reversible?
 The urban economic reforms are controversial, and until
 firmly established and proven successful, they could be reversed.  We
 believe, however, that any leadership would see compelling reasons to
 continue the reform program.*  The party has invested considerable
 prestige in the economic reforms, which are being touted as evidence of the
 party's legitimacy and vitality.  A wholesale retreat from the reform
 program would seriously damage the party's prestige domestically.
 Scrapping reforms would also harm China's growing--and
 profitable--relations with the West and Japan.  A reversal of China's "open
 door" policy would seriously jeopardize China's ability to acquire advanced
 technology, and international relations could suffer?if foreign investors
 were treated poorly.
 Because the agricultural reforms are better established--and
 successful--future Chinese leaders probably would find them particularly
 difficult to reverse.  We believe that "re-collectivization" would anger
 China's most productive farmers--primary beneficiaries of reform--and would
 cause a large decrease in agricultural output, widespread rural
 dissatisfaction, and possibly instances of violence.
 -''As urban economic reforms are implemented, we expect interest groups
 will develop to support them.  Productive workers and efficient managers
 will benefit from a policy that allows wages to reflect effort.
 Technocrats will receive higher income and greater social status.  As the
 bureaucratic structures ,to implement reforms are put in place, it will
 become more difficult fbr a future government to dismantle them.
 Nonetheless, the party's first priority is to maintain social control
 and its own dominant position.  If urban reforms produce serious economic
 disruptions or civil strife, the party will be compelled to modify them and
 will accept the costs of doing so.  We believe a reemphasis of central
 planning will be more probable under those circumstances than a return to
 the Maoist egalitarianism of the Cultural. Revolution.  For instance,
 enterprise managers might be allowed to maintain limited decisionmaking
 authority, but the state would probably prohibit managers from firing
 workers if unemployment problems became acute.  Inflationary pressures
 could lead Beijing to set narrower bands within which prices are allowed to
 fluctuate; free smarket operations might also be restricted.  If budgetary
 problems become severe, Beijing would probably raise tax rates rather than
 reintroduce the profit remittance system that it abandoned under reform.
 Deng Xiaoping is credited with being the driving force behind the reform
 effort and his death is most often cited as the most likely cause for
 retreat.  We believe his- chosen successors, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, are
 fully committed to economic reform, but they lack Deng's political clout
 and connections.  We believe they would work hard to maintain the reforms,
 but new initiatives may be much less likely.

 Firms might be discouraged from competing with each other if major
 shortages of raw materials developed, or if prices of export products began
 falling sharply or import prices rising rapidly.
 What Are The Implications For The United States?
 We believe that Chinese economic reforms will lead to expanded trade
 and investment opportunities for US businesses.  Increases in real per
 capita income may even lead to greater. demand for foreign products.  In any
 case, Beijing is seeking additional foreign investment and is attempting to
 The reforms are also likely to aggravate some current problems:
 --Increases in Chinese industrial output will probably lead to greater
 demands by China for an easing of restrictions on sales of Chinese
 textiles and light industrial products in the United States.  There '
 may also be more frequent complaints from US companies about Chinese
 "dumping" in the United States.
 --Continued success of agricultural reforms in China may cause
 decreases in sales to China of grain, cotton, and synthetic fiber.
 Eventually, China may compete with the United States for international
 sales of some agricultural products, particularly cotton.
 --Eventually, US allies may face stiff competition from Chinese
 exports of light industrial products.                          '
