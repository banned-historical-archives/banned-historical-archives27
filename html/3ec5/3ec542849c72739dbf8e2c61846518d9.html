2 Sep,-Oct. 1971 I BNDD Bulletin 
Diirector's 
PurJe-,',01e 
It has become increasingly clear that BNDD's role 
on foreign soil has changed considerably during the past 
two years. 
Experts both within BNDD and other agencies agree! 
that the most effective way to diminish or stop the supply 
.of illicit drugs into this country is to work as closely as 
possible at the source of the drugs. 
It is easier, for example, to identify and destroy an 
Illegal opium poppy field than it is to stop a caravan of 
several hundred horses and men. Or, it would be more 
effective to immobilize a clandestine heroin processing, 
laboratory than it would be to try to detect concealed; 
heroin being smuggled' into the United States. 
Striking at the heart of the traffic, namely the 
source countries, poses many new challenges to BNDD 
and dictates that we develop?and implement imaginative 
and effective programs and participate as integral members 
of numerous American foreign missions. This is what we 
are doing. 
During the past few weeks, I have set in motion the 
mechanics of a major reorganization of BNDD's overseas 
operation to meet new challenges and take advantage of 
new opportunities that we never had before. My first step, 
was to appoint George M. Belk, a veteran BNDD executive,! 
to a new position. on my staff. Mr. Belk, reporting directly! 
to. me, has sole planning and operational control over, 
BNDD's overseas program. 
Within the coming weeks, BNDD's overseas Special 
iSep.-Oct. 1971 1 BNDD Bulletini 
? 
Agent staff?in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, 
and the Far East?will be increased to 123, or more than 
double its present strength. We are also increasing the ' 
number of our offices in these four areas of the world 
from 25 to 46. ? 
At the heart of our reorganized overseas operation, 
however, is how we carry .out our job. It is obvious that 
our activity will vary, ji not from one country to another, 
certainly among definOle geographical regions. With this 
in mini, we will develop 'a specifidally designed program 
and a manager to carry?it,out in each country or area. In 
one country, it may mdan working for the elimination of 
raw materials, in another, it may mean apprehension of 
, processors Jrid distributors; and in other countries, dif-
ferent !programs. 
To. carry out this wide variety of activities, we are 
selecting management and Special Agent personnel for 
these positions who are considered exceptionally com-
petent and versatile. They will be able to recognize when 
and where training is needed, where foreign assistance 
might be best tendered, the value of intelligence, the 
necessity for and i processes of case-making or, when not 
to resort to traditional enforcement measures. 
I! think' this new initiative by BNDD will have 'a' 
dramatitic impact at the most vulnerable part of the illicit 
drug raffic?the source.

George M. Belk 
To Head 
On August 14, BNDD Director John 
E. Ingersoll announced the formation 
of a new Office for International Af-
fairs. Appointed to head the Office, 
as Program Manager, was George M. 
Belk. The following story by Ron E. 
Moxness, staff writer for the Interna-
tional Press Service, is based on an 
interview with Mr. Belk subsequent to 
the announcement. The story, which 
was released through the United States 
Informalion Agency, is an accurate re-
port on this important facet of BNDD's 
total mission. 
? (Wathington, Sep. 2) Last June 17 
President Nixon announced an increase 
in U.S. efforts to prevent illicit narco-
tics from reaching the United States

In an interview this week, a U.S. 
? official outlined steps being taken to 
, strengthen the investigative capacities 
1 of the .S. Bureau of Narcotics and 
Dangerq s Drugs abroad. These will 
include' he Bureau's ability "to assist 
host goi,ernments in the hiring, train-
ing and deployment of petsonnel and 
the prq urcment of necessary equip-
ment fo drug abuse cortkol."

tive capacities" of the Bureau has in-

The new office is headed by George 
M. Belk, a veteran of the U.S. war 
against I the narcotics trafficker. He 
served as Chief of the Criminal Investi-
gation Division of the Bureau before 
his current assignment. 
Mr. Belk participated in a meeting 
of the International Criminal Police 
Organization (Interpol) at Ottawa,Sep-
tember 7-13. At that meeting, as In 
others -with his foreign counterparts, 
Mr. Belk summed up, through a Bur-
eau memorandum, the U.S. official 
view of drug abuse: 
"The mood of the American people, 
the Congress, the administration, and 
the President is that the United States 
. should and will take whatever actions 
are necessary, both domestically and 
internationally, to remove this blight 
from our I society. Internationally 
, these actions will include, if necessary, 
a reassessment of our foreign policy

Mr. Belk does not view language 
such as this as blunt because, as he 
noted in the interview, "The people 
we are working with are just as dedi-
cated, just as determined as we are to 
put a halt to a traffic which, in the 
United States alone, has produced 
more than 300,000 heroin addicts and 
In New York alone causes the deaths,1 
annually, of more than 1,000 per-
sons?many of them teenagers." 
At the outset, U.S. Special Agents 
overseas worked from their own head- , 
quarters, often separated from the ' 
broad streams of diplomacy. Now, Mr. 
Belk said, "This office will be respon-
sible for the coordination of the vari-
ous facets of our activities relating to 
the foreign scene. It will also work 
closely with the other major U.S. 
agencies in foreign areas. Mr. Ingersoll 
has now directed that Ave become a 
part of the U.S. country teams to fight 
the illicit traffic in narcotics?particu-
larly those destined for the United 
States." 
This job, Mr. Belk noted, is the 
Bureau's primary missicli7to interdict 
the flow of drugs illegally destined for 
the United States and to reduce drasti-
cally the availability of narcotics in 
the nation. 
To accomplish this mission, the 
number of Special U. S. Narcotics 
Agents working overseas will be doub-
led during the fiscal year ending next 
June 30, to a total of 123 men. They 
will be posted in Europe, the Middle 
East, Latin America and Asia. 
The borders of what the Bureau 
calls "control areas," have been shifted. 
The present Paris Headquarters was 
originally designed for a region made 
up of Europe, the Middle East, South 
Asia and North Africa. Because the 
number of regional headquarters is 
being increased, Paris now will have 
under its jurisdiction Europe and North-
west Africa. 
Ankara, Turkey will be the regional 
headquarters for the Middle East and 
Northeast Africa and South Asia. 
Bangkok, Thailand will be head-
quarters for Southeast Asia. Tokyo 
will be headquarters for operations in 
Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, 
the 'Philippines and points north of 
Okinawa. Saigon, because of its em-
phasis on military channels, will con-
tinue to be an independent operation 
reporting directly to Washington. 
Mr. Belk said negotiations are under 
way through the State Department to 
broaden the number of Bureau posts 
in Latin America, The Bureau has 
offices in Mexico City and Guada-
lajara. New offices have been opened 
at Hermosillo and Monterrey. An 
office In Panama is responsible for 
part of the northern and western 
I coast regions of Latin America and 
an office in Buenos Aires covers the 
Eastern portions of the hemisphere. 
The Bureau hopes to open new 
offices in Caracas, Quito, Ascension, 
Lima and Rio de Janeiro. 
Mr. Belk pointed out that the new 
offices "will greatly increase ?tic abil-
ity to work with the Latin American 
countries on mutual problems." 
South America is one of the world's 
largest cultivators of the coca leaf, 
from which cocaine is made. Peru 
grows the coca leaf legally for the 
production of medicinal cocaine but 
It is not legal in other countries. 
Mr. Belk explained Oat heroin 
from Europe enters the United States 
by various routes. Some of it is 
shipped to smugglers along the East 
Coast of South I America and moves 
by various routes via Panama and Mex-
ico to the United States. It also moves 
from illicit laboratories in France to 
Canada, and thence to the United 
States. And, of course, some is smug-
gled directly through U.S. ports from 
Europe. 
The Bureau has, had Special Agents, 
in Montreal for a number of years. 
Mr. Belk said the Bureau hopes to have, 
more agents stationed in Toronto and' 
in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
He said the Bureau has a close and 
harmonious working relationship with 
the Royal Cardian Mounted Police, 
a relationship which became official-
ly closer when Canada joined a Franco- I 
American Joint Working Group in 
November, 1970. The last meeting of 
the working group was in Ottawa and 
the next one is scheduled for 'Wash-
ington. 
Concentration is on technical prob-
lems involved in the legalities and 
machinery of narcotics operations. Mr. 
Belk said cooperation is equally close 
with the French Central National 
Bureau, an arm of the Surete. 
Similar close working relationships 
exist between the United States and 
Mexico, with the Attorney Generals 
of both countries credited with crea-
tion of the Mexican-American work-
ing group. Meetings are alternately 
held in Mexico City and Washington, 
with the next meeting in Washington 
in Octoirr. 
Mr. Belk said that, while few prob-
lemstexist in Africa of direct relation 
to the United States, the Bureau is 
plahning to open an office in Rabat 
because of the flow of hashish, the 
strongest form of marihuana, from 
Morocco to the United States. 
A long-term need, in Mr. Belk's 
view, is treaties with foreign nations 
to ease extradition for prosecution 
of third country nationals caught in 
illegal narcotics activity. 
This step, together with others ex-
pected to irri:n Narcotics, will help the United Nations 
Commission  
bring into being the framework of 
I international controls sought by Pre-
sident Nixonra framework the Presi-
dent believes Will help all nations

What Other Countries Do

: known in other parts of the world, where traffickers are 
occasionally shot. 
? Since 1969, Iran, which has an estimated total of 
'400,000 opium and heroin addicts, has been executing smug-
glers, who usually slip over the porous border with Afghan-' 
.istan. About 150 smugglers, many of them simple Afghan. 
'tribesmen, have been executed in Iran. 
Thailand, which has a long history of official involved 
ment in the opium business, has on occasion executed trait- . 
? tickers. China has provisions for three-year to life sentences' 
for drug dealers. Taiwan has a death penalty for trafficking, 
..,even in marijuana.

on a drug epidemic was the Japanese response to the wide-. 
spread abuse of amphetamine and methamphetamine after. 
World War II. 
By 1954, when the use peaked, two million Japanese 
were estimated to be injecting amphetamines. 
Under the Awakening Drug Control' Law in Japan, 
mandatory prison sentences were meted out. Possession Of, 
the drugs drew an automatic three-month sentence; traf-. 
,fickers and underground manufacturers went to jail for, 
as long as 10 years. 
, In 1954, 55,664 persons were arrested. In following 
? years, the arrests declined, down to a low of 271 in 1958. 
The tough enforcement approach was universally cred-
ited with breaking the back of the use of the drugs, although

plined nature of Japanese society, which generally supported 
the Government's efforts.

PRESS INSTITUTE

It Charges Courts Are Used 
to Chip Away at Freedom 
, Special to the Plew York nines 
GENEVA, Dec. 31?The in. 
temational Press Institute as. 
serted today that the Nixon Ad. 
Ministration was "attempting td 
chip away at press freedom 
through the courts and by the 
threats of court action." 
? In its annual world review of 
'press freedom, the institute said 
I that the Nixon Administration 
apparently intended to make 
, the "journalist timid In re-
search for the facts and the 
public nervous when confront-
ed by a reporter asking for 
them. 
Nevertheless, the study by the 
institute's French director, Er-
nest Meyer, found that in the 
United States the "foundation 
stone of freedom of speech and 
the press edifice that has been 
built on. it remains almost tin. 
scathed." ? ? . ? :

Ments over the last year, the 
Institute said that the trend to 
restrict press freedoni. was 
stronger than In 1971. Barely 
one-fifth of the 132 Members of 
the United Nations "enjoy what 
can genuinely be called free-
dom of information," it re-. 
ported. 
The survey also cited what it 
termed the "continuing efforts 
of governments to erode free-
dom of expression through in. 
timidation of journalists and 
manipulation of mass media.", 
The aim, it said, is to "give 
the impression that the inter-
ests of the country are neces., 
sarily Identical with those of 
.the government in power." 
, But the "true danger," thd 
review continued, "lies in the, 
fact that a ,growing number, 
of governments,' parliamentary 
,representatives, citizens and 
even some members of the 
press begin to accept that at-
tacks on freedom of expression 
are legitimate and justifiable.". 
Marcos Assailed 
The most serious attack od 
this freedom in the last year, 
.according to the institute, was 
the "silencing of the most cow-

Asia, that of the Philippines."

Foreign Relations' Secrets: 
Less Reyealing Than Enriching 
PROBABLY the loudest complainers 
, about executive branch secrecy, pArtic-
li ularly in the area of foreign affairs, 
w are members of the Senate who serve 
on the Foreign Relations Committee. , 
/ Yet none have guarded 'mere sedu-
lously its own private documents than 
those same committee members. Now, 
at long last, a change is under way and 
consequently a bouquet is appropriate, 
?? small one at least. 
/ Some years back Chairman Ful-
bright, himself a one pres-
ident, began what he calls educational 
hearings by his committee which were 
largely the product of his frustration 
*, over executive branch policy on China 
;t And Indochina. Many figures .of history 
' past testified at these hearings and 
t While much of what they said was use-
ful historically much of it was more 
useful politically as a prod to the 
r President of the day. 
Fulbright and his committee, how-
1, ever, never opened their own files to 
the public though they were dipped 
, into from time to time for useful clues 
(- for the hearings. Now, however, for the 
first time the committee is printing for 
public distribution some of its own 
' closed-door hearings of years past. The 
f first ones off the press cover the Tru-
man Doctrine and the Greek-Turkish 
aid program of 1947. There are no star-
tling revelations but the words then of 
Dean Acheson, James Forrestal, Rob- , 
ert Patterson, Vice Adm. Forrest Sher-
man and others and those of such sen-
ators as Arthur Vandenberg and Tom 
Connally will enrich the history of 
that crucial time. 
THE BIGGEST skeptic on the com-
mittee about such publication has been 
--the Senate's senior senator, George Al-
ken of Vermont who came to the Sen. 
ate in 1941 but who did not become a 
committee member until 1954. He fi-
nally agreed to publication provided 
any living senator or ex-senator gave , 
his approval. In the instant case that 
meant only former Sen. Henry Cabot 
Lodge Jr. State Department clearance, 
as well, was required. 
It is Fulbright's hope to continue the 
r publication of such hitherto secret tes-
timony. But the committee lacks the 
1. funds to do the job adequately:\ for ex-
- I 
ample, to publish testimony from ear-
lier years. If Aiken will permit it, pub-
lication of testimony from later years 
,will gradually occur. Hopefully, the 
full Senate will give the committee' 
some more money to keep this highly 
useful venture alive and to expedite it. 
It was, of course, the row over Publi-
cation of the Pentagon Papers, and the . 
attendant argument about over-classifi-
cation of executive branch documents, 
that has sparked this Senate move. 
The same row also has helped speed, 
at least a bit, publication of the State, 
Department's historical series of docu-
ments. 
THE STATE SERIES began back in 
1861 and, unbeReVable as it now seems, 
the documents during the rest of the 
19th century were published no later 
than two years 'after they were writ-
ten, including a great many sensitive 
papers. The first World War slowed 
the process so that between the wars' 
publication was about 15 years from 
current. After World War II docu-
ments fell 20 and then 25 years behind. 
Currently State is about to issue the 
last of eight volumes covering the year 
1947. 
After the Pentagon Papers row Pres-
ident Nixon asked for and got more 
money to speed declassification and 
publication of State's series. William 
Franklin, State's chief historian, says 
that "we're desperately trying to gain 
on chronology" and he hopes by 1976 
to be exactly 20 years behind, a five 
year 'gain. 
Of course, State doesn't publish ev-
erything even from a quarter century 
ago. Some documents are omitted be-
cause they deal with persons still in 
power: the Shah of Iran, Chiang Kai-
shek, Franco, Mao and Chou En-lai and 
some Latin leaders such as the SOMOZA 
family. But the bulk of the material 
does get published to the benefit of 
history. Since 1861 some 200 volumes 
have been printed. 
FULBRIGHT'S COMMITTEE has 
published several studies on Indochina 
extracted chiefly from the Pentagon 
Papers. These well annotated staff 
Studies relate the raw evidence of the 
Pentagon Papers to various memoirs

staffer, Robert M. Blum, has even sue-7:,' 
cecded in dredging up some interest-
ing old OSS documents of 1945-46 
which are being published for the first 
,time. 
Whether the committee will have 
the courage to permit publication of., 
Its own secret hearings dealing with 
'Indochina in the Eisenhower-Kennedy-
Johnson years is an open question, 
What seems to worry the reluctant 
senators is not wifether, publication' 
would embarrass the various executive 
branch witnesses; who presumably. 
were speaking with more candor in a 
closed rather than.. an open session.'' 
The worry Is ,over how senators would 
look today in the light of current views 
and knowledge of the long American 
inyolvement. Whether, in short, some 
of them would look foolish. 
' From the public record His obvious 
that some senators, both the departed 
and some still serving; indeed would 
not look very good. Fulbright has 
publicly recanted his earlier views and 
Sen. Mansfield has come close to doing 
so. But a claim of consistency is the 
more usual senatorial posture. 
IT IS OBVIOUS to arty student of 
history, whether he is dealing with 
In-
,dochlna or Europe or almost' any 
other problem area, that the legisla-, 
tive-executive relationship, plays an Im-
portant role, sometimes a key role. 
The executive often bases its plans on 
what it thinks will be the nature of the 
congressional reception, 'first of all 
that by the Foreign Relations Commit-
tee. And of course party political con-
siderations seldom are absent though 
equally seldom conceded to be present. 
In short the historical record is not 
complete unless this interplay is also 
made public, as far as it ever was put , 
down by a committee stenographer. 
Committee hearings often are con-
fusing, usually disjointed, frequently 
repetitive and frustratingly incomplete 
? because the wrong questions were , 
asked or even when they were they, 
Were not followed by further ques-
tions. Still, they are a very important 
part of history. So we award that small 
bouquet to Foreign Relations in hopes 
? of awarding a big one biter on.

Chinese rug5 u.gglers, 
Tired to 'Dutch .C.Onnectioh` 
FRANKFUR'I\, Germany 
(AP) ? Two U.S. congress-
men said yesterday that 
Chinese sailors have estab-
lished a "Dutch connection" at 
the ports of Amsterdam and 
Rotterdam for smuggling most 
of the heroin peddled to U.S. 
'servicemen stationed in West 
Germany. 
Reps. Morgan Murphy, 
and Robert H. Steele,

government for laxity in nar-

a "distinct Increase in heroin

Steele and Murphy said drug 
use among U.S. soldiers in 
West Germany increased from 
about 1.3 percent of those test-
ed in December 1971 to be-
.tween 4.2 and 6.3 percent in 
October 1972.

Response on Russia's Space technology. 
In a report from Moscow (Dec. 13) 
":Robert G. Kaiser writes that "despite 
all its scientific achievements, the So-
viet Union is a second or even a third-
1 rate technological power." As proof, he 
t. gives examples from cosmonautics, avi-
ation, automobile industry, computing 
i'l techniques and even silrgery. Not be-
!.? ing so erudite and being a specialist 
ionly in one of the listed fields, namely 
? 
t", In cosmonautics, I will take the liberty 
c'. ? of dwelling on Mr. Kaiser's assertions 
i concerned with this area. 
The U.S. planned its first soft land- ' 
1. ling on Mars in 1976, that is, five years, 
r later than the U.S.S.R., and its first 
soft landing on Venus in 1977-or seven 
.'s years after the U.S.S.R. What is more, , 
, 
I; ,an authoritative report of several re- ' 
f, search divisions of the U.S. Library of 
Congress (1971) says: "While American ; 
! 
space efforts continue winding down ... 
, . the overall Soviet space program re- , 
t mains a strong and growing enter-
it: prise." For Mr. Kaiser, this document 
f.. Is evidently not very authoritative. n 
(As for manned flights which are in 
the main considered by Mr. Kaiser; 
1971 saw the creation of the world's,. 
first manned orbital station Salyut 
i that opened up a qualitatively new, 
stage in cosmonautics. Does Mr. Kaiser 
really believe that the death of the cos-
monauts upon their return in any way 
belittles its importance? After all, the 
death of American astronauts in 1967 
did not call in question the Apollo pro-
gram that is a generally recognized 
. . 
achievement of the U.S.A. The 
U.S.S.R.'s abandonment of manned 
flights to the Moon cannot be consid: 
ered, as Mr. Kaiser does, at evidence 
of its lagging behind. Soviet specialists 
Think it more expedient to explore the 
moon by automatic devices, with the 
present level of world technology. Be-. 
_ 
sides, manned flights to the moon In..voive tremendobs? expenses. That Was ., 
precisely the reason why the Apollo 
'program had to be stopped at the 
"most interesting place" when it began 
acquiring not only Prestige and techni-
cal importanCei- but also great scien-
tific value. As fot the Soviet automatic 
devices, they will be steadily improved 
.as they continue their planned studies 
of the moon, "as is evidenced from the 
' recent launching of a craft towards the 
moon last Monday.

that they now have a'Chance to share ,

tor, has a different view. He thinks 
that the experiment is important for .1 
both countries. It will perMit the A 
. U.S.A., among other things, to fill the A 
gap in manned flights between 1973 1

cilities. James Fletcher also believes 
Is possible to use a Soviet orbital sta-
tion and is in principle for a joint 
tian expedition. (His interview with .1 
,UPI, Nov. 26, 1972.) 
Thus, contrary to Mr. Kaiser, the 
NASA head considers it Worthwhile:, 
for the U.S.A. to cooperate on an equal '..

' since President Eisenhower appointed 
Harold Stassen to the post of Special 
Assistant to the President for Disarma-

i job was institutionalized with congrets. 
sional creation, at President Kennedy's 
,,.request, of the Arms Control-and Die-
armament Agency. William C. Foster 
became head .of ACDA and the chief* 
negotiator, as well, on arms .control 
measures. In 1969 President Nixon 
chose Gerard C. Smith to head ACDA, 
t and later to be the chief negotiator for 
(.; the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks 
(SALT). Now, as the second Nbton 
term begins, Smith has departed by his 
own choice and the President has tap-

Smith's successor to head ACDA,a

were effective, or ineffective, to t.iut 
degree that they could establish an,inr 
dependent input from an office or ,an 
agency that was beholden neither ,to 
the diplomatic views of State, the mill-
tary views of Defense, or the viewsrqf 
the White House staff. 
It is for such reasons as these that 
the appointment of Alex Johnson 'hes 
? done more than raise eyebrows among 
those in and out of government, Who 
concern themselves with arms control, 
above all with the SALT II negotia-
tions which resume in Geneva for a 
second session on Feb. 27. Johnson is 
widely vie.wed as a temporary appoipp 
ment. He suffered a heart attack It 
while back and his doctors have 
warned him against excessive work. 
For that reason, it appears, he turned 
down a Nixon offer to succeed Ambas-
sador Bunker in Saigon. The top cit-

He has had only minimal acquaintance 
with the complex arms control Issues.', ' 
THE ISSUES at SALT -11 are going 
to be very tough to resolve. Henry KIS-

House is uncertain. By all 8?. 
counts, then, the U.S. Is in a holding 
pattern on arms control and thik 
likely to last for some time. President 
Nixon's separation of the two posts' Of 
ACDA head and top negotiator adds 
an additional uncertainty. 
It was widely believed when SAL'

cow for speedy new agreements.' The 
interim pact on offensive weapon* 
runs for five years and most people 
felt that not until about the fourth

Our Energy Needs: What Can Be Done? 
News releases from the Maritime 
*Administration have been empha-
sizing what has been recognized 
generally for some time: The coun-
try's "demands for petroleum and 
natural gas will progressively ex-
ceed domestic production capabili-
ties with each passing year," this 
. under present conditions. The news 
releases then point to the Mer-
'chant Marine Act of 1970 and un-
? derscore the steps which have been 
taken under it to improve and ex-
pand that section' of the U.S. flag 
fleet which transports "energy im-
ports." Reference is made to oil 
' tankers, very large crude carriers 
and ships to carry liquefied natural 
gas. (which now carries the label 
LNG). The impression is given that 
the country's maritime interests, 
backed by the federal government, 
will provide the country's share of 
the ships needed to transport oil 
and LNG from abroad. All of which 
Is reassuring but then in one news 
release this paragraph catches the 
eye: 
. "Energy imports have very great 
ramifications on the nation?in 
terms of our national security and 
the economy. There is an under-
standable concern about being 
heavily dependent upon foreign 
suppliers who could turn off the 
spigot in the event political dis-
agreements arose between 6ur two 
countries." - 
? 
6 
As immediately noted in the 
news release a presidential task ; 
force is examining all aspects or ;) 
the country's energy deficits and,: 
considering various alternates to 
alleviate shortages. 
But the problems here seerh im-
measurable. On this score a Mari-
time Administration news release 
reports that "even if substantial 
increases of domestic energy sup-
lilies are brought In over the next 
10 or 15 years their impact will be 
blunted by the fact that domestic 
consumption will have doubled 
within that same time frame." ' 
Shall wonder then that some claim 
that our only hope for a sufficient 
d 
energy supply is the run. ? ,

The, chairman, Raymond P.

Pennsylvania, made his remarks 
in response to qtiestions on 
Governor Rockefeller's proposal 
for increased narcotics penal-
ties in New York. 
"I have not seen the original

of the commission visited 36 
nations, Brazil being the last 
on the list?to study the con-

A major gap in the report 
will be first-hand information 
from the Communist countries.

other Communist country be-

says it has no drug problem,

rather than with the crime in progress.1 
So far the vast majority of hijackings

of the air pirates were not resisted,

duct to a willing foreign country or* 
'even the release of duly convicted 
compatriots. In the face of the near-
ritualistic threat to blow up the air-

;of the state in which the piracy is 
;being committed, the state and its ? 
:authorities forfeit their sovereignty, 
?that priceless possession with which 
i civilization as we know it stands and 
falls. , 
- The only, effective answer to this 
' deadly threat to human civilization' is 
to fight fire with fire: Instead of 
honoring the Sermon on the Mount the 
society 'under attack must become 
militant, and this even at the risk of 
endangering the lives of innocent by-
, Astanders or the loss of airline property,' 
(that is insured, anrkay). 
, Are we totally incapable of learning 
, from history? Once before the United , 
States had to face humiliation by Arab 
terrorists. For more than thirty years, 
from the Continental Congress to the 
aftermath of the war of 1812, the, 
"rascally potentates of the Barbary 
States?Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli? 1 
? had preyed on American merchant 
shipping in the Mediterranean with 
impunity. There was no protecting,

pay annual tribute, called "presents," 
and to ransom captured Americans.

that in reality the dilemma is cons

Neither our threat to declare war 
' nor naval demonstrations proved ef-
fective until a naval expedition under 
Commodore Decatur enforced. peace 
'without tribute or ransom. ? t 
To resist blackmail by force seems 
a tremendously hard decision for all 
Contented. However, experience shows 
Far more difficult to deal with are  
the piracies staged by the Arab terror-,1

'to the Editor:

N. Loginov 'of the Soviet Mission to 
the U.N. criticized (letter Jan. 7) your' 
editorial for omitting "for some reason ? 
or other one of the key items on the ; 
-Assembly's agenda." 
Mr. Loginov claims that this item?
:"nonuse of force in international rela-
tions and permanent prohibition of 
the use of ? nuclear ? weapons"?was, ? 
'adopted as a result of "vigorous and 
constructive discussion." This item, 
? and the two weeks of discussion in ; 
November, was, in the words of Dutch , 
Ambassador Fack, "a nonstarter." 
?? In the first four meetings (of eight), 
,only eleven states talked, and of these 
six were socialist. Whole meetings 
were canceled for lack of speakers. 4 
; When 'a revised resolution ' was 
adopted, the vote wai 73 to 4, with 
46 abstentions. This divided vote . 
? scarcely fulfills Ambassador Malik's 
I. prediction that the adoption of this 
resolution will enable the 27th session , 
to "go down in history as the Assem- ; 
-bly that liberated mankind from the 
threat of nuclear war." 
Of the five nuclear powers, only the, 
:soviet Union 'voted in favor of the 
f. resolution, with China voting against 
L"and 'France, ? the U.K., and the U.S.

There is no end to it, but nothing, 
I find, so relevant to much of what has 
happened since, than the first action 
/ saw with theFrench in the Red River, 
delta in the spring of 1952. On too 
many occasions it ,was repeated in 
South Vietnam, and every time it 
helped the Viet Cong to find recruits 
among the peasants. 
? 
, The death of General de I,attre de: 
Tassigny had brought General Ra..il; 
Salan. a veteran of too many years in ? 
Indo-China, to command the French; 
forces. His Tongking subordinate was 
General Gonzales de Linares, who had ' 
established hts field headquarters in 
the southern delta for an operation dee' 
signed to throw the Viet Minh infiltra-
tors into the sea. 
For the task de Linares had five 
mobile groups, each a baby division of 
about regimental strength, with ancil-
lary armour and artillery. The axis of 
the advance was along a road headed 
east to the coast from the town of Thai 
Binh, where battered mud-and-plaster 
houses, roughly thatched with rice 
straw, clustered around an immense, 
barn-like, Roman Catholic church. 
The artillery was sited Mthin 'a 
'stone's throw of de Linares's 'headquar-
ters, and at all hours of the night and 
,day it pumped shells into the rice-fields 
and villages ahead. The advance itself 
was painfully slow. Where the Viet 
Minh had not cut the road into sections 
non-existent in the flat rice-plains o 
the delta and the Viet Minh held the 
hills beyond. 
, The ,French crept. forward, .usirig, 
the debris of villages knocked down in 
,the advance and steel matting to makel 
a new mad alongside the old. In the 
course of one morning they demolished 
a complete village, loaded it into lorries 
and rolled everything from kitchen,

collapsed. With sub-machine-guns and 
grenades, the Viet Minh followed up. 
Next morning the red flag of the 
Viet Minh replaced the Tricolour. 
A week later another, nearer fort 
fell. This time the Viet Minh used one 
of their mountain guns. They wheeled' 
it into position in the adjoining hamlet 
mi and, over open sights and? at almost 
zero ' range, blew a hole in the fort`

its way. One by one the other forts felt

eight hundred yards to the south.

was no better, if no worse, than 
Others whose fate he had seen ,ma 
by smouldering piles of rubble.

stream, joined to the banks by two, 
'bridges heavily protected by IGOOMS 
and blocks. The rushing waters served 
as a moat. On both banks and on the 
island itself were rows of barbed wire 
festooned with tin cans to give warning 
of the intruder's approach. 'nig tower 
was vulnerable. Its bricks were not 
stout enough to withstand artillery or 
:bazooka fire. But the 'thick bunkers 
underneath were well provided with 
ammunition and food. Each dawn the 
.Tricolour waved defiantly from the 
# ?I 
,flower. Each night the Viet Minh came 
closer. They fired at any sign of move-
ment, chipping the walls of the fort 
with their bullets. The climax could 
not be long delayed.

But in March, 1952, the big French'

The French relieved the fort on, the,

." We shall pull down the tower and put, 
'more concrete, much more concrete, 
'round the sides," be told ane. "We have 
cleared the delta before, you know. 
Perhaps we shall have to do it again." 
But the delta was never cleared, and. 
' 
by October of that year French reverses 
'here and elsewhere had so changed the 
military and political situation in Indo-
China that the shadow of defeat was 
,everywhere. I cabled. The Daily 
Telegraph: "Neither the French people 
nor their Government will tolerate for 
ever such losses as are now being 
suffered in a war which holds out no 
,promise Of victory and no prospect of 
. 10 
reward." 
I had no idea that I would be writing 
very much the same lines 15 years later 
of a much greater power, the United 
States. 
At the beginning in 1946, when the 
French bombarded Haiphong and Ho 
Chi Minh took to the hills, the 
Americans were ambivalent towards, 
the war. Secretary of State George C.' 
Marshall had scant regard for what he 
regarded as France's "dangerously out-
,moded colonial concepts." At the same 
time, he was not interested in "seeing' 
colonial empire administrations repjaced 
by a philosophy and political organisa-
tion directed from and controlled by the 
Kremlin." 
I doubt that anyone born after the 
year 1940 will ever really understand the 
Indo-China War or the Vietnam War, or 
why the Americans moved in when the, 
French retired in defeat. It is not easy 
to explain in this era of disillusion and 
d?nte that the generation which 
fought and prevailed in the Second 
World War against the Nazi tyranny had 
no intention of surrendering to the 
'tyranny of the paranoid Stalin. Indeed, 
because of the rewriting of history that 
is now going on ? America, things 
have reached the ridiculous stage 
where Marshall and Truman / and 
Acheson are blamed for the Cold War. 
This is, of course, preposterous 
rubbish. No Tsarist leader could have 
been more demanding, or more imperi-
alistic, than Stalin at Yalta. He wanted 
the railways and the window to the east 
at Port Arthur and Dalny that had so 
blinded the vision of Nicholas II. He/ 
clamped down the iron curtain along 
the 38th parallel in Korea. Two years 
later a Russian sponsored conference,, 
in Calcutta decided that the indigenous 
Communist parties of South and South-
East Asia should attempt to seize power 
by armed uprisings. They tried 'in 
countries that were still' colonised and 
in those that had won their ,indepen-
dence as well. 
China was already aflame when Ho 
Chi Minh launched his campaign 
agairist the French. There were revolts 
in Burma, in India, in the Philippines, 
in Indonesia and, of course, in Malaya. 
Then came the direct challenge in 
Korea. This was the era of the Com-
munist utopia and a Communist mono-
lith seemed as attractive to the true 
believers as it was terrifying to its 
foes. Chins believed .in Stalin's Russia. 
Ho Chi Minh was allied to both. Against 
,its wishes, but to protect what it 
regarded as its vital interests, the 
'United States became involved, but not 
before it had refused Frenth requests 
for American planes and ships to 
transport troops to Indo-China. 
In the final 18 months of the Indo-
China War, however, when the need for 
Communist containment seemed more 
urgently necessary than the disband-
ment of colonial empires, the United 
States delivered two million tons of 
war material to the French at a cost 
of more than 1,000 million dollars, and 
came perilously close to intervening 
when the entrenched camp at Dien 
Bien Phu, wag seen to be on the point 
of collapse. Thereafter, its aid to 
whichever Government promised to 
hold the line in South Vietnam was in-
evitable, and, in the context of the 
times, desirable and necessary. 
? I find it difficult even with hindsight 
to decide whether the United States 
was well or ill served by President Ngo 
Dinh Diem, around whom American 
? hopes centred for nine years. In many 
ways Diem did perform miracles in the 
'Smith, but that period of quiet that 
lasted from 1954 until the end of 1959, 
avqs not just his doing, but conscious 
decision the rt of Hanoi The 
second Indo-China War when it began, 
showed only the tip of the iceberg.1, 
Unseen was the vast programme of pub- s 
teal preparation that had taken place., 
in both the Laotian and South Vietna-i 
mese countryside, the organisation of,', 
the cadre system and all the rest of the 
detailed and careful planning that Ho, 
,Chi Minh always insisted on. 
Diem was dedicated, selfless and' 
bard-working. No one, certainly not the 
Americans, understood the nature of the', 
Viet Cong political tactics better than' 
he. Yet he was so narrow, so pessi-
mistic, so deeply suspicious of men of 
goodwill that he surrounded himself 
with his abominable family, Who were 
driven on by the madness that led in 
Aueust, 1963, to the attack on the" 
Buddhist pagodas. A deep personal 
regret Of this period is that I knew long 
in advance of the detailed planning for, 
the attacks, but because of the blandi 
denials of Ngo Ilinh Nhu, Diem's bro71 
'ther, I 'could persuade no one in thet 
official American community to pay any, 
.attention. 
. Some of the things that happened int 
those days would not be credible in 
fiction. I arrived back in Saigon after 
a brief absence to find that the firstt 
.draft page of along article I had writ-
lien in the 'home of a senior Americati 
official with whom I was staying 'had 
been photocopied and found in thou-
sands in the Xa Loi pagoda, and reptc!7 
thiced in the Times of Vietnam as evi? 
dente of a foreign conspiracy, against 
.Diem. ? It had been "borrowed," we 
learned later, by my friend's servants, 
who were 'running a Buddhist printing 
press in one of his spare rooms. 
? That Vietnam was headed for, 
disaster at this time was apparent. 
Nothing could -have stopped a coup or 
a counter coup. But the American 
involvmeilt, /one would haye expected, 
would hive takCn note of What might" 
happen after Diem and brother Nhui 
.were removed from the scene. This 
omission must go down as one of thel 
Major 'blunders of the war. A was noti 
a case of the king is dead, long live thei 
king. The king was dead?and there 
was no other. 
With the whole apparatus of govern. 
ment in ruins, it was no cause for sun, 
prise that the situation fell to bits in, 
1964, or that by the beginning of 1965 
the war was all but lost. The Amen-'1 
cans either had to opt out or to opt in,i 
'They. opted in?and promptly com-I 
'mated two more major blunders. 
? 
The Kennedy confrontation 'with?1, 
Cuba had convinced many senior offie 
cials in the State Department and the; 
Pentagon that Vietnam could be 
handled to the Cuba formula, "If we, 
can show without an ounce of 'bluff that' 
Vietnam is as important to us as Cuba: 
,,and that we are prepared to risk a 
major war in its defence, then we shall, 
succeed," I was told,by U. Alexis John 
son, who had gone to Saigon with Henry, 
Cabot Lodge as deputy ambassador. 
But the trouble was that Vietna 
was not Cuba. What Washington 
would appear as a full hand prov, AO 
be a pair of twos. It was prepared to 
abandon all restraint to prevent Cuba 
from becoming a Russian missile base; 
To the end it was restrained in Viet-
nam. Cuba was vital: Vietnam was not

lerred?the tionviction that prevailed 
until the Tet offensive in 1968 that the 
(United States could shoulder aside the 
,Vietnamese and successfully take on, 
the war by itself. The idea thet it 
.might not be successful was an almost 
treasonable notion to the U.S. Army int 
'those days. 
Yet, after the sudden shock, caused' 
,by the massive American intrusion of), 
;forces, Hanoi showed remarkable con-i 
.fidence in the outcome. Pham Van, 
Dong, The North Vietnamese , Pri?me, 
Minister, in a talk with a Japanese 
'newspaper editor in April, 1967, said he 
believed the Americans would lose' 
because they had failed to achieve their1 
two main objectives: the destruction of' 
the National Liberation Front, and the 
expansion of the pacified areas in; 
,South Vietnam. ' 
As Hanoi saw it, 'Saigon had failed 
:to achieve the strong rear that General 
,Vo Nguyen Giap always regarded as 
the decisive factor in a revolutionary 
(war. Other things were going for them 
the North Vietnamese reckoned: bet-
ter and more experienced leadership 
and training for ..this type of war; the 
'advantages of fighting on one's own 
terrain among one's own people; 
morale; the too rapid rotation of U.S. 
forces and their lack of familiarity with 
local and tropical conditions; political 
and other problems encountered by 
the Americans in pouring large nurn-
hers of troops into 'Vietnam; the strain 
on the U.S. economy in supplying forces 
'fighting thousands of miles, from the' 
home base; and the excessive proper-
tion of reafr-line American troops. 
General Nguyen Ohi Thanh., who 
commanded the Oomrnimist 'forces in 
the field until his death in 1967, set 
out to force the Americans to split and 
scatter' their forces and to fight in areas' 
where there was no dlear-cut line and 
no targets. He hoped to prevent them 
from bringing their full combat effici-
ency into operation and to deny them 
the opportunity to gain strategic advan-
tage. By the tactic of hitting the 
!Americans in many places while keep; 
Ing sufficient forces m reserve to mass 
heavy fighting power in key areas, by 
concentrating and dispersing quicklyi 
by fighting big battles or combining 
.big battles with small battles, and; by 
avoiding at all cost the normal Set-
piece action, he believed that Victory 
could be denied to the United States 
,however large the force it committed,' 
Until at last it tired of the war. 
Then came the Tet offensive. It 
shattered the indigenous Viet Cong 
forces and their vital cadre system in 
the hamlets, caused fearful casualties 
among the North Vietnamese ranks, 
:and dismayed Hanoi when the general 
uprising failed to materialise. ? But it 
also ? had the much-sought-after effect 
of causing the war-weary Americans to 
demand an end. 
Everything that happened thereaftd 
?the declaration of personal 
surrender by President John-
son, the protracted halt in the 
bombing, the Paris talks, the' 
Guam Doctrine, Vietnamisa-
tion, and all the rest?repre-
sented the signal lowering of 
-American sights, the abandon-
ment of American hopes of 
winning u military victory and of , 
reinstating .South Vietnam as a 
"pearl in the crown of the free: 
world." to borrow one of the, 
descriptions of the offi-1 
dal American propagandists 
in the late 1950s. 
Despite all these unfortunate 
consequences, however, Tet put 
the 'emphasis, where it should

willing to try to do it for them. 
Without ' American air sup-

North Vietnamese ports, it is

could have held the Northern

with his Easter offensive in 
'1972. After a poor beginning,:

Henry A. Kissinger, arriving in Peri* 
aboard a special Air Force plane, said:1 
'"President Nixon has 'sent me back 
,to make one more major effort to, 
conclude the negotiations," 
Le Due The, arriving from Hanoi' 
by wa3/ of Peking and Moscow, sai4 
"The decisive moment has come either' 
; to sign the agreed-upon accord or 
? continue the war." 
Once again the White House advi:.* 
and the Communist revolutionary, 
plunged list week into the intricacies! 
of the draft agreement that seemed last 
, October. to offer the. United States 11,1 
,way out of Vietnam. This time there 
'was 'a sense that their new round of 
meetings would either rescue the mil 
cord and bring it to fruition or leacc' 
Ito a final collapse. 
As the talks, begun Monday, worei 
on, the North Vietnamese Communist; 
party newspaper Nhan Dan reportedi 
"bad signs" of American intransigence. 
But there was no real news, and few 
clues, as to whit really was going o 
behind the dosed doors in Paris. . 
Yesterday ,evening Mr. Kissinger 
flew back to report to President Nixon 
at' the Florida White House at Key 
Biscayne, amid indications that the 
;talks had made at least some *ogress. 
From Washington; Bernard Gwertzman 
'of The New York Times supplied the 
,following assessment: 
'That's His Message' 
One Republican Senator who at-
tended a White House breakfast meet.: 
ing on the eve of the new round of 
talks in Paris was impressed by Mr., 
Nixon's determination not to be de-
terred by Congressional or public critl-, 
;clam in his pursuit of what he called 
"the proper kind of settlement." "The; 
'President obviously sees himself thrusts 
into a critical moment in history," the 
Senator said.' "He believes he is doing 
the right thing and believes that his-, 
tory will bear him out. That was his 
message as I saw it." 
Many thought, in fact, that the 
.situation was producing for Mr. Nixon 
another of the personal crises that 
have been a feature of his political 
life. Nothing would please him morel 
'than to surprise the world once again', 
?this time with a Vietnam settlement! 
on the eve of his inauguration.; Not'i 
only would such an announcemen0 
clear the capital's streets of the war; 
protesters who are gathering their,:

esterday mean that Mr. Nixon wouldi 
be able to offer some welcome newt. 
on the eve of his inauguration? No harcP, 
information was yet available, buti 
-Ronald L. Ziegler, the White Hous61 
press secretary, clearly Intended to 
leave an optimistic impression when 
he told newsmen early yesterday morn-
ing that the negotiations in Paris had: 
been "serious."' 
? 
In the White House jargon, "serious", 
has taken on a meaning of its own. It 
has been used to signify progressl 
When the White House has wanted td 
signify the opposite, it has charged 
Hanoi with a lack of "seriousness" at 
the negotiating table. Moreover, the 
Administration has said the bombing 
raids north of the 20th parallel woul 
`remain suspended as long as the neg 
'Cations were conducted in a "serious" 
manner. 
? Mr. Kissinger, talking briefly wit 
reporters at Orly airport before board , 
Ing his plane, said he had had "veryi 
extensive and very useful negotiations' 
with Mr. Tho. Hanoi's special envoy 
will remain in Paris, Mr. Kissinger saidcj 
and the two will keep in touch throug 
diplomatic channels. The North Viet 
names? delegation issued a brief state 
,ment of itt own, saying the secre 
'talks "have made progress." 
Mr. Kissinger's remarks implied-that 
the final decision was now President 
Nixon's. He said he Will meet with 
Mr. Nixon, and "the President willethen 
decide what steps should be taken to 
speed a peace of justice and concilivi 
tion." 
, What are the issues Mr: Nixon deems 
enicial to that kind of accord? 
Mr. Nixon, at the breakfast meeting, 
, named three: the release of American' 
prisoners, an effective cease-fire and? 
the right of all South Vietnamese to 
:decide their own future. These point 
have been at the heart of the negotiat. 
Ing,process ever since it began. ? ., 
, PRISONERS ?On what terms should' 
the American prisoners be returned?. 
In return for the withdrawal of the 
'remaining American forces, as sped.' 
fled in the nine-point October accord, 
'or in return for the release of all mill-
'tary and political prisoners held by 
the Saigon Government, as suggested 
subsequently by the North Vietnamese? 
CEASE-FIRE Should the tease. 
fire be limited to the two Vletnams4 
as stated in the October accord, or 
broadened, ? as sought now by the 
United States, to include Laos and 
Cambodia? Should the demilitarized 
zone between North and South Viet-'? 
nem be re-established, as urged by 
Washington, even though Hanoi does 
not want to recognize a permanent 
division of the country? What kind of 
International supervision? The 5,000-
man force wanted by Washington or 
the small 250-man team proposed by 
Hanoi? . 
VIETMAN?No question has ? 
proven more difficult to solve than 
this One. What should be the scope of 
, the Council for National Reconcilia-
tion provided for by the October? 
accord? Should the agreement recog-
Anize the Vietcong's claims to being a 
government in South Vietnam, or 
recognize only the Saigon Govern-
ment, or both, or none? What about 
? North Vietnam's troops in South Viet., 
? nom? Should they have legal status? 
In Paris, observers could find little . 
to go on about Just where matters 
stood.. After six dayi cif talks, Flora, 
Lewis of The New York Times had this': 
to say: 
'Squaring the Circle' 
Still the negotiators raced across 
Paris behind their motorcycle escorts 
to and from their alternating meeting 
,pltkces. Still the bombers dropped their, 
loads on North Vietnam below the 20th 
'parallel and Hanoi kept strengthening: 
Its air defenses for the day when, per.), 
haps, that line will, again be breached.i 
Still officials spoke anonymously4 
about the current "sticking point" , 
,which, with a little more effort, might 
soon be hurdled with a compromise' 
that would bring peace. 
It was a repetitiOn, in many re- t 
spects, of October and November and 
December, when the tame people had 
expressed the same hope for a cease-.; 
fire?by Election Day, they thought. 
at first, then by Thanksgiving, then by ; 
Christmas, then before the opening of 
Ithe new Congress. And the "sticking 
point" has shifted from the presence 
of North Vietnamese troops in the 
South to the Saigon government* 
sovereignty over all Sotlth Vietnam 
to the precise definition of the 
larized zone that cuts Vietnam in two. 
These are different ways of defining: 
the same Issue ? whether the peace' 
accord is to divide the Vietnamese. 
nation into two states with conflicting 
? social systems or whether it is to per, 
mit the South to be moved gradually, 
into Hanoi's orbit and eventnally, 
absorbed. That is the political issue 
.over which the war has been fought. 
from the beginning. 
The permanent delegates of ? the 
three, Vietnamese delegations?Hanoi., 
the Provisional Revolutionary Govern., 
meat (Vietcong) and Saigon?set aside, 
all the lesser questions at the public' 
meetings that continued last week/ 
parallel to the secret ,Kissinger-Tho 
talks. All three delegations restated, 
the central political issue--firrnlyi to? 
make clear that their positions had not 
changed. Only the American delegate, 
urged "moderation" in language. 
, Therein, experienced diplomatic ob.' 
servers believe, has been the negotlat-' 
lng problem. Mr. Kissinger has been 
seeking language that would permit14 
the United States to get (tut of the 
war without appearing to have fought: 
In vain and to have abandoned its ally 
?language that each side can inter-
pret to its own satisfaction. He needs 
Saigon's assent to get the' kind of 
neatly packaged settlement he wants 
from Hanoi. He needs concessions 
from Hanoi to get Saigon's assent. 
The October draft satisfied Hanoi 
because it undermined Saigon's goal, 
of art independent, insulated, anti-, 
Communist South Vietnam. The nego. 
Cations since then have been an at-
tempt to win equal satisfaction for. 
Saigon. The formula for squaring the 
circle has been the tough job confront.. 
frig the Paris negotiators." 
? 
If President Nixon does reach 'art 
agreement with Hanoi, he will doubt-
,less try to obtain Saigon's acceptance' 
.of its ternis, in line with his promisel 
not to "impose" a settlement on the 
South Vietnamese ally. And from Sai.' 
? gon yesterday Craig R.. Whitney of 
The New York Tittles reported on 4' 
certain shift of attitude: 
'President Nguyen Van Thien 
concluded that he has won the most, 
he could hope to get in the way of,1 
;concessions from the Americans?and,1 
,even .more important, that he won 
three months' breathing -space by 
stalling on the draft accord of last 
October. That is the word now thong 
Government officials close to the Pres.; 
idential Palace. ? 
' Mr. Thleu, according to these men, 
Is. now confident enough of the Amer-
ican bargaining position to expect that 
? anylinal agreement will include,guar-
anteet of a relatively leak-free demill. 
? tarized zone between North and South 
, Vietnam and a strong international 
force to supervise the cease-fire and 
? keep an eye on the 145,000 North, 
'Vietnamese troops scattered about the 
South. 
" That, and a statement of some kind 
:about the legitimacy of the Saigon 
Government' below the 17th parallel,' 
will probaby make it easier for hbni 
to accept an agreement that does not 
,call for the withdrawal' of the Corn. 
Munist troops. The best estimate here 
is that he/ will not raise new objec-i 
:tions if Mr. kissinger obtains that kindi 
of agreement from Hanoi. 
_ Acceptance of Saigon as the legit1-1 
mate government of the South, hoW4'1, 
ever, looks from here like a confession( 
'of 'defeat by the North Vietnamese, 
and few realists belieVe the Commu-
E nists have been defeated. There's the41 
.catch: Is a formula possible that will '.. 
satisfy both sides? Mr. Thlen's aides 
apparently are dubious. 
`. What it boils down to is that Pres17',; 
deft Thieu now feels the Americans: 
are not going to compromise his .`posi.. 
tion as drastically as they would have, 
'if the October agreement had been4 
signed, So he's resigned to a cease-fire( 
?if the Americans can get it: 
The Government, at any rate, W 
preparing either'for suecess or failure 
of the Paris talks. 
If there is no peace fairly soon, Mr. 
Thieu is afraid the United States Con-,1 
grese may cut off all military and eco-; 
.nomic aid to South Vietnam as a way: 
of forcing President Nixon to with-1 
draw from the War. That worries the 
South Vietnamese leaders almost as 
much as the possibility of an unfavor.: 
able agreement. ? 
It is for that reason that Mr. Thiel', 
is sending 20 pro-Government legis-1 
fators and official escorts to Wash-
ington to lay his pleas for continued'.' 
support before individual America& 
Senators and Congressmen. As one 'of4, ? 
the envoys put it, "We will try to ei-
plain to them how complicated things 
are in South Vietnam and why it isn't 
that easy to end the war." 
On the other hand,' if there Is a', 
cease-fire, Mr. 'Mien will be up against' 
stiff Communist political competition.' 
The Government is laying plans to' 
clap Communist sympathizers in, 
prison, impose strict controls on the: 
domestic press and foreign corre.' 
spondents, and maintain a strong mili-
tary posture against any Communist, 
violations of the cease-fire. The Gov..

at blue and red cloth at the Saigon 
docks because MO can be made Int?

Obscurity clouds the reasons why the murderous

'December 30. For the sake of. face, President 
Nixon has to believe publicly that the' Ms

use the same tactics again. Statements from the

The damage inflicted by the B52s has been 
appalling. Their use is a lasting stain.on President

'Scandinavia

Sharp reactions to last month's resump-? 
tion of tull-scale American bombing 
df North Vietnam were widespread in 
Scandinavia. Shortly after the new B-52 
attacks began on December t8th, ,the 
Danish prime minister, Mr Anker 
joergensen, issued a strongly critical 
comment and added that he might , 
press for a discussion in Nato of Mr. 
Nixon's actions. The Finnish foreign 
minister, Mr Ahti Karjalainen, declared 
that the ease for the bombing raids was 
"especially difficult ' to understand." 
The Swedish foreign minister' Mr 
Krister Wickman, condemned the 
bombing as "blind and brutal." The 
chairman of the 'Danish trade union 
Ifederation, Mr Thomas Nielsen, called 
1,for a Europe-wide boycott of American 
i products. The Norwegian foreign 
minister, Mr Dagfinn Vaarvik, 'served 
warning that his government would

'What Can We Do?' 
. By V ercors 
PARIS ? Where-rs the difference? 
Between the devastation. of Guernica 
by the planes of Hitler and the devas-
tation of Hanoi by those of Mr. Nixon, 
where is the difference? Between the? 
raids of terror over Hanoi to force the 
Vietnamese to surrender and the raids 
of terror over Warsaw to fdrce the 
-Polish, over Rotterdam to force the 
Dutch to surrender, over Coventry to 
force the British (but Churchill did not 
. surrender and the Vietnamese do not) 
where is the difference? Between the 
shredded infants of Spain and the 
shredded infants of Hanoi? At the time 
of Guernica, Warsaw, Rotterdam and, 
Coventry what raised the world's con-
science with a sacred horror was the 
recurrence, by the will of one man 
and his military advisers, of the most 
barbarous, the cruelest, the most hor-
rifying, the most homicidal means to 
win a politiqal design. It was the 
return to Sardanapalus and to Nero 
,multiplied by ten, multiplied by a hun-
dred. The world fought five years 
against that, against the incredible 
return of forgotten practices, that 
one thought had disappeared forever. 
America was not the least fierce nor 
? .the least sincere in that struggle to 
establish between nations a minimum 
of civilized relations. It was AMerlda 
which by its initiative (the creation of 
the U.N.) showed most visibly that 
will of healing. And now it Is Ameriea 
today that brings back Guernica, War-
saw,' Rotterdam?that brings ? us the 
equivalent of Hiroshima. In order to 
i make an adversary surrender and to 
make a political design succeed. 
, During more than'twent years, how 
many have' not been able to return 
, to Germany because they would not 
!, know what hands would be offered 
th re to grasp, if those that would be 
, held out to shake would not be stained' 
by the blood of the innocent. For a 
whole people were silenced by Hitler, 
hid submitted at first, then accepted 
,and covered up his crimes. A. cour-
ageous resistance had Strtiggled there 
) 
in the 'beginning, a few months and 
' then' there was no more resistance. 
And that is recurring?this time in , 
: America! There have been without' 
doubt a few beautiful and courageous , 
movements of protest, of opposition? 4 
but now? One listens closely, but If 
anything remains it is very weak, and, 
In spite of the few brave ones still 
left, they are obliterated in the soft : 
silence of a consenting population.' 
And will it happen that we will not 
be able to shake the hand of one of 
these Americans as we could no longer 
shake the hand of a German not So 
very long ago? 
But ,if this is true for us what c rt. 
we do? We weep and I weep, that 
comforts. You will say to me what 
else can we do? I don't know, I don't 
know. Seeing that Russia doesn't 
dare anything, that China can't, that 
Europe doesn't virant to, Mr. Nixon 
and his Pentagon feel themselves all 
powerful, and this power intoxicates 
them. They feel they are masters Of 
the world. They know they can, if they 
want, do ten times worse than Hitler 
without risking the same fate, and 
this .power intoxicates them. And we 
know that at least for the near future, 
they will do what they want without 
anyone opposing it. For the momenti 
they are content with transposing an 
entire land' into a lunar landscape and; 
an entire people Into deadmen from'i 
out of the Stone Age. And perhaW 
before having totally arrived to thatl 
point, they will have in effect, byl 
means of blood and suffering, Imposedl 
their political design on Indochina, as 
Hitler did on the Spanish, the Polish, l, 
the Dutch. And if that ever happens 
It will be more horrible. Because the 
Nero-like shadow of Nixon will hover? 
over all, of' us ..who will have done. 
nothing tp have stopped him. And we , 
will believe we are free when* it will 
no longer be but the surveillant free-

diate group is not only amorphous 
but divided by rivalries and jea-
lousies and dominated by paro-
chial issues so that they are un-
able to express theft protest in 
unison against what is happening 
In Vietnam. One recalls how 
Nehru reacted in 1954 to the crisis 
in Indo-China and put forward 
proposals which found acceptance 
In the Geneva agreem4nts, 
Times have changed, of course, 
but what are the other fathers of 
non-alignment. if ows may use 
such a phrase, doing in the pre; 
sent crisis/ Have the non-aligned 
nations been so mesmerised by 
the fear of American might that 
they have not so far concerted 
any serious efforts to arouse and 
organise world opinion over this 
pre-eminent 'moral and political 
issue of our times? Or, are some 
or other of this group of nations 
so pre-occupied with not embar-
rassing Washington or Moscow' or 
Peking that they have considered 
discretion to be the better part of 
non-alignment and not audacity 
which distinguished it in its effec-
tive days? Or, is it that some of 
them find the diplomatic leverage 
provided by the Sino-Soviet. rift 
much too valuable In their na-
tional interests to do anything for 
Vietnam that might upset that 
happy state of affairs? 
If the Asians, the Africans and 
he non-aligned are not powerful-
ly stirred by the  
? then it cannot be expected that 
g other peoples and governments 
will be. It concerns Ahem more 
d vitally than the European and the 
- American powers. What is involv-
ed is the principle of the right of 
t a small nation to resist dictation 
. and bullying by a super-power, 
t 
apart from the utterly hutnan as-
pects of the Vietnam situation. 
Some of the smaller countries of 
South East Asia who are Afraid of 
Hanoi's expansionism and are 
eagerly trying to play up to Pek-
ing or Moscow, or Washington 
might remember that they have 
more at stake in this principle than 
/any other countries in the world. 
( One most unfortunate feature of 
world reaction to the Vietnam cri-
? sia is that Asia has not taken a 
stand as Asia on this poignant and 
predominantly Asian issue. 
The nations of this continent 
' have referred to be ruled b 
mutualfears of their own wee 
neighbours than of those Great 
Powers who really pose the poten-
tial threat to, their freedoni and 
" indepeedence. The absence of 
Asian consultations on Vietnam is 
conspicuous evidence of this. Aus-
tralia and New Zeeland under 
their new Governments appear to 
have done a little better in their 
butspoken stand.e 
World Opinion 
The Vietnam lame has es fit 
evaded the attention of that 
august international forum, the 
United Nations. Hitherto one could 
have argued that intervention by 
the United Nations would have 
only complicated the problem 
rather than helping to solve it 
None of the parties concerned, in-
eluding the Democratic Republic, 
of Vietnam, was in Savour of tak-. 
tug the, matter to the United Ne-
tons. But had not the moment 
come, when the world had no other 
,c,hofce, fpr a simple and massive 
demonstration of world public opi-
nion against the Amertcan bomb-
ings, spontaneously and powerful-
ly expressed in the forum -of the 
UN General Assembly/ 
day annihilation of Carthage by 
the Romans was done in a strug-
gle between equals and there 
was perhaps more honour in that 
carnage than in what has been 
happening in Vietnam. 
Salvage Operation 
'the Vietnam war is one between 
the elephant and the ant?between 
the electro. dynamic -mechanical 
might of a super-power and the 
Indomitable will-power of a small 
undeveloped nation. In the long 
and dismal history of violent eon-
Bleb, it is the nearest one could 
? get to the Gandhian type of con-
frontation between soul-force and 
brute-force. And the war is not 
over any great issue of power or 
Ideology, but over the pride and 
prestige of the President of the 
greatest power on earth. Western 
t writers have written so much on 
;oriental face, ? but has there ever 
been in history an example of 
face-saving carried to such .nor-
mous and tragic proportions. 
? The Americans first went Into 
Vietnam in what they proclaimed 
to be a glorious crusade against 
Communism represented by the 
Imonolithic Sino-Soviet bloc, 
though at bottom it was really 
even then, a dirty -pro-colonial 
I salvage operation Later when 
they found that the Soviet Union 
wee interested in a peaceful set-
tlement in Vietnam, they said that 
' the crusade was against Chinese 
Communist expansionism. Later 
still when they discovered that 
the Chinese devils were only too 
eager to parley and make peace 
with them, they have Come to the 
conclusion that what they have 
been fighting against was Vietna-
mese Communism and its imperi-
alist urge to dominate Indo-China! 
One may safely predict that soon, 
and not too late, they will find 
out that what they have been 
and are up against is Vietnamese 
nationalism, passionate and un-
conquerable. 
There in Vietnam, political na-
tIonalism has been converted into 
an incandescent spiritual force. 
Nothing else can explain the 
extraordinary fact that after all 
this overmastering application of 
military pressure, this callous 'sus-
pension of effective supporting 
action by !ha divided and the so-
e am s 
still fighting valiantly and is bound 
to. come out of this cruel conflict 
"bloody but unbowed." 
World reaction to the resump-
tion of bombing of North Vietnam 
I, a mirror of the temper. of our 
times. A few years ago there 
were massive demonstrations and 
protest marches of youth all over 
the United States which nearly 
brought the administration to its 
knees, at least psychologically. 
Where are the protest marchers 
and the flower-children of yes-
terday, when today even more 
horrible and unjustifiable crimes 
are committed against a heroic 
people simply because they will 
not surrender? No doubt the New 
York Times has made an appeal 
'to Americans "in the name of 
conscience and country" to "speak 
out for sanity in Washington and 
peace in Indo-China." But the 
sad fact of the matter is that 
American public opinion is a weak 
reed indeed to lean upon. Once 
American boys are not ? dying in 
the battlefields, but only Viebia-
opese are massacred from ,the air, 
there is no swell of humanitarian 
mass opinion in the United States 
against the Vietnam war as be-
fore. One is forced to question 
'fundamentally the liberal core in 
American life and politics. 
Supine China ? 
The behaviour of the rest of the 
world in this crisis is not very 
admirable either. The Chinese 
used to proclaim their unbreak-
able solidarity with their Vietna-
mese brethren. Their favourite 
simile for solidarity was "the lip 
and teeth" relationship between 
the Chinese and the Vietnamese. 
Some lip, some teeth!! Certainly, 
Mao Tse-tung and his great wer-
riors of national liberation strug-
gles are today doing nothing 
more than lip-service and even 
that in a very subdued measure. 
The root cause of Vietnam's 
helplessness and the apparent tri-
umph of the bullying tactics of 
President Nixon is the Sino-Soviet 
conflict and the all-too-supine will. 
Ingness of China to allow Wash-
ington to exploit this split. From 
19e5 onwards Hanoi has been ad- t 
vocating united Socialist action on 
.Vietnam tragedy. 
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
11 January 1973 
Canadian sadness 
? The Canadian Parliament's unanimous 
resolution deploring the bombing of 
Hanoi and Haiphong was an expression of 
national sadness over recent devel-
opments in Vietnam. 
All parties in the House of Commons 
supported the government-sponsored 
resolution. ? 
This mark of disapproval of American 
policy does not constitute a precedent. In 
1971 the Canadian House unanimously 
adopted a resolution condemning the 
American nuclear test at Amchitka ism 
land in the Aleutians. 
? None of the. Canadian parties has , 
16 supported the American administration 
That might have provided that 
extra little push necessary to make 
the parties move on to the final 
act of settlement in Vietnam, and 
might also have had the effect of. 
giving a shot in the arm to the 
United Nations which ha i been 
fast becoming a pedestrian debat-
ing society where pale bureaucrats 
from all the corners Of the earth 
come to perform as Pompotei 
In-
ternational diplomats. 
over the war in Vietnam, and the 
Trudeau overnment has privately ex-
pressed its regret over continuation of 
the war to Washington. 
If the Parliament's Vietnam resolution 
was no great surprise, its adoption as-
sumes greater impact when added to the 
wave of denunciations of the bombing of 
Hanoi coming from friends and allies of 
the United States around the world, and 
particularly from Europe, and from Aus-
tralia.and New Zealand. ?  
It is part of a worldwide sadness at. 4: 
seeing a great power like the United 
States get caught up in a situation where 
It finds it necessary to use its bombers 
against civilian centers at a stage in the 
war when peace seems within its grasp.

Australio-U.S. Viet Raids Rift 
1 By H. D. S. Greenway ; 
I. Wastifoston Post Staff Writer 
Last week Australia's mark 
time unions ended a 124ay; 
boycott of American ship-, 
ping, which had been im-
posed in protest of U.S. 
Christmas bombing of list;i 
and American long-, 
rnhoremen ended their - 
:counter boycott, which hati-1 
tiled up some $20 million 
Rvorth of Australian goods in. 
{U.S. ports. 
The renewed bombing 
;Precipitated the closest 
;thing to a crisis in Austra-
lian-American relations that 
hilplomats could remember 
!?but by last week boths 
,aides were tying to restore, 
the atmosphere of good will 
,which the two countries 
have so long enjoyed. 
1 Three ministers in Austra-
Ha's new Labor government, 
which came to power last 
Month after 23 years in op-
position, had publicly criti--
Icized U.S. bombing policy. 
1Tom Uren, .Australia's new 
ttninister .for urban and re-
gional development, accused 
President Nixon of "arro-
gance and hypocrisy." 
I In the United States,' 
where the Australians had 
been hoping to get; in on a 
' bonanza created by a tempo-
rary increase in the import' 
quote for dried milk, it was 
announced on Dec. 30 that 
the increased imports would 
be bought on a first-come- , 
&et-serve basis only until' 
Feb. 15. 
Since it 'takes about six . 
weeks to ship goods from 4 
Australia to the United j 
States, the ruling seemed 
tailor-made bY the Nixon ad-
ministration to shut the 
Australians out. 
The State Department, 
however, went out of its way 
to play down the difficulties. 
;The State Department's of& 
dal spokeman was in-
structed to express only .! 
"concern," rather than pro-
test over the boycott, and he 
iipoke of the long and I 
"exceedingly close" relation-
Ships between Australia and 
the United States that was 
based on "respect and even ! 
itdmiration" between the, 
two 
two conntrles. 
Last reek Australia's new 
prime minister, Gough Whit.? 
lam, also went out of his ! 
way to 'disassociate himself; 
from personal attacks onj 
President Nixon, and said 
that had it not been for the 
renewed bombing, "relations 
between the present Austra-
lian government and the 
:United States government 
. would be better than they, 
' have ever been since the 
'Second World War." 
Beyond the bombing and, 
the boycott, there were 
.clear indications that Aus-
trails was planning 'a new j 
and more independent role,i 
.in world affairs. ? 
Since the Labor govern'? 
snent came to power in De-
cember, Australia has ended', 
, conscription', pulled torn-1 
.pletely out of the Vietnam., 
war and cut off all military; 
aid to both South Vietnam 
find Cambodia. ? 
Prime Minister Whitram 
also said that the Austraii'aitj 
'battalion of troops in Singe. 
pore would not be replaced 
*hen it becomes due for ro-
!teflon at the end of 1973. 
The troops are there under, 
a ,five-power defense agree? 
ment between Great Britain, 
Australia, New Zealand, Sin.' 
gapore and Malaysia. 
Whitlam left his optiona 
open, however, and 'said's, 
nothing about the Austra-
lian squadron of Mirage jets 
,in Malaysia. 
On the diplomatic front 
the new government has 
recognized China and ended: 
relations with Taiwan, rec-
ognized East Germany and 
taken a much tougher stand: 
against Rhodesia in the 
United Nations. 
But when Australia's am-
bassador, Sir James Plim-
loll, returned here last week 
from consultations with the: 
new Australian government, 
he told Secretary of State , 
William P. Rogers that the 
"Anzus" defense treaty be-
tween Australia, New Zea-
land and the United States I 
still remains the corner. , 
stone of Australia's defense 
planning, and that the new 
government had no immedi-
ate plans- for withdrawing' 
from the now moribund 
Southeast Asia Treaty Or-
ganization. 
There have been two dis-
tinct periods in Australian' 
foreign policy since the Aus-
tralian states were feder-
ated in 1901, and the coming 
to power of the Labor Party 
last month may signal the 
beginning of a third. 
The first dates from April 
25, 1915 when Australian 
and New Zealand forces' 
landed on the Gallipoli pen-' 
Insula of Turkey as part of 
the allied Dardenelles cam-
paign in World War I. The 
date, "Anzac Day," is a na-
tional holiday in Australia. 
The campaign ended up a 
disaster for the allies, but 
,the Australians and New 
Zealanders fought well and, 
as in the case of the Light ? 
Brigade in the Crimea and, 
Dulikirk in World War II, ? 
:plucky defeats are often. I 
found more worthy of com-
memoration than /here vie.' 
tory. 
To Australians, participa-
tion in World War I meant 
coming of age in world af-
fairs. But foreign policy was 
still closely linked to Brillsh 
policy. 
Thus when World War ir 
,broke out in Europe, Austra-
lia sent her divisions to 'the 
iNorth African desert to 
'fight alongside the British. 
With the coming of thej 
Pacific war and the fall of 
Singapore, Australia found 
'herself with her armies half! 
j-a, world away and the 
mill-
tary might of Japan sweep-, 
j.Ing down upon her. 
I' Against Winston Church.: 
lira wishes, Australia or, 
dered her troops home. The, 
:Battle of the Coral Sea in' 
!May, 1942, marked the be.' 
:ginning of a new era in Aus-
tralian foreign policy. 
In that battle, American 
; naval air power turned back 
the Japanese fleet off the 
Queensland Coast, and Aus-
4tralia decided then and 
there that her best defense 
lay in the closest possible al-
liance with the United 
States. 
It 'hae been said that Pres-
"dent Lyndon B. Johnson - 
collected on the Coral Sea 
debt when he asked Austxa.. 
18 
Eases 
Ha to join in his Vietnam 
enterprise. But at the time, 
there was popular support'

Ameriarts. aid for Hanoi

By Trudy Rubin 
? Staff writer of 
The Christian Science Monitor ? 
? Boston: 
? The recently announced campaign by U.S, 
antiwar activists to raise $3 million to rebuild 
, the shattered Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi is; 
1? the latest and most dramatic episode in' a 
' small but growing phenomenon: 
Sending humanitarian aid by American 
; organizations to a country with which the 
: United States is engaged in battle. 
Moreover, some of this aid has been 
officially licensed by the United States.

f the State Department, Department of De-
fense, and the White House, creating a

; ing to Treasury and other government 
1 sources. \ , 1, 
, These sources make quite .clear that the 
major purpose of granting the licenses is the 
? hope of gaining information on prisoners of 
war via the organizations transporting the 
aid ? mainly medical supplies ? into North 
yietnam. 
890,000 in equipment 
The Bach Mai campaign is being run by , 
i Medical Aid to Indo-China (MAI), A Cam-
, bridge, Mass,-based group formed about 18 
months ago by a group of Boston doctors, 
( \ health workers, and antiwar activists to send 
medical supplies to the civilian health ser-1 
vices of North Vietnam and the Communist.' 
I controlled areas of South Vietnam, Cam-
bodia, and Laos. 
MAI says it has sent nearly $90,000 of 
? equipment *to these areas,' including pace-
' makers and electrocardiograph machines. 
MAI requested information from the Trea-
sury Department on licenses, but never 
, applied for them, and has sent its material ; 
without them. 
? This renders the group. liable for prose-' 
cution under the 1917 Trading With the + 
-Enemy Act. (There has been noindication of, 
possible prosecution, but MAI sources say 1 
the Department of Commerce has requested 
specific details about two shipments of ! 
American-made medical supplies to North 
Vietnam.) 
$3 million sought 
MAI hopes to raise $3 million to rebuild 
Bach Mai, including more than $250,000 
raised over the past two weeks. But the 
. spokesmen also say no decision has been 
? reached about applying for licenses for the 
, Bach Mai materials. 
The other principal group sending medical , 
supplies, however, has applied for, and been 
granted, three licenses totaling $115,000 by 
. the Treasury and Commerce Departments 
* (one in 1969, two in 1971, and a renewal in 
1972), after being refused a license in 1968.: 
. (Treasury issues license8. for monetary re-
tnittaneee to hostile countries: ,Commerce. 
issues them for American-made goods.) 
The American Friends Service Committee? 
(Quaker), with h tradition of humaitarian 
giving on both sides of a conflict that includes, 
the Spanish Civil War and the Chinese civil, 
war, has delivered open-heart-surgery mate-
rials and electrocardiographs to the Viet Duo 
hospital in Hanoi and to the North Vietnam-
ese Red Cross Society. (The AFSC also runs a 
rehabilitation center in South Vietnam.) 
Funneling via Geneva 
In addition, the United Presbyterian '1 
Church and the Episcopal Church of Amer-
ica have begun fund drives, starting in latil 
1972, specifically aimed at medical aid for 
Nprth Vietnam. 
This money, in addition to funds raised by 
the National Council of Churches, is funneled , 
through the Geneva-based World Council of 
Churches, thus avoiding the need for U.S. ,) 
licenses. The U.S. contribution since 1965 by 
the National Council has amounted to $75,000; 
the Presbyterians in their 1972 drive have so 
? far raised $18,000; and the Episcopalians, 
: $1,000 so far. 
i? 
A combination of striiigent U.S. regulations 
and lack of access to Germany made humani-
tarian giving impossible during World War I 
II, while North Korea, according to State 
' Department sources, would not' grant access. 
to U.S, voluntary agencies during the Korean 
'war. 
? 
'Two conditions posed 
Granting licenses during the current con-
, filet, however, is not without some ostrings, 
? which MAI has so far declined to accept. j 
According to Stanley Summerfield, acting ,! 
director of the Foreign Assets Control Pro-
!,? gram of the Treasury Department, which ? 
; licenses remittances to North Vietnam (with 
specific time and dollar limits), the basic 
requirements are two: 
First licenses are issued on a "huma:nitar; 
ian basis," he says, provided there is "satis-
factory assurance that an impartial observer ' 
will be able to witness the distribution" of the 
supplies. 
The second request (Mr. Summerfield says 
that"requirement is not the correct word ? 
;-'it might be a hope") is that "the shipment 1 
will increase our information about the', 
POWs." He adds' vigorously, "We're non 
'interested in helping North Vietnam for the. 
sake of helping North Vietnam. We want 
something out of it." 
Only AFSC has applied 
; So far only the AFSC has applied for a; 
North Vietnam license. Mr. Summerfield 
declined to comment on whether a license 
: might be granted if applied for to a group like 
' MAI, which identifies itself more openly with 
the North Vietnamese cause. "I would have 
to look at the case," he said. 
Until 1971 the Quakers carried letters for 
POWs on their visits with the knowledge of 
the State Department. But since the forma.' 
tion of the New York-based Committee of.

L. Though some antiwar groups argue, as do 
Some Quakers, that there should be no 
cooperation with the U.S. Ooverninent 
. sending humanitarian aid, Martin Teitel, 
Asian program director of the AFSC, says, 
"We think we can withstand being co-opted 
by the State Department." 
Attempting to witness deliveries has " 
proved troublesome to some would-be donors 
who say the North Vietnamese have been 
reluctant to allow Americans to accompany

the Quakers were refused permission to .

? But since then they have insisted success:; 
.fully ? as part of their emphasis on "a ? 
concern for people" ? that they send Quaker. 
representatives ?yith their medical supplies 
to Hanoi. 
North . Vietnamese Objections, he says, 
centered on claims that it would be too ' 
dangerous' for ciVilians to accompany the 
goods. 
The cost of the bombing 
They say that it takes between 50 and 
6o of the Russian-made Sam-2 rockets 
to hit one or the high-flying B-52 
bombers that the Americans are still 
sending from Guam and northern 
'Thailand to attack North Vietnam. If 
'so, Hanoi must now have better air 
'defences than most other capitals, since 
American losses during the raids north 
of the 20th parallel, which were called 
'off last Saturday, came as a shock to 
the Pentagon. According to American 
official figures, the North Vietnamese 
knocked out 15 B-52s' and a further 
six or seven are said to have been made 
unflightworthy. 
Whether these figures are entirely 
? reliable is open to doubt; American 
' spokesmen fumbled their statistics 
several times after the bombing of 
Hanoi began on December 18th. Hanoi 
'radio claims that 81 American aircraft 
/were brought down over Hanoi and 
',Haiphong between December 18th and 
December 29th, of which 34 were B-52s. 
'Those figures should be taken with an 
even bigger pinch of salt. But the 
financial cost to the Americans is not 
to be sneezed at, since the B-52s cost 
about ?.3m apiece. And it has /now 
been established that they are no longer 
invulnerable in the skies over Indo-
china. 
Nor, it seems, are they particularly 
accurate. It is hard to gauge the effects 
of the missions flown over Hanoi and 
Haiphong, since Pentagon sources have 
been reticent and the only reasonably 
objective sources in Hanoi were the 
reporters of the Agence France Presse. 
But the B-52s were apparently not 
'accurate enough to single out their 
"strategic targets" (mostly, communi-
cations and supply centres such as 
warehouses and port facilities) without 
inflicting serious damage on residential 
areas and civilian installations such as 
the Bach-Mai hospital, which is repor-
ted to have been completely destroyed 
during the attack on the neighbouring 
airfield, or the embassies not far from 
the main fuel depot, which was also 
destroyed. 
Instead of using the remote-control-
led "smart bombs,", the Americans 
appear to have relied mainly on carpet. 
pattern bombing. Under these condi-
tions, it was inevitable that many

voice remained soft and conversational 
i despite the emotion of his thoughts. 
"This time something has to change," 
Ihe said. "There has. been too much 
suffering?now there must be recon-
ciliation. The people in Saigon see it, 
the Provisional Revolutionary Govern-
ment sees it, Hanoi sees it. They have

back in 1954-55. He resigned because, 
as he puts it, "I found that Diem was 
a backward, reactiOnary man, and 
saw no hope for Vietnam." He slipped 
out of Saigon, past Diem's security 
men, and came to Paris. 
In his person Ho Thong reflects the 
tragedy of his country and of Amer-
ica's involvement in it. His aim is the ' 
one that Vietnatnese political. figures ' 
of all views avow: an independent .

civilian casualties would result, as 
Pentagon spokesman conceded just 
after Christmas. The only estimate of 
total civilian casualties provided 
so far 'came frort/ the director of a' 
Hanoi hospital, who claimed that, on 
average, 200 civilians had been killed 
and ,200? injured during each day of. 
the 'raids north of the 20th parallel. 
The North Vietnamese also say that 
during the 12 days, 1,318 people died 
in Hanoi alone. 
These raids were suspended on 
December 3oth, and on New Year's 
Day the North Vietnamese announced 
that they were ready to return to high-
level peace talks with the Americans. 
President Nixon's decision to suspend 
the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong 
was probably influenced both by the 
protests from many prominent Euro-
peans and by the declaration from the 
North Vietnamese that they would not 
resume talks?even at a purely techni-
cal level?uniil the raids were stopped. 
Mr Kissinger is expected to meet Le 
Duc Tho in Paris next week. 
The military effects of the Hanoi 
raids will be tested only in the event of 
a new communist offensive in the 
south, but American official sources 
have suggested privately that their 
cumulative effect had been to set the 
country back two years. On Tuesday 
the communist daily Nhan Dan urged 
the evacuation of the cities by all North 
Vietnamese whose services were not 
"essential to combat or production." 
, But North Vietnam's arms and 
ammunition, and an increasing propor? 
lion of its food, are brought in from 
Russia ? and China. So the destruction' 
of local industry will count far less than

Vietnam for 1972, Which was -going 
to use most of their own troops in 
Cambodia. Anyway, by late this 
summer intelligence reports put the 
Khmer Rouge's strength at 40,000 men 
?not all front-line soldiers, but 
including 40 to 6o battalions of 200 
or more men each, with Cambodian 
commanders. 
The big question is whether these 
amount !to an organised movement. 
Certainly the rebels in the maquis got 
there by very different routes. The 
majority are probably peasants 
impressed by the North -Vietnamese as 
coolies. Others are remnants of the 
old anti-Sihanouk Khmer Rouges. 
There are villagers who took to arms 
after suffering at the hands of the 
South Vietnamese army, and some 
common or garden bandits. But the 
available intelligence points to North 
Vietnamese-trained communists as, the 
chief force among the guerrillas.

converts, including some intellectuals 
who rebelled against Prince Sihanouk, 
together with the North -Vietnamese, 
have organised the aggressive Khmer 
Rouge units that went into action this 
summer. 
It is hard to get a clear idea of how 
much of the country they control. 
Much of Cambodia is no man's land, 
and has been for two years. But there 
is evidence from some areas of well 
organised villages with their own home 
guard. The relationship between the 
Cambodian guerrillas and the North 
Vietnamese will be very important if 
there is a ceasefire in Vietnam. Will 
North Vietnam want the guerrillas to ? 
stop fighting and try for a compromise, 
political sdlution, with or. without 
Sihanouk? They are a new factor in - 
the situation, which the Cambodian 
government cannot ignore.

to that? Is there any eaction from the Presi--Z,1

A. "No, I wouldn't reply to that." 
.It was only then that somebody though to ask 
the 'question and drew these stingy responses? i) 
Q. "Will there be a halt to the bombing of 
? North Vietnam?" 
A. "The President has ordered that all bomb-
ing will be discontinued above the 20th Parallel 1, 
' as long as serious negotiations are underway." 
`1 Q. "Effective when?" 
A. "I can't discuss ,the timing of military 
operations." 
Q. "Are we bombing right now, this minute?" , 
A. "I really can't discuss military operations 
from here." 
The press was still in the dark, and tried a 
f- new tack?
Q. "Did you say 'effective negotiations'?" 
A. "No, 'serious negotiations.', " 
Q. "You are implying then that it wouldn't 
halt until they actually start and we decide that 
); they are serious?" 
, To, this' Mr. Warren finally replied, "No, aS 
soon as it was clear that serious negotiations 
could be resumed at both the technical level 
and between the principals, the President ordered 
that all bombing be discontinued above the 20th 
Parallel." But the sparring continued, and after

rs Q. "Se the order has been made. In other 
I words the bombing halt is in effect?" 
A. "The order has been made." 
? 
* * * * ? 
' Q. "Has the order taken effect?" 
A. "I cannot discuss that." 
. Q. "But it has gone out?" 
" A. "That is correct. . . ." 
And after 13 more questions, which still shed 
r 
no further light on what had happened, the brief-
ing ended with this?
; Q. "Gerry, since you won't discuss the mili-
tary aspects, is it possible the Pentagon can tell 
us whether, like, from midnnight on, there was 
no more bombing? 
A. "It is possible. I just don't know." 
With the whole world waiting and on edged 
that is all the White House woulld say. The bare - 
record seems to reflect an ?arrogant contempt 
? for the press and for world opinion. 
, GERALD WARREN did not claim that the 
bombings had forced North Vietnam to the ne-
gotiating table. The North Vietnamese walked 
out on the negotiations because of the bombing, 
but said all along they woulld return when it . 
stopped. On the other hand when it did stop, 
, Vo Van Sung, their representative in Paris, de.' 
dared that the result of the large-scale bombing 
had been "a military and political defeat" -for 
the United States and "a strategic victorY forlur 
people." The bombing was undoubtedly a moral 
? and military defeat for Nixon. He not only sue-, 
ceeded in making the United States look like a 
bully in the eyes of the world but a bully who 
had suffered a well-deserved bloody nose. 
Like so much else about this disgraceful epi-
sode in our national history, most of what led ; 
up to the bombing is still secret. When the North 
Vietnamese and the PRG delegations walked 
out of the Paris talks on Dec. 21 to protest the 
' bombings, they charged that ever since the talks 
resumed in November the United States had 
threatened "two or three times daily" to break 
off talks and resume bombing north- of the 20th 
Parallel. 
The North Vietnamese spokesman, Nguyen 
? Thant' Le, told a press conference that day, "The 1 
241 
snore good will we showed, the more the Nixon ,j? 
(;Administration adopted an unreasonable attitude; 
t: the more we proved our flexibility, the more it ,) 
demanded fundamental modifications (of the 
5 agreed text) and the more the Nixon Administra-
tion used military pressure to (try to) subjugate 
If the other side's account is correct, these 
threats explain North Vietnam's order of Dec. 3 
, to begin evacuating all schoolchildren from Hanoi.' 
The United States has hot denied that threats 3 
, were made, but its propagandists have twisted ; 
the evacuation order to prove that "as of bee. 
3, Hanoi already was pimping to scuttle the ne- ; 
r gotiation." 
t This is on a par with Pentagon claims that 
7 if civilians were hurt in Hanoi it must have been 
their own fault because (a) Hanoi had shot down 
American planes and the debris had hit icivillans 
or (b) they were hit by debris from all those 
t SAM missiles. As the mugger said, if the victim .1 
hadn't resisted, he wouldnt have been hurt. 
IT IS HARD to decide which is worse?the ! 
? vindictive cruelty of the air raids or the lies told,' 
to excuse them. The most transparent of these 
lies was that the attacks on Hanoi and Haiphongi 
were needed to disrupt a new offensive. When g 
Nixon suspended the bombing above 'the 20th 
Parallel in October to express his satisfaction 
(then) with the agreement disclosed October 26, 
Aviation Week (October 30) carried a two-page 
summary of the results. It said the seven 
months of "Operation Linebacker," which Nixon 
launched last May 'II, bad "proven more effective, 
more crippling than the years of the Rolling 
Thunder operation" that Lyndon Johnson ended 
In October 1968. 
"Even should the cease-fire effOrts fail,"" 
Aviation Week reported, "they (i.e., U.S. military 
officials) believe the Communist supply. network 
has been so severely crippled that it will requirel 
months to repair." Similarly Michael Getlero 
Pentagon correspondent of the Washington Post? 
reported in that paper (Dec. 24), "Prior to the i 
renewed bombing no U.S. military commanders , 
were expressing any fears of a new North Viet-
namese assault." Intelligence reported that the 
other side was preparing for political rather than., 
.military action. 
No doubt great suffering was imposed on the 
civilian population and great damage on corn-
munications and transport as well as on remain.; 
Ing industrial and power facilities. But the price, 
was high enough to be humbling to the world's 
strongest-military power. 
To 'see the losses in perspective one mustt 
recall that the-B-62s were intended for the nu-
clear bombardment of the Soviet Union. Air ? 
Force sources said the average losses over Hanoi 
were no greater than expected?from 2 to 3 per-
cent of the planes participating. But reporters : 
could not find out whether this was the margin of '? 
loss expected in all-out nuclear war or in conven-
tional bombardment over the heavily defended 
Hanoi-Haiphong area. 
In nuclear war, even if only 2 to 3 percent 
get through the results would be terrible. One'; 
B-62 can carry enough nuclear weapons to wreck , 
a moderate-sized city. But in conventional war, 
a 2 to '3 percent rate loss is high, particularly 
when you are talking of a virtually irreplaceable 
aircraft like the B-52. A 2 percent rate means 
that in fifty days of concentrated bombing the 
entire fleet would be lost; a 3 percent rate would 
eat up a 11-83 fleet in 33 days or a llttle twee than

IN THE 11 days of concentrated bombing 
over Hanoi and Haiphong, he Air Force ad-
mitted to 15 B-52s shot down and later added that 
six more B-52s made it back but landed as 
wrecks. That is 10 percent of the 200 B-52s sup- i 
posed to be assigned to the Far East theater and 
20 percent of the 100 B52s supposed to have been 
used daily. No definite and final official figures? 
*, have been given. ? 
The loss in pilots was worse. When Johnson 
called off the air war in October 1968, the Penta-
gon said "more than" 450 airmen had been killed, j 
I captured, or were missing since the air war be-
gad in 1961. In 11 days of bombing Nixon lost 
93 airmen, or 20 percent as many in 11 days as 
were lost in the first eight years. 
It would. be most enlightening if a congres-
? sional committee could learn what exactly was 
I gained in strictly military terms for all this ex-
penditure. A Saigon dispatch in the New York , 
: Times, Dec. 31, noted reports that a textile fac-
tory and a noodle factory in 'Hanoi had both been 
heavily bombed in one of the final raids. The 
complaint in the Korean war was that "we were ,

? tons of bombs and rockets on Southeast Asia : 
since we set out to make it safe. for something 
or other on Jan. 1, 1961. This is more than 2 mil-
lion tons greater than all the bombs we dropped ;

In underdeveloped countries like Indochina's,

NOW BOTH SIDES are back at the negotia-
ting table, but there is no sign that either has " 
changed. My guess is that Nixon is more frus-
trated, Hanoi more determined. Nixon has shot 
another bolt. He is unlikely soon again to risk ' 
B-52s over Hanoi, not with conventional weapons 
at least. So far he has bought every military 4 
recipe for victory-by-demolition except wholesale 
destruction of the dikes?and "nukes." How much

` the bombing halt that year by Lyndon Johns'. 
Never was bdrbarity put forward more suav..,3 
ly. Dr. Harold Brown, then Secretary of the Air, 
Force, now the "liberal" member of our SALT 
negotiating team, argued in a memorandum in, 
March 1968, that intensified bombing of the "re-
maining important targets" (already few) around, 
Hanoi and "neutralization of the pert of Haiphong 
by bombing and mining" would "permit bomb-
ing of military targets without the present scru-
pulous concern for collateral civilian damage 'and', 
casualties." And just in case anyone missed the 
point so antiseptically suggested, or thought these 
civilian casualties were merely tangential 'and! 
accidental, Dr. Brown's concluding paragraph on: 
the objective of this exercise began, "'The aims: 
df this alternative' campaign would he to erode', 
the will of the population by exposing a wider, 
area of NVN to casualties and destruction. . . 
"Erode the will"?what stylistic delicacies 
are cultivated by these Pentagon Flauberts. Thisl 
, erosion, plus the destruction of import and Iran-i 
sit facilities, Dr. Brown argued, "would be ex-,, 
' pected to bring NVN to negotiation of a compro- ' 
, muse settlement, or to abandonment of the ROCA 
' in SYN." That's the blueprint Nixon has been fol.. 
, lowing for the last eight months, and in his final 
? fierce spasm of terror%for-Christmas. 
Just What happened to the earlier compro-
mise announced in October nobody, outside of an 
ever smaller circle, knows. Nixon's is becoming, 
?. government-by-soliloquy. In the two weeks before, 
, the Christmas bombing, the visitors' record ati 
the White House showed only three,persons who 
had conferred with Nixon?Kissinger, Kissinier's' 
- aide Haig, and the Republican Senate Majority, 
4 Leader Scott, who later said he had been urging? 
the White House for days to end the bombing. 
Despite the momentous gambles Nixon hasp 
been taking, there has not been a meeting of the) 
, National Security Council since May 8, of the, 
Cabinet since Nov. 8, no press conference at 
." which he allowed questions since Oct. 5. He came 
out of isolation only for the Truman funeral and 
, to see the Redskins coach after their victory, an 
event he seemed to consider earth-shaking. The' 
, free press in the capital of the free world has 
been largely dependent on Hanoi radio and 
Thieu's personal newspaper in Saigon, Tin Song., 
for news of what's going on.

All we know is that on Oct. 26, Kissinger Said' 
"peace is at hand" and that Nixon in a series of' 
pre-election barnstorming speeches in various . 
small towns around the country repeated Mei 
same theme. At Huntington W. Va., Oct. 28, he - 
spoke of "a significant breakthrough" in the' 
peace talks. 
In Ashland, Ky., the same day, he even com-
pared this with the Armistice in 1918. At Saginaw, 
Mich., two days later, he said, "Vietnam being 
over, we are proud of the fact that our trips to 
Peking and to Moscow have paved the way not' 
just for ending this war but for a generation of, 
peace." 
In a nationwide radio broadcast on Nov. 2, hel, 
said the "major breakthrough" would "accern-' 
plish the basic objectives" be set forth last May 
8, when he ordered the mining and bombing.

Even on Dec. 16, the day Kissinger appeared 
to let it be known, though as opaquely as possi-

I rule. 
The only trouble is, of 
course that the presidency 
i has been the dominant force 
In the goverment for close 
p to 200 years now and there 
Isn't very much that Carl 
Albert or anybody else is like-
13'to be able to do about it. 
Nixon may be somewhat 
more secretive than some of 
our presidents in the past 
_ and he doesn't seem to care 
very much about his relations 
with Capitol Dill, but he 
hardly can be accused of in-
venting the idea of an inde-
pendent executive. 
Come to think of it, quite a 
lot of things have happened 
that we weren't much con-
sulted about beforehand. I 
don't recall ;icing asked, for 
instance,,what I thought about 
Invading Normandy, or drop-
ping an atomic bomb on Hir-
oshima, or sending troops to 
Korea, or invading the Bay 
of Pigs. 
It could be that the notion 
that this country normally op-
erates by a system of unre-
stricted information, consulta-
tion and consensus is some-
thing of a myth. Most of our 
recent presidents, at any rate, 
have had a way of acting first 
and consulting afterward in 
matters of primary impor-
tance to the country. 
It may be that Nixon is 
more susceptible to this use 
?or abuse?of presidential 
authority, being at the begin-
ning of his last term and 
therefore less "accountable" 
to the Congress and public 
opinion for what he does. One 
suspects, however, that this 
supposed non-accountability 
Is more impressive to the 
anxious critics of Nixon's 
policies than it is to the 
President himself. 
An y president, including 
this one, is ultimately ac-
countable for everything that 
he does. If his policies fail, 
no amount of prior consulta-
tion and public relations will 
redeem his reputation and 
historical standing. If they 
succeed, it will probably 
intake very little difference 
that the country was largely 
in the dark about what he was 
Up to at the time. 
The people's much-asserted 
"right to know," furthermore, 
has never been fully sub-
scribed to by any government 
that ever existed. What the ? 
people don't know much of,
the time is a lot. And quite 
often there are perfectly valid 
reasons, aside from the nat-
ural furtiveness of chief ex-
ectives, that make it imper-
ative to leave them in igno-
,rance. 
Something of the sort may 
be the case today. What 
everybody is so worked up 
about, of course, are the ne-
gotiations on Vietnam and the 
chances of reaching a settle-
ment of the war in the near 
future. Among other things, 
26 
they want to know whether 
and why it was necessary, to "I 
bomb the hell out of Hanoi 
awl Haiphong at such a high 
cot in lives and public an- ? 
guish. They are asking' what 
or who it was that blocked ? 
the settlement that Kissinger 
said was at ?'hand and what. 
the 
the real prospects are today: 
The questions are pertinent 
and so, perhaps, are the rea-
sons for not answering them. 
The most detailed knowledge 
by the public and the Con-1 
gress. on the state of the ne-i 
gotiations probably would not 
bring a settlement nearer. 
And Indeed, it might foreclose 
the possibility of arriving at I 
any settlement at all. 
It is hard to ask people to I 
live with their frustrations 
and their ignorahce, but for 
the time being it may be nec-
essary. Because the simple 
fact is that Nixon and Kissin-
ger are not negotiating with,., 
the White House press corps1 
or, the Senate Foreign 
Rela-
tions Committee but with the 
North Vietnamese.' 
Everything that has beehr 
said and -left unsaid so far,4 
is a part of that negotiation.,i 
Until it is concluded, the, 
President has the right?and; 
perhaps the duty--to keep the, 
country guessing.

'Bon said. "I don't know ev,

Bon was asked why the, 
houses of Baha have neither 
the pictures of President

areas. 
"We only have enough to

said. "But ? even if Ho had

"I'm riding the back ot

Another who has moved 
to Ninhhoa is Nguyen Tro, 
the deputy hamlet chief of

"I still have those jobs," 
he said, "but I only go to 
Baba from time to time. I 
don't like to let the Viet-

FOREIGN AFFAIR'S 
Nevertheless, certan comparsons' 
must be made. North Vietnam's' offi-
cial statistics of 1,623- persons killed' 
in. the "murder bombing" ow Decem-
ber , compares with Saigon's official 
statistics of 5,800 persons slaughtered, 
principally by .throat-cutting or burtd 
alve, dumg the Commurist occupation, 
of the South Vietnamese city of Hue' 
in February, 1968. 
The second 'point in this Coldly: 
dreadful numbers game is in terms of 
comparison with other bombardments.. 
During World War II, 135,000 deaths 
were caused by Allied bombing .of 
Dresden on Feb. 14 and 16, 1945, and' 
.83,000 in Tokyo on One firebomb raid 
In March, 1945: This does not mention. 
,the ghastly ,results of atomic attacks 
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. " 
' There are certain dismal deductions 
to be made. U.S. raids on North Viet-
-nam obviously avoided use of those 
Incendiary bombs 'which so easily. 
'destroy Asiatic cities like Tokyo?or 
Hanoi., Secondly, ?although the aces'-
mous tonnage dropped by 5-52's 
blatantly exceeded World War H 
loads, they produced' relatively lesser, 
reiults.? They certainly weren't aimed, 
at North Vietnam's vulnerable dikes.; 
These subjects have not been ade-
quately dis'cussed in the angry Western 
press. One .has enormobs distaste for 
quantifying pain. Yet the fact remains 
that, in contrast, with spirited criticism 
published, in democratic organs, the' 
Soviet and Chinese expressions have 
seemed relatively restrained. 
All this having been Said, there isn't 
'the' slightest doubt that the United. 
Stites is edger to end' thin unfortunate 
War,' so tarnishing to its image. It 
seems doomed to the distasteful' choice, 
between' accepting an unhappy come, 
promise?even less palatable than that, 
hoped for before the bombing started-'?, 
or an, even unhappier fallback strategy, ? 
The North Vietnamese have erne 
ployed all kinds of devices such as 
mistranslations of the Wird "mien" Or.. 
"zone" of Vietnam to obfuscate even 
the implication of a South Vietnamese 
authority in Saigon, in order to con-'

: Although the draft quickly 
became known as the nine-
point agreement, U.S. Officials 
say the nine points are simply 
Hanoi's summary of a text 
that contains far more articles. 
They also have remarked that 
the summary is skewed a bit 
to favor Hanoi's views. 
Hardly had the draft been 
completed about the middle of 
October than differences arose 
29 
One has been the so-called 
sovereignty issue, in which the 
two sides are purported to be 
arguing who is sovereign, five policing of the cease-fire 
over what In the South. An-
other is the sanctity of the old 
demilitarized zone along the 
17th Parallel :and whether it 
constitutes a permanent bound-
ary or a temporary demarca-
tion line. 
? Goes blick,to 1954 
These questions raise the 
'Issue that first was posed in 
? 1954, when the French agreed 
? to -leave their colony and di- china and 1,339 missing and, 
vide it temporarily into two finally, the uncciunted thou 
zones, to be reunited two years 
later after elections were held. 
South Vietnamese leaders have 
insisted from: the start that 
their part of the old colony 19 
distinct and independent, while 
Hanoi has insisted that all 
Vietnam is one, eventually .to 
be re-unified. 
If the demilitarized zone 
re-established, Hanoi's ability 
to intervene in the South would, 
be severely limited and to 
maintain its troops for very; 
long impossible, regardless of 
what agreements in principle 
.are reached on these points. ? 
If the line at the 17th Paral-
lel .is temporary, 'all Vietnam 
is an entity, artificially 
sundered. If the line is a per-
manent political boundary, all 
Vietnam is divided in two 
parts for as long as one can 
foresee. 
? , Other issues 
Other issues have been iden-
tified as troublesome points, 
but each loomed less large 
,than the dispute over Vietnam' 
as a polity. One is the nature 
of the National Council of Rea 
onciliation ahd Concord, wIileh 
' Mr. Thleu feared would be-
come the coalition government 
that he has vowed he will not 
accept. 
Will the couheil make politi-
cal decisions, or will it simply 
be an administrative organ? 
Will councils be set up at local 
levels; giving the Viet Cong 
political footholds in areas that 
they do oot now control? What 
freedom to move around in 
government-controlled territory 
will the Viet ,Cong 'officials 
have? ?? 
? Another stumbling block, aci 
cording to Dr. Kissinger, was 
the size of the truce supervi-
sory force that will be provi-
ded by four nations?Canada, 
Indonesia, Hungary and Pa 
land. The United States wanted 
5,000 men with' their own 
means of traveling throughout 
the country ? to investigate 
truce violations. Hanoi report-
edly wanted only 250 men with 
no independent facilities. Ob-
viously the 'real issue ?was 
whether there would be effec-
or a bobtailed operation that 
would be unable to cope with 
widespread violations.

gambit to counter Saigon's de-

over the neglect of their 
cadres in the October deal. 
Finally, there *as another 
calculated ambiguity? about the 
fates of laoll and Cambodia. 
While each .presents special 
problems, essentially they are 
side issues in the Vietnam con-
flict. The October draft did not 
prcrvide, as far as is publicly 
known, for a, cease-fire in 
those two countries. All that 
was required was the with-
drawal of foreign troops and 
neutralisation of their territory 
from outside interference. '? 
Ilawever,, Mr. Nixon said in 
late October that a cease-fire 
must be effective throughout 
/Indochina, which would include 
Hanoi's indigenous allies in 
Laos and Cambodia. Both 
could continue fighting for a 
while if deprived of outside 
support, but not indefinitely.

be one of an eventual ceage.

truce simultaneous with f.hii

Secretary Laird and th,e ,tar-News Are Right 
Not a week has gone by since the President had a 
Minion lash Congresa for daring to suggest that the 
ttline to get out of the Vietnam war is now. And yet 
1Melvin R. Laird, who, has been Mr. Nixon's own Defense 
; Secretary the last four ytars, reports that the success of 
'?,"Vietnamization" makes possible "today . . the corn-
. plete termination of American involvement in the war!! 
;.Like those in Congress 'supporting a war-fund cutoff, 
Mr. Laird adds only one condition: the safe return of 
;American prisoners of war .and 'an accounting of the 
missing. 
Listening to Mr. Laird, House Armed Services chair-
man F. Edward Hebert, entirely an administration loyal. 
'1st on the war, replied, "we have got to get that honor-
..able peace." And what is that? "The hbnorable peace," 
Chairman Hebert explained, "depends solely on the re-
turn of those POWs and an account of the missing and I 
' think you share that opinion." 
, "I do," answered Mr. Laird. 
? , We have not heard the White House lash Mr. Laird 
or .Mr. Hebert for undercutting the Paris talks by their 
suggestion that, -as the Secretary put it, the United States 
,has done "the 'most any 'ally could reasonably expect, 
for no nation can provide to another the will and deter-
mination to survive." Nor do we expect to. (Mr. Laird's 
? prepared remarks on Vietnam are excerpted elsewhere on 
this page.) 
Look elsewhere, at, for instance, -newspapers which 
'have been sympathetic to Mr. Nixon on the war. Last 
. Friday, the Wall Street Journal said that "the one thing 
,the Americans ought to insist on" at Paris Is ""bare 
minimum of good faith in Hanoi . . . In blunt terms, 
the barest minimum of good faith means first .we .get 
. the prisoners back, then, if they (Hanoi] like, they have 
their offensive . . . By now the United States has done 
everything that could reasonably be expected of an ally; 
Saigon does not in fact survive the fault .clearly will 
be, its own." 
On Sunday the Washington Star-News declared: "we, 
.'would urge that, if an acceptable and honorable political 
iiettlement appears impossible, both parties tat Paris] 
'aibandon the search and secure what is in. their power 
, 
to achieve: the end,. now and forever, of U.S. air and, 
naval attacks against North Vietnam and the withdrawal, 
of the remaining U.S. forces in South Vietnam in return'il 
for repatriation of the American prisoners Of wars' 
Is not the point clear that it is not simply policy critics 
or political rivals,of the President, but friends and sup-, 
porters who are urging on him a course he apparently; 
resists. Consider the list: the Secretary of Defense, the 
chairman of the 'House Armed Services CoMmittee, the, 
Wall Street Journal, the Washington Star-NeWs? These 
are not parties which can be easily accused of being 
"Irresponsible," the designation put on Congressional 
Democrats last Sunday by the President's communical 
tions director, Herbert Klein. (That by his uncommuni-
cativeness, Mr. Nixon has earned italics for that title, 
appears incontestable. Last Saturday, for instance, an!.4 
other editorially friendly newspaper, the Chicago, 
Tribune, said: "The situation cries for candor on thel 
part of the President, and for explanations which have' 
been lacking.") 
Mr. Klein went on to 'claim that the President's 61 
per cent victory in the November elections had given 
him "a -very clear mandate to proceed the way he has 
on Vietnam." It is a claim so flimsy and specious we ' 
question whether Mr. Nixon would dare make it for, 
I 
himself, should he deign to appear in public. For a good 
deal more than a judgment on Mr. Nixon's Vietnam, 
policy went into that 61 per cent. In so far as such al 
judgment did enter in; the vote was in our view a man.; 
date for the "peace" which the electorate has just been t 
assured was "at hand." It was not a mandate to level' 
downtown Hanoi, or to continue putting American blood 
treasure and, yes, honor at risk to a questionable politi-
cal outcome in Saigon. Certainly it was not a mandate for 
Mr. Nixon to heed 'again, as he evidently did last month," 
the pleas of the wily President Thieu and let go of the'l 
agreement that his and Hanoi's negotiators had put within 
his reach. 
Mr. Nixon said last year that the war is no longer an 
Issue among the American people. He Is right: they all' 
want out. For ourselves, we'll stand with Secretary Laird, 
and the Star-News and, this time around, we fervently' 
hope Mr. Nixon will too.

city: Other reports from Hanoi' since then put the total 
at between 1,300 and 1,600 in the whole' fortnight of

is not something that can be shunted out of the mind 
with the argument that worse things happen in war. But 
it is worth remembering that the German air force killed 
? almost as many in a single night in what now seems to 
,be the relatively mild bombing of Britain in 1940 and 
1941. The British themselves killed 20 and, 40 
times as many in a single night's firestorm bombing of 
. Hamburg and Dresden and other German cities. As 
'it happens, the Hanoi death roll is smaller than the 
number of civilians killed by the North Vietnamese in 
their artillery bombardment of An Loc in April, or the 
toll of refugees ambushed when trying to escape from 
Quang Tri at the beginning of May. That is-what makes 
the denunciations of Mr Nixon as another Hitler sound

Vietnam ha a become one man's war. 
Whether it is his crusade to prove 
that he, personally, cannot be "pushed 
." around," or that our inevitable even-
tual departure is "honorable" does 
not matter. What matters, aside from 
the supreme consideration , of the 
human losses' and suffering caused, is 
that the President used the period of 
Congressional adjournment and pre-
, occupation with the holiday season to 
' intensify the war far above any pre-
11' vious level. 
He has been able to do this without 
the encumbrance of Congressional 
' advice; he did not need to consult 
, anyone outside of his own staff and 
!: of the military. 
The malaise begun during World 
War II with the belief that politics 
Should end at the water's edge, the 
concept of bipartisanship in foreign 
policy, has now reached its fever point 
In the absolute power Of the President 
to make total war. All the requisite 
powers to do so were delegated long 
ago. Now politics is not even involved: 
neither party shares in the responsi-
bility of. this purely Presidential deci, 
Sion. 
,In four years in office, Mr. Nixon 
has shown a persistent taste for per-
sonal diplomacy. Summit meetings 
with the heaciS of the Communist 
hierarchies in Peking and Moscow are 
a central ingredient in his style and 
sign of an overwhelming confidence 
in his personal abilities and influence. 
The Constitution assigns to the Presi-
dent predominance in the direction 
and conduct of foreign policy and they 
necessarily reflect his temperament 
, and character as well as his view of 
' our national interest. This is probably 
; no more true of Mr. Nixon than of 
either of his immediate predecessors 
although he seems to have made fuller 
use of his prerogatives for personal 
initiative in the context of foreign 
policy that did Mr. Johnson, and at 
least as much as did Mr. Kennedy. 
Control over foreign policy has been 
concentrated in the White House p. 
an extent probably unprecedented in 
this century except during the Presi-
dency of John Kennedy and the war-
tittle days of Franklin Roosevelt. Only 
a few members of Mr. Nixon's official 
family appear in a position of full 
Presidential confidence. It would be 
hard to imagine the Nixon Cabinet as 
a' forum fot a general discussion or 
deliberation of the major Nixon initia-
tives relating to Vietnam: the "incur-
sions" into Laos and Cambbdia (decided 
upon in the Rose Garden of the White 
HOuse), the mining of North Vietnam-
ese waters (announced dramatically 
by the President On TV), and the 
bombing. 
Mr. Nixon seems far too conscious 
of his vast prerogatives and too 
confident of his ability to discharge 
them, to share them. He has taken 
literally Truman's dictum that the 
Oval Rooth -of the White House is 
where the buck stops. Far from evad-
ing responsibility, he seems to enjoy 
It and to glory in his reputation as a 
man of tough fiber, a man who cannot 
be pushed around, an unpredictable 
man. And that is where the ultimate 
? 
danger rests: in the conflict between 
restraint and unpredictability. 
As a matter of constitutional princi-
ple, the management of foreign policy, 
while largely a Presidential preroga, 
jive, should at every point involve the 
express or tacit approval of Congress 
and the support of public opinion. 
the conference table in Paris, evidently 
decided to bomb North Vietnam into 
submission, he timed his decision 
shrewdly: with Congress adjourned, 
he could not be hampered by possible 
Congressional reaction. His decision to 
send Henry Kissinger back to Paris 
and stop his awesome bombing cam-
paign neatly undercut incipient moves 
to legislate an end to the war. Although 
, ? it is hard, after thesq many years and 
the broad powerg'slready'delegated to 
' the President by Congress in this con... 
filet, to believe that Congress might 
take some definitive action now to end 
this war, that possibility is far more 
' real today than before. U.S. military 
activity in Vietnam no longer involves 
ground troops, and the argument that 
we should not cut off support of 
American troops in the field conse-
quently holds much less meaning. 
If legislative restrictions seem no 
threat to the President's initiative in 
- undertaking whatever military meas-
ures he wants in Vietnam, neither do 
the normal requirements of practical 
politics. Of course, neither Mr. Nixon ; 
nor his two predecessors have felt ; 
obliged in the course of this conflict 
to keep domestic reaction to our Viet-
namese policy constantly in view. The 
American people have never shared in , 
r the decisions that committed our na-
tion to war in Vietnam. To the con-
trary, it seems far more reasonable , 
to assume that the majority of those 3. 
who voted for Mr. Nixon last Nov. 7 
voted as much to end the war as did r. 
those who voted against him. 13ut it 
is now January and Mr. Nixon IS his 
own man, and he cannot be held to ; 
account for quite some time. In the 
meantime, the bombing halt will con-
tinue, or it will be resumed, as Mr. ; 
Nixon alone determines.

I This latest and most severe 
strain in diplomatic relatidns 
between Washington and Stock-
holm, long at odds over the 
war, developed quickly after 
the resumption of Americari 
bombing of the Hanoi and 
Haiphong areas, with 'the col. 
;lapse of peace talks Nat month, 
The reaction of the Swedes, 
among the most vocal and ac' 
'five opponents of the war 
the West, was one of revulsion 
land shock. 
Sheeked by Hospital Damage 
L Their anger intensified short-
ly, before Christmas, with the 
news of the damage to a hos. 
pltfil in Hanoi that had been 
partly equipped by Sweden. And 
that night, after 9P.M., with his 
sons in ?bed upstairs, Premier 
Olof Palme sat down at the 
Aitchen table and wrote out it 
'Statement that linked the 
Arnerictin 'bombing , of Wirth, 
Vietnam with Nazi massacres 
in World War II. He set it 
snide, reread it In the morning,' 
consulted n few aSsociates?but 
not his Foreign Ministry?and 
then issued it to the press. The 
result was a violent reaction 
from Washington and a sharp 
'diplomatic slap, ' ?? 
President Nixon heard of 
,Mr. Palme's words just after 
they moved on news agency 
;wires .on Dec. 23 and ordered 
diplomatic retaliation. The 
Swedes were Add that .their 
new Ambassador, 'irneve Mtg. 
,ler, would not be welcome for 
the present and that the 
American charge d' Wakes, 
John C. Guthrie, would not be 
returning to Stockholm. 
'Not en Instant Reaction' 
Premier Palme reflected' on 
the crisis in an interview in his 
office as he smoked his favorite 
American cigarettes. "It was 
not an instant reaction." he 
!mid. "It was building up inside 
Of me' since the bombing re-
sumed. We had many discus-
dons on it over a period of five 
days or so. And then, that even-
ng, I knew what I had to say 
about it.. 
"I don't regret It because In 
this world you have to speak 
out fairly loud to make anyone 
listen. I can't keep . site% 
? 
this issue and won't be pres-
turized into silence. ? ? 
' "I would prefer if the United 
States 'would recognize the 
fact that one can have a deep-
seated difference of .'opinion 
with Washington that balls for 
arguments'. rather than diplo-
matic rebuffs. They., serve no 
useful purpose. 1 ? , 
Mr.. Palme, who has not been 
a favorite politician in Wash-
ington's eyes since he walked 
with the North Vietnamese 
envoy in an antiwar , demon-
stration here five years ago, 
sought to remove some of the 
sting from his controversial 
statement, which called the 
bombing a "form of torture" 
reminiscent of atrocities corri-
mated at Katyn, Lidice and 
Treblinka. _ 
, He said that the fist repre-
sented "symbols of meaningless 
human suffering and violence" 
and did not intend to imply 
"literal comparison" between 
the, bombing and thhse past 
events ? and the politicians re. 
sponsible. ? . 
The 45-year-old Premier, who 
traveled widely in the ' United 
States as a student and attend-
ed Kenyon College in Ohio, 
insisted in his excellent English 
that Sweden was not anti-
American but anti-Vietnam War. 
? In his view, close and friendly 
ties Would be resumed once the 
war, was over because Sweden 
was "probably the most pro-
American country in Europe." 
,Many Swedes, stopped on the' 
Streets or in casual ..convers,a4 
tion in bars 'and shops, Make 
the same point. They 'talk of 
three million. Swedes who emi-
treted to America, of the sim-
ilarity in life-styles, and of the 
hetivy . injection of American 
ft ulture ,into filieS, 'television,' 
Musid'and other areas., ? ? ' 
1 But they are strong Appo-
stenta, of the American role in 
Indochina, with the depth ,of 
'feeling depending largely,. on 
their age. The young here are 
1 'active and vociferous, raise 
Money for the "liberation 
front" in South Vietnam and 
applaud Mr. Palme'S positions. 
'Many in the older generation 
are more reserved, largely be-
cause of their memories. " 
- "I think Palme was toe 
strong, although 1 am- against 
'the war," said Lars Hansson, 
a 59-year-old who was strolling 
'along the banks of one of the 
many fingers of the Baltic Sea. 
"I don't think we should be so 
tough of the United ?States. I 
remember what it did during 
the Second World War, what it 
did for Europe afterwards. It's 
a good country." 
Several Opposition politicians 
took the view that Mr. Palme 
had gone too far in the refer-
ence to Nazi atrocities, and his 
Foreign Ministry . probably 
agrees. But they- also feel. as 
does Mr. Palme, that the Amer-
ican Jeaction -tb his criticisms 
Went too far, as well. 
All Parties Oppose Bombing 
There, is. however, a gener-
ally unified. position on Viet-
nam within the politic!' parties. 
All five parties from, the C,Ori-
oAtillio1414@1 P 2ovrtlft% 
agreed to support the petition 
,now circulating, calling on the 
United States to stop all bomb-
ing in Vietnam and on "all par-
ties" in the conflict to sign a 
peace agreement. Mr. Palme 
hopes that two million of Swed-
en's eight million people will 
? 
sign the petition. 
? One result of the present dis-
pute has been to .strengthen 
Mr. Palme's political position. 
His Social Democratic party, in 
power for 40 years, is in some 
trouble now because of infla.' 
tion, ,running at up to 7 per 
cent a year?coupled with vir-
tual economic stagnation, with 
a growth rate last year:of 
about 2 per cent,' one of the 
lowest IC Europe. 
The polls show that an dee-
'tion today?it is scheduled for 
iSeptember?would oust the So. 
,cial Democrats. Mr. Palme 
needs all the- support he can 
muster, and as a long-standing 
critic' of United 'States war 
policy, he clearly reflects what 
Most Swedes !ed.., , ? 
U.S. Helps Palme 
"Most of us did feel that the 
bombing was an outrage," said 
,Lars Eric Thunholm, president' 
'of the Scandinavian Private 
Bank, One of the largest in 
Europe. "Many also think that 
Pelmets wording was too strong 
in protest. But the United 
States helps him by taking such 
actions in return. He receives 
sympathy from people "who 
might not give it otherwise. 
The United States should have 
done nothing in response." 
"The fact that the bombing 
has stopped around Hanoi, and 
that talks are about to resume 
has little bearing," said Gunnar 
Helen, the head ,of the Opposi-
Mon Liberal party, as' he sat in 
,the futuristic new Parliament: 
building. "Hundreds have: 
changed their position from' tt 
'sort of balanced silence to a' 
'Clear outcry against the bomb-
ing. And 'that includes many o 
'the older 'people who are now 
'divorcing their memories of 
postssar America from whati 
going on now.". ? , 
' ; 
A History of Tension ? 
The recent' history of diplo-
matic relations between Wash-
ington and Stockholf has fre-
quently been marked by ,ten-
sion. Sweden was the first 
Western country to give full 
diplomatic recognition to North 
Vietnam. She has' granted 
asylum to more than 400 Amer-
ican deserters and has repeat-
edly attacked United States 
war policy in a spirit that 
Washington often regarded 
as one-sided for a nation' that, 
has professed neutrality for 150 
years. ? 
Moreover, Stockholm has 
sent large-scale relief and aid 
to North Vietnam. It does not 
do the same for South Vietnam, 
nor does it have a diplomat in 
Saigon. 'We technically recog-
nize the Saigon regime as long 
as it is in power,' Mr. Palme 
said. "But It would not be ac-
ceptable to public opinion to' 
have an ambassador there. We 
never had one and it's too late 
7 : CIA-RDP77-00432R0??1 
r 
now." 
The repeated attacks on 
United States' war policy by 
Mr. ?Paltne hardly surprised, 
Washington in recent months,, 
and it probably would not have 
reacted so severely had the 
Premier not implied a compari-
son between', Mr, Nixon and 
Hitler. In 1968, after Mr. Palme. 
?then a Cabinet Minister?ape 
peered at the antiwar rally with 
the, North Vietnamese envoy,' 
President. Johnson called home, 
William Heath, then the Amer. 
lean Ambassadot. The post was 
not filled for a year, although' 
Sweden maintained her envoy 
In Washington. 
' Tension began building again1 
as the, war continued tied the 
statements tly Swedish officialt 
alspeared... to . grow stronger.' 
Washington was particularly, 
angered by a speech made' in: 
May' 'by the Minister for, Edu-
?tation, Ingvar Carlsson, who 
appeared at a demonstration. 
,sponsored by, the active nem-. 
:tion-front group here and the 
Swedish 'Committee, on Vieti 
,nam. ? .. 
"The war is not the only 
example, although the most 
brutal . one, of the American 
craving to dominate otherl 
countries,",' he said before it! 
'crowd.. of 5,000: "The samd 
feature, economic and techtio.', 
logical ,supremacy?which easi 
ily turns to unmasked physical 
violence?.-is' evidenced also; 
within the American commun., 
ity in the relations between dif 
ferent groups' of people." 
As read by American offi-
ciaTt, the tpeech went clearly 
beyond an antiwar speech and 
represented strident anti-Amer-
ican sentiments. Mr. Palme has 
denied that was the intention, 
but Washington remains un-
convinced. 
Moreover, there is unhappi.

Americans' Leiters to Palme 
Support S 
By ROBERT SKOLE 
Special to The Star?News 
STOCKHOLM ? Americana 
are giving Sweden's Prime' 
Minister Olof Palme his 
staunchest support in his criti-' 
cism of the United States: 
bombing of North Vietnam. 
"I've never received so, 
'much mail from abroad 
particularly' from the United 
States ? and letters are over-
whelmingly positive to the ' 
stand we have taken," says ; 
Palme. 
,To find out just what kind of' 
snail he was getting, I,went to . 
Government House, and there 
looked through the Incoming 
letters. In Sweden, this can be, 
done: - all mail sent to a public 
office, once it has been "regis-
tered" as having been re-. 
celved, becomes a public docu-
ment. And public documents . 
are readily available to the 
press. 
' Palme describes the mail he4, 
Ins been receiving, comment-
ing on his sharp criticism. of 
the Christmas bombings of, 
, Hanoi and Haiphon g, 
"deeply personal and emotion-

out. 
Indeed, many of the lettersI 
made Palme's now well-known 
speech ? comparing the Hanoi 
!Christmas bombings to "deeds 
of, horror" of World War Two 
? appear mild. For ,,many 
,years, Palme has said that He 
and other Swedish opponents 
to the U.S. war in Indochina 
have gotten their main argu-
ments from American 'oppo-, 
nents to the war. He says that 
his first speeches attacking 
the American war in Vietnam, 
? delivered in the mid-1960's, 
, were largely based on argu-
ments used by Sen.' William 
Fulbright. 
. Today, Palme need, simply

Behind the- Rift With Sweden 
The current diplomatic rift between the United States 
and Sweden is disturbing in itself and even more disturb-
lag in what it portends for the leadership role which 
Mr. Nixon would have this country take after , the war. 
"Mr, Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister, has a long record 
of vigorous open opposition to American policy in Viet-
nam. To protest one of his gestures, Mr. Nixon did not 
replace the American ambassador who retired from 
iStockholm last summer. In response ,to Mr. Palme's latest 
outburst, an extravagant statement placing the Christmas 
bombing of Hanoi among the century's worst "atrocities," 
the President responded even more sharply. There is no 
:record that he attempted to explain to the Swedes the 
purpose of the latest bombing, any more than he has to 
'Americans. But he did tell Sweden not to replace its 
retiring ambassador. "We aught as well face it," a State 
Department official thoroughly caught up in the Nixon 
spirit told Newsweek. "We are dealing here with an 
Unfriendly country." 
, This is, of course, nonsense. That an American diplo-
mat could apparently believe it suggests just how far 
the Nixon administration has gotten out of touch with 
the rest of the world. For Sweden, is anything but an 
unfriendly country. It is, in the natural scheme of things, 
a close friend sharing the deepest associations and values 
with the United States. It is also, obviously, a country 
whose leader, along with 'a substantial portion of its 
citizenry, happens to disagree with a particular American 
policy. But the way to cope with a friend's disagreement 
Is, at the least, to get in closer touch, to try to explain, 
not to react in pique and close off the symbolic channel 
of communication between nations, the'exchange of am-
bassadors. Passing off political disagreement as an ex-
pression of calculated hostility is simply wrong-headed. 
Here we introduce a point so obvious as to be almost 
embarrassing to hive to make. It was not Olof Palme's 
words that shot almost a score of B-52s out of the skies 
of North Vietnam during the December raids: it was 
I ' 
tralism per se with comrriunism,'1 
:this inians that s great many 
people whose sentiments are 
tral, or who have spoken in favor ); 
of neutralism for Vietnam, are con-
fined In prison, along with others 
.merely ..inspected, by. someone, of ..; 
'harboring such sentiments.

missiles supplied to Hanoi by the Soviet Union. The 
two million 'signattires Mr. Palme is trying to rally for ' 
an end-the-bombing petition are not killing South Viet-
namese: the bullets sent to the Vietcong by the Peoples 
Republic of China are. Yet Mr. Nixon keeps his ambassa.,! 
dor in Mescow, and Moscow's envoy stays in Washingtonl 
As with the Russians, he contin6es efforts to 'broaden! 
ties with the Chinese. How can the President countenance? 
this measure' of illogic in his policy? , 
The Swedish attitude?which is, let it be noted, shared, 
In some more or less considerable degree by practically; 
? 
eVery friend the 'United States has?expresses essentially; 
we think, the bafflement with- which so many people' 
everywhere view the extended and continuing America& 
,involvement in Vietnam. The attitude may not arise so, 
much out of compassion for the Vietnamese, or hostility, 
` to Americans, as out of cold self-interest. Mr. Nixon 
would like the American stand in Vietnam to be seen' . 
by friend and foe as a testament' to the United States': 
,devotion to an ally and to its dedication to the principle 
of national self-determination. But many people in many 
lands see the American stand as evidence that the, United 
States has lost its balance and undermined its own pen.: 
chant and capacity for a leading world role. Many4 
foreigners?not all, to be sure?look at the United States. 
and see a nation harshly divided within itself, one whose; 
will and readiness to make good on other international 
commitments have been put in shadow by its costly and 
disproportionate involvement in Vietnam: From the view-
point of their own self-interest, they must necessarilyi 
wonder if and how the United States has been changed' 
by the war, and whether it is wise to count on the United', 
States in years ahead. 
This is to us the real issue involved in President'l 
Nixon's reaction to Olof Palme. We cannot conceive how, ? 
It is to the President's or the country's advantage for 
.him to pursue his particular line of response.

SATGON?While. Wash-

port for the war, another 
prospect that Congress 
will end or reduce eco-

pam--is deeply worrying 
allied officials here. 
The economic. situation 
In SOuth Vietnam is al-

fiscal 1074 must be In-
creased substantially If 
South Vietnam is to avoid 
severe dislocations. if*U.f;l4 
aid continues at the pre-
sent rate, a high-ranking. 
American economist said, 
"that would be short of to-
tal disaster but close to it." 
The reason for immedi-
ate concern about econom-
ic aid is that Congress 
must make a decision on it. 
within two months, since 
the present allocation ex-. 
piree Feb. 'A Officials 
fear that cong,resamen will 
be facing the issue at a 
time when their mood 
Seems untisually antiwar, 
and when the South Viet-
ameat economy is feeling 
the impact of Atneritain 
military withdrawals.

withholding economic aid 
they could probably 
achieve a similar result. 
While President Nixon 
can veto any bill passed 
by Corigree, he cannot au-
thorize funds net allocated 
by Congress. 
The officials are prepar-
ing for the visit to Saigon

The officials %vitt explain

In economic aid for fiscal

more than South Vietnam 
will recek e this year if the 
present. aid resolution. is 
extended three months to 
cover fiscal 1.97:. 
It is po4sible that. offi-
cials are overstating the 
gravity of the economic si-
tuation here to coax more 
aid out of Congress..ritit if 
that is so. they would be 
flying in the face of the 
iinofficial policy of opti-
mism which has long dom-
inated America it pro-
nouncementa on S o u t.h 
Vietnam. 
In addition. the facts cit-
ed by the officials seem. 
con% hiding. 
Withdrawal Blues . 
T h e bigeest problem 
now facing the South Viet-
pamese economy is how to 
make up for the departure 
of American troops, who 
with civilians spent from 
,00 million to .0f1 
mil-
lion each year from IffiG to 
1971. The influx of this, 
money into the economy 
enabled the South Viet-
naniese government to fi-
nance an equivalent 
amount of vital imports. 
But in 1972 the 14ntre 
fell to million. and in 
197: ii is expected to fall 
Idelow MOO million. Thus 
the government of Viet-
nam must quickly find a 
new source or income to 
conlinne importing at the 
same level. 
36 
. One method would be to 
enlarge exports. In fart. 
South Vitnamese exports 
doubled in 1.97:.! despite 
the Communist offensivp. 
but the amount ($24 mil-
lion) le still insignificant 
('nm pared in Import e ($7:1 
million). Economists are 
hoping that within four 
years 'exports will reach 
$100 million, but even that 
figure would still be 
dwarfed by imports. 
T.11 C other al) vious 
source of funds is Ameri-
can economic aid. Of the 
$340 million figure for fis-
cal 1073, $60 million is for 
,programs administered by 
the Agency for Interna-
tional Development and 
fcitS0 million is for some-
thing called the Commodi-
ty Import Progrbm. 
? Under the CIF, the U.S. 
government pays Ameri-
can exporters to send pro-
ducts to South Vietnam. 
But because of inflation 
the same allocation buys 
fewer and fewer American 
products each year, 
Inflation Aspect. ? 
In, the last two years 
prices of products %sent to 
Vietnam under the CII' in-
creased 15'.; /a year. Offi-
,eials estimate ? that infla-
tion of these products will 
drop to in 1073. but 
that still means that a 
Increase in CII' funils 
would he required simply 
to buy the same quantity 
of goods. 
To avoid inflation-ridden 
American prOdUlai, offi-
cials here would like to 
have more aid funds., With 
no strings attached. One 
American economist said 
he hope.d that 8100 million 
in mxt year's aid package 
wont(' not he tied to pur-
chiises of American pro-
Olivia. Needless, to say, 
such a measure would not 
be popular in Congress, 
since the aid than could 
not be justified for its hut-
ireszing effect on the U.S. 
economy. ? 
? The only other alterna-
tive for South Vietnam is 
to cut its imports. Ameri-
can economists say that at, 
most$lOQmjj1jonin 
nonessential imports - 
'could( be cut. A large per-
centage of imports consists 
of such necessities as fad- . 
lizer and petroleum, the. 
absence ? or which would ? 
have an immediate ad-, 
verse impact on the econo-
my. 
In addit ion. banning , 
products might only in-
duce smuggling, a prob-
kin which recently has 
been declining in signifi-
Vance. 
'South Vietnamese peo-
ple are already suffering 
economic woes. According ' 
to one economist, real per-
sonal income dropped 10!.; . 
in 1972, as both unemploy-
ment and i inflation in-
et;ased. Unemployment in 
I? 
the Saigon area is above 
? Exchange  Rate 
In addition, sins ? of the 
economy's instability are 
rtnppearing. For example, 
the black market piaster 
exchange rate, which sev-
eral months ago dropped 
below the official rate. 
(now 463 piasters per dol-
lar). has jumped back to 
about 10c,i, above the offi-
cial rate. In Hong Kong 
where speculation is more 
Intense, one U.S. dollar 
buys more than COO piast-
ers. 
Asked what would hap-
peri'bif U.S: economic aid 
continued at the same, 
rate, one American officai 
said: 
. "You'll have a stagnant ? 
economy with a lot of un-
'happy people in it. Prices 
will go up sharply, invest-
ment will be very small, 
real wages in the govern-
ment sector' will decline ? 
and you'll have a harder 
time managing the econo-
my. Problems that we've 
already solved will reap-
pear." 
"If imports fell front $700 
million to S300 or $400 
million, you'd have a grad-
ual decline in output and 
an increase in unemploy-
ment, emoted with a huge 
increaie in inflation," an-
other official said. 'With a 
war going on, it's hard to 
see any government sm.-
%lying under those condi-
: lions." 
? Asked to assess the eco-
nomie situation if aid tvere 
eliminated entirely, the Of-
ficial said, "Some filings 
arc too horrible to think 
about. We're still planning . 
on getting the aid because:

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
13 January 1973 
Pentagon ban 
,on Viet news 
tit's press 
By Dana Adams Schmidt 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Washington. 
By explicitly declaring a "lid" on informa-' 
lion on the bombing or non-bombing of North 
Vietnam and the Paris peace talks, the 
'Pentagon has raised some basic issues about 
freedom of speech and the public's "right to 
know." 
The matter came to light Jan. 5 when 
,Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, during an 
awards ceremony, volpteered the informa-
tion that "those negotiations are so important 
that we are not going to be placed An the 
' position where information from this building 
could in any way be blamed for the lick of 
v success on the negotiating track." 
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim' 
documented this policy on Jan. 9 by dis-
closing a directive he had issued on Dec. 30, 
the day President Nixon ordered the end of 
bombing 'of the Hanoi-Haiphong area of North, 
, Vietnam and the 'resumption of the Paris 
'peace talks. , 
The directive, which some correspondents 
believe originated in the White House, was 
`angry in tone. It ordered that "there must be 
'no, repeat no, comment of any sorts from any , 
?Department of Defense personnel, civilian , 
and military, or whatever rank" concerning' 
"the resumption of peace negotiations and a' 
Suspension of some military activities in 
:Southeast Asia." 
"Thera is to be no comment, nor' 
t. speculation, no elaboration and no dis-
? cussion on the subjects involved in the 
White House announcement," the direc-
tive said. 
It went on to direct all inquiries to the 
:Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Public Affairs. 
, The directive was made public as 
result of inquiries by Aryeh Neter, execu-
tive director of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, who Wrote that he had 
received complaints about it from De-
fense Department employees. 
Mr. Neier's letter said that "if the 
Department wishes to limit' office' 'pro-
nouncements to authorized spokesmen 
that is certainly appropriate, but there, 
can be no possible justification for sus-
pending the civil liberties of millions Of - 
citizens who are employed by'the Depart., 
ment of Defense." , 
The Neier letter elicited an answer)1 
from J. Fred Buzhardt, the department'S 
chief legal counsel, who effusively, 
thanked the ACLU official for recogniz-
ing the proper role of offical spokesmen, t 
He said the department fully recognizes. 
individual rights under the 1st Amend-
ment "and obviously the public affairal 
guidance message did not apply tti; 
4 
unofficial expression of personal views. , 
Mr. Buzhardt asserted that similar; 
restrictions had been imposed at the time 
of the SALT I and the beginning of thei 
SALT II negotiations, and previously, 
during Middle East negotiations. 
To this Mr. Neter replied whet, reached, 
by telephone that he would like to 1.?,,e the' 
department's recognition of 1st t. mend-1 
ment rights disseminated to all rm.Otary, 
commands in the same way as the, 
original ban. on comment, ppeculativz, 
elaboration and discussion. 
, While this was going on Admiral Isaac 
A. Kidd and Gordon W. Rule, former 
Navy irrocurernent official, were appear-, 
? ing before a Senate committee headed by! 
Sena. William Proxmire. The admiral" 
'angered Senator Proxmirety refusing to 
testify about the reasons why he had), 
',demoted Mr. Rule following his clticism 
of President Nixon's appointment c Roy 
L. Ash of Litton Industries as head of the, 
,Office of Management and Budget. 
Fulbright rebuffed

sional scene, Secretary of State William 
P. Rogers and presidential adviser. 
Henry Kissinger, acting under White 
House orders, had declined a summons' 
from Sen. W. Fulbright, chairman of the" 
'Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to' 
explain policiis related to North Viet-
nam. Mr. Kiissinger also begged off from, 
a commitment to brief Republican mem-,! 
,bers of the House. 
Finally Herbert G. Klein, liead of the, 
White House Communications .Office, 
? ,Jan. 7 got after critics of the admirds.: 
tration in Congress. "Some of the more

thread running through these devel-, 
opments, whether they apply to journal-
ists, Congress, or the bureaucracy.

Military Doubts Firm Peace 
By ORR KELLY -* 
Star?News Steil Writer 
Peace now seems to be "at 
hand" in Vietnam, but Penta-
gon officials are ftankly pes-
imistic that it will prove to be 
a broad or lasting peace. 
They expect an agreement 
in the near future that will 
,provide for the return of all 
'American prisoners of war 
and an accounting of those 
'missing in action, withdrawal 
of American military 'forces 
from Vietnam within 60 days 
following the signing and a 
cease-fire. ? 
But, despite the cease-fire, 
they do not expect the South 
Vietnamese and the North VI-
, etnamese to stop shooting at 
'each other for long and they 
ido not expect the contest for 
icontrol of the southern portion 
of the country to end. 
This generally pessimistic 
iassessment of the chances for 
?Iasting peace in Indochina is 
(given by officials who say they 
!are not fully familiar with the 
terms of agreement now under 
consideration. But there is ev-
ery reason to believe that top 
1Pentagon officials fully famil-
iar with the proposed agree-
ment also share this view. 
Laird's Earlier Goal 
Throughout the first Nixon 
administration, the emphasis 
at the Pentagon has been on 
the Vietnarnization "track" as 
an alternative to the negotiat-
ing "track". Defense Secre-
tary Melvin R. Laird, In con- ? 
gr e salon al testimony last 
week, emphasized that the 
Vietnamization program had 
been successfully completed 
and that the United States 
could "terminate" its involve-
ment in the war if the prison-
ers were returned. 
Last night, during an 
awards ceremony at the Pen-
tagon, Laird refused to specu- ? 
late, on whether be would 
reach his goal, set several 
years ago. At that time he said 
he would consider he had been 
successful as defense secre-
tary if, when he left the office, 
no American serviceman was 
shooting at any one or being 
shot at anywhere in the world. 
He expects to leave office at. 
noon on Saturday. 
Despite his refusal to com-
ment on the negotiations, he 
emphasized that the number 
of Americans in South Viet-
nam -is still declining ? and is 
now well below the number in 
Korea, nearly two decades aft-
er the end of the Korean War. 
Pentagon officials feel the 
President's decision to halt all 
mit and naval attacks on North 
Vietnam Involves little mill. 
-tory risk. 
"This Is obviously not going, 
to ? g.o on very long," one offi-
cial sari. "Either there is 
going to be a deal or there is 
not. If there is a deal, the 
North Vietnamese are going to 
begin rebuilding .their roads 
and bridges so what difference 
does it make if they get start-
ed a week earlier?" 
If the bombing halts should' 
continue for several weeks and 
the planes then be sent against 
the North again, there would 
be some risks, according to 
military officers. Any pause in ' 
aerial attacks gives the other ,? 
side a chance to rebuild air 
defenses and communications 
lines. Thus, if the attacks 
should be renewed, losses in 
the. first few days to the reju-
venated defenses would be ex-
pected to be relatively high. 
There is much less concern 
abOut any "surge" of men or 
material moving to the South 
during a bombing pause. After 
the beating North Vietnam has 
taken in the last 'month, it is 
assumed at the Pentagon that 
the respite would be devoted 
to reconstruction rather than 
tn.qn all out effort to move 
men and war material south. 
As part of its "goodwill ges-
ture," the United States has 
stopped low-level manned re-
connaissance flights, as well 
as attacks over the north. 
When RF4 photo planes have 
been sent over the north, they 
have normally been escorted 
by armed fighters prepared to 
respond with bombs, rockets 
d machine gun bullets to 
any attack on the recon plane. 
No Land Grabs Seen 
But the possibility of' such 
"protective reaction strikes". 
has been reduced by the deci-
sion to rely on information 
gained by drones dropped 
from C130 transport planes 
and SR71 recon planes which 
streak over Vietnam above the 
range of anti-aircraft guns and 
at more than 2,000 miles-
per-hour. 
In the Laotian panhandle, in 
Cambodia and in South Viet-
nam itself, the -Communist 
forces are still under-continu-
ing -air attack. Pentagon offi-
cials say they see no sign at 
this time of a major effort on 
either side to_seize significant 
chunks of territory in prepara-
tion for a cease-fire. 
"What you see on both sides 
Is an awful lot of I-don't-want-
to-be-the-last-one-to-4:11e," ,one 
general at the Pentagon said. 
If the fighting should-contin-
ue at some level in the future,

The North Vietnamese Government who on their assumption are not ag-

arc "wer crimes," and this accusation Their second and more substantial 
plays a'very important part in the way response is that the laws of war can; 
they describe the war, both to them-
selves and to others. In 1965 and 1966, 
when American bombing in North 
Vietnam began; their Government re-
peatedly threatened to try captured 
American-airmen as war criminals, un-
der the Nuremberg precedents, but in 
recent years this intention, if ever se-
riously, entertained, appears .to have 
been abandoned. 
However sincerely the North Viet-
namese today hold the belief ,that the 
American bombing is "criminal," I 
think it is clear that the, practical val-
ue of this concept for them is Primari-
ly for internal morale and external 
propaganda putposes, and there is lit-
tle likelihood that the American pris-
not remain frozen at the Nuremberg 
level, but must respond to the march 
of events, and that by now the futility
and inhumanity of "strategic" bombing 
has been so clearly demonstrated that 
It must be outlawed, much as poison 
gas was after the First World War.' To 
this I can only, say amen, but objec-
tivity obliges the response that efforts 
to formulate such a law have failed 
for over half a century, and that the 
demand for it has-come chiefly from 
countries that do not have strategic 
air power at their disposal. I am, 
fear, too much of a legal traditionalist'
to accept this argument in its Nth 
sweep. ? 7 
But surely the bombing of Hanoi(

trial before a North Vietnamese court der the principle 'of "proportionality" 
While the North Vietnamese war-
crimes literature covers American mili-
etary operations in both North and 
South Vietnam, in recent months, the 
emphasis has been almost exclusively 
on our aerial bombardments in the 
North. ? 
The Vietnamese case 'does not rest 
exclusively on the antipersonnel 
bombs, but rather embraces the en-
tire program of aerial bombardment, 
with emphasis on the civilian casual-
ties. To assess this charge carries the 
judge into highly controversial areas 
?the rule, that there must be a reason.' 
able relation between the military ob-: 
jective and the. damage and suffering 
which its attainment will entail. A' 
single enemy soldier is a legitimate 
target whether he is in the ,frontline' 
or on home leave, but to level a city' 
block to kill him at home is beyond 
the bounds of proportionality. 
It is under this principle that ourl 
bombing operations at Hanoi appear, 
most vulnerable ,toethe charge of crim-
inality. The military objectives, even' 
as described by the Pentagon, seem so, 
in which the "law" is far from clear, trivial, and so remote from our shores,-' 
and requires that Hanoi and Haiphong that the death and destruction we

? law under which to call it criminal? 
When I put this question to the 
North Vietnamese lawyers, they gave 
two answers. The first was that our

ireated are to be charged witliC 
common crimes instead of. po-
Ilitical ones .because, it is RC- ? ; 
knowledged, the prisoners are. 
easier to deal with that way. 
The. Communist demand for.) 
release of all political prison:), 
era has been a sticking point 
in the Paris negotiations and a. 
the government's intention, 
hotirces said, is to keep the 
Imbiber of prisoners down, at? 
leant on paper. , 
Thicu's hard line Is in keep-
ing with his conviction that, f 
after the cease-fire, his govern. 
meat will remain fit war with - 
the Communists by all means 
short of big-unit firepower. 
,"The Communists are prepay-
ingjo destroy the cease-fire,".' , 
a Thieu aide warned a gather-? 
lag in Kientuong Province yes- - 
4erday. 
Government officials in the 
provinces say they have been - 
told the Communists will vio-
late the cease-fire with terror-, 
Ism and assassinations and ? 
they must be ready to protect, 
themselves.. ? 
.Thieu's response to this dan-'; 
.ger is evidently to harass and 
intimidate known and sus-
.peeted Communist sympathiz-
ers, as they have been for 
-years. ? 
The. province chiefs have, 
been instructed, South Viet-
namese sources said, that the 
only condition of the arrests is 
that local prosecutors be in-
formed within 24 hours. Once' 
that is done, the sources said, 
the suspects can be detained' 
for as much as six months. 
Because of the vagueness of 
the way it is worded and the 
nncertainty of how the situa-
tion after the cease-fire will 
'develop, Smith Vietnamese of-
&leis have no clear idea of 
low the authority to "shoot 
'troublemakers" will be inter-
;1preted. 
f, During- his one-man presi,i. 
dential 'Campaign in 1971, 
Thieu gave police officials per. 
mission to shoot anyone caus-,' 
ing a "disturbance," but thel 
threat was never carried out.i 
Recently, Thieu authorized po-t, 
lice to shoot thieves caught in 
the act, but that, too, Mai 
never been done,.as far as is. 
known. 
The broad arrest powers, 
given to province chiefs appar-
ently differ from past practice 
,.n that there is to be no direct 
coordination from Saigon, as, 
whs the case, for example? 
with the campaign of arrests' 
after last spring's Communist' 
offensive. Top-level Ainerican 
officialr, who say, they are in-
formed even on the most sen-: 
sitive aspects of Thieu's prepa-
rations for the period after 
the post-cease-fire, insist that 
there is no similar national 
plan for widespread political 
arrests. - 
They did acknowledge, how-
ever, the existence of a plan 
called F-6 that went into effect 
after the start of North Viet-
nam's Easter offensive 'and' 
was a.gdin carried out when a 
cease-fire appeared imminent 
in October. They said the plan 
finally, expired just before 
,Christmas. 
The number of civilians ar-
rested in organized, military-
style sweeps was 26,000, ac-
pording to one senior U.S. in-
telligence source, of whom 14,-
000 have been released. 
What set F-6 apart from rou-, 
tinei political arrests was its 
!scope and the change in the, 
standing practice that had re-
,quireci three separate accusa-
tions of a suspek before he 
was picked up. Under F-6, now 
tended, only one accusation?a, 
l'casual denunciation by an ag-: 
ikrieved neighbor, for instance 
a 
e?was all that was needed for 
an arrest. 
9 Government critics havei 
;charged that the arrests were 
"often used as a means of ex: 
ttortion by police, who then. 
tsold the prisoners their free-
dom. There are also recurring, 
substantiated reports of harsh! 
interrogations and even- .tor-.

Ii is not known as yet 
whether province chiefs will

Saigon Fears" 
Post-Cease-Fire' 
Deserter Surge 
By Thomas W. Lippman 
%Washington Post Foreign Service 
SAIGON, Jan. 15?Some 
South Vietnamese officials 
fear that once a cease-fire is 
signed the army 'could be so 
, decimated by desertions. it 
, would have difficulties help-
' ing the Saigon government 
maintain control of the coun-
, Far from demobilizing, 
South Vietnam is planning, to 
keep.most of its armed forces 
intact after a cease-fire and is 
, counting on the army t9 play 
a major role in running the 
country. , 
; At the end of October, just 
after U.S. negotiator Henry A. 
' Kissinger said peace was at 
hand, the "net desertion rate" 
reached almost 27,000 men per 
month?up from 15;000 to 20; 
. 000 a month during most of 
the summer, according to un-
official but *ell-informed 
bources. 
? The net desertion' rate is the 
number of soldiers who leave 
their Units and do not conte 
'back, either, voluntarily or in 
custody, and must be replaced 
through recruitment and con-
scription to maintain the mili-
tary at 1.1 million men. 
The upsurge in the autumn 
desertions presumably stem-
med from expectations of 
peace. Some Vietnamese be-
lieve the Communists actively 
encouraged desertion after the 
1954 Geneva accords were 
signed _ and expect them to 
launch a similar campaign af-
ter a new cease-fire., 
This is not to say the South 
? Vietnamese army is melting 
sway. By U.S. standards the 
figures are staggering, but 
they must be measured in the 
Vietnamese context.This is a 
tire& low-paid army of peas-
ants with strong ties to family 
and home village, men to 
whom going home is a natural 
impulse. , 
The Monthly desertion rate, 
which is at best an informed 
estimate, has been in five fig-
ures for years. But it is a phei 
itioinenott the cotentry .has' so 
far been able to cope With.

try's military units u.. 7,!: full 
strength, despite the pouia?:-s 
they  took hist year. 
"When the war is on," one 
high-ranking military official 
said, "we have to fight against 
the Communists to protect our 
lives and property, but when 
the cease-fire is declared that 
seems less important. The sol-
diers' first reaction is to take 
a little rest." 
A colonel, who' was a lieu-
tenant at the time of the 195,1 
cease-fire, said his men left 
their units, abandoned their' 
weapons and went home to 
their families, and "there wad 
no way to prevent them,"  
"There is no problem f1ztd4; 
Ing enough soldiers so long at 
the war goes on," one Westerni 
analyst said, "but if there is a 
cease-fire that is another mat-
ter." 
He also said, however, that, 
it Will be difficult to make any 
assessment for some time be4 
cause of the difficulty in get-,

deserters, for example, re-en-

ment bonus. Others -are never 
reported as deserters because 
their commanders continue. to 
draw their pay. ?.

Stalin's ? final victory 
By Laszlo T. Kiss 
The Western press almost unanimously 
welcomed Willy Brandt's success in gaining 
the approval of the West German electorate 
'fot his Ostpolitik. With the exception of C. L. 
Sulzberger (the New York Times), who had 
stated that Honecker won the peace "at no 
price," most of the columnists and editorial 
'writers from Paris, through London to New 
York, were jubilant. Belying this happy mood 
Is the actual fact that Stalin's dialectic-
historical will has prevailed in the heart of 
Europe (Pankow deliberately chose his birth-
day, Dec. 21, for signing the treaty of 
normalization), and that, therefore, these 
free views and sentiments are neither wise 
nor justified. 
,1. A candid analysis of the conspicuously 
, and defiantly totalitarian nature of the 
German "Democratic Republic" ? with the 
Wall as the scene of an open Brechtian 
theater, constantly displaying the morbid 
political reality from within ? should lead to 
the conclusion that its full recognition will be 
a severe, perhaps ultimate blow to the 
book, says that he owes Much' 
tt) Marx although he does not 
subscribe to the materialistic 
ythilosonhy of Marxism. 
With Marx and Jesus 
.,:"Marx has guided me to re-
discover, Jesus Christ and the 
me- lining of His message," he 
Orites. Aild, he contends that 
tae Roman Catholic Church, 
s it has existed in history, 
pontains little that is Chris-
tian." 
Father Diez-Alegrfa says that. 
firistianity must not become 
d political instrument of Marx-
ft socialism, "but neither must 
itabecome a politital instrument 
of anti-Communism, as it has 
Pen." 
a:According to the Jesuit. 
"Acceptance of the Marxist 
analysis of history, with Its 
elements regarding the histori-
cal meaning of class struggle 
and the necessary overtb,row of 
private ownership of the means 
of production, not in any 
way opposed to faith and to the 
Gospels." 
Father Diez-Alegrfa adds: "In 
the present world .situation, an 
increasing number of Chris-
tians happen to reach the con-
viction that they must , make 
common cause with all those 
who commit themsefveS to the 
revolutionary cause of social-
ism." ? 
A Bourgeois Anti-Christianity 
'The author charges the church 
and its "apparatus" with "vis-
ceral antisocialism that is not 
Christian but anti-Christian in 
principle of self-determination in the under-
privileged half of Europe. (The precise and 
profound metaphysical quality of the word 
principle ? as opposed to utilitarian political 
dealings ? must be stressed here.) This 
dramatic regression has not, however, been a 
sudden or exclusively German development. 
It has become apparent during the '60's 
that the legacy of FDR and Churchill ?the 
fighting protagonists of "sovereign rights 
and self-government" ? has been quietly 
rejected by a new generation of sophisticated 
political pragmatists, who rose to govern the 
countries of the West. The new men at the top 
have haughtily dismissed these grand states-
men's lofty political creed ? the Atlantic 
Charter ? as "rhetorical," and while they 
continued to pay lip service to the United 
Nations Charter, evidently they have be-
come much too impressed by the Soviet 
Union's might to go on protesting the subtly 
permanent suppression of its satellites. ? 
Primarily, this cold, calculated change of 
Western hearts and minds in high places had 
a bourgeois way." ' 
Speaking about the Vatican's 
reputed wealth, Father Diez-
Alegrfa says that no one knows 
the balance sheet, but referring 
to estimates that the Holy See 
has assets of $500-million to 
$1-2 billion, the Jesuit remarks 
that such riches in the hands 
of the successor to the Apostlei 
Peter, the Fisherman, is 
pleasant and disquieting." ' 
,If the Pope reduced his ow 
capital base to, say, $50.4on. 
lion, "he surely would not?b ,e-, 
tray either Christ or Peter," Wei 
author observes. The present 
Pope, Paul VI, Is never men4 
tioned by name In the book'S 
197 pages. , 
'A Certain Extrapolation' ' 
Discussing ,teachings of the 
Pope's primacy and infallibility; 
the Jesuit scholar remarks that 
they are "founded on a certain 
extrapolation from various, 
'passages in the New Testa-
ment." Extrapolation means In-
ference, and is less than cer-
tainty. ? 
In a chapter on priestly cell-
bacy, Father Diez-Alegrfa advo 
cates making it voluntary rather 
than mandatory, as it Is now. 
For priests to whom chastityt 
means Heroic effort and ascetic, 
sacrifice, the Jesuit scholar 
says, '"Celibacy for the realmi 
of God becomes a factory of 
madmen. and I advise all those 
who find themselvps caught in 
this trap to free themselves as 
soon as possible of it." ? 
in Eastern Europe and led to the German 
anticlimax: the formal acceptance of the 
Stalinist status quo. 
(It would be a mistake or a false progress 
sive illusion to assume that Brandt might 
have made a "leftist" deal, i.e., between 
Socialists and Communists, at the expense of 
the historically notorious Prussians. The 
Junkers are extinct; only the toilers are left 
? dreaming probably of Hebei and Kautsky 
and their visions about true socialism.) 
A 
2. The main argument on behalf of this 
unequal treaty has been that the polemics of 
the cold war have not brought about mean; 
ingful change and that realism dictates a 
new, more flexible course. However, this nevi 
"realistic" approach (with some of its fea-, 
tures calling Ftapallo to mind) has taken 
place at the time when the exodus of the 
Soviet troops to the Chinese frontiers- his 
begun. Therefore, even with a moderate 
amount of resolution and insight, Bonn and

There are ample indications that the

? 8. Mr. Brandt was right when he said that 
the acceptance of his Ostpolitik will mean the

Ing up to begin negotiations on diplo-
matic relations with East Berlin, 
,many will also be presenting sizable 
bills for money they claim East Ger-

/many has tended to dismiss most of 
these claims as unjustified. But the 
signs are that the Western govern-
ments aren't buying this argument 
, and that East Germany will have to 
:make some kind of settlement as the 
?price for widespread recognition. 
The alleged debts fall into two 
broad categories: claims for war dam-
' ages and crimes committed by the 
'Nazis under the Third Reich, and 
4. compensation for foreign-owned prop-
/'erty expropriated by the Communists 
rafter the war. 
The war-claims issue has long been 
?onb of the thorniest legal problems 
.:/of the Cold War era. Under the 1945 
:Potsd:m Agreement, the Soviet Zone

.rical commitment to freedom. 
Since these matters seem remote to the 
? average American, one would attempt to 
bring them closer to home with the following 
#conclusion: Western societies should not 
;delude themselves, that (in hasty retreat 
from the global totalitarian trend) they can 
abandon their principles abroad without 
,eventually paying the price of contradictions 
at home. Terrorists, some of whom are 
already active within, are thriving on cone 
Itradictions, which herald a-state of Imtxuth

Poland, while the Western sectors 
(now West Germany) were to com-
pensate the countries of the West. 
In 1953, after the breakdown of the 
,Potsdam accords,: most Western na-
tions gave up their reparations claims 
against West Germany, pending a fi-
nal peace settlement with Germany 
as a whole. Nevertheless, Bonn dyer 
the years has paid out approximately 
;$12 billion in individual and other 
;war-related, claims. , 
Payments to Moscow 
'O ON THE OTHER SIDE, East Ger, 
many made substantial repara-
tions payments to Moscow, the only 
one of the four wartime powers to de-
mand payment from defeated Ger-
many. The &est Germans also paid 
some compensation to Yugoslays used 
as forced labor by the Nazis. 
?Despite these precedents, East Ger-
many quickly adopted the position 
that it is a totally new state rather 
than a successor to Hitler's Reich. 
Therefore, the East Germans argue, 
they bear no responsibility for deeds 
committed i1r Germany's name prior 
to East Germany's creation in 1949. 
Any war-related claims, they add, 
should be directed to West Germany. 
Unlike the East Germans, Bonn has 
always regarded itself as the govern-
mental continuation of the German 
4 
. Now, the situation has been corn.?
plicated by the recent basic treaty 
that provides for a new relationship' 
between the two Germanys. It is the 
,treaty, with its recognition that the I 
two states are autonomous, that hasi 
opened the way for recognition of 
? East Germany by Bonn's allies in the4 
, West 
DU its acceptance of two separate 
nations on German soil also implies 
? that there are now two successor ' 
states to the Reich under interna-,.. 
lionar law. That, in the Western view, 
establishes a basis for claims against 3 
East Germany c.e.lating Ao the Nazi 
era. 
Finally, there Is the question, of 
what happened after the war.; 
The Communists seized substantial 
amounts of property, businesses andit 
bank accounts belonging to foreign tf 
nationals and firma, and during then 
two decades when the West held East 
I Germany in diplomatic Isolation, 
there was no way to press eompensal 
tion claims. 4 
The United States, for example, is: 
not among those countries with the/ 
biggest bill to present, but some ex-
perts estimate that Washington has 
potential claims against East Ger.: 
many in excess of $50 million. U.S.; 
officials so far will say only that the i 
matter is "under study" and that no : 
decisions have been made about pre-
cisely what Washington will* do, but 
the expectation is that the United'

kind of payment. ' ? t/

Mrs. Strauss further held that after the

said. 
"After the war," she added, "we had tO I 
stiffer very much because we were Germans.

resistance fighters. Now, with all 
of the Western 'demands against 
East Germany, Bonn is nervously,. 
expecting increased pressure from ? 
Nazi victims in the East. 
? The West German government' 
would like to reestablish the old 
Potsdam principle that, in general, 
claims by Western countries should 
be handled by Bonn, and those from' 
Eastern Europe addressed to East. 
Germany. . 
Some officials here even think 
that Bonn and East Berlin should 
actively cooperate in working out a 
joint stance toward reparations 
claims. If that happens, it would', 
mark the first' instance in Europe's 
postwar history where the two Ger- ? 
manys found themselves on the

Mrs. Strauss, everybody has a gtibd living.

?k Soviet Union do not live well is not true. We 
were having a good life. We had our own , 
house." 
She also owned a television set, a radio, a 
washing machine, and a refrigerator. 
Mrs. Strauss's comments are a reminder 
that even in a tightly controlled regime like 
the Soviet Union, different individuals have 
varied experiences. 
It shows that those accustomed to one-
party politics do not necessarily find free.' 
debate a pleasant, stimulating affair. 
Possibly Mrs. Strauss also found annoying' 
the exaggerations and half-truths that politi-
cians use man election campaign. Those who 
have long lived in a democracy have become,: 
somewhat immune to the hyperbole. But it I 
may bother newcomers. .

Special classification 
1' The Strauss family is not classified as 
"foreign," but as returning Germans. But 
' Mrs. Strauss, like probably many of the 
returning Germans, does not really feel at 
home here. 
; She, like many of those classified as 
foreigners, has a problem of loneliness. ? 
Mrs. ? Strauss was born in the Ukraine, 
came to Geiman territory ?during the war, 
and then settled in Estonia. In the German 
'community there, she spoke "our German"? 
, as learned from her mother. It is an antique 
German, dating back several generations to 
the time when German settlers were invited 
to the Ukraine to farm. 
Mrs. Strauss finds modern German ? diffi-
, cult to use. 
In Estonia her older boy had a German 
lesson once a week at school. The family 
spoke German at home. But Mrs. Strauss 
wanted to come here "to live with the 
? Germans and raise our children in Ger-
many."' 
Others migrate 
Besides the ethnic Germans coming from 
the Soviet Union, 13,120 have migrated from ? 
Poland, and 2,070 from other countries in 
1972. 
Altogether, Gerrnans returning from the 
'"East" have totaled 18,484 this year as ; 
compared with 28,828 in 1971. The main 
reason for the decline is the drop in the 
number getting permission to leave Poland. 
, Poland has used administrative procedures ?: 
to brake the number leaving. For instance, 
those wanting to go must draw up a list of all 
their property, indicating what they plan to 
leaye, what they plan to take. The officials 4 
now find more grounds for refusing per-. 
tnission to leave. , 4! 
Since the re-election of Mr. Brandt, the i 
Soriets have slowed the flow) of German-
speaking emigrants. But at least those wile 
do get an exit visa have more time to prepare 
their move ? about six weeks instead of 
approximately a week earlier. 
Few belongings brought 1 
Mrs. Strauss had to leave "from one day to 
the other," as she put it. ''The family came 
with only two suitcases each full of belong- , 
ings." 
? But as the family 9f a Heimkehrer, a 
:returned soldier, the Strauss family has 
received considerable financial aSsistance 
from the German Government. Not all of 
those coming out of the Soviet Union receive 
quite so handsome subsidies. 
"I always weep when I am at the office for ' 
refugees," she says. "They are so god to ilk 
and help us with anything we need." 
Mrs. Strauss's remarks on religion may be 
a little surprising to Westerners. - 
"In the Soviet Union," she said, "only the 44 
old people are going to church. We have 
always heard that there is no Geld, so we have 
believed it." 
}laid to adapt ? 
Since coming here, Mrs. Strauss has gone 
to a church service once. She sends her boy to" 
confirmation lessons. 
"He was asked if he believed, in God and , 
replied 'no.' So he had some trouble. tiut he 
can't 'adapt so easily and just say, 'now I 
believe in God.' Just because he isn't in 
Russia anymore. ' ' , ? ? , 
"We will also baptize our baby and send our : 
girl to the Lutheran Church." 
Evidently the tendency, for many people tO 
conform to their society.-- free or not ? is

Relations with Europe: 
while Russia's opportu 
By Joseph C. Harseh 
1 Is 1973 to be the year of Russia's golden 
opportunities rather than President Nixon's 
"year of Europe"? 
' Any appraisal based on today's pattern of 
relationships among the Western powers and, 
Itussia would have to conclude that never, 
? since World War II has the United States been ? 
so unpopular with its European friends and 
allies and the opportunities for Russian; 
diplomacy and trade with them so promising., 
It is almost as though the West European 
? perception of its two great flanking neighbors 
163.c1 been reversed,. ? , 
? Less than five years ago Russia had 
? ravished Czechoslovakia andappeared in the 
eyes of people to the west of that unfortunate 
country to be the primal monster, red in tooth 
and claw, ready to devour. West Europe was ? 
, so shocked by the repetition in Czechoslo- ? 
,valcia of what had ?previously been done to 
Hungary that even Communists in France 
and Italy were alienated, and the Italian 
Communist Party publicly condemned what: 
Moscow had done. 
U.S. Ls in the doghouse' ? 
nities appear ()right' 
tion between Washington and Peking. At the 
moment of of that reconciliation Moscow was in 
danger of becoming the most isolated of the 
great powers. 
But the fact that Russia's benign posture of 
the moment was won by Anierican eiplomacy 
is obscured from West European eyes by the' 
Sharp contrast fades 
, At that time the United States was the , 
benevolent friend, ally, and protector whose 
sturdy right arm held a bright, pure shield 
:over the good peoples of Western Europe and 
, kept the monster at bay. 
? No Western artist would paint the neigh-
bors in such contrasting colors today. Not 
since Czechoslovakia has Moscow done any-
thing . comparable to alarm or seriously" 
worry the peoples of Western Europe. 
On the contrary, Moscow has come to 
terms with the West Germans, has accepted 
the present enlargement of the European 
? Common Market, has turned some of its 
nuclear weapons and its divisions away from 
.Europe and faced them instead against 
China, and, just this past week, was treating 
the 'President of France like an old family . 
? friend. ? 
By-product from Peking 
Among sophisticated diplomats this benign 
behavior in Moscow was recognized as a by-
product of an American act of initiative. 
Moscow's "love Europe" posture dates from , 
Richard Nixon's visit to Peking. 
Moscow has ever since been investing in a, 
*est European insurance policy to balance 
att the ,Implications of the great reconcilitt-

continuation of the Vietnam war and the still ' 
vivid memory of the bombing of Hanoi. That 
one ileed substantially equalized the pictures 
Of America and Russia a% perceived in 
'Europe. 
? ' .41 
The contrast between the ravenous mon-,: 
ster and the good protector is forgotten. For ; 
the moment at least Russia almost seems.. 
once more to be a European country withl 
which the Europeans can deal on a friendly 
and neighborly basis. 
Where will all this lead? Can the 'men 
Moscow capitalize on their opportunities? 
They have had similar moments of oppor-, 
tunity in the past, and soiled it by heavy-
handedness. They could blow this as they; 
have blown so many Previous opportunities. 
And there is no damage to the America-
European relationship which could not be' 
repaired by a swift end to the war and a true' 
turn of American interest back to Europe.' 
Yet the ties that have bound the grilled 
States to Western Europe have been coming 
gradually unraveled. The process of weak.' 
ening started way back. The. closeness of the 
early "cold war" period was damaged by the 
Suez crisis (1956) when Washington sided, 
with Moscow against London and Paris. The 
Old Anglo-American "special relationship" 
never fully recovered from the shock of that : 
event. 'And the American-French relationship 
was hurt by the American refusal to come to 
French aid in Vietnam at Dien Bien Phu. 
The unraveling has continued of recent - 
weeks and months. The process has reached 
the point where something inconceivable a 
year ago is conceivable today. 
The Western alliance, essentially that close 
relationship between. the United States and 
Western Europe which is formalized in 
NATO, is no longer to be taken for granted. It: 
can be saved and revived if all concerned do 
their part. Yet, it could also fall apart and ; 
disappear into the pages of history. The year 
1978 will probably see, which way it goes.

line fanatical desperadoes, totally irra-

Egyptian ruling elitt is as reasonable 
!as any, entirely disillusioned and with-
.,out a spark of fanaticism. Every ar 
since 1967 they have said that they 
mere about to set the Middle East on 
but even during the 1969-70 "war 
of attrition" the Egyptians were in fact 
? very careful to control their escalation 
in order to avoid provoking an all-out 
? Israeli resrionse. As for the sub-theme 
? of "the soldiers straining at the leash," 
this Is, of course, a fabrication. Egyp-
tian soldiers have never yet exhibited ; 
? any trace of the kamikaze spirit and ? 
their officers are as prudent a group . 
of men as one could hope to meet any-
where. 
Replaying Suez 
.IN
THE ABSEI4CE of a genuine 
readiness to go to war, the war 
scares orchestrated from Cairo, are a 
vital ingredient of Egyptian diplomacy. 
Its goal?to recoup the losses. of 1967 
without either military success-or dip- ? 
lomatic concessions?is unique in the 
annals of diplomacy. Refusal to negoti-
ate with a hostile party is of course 
quite common, but it does imply a re-
nunciation ,of all attempts to extract 
/Concessions from that party, unless by 
means of war or the threat of war. Such 
a refusal is entirely inconsistent with ;$ 
the combination of diplomatic activism 
and military weakness, and it is a 
' great tribute to Egyptian diplomacy 
that its attempts to square the circle 
littve gained such wide credibility. ? 
? t gyptian diplomatic strategy since 
' 1967 has been to stage a reenactment of , 
the aftermath of the 1956 Suez crisis, ' 
when Israel surrendered her territorial 
gains under diplomatic pressures from 
third parties, including both the Soviet 
Union and the United States. But since 
1967 there has been no third party 
with the will and leverage to replay 
1956, although the 'Russians did their 
very best in 1969-70, with valiant help 
from Washington. 
While the State Department played 
its part by giving well-timed "back-
;grounders" to remind all con-
cerned that the DS, commitment lo 
defend Israel did not extend to its oe 
cupied territories: iik?e' Russians staged I 
a classic threat maneuver, sending in 
--air force squadrons complete with Ci 
!' point defenses, air conditioning and 
,four-star general. 
The Israelis at first behaved as the 
'Russians had expected. They, pulled , 
back their own air 'patrols as Russian? 
air patrol coverage gradually ex. 
panded towards the Suez Canal. But' 
before the critical ,canal line was 
'reached, the Israelis turned to. fight; 
For the Missians It was their first air, 
, battle inee May, 1945, and,1 as one',' 
, Egyptian aCcount put it, "Five of their 
premibr Mig-21Js were shot down irt 
' less than a minute." 
For a while it seemed as if there was 
real danger of Russian escalation, but' 
within two weeks the bureaucrats Who 
now run the Kremlin had Instead ae41 
cepted the U.S.-sponsored cease-fire,A 
and by Aug. 7, 1970, the canal was quiet , 
again, as it has been ever since.

FROM
THIS devaluation of Russian , 
military support in Arab eyes to 
the erosion of Soviet influence in the 
? Middle Eas and the Russians' expul-
sion from gypt, the path was down, 
'hill all the way,?and a direct repetit 
tion of the "eoliapse of the post-war. 
Anglo-Arab alliance. 
But the failure of the 1956 re-run did'', 
have at least one significant effect: It 4 
solidified Israeli resolve to see the cri-
sis through until the Egyptians finally 
give up their strategy of avoiding a di-
rectly negotiated settlement. 
Not too much should be made of the :1 
annexationist claims voiced by Allon, 
Dayan and whoever else is seeking 
Mrs. Meir's job. The tough old men 
and women who hold the reins of 
power in Israel, whose entrenched posi-
tion in the party secretariat has no,1 
parallel outside the Soviet Politburo, 
have yet to make any formal 
tonal claims except for East Jertt-
salem and the Golan Heights; if ordyi'l 
for social reasons, they oppose thei 
integration of Arab-inhabited areas. , 
Having lived through two genertt 
lions of conflict, including the last five 
years in which the cyclical nature of 
American diplomatic support, the ; 
short-sighted pragmatism of the Euro., 
peans and the ephemeral quality of , 
Russian military adventurism have all' 
lieen exposed, the veteran politicians 
who run Israel have become more de. 
termined than ever to stick it out: in' 
other words, no territorial concessions ? 
without a settlement, and no Settle-4 
ment without direct Arab-Israeli tiego-
tiat ion

POSITION is not so oblivious'
I. of Western interests as it has 
sometimes been made out to be. The 
last five years have proved that the 
threats of expropriation of U.S. oil in-
terests emanating from Cairo are hol-
low. The Algerians, Libyans and Iraqis 
have indeed expropriated U.S. oil corn- , 
panics, and will do so again if the 
move Is to their advantage, regardless 
of what the U.S. secretary of state 
Says, or does not say, about Arabs and 
,Jews. When oil industry conditions are , 
such that expropriation is a poor bar-
gain, they will not expropriate. 
For the Libyans, whose rate of inter-
est on discounted future income is 
.only 4 to 5 per cent, it makes perfect 
:sense to curtail oil production, since 
,prices are expected to rise and their 
reserves are not infinite. For the Alge-
rians It has also made sense to expro-
priate the pro-Arab French while sign- ? 
ling a Major natural gas contract with 
U.S. interests that includes solid and 
tangible guarantees against any politi-
cally motivated interference. 
As for the truly Important il pro- , 
ducers in the Persian Gulf, it is obvi-
ous that Egyptian influence on their j 
policies has now declined to the point 
where calls for retaliatory action ' 
against U.S. oil interests would Simply , 
be ignored. After all, an American oil 
company has operated Egyptian oil 
fields for a decade, enjoying the most , 
cordial relations with the Egyptians? 
regardless of all the Anti-American 
fulminations out of Cairo. 
Difficult as it is to accept the fact, 
after endless statements to the con-
trary, the inescapable truth is that 
there is no linkage between the con-
/duct of foreign policy and the oil situa-
tion in the Middle East?though there 
imay be reverse linkage. 
The French were awfully popular ' 
with the Arabs after 1587, but they paid 
$L40 per barrel of crude just like the 
,unpopular Americans. De Gaulle 
earned much Arab praise for having 
ditched Israel, but French gains in the 
oil sector have ben insignificant: alt 
exploration permit for a part of Saudi 
Arabia long since given up as dry by 
the U.S. Arameo company and a eopro-
, duetion deal for a small Iraqi oil field, 
which makes U.S. Savings Bonds look 
, like a racy investment. As against this, 
at the height of their popularity, the 
French lost their valuable Algerian oil 
concessions, as did U.S. oil companies, 
which nonetheless received better 
'compensation for their much smaller 
investments. 
? if there is no real linkage between 
U.S. policy towards I Israel and the 
fortunes of the oil industry, why is 
it that U.S. oilmen regularly preach 
the need for a more "evenhanded'? 
policy? For one thing, some of them 
? still retain a charmingly simple view 
of the Soviet Union as bent on physi-
cal expansion; but perhaps the main 
? reason is that on their next trip to Bei-
rut or Jidda their Arab friends will be 
grateful. 
? We all like to please our friends, and 
we all want to be liked, but the fact 
? remains that unless there is direct mili-
tary damage to the wells, pipelines and 
tanker terminals?which is most im-
probable?the oil industry will remain 
unaffected by the political situation in 
the area?or even by a new war. If the 
, Russians want to buy oil, they too will - 
pay the going?and rising?price, and 
; the oil business is too well organized to ? 
allow deft, operators to make a idIlirig,. . 
as the Russians ,did on the U.S. wheat 
market.

DAILY TELEGRAPH, London 
3 January 1973 
UPHILL WORK FOR SADAT 
EGYPT began the New Year inauspiciously with further 
signs of malaise and uncertainty. President SADAT'S 
announcement of preparations for the final battle sounded 
less convincing and fell flatter than ever before, which is 
inevitable in view of excessive repetition and non-fulfilment. 
Another familiar aspect of the depressing cycle of futility 
is the demonstrations by frustrated war-eager students 
which have been going on for the past few days. As before, 
the police took vigorous action and made some scores of 
artests, with the result that the students are now 
deMonstrating for their colleagues' release?albeit in the 
university precincts, which is safer than on the streets.

PITS BEING SO, in the Middle Eatt 't 
U.S. policy need only to pursue its 
traditional goals: to preclude a recov-
ery in Russian influences in the region, 
to guard the political flanks of NATO, 
and to avoid entanglements in Israeli 
military gambles or Arab ' political ; 
maneuvers. The days when foreign 
service officers set out to play politics 
In the drawing rooms of Arab poten-
tates are over; it may be a pity that all 
those desirable assignments to Bagh-
dad, Cairo and Damascus have been ; 
lost, but it makes no concrete differ- ' 
ence to U.S. interests. 
1' To play a straightforward and low-
risk balancing game, the U.S. already 
has reliable allies, including Jordan 
'and the mat efficient state in the area,, 
Israel. Even if it had no stronger ethnic i 
connection into domestic policies than 1, 
Ruritania?American support for Israel, 
would be still a worthwhile investmest. 
The survival of the pro-Western Arab 
regimes in the Middle East has ironi-
cally depended on Israeli military pow-
er; Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and 4. 
the Persian Gulf states would have all 
? been drawn into the anti-Western or, 
obit' of Egyptian policy had Nasser won 
even a qualified defensive victory in 
1967. Similarly, in the absence of a 
'powerful Israeli air force, the Russian 
.adventure of 1970 could have been 
successful, thus providing the basis' 
for 
for an inclusion of the area in the 
Russian sphere of .influence. 
In fact, U.S. policy toward Israel' 
should be guided by the same hard-
headed coaideratiOns that have 
guided U.S. Miley toward Turkey4nd 
Iran. If so, genuine American interests 
will be served, while Israel will receive: 
its'due without having to undergo the ,! 
,,electoral cycles in U.S. support that' 
'were such an Undignified feature or 
U.S. politica in 1968 and lea. ? 
Russian military helpers last July is very far from healed. 
The numbers that have since returned are altogether 
smaller than was expected. Mr SADAT is still " shopping 
around" for foreign arms and backers. It was announced 
yesterday that during the next few weeks half a dozen 
countries in Asia and South America will be sending theW* 
Foreign Ministers to Cairo. The fact that China is among 
them seems calculated to needle Russia, but she gives no 
? sign of reacting. Much more important is the belief that 
America will shortly start a fresh attempt to persuade 
? the ,two sides to reach an agreement 'for the reopening 
of the Suez Canal and a partial Israeli withdrawal in Sinai. 
Mr SADAT, while rattling his somewhat rusting sabre, May, 
well be scanning rather more eagerly the Western horlittittri 
'for signs of President Nixon's emissaries. ?

GUARDIAN/LE MONDE MELT 
Manchester, 30 Dec..1972 , 
Sadat's .'indecisiVe year 
, 
ARAB WORLD by David Hirst 
1 Last year, 1971, was to have 
been President Sadat's "year of 
? decision." By the end of it he was 
1 
to have settled the Middle East 
crisis by military or diplomatic 
means. It turned out to be another 
, year of indecision and ? although, 
- apart from an occasional "zero 
hour", he has steered .clear of 
setting more deadlines ? 1972 has 
proved quite as indecisive too. 
The taking of a real decision 
implies a real measure of control 
lover the political environment. In 
I the Arab world only a ruler of 
Egypt, as the local great power, 
Icanin ,heevearreaaspai rse at, om wholeoul dNeavsesnetrs, 
in spite of his immense prestige,. 
I eventually lost his grip. Sadat 
never really had one. Unquestion-
; ably the great event of 1972, and 
ostensibly the great "decision", 
I was Sadat's expulsion of 20,000 
; Russian experts. As a result of it, 
I he is no better off, diplchbatically, 
: at the end of the year then he was 
; at the beginning. Militarily, he is 
i far worse off. The expulsion was 
: largely triggered by the Russians' 
; refusal to supply Egypt with the 
"offensive" weapons which the 
? army considered they needed and 
? deserved. But it left Egypt ' not 
only without offensive weapons 
but without a reliable defensive 
system which is the indispensable 
prerequisite for a renewal el fight - 
; ing across the Suez Canal.- ? 
It was to be expected that such 
1 a move ? one of the most dramatic 
- changes of course in modern 
' Egyptian history ? would have 
, formed part of a grand design 
meticulously planned, carried out 
and followed up, and that the whole 
ruling apparatus would have been 
? geared to securing the maximum 
? payoff. In forfeiting the military 
support of the Russians Sadat 
' should logically? have sought the 
diplomatic ? the hopefully much 
more effective diplomatic ? support 
of the Americans and the West 
Europeans. But this was not to be. 
For it had not been so much a 
bold decision, maturely thought? -
out, as a desperate gamble. It 
turned out to be an another lurch 
, on Sadat's zigzag course, another 
? landmark on his slide into inco-
herence. Sadat rules from day to 
day, gimmick to gimmick, promise 
to false promise. He cannot decide 
from strength; he only reacts 
from growing weakness. 
On this occasion the pressures 
came from inside Egypt. They were 
the natural consequence of his 
failure to keep his "year of deci-
sion" pledge. Student riots in 
January were the first of a series 
Of internal convulsions. In July 
getting rid of the Russians was 
the only way to appease his army 
commanders, openly chafing at 
what they regarded as the Rus-
sians' contemptuous ways, or even 
to head off an army coup. It did 
buy him a certain popularity; but 
he himself foresaw' that it would 
+es 
. . 
not last long, for even as he basked?  ' 
in a little meretricious glory, he 
, passed his draconian "national 
unity" law which was designed to 
cow the regime's growing army of 
critics.-
Of course he did try to give his 
gamble' some kind of coherent 
follow-up. He launched into a bid 
' to win friends and influence in 
Europe. But his European offensive 
suffered a grave setback, not this 
time from disruptive forces in Egypt 
itself, but from a quarter which can 
-always be counted upon to foil 
others' ambitions even if they are 
quite incapable of adfieving their 
own ? the Palestinians. True 1972 
saw a further decline of the Pales-
tinian guerrilla movement. Yasar 
Arafat and the Fatah leadership 
continue to dominate the Palestin-
ian scene. But, once hailed as a 
break with the old Arab order, 
he and his colleagues look and 
behave more and more like just 
another Arab regime. Arafat has 
shown, like Sadat, that he is in-
capable of putting through the real 
structural reforms that alone can 
ultimately save him. In October 
this year, after a number of rum-
blings through the year, he faced 
what nearly became a full-scale 
mutiny in the Fatah rank-and-file. 
; But out of the decline of conven-
tional guerrilla action, Black Sept-, 
ember, and its brand of pure, 
anarchic terrorism, has arisen. The 
, idea that the world is going to be 
engulfed in an ever-expanding 
wave of Arab ' terrorism can 
be ruled out. In spite of all the 
investigatory efforts, not much was 
learned about the organisational ' 
identity of Balck September. In . 
the nature of things, operations 
like Munich ? which was just the 
most "successful" of a series dur-
ing the year ? suffer from a law 
of diminishing returns. However, 
designed to achieve maximum ef - 
feet with minimum resources, they 
have so far managed to produce 
an emotional backlash which amply 
ensures that they fulfil their strictly 
negative purpose: to ? foil the 
peace-seeking efforts of Arab re-
gimes and the "liquidation" of the 
Palestinian cause which they in-
evitably foreshadow. Sadat's Euro, 
pean offensive would probably have 
failed anyway, and his American 
one never got off the ground, but 
Munich pre -empted both. 
It is not only the guerrillas, by, 
definition outside the framework 
of "official" inter-Arab relations, 
who foil Sadat's purposes and 
wreck his decisions. All of a 
sudden, Syria, Egypt's partner 
in the tri -party Federation of Arab 
Republics, began in the second 
part of the" year to take a dis-
ruptive, wilful course of its Own. 
Partly it was the effect of Munich. 
The Israeli retaliatory raids had 
gone on regularly during the year, 
but after Munich they turned into 
? the more destructive "strike-first" 
strategy. Hundreds of civilians 
died in raids ostensibly aimed at ; 
guerrillas in Syria and Lebanon. 
President Asad came under strong 
pressure to retaliate. Partly, too, 
it was the effect of the Russians' 
expulsion from Egypt. Asad began 
to fear that Sadat will go it alone 
in an American-sponsored partial 
settlement which will leave him 
high and ? dry without the return 
of the Golan. Evidently with Rus-
sian encouragement, Asad sought 
to demonstrate 'to Sadat that he 
could not hope Or a settlement at 
Syrian or Russian expense. After 
; years of caution, Asad began to 
? warm up the Syrian front with 
Israel in a, way which reminded 
people that it was the self-same 
'Baathists who did so much to 
trigger the war of 1967. 
!, Jordan, the third Arab country; 
' with territory to recover, continued 
to seek its own salvation. King 
Hussein, having apparently de-
cided that a "military solution" ' 
is out' of the question, bent over 
backwards to prove himself Israel's 
good neighbour. Alone among Arab 
?leadership he denounced Black 
September ? the work of "sick 
minds." He continued his all-out 
Opposition to the guerrillas. He 
kept his army deployed against 
?

year development plan in which 
.the Jordan valley, devastated in 
'the guerrillas' heyday, will have ? 
a key place. 
Sadat has had little more suctess 
in the rest of the Arab world. 
King Faisal, leader of the conser-
vative Arab camp, has shown, in 
, his quiet way, that there are de-
finite limits on what Sadat, who 
, has tried so hard to cultivate 
his good will, can expect of him. 
Throughout the year Cairo con-
stantly returned to the old re-
frain ? an admission of military 
weakness ? that the Arabs should 
use their oil weapon against the 
Western backers of Israel. But 
the emergent American- energy 
crisis offers Saudi Arabia, holder 
of the world's largest oil reserves,. 
an opportunity Faisal apparently 
intends to-seize with both hands. 
Oil Minister Ahmad Zaki Yarriani" 
announced that his country was , 
planning to increase production 
to a fantastic thousand million 
tons a year by 1980, and he 
urged the United States to offer 
Saudi oil a "special place" in the 
U.S. market. This would bind Saudi 
Arabia to the United States, more 
effectively than any Russian-style 
"treaty of friendship and coopera - 
tion", with indissoluble bonds of 
economic and commercial self - 
interest. 
The Sudan, once a candidate for 
membership of the Federation of 
Arab Republics, has reasserted 
its African identity; this has 
brought the end of its long and 
bitter civil war in the south, but

15 January 1973 
Mass trial in Turkey 
draws concern in Europe 
By a staff correspondent of , 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Beirut, Lebanon 
Europe and the Middle East observers are 
; watching with anxiety the new mass trial that ' 
has just opened in Turkey. 
It appears to be yet another sign of the 
power of the Turkish armed forces in the 
'nominally parliamentary regime. 
Even before this latest millitary trial of ? 
. . 
scores of alleged leftists began Jan. 10, there 
had been increasing criticism in the Council .! 
of Europe of the repression of nonviolent ; 
dissenters in both Greece and Turkey. Both 
countries are members of NATO, and both 
would like to exchange their present asaoci-
' ation with the European Common Market for 
rn 
full membership. 
On the other side of the Turkish coin is the 
frequent eruption of urban and rural guer-
' rilla violence. One example was a Jan. 3 
incursion of guerrillas from Syria into Hatay 
' Province. 
. Hostages taken 
Like other guerrillas active in Turkey since 
1970, these may have been members .of the 
, Turkish People's Liberation Army. This 
group has taken hostages aitiong American, 
British, and Canadian personnel serving in 
Turkey and in 1971 killed ,the Israeli consul 
general in Istanbul. 
The concern in Western European opinion 
about Turkey, however, stems not from 
Turkish Army action against guerrillas but 
? against what it regards as the arbitrary 
arrests of nonviolent critics and the subordi-
nation of democratic rule to orders from the 
military. 
Lash month the Council of Europe's Nether-
lands delegate, Pieter ,Dankert, was invited 
by the Ankara government to undertake an 
? investigation in Turkey after Turkish For-
eign Minister Hayuk Bayulken denied pub-
lished charges of the frequent torture of 
political prisoners. 
'Unfavorable reaction possible 
Stec? Mansholt, the outgoing chairman of 
the Commission of the European Commu-
nities, said last month that the commission 
might react unfavorably to Turkey's appli-
cation for EEC membership if Mr. Dankert's 
time with the government it thitinates the region. ?

findings back the charges of torture and other ; 
arbitrary acts. 
, For this latest mass trial in Ankara, 267 
alleged members of the extreme leftist 
Turkish Revolutionary Workers and Peas- ' 
ants Party were indicted. Some 185 of these 
are reportedly expected to stand trial on 1 
charges ranging from the capital offense of 
seeking to overthrow i1 the government to, 
merely insulting officials. 
Since the Turkish armed forces moved into 
a more active role behind President Cevdet ' 
Sunay in running the country in March, 1971,: 
and imposed martial law in 11 provinces a ' 
month later, about 3,400 people accused of 
terrorism, subversion, or "propagating Com-,i 
munist ideology" have faced military courts. 
Severe sentences given 
Unusually severe prison sentences have 
been imposed on many of the hundreds of 
intellectuals, lawyers, writers, journalists, 
ands students arrested. 
Last month a mass trial in Ankara jailed 52 
teachers for periods ranging up to eight years 
for "transforming their union into a clandes-
tine Communist cell." , ? 
Another conviction was that of Prof. Ugur ? 
Alacakaptan, a respected Turkish jurist, who 
was sentenced id six years and three months ' 
in prison and an additional 23 months' exile. . 
Eight other defendants convicted with 
Professor Alacakaptan had taken part in a 
protest march in Ankara in June, 1970, after . 
shooting between leftist and rightist univer-
sity students. Turkish liberals alleged gov-'i 
ernment agents had provoked the trouble. 
Examples reported 
Professor Alacakaptan also was convicted 
of "insulting military authorities" during his . 
court defense of Prof. Mumtax Soysal, now' . 
serving six years for having included eX.1 
planations of Communist forms of govern-
ment in a standard text on constitutional law. 
The book was used for three years in 
universities before the military authorities ' 
filed charges.

Raising the Double Standard Over Greece 
7 A House subcommittee filed 
bitchy little r porte two 
, weeks ago, complaining pet-
ulantly of the Navy's decision 
to homeport a part of the 
Sixth Fleet in Greece. But 
, the thrust of the report wasn't 
directed at American admi-
rals; it was directed at Greek 
, colonels instead. 
The authors of this report 
agreed that the United States 
has legitimate military anti' 
security interests in .Greece, 
' relating both to NATO and to 
the Middle East. They could, 
not convincingly challenge 
the Navy's choice of Athens 
in terms of the city's hous-
? ing facilities and the like. 
This was their point: 
"The circumstances of that 
' choice indicate that our gov-
ernment is more concerned 
about obtaining the minor 
? advantages and conveniences 
of homeporting in Greece 
, (instead of Italy, for exam-
ple) than about expressing 
our opposition to the Greek 
dictatorship through a policy 
i of minimal and cool relations 
until democracy is restored 
. in that country. The world 
looks to the United States to 
'stand up for democratic prin-

ciples and if we shirk that 
? responsibility, we are negat-
? ing the most important prin-
ciple on which this country 
stands." 
Members of the subcatn-
mittee,. headed by Benjamin 
S. Rosenthal of New York, 
? took a lugubrious view of the 
present government in 
Greece. It is not, they believe, 
"stable." There may be some 
short-term advantage in the 
homeporting decision, but 
"our long-term need is for a 
stable Greek government 
which will come through a 
democratic restoration." The 
Navy, they insist, should have 
chosen Naples, Livorno or 
Taranto instead. 
The authors' conclusions, 
viewed on their merits, have 
no merit. Whatever else may, 
be said of the government in 
Greece, like it or not, it is 
stable. The colonels have been 
firmly in power for nearly 
six years. Their oppositi6h is 
divided, disorganized, and im-
potent. Restoration of what 
is euphemistically, known as 
"democratic rule" would in-
vite a return of the chaotic 
conditions that obtained prior 
to 1967. If forces of the ex-
Greek regime lacks

said he was a "fatalist," 
"It's a kind of a Greek

from a politician who once

By contrast, if; "stability" is 
the desideratum; one may re-
call that Italy has had 34 gov-
ernments since World War H. 
Never mind the merits. 
,What is baffling to the ob-
server of foreign affairs is the 
double standard one constant-
ly encounters. Indeed? when 
it comes to our relations with 
the rest of the world, we seem 
to have double standards for 
double standards. " 
Surely this is true in the 
matter of Communist re-
gimes. This past year saw the 
President of the United States 
toasting the Conununists of 
China and Rbssia, and bomb-
ing the Communists of North 
Vietnath. It is equally true of 
dictatorships. Rosenthal and 
his colleagues despise the 
dictatorship in Greece. They 
never cease to mourn the 
absence of democracy in 
Portugal, Rhodesia, and South 
Africa. But you will not see 
them standing up for demo-
cratic principles, in Zambia, 
Tanzania, and the Sudan. 
We see the same double ' 
?'itandard id the matter of 
moral outrage. When U.S. ' 
bombs fall on Hanoi, it Is 
barbarism; when Soviet mis-
sites fall on Quang Tri, it is 
no more than the fortunes of 
war. The history of the bloody 
conflict in Vietnam is in part a 
history of the torture, =tile-
tion and murder imposed by 
terrorists from the North upon. 
peasants of the South. This, 
part of the history seems to 
affect congressional liberals 
not at all. 
We ought to weep for the 
dead of war, whoever they 
are, however they die. And

Intimidate critics 
Mr. Papadopoulos is believed; 
likely to make occasional pub-1 
lic appearances in the rural 
sections of the nation this year, 
similar to his visit to Crete 
last. month.. These apparently 
would have the makings of a 
preliminary political cam-
paign. His supporters say he 
was warmly received in Crete 
but opponents dispute this, 
calling the response a facade. 
Alide from such limited de-
velopments as these, the re-
gime has permitted little politi-
cal change. The former politi-
cal parties remain outlawed. A 
constitution ratified ;in 1968 has 
not been put into effect. news-
papers operate under a vague 
press law designed to intimi-
date the government's critics. 
The government acknowl; 
edges holding about 250 politi-
cal prisoners ? although it: 
objects to- describing them as 
such ? as well as about 15 
others imprisoned pending 
trial. Observers here say, how-
ever, they know of at least 20 
jailed without trial since Au-
gust. The government disputes 
allegations that political pris-
oners are tortured. ? . 
The Greek political opposi-
tion remains in disarray, and 
the regime seems largely indif-
ferent to criticism from other 
nations, such as the mild pres-
sure for moves toward democ-
racy from the Nixon adminis-
tration, sharper attacks from 
two U.S. House of Represents-
' fives subcommittees last 
month, Greece's forced with-
drawal from the Council of 
Europe and its partly curtailed 
, dealings with the European 
Common Market. Both Euro-
pean organizations acted on 
political grounds. 
."Our course is not going to 
be influenced by anything," Mr. 
Stamatopolous, the undersecre-
tary of state for information 
and the press, said hien inter-
view, calling outside pressure 
"political blackmail." Mr. Pa-
padopoulos had also denounced 
similar "blackmail" last 
month in his most recent major 
address.

Athens spokesman

Staffkorrespondent of . 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Athens 
United States and Greek naval officers ' 
'have signed a new "technical agreement" on , 
home port facilities used by the U.S. Sixth 
Fleet here. 
Byron Stamatopoulos, Greek under-
minister for the press, specified that Greece, , 
under arrangements already begun when six , 
destroyers of U.S. Destroyer Squadron 12' 
arrived 
arrived here last fall, "is granting the same 2, 
4, kind of NATO facilities as France, Italy, and 
' ohters grant to the United States. A ? 
"The agreement has no other significance. 
This will not be an operational base or a naval 
arsenal," Mr. Stamatopoulos insisted. 
' No ownership involved 
Official U.S. sources here stresa that the. 
United 
United States is not acquiring ownership or 
title to any facilities in Greece. The ships are 
using existing anchorage and berthing facil-
ities. Later, a mobile naval pier may be 
provided at Elevsis, about 10 miles west of ! 
Athens. 
Procurement of food, fuel, and other 
supplies and services is by local contract. 
Some 1,700 officers and men of the de-
stroyer squadron, about 450 American fami-
lies in all, including some 1,000 dependents, 
are already living in private houses and ? 
apartments rented in the Athens area. This 
number is expected to rise eventually to 6,000 
military personnel and 3,100 dependents. 
They are to be joined here later by an .1 
aircraft carrier that will also use Piraeus, the 
port of Athens, as home port. There it ' 
speculation here that the carrier and its 
personnel ' may be covered bi the new 
arement.

Last Oct. 14, the Greek alternate foreign 
affairs minister, Phaedon Anninos-Kavalier-
atos, said negotiations beginning in January, 
1972, led to signing of "minutes of under- 4

Two subcommittees of the U.S. House of

"The regime has no representative charac-

"The fact that the U.S. relies on making

Dater she lost her factory job

then got a position as an Eng-

On her way to 'work on Dec.

a member of the liberation 
army, which is known as E.LN. 
'According to Dr. Loria, the 
organization is "planning to 
overthrow our Government 
and is trying to create a Viet-

in the State Department de-, 
scribe it as a terrorist organ4'

It has actively mounted 
guerrilla campaigns-against the 
three military Governments 
Since then. According to the 
State 'Department, it apparent-
ly switched its strategy from 
rural insurgency 'to urban ter-

and recently officials uncov-
ered' an attempt to assassinate 
President Hugo Banzer Suarez, 
whose right-wing Government 
has been in power since a coup 
d'etat in August, 1971 ? the 
181st coup in the turbulent 
147-year history of Bolivia. 
On Nov. 23 President Banzer 
imposed a state of siege 
throughout the country, assert-
ing that there was an open 
conspiracy to overthrow his 
Government. As a result cer-
tain individual rights were sus-
pended under the Constitution 
and a modified form of martial 
law is in effect for the popula-
tion of more than five million. 
It is this that has complicat-
ed the Harding case. State De-
partment sources say that under the martial law both na 
tionals and foreigners may b 
held in "indefinite detention

According to Miss Kelley; 
also a former nun ,0 who lived 
here now, more than 1,000 
Bolivians are being held as 
political prisoners in Viacha, 
Achacalla and Coati. She said 
that prisoners were being tor-
tured and others had been shot 
"while trying to escape." 
Miss Kelley said her informa-
tion came from a document 
published in exile and another 
document that had probably 
been written by priests and was 
'smuggled out of Bolivia. 
Asked about political prison-
ers, Dr. Loria" said that he did 
not have a figure but that , it 
wass nothing like 1.000. Several' 
hundred were freed last month,; 
he added. He acknowledged, 
that prisoners were ,being de-' 
tamed in the areas , cited by 
Miss Kelley. 
In a letter to a friend here in

, The fact that Mr. Meyer remained in the ;

was able to get across the message that he, at" 
least, cared about Latin America ? and this / 
proved of tremendous value in many hemi; 
sphere conferences where he was able to tone 
'down Latin-American criticism of United' 
States policy. ? ? ? 
Now the Latin Americans are wondering 
just who will take over the post and what the 
new occupant will do for relations between 
the United States and thd rest of. the. 
:hemisphere. 
"We're none too hopeful, given the past.

interest President Nixon has shown for this

diplomat in Washington said. "But then we do

perhaps there is some reason for hope." 
A number of names have been mentioned. 
Joseph S. Farland, onetime ambassador to 
Panama, and John M. Hennessy, an inter-.

;as top candidates for the post. 
But all indications suggest the White House, 
has not made a decision and indeed, in the

vacant for some months before being filled, if 
past performance is a criterion. Mr. Meyer, 1

Special to The New York TImes 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 9=-- 
Brazil has banned the sale of, 
Picasso's erotic engravings in 
what appears to be a new wave 
of eultUral puritanism. 
Brazilian intellectuals I ex-
pressed general dismay today 
over the Government's action, 
Which they felt would only tar-
nish this country's image 
abroad. 
There ihas been increasingi 
concern here over official cen-
sorship of the arts. Rip de 
'Janeiro's leading daily, .Jornal 
do Brasil, published a devastat-
ing report Sunday .on culturall 
censorship. 
The ban on the Picasso prints 
by the federal police follows 
the seizure of the Christmas 
Issue of Playboy and refusal to 
authorize the sale of Playboy's 
new magazine, Oui. 
Bookstores Surprised 
' The Picasso engravings are 
'Contrary to public morals and 
good behavior," according to 
the Ministry of Justice. 
This judgment came as sur-
prise to bookstores where the 
$5 Picasso portfolios 'have been 
on sale for three years. 
"It's absurd and ridiculous 
and 'quite incomprehensible," 
'said Dilze Soares, a leader` of 
1Brazil's erotic-surrealist school 
lof painting. 
Miss Soares, who is known 
as Zama, said that she had 
had no trouble with the censors 
'but-that. other members of het 
school had' not been allowed to 
, exhibit their works in Belo Hor-
izonte on the, ground that the 
paintings were a threat to the 
traditions of the family. 
."The erotic is part of nature; 
pornography is a human inter-
pretation and I make a distinc-
I lected "that kind of commercial 
pornography that isn't even ar-
*tistic." 
Movies have been hard hit by 
censors, according to Jornal do 
Brasil. New political films, par-
ticularly from Italy, pa well as 
flims from the United States, 
based, on sex and violence, 
were threatened here. 
, Recent banned films ?include 
Stanley Kubrick's "A Clock-
work Orange," Michelangelb 
Antonioni's "Zabriskie Point," 
Pier Paolo Pasolim's "Decam,ehr 
on" and Ken Russell's "The 
Devils." Other films have been 
released after heavy cuts. 
In 1971, censors prohibited 
the showing of 35 films-13 
Brazilian and 22 foreign?for 
'containing "matter subversive 
or contrary to public morals 
and good behavior." 
There has been an increase 
in censorship in the theater, 
according to a successful play-
wright and director, ? Flavio 
Rangel. 
"The censors want to reform 
humanity and so they exert a 
dual action, preventing any 
analysis of 'the Bra'?iliari situa-
tion and exerting an excessive 
control over morals," Mr. Ran-
gel said in an interview. 
. The ban on the Picasso en-
gravings did not surprise Rio's 
artistic community, which is 
becoming accustomed to the 
rigors of censorship, the play-
wright said. He said that last 
year censors banned a poster 
of a. painting by Michelangelo. 
Book publishers also testify 
fb new intimidation by censors. 
Most publishers prefer not to 
invest time and money in 
works that run the risk of be-
ing seized for political or erot-
ic content.

Sion ordisapproval of the hold-
ing of the meetings in Panama 
City, Since it will bring about 
what is expected to be abra-
sive airing in a hostile atmo-
sphere , of the dispute between 
Panama and the United States 
over the matter of the Panama 
Canal Zone. 
Aquilino E. Boyd of Panama, 
who extended the invitation 
for the meetings in Panama, 
said today that a "semi - co-
lonial" situation existed in all 
Of Latin America and that it 
existed in particular Via "the 
so-called Panama Canal zone" 
where "a colonial situation di-
vides Panama into two parts 
preventing the political, eco-
nomic and social integra-
tion" of his country. 
?Mr.' Boyd called the zone "a 
hotbedt of international ten-
Mons, where a dangerous sit-
:nation, potentially explosive, 
,exists." 
"Panama claims effective 
Sovereignty and exclusive jur-
isdiction over the area in-
valved," he said. "A power 
,foreign to the territory of Pan-
ama occupies the area and the, 
:Council is needed to eliminate' 
Iconflict" regarding the canal. 
Speaking for the United 
States, George H. Bush replied 
that it was essential for the 
proper functioning of the 
Council that? a meeting not be 
conceived as a means for 
bringing pressure on bilateral 
Issues not currently before the 
Council. 
, "Ambassador Boyd," Mr. 
Rush said, "has raised such 
an issue in mentioning the Pan-
ama Canal, the status of which 
Is under active bilateral nego-
tiations. With due reference to 
the history of the area and 
the issues, we, of course, do 
not accept the contention that 
the Canal Zone is an 'inner 
colonialist enclave." 
Mr. Bush recalled that mem-
bers of the Council had earlier 
expressed concern about hold-
ing meetings where public opin-
ion could affect the work of 
the Council. 
"In this case, it is already 
evident that the prospect of 
this meeting is stimulating a 
heated propaganda campaign In 
Panama, which will not be con-
ducive to the kind of atmos-
phere needed for Security 
iCouncil meetings or be helpful 
for the future course of bilat-
eral negotiations," he said. 
Meetings of the Security 
Council away from United Na-
tions headquarters in New York 
,have been rare. In 1948 and 
,again in 1951 meetings were 
held in Paris, concurrently with 
the General Assembly, which
