 The Chinese Communists used the 90th anniversary of the birth of Lenin in
 April to discuss in public what had hitherto been primarily a family quarrel. In
 three major articles and one lengthy speech, Peking gave detailed and forceful
 elaboration to its views on international affairs. Although most of these views
 may not have departed in general theory from those held by Moscow, they did
 conflict sharply with the tactical line which the Soviets had been enunciating, if
 not pursuing, for many months. The Soviet rejoinder, in a speech by Otto
 Kuusinen on 22 April (see Attachment), reflected serious apprehension over the
 Chicom line, probably in recognition that widespread knowledge and understand-
 ing of these statements not only could jeopardize Khrushchev's still-professed
 over-all program for detente and "peaceful coexistence, " but could well imperil
 the whole, future of communism in the underdeveloped areas. The Soviet reply,
 therefore, refuted the bulk of the conflicting Chicom theses, but it was careful to
 couch this refutation in the form of a reply to "bold publicists in the West. "  The
 world press has given considerable attention to portions of the more reckless
 statements in the two articles in the Chicom theoretical journal Hung Chi (Red
 Flag) concerning the acceptability of atomic war. ("The result will certainly not bF
 annihilation of mankind....On the debris of a dead imperialism, the victorious
 people would create with extreme rapidity a civilization thousands of times higher
 than the capitalist system and a truly beautiful future for themselves. ") Relatively
 less attention has been paid, however, to the bulk of the statements, which
 concerned themselves principally with an astoundingly candid exposition of old-
 and hard-line Bolshevist doctrine--which enunciated in most explicit terms the
 Chicom dedication to encouragement and support of violent revolution throughout
 the non-Communist world until such time as all countries become full-fledged
 members of the Communist bloc. The Chicoms categorically reject any .:form of
 government short of a Communist-led "socialist" state, quoting Lenin's stater eat
 that "without proletarian dictatorship... no socialism is possible. " Lenin is also
 quoted as "asserting" that "the emancipation of the proletariat can only come by
 the road of revolution, and certainly not by the road of reformism. " Social
 democrats are dismissed out-of-hand, as are all non-bloc socialist countries:
 "They only put up the signboard of 'socialism' but actually practice capitalism. "
 The Chicoms divide the world into two types of governments -- "socialist"
 (Communist) and "bourgeois. " They then provide direction for Communists in
 "bourgeois" states: "The proletariat should use revolutionary means to seize
 state power, smash the military and bureaucratic machinery of the bourgeoisie,
 and establish a proletarian dictatorship.... It is precisely this fundamental
 question which forms the dividing line between Marxists on the one hand and
 opportunists and revisionists on the other. " And also, "As Lenin said, 'No ruling
 class in the world ever gave way without a struggle.. . and no serious Marxist will
 believe it possible to make the transition from capitalism to socialism without a
 civil war. " The Chicoms make a great point of Marx's statement that "the first
 decree of the ,Z aril commune.. was the suppression of the standing army, and
 the substitution for it of the arrr. ed people.... "  They then note that: "Marxist-
 Leninists should never forget this truth: The armed forces of all ruling classes
 are used in the first place to oppress their people at home.... If the proletariat
 of any country fails to realize this, it will not find the way to liberation. "  Peking
 seizes on Lenin's statement that the opportunity for the "peaceful development of
 the revwlF&
 such rar  opportunities arise, 'the peaceful development... should never be

 regarded as the only possibility and it is therefore necessary to be prepared at
 the same time for... nonpeaceful development. 'r   Peking endorses "parliamentary
 struggles," but only to further the revolution. This earning is even more
 specific: "We should not have any illusions about the bourgeois parliamentary
 system... even if the working-class party commands a majority in parliament. "
 They cite "a number of experiences. . . in various European and i sian countries
 after World War II" as "fresh proofs" that peaceful transition to socialism is not
 possible. In enumerating the tactics which Communists should follow to gain
 power, however, Peking calls for complete "flexibility":  "All the means of
 revolution and forms of struggle, including the illegal and the 'legal,' extra-
 parliamentary and parliamentary, sanguinary and bloodless, economic and
 political, military and ideological. "   "Exchange visits" with the "imperialist
 countries" and the "endeavors to sign agreements of peaceful coexistence or
 treaties of nonaggression, " are seen as useful tactics for "socialist" countries
 to take in the fight for "world peace, " but the Chicoms are careful to point out
 that "peaceful coexistence between nations and people's revolutions in various
 countries are by nature two different things. "  Thus, Peking can sponsor
 "peaceful coexistence" while abetting revolutions everywhere, because "revolution
 means the overthrow of the oppressors as a class by the oppressed people within
 a country" and "all revolutions are just wars. " But even in its peace propaganda
 Peking has become super-cautious: "Marxism-Leninism absolutely must not sink
 into the mire of bourgeois pacifism."  The Chicoms aver that revolution can not
 be "exported" but dodge this nicely by seeing the seeds for revolution present in
 every non-"Socialist" state and then pledge themselves to support such struggles
 "resolutely and without the slightest reservation... until socialism has triumphed
 throughout the world."  They point out that the CCP has had "extremely rich
 experience" both in "uniting with" and "struggling against the bourgeoisie" and
 can therefore lead the way for others in all forms of struggle.                      25X1 C

 1.     Peking, NCNA, in Chinese Hellschreiber to the Press,
 March 30, 1960; text of article by YU Chao-li in seventh
 1960 issue (1 April) of Red Flag in honor of 90th
 anniversary of Lenin's birth -- "On Imperialism as the
 Source of War in Modern Times, and On the Way for All
 Peoples to Struggle for Peace":
 Lenin taught us that in the era of imperialism, the system of imperialism
 is the source of war.... Their exploitation and oppression of the people at home,
 their domination and plunder in the colonies and the semicolonies, and the
 rivalry between the groups of monopoly capital in various countries, in fact,
 breed new wars....
 Eisenhower and his like will never lay down their butcher knives, and,
 ... as an imperialist power, the United States will never abandon its policy
 of war....
 Facts show clearly that, as Lenin pointed out more than 40 years ago,
 the danger of war at present still lies in the imperialist system....
 Imperialism is by nature predatory.... The imperialist policy of plunder is
 bound to lead to war....
 There has been no change whatever in this characteristic of imperialism
 since the end of World War II.... Imperialism will never change its nature
 and basic policy....
 According to Leninist theory:  "....In the era of imperialism, national
 wars waged by the colonies and semi-colonies are not only possible but also
 inevitable.... (NCNA ellipsis).  The national wars waged by the colonies a.gai.nst
 Imperialism will inevitably be a continuation of their national liberation
 policy. ".. .
 Lenin held this viewpoint:.... "Only by means of launching a proletarian
 socialist revolution, will it be possible to emancipate mankind from the
 hopeless situation caused by imperialism and the imperialist wars.  Despite
 the extreme difficulties, or possible and temporary defeat in launching the
 revolution, and the intensified resistance against the revolution, the final
 victory of the proletariat is inevitable. ".. .
 "Civil wars are also wars.  Whoever recognizes the class struggle
 cannot fail to recognize civil wars which in every class of society constitute
 the natural, and under certain conditions, inevitable continuation, development,

 and intensification of the class struggle.... To repudiate civil war, or to forget
 about it, would mean sinking into extreme opportunism and renouncing the
 socialist revolution. ".. .
 The history of the 15 postwar years also bears out more clearly than ever
 the brilliance of this scientific thesis of Lenin cited above....
 With regard to the means of realizing the transition from capitalism to
 socialism by each country, it is the internal affair of each country and
 naturally will be decided by the people of each country.  The socialist countries
 will absolutely not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.
 Revolution cannot be exported.  The inevitability of revolutions in the capitalist
 countries is an objective law of history and independent of human will.... The
 Marxist-Leninist parties do not reject peaceful means for carrying out
 revolution, but when the exploiting class uses violence against the people, the
 possibility of employing the other means has to be considered; namely, the
 transition to socialism by non-peaceful means.  The historical experience of
 mankind shows that the ruling class will not give up state power of its own
 accord....
 Precisely because the imperialist system is the source of modern wars
 and the imperialist forces of war headed by the United States are daily creating
 dangers of war, the people of the whole world must assume the obligation of
 struggling for peace....
 In the colonial and semi-colonial countries, the unswerving struggles of
 the broad masses of oppressed people for complete national independence and
 against the old and new forms of colonialism constitute an important,
 indispensable force in the peace movement....
 Even though imperialism does not unleash a world war, it may start
 localized wars in certain areas when opportunities come up... .
 We must maintain the highest possible vigilance against the dangers of
 war created by imperialism.  Just as was pointed out in the Moscow conference
 declaration:  "As long as there is imperialism, there will be soil for
 unleashing wars of aggression. ".. .
 But should we be afraid if the war maniacs, against the will of the
 people of the world, unleash a war?  Comrade Mao Tse-tung has given a
 Marxist-Leninist reply:  ... "We stand resolutely for peace and oppose war.
 But if the imperialists insist on unleashing another war, we should not be
 afraid of it.  Our attitude on this question is the same as our attitude toward

 all 'disturbances':  (1) we are against it; (2) we are not afraid of it.  World War I
 was followed by the birth of the Soviet Union with a population of 200 million.
 World War II was followed by the emergence of the socialist camp with a
 combined population of 900 million.  If the imperialists should insist on
 launching a third world war, it is certain that several hundred million more
 will turn to socialism.  Then there will not be much room left in the world
 for the imperialists, while it is quite likely that the whole structure of
 imperialism will utterly collapse. "  ....

 II.      Peking, NCNA, Radioteletype in English to Europe and Asia,
 April 19, 1960, "Long Live Leninism! ", article in "current
 issue" (15 April) of Red Flag:
 ... The proletariat should use revolutionary means to seize state power,.
 smash the military and bureaucratic machinery of the bourgeoisie, and establish
 a proletarian dictatorship to replace the bourgeois dictatorship.... It is
 precisely this fundamental question which forms the dividing line between
 Marxists on the one hand and opportunists and revisionists on the other....
 Lenin asserted that... the emancipation of the proletariat can only come
 by the road of revolution, and certainly not by the road of reformism.   .. The
 socialist countries should maintain constant  vigilance against the danger of
 imperialist attacks and do their best to guard against this danger. , . .
 Without proletarian dictatorship... no socialism is possible, no victory
 of socialism is possible.
 Lenin considered it of prime importance that the proletariat should
 establish. , . a communist party--if the proletarian revolution is to be carried
 out and the proletarian dictatorship realized and consolidated....  Its program
 is to organize the proletariat and all oppressed working people for class
 struggle, to set up proletarian rule, and to pass through socialism to reach
 the final goal of communism....
 On the whole the storm of the national liberation movement is sweeping
 over Asia, Africa, and Latin America on a daily-increasing scale....
 The present world situation has obviously undergone tremendous changes
 since Lenin's lifetime, but these changes have not proved the obsolescence of
 Leninism; instead, they have more and more clearly confirmed the truths..,
 The modern revisionists represented by Tito advance a revision of the
 teachings of Lenin (that is, modern Marxist teachings) in keeping with the
 needs of the imperialists....  Marxist-Leninists must... further arouse the
 revolutionary will of the masses of people....
 There are different types of countries with social systems r~naamo?t ~1Z
 different in nature.  One type belongs to the world socialist system, the other
 to the world capitalist system. , . .
 Lenin... came to the conclusion that the hope of humanity lay entirely with
 the victory of the proletariat and that the proletariat must prepare itself to win

 victory in this great revolutionary battle and establish proletarian dictator-
 ship....
 We are always struggling against imperialist war, for the banning of
 atomic and nuclear weapons, and for the defense of world peace... .
 If, however, we lose our vigilance against the danger of the imperialists'
 launching a war, and do not work to arouse the people of all countries to rise
 up against imperialism but tie the hands of the people, then imperialism can
 prepare for war just as it pleases and the inevitable result will be an increase
 in the danger of the imperialists' launching a war.  And, once war breaks out,
 the people may not be able quickly to adopt a correct attitude towards war
 because of complete lack of preparation or inadequate preparation, and thus
 will be unable to vigorously check the war....
 As long as the people of all countries raise their awareness and are fully
 prepared, with the socialist camp also making modern weapons, it can be
 definitely stated that if the United States or other imperialists refuse to reach
 an agreement on the banning of atomic and nuclear weapons and should dare to
 fly in the face of the will of all humanity by launching a war using atomic and
 nuclear weapons, the result will be the very speedy destruction of those
 monsters....  And the result will certainly not be annihilation of mankind... .
 On the debris of a dead imperialism, the victorious people would create
 with extreme rapidity a civilization thousands of times higher than the capitalist
 system and a truly beautiful future for themselves....
 The capitalist -imperialist system absolutely will not crumble of itself.
 It will be pushed over by the proletarian revolution within the imperialist
 country concerned, and the national revolution in the colonial and semi-coloni.al
 countries....
 Lenin tells us that we must draw a distinction between two types of states
 different in nature, the state of bourgeois dictatorship and the state of
 proletarian dictatorship, and between two types of violence different in nature,
 counter-revolutionary violence and revolutionary violence; as long as there is
 counter-revolutionary violence, there is bound to be revolutionary violence to
 oppose it.  It would be impossible to wipe out counter-revolutionary violence
 without revolutionary violence.  The state in which the exploiting classes are in
 power is a counter-revolutionary violence, a special i,.%rce which rap.resents the
 exploiting classes in suppr4assirig the exploited classes.

 ... Even if it is compelled not to use these new weapons, the imperialist
 state will of course still remain an imperialist institution of violence until it
 is overthrown and replaced by the people's state--the state of the dictatorship
 of the proletariat of the country... .
 Lenin... said:  "Socialism cannot achieve victory simultaneously in all
 countries.  It will achieve victory first in one or several countries, while the
 others will remain bourgeois or pre-bourgeois for some time. " ....
 The foreign policy of socialist countries can only be a policy of peace... .
 The socialist system determines that we do not need war, absolutely would not
 start a war, and absolutely must not, should not, and could not encroach one
 inch on the territory of a neighboring country.  Ever since its founding, the
 People's Republic of China has adhered to a foreign policy of peace.  Our
 country, together with two neighboring countries, India and Burma, jointly
 initiated the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; and at the
 Bandung conference of 1955 our country, together with various countries of
 Asia and Africa, adopted the 10 Principles of Peaceful Coexistence... .
 So long as there is a continuous development of these mighty forces, it
 is possible to maintain the situation of peaceful coexistence, or even to obtain
 some sort of official agreement on peaceful coexistence or to conclude an
 agreement on prohibition of atomic and nuclear weapons....  However, under
 these circumstances as long as the imperialist system still exists, the most
 acute form of violence- --namely, war---has by no means ended in the world.
 We believe in the absolute correctness of Lenin's thinking: War is an inevitable
 outcome of exploiting systems, and the source of modern wars is the imperialist

 All types of war represent the continuation of the policies of definite
 classes.  Marxism-Leninism absolutely must not sink into the mire of
 bourgeois pacifism....
 As Lenin put it, "Theoretically, it would be quite wrong to forget that
 every war is but the continuation of politics by other means. " ... The
 proletariat and the people of all countries must also use two tactics to counter
 the imperialists:  the tactic of thoronghly exposing the imperialists' peace
 .rand and striving energetically for a genuine world peace, and the tactic of
 preparing for a just war to end the unjust war when and if the imperialists
 should unleash it....

 Peaceful coexistence between nations and people's revolutions in various
 countries are by nature two different things, not the same thing;... Peaceful
 coexistence refers to relations between different nations; revolution means the
 overthrow of the oppressors as a class by the oppressed people within a

 We are Marxist-Leninists.  We have always considered that the question
 of revolution is a nation's own affair....  Revolution can neither by exported

 arrying out a revolution, nor can one manufacture a revolution in a foreign

 remains irrefutable and the facts are confirming its correctness more and more.
 Really, if the proletariat of any country fails to realize this, it will not find
 the way to liberation.  In "The State and Revolution" Lenin focused the problem
 of revolution on the smashing of the bourgeois state machinery.  He quoted the
 most important passages from Marx's "Civil War in France:... " ... the first
 decree of the commune.. was the suppression of the standing army, and the
 substitution for it of the armed people... " (Ellipsis by NCNA)....
 The declaration of the Moscow meeting of the representatives of the
 communist and workers parties of the socialist countries of November 1957
 states:  "Leninism teaches, and experience confirms, that the ruling classes
 never relinquish power voluntarily.  In this case the bitterness and forms of
 the class struggle will depend not so much on the proletariat as on the
 resistance put up by the reactionary circles to the will of the overwhelming
 majority of the people, on these circles using force at one or another stage
 of the struggle for socialism. " ....
 The proletariat must never allow itself to one-sidedly and groundlessly
 base its thinking, policy, and its whole work on the calculation that the
 bourgeoisie is willing to accept peaceful transformation.  It must, at the same
 time, make two preparations: one for the peaceful development of the revolution
 and the other for the non-peaceful development of the revolution.  Whether the
 transition will be carried out through armed uprising or by peaceful means is a
 question that differs categorically from that of peaceful coexistence between
 the socialist and capitalist countries; it is an internal affair of each country,
 one to be determined only by the relative strength of the classes in that country
 in a given period; a matter to be decided only by the communists themselves of
 that country....
 Lenin held that every proletarian party should make use of every possible
 opportunity to participate in necessary parliamentary struggles....  Why is it
 necessary to engage in parliamentary struggle? ... "Precisely for the purpose
 of educating the backward strata of its own class, precisely for the purpose
 of awakening and enlightening the undeveloped, downtrodden, ignorant, rural
 masses. " ... In other words, it is to enhance the political and ideological level
 of the masses, to coordinate parliamentary struggle with the revolutionary
 struggle, and not to lower our political and ideological standards and divorce
 parliamentary struggle from the revolutionary struggle.  We must identify
 ourselves with the masses without lowering our revolutionary standards--this
 is a fundamental principle which Lenin taught us that we must adhere to in our
 struggle.
 We shall take part in parliamentary struggles, but we should not have any
 illusions about the bourgeois parliamentary system.  Why?  Because so long as

 tho state machinery of the bourgeois warlords and bureaucrats remains
 unchanged, parliament will remain an ornament of the bourgeois dictatorship
 even if the working-class party commands ?amajority in parliament or becomes
 the biggest party in it.... It is, therefore, difficult to imagine that changes will
 take place in a bourgeois dictatorship itself on account of votes in parliament,
 and it is just as difficult to imagine that it is possible for the proletariat to
 adopt measures in parliament for a peaceful transition to socialism just
 because it has won a certain number of votes.  A number of experiences in
 capitalist countries long ago proved this point fully arxd the experiences in
 various European and Asian countries after World War II provide fresh proofs
 of it.
 Lenin said:  "The proletariat cannot be victorious unless it wins over to
 its side the majority of the population,  But to limit or condition this to the
 gathering of a majority of votes at elections while the bourgeoisie remains
 dominant is the most utter stupidity or simply swindling the workers. " ... .
 Lowering revolutionary standards means lowering the theoretical standard
 of Marxism-Leninism.  It means lowering political struggles to the level of
 economic ones and reducing revolutionary struggles to within the limits of
 parliamentary struggles.  It means bargaining principles to achieve temporary
 benefits... .
 The proletariat in any country, if it wants to gain v4ctory in the revolutio
 must have a genuinely Marxist-Leninist party which is good at integrating the
 'Aniversal truths of Marxism-Leninism with concrete revolutionary practice in
 Its own country, correctly determining whom the revolution should be directed
 against at different periods, settling the question of organizing the main force
 and its allies and the question of whom it should rely on and unite with....  If
 it fails to do so, the proletariat will not be able to achieve its purpose of
 gaining victory in the revolution at different periods.  The modern revisior.:i3ts
 and certain representatives of the bourgeoisie try to make people believe that
 it is possible to achieve socialism without a revolutionary party of the
 proletariat and without the series of correct policies of the revolutionary party
 of the proletariat mentioned above.  This is sheer nonsense and pure
 deception... .
 Now, as a result of the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the decay of the
 capitalist system, more and more of the mass of the people in various
 countries are aspiring to socialism and more so-called socialism of different
 shades has emerged from among the exploiting classes in certain countries... .

 longer necessary, or that there is no longer any difference in principle
 between communists and social democrats.  This is tantamount to lowering the
 ideological and political standards of communists to those of the bourgeoisie
 and social democrats.  Those who make such statements have been influenced
 by modern revisionism and have departed from the positions of Marxism-

 The struggle for peace and the struggle for socialism are two different
 kinds of struggle.  It is a mistake not to draw a proper distinction between
 these two kinds of struggle....  We communists are struggling for the defense

 Meanwhile we support the revolutionary wars of the oppressed nations against
 imperialism... because all revolutionary wars are just wars... .

 April 21, 1960, "Forward, Along the Path of the Great
 Lenin! in People's Daily article in commemoration of Lenin's
 90th birthday.
 ... Lenin pointed out:... the state is a machine for the violence of class
 rule, the protetariat must use revolutionary violence to overthrow . counter-
 revolutionary violence, smash the bourgeois warlord-bureaucrat state
 machinery, and set up a new state of the proletarian dictatorship....
 The many victories won by Marxism-Leninism all over the world and in
 China have made it increasingly clear that the truth of Marxism-Leninism is
 invincible, and that it is the guide to action for all the world's oppressed
 classes and oppressed people to use in winning liberation and for the people
 throughout the world to use in marching towards socialism and communism....
 The east wind is prevailing over the west wind....  This new condition has
 brought unprecedented confidence and courage to all the world's peace-loving
 forces, all the anti-imperialist and anti-aggressive forces.  But this does not
 in the least mean that this change in the relationship of forces has changed the
 nature of imperialism and therefore altogether eliminated the possibility of
 any war from the life of modern society so that mankind has already entered an
 epoch of lasting peace.  Leninism has always held that imperialism is the sourcL
 of modern war.... The Moscow meeting of communist and workers parties held
 a little over two years ago adduced the latest facts to substantiate this principle
 of Lenin's.  The declaration of the Moscow meeting said:  "So long as
 imperialism exists there will always be soil for aggressive wars.... The peace
 forces are legion.  They can prevent war and safeguard peace.  However, we,
 the communists, believe that it is our duty to warn all the people of the world
 that the danger of a monstrous and annihilating war has not passed.... Peace
 can be preserved only if all to whom it is dear combine their forces, sharpen
 their vigilance in relation to the machinations of the war instigators, and become
 fully conscious that their sacred duty is to intensify the struggle for peace,
 which is threatened. "....
 The socialist countries, of course, never interfere in the internal affairs
 of any other countries, including the imperialist countries....
 While imperialism survives and continues to pursue its policies of
 aggression, oppression, and plunder by means of violence, the socialist
 countries always adopt an attitude of sympathy and support for the oppressed
 nations and exploited people in their resistance struggle.  Because their
 struggle represents the will of the people, weakens the imperialist forces, and
 is favorable to world peace, is it not extremely absurb to think that the
 development of this struggle and the support extended .to it are unfavorable to
 peace?....

 22 April 1960, "Get United Under Lenin's Revolutionary
 Banner ! ", report delivered 22 April by LU Ting-i,
 alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central
 Committee of the CCP, at the meeting to commemorate
 the 90th anniversary of the birth of Lenin:
 ... The special characteristic, the essence, of Leninism lies in its
 thorough proletarian revolutionary character.  Leninism not only wholly
 revived the revolutionary content of Marxism, which had been emasculated by
 the revisionists of the Second International, and restored the revolutionary
 keenness of Marxism once dulled by them, but further developed the
 revolutionary content and sharpened the revolutionary keenness of Marxism in
 the light of new historical experience under new historical conditions....
 In the epoch of imperialism... contradictions can be resolved only by
 revolutions....
 The revolutionary spirit of Leninism has its outstanding expression in the
 doctrine of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship....  Lenin
 repeatedly pointed out that the proletarian revolution must smash the
 bourgeois state machinery and replace it with the dictatorship of the proletariat.
 He said:  "The latter (the bourgeois state) cannot be superseded by the
 proletarian state (the dictatorship of the proletariat) in the process of
 withering away; as a general rule, this can happen only by means of a violent
 revolution. ... "
 Without the proletarian dictatorship there can be no victory of socialism. .
 Lenin brilliantly applied and developed the Marxist idea of uninterrupted
 revolution, regarding it as a fundamental guiding principle of the proletarian
 revolution.  Lenin set forth the principle that the proletariat should obtain the
 leadership in the bourgeois democratic revolution and transform the bourgeois
 democratic revolution without interruption into the socialist revolution.  Lenin
 further pointed out that the socialist revolution is not the final goal and that it
 is necessary to continue advancing to accomplish the transition to the higher
 stage of communism....  "In the last analysis, the outcome of the struggle will
 be determined by the fact that Russia, India, China, and so forth account for the
 overwhelming majority of the population of the globe....  In this sense, the
 complete victory of socialism is fully and absolutely assured. " ... .

 Our party twice cooperated and twice split with the Kuomintang- -political
 party of the bourgeoisie- -and therefore has extremely rich experience on the
 question of uniting with and struggling against the bourgeoisie.  Our party has
 rich experience not only in armed struggle but in peaceful struggle as well.
 The ideas of the proletariat's grasping leadership in the bourgeois democratic
 revolution, of the proletariat's leading the peasant masses to carry out a
 thorough democratic revolution, of the democratic revolution as a peasant war
 and an agrarian revolution, and of uninterrupted revolution in turning the
 democratic revolution into a socialist revolution, as expounded by Lenin, were
 correctly and concretely applied by the CCP under the leadership of Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung. .. , .
 The Marxist- Leninists regard this as an unprecedentedly favorable new
 epoch for the proletarian revolution in the countries of the world and for the
 national revolution in the colonies and semi-colonies....  The people of the
 whole world must further intensify the struggle against imperialism, promote
 the development of revolution, and defend world peace... .
 Whether we should carry out revolution and whether we should oppose
 imperialism have become matters of fundamental difference between the
 Marxist- Leninists and the modern revisionists....
 Marxist- Leninists have always maintained that in revolutionary struggle
 there should be firmness in principle and flexibility in tactics.  All the means
 of revolution and forms of struggle, including the illegal and the "legal, "
 extraparliamentary and parliamentary, sanguinary and bloodless, economic
 and political, military and ideological- -all these are for the purpose of
 unmasking the imperialists to a fuller extent, exposing their aggressive features
 constantly raising the revolutionary consciousness of the people, achieving
 broader mobilization of the masses of people to oppose the imperialists and
 reactionaries, developing the struggle for world peace, and preparing for and
 winning victory in the people's revolution and the national revolution....
 In the struggle against imperialism and its policy of aggression, it is
 entirely permissible and necessary, and in the interests of the people of
 various countries that, wherever possible, the socialist countries conduct
 peaceful negotiations and exchange visits with the imperialist countries, strive
 to settle international disputes by peaceful means instead of war, and endeavor
 to sign agreements of peaceful coexistence or treaties of non-aggression....
 We combat dogmatism in order to push ahead the revolution and overthrow
 the enemy.  Modern revisionists are doing just the opposite.  Opposition to
 dogmatism is for them only a pretext under which they oppose revolution,

 formulations on individual questions may change with the passage of time
 and changes in the situation, but its revolutionary spirit is absolutely
 unchangeable.  Revolution is the locomotive of history, the motive force of man's
 social progress... .
 U. S. imperialism is the last pillar of international imperialism.    If the
 proletariat in the capitalist countries is to win emancipation, if the people of the
 colonies and semi-colonies are to obtain national liberation, if the people of the
 world are to safeguard world peace, the spearhead of the struggle must be
 directed against U. S. imperialism....
 No force on earth can hinder or restrain the colonial and semi-colonial
 peoples from rising in revolution and smashing the yoke they are under.  Their
 revolutionary struggles play the role of shaking the foundation of the imperialist
 system.  All revolutionary Marxist- Leninists should support these just struggles
 resolutely and without the slightest reservation.  Similarly, no force on earth
 can hinder or restrain the proletariat, and working people in the capitalist
 countries from rising in revolution to overthrow the reactionary rule of
 monopoly capital. .... All revolutionary Marxist-Leninists should likewise
 support these just struggles, resolutely and without the slightest reservation....
 Lenin maintained that the proletariat in the socialist countries must...
 support the continuous advance of the cause of proletarian revolution in other
 countries. . . until capitalism has perished and socialism has triumphed through-
 out the world....
 "Modern revisionists... deny the historical necessity for a proletarian

 it to be extending aid to any liberated people which are not members of the

 Appreciating this, the USSR develops its economic cooperation with them
 accordingly....
 There are bold publicists in the West who assert that Lenin was
 allegedly an opponent of the peaceful coexistence of the two systems... ,
 However, these gentlemen are carefully passing in silence over all Lenin's
 policies during the first peaceful years of the Soviet regime.... The principle
 of peaceful coexistence both then and now lies at the basis of the entire Soviet
 foreign policy.... Of decisive significance was the conclusion of the 20th and
 21st party congresses concerning the absence of any fatal inevitability of wars
 in our epoch, concerning the possibility for avoiding war,  In drawing such
 conclusion the party has made a new contribution to Marxism... .

 old truth that imperialism is aggressive.... A dogmatic position is an obsolete
 position.... The insistent and enterprising system of the Soviet Government has

 There appears, side by side with the enemies of peace, sober-thinking

 240.  Trotsky's Assassin
 On 6 May 1960 Ramon Mercader, alias Jacques Mornard, alias Frank
 Jacson etc. was released by the Mexican government from his 20-year prison
 sentence which was to expire on 20 August 1960. This individual, convicted of
 killing Leon Trotsky on ZO August 1940, was taken in charge by two Czech officials
 at the airport. After a week's stopover in Cuba he was to be offered asylum in
 Prague, where he would be safe against revenge by Trotsky followers. The story
 which led to the assassination of Trotsky has been effectively told in The Mind of
 an Assassin by Isaac Don Levine, and covered by Life magazine of 28 September
 1959. The early release of the murderer, the confusion over his identity and his
 disappearance behind the iron curtain are all elements of the efforts made by the
 Soviets to avoid publicity over this hired assassin of the Stalin regime. Mercader
 was born in Barcelona on 7 February 1914. His mother, Caridad Mercader, born
 in Cuba in 1892, played an important part in the Spanish Civil War as a sort of
 junior Pasionaria and in the Soviet international underground. To friends she
 would describe how Maurice Thorez, Jacques Duclos and other Communist
 leaders looked in the nude; for many years she was the mistress of Leonid
 Eitingon, a high officer in the NKVD who trained special agents in assassination.
 He was Mercaderts teacher and later trained Nikolay Khokhlov, sent to kill the
 leader of the NTS in Frankfurt (Khokhlov refused to carry out his assignment and
 defected). Mercader, pretending to be a Trotskyite, infiltrated the home of the
 exiled Soviet leader to carry out his mission. When arrested, he was carrying a
 false biography in the name of Jacques Mornard Vandendreschd, allegedly the son
 of a Belgian diplomat. He confessed to his crime but not to his real identity. He
 claimed that he killed Trotsky because the latter wanted to send him to the USSR
 to subvert Stalin's regime. The dual identity of Ramon Mercader and Jacques
 Mornard was established by the Mexican police through fingerprinting. Jaime
 Ramon Mercader del Rio had been arrested in Barcelona on 12 June 1935 and had
 been in prison in Madrid. Khokhlov, after his defection, testified that he knew of
 a Spaniard, trained in Moscow, who was sent to Mexico under the name of
 Mornard. Ramon Mercader's mother, now living in Paris, was decorated with the
 Order of Lenin in 1940 for her part in liquidating that "dangerous enemy of the
 people" and given for safekeeping, until his release, the Order of the Hero of the
 Soviet Union for her son. She showed this decoration to Enrique Castro Delgado,
 the Spanish representative of the Comintern in Moscow who later broke with the
 Communist party. Mercader was refused parole because he never felt any
 repentance for his crime. On the contrary, he was proud of it, convinced, he said,
 that the death of Trotsky was of benefit to the working class. He has been
 described as a "trained political assassin who takes pride in his proficiency",     25X1C
 "a soulless monster", "the Kremlin's harrnv robot of the future".
