 PROCEEDINGS. AND DEBATES OF THE 88th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION
 WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JUNE 19, 1964
 House of Representatives
 The House met at 12 o'clock noon.
 The Chaplain, Rev. Bernard Braskamp,
 D.D,, offered the following prayer:
 Philippians 4: 19: But my God shall
 supply all your need according to His
 riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
 Eternal Gott, our     er, who art ac-
 quainted with our many needs and canst
 supply them all, give us the faith that
 trusts and commits- itself humbly and
 heroically to Thy guidance in these con-
 fused and troubled times.
 Grant that the leaders and Members
 of this legislative body may be endowed
 with that wisdom which will enable them
 to bring to fulfillment all those noble
 aspirations which Thou hast planted
 within the soul of humanity.
 Show us.how we may banish from the
 mind and heart of man those attitudes
 which are alien to the spirit of our blessed
 Lord and at variance with His teachings
 of the Sermon on the Mount and the
 Golden Rule.
 Hear us in His name.  Amen,

 All of the students in the group donated
 blood except Scott Wilson, 16, of San Fran-
 cisco, who was under the minimum donor's
 age.   He called Communist Cuba "a won-
 derfel thing."
 Judy Chessman, of New York, who said she
 was a City College student, said her blood
 donation  was in gratitude  to  the  Cuban
 people.
 Mr. Lemanski made this statement
 when he arrived in Cuba in a radio in-
 terview.

 CONGRESSIO]4AiL RECOIW - ETOUSE
 I am not suggesting, Mr.' Chairman, that
 the Committee for Nonviolent Action Is a
 Conimunist-front or Communist-sympathetic
 organization. 'Its leader is a Dr. A. J. Muste
 who is reportedly the world's leading pacifist.
 The fact of the matter is, and as their
 behavior has well illustrated, organizations
 such as the Committee for Nonviolent Action
 are rapidly infiltrated by Communists and
 the goals of the committee are soon subverted
 to serve the ends of the Communist move-
 ment.
 In addition,, assuming these people are
 completely divorced from any Communist
 Influence, the inability of the United States
 to protect them when they are in Cuba
 or Red China Is reason enough to prevent
 them from, going to these countries In the
 first, place.
 One member of the Permanent Students
 Committee for Travel to Cuba, while in Cuba
 last summer, mysteriously drowned In a ho-
 tel swimming pool. There have been per-
 sistent reports that he openly 'voiced his
 disillusionment with the Castro dictatorship
 and was murdered.
 This brings us, Mr. Chairman, to the re-
 cent announced arrival of 75 U.S. citizens
 in Cuba. These people, members of the same
 organization that went to Cuba last sum-
 mer, the Student Committee for Travel to
 Cuba, entered tuba through Prague.  The
 group's arrival in Cuba came as a complete
 surprise to our State Department, some-
 thing thing that I find hard to believe.
 Certainly it is unusual for 75 people who
 request visas to Prague to escape detection.
 The group now in Cuba Is led by Ed Le-
 mansky, a self-admitted Communist.
 On the day of his arrival in Cuba, in a
 radio interview, Lemansky said that: "The
 U.S. Government fears that those who re-
 turn to the United States will tell publicly
 the truth about what goes on in Cuba. They
 think that if the people learn the truth
 about the Cuban revolution, the workers
 particularly will` throw themselves into a
 struggle to attain socialism."
 Apparently Mr. Lemansky knows what the
 truth is before seeing conditions in `Cuba
 although viewing conditions is their ostensi-
 ble purpose for going to Cuba in the first
 Describing the Cuban revolution as "the
 beautiful -thing  that is taking. place in
 Cuba," the students said that when they
 returned to this country they will spread
 the truth.
 That this illegal trip was planned for some
 time is revealed by the letter from the Stu-
 dent, Committee  for Travel to  Cuba of
 June 1, 1964.
 I do not believe, Mr. Chairman, that one
 need stretch his Imagination to see what is
 `going on.  The Communists, expert on in,
 filtrating well-meaning but misguided stu.-
 dent groups, are intent on keeping the door
 open for travel to Cuba and other nations
 which it is against our national interests to
 recognize and to allow American citizens to
 travel to.
 While waging their war of propaganda for
 the minds of our youth, they have also suc-
 ceeded in exhibiting that the immigration
 laws presently on the books are inadequate
 to prevent travel to these countries.
 The bil1T wish-to testify in behalf of today
 I offer in: the nature of,n,substitute to amend
 the Immigration and Nationality Act to au-
 thorize,_ in the national Interest, restrictions
 on travel by nationals of-the United States
 in certain ;designated areas of the world.
 It was over a year ago that I introduced a
 bill, (April 1, 1963, II.R. 6320)  which em-
 braced as Its objective the upholding of the
 sovereign's interests in imposing restrictions
 and' prohibitions on travel to or transit
 through any country with which the United
 States does not maintain diplomatic rela-
 tions, or has canceled or suspended such
 ielations,.
 In the Interim, I have had time for reflec-
 tion upon the cases In which Communists
 and those who would oppose normal proce-
 dures with reference to passports have at-
 tacked and blocked and evaded the authority
 and prerogatives of our country in control-
 ling transit Into troubled spots on our hemi-
 sphere and throughout the world.
 I have been seriously concerned, Mr. Chair-
 man, about the fact that "in the last analysis
 this power rests upon the right  of  self-
 preservation,  the  ultimate  value                                                                           of any
 society"  (and I quote from the Supreme
 Court opinion In Barenblatt back in 1959,
 360 U.S. 109). There appeared there a sensi-
 tive regard, to my mind, for the right of
 our country to exercise vigilance and to
 exercise it effectively. .
 Alleged loopholes coupled with an inordi=
 hate stress upon the rights of an individual
 to come and go as he pleases even in conflict
 with his country's best interests have made
 it imperative that we adopt legislation that
 will close the loopholes opened by techni-
 calities and put the stress where it belongs
 * * * upon the right of self-preservation of
 the United States properly balanced with a
 maximum right" of travel not inconsistent
 therewith.
 I have had the advantage of ruminating
 over these points with constitutional law
 lawyers and I want to capitalize upon their
 recommendations and my own experience
 in studying cases. My present best judgment
 as to how we should proceed is embodied
 in the bill I first offered and in the substitute
 amendment I offer. '
 The expression of legislative Intent in
 crystal-clear terms is needed.  The Supreme
 Court has referred to "the right to travel,"
 though without defining this "right" in any
 clear way.  But the Supreme Court's own
 holdings make it clear that there is no abso-
 lute right to travel and we can work within
 the doctrine of the cases.
 My new draft, offered here in conjunc-
 tion with my original bill, will operate to
 separate passport questions from the prob-
 lem                                                                of controlling U.S.  nationals  as  our
 national interest may require.
 By separating travel restrictions from any
 passport question, we can remove any possi-
 bility of a successful constitutional attack
 on refusal  of a passport to  a subversive
 person.
 The control of passports can again become,
 as it should be, a matter for executive dis-
 cretion.  Passports can be regarded once
 more as cards of accommodation and en-
 dorsement Issued by the State Department to
 worthy U.S. citizens but limited as the na-
 tional interest requires with adequate pen-
 alties to protect those interests when illegal
 travel occurs.
 My proposal calls for regulation of travel,
 in the national interest, by the executive
 branch, under specific authorization by Con-
 gress.
 It would be impossible to set up, by act of
 Congress, a scheme of operation which would
 envision  all  possible  contingencies  where
 the  national  interest,  in  the conduct  of
 foreign affairs, might require travel restric-
 tions.  Furthermore, I have come to the con-
 clusion                                                                         that a  congressional  attempt,   as
 originally proposed, to ban all travel behind
 the Iron Curtain and in countries not within
 our favor from time to time is susceptible
 to attack in our courts possibly on grounds
 of arbitrariness * * * it could be argued with
 some force that such a rigid ban fails to
 take into account all conditions at all times,
 for example, the right of a newspaperman
 to "get a story."
 Such a complete ban would not solve the
 problem with respect to Iron Curtain coun-
 tries with which we do maintain diplomatic
 relations and is so rigid it might even inter-
 fere with travel of our own diplomats.
 We focus here upon the right of the Gov-
 ernment, in the national interest and in the
 13903
 conduct of foreign affairs, to supersede the
 travel desires of an individual when there
 is conflict between the two.
 The type of statutory operation which I
 propose must pass the test of due process.
 My bill does this.  The right of travel, as I
 have pointed out, is not an absolute right,
 but is a relative right, one that may be sub-
 ordinate to the national Interest.
 The findings of the Congress, as set forth
 in this bill, and the Secretary of State's
 findings in specific cases, resting on the con-
 stitutional power of the President in con-
 trolling all foreign affairs, fulfill all the re-
 quirements of due process.
 Let me implement this reasoning by quot-
 ing from the law authorities.
 Chief Judge  Prettyman' in the  William
 Worthy case in 1959 (270 F. 2d 905) treated
 of the Secretary of State's general policy
 (which I now wish to implement) of refus-
 ing Goverment sanction to travel by U.S.
 citizens in certain areas of the world, pre-
 sumably  under  Communist  control  and
 deemed by him to be trouble spots.
 Said the Chief Judge:
 "Liberty itself Is inherently a restricted
 thing.  Liberty is a product of order. There
 is no liberty in anarchy or in chaos. Liberty
 is achieved by rules, which correlate every
 man's actions to every other man's rights
 and thus, by mutual restrictions one upon
 the other, achieve a result of relative free-
 dom.  The mere day-to-day maintenance of
 the order which insures liberty requires re-
 strictions upon individual rights.  Some ac-
 tions, neither harmful nor potentially dan-
 gerous, must be restricted simply for the
 sake of good order in the community."
 The circuit court of appeals concluded that
 the right to travel, like every other form of
 liberty,  Is, In our concept of an ordered
 society, subject to restrictions under some
 circumstances and for some reasons. Worthy
 was tried on his attempt to return to the
 United States without a passport.
 The chief judge pointed out in that same
 case a potent reason why the bill I now in-
 troduce is so needed.  The presence of Amer-
 ican citizens in trouble spots on the earth's
 surface and the official approval of their
 presence in those areas will impede the exe-
 cution of American foreign policy In relation
 both to these countries and to other coun-
 tries.
 By requiring a formal finding by the Sec-
 retary of State  (subject always, of course,
 to Presidential control)  and providing for
 publication of this finding and specific reg-
 ulatory determination of travel controls, my
 bill meets the due process test.  By reserv-
 ing a measure of discretion to the Secretary,
 it retains essential flexibility.
 A key criterion of the validity, legality, and
 constitutionality of the bill now introduced
 Is to be found in the 14th paragraph of the
 syllabus of the February 20, 1964, decision of
 the Circuit Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit,
 238 F. 2d 386.  This court, while upsetting
 Worthy's  conviction  of existing passport
 laws, concluded, however, that:
 "Right of foreign travel may not be arbi-
 trarily or unreasonably restrained but is not
 an absolute right, and right of Congress to
 require passports and to impose reasonable
 restrictions is not dependent on existence
 of state of war but may be exercised under
 broad power to enact legislation for regula-
 tion of foreign affairs."
 The circuit court was speaking in the sec-
 ond William Worthy case and stated in its
 15th paragraph of syllabus:
 "Congress may punish violations of stat-
 utes imposing restrictions on right of citizens
 to travel in foreign countries."
 Examination of my new bill will disclose,
 I am sure, that it embraces the very cri-
 teria of the courts themselves.
 The initial bill, H.R. 5320 Intends to add
 strength  to section  125(a)(b)  by making
 it a crime to falsely state In an application
 Approved For Release 2005/01/27  CIA-RDP66B00403R000200170051-4
 13904
 to depart or to falsely state at the time
 of his entry that he intends to travel or
 upon return that he has traveled to a re-
 stricted country and also to make it a crime
 to actually travel to any country with which
 the United States doesn't maintain diplo-
 matic relations.
 This bill is limited to national emergen-
 cies and to countries with -which the United
 States does not maintain diplomatic rela-
 tions.
 H.R. 11603 is Intended to supplement H.R.
 5320, particularly in view of the court de-
 cisions and the difficulty of proof involved.
 Itdoes notrequire the declaration of a na-
 tional emergency, nor does It require that
 recognition be withdrawn in order to be
 operative.  Thus, it gives the Secretary of
 State. obviously after consultation with the
 President, the power to determine countries
 or areas to which travel is restricted In the
 national interest and makes the actual travel
 there itself a crime.  This avoids the con-
 stitutional and, as the Worthy case proves,
 the almost impossible proof burden of the
 intent existing before the party leaves the
 country.  In the Worthy case, apparently
 the Justice Department chose to rely on the
 reentry rather than the leaving the country
 count because of the difficulty in proving
 intent to visit another country upon leaving.
 Thus, I believe that a combination of the
 two bills that I babe introduced will serve the
 best interests of the 'United States and still
 not unduly restrict travel or raise unneces-
 sary constitutional "freedom of travel" ques-
 tions.

 spears and witch-doctor charms-have made
 a laughing stock of the military establish-
 ment that Is supposed to uphold Premier
 Adoula's "central government" in Leopold-
 ville.
 This is a bleak fact of depressing impor-
 tance.  The Congolese army is such a com-
 pletely mushy and uncertain thing, and It is
 so incompetently officered, that the future
 of the Congo seems to promise little more
 than bloody tribal warfare and anarchy-a
 period of turbulence and torment inviting
 a Communist takeover.  The danger is both
 real  and present.   The United Nations is
 scheduled to withdraw all its forces from
 the country by the end of the month.  What
 will be left then to hold the country to-
 gether to keep provinces like Kivu and Ka-
 tanga from being taken over by the "rebels"
 and put under Red control?  Certainly a
 few U.S. civilians recruited by the CIA to
 fly reconnaissance planes over the troubled
 areas would not do the trick, even if they
 were permitted to continue operations.
 There is terrible irony Involved here. The
 U.N., with the support of our Government,
 is responsible for having destroyed the only
 stable  element  in  the  Congo-President
 Tahombe's regime and its efficient army In
 Katenga. by far the richest and most orderly
 part of the convulsed former Belgian colony.
 Neither the United Nations nor the United
 States has reason to be proud of this; the
 evil consequences are still in the making.
 What will happen next? The outsider can
 do little more than hold his breath and
 guess. All one can be sure of at the moment
 is that the Congo remains, perhaps more
 than ever, a cauldron-and a prime example
 of how Independence can be a curse when
 it is imposed on a people too soon, when they
 are woefully unready for it.
 how much? This too is a sad story even
 if one assumes that the Government pro-
 gram was responsible for every bushel
 cutback in stocks.
 Figures just released show that the
 cutback in Government stocks during
 this 3-year period was only 514 million
 bushels.

 With the program cost at $2.5 billion,
 and the cutback only one-half million
 bushels, each bushel cutback cost the
 taxpayers an average of $5, or about five
 times the market value of the grain.
 Any fair evaluation of the program's
 performance must Include the effect it
 has had on livestock prices.  The Gov-
 ernment's dumping of corn in 1961 and
 1962 to get a good signup invited ab-
 normally heavy livestock feeding.  This,
 in turn, triggered today's disastrously
 low livestock prices.  The exact price-
 tag of all this is impossible to fix, but it
 can be conservatively placed at $3 billion.
 CONGO PROSPECT
 (Mrs. ST. GEORGE asked and was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute and to extend her remarks
 and include extraneous matter.)
 Mrs. ST. GEORGE.  Mr. Speaker, as
 I said 2 days ago when I inserted a letter
 from Monsieur Moise Tshombe in the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, including an edi-
 torial from the Washington Evening
 Star, I am continuing to pursue my ef-
 forts in trying to discover the truth in
 this miserable and tragic situation.
 The Star has now come out with an-
 other excellent editorial in the issue of
 the 18th of June 1964.  Mr. Speaker, I
 call particular attention to the fourth
 paragraph in which the following state-
 ment occurs:
 There is terrible irony involved here. The
 U.N., with the support of our Government.
 is responsible for having destroyed the only
 stable  element  in  the Congo-President
 Tshombe's regime and its efficient army In
 Katanga, by far the richest and most orderly
 part of the convulsed former Belgian colony.
 Neither the United Nations nor the United
 States has reason to be proud of this; the
 evil consequences are still in the making.
 This is the same Tshombe who was
 refused a visa by our State Department
 2 years ago, and would probably receive
 the same treatment today.
 CONGO PROSPECT
 It Is a melancholy fact that there is noth-
 ing optimistic or congratulatory to be said
 about the Congo Republic as It prepares to
 mark the fourth anniversary of its inde-
 pendence from Belgium.   Only  the Com-
 munists, particularly the Chinese, can find
 the prospect pleasing.
 As for the free world and the Congolese
 themselves, it is a bad prospect at beat. The
 news speaks for itself.  With the support
 of Red China's "diplomats" In the neighbor-
 ing land of Burundi, primitive "rebels"-in-

 FEED GRAINS PROGRAM
 (Mr. FINDLEY asked and was given
 permission to address the House for I
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. FINDLEY.  Mr. Speaker, the feed
 grains program, now entering its fourth
 year. is already a $2.5 billion dollar bust.
 It is too late to drop the program for
 1964, but it should not be permitted to
 plague the taxpayers beyond this year.
 According to U.S. Department of Agri-
 culture estimates, the program cost $2.5
 billion during its first 3 years, 1961-83.
 In my opinion, this Is a very conservative
 estimate.
 What did the taxpayers get for their
 money? There are two ways to evaluate
 the performance of the feed grains pro-
 gram. and either way It comes out a
 costly fizzle.
 First, did it cut back total production
 of feed grains, and If so, how much?
 Here the program worked in reverse.
 Production is up, not down. Here is the
 sad story of the three crops under the
 feed grains program, taken from U.S.
 Department of Agriculture reports:

 BRUCE SAGAN AND THE INCREAS-
 ING POWER OF THE COMMUNITY
 NEWSPAPER
 (Mr. O'HARA of Illinois asked and was
 given permission to extend his remarks
 at this point in the RECORD.)
 Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
 recently the President of the United
 States and Mrs. Johnson entertained at a
 state dinner in the White House one of
 the great royal heads of Europe. It was,
 of course, a social and state occasion of
 the first order.  Among the 100 guests
 were Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Sagan of Chi-
 cago, residents of and voters in the dis-
 trict that I have the honor to represent in
 this distinguished body. When a young
 couple is inciuded'in the limited invita-
 tion list to a state dinner at the White
 House it does not go unnoticed.  Some
 of my colleagues, who reside miles away
 from my beloved Illinois, have asked me
 who is Bruce Sagan.
 I think you will be hearing much of
 him In the future.  He is in his early
 thirties, and he is part, indeed a very
 potent part, of a new movement in our
 country, as yet unnoticed by many, that
 will mark an increasing transfer of
 journalistic influence from the large
 daily central newspapers to the com-
 munity newspapers.  Mergers of large
 newspapers in every city of the United
 States have resulted in concentrating the
 control of journalistic influence in a few
 hands.  Chicago is an illustration.  In
 former years there were many news-
 papers published in the city of Chicago.
