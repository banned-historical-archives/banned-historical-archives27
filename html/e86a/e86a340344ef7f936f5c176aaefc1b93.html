 The expanding role of intelligence in support of those who formu-
 late and execute national security policies of the United States is
 4        abundantly evident today. For an alert and effective defense, indeed,
 for its very survival, the Nation needs an adequate intelligence system.

 rides all others.  The intentions, capabilities, and vulnerabilities of
 foreign countries are becoming more and more relevant to U.S. courses
 of action, and policy decisions affecting the Nation's security rest in-
 creasingly on information provided through the machinery and proc-
 esses of national intelligence described in the following pages.

 THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
 Intelligence is collected and analyzed on many command echelons.
 An infantry company in the field conducts scouting and other obser-
 vational activities in its immediate area of operations. The command-
 ing officers of battalions, regiments, divisions, and armies similarly
 rely on intelligence-either developed by their own G-2's or received
 from other echelons-to support them in the execution of their mis-
 sions. There may at times be an unhappy duplication of activities by
 the intelligence units in the hierarchy, but the desirability of giving
 intelligence support to the operational commands at all levels is not
 seriously questioned.
 Before World War II, the highest echelon of intelligence in the
 United States was the departmental level.  Military analyses were
 produced by the War and Navy Departments and political analyses by
 the State Department to assist the respective Secretaries in the dis-
 charge of their responsibilities. Estimates produced by, say, the War
 Department did on occasion go beyond a mere review of military con-
 siderations to take in other elements of the situation as well.  For
 the character of war in the 20th century and of the tensions between
 wars called increasingly for assessments of military capabilities, not
 in isolation but in conjunction with economic strengths, state of
 scientific achievements, political intentions, and psychological vulner-
 abilities. The War Department however, was then clearly giving its
 views on matters in which other agencies might claim a greater com-
 petence, and the presumptive departmental bias of its estimates tended
 to vitiate their acceptability. There was no mechanism to provide
 the President and those who assisted him in formulating national
 policy with coordinated intelligence analyses on matters which tran-
 scended the competence of a single department-in short, with national
 intelligence.
 Approved For Release 2004/06/24:
 World War II struck hone the urgent requirement for improved
 intelligence support to those who formulated national strategy. Pearl
 Harbor was a clear failure of intelligence.  Despite the victory over
 Japan the stamp of the disaster remained indelible on the American

 Approved
 consciousness.  The Hoover Commmission in 1955 observed, "The
 CIA may well attribute its existence to the surprise attack on Pearl
 Harbor."
 Even before Pearl Harbor, the President took the initiative to
 develop the machinery for producing national intelligence. In July
 1941, the office of the Coordinator of Information was set up with
 a charter to collect and analyze strategic intelligence and furnish the
 results to the President and other agencies. The office was transformed
 after Pearl Harbor into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).
 Strategic intelligence, pertaining as it does to the capabilities, vul-
 nerabilities, and probable courses of action of foreign nations, covers
 much the same ground as national intelligence in that both types are
 commonly addressed to the top officials charged with formulating and
 executing national policy. In the strictest sense of the term, however,
 strategic intelligence can be conducted on the departmental or other
 level without being offered, like national intelligence, as the coordi-
 nated view of the intelligence community. Nevertheless OSS was a
 lineal ancestor of CIA and so a landmark in the development of the
 community for producing national intelligence. OSS made a lasting
 impact by the stimulus it gave to the use of scholarly techniques in
 intelligence analysis, although the popular literature has centered on
 the organization's more dramatic "special operations," such as the
 support of guerrilla activities behind enemy lines.  OSS recruited
 academicians by the hundreds, many of whom served as officials in
 successor intelligence agencies and were among the first to articulate
 a doctrine of intelligence to encompass the organization and activities
 of the national-intelligence community.
 OSS did not effect the interagency coordination required to dignify
 its analyses with the designation of national intelligence.  The syn-
 thesis of intelligence during the war was rather centered in the Joint
 Intelligence Committee (JIC) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  OSS
 was represented on the JIC along with the Department, of State, the
 Foreign Economic Administration, and the military services. It is
 questionable whether even the centralized intelligence performed un-
 der the JIC could strictly be called national intelligence, since its
 purpose was to support the requirements of the Joint Chiefs.
 Joint collection groups, staffed by civilians and military officers, were
 set up in the various military theaters.  The joint effort was also
 successful in bringing out a good compendium of data on terrain,
 targets, population, and other items of basic intelligence in the JANIS
 (Joint Army-Navy Intelligence Studies) compendiums. But no fully

 POSTWAR STRUCTURE
 It was widely appreciated that the wartime intelligence structure
 was makeshift, but there was widespread disagreement at the end of
 the war on the best institutional arrangements for intelligence produc-
 tion.                                                                                     In some quarters, there was advocacy of a single centralized
 agency.  Elsewhere, a centralized agency, which might increasingly
 arrogate to itself activities traditionally performed by the intelligence
 organizations within the military services, was viewed as endangering
 the fulfillment of military missions. The nature of the compromise
 finally evolved was foreshadowed in January 1946 when the President
 issued an Executive order setting up a National Intelligence Au-
 thority composed of the Secretaries of State, War, Navy, and the
 President's personal representative.  The National Intelligence Au-
 thority served in the nature of a board of directors over a Central
 Intelligence Group, which operated under two basic principles. First,
 its mission was principally to coordinate the intelligence produced in
 the various departments of the Government. Second, it was to per-
 form only those other functions which the National Intelligence
 Authority decided could best be performed centrally.
 These two principles for the production of national intelligence
 were retained by Congress when it passed the National Security Act
 of 1947 creating the Central Intelligence Agency. Perhaps even more
 important for the evolving shape of national intelligence was the
 creation, under this act, of the National Security Council (NSC). In
 the business world, there can be no sustained production of goods
 for which there is no market demand. In the Government, similarly,
 efficient services are not likely to be offered where there is no articu-
 lated demand for those services. The NSC has played an historically
 noteworthy role in making insistent demands on national intelligence,
 and the intelligence community has steadily improved its skills in
 tailoring its product to serve the needs of policymaking at the highest
 echelons. This orientation of intelligence to the requirements of na-
 tional policy has been further encouraged by the NSC's statutory
 authority over intelligence production.
 The President presides over the meetings of the NSC.  The Na-
 tional Security Act of 1947 (as later amended) prescribes four other
 statutory members : the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the.
 Secretary of Defense, and the Director of Emergency Planning-

 Nation's resources in emergency situations.  The statute permits the
 attendance of such other officials as the President desires; the regu-
 lar participation at Council meetings of the Secretary of the Treas-
 ury and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget insures that matters
 of national strategy are considered in the context of economic reali-
 ties.       In addition, the President on occasion invites other officials to
 sit in on meetings if the agenda includes items in which they have
 a special interest.  Such ad hoc participants have included the Sec-
 retary of Commerce, the Secretary of the Interior, the Ambassador
 to the United Nations, and the Director of the U.S. Information
 Agency.
 The Special Assistant to the President for National Security
 Affairs acts as executive officer for the NSC.  A key figure in keep-
 ing the White House abreast of national security problems, he pre-
 pares the agenda of Council meetings and personally briefs the
 President on NSC matters.
 Two other officials participate in Council sessions : the Chairman
 of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence.
 By statute, these are advisers rather than members of the Council.
 They present their views in their areas of competence but do not join
 in the final articulation of national policy recommendations.
 The statutory function of the National Security Council is to
 "advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic,
 foreign, and military policies."  The working style of Presidents
 varies, and the role of the NSC has varied correspondingly from
 administration to administration. President Truman did not regu-
 larly attend meetings of the NSC until the outbreak of the Korean
 War.  Under President Eisenhower, the NSC met almost weekly,
 and considerable reliance was placed on organs set up within the
 NSC to prepare formal papers defining national policy positions and
 to survey the implementation of policy by the executive agencies of
 the Government.
 These organs of the NSC were abolished under President Kennedy,
 who called on the Council as a group less frequently than did his
 predecessors.  In place of formal Council deliberations, task forces
 on specific problems are now often used to provide the White House
 with viewpoints that represent the consensus. of the participating
 departments and agencies.  The task force does not ordinarily come
 within the NSC structure : The Berlin Task Force and the Counter-
 insurgency Task Force are interagency groups that are chaired by
 State and report to the President through the Secretary of State.
 An example of an interagency task force within the Council struc-
 ture is the Executive Committee of the NSC, organized in the fall of
 Insofar as the Council must obtain the information it needs to sup-
 port its policy recommendations, the lawmakers considered it impor-
 tant to give the NSC considerable authority over the national
 intelligence process. The 1947 statute placed the Central Intelligence
 Agency under the Council.  Many of the responsibilities of CIA
 and of other intelligence organizations are set forth in directives
 issued by the NSC.  The Council has also established intelligence
 committees to coordinate certain activities within the intelligence
 community.
 THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE BOARD
 The highest ranking of these committees is the U.S. Intelligence
 Board (USIB). The USIB acts as a sort of board of review over
 the intelligence community, meeting normally once a week, oftener
 during crisis situations. The agendas of USIB meetings cover not
 merely matters of substantive intelligence but also the general prob-
 lems of administrative relationships within the intelligence commu-
 nity.  Since the heads of the various intelligence organizations are
 on the Board, the understandings reached at USIB sessions are gen-
 erally effective in achieving smoother working relationships on the
 lower echelons.
 There are six intelligence organizations represented on the USIB.
 Central Intelligence Agency.  The head of CIA is the Director of
 Central Intelligence, but his responsibilities extend beyond the
 Agency itself.  He is the senior intelligence adviser to the President,
 and he undertakes the coordination and guidance of "the total U.S.
 foreign intelligence effort," in the words of a letter from the Presi-
 dent of January 1962. ' Reflecting this larger role, the Director of
 Central Intelligence, who formerly both presided as chairman of the
 USIB and acted as the CIA member, now serves on the Board only
 in the capacity of chairman.  Since 1962, the practice has been for
 the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence to sit on the U.S. Intel-
 ligence Board as the representative of CIA.
 While CIA's role in matters of intelligence interpretation is in
 large part one of melding the estimates of other USIB agencies, it
 also propounds its own viewpoints in the general effort to reach a
 consensus.  On Sino-Soviet bloc economic developments, for exam-
 ple, CIA originates a large part of the contributions to strategic
 estimates, and CIA viewpoints in this area tend to carry the weight
 that the services carry in military intelligence and that other USIB
 agencies carry in their special fields of competence.
 When the analyses of all these agencies are integrated in CIA or
 one of the interagency intelligence committees, the resultant product

 the form of strategic estimates (say on the probable course of Sino-
 Soviet relations), of basic encyclopedic descriptions (terrain, reli-
 gion, labor force, harbors, air force, governmental organizations,
 transportation, etc.), or of current intelligence assessments (the mean-
 ing of Khrushchev's latest statement on Cuba).  CIA must sometimes
 bypass the machinery for complete coordination in the case of cur-
 rent intelligence, where time pressures may call for quick prelimi-
 nary assessments, but the rule is to incorporate the consensus where
 possible of the intelligence community at large.
 In addition to its responsibilities for analysis and coordination,
 CIA is chartered by the National Security Act of 1947 to perform
 for the rest of the intelligence community such services as the NSC
 determines are best performed centrally, as well as other functions
 relating to national security that the NSC may direct.  Under this
 authority, CIA engages in clandestine collection of information, which
 is disseminated to analysts throughout the Government and if the
 contents warrant directly
 In
 addition, the Agency provides the central repository for all intel-
 ligence documents, the archives so to speak, which the researcher
 can use for the expeditious recall on microfilm of thousands upon
 thousands of military attache cables, foreign service dispatches, and
 other classified reports.
 State Department.  Political intelligence as analyzed in the De-
 partment of State constitutes a major ingredient of national intelli-
 gence production.  Foreign Service officers abroad provide some of
 the most highly informative reporting on political and economic con-
 ditions available to the intelligence community.  Their reports are
 not products of clandestine operations but rather of information legiti-
 mately available to diplomatic personnel.
 At headquarters in Washington, the production of finished intel-
 ligence in the State Department is the responsibility of the Bureau
 of Intelligence and Research.  The head of the Bureau, The Director
 of Intelligence and Research-with rank equivalent to that of As-
 sistant Secretary-serves as State's representative on the USIB.  The
 Bureau stresses research and analyses that are "policy oriented,"
 that is, clearly serve the needs of officials at the level of foreign policy
 planning or major decisionmaking.  A pending decision with respect
 to diplomatic recognition of a new Latin American military regime
 might, for example, occasion an assessment by State intelligence of
 political repercussions and economic implications.
 Department of Defense.  The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
 partment of Defense and to improve the Department's capacity for
 the collection, production, and dissemination of defense intelligence.
 DIA has replaced the J-2 of the Joint Staff, and it is now the
 adviser on intelligence matters to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to
 the Secretary of Defense.  The Joint Chiefs have designated the
 Director of DIA as their agent for developing recommendations to
 strengthen the intelligence capabilities of the unified and specified
 commands.
 DIA is still in process of evolution, but it has already taken over
 most of the activities relating to national intelligence that were per-
 formed by the military services.  It has, for example, assumed all
 the responsibility for current intelligence production in the Depart-
 ment of Defense, including the operation of a 24-hour center to re-
 ceive, display, evaluate, and disseminate information necessary for
 quick warning alerts.  DIA is also the focal point in the Department
 of Defense for the production of other intelligence studies and esti-
 mates, and for setting up collection guides and manuals used by
 intelligence components in the field.  This guidance flows from the
 DIA through the unified and specified commands.
 In March 1964, DIA became the sole representative on the USIB
 of all elements of the Department of Defense with the exception of
 the National Security Agency.  DIA, however, will not entirely re-
 place the Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence organizations.
 These organizations continue to have responsibilities in such areas as
 counterintelligence, intelligence training, and technical intelligence
 under the coordination of DIA. They are no longer individually rep-
 resented on the USIB, but they may attend in an observer capacity.
 Arrangements have been made, moreover, to assure that the intelligence
 chiefs of the services retain an important voice in the production of
 intelligence estimates approved by the USIB, especially in fields of
 particular interest like weapons development, air targets, and naval
 facilities.
 National Security Agency.  The interception and decrypting of
 foreign communications is carried on by NSA, an element of the De-
 partment of Defense.. Communications intelligence has on many oc-
 casions provided the United States with information unavailable from
 other sources.  The breaking of Japanese codes prior to Pearl Harbor
 revealed Tokyo's instructions to its diplomats in Washington.

 covering foreign developments in the field of nuclear energy.  Through

 organizations of the Government.

 tion of foreign intelligence is only occasional, but it frequently dis-
 seminates to other members of the intelligence community useful
 information which it has turned up in the course of its counterintel-
 ligence activities.
 In addition to the agencies described above, a number of other Gov-
 ernment departments collect and analyze information on foreign
 areas-Treasury on financial markets abroad, Commerce on economic
 conditions affecting U.S. export prospects, Agriculture on foreign
 crops, to name but a few examples.  In its restricted sense, however,
 the term "intelligence community" is understood to include only the
 agencies represented on the USIB.
 The representatives of the intelligence organizations on the USIB
 can oversee only the broadest phases of intelligence production, and
 standing committees of the USIB have therefore been set up in a com-
 parable role on lower specialized echelons.  The Watch Committee is
 an example. Watch Committee meetings, attended by representatives
 with their supporting staff of analysts from the USIB agencies, assess
 current developments with a'special eye on possible implications for
 the early outbreak of hostilities. Watch Committee conclusions, after
 clearance and approval by the USIB, represent the consensus of the
 intelligence community with regard to the likelihood of imminent hos-
 tilities in any part of the world.
 Other USIB standing committees of growing importance in recent
 years are three committees dealing with various aspects of scientific
 and technical intelligence, especially those relating to modern weapons
 and technology.  Since the military services, AEC, and CIA are re-
 sponsible for different aspects of scientific and technical intelligence,
 assessments of foreign scientific capabilities generally require consid-
 erable interdepartmental coordination and approval by one of these
 committees.
 Similar coordination in the field of economic intelligence is per-
 formed through the Economic Intelligence Committee.  CIA analysts
 produce most of the economic intelligence on the Communist bloc, but
 analysts in other departments also prepare frequent analyses on such
 economic areas as merchant marine transportation and optimum choice
 of industrial installations as military targets.
 Another example of a USIB standing committee is the National
 Intelligence Survey Committee, which superintends the production
 within the intelligence community of "country encyclopedias"-studies
 of terrain, religion, economy, political structure, and other background
 features.  CIA and other agencies contribute chapters of these studies,
 THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY     9
 and CIA incorporates the chapters into "National Intelligence Sur-
 veys." Surveys are prepared for each country and periodically
 revised.

 THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE IN POLICYMAKING

 of taking a position for or against specific policies. Their role is to

 The reason for this meticulous drawing of the line between na-
 tional intelligence and national policy is the need to keep intelligence
 unbiased and free from the appearance of special pleading.  It is
 considered best that intelligence organizations not become committed
 to particular policy interests. If naval intelligence stresses an enemy's
 vulnerability to sea blockade, or if air intelligence enlarges on foreign
 air force and missile strength, some observers see a discomfiting
 analogy to investment counseling by brokers who stand to gain large
 commissions by marketing certain stocks. The legislators who framed
 the National Security Act of 1947 had in mind the necessary line be-
 tween policy formulation and intelligence support when they stipu-
 lated that the Director of Central Intelligence was to be an adviser
 rather than a member of the National Security Council.
 Because of the secrecy that necessarily surrounds the making of
 national policy, there has been widespread public uncertainty that
 the line between policy and intelligence is invariably respected in prac-
 tice.      The question came up during the Senate hearings in 1962 on
 the confirmation of Mr. John A. McCone as Director of Central In-
 telligence. Mr. McCone detailed his concept of the position, affirming
 that his was not a policymaking role but rather one of getting the
 facts and evaluation to those responsible for making policy.  The
 Senators present expressed agreement with this principle.
 The principle must be applied to serve, not thwart, effective policy-
 making. It is proper for intelligence analyses to examine the prob-
 able effects in foreign countries of alternative U.S. policies. Assess-
 ments of the economic situation in Yugoslavia, for example, may be
 made under varying assumptions of the level of U.S. aid.  Soviet
 intentions in Europe or Chinese Communist actions in the Far East
 may be similarly estimated under explicitly stated alternative as-
 sumptions of U.S. courses of action.
 The "hands-off policy" injunction is again relaxed to permit in-
 telligence to evaluate the results of policy decisions already taken.
 The effect of U.S. export controls on the Chinese Communist economy,
 for example, is accepted as a proper area for intelligence analysis.
 In such cases, the intelligence community may find itself with a heavy
 responsibility for decisions to revise or reinforce past policies, despite
 the theoretical apartheid between intelligence support and policy-
 making. A decision, Admiral Radford once pointed out, is an action
 that the executive must take when the answer does not suggest itself
 from the information at hand. When the information supplied seems
 so conslusive as virtually to suggest the proper answer, the philosophi-
 cal distinction between intelligence support and policy decisions loses
 practical force.
 A final word on the proper relationship between intelligence and
 policy must take note of the charge that policy has too often been
 determined without regard to intelligence assessments.  This is a
 charge which had greater validity before the 1947 Act.  In the first
 place, the prestige of the intelligence estimate was then not so high as
 now.  In the second place, the intelligence community is far better
 apprised of the needs of policymakers today than formerly.  As the
 senior intelligence adviser to the President, the Director of Central
 Intelligence is in frequent touch with the White House. Intelligence
 liaison with the Chairman of the Policy Planning Council in the State
 Department helps insure that intelligence studies are programed and
 shaped to meet the needs of policymaking.  The intelligence contribu-
 tion to an interagency task force-say an analysis in depth of the
 social, political, economic, and military forces at work in a country-
 is likely to be of key importance for developing a "country strategy"
 that sets forth sound guidelines to U.S. diplomatic, military, economic
 aid, and other officials.
 Formal arrangements for intelligence participation in policy forums
 are not guarantees of actual practice.  The regular apparatus of gov-
 ernment is sometimes modified and bypassed.  This is truer under some
 administrations than others, but ad hoc devices and enhanced personal
 roles for key officials ' may be required under any administration, if
 the situation is urgent enough.  Despite the deviations from estab-
 lished patterns, the intelligence community in recent years has been
 able to stay in the mainstream, so to speak. The intelligence analyst
 still shies from exerting undue influence on policy, but he works today
 with greater confidence than his counterpart of earlier years that his
 findings will get to the operating officials of the Government and
 receive their respectful consideration.

 THE INTELLIGENCE PROCESS
 The phases of national intelligence are analogous to the phases of
 intelligence on lower echelons, e.g., collection of information, analysis
 of data, and dissemination of conclusions.  The national-intelligence
 process, however, is complicated by the very scale of its activities.
 The analysts are separated-at times by continents-from the collec-
 tors, so that national intelligence calls for essential liaison activities
 and machinery for reconciling the requirements of decisionmakers
 with the capabilities of collectors. By contrast, the intelligence proc-
 ess at the lowest combat level, where the collector may simply be a
 soldier detailed to man a forward observation post and report his
 findings to the battery commander, is an ideal of simplicity.  The
 commander in this case understands the capabilities of the collector
 and can levy his requirements with no more than the usual difficulty
 that oral communication entails. The decisionmaker in this case is
 also the analyst; he both assesses the reports of the soldier and de-
 cides what to do about it.
 On a somewhat higher level, an officer may be assigned to receive
 information from several forward observation posts.  The analytical
 and decisionmaking process are now partly separated.  The officer
 evaluates the reports received from the soldiers at their posts in terms
 of consistency with each other.  The commander must still assess this
 information in terms of consistency with other data received and
 draw his conclusions on enemy dispositions and intentions.
 On a still higher level, an intelligence component of a unit evaluates
 the information received and gives its view of the probable courses of
 action open to the enemy. On this level, the intelligence organiza-
 tion's sources of information are far more inclusive than those usually
 open to lower echelons. On this level, however, the specialization of
 labor among collectors, analysts, and decisionmakers becomes sharply
 defined, and troublesome problems of communication among the spe-
 cialists arise.
 REQUIREMENTS
 As the organization becomes more complex, a machinery for re-
 quirements is found desirable to facilitate communication among
 personnel in the various stages of the intelligence process. The need
 for intelligence information may arise at any level; we may take as

 illustrative a?need arising at the decisionmaking level, say, of -a Voice
 of America radiobroadcast programer who wants to know how well
 Doctor Zhivago is selling in South Asia and how closely government
 officials, military officers, and university students there are following
 the tribulations of Boris Pasternak.  In the likely event that this in-
 formation is not immediately available, the intelligence-producing
 organizations will be asked to provide it.
 The information may be readily at hand in the files of the intel-
 ligence analyst.  If so, the task is relatively simple; the analyst simply
 brings his talents to bear on the assembly, evaluation, and presentation
 of the data in a manner-say, a short memorandum-useful to the
 radio programer.  The whole process from the initial levying of
 requirements by the programer to his receipt of the desired memo-
 randum may be completed in a few hours.
 When there are gaps in the analyst's files and the deadline for his
 memorandum permits, he will levy requirements on the collectors for
 the missing information.  The analyst stands to be embarrassed, how-
 ever, if he levies his requirements only to be told that the information
 has already been collected and disseminated.  The essential prelim-
 inary to the formulation of spot requirements, therefore, is to ascertain
 that the answers are not already available. This means a check with
 other analysts in whose files the information desired could conceivably
 be found.  It means in addition a check with the reference services in
 the Central Intelligence Agency, which by electronic data-processing
 methods can quickly retrieve from its microfilm files copies of intelli-
 gence documents received from all agencies of the intelligence
 community.
 The analyst who decides to go ahead and levy requirements is under
 the strongest obligation to explain his needs clearly to the collectors.
 The "anything you have on Boris Pasternak" type of requirement is
 likely to elicit a flow of irrelevancies.  A useful adjunct of a good
 requirement is some background to suggest what is already known in
 order to help the collector approach his task as a man who is at least
 well informed if not necessarily an expert on the subject.  The ques-
 tions that follow the background information will indicate specific
 lines of inquiry for the collector : For example, what statements about
 the affair can be reliably attributed to individual government officials?
 What was the nature of discussions on Pasternak following certain
 lectures at the military command and staff schools?  What commen-
 taries appeared in student newspapers? in book reviews?
 The analyst will also suggest the field-collection agency he considers
 best equipped to gather the information.  In this case, the services
 of more than one are clearly called for.  South Asian government
 tions with Foreign Service personnel: The State Department is one
 obvious choice to receive the requirement.  The military services,
 whose attaches have occasion to talk with South Asian officers, should
 also get the requirement.  CIA's clandestine service may also be asked
 to help, but the rule is not to ask for covert collection if overt collection
 will do the job.                                          STAT
 Normally, the analyst does not advise the field collectors on pro-
 cedures for obtaining the needed information.  On occasion, however,
 he is in a position to suggest a good lead.
 With a specific priority (urgent, routine, etc.), the requirement is
 off through channels to the appropriate collectors in the field, and the
 analyst may be relieved of further thought on the matter for the mo-
 ment. When the responses come in, the analyst must take a little
 time away from his principal preoccupation with substantive analysis
 to help the field assess its collection effort.  The clandestine services,
 in particular, are eager for the analyst's appraisal, since their sources
 include many of untested reliability.  The retention or dismissal of
 these informants depends often on the consistency of their repor8TAT
 with other data available to the substantive experts at headquarters.
 Servicing the responses may also entail supplemental requirements
 by the anal St.
 .
 An initial spurt of collection activity on behalf of the analyst will
 usually be followed by sporadic reports which become less and less
 frequent as the weeks go on.  Eventually, Voice of America program-
 ers must turn to more timely matters as world comment on Pasternak
 dies down, and the analyst decides to "close out" his requirement.
 The overcautious analyst who procrastinates in taking the final close-
 out step is a trial to field collectors, who usually have more requests
 for information than they can fulfill in detail.
 This description of the analyst's role in levying requirements does
 not do justice to the offices that intelligence organizations have espe-
 cially set up for "collection guidance," i.e., informing collectors of the
 priority needs of intelligence analysts.  Collectors must have a broad
 picture of intelligence needs if they are to allocate their limited re-
 sources efficiently over an extended period of time.  This pic-
 ture is not acquired by conversation with individual analysts, who
 are likely to stress the overriding importance of their own special inter-

 ponent responsible for collection guidance will check and validate the
 requirements that individual analysts wish to levy.
 One of the first tasks of collection guidance is to draw up broad
 intelligence objectives that identify the critical problems of substantive
 intelligence (e.g., the capability of the U.S.S.R. for nuclear attack or
 the Chinese Communist capabilities to support guerrilla war in South-
 east Asia).  These intelligence objectives are not directives to the
 collectors but, rather, guides to planning for analysts and collectors
 alike.
 Analysts may be able to address themselves to some of the objectives
 with little or no demand for new intelligence collection.  In general,
 however, it will be necessary to detail intelligence gaps in so-called
 collection guides.  These guides in effect incorporate the standing re-
 quirements upon collectors for specific categories of information : ac-
 complishments or failures in fulfilling national economic plans, morale;
 in the armed forces, radar defenses, and signs of factionalism in the
 governing political party, for example.
 The standing requirements may be supplemented at any time by
 spot requirements, like those described above relating to the Pasternak
 affair. The means are at hand, moreover, to levy requirements on an
 urgent basis.  At any hour, it may be necessary to take immediate
 action to clarify information suggesting that a crisis situation is in
 the making.    This is likely to entail some rather frantic telephoning
 to alert collectors and to stay abreast of U.S. operations and deploy-
 ments. If a sudden coup abroad seems to be taking a nasty turn, the
 intelligence officer responsible for collection guidance will stay in close
 touch, for example, with the all-night center in State Department.
 In the course of the night, he will perhaps levy a requirement for an
 outgoing cable to learn the latest on efforts of deposed leaders to get
 U.S. asylum.  Collection guidance is a round-the-clock activity, and
 the "action officer" of collection guidance components has to take his
 turn of night, weekend, and holiday duty.
 COLLECTION
 In modern intelligence organizations, the analyst's "in-box" is filled
 daily with the information that has been gathered for him by a far--
 flung network of collectors.  The in-box is the analyst's mailbox, so
 to speak, to which is delivered the counterparts of the magazines,
 newspapers, and other information media that keep the well-educated
 American an informed citizen.  The intelligence analyst is thus able
 to follow his academic bents as a sedentary, good life-insurance risk
 l
 E
 CE PROCESS    17
 The picture of the intelligence analyst in the academic research role
 is rendered still. more fitting by the nature of data he usually prefers
 to work with-overt or semiovert.  Not that he deigns to use the
 product of clandestine collection; in some cases, he prizes it as the
 only intelligence available.  But usually he finds that overt sources
 provide the greater part of the reliable information open to him.  In
 many cases, the conclusions reached by the intelligence analyst are
 not appreciably different from those that would be reached by scholars
 drawing on the information available in their university libraries.
 1. News services. Intelligence organizations in the Free and Com-
 munist Worlds subscribe to or monitor the press services. Reuters,
 AP, or UPI tickers often print the first news of a Latin American
 revolt, the resignation of important officials, the text of a communique
 released at the end of a state visit.  Many an analyst has to leave his
 warm bed in the early morning hours to prepare his quick assessment
 of a news scoop ticking over the press wires.
 During more relaxed working hours, the analyst can take advantage
 of the wealth of data offered daily in the newspapers, both foreign and
 domestic.  The dispatches from news correspondents in London, Ber-
 lin, Hong Kong, Djakarta, Moscow, and other cities are not always
 in accord with information in intelligence files, but the quality of re-
 porting compares favorably with the average of intelligence informa-
 tion that comes through the in-box.  Insofar as information from
 news sources is concerned, the intelligence organizations in the Com-
 munist world have, of course, all the advantage.  "I would give a
 great deal," former Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles has
 said, "if I could know as much about the Soviet Union as the Soviet
 Union can learn about us by merely reading the press."
 2. Foreign publications.  Collected either by subscription or by
 purchase in foreign countries, these publications make up a valued
 component of the intelligence take. The Communists since the death
 of Stalin are publishing considerably more detail in their economic
 and technical journals.  At the 20th Party Congress in February
 1956, Premier Bulganin urged the Soviets to "reduce secrecy meas-
 ures to allow a freer exchange of information and opinion."
 Despite the relaxation of Soviet security, promoted in large part
 by the propagandistic advantages of publicizing technical achieve-
 ments, many Soviet journals are still chary about releasing types of
 data freely published in the West.  By contrast, with virtually un-
 limited access to American open-source trade publications and scien-
 tific journals, the U.S.S.R. can keep relatively well informed on the
 status of the U.S. guided-missile program, on atomic-reactor and elec-

 fee, the Russians can obtain technical descriptions of inventions from
 the U.S. Patent Office.
 The timelag between publication and arrival at the in-box limits
 the usefulness of foreign publications as current intelligence.  Their
 principal serviceability is to provide details which can be assembled
 and incorporated in research studies.  In the absence of many foreign
 publications, the intelligence services often found their research tasks
 exasperatingly difficult in World War II.  A Japanese-language
 who's who of Japan published in 1940, for example, contained 150,000
 short biographies.  Apparently no one in the United States requested
 a copy before Pearl Harbor, and resort was necessary during the war
 to another edition in the English language, which contained only 3,000
 biographies.
 3. Radio Monitoring: Foreign radio broadcasts provide a large
 and valued part of the material that goes into current-intelligence
 production.  While some of the information in the broadcasts finds
 its way into the columns of the daily press, much of it never does.  In
 any case news accounts are sometimes distorted, and they must be
 checked against original texts.
 There is, of course, an overlay of propaganda in some broadcasts,
 which handicaps the discrimination between facts and claims.     Never-
 theless, study of enemy broadcasts during World War II showed that
 sophisticated propaganda analysis could yield revealing insights to
 supplement other information available to intelligence officers.  After
 the war, perceptive scrutiny of veiled phrases in broadcasts from Mos-
 cow and Peiping suggested sharpening differences between the two
 Communist allies during the 1950's, when most other indications
 pointed to continuing Sino-Soviet solidarity.
 4. Domestic collection,.  It is not always necessary to go abroad
 to collect intelligence on foreign countries.  Interviews with in-
 formed persons in this country have often yielded information of
 value.  The Hungarian revolt enlarged the number of intelligence
 sources in the United States by the influx of refugees.  Letters from
 families made available by immigrants to this country have provided
 useful details on conditions abroad.  Only a small percentage of busi-
 nessmen, Government officials, and others who visit foreign countries
 sell their stories for publication.   The others are generally willing
 to recount their experiences to interested listeners.  Sometimes trav-
 elers report conversations with foreign officials who apparently
 intended that their remarks would be passed to others in the United
 States. The information is nonetheless of interest to the intelligence

 official duties, they are able to offer authoritative opinions on political,
 economic, and cultural developments in a country.  On many occa-
 sions they have forwarded information that was of highest impor-
 tance for national security.  In 1935 the Baldwin cabinet in London
 was jolted into expanding the British air force by Foreign Secretary
 Sir John Simon's account of his conversation with Hitler.  The
 Fuehrer told Sir John that Germany had already achieved air parity
 with Britain and that Germany would go on building until its air
 force was as large as those of Britain and France combined.
 The diplomatic reports from the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo provided
 vital information on the developing tensions in the Pacific.  In Janu-
 ary 1941 Ambassador Grew wrote :
 A member of the Embassy was told by my . . . colleague that
 from many quarters, including a Japanese one, he had heard that
 a surprise mass attack on Pearl Harbor was planned by the Japa-
 nese military forces, in case of "trouble" between Japan and the
 United States; that the attack would involve the use of all the Jap-
 anese military facilities.  My colleague said that he was prompted
 to pass this on because it had come to him from many sources,
 although the plan seemed fantastic.
 6. Attaches.  Like Foreign Service officers, military attaches
 are able in pursuit of their legitimate functions to collect intelligence
 information without recourse to clandestine methods.  Invited to
 observe maneuvers, to visit installations, to exchange such data as
 training manuals, they are able to gather and forward military infor-
 mation of a wide variety.
 The military attache can be a particularly useful collector in a coun-
 try where the army is or threatens to become a force in politics. In
 the course of his official associations, he may then become the recipient
 of information of high political significance.
 Civilians also serve as attaches in U.S. embassies abroad-agricul-
 tural attaches, for example. The impact on the American conscious-
 ness of recent scientific progress has resulted in an increase in the
 number of scientific attaches serving abroad. The information col-
 lected by the civilian attaches is overt but nonetheless valuable in
 economic- and scientific-intelligence production.
 7. Photography. Motion and still pictures are highly regarded
 in such applications as target analysis or the computation of plant
 capacities. While some of the pictures must be taken covertly, others
 are free for the clipping from such propaganda periodicals as China

 THE INTELLIGENCE PROCESS    21
 20     THE INTELLIGENCE PROCESS
 II formed a useful portion of the intelligence available to the First
 Marine Division when it went into Guadalcanal in August 1942.
 Aerial photography in wartime has often paid its cost many times
 over.  Aerial photography, for example, revealed the location of
 German rocket-launching ramps at Peenemunde.  Subsequent RAF
 bombing delayed production of the German missiles for months.
 More recently, aerial photography provided the confirming intelligence
 of Soviet missiles in Cuba.
 8. Clandestine collection.  On numerous occasions, clandestine
 collection has yielded outstanding results. The U.S.S.R. was notably
 successful after World War II in stealing atom bomb secrets through
 the services of such skilled agents as Bruno Pontecorvo and Allen
 Nunn May. In World War II, the butler of the British Ambassador
 in Turkey transmitted to the Germans photographs of documents
 which gave details of Allied strategy.  Fortunately for the Allied
 cause, the Nazis failed to act on the intelligence in the belief that it
 had been planted by the British.
 As a security measure to protect sources of information, reports
 from clandestine services describe the agent only in very general
 terms, e.g., "a university student who is a member of the Young
 Communist League and might have access to the incident he recounts."
 To aid the analyst, such reports usually contain the field's evaluation
 of the source's reliability and its own appraisal of the accuracy of
 the information supplied.  The field evaluation is expressed by a
 letter-number rating in accordance with the following key :
 A
 Appraisal of Source
 Completely reliable.
 1
 Appraisal of Content
 Confirmed by other sources.
 B
 Usually reliable.
 2
 Probably true.
 C
 Fairly reliable.
 3
 Possibly true.
 D
 Not usually reliable.
 4
 Doubtful.
 E
 Unreliable.
 5
 Improbable.
 F
 Reliability cannot be judged.
 6
 Truth cannot be judged.
 This rating is sometimes the only guide the analyst has to the
 credibility he should attach to the report.  At other times, he can
 assess it against other confirming or contradictory information in
 his files.
 9. Communications intercepts.  British interception of the fa-
 mous Zimmerman message in 1917 was one of the important events
 of that year leading up to U.S. entry in World War I.  The message
 from Berlin's foreign minister contained instructions to the German
 Ambassador in Mexico for opening negotiations with that country
 and offering it the opportunity to recover its "lost territory in Texas,
 INFORMATION PROCESSING
 The scale of collection is now so large that the efficiency of the
 intelligence process rests to an increasing extent on the skills of the
 reference services.  The intelligence analyst can store in his own
 individual files only a small part of the documents that flow daily
 through his in-box.  For the remainder, and for the still larger part.
 that bypasses his in-box, he rests his trust in the reference services
 which operate the central repositories where all incoming informa-
 tion is classified and filed.  The flow of intelligence information from
 the collectors to the analysts is usually simultaneous with the flow of
 copies to the reference services.
 The initial task of the reference service is to index incoming docu-
 ments by a numerical code according to subject (commercial airfields,
 railroad transportation, treaties, etc.), area (Lebanon, North Vietnam,
 Ecuador), source (air force, foreign publication, clandestine service),
 security classification (secret, confidential, unclassified), and date of
 information.  A document which treats more than one subject or area.
 must, accordingly, be recorded under several number codes.
 The documents themselves are usually microfilmed.  Punched cards
 and electronic data processing permit rapid retrieval of the microfilm
 copies upon the analyst's request.
 Useful as is the reference service in the recording, storing, and
 recalling of information, its machine assets also enable it to go a.
 step further by synthesizing data in response to specific requests.
 Thus, for target analysis, data-processing techniques can quickly
 produce a listing of large industrial installations in a specified city.
 Or they can come up with a listing of Soviet scientists who have been
 reportedly engaged in nuclear-energy research.  While these appli-
 cations of automation are hardly likely to displace the analyst, they
 stand to relieve him of some of his onerous data-assembly duties and
 leave him freer for interpretative analyses.  Increasingly it is the
 reference service rather than the analyst that comes up with the
 information-sans-analysis answers which are often called for (percent-
 age of Chinese cotton production that goes into padding for clothing
 and bedding, for instance).
 Utilizing these obvious advantages of automation, the reference
 services can also publish general listings designed to economize the
 number of special requests.  One such aid may be a who's who of
 scientific personnel; another, a virtual Dun & Bradstreet record of
 foreign industrial firms.

 For Release 2004/06/24: CI -RDP78-03584R000100070001-7                 THE INTELLIGENCE PROCESS     25
 The analytical process in intelligence varies with the office.  The
 functional intelligence analyst (economic, scientific, or military) is
 often engaged in research studies akin to doctoral dissertations. The
 current-intelligence officer, with his quick assessments of daily de-
 velopments, bears a likeness to the newspaper columnist.  The esti-
 mates officer has to integrate the contributions of several departments
 so that a general consensus rather than his own personal view emerges.
 These distinctions notwithstanding, certain phases appear common
 to the analysis process in all intelligence offices.
 1. Defining the problem. The analyst must have terms of refer-
 ence.  These may be specified for the estimator in guidance from pol-
 icymakers ("We need an estimate on Chinese Communist intentions
 toward Southeast Asia").  Or they may be redefined for the func-
 tional analyst who is to contribute to the estimate ("We'll need backup
 on Communist China's prospective food harvests and population
 growth").  Or it may be clearly indicated to the current-intelligence
 analyst by the same sense that guides the journalist in deciding what
 is newsworthy ("I'd better hurry down to the office and get off some
 quick paragraphs on the meaning behind the Kremlin's new blast
 at Tito").
 2. Assembly of data.  The analyst's own files are usually the
 first place he goes to for the background ,he needs.  Our current-in-
 telligence analyst, for example, will look to his files for copies of ear-
 lier Soviet blasts at Belgrade and compare their tone with the latest
 attack.  Because of the pressure of time, his own files may in fact
 be the only recourse open to him for the moment.      The analyst re-
 searching China's food production, on the other hand, can look also
 to the files of other analysts, to the resources of libraries, and to the
 automatic data-processing machines, which can recover documents
 stored in the intelligence repositories.
 3. Evaluation. The analyst must judge his data in terms of in-
 ternal consistency and in terms of consistency with other known data.
 Are Communist China's harvest claims consistent with its statistics of
 acreage? with weather reports? and with estimates of reasonable crop
 yields?  How does a report of troop movements square with the field
 evaluation of the source's reliability?
 One of the analyst's most dangerous pitfalls in the evaluation phase
 f         h'    n conservatism-his reluctance to accept informa-
 ow
 one U.S. agency that German war output went up rather than down
 in 1943 was rejected by many informed analysts at the time.
 "False confirmation" of data is another hazard to the analyst in the
 evaluation phase.  Reports received from several collectors are often
 traceable to one ultimate source.  The various reports should be re-
 garded as one.  The danger of false confirmation becomes especially
 high when a foreign government deliberately fabricates reports to
 throw off enemy intelligence.  A classic example of such deception
 was the British "Operation Mincemeat," which involved spurious
 messages recovered from the body of an Englishman off the coast of
 Spain during World War II.     The messages fooled Nazi intelligence
 and resulted in the change of Germany's Mediterranean defense plans
 in the expectation of an Allied assault against Sardinia and Greece.
 The deception saved thousands of Allied lives when the landings came
 in Sicily.
 4. Study and interpretation.  Having assembled the data and
 decided which are valid and acceptable, the analyst must construct the
 mosaic which will answer the terms of reference given at the outset
 of the analytic process.  Our researcher into Chinese Communist
 harvests has assembled data on past agricultural production of spe-
 cific crops.  He has also assembled whatever information is available
 on the regime's economic objectives as declared in annual and 5-year
 plans.  He has assembled data on the success or failure in meeting
 previous agricultural targets.  From his study and best interpretation
 of the data, he makes his own projection of Chinese Communist har-
 vests.                                                                                             He balances this against food requirements as calculated from
 a projection of population growth.
 5. Presentation.  Intelligence information is not "finished in-
 telligence" until it is rendered, with interpretative commentary, in a
 form that can be communicated to other persons.  Sometimes this
 communication is effected through oral briefings. The Director of
 Central Intelligence, for example, briefs the National Security Coun-
 cil regularly on current-intelligence developments.                                                                                      More often, fin-
 ished intelligence is presented in writing, which can take forms rang-
 ing from single-page memoranda to detailed studies accompanied by
 maps and other graphic aids.

 tion are entrusted to a service component, which uses routine couriers,
 or, if circumstances dictate, special couriers, teletype, and other elec-
 tric means of transmisssions.
 The collection office in particular is constantly confronted with the
 decision to "dissem" or "no dissem," since a large part of its take
 is obviously of marginal value to analysts and may be useful only to
 develop a file which will ultimately permit an assessment of the
 source's reliability or efficiency.  While analysis offices sometimes
 decide to make "no dissems" out of finished-intelligence studies, such
 studies are generally undertaken in the expectation that they will
 yield conclusions worthy of publication and circulation.
 In the dissemination phase, both collection and analysis offices must
 decide how wide a circle of readers will receive the intelligence.  In
 part, this decision can be based on the security classification placed
 on the report; if it is top secret, it will obviously not be circulated
 among those who have only a secret clearance.  In addition, the dis-
 semination decision is governed by the "need-to-know" rule; that is,
 regardless of his security clearance, a person should receive only
 the information he needs for the efficient discharge of his official
 responsibilities.
 Both these rules serve as necessary security safeguards, but they can
 be prejudicial to national-security interests if applied overrigorously.
 The Joint Congressional Committee on the Pearl Harbor investiga-
 tion condemned the overrestrictive circulation of intelligence derived
 from the decrypting of Japanese codes. The committee observed
 that "the fact the Japanese codes had been broken was regarded
 as of more importance than the information obtained from decoded
 traffic.  The result of this rather specious premise was to leave large
 numbers of policymaking and enforcement officials in Washing-
 ton completely oblivious of the most pertinent information concerning
 Japan."

 CATEGORIES OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
 National intelligence in the United States may be distinguished by
 two features :
 1. It is intended to
 policy.
 serve the formulators of national-security
 2. Its content, transcending the exclusive competence of a single
 department or agency, is presented as the consensus of the intelligence
 community.
 Since national policy is not designed to be a shifting guide to action
 but rather to serve as a standing precept over a considerable span of
 time, intelligence is needed that will afford rather long-range fore-
 knowledge of the capabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable courses of
 action of foreign nations.  Such intelligence is usually presented in
 the form of a "strategic estimate." When prepared at the national
 level as a composite of the views of the intelligence community, it is
 produced as a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE).
 Strategic estimates may take weeks or months to prepare, although
 a "crash" NIE can also be produced on a current crisis.  In the in-
 terim between the appearance of the estimates, the National Security
 Council customarily looks to reports of current-intelligence develop-
 ments.  It is on these reports rather than the longer-range strategic
 estimates that the NSC would have to rely to provide the sort of ad-
 vance warning that was so notably missing before Pearl Harbor.
 The factual information resulting from the collation of encyclo-
 pedic data-basic intelligence-is customarily produced for the use
 of other analysts but may also provide needed background informa-
 tion to high-level officials. When prepared as the integrated product
 of the intelligence community, it appears in a publication which has
 been officially designated as national intelligence (National Intelli-
 gence Survey).
 All three categories of national intelligence-strategic estimates,
 current reports, and basic studies-are based on analyses prepared
 in the various departments and agencies by military-intelligence of-
 ficers, economists, foreign-affairs analysts, and other functional spe-
 cialists.  These functional studies are designated in conventional
 usage as military intelligence, economic intelligence, political intelli-
 gence, biographic intelligence, etc.  The responsibilities for their pro-

 ties : ground-forces intelligence to the Army, political intelligence to
 the State Department, biographic intelligence on naval personnel to
 the Navy, for example. A review of such functional-intelligence
 production requires the consideration of activities below the national-
 intelligence level and is reserved for the following chapter.  Func-
 tional specializations are many and are not reviewed in depth. Eco-
 nomic intelligence is examined in most detail because of its special
 interest to the faculty and students of the Industrial College of the
 Armed Forces.
 THE STRATEGIC ESTIMATE
 The National Intelligence Estimate is the most authoritative
 expression of national intelligence today.  Preliminary expressions
 of view by the intelligence community may go to the National Security
 Council in other analyses. The considered view of the community-
 reached in most cases only after protracted deliberation-is to be
 found in the formal estimate.
 The function of National Intelligence Estimates is to suggest where
 the world is heading.  This requires an examination of the present
 situation and a projection of expected trends over the period of the
 estimate. The length of the estimative period varies. A general
 estimate of the Soviet Union over the next five years might be regarded
 as appropriate to support policy decisions relating to the national
 posture toward international communism. A special estimate brought
 on by another crisis over the status of Berlin or the Chinese offshore
 islands might be expected to project Communist courses of action over
 the next six months.
 When the estimative period is short, particularly in crisis situa-
 tions where quick policy decisions are in the making, the task of the
 estimator may become especially trying.  A 5-year projection permits
 successive corrections of intelligence and modification of policy as the
 estimates are periodically brought up to date.  The shorter range
 estimates, on the other hand, may be all too quickly tested by events;
 the margin for error is narrower. Strategy in games can be modified
 if the play seems to be going against the individual.  But if the
 game permits only one or two rounds of play, the initial strategy is
 an all-important determinant of the outcome.
 The initial task of the estimator is that described in the previous
 chapter as the first step in analysis, namely, defining the problem or
 setting forth the terms of reference. If the estimate is to project the
 main trends in a foreign country ApirOlvedeFKbrfiRels  e, 2b04k?824 : C
 of reference will cover the specific political, economic, and military
 issues that bear on decisions of long-range policy.  With respect
 to the internal political situation, for example, is the present leader-
 ship stable?  If the government is authoritarian, is its chief advanced
 in years and is his death likely to result in a struggle for the succes-
 sion?  What will be the role of the military in such a struggle? of
 the political party or parties? of other loci of power?
 What can be said about popular attitudes?  The estimate here,
 in addition to some necessary generalities, will outline the sentiments
 of specific groups in the population-intelligentsia, workers, peasants,
 national minorities.  If there is widespread hostility to the govern-
 ment, will this manifest itself in passive discontent? in sporadic riots?
 in sustained armed resistance?
 Particular attention attaches to the section of the terms of reference
 dealing with the foreign country's external relations, since develop-
 ments in this field may impinge most directly on United States security
 interests. The estimate will be expected to assess present and prospec-
 tive relations with allies, popular and official attitudes regarding the
 balance of forces in the world, and the nature and force of convictions
 relating to suitable principles for dealing with East-West tensions.
 Here again generalities will be supplemented by discussions of atti-
 tudes on specific issues, for example, United States military bases
 abroad, German unification, UN membership for Peiping.  For, while
 generalities are useful, they must not conceal the prospect that the de-
 gree of support for or opposition to the United States will vary with
 the issue involved.
 The terms of reference on economic issues will probably indicate an
 interest in policies relating to the allocation of resources. Is invest-
 ment to be proportionately greater or less in the military-support
 industries? in consumer-goods industries? in agriculture? What pro-
 jections can be made regarding the absolute level of defense expendi-
 tures? of total and per capita private consumption? How will changes
 in yields and exploitation of new lands affect crop harvests? What

 national product, may be singled out as a good indicator of economic
 viability. In the dynamic economy, this rate of growth is expected
 to exceed the rate of population increase by a significant margin.
 Economic relations with other countries will be examined for their
 possible bearing on the country's political orientation in foreign affairs.

 economic relations may exercise on political orientation. The propor-
 tion of total foreign trade consisting of commerce with. a particular
 country is more meaningful than the absolute level of trade.
 If the country is a potential antagonist of the United States in armed
 conflict, especial care will be taken in setting forth the military terms
 of reference. The conventional questions will be asked about the size,
 equipment, and proficiency of the land, air, and naval forces. These
 overall aggregates will be supplemented by an examination of capabili-
 ties in different geographic areas. In addition to review of men and
 hardware, there may be a summary of current military doctrine in
 the country. What seems to be its thinking on such issues as surprise
 attack? on limited versus total war? on the military organization and
 weapons mix best suited for the needs of the day?
 In today's world, the military strength of the country is a function
 in growing measure of scientific and technical capabilities.  If the
 country surveyed is one of the more developed in the world, there will
 be a detailed appraisal of the state of research and technology in mis-
 siles, atomic-energy applications, electronics, and long-range aviation.
 If the terms of reference are suitably defined, the estimate is in a
 fair way of being able to portray what Sherman Kent has called the
 "strategic stature" of the country, that is, the amount of influence it
 can exert in international affairs. This influence may be exerted by
 employing or threatening to employ military force, by economic re-
 prisals or blandishments, by moral suasion, or by propaganda.  It
 varies in accordance with the country's identifiable assets (as sought
 out by the terms of reference) : friendships in the international com-
 munity, military and nonmilitary strength in being, ability to mobi-
 lize forces and resources in emergencies, and resiliency in catas-
 trophes. It further is limited by the country's liabilities: exposed
 geographical position, popular dissatisfaction, unstable leadership,
 economic backwardness.  Its common border with the USSR is a
 noteworthy liability of Finland. The sympathy of neutralist nations
 for Yugoslavia is one of its assets.
 If the National Intelligence Estimate went no further than to out-
 line the country's strategic stature, it would still constitute a valued
 intelligence study. It must, however, come to grips with the "64-dol-
 lar" question, the probable courses of action. While intelligence has
 proved far from infallible here, the estimator can make a claim to
 something better than mere sootl~syieF~rOr?elt'b'~6/14 : C
 what the country's leaders have declared their intentions to be. If
 they say they are going to modernize the military establishment, he
 may choose to accept the statement as an indication of their true
 intentions.
 Second, the estimator knows that intentions in reasoning men are
 limited by capabilities. Estimates of Chinese Communist intentions
 to take Taiwan by military force will be governed by prior estimates
 of Communist capabilities to provide the amphibious lift. needed for
 an attack.
 Sometimes, the prognostication of a probable course of action is
 so difficult that the estimator has no recourse but to limit himself to
 an analysis of capabilities, noting that the exercise of the capabilities
 cannot be excluded as a reasonable possibility. To some extent, this
 statement of capabilities is an implied estimate of intentions, since
 estimators reject the consideration of capabilities whose exercise ap-
 pears outlandish or clearly counter to national objectives, e.g., the
 British capability to assault Peru.  The statement of capabilities
 comes closest to the assessment of intentions when "net" rather than
 "gross" or "raw" capabilities are considered. Gross capabilities are
 estimated without reference to possible counteraction, e.g., country A
 has the capability to commit 150,000 troops in an attack on country B.
 Net capabilities are related to opposing forces, e.g., Communist China
 can take over Outer Mongolia if the USSR does not intervene. Given
 Peiping's estimate of Soviet commitments to Ulan Bator, such a state-
 ment of net capability is almost equivalent to an estimate of Commu-
 nist China's probable course of action towards Outer Mongolia.
 Another recourse of the estimator, when the evidence is insufficient
 to support a flat prediction, is to identify the alternative courses of
 action that are consistent with a country's capabilities and policies.
 Country A, for examplq, can commit its armed forces to a full-scale
 military assault on country B during the period of the estimate, or it
 can limit its military actions to border incidents and threatening
 troop movements, or it can step up its harassments by a combination
 of propaganda and economic and diplomatic pressures. If, on balance,
 the weight of the evidence suggests that one course of action is more
 probable than another, the orders of probability will be given.
 An intelligence estimate which allows for more than one possibility
 leaves the estimators open to the charge of acting the oracle whose
 prophecies seek to cover all contingencies.  Their best defense may be.
 to point to the statements of order of probability. Their only other de-
 fense is that a flat prediction in the absence of supporting intelligence
 is even more the mark of the humbug. Intelligence does no service for
 policymakers by overstating its knowledge.      It is as important to
 32     CATEGORIES OF NATIONAL INTELLIGE"proved For Release 2004/06/24 :
 identify what is not known as what is known. History is replete with
 instances of inaccurate estimates based on insufficient information.
 Many analysts near the close of World War II understood that too
 little recent information was at hand to appraise the qualities of
 Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchuria.  Informed opinion in the
 Government, however, was betrayed by the reputation for fighting
 strength which the army carried with it from its prewar days, and the
 entry of Soviet forces into Manchuria was urged. Actually, the best
 units of the Kwantung Army had long been transferred out to more
 urgent theaters of the Pacific.
 The overcautious estimators are in fact not those who are chary
 of flat predictions but those who seek a "margin of safety" in fore-
 casting the worst.  If the worst does not eventuate, all heads will
 remain on their shoulders. If the worst happens without forewarn-
 ing, on the other hand, the inevitable postmortems will find their
 scalps in the intelligence community. The mettle of the estimators
 is most severely tested when, despite a foreign country's military
 threats and militant displays, the background evidence suggests that
 the country will probably stop short of full-scale hostilities.  Even
 with the proviso that hostilities are possible, it takes qualities beyond
 those found in the charlatan to affirm that, on balance, war appears
 improbable.
 The mechanics of producing a National Intelligence Estimate insure
 high responsiveness to the needs of the policymakers and the consid-
 eration of as much information as can possibly be brought to bear
 on the problem. While a schedule of production and revision insures
 that estimates on the most important countries are kept reasonably
 current, a good many estimates are prepared out of schedule on the
 suggestion of important policy officials.
 The estimate initiated, all the agencies that will contribute (CIA,
 DIA, State, etc.) agree on the scope of the problem and the areas
 of study to be allocated to each agency.  In the next several weeks
 (less if the situation necessitates), the basic research and initial
 analyses are completed by the contributing agencies.  The Central
 Intelligence Agency fuses the contributions, and a first draft emerges
 which necessarily distorts points made by some of the con-
 tributors if unanimity of view on all points was lacking to start with.
 Redrafts and interagency meetings and perhaps 'more redrafts may
 be called for before a final paper is worked out.  Approval by the

 United States Intelligence Board is the final preliminary to publica-
 tion as a new National Intelligence Estimate.
 While this procedure may seem cumbersome, it does have the virtue
 of assuring that the best information and the best talents in the
 Government are brought to bear in the drafting of a very important
 intelligence document.  The time involved in the procedure is not
 overlong when one considers that the analysis will provide part of the
 rationale underlying the Nation's policies for years.  The time in-
 volved, moreover, can be telescoped on occasions of especial urgency.
 National Intelligence Estimates have been prepared and approved by
 the United States Intelligence Board in a matter of hours.
 The danger of such intelligence production by conference and com-
 mittee lies not in complexities of procedure but in over-zealous efforts
 to hammer out a consensus.  This could result in "lowest common
 denominator" intelligence to irritate rather than inform the policy-
 makers.  If all contributors to an estimate except one believe that
 country A will probably be increasingly antagonistic to country B,
 the substitute of "may" for "will probably" is often a wording that all
 might agree on. An alternative course would be to reject surface una-
 nimity and instead note the views of the dissenting agency in a foot-
 note. There is a rule of reason that obtains in the matter of dissents :
 Quibbles about phraseology must not obscure the fact that all are in
 agreement on the general thrust of the argument. But when there are
 firmly held differences on important questions, current practice is to
 allow dissent in the estimates rather than compromise on a watered-
 down wording.
 The National Intelligence Estimate is not analogous to a Supreme
 Court decision, by which lower courts must abide.  Nevertheless, in
 the stamp of highest authority impressed upon the estimate, there
 lies the hazard that it may freeze viewpoints throughout the intelli-
 gence community.  Criticisms and comments from authorities are
 therefore invited after the estimate is published. On occasion, the
 criticisms will effect a fresh look at the estimate and result in changes
 when the estimate is next revised.
 With an eye to the next revision, the estimators themselves must
 critique their own efforts, noting particularly where they were handi-
 capped by intelligence gaps.  In a few cases, these gaps can be filled
 by more intensive collection efforts in the field. Whatever assistance
 the field can offer, intelligence analysts at home will bend their efforts
 to initiate research in the areas indicated to the end that successive
 revisions of the estimate become more convincing approximations to
 reality.

 for radical changes.  In the postwar period, the National Intelligence
 Estimate has given intelligence a stature greater than it ever had
 before. . More than any other intelligence publication it has promoted
 the acceptance of national intelligence as an essential ingredient of
 national policy.
 CURRENT-INTELLIGENCE REPORTS
 As constant crisis becomes the standard feature of the international
 scene, the urgent need by policymakers to keep abreast of day-to-day
 developments makes increasing demands on national intelligence.
 These demands are met by the media of current-intelligence produc-
 tion, which are not far removed from those employed by American
 journalism to report current events.
 1. Raw intelligence. This is equivalent to the radio or television
 announcement, "We interrupt this program to report that the USSR
 has just announced the first successful launching of an artificial satel-
 lite that is orbiting around the earth.  Keep tuned to this station for
 further details." When the watch officer on duty in a current-intelli-
 gence office during the small hours of the early morning receives
 information of such import that he believes it should be passed quickly
 to higher officials, he will do so without interpretive analysis.  He
 may also explain that the desk analyst is being called in and that
 interpretive comment will follow shortly.  The alerting of high
 officials by the rapid dispatch of vital information-with or without
 analysis-is an essential function of the current-intelligence office.
 2. The written memorandum.  This format is employed for
 analyses which are not conveniently accommodated in: regularly
 scheduled publications.  One reason is that of time: The daily pub-
 lication has been "put to bed"; it is too late to rerun the presses, but
 high officials must have the information and commentary before
 them as quickly as possible.  The written memorandum also serves
 as the outlet for the analyst who wishes to advance a thesis that may
 be too speculative for formal publication but nevertheless deserves
 consideration.  Sometimes, when there are differences of view among
 analysts of an agency, the interchange of memoranda is a preliminary
 to the achievement of consensus.
 3. The oral briefing.  The oral briefing is frequently used to
 save time.  The desk analyst reads the intelligence information and
 hurries over to the higher official's office or home to give his quick
 estimate of its significance.  Sometimes oral briefings are regularly
 scheduled for the benefit of officials who like to get at problems
 through the person-to-person back and forth of question and answer.
 agency coordination required for the production of true national
 intelligence.  They rather present the point of view of a single
 office or analyst.  Intelligence produced on the national level appears
 in the formal publications.  Members of the National Security Coun-
 cil and other high officials, for example, receive copies of a daily
 report in whose production the various member departments and
 agencies of the intelligence community participate jointly.  This
 is the daily newspaper, so to speak, of the intelligence community,
 with the distinction that interpretative commentary is a more promi-
 nent feature of the intelligence publication than of the front pages of
 the news daily.  In the case of current intelligence, the pressures of
 time are frequently a handicap to the production of complete analyses
 on a coordinated interdepartmental basis, and policy officials find the
 analyses published by the individual agencies a valuable backup to the
 joint product.
 5. Other periodic publications.  The weekly, biweekly, and
 monthly current-intelligence publications, analogous to the magazine
 supplements of the large city daily, summarize and analyze recent
 events from. a vantage point which provides better perspective than is
 possible when writing for the daily publication.  Here, too, policy
 officials lean heavily on analyses produced by individual agencies.
 However, some standing committees of the United States Intelligence
 Board produce periodic publications containing the views of the in-
 telligence community as a whole on current-intelligence developments.
 6. The National Intelligence Estimate.  This format is employed
 not only for the long-range strategic estimate but, on occasion, for a
 "crash" estimate.  When current developments reach crisis propor-
 tions, the National Security Council or the United States Intelligence
 Board may direct that a National Intelligence Estimate be prepared
 quickly to present the consensus of the intelligence community.
 The outstanding characteristic of current-intelligence production is
 the demand it makes on the analyst for speed.  Like the newspaper-
 man, he must meet a publication deadline every day.  The cases in
 which he is called on to research in depth are rather the exception
 than the rule.  A large part of his activity consists of describing a
 development and commenting briefly on its significance, all perhaps
 within the limits of a single page.  He may, for example, report the
 resignation of North Vietnam's Lao Dong (Communist) Party sec-
 retary general.                                                                                         By way of comment, he may briefly give some bio-

 the resignation signifies loss of real power, indicate who of his asso-
 ciates may have suffered a loss of stature along with him, and suggest
 who is likely to benefit.  If the former secretary general was closely
 associated with certain policies of the regime, the analyst may offer
 some speculations on how these policies are likely to be modified.
 The analyst's comment has a twofold function : first, to provide the
 reader with the background (e.g., biographic data on the new secre-
 tary general) which will set the bare report in fuller perspective, and,
 second, to suggest what further developments may follow.  The
 backgrounds function is simple enough for the analyst who is on top
 of his job.  The premonitory function is of quite another order of
 difficulty; and the current-intelligence analysis, like the long-range
 strategic estimate, often proposes orders of probability rather than
 flat predictions.
 The library and reference service, which can be extensively
 employed by the researcher working on a long project, are of limited
 value to the current-intelligence analyst, who may have to prepare
 his comments within the hour.  He will possibly have time to phone
 other analysts in the intelligence community who might have infor-
 mation on the subject.  By and large, however, he is left largely on
 his own personal resources-the data he has accumulated in his imme-
 diate files and the knowledge in his head. The current-intelligence
 analyst must therefore be the substantive expert in his area.  He does
 not have time to learn while working on a project. He must rather
 bring the knowledge he already has to bear on his analysis.
 The necessity for quick analysis places a. premium not only on sub-
 stantive knowledge but also on verbal fluency. The current-intelli-
 gence analyst has to write well while writing quickly. The importance
 of writing aptitude is so high, in fact, that many senior officials prefer
 to hire as apprentice current-intelligence analysts young men with
 writing aptitude who will learn the substance of their fields rather
 than substantive specialists who have difficulty with verbalization.
 From the foregoing, it is apparent that the person who takes to
 current-intelligence analysis is continually sensitive to signs of change.
 Yet. he is uncomfortably aware that, like the financial analyst who does
 not identify a bull or bear market until it is under way for some time,
 he too will not often identify a trend at its very inception. Liberaliza-
 tion during 1956 in the Communist world was aborted following the
 Hungarian revolt and other demonstrations of popular unrest in
 Eastern Europe. The shift toward orthodoxy was all the more difficult
 to identify because of crosscurrents in the Communist camp. Mao-Tze-

 d fl
 stocks were sliding while the rails were still heading up, and it was
 hard to establish that a bear market was in the making. The acute
 analyst is the one who identifies the trend before the public at large
 does.
 The sixth sense which the current-intelligence analyst hopes will
 quickly tell him the direction of developments is a compound of
 background knowledge and constant scanning for significant details.
 The failure of important officials to make public appearances is the
 classic if overworked example of the information the current-intel-
 ligence analyst is constantly on watch for. If a new politburo and
 central committee has just been elected, he is quick to note the order
 in which the members are listed. He is, more than other analysts, the
 slave to his in-box. For his work is never to miss what is happening
 now, and always to explain what is happening now in the light of
 what happened before and as an augury of what will happen later.

 PAST FAILURES OF CURRENT INTELLIGENCE
 Postmortems reviewing past failures of current intelligence fre-
 quently show that the weaknesses lay not so much in the unavailability
 of information as in faulty analysis. "It is often harder," Allen Dulles
 has said, "to use the product than to get it." A case in point is the
 Rundstedt Raid of December 1944, when the Germans launched an
 attack with 24 infantry and armored divisions on a 50-mile front to
 a depth of 60 miles. Sufficient information was collected prior to the
 assault to show that extensive German preparations were under way,
 and intelligence at the Army level did in fact predict the attack several
 days in advance. Intelligence at higher levels, however, reversed the
 judgment, concluding that the Germans were most probably only
 strengthening their defensive positions.   -
 On some occasions, the failure of current intelligence was attribut-
 able to the failure to convince policymakers.  Stalin, for example,
 took a consistently negative attitude toward reports indicating an im-
 minent German attack in 1941.  Hitler, similarly, ignored forewarn-
 ings of the Anglo-American landing in North Africa.
 The most disastrous failure of current intelligence in U.S. history
 was the unexpectedness of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
 Here, again, there appears in hindsight to have been sufficient infor-
 mation available to alert intelligence officers and policy officials.
 There was, however, no full appreciation of the significance of the
 information.  There was, further, a failure to get the intelligence in-
 formation to all the quarters that should have had it.  It was known,
 Approved For Release 2004/06/24: CIA-RDP78-03584R000100070001-7
 known in early December that the Japanese Embassy in Washington
 had been ordered to burn its communications codes.  It was known
 that Tokyo had told its diplomats in Washington that a deadline had
 been set for the completion of negotiations with the United States.
 It was known that the Japanese were continuing negotiations in
 Washington in early December for the purpose of averting American
 suspicions.  It was known that Japanese military doctrine set great
 store on the virtue of surprise attack.  It was, however, the general
 assessment in Washington that Japanese military action, if it came,
 would be in the Far East.  It was, moreover, not deemed necessary
 to keep the military commands in Hawaii fully apprised of the intelli-
 gence information collected.  As a consequence, there was no appre-
 ciation in Hawaii of the ominous significance of developments just
 prior to the attack on 7 December, such as the entry of a two-man sub-
 marine in prohibited waters off Pearl Harbor and the appearance of
 unidentified planes on the Army radar screen.
 Pearl Harbor impressed many intelligence analysts with the need
 for developing a doctrine for identifying the symptoms of impending
 attack. A study of past wars, together with some introspection on
 logical courses of action in future wars, will soon suggest to any
 thoughtful person some likely symptoms : instructions to burn codes,
 withdrawal of financial reserves held in foreign banks, recall of mer-
 chant shipping to home ports, official warnings that specified acts will
 be followed by retaliation, callup of military reserves, accelerated
 stockpiling of strategic materials, intensification of vituperative
 propaganda, to name a few of the more obvious symptoms.  None of
 these are essential preliminaries to an attack, and all of them may
 appear without necessarily presaging hostilities.  Their appearance,
 however, must serve as an automatic alert to the intelligence
 community.
 The sophisticated analysis of these symptoms requires also a recog-
 nition of evidence which points to the continuation of peace : the de-
 posit of funds abroad, demobilization of armed forces, withdrawal of
 troops from frontiers, cessation of bellicose propaganda, to name a
 few examples.  The analyst here has to be on guard against deliberate
 deception. While a break in the diplomatic negotiations between the
 United States and Japan before Pearl Harbor would have been a sug-
 gestive symptom of early hostilities, the continuation of the talks was
 hardly reassurance to the contrary.  It rather represented Tokyo's
 The watch for symptoms-or indications, to use the favored termi-
 nology-has virtually become a specialization within the current-
 intelligence specialty.  The indications approach is a counterbalance
 to the expert's predisposition to reject deviations from known trends
 until new trends have been firmly established. This is a predisposition
 which is likely to be reinforced by the experience that such an expert
 turns out more often to be right than wrong, just as the weatherman
 in many climates can be more often right than wrong if he always
 predicts today's weather for tomorrow.. Unfortunately, the analyst
 who is unconsciously given to this sort of pragmatism is most likely to
 be wrong when it is most important to be right. The responsible area
 analyst values the stimulus of the indications specialist who is disposed
 by his function to wild surmises and, like a Socratic gadfly, forces the
 expert to examine carefully-not cavalierly to explain away-each
 new symptom of impending hostilities.
 The area analyst's particular contribution, in turn, derives from his
 expert knowledge of background evidence outside of pure indications
 intelligence. Intensification of civil-defense training, for example, is
 susceptible to offensive or defensive interpretation.  The preferred
 interpretation will depend in large part on considerations of setting
 and milieu : Would opposition political parties stand behind the gov-
 ernment in a war situation? Are economic-development objectives a
 discouragement to military adventures at this time? Does the country
 enjoy the full backing of its allies?
 Indications analysis is in large part a constant watch for the steps,
 short of war readiness, which a country must take to be ready to
 strike. Its usefulness diminishes insofar as the country in question is
 already on a war footing in a situation of constant crisis. Its limita-
 tions are particularly obvious in small areas of localized tension,
 where the capabilities for attack are complete and only the decision to
 attack is in question. Despite these shortcomings, indications analysis
 must be pursued as a necessary guard, though hardly a guarantee,
 against another Pearl Harbor. A considerable part of the national-
 intelligence effort, therefore, is devoted to the watch for symptoms of
 imminent hostilities.

 The mechanism for integrating departmental opinions on the sig-
 nificance of these symptoms into a national-intelligence analysis is
 provided by the Watch Committee, one of the standing committees of
 the United States Intelligence Board.  At Watch Committee sessions,

 tilities observed since the previous meeting is considered and a con-
 clusion reached regarding its bearing on national security. The
 conclusions, published in a report as the consensus of the intelligence
 community, represent as authoritative a determination of prospects
 in the coming days as is the National Intelligence Estimate of longer
 range prospects.
 Working under the Watch Committee on a round-the-clock basis
 is the National Indications Center, composed of indications special-
 ists from the various departments and agencies. The center is the
 constant recipient from the departments and agencies of all intelli-
 gence suggestive of possible hostile intent, together with their evalu-
 ations. This intelligence is collated in the center as a basis for the
 agenda of the next Watch Committee meeting.  In addition, the
 center engages in continual analysis of its own based on its long
 experience with indications patterns in past crises.
 The machinery for current-intelligence production, including indi-
 cations analysis, reflects the ever-growing appreciation of the need
 for advance warning. The machinery is yet to be tested fully, but
 it has been called on to function in recent "flap" situations (Suez and
 the Chinese offshore-island crises, for example). The importance of
 its assigned role in national intelligence is not seriously questioned in
 an age when the time required between the launching of an attack
 and the delivery of the blow is being steadily compressed. Under these
 circumstances there is little alternative to the development of tech-
 niques that will provide all possible forewarnings of decisions to
 strike.

 is slow to change but not changeless. Like the World Almanac and
 the Encyclopaedia Britannica, basic-intelligence handbooks must be
 periodically revised. By and large, however, basic intelligence is rela-
 tively stable because it is largely descriptive and comparatively static
 rather than reportorial or premonitory in content. Its time range is
 from past to present,, in contradistinction to current and estimative
 intelligence, which is vitally concerned with the present and likely
 developments in the immediate or longer range future. This is not
 to say that basic intelligence is devoid of analysis. Like the better
 encyclopedias, it also interprets the data it presents.
 In modern times, basic intelligence has been called upon to make
 valued contributions to military planning, and most European coun-
 tries have long supported a considerable basic-intelligence effort.

 book suggests some of the general areas of study which basic intelli-
 gence encompasses.

 The most critical gap in American intelligence during the planning
 of operations against the Gilbert Islands in 1943 was the lack of pre-
 cise hydrographic data. The available charts were so out of date and
 inaccurate as to be worse than useless. Tide tables were extremely
 sketchy. Yet information on the surrounding waters was vital to the
 success of the proposed amphibious operations, which would involve
 decisions on such matters as the best type of landing craft to get the
 troops ashore with minimum danger of capsizing or grounding. The
 intelligence gap was never satisfactorily filled, and a considerable part
 of the heavy casualty list on Tarawa was attributable to the inability
 of landing craft to traverse the reefs off the landing beaches. The

 for example, were equipped with so-called peace handbooks, which
 summarized the ethnic, economic, and political problems of the areas
 which were to be affected by the redemarcation of new frontiers. The
 texts of treaties and other state documents were also included in the
 handbooks. All the trouble spots of the continent were examined in
 historical perspective-Alsace-Lorraine, Silesia, the Dardanelles.
 Similar background studies, in varying degrees of detail, were also
 available to delegates from other countries. Their preparation before
 all international conferences is essential if the delegates are to be
 equipped to discuss the issues intelligently. It is hard to imagine, for
 example, a disarmament conference whose delegates did not come
 forearmed with basic intelligence regarding the armed-forces strength
 of the other countries in both men and equipment, the positions of
 these countries on disarmament issues in past conferences, signs of
 softening or stiffening of their national policies, and the prevailing
 military doctrines that would affect their preferences for one sort of
 arms limitation rather than another.
 Basic-intelligence handbooks also served in postwar periods as aids
 to military-government personnel charged with administering the
 peace in occupied countries. Though the content of these books was
 not far removed from the content of those employed to aid military
 strategy, they served dissimilar ends. Railroads, ports, and industrial
 installations were now studied, not as targets for attack but for their
 serviceability to occupying forces and for their essentiality to the
 occupied economy.  Military-government handbooks took note of
 popular sensibilities that should not be offended rather than popular
 characteristics that might be exploited for social subversion.
 The amount of basic intelligence accumulated over recent years is
 so large that only a part of it is contained in formal studies. The files
 of the intelligence community's central reference services are mines of
 information that can be collated on an as-needed basis. Electronic
 data-processing methods have blurred the distinction between the
 cards of the central reference services and so-called finished intelli-
 gence. For, within the day, the cards can be run and rerun to yield
 printed listings with accompanying descriptive data of personalities
 and major industrial targets for military attack, to name but two of
 many possibilities.
 The advantage of maintaining basic intelligence in a form that
 lends itself to automatic data processing is the ease of continuous
 revision.  The listing of powerplants, municipal utilities, pipelines,
 mines, celestial observatories, etc., contain all the data known to
 date not merel the information available to the time the last hand-
 are called for, as, for example, in studies of social and psychological
 characteristics.
 The battle for Tarawa was one of several occasions which high-
 lighted America's lack of foresight before World War II in failing
 to build up its basic-intelligence library.  In the early war planning
 for North African operations, American officers had fortunate access
 to ISIS (Inter-Service Intelligence Studies), the coordinated basic-
 intelligence studies of the British.  It became apparent that a similar
 effort was needed for Pacific operations, and, at the President's direc-
 tion, the Joint Chiefs of Staff created a Joint Intelligence Study
 Publishing Board to produce the so-called JANIS (Joint Army-Navy
 Intelligence Studies). The JANIS volumes provided officials and
 intelligence research analysts toward the end of the war with detailed
 information on the historical, geographic, political, economic, mili-
 tary, and sociological backgrounds of the areas studied.
 The JANIS volumes were a wartime stopgap.  It was widely real-
 ized that basic intelligence must be produced in peacetime and be kept
 revised and ready for use in a national emergency.  In addition the
 qualified character of the postwar peace heightened the general recep-
 tivity to a basic-intelligence effort that would serve nonmilitary opera-
 tions such as propaganda, foreign-aid planning, and economic
 warfare.  In 1948 the National Security Council authorized publi-
 cation of a basic-intelligence series called the National Intelligence
 Survey (NIS).
 As in the case of a National Intelligence Estimate, members of the
 intelligence community contribute chapters in their special fields of
 competence to the National Intelligence Survey for each geographic
 area. The Army, for example, is responsible for covering terrain
 features; the Navy, for ports and harbors.  The Central Intelligence
 Agency is responsible for coordination, editing, publication, and dis-
 semination of the surveys.  General policy and requirements with
 respect to the NIS program are set by the National Intelligence
 Survey Committee, a standing committee of the United States Intelli-
 gence Board.
 The agency contributions to an NIS are, in most cases, organically
 separable and can be published separately rather than integrated into
 a composite production like the National Intelligence Estimate.  In

 that characterizes the National Intelligence Estimate process.  Simi-
 larly, when the surveys are revised, the revisions are edited and pub-
 lished subject by subject. For affording basic intelligence which is
 as up to date as possible, this procedure has clear advantages over any
 that would delay publication of the entire NIS until all contributions
 were in.
 Since the NIS series was inaugurated, comprehensive digests of
 basic intelligence have been prepared and published, subject by
 subject, for each of the major countries and most of the lesser
 countries of the world.  The uses to which the surveys are put
 are varied.  Intelligence trainees find them excellent for orientation
 in their new areas of responsibility.  Diplomats study them with
 equal profit prior to their departure for new posts abroad.  Analysts
 refer frequently to the surveys for ready answers to spot questions.
 (What gauge are the rail lines on Shikoku?)  Military officers
 employ the surveys as standard references in the formulation of war
 plans. At the NSC level, the surveys are not studied in all their
 detail, but chapters giving an overview of a country have proved serv-
 iceable to high officials.
 IV
 SUBJECT-MATTER SPECIALIZATION
 National intelligence is a synthesis.  It is compounded of informa-
 tion from virtually all the academic disciplines-sociology, history,
 geography, economics, political science, military philosophy, the
 natural sciences, and others. Intelligence officers are ordinarily spe-
 cialists in one of these categories, although they may be competent
 in more than one if their responsibilities happen to be limited to
 small geographic areas.  Even in the latter case, it is rare for high
 competence in the social sciences to extend to the military and nat-
 ural sciences as well, so that specialization by subject category is as
 much the rule in intelligence today as it is in the academic world.
 National Security Council directives have established the respon-
 sibilities of each of the organizations in the intelligence community for
 producing the various subject categories of intelligence.  Over the
 years, these categories have become differentiated by specialized tech-
 niques of collection and production.
 Peace, to turn an aphorism from Clausewitz, is in some lights a
 continuation of war by other means. The military strategy and tac-
 tics of wartime give way to the political policy and maneuver of
 peacetime, and political intelligence comes into its own in the councils
 of the country's highest officials.
 One of the principal handicaps of the political intelligence officer
 is the difficulty of quantifying his data.  Economic intelligence may
 not be the more accurate for its statistics of production and com-
 merce.  Military intelligence may be in error despite the pretensions
 to exactness in its arithmetical magnitudes of estimated troop
 strength.  But accurate or erroneous, they provide numerical orders
 of strength and weakness.  Estimates dealing with political dynam-
 ics, by contrast, deal with the immeasurable and the imponderable;
 the policymaker must accept intelligence which lacks the precision
 he would like.  Peasant attitudes may be described as apathetic or
 sullen, and no fine measures may be available to suggest the degree

 party and government positions, his resignations, illnesses, trips, and
 notes on his presence or absence at public functions. No unusual ana-
 lytical abilities are required to handle the compilation of such data.
 It is a job of typing and filing, cutting and pasting.  The trained
 biographical analyst, however, is several cuts above a clerk-typist.
 Hardly content with a who's-who enumeration of skeletal facts, he
 endeavors to portray the rounded man-character, ambitions, opin-
 ions, weaknesses, friends, relatives, and particular allegiances in the
 network of cliques that may cut across the formal structure of party
 and government.  He is prepared, of course, to give World Almanac
 answers to such questions as "Who is currently secretary of the Afro-
 Asian Solidarity Committee?"  But he also stands ready to include
 premonitory elements in his report-the nature of the policies to be
 expected from de Gaulle, for example, in the light of what the French
 leader himself has said and of other information compiled about him.
 Useful as are the dossiers of middle-ranking personalities against
 the day when one of them emerges into the front rank, biographic
 intelligence also needs to speculate beforehand on the likely suc-
 cessors to top leadership.  Who will follow the aging Mao Tse-tung
 as the leader of Communist China?  While the element of conjecture
 here is considerable, it is limited at least by the fairly narrow slate
 of likely candidates-say, the membership of the politburo, or, nar-
 rower still, of the politburo's inner circle known as the standing com-
 mittee.  The principal difficulty is that, while the candidates are few,
 the outcome may hinge on the distribution of their supporters in the
 rest of the politburo, the central committee, and perhaps other organs
 of the party.  Biographic intelligence must, therefore, determine who
 is likely to support whom.  Known friendships, family ties, or pre-
 sumptive obligations resulting from sponsor-protege relationships
 in past jobs are necessary elements in the analysis. A careful study
 of public remarks may be useful.  Which members of the central
 committee seem invariably to echo Chou En-lai's statements on major
 issues?  Which seem to incline to Liu Shao-chi's phrases?  The im-
 ponderables loom large in such an estimate, but the issue is too im-
 portant to forego analysis.
 tured equipment often yield prolific data during hostilities.  Informa-
 tion passed openly to military attaches and others is no adequate sub-
 stitute during peace.
 A large part of the man-hours expended in a military-intelligence
 organization goes into the pick-and-shovel work needed to uncover
 the organization and administration of the foreign military services.
 The result should be a knowledge of the military structure from the
 ministry level down through the various levels of territorial and tacti-
 cal organization.  If the information available is fairly complete, the
 intelligence organization will come up with a reasonably good picture
 of the relationships among the high commands; the division of the
 country into corps areas, fleet commands, air commands; the location
 and function of unit headquarters, depots, airfields, and other instal-
 lations; numbers and distribution of personnel; and weapons, vehicles,
 and other equipment.
 The compilation of the aforementioned data will delineate the anat-
 omy, so to speak, of a foreign military establishment in its physical
 setting.  To some extent, this enumeration of tangible specifics will
 throw light on the effectiveness of the armed forces.  But to round out
 the picture, attention must also be directed to the intangibles. This
 necessitates, for example, an evaluation of morale, of training meth-
 ods, and of tactical and strategic doctrine.  Methods and doctrine will
 be considered as they bear on the employment of particular weapons
 and on the employment, singly and jointly, of the various arms and
 services.  In the purview of the evaluation will also come practice and
 principles relating to reconnaissance, river crossings, guerrilla war-
 fare, airborne operations, surprise attack, and civil defense.
 Intelligence on logistics requires a consideration of tangibles and
 intangibles combined.  Requirements for rations, fuel, ammunition,
 medical supplies, and other materiel must be computed.  Calculations
 must be made of the number of trains, ships, trucks, aircraft, and other
 transport units needed to move men and equipment under given cir-
 cumstances.  Requirements must be matched against assets, with ap-
 propriate consideration of vulnerability to interdiction.

 tion was not precisely known.  The launchers of ballistic missiles
 must know exact locations on a planet that is still imperfectly mapped.
 These and related problems have brought geographic intelligence far
 beyond the limits that Moses set in 1500 B.C. when he sent his spies-
 into the land of Canaan : "Go up into the mountain and see the land,
 what it is." The geographic intelligence office that studies "the land,
 what it is" today is abreast of developments in geodesy, oceanography,
 climatology, gravimetry.
 GEOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE'
 The geographic intelligence officer works in macrocosm and micro-
 cosm. His study may encompass an analysis of the entire Soviet
 Arctic.  It may, on the other hand, require a description of a small
 town in the Communist bloc-down to lining up each building, detail-
 ing the number of floors, and giving the postal addresses.
 Some of the data that the geographic intelligence officer would like
 to have for his studies are closely held by foreign governments. Much
 of his work, however, consists in collating open source materials.
 The quality of the work depends in considerable measure on the re-
 sources of the map libraries that geographic intelligence maintains.
 With the help thus of open source and classified materials alike,
 geographic intelligence is informed on topographical features (e.g.,
 relief, landforms, drainage patterns), and it understands which areas
 offer the weakest natural defenses against assault.  It has informa-
 tion on weather and climate (temperature, precipitation, clouds, fog,
 humidity, and winds) and can say when typhoons would be a menace
 to say Chinese Communist amphibious operations again Taiwan.  Its
 data on urban areas are adequate for estimates of defensibility and
 trafficability (street patterns, types of building construction, location
 of utilities and other vital installations, and distribution of popula-
 tion).  It has compiled information on coasts and landing beaches,
 including tidal data, gradients, underwater slopes and obstructions.
 Its studies of railways spurs and other features of the transport
 system contribute to knowledge of probable missile site locations.
 Geographic intelligence often has to map and describe the loca-
 tional patterns of disidence, religious affiliation, and other social
 characteristics bearing on the political reliability of populations.  To
 serve officials who are deciding on a policy position with respect to
 an international boundary dispute (e.g., on the Sino-Indian border),
 geographic intelligence will provide information on historical juris-
 dictions, natural watersheds, main lines of access, ethnic characteristics
 of local populations, and other relevant considerations.      Geographic
 intelligence assists economic intelligence officers by preparing land-use
 maps and studies, by showing major traffic and commodity flow pat-
 terns, and by detailing other locational factors (altitude, temperature,
 rainfall) that influence productive activity.
 As modern weapons extend their long reach, geographic intelligence
 finds frequent occasion to collaborate with scientific intelligence.  The
 There is some overlap in practice between scientific intelligence and
 technical intelligence, and it is convenient here to consider both to-
 gether.  Technical intelligence, as it is defined in the Dictionary of
 United States Military Terms for Joint Usage, concerns foreign tech-
 nological developments which have advanced to the point of having
 a practical application for war purposes.  Scientific intelligence covers
 technological developments also, but only up through the research and
 development phase.  In addition, its scope includes areas of research
 that transcend the strictly technological and the strictly military, e.g.,
 mathematics, medicine, solid-state physics, enzymology, radio astron-
 omy, and oceanography.  Technical intelligence is a responsibility of
 the military services.  Scientific intelligence may be collected and
 analyzed by other organizations, e.g., the Atomic Energy Commission.
 The growing importance of scientific and technical intelligence
 hardly needs to be labored in an age when national security is so
 closely related to advances in nuclear physics, rocketry, electronics,
 and medicine, to name only several of the fields marked by dramatic
 "breakthroughs" in recent years.  Even in the 19th century, the im-
 portance of technical intelligence was widely appreciated.  Some of
 the information which Dreyfus was unjustly accused of passing to the
 Germans dealt with the design of a new artillery-recoil mechanism.
 The widespread concern over enemy "secret weapons" at the begin-
 ning of World War II gave strong impetus to the expansion of scien-
 tific and technical intelligence in both the Axis and Allied powers.
 Reports in the files of British intelligence when the war began,
 for example, indicated German development activities on glid-
 ing bombs, pilotless aircraft, long-range guns, and rockets.  The war
 was less than a year old when the British became convinced that the
 Germans had developed radio beams for blind bombing.
 The discovery of the beams by the British is illustrative of the man-
 ner in which scientific intelligence frequently combines the usual
 sources of intelligence information (agent reports, overt publications,
 manned aircraft of World WarNApimYddeRDiDFe ll>    s2819"6i24 : CIA-RDP78-0 584I46bdgdg6gobow's for confirming the information.  In this
 Approved For Release 2004/06/24: CIA-RDP78-03584R000100070001-7
 case, the technical means involved the sending up of search
 aircraft, which detected the German beams in the expected place and
 at the expected frequency.  German aircraft, with receivers ostensibly
 designed for blind landings, had been able to fly over the British Isles
 at night and drop their bombs at the intersection of the beams on pre-
 selected targets.  After the British uncovered the beams, however,
 they were able to jam them and confuse the German night bombers.
 The spotting of German radar stations again illustrates the combi-
 nation of technical and traditional methods of intelligence collection.
 Photo reconnaissance and the radio detection of radar stations while
 they were transmitting uncovered most of the coastal radar.  In the.
 case of the inland transmitters, the British could determine general
 locations by taking radio bearings.  Agents were then directed to
 pinpoint the inland stations, after which further details were obtained
 by photo reconnaissance.  By these methods, British intelligence
 located more than 740 German radar stations on the continent, leaving
 not more than 6 to be uncovered by the ground forces after D-Day.

 equipped with afterburners and to estimate how much thrust augmen-
 tation the afterburners provide.  It may also be possible to estimate
 the weight and unaugmented thrust of the engine.
 The covert collection of scientific and technical intelligence is handi-
 capped by the extraordinary secrecy that surrounds the obvious
 targets of the clandestine services.  To aggravate the difficulty, the
 secret agent who is also a trained scientist (a Klaus Fuchs or a Bruno
 Pontecorvo) is a rare find.  When the combination occurs in one pelTAT
 son, he can, of course, be of outstanding value.

 at 80 tons.  British scientific intelligence, on the other hand, relying
 in part on reports from agents and prisoners indicating liquid oxygen
 to be one of the fuels, came up with the much more accurate estimate
 of 12 tons.
 Where technical methods of detection are successful, the scientific-
 intelligence officer is greatly assisted in his analysis.  Technical de-
 tection, however, is often short of bein all-informative.
 In the ma-
 jority of such cases, the scientific-intelligence officer labors under the
 standard uncertainties, which will not be resolved by the experimental
 and laboratory techniques of the natural sciences.  He rests his analy-
 sis on attache reports, agent disclosures, propaganda announcements,
 and the other standard sources.  He evaluates the information re-
 ceived for consistency with other known facts.                       His conclusions are
 compounded from imponderables, not the measurables he worked with
 in his academic training.
 The scientific-intelligence officer, though he relies heavily on his
 academic training in the natural sciences, thus finds himself approach-
 ing his work in the manner of an investigator in the social sciences.
 There is indeed no substitute for this approach when the matter under
 consideration relates to people and institutions.  The organization of
 the Academy of Sciences, the curricula of engineering colleges, the
 number of annual graduates from technical schools, the transfers of
 missile technicians to other localities-these are subjects which the
 scientific-intelligence officer handles with techniques that are common
 to intelligence analysis generally.
 The very speed of technological advance necessitates ever greater
 emphasis on scientific intelligence in this century.  Scientific intelli-
 gence will play a role which is trying enough when both the United
 States and another country have developed a new weapon and Amer-
 ican experience can serve as a guide in estimating lines of further
 advance by the other country. The role is likely to be most critical
 when the United States is still unsuccessful while a foreign country
 has succeeded.  For the prevailing image is of American technological
 supremacy, all but the most incontrovertible facts about foreign
 levels of achievement being received with widespread skepticism.  In
 It is the magnitude, structure, and rate of growth of foreign econo-
 mies as they can contribute to military power-economic potential
 for war-that perhaps occasions the primary interest in economic
 intelligence.  The decisive influence of American economic superiority
 in the outcomes of World War I and World War II gave rise to a
 prevailing thesis that a country's success in war depends above all on
 its conversion of economic resources to combat power.  The all-im-
 portant analysis, in this view, draws not from intelligence of forces in
 being but of the economic-mobilization base-manpower, stockpiles,
 and productive capacity over and above what must be drawn down
 for essential civilian requirements.
 With the rise of nuclear power, this view has been called into ques-
 tion. As some analysts envisage the probabilities, forces in being
 must be the primary determinant in deciding the outcome of all-out
 nuclear conflict; economic potential for sustaining hostilities is irrele-
 vant in a setting where the mobilization base is doomed to quick ex-
 tinction.  Insofar as nuclear capabilities are a deterrent to all-out
 war, hostilities are envisaged on the Korean War pattern, which do
 not call for the total involvement of the economic-mobilization base.
 Whatever the merits of this viewpoint, complete destruction beyond
 recovery of the mobilization base is not universally accepted as a cer-
 tainty in all-out conflict.  In any case economic potential for war need
 not be equated with the theoretical capabilities of the mobilization
 base at a given time after D-Day.  It can be related as well to the eco-
 nomic base a country is building to support necessary forces in being
 before the outbreak of an all-out or limited war.  When defense pro-
 duction in peacetime has to be on a wartime scale, the economic
 potential for supporting war, or at least a war posture, must remain a
 central concern of economic intelligence.
 The analysis of
 economic potential for war consists largely in the
 derivation of measures of a nation's capabilities to supply, munitions
 and military personnel.  The measures may be specific or aggregative.
 Examples of specific measures are shipbuilding capacity, manpower
 of military age, and petroleum production.  The aggregative measures
 relate to the economy as a whole or to broad sectors of the economy;
 e.g., indexes of overall industrial production.  A discussion of these
 measures will illustrate the elements entering into economic-intelli-
 gence analysis of war potential.

 were the great powers of an earlier era are under particular disad-
 vantages today in having to look outside their borders for so much
 of their raw-material requirements.  In addition to mineral resources,
 the analysis of war potential must consider agricultural resources.
 Japan's stature as a great power was supported before World War
 II by her ability to command food imports from Taiwan and the
 Asian mainland.  Her insufficiency of food would be a serious weak-
 ness in another war.
 Shortages in natural resources can be ameliorated, for a time at
 least, by stockpiles.  Estimates of stockpiles must, therefore, be in-
 cluded in computations of resource availabilities as matched against
 requirements.  Economic-intelligence analyses also give recognition
 to substitutes in such calculations-synthetic in place of natural rub-
 ber, for example, or plastics in place of short-supply metals.
 2. Manpower.       The size of armies is the roughest sort of index
 to military power, but it has served reasonably well as a point of de-
 parture in analysis. The smallest countries cannot have large armies
 for lack of manpower. The economically backward countries cannot
 have large armies for lack of means to support them. With more
 than three times the population of the United States in World War
 II, China put into the field less than half the men mobilized in the
 American Armed Forces. It is the large, industrially advanced coun-
 tries that can mobilize the biggest armies in wartime.
 Calculations of manpower availabilities rest, first, on estimates of
 the total population, classified by age and sex. Men of military age
 constitute a crucial component of this estimate.  Health character-
 istics of the population are also considered in determining availability
 for military service.  Labor productivity is a factor in estimating
 civilian labor-force requirements; the lower the productivity, the
 greater the number that must be kept in the fields and factories. The
 training and education of the labor force are further factors which
 limit both the production and utilization of modern weapons. The
 calculations invariably allow for additions to the labor force in war-
 time of women, schoolchildren, and retired persons who would nor-
 mally be outside the labor market.
 3. Industrial capacities.  War-potential estimates rest in largest
 part on calculations of specific industrial capacities-steel ingot, ma-
 chine tools, electronic equipment, airplanes, electric power, shipbuild-
 ing, munitions, motor vehicles, and others. Degrees of superiority or
 inferiority are, of course, not shown by mere summations of capaci-
 ties.  In their finest detail, estimates will show the proportion of
 The production statistics published by foreign governments are a
 major source of estimates of industrial capacity.. In recent years,
 many Communist governments have found their propaganda purposes
 well served by releasing more detailed statistics of economic achieve-
 ments and of projections under 5- and 7-year plans. Economic intel-
 ligence may have to make its own adjustments to these figures, but
 they serve as starting points in analysis.
 On sectors of the economy for which statistics are not released-
 airplane production, for example-economic intelligence must employ
 more indirect methods.  Order-of-battle and table-of-equipment in-
 formation on the air force may provide one basis for an estimate. A
 listing of known factories with production for each calculated from
 facts known about plant size, number of employees, or other informa-
 tion may provide the basis for another estimate. If the differences
 between estimates are not too large, economic intelligence can settle
 on an approximation.
 4. Transportation.  In 1904 an analysis limited to a consideration
 of resources, manpower, and industrial capacity would have come up
 with a higher war potential for Russia than for Japan. But Russia
 was decisively defeated because she was not able to bring her power
 to bear in the theater where the contest was decided, the Far East. As
 this illustration must immediately suggest, comparisons of war poten-
 tial are meaningful only for given assumptions about the character
 and locale of the hostilities.  China's potential relative to that of
 Brazil for a war in the Far East is of one order; for a war in Latin
 America, it is of quite another order.
 Transportation constitutes a critical element in assessing a nation's
 potential for war in a specific theater. The completion in 1953 by
 Communist China of a railroad to the Indochina border considerably
 enhanced the Vietminh capabilities against the French. Its greatly
 expanded merchant marine in World War II enabled the United
 States to carry its struggle against the Axis powers to two distant,
 widely separated fronts.
 The analysis of transport capacities entails the consideration of
 such elements as rolling stock (number, type, and size), tonnage of
 shipping, motor vehicles, speeds, downtimes for maintenance, turn-
 around times, and port and terminal facilities.  In localized wars,
 none of these elements may be limiting, and the analysis may turn on
 the carrying capacity of a specific rail line (so many tons each way per
 day), assuming the diversion of rolling stock from other areas of the
 country.

 military goods and services is ostensibly building up its military
 strength the fastest. On the other hand the amount a country is able
 to spend on entertainment and other luxury consumption is hardly
 to be ignored; it represents effort that can be diverted to war produc-
 tion after mobilization.  It is perhaps the gross national product
 exclusive of the amount needed for essential civilian requirements
 that affords the best measure of a country's ability to produce war
 goods and services in an emergency situation.  The problem is to
 determine essential civilian requirements. Generally economies with
 high gross national products per capita are geared to high civilian
 requirements.  This does not mean merely that citizens with high
 living standards resist deprivations that the poor in other countries
 will countenance. The very structure of advanced economies entails
 higher allowances for civilian requirements.  Where homes, for
 example, are fairly distant from factories, more gasoline must be set
 aside for getting people to and from their jobs than is the case where
 people live within walking or bicycling distance of their work.
 The rate of growth is often an important factor in the consideration
 of gross national product. Since World War II, the war potential of
 the U.S.S.R. has tended to rise with the increase in its gross national
 product. Countries with high rates of growth commonly have high
 rates of savings and investment.  This means that diversion of re-
 sources to the military sector will probably necessitate deep cuts in
 investment funds so that the war effort will entail a sacrifice of high-
 priority development programs.
 WARTIME ECONOMIC INTELLIGENCE
 Modern military strategy addresses itself only in part to direct
 destruction of opposing armies. To weaken the economic base of the
 enemy has become a primary design in the prosecution of wars. Long-
 range bombers have to seek out the most important targets in the
 enemy's economy. Ground forces press toward key industrial centers.
 Naval vessels cut off essential imports. When war comes, economic
 intelligence is called on to play a central role in support of the military
 effort.
 The importance of economic intelligence in wartime has grown
 as the technology of war has enhanced capabilities to reach behind
 the front lines.  The airplane brought war to the factories, and
 economic intelligence has had to supply the most profitable targets.
 This has necessitated the compilation of target dossiers-files of
 factories, refineries, and other installations, with the number of em-
 ployees, types of products, and other pertinent information. Vary-
 ing orders of priority have lhAA pvo> ediFer ? el a  12QO4 G6,fl4st CIA-ROP78

 SUBJECT-MATTER SPECIALIZATION     61
 obviously going to those whose destruction would cause the most
 serious damage to the enemy's war effort. The factors entering into
 the determination of priorities are several. Are substitutes available?
 If so, destruction of the plant is not so damaging as it would otherwise
 be. Are stockpiles available to be drawn on while a plant is being
 repaired? Or will foreign sources of supply make up for bomb losses?
 If so, again the plant is not so choice a target. What is the position
 of the target in the industrial process? Destruction of a spark-plug
 factory will not ordinarily affect motor-vehicle production so directly
 as would destruction of the auto plant itself. What is the position
 with respect to excess capacity?  Where factories are not fully
 utilized, increased production in one will readily make up for the
 destruction of another.
 When the wrong targets are bombed, the losses to the enemy may be
 matched by compensating benefits. The British air bombardment
 of Hamburg in the summer of 1943 laid waste a third of the city,
 but the industrial plants escaped serious damage. The result was the
 end of a serious labor shortage in the city as store clerks, garage at-
 tendants, shopkeepers, and others turned from their bombed-out places
 of employment to the war industries. War production in Hamburg
 quickly returned to normal.
 Apart from its direct support of military operations, economic
 intelligence in wartime must make its contributions to recurrent
 strategic estimates designed to inform the Nation's top officials how
 well the enemy is doing, how long he may be expected to hold out,
 and what negotiation appeals he may be most responsive to.  The
 subjects of economic intelligence here are pretty much the same as
 those described in the preceding section-manpower, industrial pro-
 duction, stockpile reserves, trade, finance, and gross national product.
 The methods of collection and analysis remain much the sam , o1-
 although published statistics may be less accessible in wartime.                                                                                             On

 Economic pressures on the enemy during war (embargo, preclusive
 buying, and freezing of funds, for example) constitute a standard
 supplement to military attacks.  Economic warfare, in addition, is
 also applied in situations short of formal war in order to reduce the
 capabilities of unfriendly nations for aggression.
 Economic intelligence has had a close historical relationship to
 economic warfare.  In Britain, the Ministry of Economic Warfare
 served as the economic-intelligence agency at the beginning of World
 War II.  In the United States the newly created Board of Economic
 Warfare was charged with responsibility for economic intelligence.

 2. Blacklists.  Merchants in neutral countries discovered to be
 doing business with unfriendly countries may be black-listed, in which
 case exports to them and other business dealings are banned.  Eco-
 nomic intelligence is responsible for the compilation of dossiers, which
 give the names of merchant firms, their nominal officers, the actual
 ownership, connections with other companies, records of suspect trans-
 actions, and other pertinent information.
 3. Export controls.  In war an embargo is invariably imposed
 on all shipments to the enemy.  In other periods of international ten-
 sion, export controls are imposed on selected items.  Economic in-
 telligence is called on to assist in the selection of products whose
 export would be to the strategic advantage of unfriendly countries.
 This may involve a determination of those countries' legitimate civil-
 ian requirements, so that operating officials may impose quantitative
 controls on exports of the selected items in excess of those require-
 ments.
 4. Freezing of funds. When dollar assets of a foreign country
 are frozen, American banks are directed to permit no transactions in
 accounts owned by that country or its nationals.  Economic intelli-
 gence may provide information to show that certain firms have a
 beneficial interest in accounts apparently owned by others.  Swiss
 businessmen, operating in behalf of Germans, were the ostensible
 owners of sizable American dollar accounts in World War II.
 5. Sequestration of property.  Enemy nations may seek to cloak
 their ownership of properties, securities, and other assets abroad.
 Again, economic intelligence may give information showing the true
 ownership of these assets.
 6. Preclusive buying.  This operation involves the purchase of
 items for the sole purpose of preventing their procurement by the
 enemy.  The decision to undertake this expensive operation depends
 on a determination by economic intelligence that the product is in
 short supply and is extremely vital for enemy war production.  Pre-
 clusive buying of wolfram and ball bearings limited the availability
 of these products to the Germans in World War II.

 The elements that enter into a purely economic challenge are much
 the same elements considered in the section on war potential-man-
 power, outputs of specific industries, trade, finance, gross national
 product, and other measures of achievement. But the lines of
 analysis may take new directions.  Rates of growth assume unusual
 importance, since the Communist challenge of the cold war is the
 challenge to "catch up."  Changes in the composition of Soviet gross
 national product that reflect increases in the proportion of, say, resi-
 dential construction, take on the aspect of challenges to the West in
 the cold-war competition, whatever its significance for war-potential
 analysis.
 Economics in the cold war extends beyond the domestic scene,
 and economic intelligence follows with particular interest Commu-
 nist economic appeals to other countries.  Trade agreements have
 their implications for national-security interests; Peiping views its
 trade pacts with Free-World countries as opening wedges in its drive
 to win broader international recognition and eventual U.N. member-
 ship. Aid agreements have their political aspect.  Economic intelli-
 gence and political intelligence working together will assess the effects
 of Communist loans and grants on the bloc's prestige in the under-
 developed areas of Asia and Africa.
 The economic effects of American foreign policies are also the con-
 cern of economic intelligence.  Is American foreign aid to non-Com-
 munist governments truly conducive to economic development?  Or
 is it doing nothing better than just sustaining low living standards?
 Is it impelling a growth momentum that will make the recipient
 country independent of American economic support in the foreseeable
 future?
 These are the questions that concern economic intelligence in its
 many analyses in depth for national estimates and other studies and
 in its day-to-day current-intelligence reporting.  Its eye is, of course,
 always cocked for the menace of hostilities.  Economic indicators of
 possible hostilities, like withdrawals of foreign funds, receive careful
 scrutiny. War-potential analysis is far from neglected.  But eco-
 nomic intelligence is also alert to the economic stature of the bloc as
 a challenge quite independent of the military threat. As this stature
 looms larger, economic intelligence plays an increasingly vital role in
 keeping the Nation's top officials informed of the underlying forces
 that will decide the contest between East and West.
 INTELLIGENCE IN THE SPACE AGE
 National intelligence in the United States today represents the
 coordinated views of the intelligence community.  Despite the neces-
 sity of production on an interdepartmental level, national intelligence
 is being prepared with reasonable dispatch.  Moreover the experi-
 ence of the community with "flap" deadlines points to an intelligence
 machinery which can react to crisis situations faster than ever before
 in American history.  The procedures for achieving consensus, never-
 theless, do involve some minimum of personal discussions and group
 verbalization of issues. The human touch is unavoidable and places
 finite bounds on the speed with which national intelligence can be
 prepared.  Is this speed adequate to needs of an age which is obsessed
 with the dangers of surprise attack by intercontinental weapons that
 may be delivered within minutes of their launching?
 The answer requires a clarification of the relation between early
 warning and the intelligence process.  The Watch Committee and
 National Indications Center may apprise the President of signs sug-
 gesting preparations to launch missiles against the United States.
 But when the missiles have left their pads, the responsibility rests
 on early-warning operations of the military services, with their
 paraphernalia of DEW and SAGE, the complex of radars, computers,
 and other electronic mechanisms for round-the-clock surveillance of
 the air spaces.  On the basis of early-warning data, air defense and
 other decisions will be made in minutes or less.  Indeed, decisions
 like the directions to air-defense installations will be part of the
 electronic data process itself.  At this critical stage, the conventional
 national-intelligence machinery is bypassed.
 The more pertinent question for the space age, therefore, may relate
 less to the speed of national-intelligence production than of early-
 warning operations.  Levels of scientific achievement in detection
 devices are clearly of key importance here.  Television, radar, infra-
 red detection, surveillance by space satellites, and computations by
 high-speed computers, rather than human observation and analysis,
 will yield both the source data and final conclusions of early warning.
 The critical importance of the air defense and other early-warning
 systems acknowledged, national intelligence must still measure up to
 its own responsibilities in the space age, when the accuracy of its esti-

 ments, for example-seem broadly representative of the probable
 subject content of intelligence in the space age. The relative weights
 of each subject will, of course, vary with the demands of the day:
 Military intelligence takes on additional importance in the event of
 hot war; economic intelligence remains in high demand if economic
 achievement continues to be vital to national strength in military
 struggle and to national prestige in cold-war competition. Increasing
 consideration of scientific intelligence in national estimates is impera-
 tive in an age when technological breakthroughs by one side may
 become the all-important factor affecting the balance of forces in the
 world.
 The combination of personal observation and technical methods of
 intelligence collection and analysis will probably be increasingly
 weighted in favor of technical methods.  Earth satellites equipped
 with TV cameras and other instruments, for example, should be able
 to distinguish the clouds caused by nuclear explosion, should in fact
 enlarge many times the amount of economic and military intelligence
 that can be uncovered by present-day methods of aerial photography.
 These developments, however, are hardly likely to, eliminate or even
 diminish the importance of the human collector and analyst. Photos
 of factories do not tell all that goes on under the roofs of the factories.
 The course of political rivalries, the attitudes of peasants, the decisions
 of party councils-these are areas of intelligence interest where tradi-
 tional collection methods should continue to be profitable and the
 human analyst essential.
 Intelligence will continue to profit, of course, from the origination
 of concepts and methods in othM,
