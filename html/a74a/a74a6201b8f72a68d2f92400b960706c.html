 of the standard SU-7 fighter-bomber.
 III.   The Soviets did not show all of their new aircraft.
 A.      Among those missing was the E-266, which set
 world speed records in 1965.   This is purely
 a research aircraft,  and will not be produced
 in quantity.

 I.    I have reported to you on the termination of our

 which is to be phased out by December 1 this year
 in favor of the Air Force SR-71.
 A.   The SR-71, however, is not yet operational,
 and since the decision was made to terminate
 OXCART, we received permission to use our
 A-12 aircraft for coverage of North Vietnam.

 Vietnam--obtaining usable photography of most of
 the key areas.   The map shows only the areas

 III.         Our primary purpose in these missions has been to
 search for evidence that the Soviets might be
 deploying a surface-to-surface missile system.

 of launching equipment.   This is useful
 substantiation,of our estimate that the
 North Vietnamese have 25 to 30 SAM firing
 battalions which they move from site to site.
 2.   Similarly,  the second mission provided
 simultaneous coverage of all five major
 airfields in the Hanoi area,  which is essential
 coverage for determining the air order of battle
 and fighter dispositions.

 all parts of the country, and long stretches

 2.   This picture was taken 18 miles from
 Haiphong, but the interpreter can identify
 most of the ships in port.   Incidentally,
 no military cargo is visible.
 IV. Thus the OXCART aircraft is not only providing
 information which we would otherwise not get, but
 it enables us to make better interpretation of the
 intelligence we get from other sources.
 A.   It can probably provide even better coverage
 after the rainy season ends in September.
 B.   The Air Force is confident that the SR-71 will
 be ready to take over in December as scheduled.

 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 RIVERS SUBCOMMITTEE
 THE ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION
 I. A second ceasefire between the Israelis and
 Arabs went into effect along the Suez Canal
 on July 15, and UN observers are now in place
 to supervise it, but the situation along the
 Canal remains very touchy.
 A.  One point of friction is whether the Is-
 raelis can use small boats in those por-
 tions of the Canal now open.
 1.   The Egyptians contend that the
 East Bank of the Canal is the cease-
 fire line, and have told the UN that
 they would have "no choice" but to
 open fire if the Israelis attempt to
 place their boats in the waterway.
 2.   The Israelis have maintained that
 the Canal itself--that is, the center
 of the Canal--is the cease-fire line,
 and that vessels from both sides there-
 fore are entitled to use it.

 a. A related issue in this case is
 peacetime transit rights through
 the Canal for the Israelis.   They
 undoubtedly would like to estab-
 lish a precedent of access now,
 which would put them in a tougher
 bargaining position during negotia-
 tions on a settlement.
 3. Thus,  it would be difficult for Israel
 to agree to a plan devised by the UN

 accept a closer relationship with Moscow,

 RIVERS STTBCOMMITTEE
 20 July 1967
 The Shelepin ouster
 1. The appointment of Politburo member Aleksandr Shelepin
 as bead of the Soviet trade unions marks a further
 setback for him which all but completes his political
 neutralization, a process begun in late 1965.
 A.   Shelepin had the support of a "Komsomol group,"
 whose members began their careers in the apparatus
 of the youth organization when Shelepin was its
 boss.  Recent personnel moves, including the removal
 of KGB Chairman Semichastny, have vitiated the group
 as a serious potential threat to the positions of
 Brezhnev and other senior members of the Politburo.
 1.    The group has generally been associated with
 hard-line policies.
 a.   They favor internal "vigilance," tighter
 domestic controls, and economic efficiency
 through primarily administrative methods.
 b..  In foreign policy they are believed to
 oppose detente with the West on grounds
 that this will lead to the ideological
 disarmament of communist forces.
 B.   The Middle East crisis seems to have been a
 catalyst.  When faced with the explosive situation
 in the Middle East, Soviet foreign policy makers--
 Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny/clearly opted for

 cooperation with the U.S. to restrain the
 situation. This may have left the Young Turks
 more out of step with the party line than ever
 and, therefore, v,ilnerabl e .
 1.   In any event Moscow City party boss Yegory-
 chev, who is an ideological soul-mate if not
 a member of the Shelepin faction, was tempted
 to criticize the Politburo's Mideast policies
 and was promptly ousted.
 2.   Little more than a week later, Shelepin himself
 was demoted to the trade-union post.
 3.   Another close Shelepin protege, Komsomol
 chief Pavlov, may be the next victim of
 Brezhnev's purge.
 C.   Although the men who have been chosen to replace
 Yegorychev and Semichastny appear to be less
 militant in their outlook, no significant changes
 in policy appear likely.   Shelepin simply has not
 had a major voice in policymaking for some time.
 We do expect, however, that there will be some
 change in the execution of policy; some modera-
 tion in the rather abusive and heavy-handed style
 associated with Semichastny and Yegorychev.

 Performance of Top Leaders in Middle East Crisis
 II.   Brezhnev, Kosygin and Podgorny worked in close'consort
 during the crisis.  There was evidence of friction
 among them, but not of a critical nature.
 A. With Kosygin in New York and Podgorny in Cairo
 problems of communication and coordination were
 enormous.  Brezhnev acted as the peg point in
 Moscow issuing instructions and relaying informa-
 tion between Kosygin and Podgorny.
 1.   If there bad been any serious disagreement
 and distrust between Brezhnev and Kosygin,
 Kosygin would not have been given the mission
 of representing the USSR at the UN.
 2.   Furthermore, it does not seem possible that
 this Soviet effort, carried out on three con-
 tinents, could have been as smoothly orches--
 trated as it seems to have been, if there had
 had been much discord.
 It is clear, however, that personal jealousy and
 a kind of mutual wariness between Kosygin and
 Brezhnev, which has been noted before, continued
 to place a strain on relationships.
 1.  The timing of the party plenum in Moscow to
 coincide with ?KosyginOs presence in New York
 strongly smacked of a ploy to provide Brezhnev
 with the public forum he had previously lacked

 2.   There was also evidence that Kosygin was
 operating on a tight rein in the US and that
 Arozhnev and Podgorny may have suspected
 that Kosygin would interprete his instructions
 a bit too liberally and  ,erhaps take some
 actions which had not been previously agreed
 upon in Moscow.
 Future Shape of the Collective Leadership
 III.    The senior members of the Politburo appear to have
 reached agreement quickly on how to respond to the
 Middle East crisis.  To that extent they were in it
 together.  Differences between them will probably
 open up again, however, as future problems present
 themselves.
 A.   There is apparently some questioning in party
 circles of the leadership's handling of the crisis.
 1.   There are reportedly those of the Yegorychev
 persuasion who advocate a stronger stand in
 support of the Arabs.
 2.   Grumbling is also coming from those who
 question the wisdom of having committed so
 much military and economic aid to the Arabs
 in the first place.

 3.        Recriminations over the debacle will
 undoubtedly continue in Moscow, and
 decisions on future foreign policy may not
 be easily achieved.
 B.  Despite personal rivalry and differing views
 on policy questions,  the Brezhnev--Kosygin
 relationship his stood up for over two years,
 it so far has weathered the current crisis and
 proved workable.
 1.    The leadership is under particular pressu,:e
 to maintain at least the facade of unity
 during the jubilee 50th anniversary year.
 2.    Ad hoc arrangements worked out after
 Khrushchev's ouster concerning the division
 of responsibilities, lines of command and
 general rules of procedure within the Polit-
 buro have been increasingly regularized with
 time and may lend a measure of stability.
 C.   Some unexpected outside event could occur; of
 course, at any time to shatter the present
 delicate balance in the leadership.

 MUTINY IN CONGO   (KINSItASA)
 I. The mercenary mutiny has severely strained the
 tenuous stability which President Mobutu had managed
 to impose on the Congo during his months in
 office.
 A. Mobutu's strong rule and effective use of
 military units had brought a semblance of
 stability to the country.
 1.   Opposition elements--rebels, dissident local
 politicians, and tribal factions--had been
 subdued.
 2.   The general economic decline since inde-
 pendence had been at least temporarily
 stopped, and monetary reform instituted.
 3.   Relations with African neighbors had improved.
 B.   The mutiny and subsequent anti-white backlash
 may compromise these efforts.
 1.   No clear information. is available on the
 causes of the mutiny.

 a.   Certainly contributing was the fact that
 the mercenaries had not been paid for
 several month;.
 b.   They knew the Congolese were thinking of
 disbanding their units.
 c.   Additionally, the mercenaries have a
 general disdain for the Congolese and tend
 to assume they can accomplish anything
 in the Congo that they set out to do.
 d.   News of Moise Tshombe's kidnaping on 1 July
 may have sparked the mutiny.
 (1)  We do not believe, however, that this
 is a part of a bigger Tshombe plot to
 regain power in the Congo.
 2.      The mutiny, now subsiding, has had serious
 effects in the northeastern Congo and in
 Katanga Province.
 a.   Security has been disrupted especially in
 Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville) and
 Bukavu,  the two cities specifically
 affected.

 in Kisangani was threatened during

 mercenary occupation.   US-supplied
 C-130s were instrumental in evacuating
 over 600 persons.
 (2) The Congolese Army went on a rampage
 of looting following their re-entry
 into both Kisangani and Bukavu.   Many
 Congolese civilians have been terrorized.
 C-130s were also used to drop needed
 basic supplies and food to people
 in stricken areas.
 (3)   The mercenaries, having left
 Kisangani, settled down near Punia and
 their plans are not known.   Should
 they continue south by land, more
 civilian lives could be in danger.   The
 Congolese Army has been positioned
 to block them--again with C-130 help--
 but the ability of the army is
 questionable.   The mercenaries have
 two operational T-28s at their disposal,
 and possibly some other light aircraft.
 b.   The Congo's economy has further deteriorated.

 (1)   European technicians who are necessary for
 running the Katangan copper mines have been
 badly frightened by reports of brutality
 in Lubumbashi (formerly Elisabethville)
 and many have decided to leave the Congo
 as soon as possible.
 3.   Mobutu has  profited  from his good relations with
 African countries, however..
 a.   Ethiopia has agreed to send four F-86 fighter
 aircraft which left Addis Ababa for the Congo
 on 18 July.
 b.   Ghana has agreed to provide six pilots to fly
 the Congo's T-28s  in  unarmed reconnaissance
 missions; they are due in the Congo on 19 July.
 C.   If Mobutu can establish control soon, however, there
 may be a few positive results.
 1.   Mobutu's own political position has been
 strengthened.
 2.   The Congolese Army, having met and done fairly
 well against a much feared enemy, may have gained
 some self-confidence.

 I. The Nigerian crisis erupted into civil war on
 6 July with federal military thrusts from the
 north into the former Eastern region  (Biafra),
 which seceded on May 30.
 A.   The federal attack has advanced slowly
 in the face of stubborn Biafran resist-
 ance, severe logistical problems and
 the heavy rains.   Advancing on two
 fronts--the northeast and northwest bor-
 der areas--the federal army has made
 better progress in the northeast non-Ibo
 area.   Biafran counterattacks in the
 northwest have apparently halted the fed-
 eral thrust.
 1.       Both sides have suffered some loss of
 men and materiel, and Biafran troops
 have conducted several hit-and-tun
 raids behind the federal advance in
 both sectors.

 2.   The civil war is likely to continue
 for some time.
 II. Maj. Gen.  Gowon, head of the Nigerian Govern-
 ment, also has plans to land an amphibious
 force along the Biafran coast.                Infiltration
 by soldiers into the coastal area, in advance
 of this action may now be under way.
 III. The small federal navy has effectively blockaded
 the major Eastern ports since early June.   On
 18 July however, the navy returned to Lagos,
 possibly to load the amphibious invasion force.
 A.   Oil exports were also halted by the inclu-
 sion of tankers in the blockade on 2 July,
 after Shell-BP had announced a token pay-
 ment of revenues to Biafra.
 1.   The federal government is furious at
 Shell-BP and the UK, and there may well
 be changes in the contractual relation-
 ship between Nigeria and Shell-BP if the
 war against Biafra is successful.
 B. Biafran governor Ojuku is making strenuous
 efforts to charter ships to run the blockade,
 and a few reportedly carrying arms have al-
 ready done so.

 over his arms request and at the US over its
 refusal to permit him to buy arms from com-
 mercial US sources, negotiated for armed jet
 trainers from Czechoslovakia.
 A.   Six of these, with two Czech pilots for
 training purposes, are reportedly to ar-
 rive later this month.
 V. All US and UK personnel are being evacuated
 from the northern half of Biafra, although an
 augmented US consular staff is to remain in
 Enugu for the time being.
 A.   An Italian ship is to take the evacuees
 from Port Harcourt to Lagos.
 B.   Dependents of official personnel were
 evacuated from Biafra in early June.
 VI. Elsewhere in Nigeria,  rumblings of plotting
 against established authority continue to be
 reported.
 A.   Political intrigue will quickly start up
 after the civil war is over, no matter
 who wins.
 1.   If Biafra defeats the federal army,
 Nigeria is likely to disintegrate
 further.

 corrected.   Additional unmanned tests will
 be needed before another cosmonaut is com-
 mitted.   These may begin as early as this
 fall.
 B.    Power and stabilization problems which oc-
 curred throughout the flight of Soyuz-1
 probably contributed to the crash.   These
 problems cut short the mission, which
 may have been planned to include rendez-
 vous with a second spacecraft or trans-
 fer of crew members in flight.
 C. There is some evidence that the Soyuz
 capsule is part of a program aimed at
 manned circumlunar flight.

 HONG KONG
 I. Resolute action by the British authorities in Hong
 Kong during the past ten days or so has shaken up
 the local Communist apparatus, sapped its morale,
 and upset plans to create mass disorder.
 A.  Police, backed by troops, have been raiding
 local Communist control centers.   Thus far more
 than 800 people have been arrested.   Most of
 them are being released after questioning but
 the ring-leaders have been held for trial, and
 will be out of circulation for some time to
 come.   .
 B.  Mass violence in the streets is being firmly
 quelled.   The police have been very tough,
 while at the same time seeking to avoid creating
 a host of martyrs who could be exploited to
 generate public support for the Communists.
 II.   Despite these gains Hong Kong continues to be tense.
 Scattered riots are still taking place and there are

 sporadic outbreaks of terrorist activity targeted
 at the police and transportation services.   The
 Colonial Government currently holds the initiative,
 however, and order is gradually being restored.
 A.   Public services are functioning, although the
 transportation system continues to be harassed
 and the police are still under heavy pressure.
 B.   A "food strike" reportedly scheduled to begin
 on 17 July has not materialized and shipments of
 meat and produce are still arriving from the
 mainland.
 C.   A Communist call for a harbor strike has thus
 far received little response from seamen and

 that although many of
 the rank and file in the local Communist apparatus
 are disheartened by these setbacks, the hard-core

 to have been started on their initiative rather
 than on specific orders from Peking.   For

 this reason they probably feel compelled to
 press ahead.
 B.   Unable to muster support from the population
 for mass disorders they appear to be relying
 on small-scale "hit and run" terrorist tactics.
 IV. The prospect is for continued trouble during the
 coming weeks but unless Peking greatly increases
 its support for local Communist efforts it seems
 likely that the Hong Kong authorities will be able
 to keep the situation under control.
 A.       The Chinese Communists have provided political
 backing for the campaign and given the local
 apparatus some clandestine financial support.
 B.       Peking has thus far shown no disposition to go
 beyond this, however, and Chinese propaganda
 continues to emphasize the importance of
 efforts by the local Communist apparatus in
 carrying on the struggle.

 A. For three months warring political factions
 have been engaging in violent clashes in many
 areas of the country.
 B. We know
 Ithat this civil
 disorder has caused considerable bloodshed,
 disrupted production in factories, and inter-

 1.   There is no evidence, however, that it
 has seriously hindered aid shipments
 through China to North Vietnam, or that it
 is slowing down the Chinese advanced
 weapons program.
 II. On June 6 the central committee issued a seemingly
 unequivocal and long overdue directive to the
 army to restore order.
 A.   It has not been vigorously enforced, however.

 B.   This does not suggest to us that the army is
 an unreliable instrument of control.   By and
 large, army officers appear to be loyal and
 dependable.                                   25X6
 C.   Instead, the failure to use force to end
 the fighting suggests that some elements in
 the leadership, presumably including Mao
 Tse-tung  (MAW DZEH-DUNG)  and Defense Minister
 Lin Piao  (LIN BYAW), are determined to push
 the Cultural Revolution, regardless of the
 disorder it creates.
 III.       China continues to be ruled by a triumvirate
 composed of Mao Tse-tung  (MAW DZEH-DUNG), Lin
 Piao  (LIN BYAW), and Premier Chou En-lai  (JOE
 EN-LYE).   They maintain the appearance of unity
 in public,  and Chou  (JOE) remains the chief
 spokesman for the regime.   We believe that their
 alliance is at best very shaky and uneasy.
 A. Instability and confusion are likely to persist
 so long as Mao  (MAW)  retains sufficient power
 and vigor to push his Cultural Revolution and
 to combat real or imagined opposition to him
 and his radical policies.

 1.      In Vietnam, we have been watching for several
 months the enemy build-up along the Demilitarized
 Zone.
 A. The tempo of enemy operations in northern I
 Corps has continued to accelerate, accompanied
 by heavy and well-coordinated mortar, rocket,
 and artillery bombardments.
 B.  US Marines and South Vietnamese Army forces
 conducted a three-pronged offensive--Operation
 HICKORY--from 18 to 28 May against North
 Vietnamese regulars within and south of the
 DMZ.   Heavy enemy contact subsequently developed,
 as reflected in the operation's final casualty
 toll of 800 Communists killed compared with
 allied losses of 164 killed and 1,018 wounded.
 1. In two subsequent operations--CIMARRON and
 BUFFALO--conducted in the same general area
 from 31 May to 13 July, US Marines killed
 nearly 1,400 additional NVA regulars and

 probably pre-empted major enemy assaults
 against a network of strategic Marine
 garrisons in northeastern Quang Tri Province.
 The cost to US forces was also heavy:
 200 killed and 1,400 wounded.
 C.   Early this year, elements of two North Vietnamese
 divisions began slipping back into Quang Tri
 Province.
 L                                major elements of
 possibly two other divisions are in or near
 the area.   In addition, another North Vietnamese
 division has three third-generation regiments
 operating along the Laotian border of Quang Tri
 Province.
 D.   In recent months the Communists have also
 extended a feeder road--Route 922--from the
 Laos Panhandle into the A Shau Valley of western
 Thua Thien Province, giving them their first
 motorable, through road from the North all the
 way down the Laotian Panhandle and into the

 months have been used as replacements for
 established Communist Main Force units.

 detected earlier in the DMZ area and
 appears to be a significant indication of
 the presence of additional NVA troops or
 of increased Hanoi interest in the area, or both.

 North Vietnamese forces in the DMZ/north-

 major offensive operations against allied
 troop   concentrations and base installa-
 tions.

 against US Marine positions near the DMZ,
 the most immediate large-scale enemy threat
 appears to be focused in the Pleiku-Kontum-
 Cambodia tri-border area of the western

 by elements of the Communist's B-3 Front
 military command against allied Special
 Forces camps in western Kontum and Pleiku
 provinces are likely as the southwest mon-
 soons render allied close air support in-

 3.    On balance, while a threat to such major
 population centers as Quang Tri and Hue
 cannot be ruled out, the Communists will
 probably continue to pursue a strategy of
 maneuver and attrition designed to spread
 allied forces thin and to protect their in-
 filtration routes.   In addition, periodic
 heavy strikes against key allied bases, such
 as the 15 July rocket attack against Da

 VIETNAM:   Step Up in Communist Firepower
 I.   Our military command in Saigon has pulled to-
 gether some statistics which will give you an
 idea of the increase in incoming enemy fire.
 A.         MAC-V figures for enemy mortar, rocket,
 and artillery attacks--excluding enemy
 reaction to operations initiated by our
 side--show that in 1966 there were an
 average of 60 such incidents per month.
 1.    In 1967 there were 44 incidents in
 January,  51 in February, but 141 in
 March and 100 in April.
 2.    This increase is compounded by a
 greater number of rounds per incident,
 and heavier projectiles.
 B.   General Westmoreland's headquarters esti-
 mates that the weight of the incoming bar-
 rages was less than ten tons altogether
 during the last six months of 1967--but
 49.4 tons for March and April alone in 1967.

 C.   This would seem to give added significance
 to our observations that the enemy moved
 15 to 20 thousand tons of supplies south,
 to or across the South Vietnamese border,
 by daylight during the four-day Lunar
 New Year truce in mid-February.
 D.   The   enemy brought a number of new weapons
 into play in the first quarter of 1967.   In
 1966, his heaviest bombardment weapon was
 the 120-millimeter mortar.
 E.   Now he is using Soviet 122 and 140-milli-
 meter rockets, Chinese 102=-millimeter rockets,
 and artillery firing 100,.105, 122 and 152-
 millimeter shells from positions in or behind
 the so-called "Demilitarized" Zone.

 about six miles, and the 122-millimeter
 about ten miles

 I. The prospects for a meaningful presidential
 contest on 3 September have improved in the
 past month as the military leadership weath-
 ered two election-associated crises.
 A.   Premier Ky's decision to withdraw his own
 bid and take the second spot on Chief of
 State Thieu's ticket dispelled, for the
 time being, the very real threat of a fall-
 ing-out among the generals.
 1.   Available evidence now suggests that
 the election tactics used to support
 the joint military slate will not be
 as blatant as those Ky was employing
 in behalf of his own candidacy.
 2.   The campaign apparatus of the military
 ticket however: should be more ef-
 fective than the loosely-organized
 mechanisms of the civilian candidates.
 B.   Final approval by the Provisional National
 Assembly on 18 July of the Thieu/Ky ticket
 and its disapproval of the candidacy of
 "Big" Minh removed the second potential
 crisis.

 1.    On 17 July, a special committee in the
 assembly had disqualified Thieu, and
 the military leaders had privately
 decided to dissolve the constitution
 if the full assembly upheld the com-
 mittee's ruling.
 C.   In the month-and-a-half remaining before
 the elections, the presidential race will
 probably boil down to a three-way contest
 between Thieu and civilian candidates
 Tran Van Huong and Phan Khac Suu.
 1.   Although Thieu is given the best chance
 to win now, Huong will be a formidable
 opponent, especially if "Big" Minh
 throws his support behind him.
 II.   South Vietnam's first Senate will also be
 elected on 3 September, and the lower house
 election will follow by two months.
 A.  The forces behind the Thieu/Ky slate
 will attempt to elect a controllable ma-

 by the multiplicity of 10-man slates com-

 I. Hanoi's attitude toward negotiations has shown
 no change in recent months.
 A. DRV spokesmen continue to repeat their
 January 1967 offer to talk with the US in
 exchange for a cessation of the bombings,
 but at the same time they continue to insist

 combined to make Thanh almost uniquely

 2.   Thanh's death will reduce the strength
 of the militant wing of the party on the
 all important Politburo.
 a.   The contrast between Peking's effusive
 eulogies on his death and Moscow's
 reserved commentary suggests that
 Peking has lost one of its strongest
 :-pporters in Hanoi councils.
 b.   The relative balance of five militants
 and five moderates on the Politburo
 with Ho as final arbiter, was upset
 by Thanh's death.   A further compli-
 cation for the leadership is sug-
 gested by the apparent poor health
 of party leader Ho Chi Minh, who has
 been unusually inactive for almost
 four months.   The extent of his ill-
 ness is unknown.

 detainees have now been released.   However,
 a number of political leaders are either_.im-
 prisoned or under house arrest.
 A.   Andreas Papandreou remains in an Athens
 prison apparently well treated.
 1.   The regime has been in no hurry to
 begin trial proceedings against
 Andreas, but have indicated he will
 not be executed.

 2.   Interior Minister Pattakos has expressed
 interest in Andreas US citizenship status,
 perhaps out of a desire to deport him to
 the US.
 III.        One step toward a return to parliamentary gov-
 ernment was taken with the formation of a con-
 stitutional review committee which has been
 meeting for the last month.
 A.   Its work is to be submitted to the junta
 by mid-December.
 B. No timetable for a popular referendum or
 subsequent elections has been mentioned.
 C.   The regime clearly intends to carry out
 its expressed aims of totally "cleansing"
 the country's institutions.

 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 RIVERS SUBCOMMITTEE
 CYPRUS
 I.   A relative calm has prevailed on Cyprus in re-
 cent months.
 II.   Relations between Greece and Cyprus, however,
 became strained in late May over alleged Greek
 "threats" against elements on the island that
 were believed to oppose union of the island
 with Greece.
 A.   The Cypriots feared that the Greek regime
 was planning to overthrow the Makarios
 government.
 B,   It is clear that the junta is interested
 in settling the Cyprus problem, but the
 group has no firm policy and no defini-
 tive action appears imminent.
 III.     Athens probably would not attempt any uni-
 lateral solution without prior notification
 of the Turks.
 A.   New contacts have been reported between
 Athens and Ankara aimed at some preliminary
 agreements toward a solution.

 B.   In spite of the determination in both cap-
 itals, however,  the road to a solution
 will not be smooth.
 C.   Athens faces not only the difficulty of
 obtaining Makarios' agreement or acqui-
 esence, but of offering acceptable con-
 cessions to Ankara.
 D.   Ankara remains wary of Athens' ability to
 control the wily Makarios.   Moreover, the
 Turks have indicated that they fear any
 agreement reached with the junta may not
 be upheld by any succeeding political
 government in Athens.
