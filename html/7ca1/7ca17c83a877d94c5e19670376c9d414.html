THE PURGE OF LIN PIAO'S "CONSPIRATORIAL CLIQUE": 
A TENTATIVE RECONSTRUCTION 
MEnORANDUM FOR RECIPIENTS 
This tentative reconstruction of the Lin Piao 
affair accepts as largely credible the case which the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has made against Lin and 
his confederates. This conclusion is based upon a 
spliced-together examination of (a) developments ob-
served prior to the dramatic events of last year's 
'purges, and (b) the CCP's story  of those events, as  
that story has become available) 
Addi-
tional Party materials and other documentation-- almost 
certain to become available -- will permit a filling out 
and firming up of the causes, particulars, and signi-
ficance of the fall of Lin. 
This present paper centers on Lin and his known 
proteges, their power position, their challenge to Mao, 
their subsequent fall, and what can be seen of the 
present leadership, arrangements made by Mao and Chou 
En-lal. A companion study now in preparation by this 
Staff will focus on domestic and foreign policy issues 
related to the fall of Lin's group and to the present 
leadership arrangements.

This Staff has received constructive comment on 
this study from a number of other offices of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, all of whom agree on the credibility 
of the essentials of the CCP's case against Lin, and 
several of whom agree in general with other findings of 
this study. Further comments will be welcome, addressed 
to the study's author of this Staff.

THE PURGE OF LIN PIAO'S "CONSPIRATORIAL CLIQUE": 
A TENTATIVE RECONSTRUCTION 
Available evidence now permits a reconstruction, 
with fair confidence, of the decline and dramatic fall 
of Lin Piao and other top-ranking Chinese military leaders. 
This reconstruction accepts as credible the essentials  
of the case against Lin and his proteges  
 / The main 
features of the Party's story of the past four years 
are consonant with certain developments -- notably or-
ganizational and policy changes -- observed but not fully 
understood at the time, and are consonant also with the 
past patterns of thought and behavior of the principal 
actor, Mao Tse-tung. 
In brief, by early 1970 Mao had changed his mind 
about the suitability of Lin as his successor, and he 
was also looking for high-level scapegoats for a range 
of repudiated "ultraleftist" policies undertaken at 
various times during the Cultural Revolution. Mao began 
soon thereafter to undercut Lin's position organiza-
tionally. In response, Lin, in alliance with a "radical" 
civilian Party leader. and some other military leaders, 
chose to contest Mao's will at the Party plenum of late 
summer 1970, on the issue of the chairmanship of the 
regime. Mao prevailed, and took further organizational 
steps against Lin which were visible to Lin. By early 
1971, Lin and his proteges had concluded correctly that  
it was Mao's intention ultimately to purge them.\ 
/Again, as at the plenum

they underestimated the awe and responsiveness that Mao 
inspired: in this case, his ability to command the 
obedience of other military leaders, even the great 
majority of the plotters' own proteges. When Lin's 
plans for a coup were frustrated, he attempted to flee 
to the USSR, dying in the attempt, and his closest 
proteges were seized and purged. Mao is now again faced 
with the difficult task of putting together a successor 
leadership, as he was at the beginning of the Cultural 
Revolution. 
The Period of High Favor, 1966-69  
The enigmatic and sickly military leader Lin Piao 
was designated (surprisingly) as Mao's successor in 
August 1966, in the first year of the massive purge of 
the Chinese Communist Party, government and military 
establishment known as the Great Proletarian Cultural 
Revolution. Mao's main targets at the time were Liu 
Shao-chi (his then-designated successor) and other 
leading figures of the Party apparatus, an apparatus 
which Mao believed to be obstructing his policies. In 
that first year Lin seemed to establish himself as a 
hard-core Maoist in both senses of the term: completely 
loyal to Mao, and predisposed to the same militant, 
radical line that Mao himself favored in that period. 
Both Mao and Lin appeared to have differences with the 
more moderate Premier Chou En-lai. 
In the second year, when China was in effect 
under military occupation by the PLA which Lin headed, 
Lin's position became more complicated. His generally 
"conservative" PLA came under attack by mass organi-
zations encouraged by civilian radicals in the Party 
leadership, the officers of a special purging organ 
called the Cultural Revolution Group (CRG). Sometimes

Lin seemed to act to protect PLA leaders, and sometimes 
he di6 not. Chou En-lai and his proteges also came under 
"radical" attack, and Chou had to intervene with Mao 
to reverse Peking's counter-productive "revolutionary" 
diplomacy. Some second-level leaders of the CRG were 
purged, in part as scapegoats for repudiated policies. 
In the third year of the Cultural Revolution, in 
the face of the Soviet threat, Mao put down the militant 
mass organizations, placed the provisional organs of 
government throughout China largely in the hands of 
military leaders, and prepared to build the new provincial-
level Party committees around these same military men. 
In this period, Mao, Lin, Chou and the remaining CRG 
leaders seemed to be working tcgether to these ends. 
Throughout those zigs and zags of the Cultural 
Revolution, Lin had steadily strengthened his personal 
position. He had named his closest proteges to concurrent 
positions in the most important organs of command and 
control of the PLA, he had reorganized the Military Region 
headquarters to place almost all of them under the command 
of his proteges, and' he' had secured the appointment Gf 
such proteges to the most important provincial posts con-
currently. This was the shape of an "independent kingdom," 
should Mao ever come to regard it as that. 
Mao did indeed come to regard it as that. However, 
at the end of the third year, in April 1969, when the 
Party's long-delayed' Ninth Party Congress was held, Lin 
Piao seemed to get Mao's blessing in all that he had done. 
Lin gave the main report to the Congress, and the new 
Party Constitution confirmed him as Mao's successor with-
out an election -- thus heading off any possible election, 
after Mao's death, of the more popular Chou En-lai. The 
new Central Committee (more than 40 percent PLA) named 
a new Politburo in which PLA figures constituted the 
largest group, and in which Lin and five of his closest

Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010047-5 
proteges seemed to form the most cohesive group. This 
group consisted of Lin, chief-of-staff Huang Yung-sheng, 
Air Force commander Wu Fa-hsien, Navy leader Li Tso-peng, 
Logistics chief Chiu Hui-tso, and Lin's wife and staff 
office chief Yeh Chun. (This group of six was to be 
the core of the "counter-revolutionary conspiratorial 
clique" purged in September 1971.) At the same time, 
Mao in a speech to the first Party plenum voiced his con-
cern about the responsiveness of the PLA to the civilian 
Party leadership. In other words, the issue that had 
led to th,..2 downfall of the Party-machine leaders around 
Liu Shao-chi in the first year of the Cultural Revolu-
tion -- the responsiveness of the governing apparatus 
to Mao's will -- was re-emerging with the new apparatus, 
the PLA.' 
Lin's Decline in Mao's Regard, 1969-70  
It is apparent in retrospect that at some time 
in the year following the Ninth Party Congress Mao 
changed his mind about Lin as his successor. Mao's in-
creasing concern about the responsiveness of the PLA 
-- for which Lin as its leader was responsible --
evidently le( Mao to conclude that Lin himself was not 
properly responsive. As a related matter, Lin and others 
may well have been unwilling to accept the new Mao-Chou 
line -- formulated in 1969, withdrawn for a time in 1970, 
later restored -- that the USSR had become the main enemy 
of China, replacing the U.S. in that role; and Mao may 
have been made aware that Lin's group did not accept this. 
Further, Lin and his proteges may well have carried out 
the "preparations against war" campaign in such a way as 
to enhance theirzown power position, as later charged. 
Further, the investigation of the "5/16" group -- a 
hypermilitant mass organization which had sought in 1967 
to bring down Chou En-lai and which symbolized not only

a range of repudiated ultraleftist policies but the funda-
mental sin of "conspiracy" and the ancillary practice of 
political assassination -- may well have turned up some-
thing damaging to Lin and some of his proteges. And with 
the decline and dissolution of the Cultural Revolution Group, 
Lin and Chou En-lai -- who during 1969 apparently became 
Mao's principal advisor and favorite lieutenant -- may 
well have come into conflict with respect to supervising 
and directing the re-emerging Party apparatus. Finally, 
Mao needed some additional scapegoats -- this time, high-
level scapegoats -- for the self-defeating excesses of the 
Cultural Revolution. 
In any case, in March 1970 Mao made a proposal 
which Lin rightly interpreted as reflecting a lack of 
confidence in him. This was the proposal not to restore 
the post of Chairman of the regime. Lin thought the 
post important, presumably because the Chairman would 
be the ranking officer of the government (over Premier 
Chou) and also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. 
Thus Mao's attitude toward the post, and toward its 
eventual occupancy by Lin, was a critical test of Mao's 
attitude toward Lin himself. 
Mao apparently began to take organizational steps 
against Lin, steps securing Mao's own control of Peking, 
during the summer of 1970, prior to the second Party 
plenum of August-September 1970. On 1 June, Wen Yu-cheng, 
a key protege of Lin's, the commander of the Peking Gar-
rison -- a critical post, commanding the immediately 
available military forces in Peking -- made his last ap-
pearance, and was probably removed from the post soon 
thereafter. Althcugh his successor was not identified 
until 1971, from summer 1970 no leaders of the Peking 
Garrison were proteges of Lin's. Morerver, by August 
1970 the leadership of the reactivated General Political 
Department of the PLA was in the hands not of proteges 
of Lin but of proteges of other military leaders. Lin 
probably saw both developments as further indicators of 
his decline in favor.

At the Party plenum of August-September 1970, 
Lin and the civilian radical Chen Po-ta, who had been 
the chief of the abolished CRG, forced a test on the 
issue of the regime chairmanship. Presumably in the 
belief that they could win majority support, they led a 
concerted effort to get the post rAnstated -- apparently 
with Mao himself to occupy it for the time being but with 
Lin to fall heir to it. Mao refused. Chen Po-ta was 
soon purged, in part for his opposition to Mao on this 
issue. Lin and his closest military proteges, ? whose 
roles at this plenum were concealed at the time, are 
now said credibly to have been criticized by Mao after 
the plenum for their own behavior. In Chen and Lin, 
Mao now had his high-level scapegoats, for whatever use 
he wanted to put them to. 
Late in 1970, two more key military figures in 
Peking were purged. These were the commander and first 
political., officer of the Peking Military Region, charged 
with conspiring with Chen Po-ta. Again their successors 
were not identified at the time, but 
here again Lin failed to install 
his own men in these critically important positions. 
 hthis latest failure 
was an important if not decisive factor in leading Lin 
to conclude that he was already marked for purging, as 
indeed he probably was. 
25X1 
25X1 
In Mao's conversations with Edgar Snow in that 
period (late 1970), there was a'striking lack of refer-
ence to Lin. Mao had evidently stopped talking about Lin 
as his successor or anything else. Snow learned that 
Chou En-lai, not Lin as earlier reported, was "in charge" 
of rebuilding the Party. And in outlining to Snow their 
new foreign policy (which included a declared willingness 
to welcome President Nixon), Mao and Chou failed to as-
sociate Lin (as the successor) with it.

The Approach to the Crisis, 1971 
It is credible 
that Lin and his closest proteges began as early as January 
1971 to plan a military "coup" of some kind against Mao. 
It is apparent from subsequent developments that they again 
overestimated their own strength and underestimated Mao's. 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
In the early months of 1971, Mao was again visibly 
concerned with those failings of military administrators 
in general -- summarized at thl time as "arrogance and 
complacency" -- that he had begun to warn against at the 
Ninth Party Congress. An intensive "rectification" of 
all Party cadres -- in which the military were most 
prominent -- was undertaken. There was probably a small 
purge of the PLA -- not reaching to the top levels -- at 
the same time. Many secondary military figures disappeared 
am- are still missing. 
During the spring of 1971, Mao continued to ap-
prove the appointment of military men -- including Lin's 
proteges -- to key positions in Peking and in the prov-
inces. This must have reflected a calculation -- which 
was to prove correct in summer 1971 -- that in the event 
of a showndown with Lin he would be able to split off from  
Lin the great majority of these proteges.(

It seems likely that by June 1971 Mao had an addi-
tional reason to purge Lin's group: namely, its opposition 
to the Mao-Chou foreign policy, in particular to the plans 
for President Nixon's visit, an initiative to which Mao 
and Chou were strongly committed. While such opposition 
cannot be proved, 
foreign policy was a genuine (if secondary) 
issue in the purge. 
Lin Piao made his last public appearance in early 
June. Mao may have begun soon thereafter the talks with 
regional and provincial military-political leaders in 
which he successfully sought assurances of their support 
in a showdown with Lin's group. Party briefings place 
Mao outside of Peking for most of the summer after the 
first week of July, and place him in South China -- engaged 
in such talks with a group of Lin's regional proteges --
in mid-August. Mao's interests in Peking were being 
protected by Party and military leaders in whom he had 
confidence -- e.g. Chou En-lai, the old Marshal Yeh Chien-
ying (the two Chinese principals in the first talks with 
Dr. Kissinger), the General Political Dvartment director 
and possible Peking MR commander Li Te-sheng, and Peking 
Garrison commander Wu Chung. 
The Crisis, August-September 1971  
In Mao's talks in mid-August with leaders of the 
Central-South area, in which proteges of both Lin Piao 
and Huang Yung-sheng were heavily clustered, Mao spoke 
of Lin and Huang as conspirators and of Lin as a com-
missioner of assassinations, and made clear that he

 / On 7 September, 
Lin apparently took his family, on a Trident aircraft, 
to the summer resort of Peitaiho, not far from Peking, 
to await developments -- possibly including the results 
of an attempted assassination of Mao. The Party insists 
that Lin's group attempted to activate their assassina-
tion plan in early September, although almost all accounts 
agree that they were unable to do so: that is, no bullet 
was fired, no bomb was exploded. While it does seem very

counr;i1s. A meeting of Party leaders -- perhaps largely 
or military leaders -- was convened that same evening, 
either by Mao or by Chou En-lai in Mao's name. This 
meeting was very probably protected by security forces 
of the Peking Garrison. At the meeting, Mao's intention 
to purge Lin and his supporters was almost certainly 
made known. 
Lin and his wife and son -- leaving Lin's proteges 
behind in Peking -- were probably (as alleged) aboard 
the elite Trident aircraft which took off hurriedly from 
an airfield near Peitaiho after midnight on the night 
of 12-13 September and which crashed and burned at about 
0300 on 13 September near the Soviet border, on a line 
with the big air complex at Irkutsk. (Alternatively, 
they were seized at Peitaiho, while lesser figures fled, 
and were soon executed.) The air standdown was appar-
ently imposed immediately following this flight. Lin's 
principal proteges in Peking were condemned in the course 
of a prolonged meeting ending about 25 September. Chou 
En-lai and Yeh Chien-ying were particularly helpful to 
Mao in managing the crisis through this period.

The  Post-Lin Line and Leadership  
The handling of this intensely embarrassing case, 
for both domestic and foreign audiences, has been a hard 
problem for Party leaders. The Party at first attempted 
to conceal the fall of Lin's group, telling even its 
own cadres that the missing leaders were engaged in mili-
tary preparations against a Soviet threat. Briefings  
of Chinese audiences/ 
 /did 
not begin until October. Deception of foreigners was 
intense through October and into November, and has con-
tinued: Chinese officials have still not admitted to 
foreigners -- in fact have denied -- that Lin is dead. 
Neither Lin nor any member of his group has been 
mentioned by China's public media. Lin's association with 
Mao -- e.g., in the "little red book" -- has been erased. 
There has been a selective discussion of the case in 
terms of "swindlers like Liu Shao-chi," emphasizing 
conspiracy and illicit organizational activity, and 
associating the purged group by implication with foreign  
enemies and with various rejected policies.

The PLA has been told repeatedly that it is to 
be subordinated to the civilian Party leadership, that 
opposition to Party policies (including foreign policy) 
will not be tolerated, that Party policies must be 
faithfully implemented, that the PLA must learn humility, 
and that the authority of military administrators vis-
a-vis civilian Party cadres is in general to be reduced. 
In other words, the PLA is to be returned to a more 
nearly traditional role. 
The Party is promising at the same time that an 
obedient and humble PLA need not fear another large-scale 
purge, on the order of 1966-67, A fairly substantial  
purge has already been carried outA 
  The purge has clearly 
not been completed at any level, and the number of 
victims may rise considerably in the course of the next 
year. 
Mao looks to be still the Party's dominant figure, 
in the terms used by himself in late 1970: he points 
the general direction, formulates or approves the 
formulation of the regime's principal policies, and 
signs directives, leaving day-to-day operations to Chou 
En-lai and Chou's Party apparatus and government machinery. 
And he is probably still dominant in the sense of having 
the power to elevate or purge any other Party leader or 
small group of leaders.

and he has lost pres-
tige. It is doubtful that he could point China in any 
general direction other than the onehe has been taking 
-- that is, it is doubtful that he could turn hard left 
again. He relies on a chief lieutenant, Chou, who sees 
many things differently than he does. And he is still 
heavily dependent on the PLA. If he were to choose to 
replace Chou's group or to return the PLA fully to its 
traditional role, it seems unlikely that he would have 
the time to do either. Increasingly, Mao's lieutenants 
will be looking past him to the post-Mao situation  
Nevertheless, the main lesson of the past ten 
years, for other Party leaders, has to be that one chal-
lenges Mao, or takes action behind his back, only at 
great peril. Other Party leaders, while making arrange-
ments for their futures, will probably try above all not 
to provoke the old man's suspicion or hostility in his 
remaining time. The chief near-term threat to Mao, how-
ever marginal, from other leaders, looks still to be 
assassination. Mao's fear of it may have been a factor 
in his failure to appear on May Day. 
Chou En-lai's status and authority have been 
greatly enhanced. At the head of the Party apparatus 
and the government machinery, he has apparently been 
acquiring authority as well over the military establish-
ment. The general direction of Chinese policy since 
1969 has clearly been congenial to Chou, and President 
Nixon's visit was a visible personal triumph for him. 
As observed during that visit, Chou takes pains not to 
appear to be challenging Mao: he is deferential to Mao, 
he gives Mao the credit for formulating even those 
policies he himself has formulated, and he is meticulous 
in getting Mao's approval for important steps. The 
clever Chou will probably survive and prosper.

Mao and Chou -- now the only other primary leader 
are proceeding carefully and deliberately with the task 
of assembling another successor leadership. They are 
now operating with a relatively small central team, 
composed both of old comrades of Mao's and Chou's and of 
younger figures who rose during the Cultural Revolution. 
The military leaders are, of course, largely a new set, 
and are not proteges of any single military leader, as 
were those purged with Lin Piao. 
Because it is hard at best to carry out Mao's 
policies to his satisfaction, and because mismatched 
groups of leaders can be expected to continue to com-
pete for Mao's (and Chou's) favor, some members of the 
current team -- both military and civilian -- will 
probably fall. Should Mao die, Chou could probably 
dominate the leadership (although not to the same 
degree/, and could be expected to make further changes, 
reducing the importance of Maoist ideology and of the 
surviving ideologues. Should both Mao and Chou die in 
the next year or two, no single figure among the sur-
viving leaders would seem strong enough to dominate. 
Ironically, the PLA, put down so hard in the past year, 
would in those circumstances probably be in the best 
position to provide the dominant group.

ANNEX 
I. The Period of High Favor, 1966-69  
In the first year of the Cultural Revolution 
(officially beginning in May 1966), Lin Piao seemed to 
establish himself as a hard-core Maoist "radical," who 
cooperated with Chen Po-ta and other civilian radicals 
of the central Cultural Revolution Group in destroying 
the Chinese Communist Party and purging the Chinese 
Communist armed forces (PLA) which he headed. In the 
second year, Lin's position seemed more complicated, as 
his generally "conservative" PLA came under attack by 
those same "radicals." He used that year to bring the 
PLA under the domination of his own proteges and to 
install such proteges in key positions in the re-emerging 
governmental machinery and Party apparatus, thus beginning 
to build an "independent kingdom." At the end of the 
third year, Lin seemed to have Mao's blessing in what 
he had done: the new Party Constitution confirmed him 
as Mao's successor, and Lin and his closest proteges 
became the largest cohesive group in the new Politburo. 
This was the group that was to be purged in September 
1971. 
The New Successor: The great purge of the 
Chinese Communist hierarchy which took place under the 
banner of the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" 
actually began in December 1965, with the arrest of the 
PLA's chief-of-staff and political security supervisor, 
and of other leaders believed to be plotting a "coup." 
The Cultural Revolution began officially in May 1966, 
when a Central Committee circular made clear that a great 
purge of "the party, the government, and the army" lay

Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29 : CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010047-5 
ahead.* The same circular set up a central Cultural 
Revolution Group, outslde the Party apparatus, to collduct 
the purge; its officers were a group of civilian radicals, 
led by Mao's longtime factotum Chen Po-ta and including 
Madame Mao. At the same time, Lin Piao, in the main 
speech to an enlarged meeting of the Politburo, denounced 
several arrested Party leaders, spoke at great length 
of the importance of preventing a "coup," called for 
resolute support of Chairman Mau and adherence to his 
"thought," and promised harsh punishment to Mao's op-
ponents. 
While Mao was preparing to unveil the young 
Red Guards as the main instrument to attack the Party, 
the Central Committee met in early August 1966 to approve 
Mao's design for the Revolution and his rearrangement 
of the Party hierarchy, in particular his purge of his  
previously-designated successor, Liu Shao-chi.  
 / Lin emerged from this 
as the sole vice-chairman of the Party and thue the 
newly-designated suocessor to Mao. The plenum .onfirmed 
Chou En-lai as the third-ranking Party leader, and added 
Chen Po-ta (among others) to the Politburo standing 
committee, the organizational core of power in China. In 
the same period, Lin told PLA leaders that the harsh 
standards used to purge the Party were also to be used 
to purge the PLA, and he named Chen Po-ta's deputy, Madame 
Mao, as "advisor" to (de facto chief of) a special 
Cultural Revolution Group which was to be used to conduct 
this purge of the PLA. 
*A group of Party-machine figures purged at this time 
-- spring 1966 -- was also charged with plotting a "coup." 
This was to be a central charge against many of the high-
level Party leaders purged in the Cultural Revolution, 
and was eventually to be made against Lin Piao himself.

Lin and the Purge of the PLA: The Red Guards made 
their appearance in mid-August, and began -- on Mao's 
explicit directive -- to "bombard" the Party apparatus. 
Their continuing guidance came from Lin Piao (in general 
terms) and from Chou En-lai and the officers of the 
central CRG (in more specific terms). From the start, 
there were marked differences in the lines taken by 
Lin and the CRG leaders on one hand and Chou on the 
other: Lin and the civilian radicals of the CRG tended 
to incite militancy and violence, whereas Chou did not. 
Chou probably had from the start a good sense 
of where mindless militancy would lead. He could juL .e 
in the autumn of 1966 that it would seriously disrupt 
the work of his government machinery and in particul,r 
the conduct of his longtime specialty, foreign policy. 
Mao himself foreshadoweu the extension of the Cultural 
Revolution into foreign policy by calling in September 
1966 for the "revolutioni.zation" of Chinese missions abroad 
and of Peking's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. And Lin 
Piao soon added his voice to those calling for attacks 
on the government -- the entire structure over which 
Chou as Premier presided -- as well as on the Party. 
0. 
During the early winter of 1966-67, Lin Piao 
backed Madame Mao (in the starring role) in a widening 
purge of the PLA. This purge removed the second-ranking 
officer of the Military Affairs Committee (MAC, the Party 
organ which directed and controlled the entire military 
establishment), who was also accused of plotting a "coup," 
and removed as well many other central and regional 
military leaders, several of whom were said to be co-
conspirators in a planned "coup." Those purged were not 
proteges of Lin himself. 
Mao ordered the PLA into action as an instrument 
of the Cultural Revolution early in 1967. The PLA 
rapidly became the de facto government of China outside 
Peking, and it took over the regime's public security 
apparatus. Thereafter, Lin continued methodically to

purge the PLA and to reorganize the regional a. provincill 
military commands, but in small groups, not risking a 
general revolt which would lead to chaos. 
During this stage of the Cultural Revolution, 
some of Lin's longtime military proteges came under 
Red Guard attack, and Lin had to take action to save 
them. Several proteges and friends of Chou En-lai's 
also came under such attack. Chou, at that time less 
close to Mao than was Lin, was less successful than Lin 
in protecting his proteges. At the same time, a "revolu-
tionary rebel" group -- the adult successors of the 
young Red Guards -- began to "supervise" (that is, 
disrupt) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the months 
to follow, Chinese missions abroad were to be turned into 
centers for the propFlgation of various extreme features 
of Mao's "thought," leading -- as Chou En-lai probably 
foresaw -- to counteraction by local governments, 
retaliation or "revolutionary" lines by Peking, and the 
international isolation of Peking. 
Through the spring of 1967, Lin remained generally 
militant in.his attitude toward the PLA as a whole. Fol-
lowing Mao's judgment in March 1967 that the PLA in restor-
ing order had acted too vigorously against mass organiza-
tions, Lin in late March imposed severe restrictions on 
the PLA's use of force against such organizations, thus 
putting the PLA at a disadvantage against its young 
antagonists, and probably alienating some PLA leaders 
from Lin himself. This containment of the PLA was pre-
dictably folloaed by a wave of unprecedented violence 
on the part oi mass organizations, which led in turn to 
a new stage of the Cultural Revolution in which Lin was 
forced to play a more complicated role. 
Lin and his Proteges: Rather than authorizing the 
PLA to use the necessary force against mass organizations, 
Mao -- whose progeny these organizations were -- chose at 
first to try to negotiate agreements among contending 
mass organizations, or, where necessary, to choose among

them. In July 1967, the already agitated situation was 
made much worse when an MR commander refused to cooperate 
with a delegation from Peking which was dealing with 
mass organizations in his area. The MR commander was 
quickly broken, and Lin himself -- still clearly in a 
"radical" position -- threatened action against other 
such communders. In late July, Red Flag, the Party 
theoretical journal supervised by Chen Po-ta, head of the 
central CRG, called unmistakably for another substantial 
purge of the PLA. This call was in the spirit of Mao's 
earlier directives, and may have been explicitly approved 
by Mao (who was out of Peking at the time). Lin's response 
to this call still cannot be evaluated with confidence. 
On one hand, he called other MR leaders to Peking to 
give them some tough "instructions" -- inter alia, to 
obey orders from Chen Po-ta's CRG. On the other hand, he 
did not associate himself with the late July call for a 
larger purge. Possibly acting on new orders from Mao, 
other Party leaders -- including Chen Po-ta -- soon with-
drew the call for a larger purge. In late August, Mao 
himself went on record as opposed to a larger purge. 
Lin took early action to reshape the PLA/CRG, 
the special group charged earlier with purging the PLA. 
The previously ultramilitant Madame Mao was dropped from 
the group (surely with Mao's approval). Lin reorganized 
the PLA/CRG around a group of his own longtime and now 
closest proteges, some of whom had been under Red Guard 
attack earlier in the year, but who were not clearly iden-
tified with either "radical" or "conservative" positions. 
These included Wu Fa-hsien (the Air Force commander), 
Li Tso-peng (the Navy's first political officer), Chiu 
Hui-tso (the chief of Logistics) and Yeh Chun (Lin's 
wife, and the head of his staff office). All were to be 
accused in 1971 of conspiring with Lin against Mao. 
In the same period (August 1967), violence against 
objectives in an area of Chou En-lai's concern -- the Ministry

of Foreign Affairs, the foreign minister, and foreign 
missions -- reached its highest ?oint. This violence 
  25X1 . 
went so far as to place the Foreign Ministry under "revo-
lutionary rebel" control for a time, and culminated in the 
burning of the British mission and the beating of British 
officials in late August. Chou moved quickly -- appar-
ently intervening with Mao -- to regain control of the 
Ministry, to prevent the purge of his protege the foreign 
minister (although the latter became inactive), and to 
prohibit further violence against foreign missions.* 
Soon thereafter, with Mao now persuaded (whether 
by events or by persons) that the Revolution had moved 
too far to the left, Party leaders denounced the so-called 
"5/16 Group," an exceptionally militant mass organization. 
This group was to serve as the symbol of two discredited 
policies -- violence and threats against the PLA, and 
the whole spectrum of "Red Guard diplomacy" -- and, even 
more importantly, the offenses of "conspiracy" and 
political assassination. In September 1967, three 
secondary leaders of the CRG were purged -- in part for 
their own excesses, in part as scapegoats for the failure 
of policies which at one time Mao himself had encouraged. 
*Lin Piao's personal position on "Red Guard diplomacy" 
is not known. However, his earlier writings related to 
foreign affairs had strongly encouraged "people's war" 
against other governments, and had shown little sense of 
the value of conventional diplomacy. Moreover, Lin had 
joined Mao in June 1967 in giving a hero's welcome (Ilome 
from Indonesia) to the Chinese foreign officer who was 
soon to lead the attacks on the Foreign Ministry and 
foreign missions. At least so long as his own proteges 
were not under attack, Lin seemed in general to encourage 
radical" -- .2ven extreme -- initiatives.

However, Chen Po-ta and his close associate Madame Mao 
remained in Mao's favor. 
Soon thereafter -- sometime before January 1968 --
Lin Piao replaced the PLA/CRG with a Political Work Group 
which had roughly the same area of concern (indoctrina-
tion, examination and evaluation of PLA leaders), and 
he made it more responsive to the MAC -- through the MAC 
administrative unit -- than the PLA/CRG had been. The 
fortunes of Chen Po-ta's central CPG continued to decline, 
as in February 1968 another CRG leader was purged, and 
Chen himself may have had to make a self-criticism. In 
March, however, the CRG was able temporarily to reverse 
its decline. One of Lin Piao's own proteges, his C/S, 
gave the CRG this opportunity, by ordering the arrest 
of certain CRG staffers (probably PLA men) against the 
wishes of Madame Mao. The Madame prevailed, and the C/S 
and two other important military leaders, including the 
commander of the Peking Garrison, were purged. In the 
late March meeting which surfaced this case, Lin and Chou 
En-lai were both very deferential to the offended Madame 
Mao, and joined in praising the record of the central CRG 
in the Cultural Revolution. Ironically, Lin charged the 
purged group with the offenses which were to be attributed 
to himself and some other of his proteges in 1971 -- "con-
spiring," "plotting," "double-dealing," and building a 
"mountain stronghold." Indeed, Lin was already building 
a stronghold. This meeting announced two close proteges 
of Lin's -- Huang Yung-sheng and Wen Yu-cheng -- as 
respectively the new C/S of the PLA and the new commander 
of the Peking Garrison. 
In subsequent months, there was a striking trend 
in the staffing of China's provincial-level "revolutionary 
committees," the provisional organs of government while 
the Party was being rebuilt. The chairmanships of almost 
all of the provincial-level committees formed in this 
period were given to career military men. When the

establishment of these committees was completed in 
September 1968, the great majority were in military 
hands, and of the 11 most important of them -- in the 
provinces containing the Military Region headquarters 
all but one were in the hands of apparent proteges of 
Lin Piao.* 
Lin took several actions in that period of March - 
September 1968 to strengthen his position in the military 
establishment. His close protege Huang Yung-sheng, the 
new C/S, became concurrently the secretary-general of 
the MAC and the chief of the administrative unit which 
supervised the Political Work Group (the de facto General 
Political Department). And Lin reorganizTa the MAC
standing committee, its administrative unit, and the 
General Staff -- the regime's three most important organs

The most important of these proteges -- Huang Yung-sheng 
(who as C/S was the head of the ground forces), Wu Fa-
hsien (the CCAF commander), Li Tso-peng (the Navy poli-
tical officer), Chiu Hui-tso (the Logistics chief), and

strikingly his domination of the central military lead-
ership. The picture was almost as striking at the 
regional level.* 
As of autumn 1968, the high-priority task was to 
provide a "hard core" of Party leadership within the 
revolutionary committee structure throughout China. Mao 
-- one would suppose, with Lin's hearty agreement --
apparently meant to have the military leaders already in 
*Five of the 11 MR headquarters were under the commands 
of apparent proteges of Lin when the Cultural Revolution 
began: Shenyang, Nanking, Canton (three of the four most 
important), Tsinan, and Foochow. Two more -- Chengtu and 
Wuhan -- were reorganized in 1967 to come under the command 
of proteges of Lin. Two more -- Kunmi4 and Urumcht -- were 
reorganized to the same end in 1968. Another -- Lanchow --
was to be reorganized in 1969. (These regional proteges 
in general were not as close to Lin as were his proteges 
in the central military leadership: that is, they were 
not given the same degree of preferment during the Cultural 
Revolution, and did not work as intimately with Lin. But 
they were proteges in the conventional sense of the term: 
they had spent much of their careexs under Lin's command, 
had been advanced by him after he became Minister of 
Defense in 1959, and had beer shown favor by him in the 
Cultural Revolution.) The eteventh and most important 
-- the Peking MR -- was not under the command of proteges 
of Lin in this sense. However, from 1.967 to 1970 it was 
under the command of Cheng Wei-shan ?commander) and Li 
Hsueh-feng (political officer), who were both purged late 
in 1970 for conspiring w,;th Chen Po-ta. Lin himself was 
later to be charged with conspiring with those three in 
1970. In other words, the Peking MR until late 1970 was 
controlled -- if the Party can be believed -- by men tied 
e.ien more closely to Lin than were his recognized proteges.

place in the revolutionary committees dominate the provin-
cial-level Party committees as well. Authority in assembl-
ling and approving these Party committees was apparently 
divided between the military leaders outside Peking on 
one hand and the civilians of the central CRG on the other. 
That is, the "cores" of the forthcoming Party committees 
were apparently being proposed by the military men on the 
spot in the provinces and major municipalities, and were 
being approved by the CRG. In other words, Lin's PLA 
and Chen Po-ta's CRG were apparently working well together 
in 1968. 
The Ninth Party Congress: Lin Piao made the main 
political report to the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969. 
Chinese Communist briefings since Lin's fall have suggested 
that Mao was not pleased with Lin's report, but it is hard 
to fix on any part of that report which could have offended 
Mao at the time. 
In discussing Party-rebuilding, Lin's emphasis was 
on the need to put Party leadership at all levels in the 
hands of "true" Marxists. He meant Maoists, which as 
Mao and Lin had always defined it meant men who would 
follow Mao's lead wherever it took them. 
In reviewing foreign affairs, Lin took the 
approved line. He denounced both the United States ("the 
most ferocious enemy of the people of the whole world") 
and the USSR ("the Soviet revisionist renegade clique"), 
and strongly stated Peking's policy of support of "revolu-
tionary struggles" everywhere. While expressing Peking's 
favor for a negotiated settlement of the Sino-Soviet border 
dispute and for "peaceful coexistence" with the West, Lin 
called for preparations against a war launched by either 
the U.S. or USSR (or both). 
This Ninth Party Congress adopted a new Party Con-
stitution with an unprecedented provision confirming Lin 
Piao as Mao's successor without an election (thus heading 
off any possible election, after Mao's death, of the

more popular Chou En-lai), and providing for the Polit-
buro standing committee to reconstruct whatever central 
Party apparatus it might need. The Constitution did not 
provide for a new Party Secretariat, as the concept was 
still in disfavor and the central CRG was still acting 
as a de facto secretariat. 
The Ninth Party Congress went on to name a Central 
Committee composed in largest part (more than 40 percent) 
of PLA figures. This new Central Committee "elected" Mao 
and Lin as its only officers and named a five-man standing 
committee of the Politburo, identical with the de facto  
standing committee since 1966. This standing committee 
was composed of Mao, Lin, Chou, and the two ranking leaders 
of the CRG: Chen Po-ta, with whom Lin was later to be linked 
as a co-conspirator, and Kang Sheng, a security specialist 
who was to be sidelined in 1970 when Chen was purged. 
The new Politburo included Lin and five of the close 
proteges of Lin discussed above -- Huang, Wu, Li, Chiu, 
and Lin's wife.* It also included two somewhat less 
close proteges of Lin, the Shenyang and Nanking Military 
Region commanders Chen Hsi-lien and Hsu Shih-yu, and a 
protege of one of these proteges. Thus the PLA leaders 
constituted the largest group in the Politburo, and Lin 
and his closest proteges the most cohesive group in it. 
However, Lin's men did not constitute a majority. There 
uas clearly some distance yet for Lin to go, if he were 
to dominate either the Politburo standing committee or 
the full Politburo. 
Mao in his late April 1969 speech to the first 
plenum of the new Central Committee admonished the PLA's 
military administrators throughout China to do a better 
job. While rejecting the Soviet charge that the military

was too heavily represented in China's governing structure, 
Mao said that the solution to local problems lay with 
the military and that the solution to the military's prob-
lems lay in its work.* He went on to make several remarks 
-- addressed to all Central Committee members, expressly 
including Politburo members -- about the need to work 
carefully and avoid pride, and to proceed with particular 
care in rebuilding the Party. These remarks were the 
foundation of the subsequent campaign against "arrogance" 
and "complacency," especially on the part of the military 
administrators. 
Mao in this speech associated himself with Lin's 
call for "preparations against war" (both material and 
spiritual preparations), a call which was also to become 
a national campaign. Lin was later to be charged with 
offenses under this heading. 
In sum, Lin Piao seemed at the time to be in high 
favor with Mao, to be in a very strong position in the 
military structure, and to be moving toward a similarly 
strong position in the Party. His position in both the 
military and political structures, however, depended upon 
his retention of Mao's favor, and Mao had already made 
plain his concern about the responsiveness of the PLA 
-- the PLA for which Lin was responsible. As things were 
to turn out, Mao's attitude -- not Lin's position in the 
structure of power -- was to be decisive.

role -- not the numbers of PLA men in key posts, but the

II. Lin's Decline in Mao's 129aEsil12.6.9-70 
It is apparent in retrospect that at some time in 
the year following the Ninth Party Congress of April 1969 
Mao changed his mind about Lin Piao as his successor. It 
was probably in this period that Mao decided that Lin 
could not be relied upon to make the PLA -- still the 
governing apparatus -- reliably responsive to the civilian 
Party leadership. Lin may have been unreliable in other 
respects as well. For example, Lin's group may have 
been unwilling to accept the Mao-Chou line that the USSR 
had become the main enemy of China, In March 1970 Mao made 
a proposal which seemed to Lin to reflect a loss of confid-
ence in him -- the proposal not to restore the post of 
Chairman of the regime, Lin was right, because Mao soon 
took other organizational steps against him -- removing 
a Lin protege from command of the Peking Garrison, and 
placing the General Political Department under the lead-
ership of non-proteges of Lin,  
Mao took 
yet another step against Lin by reorganizing t1 Peking 
Military Region, again preventing Lin from installing his  
own men in the leading posts.\ 
 / By the end of 1970, Mao had 
apparentlystopped talking about Lin: he had probably, 
by this time, decided not only to replace Lin as his 
successor but to purge Lin and his closest proteges. 
Some Issues: The principal developments of the 
year following the Ninth Party Congress were Mao's in-
creasing concern about the responsiveness of the PLA to 
the civilian Party leadership, the growing Soviet military

threat to China and the Chinese response to that, the all-
out "investigation" of a mass organization (the "5/16" 
group) as a symbol of "conspiracy" against Party leaders, 
the related decline of the "radical"-led central Cultural 
Revolution Group, and the related rise of Chou En-lai, 
While the precise relationship among these interesting 
developments is still not clear, there were so many pos-
sibJe ramifications of each of them that it is not hard 
to believe that Lin got caught in some combination of 
circumstances that made him appear to disadvantage, 
Mao's admonitions to the PLA at the Ninth Party 
Congress rose rapidly to the level of a campaign to en-
sure that the PLA work under "Party" leadership and work 
much better than before, In the joint editorial on the 
Party's 48th anniversary (1 July), it was insisted with 
unusual shrillness that the Central Committee of the Party 
was "the only center of leadership for the whole Party, 
the whole army, and the people throughout the country," 
and, again, that the PLA must "accept the leadership of the 
Party,,?carry out to the letter the line, principles and 
policies of the Party's Central Committee personally 
formulated by the great leader Chairman Mao," The joint 
editorial on Army Day (1 August) emphasized that "much 
work remains to be done," that this work must not be 
"crude and careless," that "Chairman Mao's proletarian 
line on army building" must be carried out in a "better 
way," that this must be done "under the leadership of 
the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao as its 
leader," and so on 
The tone taken toward the PLA in the joint editorials 
on the same occasions in 1.968 had been very different 
The PLA wao then the great teacher of the Chinese people 
and the most redoubtable foe of "class enemies." Indeed, 
it was said, one's "attitude toward the PLA is the attitude 
toward the dictatorship of the proletariat" (meaning, the 
re-emerging Party and Mao himself)

While this campaign was never -- at least in its 
public manifestations -- of such intensity as to explain 
in itself the purge of the PLA's central leadership in 
September 1971, it seems likely that during 1969 the 
problem of the responsiveness of the PLA -- of the PLA 
for which Lin Piao was directly responsible -- came to be 
seen by Mac as the problem of Lin's own personal respon-
siveness to Mao, In other words, a Lin Piao who could 
not be relied upon in his principal area of concern could 
not be relied upon over the full range of concern of a 
successor to Mao. And there may well have been indica-
tions of Lin's unreliability in other areas of concern 
than the PLA. 
Throughout the spring and summer of 1969, the Rus-
sians were establishing a credible possibility of a large-
scale military attack on China. Lin himself in April 1969 
had called on the nation to take the Soviet "tactical" 
threat seriously. In May and June, Chinese spokesmen took 
note that China was being threatened (as it indeed was) 
by Soviet air attacks on its nuclear installations. In 
August, the Soviets wiped out a Chinese unit which crossed 
the border from Sinkiang. In early September, continuing 
to threaten Peking, the Soviet C/S publicly suggested the 
possibility of a Soviet operation against China's North-
east. 
The principal Chinese leaders -- Mao, Lin, and 
Chou -- responded in an apparently coordinated way. With 
Mao's permission, Chou on 11 September met with Kosygin 
and agreed to begin talks about the border, without insist-
ing on the earlier precondition that Moscow "recognize" 
the inequitable nature of the old traaties. And Lin in 
his annual National Day (1 October) speech was notably 
milder toward the USSR than he had been in his Party Con-
gress speech, denouncing tM US enemy by name but failing

to specify the source of "social-imperialism" (the USSR) 
or to refer to the border situation (the immediate mili-
tary threat). The border talks soon got underway.* 
Probably animated largely by Mao's hatred and fear 
of the Russians, Peking followed with an initiative toward 
the United States in December 1969, In response to the 
US- withdrawal of naval patrols from the Taiwan Strait in 
November, Peking in December stated for the first time 
its willingness to receive the American representative in 
the Chinese Embassy in Poland in order to resume the 
Sino-American talks. In this double step forward, the 
talks were resumed in January 1970. 
Lin 'a relations with the Russians had always seemed 
to run parallel with Mao's, Living in the USSR from 1938 
to 1941, under treatment for wounds, Lin had got on well 
with the Russians, but on returning to Yenan in 1942 he 
had supported Mao in putting down the more pro-Soviet CCP 
leaders. As the commander of Chinese Communist forces 
in the Northeast (Manchuria) in 1945-48, he had ,again got 
on well with the Russians, but he had apparently not 
developed the special relationship with them which was 
attributed to certain other Chinese leaders later purged, 
From the late 1950s, with the Sino-Soviet split, Lin had 
joined Mao in downgrading Soviet military doctrine and 
practice. Throughout the 1960s, Lin in his public pro-
nouncements had denounced Soviet positions in the same 
terms that Mao did, and in his unpublished talks had been 
as scornful of the Russians -- professionally and per-
sonally -- as Mao could wish,

There was, on the face of it, no good reason for 
any Chinese military leader to oppose these moves to 
reduce tension with both of China's principal enemies.  
 J It was in this period between April and December 
1969 that the Party first formulated the line -- later to 
be withdrawn, then restored -- that the USSR  was China's  
main enemy, replacing the US in that role, 
25X1 
It had been presumed all along that some Chinese 
military leaders had opposed the break with the USSR 
-- with its consequent depressing effect on Chinese mili-
tary development and its imposition on the Chinese military 
establishment of another major enemy -- although after the 
purge of Peng Te-huai they would have kept quiet about 
it. Even among those who had genuinely supported Mao in 
the break, some Chinese military leaders -- men who had 
been Communists all their adult lives -- could be expected 
to be unable to regard the USSR as their main enemy and to 
act on this belief. It is possible that ITE-Piao was 
among their number, that certain of his proteges agreed 
with him, that this group was simply unable to make the 
shift, and that this became evident to Mao in Party meet-
ings or in private conversation. 
As a related issue, there was the continuing "pre-
parations against war" campaign, After Lin's fall, he 
and other military leaders were to be charged with having 
used the campaign as a cover for preparations for a 
military takeover. The campaign would of course have 
permitted military leaders to strengthen their positions, 
and they were to be expressly chaz.jed with having prepared 
'iarious headquarters and bases for use in a "coup," This 
will be touched on later.

Another related issue, during the spring and sum-
mer of 1969, was a renewal of disruptive behavior by mass 
organizations in China -- i.e. by their representatives 
in, or seeking places in, "revolutionary committees" and 
new Party committees throughout China. This misbehavior 
disappointed the expressed hopes of Mao (and Lin) for 
"unity" in the constructive stage of the Cultural Revolu-
tion- Peking's pronouncements showed a strong concern 
over the problems of factionalism and "anarchism," and 
related the latter to the threat qf a Soviet attack; as 
Chou En-lai said, such "internal weakness" would encourage 
Soviet aggression, Thus the PLA was again authorized to 
use whatever degree of force was necessary to restore  
order By December 1969,/ 
there began an all-out "investigation" of the infamous 
5/16 Group, the most militant of all mass organizations, 
the symbol of repudiated "ultraleft" positions of all 
kinds, the symbol of "conspiracy" against Party leaders, 
and the symbol of a recent grisly fact of Chinese life 
-- political assassinations,* 
4The 5/16 Group had unquestionably carried out assas-
sinations of rival leaders of mass organizations, and 
may have made attempts even on Party leaders, One such 
attempt may have been made in March 1970 -- on Hsieh Fu-
chih, the Minister of Public Security -- while the in-
vestigation of the 5/16 Group was underway, and this in  
turn may have been an important factor 
in the replacement of  the Peking Garrison commander, 
protege Wen Yu-cheng-1

It would not have been hard, in the winter of 
1969-70, to make a case relating Lin Piao to the 5/16 
Group, For one thing, Lin had been the source of incendiary 
statements to mass organizations. Further, Lin had, on 25X1 
the record, minimized the offenses of PLA members of the 
5/16 Group, describing them as true "Leftists" who had  
made mistakes.r 
Thus the most that can be said is that the investigation 
of the 5/16 Group in the winter of 1969-70 may have turned 
up something damaging to Lin and certain of his military 
proteges -- some evidence, say, of "double-dealing," of 
conspiring against other Party leaders (e.g, Chou) with 
the leaders of. the 5/16 Group -- which was made known to 
Mao and which Mao kept to himself for later use, not 
permitting it to be reflected in the Party documents of 
1970. 
The central Cultural Revolution Group (CRG), which 
may have been inactive for some months in its role as 
the Party's de facto secretariat, disappeared from view 
in December 1969 and was never thereafter reported to be 
acting in any capacity whatever. The civilian "radicals" 
heading the CRG who were to fall into disgrace (Chen Po-
ta) or to become inactive (Kang Sheng) during 1970 were ap-
parently in decline during the winter of 1969-70, a decline 
reflected in the abolition of their organizational base 
of power, the CRG, Moreover, Chou En-lai was described 
by Party leaders in 1970 as the Party's de facto secretary-
general -- replacing both Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng in 
that role -- and it seems reasonable to believe that 
Chou began to play that role at about the time the central 
CRG disappeared, i,e, in the early winter of 1969-70,

Although Lin and Chou appeared at the time to have 
resolved their earlier differences and to be playing 
complementary roles, it seems possible in retrospect 
-- with the benefit of more information on the activities 
of both men -- that Lin began at that time to see Chou 
as a threat to his own plans for dominating the Party 
apparatus, If so, he may have attempted -- as some later 
materials suggest -- to restrict Chou's authority in 
the role of de facto secretary-general, or even to prevent 
Chou from occupTETthe post at all, If so, this could 
have brought Lin into serious conflict with Mao during 
the winter, because-there is abundant evidence -- not 
only in the reporting but in the entire course of Chinese 
policy after the Ninth Party Congress -- that by this time 
Chou was in the highest possible favor with Mao and was, 
indeed, his principal advisor and favorite lieutenant,* 
Mao's Crucial ProE2sal: Whatever the combination 
of circumstances that brought Lin into disfavor with 
Mao by or during the winter of 1969-70, in March 1970 
Mao made a proposal which set in motion the train of 
events culminating in the destruction of Lin and the 
purge of his closest proteges in September 1971: This 
proposal was not to restore, in the new State Constitution, 
the post of Chairman of the regime -- a post parallel 
to, although far less important than, Mao's own post of 
Chairman of the Party, and which had been vacant since 
*It is ironical that this one of Mao's Z1 utenants who 
had been least predisposed to radical and militant courses 
had risen to the position of Mao's most influential ad-
visor by the end of a militant Cultural Revolution designed 
for radical ends- But Chou seems never to have put him-
self in the position of seeming disloyal to Mao, which 
for Mao has always been the ultimate test

the purge of Liu Shao-chi in 1966, The post itself had 
been an empty one, in practice -- of symbolic importance 
only, another "Chairman" to stand beside the one true 
Chairman  as his designated successor. Yet there is much 
evidence /that Lin thought the post 
important, and wanted at least to restore it -- even if 
he were not to occupy it himself immediately. 
Lin's willingness to stake so much on this ques-
tion of the Chairmanship is probably the hardest thing to 
explain in developments of recent years, Lin's calcula-
tion as to the importance of the post itself must have 
been based on two considerations. One was that the Chair-
man would be the principal officer of the government, 
ranking Premier Chou En-lai. The other was that, at 
least under the old Constitution, the Chairman was the 
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and was autonomous 
in this role, not responsible to any other organ of 
government. If it was Lin's belief that Mao at the time 
was building up Chou En-lai and the government machinery 
as a counter-weight to Lin and the PLA (much as he had 
earlier built up Lin and the PLA against Liu Shao-chi 
and the Party apparatus), it would have made some sense 
for Lin to try to get the post of Chairman restored and, 
sooner or later, to get control of it, This would have 
given him superiority over Chew in all three hierarchies 
-- Party, military, government -- and in particular (al-
though evidence is lacking that Liu Shao-chi in the post 
ever so much as moved a platoon) would have given him 
rather than Chou the right to name the Minister of Defense. 
It did not make good sense -- in fact, it was a disastrous 
mistake -- for Lin to make an iEsue of this post, because 
Lin over the years had had abundant opportunity to 
recognize the hazards of revealing personal ambition (as 
distinct from accepting responsibilities thrust upon him). 
But Lin apparently regarded Mao's attitude toward the 
restoration of the post -- and its eventual occupancy 
by Lin -- as a critical test of Mao's attitude toward

the Party plenum later in 1970) soon reached the judgment 
that he was ready to test his own strength against Mao's 
will. 
It is not known at what time Mao made the actual 
decision not to restore the post-- but it was sometime 
before the plenum of August-September 1970, when it was 
revealed that he had made and reaffirmed this decision. 
Mao and Lin were the two principal officers of the com-
mittee formed In July 1970 to write the new Cdnstitution, 
and Mao may have made the decision -- and informed Lin 
df it -- at that time. 
The Second Plenum: It was apparently just prior 
to the Party Plenum of August-September 1970 that Mao 
made two changes in the central military leadership which 
were damaging to Lin. He removed Lin's protege Wen Yu-
cheng (who last appeared on 1 June) from the critically 
important post of commander of the Peking Garrison/ 
 i Mao did not permit Lin to replace Wen with another 
protege.* Moreover, Li Te-sheng, who was not a protege 
The exact time of Wen's removal is not known, but 
he had made frequent appearances before his last appear-
ance, so it is reasonable to believe that he was removed 
soon after his last one, i.e,, that he was out before 
late August. The new Peking Garrison commander was not 
identified until September 1971, but none of the Garri-
son's officers in that intervening 15 months was a protege 
of either Lin or Huang Yung-sheng.

directors of this highly important Department, one was 
an apparent protege of Lin's, the other was not.

Lin's Status in Late 1970: However the question 
of the Chairmanship was handled at the second plenum, and 
whatever the handling of the miljeary leaders thereafter, 
Lin knew beyond doubt by the end of 1970 that he had 
declined in Mao's eyes. This knowledge was almost cer-
tainly reinforced by Lin's inability, at that time, to 
replace the purged leaders of the Peking MR with his own 
men. It was obvious at the time that Lin would want to 
have his proteges in those key,posts just as in other 
MR headquarters, and it was regarded 'as? an anomaly that 
he did not.* Lin had now -- by the end of 1970 -- lost 
out on four key posts in a row -- the Garrison, the GPD,  
and the two MR posts.r 
/It does seem

ers or acting leaders wnre not identified (and have still

in retrospect that Mao, during the second half of 1970, 
was taking important organizational steps in Peking to 
prepare for a showdown with Lin and his proteges. When 
the showdown came, in September 1971, the necessary 
military forces -- immediately, the Garrison forces, and 
ill reserve, the MR forces -- were in Mao's hands. 
In Edgar Snow's interviews with Mao in thc; late 
months of 197 
there was a striking lack of re erence to 
Lin in Mao's remarks. Although Lin had again made the 
National Day (1 October) address in 1970 -- which 
was to prove to be his last public speech -- and People's  
Daily had begun at that time the practice of featuring 
photographs of Mao and Lin together (rather than Mao alone), 
Mao by late 1970 had apparently stopped talking about Lin 
altogether, as his successor or anything else. Moreover, 
Snow learned (apparently from Mao), and Chou confirme'., 
that Chou -- not Lin -- was "in charge" of rebuildiny 
the Party. Moreover, even in talking with Snow about 
their new policy toward the United States -- to explore 
the possibilities for an improvement in relations at the 
government-to-government level, while emphasizing initia-
tives which would mobilize the American people against 
their government -- Mao and Chou did not associate Lin 
as Mao's successor with this new line, as would have been 
expected. 
In these talks with Snow in late 1970, Mao showed 
considerable sensitivity to China's appearance of being 
dominated beneath his own level by the PLA. (Indeed, 
this sensitivity seemed at the time to be a possible 
explanation of Mao's failure to talk about Lill.) Mao 
described the PLA's admittedly striking degree of power 
as "temporary," and he defended the overall militari2ation 
of Chinese society as necessary in view of the Soviet 
military threat -- which had in fact seemed to be his

reasoning at the time. (Chou En-lai took a similar line 
with Snow on the role of the PLA, emphasizing the long-
standing principle of Party leadership.) Mao told Snow 
that it would be wrong to judge his success in renewing 
the leadership as a whole solely on the basis of observa-
tion of the national and provincial leaders (mainly PLA 
figures), that the bulk of the new leadership produced 
by the Cultural Revolution was to be found at the county 
level, the "next generation" of Party leaders. Such 
remarks were further indications that Mao was not satis-
fied with the responsiveness of the military administra-
tors, who were soon to be subjected to sharp public 
criticism. 
Snow did meet briefly with Lin and found him to 
be feeble but relaxed and affable. Snow did not conclude 
that Lin was in disfavor or thought himself to be, al-
though Snow was understandably much more impressed by 
Chou and -- correctly, as it turned out -- thought Chou  
to be playing the more important role of the two.-
 / More-
over, the regime's media continued to describe Lin as 
"deputy leader," to present him as well as Mao as the 
authority for the Party's policies, and to give him high 
praise; pictures of Lin and Mao were displayed on important 
occasions, and Mao-Lin badges were issued.* 
In sum, it seems likely, in retrospect, that by 
the end of 1970 Mao had decided not only to replace Lin 
Piao as his successor but to purge Lin and his closest

situation was desperate,*

III. The Approach to the Crisis, 1971  
It is credible, as alleged, that in or about Janu-
ary 1971 Lin Piao and his closest proteges began to plan 
a "coup" against Mao, in the belief that they themselves 
would otherwise be purged. It is also credible, as further 
alleged, that the group's design from the start included a 
plan to :all Mao if necessary. But it is not alleged 
that Mao discovered any such plans that early. 
In the early months of 1971, Mao was visibly con-
cerned -- still concerned, as he had been since 1969 --
with the problem of the reliability and responsiveness of 
PLA figures as administrators, throughout China. There 
seems to have been a small purge of the PLA -- not reaching 
to the top levels -- at that time. During the spring 
of 1971, Mao continued to approve the appointment of PLA 
figures -- including proteges of Lin -- to key positions, 
approval which must have reflected a calculation that in 
the event of a Mao-Lin showdown he could split the great 
majority of them off from Lin. However, the timing of 
Mao's decisive move against Lin may have been moved up  
/during the spring of 1971/ 
By June, Mao probably had an additional reason 
to purge Lin's group -- its opposition to the Mao-Chou 
foreign policy, specifically to the plan to receive 
President Nixon, Mao may have begun, as early as June, 
the talks with military-political leaders outside Peking 
in which he successfully sought assurances of their sup-
port in a showdown with Lin's group. And he may have 
taken additional steps against Lin's group in Peking it-
self -- mainly concerned with assuring his own control 
of Peking -- in the early summer.

The new provincial-level Party committees began 
to surface in December 1970, in the same pattern as the 
earlier revolutionary committees and Party core groups 
-- mostly dominated by military men, and almost all of 
the most important of them (in provinces containing the 
11 MR headquarters) headed by proteges of Lin Piao. Even 
in retrospect, this is not startling, as these leaders 
(for the most part) had been selected long before, and 
had been approved by Mao and Chou. The practical problem 
for Mao in this connection, assuming that he had already

decided to purge Lin and his closest proteges at the center, 
was how to prevent Lin from using the MR headquarters 
against him, 
By late February 1971 the regime's military adminis-
trators at all levels were coming under heavy fire -- e.g. 
from Red Flag -- for "arrogance" and "complacency," and 
Peking airected that all cadres of the Party apparatus 
-- in which the military were most prominent -- undergo 
"open-door rectification" of these shortcomings, The 
Military Regions -- apparently beginning with the Shenyang 
MR -- began at this time to hold "political and ideological 
work" meetings concerned expressly with these problems. 
The proceedings of one such (later) meeting show it to 
have concluded that many PLA men in the structure of power 
-- including secretaries of local (non-PLA) Party com-
mittees -- were unxeasonable and imperious, suppressed 
their critics, acted in opposition to Party policies, 
and even committed crimes. PLA leaders had all too often 
acted independently of local Party committees, had 
made decisions within the PLA's own Party committees 
and had imposed them on the local Party committees, had 
forced the local Party committees to seek PLA approval 
of their actions, and so on. PLA organs and personnel 
were henceforth to accept their subordination to local 
Party committees, or, if the local Party committee were 
headed -- as, at the provincial level, most were -- by 
men who were active PLA leaders concurrently, the civilian 
members were to be given larger roles. 
A small purge of the PLA seems to have been set in 
motion in the early months of 1971. It did not reach as 
high as the ranking figures of the MAC and General Staff 
(positions held concurrently by the Politburo-level lead-
ers who were to be purged in September), but many illus-
trious faces were missing in the early months of 1971 
or made their last appearance on or about May Day, and 
some of them were probably purged before summer 1971. 
The missing included (and still include) the director of

the Operations Department of the General Staff, two 
deputy directors of the General Logistics Department, 
many national and regional leaders of the Air Force (the 
service arm apparently hardest hit), some Navy figures, 
some of the leaders of the Artillery and Armored forces, 
and some of the leaders of less important arms such 'As 
Engineers and Railway Engineers and Signals.*

Lin's "Bases": As previovaly noted, Mao probably 
concluded in the year following the Ninth Party Congress 
that Lin could not be relied upon to make the PLA properly 
responsive to Mao and other civilian Party leadership, 
had apparently begun to take organizational steps against 
Lin in Peking no later than the summer of 1970, and by the 
end of 1970 had probably marked Lin for purging. It is 
a striking fact that the appointments of military leaders 
continued in the early months of 1971, after this progres-
sion in Mao's thinking, and in a period in which Mao was 
visibly concerned about the problem of the responsiveness 
of the PLA. These appointments were striking both at the 
national level -- in the central Party apparatus and the 
central government machinery -- and at the provincial 
level, that is in the new provincial-level Party committees. 
*There was a curious development affecting the Air Force. 
Deliveries of military aircraft to operating forces sharply 
declined, from early 1971, while production increased, 
causing an unprecedented backlog of undelivered aircraft. 
One possible explanation is a belief that the Air Force 
was not to be trusted with these new aircraft, although 
it is not at all clear what use it was feared that these  
aircraft would be put to.

 IJin'o principal 
otfense was that of attempting to install as many of his 
proteges as possible in key posts in the military establish-
ment and in the developing Party and governmental appara-
tus. it was an offense in which Lin appeared at 
least until June to have the collaboration of Mao and 
Chou, the latter making and the former approving such 
appointments. 
There is no entirely satisfactory explanation of 
these appointments. While it is true that failure to 
confirm in their posts men who had been selected long 
before would have given Lin's group warning that Mao 
intended to move against the group, Lin had already been 
given sufficient warning to lead him to conclude by the 
end of 1970 that he was marked for purging. The only 
credible explanation of these continuing appointments of 
Lin's proteges thus seems to be a calculation by Mao 
that, in the event of a Mao-Lin showdown, the great 
majority of Lin's proteges would side with Mao rather 
than with Lin. If so, this calculation was to prove 
correct, in the summer of 1971.

In any case, Mao's concern about "bases".-- whether 
political or military -- that might be used against him 
was to be reflected in the 1 July joint editorial on 
the 50th anniversary of the Party's founding. The edi-
torial inter alia denounced early leaders of the Party 
who in their "organizational line.,,practiced sectarianism 
and deprived Chairman Mao of his power," foresaw a "pro-
tracted struggle" to consolidate the "dictatorship of the 
proletariat politically, ideologically,.., and organiza-
tionally," and emphasized the need to "uphold democratic 
centralism" -- that is, to recognize the supreme authority 
of the Party center, to be obedient to higher levels, as 
opposed to the concept of "many centers, i.e, no center." 
This editorial reaffirmed Mao's precept that "the Party 
commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to 
command the Party."* 
The sssue was pretty clearly not the existence of so 
many military leaders in key positions, as they continued 
to be assigned to them after the time that Mao had deciZed

"Debates" on Foreign Policy: The media's highly 
favorable treatment of Lin Piao -- giving him the beginn-
ings of a "personality cult" -- continued through spring 
1971. Lin arrived and departed with Mao on the occasion 
of May Day, looking terrible (huddled in a greatcoat, 
while other Party leaders wore no coats), but otherwise 
giving every appearance of being, as billed, Mao's closest 
comrade and successor- At least through May, Chou En-lai 
was presenting himself as acting in general on the "in-
structions" of Lin.as well as Mao-
By the end of May, however, Chinese Communist lead-
ers had almost certainly had some of the "debates" about 
foreign policy which Peking's spokesmen (including Chou 
En-lai) subsequently admitted having had -- in particular, 
about the new stance toward the United States, as the time 
was rapidly approaching to make the actual arrangements 
for President Nixon's visit.* It was suggested above

Party committees were announced in August 1971, the mili-

men (12 commanders, eight political officers), all of 
whom apparently retained their military posts; only seven 
were old Party cadres, two were men with police backgrounds, 
and none was a representative of a mass organization. In 
most of the provincial committees headed by old Party 
cadres, the next two ranking secretaries were career 25X1

that Lin and his proteges may have been among those who, 
in 1969, had been unable to make the shift that fixed 
the USSR as China's main enemy, and that Mao may have 
seen this. If so, therl position had perhaps looked 
better for a time in spring 1970, when the US incursion 
into Cambodia provoked Mao to a thunderous denunciation 
(20 May) restoring the United States to its long-standing 
position as the main enemy. But, as previously noted, 
by late 1970 the USSR had again been fixed as the main 
enemy, and Mao and Chou, in telling Edgar Snow about 
their intention to explore the possibilities for an im-
provement in relations with the United States at the 25X1 
government-to-government level, did not associate Lin 
with this initiative.

defend their new line with their biggest gun, as if the 
"debate" had persisted to the time of writing and was 
about to be declared at an end. It was emphasized that 
Mao himself stood behind the new line toward the United 
States. Whereas Liu Shao-chi's line had been "capitula-
tionist," Mao's policy of negotiations (the argument went) 
was very different. As Mao had long ago said, 
How to give 'tit for tat' depends 
on the situation?, If they wanted to 
negotiate, sometimes not going to 
negotiations was tit for tat, and 
sometimes going to negotiations was 
also tit for tat, 
The editorial reminded its readers that Mao "went to 
Chungking [in 1945] in person for negotiations? -- which, 
admittedly, had failed, but had "exposed" the enemy for 
all to see, It was evident that Mao and Chou in 1971 had 
high hopes for something more than "exposing" the enemy: 
they saw a good chance for positive gains, and were angry 
with those who were unwilling to make the shift and/or 
to accept the small degree of risk, This editorial went 
on to denounce "hidden traitors who have illicit rela-
tions with foreign countries," another matter entirely. 
On the assumption that the Party is telling the 
truth in its charge that Lin opposed the Mao-Chou line, 
it is not hard to believe that some of his close proteges 
supported him in Party meetings, For them as for Lin, 
there were obvious grounds to stand on -- either of 
basic affinities with the USSR, so that Moscow by definition 
could not be the main enemy, or of prudence in the face 
of the Soviet threat, so that the dangerous Russians should 
be placated, rather than antagonized by conciliatory 
gestures toward the distant and -- on the record of recent 
years -- less dangerous United States,

Some Possible Moves A ainst Lin: Lin Piao made 
what was to prove is Iastublic appearance on 3 June. 
On 7 June, Hsu Shih-yu, commander of the Nanking Military 
Region, made what was to be his last publi.: appearance for 
almost eight months. The reasons for Hsu's disappearance 
were most uncertain. He had appeared to be a favorite 
of both Mao and Lin Piao (himself still in Mao's apparent 
favor), and in a very strong position-* 
*Hsu had begun his association with Lin in the 1930s, 
and stayed with him through World War II. From the mid-
40s, he was a leading figure in the East China area, no 
longer connected with Lin. However, when Lin became Min-
ister o: Defense in 1959, he appointed Hsu as one of his 
deputiee, with Hsu remaining in the Nanking MR. Hsu was 
one of the few military leaders to whom Lin confided his 
plans for purging the PLA in 1966 Hsu thus appeared to 
qualify as a protege of Lin's, if not as close a protege 
as some of the military leaders in Peking and Canton 
Mao entered Hsu's life in a critical way in early 1967, 
when Hsu was under attack by mass organizations and ambi-
tious military subordinates in his MR: Mao took Hsu with 
him to Shanghai, and then to Peking for several months, 
while the threat to Hsu was being dealt with. Again in 
1968 Hsu was defended against attack, this time by Kang 
Sheng'speaking expressly in Mao's name

Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010047-5 
The reasons are still uncertain. If Mao were fully  
confident of Hsu, and had information to the effect that 
Lin's group was plotting against him in East China, it 
might seem reasonable to keep Hsu in Nanking. Thus Hsu 
may have been brought to Peking under suspicion, for 
examination and evaluation, and held there for many months 
before being returned to Nanking early in 1972 with all 
of his military and political titles and apparently in 
high favor. But it is also possible that Hsu was the 
first of the military-political leaders outside Peking to 
be consulted by Mao on his plans for purging Lin and 
others, and that Hsu was brought to Peking to assume a 
key military position in Peking itself -- e.g. acting 
commander of the Peking MR -- in this time of troubles, 
and in anticipation of a period of crisis. Hsu's prin-
cipal deputy in the Nanking MR was brought to Peking at 
about the same time as a deputy C/S, and other proteges 
of Hsu were soon named to other key posts in Peking and 
in some of thu MR headquarters,* 
*Mao's arrangements for assuring the reliability of 
the Peking MR can only be conjectured- After the purge 
of the MR commander and first political officer in late 
19703 Peking simply refused to identify those acting in 
those capacities. Li Te-sheng, the prot,ege of Hsu Shih-
yu who appeared in August 1970 as Director of the 
General Political Department, was much later reported 
to be acting as the Peking MR commander concurrently; he 
may have assumed the post in summer 1970. Chi Teng-kuei, 
a young Party leader in Honan and an apparent protege 
of Mao himself, who (like Li) had been named an alternate 
member of the Politburo in 1969, was apparently brought 
to Peking in 1970 and was later reported to be the first 
political officer of the Peking MR; if so, he too may have 
assumed this post as early as summer 1970L

Another important step that might have been taken 
at about the same time was the strengthening, for Mao's 
purposes, of the Peking Garrison. While the Garrison 
had been reorganized in. 1970, its commander and first 
political officer had not been identified. Wu Chung, not 
a protege of any member of Lin's group, is known to have 
been the Garrison commander by September 1971, and had 
apparently held this post for some months before September. 
Similarly, Wu Te, an old Party cadre with a police back-
ground who was acting head of the Party's Peking committee 
in the absence of the disabled Hsieh Fu-chih, was making 
appearances suggesting that he was concurrently the first 
political officer of the Peking Garrison (a pattern also 
observed in Shanghai, where Mao's man Chang Chun-chiao 
had held both posts for some time). 
Two visible developments in early July suggested 
the possibility that Mao was preparing the Party for some 
change in Lin Piao's status. The 1 July joint editorial 
cited above did praise Lin by name as both a compiler 
and an exegete of Mao's thought, specifying under the 
latter heading Lin's report to the Ninth Party Congress 
in spring 1969. The editorial also called for Party 
rebuilding to continue under Lin as "deputy leader" as 
well as Mao as leader. It did not, however, discuss the 
matters taken up in Lin's report, and it did not specify 
any recent contributions made by Lin, and thus carried 
at least a faint implication -- noted by some observers 
at the time -- that Lin's current role was less important 
than his past roles.* 
Moreover, during Dr. Kissinger's visit to Peking 
in the second week of July (9-11 July), the old Marshal 
Yeh Chien-ying met the U.S. delegation and was the Chinese 
military representative (there was no American opposite 
*In retrospect, one passage takes ,:ad aim at Lin's 
group: "It is essential thoroughly to expose the... 
conspirators, careerists, renegades and enemy agents,..

foreign countries..."

number) throughout the talks between Dr. Kissinger and 
Chou En-lai. Despite his lack of a government post (which 
Lin did have, as Minister of Defense), Yeh acted as the 
chief of the delegation when Chou was otherwise engaged, 
and the Chinese in conversation emphasized the overall 
importance of Yeh. Yeh's role in the talks could reason-
ably be interpreted in terms of his far greater experience 
(than Lin) in dealing with Americans and in terms of Lin's 
illness (he was soon reported ill again).* But Mao may 
have been thinking ahead, to the time when Yeh would surface 
as his principal military aide, a role which Yeh was to 
assume fully in September. The civilian Party leaders 
apparently feared that Yeh's eminence would be taken by the 
Chinese audience as meaning a concomitant and radical 
decline in Lin's status, because Peking did not reveal to 
that audience Yeh's role in the talks. There had indeed 
been such a decline in Lin's status, but Mao and his 
lieutenants still in favor -- e.g., Chou, Yeh -- did not 
want that to be generally known until they had made the 
necessary arrangements to deal with its consequences. 
Some of these arrangements -- those that could be 
made in Peking -- have been discussed above. Others had 
to be made outside Peking. Among the most important of 
these were talks with MR leaders, other than whatever 
talks with leaders of the Peking MR and Nanking MR that 
Mao had had before July.

on 11 July, not in connection with Dr. Kissinger's visit 
(which was of course not publicized at all at the time).

There may conceivably have been a prolonged meet-
ing of the MAC -- in Mao's absence -- in late July. Al-
most every important military leader in Peking was out 
of sight in the last week of July, and most were missing 
for the last two weeks. It is further conceivable that 
such a meeting -- in the absence also of Lin Piao, who 
was reported seriously ill in early August -- acted to 
replace Lin with Yeh Chien-ying as the de facto leader 
of the MAC. All this seems doubtful, however, as no MAC 
meeting at this time has been reported in the voluminous 
Party briefings, and these briefings indicate that Mao 
was not yet prepared to move decisively against Lin -- that 
is, that he was still engaged in talks with military-political 
leaders outside Peking as late as early September.

Mao's Talks with Regional Leaders: The decline in 
Lin Piao's status -- which seemed at the time well short 
of disgrace -- was reflected on Army Day, 1 August. With 
Lin himself missing since 3 June and his wife since 11 
July, the joint editorial for Army Day for the first time 
in years included no quotation from Lin, and his wife failed

to represent him at the Army Day reception.* Officially, 
Lin was "too sick" to make appearances, and he may really 
have been sick, even incapacitated, as was later reported. 
This may help to explain Mao's apparent unconcern about 
what Gin might be doing, in the way of carrying out a 
coup or making preparations for one, in Mao's absence. 
The PartS7's story, however, is that Lin was well enough 
at least to attempt to activate an assassination plan and 
to make contingent preparations to flee. 
As previously suggested, Mao by the end of June 
may have taken further steps to place the Peking Garrison 
and the Peking MR under the command of officers loyal to 
himself and had talked with at least some of the leaders 
of the Nanking MR, may have talked with other regional 
leaders in July or early August, and may have stopped at 
the Wuhan MR headquarters in Central China on his 
way south in August, although such talks cannot be documented. 
In any case, Party briefings -- so widely disseminated 
that refugees and travellers have supplied details of 
them to the non-Communist press -- place Mao at a 
point in the South China area (probably Changsha) 'in or 
about mid-August (when Mao and the regional leaders con-
cerned were alike out of sight). 25X1

The Aborted "Assassination" and "Coup": The Party's 
official story asserts that Lin's group -- in this brief 
remaining period of Lin's freedom -- atbmpted in early 
September to activate a plan to assassinate Mao, an assas-

takeover,* However, the briefings vary considerably on 
the matter of the assassination plans: the means to be 
employed, the parties involved, the places, the dates, 
the number of times that the plotters attempted to activate 
their plans (one, three or five), and the means by which 
these plans were frustrated (by a repentant conspirator, 
or the hired assassin himself, or Lin's daughter, or what-
ever). The most common version is that Lin and his 
proteges did commission at least one attempt on Mao in 
Shanghai or some other point in East China in early 
September, and were frustrated by some combination of 
poor planning, faulty execution, and bad luck.** Almost

in March 1970 has been noted. Later in 1970, Chen Po-ta 
was charged with plotting the assassination of Madame Mao. 
Li Tien-yu, whose death after illness was announced in 
September 1970, may have been assassinated. In December 
1970, the sudden death of Tan Fu-jen, the top-ranking Party 25X1 
leader in Yunnan, was reported to be an assassination

all accounts agree that the attempt was aborted -- that 
is, no bullet was fired, no bomb set off. Lin's group 
simply tried to arrange for this to be done, and were 
unable to get it carried through. 
The alleged attempt to activate the plan is con-
25X1 ? 
sistent with other parts of the story. ( 
There are three difficulties in accepting the Party's 
story of an attempt to carry out an assassinatic,1 plan. 
One is that the Party has seemed to tell too many differ-
ent stories about it, as if trying and discarding various 
versions until it found one that was credible. For another, 
one would suppose that the commissioners of an assassination 
would attempt to conceal their identification with it, 
whereas all versions of the alleged attempt trace it easily 
to Lin's group, even to documents written by Lin's gloup. 
For another, it is hard to understand why a Chairman Mao 
who had discovered, prior to 12 September -- as most 
accounts of Party briefings have it -- that Lin and others 
had already attempted to have him killed, would have al-
lowed Lin to remain free and his Trident to remain avail-
able to him, and would not have ordered the seizure of

others in Peking. It would seem that nothing more than 
a telephone call would have been needed to immobilize 
both Lin and the plane at Peitaiho, whereas the air stand-
down apparently cid not begin until the morning hours of 
13 September, after the flight from Peitaiho.* And Lin's 
proteges in Peking were not immediately arrested. More-
over, the flight itself apparently came as a shock to Mao, 
as it should not have been if those with access to the 
plane were failed assassins. 
None of these difficulties seems insurmountable. 
There may be a single official version, garbled by its 
many voices and audiences. The commissioners of the assas-
sination may indeed have tried to conceal their connection 
with the plan, but were betrayed by a single one of their 
group or its agents (as several accounts say). Mao may 
have felt that Lin was impotent in Peitaiho, may have 
ordered the air standdown earlier than the time it became 
apparent (and Lin evaded it, as some accounts suggest), 
anci may have felt that Lin's proteges in Peking were al-
ready neutralized by his own men. 
As previously suggested, the existence of an as-
sassination plan -- a plan to kill Mao if necessary --
is entirely credible. But the question of whether the 
conspirators tried to activate their plan while Mao was 
in Shanghai in early September has to remain open. 
it is conceivable that Mao deliberately permitted Lin 
to flee, in order to make the overall case against him 
more credible. This is very doubtful, however, in view 
of Lin's potential value to the USSR, if only as a source 
of information on Chinese affairs (cf. the Party's charge 
that Lin on his.; flight was bearing China's national 
defense plans and other sensitive materials).

Additional information on Lin's plans may have 
come to Mao from a variety of sources: from the regional 
leaders with whom Mao had leen talking, in particular 
from Chang Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-yuan in Shanghai (both 
Politburo members who shuttled between Peking and Shanghai), 
from Chou En-lai or Yeh Chien-ying or Madame Mao in Peking, 
or even from Lin's daughter (as some accounts assert, al-
though it is hard to believe that Lin would have taken 
his daughter, who could play no useful role, into his 
confidence; and most versions assert more credibly that 
Lin's daughter informed other Party leaders only of Lin's 
plans to flee).

Ironically, on 11 September",, People's 
Daily was prominently advertising the forthcoming pub-
lication of "50 historic photographs" of Mao and Lin 
-- mostly of Mao, but several of Lin -- as if Lin were 
still in the highest favor. While it is possible that 
one of Lin's supporters in Peking was responsible for 
this initiative, the supervisor if not director of propa-
ganda was Mao's man 7ao Wen-yuan, and it seems more likely 
that this advertisement was a part of the deception 
campaign which was soon to become systematic. 
Mao's Return to Peking: Accounts agree that Mao 
returned to Peking, probably by car or train, on 12 September, 
at least a day earlier than originally planned. Mao is 
said to have arrived in Peking at about 1600. A Party 
meeting -- perhaps largely of military leaders -- was 
convened that same evening, either by Mao or by Chou En-
lai acting in Mao's name. There is independent confirma-
tion, by foreign observers in Peking, of such a meeting 
at that time. 
Mao's hand was forced, to a degree, by the forth-
coming meeting of the National People's Congress, scheduled 
to open on 20 September. He had decided -- on whatever 
grounds -- to purge Lin and his proteges, so he could 
not allow the NPC to reconfirm Lin as his successor or 
to fill either of the key government posts -- Chairman of 
the NPC or Premier -- with one of Lin's men. But Mao 
had a week to take care of this, and the 12 September 
meeting held immediately on his return has to be explained 
on other grounds.

The urgency of the Party meeting of 12 September 
can be explained either in terms of Mao's belief that he 
had narrowly escaped assassination or of his belief that 
Lin was planning a cou ainst him ( robably entailing 
assassination). 
In 
connection with this Party meeting, it seems virtually 
certain that Mao ordered into action, to protect himself 
and other Party leaders, that unit of the Peking Garrison 
charged with the physical protection of Central Committee 
members, and that he cut Lin's military proteges in Peking 
off from command of their forces, taking direct command 
as Chairman of the MAC and sending his orders through  
Chou En-lai and Yeh Chien-ying,  
Mao's intention to purge Lin and others, together 
with his reasons for doing so, was almost certainly made 
clear -- whether by himself or by Chou -- at this meeting. 
His intention to prolong the meeting in order to deter-
mine the extent of Lin's support was probably made clear 
also. 
Lin's Flight and Death: Most accounts suggest that 
Lin, who had known since early September that Mao regarded 
Lin as plotting against him and that Mao planned to purge 
him, had  made his own plans to flee if necessary. In most 
accounts  /which 
include allegations of attempts to arrange Mao's assassina-
tion, Lin's plans were contingent on the fortunes of his 
plans to kill Mao. These accounts suggest that Lin, know-
ing sometime before 12 September that his "coup" had already 
failed and knowing that his implication in recent moves 
against Mao was known to Mao or fearing that it would 
become known, activated his escape plan, fixing his flight

for 0700 on 13 September -- prior to the time at which 
Mao was originally scheduled to return. Several accounts 
agree that Mao's return to Peking earlier than expected 
-- whether 'as the survivor of an assassination plan or 
as the Party's leader intending to purge Lin for other 
reasons -- caused Lin to hastily revise his plan, updating 
the flight for the night of 12-13 September. Such a 
revision may have been speeded as well by information 
reaching Lin about the Party meeting and related events 
on 12 September.* It does seem that the flight of the 
Trident on the night of 12-13 September was hastily 
organized and poorly prepared. 
It cannot be proved that Lin Piao and his wife 
and son were among the nine persons killed in the Trident 
which crashed and burned at about 0300 on 13 September 
near Khentai in Outer Mongolia, close to the Soviet border 
and on a line with the  big air complex at Irkutsk (the 
apparent destination).

The Disposition of Lin's Proteges: An almost-
complete air standdown was apparently imposed in the 
early hours of 13 September -- surely on Mao's order --
in order to prevent any further such flights and to keep 
all remaining military leaders in place while the Party  
meeting continued and things were sorted out.r

The Party meeting which had been convened on 12 
September continued intensively. No Party leaders, 
whether military or civilian, made any appearance at all 
in the period 13-15 September. And the meeting remained 
in session until the fate of Lin's principal proteges 
had been decided. There is no evidence that the regional 
military leaders as a group attended this meeting; and 
indeed there is evidence -- the absence of flights --
that most of them did not attend, although some of the 
principal leaders of the Peking and Nanking MRs were al-
ready in Peking. 
Mao apparently adhered to the Chen Po-ta format in 
dealing with Huang, Wu, and Li -- and with a fourth Lin 
protege, Chiu Hui-tso, who remained free until 24 September. 
That is, Mao allowed a mountain of charges to accumulate 
against them, building the case deliberately. 
After the first four days of this meeting Party  
leaders began to come back into view. 
  On 19 September, the regime 
postponed the NPC (scheduled to open the next day), and 
at the same time cancelled the plans (if ever genuine) 
for a traditional National Day celebration. By 20 
September, Chou En-lai, Madame Mao and others were giving 
banquets again, and the Madame -- who had seemed to have 
an adversary relationship with most if not all of the 
purged military leaders -- was observed to be in unusu-
ally high spirits. The four above-named proteges of Lin 
were all officially charged and removed from their posts

on 24 or 25 September, 
dates consistent with the citations of Huang at the 
regional level as a person still nominally in authority 
as lat?. as 23-24 September, with Chiu's last public ap-
pearance on 24 September, and with Party briefings to 
the effect that the conspirators had been rolled up by 
25 September. Although the Party insists that these 
four -- Huang t Wu, Li, Chiu -- were implicated in Lin's 
plan to kill Mao (as well as the overall planning for a 
"coup"), there have been no reports of their execution.* 
Yeh Chien-ying, the senior active vice-chairman 
of the MAC, was reportedly named on 25 September to direct 
the MAC (still under Mao's chairmanship) and to act as 
Minister of National Defense, replacing Lin Piao in both 
roles. The crisis was over. 
The Roles of Others: As previously noted, some 
observers believe that Mao did not take the initiative 
in the destruction of Lin and the purge of Lin's proteges 
in September, an.1 that this course was forced upon Mao 
by other leaders.  But all accounts of the crisis 
 0:ve Mao the central role, from the start, 
in purging the military leaders, and it is believed that 
this billing can be accepted. 
However, these same official accounts do give 
credit to other leaders in assisting Mao in the crisis. 
The best of them give credit in particular to Chou En-lai 
*If they are not eventually executed, after the Party 
has wrung the last drop of information from them, it 
would seem that the Party does not fully believe its own 
story -- in other words, does not believe that they were 
among those planning to kill Mao. It seems most improbable 
that even Mao would think to "rehabilitate" an assassin,

and Yeh Chien-ying -- a version of events which tends 
to be confirmed by Chou's dislodgement of Lin as the 
second-ranking Party leader and by Yeh's rise to fourth 
place (behind Madame Mao, and replacing Huang) in the 
hierarchy publicized after the purge. Chou's great 
prestige and popularity and his and Yeh's good relations 
with most of China's military leaders must have proved 
very useful to Mao throughout the course of the Party 
meeting of 12-25 September and in preventing any important 
challenge to the purge from developing either in Peking  
or outside it. r 
There is the additional question of whether any 
of those leaders -- or others -- contributed to the 
purge of the military leaders by feeding Mao false or 
slanted information on their activities before Mao set 
out on his summer tour or during the tour -- especially 
in Shanghai, his last stop before returning to carry out 
the purge.' 
It is not hard to believe that some Party leaders close 
to Mao -- e.g. Madame Mao, in effect a rival for Mao's 
affections -- would have done what they could to encourage 
Mao's suspicions of Lin. The record also indicates that 
Chou En-lai, the most influential of Mao's lieutenants 
since 1969, was in conflict with Lin in some respects since 
1966 and in particular with regard to foreign policy. 
Similar cases could be made for other Party leaders. The 
record suggests, however, that Mao did not neld any help 
in changing his mind about Lin: that Lin compromised 
hirself before 1970 on at least the matter of the PLA's 
(and his own) responsiveness and probably on other matters, 
that he damaged himself seriously in 1970 by challenging 
Mao on the issue of the chairmanship of the regime, and

V. The Post-Lin Lire and Leadership  
The handling of the intensely embarrassing case 
of Lin Piao and his proteges, for both domestic and foreign 
audiences, has been a hard problem for Party leaders. 
The Party at first attempted to conceal the fall of Lin's 
group. Party briefings on the case did not begin until 
October. Public commentaries on the case have been in 
terms of "swindlers like Liu Shao-chi," emphasizing con-
spiracy and illicit organizational activity, but more 
recently blaming Lin's group for specific policies. [ 
25X1 
The PLA is being returned to a more nearly tradi-
tional role, and is being told that an obedient and humble 
PLA need not fear a large-scale purge. A fairly substantial 
purge of the PLA has already been carried out, but thus 
far on a smaller scale than might have been expected. 
Mao seems to remain the dominant figure, but is heavily 
dependent on Chou En-la., whose status and authority have 
been greatly enhanced. Mao and Chou are operating with 
a relatively small central team, composed largely of their 
own proteges. 
The Public Line: Lin Piao was a "deputy leader" 
in People's Daily as late as 16 September -- three days 
after his death -- and appeared in a provincial broadcast 
on 8 October. Neither Lin nor any member of his group has 
been mentioned by the media since then. Chinese officials 
have not admitted that Lin 
is dead (merely "politically eliminated"), and there has 
been only a very selective media discussion of his crimes

(e.g. no mention or even implication that he is charged 
inter alia with planning the assassination of Chairman 
Mao). Just as in the case of Liu Shao-chi, who for a pro-
longed period after his fall was nut denounced by name, 
Lin's group is discussed in terms of "swindlers like 
Liu Shao-chi." 
The commentaries have of course emphasized the 
principle of Party leadership, as opposed to plotting, 
double-dealing, splitting, and so on. The favorite quota-
tion is Mao's "Practice Marxism, and not revisionism; 
unite, and don't split; be open and above-board, and 
don't intrigue anu conspire." Many commentaries have 
denounced those who "put sectarianism into action organi-
zationally,... establish their own mountain strongholds, 
... form their own groups of diehard followers," and so 
on. 
25X1 
Recently, the media have been attributing to Lin's 
group -- by strong implication -- a range of repudiated 
political, economic and military policies. These policies 
have been both to the Left and to the Right of Mao the 
moving Center, and in general it is not possible on present 
evidence to identify Lin's group -- as distinct from Mao 
and other leaders -- with them. 
While Peking has been insisting on the principle 
of the Party's "absolute leadership" and upon the need 
for a center and for obedience to that center (inter alia 
denouncing the purged military leaders for their alleged 
principle of "many centers"), there has continued to be 
public and private talk about "collective leadership" with-
in Party organs at all levels. This is applicable to all 
Party cadres, but seems aimed in particular at military 
administrators, high-handed ("arrogant") in the past.

  / Mao remains above the 
Party, "collective" leadership begins below his level. 
But where the Party begins, "collective" leadership is 
supposed to begin, and many articles and broadcasts have 
spelled out its operation at lower levels. 
Within Party committees, the importance of the 
first secretary is to be reduced. (This is to be true of 
PLA Party committees as well.) The importance of civilian 
cadres vis-a-vis the military is to be enhanced, just as 
local Party committees are to have more authority vis-a-vis 
military Party committees. The majority's will is to be 
respected. And so on. 
All this is to be "voluntary." The first secretary 
is voluntarily to reduce his authority. If he is a 
military man, he is voluntarily to give larger roles to 
the civilians. And while he must if necessary promote 
"correct minority views" (those in accord with national 
policies), he must not force them on the other Committee 
members.* The thought appears to be: everyone will 
"voluntarily" comply with the Party center's orders, be-
cause he knows that he will be purged if he does not. 
Party Briefings: Party cadres were told in Septem-
ber, and in some places well into October, that Lin and 
*He has no guidance as to how to proceed if the in-
correct majority refuses to accept the "correct" posi-
tion. He is trapped between the two imperatives of 
obedience to the center and submission to majority will.

briefings apparently began at the provincial level in 
early October. In some of them, Peking apologized for

indeed undermine the status and confidence of Party cadres 
for years to come, he did indeed incite the Red Guards 
and then turn on them, and he did indeed take steps to 
reduce the prestige and authority of the PLA after the 
1970 plenum. His policy has indeed been to keep the Chinese 
people poor and virtuous, exploiting them to the utmost 
to build the state. And his "revolutionary" diplomacy 
during the Cultural Revolution did indeed isolate and 
damage Peking. These are all charges that have been made 
against Mao before, charges which Chinese leaders and 
intellectuals have been purged for making, and which 
important elements of Chinese society probably -- as 
reported -- continue to believe. 
The effect of the Party's circulation of this 
document -- excerpts from which are appearing in the 
public media -- is to associate Lin with a number of 
popular grievances, as Party leaders are surely aware.  
 / While there are probably still some 
active leaders of the CCP who are happy to see this case 
made against Mao (and Chou is conceivably among them), 
the evidence is good that Mao himself took the initiative 
in circulating the document, on the rationale of "learn-
ing from negative examples." 
This is a practice peculiar to Mao, among Communist 
leaders. He did it in 1956-57, in the "hundred flowers" 
venture, when Chinese intellectuals criticized his "per-
sonality cult" and his persecution of them. He did it 
again in 1959, circulating criticisms of his "leap forward" 
venture made by the purged Defense Minister Peng Te-huai. 
He did it again in 1963, when Khrushchev's attacks on his 
policies were published in People's Daily and Red Flag. 
It is a form of ad hominem argument: the men E-Jking the 
criticisms are evil men, therefore the criticisms are 
invalid, and are discredited with the evil men. In the 
present case, criticism of Mao is attributed to the worst

of all Chinese "traitors," the only one of them charged 
to this time with having led a group of Party leaders  
which planned to kill the demigod Chairman Hao.*) 
Party media have cently denounced positions at-
tributed to Lin's group  One recent 
broadcast, for example, denounces those who will not 
persist in "class struggle," who have "maliciously slandered 
the dictatorship of the proletariat as 'dictatorship' 
and 'tyranny,'" who want to "liberate all reactionaries," 
who envis-ge a "fascist dictatorship," who are "peddling 
so-called 'genuine socialism,'" who want to "surrender to 
social-imperialism" (the USSR), who argue that "'when the 
people are rich, the country will be strong,'" and so on. 
There is a question as to whether all this will 
truly strengthen Mao's position. The case against him, 
25X1 
is a good one. While no mainland Chinese 
in his right mind could be expected to say publicly that 
he agrees with the case, private agreement seems likely 
to be reinforced by the consideration that Mao's own 
chosen successor took this view of him. Certain discredited 
leaders like Liu Shao-chi, and other active leaders such 
as Chou En-lai, would seem bound to look better by com-
parison.

The Purge Since September: The PLA has been told 
repeatedly that it is to be subordinated to the civilian 
Party leadership, that opposition to Party policies 
(including foreign policy) will not be tolerated, that 
Party policies must be faithfully implemented, that the 
PLA must learn humility, and that the authority of mili-
tary administrators vis-a-vis civilian Party cadres is in 
general to be reduced -- in other words, that the PLA 
is to be returned to a more nearly traditional role. It 
seems likely that the chastened PLA -- that is, the great 
majority of PLA leaders and officers -- will accept this, 
because the PLA has been told too that an obedient and 
humble PLA need not fear another large-scale purge, on 
the order of 1966-67. 
Actually, a fairly substantial purge of the PLA 
has already been carried out, particularly if those who 
ctropped out of sight in or just after the early months of 
1971 are included. However, some of those purged have pre-
sumably been charged with "arrogance and complacency" and 
other offenses, not directly related to the purge of Lin's 
group. Moreove;, the purge since the time of the purge 
of Lin's group in September has apparently been on a scale 
smaller than might have been expected -- somewhere between 
the small number implied by the Party and the large number 
that would have fallen if all of the proteges and Lin 
and those purged with him had been included.

There has apparently been no general exodus of 
PLA figures from the central government machinery. Almost 
all of the PLA veterans known or believed to head com-
missions and ministries have made appearances since the 
purge, and several of them have been identified in these 
posh. Indeed, the one new Minister surfaced since the 
purge is a PLA man.* The one visible difference, since 
the purge, is that PLA officers in government posts have 
tactfully ceased to wear their PLA uniforms. It is pos-
sible that -- apart from the officers of the Ministry 
of National Defense -- these veteran PLA officers no 
longer have any PLA connection, as there are no military 
ranks to be retained. They may simply be ex-PLA men, 
and may be reliably responsive to Chou En-lai and his 
lieutenants for the same reasons that induced Chou to 
appoint them in the first place. With rare exceptions 
(e.g. Pai Hsiang-kuo, who remains active), these PLA 
figures in government posts have not been regarded as 
proteges of Lin and other, purged leaders, but rather as 
reliable men with proven managerial skills. 
For more than five years the 11 Military Region 
(MR) headquarters have been the only regional authorities 
in China. Apart from the concentration of Lin Piao's 
proteges in concurrent posts in the MAC standing committee 
On PLA leader who had been serving as a Deputy Minister 
of Foreign Affairs has recently been reassigned as an 
ambassador, but another has replaced him,

and MAC administrative unit and General Staff prior to 
the purge, the most striking concentration of Lin or 
Lin/Huang proteges was found in these headquarters, with 
ten of the 11 under such commands at the time of the 
purge. As noted earlier, these men were in general not 
identified with Lin as closely -- not given the same 
degree of preferment during the Cultural Revolution --
as were the central leaders purged with him, but they 
were close enough to have their own status brought into 
question with Liligs fall. If the principal/protege rela-
tionship were the main criterion f_r rendering judgments 
on other military leaders after the purge, most of the 
top-level leaders in the MR headquarters could be expected 
to fall. 
25X1 
There were and are, however, two strong factors 
favoring most of the MR leaders, at least for the time 
being. One is that some are known -- and others presumed --
to have assured Mao of their support before his purge of 
the central leaders. Another is that a large-scale purge 
of the MR leaders -- on whom the central leaders still 
depend for the effective government of China outside 
Peking -- is unlikley while the central military leader-
ship is still being reorganized.

It may be that several of the MR leaders now in 
place and apparently in favor will be removed in the 
course of the next year or two, when the leaders in Peking 
feel secure enough to take action against certain of them 
left in place for the time being in the interest of 
stability after this first round of examination of them. 
But it looks as though most of them -- including many of 
the Lin/Huang proteges who occupied more than h7,1f of the 
top 44 positions in the MR headquarters at the time of 
Lin's and Huang's fall -- are going to survive. 
It has been surmised that one consequence of the 
purge of the central military leaders may be to put an 
end to the system of military-political leadership in 
which an MR commander or first political officer is con-
currently the first secretary of the provincial Party com-
mittee in which his MR headquarters is located. Develop-
ments since the purge suggest that this may have been under

consideration -- with each case examined, and decided on 
its merits -- but will not be general. Of the ten MR 
commanders who have held these top military and top poli-
tical positions in their areas concurrently, three have 
now been expressly identified in both posts since the 
purge. These are Hsu Shih-yu in Nanking, the late Chang 
Kuo-hua in Chengtu, and most recently Chen Hsi-lien in 
Shenyang.* In the other seven cases in which such dual 
identifications could have been made when the leader ap-
peared, the media have been evasive. 
As has been seen, the provincial leadership has a 
mixed military-political character. Of the 29 provincial-
level Party committees (26 provinces, three major muni-
cipalities), ten are or at least have been headed by MR 
leaders,' and in every one of the other CD cases the first 
secretary of the Party committee is known or believed to 
be the provincial MD or municipal garrison commander or 
first political officer, usually the latter. In those 19 
committees not headed by 'IR leaders, the Party committee 
post is generally more important than the corresponding 
military post. 
Of the 29 provincial-level first secretaries or 
acting first secretaries, only two -- Wang Chia-tao in 
*There is the possibly irrelevant fact that at least 
two of those three MR leaders -- Hsu and Chang -- had been 
shown special favcr by Mao himself in the past. Another 
Mao favorite, Li Ta-chang, may move up to replace Chang  
as first political officer in Szechuan.

Heilungkiang and Lan I-flung in Kweichow, both PLA men 
-- have failed to make appearances, in apparent favor, 
since September.* This figure is to a degree misleading, 
as others have been missing more recently: the examina-
tion of the provincial committees has certainly not been 
completed. But the general picture for the provincial 
first secretaries looks to be at least as good as for the 
MR leaders: most of them -- probably a large majority --
will survive. 
25X1 
The provincial-level military leadership (including 
the three major municipal garrisons) overlaps even more 
considerably with the provincial Party committee leadership 
than suggested above. In those cases in which the MD 
or Garrison commander or first political officer is the 
first secretary, the other is usually one of the subordinate 
secretaries. And in almost all provincial committees 
there is at least one additional military man, sometimes 
several. 
Relatively few -- not more than a dozen -- of the 
provincial-level commanders and first political officers 
of provincial MD's and major municipal garrisons have 
been regarded as proteges of Lin and Huang, who (outside 
Peking) preferred to concentrate their proteges in the 
far more powerful MR headquarters. Some of these pro-
vincial and municipal leaders too were given an opportunity 
to assure Mao of their support before the purge of Septem-
ber 1971. Four provincial MDs -- Liaoning, Shansi, Ninghsia, 
and Tsinghai -- have apparently been given new commanders 
since the purge, but in at least three of these cases the 
ex-commander remains in favor and in another key post. 
At least three second-ranking provincial secretaries 
-- in Chekiang, Fukien, and Hupei -- are believed to have 
been purged with Lin's group. All were PLA men, two of 
them Air Force officers.

Eighteen provincial MD commanders or first political 
officers, or their equivalents -- leaders of armies, for 
example -- are presently missing. None of the missing has 
thus far been named in Party documents and briefings as 
implicated with Lin's group, but some may yet be. Here 
again, some Lin/Huang proteges remain active and in apparent 
favor. 
As at the regional level, some provincial military 
leaders who are concurrently the provincial first secre-
taries may have to give up one of their posts. There has 
been only one case (Jen Jung in Tibet) since thern purge in 
which an individual has been solidly identified as holding 
the top military and political posts concurrently.* More-
over, there have been some cases in which positive action 
has apparently been taken to deprive a leader of one of 
his posts, or to prevent a military leader from filling 
a vacant political post. For example, in both Shansi 
and Ninghsia the commander/first secretary has apparently 
been replaced as commander while remaining as first secre-
tary; in Hunan, the first secretary of which was transferred 
to Peking, neither of the military men who were second-and-
third-ranking secretaries has been moved up; and similarly, 
in Tsinghai, the first secretary either retains the title 
after his transfer to Peking or it has been withheld from 
the ranking military figures in the province. There is 
no apparent intention to remove the military leaders from 
all political posts or the 2olitical leaders from all 
military posts, but the earlier concentrations of power 
*Again, the media have been evasive, suggesting inde-
cision. E.g. a first secretary is identified as a poli-
tical officer rather than first, or as a political officer 
of the MR rather than first political officer of the MD, 
or as a "responsible person."

may be reduced. Also, more old Party cadres may become 
political officers (cf. the recent appointments of Li 
Ta-chang in the Chengtu MR and of Wang Hung-wen to the 
Shanghai Garrison). 
The Present First Team: Mao (who is demonstrably 
not incapacitated) looks to be still the Party's dominant 
figure, in the terms in which he described his situation 
to Edgar Snow in late 1970; that is, he points the Taneral 
direction, formulates or approves the formulation of the 
regime's principal policies, and signs directives, leaving 
day-to-day operations to Chou En-lai and Chou's Party 
apparatus and government machinery. And he is probably 
still dominant in the same sense as seemed to be the case 
prior to the purge of Lin Piao and his proteges: namely, 
that he has the power to elevate or to purge any other 
Party leader or small group of leaders. 
It should be noted that Mao's domination appears 
to be increasingly qualified in important respects. He 
is old, his health is probably deteriorating, he is absent 
from Peking much of the time. It seems doubtful that he 
could point China in any general direction other than 
the one he has been taking since the Ninth Party Congress 
-- doubtful, that is, that he could turn China hard left 
again. He relies for the formulation of many and the 
implementation of all policies primarily on a man, Chou 
En-lai, whose predilections are not the same as his. He 
has probaply (as always before) created new opponents in 
the latest purge. He has lost prestige for his demonstrated 
bad judgment in selecting successors/ 
 /He is still heavily dependent on the PLA for 25X1 
governing China outside Peking. Should he change his 
mind again and try to pyrge Chou En-lai and Chou's group 
(in favor, say, of the civilian radicals), or try to 
return the PLA rapidly to its traditional role (replacing 
all of the PLA figures -- including Lin's proteges --

who head Party committees throughout China), there is 
considerable doubt that he could do it; it took him more 
than four years to purge Liu Shao-chi and his proteges, 
about two years to purge Lin Piao's group, and his time 
is running out. Increasingly, his lieutenants will be 
looking past him to the post-Mao situation, trying to 
secure their own positions by forming alliances and 
reaching agreements on policy with other leaders. More-
over,  this has 
probably already set off a process in which developments 
and decisions increasingly get away from Mao.* 
Nevertheless, the main lesson of the past ten 
years, for other Party leaders, has to be that one chal-
lenges Mao, or takes action behind Mao's back, only at 
great peril. Though somewhat tarnished, Mao is still 
the boss, still the source of ultimate authority. Mao 
has shown that he alone has been able to command the suf-
ficient allegiance of other Party leaders in a showdown 
with another Party leader or group. One would suppose that 
other Party leaders, while making what arrangements they 
can for their futures, would continue to try above all 
not to provoke the old man's suspicion or hostility. The 
chief near-term threat to Mao from other leaders looks 
still to be the possibility of assassination, commissioned 
by some comrade more intelligent and circumspect than Lin 
Piao. Mao's fear of assassination, evident in 1965 and 
stimulated again by the Lin Piao case, may have been 
a factor in his failure to appear as usual for May Day. 
Below Mao's level, as noted often before, the 
situation in the Chinese leadership can never be described 
as "stable," because Mao himself is not stable. Not 
even Chou En-lai, now clearly his favorite lieutenant, 
can regard himself as invulnerable. But Chou seems to 
manage his relationship with Mao very well, and seems to 
4Mao was out of sight from late February to late June, 
failing in that period to meet with two distinguished 
visitors whom he probably would have met if he had been 
feeling up to it. He reappeared for Madame Bandaranaike 
in June, and met another foreign visitor soon thereafter.

be in a strong position to resist any challenge by any 
leader below Mao's level. As the Party's de facto 
secretary-general, he is at the top of the Party apparatus, 
now supervised (and probably loosely) by Mao only. In 
this role he has probably acquired supervisory authority 
over the daily operations of the MAC and his old friend 
Yeh Chien-ying (who is also responsible to Mao as chair-
man of the MAC). He remains at the head of the government, 
directing the work of a very active vice-premier (his 
friend Li Hsien-nien) and of another vice-premiur and old 
friend (Nieh Jung-chen) who may be becoming active again, 
and of what is still a large number of commissions and 
ministries, including the Ministry of National Defense 
(Yeh Chien-ying again). The general direction of Chinese 
policy -- both domestic and foreign -- in the past three 
years has clearly been congenial to Chou, and he himself 
has probably formulated some of the most important of 
these policies, getting Mao's approval and giving Mao the 
credit. President Nixon's visit was a visible personal 
triumph for Chou. 
Chou is careful not to commit the mistake cornitted 
by Liu Shao-chi and Lin Piao: he is careful, that is, not 
to appear to be challenging or rivalling Mao. As observed 
during President Nixon's visit, Chou is very deferential to 
Mao: he gives Mao the credit for formulating even those 
policies which he has himself has formulated (even trifling 
things, such as the table-tennis team's slogan of "friend-
ship first, competition second," which was original with 
Chou), and he is careful to get Mao's approval for each 
important step he takes, for example.in drafting a joint 
communique. As noted above, even Chou is not truly safe; 
but it seems likely that the very clever and experienced 
Chou will survive and prosper. 
Mao and Chou are now the only two primary leaders. 
They seem to be operating with a relatively small central 
team, as was the case in the year prior to the Ninth Party 
Congress of April 1969. Seven members of that 14-man

elite team of 1968-69 have survived: Mao, Chou, Madame 
Mao, the propaganda specialists Chang Chun-chiao and Yao 
Wen-yuan, and the security specialists Kang Sheng and 
Wang Tung-hsing. (However, two of these, Madame Mao and 
Kang, appear to be little active, in effect set aside.) 
The six purged were two members of the Politburo standing 
committee (Lin Piao and Chen Po-ta) and four close proteges 
of Lin's. Another security specialist (Hsieh Fu-chih) 
died in favor. The missing faces appear to have been re-
placed by: (a) five or six military leaders, Yeh Chien-
ying, Li Te-sheng, Su Yu, Chiang Tsai-chien, Wang Hsin-ting, 
and perhaps Liu Hsien-chuan; (b) the three old Party 
cadres Chi Teng-kuei, Hua Kuo-feng and Wu Te; (c) Chou's 
factotum Li Hsien-nien; and (d) the foreign affairs special-
ists Keng Piao and Chi Peng-fei. Several of these who 
are not now members of the Politburo are expected to be 
added to that body in the course of restoring it to a 
strength of 20 or more. One recent appearance of "lead-
ing members of the...Party and state" has suggested that 
the old Marshal Hsu Hsiang-chien may be restored to thE 
Politburo, that the veteran Navy commander Hsiao Ching-
kuang may be added, and that the very old (80) writer Kuo 
Mo-jo may also be under consideration. All CCP Politburos 
have included venerable figures of little importance, like 
Hsu and Kuo. 
Prior to the latest purges, the organizational  
core of power had been the Politburo standing committee, 
which made those decisions which the Party's officers 
(then Mao and Lin) had not already made, including the 
decisions as to which matters to pass to the full Politburo 
for discussion and a possible vote. If the standing com-
mittee is again active, the obvious candidates for the 
vacancies are Yeh Chien-ying, Li Hsien-nien (both close 
to Chou), and one or more of the younger people more closely 
identified with Mao himself (i.e. Chang or Yao). 
The most important functions of the central Party 
apparatus are those of contrbl of the military establishment,

political control of economic organs, political security 
(investigation and evaluation), Party organizational 
work, propaganda, and liaison with foreign Communist 
parties. The ranking figures in these fields are all 
members of the small team named above. 
The standing committee of the MAC now probably con-
sists more or less of Yeh, the less active vice-chairmen 
Hsu Hsiang-chien and Nieh Jung-chen, the GPD director 
Li Te-sheng, the former C/S Su Yu, the deputy chiefs 
Chiang Tsai-chien and Hsiang Chung-hua and Wang Hsin-
ting (Wang has been reported as acting C/S), the mili-
tarily unlocated Liu Hsien-chuan, Hsiao Ching-kuang, 
the Peking Garrison commander Wu Chung and first poli-
tical officer Wu Te, the Politburo alternates Wang Tung-
hsing and Chi Teng-kuei, Deputy Minister of Defense Wang 
Shu-sheng, and some Military Region leaders who do not 
often get to Peking. The economic specialist on the 
first team is Li Hsien-nien, and Hua Kuo-feng is said 
to be in training for this work (which he used to do 
in Hunan). Political security looks to be primarily in 
the hands of Mao's man Wang Tung-hsing, who still heads 
the Central Committee staff office, with assists from 
Li Te-sheng and Wu Te. Party organizational work is 
apparently being supervised by either Chang Chun-chiao 
or Hua Kuo-feng (or possibly both), although a PLA 
officer may be the director of the Organization Depart-
ment. Chang Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-yuan still supervise 
propaganda work, and Yao may be the director of the 
Propaganda Department. The International Liaison Depart-
ment is known to be headed by Keng Piao. 
It is still not known whether Chou En-lai as de 
facto secretary-general is working with a small de facto  
secretariat or simply with the MAC leaders and central

department chiefs named above.* The obvious candidates 
for a Secretariat include the obvious candidates for the 
Politburo standing committee -- Yeh, Li, Chang, Yao --
plus, one would think, Wang Tung-hsing and Hua Kuo-feng. 
The necessary specialties would be represented in such 
a group. 
Will this team survive? or will this one too lose 
half of its members in another convulsion, when they are 
found to be "disloyal" to Mao, refusing to accept his 
institutional arrangements or to carry out his policies? 
Another genuine challenge to Mao seems unlikely. 
Although this judgment proved to be mistaken in the case 
of Lin Piao and his closest proteges, Chou En-lai and his 
friends and proteges ought to be happy with the present 
arrangements and policies. It will take some time -- one 
would think, years -- to exhaust the possibilities of the 
present policies and thus pose the issue of "loyalty" in 
a sharp form by a sudden reversal of course. Apart from 
the question of whether Mao still has "years," Chou at 
least has always been able to execute these reversals. 
The present military leaders, some of them close to Chou, 
look to be both more docile and under better control than 
Lin's group -- and are not proteges of a single military 
leader, as were those purged with Lin Piao. The remaining 
civilian "radicals" of the old central CRG may be less than 
happy with the present policies, but they have no base of 
power from which to challenge them; the most important 
and active of these "radicals," Chang and Yao, with Chi 
Teng-kuei and perhaps soon Hua Kno-feng, constitute the

relatively young group in the Politburo, those who, if 
they remain on their good behavior, have some chance of 
remaining in the leadership for many years to come. 
Mao himself seems to remain the principal threat 
to the members of this team. It is hard at best to carry 
out Mao's policies to his satisfaction, even without the 
problems of abrupt reversals of course and the search for 
scapegoats. Under the pressure of Mao's demands 
-- currently the demands for a Party apparatus and military 
establishment under strict civilian control, and (again 
in recognition of realities) for repudiation of the "ultra-
left" excesses of the Cultural Revolution -- any given 
leader can be found to be a secret sympathizer With Lin 
Piao, or to be engaged in "conspiracy," or to be deliber-
ately obstructing Mao's policies. Moreover, the still-
mismatched groups of Mao's lieutenants can be expected to 
continue to compete for Mao's favor, even if they do not 
challenge Mao himself in any way. Thus it can be judged 
with some confidence that some members of Mao's current 
central team -- both military and civilian -- will fall 
before Mao dies. Should Mao die before Chou, Chou could 
probably dominate the leadership (although not to the 
degree that Mao has dominated it), and, if so, could be 
expected to make further changes, reducing the importance 
of whatever "radical" ideologues remain. Should both 
Mao and Chou die in the next year or two, no single figure 
among the current leaders would seem strong enough to 
dominate the Party in any sense. There would have to 
be a "collective," whether called that or not. Ironically, 
the PLA, which has been put down so hard in the past year, 
would in those circumstances probably be in the best 
position to provide the dominant group or the dominant 
members of the group.
