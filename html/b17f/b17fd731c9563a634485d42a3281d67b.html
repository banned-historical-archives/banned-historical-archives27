plans for reorganization of the government during his

and asked them to keep their

"whiile matter of restructur-

"quite far along by mid-De-

along with this before the 
Congress convenes."

Ziegler initially announced efforts in his administration 
on Wednesday that top presi- and his re-election cam-
dential appointees had been paign. He asked at least one 
group for their descriptions of 
the job each was doing, to-

as to how the job might 'evolve 
or a description of another 
post the staffer. Might want. 
Leading officials have al-

ignations to give Mr. Nixon 
reorganizational freedom. The 
announcement had left the im-
pression that, while the Presi-
dent might be planning a 
major shakeup of some Cabi-
net offices and sub-Cabinet 
tend much beyond that. 
However, ? Ziegler empha-
sized today that resignations 
had been requested not only 
of Cabinet , members and 
White House staff, as well as 
'sub-Cabinet-level presidential 
appointees like under secretar-
ies, assistant secretaries and 
some bureau chiefs, but also 
"all Schedule C (personnel), 
those who receive an appoint-
ment by a department head or 
a Cabinet member." 
There are some 1,400 to 
1,800 persons In Schedule C 
lobs?non-career political, pol-

appointees distributed among 
the departments. , 
Usually they are replaced

tion letters. 
One such meeting was held' 
at the State Department on: 
Wednesday, where Secretary . 
William P. Rogers asked that 
all his top aides hand in the 
fro-forma resignation docu-
ments. 
Further, State Department 
spokesman Charles Bray said 
today in Washington that Rog-
ers had asked senior officials 
for ideas on how to promote 
promising younger officers to 
positions of responsibility.

"It goes beyond individuals.

problem and will be meeting 
again late today with two of 
his top White House assist-
into, Haldeman and John Ehr-

sessment leading to reorgani-
ation and restructuring dur-
ing the second term," said Zie-
gler. 
Ziegler said that after the 
President returns to Washing. 
ton from his home here, he 
will be holding a series of 
meetings with Cabinet mem-
bers into December to get 
their thinking, and then will 
start formulating his deci-
sions. 
"He has asked department 
heads, Cabinet heads, mem-
bers of the White House staff 
to provide him with their

Ziegler, is more efficient gov-

changes will be of a nature. 
that can be put into effeet by, 
the President himself, without; 
requiring submission to Con-
gress, while others might re-
quire congressional assent. He 
said the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget is preparing 
a study to show the areas 
where the President can act 
by himself. "Where the Presi-
dent can within the frame-
work of existing leislation 
make changes by executive ac-
tion, I assume he probably 
will," Ziegler said. 
He noted that Mr. Nixon 
had already sent some reorg-
anization requests to Congress 
two years ago. None passed. 
These called for reorganiza-
tion of the Interior, Com-
merce, Labor, Housing? 
Health, Education and Wel-
fare, Agriculture and Trans... 
portation departments?seven 
agencies in all.:?into five new, 
agencies: . Agriculture, Na-
tural Resources, Community,

Many of the changes recom-. 
mended by Mr. Nixon under 
that plan were first proposed,' 
two decades ago by a govern-
ment reorganization commis-
sion headed by former Presi-
dent Herbert Hoover. 
On other matters, Ziegler 
denied "ns a matter of absolute

WASHINGTON POST 
11 November 1972 
!Nixon Assessing Fi reign Policy Agencies 
By Spencer Rich 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla., Nov.. 
10?President Nixon has begun 
a major reassessment of the 
functions of all U.S. foreign * 
policy agencies, the White . 
House announced here today. . 
Deputy press secretary. Ger-' 
Aid L. Warren told reporters, 
, that the key question is the 
interrelationship between the 
State Department, which deals 
with foreign policy only, and 
other agencies such as the 
Treasury and Commerce de-
? partments that deal primarily. 
with other matters t ut also 
.have considerable, influence. 
over foreign policy questions. ; 
, Warren said, "It's a review . 
of the basic organization and i 
relations ... it involves organ- , 
ization. budget, personnel?all 
along the line." 
Warren said Henry A. Kis-
singer. the President's assistan' 
for national security, affairs,, 
ha& met with White House, 
:aides H. R. Haldeman and John' 
? Ehrlichman "into the night": 
Thursday on "the foreign pol-
icy structure." Neither Secre-
tary of State William P. Rogers', 
nor any other State Depart-
ment representative was pre-
Sent., 
Kissinger, Haldeman and 
Ehrlichman were part of the . 
presidential party that flew . 
here Wednesday for a stay of 
several days at the President's. 
Key Biscayne retreat. 
The foreign policy review is 
part of a broader reassessment 
of the functions of all federal 
agencies that Mr. Nixon has or-
dered to start off his second 
term. "The basic thing we're 
talking about is how to make 
WASHINGTON POST 
12 November 1972 
government operate better," i 
said Warren, 
In order to give himself al 
free hand to realign functions 
and get rid of personnel un-
responsive to his policies, the 
President has demanded that 
? 
all persons holding direct pres-
idential appointments to fed-
eral jobs, and all persons ap-
pointed to Schedule C jobs by 
Cabinet and agency heads sub-
mit pro-forma resignations. - 
: Warren emphasized again 
that no -decisions ? had been 
? - 
The problem of foreign pol-
icy coordination in recent 
years has been a substantial 
one. Although the State De-
partment traditionally is the 
arbiter of overseas and diplo-
matic policy, other agencies, 
have enormous influence over 
foreign policy and the White 
House has increasingly taken 
a direct role in foreign policy 
through such powerful aides 
as Kissinger, who has been the 
President's chief negotiator on 
Vietnam affairs. 
Decisions made by the 
Treasury Department on inter-1 
national currency matters, by 
the Commerce Department on I 
trade matters, by the Arms 
Control and Disarmament 
Agency, the Agency for Inter-
national Development, the De-
fense Department and the Ex-
port-Import Bank may have as 
much or more impact on the 
U.S. image and real position 
in the world as anything the 
State Department does at a 
given time. The ealignment 
of Western currencies forced 
by the United States on Treas-
? ury recommendation after the 
August 1971 economic crisis, 
for example, was a foreign, 
policy act of the most critical 
nature. 
The objective of the foreign 
policy reassessment, Warren 
indicated, is to obtain better 
coordination and execution of 
broad foreign policy questions. 
Warren said Mr. Nixon had 
met with Haldeman this morn-
ing to discuss various matters 
and had talked on the phone 
with Kissinger. He said Gen. 
Alexander Haig, Kissinger's 
deputy who has just arrived in 
Saigon, is 'expected ' be& In 
'Washington "sometime this 
iweekend." He refused to dis-
made yet on which of the res-
ignations would actually be ac-
cepted, or what plans for re-
organization would actually be 
adopted. White House, press 
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler 
said Thursday' that the Presi-
dent's thinking on these mat-
ters would be "quite far along" 
by mid-December. 
Warren said that he couldn't 
quarrel very much with news-
paper estimates that the total 
of persons required to submit 
Pro-forma letters of resigna-. 
ton was about 2,000, although 
he said this might be a?bit 
high. It is estimated that at 
least 1,400 to 1,800 persons', 
hold Schedule C jobs alone, 
Warren said letters of resig-
nation aren't being requested 
of 'regulatory agency ,Appoint, 
esawith fixed tenni-es, but he 
believed they are being sought 
from "Foreign Service officers 
at home -and abroad if an-
pointed by the President" and 
all U.S. attorneys. 
Warren said the President 
"will operate within the con-
fines of existing legislation" 
and "intends to make use of 
all the machinery available to 
the federal government to 
:make it more efficient." 
Cols n lasts 
atergate 
By Peter 
Washington Post 
KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine, 
Nov. 11 ? Charles W. Colson, 
special counsel to President 
Nixon, tonight denounced the 
reporting of the Watergate 
case by The Washington Post 
as "unconscionable," and said 
that its impact was to "erode 
somewhat public confidence 
In the institutions of govern-
ment," 
In a speech to the SocietY of 
New England editors meeting 
here, Colson said, "The charge 
of subverting the whole politi-
cal process, that is a fantasy, a 
work of fiction rivaling only 
ost 
orts 
Osnos 
Sts f t Wril 
'Gone With the Wind' in cir 
culation and 'Portnoy's Corn 
plaint' for indecency." 
? Colson, one of the Presi-
dealt with The Washington 
"Speaks to the press. He said 
that his remarks tonight were 
the first he had ever delivered 
to a group of newspaper edi-
The bulk of the remarks 
dealt Wittli The 
Post, and Colson singled out 
Executive Editor Benjamin C. 
Bradlee for special criticism. 
He said that "Mr. Bradlee now 
sees himself as the self-ap-
pointed leader of what Bos-
2 
ton's own Teddy White [Theo-
dore White, author of "The 
Making of the President" 
hooks] describes as the tiny 
fringe of arrogant elitists who 
infect the healthy mainstream 
of American journalism with 
their own peculiar view of the 
world." 
Colson, as other leading Re-
publican did before the elec-, 
tion, linked The Washington 
Post's reporting of the we-
were its "liberal" ties to 
George McGovern. 
He said; "The Post, I be-
Veattittft heffteis (51 moo@ 
McGovern did that he was in. 
deep political trouble with re-
spect to the real issues of the 
'72 election. . . . 
"So The Post, on its own

cuss the contents of a litteri 
which news stories had said 
Haig was carrying to South Yl 
etnamese President Nguyen: 
Van Thieu and said he had' 
"no information" on whether 
Kissinger will be leaving 
shortly for Paris or Hanoi. , 
Returning to the reorganiza,e 
thin theme, Warren said sto. 
ries that the President's reaS-, 
sessment of government func-1 
tions is designed "to arrogate 
more power to the President"' 
aren't correct. "That's not the, 
case at all," said Warren. "The' 
reason for this reassessment la 
to make government work bet-
ter." 
Report on Academy 
On . another matter, the 
White House released a sum-
mary of the April 1972 report 
of the Board of Visitors to the 
U.S. Air Force Academy. ,?A 
similar summary on the U.S. 
Military Academy had been 
released a day earlier. The Air 
Force report called the cadet 
honor code "a viable working , 
part of cadet life," but called 
for care "to insure that the in-
dividual rights of cadets un-
dergoing investigation under 
the honor code be scrupu-
lously protected." Higher pay,' 
for permanent professors, and 
improved runway and storage 
areas were also recommended., 
The report also recom-
mended that if the constitu 
tional amendment requiring 
equal rights for women is ap-; 
proved by the necessary '38 
states, "the Air Force be pre-
pared to comply. . . and that 
planning for the admission of 
women be based on the prem., 
Ise that existing admission, 
and graduation standards be 
maintained." 
initiative, began a daily-Page 1 
attack on the administration." 
He said that if McGovern 
wished to raise the Water-
gate case, "then it was fair, 
enough for him to talk about 
t. What I do think is uncon-
scionable is the way in which 
some elements of the media:

? WASHINGTON ? The hoped-for 
Vietnam settlement, if it materializes, 
would be a triumph of personal 
diplomacy. It could only have been 
accomplished by Henry Kissinger , 
working with the President alone. But, 
will the President draw the wrong 
lessons from this experience, as Well, 
as from his Moscow and Peking "tri?
umphs," about how to make policy? 
Whether or not these breakthroughs 
could have been achieved in a dif-
ferent manner, the question for the 
future is how they can be transformed 
into the stuff of everyday poliey. This 
Will require the inclusion of the for-, 
eign affairs bureaucracy in the Presi-
dent's plans. 
Who really knows what President 
Nixon and Mr. Kissinger are up to? : 
For three years, scholars, journalists,: 
legislators ? and even the President's 
own national security bureaucracy?
have debated? the meaning of the 
Nixon Doctrine. Is it simply a guise ? 
to continue the same old world-police-
man policies, a kind of cut-rate cold 
war? Is it a genuine effort to redefine' 
our world interests and refrain from 
military involvement in the Third*, 
World? Is it an attempt to construct' 
a "new alliance system" based on five 
major powers? If so, does it make' 
any sense to expect Japan and West-
ern Europe to play the same kind of 
political-military role in the world as 
the United States, Russia and China? 
'Who is privy to the Nixon-Kissinger 
, game plan? Who can carry on and, 
avoid "the petrification of the inter-
national system"? 
Certainly not the State Department.

"Some friction" is bound

nally has said with refresh- ; 
ing candor. 
A degree of friction and

Kissinger stepped in to bargain di-
rectly with the Russians. The. China 
gambit has been. entirely their show, 
like the Vietnam negotiations. And so; 
:it goes down the line with every; 
major 'foreign policy issue. 
? These moves may be counted as 
personal successes. But what about 
the professional? in the State Depart-
' ment who have to deal with these' 
issues on a day-to-day basis and who' 
will be around long after the '"mas-
ters" have gone? They have been left. 
? out in the cold. If they are not given, 
.to understand the underpinnings of: 
,the Nixon-Kissinger diplomacy andaf, 
they are not brought to accept its 
'wisdom, they will purposefully or in-, 
?advertently undermine that diplomacy, 
'in the future. 
? Neither is the Defense Department: 
in a position to carry on. While the: 
'President and Mr. Kissinger easily, 
,have grasped the mantle of diplomacy 
from State, they have not begun to 
;exercise control over Defense. The 
,time requirements for personal di-
. plomacy have 'left no time to watchl 
',over Secretary Laird's department. 
Military officers in Vietnam can' 
: carry out sustained bombing 'raids, 
over North Vietnam without apparent 
;authority to do so. And believing that, 
:massive spending on new weapons 
systems is necessary to his foreign 
policies, the President has failed to: 
exercise close control over the Defense' 
budget. What we' therefore appear to ? 
have is the confusing prospect of a 
peacetime foreign policy and a War-
'time defense budget. 
' Nor is the Congress able or willing 
to provide institutionalized support 
.for the Nixon-Kissinger policies. The' 
Congress remains a multiheaded body 
with such diverse views and levers of 
power that it cannot be expected to 
lead. So far, the Congress has been' 
awed and cowed by the foreign policy 
successes of the Nixon Administration. 
But underneath, many Congressmen 
onse 
are mistrustful. Key Congressional 
committees have sought in vain to 
establish regular contact with Mr. 
Kissinger to find out what he is doing.', 
Secretaries Laird and Rogers will not 
do. Without a routine basis of consul.' 
tation with the "master," irritated 
Congressional leaders are bound to: 
lay in wait for a foreign policy failure 
on which to pounce. 
It is that time of year when in the 
headiness of landslide victory at the 
polls, the President will let little things,', 
like avoiding the "petrification" of% 
the system fall through the cracks. 
More than a reshuffling of Presidential, 
appointees is needed. If the President. 
and Mr. Kissinger believe that much, 
of what they have done is worth pre-
serving, they should start institutionall; 
izing their policies now. These months; 
present an important opportunity to 
reveal and reinforce their vision. ' 
At the least, key assistant secre-
taries and desk officers at the State 
Department should be briefed by the. 
White House on what has been with-
held from them, given a chance to 
discuss the issues, and?most impor-; 
tantly?drawn into implementation 0f. 
the President's policies: 
The President and Mr. Kissinger 
should also question the assumption 
that higher defense spending is neces-? 
sary to a "generation of peace." In, 
fact, it will undercut it. Big power 
distrust thrives on spiraling defense, 
'spending, as well as vice versa. While, 
:the President and his adviser devote' 
their time to personal diplomacy, in 
creased military spending will rein-3 
)force superpower suspicions and con', 
fuse the American bureaucracy and' 
public about their leaders' goals. '

By Stephen S. Roserafeliali 
MR. HELMS, director of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, was publicly summoned to 
Camp David this week to participate in what 
the White House terms its "major" reassess- , 
ment of the American foreign policy struc-
ture. If his summons indicates that the 
United States' large secret intelligence es-
tablishment is to undergo the same ExeCti-
tive scrutiny being accorded the agencies , 
which operate more in the public eye, then 
. this is welcome and important news. 
Before saying more, I should perhapS' 
state that I am not one of those journalists 
with a close discreet working relationship 
with the CIA; for purposes of this article I 
. requested an on-the-record interview with 
Helms or his chosen representative and; did 
not receive one., 
It would seem self-evident, however, that 
is the United States moves from an era of 
confrontation to an era of negotiation, from ? 
? a time when Russia and Communism were 
' widely perceived as terribly menacing to a . 
? time when' both the country and the Ideol-
ogy are increasingly regarded as adequately 
? neighborly, then the role, of the CIA has got 
'. to be reviewed. . 
? Now, obviously a great nation must have a 
professional intelligence service. The imper- . 
atives of defense, not .to say elementary prise 
dence, demand it. A ease eini even be mado 
that a certain kind of technological Weill-
, gence Is more essential in a period of in-
cipient detente?In order to supply policy 
: makers and their publics with the assurance , 
they need in order to enter into 'new agree-
ments with old adversaries. 
THE SALT-I agreement apparently is uni- ? 
que in granting explicitly each side's right 
to lob intelligence satellites over the other's ? 
territory to count missiles, tests and so on. ? 
Presumably satellites would be similarly 
useful in verifying and in nourishing public 
confidence in any shifts made as a result of 
, the forthcoming European force reduction 
talks. In all cease-fire situations, Mideast, 
Indochina or what-have-you, intelligence, 
can be vital. 
In at least two areas, however, intelli-
gence needs review: for "dirty tricks" and 
? .for its secrecy. ? 
The act of 1947 setting up the CIA sped-' 
. fled that, in addition to intelligence duties, 
It was to perform, "such other functions" as , 
the National Security Council might direct.., 
? A "plans division!' was set up in 1951. Most 
CIA directors, including Helms, have come : 
up through Plans. The group seems to have 
.been active, and conspicuously so, through 
the 1950s, toppling uncooperative govern-
ments, harassing wayward Communists,' 
' etc. The whole atmosphere was permissive: 
It was President who ate up the James 
Bond books who let the Plans Division or-, 
?...?ganize Cuban exiles (and a few Americans): 
to Invade at the Bay of Pigs. 
4 
It is now murmured around town thateh 
deputy director for Plans, an old Helm! 
' matt, operates on a much tighter leash,: 
(doing no mhre, it is said, than the Republee 
cans are alleged to have done to the" 
Democrats); that the old problems of policy' 
:control and separation of intelligence from. 
operations are in hand; that the small and 
weak countries which once were the CIA'ife 
playgrounds are no longer so vulnerable to; 
its deeds. 
At the same time, one hears that the Pres-,: 
ident's old anti-Communist juices have not.. 
altogether stopped fermenting, and that he, 
receives and is responsive to reports time 
the Russians Still play some Pretty rottopl 
tricks and, by golly, we ought to show thine 
,? they can't do that to us and get away with it.,4 
WHATEVER THE TRUTH, I would sub-2 
mit that the time is ripe for the Congress toe 
review the dirty-tricks mandate it gave to': 
the CIA a quarter-century ago as the cold I; 
war was beginning to dominate the Asneri-1 
can outlook on the world. It is Inconsistent,e 
at the least, that the State Departmentit 
should now be zeroing in on measures tol 
combat "international terrorism" while the 
CIA retains a capacity to practice certain 
forms of it. Cuba's continuing lack of loveJ 
for the CIA, restated in its bid for hijacking 
talks last week, underscores, the point. ? ? ?ee. 
Secrecy is something else. No one who acei 
cepts the need for intelligence would argtie.i 
" that the whole process and products shouldi 
be made public. But no one concerned with 
the health of democracy can accept that con-1 
dition with equanimity. The general sense o2.1 
being at war with communism since World# 
War II has produced a far more secretIvel 
; government than we would want or tolerate% 
in other times. With that sense of 'being at 
' war danger fading, the rationale or spur for;. 
.1 secrecy diminishes accordingly. There la fur-.1 
titer the claim that. the 8(!crety 
the CIA may have undermined the larger ) 
job of conducting a wise policy, I.e., one well 
discussed and debated. ? ee 
This is the principal basis on which iSente-
tor Cooper earlier this year proposed that4 
the relevant act be amended to give the forei 
eign relations and defense committees off,-
,both houses access to the information and4 
analysis obtained by the CIA?exactly as.theq 
Atomic Energy Commission has given such; 
secret material for decades to the Jointe 
Committee on Atomic Energy. Preclietablye 
the President objected. The Foreign Rela-i 
tions Committee approved 'the proposed! 
amendment; the Armed Services Committeee 
otherwise preoccupied, did not act on it. 
Cooper is retiring but Senator Symington,, 
who has his own sense of the need to assert': 
the Congress' foreign policy responsibilities 
and his own record of concern for Improvinge 
congtessional oversight of the CIA, may be, 
prepared to receive the torch! He's No. 2 on 
Armed Services, too. ?  
A 
? The CIA is out of the news these days. Itu 
usually gets into the news only when it fouls'i 
up. But a lot more about its place in the new; 
bureaucratic and international scheme ofe 
things ought to be known. Whether the-
CIA's activities are all essential and whethere 
they are all organized efficiently are ques-e 
tions which a responsible Congress shoulde 
not want to leave to a Chief Executive hud-
dling privately out, in . the woods at Camp

such arrangements useful.. 
Rubber and tobacco, for 
example,, are being prod-

In addition, the Khmer 
Rouge have developed, by 
some accounts, an effective 
fighting force. that may he 
capable of challenging the 
Cambodian army on its own. 
Reliable troop strength 
figures are difficult to ob-
tain, but generally the 
Americans estimate the 
Cambodian army at 170,000, 
a figure regarded by other 
Western analysts as too 
high. Khmer Rouge armed 
strength is put at about 40,-

figures include support 
troops, such as transport. 
and supply units, some ana-

for the Khmer Rouge do 
not, so the fighting 
strengths may be more 
nearly equal than the fig-

"Some of the biggest oper-

mostly Khmer Rouge," one 
American said. 'The ques-
tion is whether they could 
keep it up without direct

. One thing on which there' 
is general agreement here 
among government officials, 
opposition politicians and 
foreign observers is that the 
prospects for a return by Si-

power. But Sihanouk contin-
ues to operate a government 
in exile, based in Peking, 
and to shop around the 
world for support for his 
claim to he the legitimate 
ruler of Cambodia. 
This has forced the

the diplomatic front, to go 
with its political and mili-

A Sense a., Asi 
iTies Between Asians, Americans Not Like13i to Lessen: 
14 
HONG KONG ? There is an 
intimate relation between the 
American presidential elections 
this year and developments in 
Asia ? seemingly, more por-
tentous than in past elections 
over almost two decades. 
It is not that the choice for 
the American voters between 
Mr. Nixon and Mr. McGovern 
involved a make-or-break deci-
sion. Even were the outcome in 
less doubt than seemed ap-
parent, the long-term itnplica-
tions of American policies and 
events stretch' out far beyond 
the difference between -the two 
candidates dismissed in the heat 
of a highly partisan debate. 
Truth is that Mr. McGovern 
would have found, as all opposi-
tion candidates for power in 
any society or Political system, 
that his alternatives once in the 
saddle were a good deal narro-
wer than when viewed by' a dis-
mounted rider. That, in pert at 
least, explains much of the in-
creasing conservatism of ? Mr. 
,McGovern's statements as the 
election deadline neared. 
What is crucial for Asia is the 
direction, and drift, of Ameri-
can policies which is unlikely to 
be more than modulated by the 
American President after the 
election. And it is on that 
theme ? where American pol-
icy in' Asia is headed ? that 
the election milestone gives us 
occasion to pause and reflect. 
Perhaps one should begin 
with the obvious: ?The relations 
of Asians and the Americans' 
are not really likely, to lessen in 
the coming decades. 
Controversial Position 
That may come as an ex-
tremely controversial, position 
.against the backdrop of the 
Nixon Doctrine and' the almost 
universally held thesis, both in 
Asia and the U.S., that America 
is withdrawing from the Asian 
scene. 
I say that American-Asian re-
lations will continue to be ex-
tensive and intensive because of 
two situations which are vir-
tually apolitical in Origin if not 
in result. 
,The U.S. economy, still grow-
ing at an enormous clip (in con-
crete terms) despite its prob-
lems of balance of payments 
and reordering of priorities, is 
likely to continue to be all im-
portant for most Asian pr4luc-
ers. The American maw will, in 
fact, chew up even more of the 
world's raw Materials and oth-
er produce in the years ahead. 
It is hard to see how given 
any scenario in the next decade' 
or so ? except total economic 
paralysis or nuclear holocaust 
? this factor will not' be a ma-
jor determinant in the Asian 
scene. 
More debatable, but I feel 
equally important, is the role 
the U.S. plays as the avant-
garde of modernization in the 
Asian scene. 
China may 'continue to, wear 
the blue suits of Communist or-
thodoxy for years to come. But 
for most of the Asian world, 
U.S. fashions ? from clothing 
to intellectual: fads .? is likely 
to be the pacesetter. 
? Whatever else George Mc, 
Govern's candidacy was, it.was 
profoundly the eXpression, 
this mood. His program comes 
out of those strains ot 
Amen-
can history that produced the 
periodic populist explosion, the 
know-nothing-ism, the Bryan-
ism, the Isolationists of the 
1930s. It is a full blown emel? 
tional retreat from dealing with. 
the cares of the non-American, 
an attempt to return to home-
spin virtues of a less COM-
plicated world. Alas! That. 
world no longer exists ? either 
for the. Asians or the Ameri-
cans. 
Hidden Persuaders 
The Americans with their 
vast- resources and weight in 
world attitudes, for better or 
for worse, are "hidden per-
suaders" on the world scene. It 
is the U.S. news magazines who 
have set the pattern for much ?

Underlying all this emotional

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia?
The war in Cambodia is go-
ing well for the North Viet-
namese, who have succeeded 
in completely restoring their 
Vietnam war sanctuaries in 
eastern Cambodia, informed 
military sources say. 
The sanctuaries are now at 
the same level they were in 
1970 when they were invaded 
by American and South Viet-
namese forces, the sources 
say, and the North Vietnam-
ese military position is even 
better than at that time. This 
leads to the belief that the 
North Vietnamese are not 
presently interested in a Cam-
bodian cease-fire. 
Since the allied invasion of 
Cambodia the North Vietnam-
ese have gained control of 
Cambodian towns such as 
Stung Treng and Kratie on the 
Mekong River and now control 
all of the east bank of the Me-
kong River in Cambodia apart 
from one or two small towns 
such as Svay.Rieng where the 
Cambodians are bottled up 
and kept inactive. 
The North Vietnamese also 
hold the border areas of South 
Vietnam contingous to Cam-
bodia, a bonus from this 
year's communist offensive in 
South Vietnam. 
'Going Full Blast' 
"The military situation here 
Is bad," an informed military 
source said "I don't like to be 
pessimistic but it's difficult' 
to find 'anything good. The 
sanctuaries are going full 
blast. The stuff is moving out 
of the big rubber plantations 
at Chu!) and down Highway 15 
into the Seven Mountains and 
other places in South Viet-
nam. It is coming from Laos 
down the Meking by Kratie." 
Some communist supplies 
are moving even onto the Me-
kong's west bank, bypassing 
Kompong T ho m, swinging 
west around Phnom Penh, then 
east again across the Me-
kong into South Vietnam. 
Informed military sources 
say the North Vietnamese are 
drawing on the Cambodian 
countryside which they and 
their Cambodian allies control 
for food to keep Cambodian 
sanctuaries and the North 
Vietnamese First, Fifth, Sixth, 
Seventh and Ninth divisions 
now mostly in South Vietnam 
going. 
The North Vietnamese ex-
ert salmost total control of 
of East Cambodia while the 
Cambodian communists in 
western Cambodia feed and 
support them with fuel, bat-
teries and other commodities, 
informed military sources said. 
Trail Terminus 
"Eastern Cambodia is just 
a staging area, rest and rec-
reation center and trail ter-
minus for Hanoi again," 
sources said. "All they have to 
worry about are further South 
Vietnamese incursions and the 
South Vietnamese are too hard 
pressed to do much in that 
line," sources said. 
North Vietnam has also been 
successful in building up the 
Cambodian communists in the 
countryside to the point where 
they can carry on much of the 
war against the Cambodian 
government, informed mili-
tary sources say. 
It is no longer North Viet-
namese or Viet Cong units 
which are cutting Cambodia's 
highways, Cambodian and 
other informed military sources 
admit. Now the units are most-
ly Cambodian communist units 
operating in battalion strength 
for the first time with a few 
Viet soldiers seeded amongst 
them and supported by Viet 
Cong heavy weapon platoons 
and sappers. 
Informed military sources 
say the communist strategy 
for Cambodia is to harass 
roads and towns bottling up 
Cambodian government forces 
? in the towns or forcing them 
to engage in useless road 
opening operations keeping 
them away from the country-
side. Meanwhile in the coun-
tryside the North Vietnamese 
are building up local Cambo-
dian forces to fight the gov-
ernment. 
Military suorces. said Com-
munists succeeded in doing 
this because the Cambodian 
government forces are poorly 
led though composed of some 
excellent fighting material'. 
"They just will not get off 
their butts and go out there, 
get out of the towns," inform-
ed sources said. 
Fighting this week In Cam-
bodia has reflected this pat-
tern. Cambodian communist 
forces cut highway 4 leading 
from Phnom Penh to its sea-
port Kompons Som. Cambod-
ian reds are in a good position 
on the heights overlooking the 
road passes and are now tying 
down a considerable Cambod-
ian government force trying 
to winkle them out. 
Communits forces are shell-
ing the towns of Takeo and 
Angtassom south of Phnom 
Penh penning in their Cam-
bodian garrisons from inter-
fering with communist traffic 
moving around them toward 
the Seven Mountains area of 
South Vietnam and tying up 
Cambodian relief forces. 
Garrison Encircled 
This weekend a mixed Cam-
bodian Vietnamese communist 
force encircled and entered 
the town of Oudong 20 miles 
north of 'Phnom Penh. From 
what I saw they could have 
enered Phnom Penh itself just 
by driving down the highway. 
Just, south of Oudong a Cam-
bodian villager, wet and mud-
dy stumbled out of a swamp. 
He said he had. escaped from 
a village just outside Oudong 
and that communists encircled 
the garrison and there were 
no Cambodian troops between 
the communists and where 
we Were about 1,000 yards 
further back on the highway. 
The villager said commu-1 
nists had arrived about one 
o'clock in the morning ,thatsc 
day and? about half were , 
Cambodians -and half were - 
Vietnamese. They were led 
by a Chinese who the villager 
judged from his accent livod. 
in Cambodia. They told:t.* 
villager to move to the "lib-
erated areas" but he didn't 
want to go and dodged into',l, 
the swamps. 
Coming from Phnom Penh'. 
there 
there were only three small 
outposts on the road which 
communists could probably

broke the communist en-s?

however, are achieving their 
objective of keeping the Cam-i'

PYRRHIC PLOY ? 
2. KIPEEFFER 
Mr. Pleifier is professor of zoology -or the University of, 
Montana and a co-can/lop oi Harvest of Deem Chemical' 
Warfare in Indochina (Fra Press/Macmillan). He visite( 
Cambodia in 1969 and 1971 and was in Hanoi era 1970. 
While on a visit to Hanoi in June 1979, my two comoana 
ions and I met with Premier Pham Van Dong. During the 
conversation, I asked the Premier to evaluate Nixon's in-
vasion of Cambodia which had occurred one month ear-
lier. His answer was straightforward: "It makes things 
very favorable for the success of onr revolution." By 
"our revolution" it suppgscd,him to mean ?the revolution 
of the Indochinese people against foreign invader. 
' . How well does Premier itham .Van Dong's 1970 
, 
ation accord with the situation of Cambodia in late 1972?? 
Recent dispatches from Indochini suggest that he knew 
What he was talking about. Atcording to the A.P. (Sep-
tember 1), only one-thir,d of Cambodia is Still under. 
"Khmer Republic" control. It has been revealed that the 
Inks used in the fall offensive against the An Loc area, 
(only a short distance from Saigon) came from the Chup 
Rubber Plantation and nearby areas in Cambodia. These 
are the very areas that President Nixon characterized 
. in April 1970 as "Communist sanctuaries" that must be 
cleaned out. 
? Two factors have been principally responsible for the 
'failure of Nixon's Cambodian policiei. First, the Presi-
dent was badly misinformed about past U.S.-Cambodian-
Vietnamese relations and about the situation on the Viet-
namese-Cambodian border prior, to the March 1970 
change in the Cambodian Government. For instance, in, 
his speech of April 30, 1970, announcing the U.S. ?in-
vasion of the Fishhook region of Cambodia, Mr. Nixon 
stated: "Tonight American and South Vietnamese units 
will attack the headquarters for the entire Communist 
military operation in 'South Vietnam. This key control 
center has been occupied by the North Vietnamese and 
Vietcong for five years in blatant violation of Cambodia's 
neutrality." Mr. Nixon, standing in front of a map of 
Cambodia, put his finger on the little town of Minot as 
he made this accusation. That puzzled me a great deal, 
for I had spent two days in and around Mimot about 
four months before the U.S. attack, and knew it to be 
controlled by French and Cambodian rubber interests. 
Many Europeans were working there, and some of them 
(e.g., a Belgian plant pathologist) were in complete 
sympathy with the American effort in South Vietnam. 
These Europeans were living with their wives and chil-
dren in an environment of complete tranquillity. We 
asked many of them whether they had seen any sign 
of North Vietnamese or Vietcong activity and they all 
answered no. 
My colleague A. H. Westing and I had visited the re-
gion to inspect the damage done by a clandestine defolia; 
tion' raid carried out in April-May of 1969 over almost 
200,000 acres of eastern ;Cambodia. ,ccording to a letter 
'received some months later from Sen. Frank Church, 
,the raid was carried out by Air America, a CIA airline, 
for what purposes we still do not know. After the raid, 
the Olhimetat regime aaked that AIMPietili ?MOMS Viat 
the region, with a view to making reparations for The 
aamag. Although the U.S. Government to this day offi-
52 
Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100020001-4 
tially denies having carried out this operation, it did send 
a team of experts, inchnling Charles Minarik Of the Chem-
ical Warfare Laboratories, U.S. Army, into the Mimot 
region-si'tortly after the raids. This team's report describes 
how they were flown over the region, driven Through it, 
and how they walked in it?just as Westing' and L did 
some months later. It is inconceivable- to me that the 
North: Vietnamese and Vietcong, who according to Isl,ixon 
controlled the area, would have permitted an official:ALS. 
Government team to wander through what Nixon celled 
"the headquarters for the entire Communist military op-
erations in South Vietnam." After the invasion began it 
was widely reported that no key control center cold 
be found. Some arms caches were reportedly uncovered 
and, of course, a great deal of rice. The rice did 'not 
greatly surprise me, since at the time we were there, the 
main occupation, in addition to tapping rubber, was har-
vesting rice. 
When speaking about the Cambodian "dammunist 
sanctuaries," Mr. Nixon failed to mention that, on orders 
of Prince Sihanouk, troops of the Royal Cambodian 
Army had in facto swept these areas about three months 
,before his invasion. The troops were led by Prince Sink 
Matak, a loyal American prot? and one of those later 
involved in Sihanouk's overthrow. Sihanouk ordered 
Matak to search out and destroy all Communist-Viet-
namese positions in Cambodia. Paul Bennett of the Cam-
bodian desk of the State Department informed me' in an 
interview, March 22, 1971: "A Cambodian Army opera-
tion began in January of 1970 in a northeastern province 
at approximately the time4when Sihanouk left for France 
and when Prince Sink Matak was Acting Prime Minister. 
They sent up a number of additional battalions among 
the better troops in the Cambodian' Army,' and carried 
out a series of small sweeps generally in this area. They 
did have, as I recall, a number of contacts with small 
V.C. and North Vietnamese units. They found and de-
stroyed a number of small supply dumps, a relatively 
small campsite, but there was no major contact with the 
main North Vietnamese forces." Where were the thou-
sands of North Vietnamese troops that Nixon said had 
occupied the area for five years? 
? , Besides bring. mistaken about the nature of the 
so-called Coinmunist sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia, 
Mr. Nixon grossly misrepresented the facts whew he 
stated that "American policy since 1954 has been to 
scrupulously respect the neutrality of Cambodia. . 
North Vietnam, however, has not respected that neutral-. 
ity." The defoliation'of vast sections of the rubber plan-
tations, mentioned above, was one blatant violation of 
Cambodia's neutrality, and there are many others. During' 
my first visit to Cambodia We inspected what was left of 
Dak Dam, a little town in the central highlands just across 
the border from the special forces camp at Bet Prang, 
South Vietnam. Six weeks before our visit this town, 
which was about a quaver mile from a Royal Camboe 
dian Army antiaircraft position, had been savagely at-
tacked by U.S. fighter bombers. The' antiaircraft positiona 
were destroyed, as well as a school, a hospital and' an 
ambulance. Twenty-five Cambodians were killed and spy-,

jeans to see for themselves what they had done in viola-
tion of the agreements signed to respect each other's 
neutrality. American and International Control Corn-. 
.mission officers visited the site and learned that all 
twenty-five killed had been Cambodians and that the 
attacks had damaged onlyiCambodian installations. West-
ing and I were able to verify these conclusions. 'The 
Americans did Mit ?contect ?the original Saiion?assess-
ment and the report on the 13ak Dam incident is. 
'classified. The State Department later apologized and 
paid $400 for each Cambodian killed. This brutal attack 
occurred because the Cambodians had dared to open 
fire on American aircraft that were cantinually violating 
the air space around Dak Dam. The Cambodians had 
hit one of the American .airplanes, as they had every 
right to do, and the Americans retaliated, falsely calling 
it an attack upon a North Vietnamese position. 
This sort of activity had been repeated many times 
over the years by the Americans and their South Viet-
namese allies. A? white .paper published by the Royal 
.Government pointed out that "all of the very serious in-
cidents of the past years' committed by the American-
South Vietnamese aggressive forces have been the sub-
ject of. detailed inquiry by the International Control 
commission. They underline, the fact that the victims of, 
these attacks have always been only Cambodians, almost' 
always peasants at work. . . . No Vietcong body has 
ever bccn recovered on the sites of these ground attacks 
nor in the frontier villages machine-gunned, or bombed 
by American aviation." 
In addition to Cambodians and the International Con'-' 
fro! Commission, former American officials have reported 
American violations of Cambodia's neutrality. For in-
Stance, a Captain Marasco stated on a 1970 NBC tele-
vision documentary program that he had frequently sent 
teams into Cambodia from a base near the Parrot's Beak. 
Marasco said, "I'm sure that the CIA *and the South 
Vietnamese counterpart of the CIA had intelligence agents 
inside Cambodia." When I 'asked Mr. Bennett of the 
State Department if operations of this sort did not violate 
the neutrality of Cambodia, he answered: "I have no 
comment on measures that we take to insure the safety 
of our troops by finding out what threats exist." The 
United States could, however, have called upon the In-
ternational Control Commission to determine what threats 
existed in Cambodia to its forces in Vietnam. 
? Nixon, when affirming U.S. respect 'for Cambo-
dian neutrality, failed to mention the part played by the 
United States and its Cambodian friends in. the.. Match 
18th coup against Sihanouk: The official U.S. line was 
that it was "very surprising" when Sihanouk was de-
Posed. I learned something about the coup when 1' 
.. ? 
-interviewed. the preschePremier of the "Republic of?Cam:.(! 
bedia," Son Ngoc Thanh, in August 1971 at his house 
in?Phnoin Penh. Me had been Prime Minister of Cam-
bodia once before?when .the Japanese occupied ? the 
country during World War IL) Thanh sees hitnself as 
a devoted. Cambodian freedom fighter who began his 
struggle against the French: That led him to collaborate 
with the Japanese, and he now collaborates with the 
Americans in an attempt to destroy the Cambodian mon-
archy and set up the so-called ,"Republic." Thanh organ-
ized a group of expatriate and ethnic Cambodians living 
in South Vietnam and Thailand into a movement called 
the Khmer. Semi.. This movement began, according to 
Thanh, .as part of' the struggle against the Frepeln, but 
?in..thi . late :1950s in Thailand and in South Vietnam 
these' groups began to receive American support. Again 
according to. Thanh, U.S. special forces began in 1958 
the military training of Cambodians living .in Vietnam 
53 
and these Cambodians, many of them recruited from the 
Khmer Serci, were organized by General Harkins in 
What . was called "Mike Force,", a highly trained mobile 
strike 'force. Thanh says his Khmer Serci received some' 
U.S. money and all of its weapons from the United 
States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1965 the 
Khmer Serei openly announced that it was carrying out 
a struggle against Sihanouk. Despite this, Sihanouk on 
January .5, 1969, granted an amnesty to all Khmer Serel. 
Shortly thereafter, Thanh told me, some 200 .Kltmer? 
Sere i soldiers crossed the border from Thailand and sup-
posedly surrendered to the Royal Army. qp June '12, 
1969, a second- contingent of several hundred soldiers 
also crossed into the northWestern pan of Cambodiaand 
were incorporated like their comrades into the Royal 
Army. One can. imagine that it was through the itifiltra-
tion of the Royal Army by these U.S.-trained Oambo-
dians that 'the CIA maintained contact with the 'forces 
involved in the coup. These men, .actually natives of 
'Thailand and South Vietnam, formed the chief line of 
defense for the Lon Nol regime in-the early days of the 
coup. ? 
President Nixon stated that one reason tor' the 
American invasion of Cambodia was that the North 
Vict-
namese had carried out a massive invasion after the over-
throw of Sihanouk. He did not mention that thousands. 
of ethnic Cambodians from South Vietnam, organized 
as "Mike Force," were flown into Phnom Penh within 
'days of the coup. It is important to realize 'that these 
men were actually Cambodian-Vietnamese,' just as for-
eign to Cambodia as the North Vietnamese. This is 
proved by the following situation about which I learned 
during my vist in August 1971. In the days immediately 
after the.coup these mercenaries were paid in Cambodian 
money, but their families and ancestral homes were in 
South Vietnam where the Cambodian money was worth-
less. U.S. Embassy officials in Phnoln Penh told me that 
this' caused considerable trouble. 
.It is obilrous. that the Americans had anticipated and 
prepared, for the overthrow of Sihanouk for years, and 
had developed a highly trained and mobile Cambodian 
military force in South Vietnam that they could use 
quickly to support the new regime?In the NBC program 
featuring Marasco, the captain was asked, "Do you 
think it is possible?that a man like Sihanouk could have 
,been deposed by his own generals just on their own, or 
have you ever thought there was some other thing in-
vowed in what happened to :Sihanouk?" Marasco: "I 
don't doubt that there was some other thing involved in 
his being deposed. I don't doubt ,that some other people 
have had something to do with it." NBC: "Like who?" 
Marasco: "Like other goyermnents, , other intelligence 
organizations." NBC: "American, South ,Vietnamese, 
both?" Marasco: "Both." In .my interview with him, Ben-
nett of the State Department said: "There were so-called, 
, Khmer Serci groups headed by Son Ngoc 'Minh in. boll.' 
Thailand and South Vietnam operating along the borders. 
There was a group of about 100 people captured in Bat-. 
tambang province just over the Thai border in Cambodia, 
about June or July of '1969 who were .allekedly .Khmer 
Semi and recruited, as far as I know, into: the Royal 
Army, conceivably even into the police*as well. . . The 
special forces have for years helped train, organize and 
lead irregular forces used, among others, in areas along 
,the Cambodian border. Many of the Cambodians re-
cruited for this may have.'had Khmer Semi affiliations." - 
On April 6, the,eltiladelphia Inquirer published an se-
count of an interview with Prime Minister Thanh,which 
confirmed what he had told nlc. the previou's year. M-
cording to the Inquirer, "Beginning in 1965 the U.S. 
paid millions of dollars to 'train, arm and support his

Large-scale Khmer Semi defections to the Cambodian

units were serving in the Royal Army under Lon Not and 
spearheaded political demonstrations' in Phnom Penh just 
before the coup. After checking , with his American 
friends, Thanh committed his U.S. trained and financed 
forces to the Lon Nol coup. The CIA, he said, had 
Promised that the U.S. would do everything possible to. 
help." . 
Nixon's assertion that the United States practiced 
complete respect for Cambodian neutrality does not ac-
cord with the facts. And these inaccurate interpretations. 
of U.S.-Cambodian relations led to incorrect predictions 
of what would happen after the coup and the American 
invasion. Three major factors upset the Administration's 
game plan for Cambodia. These were described to me at 
.length in a June 1970 interview in Hanoi with Xeng An, 
the Ambassador from Sihanouk's Royal Government of 
National Union, -which now controls most of Cambodian 
territory. Mr. An pointed out that the peasants had hate 
a g'rent loyalty .and respect for Sihanouk because he had 
kept war from their lives, They had known perfectly well 
what the war was doing to the people across the border 
in Vietnam. Secondly,' the Americans guessed wrong on 
Sihanouk's behavior. They had expected him to retire to 
France, as did the Emperor Bao .pai, the last Royal 
Vietnaniese ruler.'. Instead, the Prince joined his, former

negotiator said. "We have undertaken, and I repeat it

to.remain at that meeting for as long as is necessary to 
complete the agreement." This undertaking to the people 
of the United States and of Vietnam has now been 
broken. Perhaps the reasons are technical, but there are 
ominous signs that more profound coniiderations may be 
promoting ruinous second thoughts. 
? White House spokesmen now stress the quest for "a 
settlement that will last, not just for the short term but 
for the long term." This smacks dangerously of the 
inflated\ war aims that kept the Johnson and Nixon 
Administrations fighting so intensely in Vietnam long 
after knowledgeable strategists had concluded these 
alms were unattainable. 
Far from envisaging a disengagement of American 
personnel from Vietnam, the Administration is revealed 
to have embarked on a secret build-up or "civilian" per-
sonnel under Defense Department contract to "advise" 
the South Vietnamese military establishment. And four , 
weeks after the White House declared that "peace is at 
hand," the United States carried out two days of what 
was officially described as the heaviest B-52 bombard-
P77-00432R000100020001-4 
.enemies?the Indochinese Marxists?and set up the 
United National Front of Cambodia and the Royal Gov-1 
ernment of. National Union which he now heads. Thus;L: 
American actions forced a devout Buddhist and 
Communist .ruler, Sihanouk, into the hands of Nixon's I. 
Indochinese enemies; and the Prince brought with ihim 
thesupport of the vast majority of Cambodian peasants.' . 
If the. ,Nixon :Administration had left Sihanouk' Cam- : 
bodirf alone' II believe it would have been difficult, if .not 
impossible, for the revolutionary forces of Indochina to. 
launch the massive offensive with tanks that erupted from: 
the so-called sanctuaries that- Nixon had sworn t&cleara 
out. ' ? , . ? ; 
The. third factor that the Americans failed to predict 
correctly was the effect of inciting anti-Vietnamesil feel.: 
ings among Cambodians. Xeng Ani during his interview, 
discussed this point at some length, saying that it 'poses' 
irreconcilable contradictions for the American policy in 
Cambodia. He stressed that, in order to arouse the Cam-
bodians against the so-called Vietcong and North Viet-
namese, the U.S.-supported Lon Nol clique had needed . 
to arouse them against Vietnamese in general. To' expect 
then that they would welcome the Saigon Vietnamese as 
liberator's from the Communist Vietnamese 46's quite is--
rational, as events of recent months have shown. Pitched 
battles have been, fought between Cambodian .troops and 
their so-called South Vietnamese-Saigon allies. And, the 
relationship between the Saigon regime and the Phnom 
Penh regime grows increasingly strained. 
All of this must now be known to. the Nixon Adnaln-
lstration, and that, probably, is why we hear so little to?
day.about?Cambodia. ' ""? ? 
ment of North Vietnam of the whole war. 
Pressing the advantage which he has apparently 
gained in the past month of jockeying, President Thieu 
has sent a special envoy to meet Mr. Nixon this week, 
after which he is to accompany Dr. Kissinger to the 
renewed dialogue with Hanoi's Le Due Tho next week. 
Among the "clarifications" the United States0 is re-
portedly seeking from North Vietnam is a specific pledge 
to withdraw some of its troops from the South after the 
cease-fire, thus soothing one of President Thieu's deepest 
fears. From the start, Dr. Xissinger's critics and sup-
porters alike spotted the absence of any visible con-
cession by Hanoi on this point as a critical element in 
the give-and-take that had gone into the basic accord; 
if it is being injected as a new element at this stage, 
what is left of the whole tissue of understanding? 
' It seems impossible to doubt, from the statements of 
both sides, that Dr. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho reached' 
,a handshake agreement a month ago to end ten years of 
war in Vietnam; the White House disclosed this tentative 
? accord just before the American Presidential election. 
As every collective bargainer knows, the whole concept 
of negotiation is built on mutual respect for the integrity 
of such agreements, whatever minor difficulties may ' 
attend their translation into formal contract language. 
If a veto by President Thieu is leading to United States 
insistence on renegotiation of one or more of the most 
fundamental clauses in the agreement, the promised light 
at the end of the tunnel may once again be receding 
Into dim shadow.

Washincton Post Foreign Service 
SEOUL?Two decades af-
ter American troops fought 
and died to save it from 
Communist el orninatio n, 
South Korea has taken a 
sharp turn toward one-man 
rule and an authoritarian. 
political System. . 
Presient Park Chung 
Hee's decision, formally vali-
dated this Tuesday by 91.5. 
per cent of the votes cast in 
an elaborately organized 
and orchestrated national 
referendum, was motivated 
by a large number of ele-
ments aside from Park's de-
sire to stay in power. 
The decline of American 
involvement in Asia, the 
high-level negotiations be-
tween North Korea and 
South Korea, declining pa-
tience with the political op-
position and the National 
Assembly, an economid scare 
due to a recent recession 
and his own spartan view of 
what South Korea should be 
like?these factors all ' ap-
pear to have had a part in 
Park's decision to take the 
political system into his own 
hands through martial law 
and push through funda-
mental constitutional_ 
changes. ? 
Pax* calls the new system 
"Korean democracy." But 
just as GI's of 1950-53 would 
hardly recognize today's Ko-
rea as the threadbare and 
woebegone country they 
knew in those days, they 
would probably blink and 
scratch their heads at the 
political setup being labeled 
"democracy." 
As sketched out in pro-
nouncement and propoaal, 
the new order is a split-level 
affair. Foreign businessmen 
and tourists, whose invest-
ment-a' and purchases are es-
sential to the swiftly devel-
oping economy, are prom-
ised unimpaired and even 
enhanced freedoms. 
As one of the innumerable 
handouts for foreigners, 
printed in English and Japa-
nese, put it this week: "Dear 
visitors: Please feel free 
wherever you travel in the 
? country under martial law. 
The warmer welcome and 
the better service await 
(sic)."- -------
South Korea is, and prob-
ably will continue to be, 
heavily dependent for its 
prosperity and growth on in-
teraction with the world . 
outside. ? 
At the atm(' time, the the, 
oretical and constitutional, 
underpinning of the pre-
vious system of limited dem-
ocratic government has been 
abandoned. Park can be 
elected forever by an easily-
r., 
ham 
itagen d..L.ark's 
llie in 09-alth 
controlled 'National Reuni-
fication Council" of more 
more than 2,000 supposedly 
non-political persons. More-
over, he can appoint one-
third of the National Assem-
bly and name a supreme 
court to decide the most im-
portant cases brought be-
fore the judiciary. . ? - 
'Efficient Rule' 
In the opinion of knowl-
edgeable sources, Park has 
been actively considering 
the scrapping of the old con-
stitution and the creation of 
a stronger and more "efffi-
cient" rule since at least the 
midde of last year, shortly 
after his inauguration for a 
third term in office. Quiet 
study missions are said to 
have been dispatched to Tai-
wan, Indonesia, Thailand, 
Cambodia, South Vietnam 
and the Philippines to look 
over their constitutions and 
political systems. 
Park's decision to move 
on Oct. 17?instead of in Do-
cember as the U.S. embassy 
had expected?was evi-
dently precipitated by two 
major events: the draft of 
a Washington-Hanoi peace 
agreement and North Ko-
rea's anger at South Korean 
criticism of the high-level 
talks on reunification be-
tween the two governments. 
- On Oct. 8, North Vietnam 
presented a drastically altered 
peace proposal to presiden-
tial assistant Henry Kissin-
ger in Paris, and by Oct. 12 
the substance of a Vietnam 
peace agreement had been 
virtually agreed to. It is 
quite likely that South Ko-
rea, with some 40,000 troops 
still on duty in Vietnam 
learned of the developments 
Within a day or two. 
The implications for Seoul 
would have been two-fold: 
first, that the US. troop 
withdrawal from Indochina 
? and ultimately from Ko-
rea as well ? would come 
even earlier than 
inticipated; second, that 
U.S. policymakers and the 
American public would be 
much too consumed with the 
Vietnam peace issue ? in 
addition to the presidential 
. elections ? to pay much at-
tentien to goings-on in Ko-
rea. 
The second important 
event took place on Oct. 12 
at the truce village at Pan-
munjom, whera south KO= 
roan CIA Chief Lee HuRak 
met North Korean Deputy. 
Premier Park Sung-Chul for 
the first high-level North-
South talks since the dia-
logue between the two Ko-
55 
rean governments was made 
public July 4. 
Acrimonious Meeting 
According to a source who 
has seen the still-secret tran-
script of the session, it was 
a vely acrimonious meeting 
"a very, heated argument 
went on for just about the 
entire session," the source 
said. . 
The North accused the 
South of fomenting anti-
Communist propaganda in 
the South Korean press, and 
the South accused the North 
of antiPark broadcasts and 
editorials in official organs. 
Ironically, in view of later 
event, CIA Chief Lee con-* 
tended that the government 
in the South had no authority 
to tell the press what to re-
port under a limited consti-
tutional system. North Ko-
rea wasn't buying this. 
There is no indication, ac-
cording to the same source, 
that the South Korean side 
informed the North Korean 
side at the Oct. 12 meeting 
that martial law and a politi-
cal change were close at 
hand. While the implications 
of this meeting are still un-
clear, the conclusion in 
some sophisticated circles is 
that Park and his aides real-
ized future progress in the 
North-South talks probably 
would be slow indeed, and-
that the talks might even 
break down. 
The governments main 
selling point for the new 
"Korean democracy" has 
been the need for strength 
to compete with the North 
during the quest of unifica-
tion. Should the North-South 
dialogue lose its lustre, the 
new martial law regime 
would be harder to justify 
to the people in the South 
and to the world. * - 
Once Park and his small 
inner circle of advisers had 
made the decision to move 
quickly, the organs of gov-
ernment planning went into 
high gear. Military plans for 
martial law were dusted off 
and changed to fit the occa-
sion. The working draft of 
the proposed new constitu-
tion was quickly reviewed 
and prepared for publica-
tion. Even Park's address to 
the nation announcing mar-
tial law, the suspension of 
the old constitution and the 
other sweeping measures 
was pro-recorded on tape. 
Elaborate Scenario 
Ati elaberate scenario o_f 
who was to be told what and 
when was drawn up and put 
Into effect. U.S. Ambassador 
Philip Habib was called in 
25 hours in advance to get 
the word. At the same time, 
? . the Chairman of the joint 
, chiefs of staff gave the word 
tto the U.S. military com-
mander in Korea, Gen. Don-
aid Bennett.- . 
The -move from an Ameri-
can:oriented constitutional 
democracy (at least in 
theory) to an autocracy with 
democratic trappings was to 
take place in stages betwee+ 
mictOctober and the end of 
the year. The critical period 
would be between the Oct. 
17 announcement and the 
Nov. 21 referendum to ap-
prove the constitution, and 
every precaution was taken 
to insure a good result. 
All political activity was 
theoretically banned under ? 
? the martial law decree, and 
? for the opposition this meas-
. ure was strictly enforced. ' 
? Ordinary citizens were tried 
and convicted at publicized 
courts.:martial for spreading 
"rumors" against what the 
government designated the 
"0 ct ober Revitalization"

were imprinted with the slo?-?

? Under ? these ' circum-
stances, the question -was 
not whether the referendum 
would pass, but how big a

NEW YORK TIMES 
28 November 1972 
as Peace 
. At Hand? 
By Torn Wicker 
No matter what happens after the 
Indochinese peace ? talks resume on 
Dec. 4, it now seems reasonably clear 
that Dr. Henry Kissinger had little 
basis for his statement on Oct. 26, 
twelve days before the election, that 
"peace Is at hand," subject only to a 
few minor details of negotiation. lie 
had, it is clear, no real agreement with 
Hanoi and Saigon on encling the war; 
no such agreement seems to exist a 
month later; and it is highly question-
able whether either Dr. Kissinger or 
President Nixon could have believed 
on Oct. 26 that they actually had 
reached an agreement that would 
bring what Mr. Nixon called that night 
In Ashland, Ky., "peace with honor 
and not peace with surrender." 
Quite obviously, there can be no 
cease-fire in South Vietnam until the 
Saigon Government agrees to a cease-
fire, for the simple reason that that 
Government has in its army a million 
men, armed to the teeth by the United 
States. In the final analysis, the only 
way Washington can impose a cease-
fire on that Government and that 
army is by threatening to cut off their 
military supplies. 
Is that a serious proposition? After 
having for four years maintained the 
war, at a cost of 20,000 American 
deaths, billions of American dollars, 
and incalculable Indochinese casual-
ties, all for the stated purpose of giv-
ing the Saigon regime a "chance" to., 
survive, is it really conceivable that 
Mr. Nixon is now prepared to ask 
Congress to shut off military support 
to that regime--thus throwing an 
"ally" to the Communists, even though 
Mr. Nixon has said repeatedly that it 
he did that, a gigantic bloodbath 
would ensue and world peace would 
be threatened? 
Yet, as recently as this weekend, 
President 'Flu's controlled new. 
? paper, Tin Song, said in Saigon that 
before there can be a cease-fire, North 
? Vietnam must withdraw its troops 
from South Vietnam, the demilitarized 
zone?in effect, a national border?
JAPAN TIMES

Vietnam Under Coaition Gov' 
By ROBERT S. ELEGANT 
Los Angeles Times 
SAIGON? The war in Viet-
nam will end shortly. but the 
struggle will continue ? the 
struggle to unite all Vietnam 
under a totalitarian regime. 
The struggle the Communists 
have waged for 27 years. 
Hanoi has just reaffirmed its 
determination to fight in its 
comments on the secret talks 
that led to the North Vietnam-
.ese-American draft. agreement. 
The Communists have in-
variably used "united front" or 
,"coalition" governments as the 
first, decisive step toward seiz-
ing all power. No less an an-
thority on revolutionary strate-
gy than Chairman Mao Tse-tung 
of the Communist Party of 
China laid down the tactics in 
one of his most widely read 
? works. "On Coalition Govern-
ment." 
The United States is with-
drawing from direct in-
volvement in Vietnam. The de-
cision is wise from the Ameri-
can point,of view ? and prob-
ably unavoidable. 
If America has not attained 
-every last one of its national 
objectives, it has equally not 
acceded to ?Hanoi's long-stand-
ing demand that America make 
itself responsible for delivering, 
South Vietnam to harsh, author-
itarian rule. But America would 
be unwise if it deluded itself 
that the draft agreement ac-
complishes more than ending 
American intervention with 
relative grace, while starting a 
new phase in the unrelenting 
military and political battle for 
control of the South's 17,500,000 
people. 
Hanoi declared recently its 
intention of "accelerating the 
struggle on the military, politi- and language 27 years ago. 
cal, and diplomatic fronts until 
the lofty objectives ? liberating 
the South, protecting and build-
ing the socialist North, and ad-
vancing toward peacefully unit-
ing the country ? are 
achieved." 
In Hanoi's lexicon, liberation 
means imposing its own rule, 
af ter destroying "decadent, 
bourgeois democracy." Clearly, 
the objective has not changed, 
only the means. 
Hanoi no longer demands 
that, as President Nixon put it, 
"we withdraw and destroy the 
Government of the Republic of 
Vietnam as we go." 
A "coalition government," ex-
cluding the present Saigon re-
gime, will not be created simul-
taneously with the ceasefire. In-
stead, Saigon will rule its areas 
and the Viet Cong theirs, while 
a 'council on national reconcilia-
tion and accord plans elections 
to choose a new government. 
The tripartite council will rep-
resent Saigon. the Viet Cong, 
and the amorphous "neutralist" 
faction. 
The term, "coalition govern-
ment," anathema to Saigon, did 
not appear. Nonetheless, Mab's 
"On Coalition Government," a 
report to the seventh congress 
of the Communist Party in 
April 1945, is the surest guide to 
Hanoi's strategy and objectives. 
Despite differences between Pe-
king and Hanoi. Mao's revolu-
tionary manuals are read avid-
ly in North Vietnam. 
The political conditions Hanoi 
faces in 1972 closely resemble 
the conditions Mao faced in 
1945. Besides, the negotiating 
tactics and even the language 
Hanoi now employs are almost 
identical with Chinese tactics 
As the war in the Pacific was 
ending, Mao faced the chal-
lenge of winning political victo-
ry in China. The Nationalist 
Government ruled much larger 
territories and commanded 
much more powerful armies 
than did the Communists. Mao's 
solution was a coalition govern-
merit?which
-
menl?which would shOtly be-
come a Communist government. 
As the the big war in Viet.: 
nam draws to a close. Hanoi 
must win political victory over 
a regime that controls 90 per 
cent of the population and de-
ploys troops outnumbering the 
Communists several times. The 
North Vietnamese have chosen 
the same solution. 
In-1945, Mao made almost the' 
same proposal Hanoi has? now 
advanced. The Nationalist Gov-
erntnent was to join a tripart-
ite, united-front alliance that 
would prepare for a 'coalition 
government. 
But Mao told the secret party. 
session: "The politics of new 
democracy . . . consists in Over-
throwing external oppression 
and internal feudal, fascist 
oppression and then set= 
ting up not he old democracy 
but a political system which is 
a united front of all demo- ? 
cratic classes, . . . This is-
our minimum program, against 
our future or maximum ?pro-
gram of socialism and commu- , 
nism . . . (every Communist i 
will fight for two clearly de-
fined objectives) the new de,m0-1 
mettle revolution now and So-
cialism and communism In 'the' 
future. . . ." 
Mao's proposal was not., ac-, 
cepted. Instead, he fought al-
most five years longer to win 
military victory. 
must be re-established at the 17th 
parallel, and the role of the National 
Council of Reconciliation and Concord 
?envisioned in the Kissinger-Le Due 
Tho draft accord?must be more 
clearly defined. These are merely the 
central issues of the war; if they have 
to be settled before Saigon agrees to 
a cease-fire, then it follows that on 
Oct. 26 the Nixon Administration did 
not really have an agreement for a 
cease-fire that depended only on the 
? working out of a few details. 
As another example, Dr. Kissinger 
said that the release of American 
prisoners of war by Hanoi was not 
dependent on the release of political 
prisoners by Saigon. This seemed to be 
confirmed in a statement by Xuan 
Thity, a principal North Vietnamese 
?negotiator. Yet, since then, the North 
ilaWspaper, 
Nhan Dan, has asserted just the oppo. 
site view, and the North Vietnamese 
summary of the draft accord (with 
which Dr. Kissinger said he had "no ernment sources insist that Dr. Kissin-
complaint") declared that "the return gera failure to secure an agreement 
of all captured and detained personnel for North Vietnamese withdrawal 
of the parties shall be carried out 
simultaneously with the U.S. troops' 
withdrawal." 
Since many political prisoners held 
by Saigon would be an important part 
of the so-called "third force" supposed' 
to be included in the National Council 
. of Reconciliation and Concord, is it 
realistic to suppose that Hanoi agreed 
to leave them to the mercy of Saigon? 
In any case, it is a legitimate question 
whether Dr. Kissinger was entitled to 
speak as specifically on the matter as 
he did on Oct. 26. 
By far the major question concerns 
the status of North Vietnamese forces 
In South Vietnam. The summary of the 
draft accord with which Dr. Kissinger 
had "no complaint" on Oct. 26 does 
not mention a withdrawal of North 
Vietnamese forces; evety commentator 
pointed raft that Oita WAS. 4 Miller

arrangement; and some informed Gov-

caused Washington?not just Saigon?
to pull back from accepting his draft 
accord with Lo Duc Tho. To have 
accepted that draft, they say, would 
have given Hanoi what it had sought 
all along?an American withdrawal 
from the battlefield, while Hanoi was 
left free to settle Indochinese military 
and political affairs in direct and un-
impeded struggle with Saigon. 
Now it is being asserted in Washing-
ton, through studied leaks and calcu-
lated statements, that the American 
side is pressing for further concessions 
only in order to be able to tell Saigon, 
honestly that further concessions can-
not be had; even if that were .true, 
however, it still implies that on Oct. 26 
there was no real basis for asserting 
that only a few unimportant details 
stood in the way of a peace which 
was "at hand." ? 
On that date, Dr. Kissinger?who 
was just back from Saigon?must have 
known that President Thieu did not 
accept the most important parts of the 
draft accord; he could hardly have 
been justified in asserting, therefore, 
that only a few minor details remained 
to be worked out with Hanoi; and if it 
finally turns out that the central issue 
of the renewed negotiations is the 
withdrawal of North Vietnamese 
forces, the real question' will be 
whether President Nixon himself ever 
accepted the Kissinger-Le Due Tho 
draft accord, which was supposed to 
havOatasot tilmt peace was at hand.

ity not only to undo colonialism but also to 
. build democratic societies. And, at the same 
time, our ability to influence events also de-
clined. 
Thus, when Marcos moved in Manila, we 
restricted ourselves to an official statement' 
which amounted to "no comment." When 
:Park acted in Korea, we "disassociated" 'our-
selves from his action. 
But what could we have-done? 
' Intervention in the internal- affairs of

a bad name in recent years in the U.S. Al-
though there arc still sortie people who ad-

? such countries as Korea,/ our track record 
has been spotty at best and includes the old 
intervention that makes new intervention 
almost impossible. Our competence at that 
. sort of thing is not proven; on the contrary.. 
FURTHERMORE, the potential American 
influence (which was never as large as 
Asians, who saw the CIA in every rumor and

For many. years, it was a standard liberal

'TIM KREMLIN is trying 
to find out what truth there 
is in the Washington stories 
. of a falling-out between 
President Nixon and Dr. 
Kissinger over the Vietnam 
peace settlement. Soviet 
agents in Washington have 
been making discreet inqui-
ries about the. report, which 
first appeared in an ultra-
conservative Washington 
weekly, Human Events, and 
was then briefly reproduced 
in The Washington Post. 
Human Events said that 
Kissinger had tried "to 
foist" the Paris agreement 
on Mr. Nixon. There fol. 
lowed "a bitter dispute" 
among top officials and sec-
ond thoughts "even in the ' 
White House," about the 
agreement Kissinger had ne-
gotiated, the paper said. The 
Washington Post, however, 
reported that White House 
officials had scoffed at such 
rumors. 
Faced with a White House 
mystery, Soviet analysts 
would attempt the kind of 
exercise that the CTA makes 
to find out what goes on' in 
the Kremlin. Only Soviet of-
ficials call it Washingtonol-
ogy, not Kremlinology. 
KISSINGER' 14AD SAID 
that only "minor" issues re-
. mined to be resolved. But 
Mr. Nixon spoke later of 
"central" issues. Kissinger 
had said that only one more 
negotiating session would 
suffice. But the White 
House spokesman later 
spoke of several. Was there 
a genuine disagreement in 
the White House, the Krem-
lin would ask, or had Mr. 
Nixon simply changed his 
mind? 
Washingtonology, when 
practiced from a Spviet van-
tage point, has ohe advan-
tage. It is not limited to 
Washington information, 
but ean be supplemented 
with insights from the other 
side of the fence. Why, for. 
instance, did Hanoi press 
for an immediate cease-fire 
some time before the 
election? "You'll have to ask 
, Hanoi," said Kissinger. 
The answer is not simply 
that Hanoi thought it could 
get better terms before the 
election than after. Once 
? Hanoi had. decided, by late 
summer, to accept Mr. Nix-
011'q major demands, it con-
centrated its efforts on the 
next most important negoti-
ating objective; to prevent 
the rearming of the South , 
Vietnamese forces to the 
point where they could 'he414 
come a threat to the regime ; 
in the North. ' 
Mr., Nixon called it "Viet-:'i 
namization," but a SaigOrC 
army made strong enough to,'! 
defeat the Communists hi.' 
,the South might also, Hanoi 
would have reason to fear, 
? be capable of marching .on. 
the North. Mr. Nixon kept 
telling Hanoi that it must'' 
choose between "Vietnam', 
zation," thus subtly rede-
fined, and a "negotiated set-
tlement," also redefined- to'' 
include major Communisti 
concessions. 
MOSCOW AND PEKING' 
got the message, and kept.! 
urging it on a reluctant' 
Hanoi. After the election,, 
.they would have argued,., 
even this choice might dis-' 
appear, because Mr. Nixon 
would no longer be under 
.pressure to seek a settle;, 
ment. Hanoi accepted. the " 
bargain. The Paris agree:.-
ment stipulated that the 
flow of American arms Was, 
to end on November 1 , 
and, with it, the threat of 
Vietnamization. " 
So the reason why liana 
had been pressing for an iti. 
mediate cease-fire, even be-
fore the election, was to 
avert a massive last-minute 
surge in the flow of arms 
which would nullify its con!, 
cessions. When Mr. Nixon 
rejected the Paris draft, and' 
used the time thus gained to 
do the very thing which.. 
Hanoi had paid so dearly to : 
avert, the Communist 
claimed that they had been 
cheated out of the bargain, , 
they made in good faith. ' 
' The reason why Moscow 
wants to know whether Kis-
singer intended this all 
along, or was overruled by 
Mr. Nixon, or whether, per-
haps, it was a last-minute 
twist forced on the White ? 
House by a genuine change , 
in circumstances, far tran-
scends in importance the im-
mediate issue of peace in 
Vietnam, important as that 
is. 
What Moscow' is askingis . 
whether it can trust Mr. 
Nixon in the "era a negotia-
tions," arid whether it can 
really march arm-in-arm. , 
with him toward the "goner-
at poem" The White 
House cannot afford to 
leave the Kremlin with the 
wrong inlpression.

PEKING?After protesting 
to university authorities, stu-
dents at Shanghai University 
Teachers' College have ob-
tained the right to read for-
eign books, including Euro-
pean and American literature 
of the 18th and 19th centuries, 
the People's Daily reported. 
The newspaper said that 
Profesiors of the Chinese de-
partment of the college had re-
quested 18th and 19th century 
European and American nov-
els for the college library, and 
this request prompted "serious 
discussions" in the university. 
After the discussions among 
atudents and professors, how-
ever, the People's Daily said 
the conclusion was reached 
that "It is acceptable that 
readers should read certain 
Ideas that are erroneous or 
contain poison seeds." ? 
Observers in Peking said 
this thirst for reading among 
Chinese students seemed to 
mark an important new stage 
in university life after the 
Cultural Revolution.- T h e y. 
added that, during the last 
two years, university libraries 
had seemed to concentrate oh 
lending political and technical 
books, and that access to. clas-
sical or foreign literal ere had 
aeemed to be more limited.. 
During the past year, how-
ever, foreign classics have 
been reappearing on library 
shelves. This was seen as part 
of a general trend toward 
more cultural freedom, and 
the fact that the right to read 
such books was reaffirmed in 
the People's Daily gives it an 
official sanction. . 
The report in the People's 
Daily on the discussions was, 
carried on a page devoted to 
university problems. "Certain 
icomrades suggested that the 
books should be acquired; oth-
ers resolutely opposed thila 
arguing that the reappearance 
of those books would be a sign', 
of restoration," the newspaper 
said. 
"Restoration" appeared to 
refer to the previous policy of 
allowing students access to 
Western literature, a policy, 
dramatically changed by the 
purge of Western books and,
Ideas during the Cultural Rev-
- -olution. - . - ? 
It said that "leadeV com-
rades were very worried" by 
the fact that new stu4nts?
young workers,' peasarks and 
soldiers enrolled in the univer-
sity through reforms applied 
after the Cultural Revolution 
?"were formulating new read-
ership requests at the library.". 
It described the library offi-
cials as "indecisive," and said 
some "even tried to hide the, 
books." 
Protesting students said 
that "the activities of the li-
brary must be, actively placed 
In the service of the prole-
tarian revolution in teaching 
Not to open books, or to run 
away from contradictions, is 
the same thing as refusing to, 
eat for fear of choking," thd 
newspaper said. 
"University and library Inv 
thorities were profoundly std.! 
prised by the students' eriti: 
eism," the paper said. 
They cautioned that "On the 
one band, we must trust most 
of the worker, peasant and sol-
dier students?they are capa-
ble of judging for themselves; 
But at the same time,'we must 
understand that they are still 
young and some of them are 
In danger -of being influenced 
or corrupted by poison seeds." 
The reforms adopted at the 
university were aimed, the 
newspaper said, at guiding stu-
dents' reading and makin 
those who borrowed books 
"unsystematically" realize that 
"reading books is not a ? form 
of mental recreation." Stu-
dents are also encouraged to' 
write commentaries on what 
they read, the paper said. , 
The University library con-
tains more than 400,000 vol-
umes, and the average dailY, 
borrowing rate is 500 books, 
according to the People's 
Daily report. On some days as 
many as 1,500 books will be' 
borrowed. The newspaper de-
scribed these figures as higher 
than before the Cultural Revo-
lution.

The Nixon Thaivi U.S. Reif-dims with E stern Europe: 
By JOSEPH R. L. STERNE 
Under the protective cover of 
American-Soviet detente, relations 
between the United States and 
'Eastern Europe are relaxing and 
improving. 
This is a delicate diplomatic busi-
ness, given the Kremlin's hyper-
sensitivity about political develop-
ments within the Warsaw Pact 
area: On all too many occasions, 
the world has seen how the Rus-
sians react if they feel their hege-
mony is threatened in the satellite 
states on their western border. 
Therefore, the fact that Ameri-
can tics with Poland, Hungary, 
,Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria. and even 
East Germany are on the upgrade, 
right across the board, must be 
rated one of the quieter achieve-
ments of President Nixon's foreign 
policy. 
0 0 
To create the right atmosphere 
for this relaxation required more 
than a one-shot journey to Moscow 
and a series of American-Soviet 
?accords that gave Eastern Euro-
pean regimes added room for man-
euver. The Russians first had to be 
convinced how much Mr. Nixon's 
approach to East-West affairs had 
evolved since the rollback, libera-
tion posturing of the early Dulles 
years. 
In successive State-of-the-World 
messages and no doubt in private 
communications, the President sig-
naled the Kremlin that he was will-
ing to accept the status quo in 
divided Europe. This did not mean 
he Would condone the Warsaw Pact 
invasion of Czechoslovakia, an 
event that chilled East-West rela-
tions five months before he, took ? 
office. Nor did it imply he would 
cold-shoulder Romania's attempts 
to improve its links with the West 
????? 
much faster than the Kremlin de-
sired. 
But it did show that Mr. Nixon, 
like Chancellor Willy Brandt in 
Bonn, had come to accept the par-
adox that the Iron Curtain could 
become more permeable only 
through acknowledgment of Soviet 
dominance to the east of it. 
In this context, it is interesting 
to note how the President dealt with 
Eastern European .affairs in his 
1971 and 1972 foreign policy reports. 
"While the countries of (Eastern 
Europe) are in close proximity to 
the USSR, they also have historic 
ties to Western Europe and the 
United States," he said in the first 
of these messages. "We will not 
exploit these ties to undermine the 
security of the Soviet Union. We 
would not pretend that the facts 
of history and geography do not 
create siecial circumstances In - 
Eastern Europe. We recognize a 
divergence in social, political and 
economic systems between East 
and West." 
0 0 0. 
It is difficult to imagine a state-
ment that could have been more 
reassuring to the Russians. It came 
at a time when the Russians were 
stalling on the Berlin accord, the 
ice-breaking document in East-
West relations that had been signed 
one year later when Mr. Nixon 
gave his 1972 foreign policy assess-
ment. As a result, the President 
evidently felt lie could direct his 
calls for accommodation more 
pointedly toward the Eastern Euro-
pean capitals. 
Listen to these remarks in his 
message of last February: "We do 
not want to complicate the difficul-
ties of East European nations' re-
lations with their allies; neverthe-
less, there are ample opportunities 
for economic, technical and cultural 
cooperation on the basis of recipro-
city. The Eastern European coun-
tries themselves can determine the 
pace and scope of their developing 
relations with the United States." 
In May, only three months after 
those words were uttered, Mr. Nix-
on made the first presidential visit 
in history to Poland as he headed 
home from the Moscow summit. 
0 ? 
His appearance coincided with 
the signing of a consular agreement 
that the U.S. had sought for 10 
years as a protection for American 
citizens. While no specific trade 
deals were completed, a bilateral 
commission was set up and nego-
tiations were launched that could,, 
in time, bring Poland the U.S. cred-
its, trade and technology it so eag-
erly desires. The Warsaw regime 
has made a good-faith gesture by 
opening talks on the partial repay-
ment of bonds sold by the non-
communist government In pre-war 
Poland to hundreds of Americans 
of Polish origin. 
The Nixon trip to Warsaw was 
followed by Secretary of State Rog-
ers'? July journey to Hungary, 
where relations have been grim 
since the 1956 uprising, and by Mr. 
Ftsogers' conversations last month 
with the foreign ministers of Czech-
oslovakia and Bulgaria. 
The U.S. made headway with all 
three governments in its quest for ? 
consular treaties and, in return, 
opened trade talks that could lead 
eventually to the granting of 
most - favored - nation commercial 
arrangements?a top-priority mat-
ter for these economically deficit 
nations. 
Hungary. responded to Washing-
59 
ton's efforts by agreein 'to nego-
tiate on a settlement orAmerican 
war-damage and nationalization 
claims. Bulgaria, a nation long ' 
content to stay deep in, the Soviet 
shadow, agreed to send a deputy 
prime minister to the U.S: next , 
year. Washington is waithing for 
a less repressive political mood in, 1 
Prague. 
American relations With 'East 
Germany will have to remain in 
official abeyance until Bonn nor-
malizes its relations with East Ber-
lin and the two Germanys. enter 
the United Nations. However.,It Is 
now only a matter of time ,before 
the United States and East, Ger-
many recognize one another and 
begin the process of developing po-
litical, cultural and trade arrange i. 
-
ments. In the meantime,, both 
countries are exchanging visitors 
at a cautiously faster pace. 
? ? ? 
While American-Soviet detente N 
the major factor in Mr. Nixon's 
policies toward Warsaw Pact na-
tions, there are other influences as 
well. 
One Is the approach of 'a Con: 
ference on European Security and 
Cooperation where the West will 
try to encourage independent Im-
pulses on the part of Eastern Euro-
pean nations. Another is the con-
cern Washington shares with Soviet 
bloc nations about restrictive trade - 
policies of the Common ;Market. , 
Finally, there has been a change; 
a two-way change, in the feelings 
between the Communist reghties of 
Eastern Europe and 'millions of 
Americans of Eastern European 
ethnic origin. While ideological hos-
tility remains, it is gradually being 
overtaken by a resurgence of na-
tional sentiment that cannot fail 
but make ,reconciliation

Bal rice of 
Wi arut 
I 
? By .Anthony Lewis 
' LONDON, Nov. 17 ? The Russian 
State Choir performed the other night 
hi the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. 
On the pavement outside there was a 
counter performance: Victor YOran, a 
Soviet Jew in exile, played works for 
unaccompanied cello by Bach and Ravel. 
Mr. Yoran was protesting the 
refusal of Soviet authorities over the 
last three years to let his wife, his 
son and his mother join him in Israel. 
.Others with him carried signs cori-
.demning the treatment of Jews in the 
.U.S.S.R., for example the dismissal of 
.24 Jewish musicians from the Moscow 
-Radio Orchestra after one sought a 
permit to leave for Israel. 
The incident evoked a disparate 
-memory. One of the most bizarre 
moments in the 1972 Republican con- _ 
,vention came during a film on the ; 
accomplishments of President Nixon.. 
When he was shown with Leonid 
trezhnev of the U.S.S.R., the hall 
in Miami burst into the loudest 
'applause of the evening. 
The applause was doubtless for the 
.idea of d?nte rather than the person 
Df Brezhnev. Still, it was remarkable 
.to see thousands of Republicans 
applauding at the burly image of the 
Soviet Communist party leader, the 
imposer of a head tax on Jewish emi-
grants, the author of the formal doc-
trine that the Soviet Union may sup-

press freedom in any Socialist country. 
The delegates' enthusiasm for 
friendship with the most powerful 
Communist countries contrasted with 
_their equally strong support for con-
tinued American air and naval assault 
on one of the smallest, North Vietnam. ' 
Then Mr. Nixon, in his acceptance ? 
speech, made a tender reference to 
little Tanya of Leningrad, whose fam-
ily died during the German blockade; 
he said nothing about the hundreds of 
thousands of Vietnamese Tanyas and 
other innocents killed, wounded and 
made homeless by his bombs. 
.IIow does one explain the difference 
in American attitudes toward Commu-
nism in Moscow and Hanoi? 
Has Russian Communism been 
smoothed into something more con-
genial? Hardly. The persecution of dis-
senters, more cruel than of Jews, is 
too well known to need rehearsing?
the punishment in mental hospitals 
and labor camps. One savage recent 
example is the death of the 35-year-
old poet Yuri Galanskov in a camp 
this month. He was known to have 
severe stomach ulcers; but when his 
mother brought honey for him last 
June, camp authorities barred it, say-
ing he was not sick but was "just a 
hooligan who shirks his work." 
Or perhaps we could say that the 
Soviet Union does not invade other 
countries, as North Vietnam did the 
South in the spring offensive. But that 
"invasion" was part of a war in what 
had been one country for many hun-
dreth of years and is still regarded 
as such by most Vietnamese. The 
Soviet Union only a few years ago 
brazenly invaded a totally foreign 
country, Czechoslovakia. Have we for- . 
gotten already? 
No, the reason for the difference in 
attitudes is plain enough. The Soviet 
Union is big, powerful and dangerous 
to the United States. North Vietnam is 
small, weak and no danger whatever 
?a country we can afford to abuse. 
Power is a reality in the world, and 
it is necessary wisdom for the United 
States to recognize that. We have no 
effective power to help the Czechs and 
would not improve things by delusions 
to the contrary. D?nte with the, 
soviet Union, as in the SALT agree-
ment, serves important purposes what-
everthe nature of Soviet society. 
The question is whether the reality 
of power ev :Ades more human con-
cerns in foreign policy. Henry Kissin-
ger might well say yes; he might 
indeed regard anyone who asked .such 
question as a sentimentalist. But 
Americans still do have to live with 
their foreign policy, so they ought' to 
iyiderstand its human consequences. 
A world balanced among the strong 
May have ,grave consequences for the 
Areak. That is because the balance is 
essentially an agreement by the power-
ful to let each other have their own 
Way in their own spheres. 
Andrei Sakharov, the great Russian 
"dissenter, said in a recent interview 
that things had grown worse in the 
U.S.S.R. since Mr. Nixon's visit 'to fl 
Moscow: "The authorities seem more 
impudent because they feel that with 
d?nte they can now ignore Western 
public opinion." Limits on American 
influence in Soviet affairs may be an ' 
inescapable part of great-power agree-
ment. But it does not follow that we 
must cease to care about what we do 
'ourselves, in our wort'.

Europ 
There is growing alarm 
within the Nixon administra-
tion over, the economic pro-
grams of our West European 
allies. 
What bothers the Nixon 
men deeply is a program now 
being worked out in the Euro-
pean Common Market which 
aims eventually at a bloc of 60 
countries, each giving the oth-
ers trade preferences and dis-
criminating against the prod-
ucts of the United States and 
other nonmember lands. 
The first step aims at bring-
ing in a group of Mediterra-
nean lands. Quiet behind-
the-scenes talks are going_ 
ahead on this first-step pro-
gram now despite some con-
cerned effort on the part of 
special U.S. trade representa-
tives to stem the tide. 
This system of protection 
and discrimination would, of 
course, put the United States 
at a severe trade disadvan-
tage. Worse yet, the Nixon ec-
onomic-trade specialists here 
fear, it would set off a/ race 
Chinese and Korean lives and 
many billions of dollars in that 
? fratricidal conflict, the pas-
sions now wane somewhat. 
? Then there is the People's 
? Republic of China. In the first 
? years of this last quarter-
? century even a word or ges-
, tyre of civility by an Ameri-
can was political suicide. The 
United States was caught up 
? in mean recriminations over 
"who lost China" to the Com-
munists. Emotionalizing over 
China's involvement in the, 
? Korean war replaced any log-
ical thinking about what must 
? be the ultimate place in world 
society of a country inhabited 
by more than a fifth of the 
world's people. 
Only after more than two 
decades, when only rabid 
American conservatives were 
still spleenful in their view of 
? Peking, was it possible for a 
? Republican president to open 
a new dialogue and set about 
normalizing relations with 
China. 
We look back at the hours 
, wasted in angry rhetoric hurl-
ed at China in the United Na-
tions, in Congress, in U.S. 
? political campaigning, and re-
call how the bitter insults were 
? duplicated in Peking, and eve 
' shake our heads in sardonic 
laughter. 
Now there is Indochina. 
Another of those quarter-cert.. 
turylong abominations. Peace 
may not be nearly as close 
at hand as the American 
people have been led to be-
lieve, but it seems clear that 
"reconciliation and concord" 
, among the people of Vietnam 
is under way. 
And once again we shall 
shake our heads in wonder-
ment that we sacrificed so 
. many American lives, helped 
snuff out so many Asian lives, 
dropped so many bombs and 
destroyed so many people and 
'things, only to see the princi-
pals to the conflict shako 
hands and take the more ra-
tional route of negotiations. 
Maybe there is a lesson in 
all this. Perhaps, just as 
nature establishes a nine-
month gestation period? for 
humans and a 645-day period 
for elephants, a 25-year period 
Is required to convert Interna-
tional madness to sanity. 
The lesson, then, would be 
that utter restraint is called 
for by the rest of mankind 
while Combatants ? are-- given 
time. to. come back to their 
senses. 
, You think of the many times 
when the U.S. and Night , 
could have gone to war per. 
the Germanys?and shu er. 
You think how, inviting 
was for the United States to 
take rash action after the 
seizure of the U.S.S. Pueblo. - 
or North Korea's shooting 
down of our EC-121 aircraft, ? 
or the many periodic out-
bursts of violence in the do-
'militarized zone between the' 
two Koreas. And you sigh in 
relief. 
This is not to suggest that 
there will not be more killing 
in Indochina or more crises in 
Europe. An observation of 
the current state of mankind , 
suggests that it is folly to ex-
poet lasting peace?or even a 
generation of it. 
But it may be that if the . 
great powers keep their cool, 
these regional and internal 
squabbles need not blow -up 
into massive conflagrations. ? 
. And who knows but what man ; 
might cut the period of transi-
tion from madness to sanity ' 
? from 25 years to 20, Or even ? 
to 10? 
r e Bloc Bother IJIX? 
worldwide to set up competing 
protectionist trade blocs. This 
development would knock the 
props out of the free trade 
policies which American Pres-
idents ? Republican and Dem-
ocrats alike ? have pushed for 
the past two decades. However 
inconsistent our other policies 
from time to time, both politi-
cal parties have united on the 
necessity for cutting trade 
barriers as a stimulus to pros-
perity. 
The growth of these protec-
tionist blocs might make it 
very difficult Indeed for the 
United States to recover from 
Its unfavorable balance of 
trade unless Washington too 
resorted to stiff import con-
trols and set up an internation-
al preference bloc .of its own. 
The Europeans tell Nixon's 
protesting representatives that 
the Tieing tide of UM, teolitio. 
logy Is forcing them Into Ode 
protectionism. 
The U.S. technology base is 
too strong, and growing too 
rapidly, they claim, for Euro-
peans to compet e. First 
there's the vast U.S. market 
itself, which sparks new tech-
nology and offers the opportu-
nity for profitable exploitation 
of new developments. Then 
there's the worldwide spread 
of U.S. companies which en-
ables this country to learn 
quickly, and to rapidly take 
advantage, of technological 
improvements wherever 
they're developed. The finan-
cial strength of these interna-
tional U.S. concerns provides 
them with the necessary capi-
tal to put these advanced tech-
nological discoveries into use 
with amazing speed, the Euro-
pean Common Market men 
say. As a result, they claim, 
Europe must in self-defense 
expand its own base. Thus the 
plan for a 60-country alliance.

rt?- or once, Henry Kissinger's timing was 
off. Even as the President's national 
security adviser was deeply immersed in 
a final round of Vietnam peace talks, 
the U.S. foreign policy establishment was 
about to shift its attention to a different 
part of the world. "Nineteen seventy-
three will be the year of Europe," Ad-
ministration officials say?and to prove it 
they have scheduled a mind-boggling 
series of European negotiations that, in 
a quieter way, promise to have as great 
a global impact as Mr. Nixon's dramatic 
trips to Peking and Moscow in 1972. 
It all begins this week when the U.S. 
will join 33 other nations in Helsinki 
for a preliminary round of talks on the 
question of European security. At the 
same time, the U.S. and Russia will meet 
in Geneva to begin the second phase 
of talks on limiting strategic weapons. 
Then, after the first of the year, East 
and West will tackle the thorny problem 
of how to reduce military forces in Cen-
tral Europe. And to cap it all off, next 
summer will usher in the vitally impor-
tant "Nixon round" of meetings on Euro-
pean trade. "Fasten your seat belts," one 
Western diplomat said last week. "It's 
going to be a bumpy Europe for the 
next four years." 
Indeed it is. During his second term 
in office, Mr. Nixon is widely expected 
to pursue a radically new kind of policy 
toward Europe. Essentially, there will 
be two major themes. First, the Presi-
dent intends to treat both his old ad-
versaries in the East and his old friends 
in the West with equal toughness. Sec-
ond, he plans to use the economic might 
of the U.S. as his chief weapon in deal-
ing with Europe?East and West. What 
all this means is that the U.S. is ready to 
launch its most ambitious diplomatic 
offensive in Europe in the past two 
decades. Below, NEWSWEEK examines the 
main issues and the likely outcome of 
this European strategy: 
DEALING WITH OLD ADVERSARIES 
Since 1964, the Soviet Union has been 
clamoring for a Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
Moscow's hope is to obtain the seal of 
diplomatic approval on the postwar sta-
tus quo?a divided Europe in which Rus-
sia can exercise hegemony over the East-
ern portion while penetrating the West 
politically. The West has been wary, 
but sonic months ago?after the Soviets 
offered concessions guaranteeing West-
ern rights in Berlin?the U.S. gave its 
nod. Still, there was one hitch. The 
Nixon Administration insisted that sep-
arate talks be held simultaneously on 
mutual and balanced reduction of East-
ern and Western forces ? in Europe 
(MBFR)?a hard-nosed bit of bargain-
ing that Moscow reluctantly accepted. 
The opening of the Helsinki talks on 
European security represents something 
of a diplomatic victory for the Russians. 
But the Western delegations, and par-
ticularly that of the U.S., have no inten-
tion of letting the Soviets get their own 
way in the Finnish capital. The major 
Ahead 
wrangling will come over the agenda of 
the full conference. The Russians would 
like the preliminary session in Helsinki to 
do no more than establish a vague 
agenda and set a date for the conference. 
But the U.S., with the support of its 
NATO allies, means to bold out for a 
meaningful agenda that could lead to-
ward concrete agreements. "We don't 
want to spoil their party," said an Ameri-
can diplomat in Moscow. "But we do want 
it to produce something more tangible 
than pious propaganda declarations." 
Along with its Western allies, the U.S. 
will make it plain that the "inviolability 
of European borders," about which the 
Russians are expected to make much 
fuss, should also apply to the countries 
of the Eastern bloc?a slap at the so-
called Brezhnev doctrine of "limited 
sovereignty" that permits Moscow to 
interfere in the internal affairs of its sat-
ellites. The West may even demand 
that the Russians discuss such embar-
rassing questions as the free flow of in-
formation and people and exit visas for 
Soviet Jews. And while the Russians hope 
to drive wedges between the U.S. and 
its allies, Washington believes it can en-
courage a certain degree of independ-
ence on the part of the Eastern Euro-
peans. In exchange for support in the 
agenda battle, the U.S. is said to be pre-
paring to offer huge American invest-
ments to the Eastern Europeans. "In the 
end," remarked one American official, 
"the Soviets may kick themselves for 
having thought up such a conference." 
Balanced: The U.S. is expected to 
take the same tough line in the MBFR 
talks. Moscow will argue that cuts should 
be made on a man-for-man, tank-for-tank 
basis. But since the forces of the Warsaw 
Pact outnumber NATO's 1 million to 
500,000?and since Soviet troops in East-
ern Europe would be moving back a mere 
500 miles into their own country while 
U.S. troops in Germany would withdraw 
aeross the Atlantic?the U.S. will argue 
for a "balanced" reduction in forces. This 
means the Soviet Union will be asked to 
cut its troop strength by a greater per-
centage to make up for its geographic 
proximity to Western Europe. 
Despite all the possible pitfalls in these 
complex negotiations, high U.S. officials 
are confident that Washington is dealing 
from diplomatic strength. "The Soviets 
need us more than we need them," says 
one U.S. expert. "They know the tech-
nology gap between the U.S.S.R. and 
the rest of the world is widening and 
they also need to acquire marketing and 
management skills. We can give them 
those things in exchange for a more lib-
eral attitude toward East Europe and for 
a reasonable approach to troop reduc-
tion. That's what d?nte could be about 
?if they play their cards right." 
NEGOTIATING WITH OLD FRIENDS 
As seen from Western Europe, the 
whole question of European security and 
force reductions is a two-edged swoid. 
The West Europeans are concerned that 
62 
'the Nixon Administration will use the 
threat of a drastic and unilateral reduc-
tion in U.S. troop strength in Europe to 
get the members of the expanded Com-
mon Market to lower their, barriers to 
U.S. trade. Fearing a crisis in EEC-U.S. 
relations, the Europeans 'point to Mr. 
Nixon's recent statement that lp will 
take action to insure "that the W., can 
continue to get a proper break our 
trading relations with other nations.., 
Although the President did not liame 
the "other nations," he is known to he 
exercised over the system of trade prac-
tices being constructed by the Common 
Market. A tariff wall around the Market 
was one thing and it was understandable 
that Europe's former colonies in Africa 
would get preferential trade treatment. 
But then came the concept of "reverse 
preferences," whereby the former col-
onies pledged themselves to give EEC 
bidders preference in investment proj-
ects in their area. Next, the EEC began 
to expand the concept of preferential 
'trade treatment to huge areas outside 
its traditional zones of concern. Special 
deals were made for the import of citrus 
fruit from Spain and Israel and the talk 
in Brussels began to turn to the possibili-
ty of associate membership in the EEC 
for Mexico and Singapore. At this point, 
the Nixon Administration trade experts 
blew up. "If the EEC keeps this up,' said 
one, "they will have a system that effec-
tively fences out all competition from the 
U.S. and Japan." 
Rivalry: What moves the U.S. will 
make to counter the EEC remains to 
be seen. But it seems likely that next 
summer's "Nixon round" of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will be 
a lively one, with the U.S. pushing hard 
for clearer rules governing trade be--
tween the U.S. and the EEC. Some Eu-
ropeans, however, fear that the U.S. in-
tends to go even farther than that in its 
trade rivalry with the EEC. "The U.S. is . 
planning a major trade offensive in the 
Eastern European countries," insists one 
EEC official. "They will try to set up au-
tomobile plants there, taking advantage, 
of the cheap labor, and flood the EEC: 
countries with Eastern-made cars with 
good old American names." 
Unless some way is found to head off 
a full-fledged trade war between the, 
U.S. and the EEC, the former allies: 
might find themselves in a bitter rivalry. 
for the available energy resources in the' 
world. So far, the Nixon Administration:. 
has talked tough but done little to estab-
lish a high-level dialogue with the EEC: 
about these problems. And many diplo-
mats on both sides of the Atlantic are, 
fearful that the economic difficulties ? 
could one day lead to a political confron-
tation between the U.S. and Western 
Europe. "Nixon," says one European, 
may go down in history not just as the . 
President who normalized relations with 
China and Russia but as the man respon-
sible for the U.S. and Europe breaking 
their bonds and going their own ways."

? 
? i 
-Walter Schwarz, New Delhi, on the genesis' 
of an Indian myth 
What goes wrong in India used 
to be blamed on the British, or 
the failing monsoons, or the 
Pakistanis, or ? the pro-Chinese 
Communists. Now, suddenly, it's 
? the CIA. 
In the last few weeks Mrs Gandhi 
and her top party officials have 
named the CIA as responsible for 
riots in Delhi and Bihar, language 
disturbances in Assam, student 
demonstrations in Punjab and 
Kerala, unrest in Kashmir, hostile 
processions in West Bengal and, 
most sinister of all, the emergence 
of a grand alliance among opposi - 
tion parties. 
The fashion was born in Sept-
ember when the Congress Party 
President, . Dr Shankar Dayal 
Sharma, said at a press confer-
ence that "the CIA is creating 
conflict in my country and using 
its stooges for making peaceful 
demonstrations violent." 
Whether this was the opening 
shot in a deliberate campaign to 
make India spy-conscious is not 
clear. Perhaps having come out 
with it, Dr Sharma could not dis ? 
own it, and his Prime Minister 
could not disown hi in. Perhaps it 
was such a popular thing to say 
that Dr Sharma went on saying it 
and the others joined in. 
Whatever the reasons behind 
the timing, it is fairly clear that 
Mrs Gandhi, Dr Sharma, and a 
great many other Indians believe. 
the charges to have more than a 
grain of truth. 
What Dr Sharma thinks the CIA 
has in mind was explained at his 
next press conference. It meant 
"to show after all that India is 
not strong, but economically weak 
and politically disjointed and Mrs 
Gandhi's victory only an accident." 
For her part Mrs Gandhi said she 
agreed there was a "cult of 
violence" and that this was 
fomented by "foreign Powers which , 
hate to see India strong." More 
specifically, she said the CIA had 
"lain dormant" during the Bangla - 
desh war "because the people 
were united." Its activities had 
now been "revived." . 
After this stamp of approval, 
Chief Ministers and Party bosses 
all the .way from Kashmir to 
:Kerala came out with what the 
CIA had been doing to rock their 
'particular boats. , 'Phe ? Chief 
Minister of Punjab found the CIA 
behind the demonstrations of the 
ultra -right-wing Alkali Dal Party, 
while his colleague hi West Bengal 
singled out the pro -Chinese Com - 
munist Party as the ? agency's 
stooges. 
Nobody offered evidence. It is 
not Up to us to prove it but it is 
up to the CIA to disprove it," 
said Mrs Gandhi haughtily. 
This remark provoked Mr Rogers 
into raising the whole matter with 
India's Foreign Minister in Wash - 
ington. Mrs Gandi now explained 
that she had meant that the CIA's 
doings were already well enough 
documented up and down the 
world. 
The Americans reacted quietly.. 
The Embassy in Delhi put out a 
two-line statement calling Dr 
Sharma's original attack "out-
rageous and totally devoid of fact." 
Then it kept quiet, waiting for the 
storm to blow over. Mr Rogers 
assured Mr Swaran Singh that no 
CIA activities were harmful to 
India. 
Sceptics in Delhi put the whole 
thing down to political manoeuvr-
ing. "Methinks the lady protests 
too much," said the Indian 
Express, while the Hindustan 
Times found it "difficult to resist 
the feeling that the Congress 
Party is casting about desperately 
for allies and scapegoats for its 
relatively poor performances in 
the economy." 
It was indeed a time of food 
riots after a drought, and of mount-
ing popular exasperation over 
rising prices and corruption. The 
Congress Party was about to hold 
its annual committee meeting, 
where the leadership was expected 
to be attacked from within by the 
left wing. And both Left and Right 
opposition parties were planning 
nation-wide demonstrations. As a 
scapegoat and a diversion, the 
*CIA filled the bill. 
Politics may account for the, 
timing of the anti -CIA campaign. 
But the proposition that the United 
States is actively interested in 
preventing India from becoming 
strong is very widely accepted ? 
and Mrs Gandhi is clearly among 
the believers. For most Indians 
the final doubts were. dispelled 
:luring the Bangladesh .war, when 
toe Seventh Fleetfcarrier appeared 
in the Bay of Bengal. 
The correspondence columns of 
Delhi newspapers have been less 
sceptical than the editorials. 
Among scores of irate anti -CIA 
letters the least violent was 'from 
a kind sohl who sought to excuse 
the Embassy for its denial on the 
grounds that AmeriePu Ambas 
sadors never knewwhat the CIA. 
was up to. ' 
.The American role here has. 
been an object lesson in how to ? 
: give aid 'and win enemies. In the ? 
last twenty years India got more 
'than ten thoUsand million dollars' . 
worth of American aid ? more ? 
than from all other countries put,

together. In one drought after 
another, American surplus wheat 
and rice staved off famine. The 
"green revolution" which has 
begun to make India independent 
of food imports was partly financed 
by American dollars, as was nearly 
every branch of education, welfare, 
industry, and development. 
The dependence bred resent-
ment. And now that the aid has 
been cut off as a result of the war 
with Pakistan, there is fresh 
resentment. A veteran of the Con-
gress ?Party's freedom struggle 
and now one of Mrs Gandhi's 
senior colleagues assured me that 
"Americans are far more arrogant 
than the British ever were. Aid 
was for their own benefit, not 
ours." This minister said he saw 
a pattern running through all the 
riots which suggested to him that 
the CIA was master-minding them. 
The wheat and rice used to be 
paid for in rupees which were 
banked here for American use. 
Some of the money went on 
internal aid projects. A lot of it 
paid for the hugely staffed diplo-
matic and aid missions here ? 
and also paid the expenses of an 
army of visiting American 
scholars. These scholars did much - 
to lengthen the CIA's shadow het 
because they were always going ?-
off to sensitive border areas like 
%Vest Bengal or Assam to write 
their theses. Some who were not 
CIA did not help matters by 
publicly declaring that the CIA 
had "approached" them. 
The American profile has now 
been drastically lowered. Even 
before the war the food stopped 
coming in because 'it was not 
needed. The war stopped all aid 
not tied to projects ? which stilt 
leaves about a hundred million 
dollars a year coming in. The. 
Indians themselves have put a 
stop to the wandering scholars by 
insisting that they operate in the 
framework of a local university. 
No doubt the CIA is still here, 
though perhaps it has pruned its 
numbers as drastically as the US 
Aid Mission has. The embassy still 
lists 108 diplomats in Delhi (the 
British 51, the Russians 67). The 
American mission includes a 
"defence supply representative" 
and two assistants, though no 
American arms have arrived here 
for many months. (An embassy 
spokesman said these people are 
being phased out.'!) 
In addition to fact-finding, the 
CIA may well give funds to 
political parties and individual 
political friends, just as . the 
Russians are widely assumed to 
finance the pro-Moscow Com-
munists and the Chinese to help 
their own faction. But the notion 
that the CIA organises food riots 
and student demonstrations has 
yet to be proved, or even made to 
sound plausible.

ister, Lt. Gen. Muhammad Saddek, to obtain 
the planes may have been one reason for his 
resignation or dismissal by President Sadat 
last month, some qualified Egyptian observ-
ers believe. 
Cairo sounded out the London and Paris 
governments about purchasing the Jaguar 
before President Sadat removed Soviet mili-
tary advisers from Egypt last July, these 
sources say. 
Request repeated 
The request was repeated in more fortnal 
fashion after the Soviet departure and new 
Soviet refusals to supply the advanced MIG. 
23 fighter-bomber. After the request had 
moved up to the highest levels of both 
governments, secret British and French 
Cabinet decisions rejected it for reasons that 
have not veen made public. 
What General Saddek and Egyptian Air 
Force commander, Maj. Gen. Hosni Emba-
rek, evidently hoped was to obtain credit 
purchases of an entire Western-supplied 
defense system. This would have involved 
delivery of several squadrons of both the 
training and tactical-strike version of the 
Jaguar, as well as an integrated air-defense 
system of a type similar to that used by 
NATO in Europe. 
Retraining involved 
This would have meant phasing down 
Soviet help, five to six years of retraining the 
Egyptian armed forces, and new Western 
options to Egypt for purchasing other mili-
tary equipment as well, it is understood. The 
Jaguar, developing Mach 1.7 speed at about 
33,000 feet altitude, has shorter range and 
lighter payload than Israel's U.S.-supplied 
Phantoms, and lower ceiling and speed than 
the Soviet MIG-23. But it is comparable with, 
pt to 
WI 
NJaylefr, 
and some experts think superior to, the MTG. 
21, the Soviet-supplied standard aircraft of 
the Egyptian and Syrian Air Forces. 
Israel claimed shooting down two Syrian 
MIG-21's in an air and artillery battle 
continuing through most of the day Nov. 10. 
Syria claimed it shot down four Israeli planes 
of unspecified type and admitted losing two of 
its own. Israel denied losing any of its 
aircraft, in the first air battle on the Israel-
Syrian front since Sept. 8. 
Appearance of Syrian MIG-21's in combat 
was thought by some Arab observers to be 
evidence of new Soviet deliveries to Syria. 
Syria has mainly used the slower and much 
older MIG-17's and occasionally MIG-19's in 
past fighting. 
Final rejection 
A final Anglo-French rejection of the 
Egyptian request for Jaguars was one reason 
for Egyptian Prime Minister Aziz Sidky's trip 
to Moscow Oct. 16-18. During this trip Mr. 
Sidky was again told that Moscow could not 
presently supply the MIG-23. 
Careful observers of the Egyptian scene 
believe the Sadat government's desire for an 
advanced air combat system ? whether the 
MIG or the Jaguar ? is a quest for a prestige 
symbol proving that at least one big power 
has confidence in Egypt. 
Israel in better shape 
It is, however, not a sign that President 
Sadat really wants full-scale resumption of 
hostilities to expel Israeli troops from Sinai. 
Either the MIG-23 or the Jaguar system 
would require many years more of rigorous 
training. Egypt is estimated to have one 
trained pilot for each of the Soviet-made 
front-line combat planes it possesses, while 
Israel has more like three trained pilots for 
every aircraft. 
General Saddek's successor as War Min-
ister, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Ismail, has quietly 
notified Western governments that the Egyp-
tian Army command will never again allow 
Russian advisers to get key command. and 
advisory posts in the Egyptian armed forces. 
This was accepted as tacit reassurance 
that in case of a Soviet-Western confrontation 
in Europe or elsewhere, Soviet personnel or 
units in Egypt could not act against Western 
forces in the Mediterranean.

By David Winder 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
United Nations, N.Y. 
Nobody here expects the Middle East peace 
dove to be released during this week's 
General Assembly debate. 
If it is to be released at all, it will come next 
year with some possible American initiative 
for an interim agreement. 
One informed observer typified the rather 
languid attitude of the United Nations these 
days when he said: "People are waiting for 
the UN General Assembly session to fade into 
history; are waiting for the turn of the year to 
come and then they can look at the problem 
again.".. 
There is considerable expectation that 
after President Nixon has shaken down his 
new Cabinet some time in the new year, the 
administration will be forthcoming with 
some kind of partial agreement between 
Israel and Egypt for the reopening of the Suez 
Canal. 
No other peace plan ? not withstanding the 
UN's traditional role here or increasing 
European desires to play a settlement role ? 
is envisaged yet. 
As one European diplomat put it, "Nobody 
wants to cross wires with the Americans." 
Debate due for scrutiny 
The debate will be watched for any signs of 
flexibility in the parties' approach to any 
possible negotiations. 
As far as the UN is concerned, Israel is 
expected to take an even tougher position. 
For some time how there have been veiled 
warnings about the relevance of Security 
Council Resolution 242. 
Israel probably will let it be known that if it 
is pushed around too much at the UN, it may? 
drop altogether its interest in 242 as a basis 
for any future settlement. 
This 1967 resolution is considered the 
central core for any peace settlement since it 
was found acceptable to both the Israelis and 
the Egyptians. It calls for Israeli withdrawal 
from occupied territories and Egypt's re-
spect for safe, secure, internationally recog-
nized boundaries. 
Israel's unsympathetic attitude to the UN , 
is well known, and Western observers feel 
that in spite of official Israeli denIals 
Foreign Minister Abba Eban's absence from 
this year's Middle East debate typifies 
Israel's back-of-the-hand attitude to the UN 
these days. 
Willingness indicated 
However, Israelis are thought to be respon-
sive now to some diplomatic prodding from 
the United States. 
In principle at least, Israel has been, 
making such sounds as to suggest a willing-
ness to make concessions. But the concern 
here is that Israeli concessions inevitably 
would be at a pace not only of their own , 
choosing but also at a pace unacceptable to 
the Arabs. 
ve may not ugiter 
Thus any American calls for major Israeli 
concessions such as vacating the Suez Canal 
east bank and the reopening of the canal itself 
could come up against stiff Israeli resistance. 
The other vexing problem for Middle East 
specialists is that both Egypt and Israel have 
of late been indulging in a game of diplomatic 
hide and seek. In short they are never 
simultaneously interested in seeking the 
same objectives at the same time. 
? Israel for instance now appears more 
interested in an interim arrangement pro-
vided there are no pre-conditions. Egypt, 
which had earlier professed an interest, cold 
shoulders this approach now. 
Officials disappointed 
Much of Egypt's disenchantment with the 
? American formula is directly attributable to 
Cairo's sour feelings about Washington. 
One observer here said: "The Egyptians 
are bitterly disappointed with the fact that 
the Americans showed no response to the 
expulsion of the Russians. They desperately 
wanted some gesture to show appreciation." 
This perhaps explains Egypt's more than 
usual preoccupation with a UN-type settle-
ment based on Security Council Resolution 
242. 
Middle East peace watchers here hope that 
whatever resolution is approved in the 'com-
ing debate will not be so tough as to present 
obstacles to the peacemaking processes they, 
see as inevitably restarting in the new year.

Gen .0 Amin Gqi, a Different Blessage 
5q7PTINh Aid: An 
tr, 0 
Eleettion Deeclition 
By Jim 
KAMPALA?Although the election has 
passed, an apparent attempt by the Nixon 
administration to use the executive branch 
to bolster the President's margin of victory 
continues to have impact in the deeply trou-
bled East African country of Uganda. 
The effort involved a decision by the State 
Department to deceive the American public 
about its intentions to continue financial aid 
to the regime of President Idi Amin in the 
wake of Amin's sympathetic mention of Hit-
ler's method of dealing with Jews last Sep-
tember. 
After its spokesman, Charles Bray, told 
newsmen in Washington that a development 
loan to Uganda was being held up as a result 
of American displeasure with Amin, the de-
partment cabled instructions to American 
Ambassador Thomas P. Melady in Kampala 
to tell Amin that Bray's straightforward?as-
sertion had been "misinterpreted". 
Melady, who had beseeched Washington to 
continue aid, was also instructed to assure 
Amin that there was no connection between 
technical delays that had developed on the 
loan and Amin's statement on Hitler. , 
After Amin ignored Melady's plea that 
this assurance should be kept secret and re-
leased it through the Uganda Press, Bray 
evaded direct comment on the conflicting 
American positions In Washington and Kam-
pala. ? 
But he election is over now and the im-
pact of Jewish votes on foreign Policy may 
have lessened. The United Stoles is clearly 
pushing ahead with plans to provide more 
than $6-million in aid to Amin's government, 
which has shown no sign of responding to 
any American attempts to moderate Amin's 
nation-destroying excesses. 
Moreover, the aid is being channeled to a 
government that with every passing day ap-
pears to be less able to provide its share of 
the money and government manpower 
needed to administer aid projects. 
,. Amin has allowed his army to slaughter 
off thousands of soldiers from tribes antag. 
onistic to his rule and has apparently en- ? 
cour-aged his security forces to eliminate 
many of the country's best educated men, 
whom he feared as a threat. The death toll 
since Amin took power in 1971 includes 
three Americans. 
Government ministers and civil servants, 
whom Amin publicly ridiculed last week as 
"weak" and "i tile" now refuse to make even 
minor decisions for fear of attracting the 
general's attention and losing either their 
jobs or their lives. 
The two loans the United States is on the 
verge of formally awarding to Uganda are, 
for building teacher training institutes and 
for an animal husbandry project. The fact 
that they are relatively small does little to 
mitigate their psychological importance, es-
pecially In a time when aid is hard to come 
by in general and especially in Africa, where 
a number of other governments have shown 
themselves capable of administering such 
loans diligently. 
They will also follow a statement by .Amin 
last week praising the ? Palestinians for the 
intelligence they have shown. in hijacking 
planes. Tire United States, which has put it-
self at the forefront of the campaign against 
Approved For Release 2001 
110aglana 
international terror-lam, is not taken note 
of the new Amin statement. 
One of the two principal argun'q.nts that 
'emerge from discussions with those here 
who support going ahead wii.h the loans are 
that they were originally offered several 
,years ago, before Amin ousted President 
Milton Obote. 
There is a "moral obligation" on the part 
of the United Staes to go ahead with the aid, 
this argument holds. Only a few minor tech-
nical details of signing the loans have been 
delaying them. 
The second is that by continuing aid the 
United States will have more influence with 
Amin and be in a better position to protect 
the 700 or so American diplomats, aid tech- , 
nicians, missionaries and businessmen who . 
have stayed on in Uganda. 
The implication of this argument is that it 
might be dangerous to displease Amin by 
stopping the loans. The Americans who have 
chosen to stay on are in effect hostages. 
Britain, which currently has about 3500 , 
citizens living in Uganda (more than 4000 ? 
Britons have quietly filtered out of the coun-
try in the past few months) uses the same 
argument for its attempts to stay on good 
terms with the erratic Amin. 
Amin is set to take over Um tea estates of 
28 British farmers in the Fort Portal area of 
Uganda next week, The clear signs here are 
that Britain has decided not to make an 
issue of this, even if Amin offers little or no 
compensation, as he did ?ot to the 42,000 
Asians he has just expelled. 
While publicly hinting that Its policy to- ? 
yard Amin is based on fear for its nationals 
still there, Britain is known to have con-
veyed to the United States its private view 
that any possible alternatives to Amin are so 
much more frightening that the West 
should continue to try to, work with him. 
The 'alternatives prestimahly are soldiers

the Middle East, Amin has not struck at . 
strategic Western interests in Uganda, 
which because of its proximity to Kenya and 
Zaire and to the Nile is strategic country, by 
A Wean policy standards, 
'rwo aid hums will probably have little ef-

But they could help protect broader political 
interest. 
Diplomats in east Africa. already talk of 
the danger of the new interest shown ?in 
!. Uganda by Somalia, a major Russian aid ,

-Just as South Africa and Rhodesia have 
profited politically from Amin's irresponsi-

government. But there are far more compel-

ChicangiTribune Press Service 
ROME, Nov. 18?The riddle 
Of the Red Arrow remains - Un-
solved. 
? Red Arrow is a freighter 
that sailed three months ago 
from the northern Italian port 
of La Spezia bound for the Li-
byan capital of Tripoli. ? 
..The merchant ship carried 
_110 armored personnel carri--
era and tanks, all manufac-
tured by Italian arms comp-
Inca, when it cast off. 
? Their olive-drab color had 
been changed to beige for des-
ert camouflage. The ams 
were destined for the army of 
,Col.. Moammar Kadati, the 
Libyan president who has 
emerged as the most militant 
of Arab leaders: 
The riddle posed by the de-
parture of the weapons is this: 
Is Italy becoming a major 
source of Libyan arms and is 
it seeking a greater role in the 
Middle East? 
Secrecy Shrouds 'Affair 
: Indications are that the an-
swer is yes, but exact details 
are hard to come by. The Red 
Arrow affair, as it is some-
times called, is shrouded in 
Secrecy and obscured by infor-
mation that is a stew of facts, 
half-truths, and falsehoods. 
About all Italian officials are 
tivilling to say is that Italy 
ranks fifth among European 
arms exporters, having sold 
$23.5 million worth in the 
1960s, and that the heart of the 
arms industry is La Spezia, 
where 13,000 civilians are em-
ployed by arms makers. 
? Anyone who tries to obtain 
. more than that is likely to end 
up feeling like a charaCter in a 
bad foreign intrigue novel. 
.! For example, a source who 
delivered a four-page memo-
randum on the arms deals 
asked that the memo be shred-
ded and 'burned after it Was

rnthlp Libg? 
r` Friend May Saffer ? 
? 
"If it should fall into the 
wrong hands, my friend might 
be hurt," he explained. 
!,Diplomals, politicians, and 
arms merchants who were in-
terviewed abruptly ended the 
Conversation whenever the 
Libyan affair was mentioned. 
They gave replies such as, "It 
is a delicate matter. I can't 
discuss it," or "I'm not au-
thorized to make any state-
ments, and don't tell anyone 
you even talked to mc." 
The reason for all this cloak-
and-dagger rests in Italy's 
percarious political situation 
and in the bitterness which 
many Italians feel toward Ka-
deli. 
Shortly after he overthrew. 
the government of King Idris, 
in 1970, Kadafi expelled 30,000 
Italian settlers from Libya and 
confiscated their property. 
"He even ?expelled the 
dead," said one right-wing 
Italian, explaining that Kaden 
'sent the bodies of Italians bur-
ied in Libya back to their 
homeland. 
?? Libya had been under 
Rome's rule from 1911 to 1913. 
The expulsion enraged. con-
servative Italians, who refer 
to the Moslem leader as "the 
lunatic of Tripoli." They form , 
a Powerful bloc in the current I 
government, which is a coali-
tion of centrist and right-wing 
elements. Consequently, Rome 
is maintaining a lid of secrecy 
on its Libyan foreign policy to ! 
avoid another political crisis 
in .a country where political I 
event. 
crises are almost a daily(' 
The Red Arrow shipment ! 
was first revealed by II Seco- ' 
16, the semiofficial voice of the 
S. I. Italy's n e o -Fascist 
party. The Foreign and De-
fense Ministries admitted that 
armored personnel carriers 
were among the-cargo but de-
nied allegations that the ship 
also carried 30 Leopard tanks, 
which are built by Oto-Melara, 
one of the country's largest 
arms manufacturers. 
Informed sources said the 
government's statement was 
substantially correct, altho a 
highly-placed military source 
said that about eight tanks of 
a different type?probably 
American-style M-47s?had 
been loaded on the Red Arrow. 
Question Is Tabled 
The press reports produced 
excited reactions from right-
wing politicians, who brought 
the matter up to Parliament, 
which promptly tabled the 
question for an indefinite pe-
riod. - 
Some Italian officials ex-
plained that the arms deals 
were strictly between Libya and 
private companies, a doubtful 
hypothesis. One Oto-Melara ex-
ecutive said recently, "Even to 
buy a nail we must request 
authorization from the govern-
ment." ? 
The affair 'remained quies-
cent until last week, when Il 
Secolo and other newspapers 
reported that the government 
planned to supply Libya with 
G-91Y fighters, and advanced 
aircraft manufactured by the 
Fiat Company in Turin. 
Knowledgable sources tend to 
discount this charge, tho they 
are maintaining a wait-and-see 
attitude. 
Privately, right-wing sources 
said that, in addition to fight-
ers, shipments 'of -helicopters, 
tanks, and small arms are be-
ing readied for Kahn's army. 
Moreover, a well-informed 
American with Libyan con-
tacts said Italy is also consid-
ering a contract to supply Lib-
ya with 105 mm. artillery 
pieces.? 
Reports Called Fonndless 
All this was described by the 
Defense Ministry as "absolute-
ly without foundation." 
In attempting to learn if the 
information is indeed ground-
less, one finds himself .enve-
loped by the mystery-cloaked 
world of international arms-
selling and faced with contra-
dictory statemetns. One execu-
. 
67 
iiVC of Oto-Melara said all. the 
,reports were false, but his 
boss indicated they were par-
tially true. ? 
The latter then . said, "I 
would like to tell you what I 
know, but I am Chained by 
secrecy." 
It should be explained that /I 
Smolt) is not noted fur its ac-
curacy, eke *a pt in military 
matters., 
"If you want to know what's 
going on with the military and 
arms shipments, they're the 
People to see," said an Israeli 
source. ? 
' Why Arm Poe? 
The question some. Italians 
are asking is why their gov-
ernment is arming its arch-
foe, Kadafi. A northern indus-
trialist provided this explana-
tion: ? 
"Armaments must be -updat-
ed . . . they become obsolete 
. However, for certain pur-
poses, they are still excellent. 
This explains the conktant 
coming and going here of; for-
eign uniforms and gentlemen 
wearing turbans. In La Spezia, 
they are no longer a curiosi-
ty."
? 
- Other sources say that dis-
posing of army surplus is not - 
the only reason for the appear-
ance of turbaned gentlemen ,in 
.La Spezia. The other reason, 
they say, is oil. 
The voyage of the Red ar-
row followed the signing of an 
agreement between the Libyan 
government and ENI, the Ital-
ian-state-owned oil company. 
In exchange for drilling rights, 
ENT was to provide Kadafi's 
government with 51 per cent 
of all profits. 
? The sources say that !arms 
were included in the exchange. 
"No, Leopard tanks haven't 
been sent to Libya?not yet," 
said an Israeli official. "But 
there isn't any doubt that Italy 
has sent arms to Libya and is 
catering to Libya in exchange' 
for the oil concessions to 
. ENI." ?

ters. 
Fundamentally there was a pull between 
Western countries, which, for reasons of cost 
and logistics favored a European secretariat 
and the "third world," demanding a bigger 
piece of the UN action. 
By acting in concert, the Group of 77, as the 
underdeveloped world is known ? even 
though its membership is well above 77 ? 
succeeded in having the first major global 
UN body located outside the industrialized 
Western world. 
It remains to be seen whether the initial 
advantage of winning broader environment 
support among developing nations will out-
weigh the logistical objections to siting the 
UN environment secretariat in Nairobi. Cer-
tainly before Stockholm, support for the 
conference among developing nations was 
hardly enthusiastic. 
One danger of Nairobi as some en-
vironmentalists see it is that there may be 
some push now to emphasize development 
rather than environment. 
Poorer countries have long had their 
suspicions that the Western countries that

have "made it" are anxious to impose 
enviromental controls at a time when the 
poorer countries seek rapid industrialization 
and development to catch up. 
Such concern ? lest development be given 
priority over the environment ? is still 
academic, however. 
A more pressing concern Is the political 
fallout, if not in Western Europe, then cer-
tainly in the United States. 
The U.S., which has voted $100 million to 
the environment fund, voted against the 
Nairobi decision even though it subsequently 
pledged its support.

administration but with the mood of Con-

Si 
By Hilary Ng'weno 
NAIROBI, Kenya?There are no sim-
ple moral answers to the question 
of the plight of Asians currently being 
evicted from Uganda. Certainly, Presi-
dent Idi Amin and his military govern-* 
ment are exhibiting a racism toward 
Asians which makes nonsense of much 
of Africa's righteous stand against the 
racist white minority governments of 
southern Africa. There are grounds for 
. genuine concern for the safety of any 
: Asians left in Uganda. 
Yet it is hypocritical of the world 
to try and look at this problem in 
? isolation from its historical and inter-
national implications. The fate of Brit-
ish Asians in East Africa was put in 
Jeopardy first not by anything any 
African government did but by the 
cumulative decisions of various Brit-
ish governments, starting with racially 
discriminatory colonial laws which 
placed the economies of East 'African 
nations into foreign, essentially Asian 
hands, and ending with the disgrace-
ful passage by the British Labor Gov-
ernment in 1968 of a law barring the 
entry of nonwhite British citizens into 
Britain. 
Admittedly the British in their rac-
ism have not been as crude as Presi-
dent Amin and his soldiers. They have 
not rounded up the Asians in their 
midst, dispossessed them, abused them, 
stripped them of their dignity and 
threatened their very lives. But then 
it has not been necessary. It has all 
been done for them by the Ugandans.. 
It is pointless for Britain to try and 
remind Uganda of her reepotleibIlltita 
0 Uganda residents, whether citizens 
Or not, when Britain herself has in 
the lest five years been busy trying 
the need for some geographic distribution of 
UN agencies, there is concern among them 
. and environmentalists lest a Nairobi-based 
secretariat with coordinating-agency respon-
sibilities be too isolated from European-
based UN bodies. There are other logistical 
questions. 
Says one key environmentalist,_ not at-
tached to the UN, on the possibilities of 
enlisting experts: "If you want a good man, 
and a good man is going to be pretty busy, 
and it's the best part of a day to get him there 
and the best part of a day to get him back, not 
to speak of the jet-lag aspect, then the whole 
logistical problem becomes grossly aggra-
vated." 
African countries in turn say opposition to 
their site is primarily politically motivated 
and that the time when industrialized coun-
tries could act as if the African countries 
were colonies and decide for them has 
passed. 
Racism 
to evade her own responsibilities to-
ward British citizens. Altogether there 
are still more than 100,000 British citi-
zens of Asian origin in East Africa, 
The British Government, until the. 
Uganda crisis, had insisted on taking 
them into Britain at the rate of three 
thousand entry vouchers a year. Even 
assuming that each voucher repre-
sented five entries, this would mean 
that it would take more than seven 
years for all British Asians in East 
Africa to be absorbed into Britain. 
A convenient timetable for Britain, 
but hardly one which took into con-
sideration any of the wishes of the 
East African nations concerned. And 
a timetable which was in effect a uni-
lateral British interference in East 
African affairs. For what Britain was 
telling East African governments was: 
"Sorry, old chaps; we know the Asians 
are our problem, but you've got to 
take care of them until we are ready 
to take care of them and that may , 
not be for another seven or so years." 
Given such arrogance on the part of 
Britain, it is a wonder that no crisis 
in relations between Britain and her 
former East African territories erupted 
earlier than the current Uganda crisis. 
For this the British and the world 
can thank not the statesmanship of 
British leaders but rather the maturity 
'and patience of the governments of 
Kenya and Tanzania. 
The real tragedy of Uganda is not 
the Asian problem, for that is Britain's 
tragedy rather than Uganda's. The real 
tragedy Is that President Amin has 
been able in a very short time to un-
leash pent-up racist' feelings among 
the public which observers of the 
tigantlau wino bed thought won) MIA ? 
and gone. These racist feelings have 
provided the military government of 
Uganda, with a base for popularity 
69 
which it badly lacked and need-ed. But 
they will not solve 'any of the prob-
lems Uganda is faced with. I 
The Asians have been odd-men-out 
in East Africa. They are hated because 
they are thought to be industrious,: 
wealthy, clannish; because they do,: 
, not mix with Africans; because they ' 
cheat and bribe to advance their busi-
ness; because they are smarter than , 
Africans; because they are different; 
because they are Asian. But they will 
sooft be gone from the Ugandan scene:, 
The African will remain, and it is 
only then that the full scope of the 
Ugandan tragedy, will be realized. 
Already a number of prominent 
Ugandan Africans have disappeared. 
The former Chief of Staff in the Obote 
Government and one-time Uganda 
High Commissioner to Ghana, Briga-
dier Opoloto, has not been heard of 
for months. The Chief Justice, Mr. 
Kiwanuka, is gone. So is the vice , 
chancellor of the country's only uni-
versity. Disappearance as announced 
by the Government of Uganda is a, 
euphemism for all kinds of things, 
including murder at the hands of 
soldiers. Because of the pervading in, 
security and terror most of Uganda's 
Intellectuals would dearly like to leave 
the country if they could do so with-
out arousing the suspicions and anger 
of the trigger-happy army. 
The long-term prospect for the coun-' 
try is bleak. Economically the current 
Asian crisis is disastrous for Uganda. 
The xenophobia which President Amin. 
has aroused among average Ugandans 
is bound to boomerang, with painful 
consequences for everyone. That is the 
real tragedg of Uganda,

THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE REVIEW' 
Nov-Dec 1972 
' 
The capabilities for conducting effective intelligence gathering and paramilitary 
operitions have long been. essential tools in the conduct of national policy. 
Unfortunately, however, certain misconceptions regarding the manner and circum-
stances in which they can be employed arose in this country after World War II and-
led directly to setbacks like the Bly of Pigs: Rather than shunning the possibility of 
using covert operations in the ,future to gain policy objectives, experiences like the 
Bay of Pigs merely underline the fact that policyrriakerprraust be educated as to what 
Is possible, and the responsibility for this lies with' the career intelligent* community. 
6 . 
CASE S 
F 
A lecture delivered 
by 
, Professor Lyman B. Kirkpatrick, Jr. 
Y * 
I think that the usual caveat is 
necessary before I get into the subject at 
hand. What I am about to say today are - 
my personal views; they do not repre-
sent the official CIA view nor the 
official U.S. Government view. This is 
an after-action reporoon an episode in 
our history which engendered perhaps 
the most intense emotions and public 
reaction we have seen since World War 
President Kennedy in the aftermath 
of the Bay of Pigs made the comment 
that "Victory bas a hundred fathers; 
. defeat is an orphan." I would simply say 
that as Inspector General of the CIA at 
the time, I was probably in charge of 
the orphanage. 
There is a very specific definition of 
covert operations. In the broad litera-' 
ture of intelligence, covert operations 
are about as old as espionage, which has 
been called the world's second oldest 
profession. To be properly considered 
covert, an operation Must be designed in 
such a way that it can easily be dis-
avowed by the originating government. 
The hand of the sponsor must not be 
visible. 
Covert operations, on the other 
hand, must not be confused with irregu-
lar warfare. An example of irregular 
warfare that has received recent world-
wide attention is the operation in Laos. 
Everybody On both Sides knows who is 
doing what to whom; the aid and assis-
tance is obvious. That is irregular war-
fare. A covert operation, however, to be 
totally covert must be so clandestine, so 
well hidden, that its true sources may 
never be specifically proven. Guesses, al-
legations, speculations may be made in 
I ? 
the public media, but no proof or verifi-
cation is permissible -if the operation is 
,to be properly considered covert. 
At this point in our discussion I 
believe it will prove .helpful to simply 
list some of the questions that must be 
asked before a covert operation is, 
properly undertaken. 
O Can it be done covertly? Can the 
role of the sponsoring government be 
sufficiently concealed at each step so as 
to avoid disclosure and. thus either 
failure or a diplomatic setback for the 
sponsor? And if the cover of the opera-
tion is destroyed at any stage, are 
alternative measures or withdrawal pos-
sible? 
.0 Are the assets available to do the 
job required? Are the indigenous per-
sonnel available who are secure and in 
the proper place to do the work re-
quired? If not, are there those available 
who can be put into place? . 
O Are all of the assets of the spon-
soring government being used? Can the 
operation be controlled? Will the in-
digenous forces being used respond to 
direction or are they likely to go off on 
their own? Will they accept cancellation 
of the operation at any time? 
8 If it *succeeds or fails, will they 
maintain silence? The maxim "Silence is 
golden" has never been fully accepted in 
this country, but it is still worth asking. 
Also, can it be handled securely within 
the sponsoring government? 
O Finally, and vthis is perhaps the 
most imp'ortant question the Onited 
Otate0 must eels, Is the Soh wowth the 
potential gain? Has there been a true 
evaluation of the chance of success or 
failure by ?an objective 'group not di-

rettly or emotionally involved with its 
Implementation? Do the policymeiters 
hive a realistic understanding ,of" the 
. operation? 
These are some of the basic questions 
Iwhich must he asked -prior. to,,the 
' mounting of any clandestine or covert 
operation. 
, BeCoie turning to the case Siudy 
itself, a brief review of recent Cuban 
history is appropriate. Fidel Castro 
landed in eastern Cuba in 1956 with 
what turned out to be 12 men. He 
gathered forces in the Sierra Maestra irt 
, 1956 and 1957. Even more important; 
' however, was the growth of anti-Batista 
groups in the cities of Cuba among the, 
middle class, the professionals, and the 
elite. It was the erosion of Batista's vital' 
ipolitical support in the cities which led: 
!directly to his downfall. The guerrillas 
in the countryside served merely as a 
catalyst in this process. And eventually, 
on 1 January 1959, Castro stepped into 
the vacuum left by the fleeing Batista. 
. A fact which many people do not 
seem to recall was that despite our 
misgivings about Fidel Castro, and the 
U.S. tGovernment, did have them, we 
recg'?ized ....his government fairly 
promptly. The first cabinet of the Cas-
tro iegime 'Was probably one of the 
? finest in Cuban history. It is worthy to 
note, however, that-very few, of the new 
Cabinet members stayed very long. 
In addition to recognizing Castro, the 
United States continued its subsidy of 
Cuba's sugar, crop which at that time 
amounted to approximately $100 mil-
lion. The three major U.S. oil companies 
doing business in.. Cuba advanced him 
$29 million because his treasury was 
bare when he took over. Batista and his 
cohorts had sees to that. Castro was not 
invited to the United States on an 
official trip, but he came here unoffi-
cially to attend a meeting of the Ameri-
can Society of Newspaper Editpts in 
Washington, and he did have an inter-
view with the then Vice President of the 
? United States, Richard M. Nixon. Then, 
one by one, the men around Castro 
began dropping off.. He speedily ex-
propriated U.S. property worth $968 
million. Even his closest barbados- the 
bearded ones-that had been with him 
in the hills started to turn against him as 
he appointed more and more Commu-
nists, and by the middle of 1960 it 
became obvious that the United States 
wee not *rig GO be able to d@ intOititeie 
with Fidel. This, I might say, was a very 
? great shock to Americans. Cuba was a 
country that we regarded as our pro-
tege. We had helped liberate it from 
Spain; we had assisted it through the 
? ? 
Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100020001-4 
' birth pangs of becoming a nation; we 
had helped it achieve independence. We 
had looked at it as one of our offspring, 
but perhaps we were ? guilty of having 
looked after it too closely and in too 
patronizing a manner. 
It was in 1960 that President Eisen-
hower, based upon advice of his most 
? senior advisers, made the decision that 
we should try to do to Castro what he 
had done to Batista. Here is the germ of 
the first mistake-no one seriously 
studied the question as to whether this 
? was possible. Most of the anti-Castro 
? people had left Cuba; they. were pouring 
into Florida and if there ivat a resistance 
to Fidel Castro, it was mostly in Miami. 
One of the realities of life was that Fidel 
Castro had shown unique abilities, to-
.gether with his brother Raul, Che Gue-
vara, and others, in developing a militia 
and armed forces of some consequence. 
Further, they succeeded in establishing 
one of the better intelligence services in 
Latin America. It was learned at a very 
early date that agents sent into Cuba 
spent more time trying to survive than 
carrying out their assignment. When this 
happens to clandestine agents, the situa-
tion is obviously quite serious. 
President-elect Kennedy was first 
briefed on the Cuban operation on 17 
November 1960. The basic concept was 
to recruit exiles, send them in by ones, 
twos, and teams to develop the basic 
ingredients for overthrowing a govern-
lir!) t: an intelligence network first, and 
!ii '? sabotage nets, units for psychologi-
cal warfare, and finally guerrilla bands-
hopefully all sufficiently independent to 
be watertight and operable. 
It should be noted that these clandes-
tine operations in 1960 were successful 
only to a degree. There were many 
brave Cuban exiles who volunteered 
even though they knew full well that 
anyone suspected of active opposition 
to the Castro government in Cuba faced 
the prospect of a firing squad. Anybody 
caught landing on the shores of Cuba, 
? either by airdrop or by maritime opera-
tion, could hardly expect alemency 
from the new Cuban authorities. 
On 29 November 1960 President-
elect Kennedy was given a briefing at 
lenOth on a new approach to the Cuban 
problem. It had become fairly apparent, 
under pressures of external events, that 
perhaps there was not going to be 
sufficient time to build up a large 
enough underground in Cuba to do to 
Castro what he had done to Batista. 
'Castro was moving .closer and closer to 
becoming a full member of the Soviet 
bloc, and the Soviets were sending 
increasing amounts of military equip-
ment to Cuba- Cuban pilots had been 
.1 
sent to Eastern Europe for training, and 
Moscow as supplying or planned to 
supply aircraft. The Russians y.vere also 
supplying or planning to supply ad-
vanced Patrol boats which would make. 
? maritime infiltration difficult, if not' 
impossible. Those, were grave 'concerns' 
because'it was felt that the 'pressures of 
time might soon eliminate any possi-
bility of building up any clandestine 
operation. One cannot reasonably take 
slow aircraft in against jets, for if their 
air defense was at all adequate, C-47's 
and the like would Surely be shot down 
while trying to get agents and supplies 
in. Further, one cannot infiltrate a 
hostile coast if the opposition maintains 
extensive patrol activities in the sur-
rounding waters. 
? Rather than trying to build clandes-
tine nets all over Cuba-particularly in 
the cities with guerrilla forces sup-
? porting from the Escambrays and Sierra' 
-Maestra-it was proposed that a more 
i.substantial force be landed in order. to 
seize a beachhead.' It was hoped that 
support from popular resistance within 
Cuba or perhaps, more importantly, 
that support from defections within 
Cuba's militia and armed forces would 
materialize, thereby contributing signit-
candy to the anti-Castro forces momerie: 
turn and help assure their victory 
through more conventional military 
means. 
On examination of what the biogra-
phers of President Kennedy have writ-
ten, it can be concluded that the Presi-
dent never really fully understood that 
this proposal entailed a military opera-
tion in the true sense of the word. 
Instead of an assault landing consisting 
of some 1,500 men, President Kennedy 
seemed to think this was going to be 
some sort of mass infiltration that 
Would perhaps, through some mystique, 
become quickly invisible. 
Two major plans were considered. 
The original plan was directed at cap-
turing the small town of Trinidad on the 
south coast. Intelligence available indi-
cated it was fairly lightly held. There 
was an airstrip nearby, but perhaps most 
importantly, it was at the foothills of 
. the Escambray Mountains, and the. 
brigade, if it got into trouble, could 
head for the hills and theoretically live 
off the land. When this plan was re-
viewed by the JointiChiefs of Staff and 
others, the reaction was that the capture 
of a town would be too visible and 
create excessive "noise." Therefore an-
other locality should be picked which
. 
would not be quite as conspicuous. 
The second plan was to land at the 
Bay of Pigs. Since the area was sparsely 
populated, the proposed lahding would 
71 
Approved For Release 2001108/07-:-C-1A-R-DP77-00-43-2R000100020001-4 - 
not involve capturing a town. The in-
terior was swampy, and there was a 
limited road network. The area posed 
problems for the brigade; but it was. 
,hoped that it would pose more prob-
lems for the defending forces, particu-
larly if the airborne men captureti a 
crossroads and blocked-off the incoming 
Castro forces, and the brigade with their 
large tanks and fairly heavy hand-carried 
guns could establish a beachhead. ?'D 
Plans envisioned two air raids which, 
in fact, were very critical factors to the 
potential success of the landing. It is not 
known whether the President examined 
in any depth the concept of the air raids 
or the attention they would attract. The' 
initial raid was designed to take place at 
D minus 2 and was directed at knocking 
out the Castro air force and particularly,' 
if possible, the Castro tanks. B-26 air-
craft were to be flown by Free Cubans 
based in Nicaragua. This would allow 
the Cuban exile pilots approximately 20 
to 30 minutes over target area. This 
strike was to be followed at H-hour by a 
second strike with the objective of 
destroying whatever remained of Cas-
tro's ait..,forces. It was anticipated that 
the first ,wtnke, ?would be noticed ? not 
only inSuba, 'but elsewhere. Therefore, 
a light deception plan was conceived 
whereby one of the B-26's returning 
from the strike would?land at Key West 
and the pilot would announce he was 
one of the group of Cuban pilots who 
had decided they had enough of Castro, 
were leaving the Cuban Air Force, and 
had dropped some bombs on the way 
out. There was hope that this would 
provide sufficient cover for at , least a 
few days until the operation was. 
mounted, at which time I presume it ' 
was thought that either the cover would 
not be necessary or simply be merged. 
into the whole operation itself. . 
In mounting' such an operation, it 
was necessary to first train those rujio 
were to take part in it. There were more 
than adequate resources of Cuban man-
power available in the exile colonies in , 
Florida and elsewhere. There was one 
exceedingly difficulCpolitical problem 
however, that being the strong desire 
not to use any Batistianos-people who 
had been prominent in the Batista mili-
tary forces or close to Batista himself. 
This almost automatically eliminated 
anybody that had had any experience 
with the Cuban Armed Forces. 
The recruiting in Miami was done 
under goldfish bowl circumstances. 
There were 113 Cuban exile groups. 
Some of them' were significant and some 
of them were insignificant, but they 
were all active, they were all vocal, and 
. ? - 
? 
Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100020001-4 
they were all there. It was most daficult 
/or the State Department, the CIA, the 
Attorney' General, General, and others iavoived 
to persuade the Cubans to .work to-
gether in a cohesive organization Simply 
because many of them did not want to 
work together due, to prior political 
associations. 
The system of recruiting was done as 
clandestinely as possible. The recruits 
? were then taken to the deactivated Opa 
? Locke Naval Air Station and were flown 
out "covertly" to Guatemala where a 
wealthy landowner had made a sizable 
portion of his mountainous finca avail-
able for training. A training base had 
been hacked out of the wilderness. The 
President of Guatemala, Ydigoras, was 
aware of what was going on and co-
operated fully. President Somoza of 
Nicaragua provided the airfield for the 
B-26?s. 
In retrospect, it might., have been 
wiser to have trained everybody in the 
.United States where they could have 
been isolated somewhere in the vast 
reaches. ? of a Fort Bragg' or. a Fort 
Benning. Latin America is not an easy 
place to do such training because in 
countries the size of Guatemala or 
Nicaragua nearly everybody knows what 
is going on. As early as 30 October 1960 
an article appeared in the Guatemalan 
paper La Nora which described a mili-
tary base in the mountains designed to 
train men for an invasion of Cuba. This 
was when the cover started to Oravel. 
Paul Kennedy of The New York Times, 
a very astute journalist whose circuit ran 
. from Mexico City to Panama, was not 
fair behind La Flora in producing a story 
on the base?who was there, what they, 
were doing, and what they were going 
to do. The discussioins' in Miami were 
such that in his book Schlesinger quotes 
three separate newsmen who upon re-
turning from Miami were able to de-
scribe exactly what was going on with-
out being specific as to where the 
landing was going to be made, or when it 
was going to be made, but that there 
was going to be a landing, that it was 
going to be against Cuba, and that it 
involved a great number of the exiles. . 
The operation was exclusively under 
the direction of the Central Intelligence 
Agency. The Joint Chiefs of Staff were 
asked if they would provide'evaluations 
first of the feasibility of the plan and 
secondly of the quality of training. 
They also, of course, provided upon 
request both supplies that were neces-
sary and manpower to assist in training 
and administration. But the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff 'were not easponoibin 'NI?' the 
plan. It was not their plan, and the 
postoperation blame that was placed on 
them was put on them by others run-
ning for cover. It was a CIA operation. 
Frequent meetings with the President 
from January through March and peri-
odic progress .rep-orts were wed to keep' 
the President informed. As the evidence 
of apparent Russian assistance to Cuba 
continued to grow, pressure was put on 
the President to mount the operation. 
Let me also note that there was a very 
considerable Cuban lobby operable. The 
Cuban exiles had considerable money. 
Many of them were apparently wise 
enough to have kept the bulk of their 
wealth in the United States prior to 
1959. They were, acquainted with 
Americans and the ' American political 
system, and a steady stream of them 
descended on Washington to urge 
greater U.S. action' in support of the 
exile movement up to and including a 
.,full-scale invasion of' Cuba by the 
United States. 
During this period a serious conflict 
'arose within the exile training camp as a 
result of some of the Batistianos being 
brought into the' brigade. These former, , 
members of Batista's 'army were profes-
sional military men whose talents were 
judged to be useful to the operation. A 
mutiny occurred,' however, which 
quickly became known to the rest of 
the world. Twelve Cubans were arrested 
and incarcerated,' and the entire affair 
was written up in the press.'

Staff assessed both the Trinidad plan 
and the Bay of Pigs plan as being

don fail. One of the aspects of the 
postoperation' inspection was specifir 
cally directed to the question of 
whether any of the U.S. personnel told 
the Cubans that U.S. military forces 
:would back thorn up. That, I 'weluld 
submit to you, is almost an imposqe 
question to answer. If you are training a 
group of men to go into battle, you 
aren't saying, "Okay fellows, go ahead, 
but if you don't make it, it's rough." As 
, an instructor you would give your 
, trainees every bit of encouragement, 
and if you say something like, "We're 
behind you all the way," does that 
mean that you are committing U.S. 
military forces? The best available evi-
dence indicated that no U.S. national 
who was involved in training, assisting, 
or direction of the Cubans over prom-
ised U.S. military assistance, but obvi-
ously they were not discouraging the 
Cubans. On the other hand, the Cubans 
to a man as well as the Cuban Revolu-
tionary Council, expected that should 
the brigade falter, U.S. Marines would 
pour out of Guantanamo, airborne units 
, would be dropped, and it would be over

As to President Kennedy's inten-
tions, however, there can be no ques-
tion. The President frequently. reiterated 
his statement' that no U.S. personnel. 
feasible. The U.S. military personnel 
who reviewed the brigade described 
them as well trained and , capable of 
doing their job. Here we run into what 
will perhaps throughout history be the 
most controversial part of the opera-
tion: I label it what the Cubans thought, 
what the Americans thought, and what 
Castro thought. ? 
There are no available figures on 
Castro's intelliaencethe 
United States. However, given the great 
number of Cubans in this country, he 
undoubtedly had a fairly complete in- : 
formation flow from not only our press 
and radio, but from his own sources of 
information as 1/11. Castro was highly 
nervous in the spring of 1961, tesay the 
least. He was aware that an operation 
was being mounted. He was not aware 
of its size or whether U.S. forces would 
be involved. 14e feared the latter greatly,1 
without question. 
The and-Castro Cubans in exile, on 
the (atheeliin, were eowingeci thee the, 
United States q wduld not let the opera-
would be involved, that he wanted no 
Americans on the beach, that there 
would not be any commitment of U.S. 
forces behind the Cubans, that this was 
4 
to be an exile operation. 
The allegation has been made that 
"the operators" deceived the President. 
That is not correct. "The operators" 
principally involved were Allen W. Dul-
les, Gen. Charles P. Cabell, and Richard 
Bissell. They are all men of honor and 
integrity. They were all very much 
involved in the operation. They wetse,all 
reasonably convinced that it would suc-
ceed or had a good chance of success. 
Mr. Dulles has been quoted by both 
Schlesinger and Sorenson as telling the 
President that he thought that this 
operation had a better chance of success 
than the Guatemala operation. Perhaps 
he did not tell the President the Guate-
mala operation only succeeded by the 
narrowest of margins. This was to be-a 
very close matter and entirely different 
from the operation against Arbenz, who 
had but a very limited force to support 
him as opposed to Castro whose 
200,000-man army and militia were 
rapidly increasing In both quality and 
strength.

The method by which the President 
was oriented on the operation has been 
described as a series of meetings where 
? three or more of the operators mould 
brief the President on the ?latest.develop-
? ments. The President would have one or 
two of his personal staff with him, the 
Secretary of State, and any others he. 
.deemed necessary'. There would be no 
papers left; there were no .staff papers 
circulated. The operation was very 
closely held within the U.S."Govern-
'Monday morning and asked whether the 
President could supply some U.S. mili-
tary assistance, specifically sotto 'aircraft 
from the carrier Boxer to come in and. 
cover the landing. The President turned' 
it clown. ? 
The' landing went in as scheduled. Of 
the five battalions?I would call them 
.teinforced companies?that landed, only 
one landed in the wrong place;'it hit a 
reef. The rest got ashore, and the tanks 
got ashore. The airdrop was successful, 
and then Castro's jets appeared: two Sea 
Furies and three P:33's. Two of the 
principal landing Ships, one containing 
the bulk of the ammunition, were sunk. 
The others were driven away, not to 
return. And from ithat moment on, the 
operation was doomed. 
The brigade fought brilliantly. They 
probably took 10 to 1 casualties from 
the other side. But it was 1,453 men 
against 20,000 with another .80,000 in 
Terve. Not only were Castro's planes 
available, but all of his tanks started to 
move south from Camp Libertad out-
side of Havana. Despite the Most strenu-
ous efforts to essist ,the brigade and to 
get them additional. ammunition, they 
could not win against such odds l By 
Wednesday it was all over as the brigade-
was out of ammunition.. 
At a meeting Tuesday night in the 
White House, after a congressional re-
ception, the situation was described to' 
the President. He authorized two un-
marked planes from the Boxer to' fly 
high cover in support of the 13-26's, but 
they were not to engage in hostilities 
unless attacked. There was a mixup in 
time. The B-26's arrived an hour before 
the Boxer planes; four of the .B-26's 
were shot down, and among the men 
lost was an Alabama Air National 
Guardsmen crew who had volunteered 
to substitute for the Cuban pilots, who 
were exhausted. ? ? 
The President was under the impres-
sion initially that the H-hout airstrike 
was actually going to be made from the 
beachhead. But, of course, the airstrip 
ment. Similarly, it was very closely held 
within the CIA. ? ? 
Many aspects Of the 'operation were 
well done. The 13-26 strike on. D minus 
2, despite having to operate at maxi-
mum range, was successful. It did . 
manage .to damage the Castro air force; 
but the quality of the Castro air force 
had been underestimated. The Sea 
Furies were known to be there 'and were 
considered dangerous, but the, P-33's, 
which were ignored or -were not 'con'-
sidered to be dangerous, did prove to be ? 
one of the more decisive elements. 
The cover on the D mirrui 2 airstrike; 
mentioned before, Was ripped off in a 
matter of minutes. Circumstances had 
this event occur on the same day that an 
actual pilot in the Castro air force 
defected and landed in Jacksonville. The 
press was all over both Cuban planes 
instantly. The Foreign Minister of Cuba 
in the United Nations denounced the 
.United States for open attack on Cuba. 
'The U.S. Ambassador to the, United 
Nations; Adlai Stevenson, had not been 
thoroughly advised on the operation. He 
had been given what was later described 
as a rather vague briefing of the ,opera-
tion. Ambassador Stevenson immedi-
lately denied U.S. complicity, and prac-
tically before the words were out of his 
?mouth it was fairly obvious that they 
were not true. This then created a rising 
crescendo of concern on the part of the ? 
President, Secretary of State, and , 
Others. On Sunday night?the landing , 
was to be made on Monday morning?
the President cancelled ?The H-hour 
strike. The 3-26's were already warmed 
up and ready to take off from Nicaragua 
when the word came in to cancel. 
0 General Cabell, Acting Director of 
the CIA at the time, was given permis-
sion to appeal to the President who was 
at Glen Ora in Middleburg, Va. Cabell 
decided not to appeal, but after going ? 
back to the operational headquarters 
and seeking advice from a representetive 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he eelled 
the President in 'Middleburg at 4:0 a.m. 
?' 
was never secured to that degree, and 
the concept of eight 13-26's bombing 
from the beachhead was simply not 
feasible. Also, there was no reserve 
available to reinforce the, brigade, and 
the rationalization that once the beach-
head was securad then Cubans could 
pour in from Florida and that'assistance 
would come from the United States and i 
Latin American countries was not valid. ?

to the beachhead?three of them had: 
; sons with the br;gade?but by then the, 
operation had failed. 
, Now let us look at why the Bay Of 
Pigs landing failed. Why did we mount it 
in the first place? We mounted it for a! 
political objective, to -get lid of e gov-1 
ernment that we disliked intensely that 
had cropped tip near our soutWrn 
shores. We mounted it with the thought 
that the objective would be accom-
plished by a covert operation when we 
did not want to use our conventional 
forces. We had not been able to get rid 
of Castro by diplomacy, and our in-
creasing economic pressure was not 
proving to be any more effective. All 
i intelligence reports coming from allied 
sources indicated quite clearly that he , 
was thoroughly in command ofMa., 
and was supported by most of the! 
people  who remained on the island. ! 
About 2 weeks before the operation,1 
the President had. announced that the I 
? United States would not intervene in I 
Cuba. Nevertheless, shortly before the 
landing, the Castro security forces 
rounded up approximately 200,000 
Cuban' and put them in concentration 
camp. 'These people whose commit-
ment the Castro regime suspected were 
precisely the elements in Cuban society 
upon which the success of the landing 
depended. ? 
What we were really trying to do was ? 
to do something inexpensively that we 
did not want to do the bard way. 
Affecting this choice was a mythology 
about covert operations that had arisen 
after World War II. The brilliant exploits 
of the French Resistance, of the Danish 
Resistance, of, the Italian partisans, of 
Tito's partisans, of some of the opera-
tions behind the' Japanese lines in 
Burma all helped create a belief that 
you could accomplish with covert 
operations what one did not wish, to do 
,by conventional or overt means. Simi-

the Pentagon was excluded because ? President, this is going to create one hell

obvious that we're behind it. If it 
succeeds, great; if it fails, we are in for 
deep trouble." Obviously most people 
thought it was going to succeed. In fact, 
most of those talking to the President 
thought it was going to succeed. . 
Also, trying to mount an operation 
of this magnitude from the United 
States is about as covert as walking nude 
across Times Square without attracting 
attention. (Although, I must say that 
the latter is becoming more of a possi-
bility every day.) In retrospect, the use 
of the U.S. bases would have been more 
feasible because we did have the capa-

knowledge of the 01' retion was handled 
on such a close ba.;is within the Joint 
Staff. ? 
Now when I say that the bulk of the 
CIA was excluded, I mean that the 
operators running the operation were 
:assessing and evaluating the intelligence, 
not the intelligence directorate, where it 
should have been done. Much of the 
intelligence came from the Cuban re-
sistance, which was not always an objec-
tive intelligence source, and, as later in 
the missile crisis, their reports had to be 
scanned and evaluated based upon other 
information. 
The White House advisers have noted 
? in their books that nobody in the White 
House was really being critical about the 
operation. They assumed that the Presi-

unwilling to submit themselves to being

, these, in turn, must be reviewed in the 
most tough, highly critical, and objec-
tive manner. There must be those 'that 
are going to say "no" or at least express 
all, the warnings and let the President 
know the dangers that he is taking: 
While no one questions the absolute 
authority of the President. to make 
policy and to insure that it is properly 
implemented, the locus for the conduct 
of the operation is important. It should 
be at a much lower level of government. 
Having covert operations. run out of the 
White House or even out of the Office 
of the Secretary of State or the Secre-
tary of Defense makes absolutely no 
sense whatsoever in any society. 
If the President males the policy, get 
rid of Castro, that is about the last he 
should hear of it. If something goes 
'wrong, he can fire and disavow, which is. 
what a President should, do, not . ac 
knowledge and accept blame. Of course, 
I am being critical of the President, but 
I think that this is essential in this area. 
Mi. Dulles, incidentally, after the failure 
of, the Bay of Pigs, as he had done 
previously when the 1/..2 went down 
over Russia, said to the President, "If 
you wish, I will go." He was a very wise 
and able man, and he recognized that 
when an intelligence failure takes place, 
the first expendable person is the direc-
tor of the operation; 
There is a further corollary to.what I 
have said thus far; a US. controlled 
intelligence base must be in existence. 
In this case it. would have meant an 
intelligence network operating in Cuba 
which was knowledgeable, controlled, 
and reliable. There was no such network' 
in Cuba at the time. Instead there were 
scatterings of intelligence nets. The in-
formation, to a large degree, was con-
trolled by Cuban exiles who, of course, 
wanted us to go into Cuba. It was not a 
U.S. controlled intelligence base: 
My final comment is that the Bay of 
Pigs experience does not mean we, 
should forget covert operations as a tool, 
for implementing national policy. In 
fact, that is the last thing it means. We 
Would continually examine the concept 
and doctrine and reevaluate all Covert 
operations and irregular warfare activi-
ties, keeping the capability in being. .As 
has been the case with' our Military 
forces,. when a war is over, our immedi-
ate instinct is to demobilize; the same is 
true in intelligence. But the capability 
for mounting a covert operation is an 
onoadingly inipotnant capabilitY to 
our government to have. It may not be 
'used but, like certain military capabili-
ties in peacetime, the expertise should 
be available and ready if needed.. .1 
NEW YORK TIKES 
19 November 1972 
The - 
Cub if 
nnection 
By James Reston 
WASHINGTON?For the first time 
in many years, the United States and 
Cuba have a common problem, which 
may lead to reappraisal of the rela-
tions between the two countries. 
President Nixon doesn't want Ameri-
can commercial airplanes to be hi-
jacked to Havana and Fidel Castro, ac-
cording to the Swiss, doesn't want 
them to land there, and this is now 
under the most careful if oblique dip-
lomatic discussion. 
Mr. Nixon's problem is very simple. 
?He wants secure, on-time air traffic 
within the United States and abroad, 
but the American air traffic is not se-
cure, it is not on time, for passengers 
are subjected to security baggage 
checks at every airport, ,primarily for 
fear of criminals who regard Cuba as 
a sanctuary. 
, Fidel Castro's problem is a little 
more complicated. He is waging an 
ideological war against the United 
States and Latin America, and vice 
versa, but most of the Americans who 
,hijack planes are not Communists 
seeking sanctuary in Cuba but ordi-
nary criminals stealing planes, de-
.. 
manding millions in ransom money, 
and hoping to get both the money and 
freedom when they land in Havana. 
On the testimony of Swiss officials, 
who represent the United States in 
Havana, this is not what happens. 
They say that the Cuban Government 
is not sympathetic but very tough on 
the hijackers, who are, jailed under 
very severe circumstances. 
According to the Swiss diplomats, 
the Cuban Government is not only 
WASHINGTON 
"The skyjacking 
problem has forced 
the U.S. and Cuba to 
begin talking again." 
tough on the hijackers, but suspicious 
that thou ,hijaeklrig operations may 
be used' by the United States as a 
means to spy on what's going on in 
Cuba. 
: Accordingly, Castro is not sending 
back the hijackers to the United States 
75 
because he suspects them of subver-
sive intelligence activities against Cuba, 
and he is keeping them in jail because ; 
'he doesn't trust, them, even, if they 
'have Communist backgrounds. 
Also, Castro, again according to the 
Swiss, is holding the ransom money ; 
.that.lands in Havana with the hijack-i 
??ers; not because he wants ,to help the: 
,hijackers but because the U.S. Trees:, 
:ury impounded between $60 milli*, and $70 million in Cuban assets wheVf 
Washington broke diplomatic relations t 
with Havana, and he wants to use this 
hijack money to get the $60 mhhlih, 
, 
to $70 million back. 
What troubles officials here in-' 
' Washington is that one of these hi- ? 
:jackings to Cuba may end in a disaster' 
and that the American people, ,alreaay 
inconvenienced by baggage checks and 
long delays in air travel, may then 
' revive the Cuban crisis by demanding ' 
that action be taken against the 
Havana sanctuary. , 
; The Nixon Administration, annoyed'; 
as it is 'by Castro's anti-American prop- .. 
' aganda and subversion in Latin Amer." 
?ica, would prefer to leave bad enough , 
'alone, and let Castro suffer in Isola-
tion with his own economic failures 
-at home. 
But this will, not, be easy if Cuba 
'continues to be a sanctuary for sky-
'jackets. The United States has been 
_paying little attention to Latin America' 
in the last few years. Meahwhile, the' 
Soviet Union has established a keep-
out doctrine iri" Eastern Europe and ? 
:China will be doing much the same in " 
Southeast Asia, while,the United States 
? no longer, tries to apply the Monroe 
:Doctrine in Cuba. 
According to onq diplomatic report, 
the Cubans may plit the latest three 
American skyjackers on public , 
'partly to keep the diplomatic situation 
from deteriorating any further, and ? 
,partly to discourage hijackers from 
'landing there. 
In any event, the skyjacking problem 
'has forced Washington and Havana to 
'begin talking again about the future, . 
though indirectly through the Swiss 
'Government, but while everybody., 
,denies it, these indirect talks could 
:lead on to a new accommodation with - 
Havana as they did last year between 
.Washington and Peking. 
President Nixon' is very cautious 
about these things, but it is awkward 
for him to explain why he wants to . 
reach an understanding With Brezhnev 
in Moscow and Chou En-hal in Peking 
but won't even talk to Castro in Cuba.' 
:This is undoubtedly why, after the 
_most private talks with the Swiss in 
Washington and Geneva, 'Secretary of 
State Rogers has made clear in public 
that the United States now wishes to, 
try to reach an accommodation with 
Castro on this entire problem. 
Accommodations between nations 
, come about in strange ways as was 
'obvious last year in the Kissinger visit 
fa Pekitift. 
has now forced Washington and Ha-
vana to talk again, however indirectly, 
and it could result in a new appraisal 
of President Nixon's relations with 
Latin America, .which by his own 
admission is long overdue.

would, immediately and tangibly benefit both 
parties." This is the larger significance of Havana's 
and .Washington's newly expressed interest in a 
hijacking dialogue. Handled properly, it could lead 
through cultural exchanges, claims settlements, 
trade talks and political relations?the familiar 
Tout?to an American detente with the only Com-
antmist state (Albania aside) still out in the cold. 
. Bat given Fidel Castro's suspicions, not to say his 
political investment in portraying the United States 
as a devil, our manner in dealing with Havana is 
crucial. We do not stress this point only because 
.Mr. Nixon last week gratuitously observed that he 
anticipated no change in Cuba's policy and, there-
fore, no change in his own. The success, which is 
to Say the potential, of the hijack dialogue is at 
stake. Cuba has asked to discuss not only the hijack-
ing ,of American planes to Cuba but the hijacking 
o CUban boats to the United States and what it 
believes to be the closely .related issue of the 
"illegal" flight of Cubans by means not involving 
hijacking (by private boats, for instance). The State 
Department has responded positively but, in ac-
cordance with past policy, only to the offer to 
ditctiss takeovers of American planes. 
We assume this response was a bargaining posi-
tion, ? not a final position, because "the hijacking 
problem" cuts both ways. For the United States its 
essence is safety in the skies. For Cuba its essence is 
the security of the Castro government: By prevent-
ing its citizens from departing?last year Havana 
halted the six-year airlift that had brought a quar-
ter of 'a million refugees to Miami?Cuba means to 
give them no real alternative but to accommodate tci 
Communist rule. 
It could well be that a warmer Political atmo-
Sphere would make negotiation of both halves of 
the problem easier. The fact remains that the Amer-
ican interest in coping with plane hijacking until 
? now has been subordinated to its interest in making 
life a bit more difficult for Fidel Castro. 
Perhaps Castro was looking anyway for a face-

saving way to start coming in from the cold. Per-
haps the Russians, tired of the cost and nuisance. 
of supporting Cuba, gave him a nudge. At any rate, 
the last two hijackings have been notably different 
from most of the earlier ones;. the last two plainly. 
have. involved a large degree of. criminality and 
sheer danger. Mr. Castro seems to have understood, 
that the surge of American concern over the two'. 
hijackings gave him a certain oponing that ho 
not have or need when hijackings were the stuff 
of bad TV jokes. We think that, in his offer to 
bargain, he ought to be presumed serious until 
proven not so. 
We would further argue that It is not only the 
link between Americans' safety in the skies and 
Castro's legitimacy that should incline the United. 
States to bargain seriously with Cuba. If President 
Nixon can deal directly with Moscow and Peking, 
why should the smallest and weakest of the Com-
munist states alone be held at arm's length? In the. 
dozen Castro years, the hemisphere has seen that 
neither the man nor his doctrine nor his disciples, 
certainly not his example in Cuba, has excited. 
"revolution" anywhere beyond his borders. Castro 
himself now makes no more than a ritual appeal for 
the cause which a few fearful Americans, but virtu-
ally no realistic Latins, identify with his name. Nor 
in a period of detente with the Soviet Union, and of 
intercontinental and submarine-launched missiles,. 
does it make political or military sense to overdo, 
the old worry that Moscow will make Cuba a "base.", 
In reaching out to Cuba, there is a certain prob-
lem in resassuring those American allies who, either 
in response to American entreaties or for reasons 
of their own, supported the political and economic 
boycott of Havana which the United States or-, 
ganized a decade ago. But just last June at the. 
Organization of American States, no fewer than - 
seven Latin states declared that each country should 
make up its own mind on Cuba. Some particularly. 
insecure or repressive Latin governments may need' 
some special handholding. But surely that problem; 
is manageable. 
. To be sure, Fidel Castro remains a very tough and 
fractious fellow to deal with. We would be the last 
to say, however, that he's too tough for Richard 
Nixon.

WASHINGTON ? A World 
Council of Churches (WCC) re-
port charges that the present 
government of Uruguay has en-
gaged in "widespread violation 
of basic human rights," in-
clueing both physical and psy-
chological torture of political 
prisoners, in its current efforts 
to wipe out Tupamaro revolu-
.tionaries. ? 
' A State Department ; official 
who conferred recently with the 
three-man team which compiled 
the report said that the church-
men drew a grimmer picture of 
the situation in Uruguay than 
was generally reflected in diplo-
matic sources. 
? "They portray a deeper area 
of concern than I was aware 
of," said Charles A. Meyer, as-
sistant secretary of state for in-
ter-American affairs. 
The churchmen say in their 
report that "thousands" of 
Uruguayan citizens have been. 
arrested and held in-
communicado without trial 
since April 15, when the Urugu-
yan congress approved a 30-day 
"internal state of war" against 
the Tupamaros. 
"Persons arrested and held 
indefinitely are presumed to be 
guilty of subversion and pos-
sible complicity with the Tupa-
maro urban guerrilla movement 
and are subjected to military 
justice which is very slow (only 
three military judges in the 
country) and from which there' 
is no appeal, the report says. 
The 'report cites "impressive 
evidence" of the use of torture 
by both police and the military. 
While such measures are "pur-
portedly aimed at the Tupa-
maros," the churchmen charge, 
talk 
they are "in fact extended 
widely to broad segments of the 
population for political rea-
sons." 
The World Council of 
Churches ?report was compiled 
by three U.S. churchmen who 
spent five days in Uruguay in 
June investigating. They,. are' 
Dr. William P. Thompson, chief 
executive officer of the United 
Presbyterian Church, the Rev. 
Dr. Eugene L. Stockwell, assis-.

World Division of the United 
Methodist Board of Missions, 
and the Rev. Dr. Thomas J. Lig-
gett, president of the United 
,Christian Missionary Society of 
the Christian Church (Disciples 
of Christ). 
The latter two are former 
missionaries in Latin American 
and speak fluent Spanish. 
In their report they note, 
"strong suspicion that military 
and police assistance given to

Dr. Stockwell said in an inter

the State Department the

ending economic aid as well. -

Now that President Nixon has opened up a speaking 
relationship with Communist China, developed a commer-, 
cial and economic detente with Communist Russia and:: 
indicated a policy of peace and reconstruction for Come 
rnunist North- Vietnam, it would logically follow that he 
miss no opportunity to begin what may well be the most ' 
touchy of all such maneuvers ,vis-A-vis the Communist 
world: an unfreezing of United States relations with 
Cuba. Although in comparison to China, Russia or' even 4 
Hanoi, Castro's Cuba is not much More than a roaring 
mouse, it is still?geographically, politically and emo-
tionally?a major disturbing factor in the foreign policy 
spectrum of the Americas, particularly of ' the United ; 
'States. 
That opportunity to embark on a new policy?despite ,. 
the President's rigidly adamant position toward Cuba 
expressed in a newspaper interview only a few days' ' 
ago?may be nearer than anyone had hitherto dared tri, 
believe. Ironically, it is the 'recent criminal hijacking- , 
of two American planes to 'Cuba that has, presented both 
the Cuban and United States Governments with the 
chance to test each other's desire to push, if ever so. 
slightly, 
slightly, against the immense barriers that still separate 
them. 
In reaction to these two hijackings?of an Eastern 
'Airlines 727 on Oct. 29 and a Southeni Airways DC-9
Nov. 12?the Cuban Government has' now specifically;I.,' 
suggested the opening up of bilateral negotiations to 
deal with the problem, at the Same time alleging in its 
usual florid language that the United States had started 
It all by permitting a succession of "hijackings" of Cubart,-., 
vessels by Cuban exiles, defectors and refugees operating ' 
out of Florida. 
0 * 
Nevertheless, it is apparent from the Cuban statement 
that Dr. Castro is ready and even anxious .to work out ' 
an agreement on the hijacking issue; and 'it is equally 
apparent from Secretary of State Rogers' unusually warm,' 
and personal response that the United States wants to 
do so too?whether directly or through third parties. 
If this opening is achieved, it would indeed represent a 
particularly high order of statesmanship on, the part of 
both the United States and Cuba to move on to other,: 
things. 
It simply makes no sense any more?and President,?

To Curb HU= 
gem, Inu,prove TeS With Havana 
Somehow passing the hijack screening, three 
armed men boarded and commandeered a Southern 
Airways jet in Birmingham Friday, picked up $2 mil-
lion in ransom at one stop, forced the pilot to take 
off at another although the FBI had shot out the 
plane's tires, wounded the copilot, and finally landed 
on foam in Havana. The public should learn at once 
what flaw in the hijack screening let the three 
board. The FBI must explain why it took the con-
giclerable risk of starting to shoot. The media must 
ask themselves whether, by their play-by-play re-
porting of the 29-hour, 4,000-mile adventure, they 
did not scare or embolden the hijackers to act more 
rashly than they otherwise might. It seems a mir-
acia no one was killed. 
In the end, however; hijacking comes down to 
what the .hijackers do in the end. No one can safe-
ly- predict what angry and unbalanced men will do. 
But one can say that, if hijackers knew they had no 
haven, it could not fail to affect?their calculations. 
For hijackings in the Western hemisphere, of course, 
the cominonest haven sought is Cuba. 
Now, Fidel Castro has been far from all bad on 
the matter. He has quietly shipped some Amen-
an hijackers hijackers back :through Canada and made life 
go miserable for others that they have tried to de-
part. Cuba's ideological compulsion to remain open 
to political seulmates, however, and the notion still 
afloat that Cuba is about the only place to go, have 
drawn hijackers to Havana nonetheless. The past 
weekend's incident followed by only two weeks the 
flight to Cuba by a group including two Washington 
men linked to a. double murder in an Arlington

jackers.in due time, but the fact Is the problem of

The plain requirement is a known public firm 
guarantee of no haven for criminal hijackers in --
Cuba. There is only one effectiVe way to secure 
such a guarantee and that is for Cuban-American 
political relations to be normalized. Good sense and 
the whole drift of international affairs commends 
.such a development anyway. It becomes increas-
ingly an anachronism in a time of detente for Wash-
ington and Havana to remain at political sword 
points. Hijacking provides what should be the 
clinching argument?a good non-political argument, 
at that. 
From President Nixon, however, comes the stiff, 
stale old diplomacy. He told The Washington Star-
News last week there would be "no change what-
ever" in his Cuban policy "unless and until?and I 
do not anticipate this will happen?Castro changes 
his policy toward Latin America, and the United 
States." Why is Mr. Nixon so hard-nosed? These 
days his administration neither tries to demon-
trate Castro is "exporting revolution" nor contends 
Cuba is lending itself to intol,erable Soviet military 
purposes. Officials pressed to justify the Nixon 
policy are reduced to citing harsh boilerplate rhet-
oric sounded by Castro in such unlikely precincts as 
Bulgaria. President Nixon, as sore reports say,. 
may indeed have it in mind to improve relations 
with Cuba?the Florida vote is in?but evidently he 
wants Fidel to come to him on hands and knees. 
Negotiating, it's called. 
It's an attitude as unworthy of a great nation as 
it is unnecessary for a re-elected Chief Executive. ; 
Mr. Nixon insists he's deeply concerned about both 
promoting detente and eliminating hijacking. But 
here he has the chance to serve the two goals and 
he turns the other way.

QUARRY HEIGHTS, Canal 
Zone ? Granted a respite 
from extinction by President 
Nixon himself, the U.S. South-
ern Command is understanda-
bly sensitive about its unique 
status as the world's most 
top-heavy military organiza-
tion. 
Southeam, as the Army, 
Navy and Air Force area com-
mand is called, has never been 
short of critics, largely be-
cause it is basically a paper 
organization with no less than 
13 flag officers in relation to a 
few thousand troops in the 
Canal Zone and a few hundred 
? officers and men in the mili-
tary advisory groups in 16 Lat-
in countries. 
Critics in the past have 
charged that there were too 
many generals and admirals 
for so insignificant a force; 
that the advisory groups in the 
e various Latin countries served 
very little purpose for their 
?? cost; that nothing was accom-
plished here that could not be 
done as easily and less expen-
sively from the Pentagon. 
? Some new assessments are 
now bring made in view of 
some changes. 
The military groups have 
been reduced from 17 to 16 by 
Ecuador's request for depar-
ture of the U.S. group there, 
and the number of officers and 
men in the groups has been 
pared from about 800 to less' 
the n400. 
Troops more Qualified 
The U.S. armed forces ap-
serve the poor,- nor do they want the 
Government to continue its efforts to 
control distribution for the well-being 
of low-income sectors. While it is un-
doubtedly true that these groups have 
experienced restrictions on consump-
tion and wealth, others have clearly 
benefited. 
The opposition labels restrictions on 
the accumulation of wealth and prop-
erty as attacks on democratic free-
doms. Certainly it has been the Gov-
ernment's aim to undermine the eco-
nomic base of the monied classes, but 
It has respected the fundamental po-
litical right of dissent by legal means. 
In every case of nationalization, 
intervention, or purchase of major in-
terest by the Government in private 
companies, the administration has' 
used only legal means and controls 
authorized by already-existing (al-
though sometimes obscure) laws. 
Chile's central importance today is ' 
that it is the first nation to attempt ? 
a Socialist democracy. This is a test 
of the strengths and limitations of 
democracy as a political framework 
and Socialism as an economic system.. 
_

pear to have improved the 
quality of the in-country per-
sonnel. Four years ago, many 
troops assigned to the groups 
came with little or no knowl-
edge of Spanish or Portuguese, 
and often were picked without 
special qualification. Today, 
all of the personnel mist have 
a language competency of "3" 
on a scale of "5" ? iii other 
words, modest fluency. 
In the 1960s, the groups 
were caught up in the Ken-
nedy administration's policy 
, of democratizing Latin Amer- ? 
ica, a lofty aim they did not 
seem able to achieve. Even 
so, the policy existing tended 
to isolate the group, personnel 
from politically ambitious 
military figures in the host 
countries. 
Military procurement has 
undergone a drastic change 
affecting the groups' role. In 
post-World War II years, all 
of Latin America acquired 
surplus U.S. materiel from 
, uniforms to aircraft, from 
weapons to naval vessels. It 
was automatic and expected. 
Gradually, the United States, 
becoming involved in the 
Vietnam wars took the view 
that the Latins needed only 
security equipmetn because 
they faced no serious external 
threat that the United States 
would not handle for them. 
The United States cut back 
drastically on what planes; 
ships and weapons were 
available for Latins. 
New Sources Found 
The Latins reacted by sim-
ply going shopping elsewhere 
for their hardware. The 
French, Germans, Swedes, 
0 
Dutch and British, 'in ?iarying 
degrees, began flooding Latin 
America with salesmen and 
the Latins began spending 
their money on sophisticated 
Mirage jets, A MX tanks, Ger-
man patrol boats and oven 
reconditioned British aircraft 
carriers. ? 
By 1968, the U.S. advisory 
groups had nothing to sell or 
grant, little influence on the 
Latin officer corps and the 
quality of their intelligence 
function was inferior to that 
available in other embassy of-
fices. 
New Rationale 
Today, the war in Vietnam 
is nearly finished as far as the 
United States is concerned 
and, while there are still close 
restrictions on what Latin ar-
mies can buy, Washington's 
policy is no longer, to try to 
steer, influence and cajole 
Latin capitals. Washington 
takes the more practical view 
that as long as the Latins are 
going to buy arms, they might 
as well get them from the 
United States. 
Given the changed world sit-
uation, differences in U.S. poli-
cy, and the facts of life about 
Latin America today, there 
are those who conclude that 
the small but better-trained 
U.S. military groups be main-
tained as points of contact 
with the Latin military. 
The number of flag officers 
remains high in Panama head-
quarters of Southcom, and 
there are two or three gener-
als stationed in Brazil and Ar-
gentina. Proponents of the 
present structure say the Unit-
79 
cd States needs officers of ' 
general or admiral rank to 
deal with their Latin oppo-
sites, since Southeom ls 
charged not only with defense 
of the Panama Canal but also 
with coordinating U.S. , 
tary activities ? including 
military aid ? throughout, 
Central and South America. 
Critics continue to charge 
that Southcom is a navy with-
out vessels and an army with-
out troops ? a full-fledged 
area command with a brass 
staff just as rank-heavy as the 
other seven regional world4 
wide commands of the De- ; 
fense Department. These flag 
officers are expensive to , 
maintain with their staffs and 
privileges. 
Obviously, critics say, any,: 
major military threat against 
Panama's canal would be 
countered by naval, air,' 
ground or missile forces from 
the United States proper. The 
193d Infantry Brigade here ; 
can protect the canal against 
any local threat, they say, and 
any attack on the canal by a 
world power would mean 
World War III.

On some days the people on the 
sugar plantation called Provi-
dence have nothing to eat, but 
like most farm workers in Bra-
zil's impoverished Northeast, 
they appear resigned to their 
empty live. 
Attempts at modernization 
and industrialization have not 
solved the basic problems of 
the important sugar industry 
but only aggravated the situ-
ation by increasing unemploy-
ment.

the rural workers, who lack de-
cent. housing, clothing, food, 
schools or hope. "If something 
is not done to better their con-
dition, inevitably there will be 
ferment," he has warned. 
The situation of the sugar 
cane workers is worse than it 
was a decade ago because their 
pay has lost more than half its 
purchasing power, according to 
the Rev. AntOnio Melo, one of 
the most vocal advocates of 
agrarian reform in the North-

The Sugar ,and Alcohol Insti-

has embarked on a plan for

R. Parry Scott of the Insti-

at the University of Texas, who 
has been engaged in social re--

highly questionable that the 
present processes of moderni-
zation of the Northeast Brazil-
ian sugar industry will contrib-

near future."
