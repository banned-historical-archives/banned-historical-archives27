 China-Taiwan:
 Strategies for Reunification)                             25X1
 Key Judgments      Beijing, over the past several months, has launched a propaganda campaign
 In!ormation available   highlighting the Hong Kong accord as a model for reunification between
 as q/'15 April 1985     China and Taiwan. We believe this is aimed more at the United States than
 was used in this report.
 Taiwan. Although Chinese leaders do not believe-in our view-that they
 can achieve reunification in the near future, they remain determined to
 erode US support for Taiwan and want to draw Washington into a more
 direct role in promoting negotiations.
 As a result, we expect Beijing to press the United States for support by:
 ? Seeking US endorsement of the "One Country, Two Systems" 'concept as
 it applies to Taiwan.
 ? Devoting increasing effort to lobbying members of Congress and senior
 officials whom it believes may favor a US role in the reunification of China
 and Taiwan.
 ? Demanding US support for the use of the "Taiwan, China" Olympic
 formula in the Asian Development Bank and other international organiza-
 tions, which Taipei now opposes because it implies Taiwan's subordination
 to the mainland.
 ? Continuing to call for more rapid reductions in arms sales to Taiwan.
 ? Eventually pressing Washington to act as a mediator and to exert pressure
 on Taiwan to negotiate.
 To complement this tack, China is offering Taiwan some ostensibly gen-
 erous terms for reunification, including continued Kuomintang control of
 the island and retention of its armed services. Beijing is also attempting to
 build bridges to Taipei through quiet contacts with ethnic Chinese inter-
 mediaries and increased indirect trade. At the same time, Beijing is trying to
 increase Taiwan's international isolation by undermining its ties with West-
 ern Europe, Japan, the Middle East, and Latin America.
 ' First authoritatively articulated by Deng Xiaoping in 1983, the notion of "One Country,
 Two Systems" provides ideological justification for inclusion of the capitalist systems of
 Hong Kong and Taiwan in China's economy. As enshrined in the State Constitution, Taiwan
 and Hong Kong will be permitted to exist as Special Administrative Regions, ostensibly with
 considerable authority to run their own affairs. Deng has kept the notion purposely vague, we
 believe, because it is primarily a device to demonstrate to the United States, overseas
 Chinese, and other influential parties, that China's intentions toward Taiwan and Hong Kong
 are reasonable. The Chinese have never spelled out the length of time that the "One Country,
 Two Systems" formula would remain in effect, for instance, or the precise powers that it
 would confer to the territories subsumed under it.

 Several factors are driving Beijing's Taiwan policy. All of China's senior
 leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, want to complete the Chinese revolution
 and leave the reunification of Taiwan as a part of their legacy. Some
 leaders~elieve that negotiations must at least begin while
 President   sang  hing-kuo and the mainland old guard are still in power
 on Taiwan if China is to have any chance of locking their successors into
 such talks and checking the growth of self-determination sentiment among
 the ethnic Taiwanese majority.                        Chinese
 leaders believe that only President Chiang has the political stature to
 commit the island to such talks.
 Taipei has adamantly rejected Beijing's initiatives and since late February
 1984 has taken a harder line both toward China and China's relations with
 the United States. Taiwan, for instance, has pressed for greater status in
 relations with the United States and has criticized with increasing
 bitterness the growing US-Chinese military relationship. In addition,
 Taiwan has publicly rejected the use of the Olympic formula, ordered its
 overseas missions to insist that Taiwan be called "Republic of China," and
 has chosen to leave international organizations, such as Interpol, rather
 than stay under nomenclature crafted by Beijing.
 We believe these policies reflect the growing influence of President
 Chiang's conservative advisers, especially Premier Yu Kuo-hua and Secre-
 tary General of the Presidential Office Shen Chang-huan. Shen, who now
 exercises a dominant influence over foreign policy, and other conservatives
 are increasingly concerned by the growing US-Chinese relationship,
 China's takeover of Hong Kong in 1997, China's growing economic and
 political ties with South Korea and Singapore-two of Taiwan's closest
 allies in East Asia-and other trends they regard as inimical to Taiwan's
 long-term interests.
 Taiwan's admitted involvement in the murder of Henry Liu last October
 has placed Taiwan officials on the defensive for now. We expect Taiwan,
 however, to renew intensive lobbying efforts in Washington to secure
 greater status, increased arms sales-including a fighter aircraft-and to
 scuttle any US arms sales to China when the furor dies down.

 China-Taiwan:
 Strategies for Reunification
 Beging's Taiwan Policy
 Beijing's primary goal-articulated by the National
 People's Congress Standing Committee in 1979 and
 in other leadership statements since then-is to draw
 Taiwan into talks leading to a reunification agree-
 ment. Although the Chinese leadership has set this as
 a major goal for the 1980s, we believe it harbors no
 illusions about achieving a breakthrough soon. In the
 interim, Beijing will keep pressure on Taipei by
 sporadically reiterating and refining its proposals, by
 emphasizing the inevitability of reunification, and by
 campaigning to win the sympathies of the United
 States and of other influential parties, such as over-
 seas Chinese.
 A secondary, tactical goal is the creation of a growing
 web of political, economic, and cultural ties between
 China and Taiwan designed to break down the barri-
 ers Taipei has erected to a dialogue. The Chinese thus
 seek to build bridges to Taiwan through offers of
 mutual participation in international organizations
 and increased indirect trade. A corollary of this
 approach is Beijing's interest in creating the impres-
 sion in the United States and elsewhere that the
 Kuomintang (KMT) is the only major impediment to
 the reunification that Chinese on both sides of the
 strait desire.
 Paradoxically, Chinese leaders also want to ensure
 that Taiwan remains stable under the control of their
 old nemesis, the mainlander-dominated KMT, in part
 because the KMT shares with China a common belief
 in "One China." Indeed, we believe Beijing does not
 want to do anything that might strengthen the hand
 of Taiwanese forces favoring independence for the
 island. Chinese threats from time to time to use force
 to reunify the mainland and Taiwan probabl  are
 intended in part to intimidate such groups.
 Factors Shaping Beijing's Taiwan Policy. In devising
 a policy toward Taiwan, we believe Chinese leaders
 must balance a number of conflicting interests and
 concerns. They have long recognized, for example,
 that there is no quick solution and that they are
 constrained from pursuing reunification more aggres-
 sively because of their need for good relations with the
 United States and its allies-both as a strategic
 counterweight to the Soviet Union and to obtain help
 for China's modernization drive. As a part of the price
 for closer ties, Deng and other Chinese leaders have
 repeatedly indicated they favor settling the problem
 by peaceful means.
 The Chinese, however, are unlikely to forswear the
 use of force completely. We believe Deng now and
 then will continue to raise that possibility to remind
 both Washington and Taipei that China's patience
 has limits. Indeed, there are, in our judgment, several
 factors driving Beijing to search for a way to induce
 Taiwan to begin negotiations over the next few years.
 For example, all of China's senior leaders, Deng
 included, want to complete the Chinese revolution and
 leave the reintegration of Taiwan as a part of their
 legacy. Some of them     liege     25X1
 that time is running out for reaching that goal
 peacefully           these         25X1
 leaders are concerned about the influence of Taiwan
 independence groups operating in the United States,
 and believe a dialogue with Taipei must begin while
 President Chiang Ching-kuo is still alive if Beijing is
 to have any hope of locking his successors into such   25X1
 negotiations. Otherwise, we believe, they fear that the
 next generation of Taiwan leaders might push for self-
 determination-with US support. Beijing's sharp re-
 action to the Pell Resolution endorsing self-determi-
 nation for Taiwan, which the US Senate Foreign
 Relations Committee passed in late 1983, reflects this
 concer
 Taiwan, moreover, could become a fractious domestic
 issue. Deng and his allies, therefore, want to create
 the illusion of making progress toward reunification.   25X1

 Beijing's Proposal
 China put forward its basic reunification proposal in
 a message to Taiwan from the Standing Committee
 of the National People's Congress in 1979 and slight-
 ly amplified it in Ye Jianying s nine points of 1981.
 Since then, Deng Xiaoping has sought to appear
 increasingly generous, announcing new elements in
 discussions withloreign visitors that culminated in
 his "One Country, Two Systems"formula in 1983.
 ? A national political role for senior KMT leaders.
 The Chinese have stated that Taiwan's President
 Chiang Ching-kuo would be given a senior position
 in Beijing, perhaps that of State Vice President or a
 Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress.
 ? Retention of Taiwan's army and intelligence ser-
 vices. Deng promised that Taiwan would be able to
 purchase weapons from abroad, but only if they
 were not used to threaten the mainland.
 Based on its earlier decision to acknowledge the
 Kuomintang (KMTJ as de facto ruler of Taiwan,
 Beijing s proposals are aimed primarily at the main-
 lander leadership of the KMT-although they offer
 incentives to ethnic Taiwanese as well. In exchange
 for Taiwan's recognition of its claim to sovereignty,
 the Chinese propose:
 ? Political autonomy for Taiwan. Like Hong Kong,
 Taiwan would be administered as a Special Admin-
 istrative Zone, per Article 31 of the new State
 Constitution. Beijing has pledged that the KMT
 could continue to govern the island, and that it
 would not station o.Bicials or troops there. The
 KMT could also retain control of Taiwan's judicial
 system, with the highest court of appeal remaining
 in Taipei.
 issue that critics, such as Politburo Standing Commit-
 tee member Chen Yun or National People's Congress
 Standing Committee Chairman Peng Zhen, could use
 to weaken their authority and undermine their domes-
 tic reform program.
 BeUing's Policy in Practice
 At present, Chinese leaders are trying to capitalize on
 the Hong Kong accord to promote their reunification
 campaign. In his National Day speech last October,
 Deng drew particular attention to the similarities
 between the Hong Kong settlement and China's pro-
 posals for Taiwan. Moreover, Chinese officials in
 Hong Kong have publicly stated that China will try to
 use Taiwan's extensive financial and economic links
 with Hong Kong to draw it into China's economic and
 political sphere.
 ? Protection of foreign investment. China pledged to
 protect the sanctity of foreign investment now in
 Taiwan and to permit additional investment. China
 offered subsidies for Taiwan should Taiwan require
 them.
 ? Taiwanese investment in the mainland. Beijing has
 used the lure of investment profits to appeal to
 Taiwan's ethnic Taiwanese middle class, much as it
 encouraged Hong Kong businessmen to invest in
 Chinese enterprises
 To build confidence in Beijing's promises-especially
 in the United States-Chinese leaders are publicly
 offering to hold discussions with Taiwan on an equal,
 party-to-party basis. In addition, they are trying to
 convince Taiwan's leadership-and to a lesser extent
 the predominantly ethnic-Taiwanese middle class on
 Taiwan-that China is stable, that its policies enjoy a
 broad and enduring base of support, and that these
 policies will in time lead to a convergence of the
 mainland's and island's economic systems

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940021-6
 Beijing also is stressing the common political heritage
 of the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party,
 including two previous periods of cooperation. China
 now:
 ? Extols KMT founder Sun Yatsen's contribution to
 the CCP and the KMT and celebrates the anniver-
 sary of the KMT's founding congress.
 ? Gives wide publicity to the election of ethnic Tai-
 wanese to the National People's Congress and the
 revival of "democratic" organizations of former
 KMT officials, such as the Revolutionary Commit-
 tee of the KMT.
 ? Appeals to the filial concerns of President Chiang
 and other Taiwan leaders by refurbishing the
 Chiang family's ancestral home in Zhejiang Prov-
 ince and inviting Chiang to bury his father's ashes
 there.
 China, moreover, seeks to capitalize on the close
 proximity of Fujian Province and the ethnic similarity
 of Fujian's coastal people to Taiwan's indigenous
 population. Fujian publicly welcomes and provides
 shelter for shipwrecked Taiwan fishermen, offers
 preferential investment to Taiwanese businessmen in
 its Xiamen Special Economic Zone, and often serves
 as Beijing's point of contact with Taiwan. To further
 these measures, Fujian has set up a "Taiwan Work
 Office" to build economic ties with Taiwan
 figures are not yet available, two-way trade increased

 25X1
 25X1
 China also is using indirect-and, to a lesser extent,
 direct-trade with Taiwan to break down existing
 barriers and make contact with the ethnic Taiwanese
 middle class. Indirect Chinese exports-almost all
 traditional herbal medicines, teas, or foodstuffs-have
 increased steadily since trade began in 1978 and
 probably exceeded $100 million last year but are still
 less than a half percent of China's total exports.
 China indirectly imports more from Taiwan, but this
 trade has fluctuated markedly for economic reasons.
 It reached a high of $383 million in 1981 but dropped
 to $170 million in 1983 and climbed to $141 million
 by the middle of last year. And, although reliable

 of overall indirect trade through Hong Kong, however. Direct trade   25X1
 is conducted both through Taiwan vessels calling at the Fujian
 ports of Quanzhou and Hui'an and by smugglers in the offshore
 islands. In addition                          Taiwan
 sanctions the purchase of special items for the presidential office
 and others through a procurement office in Hong Kong and the

 Isolating Taiwan. Meanwhile, China continues to try
 to strip the Taipei government of its last vestiges of
 international legitimacy. Although it has allowed
 Taiwan, for example, to rejoin some international
 organizations by using the Olympic formula,' it has
 done so mainly to relegate Taiwan to the status of a
 provincial entity subordinate to Beijing. In the case of
 the Asian Development Bank, for instance, while the
 issue is still under debate in Beijing, China is now
 insisting it will join only if Taiwan accepts Beijing's
 nomenclature and a subordinate place in Beijing's
 voting group
 Beijing also attempts to demonstrate Taipei's subordi-
 nate position in international sporting events. Since
 1983, Beijing has increasingly pressed for Taipei to
 participate without its national flag or its anthem and
 to march behind Beijing.
 Beijing  as a so propose
 changes in the Olympic formula that would lay
 greater emphasis on Taiwan's status as a province of
 China.
 Beijing is continuing its campaign to undermine
 Taiwan's ties with the few countries that still have
 diplomatic relations. In Latin America, for instance,
 Beijing has offered trade incentives to some countries
 to break ties with Taiwan. In Western Europe, China
 is trying to use its growing economic leverage to
 undermine Taiwan's ties. Over the past two years, for
 example, Chinese leaders have paid several visits to
 European countries that have strong economic ties
 with Taiwan and held out the prospect of significant
 trade deals. The prospect of expanding trade ties with
 China was instrumental in the Netherlands' decision
 last year not to sell additional submarines to Taiwan.
 The Perspective From Taipei
 After overcoming the shock of US-Chinese normal-
 ization in 1979, Taipei began to exude a renewed
 sense of self-confidence-the result of its success in
 developing an extensive web of international relation-
 ships, albeit on an unofficial basis. It has been
 'The Olympic formula, agreed to by China and Taiwan under the
 auspices of the International Olympic Committee in 1979, stipu-
 lates that Taiwan may participate in the Olympics under the
 banner "Chinese, Taipei" and may not Hy its own flag or play its
 national anthem. Taipei is also permitted to have a national
 Olympic committee but under the "Chinese, Taipei" rubric.
 particularly successful in expanding economic ties
 with Western Europe, East Asia, and the Middle
 East, using the lure of investment and trade-even
 when Taiwan sustains a loss
 This self-confidence was reflected for a time in 1982
 and 1983 in Taipei's adoption of a more flexible
 attitude toward overtures from the mainland. Taipei
 allowed its citizens to travel to China if they did so
 quietly and accepted in practice Beijing's proposals
 for reducing tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Some very
 senior Taiwan officials, includin  President Chiang,
 even began to hint in public   that reunifi-   25X1
 cation might be possible at some point.

 25X1
 Over the past year, however, Taiwan has reverted to a
 more rigid posture, recently reiterating its policy of
 "no contact, no negotiations" and rejecting Deng's
 "One Country, Two Systems" proposal.? We believe
 several factors explain this shift. Probably the most
 critical is the growing influence of President Chiang's
 more conservative advisers since Premier Sun-a
 leading proponent of the more flexible policy-suf-
 fered adisabling stroke in February 1984. He has
 been replaced by the conservative Yu Kuo-hua. More
 important, former Foreign Minister Shen Chang-
 huan has assumed the influential post of Secretary
 General of the Presidential Office. We believe Shen, a
 strong advocate of Taiwan insisting on official status
 in international organizations and in dealings with the
 United States, now exercises a dominant influence
 over foreign policy
 ' Taiwan believes)                       (that China's
 "One Country, Two Systems" proposal is not in fact a serious
 attempt on the part of the Chinese to approach Taiwan over
 reunification. Taipei recognizes-as does Beijing in our view-that
 entering into talks with China would in itself amount to tacit
 acquiescence to reunification on Beijing's terms. Further, Taipei
 believes that accepting the offer of talks would be widely viewed in
 Taiwan as a sellout of the ethnic Taiwanese majority and could
 provoke a severe reaction against the government. A proposal that
 Taipei would consider to be serious would, in Taipei's view, be

 Shen and other conservatives-in our view-are in-
 creasingly disturbed by trends they believe threaten
 Taiwan's vital political and economic interests. They
 fear that if China's economic reforms succeed, China
 will become a much more formidable political oppo-
 nent and serious economic rival for overseas markets.
 They are also concerned that China's takeover of
 Hong Kong in 1997 will give Beijing greater leverage
 over Taipei. Taiwan now relies heavily on,Hon~Kon~
 as a banking and communications center.
 Of more immediate concern, we believe, are the
 growing economic and political ties in East Asia
 between China and some of Taiwan's oldest and
 closest allies, such as South Korea and Singapore.
 Taipei implicitly accused Seoul of currying favor with
 Beijing when South Korea recently returned aChi-
 nese torpedo boat and its crew to China. And Premier
 Lee Kuan Yew clearly indicated to Taiwan leaders
 recently that Singapore's ties with China will be
 increasingly close
 But most disturbing to the conservatives, in our
 judgment, is the warming in US-Chinese relations
 and, especially, developing US-Chinese military ties.
 Indeed, the shift to a tougher line coincided with the
 US-Chinese arms talks in Washington in late Febru-
 ary. The Foreign Minister and other senior Taiwan
 officials have recently been sharply critical of US
 willingness to sell arms to China.
 The growing influence of the conservatives is evident
 in several policy areas. Taiwan, for example, has
 publicly rejected the Olympic formula as the basis for
 its future participation not only in international sport-
 ing events but in other international activities as well.
 Last spring, for example, the Taiwan team walked out
 of the Eighth Asian Youth Basketball Championship
 hosted by Seoul when it was given a choice of playing
 as "Chinese, Taipei" or withdrawing. Last Septem-
 ber, Taiwan authorities ordered their overseas mis-
 sions to insist that Taiwan be referred to as the
 "Republic of China." Since then, Taipei has rejected
 Chinese offers to allow Taiwan to remain in interna-
 tional bodies, such as Interpol an                     elop-
 ment Bank, as "Taiwan, China."
 Finally, according to Taiwan's official news service,
 Premier Yu called last June for an end to visits to
 China by Taiwan citizens and threatened not to issue
 future exit visas to those who had already gone there.
 Taiwan also announced an end to the unoffical ex-   25X1
 change of mail last summer, although it still allows
 some tightly controlled government-monitored corre-
 spondence between Taiwan and China.
 The abrupt ouster this February of KMT Secretary
 General Chiang Yen-shih, a moderate, is another sign
 of the conservatives' growing influence. His replace-
 ment by the conservative Ma Shu-li is certain to
 strengthen their control over both foreign policy and   25X1
 domestic affairs.                                       25X1
 Implications for the United States
 The United States is central to Taiwan's continued
 security and to its economic viability. Taiwan depends
 heavily on the United States for sophisticated arms
 and, in our view, will continue to do so for many
 years. It has not yet developed a sophisticated indige-
 nous arms production capability and has seen its ties
 with Israel, Western Europe, and other suppliers
 diminish. Similarly, the United States effectively
 underwrites Taiwan's current rapid pace of exports
 through its nearly $10 billion trade deficit and acts as
 a lender of last resort for Taiwan in the absence of
 IMF and other economic safeguards.

 Beijing's recent decision to make public Deng's secret
 overture to  Washington for help in resolving the
 Taiwan problem may foreshadow a significant shift in
 Chinese policy, in our view. If so, we believe the
 Chinese will increasingly press the United States to
 become more directly and actively involved in broker-
 ing aresolution to the problem. Initially, Beijing may
 only urge the United States to endorse Deng's "One
 Country, Two Systems" formula as a fair basis for
 negotiations. But ultimately we think Beijing wants
 Washington to act as a mediator to overcome
 Taiwan's refusal to negotiate. In the past, the Chinese
 have insisted the problem be left to China and Taiwan
 to work out on their own. Washington was urged only
 to do nothing that would encourage Taiwan's intransi-
 gence.
 We do not believe, however, that Beijing will revert to
 its confrontational, badgering tactics-unless it per-
 ceives the United States is seriously violating its
 commitments to a "One China" policy and the gradu-
 al reduction of US arms sales to Taiwan. Beijing
 seems to recognize it has little leverage with Washing-
 ton on this matter at present, although we believe the
 Chinese are actively watching for the emergence of
 senior US officials who want the United States to play
 a role in reunification. Moreover, we believe the
 Chinese do not want the Taiwan issue to impede their
 growing economic and military relations with Wash-
 ington. Indeed, they may be counting on the develop-
 ment of those ties over the longer run to help them
 erode support for Taiwan in Washington.
 Instead, the Chinese are likely, in our judgment, to
 devote increasing attention to cultivating members of
 the US Congress and other influential US groups that
 they believe can help them influence American policy
 toward Asia. At the same time, they will continue
 periodically to remind Washington that the Taiwan
 problem remains an "obstacle" to better relations and
 to look for opportunities to drive a wedge between
 Washington and Taipei. Recent Chinese efforts to
 enlist US support for their position on the question of
 Taiwan's continued membership in the Asian Devel-
 opment Bank is a good example
 The exposure of the involvement of some of Taiwan's
 most senior intelligence officials in the murder of
 Henry Liu, a US citizen, last October, however, has   25X1
 again put Taipei on the defensive. Indeed, Taiwan
 officials probably will be preoccupied with limiting
 the damage to US-Taiwan relations for some time.~25X1
 We doubt, however, that President Chiang and his
 conservative advisers have given up on obtaining
 greater unofficial status
 the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is
 planning to cut staff positions in the Coordination
 Council for North American Affairs (CCNAA) and
 may let the CCNAA Secretary General slot fall
 vacant next year to force US diplomats to deal more
 directly with the Foreign Ministry-hence lending it
 greater status
 As the publicity over the Henry Liu murder begins to
 fade, moreover, we expect Taipei to begin to press
 once more for some of the symbols of greater unoffi-
 cial status in Washington. In the meantime, we
 believe Taipei will use its influence to try to block
 arms sales to China, such as the F-8 avionics package,
 when it believes it can make a strong case aeainst
 them as threatening Taiwan's security.
