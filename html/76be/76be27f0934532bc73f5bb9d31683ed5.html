 EUROPEAN  SECURITY  CONFERENCE
 MOSCOW HAILS "CHARTER FOR PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE" IN EUROPE
 Building up to the Helsinki finale of the Conference on Securit.}
 and Cooperation in Eurcpe (CSCE), Moscow has hailed the "historl.c."
 event as the culmination of long efforts to achieve general
 recognition of postwar realities In Europe.  Soviet commentators
 have described the conference's final document, to be signed by
 the leaders of the 35 parti:ipating states on 1 August, as a
 "charter for peaceful coexistence" between East and West Eurc,e
 and an example for other areas of the world to follow.  IZVESTIYA's
 first deputy chief editor and West European expert, Nikolay
 Polyanov, even went so far as to call the final document the "ten
 commandments" for peaceful cooperation between East and West.
 While Moscow has taken issue with opponents of the conferer...e--
 whether American, West European, or Chinese--it has consistently
 argued that the results of the conference are a "success"' for all
 and are not "one-sided" in favor of the Soviet Union at t.Ke expense
 of the West.   Typifying this approach., TASS General Direr:-or
 L. Zamyatin, on the 25 July Moscow radio "International '41tuation"
 program, refuted Western "propaganda1? charges that the co-ference
 was "advantageous only to the Soviet Union."   (Zamyatin,, who has
 acted as Brezhnev's spokesman at recent summit meetings, is in
 Helsinki with the Brezhnev delegation.)  Moscow has also credited
 "realistic-minded" leaders in the West for their role in convening
 the conference, achieving "successful" results, and agtee.ing to
 sign the final document at summit level, thus ending the postwar
 era and acknowledging the opening of a new "multilateral" phase
 in European diplomacy and cooperation.   In this context, other
 than to point out routinely that Europe must now mcve from
 political detente to military detente, Moscow comment has avoided
 any detailed discussion of the Vienna force reductions negotiations
 since their 17 July recess, or any linkage of the MBFR talks to
 the Helsinki summit.*
 Soviet commentators have made some show of regarding all parts of
 the final documents an of equal importance, whether the ten
 political-security principles, the measures on military maneuvers,
 or the passages on economic and humanitarian cooperation.   But
 Moscow has clearly placed primary emphasis on recognition of
 territorial status, as reflected in the Soviet interpretation of

 issue of the TRENDS.

 the principle of "inviolability" of present-day European borders.
 The document's passage allowing for change of borders by
 "peaceful means and by agreement" under international law has been
 passed over in silence by Moscow, and Soviet observers have
 particularly singled out for attack the West German CDU/CSU
 opposition, for its near-unanimous failure to endorse the results
 of the conference because of anxiety over the "German question."
 Moscow radio German specialist V. Zakharov, for example, remarked
 derisively on 26 July that the CDU/CSU leaders "have no partner
 in Europe except Albania."
 As for the results on the Basket III issues of humanitarian
 cooperation and contacts, Moscow commentators have blandly claimed
 that the formulations in the final document were mutually agreed
 upon and iculd "open opportunities for large-scale cooperation in
 the humanitarian field," as PRAVDA special correspondents
 Ye. Grigoryev and I. Melr.ilkt: put it on the 23d.  However, their
 article reflected Moscow's strong concern over the full impact of
 the document in this area of East-West cooperation when it
 observed that this cooperation would respect the individual
 states' "internal" order and sovereignty.
 EAST EUROPE LAUDS SUMMIT; CZECH MEDIA FORESEE IMPACT ON MBFR
 The most noteworthy East European comment on the conclusion of the
 European security conference thus far is the suggestion by
 Czechoslovak media that this might lead to an eventual break-
 through at the Vienna force reduction talks.   Other bloc comment
 has been confined mainly to reviewing the lengthy nego:.iations
 and to predicting that the signing of the final document would
 contribute to improved East-West relations on the basis of
 "peaceful coexistence."  Maverick Romania and independent
 Yugoslavia, stressing their own respective roles in CSCE
 negotiations, have also greeted it as a significant--though
 limited--success.  Albania, the only European country to bcycott
 the conference, criticized it along standard lines in a lengthy
 29 July ZERI I POPULLIT editorial which claimed that the final
 document merely recognized the fact that the continent is
 already divided into U.S. and Soviet "spheres of influence."
 CZECHOSLOVAK      The suggestion that the conclusion of the
 COMMENT ON MBFR   conference may improve the prospects for MBFR
 was raised in an article titled "What Next in
 European Politics" under the byline "DR" in the 24 July LIDOVA
 DEMOKRACIE, the daily of Czechoslovakia's minor People's Party.
 The following day the authoritative party daily RUDE PRAVO, in
 an article by Jiri Martin, also noted a link between the talks

 but provided a more restrained assessment of the prospects for
 MBFR.  Martin asserted that "although the Vienna talks do not
 depend on CSCE, they have one common denominator:       political
 detente in Europe, which has scored a great success in Helsinki."
 More optimistically, the LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE article, which provided
 the most sanguine bloc comment on MBFR since the 17 July recess,
 cited "unofficial conversations" to the effect that CSCE would
 have a "positive influence" on the arms reduction talks.  Further
 noting the "prevailing positive atmosphere" in European politics,
 the article asserted that MBFR was "expected" to assume primary
 importance following the Helsinki summit.  In particular, the
 article credited improved MBFR prospects to CSCE agreements on
 confidence-building measures and on the freer flow of information.
 And in a show of impartiality highly unusual for an East European
 newspaper, the article went on to assert that "we can note a
 certain modification of attitudes on both sides."
 Although hopeful on the future of the MBFR talks, the LIDOVA
 DEMOKRACIE article acknowledged that there was no longer "hope"
 for a reduction of Soviet and U.S. forces in 1975.   On other
 technical aspects of the talks, it echoed the speculation of other
 East European sources that the NATO states would finally introduce
 their "nuclear option" when the negotiations resume in September.
 It also noted in this connection that "certain new factors" had
 appeared in the U.S. "concept of nuclear war" and that tactical
 nuclear weapons were not covered in the SALT negotiations.
 OTHER BLOC MEDIA      There have been no hints in East European
 comment of the earlier acrimonious divisions
 between East and West over the issues of freer exchange of people
 and information in negotiations on Basket III.  The GDR's Guenter
 Leuschner in a 16 July Berlin radio commentary said that Basket III
 would serve to gage whether the West would continue to pursue
 cold war policies or act with a "feeling of responsibility."  This
 was atypical, however, as most East European comment has ignored
 the issue, concentrating instead on the ten principles of security
 in Europe.
 While bloc media have uniformly stressed the contribution of the
 bloc countries, and particularly of Moscow, to the successful
 conclusion of CSCE, they have also praised the role of the
 Western states.  For example, the Hungarian party daily
 NEPSZABADSAG on the 15th and the CDR party daily NEUES
 DEUTSCHLAND on the 22d respective),! hailed the "statesmanlike
 wisdom" and "realistic" attitudes of Western governments and
 leaders.  The United States was specifically singled out by
 Poland, reflecting the regime's warm reception for President Ford's

 28-29 July visit.  The nonparty daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY on the 2.2d
 praised the contributions of President Ford, Secretary Kissinger
 and the U.S. delegation; and party chief Gierek, in a toast
 addressed to the President on the 28th, expressed "full apprecia-
 tion" of the U.S. contribution to the talks.
 ROMANIA, YUGOSLAVIA     Bucharest and Belgrade both emphasized
 their respective successes in having
 nonbloc principles incorporated into the final conference
 d..Dcument.  Romanian CSCE delegate Lipatti, in a 17 July AGERPRES
 interview, voiced particular satisfaction that the final document
 had reflected repeated Romanian demands for follow-up machinery to
 assess compliance with the final document's provisions.  Lipatti,
 as well as Romanian Foreign Minister Manescu in an interview
 published in the 29 July Paris LE FIGARO, also stressed the
 importance of the conference provisions for greater cultural
 exchanges and human contacts.  Party chief Ceausescu clearly
 detailed Bucharest's overall assessment in an 11 July toast for
 visiting Austrian Chancellor Kreisky,and on several occasions
 since then, in welcoming the concluding session as a "positive
 influence" but stressing that European security would not be
 achieved until the blocs are dissolved, bases and troops are
 removed from foreign territories, and military disarmament occurs.
 Belgrade, like Bucharest, has stressed the role of the smaller
 neutral and nonalined states in achieving a final document
 reflecting compromise and "democratic" positions rather than the
 exclusive interests of the two blocs.  Although the Yugoslav
 Federal Assembly on 18 July endorsed the final session as
 "contributing to a new climate of relations," Foreign Minister
 Minic's parliamentary remarks pointed up Belgrade's measured
 satisfaction in noting that Yugoslav proposals had been incorporated
 throughout the final document, "though not always to the extent
 we would have wished."  Restraint was also reflected in a 25 July
 commentary in the weekly paper NIN, which noted that the conclusion
 of the conference would not, in fact, alter the existing situation
 in which Europe remains divided into heavily armed opposing blocs.

 PEKING HAILS ,?ORI)`S RESOLVE :N U.S. INTERESTS IN EUROPE
 A 27 July NCNA report has noted approvingly remarks by President
 Ford on 25 July prior to his departure for the Helsinki CSCE
 meeting as evidence supporting Peking's view that the meeting
 signals the start of a "new round" of U.S.-Soviet tension.   The
 report, Peking's first dispatch pegged to the President's current
 European tour, hailed his denial of recent charges in the United
 States that his participation in the Helsinki summit was tanta-
 mount to acknowledging Soviet domination in Eastern Europe.
 NCNA subsequently reported briefly on 28 July on the President's
 26-28 July stay in West Germany and visit with U.S. troops there,
 highlighting his statements emphasizing the continuing strong
 U.S. commitment to West Europe's strategic defense.
 The lengthy first report on the 27th claimed that the United
 States intended to use the CSCE framework for "penetrating into
 the Soviet Union and undermining its foundation in East Europe."
 It cited President Ford's statement that the CSCE documents are
 not legally binding, that the United States will not grant tacit
 recognition to Soviet control in East Europe, and that Washington
 intends to put great stress on CSCE provisions calling for free
 exchange of ideas and people and for the possible peaceful
 changing of existing European national borders.
 NCNA reported that the President voiced support for "the aspirations
 for freedom and national independence of the peoples of East
 Europe," pointedly mentioning in the next sentence that the
 President was to visit Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia on his
 current tour.   The report also noted that the President "declared"
 that "the United States has never recognized the Soviet incorpora-
 tion of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and is not doing so now."
 (According to U.S. press reports, President Ford in delivering his
 oral departure statement dropped the passage in his advance text
 given to newsmen referring to the three Baltic states, and
 omitted the advL:nce text's specific reference to support for
 aspirations  for freedom in "East Europe," saying instead that the
 United States supports such aspirations "everywhere.")
 Peking predictably played up President Ford's stated resolve to
 maintain NATO solidarity and allied positions on Berlin and
 Germany, and the report underlined its treatment of the U.S.
 competition with Moscow by reporting also on press conference
 remarks by Secretary Kissinger on 25 July complaining of Soviet
 policy in the SALT and MBFR talks and in Portugal.
 Peking's treatment of U.S. intentions is consistent with its
 recent propaganda line that the superpower rivalry in Europe has

 reached a "new stage," despite outward signs of East-West relaxa-
 tion, as the United States has pulled back from overextended
 positions in Asia following its setbacks in Indochina and shifted
 to contend more forcefully against recent Soviet inroads in
 Europe.  Peking's coverage of the Ford trip thus far recalls its
 unusually favorable and extensive treatment of the President's
 trip to West Europe to attend the May 1975 NATO summit.  In the
 past, Chinese treatment of a U.S. Presidential visit abroad had
 usually been confined to a single NCNA dispatch covering the
 entire itinerary of the trip, which was released following the
 president's return to Washington.*

 POLAND WARMLY HAILS FORD VISIT, STRESSES SOVIET TIES
 Polish media have hailed President Ford's 28-29 July visit to
 Warsaw as a tribute both to Poland and to the good relations
 between the United States and the Soviet Union brought about by
 detente.  Both the leaders' speeches and Polish media comment
 have pointed out that the visit was sandwiched between the
 U.S.-Soviet joint space venture, on the one hand, and the
 Helsinki summit of the CSCE on the other.  A. similar stress on
 the linkage between U.S.-Soviet relations and U.S.-Pclish
 relations was made during former President Nixon's visit to
 Warsaw in 1972, which came right after the first Nixon-Brezhnev
 summit.  Protocol on both occasions similarly reflected Polish
 deference to Moscow.   In 1972, Nixon rated a formal but stiff
 reception by state leaders Jablonski and Jaroszewicz; this time
 Ford got the more personal style of greeting favored by Brezhnev,
 with party chief Gierek doing many of the honors.
 Predictably, the comment has stressed the historical ties
 between Poland and the United States.  There have becn many
 references to the great number of American citizens of Polish
 ancestry, to the Polish contribution to U.S. independence and to
 U.S. participation in World War II.  Gierek, in his 28 July
 toast, characterized U.S.-Polish relations as "favorable" and
 undergoing "dynamic growth," wnile Jaroszewicz, in a toast thr.
 following day, portrayed them as "broader and richer as well as
 friendlier and warmer today than at any time in the past."
 Particular stress was placed on Giere:ti's October 1974 visit to the
 United States, whh government spokesman Janiurek described on
 the 27th as opening up a "qualitatively new stage" of relations.
 Th"se positive appraisals of relations with the United States
 were complemented by reaffirmations of Warsaw's close ties to
 Moscow.   In discussing Poland's postwar development, for example,
 Gi,irek on the 28th paid recognition to the assistance of "our
 unfailing friends, above all the Soviet Union."  And Jaroszewicz
 on the following day  underscored the importance of U.S.-Soviet
 relations to U.S.-Polish relations, asserting that Poland, "a:_
 a close ally of the Soviet Union, linked by relations of friendship
 and fraternity, firmly supports the Soviet-U.S. dialog and
 cooperation.  .  .  ."  Emphasizing the point in the 25 July ZYCIE
 WARSZAWY, Adam Wysocki stressed that the improvement in U.S.-Polish
 economic relations could not have taken place without detente.

 Both before and during the visit President Ford was repeatedly
 praised for his "personal" and "consistent" contribution to
 detente.  In addition, the Polish leaders and media comment often
 cited Secretary Kissinger's foreign policy role.  The centerpiece
 of the favorable publicity was an article by Grzegorz Jaszunski
 in the 22 July ZYCIE WARSZAWY, which provided an unqualifiedly
 positive appraisal of the Ford Administration's foreign policy
 and portrayed in glowing terms President Ford's prospects for
 reelection.  In particular, the President was praised for issuing
 an early invitation to Gierek to visit the United States, for
 his role in bringing about the Vladi-7ostok arms agreement, and
 for accepting the "inevitable" communist victories in Indochina.

 S I NO-SU v' I ET  RELATIONS
 MOSCOW OBS'RVERS SEE LIMITS ON SINO-U,S. COLLABORATION
 Political observer Aleksandr Bovin assured viewers of an 18 July
 Moscow TV roundtable program that China's ability to upset
 detente was "fairly limited," adding that "realistic" politicians
 in the West understand this.  Answering a viewer who asked if
 true detente was possible when "such a large state as China does
 not support this policy," Bovin discounted China's disruptive
 potential on the ground that Peking had no viable alternative to
 offer.  He acknowledged, however, that Peking represented a
 serious destabilizing factor" in the international situation and
 that "some people in the West" would like to take advantage of
 that.   Similarly, recent articles in Soviet academic journals have
 argued tnat Washington's current foreign policy operates on the
 assumption that Peking's continuing dispute with Moscow can be
 exploited for U.S. advantage.
 Efforts by Soviet commentators to dowagrade China's diplomatic and
 military potential have developed as Moscow has found it necessary
 to disabuse internal critics who saw rapprochement between the
 United States and China as a potential threat to Soviet.detente
 policy.   In a television program last January, PRAVDA's senior
 commentator Yuriy Zhukov had defended the Vladivostok SALT
 accord against those who were worried about the :limitations in the
 face of unrestrained Chinese capability, particularly given the
 possibility of U.S. military assistance to Peking.   Znukov
 reassured his listeners that the danger in such a course was
 appreciated "on the other side of the ocean," if only due to
 the uncertain internal situation in China.
 Despite such reassurances by Bovin and Zhukov on television--where
 sensitive issues on occasion are treated more fr,)-ikly than in the
 printed media--Soviet media in general have devoted increasing
 attention to Peking's emerging alinement with the "most reactionary
 elements" in the West, in an attempt to discredit: China's
 revolutionary credentials,  Moreover, analyses of U.S. foreign
 policy by Soviet scholars have betrayed concern In Moscow over
 Sino-U.S. contacts by observing that Washington counts on a
 certain amount of continuing Sino-Soviet tension to facilitate
 its "triangular diplomacy."   A review of A. Dock Barnett's recent
 book on China, Uncertain Passage, in the latest issue of the
 Soviet journal PROBLEMS OF THE FAR EAST (No. 2,  L975), noted that
 the author, "reflecting the views of influential circles in the
 United States, welcomed an easing of Sinn-Soviet tension but was
 negative toward the renewal of Soviet-Chinese friendship on a

 broad scale."  In the February issue of USA, Boris Zanegin, a
 member of the Institute of the USA and Canada, had concluded that
 Peking's alleged obstructionism in the Sino-Soviet border talks
 "suits those forces in the United States which see the PRC as a
 component of the 'balance of powrir,' in other words as an object
 of foreign policy manipulation."
 PEKING DERIDES MOSCOW OVER U,S,-USSR SPACE FLIGHT
 Peking's sole comment on the recent U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz space
 flight, a 25 July NCNA article, has criticized Moscow's "all-out
 propa; inda"over the venture, alleging that Brezhnev desperately
 needs such outward demonstrations of detente in order to continue
 to deceive the world's peoples and shore up his sagging political
 fortunes at home.
 The NCNA article claimed that Brezhnev's detente efforts are full
 of "holes" through which people see more clearly the "danger of
 Soviet revisionist social imperialist expansion."  The article
 also made a rare Chinese reference to "contradictions within the
 Soviet revisionist ruling clique," claiming that Brezhnev put
 great personal stress on detente displays like the space flight
 in order to "look good" prior to the anticipated Soviet 25th
 Party Congress, to "preserve his rule" which has allegedly come
 under a cloud because of recent "snags" in East-Test relations,
 and to lay the necessary groundwork for his upcoming trip to
 Washington where he hopes to "swagger about."
 NCNA muted its criticism of the U.S. role in the space flight and
 fc?lowed a carefully differentiated approach in treating the two
 superpowers.  While the USSR was repeatedly branded as "Soviet
 revisionism" or "social imperialism," the United States wa*
 mentioned in straightforward fashion without any pejorative
 epithet.  Moscn-..-  as depicted as an aggressive power whose
 military spending hat, "reached an all-time high," while the
 United States was seen as understandably "unwilling to stay behind"
 in the face of Soviet provocations.  Peking underscored its
 anti-Soviet bias by giving special attention to alleged Soviet
 efforts to use the flight to "steal U.S. secrets," noting in one
 instance that U.S. space personnel visiting the USSR in preparation
 for the, flight had discovered Soviet electronic eavesdropning on
 their conversations.

 PEKING ACCUSES MOSCOW OF INCITING CIVIL WAR IN ANGOLA
 PRC Vice Premier Ku Mu on 23 July broke Peking's silence on the
 armed fighting in Angola among competing liberation organizations,
 blaming the Soviet Union for "perpetrating subterfuges and trying
 by all means to stir up internal conflicts" in Angola for its own
 hegemonic ends.  Ku's remarks, at a banquet welcoming a Malagasy
 Government economic delegation to Peking, have been followed by
 several NCNA commentaries sharply critical ot: Moscow's Angolan
 policy and represent a Chinese rejoinder to recent accusations
 by the Soviet media that Peking has encouraged attacks by one
 liberation group, the Angolan National Liberation Front (FNLA),
 against the ot:hers.*
 In his banquet speech Ku noted that the three Angolan liberation
 organizatiops?--thc FNLA, the People's Liberation Movement of
 Angola (MPLA), and the Union for the Total Liberation of Angola
 (UNITA)--tiad recently confirmed their intention to work together
 toward independence, and he expressed Peking's conviction that
 superpower "sabotage and intrigue" could be overcome if the
 groups strengthened their unity.  Without specifically mentioning
 tae USSR, Ku added that "a superpower" whi^.h he said was stirring
 up Angolan internal conflict for its own advantage was merely
 "lifting a rock only to prop it on its own feet."
 A 26 July NCNA commentary sharply accused Moscow of attempting to
 sabotage the landmark accord worked out among the three rival
 groups in Nakuru, Kenya, on 21 June by publicly classifying t'ie
 groups into "revolutionary, nonrevolutionary and even counter-
 revolutionary" categories and by secretly shipping arms to "stir
 up civil war" among the rival insurgent movements.   It avoided
 specifically mentioning which liberation group Moscow supports
 against the others, however.  NCNA further charged that Moscow,
 like a "thief crying 'stop thief,"' has set its "propaganda
 machines in motion" to slander China and "other African countries"
 over Angola and it reaffirmed Peking's "consistent, resolute
 support to the Angolan people's efforts to fight for national
 independence in unity."
 NCNA on 27 July accused Moscow of interfering in the
 18-28
 July
 OAU Council of Ministers session in Kampala, Uganda,
 with
 the
 intention of rendering "the Angolan issue even more complicated by
 dividing African leaders."  It reported favorably on the 28th

 that the OAU ministerial council session had proposed for approval.
 by tlie OAU'n 12th summit conference opening on 28 July that the
 three Angolan liberation organizations cease hostilities
 immediately and attend the conference to d:lscuss the Angolan
 question.
 BACKGROUND     A 22 January 1975 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial
 commemorating the 15 January signature of the
 Angolan independence agreement in Lisbon by all three Angolan
 liberation groups had warned against the dangers of superpower
 "sabotage" and stated chat "the unity of the Angolan liberatio'o
 organizations . . . is an important guarantee fcr implementing
 the agreement and winning independence in the days to come."
 Peking has since taken pains to maintain friendly relations with
 the three Angolan groups, each of which h4,s sent delegations to
 Peking this yea:r.   Both the UNITA delegation led by general
 commander Samuel Chiwale to late March and early April, and the
 FNLA delegation led by Front Politburo member Hendrik Vaal NeLo
 in mid-July, had "cordial and friendly" conversations with PRC
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, according to NCNA.  The agency
 retorted that the MPLA delegation led by Politburo member Lucien
 Lara in late May and early June had a "cordial and friendly"
 conversation with lo!,er-ranking Vice Premier Chi Teng-kuei.
 Peking had not previously reported the outbreak of fighting between
 the Angolan groups either before or since the signing of the
 Nakuru agreement on 21 June, avoiding the issue ever, in NCNA's
 factual 22 June report on the signing of the agreement.

 MOSCOW RESTRAINED ON TURKISH TAKEOVER OF U.S, INSTALLATIONS
 Moscow has thus far offered limited, low-key comment on the U.S.
 House of Representatives' 24 July defeat of a bill partially
 lifting the embargo on U.S. arms to Turkey and Ankara's 25 July
 announcement suspending the activities of all U.S.-Turkish
 "Joint defense installations."  A 25 July TASS report on the
 House vote noted that President Ford hod expressed "deep disap-
 pointment" over the "negative decision" which could "irreparably
 damage" vital U.S. national security interests, including the
 United States' "usually excellent" relations with Turkey.   A
 PRAVDA dispatch from Istanbul, reported in a Moscow Turkish-
 language broadcast on the 27th, noted that the Turkish action
 would place under Turkey's control all U.S. bases in the country
 apart from NATO's Incirlik airbase.  PRAVDA observed that the
 main aim of the U.S. embargo was "to force the Turkish Government
 to change its Cyprus policy," but that in Turkey the American
 action was considered a manifestation of U.S. displeasure at
 Turkey's inclination to pursue an independent foreign policy.
 A subdued immediate reaction was to be expected from Moscow, with
 the base imbroglio coinciding with the Helsinki summit meeting
 capping the European security conference (CSCE).   A Turkish-
 language commentary on the 27th in fact drew an "instructive"
 lesson from the U.S. arms embargo, pointing out that one of the
 CSCE principles envisaged respect for the sovereignty of all.
 states on an equal basis, while the U.S. Congress' decision made
 Turkey, an independent and sovereign state, "dependent on the
 laws of another state."  The broadcast pointed out that despite
 strong criticism in Turkey, implementation of the "new status"
 for U.S. bases--announced by Ankara on 17 June, pending a 30-day
 period for opening of talks on new conditions for the instal-
 lations--had been postponed until after the Congressional decision
 on the embargo.
 Shortly after the June announcement, brief IZVESTIYA and PRAVDA
 articles, as well as scattered comment broadcast in Turkish,
 had underlined "growing criticism" among Turkish press and
 public opinion with the goverment's "policy of 'cautious
 accommodation."'  Turkish papers and political personalities,
 according to Moscow, were calling for immediate dismantling of
 the bases, abrogation of the U.S.-Turkish bilateral agreements,
 and adoption of a foreign policy based on Turkey's national
 interests.

 MIDDLE  EAST
 MOSCOW COOL TO EGYPTIAN ACTIONS OVER UNEF EXTENSION ISSUE
 Egypt's approval of extending the UNEF mandate for three more
 months, announced by Foreign Minister Fahmi the day before the
 mandate's expiration on 24 July, has drawn only curt Soviet praise.
 PRAVDA's international review column on the 27th referred briefly
 to the decision as a display of Egypt's "good will and respect
 for the United Nations."  Moscow's correct-but-cool reaction
 presumably reflects its reluctance to comment favorably on what
 was essentially a pressure tactic by Egypt in its current U.S.-
 assisted negotiations with Israel on a new Sinai disengagement
 agreement:.   Egypt's responsiveness to such negotiations has been
 a source of friction in Soviet-Egyptian relations over the past
 year.
 Following Egypt's declaration on the 16th that it might not renew
 the UNEF mandate, Moscow's sparse comment on the issue had been
 mixed and to some extent tailored for specific audiences.  Thus,
 Moscow's Arabic-language broadcasts pres,nted Egypt's hesitation
 over renewing the mandate as fully justified, given Israel's
 persistent "intransigence and procrastination" in withdrawing
 from occupied Arab territories and recognizing Palestinian rights.
 Its..ns carried by TASS and Moscow's domestic radio, however, seemed
 indirectly critical of Cairo's threat not to renew the mandate.
 TASS on the 17th reported Secretary Kissinger's remark at a
 Milwaukee press conference the previous day that the Egyptian
 position "will comr'icate the afforts for achieving peace."  On
 the 18th TASS indirectly p:,-aised the UNEF record by pointing to
 the UN Secretary General's report on UNEF activities from 13 April,
 to 15 July, which noted that "the ceasefire was preserved and no
 significant violations in the Egyptian-Israeli disengagement zone
 were recorded" and which concluded that further peace would depend
 on progress toward a Mideast settlement and creation of an
 atmosphere contributing to such efforts.
 TASS's accoun; of the 22 July Security Council discussion of the
 UNEF mandate issue noted that 12 council members, including the
 Soviet Union, had voted for approval of a message to President
 as-Sadat calling for prolongation of the mandate.   But the TASS
 account made no mention of any remarks by the Soviet delegate during
 the debate. In reporting the council's approval of a three-month
 extension "in view of Egyptian Government consent," TASS on the
 25th did summarize the Soviet representative's statement, concluding
 pointedly that the USSR calls for "serious preparations" and
 speediest resumption of the Geneva conference.  In a variation of

 last Apri.l's formula tying  any partial measures to the Geneva
 forum, the TASS account added that the Geneva conference could
 solve all matters related to final and comprehensive settlement
 of the Middle East problem "and to separate measures in the
 framework of an overall settlement."*
 Continued Soviet dissatisfaction with Cairo's diplomacy was
 reflected in remarks by a participant on Moscow radio's 20 July
 observers' roundtable who, while critical of Israel's "haggling"
 over withdrawal from Arab territories, reminded his audience
 that although Egypt was refusing to renew the UNEF.mandate, it
 did not intend to renounce its policy of cooperation with the
 United States to arrange a new "partial settlement" with Israel
 and that, on the contrary, "Egypt continues to trust in the
 possibility of American cooperation in such a settlement."
 *  The linkage of partial measures with the Geneva conference was
 first stet forth in the communique on Egyptian Foreign Minister
 Fahmi's 19-22 April visit to Moscow, discussed in the 23 April

 KOREA
 DPRK SPOKESMAN REJECTS U.S. PROPOSAL TO DISBAND UN COWARD
 North Korea has conveyed in a rather unusual and low-keyed manner
 its negative reaction to a 27 June U.S.-drafted UN resolution
 that proposes disbanding the present LEI Command in South Korea if
 alternate arrangements for continuing the armistice agreement can
 be devised.  The Pyongyang media's first direct response to the
 U.S. proposal came in the form of remarks by Korean Workers Party
 Political Committee candidate member Kim Yong-nam on 27 July,
 while meeting with Japanese newsmen accompanying a Liberal
 Democratic Party delegation to the DPRK.   Kim labeled the draft
 resolution an attempt by the United States to keep its troops in
 the ROK by "changing the UN Forces beret for another" and said
 the North would "determinedly oppose" such a move.
 Kim's remarks were transmitted by KCNA's English service and the
 Pyongyang domestic radio on 28 July.*  The North Korean versions
 of Kim's remarks seemed designed to stress the unofficial nature
 of the interview, noting that Kim was asked for "his opinion" on
 various issues, including the draft resolution.   The Korean
 versions reporting.the meeting identified Kim only as a "member"
 of the Foreign Policy Commission of the Central People's Committee
 and a deputy of the Supreme People's Assembly, whereas Japanese
 press accounts identified Kim as chairman of the commission and
 head of the party's international department.
 Earlier signs portending a negative DPRK response to the U.S.-
 cosponsored resolution had appeared in Kim Il-song's remarks in
 mid-July to a Japan Socialist Party (JSP) delegation, reported
 by Japanese but not North Korean media, and in a JSP-KWP joint
 statement carried by KCNA on 18 July.   The JAPAN TIMES reported
 on the 16th that Kim had told the JSP group the resolution was a
