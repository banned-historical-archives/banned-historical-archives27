 Speculating on a Possible Sino-Soviet Summit
 We speculate that improving US-Soviet relations and a desire both
 to support Gorbachev and reward recent Soviet flexibility could lead
 Beijing to agree to a high-level meeting. By agreeing, Beijing would seek,
 to restore lost leverage in Sino-US relations and unnerve Hanoi and New
 Delhi. Because a Deng-Gorbachev meeting would cause the greatest
 concern in the West, we judge it would be less likely in the near term than.
 a meeting of Foreign Ministers, Premiers, or Presidents. Chinese practice
 suggest to us that, should a meeting occur, the period between the next
 US-Soviet summit and a visit to Beijing by a senior US official is a
 particularly likely time.
 This memorandum was prepared by China Division, Office of East Asian Analysis.
 Information available as of 3 February 1988 was used in its preparation.' Comments and
 queries are welcome and may be directed to the Chief, China Division, OEAF_~

 Responding to Soviet Overtures
 precede a summit with Gorbachev.
 Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev in the last few months has twice called for a
 Sino-Soviet summit meeting, most recently in an 11 January interview published in a
 Chinese foreign affairs journal..' As in the past, the Chinese have responded by
 reiterating Deng Xiaoping's condition that resolution of the Cambodia problem must
 logic of the situation in which Beijing finds itself.
 A series of recent developments, however, leads us to speculate that the chance
 of a senior level meeting has increased. Our speculation is not based on hard evidence
 but rather on our appreciation of China's foreign policy goals, Chinese style, and the
 Reasoning That Could Lead to a Summit
 believed significantly improved the environment for China's reforms.
 At its most basic, Chinese foreign policy seeks a stable, non-confrontational
 relationship with the Soviet Union -- especially along the border -- so that Beijing can
 concentrate on its reforms and devote maximum resources to economic modernization.
 Beijing simultaneously seeks to deepen its relations with Washington partly. because of
 the Soviet long-term threat and partly to gain access to US markets and technology
 essential to the success of the modernization effort. This suggests that China would be
 more receptive to a summit if (1) it concluded that it was losing leverage in the
 Sino-Soviet-US strategic triangle or (2) it wanted to encourage Soviet behavior that it
 are pushing China toward just such a conclusion
 A case can be made that -- from Beijing's perspective -- recent developments
 The Strategic Triangle. The most significant development is the improvement
 in US-Soviet relations, which has left Beijing pondering the implications for China.
 Publicly, China has welcomed the upturn in US-Soviet relations for reducing
 international tensions and improving the environment for China's reforms.
 The Liaowang interview consisted of answers to three questions posed by the
 Chinese weekly in writing and dealing with Sino-US relations and Soviet reforms. It
 is the first interview with a Soviet leader to be published in a Chinese journal in more
 than two decades. In the interview, Gorbachev said there was an "objective
 necessity" for a Sino-Soviet summit at the "highest level" and pointed to similarities
 in Soviet and Chinese perspectives on arms control and domestic reform. Gorbachev
 called for a summit with Deng last November, during a meeting with Zambian leader
 Kaunda.

 help China get what it wants.
 Regional Concerns.  In the. last year, Moscow has altered its approach on China's
 top regional concerns: Indochina, the Sino-Soviet border, and Afghanistan, the so-called
 three obstacles. After telling Beijing for years that it had no role in a Cambodia solution
 and that China should discuss its differences with Vietnam directly, Moscow agreed to
 discuss the Indochina problem at the 9th round of their political normalization talks.
 More significant is the light pressure Moscow has begun to put on Hanoi and Phnom
 Penh to negotiate a compromise solution with Sihanouk. We believe the Chinese remain
 deeply suspicious of Hanoi and worry that Sihanouk still might negotiate an agreement
 they cannot live with, but Beijing is also aware that Moscow has taken a step that may

 The Soviets have also shown surprising flexibility on the Sino-Soviet border .
 issue, and real progress has been made in these negotiations over the last year. The
 Soviets have made most of the significant concessions, and although much has to be
 worked out, we believe a resolution of this issue is a real possibility in. the next few
 years. As with the Cambodia problem, the Chinese attribute the movement to
 not threaten`China.
 Progress is less evident on Afghanistan, but the Chinese have taken note of
 recent Soviet rhetoric. They believed that Gorbachev might say something significant
 on this issue during the Washington summit and were disappointed when he did not.
 But Afghanistan has always been the least important of the three obstacles for China,
 and Chinese officials have stated privately for years that the Soviet presence there does,

 Truly Obstacles?
 Although China is concerned about Soviet actions along its borders and still
 worries about Soviet encirclement, in our opinion the three obstacles are essentially a
 foreign policy tool and as such are not an insurmountable obstacle to either a summit
 or better Sino-Soviet ties. Beijing uses the obstacles in three ways: to modulate its
 relations with Moscow, the obstacles waxing and waning in importance depending on
 Beijing's goals; to press the Soviets for further concessions on the border and
 sales, stand in the way of other Chinese goals.
 The obstacles function in much the same way as the Taiwan issue does in the
 Sino-US relationship.  Beijing seeks concessions on this issue and raises and lowers the
 temperature to fit its mood, but Beijing does not let US ties to Taipei, including arms
 generations would work out the details.
 The Taiwan issue provides a useful analogy. In the early 1970s, Beijing took a
 very hard line on Taiwan, insisting that there could be no official relationship with the
 United States unless Washington broke all ties with Taipei. Ultimately they settled for
 far less -- Liaison Offices in 1972 and continuing US arms sales to Taiwan after
 recognition in 1979 -- because they believed they had more to gain by moving ahead
 with the United States despite the differences over Taiwan. Beijing declared that
 Washington had essentially accepted its principled position on Taiwan and that future
 when it has -- the Chinese show great flexibility in applying the principle.
 In our judgment, progress on the three obstacles sufficient to permit a summit is
 a matter of definition. Beijing can declare at any time that Moscow has substantially
 met its concerns on the obstacles. When negotiating, the Chinese insist that their
 "principled position" be accepted by the other side, but once it has -- and China defines
 China could conclude that a summit or senior-level meeting would serve its
 interests in a number of ways. First and foremost would be to redress what it may see
 as an imbalance in the.strategic triangle. Beijing may believe that a Sino-Soviet summit
 would remind Washington that it cannot take China for granted and that, unless
 satisfied, China can take steps that significantly change the US security environment.
 .  The Chinese may also see a senior-level meeting as helping Gorbachev. After a
 period of doubt, Beijing has concluded that the General Secretary sincerely wants better
 relations with China and that his focus on domestic development contributes to a stable
 international environment that China's reform program needs to succeed.

 To Beijing's way of thinking, a summit also could be useful in dealing with Hanoi,
 especially if it comes before agreement is reached on a Cambodia solution. A senior
 meeting would play on Vietnamese fears of being sold out, especially because China has
 stressed that the Soviets must meet its demands on Cambodia before a summit can
 occur.3 Beijing may hope that this would make Hanoi more flexible, but, in any case,
 increasing the discomfort in Hanoi is an end in itself.
 China may hope to have the same effect on India. The border dispute escalated
 last year, and isolated clashes and even hostilities are possible. Moscow has avoided
 taking New Delhi's side in the border dispute. During his visit to India in November
 1986, Gorbachev offered only platitudes on the need to resolve regional issues, avoiding
 endorsement of India's position.  China may conclude that a summit can only add to
 Indian doubts about Soviet reliability, and perhaps thereby weaken New Delhi's resolve
 and increase Beijing's leverage in the border negotiations.
 Thinking About Level ...
 Beijing recognizes that a summit runs the risk of increasing concern in the West
 about the direction of Sino-Soviet relations that could decrease China's access to
 Western technology and markets.
 As a result, if China decides a senior-level meeting with the Soviets is in its
 interests, it may not opt for a Deng-Gorbachev meeting. Both sides agreed in principle
 to a Foreign Minister's meeting outside the United Nations (where they meet each fall),
 but a specific date has never been set. That invitation could be picked up and a
 meeting set for Moscow or Beijing, perhaps in conjunction with the border talks or the
 normalization discussions.
 A second option is a meeting between the two Presidents -- largely ceremonial
 positions on both sides -- or an exchange of. visits by the two Premiers. Perhaps less
 likely is a meeting between Gorbachev and his Chinese counterpart, Zhao Ziyang,
 because it would be a party-to-party meeting, something the Soviets want and. China
 would try to extract a high price for, in part because of the likely reaction in the West.
 3 Hanoi is deeply suspicious of both Beijing and Moscow. It believes that both capitals
 negotiated away a Vietnamese victory at the 1954 Geneva Conference, and that
 Moscow did not apply any military pressure on Beijing when China invaded Vietnam
 in 1979.

 ... and Timing
 Assuming the will, timing becomes the most critical question, and Chinese
 practice offers clues on a possible time frame. First, the decision on a Sino-Soviet
 senior-level meeting is not going to be made lightly, and China will want to be sure that
 its position in the strategic triangle has slipped, or is in real danger of slipping, before
 going ahead. This suggests to us that Beijing would want to wait for the outcome of
 the fourth Reagan-Gorbachev summit. In any case, China is unlikely to agree to a
 senior-level meeting with the Soviets before a Rea an-Gorbachev meetin  for fear of
 increasing Moscow's leverage over Washington.
 If past practice holds, Beijing would try to balance a Soviet meeting with a visit
 by a senior US official. For instance, in May 1984 First Deputy Premier Arkhipov, the
 most senior Soviet visitor to date, was scheduled to begin a China visit immediately
 after President Reagan." And, in October 1986 Secretary of Defense Weinberger and
 Soviet Vice Foreign Minister Rogachev were breifly in country at the same time.
 In the last few weeks, Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have inquired about
 Secretary Shultz's schedule for later this year, and Chinese Defense officials are pressing
 for a visit by a senior US military figure. If Beijing believes it is at a serious
 disadvantage in the triangle, and/or if it believes that its security interests would be
 served by boosting Gorbachev's stock, and, if a senior US visit can be arranged, then, to
 Chinese thinking the ideal timing for a senior Sino-Soviet meeting would be after the
 Reagan-Gorbachev meeting and before the China-US meeting in the expectation that
 the Sino-Soviet meeting could increase Beijing's leverage in discussions with
 Washington.
 " The Soviets cancelled the visit -- although they subsequently rescheduled it for
 December 1984 -- in the face of China's warm reception for President Reacian and a
 dramatic upsurge in Chinese artillery barrages against Vietnam.

 3 January 1988
 Chinese "Liaowang" weekly publishes an exclusive interview with Gorbachev, in which he
 calls for a Sino-Soviet Summit meeting. Chinese respond by saying that Deng has
 made the conditions for a high level meeting quite clear and that "at present it is the
 strong hope of the international community that Vietnam will withdraw all its troops
 from Kampuchea promptly." -Xinhua and Renmin Ribao summaries of the interview omit
 Gorbachev's call for a summit.
 15 January 1987
 Tass reports the publishing of a Russian language version of Deng Xiaoping's book
 "Principal Issues Concerning Present Day China".
 23 January 1988
 Pravda article calls for Sino-Soviet summit, noting that "the Soviet-Chinese summit
 meeting could become the logical development of the beginning of political dialogue
 between the USSR and the People's Republic of China." This marks the third Soviet call
 for a summit in less than two months.
