 June 4, 1965           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 In history I doubt if any political scien-
 tist or historian would say that the leg-
 islative branch of Government was pre-
 dominant. Certainly the executive, since
 the early 1930's, has become stronger and
 stronger and has become a more pre-
 dominant branch of our Government.
 In more recent years our Supreme Court
 and the judicial branch of Government
 has become stronger and stronger and
 in some instances, in my opinion, has en-
 tered into the legislative field.
 The question before us 'really involves
 the power of the Congress, our power
 as an equal coordinate branch of the
 Government.  We, the Congress, should
 be jealous of our constitutional prerog-
 atives. We should, guard with every ef-
 fort we can put forth the rights we have
 as legislators.
 I have no objection, nor does anyone
 of whom I know on the minority side,
 to the extension of this act. We feel that
 under the circumstances it has been a
 constitutional delegation to the Presi-
 dent.  But we do feel there should be
 periodic reexaminations of the use of this
 power of reorganization.
 I understand, from the gentleman from
 California, that an amendment will be
 offered at the close of the debate in the
 Committee of the Whole to extend the
 act, rather than permanently, for a pe-
 riod of 31/2 years.
 .. Mr.  1IOLIFIELD.   Mr.  Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. ERLENBORN. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from California.
 Mr. , HOL,IFIELD.   Does the gentle-
 man not believe that this is a reasonable
 compromise between those  who feel
 that 2 years should be the time limit and
 those who believe the act should be ex-
 tended on a permanent basis?
 Mr. ERLENBORN.  I do not, for two
 reasons.'
 . First is the fact that it would bind a
 future Congress, if we made the exten-
 sion more than 2 years.  Second, I be-
 lieve  a fatal  error in picking this
 particular time-I believe it is really 3
 years and 7 months-is that it would
 make the act expire on December 31,
 1968. I believe that using this particu-
 lar period of time, which the other body
 has and. which the gentleman proposes
 In his amendment, would almost guar-
 antee that the power would lapse, be-
 cause it would lapse at a period of time
 when Congress would not be in session.
 The next session would begin in Janu-
 ary of 1969. Therefore, the power would
 lapse, and it would take some period of
 months for Congress to extend the
 power.
 Mr. HOLIFIELD.  If the gentleman
 will yield further, I will say it is cus-
 tolnary to extend acts some time before
 the expiration dates.  There would be
 nothing to  prevent    our  committee,
 Whieh is a diligent committee, from. ex-
 tending _the time prior to the expiration
 of the act.
 Mr. ERLENBORN. I would say to the
 gentleman I understand from a reading
 of the hearings in the other body the
 purpose of the extension for this period
 of time was to make it coextensive with
 the term of the President, so when a
 new President came into office the new
 President could reexamine this power.
 I submit to the gentleman if the exten-
 sion occurs in 1968, before the expira-
 tion of this time, the Congress will not
 know who the new President is. So this
 argument is no longer valid.
 Mr. RUMSFELD.  Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield to me?
 Mr. ERLENBORN.  Yes.  I yield to
 the gentleman from Illinois.
 Mr. RUMSFELD.  I want to commend
 and congratulate the gentleman from
 Illinois for this very fine presentation
 and analysis of this rather complex
 question.  I certainly concur in much
 of what he has said., I quite agree with
 him that while the proposed 31/2-year
 extension is a considerable improvement
 over a permanent extension, the 2-year
 extension, which he was discussing and
 which was discussed in great detail in
 the minority views, is certainly prefer-
 able.  Again let me acknowledge the
 very thoughtful contribution which has
 been made by the  gentleman from
 Illinoisi
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JEFFERY COHELAN
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, June 2, 1965
 Mr. COHELAN.  Mr. Speaker, in a
 special statement to the House of Com-
 mons, reported by Karl Meyer in this
 morning's Washington Post, British For-
 eign Secretary Michael Stewart                                                                   has
 clearly outlined a reasoned and reason-
 able path to peace in Vietnam.
 Mr. Stewart has suggested:
 First,   a   conference   under   whatever
 auspices can be agreed-a  ceasefire  could
 either  precede  such  a  conference  or  be
 achieved at the conference.
 Next, a settlement which assures South
 Vietnam  against any   form of aggression.
 Once so assured, South Vietnam would be a
 country in which there would be no for-
 eign troops or bases and which was tied to
 no military alliance.
 And third:
 The  future  relationship  between  North
 and South Vietnam should be a matter for
 free decision  of  the  peoples of  both
 countries.
 Mr. Stewart stated to the House of
 Commons that the barrier to peace in
 Vietnam is the "refusal of the Govern-
 ments of North Vietnam, China, and the
 Soviet Union to negotiate at all."
 He also made clear that his proposals
 had not been specifically agreed upon
 with the United States, but as Karl
 Meyer points out, they are in accord with
 stated American policy.
 Mr. Speaker, it is clear that negotia-
 tions and a diplomatic settlement are
 essential if peace and independence are
 A2895
 to be secured in South Vietnam. Foreign
 Secretary Stewart has outlined a mean-
 ingful path to that objective. Despite the
 intransigence evidenced to date by our
 adversaries, we must pursue this course
 with diligence and with vigor if a better
 alternative to war and aggression and
 uncertainty is ever to be offered the peo-
 ple of South Vietnam.
 I include the article of Karl Meyer for
 our colleagues' information and atten-
 tion :
 BRITISH  OFFER  VIETNAM  PLAN,  SCORE  RED
 REFUSALS To TALK
 (By Karl E. Meyer)
 LONDON, June 3.-British Foreign Secretary
 Michael Stewart said today that the barrier
 to peace in Vietnam is the "refusal of the
 Governments of North Vietnam, China and
 the Soviet Union to negotiate at all."
 In a special statement to the House of
 Commons, Stewart set forth more explicitly
 than before those steps his government would
 like to see taken to a conference table.
 "There is no reason, in common sense or
 humanity," Stewart said, "why the following
 sequence of events should not occur:
 "First, a conference under whatever aus-
 pices can be agreed-a cease-fire could either
 precede such a conference or be achieved
 at the conference.
 "Next, a settlement which assures South
 Vietnam  against  any  form  of  aggression.
 Once so assured, South Vietnam would be a
 country  in  which  there  were  no  foreign
 troops or bases and which was tied to no
 military alliance.
 "The future relationship between North
 and South Vietnam should be a matter for
 free decision of the peoples of both coun-
 tries."
 As Stewart spoke, the Foreign Office re-
 leased a white paper describing recent British
 efforts to call a Geneva conference at which
 Vietnam could be discussed.
 As related in the 24-page white paper, the
 recent  effort  grew  out  of  a  Communist-
 supported proposal last March 9 for a new
 Geneva conference to provide guarantees for
 Cambodia's neutrality and territorial integ-
 rity.
 The British were co-chairmen with the
 Russians in the 1954 Geneva conference that
 ended the French war in Indochina.   On
 April 26, the British asked the Soviet Gov-
 ernment to join in calling a new conference
 that would discuss Cambodia but could also
 take up the Vietnam war.
 Stewart told commons that he had on sev-
 eral occasions proposed to Soviet Foreign Sec-
 retary Gromyko that a new conference be
 called, "but he has so far refused."
 "I now say," he went on, "that I am ready
 at any time to join with him in this pur-
 pose."
 Observers here saw three levels of meaning
 in  Stewart's  statement  to  an  overflowing
 House.  First and most obvious was the Brit-
 ish desire to put the blame on the Com-
 munist powers for refusal to negotiate over
 Vietnam.
 Yet Stewart was also speaking directly to
 members of his own party who are critical of
 Britian's unwavering support for the United
 States  in Vietnam.   At least  50  leftwing
 backbench members of the Labor Party are
 wholly opposed to this policy, and many more
 express private misgivings.
 At the third level, the Stewart statement
 came    amid  growing restiveness  over that
 many Britons feel is inadequate consultation.
 with the American Government on Vietnam.

 statement was not an agreed one with the
 United States, though every item in it was
 in accord with stated American policy.
 The Ave Maria After 100 Years
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN BRADEMAS
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, May 20, 1965
 Mr. BRADEMAS.  Mr. Speaker, this
 week marks the 100th year of weekly
 publication of an outstanding journal,
 the Ave Maria, which is published by
 the congregation of Holy Cross at Notre
 Dame, Ind.
 The Ave Maria, although written by
 Roman Catholic clergy and laymen and
 designed as a challenging journal for
 members of the Catholic faith, provides
 for persons of every faith perceptive and
 thoughtful analyses of important issues
 in American life.
 The journal was established in the
 spring of 1865 by the founder of the
 University of Notre Dame, Father Ed-
 ward Sorin, C.S.C.
 The present editor of the Ave Maria
 Is a distinguished and dedicated priest,
 the Reverend John Reedy, C.S.C.
 I am pleased to call to the attention
 of my colleagues this important date in
 the life of this outstanding publication,
 and I ask unanimous consent to include
 at this point in the RECORD the text of
 an  article  by  another' distinguished
 priest and educator at the University of
 Notre Dame, the Reverend Thomas T.
 McAvoy,  C.S.C.,  entitled,  "The  Ave
 Maria After 100 Years."
 The text of the article follows:
 THE AVE MARIA AFTER 100 YEARS
 (By Rev. Thomas T. McAvoy, C.S.C.)
 The mood of so many Catholic writers of
 the past 2 years has been a kind of fear to
 look back as if opening the window of the
 church to let in fresh air means closing the
 door on the past. The affection expressed by
 the Western World for Pope John. XXIII,
 and the admiration for the openness of the
 Second Vatican Council are In such marked
 contrast to the attitude of the Western
 World toward Pius IX and the Roman Church
 of 1865 that one almost hesitates to look
 back.  But such an attitude toward our his-
 tory           Is not  only crass pragmatism,  it is
 stupid.  Perhaps the great-grandparents of
 the youngsters who now crowd American col-
 leges and haunt our radio and television pro-
 grams were illiterate, plodding peasants in
 Ireland, Germany, France, or Italy, but had
 they present-day opportunities their strong
 faith and physical stamina would outstrip
 20th-century youth.  But that is not the only
 reason why we contemplate the past.  Gen-
 erally, one cannot understand the better
 things of today unless he compares them
 with what went before.
 When Father Edward Sorin,  C.S.C., the
 founder of the University of Notre Dame,
 established the Ave Maria in the spring of
 1885, he was creating something new for the
 United States-a devotional periodical.  He
 was planning how he could bring to the
 pioneer country of the Middle West the bene-
 fits                                                           of  Christian  civilization,  and  an
 important agency for that was a Christian
 family magazine.  In 1865 Father Sorin was
 51 years old, a swarthy. well-built man with
 dark shining eyes, whose quick speech was
 still touched with a French accent. He was
 creating a college on the plains of northern
 Indiana with little more than willpower and
 daring.  The college had survived the Civil
 War, despite the fact that eight priests had
 been spared by the small community to serve
 as chaplains In the Army. Two of them had
 died in the service and there were other trials
 during   the war years.   But the war was
 nearly   over  and  new   hopes  were  rising.
 Father Sorin planned to share in the prosper-
 ity of the Northern States and to increase
 the number of students, already numbering
 845 in a variety of departments and schools.
 Besides  the   traditional bachelor  of  arts,
 Notre Dame offered for the first time a
 bachelor's degree in science.
 The starting of the Ave Maria was part of
 this new world.  In the very first month of
 the Ave Maria, lumber and stone were being
 stacked around the college building because
 at the end of the summer the 4-story ham-
 mer-shaped building would become 6 stories,
 topped with a dome and eventually crowned
 by a statue of Father Sorin's patroness, Our
 Lady of the Immaculate Conception.  The
 Ave Maria was to share in the dedication of
 the enlarged building in 1866.  At the dedi-
 cation prizes were offered for the best essays
 and poems on Our Lady, which were to be
 printed in the magazine.
 The spirit of Father Sorin In his prosperity
 and his ambition, while Catholic, were truly
 American, in contrast to much of the leader-
 ship of the church in Europe which was
 cringing and shaking from the tremendous
 blows of European rationalism as it force-
 fully drove the church out of her churches
 and out of her schools.  The conditions of
 the church in Western Europe explains why
 Pope Pius IX, the previous December 8, is-
 sued his encyclical "Quanta Cura" and the
 "Syllabus of Errors."  The vehemence of that
 document must be understood as the words
 of a Pope fighting for his life and for the life
 of his church in one of the darkest hours of
 the church in Europe.  The papal syllabus
 rejected  article 77: "In the present day, it
 is no longer expedient that the Catholic re-
 ligion shall be held as the only religion of
 the state, to the exclusion of all other modes
 of worship," and article 80, "The Roman Pon-
 tiff can, and ought, to reconcile himself to,
 and agree with progress, liberalism, and civ-
 ilization as lately introduced."
 Archbishop Martin John Spalding of Balti-
 more, the leader of American Catholicism. in:
 eluded the Pope's encyclical in his own pas-
 toral letter of February 8, 1865, and explained
 to American Catholics that the strictures of
 the papal message were not aimed at Ameri-
 can liberty, secured under our "noble Con-
 stitution in regard to the liberty of consci-
 ence, of worship, and of the press."  Arch-
 bishop Spalding drew the contrast between
 the shrinking church of Western Europe and
 the expanding church in the United States.
 Quoting the first amendment of the Consti-
 tution, he said the Founding Fathers who
 had composed that law did not intend "to
 pronounce all religions, whether true or false,
 equal before God, but only to declare them
 equal before the law" and added that under
 the circumstances they could have adopted
 no other course.
 Father Sorin, like his friend Archbishop
 Spalding, appreciated the difference between
 the persecution of the church in Europe and
 the liberty of the church in the United States
 and intended to take full advantage of the
 glowing future of the new country.
 Notre Dame, in 1965, was In the middle of
 the country, but not in the center of Amer-
 scan catholicism.  Most of the prosperous
 Catholic America lay south of the Mason-
 Dixon line before the Civil War, and because
 the chief Catholic centers were in the border
 States of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri,
 the church suffered with the South, not only
 from the devastations of war, but also from
 the upset economy of the Southern States
 resulting from the destruction of the country
 by war.  Nor were there many Catholics with
 the financial means to profit by the indus-
 trial expansion of the North in the decades
 after the war.  Numerically, the Catholics
 were a northern church with her concentra-
 tions in the cities and mill towns of Massa-
 chusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York, but
 these, mostly Irish immigrants, had not yet
 recovered from their flight from poverty and
 disease during the famine panics less than a
 generation before.  These were to rise, too,
 but slowly and chiefly by political organiza-
 tion and power.
 Considering these facts one can under-
 stand why several of the bishops whom
 Father Sorin consulted about starting the
 Ave Maria told him that his prospects of suc-
 cess were nil.  He admitted to Father Neal
 Gillespie, C.S.C., his successor as editor, that
 he began in fear: "I may be deceived, dis-
 appointed, laughed to scorn * * * "  He In-
 tended the Ave Maria as something new.
 There had been Catholic literary reviews be-
 fore, although they had not lived long, and
 in April 1865, the Catholic World, "a monthly
 eclectic magazine of general literature and
 science" had been founded, but it consisted
 almost entirely of reprints and translations
 from Europe.
 Father Sorin called the Ave Maria a "fam-
 ily newspaper in which we intend to speak
 exclusively of our own family affairs."  There
 were in it some translations from European
 periodicals, but the heart of the magazine
 was original, prepared in part by Father Sorin
 but more often by Mother Angela, C.S.C., the
 foundressof the modern St. Mary's, and her
 brother, Father Neal Gillespie.  Soon there
 was a page for children and a column of news
 of happenings In the Catholic Church. There
 were short stories and full-length fiction
 from the few Catholic writers of the day.
 Father Sorin sought contributions from the
 chief Catholic thinker of the day, Orestes A.
 Brownson.  This convert from free-thought.
 Protestantism, and Comtism did not have an
 easy life in Catholicism.  His efforts to re-
 concile Catholicism with the American way
 of life had brought him the disfavor of both
 the Irish Catholic immigrant and the native
 American Protestant.  In 1864 he had stopped
 printing his Review because he no longer had
 enough supporters to pay the cost of printing.
 The fact that Father Sorin had sought his ad-
 vice on starting a magazine as early as 1854
 and had visited "the Great Reviewer" in his
 home in the interim indicate the ambitious
 plans of Father Sorin.  Later, when Father
 Sorin questioned some phrases in one of
 Brownson's essays to the Ave Maria, Brown-
 son said he would no longer contribute, but
 Mother Angela was able to bring peace be-
 tween these two strong spirits.
 ARCHBISHOP PURCELL
 Mother Angela had to play the peacemaker
 between Father Sorin and another strong
 mind, the Archbishop John Baptist Purcell
 of Cincinnati.  Archbishop Purcell and Father
 Sorin were on the same side of most argu-
 ments, but the archbishop did not foresee
 the value of the Ave Maria, possibly because
 he thought it would compete with his own
 Catholic Telegraph, edited by Father Edward
 Purcell in Cincinnati; but when teased about
 his silence by Mother Angela he gave in after
 a few Issues and wrote a letter of approval.
 Perhaps the archbishop also saw that Father
 Sorin's proposed "newspaper" was going to

 Unit States Is Using More Than Guns
 in Vietnam War
 i'tl   EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN E. MOSS
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, May 27, 1965
 Mr. MOSS.  Mr. Speaker, in an edi-
 torial on May 25, 1965, the Sacramento
 (Calif.) Bee calls to the attention of the
 public  the significant assistance  the
 United States is providing in South Viet-
 nam other than military.  The editorial
 rightly points out. that the United States
 is also fighting communism by attacking
 disease, poverty and privation, and by
 creating educational and medical oppor-
 tunities which never existed in South
 Vietnam.
 The editorial follows:
 UNITED STATES Is USING MORE THAN GUNS IN
 VIETNAM WAR
 President Lyndon B. Johnson has disclosed
 the United States is doing more than mov-
 ing up guns to stem communism in South
 Vietnam.  It is fighting communism, as well,
 by attacking disease, poverty and privation,
 and  by  creating educational  and medical
 opportunities which  never existed  in  the
 peasant. provinces.
 In his recent talk to the Nation about
 American policy in Vietnam, the President
 termed this assault as the "most important
 battle of them all."  And it is.  Communism
 can be stayed with guns; it can be defeated,
 however, only by creating the abundant life
 and eliminating reasons for a people to adopt
 such an extreme.
 The President put it well when he said:
 "A nation cannot be built by armed power
 or by political agreement.  It will rest on the
 expectation by individual men and women
 that their future will be better than their
 past.
 The American outlay in South Vietnam
 has been abundant.  In the 11 years this
 Government has spent more than $2 billion
 for assistance.  The result: Rice production
 has doubled; for the first time, modern agri-
 cultural methods are being introduced, albeit
 slowly, to that land where ancient methods
 have prevailed.
 The United States has constructed more
 than 4,000 classrooms in the last 2 years
 alone.  It intends to build thousands more
 in the next year.  As a measure of the ex-
 panding interest in education, schools had an
 enrollment of but 300,000 in 1955 and today,

 in the midst of deadly war, enrollment is 1.5

 In a direct assault against epidemics and
 plagues, the United States, moreover, has in-
 troduced public health programs.  It has

 the period of time that the powers ex-
 isted was specified to be 4 years.
 Sinee that time the Congress has ex-
 tended these powers at 2-year intervals
 and, as has been mentioned before, on
 one or two occasions there have been
 lapse periods of time when these powers
 were not in force.
 It is also interesting to note when I
 mention this is not a partisan political
 question, but really a question between
 the legislative and the executive branch
 of Government, that three Presidents

 1949, then President Eisenhower in 1953,
 Further Amending  the  Reorganization  and now President Johnson in 1965.
 SPEECH
 or
 HON. JOHN N. ERLENBORN
 OP ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 3, 1965
 The House in Committee of the Whole
 House on the State of the Union had under
 consideration the bill (H.R. 4623) further
 amending the Reorganization Act of 1949.
 Mr. ERLENBORN. Mr. Chairman, at
 the outset let me state that the ques-
 tion before us Is not a question of parti-
 san, political nature. The real question
 before us is the basic question of the
 separation of powers; - the constitutional
 creation of a government composed of
 three equal and coordinate branches of
 government.
 The history of the reorganization leg-
 islation and the Presidential requests for
 plans for reorganization, I think, are in-
 teresting in the context of this debate.
 The reorganization procedure goes back
 to approximately 1932.  I might state
 that the original plan or the original
 enactment of reorganization powers in
 the executive did have the feature of
 granting this power on a permanent
 basis, so, that there is some legislative
 precedent for the bill now before us for
 a permanent granting of this power to
 the President.  However, it Is also in-
 teresting to note that the Congress did
 not wait long to remedy what it consid-
 ered to be the mistake of granting this
 on a permanent basis. Within 7 months,
 after the original reorganization plans
 were granted they took away the feature
 of permanency and made the limitation
 2 years.
 From time to time subsequent to the
 original enactment reorganization pow-
 ers were granted, but always on a basis
 of having the short termination date,
 usually a period of 2 years. During the
 war years these powers were extended
 on an emergency basis without limlta-
 tion, the only limitation being that the
 powers would lapse 6 months after the
 termination of, hostilities.
 The act that we are now amending is
 the Reorganization Act of 1949, which is
 the result of the activities of the Hoover
 Commission. At the time it was enacted,
 in addition, former President Hoover
 recommended  that  these  powers  be
 made permanent.    However, the Con-
 gress has been jealous of its legislative
 prerogative and as yet has not seen fit to
 grant these powers on a permanent basis.
 Let us also understand that the Re-
 organization Act does grant legislative
 authority to the Executive and there
 havebeen some fine constitutional ques-
 tions raised as to the power of the Con-
 gress to do so. Let me state that in my
 opinion, this is, and there is no question
 but what it is, a grant of legislative pow-
 ers to the Executive.  However, there
 can be such a grant without it being an
 unconstitutional grant, and I believe the
 reorganization powers that have been
 granted to the President is a constitu-
 tional grant of the legislative powers be-
 cause the act itself sets the guidelines
 under which the President can act.
 This question has not per se been
 decided by the Supreme Court though
 some related cases have been.
 In effect, we are, under the reorganiza-
 tion procedure, reversing the legislative
 process.  The President is given the
 power to promulgate legislation.  The
 President in doing so prepares a plan of
 reorganization within the limits of the
 law, that is the Reorganization Act, and
 submits this to the Congress. Under this
 procedure, the Congress is given the
 ordinary executive power of veto because
 this is the only power that we can exer-
 cise in the reorganization procedure.
 Once the Executive has filed the re-
 organization plan, Congress has the
 power of veto for a 60-day calendar pe-
 riod which It can exercise or not as it
 sees fit.  We do not have the other or-
 dinary legislative powers, the power to
 amend and so forth.
 Some have asked, since the power to
 veto has been made more liberal as the
 years have gone by, why is it not now
 possible to extend the reorganization
 powers on a permanent basis?  I think
 we should recall that over the years the
 veto process has been changed consid-
 erably. At one time to override a presi-
 dential reorganization plan required a
 of Congress, acting alone with a simple
 majority of those voting, can override or
 veto a reorganization plan.
 But I point out to you that these sub-
 stantive changes in the law have been
 tied to extensions of the power.  If this
 power was made permanent in the Presi-
 dent, it would then be very easy for the
 President to veto bills that contained
 such substantive changes.  So that the
 periodic extension of the powers of this
 act gives the opportunity then to tie in
 one legislative enactment substantive
 changes that Congress deems necessary
 together with the extension, thereby giv-
 ing the President a choice either of veto-
 ing the bill and destroying his power, be-
 cause the extension had not been signed
 into law, or of signing the bill into law
 which gives the extension power and also
 because Congress changes any substan-
 tive portion of the act that Congress may
 from time to time deem necessary.
 It is not only that question that con-
 cerns us, the question of the method of
 overriding the plan or vetoing the plan.
 There are other substantive changes that
 have been necessary from time to time
 and the most recent and outstanding was
 the amendment that was adopted just
 last year by the Congress.
 You may recall that President Ken-
 nedy submitted a plan for reorganization
 which Incorporated the creation, of a
 new executive department. This was the
 Department of Urban Affairs.  At that
 time Congress balked and said it was
 never the intention of the Congress to
 grant to the Executive power either to
 abolish or create new departments. The
 power of the President under the Reor-
 ganization Act lapsed as a result of this
 dispute.
 Congress in its wisdom last year, in
 extending the plan, also amended the
 Reorganization Act to specifically pro-
 hibit the creation or abolition of depart-
 ments.
 I believe it has been shown that the
 periodic  extension  gives  to  Congress
 power to make substantive changes in
 the act which are necessary.
 Another objection to extending the act
 for a long period of time is the fact that
 within the act itself are specified rules
 which apply to the procedure for overrid-
 ing or disapproving plans.
 It is historically true that we adopt
 our rules on a 2-year basis.  We do not
 adopt permanent rules in the House.
 Every 2 years the new Congress has an
 opportunity to reexamine the rules and
 to change the rules.
 In effect, if we should extend this act
 without limitation, or extend it beyond
 the 2-year period, we would be adopting
 rules for a period beyond this Congress
 and binding future Congresses.   .
 I believe it goes without saying that
 over the years there has been constant
 constitutional majority of both Houses interaction among the three coordinate
 acting together in concert. Later it was branches of Government-the judicial,
 made within the power of one House act- executive, and legislative.  At one time
 ing with a constitutional majority to veto one was predominant and at another
 a reorganization plan and most recently, time another was predominant.  I am
 and under the present law, either House sorry to say that at the present period

 law them. President Johnson's action would
 legalize union shop contracts in the 19 States
 that now forbid them.
 The closed shop, requiring union member-
 ship before a man is hired, is banned in all
 states under Federal law.   National labor
 legislation permits the union shop which re-
 quires a worker to join the union after he has
 been hired, usually within 30 days.
 President Johnson, in calling for repeal of
 section 14(b), said he did so "with the hope of
 reducing conflicts in our national labor pol-
 tcy that for several years have divided Ameri-
 ()ITIZEN9 'VERSUS BIG LABOR
 We think it will be a sad day for South Da-
 kota and America If the mighty U.S. Govern-
 ment goes all the way in its aid to big labor
 and tells our citizens they must join a union
 if they are to hold a job.
 Repeal of section 14(b)  will not unify
 Americans ,on this issue.  The provision in
 the Taft-Hartley Act was passed to protect
 the American worker from union bosses.
 What are they afraid of, may we ask?  Why
 do they have to have compulsory member-
 ship, and with it, the dues of every worker
 in a plant, or in a business?  Where are the
 guarantees that a worker's dues will be used
 for eR union s d not political purposes?
 South Dakota 1vorkers have a vital civil
 right today, guaranteed by their constitu-
 tion.  If President Johnson is successful in
 his plea to repeal the law, the workers lose
 that right. Union bosses would win one more
 round in their quest for domination of the
 Nation's political and economic life.
 'Nineteen States would see further diminu-
 tion of their power in favor of Federal reg-
 ulatory agencies.
 Another State-where workers will lose this
 civil right is President Johnson's home State
 of Texas,  As a Member of the House when
 the Taft-llartley Act was passed April 17,
 .1947, Johnson voted for passage.  There was
 no separate vote then on section 14(b); it
 was `one of the key features of the act.
 On June 20, 1947, Johnson voted to over-
 ...ride President  Harry  S.  Truman's  veto.
 Johnson was in the Senate when that body
 voted down an attempt to strip section 14
 (b) from thelaw.  That was June 30, 1949.
 Johnson voted with the majority to retain
 section 14(b). Now he wants to repeal It.
 t   I- & POLITICAL APPEAL
 We think President Johnson's call for re--
 peal of the right-to-work section is strictly
 political,' to 'make good- on it '1964 campaign
 promise to big labor.  Congress should turn
 it down-vote the  way  Johnson himself
 voted when he was a legislator.
 We hope South Dakota's four Members of
 Congress will consider citizens' rights ahead
 of convenience and power for big labor and
 big government.

 THE  PRESIDENT  MAKES  A  POINT
 President Johnson revealed a little told
 side of the South Vietnam story yesterday in
 a radio-television address from the White
 House.  Most of the news coming from that
 battle-torn southeast Asian state has to do
 with war and fighting, death and suffering.
 Most news accounts present a picture of a
 country barely holding its own in a struggle
 against the Communist Vietcong.  But the
 President produced facts and figures which
 demonstrate that despite the constant pres-
 sure from Red forces, South Vietnam has reg-
 istered  important gains in areas such as
 health, agriculture, and education.
 American technical aid is daily opening
 new doors to a better way of life for the
 Vietnamese people-and it is no wonder that
 the Communists fear this example and are
 doing all in their power to retard its progress.
 If South Vietnam should emerge as a show-
 case for democracy, a land of plenty next
 to the hungry Communist-controlled areas,
 Mao Tse-tung would be hard pressed to keep
 his  millions from revolting.     They,  too,
 would develop an appetite for the fruits of
 freedom..
 Our investment in South Vietnam has been
 a large one.  But it also will have been a
 wise one if it turns the tide against com-
 munism in this area.  Since 1954, said Mr.
 Johnson, the United States has poured more
 than  $2  billion into the little  country.
 What has it bought?
 The President put it this way:
 Rice production has been doubled.
 A new variety of sweet potato, promising
 a sixfold increase in yield, is being planted
 this year.
 Corn output should rise from 25,000 tons
 in 1962 to 100,000 tons by 1966.
 Pig production has more than doubled
 since 1955.
 In other areas of assistance:
 A medical school is being built with Amer-
 ican aid in a country which has only 200
 civilian doctors to serve a population of 16
 million.
 Seven million people have been vaccinated
 against cholera and U.S. assistance has con-
 structed and stocked more than 12,000 ham-
 let health stations.
 Americans have help build more than 4,000
 classrooms in the last 2 years and by 1967
 more than 15 million textbooks will have
 been supplied to Vietnamese children.
 The Communists have demonstrated their
 fear of these programs by destroying agri-
 cultural stations,  burning medical centers,
 murdering Vietnamese malaria fighters and
 capturing or killing U.S. aid officials.
 Nowhere in the world can the Communists
 match the constrilgtiye efforts of the United
 States.  In Cuba where Moscow and Peiping
 might have established a Communist show-
 case, there are critical shortages, a comedy
 of mismanagement in industry and agricul-
 ture and an educational program which de-
 ,ludes the young into believeing there are
 solutions in slogans.
 The Reds can tear down but they cannot
 build.  Too deep a devotion to ideology has
 A2891
 handicapped Russian industry and agricul-
 ture; it has forced Peiping to deliver words
 instead of rice to its hungry masses; it has
 sent both Russia and Red China into the
 world market for wheat and feed grains,
 seeking from the capitalist surplus food to
 make up for the Communist deficit.
 Here, then, is another reason we cannot
 "cut and run" from South Vietnam as some
 U.S. "liberals" demand.  To desert these peo-
 ples and these gains and all the hope em-
 bodied in accomplishments to date would
 brand us as utter cowards and destroy for-
 ever all confidence in our courage of convic-
 tion and strength of determination.
 Here we must stand; and here we must
 fight.
 More important, here we must win and win
 decisively.  .
 There are no other choices.
 An Address by Associate Justice Arthur

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN BRADEMAS
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, May 28, 1965
 Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Speaker, under
 unanimous consent, I insert in the REC-
 ORD the text of an eloquent address by
 the distinguished Associate Justice of the
 U.S. Supreme Court, Arthur J. Goldberg,
 concerning the social responsibility of
 the churches  and synagogs  of  our
 country.
 Mr. Justice Goldberg spoke as a pul-
 pit guest at the All Souls' Church, Unita-
 rian, in Washington, D.C., on May 24,
 1965.
 The text of his address follows:
 REMARKS BY Hose. ARTHUR J. GOLDBERG, Asso-
 CIATE  JUSTICE,  SUPREME  COURT  OF  THE
 UNITED STATES, ALL SOULS' CHURCH, 16TH
 AND  HARVARD STREETS, WASHINGTON, D.C.,
 MAY 23, 1965
 In 1949, William Faulkner brought honor
 to himself and to the United States when he
 was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.
 In his acceptance speech, he stated a con-
 viction that I share, and that motivates men
 of good will the world over.
 "I decline," he said, "to accept the end of
 man.  It is easy enough to say that man is
 immortal simply because he will endure. ** *
 I refuse to accept this.  I believe that man
 will not merely endure; he will prevail."
 The triumph of man is uniquely in the
 keeping of religion-the informing of his
 spirit, the firing of his conscience, the awak-
 ening of his soul to the fact that in observing
 the spirit of God he is exercising the only
 true freedom.                                 -
 But these need not be slogans on banners
 nor messages on wreaths laid at the feet of
 monuments to past and meaningless events.
 They need not be so incarcerated into history
 as to be beyond the reach of living men.
 In one of the great passages of Homer,
 Ajax, surrounded by darkness and facing his
 foes, prays for light "that we may see our
 fate, and die at least, if such they will, in
 the open light 'of day."  He does not pray
 for victory; he does not pray to live; he prays

 for light, that he may stand to the full
 height of a man and we face his fate.
 WE SEEK LIGHT
 Today, we also seek light.  We also seek
 it-not to avoid our problems but to face
 them as true men.  We do not seek religion
 to remove our trials, to transquilize our prob-
 lems-but for light, for illumination, for the
 true meaning of moral and ethical impera-
 tives.
 Over 63 percent of our population are mem-
 bers of churches.  Over 114 million persons
 of all faiths, testifying to a greater Power,
 and practicing religion in their own way.
 Perhaps a great number of them; do not re-
 alize the stakes in the world, unless the read
 of the recent suppressions and prosecutions
 of Jews in the Soviet Union,, unless they
 hear of the closing of Catholic churches be-
 hind the Iron Curtain, unless they read of
 the arrest and convictions of Protestant mis-
 sionaries.
 Religious tolerance has become a touch-
 stone of freedom.  Where tolerence is found,
 there also free men dwell.  Religious intol-
 erance has become a touchstone of totali-
 tarianism, as Hitler and Stalin demonstrated.
 The history of all churches, through all
 ages, has demonstrated that religion must
 recognize its obligations as well as its rights
 to preach and practice moral values, or fail
 in its mission. This is the light that illumi-
 nates a real democratic political system. In-
 volvement for the churches and synagogues
 is necessary for society-and for the church-
 es and synagogues themselves if they are to
 maintain their vitality as living forces in a
 society whose fate will be decided  by the
 pressing social problems of a modern age.
 Socially minded churches and synagogs
 are guarantees that religion will be an ally,
 not an enemy, of democracy.
 RELIGION IS FREE TO SPEAK
 In our' blessed land, religion is free to
 speak.           Our Constitution expressly guaran-
 tees that there shall be no law prohibiting or
 impairing the right of free exercise of re-
 ligion.                             Under our Constitution there is a
 wholesoipe neutrality by the Government to-
 ward all religions; the, ideal of our, Con-
 stitution as to religious freedom is one of
 absolute equality before the law of all re-
 ligious opinions and sects; the Government,
 while protecting all, prefers none, and it dis-
 parages none; our constitutional policy does
 not deny the value or necessity for religious
 training, teaching, or observance; rather it
 secures their full exercise Without helping
 or hindering any particular religion. Indeed,
 thte 'constitutional protections of religious
 tolerance were designed for a pluralistic so-
 cienty that had seen enough, and knew
 enough, of the devisive influence of censor-
 ship of belief in the Old World.  While we
 share the common heritage of our beliefs,
 we do not give up the right to practice in
 the light of our own doctrines.
 If we are, each of us, members of an an-
 cient unity of belief, then I believe there is
 one aspect of that unity and heritage which
 we are bound to implement-together as
 men and women who share the heritage, and
 separately as those subscribing to different
 doctrine.
 TO. SEEK JUSTICE
 Certainly, at the root of the moral and
 ethical doctrine of both the Old and the New
 Testaments isthe instruction to seek justice
 and righteousness, to act as a person of God.
 All of the great prophets were deeply in-
 volved in the society of their time.  Christ's
 Sermon on the Mount brought comfort to the
 poor and sorrowful.  Can we, in good con-
 science, do otherwise?                   If religion is a sermon
 for the individual, a refuge, and a shelter,
 its great traditions have also been stated in
 the words of its leaders as instruments with
 which to change the world, to seek justice
 and righteousness.
 Today more than 30 million Americans
 are living substandard lives; 10 million chil-
 dren are being raised in poverty.  There is
 not enough work, in a generally rich and
 productive econoiAy, for the unskilled.  The
 numbers of the long-termed unemployed are
 shockingly large; the tragedy is that among
 them are millions of young people who enter
 their adult lives without any experience of
 the promise of American life.
 Many of our citizens are denied solely be-
 cause of race or color equal protection of the
 laws; many others are denied the equal jus-
 tice under law guaranteed by our Constitu-
 tion to the rich and poor alike.  I would
 make note, also, that in a nation of religious
 tradition and commitment, our public face
 is often profane and secular, with serious
 moral problems apparent in the conduct of
 our enterprises.  We see it in businesses and
 in labor unions and sometimes we see it in
 Government also.
 Now many of these problems are the proper
 concern of the political leadership we have
 entrusted with the conduct of government.
 Others are the proper concern of the judicial
 system.  In neither of these areas is it ap-
 propriate for me to comment.  But all of
 these problems are the proper concern of
 religion. They are a part of the ancient
 evils that have burdened man; it is religion's
 part to confront them.
 THE FAILURE OF RELIGION
 The failure of religion to do so is com-
 pounded by the fact that here it is free to
 do so.                   There is a neutralism between church
 and state in our country, but there can be
 no neutralism between our churchesand the
 problems around them.  The concept of `re-
 ligious liberty and toleration is a vote of
 confidence in the ability of religions to lead
 active, useful, even determinative roles in
 the making of a better world.
 The new heritage of religion, here in the
 New World, is a return to the old heritage
 of involvement in the temporal condition as
 well as the eternal destiny of man.  Minis-
 ters and rabbis and priests and the laity who
 stand aloof from the problems  that grip
 individuals today are asking those individ-
 Uals to stand aloof from religion.
 I do not mean to suggest that our faiths
 have forsaken their proper roles as a matter
 of course.  More and more, the voices of the
 religions are being heard-in protest and
 dissent as well as in commendation and
 counsel.  Pope John XXIII's two encyclicals
 on world social and economicconditions and
 world peace are monuments of the commit-
 ment of his faith to an active role in the
 troubled  world.  The National  Council  of
 Churches has taken strong and positive posi-
 tions on poverty and unemployment and dis-
 crimination.  The leaders of my own faith
 have been vigorous advocates of equality and
 respect for human right.  Clergymen of all
 faiths are participating actively in the effort
 to achieve civil rights for all citizens.
 THE COMMITMENT OF LEADERSHIP
 The problem seems to be that the commit-
 ment of leadership on th 3 highest levels does
 not always penetrate to the membership of
 churches and synagogues-to laymen or, to
 put it' another way, to you and to me.  Yet if
 commitment does not penetrate, it fails to
 reach our lives.
 Bringing religion to bear upon moral and
 ethical problems means helping this Nation
 go forward here at home-realizing the just
 society, defending the rights of all citizens
 to full citizenship, commending and sup-
 porting good legislation, speaking out on im-
 portant matters, leading in the fields of
 equality of opportunity for all and an eco-
 nomic chance for every man.
 And it means helping this Nation to realize
 its objective abroad-peace in freedom for all
 Who seek it.
 I believe that the fate of free religion in
 the world is part and parcel of the fate of
 our own Nation.  The survival and success
 of our political ideals is crucial to the sur-
 vival and success of the free religions that
 flourish within our borders.
 RELIGION AND DEMOCRACY
 Not only Judaism and democracy, not only
 Christianity and democracy, but religion it-
 self and democracy have a mutual interest in
 this  troubled  world.  When  communism
 Domes--whether to a Buddhist or a Moslem
 or a Hindu or a Christian or any other na-
 tion-religion goes.
 President Kennedy described the path to
 freedom as a lonely one.  We have no illu-
 sions about the difficulty of the road or the
 perils that lie along it.
 But we will make that journey in good
 spirit.  While preserving the separation of
 church and state in our country, we proudly
 assert the right of all religious groups, all
 churches, and synagogues, to preach what is
 good, and what is more important-if a lay-
 man may say so-to practice what is good.
 Erie County Democrats Gain Strength
 Under Peter Crotty's Leadership-Con-
 tinued Gains Seen Under Joe Crangle
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RICHARD D. McCARTHY
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, May 28, 1965
 Mr. McCARTHY.  Mr. Speaker, with
 the election of Joseph F. Crangle as Erie
 County, N.Y., Democratic chairman, I
 predict a new era of youthful zeal and
 dedication for the Democratic Party in
 western New York.
 Joe Crangle is my personal friend and
 neighbor.  We went to Canisius College
 together. He lives three doors from me
 in Buffalo and I have a great deal of
 respect and admiration for him.  My
 wife and I are very fond of his beautiful
 wife and four little girls.
 Joe Crangle, as a member of the new
 breed of political leaders of the John F.
 Kennedy school, will continue the tradi-,
 tion of seeking out and supporting only
 the finest type of dedicated candidates
 for public office.
 I am happy to add my name to those
 who will support Joe Crangle in all meas-
 ures that will add strength, vigor, and
 higher purpose to  government.   He
 comes to this job with impressive creden-
 tials and a willingness to face the issues
 squarely and intelligently.
 I would also like to pay my respects to
 the man who built up the Democratic
 Party in Erie County to its majority to-
 day-Peter Crotty. A colorful, intellec-
 tually stimulating political leader, Peter
 Crotty led the party through an exciting
 and turbulent era.
 In this very difficult and demanding
 position as county chairman, he wrote an
 absorbing chapter in the political history
 of western New York.
 When he took over the reins of the
 party in 1954, Republicans outregistered
 the Democrats by more than 50,000. To-
 day Democrats enjoy a 4,700 registered
 voter margin in Erie County.

 tax  while  including  State-operated
 sweepstakes along with illegal wagering?
 I. would like to obtain a sound answer to
 this question.  The people of New Hamp-
 shire would like to obtain an answer.
 There does not seem to be any sense of
 fairness in the application of this law.
 Before- the New Hampshire sweep-
 stakes was established, perhaps there
 was a good justification for the pre-
 ferred  treatment  accorded  legalized
 gambling. The wagering tax law was en-
 acted in an attempt to regulate and con-
 trol illegal gambling, and thus no pur-
 pose was served by covering wagering
 operations already licensed and super-
 iised by State authorities.  The intent
 of the law was clear. But its language
 was not sufficiently broad enough to cover
 the future New Hampshire sweepstakes.
 Thus the State of New Hampshire
 finds itself classed with illegal gamblers,
 with criminals, under the operation of
 the Federal law.  The Congress cannot
 permit this situation to exist any longer.
 Mr. President, at this time I would
 like to formally introduce my amend-
 ment to H.R. 837,1, on behalf of myself
 and 'my senior colleague from New
 Hampshire, Senator COTTON.  I send this
 amendment to the desk and ask that
 it be printed and referred to the appro-
 priate committee.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that this and pndment be printed at
 this. point in the RECORD.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The amend-
 ment will. be received, printed, and re-
 ferred to the Committee on Finance;
 and, without objection, the amendment
 will be printed in the RECORD.
 The amendment (No. 234) was re-
 ferred to the Committee on Finance, as
 follows :
 On page 23, after fter line 14, insert the fol-
 lowing new section:
 "SEC. 211.  STATE-CONDUCTED SWEEPSTAKES.
 ",(a) Section 4402 (relating to exemptions
 from the tax on wagers) is amended by strik-
 ing out 'and' at the end of paragraph (1), by
 striking out the period at the end of para-
 graph (2) and inserting ', or', and by adding
 at the end thereof the following new para-
 graph:
 "'(3)  STATE-CONDUCTED SWEEPSTAKES.-On
 any wager placed in a sweepstakes, wagering
 pool, or lottery-
 (A) which is conducted, by an agency of
 a State acting under authority of State law,
 and
 "'(B) the ultimate winners in which are
 determined by the results of a horse race,
 but only if such wager is placed with the
 State agency conducting such sweepstakes,
 wagering pool, or lottery, or with its author-
 ized employees or agents.'
 "(b) The amendment made by subsection
 (a) shall apply with respect to wagers placed
 after March 10,1964." .

 PRESSURE FOR CONTRIBUTIONS BY
 -CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES TO
 POLITICAL FUNCTIONS
 Mr. MILLER.  Mr. President, I have
 often said that the foundation of our
 Federal Government is the civil service
 employee.,
 Administrations come and go but the
 orderly process of Government business
 knows no interruption because of the
 capable and effective service of the civil
 service worker.
 That is why I am again dismayed to
 see that efforts are being made to pres-
 sure Federal employees into contributing
 to political functions.
 . Whether this pressure be "soft" or
 "hard," It is wrong. Whether this pres-
 sure is exerted by either party, it is still
 a breach of the law and regulations
 which were established to protect the
 worker.
 The Washington . Evening Star has
 focused its columns on these violations
 in the past. It did so again on May 28
 and June 1.
 The highly respected Star writer, Wal-
 ter Pincus, has drawn public attention to
 what is going on this year. I quote from
 his article of May 28:
 Machinery to solicit political contributions
 from Federal employees again has been set in
 motion by Democratic Party officials given
 the job of selling $100 tickets to the 1965
 12139:
 Democratic congressional dinner on June 24
 at the National Armory.
 In his article, Mr. Pincus quotes one
 political appointee to this effect:
 You have a choice-break the Justice De-
 partment's law or Maguire's law.
 The Justice Department's law referred
 to is a section of the Federal Code mak-
 ing it illegal for a Federal employee to
 directly to indirectly solicit contributions
 of a political nature.
 Maguire's law was a reference to the
 Democratic Party Treasurer Richard
 Maguire, the man, according to Mr. Pin-
 cus, "credited with setting up the ma-
 chinery for systematic solicitation with-
 in Federal agencies."
 I would strongly suggest that there
 should be no choice.  Maguire's law, as
 the Star put it in an editorial on June
 1, "ought to be repealed, fast."
 I am hopeful that the Justice Depart-
 ment, the Civil Service Commission, and
 the Congress will look into these re-
 ports.
 I am hopeful, but not very optimistic,
 that the agency heads in whose depart-
 ment these solicitations are taking place,
 will demand that they stop.
 I am hopeful, but not very optimistic,
 that President Johnson will see to it that
 they halt.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the article entitled,  "U.S.
 Workers Targets Again," and the edi-
 torial, "Maguire's Law," both from the
 Evening Star, be printed in the -REC-
 ORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 and editorial were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:

 MONEY AND POLITICS: U.S. WORKERS TARGETS
 AGAIN
 (By Walter Pincus)
 Machinery to solicit political contributions
 from Federal employees again has been set in
 motion by Democratic Party officials given
 the job of selling $100 tickets to the 1965
 Democratic congressional dinner on June 24
 at the National Armory.
 The aim this year, through mailings and
 personal  contact, apparently, is get those
 employees who contributed last year during
 the  presidential  campaign  to  contribute
 again.
 As part of their program, the Democrats
 again appear to be planning to push ticket
 sales within Federal departments and agen-
 cies-a practice that previously has stirred up
 criticism from within the civil service.
 This year, however,  it's  the  "salesmen"
 selected to do the pushing who appear dis-
 turbed.
 "You have a choice-break the       Justice
 Department's  law  or Maguire's  law,"  one
 political appointees said Wednesday. He had
 just been made part of his agency's team to
 push sales of $100 tickets to the dinner to a
 list of his colleagues.
 The "Justice Department's law" is a section
 of the Federal code which makes it illegal for
 one Federal employee to "directly or indi-
 rectly" solicit, receive "or * * * in any man-
 ner (be)  concerned in soliciting or receiv-
 ing, any assessment, subscription, or  con-
 tribution for any political purpose        what-
 ever * * *" from another Federal employee.

 now, to Impress either the Ways and Means
 Committee or the Senate Finance Commit-
 tee.  These arguments have always been
 countered by the objection that we could
 not afford the revenue loss involved.  De-
 spite this committee record, it now appears
 that we  can afford  a. revenue  loss even
 greater than the President has proposed.
 The bill is to be rushed to enactment with
 unseemly haste.  Public hearings are not
 necessary for both tax committees are fully
 informed as to the objections to the present
 excise system.  The marvel is that there
 should be such a sudden, sweeping reversal
 of attitude.  And the pity is that there will
 be no public hearings on how to reform the
 excise taxes so as to make them a more
 equitable and productive feature of the Fed-
 eral tax system.
 The apostles of the new fiscal order ap-
 pear unworried about the prospect of budget
 deficits.  Yet there is in the message an
 undercurrent of concern about the current
 fiscal policy.  It is revealed by the empha-
 sis on the beneficial effects of the earlier
 tax cuts, on the absence of Inflation, and on
 the desirability of providing a further stim-
 ulus to the economy through the proposed
 excise tax changes,  The stimulant is to be
 the addition of the tax reduction to total
 demand.
 The persistence of belief in this theory is
 amazing in view of the plain logic of the
 case.  As a matter of simple arithmetic, tax
 changes up or down do not affect total spend-
 ing power at any given state of the economy.
 Such changes merely alter the proportions
 of total income spent by the people and the
 Government, respectively, without changing
 the total.  Lower taxes do give a lift to
 morale through the added satisfaction of
 keeping and using more of the fruits of one's
 toil or thrift, instead of,eing compelled to
 submit to the decisions of Government as
 to how they shall be spent.
 The real source of stimulus to the economy
 is the additional spending power created by
 the deficits.  Tax reduction, with no cut or
 even an increase of spending, is a popular
 way to create a deficit. It is therefore a first
 step, but not the important one, in the stim-
 ulative process.
 It is recognized, even by the ardent advo-
 cates of deficits, that a point can be reached
 at which the ice Is too thin to bear more
 weight.  They seek consolation for the deficit
 course by referring to the evidence that infla-
 tion has not happened yet.
 Consequently, it Is appropriate to examine
 the data which are relied upon to demon-
 strate absence of inflation.  The chief statis-
 tical tools employed In this demonstration
 are the wholesale and consumer price in-
 dexes.  From the end of 1960 to the end of
 1964, a period which embraces most of the
 60-month span of uninterrupted business ac-
 tivity, the wholesale Index was virtually sta-
 tionary.   The consumer price index rose from
 103.1 to 108.7 on the base of 1957-59 prices.
 The stability of these indexes provides sup-
 port for the thesis that we have been spared
 the evils of inflation, notwithstanding aggre-
 gate net deficits of $26,5 billo:)n and a public
 debt Increase of $28.4 billion in this time.
 In another area, however, the evidence is
 not so reassuring.  This is the record of gross
 national product.   The only test of inflation
 here is a comparison of GNP in current dol-
 lars with the value expressed in dollars of
 constant purchasing power.  In the annual
 Economic Report the dollar purchasing power
 in 1954?.is used as the base. The results for
 the years 1960 and 1964 are:
 Gross national product, in current and 1954
 dollars (billions)
 Year             Current        1954
 dollars       dollars _
 1060--------------------- -        502.6
 1964------------ -- -- _ ...       622.3
 439.9
 515.7
 Increase ---------.119.7                    75.8
 These figures show that whereas the in-
 crease of goods and services produced from
 1960 through 1984 was valued at $119.7 bll-
 lion in current dollars, the same quantitative
 increase of output would have been valued at
 $75.8 billion if the purchasing power of the
 dollar had been the same in 1964 as it was
 in 1954.  Since we are dealing with the same
 quantity of product, the difference between
 the  two  measures   of  increased   value,
 amounting to $43.9 billion over the period,
 must be the result of depreciation of the
 dollar.  In other words, some 40 percent of
 the increase in gross national product since
 1960 does not represent greater actual out-
 put of goods and services but an inflationary
 markup of real product.
 It is proper to ask at this point why there
 is so much divergence between the results
 revealed by the price indexes cited above
 and those derived from the GNP data.  A
 clue to the explanation is provided by the
 behavior of the components of GNP.  The
 annual Economic Report regularly translated
 these components from current dollars into
 the equivalent in 1954 dollars.  The report
 also provides a table showing, for each com-
 ponent of GNP, the implicit price deflator
 by which its current dollar value is to be de-
 flated to equal the  1954 value.  For  1964
 these price deflators are as follows:
 Implicit
 Category:                          price deflator
 Total GNP------------------------ 120.7
 Personal consumption  expendi-
 ture------------------------ 114.9
 Durable goods ----------------- 106.2
 Nondurable goods____ _________ 116.6
 Services----------------------- 122.7
 Gross  private  domestic Invest-
 ment :
 New construction-------------- 125.7
 Residential nonfarm ----------- 122.0
 Other------------------------- 130.2
 Export of goods and services---- 105.6
 Imports of goods and services--__  98.2
 Government purchases  of goods
 and services----------------- 138.5
 Federal--------------------- 136.0
 State and local---------------- 141.3
 These figures suggest that the rise in the
 cost of services has been an important factor
 in the inflation of GNP in terms of con-
 stant 1954 dollars.  The implicit deflators are
 highest, indicating need for relatively more
 deflation, for the components in which serv-
 ices are the sole, or a principal, element.
 Much of the construction industry is labor
 intensive, while export Industries are more
 likely to be capital intensive.  Almost 70 per-
 cent of Government purchases of goods and
 services consist of wage and salary disburse-
 ments.   Moreover, the proportion of total
 consumption expenditure devoted to services
 has risen somewhat in the post-World War
 II years. The wholesale price index includes
 commodities only and would not reflect serv-
 ices. The Consumer Price Index does Include
 services, and from December 1960 to Novem-
 ber 1964 the index for all services except
 rent rose by 10.5 index points.  This is in
 marked contrast with the movement of the
 overall Consumer Price Index.

 for employers, private and public, to comply
 with the successive rounds of demands for
 higher pay.  This should have led to price
 increases, but the Government's hostile at-
 titude toward anything more than trivial,
 spotty price advances has blocked off this
 course.  Productivity gains have thus far en-
 abled efficient operators to absorb the higher
 wage costs without raising prices.  Despite
 the guidelines for wage increases proposed
 by the Council of Economic Advisers there
 is some doubt If wage increases have been
 held within the suggested limits.  The eco-
 nomic report shows that output per man-
 hour in nonagricultural industries Increased
 at an average rate of 3 percent per year from
 1960 through 1964, and that average gross
 weekly earnings in manufacturing increased
 at a rate of 4.7 percent annually over the
 same period.
 It is not contended here that the round
 of tax cut and deficit spending coming up in
 the excise tax repealer is the one to carry
 the inflation flood over the dike.  The com-
 bination of creating new money and sitting
 on the price lid may hold the opposing forces
 in equilibrium for some time yet.  Even-.
 tually the accumulation of inflationary new
 money will have an expansionary force that
 cannot be contained by any display of gov-
 ernmental displeasure at price increases.
 There may be a short-run advantage in
 excise tax repeal.  The business community
 and the man in the street are enthusiastic-
 ally for it.  This broad grassroots support
 seems already to have pressured congres-
 sional leaders to go even further than the
 President has recommended.  It can be said,
 however, without fear of successful contra-
 diction, that the long-run advantage to the
 Treasury, the business interests, and the peo-
 ple generally, is to be found in reform, not
 elimination of excise or consumption taxes as
 a source of Federal revenue.
 TRAFFIC  VIOLATIONS  BY  DIPLO-
 MATIC PERSONNEL
 Mr. CASE.  Mr. President, in this
 morning's press I note a report, under
 the dateline of New Brunswick, N.J., of
 a meeting between the director of the
 New Jersey Turnpike Authority and a
 representative of the Department of
 State in regard to a recent practice in-
 augurated by the New Jersey Turnpike
 Authority to escort from the turnpike
 diplomats who are violating the speed
 laws.
 This incident is another illustration
 of a problem which I think we have not
 come anywhere near solving.  I regard
 any American who represents this coun-
 try abroad and who violates the laws of
 another country as a person who ought
 not to be continued in the representa-
 tion of this country abroad.                                                                                                                                  Equally,
 any foreign diplomat or representative-
 and it Is not always one of high station,
 but frequently one of lower rank-who
 comes here and violates the hospitality
 which this country affords, whether it be
 parking by a fire hydrant or by blocking
 another'sdriveway, and laughing at that
 person when he is asked to move, to say
 nothing of the violation of speed laws
 and other traffic laws which cause hazard
 to American and other lives on the high-
 ways, ought not to be permitted to con-
 tinue to remain in this country.
