 VIETNAM
 Progress in drafting South Vietnam's election regula-
 tions may increase the pressure on Premier Ky and
 Chief of State Thieu to settle their rival presiden-
 tial ambitions.  Several skirmishes in South Vietnam's
 northern provinces have punctuated a relative lull in
 the fighting.   The Communists'  use of the road net-
 work in the Laotian panhandle is increasing,  and
 there was intensified air activity over the Hanoi-
 Haiphong area.
 NEW COMMUNIST PUSH POSSIBLE IN LAOS
 There are indications that the Communists are prepar-
 ing a new drive against key government positions in
 the northeast.
 CONTINUED INSTABILITY IN CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP
 The apparent fall of five more politburo members
 leaves only seven active members of the 25-man group
 installed last August,  and apparently less than one
 third of the central committee's members are still in
 good standing.
 INDONESIAN-CHINESE RELATIONS DECLINE SHARPLY
 The latest round of incidents culminated in the ex-
 pulsion by each country of high Chinese and Indonesian
 diplomats.
 PAK LIKELY TO BE RE-ELECTED IN SOUTH KOREA
 President Pak Chong-hui has stature as a national
 :Leader and a well-oiled political machine behind him.
 His main opponent has not managed to capitalize on

 FAR EAST
 The intensification of American air attacks on
 targets in the Hanoi-Haiphong area so far has drawn
 no major political reaction from the Communist
 powers.   Neither Peking nor Hanoi has publicly
 acknowledged the strikes against two North Viet-
 namese air bases,  although both regimes have issued
 highly exaggerated claims of US air losses.   A
 Chinese Foreign Ministry statement was confined to
 repeating the noncommittal theme of China's readi-
 ness to make "maximum national sacrifices" in sup-
 porting Hanoi.
 As the Constituent Assembly in Saigon prepares
 to deliberate on electoral laws,   supporters of
 civilian and military presidential candidates are
 battling for the most advantageous terms.   Pro-
 military members are seeking to block a provision
 requiring a runoff election between the two candi-
 dates with the largest pluralities.   Chief of State
 Thieu continues to defer his decision on whether to
 bid for the military nomination for the presidency.
 There are no signs of an early break in the
 impasse in China.   Despite recent efforts by the
 Mao-Lin faction to display confidence and success,
 it has made little progress in restoring the shat-
 tered governing apparatus in the provinces, most of
 which remain under the control of military command-
 ers.   The fundamental political instability in
 Peking is reflected by the fact that only seven
 politburo members remain active out of the 25-man
 group installed last August.   Moreover,  less than
 one third of the central committee members are
 still in good standing.
 Sino-Indonesian relations have taken another
 sharp decline.   Growing harassment of the Indonesian
 Embassy in Peking suggests that the Chinese are
 prepared to risk a diplomatic break. Djakarta, how-
 ever,  probably wishes to avoid a complete rupture,
 '
 s
 primarily because of its effect on Indonesia
 din   as a nonaligned nation.

 VIETNAM
 The work of drafting South
 Vietnam's national election regu-
 lations is now under way in the
 Constituent Assembly.   This may
 increase the pressure on Premier
 Ky and Chief of State Thieu to
 come to terms over their rival
 presidential ambitions.
 Thieu reportedly believes
 that selection of a military can-
 didate should be deferred until
 the laws are completed.   Since
 completion is possible by mid-
 May,  it appears that he cannot
 much longer avoid a decision
 whether or not to run.
 Ky for his part, has re-
 sorted to a number of devices.
 designed to skirt a direct con-
 frontation with Thieu and still
 convince him to defer to Ky.  r
 orma  military vote.                   Several
 of the top generals probably re-
 main divided in their loyalties
 and all are aware of the disad-
 vantages of openly taking sides.
 So far, both Ky and Thieu have
 been reluctant to call upon them
 to decide the question.
 Outside the Military, Ky con-
 tinues to enlist support amonq
 the multifarious political and
 religious organizations that could
 act as the basis of a civilian
 political front for his candidacy.
 A recent poll of students in Hue
 and Saigon,  in which Ky emerged
 as the favored choice over Thieu,
 is being used as evidence to con-
 vince military officers, espe-
 cially those close to Thieu, of
 the logic of Ky's candidacy.
 one ot   y s supporters is stra-
 tegically placed at the head of
 the Constituent Assembly subcom-
 tion in the flamboyant style of
 K   but
 mittee that is drafting the presi-
 ential election laws.
 Despite Ky's drive to become
 the military candidate, Thieu is
 apparently still in the running.
 Thieu has not pursued the nomina-
 e wou    accept
 the candidacy if it came as a
 clear mandate from the Director-
 ate or the Armed Forces Congress.
 Since Ky evidently does not be-
 lieve that such a mandate for
 Thieu will be forthcoming, his
 impatience with Thieu's continued
 procrastination appears to be in-
 creasing.

 have punctuated a relative lull
 in fighting.   US Marine and other
 allied forces launched three new
 battalion and larger size search-
 and-destroy operations in this
 area,  and a new phase of long-
 term Operation PRAIRIE was begun.
 immediately below the Demili-
 tarized Zone  (DMZ).
 Unconfirmed reports of Com-
 munist plans for additional at-
 tacks on Quang Tri city and on
 flue,  as well as on various dis-
 trict headquarters, continue to
 be received.   In addition,  a
 North Vietnamese Army defector in
 Quang Ngai Province has stated
 that Communist forces in the
 southern part of I Corps intend
 to coordinate their attacks with
 those of North Vietnamese troops
 in the DMZ - Quang Tri  - Thua
 Thien area.
 Further evidence of a build-
 up in the A Shau Valley of west-
 ern Thua Thien Province and  in
 the adjacent Laotian panhandle
 area has been obtained.   TT ucks,
 trailers,  and quantities of oil
 or gasoline drums have been
 sighted at two abandoned airfields
 at A Shau  and A Luoi.   Truck  traf-
 fi.c nearly three miles southeast
 of A Shau may indicate that  Route
 548--which is joined to motorable
 Route  922 from Laos--is being im-
 proved and extended southward.
 The reported positioning of troops
 near the main trail eastward from
 A Shau toward Hue suggests that
 the Communists may intend to im-
 prove the trail.
 Laos Panhandle Activity
 Communist use of the road
 network in the Laos panhandle is
 i_ncreasir.U.   Supplies handled by
 this network since last October
 appear greater than during any
 previous dry season.   Preliminary
 estimates  indicate  that by June,
 when the season ends, over 20,000
 tons of supplies may have been
 brought  into Laos  from North Viet-
 nam by the Mu G:;_a Pass route alone,
 with an additional but unknown
 quantity brought in by way of Route
 912.   In comparison, total supplies
 brought. into the panhandle from
 North Vietnam during the 1965-66
 dry season are estimated at about
 1.7,000 tons,  and for the 1964-65
 season at  7,000 tons.
 Other supplies, principally
 foodstuffs,   also have been trans-
 norted into the southern portion
 of the panhandle from Cambodia
 since late 1965                               25X1

 To ensure that the panhandle
 road network can cope with the
 growing burden placed upon it
 by the increased tonnage require-
 ment,                        as well as with stepped
 up US interdiction,  the Commu-
 nists have continued to improve
 it.   Route 165 has been extended
 eastward for about ten miles,
 reaching almost to the South Viet-
 namese border.   Intensive by-
 pass construction also has been
 completed on key portions of the
 network south of Mu Gia Pass.
 In addition, projects in antici-
 pation of the rainy season--due
 in about a month--recently have
 been observed along sections of
 Routes 23,  92,  96,  and 110.   These
 measures, which include the
 corduroying of road segments and
 the construction of bypasses
 over high ground,  appear to be
 more widespread then in previous
 years.   If the Communists con-
 tinue these intensified prepara-
 tions against flood over the next
 several. weeks and if repair crews
 are kept on the job throughout
 the monsoon period,  they may be
 able for the first time to main-
 tain a significant level of truck
 traffic throughout the panhandle
 during a rainy season.
 North Vietnam Military
 US pilots reported that all
 North Vietnamse air defense ele-
 ments were exceptionally active
 and aggressive throughout the
 past week of raids against major
 military and industrial targets
 in the Hanoi-Haiphong area.   The
 fact that US planes were striking
 MIG airfields and other key tar-
 gets at the center of North Viet-
 nam's air defense system accounts,
 in part,  for the unusually high
 level of MIG activity, missile
 launches,  and AAA fire.
 The air defense system downed
 16 US aircraft during this period.
 Missiles and ground fire accounted
 for five aircraft each, while
 four planes were lost to MIGs and
 two to unknown causes.  At least   25X1
 two MIG-l7s and a MIG-21 were
 shot down in an unprecedented num-
 ber of air battles.

 NEW COMMUNIST PUSH POSSIBLE IN LAOS
 The Communists may be preparing
 a new drive against key government
 positions in northeastern Laos.   In
 early April,  Pathet Lao and North
 Vietnamese units dislodged progov-
 ernment forces from Nong Khang,  an
 observation and harassment outpost
 near Sam Neua town.   Nong Khanq had
 withstood a concerted attack in Jan-
 uary.   Its capture increases the
 likelihood that other guerrilla.
 bases behind Communist lines,  such
 as Na Khang and Phou Pha Ti, will be

 of rainy weather in the next few

 that a build-up around these bases is
 already under way.

 Small-scale Communist gains have
 occurred regularly during recent dry
 seasons,  but government troops and
 guerrilla forces have retaken such
 posts with equal regularity during
 the monsoons.
 Elsewhere in northern Laos,  in-
 creased Communist trucking along
 Route 7 west of Ban Ban raises the
 possibility of stepped-up guerrilla
 activity in the Plain of Jars area.
 About 18 trucks per day have been
 observed moving westward recently,
 roughly  double  the January-March
 average, but far Less than the more
 than 90 trucks per day observed mov-
 ing west along Route 7 in North Viet-
 nam in early April.   This intensive
 traffic, coupled with the relatively
 leisurely transport activity inside
 Laos,  suggests a Communist effort to
 stockpile supplies in a known,  ex-
 tensive forward area for gradual
 transfer onward during the rainy
 season.
 In the south, General Phasouk,
 regional Laotian Army commander,  re-
 cently renewed a clearing operation
 near Lao Ngam on the edge of the
 Bolovens plateau.   Although little
 fighting has yet ensued,  the  opera-
 tion is notable because of the partici-
 pation of elements of a neutralist
 unit,  GM 802.   This force,  long based
 in the north at Muong Soui,  is led by
 Colonel Sing, one of the officers who
 ousted neutralist commander Kong Le
 last year.   The use of these airlifted
 troops in the Lao Ngam operation may
 provide an early indication that prog-
 ress                                                                   has  been made toward the even-
 tual integration of neutralist forces
 into the Laotian Army command struc-
 ture.

 CONTINUED INSTABILITY IN CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP
 The apparent fall in the
 past month of five more polit-
 buro members has reduced to seven
 the number of active members left
 out of the 25-man group installed
 last August.   The central commit-
 tee itself has fared no better;
 apparently less than one third of
 its members are still in good
 standing.   Despite the Mao-Lin
 factions efforts to display con-
 fidence and success,  it has made
 little progress toward restoring
 the shattered governing apparatus
 in the provinces, most of which
 are now under the control of mili-
 tary commanders.   Even the new
 "revolutionary committee"  just
 formed in the Peking municipality
 is dominated by the same officials
 who have been running the city
 since January.
 The Continuing Purge
 Recent public appearances of
 leaders suggest that the working
 team just below the ruling trium-
 virate                            of Mao Tse-tung,  Lin Piao,
 and Chou En-lai has been reduced
 to a handful of propagandists,
 two policemen,  one economist,  and
 two military men.   This group at-
 tended a major rally in Peking
 on 20 April,  and accompanied Mao
 and Lin in one of their rare pub-
 lic appearances on 24 April when
 they received provincial officials.
 Propaganda treatment of these
 events indicates an intention to
 display leaders currently in good
 standing.    Five politburo members
 recently criticized by Red Guards
 were absent,  suggesting they are
 now in disfavor.   They are Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi, economic special-
 ists Tan Chen-lin and Li Hsien-
 nien,  and two vice chairmen of
 the Military Affairs Committee--
 Hsu Hsiang-chien and Yeh Chien-
 ving.   Chen Yi, however,  continues
 to perform his official functions
 and made a speech at a reception
 given by the Tanzanian ambassador
 on 26 April.
 Of the 25 men installed in
 the politburo last August, only
 Mao, Lin, Chou,  and four others
 are still clearly in good stand-
 ing.   In the past year,  the cen-
 tral committee has been hit by a
 purge of Stalinist proportions.
 It has 173 full and alternate mem-
 bers, but about 42 were unimportant
 (old or already out of favor)  be-
 fore the Cultural Revolution.
 Of the remaining 131,  65 have come
 under heavy attack,  the status of
 38 is uncertain,  and only 28 are
 clearly in good standing.
 One recent addition to the
 list of prominent leaders is Yeh
 Chun, believed to be Lin Piao's
 wife.   Until last summer, Yeh
 Chun,  like Madame Mao, had been
 in relative obscurity.   She first
 began showing up in elite turn-
 outs of leaders on 25 March,  and
 attended the rally on 20 April
 as a member of the army's Cultural
 Revolution Group.   The role of
 Madame Mao and Madame Lin pre-
 sumably is to represent their
 husbands at meetings which they
 themselves do not attend.   The

 Peking and the Provinces
 The "revolutionary committee"
 inaugurated to run Peking city on
 20 April will be dominated by t.h-ie
 same military and security offi-
 cials who have been running the
 capital for months.   Its chairman
 is Minister of Public Security
 Hsieh Fu-chih,  and two of its
 four vice chairmen are ranking
 officers of the Peking Garrison
 Command.   The other vice chair-
 men are former party secretary Wu
 Te and a "revolutionary"  student
 leader--included to show that the
 committee is adopting the approved
 Maoist principle of forming a
 "three-way alliance."

 paring for the new committee,  it
