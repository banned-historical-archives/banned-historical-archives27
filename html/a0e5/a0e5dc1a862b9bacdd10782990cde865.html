 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 Communist exploitation of
 the anti-Dutch drive in Indo-
 nesia apparently is forcing the
 government   to  move      faster
 against Dutch enterprises than
 it had planned.   On 2 December
 members of the Communist-led
 labor federation SOBSI without
 government santion occupied or
 established harassing surveil-
 lance over the Djakarta offices
 of at least seven large Dutch
 firms.   To date, they have re-
 linquished only one of them--
 KPM, the interisland shipping
 firm--to official security forces.
 The government  has  an-
 nounced it will take over these
 firms,   When  Prime Minister
 Djuanda announced on 3 December
 that  drastic action would be
 taken against the workers if
 they undertook to seize the
 firms permanently, minor SOBSI
 officials  allegedly  demanded
 participation in the companies'
 management.
 The government has ordered
 specific groups of Dutch nation-
 als expelled and the                closing
 of the seven Dutch consulates
 outside Djakarta.   The departure
 of the Dutch  will leave a vacu-
 um that the government will be
 forced to fill by   accepting
 other foreign assistance.  The
 combination of leftist influ-
 ence in the government  and
 President Sukarno's intense an-
 ti-Dutch feelings, which may be
 extended to other Western na-
 tions, make it increasingly
 likely that Indonesia will turn
 to the Sino-Soviet bloc.
 In addition to the Soviet
 $100,000,000 loan  which  is
 awaiting implementation,  the
 USSR,
 has offered to supply
 ships to Indonesia, and has re-
 quested permission of the Indo-
 nesian government to hold an
 atomic exposition in Indonesia
 in 1958.   The Indonesian gov-
 ernment is believed to have ap-
 proached the USSR on the pos-
 sibility of purchasing rice,
 and the second shipment of So-
 viet jeeps, under a contract
 for the purchase of 4,000, has
 just arrived at the port of
 Surabaya.
 The growing consensus in
 Djakarta is that President Su-
 karno  will react to  the at-
 tempt on his  life by retaliat-
 ing against persons and groups
 which have opposed his policies.
 Such action would be likely to
 result in Sukarno's closer as-
 sociation with the leftists and
 would harden the opposition
 of regional leaders.
 The national reconstruction
 conference, which concluded on
 4 December, was regarded by dis-
 affected regional leaders as of
 little value.
 [they w     re-
 turn to their provinces feeling
 it is useless to try to effect
 changes in the Djakarta govern-
 ment or in Sukarno's policies.
 They claim they will concentrate
 their efforts on local recon-
 struction in an effort to further
 develop economic autonomy.
 In South Sumatra, where an
 anti-Communist army regime has
 been  in control for the  past
 year, the  Communists  again
 scored gains in some localities
 in the  1 December  elections.
 These gains appear to be limited
 to oil centers where SOBSI-af-
 fil ated unions are strong.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 With the approach of the
 NATO conference in Paris on
 16-18 December, Soviet official
 spokesmen and propagandists
 have stepped up their campaign
 to exploit differences between
 NATO members and to arouse fears
 among Westerners.   Moscow's
 objective is to generate popu-
 lar anxiety which will induce
 NATO governments to postpone
 any decisions to strengthen
 Western unity and defense un-
 til Soviet intentions can be
 explored in a new round of
 high-level East-West talks.
 Soviet party chief Khrushchev,
 in his 40th anniversary speech
 on 6 November, set the theme
 with his charge that the Paris
 meeting "bodes no good for the
 cause of peace."
 Moscow's divisive propa-
 ganda efforts have centered on a
 claimed crisis within the At-
 lantic pact community.   This
 crisis has allegedly been
 brought on by "imperialist con-
 tradictions" and growing un-
 easiness in the West in the
 face of the Kremlin's charges
 that recent Soviet successes
 in the scientific and techni-
 cal fields have caused a shift
 in the East-West balance of
 power.
 Soviet propaganda on NATO
 since the launching of the
 sputniks has tried to picture
 the Atlantic alliance as an out-
 moded organization which is in-
 capable of halting the march
 of history and restoring the
 past.   Considerable effort has
 been devoted by using quota-
 tions from Western publications,
 to demonstrate that there is
 a state of nervousness over
 possible failure of the Paris
 meeting because of a European
 loss of confidence in America's
 ability to win a war with the
 USSR.   French reaction to the
 Anglo-American shipment of arms
 to Tunisia was seized on as
 visible proof of the "imperial-
 ist contradictions" threatening
 the solidarity of the Atlantic
 community and was exploited in
 broadcasts to the smaller NATO
 members to demonstrate that
 the United States and Britain
 were willing to sacrifice their
 alliances with France in order
 to oust the French from North
 Africa.
 Soviet propagandists have
 devoted considerable effort to
 exploiting latent fears among
 Western European nations of a
 revenge-seeking West Germany,
 rearmed and supported by the
 United States.   Non-German
 audiences have been told that
 West Germany has been pressing
 for a greater role in the manage-
 ment of NATO affairs and that
 the question of equipping the
 West German army with atomic
 rocket weapons will be discussed
 at the Paris meeting.  German
 audiences, on the other hand,
 have been warned that the Fed-
 eral Republic will become an
 atomic powder keg and would be
 subjected to immediate and dev-
 astating  counterblows if "Ger-
 man militarists" were to unleash
 a war.
 Khrushchev, as well as So-
 viet commentators, has threatened
 the European members of NATO
 with destruction in a future
 war and predicted that sentiment
 in countries with American bases
 would turn against NATO as their
 peoples realize that "Soviet
 counterblows" would follow an
 attack on the USSR.   In the most
 recent such statement, Soviet
 Premier Bulganin claimed on 2
 December that the NATO meeting
 will "put the finishing touches
 to new programs in the armaments
 race" and "preparations for
 war."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Border tensions between
 Israel and Jordan appear to
 have eased momentarily as a re-
 sult of UN Secretary General
 HammarskJold's efforts.  An
 Israeli  truck  convoy  passed
 through Jordanian territory on
 5 December  to supply  the  Is-
 raeli positions  on Mt. Scopus,
 and press  reports state that
 it carried  gasoline, the item
 disputed  by  the Jordanians.
 The terms of the agreement
 achieved  by Hammarskjold  are
 not yet  known.   It.is very un-
 likely that this agreement, ap-
 parently                    resolving  the  im-
 mediate issue, will lead to any
 significant  progress on other
 border problems.
 The Syrians       seemed  last
 week to be whipping up another,
 if less dangerous, anti-Turkish
 campaign.  Rallies  in  many
 places in Syria were staged to
 lament the loss  to Turkey of
 Alexandretta, which  was ceded
 by France during the period of
 French mandatory control over
 Syria.  Turkey  continues  to
 be seriously concerned by what
 it regards as the trend in Syr-
 ia of becoming a Soviet satel-
 lite, but apparently hopes that
 moderate  elements  among the
 Arab states may still be able
 to force some shift of Syrian
 policy.   Marshal Bulganin's 25
 November warning letter to An-
 kara failed to disturb Turkish
 leaders any more than the pre-
 vious Soviet note.
 Egypt's minister of in-
 dustry was scheduled to meet on
 4 December with the Soviet am-
 bassador in Cairo to "prepare
 details" for the economic talks
 a 40-man Egyptian delegation
 expects to carry  on in Moscow
 as a follow-up to the $178,-
 000,000 Soviet-Egyptian line
 of credit agreement.  According
 to the Egyptian announcement,
 Cairo intends to "present" to
 the USSR 54 projects with an
 estimated foreign currency cost
 of about $164,000,000--some
 $14,000,000 less than the So-
 viet Union has agreed to provide,.
 The portion of the cost of
 these projects to be paid for
 in Egyptian currency is about
 $123,000,000, and Egyptian
 Finance Minister Kaysuni is
 reported to be concerned over
 where this money will come from,
 particularly if, as some  of
 Nasir's advisers are urging,
 the Egyptian Five-Year Plan
 (1958-1962) is compressed into
 three years.  Moreover, these
 projects represent only a part
 of Egypt's whole plan, for which
 the total foreign currency costs
 alone are estimated by  the
 Egyptians at about $430,500,000.
 The Soviet agreement would cover
 but a little over 40 percent of
 this sum.  These figures suggest
 one of the reasons why spokes-
 men for the Nasir regime continue
 to insist that the door remains
 open for Western aid.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 MIKHAIL SUSLOV'S ROLE IN RECENT MOSCOW MEETINGS
 Soviet party presidium mem-
 ber Suslov's leading role in
 the recent Moscow meetings of
 Communist party leaders has in-
 creased speculation regarding
 his personal power and politi-
 cal intentions vis-a-vis Khru-
 shchev.
 Suslov's chief responsibility
 for the last several years has
 been relations with the satel-
 lites and other Communist parties.
 His extensive travels and con-
 ferences within the Communist
 bloc indicate that he was well
 qualified to  chair  the  bloc
 meeting.
 However, Suslov's capabili-
 ties extend to a number of fields.
 He has been at various times a
 responsible official in the
 party control commission, first
 secretary of party oblast com-
 mittees, a leading member of
 the North Caucasus military coun-
 cil, lecturer in political econ-
 omy, chief of the Propaganda and
 Agitation Administration of the
 party central committee, editor
 of Pravda, and head of the cen-
 tral committee Department for
 Liaison with Foreign Communist

 parties.   His extensive remarks
 at the 20th party congress on
 party organizational work indi-
 cate he may also have exercised
 supervision over party person-
 nel work during a period prior
 to July 19 55.
 Suslov became a secretary
 of the party central committee
 in 1948; he thus has seniority
 on that body over Khrushchev,
 who became a secretary in 1949
 and first secretary in 1953.
 Khrushchev may have arranged
 Suslov's transfer from super-
 vision of Soviet party person-
 nel to full-time responsibility
 for foreign Communist parties
 to eliminate any opportunity
 for Suslov to build up his own
 support within the Soviet party.
 There have been no indica-

 or interviews that he is in dis-
 SINO-SOVIET MILITARY
 Communist China's 12-man
 delegation of top  military
 leaders concluded its  talks
 with Soviet  officials  on 30
 November and  has returned to
 Peiping.   Both Moscow and Pei-
 ping have avoided explicit com-
 ment on the visit, but                  the
 Russians appear to have made
 firm commitments for new mili-
 tary aid to the Chinese.   The
 close understandings reached
 by Mao Tse-tung and Soviet
 leaders during the 40th an-
 niversary celebrations in early
 November paved the way for this
 development.
 In a speech made before
 the Chinese delegation on 27
 November, Soviet Defense Min-
 is':er Malinovsky declared Mos-
 cow's willingness to "transmit
 our experience in the building
 up of armed forces to our Chi-
 agreement with post-Stalin pol-
 icies.  At the June central
 committee plenum, Suslov re-
 portedly took the chair  and
 directed the  meeting against
 the "antiparty" group; and the
 variety of his activities dur-
 ing the late summer and early
 fall of this year indicate that
 he was probably left in charge,
 with Mikoyan, while the other
 top leaders were away  from
 Moscow.
 Khrushchev may be present-
 ing Suslov to the foreign Com-
 munists as a "Stalinist" bogy
 man whom he must conciliate.
 In this way Khrushchev may
 hope to weaken  Suslov as  a
 rival and gain satellite sup-
 port for himself personally,
 while using Suslov's abilities
 to  maintain  effective  So-
 viet  leadership  in  the bloc.
 TALKS CONCLUDED
 nese friends."  Premier Bulganin
 told the delegation on 30 No-
 vember the USSR would continue
 to strengthen the "defensive
 preparedness" of the Soviet and
 Chinese armed forces.
 The areas and installations
 visited by the Chinese military
 group provide no insight into
 the specific types of military
 equipment that may be involved.
 They watched naval maneuvers
 at Leningrad and visited local
 commands at Minsk,  Kiev,  Tbilisi,
 Vladivostok, and Khabarovsk.
 They are not known to have gone
 to any installations associated
 with missile or nuclear weapons
 testing, although they had time
 during their Transcaucasus tour
 to visit missile centers such
 as that at Kapustin Yar.

 reached after three months of
 negotiations during which both
 sides  compromised on  several
 points, stipulates a trade tar-
 get of approximately $30,000,-
 000 each way.  They also              will
 sign a  five-year  commercial
 treaty, an agreement to exchange
 trade missions, and  an accord
 on most-favored-nation treat-
 ment.
 The trade goal established
 in the primary agreement is ap-
 proximately ten times larger
 than Soviet-Japanese trade  in
 1956 and thus, although Soviet-
 Japanese trade is expanding
 this year, the goal may not be
 attained the first year.  Pres-
 sure within Japan for imports
 from the USSR is not great and
 many businessmen admittedly are
 suspicious of trade relations
 with the USSR as a result of
 past experiences.  The Soviet
 Union will probably try to im-
 plement fully its side of the
 agreement in order to sustain
 its assertion that the trade
 volume can eventually reach
 $500,000,000.  The one-year
 agreement is renewable annually
 and new trade goals probably
 will be established in the light
 of the first year's results.
 Accounts are to be settled in
 pounds sterling, although Tokyo
 granted a Soviet request that
 individual barter transactions
 be permitted.
 The commercial treaty lists
 items to be traded by each side.
 The list of  Japanese exports
 includes heavy industrial prod-
 ucts, textiles, chemicals, and
 sundries, while Soviet exports
 include mineral ores, coal,
 lumber, and oil.  The Soviet
 negotiators showed particular
 interest in Japanese industrial
 and farm machinery, rolling
 stock, ships, and iron and steel
 products.
 The most-favored-nation
 provision appears to be one of
 principle only, except for cer-
 tain tax exemptions.  Both na-
 tions reserve the right to re-
 strict imports from the other
 should an imbalance or shortage
 of foreign exchange occur, and
 the USSR consented to honor
 Japan's adherence to COCOM con-
 trols.

 The size of trade missions
 to be exchanged has not been re-
 vealed, but it has been agreed
 that the mission chief and two
 deputies on each side would be
 accorded full diplomatic priv-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 December 1957
 Basic internal East German
 policy has been recast--prob-
 ably with Soviet approval and
 at Party First Secretary Ul-
 bricht's instigation--in the
 direction of a harder course
 aimed at the more rapid commu-
 nization of the German Democrat-
 ic Republic (GDR).   The deci-
 sion to adopt a tougher line
 was probably arrived at during
 the Khrushchev-Mikoyan visit
 last August.   As tougher poli-
 cies are implemented, tensions
 will probably increase through-
 out the country, but the pres-
 ence of impressive Soviet mili-
 tary strength is likely to prove
 sufficient to deter overt anti-
 regime demonstrations on a large
 scale.
 Reports of actions to be
 taken at the forthcoming 35th
 plenum of the Socialist Unity
 (Communist) party (SED), to-
 gether with other evidence, in-
 dicate that the stepped-up push
 toward greater communization
 will emphasize further repres-
 sion, coupled with drives for
 increased production at lower
 cost.   It has been reported
 that work norms in many indus-
 tries are to be revised upward
 and wages cut.   Pressures for
 greater agricultural production
 are to be combined with an in-
 tensification of agricultural
 collectivization and efforts to
 compel young people to become
 farmers.   Private craftsmen
 and businessmen are to be sub-
 jected to pressures aimed at
 forcing them into cooperative
 production associations.
 Other measures  to  be
 stressed in the communization
 drive are harsher punishments
 for all crimes; further sup-
 pression of criticism of Com-
 munism; improved political in-
 doctrination in educational in-
 stitutions and the armed forces,
 including an improvement of
 teachers' political reliability;
 and a general overhaul of the
 party apparatus aimed at achiev-
 ing greater efficiency.   Further-
 more, youths will be subjected
 to even greater controls, with
 the party directing the use of
 "free" time and vacations for
 productive work.
 The re-emphasis on a Sta-
 linist approach to East German
 problems probably reflects a
 determination by the USSR to com-
 pel East Germany to make a
 greater contribution to bloc
 economic self-sufficiency.   East
 Germany may be expected to re-
 pay the credits it has received
 from the USSR and catch up on
 its lagging export commitments
 to the Soviet Union and the
 bloc.   Since efforts to increase
 production by raising work norms
 are likely to step up the flow
 of refugees to the West, the
 regime must impose greater con-
 trols on freedom  of  movement
 in order to curb the flight
 of sorely needed workers if
 higher production goals are to
 be met.   Fears of impending
 restrictions have already re-
 sulted in a sharp increase in
 the number of refugees--about
 1,200 above normal last week.
 The Russians have also
 probably concluded that even the
 limited liberalization following
 the Soviet 20th party congress
 unleashed too many dissident
 forces
 and
 therefore have de-
 cided
 that
 the only possible
 course
 is
 harsher repression
 under
 the
 Stalinist Ulbricht.
 When Ulbricht implements these
 tough measures, however,  they
 are likely to generate tension
 which could erupt into at least
 isolated instances of disorder.
 It was just such measures which
 led to the riots of 17 June 1953.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 December 1957
 POLES INTERPRET MOSCOW DECLARATION
 Polish party leader Go-
 mulka's interpretation of the
 12-nation Communist declaration
 signed in Moscow last month dif-
 fers markedly from those of So-
 viet and East German party lead-
 ers.   His comment at a party
 activists' meeting on 28 Novem-
 ber that the declaration spoke
 the languages of 12 parties and
 was therefore subject to as many
 interpretations suggests that
 he intends to continue many of
 the policies developed specifi-
 cally for Poland since October
 19 56 .
 Gomulka's interpretation
 of the declaration probably was
 aimed in part at holding the
 allegiance of those elements
 within his party who might have
 been concerned over his adher-
 ence to a document which on the
 surface appeared to compromise
 the Polish position.  Gomulka
 told his party that its main
 hope of salvation and for con-
 tinuance of its new policies--
 accepted only "in principle"
 by fraternal parties--is first
 to prove their validity in Po-
 land, making it a prime example
 of the development of Communism
 via, a "separate road."
 He has thus called for a
 tightening of discipline in the
 party to enable it to take the
 leading role in the life of the
 country.   Though this "leading
 role" is required as a basic
 principle of Communism,  it will
 not be "the dogmatic conception
 of the leading role of the Com-
 munist party," which Gomulka
 claimed "inflicted great damage"
 on the unity of the Communist
 parties in the past.
 Indicative of the consider-
 able degree of ambiguity of
 language that apparently was
 necessary in order to satisfy
 the various parties before they
 signed the 12-nation declaration
 are the differences of emphasis
 now given to it by the Polish
 leader and the USSR.   In one of
 the first Soviet interpretations
 of the declaration, Soviet party
 presidium member Furtseva em-
 phasized to party activists on
 27 November that the agreement
 represented recognition of So-
 viet leadership of the orbit
 Communist parties.
 Gomulka,  in contrast, placed
 most emphasis on the independ-
 ence of each party in internal
 affairs.  Furtseva stressed that
 collective settlement had re-
 solved all matters in dispute
 between Communist parties, while
 Gomulka maintained that there
 was continuing disagreement
 among them.
 The dangers of "revision-
 ism"--pressure for more liberal
 policies--were stressed by Fur-
 tseva.  Although Gomulka agreed
 that "revisionism" presently
 constituted the major danger, he
 called the document a strong in-
 dictment of "dogmatism," i.e.,
 Stalinism.   Furtseva placed
 special significance on common
 factors of Communist develop-
 ment, while Gomulka. emphasized
 the recognition of the impor-
 tance of national peculiarities.
 Furtseva implied a need for
 greater militance in the world
 Communist movement, contrasting
 sharply with Gomulka's promising
 picture of peaceful and inevi-
 table development of socialism
 in all countries, which suggests
 no need for militance in world
 Communism, but rather a less
 dangerous policy of watchful
 waiting.
 Gomulka further demonstrated
 his differences with Moscow by
 his inclusion of Yugoslavia among
 the "13 states building Commu-
 nism                                                             who "belong to the family
 of socialist countries."  He may
 also have been motivated by his

 reported disillusionment with
 Chinese Communist leader Mao.
 He probably no longer believes
 he can depend on Mao for support
 on matters beyond the letter of
 the declaration.   He stood with
 Yugoslavia in strongly condemning
 both the Cominform and the Comin-
 tern,  and set forth two prere-
 quisites for any future multi-
 party meetings:   notification
 to participants of subjects for
 discussion,  and agreement to
 participation by independent
 vote of the various central
 committees.
 Gomulka defended Yugoslav
 and Polish acceptance of Western
 economic aid, specifically de-
 claring that the United States
 in offering aid did not put
 forth any conditions detrimental
 to Polish independence.   He
 warned,  however,  against those
 in the West who tried to demon-
 strate that all aid from both
 East and West was designed to
 promote political dependence.
 Varying versions of Polish
 broadcasts of the speech to
 Eastern and Western audiences
 were slanted to emphasize to
 the West Poland's adherence to
 Communism and to the East its
 determination to maintain a cer-
 tain degree of independence.
 Among Gomulka's deviations
 from the Soviet line was his
 virtual disclaimer of the pos-
 sibility of war between capital-
 ist nations.   He stated that the
 existence of an "enemy" social-
 ist camp unified capitalist na-
 tions in an anti-Communist bloc.
 Gomulka further said war
 between East and West would be
 a thermonuclear holocaust
 which,  though it would de-
 stroy capitalism, would ob-
 literate the achievements of
 all nations and make a cemetery
 of the entire world.   F_~      25X1

 LARGE INCREASE IN SOVIET RAIL TRACKAGE INDICATED
 An unprecedented rise in
 the rate of construction will
 be necessary if the USSR is to
 increase its rail transport net
 by 30 percent--about 21,600
 miles--in 13 years as predicted
 by T. S. Khachaturov,  a Soviet
 railway expert.   He wrote in
 the September issue of Economic
 Problems that the volume of
 transport would double between
 1955 and 1970, and that about
 1,800 miles of track would have
 to be built each year from 1961
 through 1970 for a 30-percent
 increase in trackage.   Only 720
 miles a year were scheduled under
 the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
 Soviet planners may believe
 the increases in output of basic
 commodities visualized by
 Khrushchev for 1972 dictate con-
 struction of this scope.   The
 present electrification and
 dieselization program, which
 should completely eliminate
 steam traction by 1970, will
 increase the traffic volume by
 permitting the use of faster
 and more powerful locomotives.
 In addition, the use of heavier
 rails, the provision of cars
 with greater carrying capacity,
 and expansion of the use of
 modern signaling systems will
 increase the efficiency and
 operating capabilities of the
 railways.   In a recent inter-
 view, Khachaturov emphasized
 the necessity of a substantial
 basic investment program for
 the railroads.
 No firm plans have been
 announced for construction be-
 yond 1960, but most of it will
 probably be in the eastern and
 northern regions.   Construction of
 of at least two major lines,
 the Amur-Yakutsk Railroad and
 the Polunochnoye-Labytnangi
 Railroad, through remote areas
 of permafrost and swampland
 has been suggested.   The tech-
 nical problems related to rail-
 road construction over perma-
 frost have already been solved

 The Laotian government,

 concerned about relations with
 the United States, and want to

 Laos' position.
 The carrying out of the

 slowly.   The  mixed military

 over the integration of 1,500

 allow time to prepare propaganda
 materials designed to have a
 maximum psychological impact on
 the local population.  A similar

 RACIAL ANIMOSITIES THREATEN MALAYA'S POLITICAL STABILITY
 Recent demonstrations of
 discontent among Malaya's large
 Chinese minority indicate that
 the postindependence  communal
 "honeymoon" may be coming to an
 end and that further interracial
 friction is to be expected. The
 strongest indication of  this
 prospect was the decisive de-
 feat of the  ruling Alliance
 party's candidate by  a left-
 winger of Ceylonese descent on
 23 November in a federal legis-
 lative council by-election in
 the tin-mining center of Ipoh
 in northern Malaya.
 The victorious candidate,
 D. R. Seenivasagam, a London-
 educated lawyer who is secre-
 tary general of  the  People's
 Progressive party,  openly ex-
 ploited Chinese fears of Malay
 domination.   His efforts were
 greatly facilitated by the re-
 cently initiated government pro-
 gram to eliminate                   Communist ag-
 itators in Chinese schools. The
 resulting protests by Chinese
 students led to riots and dem-
 onstrations in several key Ma-
 layan cities, the temporary
 closing of ten schools, expul-
 sion of some 70 students, and
 the arrest of more  than 30.
 There is little doubt that these
 government actions are inter-
 preted by a large portion of
 the Chinese population as a
 threat to Chinese culture rather
 than suppression of Communist
 activities.
 The election results and
 student riots probably  will
 lead to the development of an
 irresponsible and increasingly
 potent left-wing opposition in
 Malaya which will place a heavy
 strain on the delicately balanced
 Malay-Chinese political  co-
 operation within the Alliance
 party.

 These events, besides caus-
 ing Chinese discontent, appear
 to have aroused latent Malay
 animosity toward the Chinese.
 Prime Minister Abdul Rahman
 was booed for the first time
 in his political career by Chi-
 nese youths during an Ipbh cam-
 paign rally.   Malay resentment
 over this disrespect almost led
 to physical attacks on the Chi-
 nese.   Malay opposition leaders
 are already seeking to exploit
 anti-Chinese sentiment by claim-
 ing that the United Malay Na-
 tional Organization,  the Malay
 party in the Alliance, has fol-
 lowed a dangerous course by co-
 operating with the Chinese.
 If, as now seems possible,
 racial friction leads to Alli-
 ance defeats in the Penang city
 council elections on 7 December
 and the Batu Pahat legislative
 council by-election on 14 Decem-
 ber, a trend toward a polariza-
 tion of communal interests may
 be established which could lead
 to political instability.
 Intensification of racial
 strife will also greatly compli-
 cate the efforts of a Malay-
 dominated police and civil serv-
 ice to control subversion among
 Malaya's 2,500,000 Chinese at
 a time when the Communists seem
 ready to abandon their armed
 rebellion in order to concen=-
 trate on "peaceful" subversion.
 The narrow victory won by
 the New Zealand Labor party in
 the parliamentary elections on
 30 November  probably resulted
 from its successful exploita-
 tion of the weaknesses in the
 nation's economy and from its
 promises of increased tax and
 welfare benefits.   The final
 composition of the 80-man par-
 liament, after a special elec-
 tion postponed in one constit-
 uency until January, is expected
 to be 41 to 39, in contrast to
 the outgoing National party's
 margin of 10 seats.   After the
 election of a parliamentary
 speaker, who votes only in case
 of a tie, the Labor government
 is expected to hold a voting
 margin of only one seat.
 Despite current prosperity,
 the National party government
 was under heavy criticism for
 continued price increases, a
 credit squeeze,  difficulties in
 marketing agricultural exports,
 and a drain on exchange reserves
 caused by heavy private imports.
 Labor party promises, however,
 of lower interest rates, housing
 loans, agricultural subsidies,
 expanded welfare payments, and
 an early special session of par-
 liament to enact a sizable tax
 rebate may increase inflationary
 pressures and production costs.
 it is probable, therefore, that
 eventual imposition of price
 controls and increased import
 restrictions may aggravate the
 country's economic difficulties.
 In the field of foreign
 policy, both the National and
 Labor parties have given bipar-
 tisan support to close defensive
 cooperation with the United
 States and to regional defense
 commitments.   The Labor party,
 however, may be expected to in-
 troduce some modifications in
 the present foreign policy. It
 has called for the suspension
 of nuclear weapons tests by all
 nuclear powers and urges empha-
 sis on the social and economic
 rather than the military aspects
 of SEATO.
 Labor has long demonstrated
 an affinity for stronger ties
 with Britain in foreign policy

 BRAZIL'S COMMUNIST PARTY SEEKING LEGAL STATUS
 The Brazilian Communist
 party--one of the largest and
 most influential Communist par-
 ties in the western hemisphere--
 has launched a bold campaign to
 overcome the effects of internal
 dissension and, at-the same time,
 to regain its pre-1947 status
 as a legal party in time to ex-
 ert greater influence on the
 1958 congressional elections.
 In recent weeks the campaign
 has been aided significantly
 by the psychological impact of
 Societ scientific achievements
 and by the Soviet bloc's well-
 publicized offers of trade and
 economic aid to the government.
 The Communist party has
 not yet made a formal appeal
 for a reversal of the 1947 elec-
 toral court ruling that renders
 it illegal.   It is apparently
 concentrating on a preliminary
 effort to soften public opin-
 ion and to entrench its medium-
 level leaders in overt politi-
 cal organizations.   Internally,
 the presidium has been purged
 by Secretary General Luiz Carlos
 Prestes, who has publicly blamed
 the deposed members for his own
 unsuccessful  authoritarian
 policies.
 Prestes published a
 statement on 9 November assert-
 ing that the party has been in
 error in advocating the violent
 overthrow of the government.
 Actually, the official party
 line has for years advocated
 united-front tactics, but this
 fact has not been highlighted
 for the public.
 In another move apparently
 calculated to demonstrate will-
 ingness to work within the law,
 Prestes' lawyers have announced
 that he will come out of hiding
 to answer two long-standing se-
 dition charges, provided the
 courts withdraw an order for his
 arrest.  The party treasurer and
 a number of central committee
 members have already appeared
 in court and are now free to
 work openly.   Many lesser known
 leaders are devoting full time
 to organizing nationalist fronts
 in an effort to capture leader-
 ship of the growing ranks of
 leftist "superpatriots."
 Public response to the cam-
 paign has probably been dampened
 somewhat by the unexpectedly
 strong anti-Communist speech de-
 livered by War Minister Lott on

 5 December 1957
 27 November, the anniversary of
 the 1935 Communist uprising in
 Brazil.   State political organ-
 izations                      will probably continue
 to solicit Communist electoral
 support, however, as they have
 already done in Sao Paulo,  and
 a number of influential congress-
 men have taken the position
 that Communist party legality
 is desirable since open activi-
 ty is preferable to secret ma-
 neuvering.
 POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA
 In Central America,  where
 political instability is chron-
 ic,                   the situation at present is
 most critical in Guatemala,
 where Communists are in a posi-
 tion to make important gains.
 Honduras appears about to emerge
 from a turbulent three years
 during which constitutional gov-
 ernment has been in abeyance.
 Costa Rica is in the midst of a
 bitter election campaign.   The
 governments of Nicaragua and
 El Salvador at present are rela-
 tively stable.
 The Communist-infiltrated
 Revolutionary party of Guatemala
 may win the 19 January national
 elections unless the  divided
 anti-Communist political parties
 join forces.   There are at least
 ten .anti-Communist  parties
 grouped behind four ambitious
 presidential candidates.  Any
 one of several groups now plot-
 ting the forcible seizure of
 power may attempt a coup before
 election day.   Each claims sup-
 port in the faction-ridden army.
 An attempted coup might spark
 new and serious disorders.
 Political stability in Hon-
 duras will depend largely  on
 continuation of the present ac-
 commodation between two strong
 personalities:   President-elect
 Ramon Villeda Morales, leader
 of the majority Liberal party,
 and Colonel Oswaldo Lopez,  dom-
 inant member of the outgoing
 junta.   Villeda is scheduled to
 be inaugurated on 21 December,
 when a new constitution also
 goes into effect.   The consti-
 tution provides for a chief of
 the armed forces who will be
 virtually independent of presi-
 dential authority--a concession
 Villeda felt compelled to make
 to the politically important
 military to assure his inaugura-
 tion.   The new post will prob-
 ably be held by Colonel Lopez.
 The chief of the armed
 forces will have considerable
 influence, if not control, over
 civil government.   As long as
 he and the President work to-
 gether, the military will be a
 strong force inhibiting the vio-
 lent political rivalries which
 have weakened the country in
 the past.
 In Costa Rica, three presi-
 dential candidates are contest-
 ing the 2 February election to
 determine President Jose Figue-
 res' successor.   The campaigning
 is becoming so bitter that it
 may prove a real test of the
 Costa Rican tradition of order-
 ly democratic government.
 Young President Somoza of
 Nicaragua is enjoying wider pop-
 larity than did his authoritar-
 ian father,  who was assassi-
 nated last year. The government
 is concerned,  however, at the in-
 creased activity in recent weeks
 of die-hard anti-Somoza exiles
 in neighboring countries, al-
 though the threat does not ap-
 pear serious at the moment.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Sharp fighting between
 Moroccan Army of Liberation
 irregulars--probably a mixture
 of disaffected local tribesmen
 and professional  guerrillas
 from Morocco--and   Spanish
 forces continues in   Ifni.
 Spain is reinforcing its West
 African garrison, but appears
 to be having considerable dif-
 ficulty suppressing the in-
 surgents,   who some Spanish
 officials claim are Communist-
 influenced.
 Rabat and Madrid have pre-
 sented contradictory, exag-
 gerated accounts of develop-
 ments in and around the en-
 clave since violence erupted
 there on 23 November.  Madrid
 acknowledged  this week that
 fighting  had  spread to the
 Saguia el Hamra area of Spanish
 Sahara.
 Spanish officials appeared
 seriously concerned last week
 about Spain's ability to cope
 with the guerrillas.   Spanish
 Army Minister Barroso is re-
 ported to have said on 27 No-
 vember that the situation in
 Spain's West African possessions
 was "grave and disagreeable."
 Total Spanish troop
 strength in the area is be-
 lieved slightly in excess of
 8,000 men, about half of whom
 are in the enclave and the re-
 mainder in Spanish Sahara.
 Another 1,600 to 1,800 soldiers
 are reported en route to the
 region--though these troops
 may be headed for the Canary
 Islands, where Spain's strate-
 gic reserve has been depleted
 by recent transfers to  the
 mainland.   In addition,  most
 of Spain's active naval fleet
 and approximately 40 Spanish
 military aircraft, including
 fighters and bombers, are re-
 ported engaged in the current
 operation.
 The strength of the in-
 surgents is believed to be
 greater than the 1,000 to 1,200
 men originally reported. Although
 Spanish officials believe the
 guerrillas are influenced if not
 controlled by highly placed ex-
 tremists in Morocco's dominant
 Istiglal party, Madrid has so
 far refrained from precipitat-
 ing a major political crisis
 over the affair.
 The Moroccan government
 has formally protested alleged

 UN DEBATE ON
 Although France regards as
 "totally unacceptable" any UN
 resolution which would inject
 Tunisia and Morocco into the
 Algerian situation as negotia-
 tors, this year's General As-
 sembly may call for such nego-
 tiations without naming the two
 North African nations.  A num-
 ber of UN members consider the
 offer of good offices by Tunisia
 and Morocco the best chance for
 a solution to the problem.
 The Arabs decided at a 2
 December caucus that they could
 not support a resolution "with-
 out substance," such as last
 year's, which merely expressed
 the General Assembly's hope
 that a peaceful, democratic,
 and just solution could be
 found.  They believe that even a
 moderate resolution should call
 on the parties to negotiate and
 contain some reference to self-
 determination.   Japan and other
 moderate members of the Asian-
 African bloc have been attempt-
 ing to negotiate a compromise

 ceptable to France and yet sat-
 isfy some of the demands of the
 more volatile members of  the

 attacked the basic statute which
 was endorsed by the French Na-
 tional Assembly on 29 November
 as perpetuating French sover-
 eignty and control and closing
 the door to the evolution of
 Algerian institutions.
 French Foreign Minister
 Pineau's moderate opening state-
 ment in the UN on 27 November
 reaffirmed France's readiness
 to negotiate a cease-fire with-
 out political preconditions.
 France would probably be able
 to accept a slightly stronger
 resolution this year.  Outright
 French rejection of conciliatory
 efforts might result in immediate
 retaliation by the Arabs and
 would negate all attempts by
 several UN members to keep the
 Algerian debate as mild as pos-
 sible in order to avoid a French
 walkout of the UN.
 ITALIAN GENERAL LABOR CONFEDERATION ELECTS NEW HEAD

 of hard-line Communist Agostino
 Novella to the post of secretary

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 some compromise with the Nenni
 Socialists as well as with those
 rank-and-file Communists in the
 CGIL who want to stress labor
 rather than political interests.
 Novella, 52, has been a
 member of the PCI central com-
 mittee for several years and is
 considered primarily a party
 man.  He is reported to have
 acted as a party "watchdog"
 over his predecessor as secre-
 tary general, the late Giuseppe
 Di Vittorio, who is understood
 to have accused him of blind
 obedience to the party in labor
 matters.   Novella. has had many
 years' experience in organizing
 metal and shipyard workers.   He
 left the CGIL secretariat in
 June 1955 to take over and re-
 organize the metalworkers' fed-
 eration, which had made a poor
 showing in the Fiat shop-steward
 elections.   It is possible he
 was forced out of the secretar-
 iat at that time by Di Vittorio,
 who objected to subordinating
 the CGIL to the party.   Novella
 is an excellent orator and a
 good organizer, but he has nei-
 ther the prestige nor the pop-
 ularity of Di Vittorio.
 Novella's political orien-
 tation may make it difficult
 for him to adapt himself and
 the CGIL to bargaining at the
 plant rather than the national
 level.   Such an adaptation is
 a pressing need in view of the
 success of the free Italian
 labor organizations in this
 respect and the declining mem-
 bership                                                                 and  shop-steward
 strength of the CGIL.
 Santi, 55, an Italian So-
 cialist party deputy and a close
 associate of Nenni, has held
 important posts in the CGI1
 since 1945 and has been a mem-
 ber of the secretariat for sev-
 eral years.
 of the new post for him suggests
 that the Communists, even at
 the risk of divergencies be-
 tween the new chiefs, realize
 they must take more account of
 legitimate labor objectives--
 pushed by the Nenni Socialists--
 in order to avoid risking ac-
 celerated membership losses or
 even  splitting   the   CGIL.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 December 1957
 GAILLARD FACES BUDGET BATTLE
 French Premier Gaillard ap-
 pears determined to reduce the
 1958 budget deficit some $830,-
 000,000 below the estimated 1957
 deficit despite growing Social-
 ist unrest over the effects of
 his austerity program.   Unless
 the National Assembly approves
 the 1958 budget by the end of
 December, the government will be
 forced to operate on a month-
 to-month basis, and France will
 be faced with new problems in
 securing badly needed external
 aid.
 Gaillard's threefold anti-
 inflation program--to keep the
 budget at a maximum of about
 $12.5 billion (at the new ex-
 change rate of 420 francs to
 the dollar); to maintain price
 stability; and to restore equi-
 librium to France's balance of
 payments through increased ex-
 ports--will require extensive
 sacrifices from the French pub-
 lic which in general remains
 unaware of the country's criti-
 cal economic situation.
 Drastic cuts in even very
 important services are sched-
 uled and many subsidies have
 already been curtailed.
 Premier Gaillard was forced
 to call for a second vote of
 confidence on his tax proposals
 and special powers by the Na-
 tional Assembly's threat to
 follow the lead of the hostile
 Council of the Republic  in
 amending the proposed bill. Even
 with a new endorsement by the
 deputies on 5 December, his
 program can again be delayed
 by the council, which can hold
 up application of the measures
 for a maximum of 100  days.
 Gaillard is seeking an addition-
 al $28,520,000 in budget econo-
 mies, but growing Socialist un-
 rest over the effects his pro
 gram has already had in raising
 food prices and cutting welfare
 services threatens the govern-
 ment. In any case, assembly op-
 position to belt-tightening will
 become increasingly evident as
 the effects of the austerity
 program become evident.
 A major difficulty in bal-
 ancing the budget is the con-
 tinuing drain of more than $1
 billion yearly for military
 operations in Algeria.   Nuclear
 research and development costs
 are probably another important
 expense.   Other  inflationary
 factors are expanded   credit,
 which would be politically dif-
 ficult to curtail, and pressure
 for wage increases.   New rises
 in food and raw material prices
 went into effect on 2 December,
 boosting the price index to the
 point at which wage hikes are
 mandatory, and there'is growing
 skepticism that the government
 will be able to stop at the
 relatively small price conces-
 sions.
 The price rises may under-
 cut the government's stepped-
 up export campaign, which in
 any event will not immediately
 increase France's foreign ex-
 change holdings.   While the
 government is expected to be
 able to meet the $50,000,000
 due this month for the servic-
 ing of existing external debts
 as well as its,-EPU obligations
 for November, it will probably
 have to seek about $500,000,000
 in January.   If France fails
 to justify its EPU loan appli-
 cation by detailed financial
 reform plans, it will be faced
 with  the alternatives of post-
 poning                                                                  payment  on   imports
 or  dipping  into the last re-
 maining $576,000,000  worth of
 gold in   the Bank  of France.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 December 1957
 Iceland's trade with the
 Soviet bloc continued to in-
 crease during the first nine
 months of 1957.   Assurances of
 loans from the United States
 and West Germany have momentar-
 ily eased pressure on the gov-
 ernment to accept Soviet offers
 of assistance, but plans for ex-
 tensive modernization of the
 fishing fleet may make the So-
 viet offers tempting again.
 Iceland's increasing eco-
 nomic dependence on the Soviet
 bloc is shown by recently re-
 ported foreign trade figures.
 During the first nine months
 of 1957, the bloc absorbed 36
 percent of Iceland's exports
 and supplied 34.2 percent of
 its imports, as contrasted with
 30 and 26.4 percent respectively
 for 1956.   The rise reflects the
 inability of Iceland to market
 its fish elsewhere,  in consid-
 erable part because of its re-
 luctance to undertake the dras-
 tic economic reforms necessary
 to make prices more competitive.
 East Germany has delivered
 several of the 17 fishing ves-
 sels which it has contracted
 to build for Iceland.   Payments
 are being arranged from credits
 in the bilateral trade account
 between the two countries.   The
 government is reportedly also
 arranging to purchase 15 ad-
 ditional large trawlers abroad
 through foreign loans.
 Pressure on Reykjavik to
 negotiate Soviet offers of
 loans and assistance amounting
 to over $25,000,000 has eased
 as a result of the assurances
 Iceland received early in No-
 vember of American and West Ger-
 man loans totaling $5,000,000
 and $2,000,000 respectively.
 These loans will enable the
 government to continue its am-
 bitious domestic economic de-
 velopment program without re-
 sorting to deficit financing.
 The Communists have inten-
 sified their agitation against
 the US-manned base at Keflavik.
 Their press has hinted that they
 might withdraw from the coali-
 tion with the Progressives and
 Social Democrats.   It is more
 likely a chauvinistic maneuver
 to influence the January munic-
 ipal  elections, since the Com-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARN
 6 December 1956 exchange of
 letters, to "study defense
 needs in the light of the de-
 velopment of world conditions,
 and make recommendations to
 the governments how to meet
 these problems."
 (Concurred in by ORR)
 LEADERS OF EURATOM AND COMMON MARKET COUNTRIES TO MEET
 Government leaders of
 France, West Germany,  Italy,
 and the three Benelux countries
 who will be in Paris for the
 mid-December NATO meetings are
 expected to find time on the
 side to name the top personnel
 and select a location for the
 new EURATOM and European Com-
 mon Market institutions.  Aside
 from the immediate importance
 of these decisions for the for-
 ina.l inauguration of the two
 projects on 1 January, many
 "pro-Europeans" believe the
 location of these organizations
 will prove to be the future
 capital of a federated Europe.
 Of the 30-odd positions
 to be filled, the most impor-
 tant are the 14 in the EURATOM
 and Common Market commissions
 and their chairmen.   These com-
 missions share "executive au-
 thority" with the councils and
 exercise major discretionary
 and advisory powers.   The vi-
 tality of EURATOM and the Com-
 mon Market will accordingly
 depend to a considerable degree
 on finding men of stature for
 these posts while at the same
 time satisfying the national
 aspirations of the member coun-
 tries.
 Behind -the-scenes negotia-
 tions have probably already
 narrowed the choices for at
 least the top positions.   Thus
 the recent resignation of Rene
 Mayer from the presidency of
 the Coal-Steel Community (CSC)
 has paved the way for the ap-
 pointment of a German national
 to that post, a Frenchman to
 the chairmanship of EURATOM,
 and someone from the Benelux
 countries to preside over the
 Common Market.   Italy will pre-
 sumably be content with leading
 positions in the court and as-
 sembly which will eventually
 serve all three organizations.
 Such an arrangement would have
 the advantage of denying to
 France "leadership" in the Com-
 mon Market--where it is the
 nation considered most likely
 to be obstructive--while allay-
 ing possible fears of German
 "leadership" of EURATOM.
 The choice of headquarters
 has narrowed to Brussels, Stras-
 bourg, Paris, Luxembourg, and
 Milan--in that probable order
 of preference.   Britain, with
 an eye to developing ties with
 the Common Market through its
 projected European free trade
 area, and possibly influencing
 its development, has pressed
 the six member nations to lo-
 cate the Common Market institu-
 tions in Paris because the OEEC
 is already located there.   'There
 is some tendency to divide the
 various institutions among the
 member countries.   It seems
 likely, however, that all of
 the new institutions, as well
 as those of the CSC, will be
 centered in one place--perhaps
 in a specially created "federal
 district" as proposed by Jean
 Monnet's influential Action
 Committee for a United States
 of Europe.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 December 1957
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 EUROPEAN VIEW OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE
 Western European govern-
 ments consider the NATO meetings
 from 16 to 18 December of criti-
 cal importance  in                     clarifying
 the alliance's military  role
 and testing its political co-
 hesiveness.  They believe this
 first meeting of heads of gov-
 ernments of the NATO members
 should lead to closer collabora-
 tion in science and in the tech-
 nology of weapons production.
 France, West Germany, and others
 may be expected, however, to
 continue developing their own
 modern weapons and will probably
 continue to lag on their NATO
 force commitments.
 The forthcoming meeting
 has aroused high public inter-
 est.   This interest was stimu-
 lated by the original Eisen-
 hower-Macmillan communiqud of
 25 October promising support
 of greater scientific collabo-
 ration in NATO, and has been
 sustained in subsequent weeks
 by the unusually large number
 of visits by various European
 cabinet members to other capi-
 tals.   Some European statesmen
 fear public expectations may
 be too high.  They emphasize
 that the session must do more
 than show the NATO members'
 good intentions, or the hostile
 reaction will leave the alli-
 ance worse off than if there
 had been no meeting at all.
 NATO's Mission
 Continued military cutbacks
 testify to most members' belief
 that Soviet aggression in Europe
 Is improbable for years ahead.
 Also, deep doubts prevail on
 the role of nuclear weapons in
 the defense of Europe.  Opinion
 polls reflect the public's gen-
 eral dismay at the possible use
 of nuclear weapons; in France,
 Italy, and West Germany, a ma-
 jority of the respondents con-
 sider nuclear energy more a
 "curse" than a "boon" to human-
 ity.   This attitude is reflected
 in the government's requests to
 share in the decision on when
 to retaliate with nuclear weap-
 ons against a Soviet attack.
 As the types of nuclear
 weapons expand, uncertainty
 grows among European leaders
 as  to  whether a graduated
 deterrent is. possible by draw-
 ing a distinction between tacti-
 cal and strategic nuclear weap-
 ons.  American political  and
 military analyst Kissinger's
 "Nuclear Weapons and Foreign
 Policy" has been widely read
 by British officials, and con-
 cern over its possible reflec-
 tion of an American intention to
 fight a. limited defensive war in
 Europe has probably contributed
 to the British request for a new
 special review of NATO's mission.
 Of the varied topics cov-
 ered by the Paris meeting's
 broad and generalized agenda,
 European leaders seem concerned
 primarily over two major ques-
 tions:   how NATO's defense mis-
 sion should be carried out; and
 the problem of cohesion in the
 alliance.
 Cohesion of the Alliance
 Concern over the cohesion
 of the alliance looms large as
 a consequence of this anticipa-
 tion of no early aggression in
 Europe and of some  members'

 preoccupation with matters out-
 side the North Atlantic Treaty
 area.  West Germany, with few
 outside commitments, speaks most
 vigorously for those who would
 extend the machinery for  con-
 sultation among members on all
 disputes throughout the world.
 Britain and others with non-
 European interests continue'to
 balk at any such commitment,
 however.
 lieve that European bargaining
 power with the United States is
 now at its height.
 Emphasis on Technology
 Another persistent charge
 --that an exclusive Anglo-Amer-
 ican "directorate" exists--has
 been  voiced  anew in France,
 where the special relationship
 between London and Washington
 has long been viewed with dis-
 trust.   The American NATO mis-
 sion notes that this suspicion
 is also shared by  other  NATO
 The rapid advance in de-
 veloping destructive, long-range
 weapons has renewed  anxieties
 regarding the permanence of the
 American commitment in Europe.
 In Britain, for example, some
 people have expressed the fear
 that with the continental United
 States within range of Soviet
 nuclear assault, Washington may
 be less willing to risk war to
 defend Europe.   A complementary
 fear is that the United States
 will have less interest in main-
 taining troops or missile bases
 in Europe when it develops its
 own ICBM's.
 German Defense Minister
 Strauss, because of this con-
 sideration, is said to have set
 1961 as a target date for con-
 tinental Europe to have its own
 nuclear weapons capability.

 participation in such programs,
 especially those involving nu-
 clear energy.   There is con-
 siderable support for a pooling
 of basic research facilities,
 plus much closer coordination
 and exchange of information on
 developments of military appli-
 cation.
 Possibilities for extended
 scientific and technological
 cooperation are enhanced by the
 absence of the deep-seated dif-
 ferences among Europeans that
 hamper progress in other endeav-
 ors.   In the past year France
 and Germany have achieved the
 closest collaboration in the
 development of modern weapons--
 and it is possible that their
 present public arrangements re-
 garding missiles may even ex-
 tend into nuclear weapon'de-
 velopment.  Other, more limited,
 bilateral arrangements among
 Britain, France, Germany, the
 Netherlands, and Italy may pave
 the way for closer ties,  and the
 seven-member Western European
 Union offers a framework for
 their multilateral extension if
 NATO-wide collaboration fails
 to develop.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 December 1957
 The current NATO annual re-
 view of defense plans shows a
 general picture of further lags,
 withdrawals, and cutbacks on the
 part of most members in the cen-
 tral and northern European area.
 Renewed interest in some manner
 of military integration along
 the pattern of the abortive Eu-
 ropean Defense Community is evi-
 dent, especially in Germany and
 Italy.  London appears to have
 had second thoughts about its
 plans of last spring to build
 a nuclear deterrent of its own
 at the expense of conventional
 forces.
 Nonmilitary Cooperation
 Several members, notably
 Italy and France, have empha-
 sized the need for greater co-
 operation in nonmilitary fields.
 They urge the alliance to en-
 courage greater economic aid to
 underdeveloped areas to combat
 Soviet gains.  The foreign min-
 isters of both France and Italy
 have lent their names to plans
 to aid such areas, for which
 they probably will seek support
 at  the  forthcoming  meeting.
 However, they appear to respect
 the view endorsed at the December
 1956 foreign ministers' meeting
 that NATO should not become an
 "operating agency" for economic
 aid.  Most members urge greater
 use of the OEEC to consider eco-
 nomic problems within the alli-
 ance.
 Many members have noted
 that  the meetings will be
 closely  watched  outside the
 NATO area by  those anticipat-
 ing a  Western "response"  to
 Soviet advances.  They  believe
 the conference's  concluding
 communique  must  both  show
 neutral nations the alliance
 seeks more than a narrow mili-
 tary  alliance and                                                           give evi-
 dence  of  sufficient  decisive-
 ness to                                                             provide  hope to those
 seeking  defense  against  So-
 viet aggression.

 SOVIET GROUND FORCE WEAPONS
 Observations of new and
 improved weapons at the October
 Revolution Day parade this year
 confirm information previously
 received that the Soviet ground
 forces are continuing to improve
 their conventional armament at
 the same time they are supple-
 menting their arsenal with a
 family of tactical support mis-
 siles.  The new weapons,appar-
 ently the results of an inten-
 sive research and development
 program which began in 1950,
 have greater firepower than
 those they supplant and give to
 the units armed with them an im-
 pressive degree of battlefield mo-
 bility.  These developments are
 in line with Soviet tactical
 doctrine, which is designed to
 meet the demands of nuclear as
 well as conventional warfare.

 weapons as a supplement to,

 conventional fire support.   Con-
 ventional artillery pieces and
 truck-mounted rocket launchers
 shared honors at the recent
 parade with new short- and medi-
 um-range missiles believed cap-
 able of carrying nuclear war-
 heads.   Two "Honest John-type"
 artillery rockets which appear
 to satisfy two separate range
 requirements of up to 75 miles,
 one mounted on a tracked am-
 phibious tank chassis, were fol-
 lowed in the parade by two me-
 dium-range tactical missiles
 with probable ranges of 150-200
 and 350 miles.   These weapons
 are believed to be
 available to combat
 units.
 Several models
 of rocket launchers
 --one mounted on a
 tracked vehicle--and
 two models of a self -
 propelled "atomic
 cannon" mounted on a
 lengthened heavy tank
 chassis, were seen
 for the first time in
 the parade and pro-
 vide further evidence
 of Soviet emphasis
 on mobility.   One of
 the heavy guns was a convention-
 al 12- to 14-inch type and prob-
 ably has atomic capability.   The
 other was of similar caliber,
 apparently without a recoil
 mechanism, and probably fires
 a jet- or rocket-assisted round.

 1954 when a 130-mm
 "corps gun," an adapta-

 piece, was shown.   The
 following year a 203-
 mm gun howitzer, a
 152-mm howitzer, and
 a 122-mm field gun ap-
 peared.  All of these
 weapons displayed im-
 proved roadability
 and replaced weapons
 of similar caliber.
 In 1953, 160-mm
 and 240-mm towed heavy
 mortars appeared, as
 well as the first of a series
 of three new truck-mounted rock-
 et launchers firing spin-stabil-
 ized rounds and ranging in size
 from a 16-round, 140-mm model to
 a 12-round,240-mm model.   Dis-
 played this year at the parade
 were a 13-ton truck mounting
 two banks of three new rockets
 approximately 10 inches in di-
 ameter and 17 feet long and a
 12-tube,240-mm rocket launcher
 mounted on a tractor.

 appeared in the para.de.   A modi-
 fied version of the 85-mm divi-
 sional gun M-1945--an antitank
 gun which can be propelled by
 a small motorcycle engine--also
 has been observed in the last
 year.
 As for antiaircraft artil-
 lery, a new self -propelled dual
 57-mm gun that would provide
 mobile antiaircraft protection
 for tactical units was displayed
 this month.   Mounted on a modi-
 fied T-54 tank chassis, the
 weapon is equippped with light
 armor protection for the crew
 compartment.   The 57-mm towed
 antiaircraft gun, first observed
 in 1950,has replaced the 37-mm
 model in forward areas, and the
 100-mm towed antiaircraft gun
 has replaced the 85-mm model
 in antiaircraft artillery divi-
 sions guarding static installa-
 tions.   The 122-mm towed heavy
 antiaircraft gun, first observed
 in 1955, is being used tempo-
 rarily to supplement missiles
 in the defense of strategic
 targets. A surface-to-air two-
 stage missile shown in the re-
 cent parade completes the Soviet
 weapons system for antiaircraft
 defense.
 Since 1945 the ground
 forces also have been supplied
 with a family of high-speed
 tracked prime movers capable of
 handling the entire range of
 Soviet towed artillery.   These
 prime movers--one of which has
 been observed towing a 100-mm
 gun--are being adapted for tow-
 ing and mounting both rockets
 and missiles.
 A new heavy tank and the
 T-54 medium tank were publicly
 displayed in Moscow for  the
 first time this year.   The new
 tank is probably the oft-re-
 ported T-10, replacement for the
 JS-3 tank now being observed in
 limited numbers in the hands of
 Soviet troops in East Germany.
 Approximately 5,000 of the T-10
 tanks, powered by a new 12-
 cylinder diesel engine, are be-
 lieved to have been produced to
 date.   The T-54 medium tank is
 rapidly replacing the T-34 in
 Soviet units and is now being
 issued to satellite armies.   A
 new assault gun mounting a 122-
 mm piece on the T-54 tank chassis
 is also being issued.
 New wheeled armored vehi-
 cles placed in general use since
 1950 include six- and  four-
 wheeled armored personnel car-
 riers.
 Amphibious
 In line with Soviet tacti-
 cal doctrine, which calls for
 rapid movement and dispersion
 to avoid troop concentrations,
 a complete family of amphibious
 vehicles has been produced rang-

 several years in succession, a
 new type amphibious tank has
 been issued to reconnaissance
 elements.  The amphibious, ar-
 mored, full-tracked personnel
 carrier observed in this year's
 parade will provide close ar-
 mored infantry support in any
 type terrain which can be trav-
 ersed by Soviet tanks.   The
 amphibious jeep appears to be
 an exact copy of an American
 model, and an amphibious six-
 wheel truck is similar to the
 American DUKW.  One full-tracked
 amphibian has been observed;
 several others  have  been  re-
 ported.
 Bridging equipment has been
 improved to keep pace with the
 additional armor and heavy weap-
 ons                                                           in  the  hands  of  Soviet
 troops.   In use is a heavy steel
 pontoon bridge with a capacity
 of 100 tons that can span any
 river.   Several types of assault
 bridging for spanning  short
 gaps have been observed in East
 Germany in the ,past  several
 years.
 Small Arms and Transport
 The rugged and effective
 family of infantry arms used
 during World War II has been re-
 placed by an impressive series
 of new and improved pistols,
 semiautomatic carbines, subma-
 chine guns, antitank launchers,
 and 82-mm and 107-mm towed, re-
 coilless, antitank weapons.
 Three small arms fire a stand-
 ardized 7.62-mm rimless  car-
 tridge.
 In the motor transport
 field, the USSR has made a signi-
 ficant improvement in standard-
 izing cargo vehicles and adapt-
 ing them for use as prime movers,
 personnel carriers, and such
 special-purpose vehicles as am-
 bulances, mobile repair trucks,
 and signal vans.
 AFGHAN EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED FOREIGN POLICY
 Afghan King Zahir Shah will
 return the visit of Pakistani
 President  Mirza by going  to
 Karachi on 10 December,    in the
 latest of a series  of     state
 visits  by  Afghan  leaders.
 Zahir's scheduled trip is prob-
 ably intended to demonstrate
 further the general  Afghan-
 Pakistani  rapprochement which
 began during the spring of this
 year.  The Afghan government
 apparently wishes to emphasize
 that while its relations with
 the USSR have expanded, it wants
 to maintain a balanced foreign
 policy  by strengthening  its
 relations with nonbloc  coun-
 tries.
 The Afghan government has

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1953 to institute progressively
 more vigorous     developmental
 policies, largely predicated
 on foreign aid.   The program of
 Soviet-assisted economic devel-
 opment begun in 1954 expanded
 rapidly following the signing
 of the $100,000,000 loan agree-
 ment in January 1956.   Many
 projects were agreed on by the
 Afghans, preliminary surveys
 were made, and cost estimates
 were submitted by the USSR to
 the Afghan government.
 In many cases the Afghans
 eventually found that the es-
 timated cost of a project was
 much higher than had been an-
 ticipated on the basis of es-
 timates submitted previously
 by free world companies.   Be-
 cause of the high costs, the
 Afghan government proceeded
 more cautiously and contracted
 for engineering surveys only
 for those projects in which it
 was most interested, apparently
 feeling partly compensated for
 the high costs by the long-term
 credits and low interest rates
 under the terms of the loan
 agreement.   Projects on which
 construction has begun have
 been mainly confined to  oil
 storage depots, transportation
 development, and airfields, all
 in the northern part of the
 country.   Little construction
 was in evidence during the 1957
 summer building period.
 In spite of the relatively
 slow implementation of projects
 under the $100,000,000 loan
 agreement, Afghanistan's econom-
 ic relations with the Soviet
 bloc have continued to expand.
 A large part of a $5,000,000
 Czech loan extended in Septem-
 ber 1954 has now been committed
 under construction contracts.
 Trade agreements have been con-
 cluded with the USSR, Poland,
 Czechoslovakia, and Communist
 China.
 The Afghan government also
 accepted further Soviet economic
 assistance under the terms of
 the oil exploration agreement
 announced on 30 July of this
 year, at the conclusion of Zahir's
 visit to the USSR.  Afghan ex-
 ports have been increasingly
 obligated to the bloc to pay
 for imports received under the
 terms of the trade agreements
 and to service credits covering
 both economic and military as-
 sistance.   These obligations
 will continue.
 More rapid progress has
 been maintained in implementing
 the program of Soviet military
 assistance to Afghanistan.
 Enough modern weapons to com-
 pletely re-equip Afghanistan's
 64,000-man military and gen-
 darmerie establishment probably
 have been delivered.  A Soviet
 military mission has been train-
 ing a cadre of Afghan officers
 in the use of these weapons, and
 the officers are expected to
 train Afghan troops to use them
 in the near future.   The Afghan
 army may also be reorganized along
 Soviet lines.
 Soviet influence in the
 Afghan army probably constitutes

 the greatest potential danger
 to the Afghan government and
 raises the possibility of  a
 coup by Soviet-oriented of-
 ficers, as occurred in Syria.
 The royal family, which domi-
 nates the government, is sup-
 ported mainly by the Pathan
 tribes.   Yet, because of the
 strength of these tribes, the
 government does not attempt to
 draft their young men into the
 army, and Afghan enlisted men
 are therefore drawn from mi-
 nority peoples such as the
 Uzbeks and Tadjiks.   In the past,
 these troops have not been as
 effective fighters as the Pathan
 tribesmen, but as they acquire
 modern weapons and learn how to
 use them they may be able to op-
 pose the Pathans effectively.
 These troops will be commanded
 to an increasing degree by So-
 viet-trained officers.
 Though Afghan relations
 with the Soviet bloc  are  ap-
 parently very friendly,  they
 may be dictated primarily by
 Afghan respect  for  Soviet
 strength and by the Afghan gov-
 ernment's desire to secure eco-
 nomic and military aid from
 bloc countries.  Afghanistan
 has nevertheless remained suf-
 ficiently free of bloc influence
 to endorse the American Middle
 East doctrine when it was the
 primary Communist propaganda
 target in the Middle East.   It
 is notable that no joint com-
 munique issued by the Afghan
 government and a bloc govern-
 ment has attacked colonialism
 or the Baghdad pact.
 The expansion of Afghan
 relations with the Soviet bloc,
 which began when Prince Daud
 came to power, has been part of
 a general growth of Afghani-
 stan's international contacts.
 The expansion of relations
 with the free world now appears
 to be regarded by Kabul as
 necessary not only for the de-
 velopment of Afghanistan but
 also to offset expanding rela-
 tions with the bloc.
 In addition to securing
 foreign aid programs and working
 to develop the national economy,
 the Afghan government in the
 past several years has estab-
 lished diplomatic relations with
 several additional countries,
 participated increasingly in
 the special organizations of
 the United Nations, taken an
 active part in General Assembly
 debate, sent delegations to
 international conferences, dis-
 patched and welcomed cultural
 and trade delegations and state
 visitors, and concluded air
 and trade agreements.
 Afghanistan has secured
 some military training for its
 officers from free world coun-
 tries.   Turkey has long main-
 tained a training mission in
 Afghanistan and recently wel-
 comed about 25 officers to Tur-
 key for training.  About 15
 Afghans have been receiving
 pilot training in India, and a
 few officers  are studying in
 American military academies.
 Relations with the free
 world are much more extensive
 in the economic sphere than in
 other fields.   There is con-
 siderable West German business
 interest and activity in Afghan-
 istan and some from Japan and
 India.   American economic rela-
 tions, however, provide the most
 substantial competition to simi-
 lar Soviet contacts.
 Pan-American World Airways
 has assumed the management of
 the Afghan Ariana Airline and
 is helping it acquire interna-
 tional routes, possibly through
 the Middle East to West Germany.
 Fairchild Aerial Surveys is map-
 ping most of Afghanistan.   ICA
 is providing considerable tech-
 nical assistance and has under-
 taken to build an international
 airport at Kandahar.   Caltex
 is actively negotiating for a
 gasoline distributorship in
 eastern Afghanistan.   Kabul is
 pressing the American govern-
 ment to help build a railroad
 in the south to connect with
 the Pakistani railroad system.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 All these activities  are  ap-
 parently valued by the Afghans
 as they tend to offset Soviet
 economic activity in addition
 to furthering the development
 of the country.
 Afghan-Pakistani Rapprochement
 A desire to improve Afghan-
 Pakistani relations, which had
 suffered following the Push-
 toonistan crisis of 1955, was
 evidenced in Pakistani Presi-
 dent Mirza's visit to Kabul in
 August 1956 and by Afghan Prime
 Minister Daud's visit to Karachi
 the following November.
 The Afghans, probably mo-
 tivated mainly by a desire to
 balance their expanded rela-
 tions with the USSR, moved to
 improve relations with Pakistan
 early this year.   In April, Daud
 announced the reversal of Ka-
 bul's Kashmir policy, which now
 supports Pakistan's demand for
 a plebiscite.   At the same time,
 the Pushtoonistan propaganda
 campaign was permitted to slack-
 en.   The Afghans began to in-
 crease their use of transit
 facilities through Pakistan,
 and, following a visit to Kabul
 by Pakistani Prime Minister
 Suhrawardy, an air agreement
 was signed on 23 June by the
 two countries.   Significant
 was Kabul's forebearance fol-
 lowing a report that Suhrawardy
 had made disparaging remarks
 about autonomy for Pushtoonistan
 during a radio interview in Los
 Angeles.   The two countries
 have again exchanged both am-
 bassadors and consuls; they had
 been withdrawn in 1955.
 The forthcoming state visit
 by King Zahir to Karachi will be
 regarded as further evidence of
 the continuing improvement of
 relations between the two neigh-
 bors.   Though the King has be-
 come increasingly prominent in
 Afghan policy affairs, he will
 probably not conduct negotiations
 on specific problems which would
 involve Afghan concessions in
 exchange for Pakistani conces-
 sions.   Discussions will prob-
 ably remain on a general level
 and produce a joint statement
 of good will, possibly including
 a declaration of intent to nego-
 tiate further on specific prob-
 lems, such as transit develop-
 ment, trade, and the Pushtooni-
 stan dispute.
