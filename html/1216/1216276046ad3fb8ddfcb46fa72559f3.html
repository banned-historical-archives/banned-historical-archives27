 COMRADE MAO ZEDONG'S LETTERS AND COMMENTS CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF
 INVESTIGATION AND STUDIES (APRIL-NOVEMBER 1961)
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 2-3
 [Text]  A Letter to Comrade Deng Xiaoping (25 April 1961)
 Comrade Xiaoping:
 Please draft a notice for the convocation of a CPC Central Committee work
 conference and notify the responsible comrades of all the bureaus of the
 CPC Central Committee, all provinces, municipalities and regions to arrive
 at Beijing on 15 May.  The members of the drafting committee of the regu-
 lations of work of the rural people's commune (refer to the original sample
 of Guangzhou for the list of members) to arrive at Beijing on 5 May.  The
 tasks of the current conference are to complete the unfinished work left
 over by the Guangzhou conference, that is, to collect the opinions of the
 cadres and masses, revise the 60 points of work regulations and continue
 to rectify the 5 kinds of unhealthy tendencies.  The problem of industry
 and urban rectification will not be discussed or it may be discussed
 briefly at the end of the conference.  We leave this problem to be dis-
 cussed at the August conference.  For this purpose, all comrades who are
 to attend the conference must use this period of time to conduct focused
 investigations on certain key problems in the rural areas (such as the
 problems of canteens, grain, supply, private plots of hilly land, classi-
 fied management of mountains and forests, farm cattle, the problem of
 whether production brigades or production tams should manage farm imple-
 ments, the overall rectification of counties, communes and brigades of the
 first and second categories and the resolute returning of unlawfully taken
 things, opposing the idea of bestowing land as a favor, firmly taking the
 mass line, consulting the masses, energetically encouraging the practice of
 conducting investigation and study, restoring the handicraft industry and
 resuming the supply and marketing cooperatives).  It is essential to spend
 10 to 15 days making investigations and seek3.ng truth from the masses, so
 that eve can thoroughly complete the above-mentioned tasks at the May con-
 ference.
 Please find Comrade Tian Jiaying to draft this notice with you.  We will
 talk it over this evening and dispatch it by telegram tomorrow.  With best
 wishes!
 Mao Zedong

 A Letter to Comrade Li Jingquan, c/o Comrade Chen Zhenren (6 May 1961)*
 Comrade Jingquan of Sichuan CPC Committee, c/o Comrade Chen Zhenren of
 Jianyang Pingquan Commune:
 I am very happy to have received Comrade Chen Zhenren's letter of 1 May.
 It will be quite valuable to go to Jianyang once more to conduct an
 investigation for a week or better 2 weeks.  Comrade Jingquan, why didn't
 you write to me?  I was longing for your letter.  Did you make any investi-
 gation?  The CPC Central Committee made a list of investigation items.
 This was sent to you on 25 April.  A further notice was sent on 4 May to
 postpone the conference to 20 May, so that you could have ample opportunity
 to conduct investigations and studies and have a thorough understanding of
 those problems.  We hope that the Beijing conference will achieve better
 results than the Guangzhou conference.  In addition, I ask you to do me
 one more favor:  Within these 15 days, I hope the first party secretaries
 of all the bureaus of the CPC Central Committee, all provinces, munici-
 palities and regions will conduct conscientious investigations and studies
 with great efforts.  You can write to me at any time, it can be informal
 and do not bother about the handwriting.  I expect to receive a letter from
 you within this half month.  If you are so kind as to write to me, I will
 surely reply.
 This letter should also be presented to the CPC Central Committee.
 Mao Zedong
 Shanghai, 6 May 1961
 Comments on Transmitting Comrade Zhang Pinghua's Letter (14 May 1961)
 This letter is to be transmitted to the party committees of all the bureaus
 of the CPC Central Committee, all provinces, municipalities and regions for
 reference.  Comrade Zhang Pinghua, your letter can be transmitted through-
 out Hunan and it may well be adopted by the party committees of all pre-
 fectures, municipalities, counties and communes.  It is imperative to
 firmly take the mass line.  It is also essential to consult and decide all
 matters with the masses and then formulate policies for implementation.
 It is forbidden for the party committees at various levels not to make any
 investigations and studies.  It is absolutely forbidden for a minority of
 people in the party committees not to make investigations or consult with
 the masses, but make the so-called policies in offices that are subjective
 and harmful to the people.
 Mao Zedong
 Tianjin, 14 May 1961
 *This letter was also sent to the first secretaries of party committees of
 all the bureaus of the CPC Central Committee, all provinces, municipalities
 and regions.

 Comments for the CPC Central Committee in Transmitting Comrade Deng Zihui's
 Investigation Report (23 November 1961)
 Party committees of all the bureaus of the CPC Central Committee, all
 provinces, municipalities and regions:
 Comrade Deng Zihui's report is well made.  We present it to you for refer-
 ence.  This document should also be transmitted to the party committees at
 prefectural, county and commune levels for reference, because at present,
 all localities are popularly making experiments.  It is the soul of Marxism
 to conduct conscientious investigation and study and make a concrete
 analysis of specific problems, rather than making abstract and subjective
 analyses.   We suggest that before 20 December, the first party secretaries
 of all provinces lead certain numbers of work teams and go down to villages
 to conduct investigations and studies for 10 days or so by adopting the
 methods of Comrade Deng Zihui.

 STRIVE TO CREATE A NEW SITUATION IN CHINA'S SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WORK
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 4-10
 [Article by Nie Rongzhen [5119 2837 5271]]
 [Text]  Editor's note:  On 25 November, Comrade Nie
 Rongzhen gave an interview to Comrade Xiong Fu, chief
 editor of this journal.  He made an important state-
 ment on the issue of striving to create a new situa-
 tion in our country's science and technology work.
 In his talk, Comrade Nie Rongzhen mentioned the major
 experiences that he gained during the period when he
 was in charge of science and technology work, particu-
 larly stressing the party's historical experience on
 the intellectual problem and the problems we should
 pay attention to at present in implementing our
 intellectual policies.  He points out that we should
 teach our broad ranks of cadres and masses to under-
 stand the position and role of the intellectuals in
 socialist modernization, develop a new custom of the
 whole society respecting knowledge, science and intel-
 lectuals and strive to form a friendly alliance of
 workers, peasants and intellectuals.  His talk is of
 great significance in helping all our party members to
 ,heighten their, awareness and unify, their understanding
 on the problem related to the conscientious implementa-
 tion of the party's policy on science and technology
 work and on intellectuals.  Here are his remarks.
 Ever since the 12th party congress, the initiative of our country's scien-
 tists and broad ranks of cadres on the scientific and technical front has
 been very high.  They all hope that our country's science and technology
 work develops quickly.  I can understand this mood.  It has been a long
 time since I left my post of responsibility for science and technology work,
 but I am still concerned with and will support this work with all my
 strength.  People are all very anxious and so am I.
 In my opinion, the present situation is characterized by the fact that in
 order to fulfill the plan for the development of the coming 20 years, people

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 throughout the country wish the science and technology work to develop more
 quickly.  Recently, in one of his talks, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward
 the problem of organizing science and technology ranks to tackle major
 technical problems hurdles, regarding it as a matter of first priority in
 carrying out the 20-year development plan.  It is very clear that develop-
 ing the four modernizations, making our economy prosper, building up the
 two civilizations and achieving the magnificent goal of quadrupling all
 depends on progress in developing science and technology.  At present, the
 key to our modernization lies in satisfactorily developing our science and
 technology work and giving full play to the role of intellectuals in this
 field.
 Take agriculture for example.  We are faced with quite a large number of
 agricultural scientific and technical problems.  How can we modernize the
 whole country, if we cannot solve the problems related to agriculture?  The
 modernization of agriculture can never be divorced from science and tech-
 nology.  The first character of the "eight-character constitution" for
 agriculture i.s soil.  Soil constitutes the foundation of agricultural pro-
 duction.  China is so vast that the soil in its territory differs widely
 in its composition, physical, chemical and ecological nature and fertility.
 In order to develop diversified undertakings that are suited to the local
 conditions, we must do a large amount of work to investigate the soil con-
 ditions in a widespread manner.  It will take an even longer period of time
 to improve our soil.  In this respect, we need the joint efforts of the
 specialists of various fields.  In the past, excessive lumbering, the crea-
 tion of "Dazhai land" and the practice of reclaiming land from lake areas
 gave rise to serious soil erosion and undermined the ecological equilibrium
 of nature.  We should put to an-end forever these foolish practices that go
 against the objective law.  The second feature is water.  The establishment
 of irrigation systems needs the joint efforts of the specialists in water
 conservation, geology and other fields.  In this respect, there is also the
 problem of taking the local conditions into account.  In the north where
 there is little rainfall, we should not blindly develop irrigated land.
 Excessive use of underground water in the suburban areas will bring about
 serious results and may even cause the land to subside.  There are also
 the problems related to pesticide and fertilizers.  S,omeYka.nd~ of pesticide
 seriously pollute the environment and are no longer used abroad, but we
 continue to use them.  We should pay greater attention.to using biological
 methods to overcome pests.  The excessive use of fertilizer may destroy the
 organic composition of the soil.  All these problems cannot be solved with-
 out science and technology and must be solved through the research of our,
 specialists.  The third feature is seeds.  Having fine species of seeds is
 an important means of increasing agricultural production.  The populariza-
 tion of the hybrid rice of high-land type and the No 1 Lu strain of cotton
 alone has already created more than 1 billion yuan of wealth.  There are
 also the problems related to thick planting and deep plowing.  The American
 Han Ding opposes deep plowing.  These problems also should be solved by
 specialists through research.  In short, the solution to all of these prob-
 lems lies with science and technology or with the efforts of specialists in

 fields.  Now our party's policies are right and since the establishment of

 the agricultural production responsibility system, the peasants' initiative
 has been greatly heightened and agriculture has developed relatively quickly.
 However, there is a limit to giving play to the initiative of the peasants
 and a state of "saturation" will be reached some day.
 However, the potential for increasing production that science and tech-
 nology can bring to agriculture is infinite.  Our peasants understand this
 idea and have already tasted the benefits of scientific farming, so they are
 eager to use science.  Now agricultural technicians have already become
 "gods of wealth" in our rural areas.  pur peasants are vying with one
 another in seeking the advice of these technicians.  This is a very hearten-
 ing phenomenon.  This is also true for our industry that also has to rely on
 the strength of science and technology.  For example, cadres in such medium-
 sized cities as Xiangfan, Changzhou, and Siping understood this idea
 earlier.  As a result, the industrial development in these cities has been
 quicker and some of the products there have already surpassed Shanghai in
 their quality.  We must realize this trend of development and welcome the
 arrival of a scientific and technical upsurge in our country.
 Now the problem for which the broad ranks of cadres on the scientific and
 technical front show the greatest concern is how we are to create a new
 situation in our science and technology work.  Let me mention a personal
 experience.  In 1956, I began to replace Comrade Chen Yi as the responsible
 person for science and technology work.  When I was in charge of this work,
 Premier Zhou and Comrade Chen Yi were leading the formulation of the 12-
 year national development plan of science and technology.  Generally speak-
 ing, at that time, the number of our technical and scientific workers was
 small, their level was low and their working and research conditions were
 poor.  However, because the party Central Committee paid great attention to
 this work and many major issues were directly handled by Chairman Mao and
 Premier Zhou, we made great progress in a very short period of time.  In
 1964, we succeeded in exploding an atomic bomb and 2 years and 8 months
 later, we again succeeded in exploding an H-bomb.  Many new industrial
 departments have been developed to fill the gaps of our country`s scien-
 tific and technical field.
 I think that in order to do our science and technology work well, we should
 do the following:
 1.  We should be self-reliant.  Chairman Mao said that our country is first
 of all poor and second of all unmarked, but that the largest number of the
 best pictures could be drawn on a piece of blank paper.  We are not afraid
 of having nothing on the paper.  Since there is nothing on the paper, we
 can draw pictures as we please.  In order to satisfactorily build up our
 country and draw the best and most beautiful pictures, we cannot rely on
 anybody else.  We must rely on ourselves, on our workers, peasants and
 intellectuals.  Our principle of self-reliance can be said to be the con-
 sequence'~of outward force.  Khrushchev one-sidedly broke all the; agreements
 and withdrew all his experts without leaving anything, even the blueprints;
 for us.  Since he would not give these things to us, we had to rely on our-
 selves.  This resulted in our success in making the atom bomb and H-bomb and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 the development of all sectors.  It was a very fortunate thing that we were
 forced to rely on ourselves.  When we succeeded in exploding our first
 atomic bomb, Chairman Mao humorously said that we had to grant Khrushchev
 a great medal weighing 1 ton as a token of our "gratitude."  Of course, our
 self-reliance by no means signifies a closed-door policy.  We should con-
 scientiously introduce new technology and equipment and purchase patents
 from abroad.  We should learn and take over all those that are useful to us
 and make them serve our modernizations.  We must understand, however, that
 we cannot buy modernization from abroad with money.  The new technology and
 equipment we have  bought should be assimilated through study and then be
 transformed and developed in the light of the actual conditions in our coun-
 try.  On the problem of introducing things from abroad, we must always be
 sober-minded.  We wish to introduce advanced technology and equipment from
 some capitalist countries but these countries have publicly declared that
 they will only sell the second most advanced things and will not sell the
 most advanced ones.  Some people find that it is too slow to develop by
 ourselves.  I say that it is slow in some respects, but it is more reliable.
 Moreover, to take a long-term view, it is much quicker than the speed we
 can achieve if we completely rely on imports.  Did we not quickly take the
 fortification of the sophisticated technology of the atom and H-bombs by
 relying on our own strength under very difficult conditions in the past?
 Now that we have such favorable conditions, it is out of the question that
 we can succeed by relying on ourselves.  That is why I always advocate self-
 reliance, consider things from the viewpoint of basing things on development
 of our national industry, and scientific and technical undertakings and
 stress raising the scientific and cultural level of the whole nation.  In
 the final analysis, we have to rely on our own strength.  Therefore, self-
 reliance is our starting point.  At the same time, we should pay attention
 to introducing advanced technology from abroad.  We have done this work for
 decades and have already laid a certain foundation.  I agzee with Comrade
 Zhao Ziyang's view on technical transformation and on science and tech-
 nology work serving economic construction expressed in his report to the
 recent NPC session.  In my ,opinion, by relying on technical transformation,
 conservation of energy and the research into, exploitation and development
 of new technology, we will be able to increase production and promote the
 development of science.  It will not do, if we import everything from
 abroad, rely on imports for everything or worship and have blind faith in
 things foreign.
 2.  We should formulate appropriate plans for the development of our
 science and technology.  Having formulated a plan, we have a destination
 for our march and a goal to achieve through our striving.  In 1956, we con-
 centrated a few hundred scientists and technical workers to spend nearly 10
 months in drawing up a 12-year science and technology development plan.
 Thus we clarified the key projects and persisted in developing scientific
 research first.  This plan took into account the requirement for scientific
 and technical development of all sectors as well as stressing the 57 key
 projects.  Later, because Khrushchev tore up the agreements, we shifted to
 stressing, regarding as key projects and organizing all the trades and
 professions to tackle jet propulsion technology, atomic technology and
 electronics.  Our practice has proved that this kind of science and
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 technology plan that gives priority to scientific research and combines
 key projects with common projects can play a satisfactory role in
 organizing and promoting the development of our country's science and
 technology.
 3.  We should organize our ranks well.  After we have formulated a plan,
 we should organize our scientific and technical personnel to realize this
 plan.  At that time, the numbers of our scientific and technical personnel
 were small, their foundations were weak, their tasks were heavy and the
 difficulties facing them were .very great.  For example, we did not know
 much about jet propulsion technology and atomic energy and we could only
 buy some materials from abroad to read.  However, we could only get a
 rough idea from these materials because the detailed technical materials
 were confidential and could not be bought anywhere.  What were we to do?
 According to the unified national plan, we organized five contingents,
 namely, the research institutions, the higher education institutions, the
 industrial departments, the national defense_ science committee and the
 local scientific research force, and assigned to these contingents clearly
 defined tasks according to their strong points.  Since we had a unified
 plan, no one could carry out his work at his will without taking into
 account the work of other people and all people closely coordinated and
 copperated by means of division of labor and jointly tackle the major
 technical problem hurdles.  This was a nationwide cooperation and coordina-
 tion of all the activities of the nation like pieces in a chess game.  At
 that time, all the units were willing to accept whatever tasks were assigned
 and felt glory in doing them because these tasks were assigned and felt
 glory  in doing them because these tasks were what all our party members,
 all our army and the people throughout our country wished and trusted them
 to fulfill.  After these five contingents were mobilized, people supported
 one another.  If only the fraternal units have the need, the coordinating
 units will give all-out support and facilitate things, either in technical
 know-how or in material supplies.  There were no malpractices of shifting
 responsibility or mutual blockade, therefore the work efficiency was very
 high.
 At that time, our ranks of scientific and technical personnel were small
 and were to be expanded through continuously recruiting new workers.  We
 paid great attention to the problem of distributing jobs to college grad-
 uates and returned students from abroad.  If any of them was not assigned
 a job related to what he had studied, was not properly assigned or had
 nothing to do through being assigned a job, we had the power to make
 adjustments and assign him to a new job.  As we were in charge of the
 tackling of the major problem hurdles, we knew what kind of people were
 needed by which department and how to assign jobs properly.  This was done
 in the manner of a commander in chief directing a battle.  He had to know
 the kind of troops that were needed on which front and how many troops
 were needed.  Having taken the personnel power in our hands, we combined
 the management of the tasks with that of personnel.  As a result, we
 enabled these young intellectuals to utilize their strong points and get
 appropriate jobs, thus, they vigorously struggled in the van under the
 guidance and command of old specialists and played a material role in
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 tackling the major technical problems hurdles.  Now they have already
 become the backbone force on various fronts.
 4.  We should strengthen the centralized unified leadership.  Modern
 science and technology differs widely from that in the 18th and 19th
 centuries.  At that time, scientific research was often the result of the
 independent efforts of individuals and an individual was able to achieve
 many inventions and discoveries in his life.  Things are vastly different
 now.  True, some research o~ basic theory and technology, such as research
 in certain mathematical theories, can be done by adopting old methods, but
 the research of major basic theories and the research and manufacture of
 major projects and equipment must be done by means of modern experimenta-
 tion.  Therefore, an individual, unit or even a whole trade or local area
 does not have sufficient resources to carry this out and we have to con-
 centrate the strength of the whole nation in doing it.  In manufacturing
 guided missiles, atom bombs, airplanes, warships and computers, we needed
 many new-type materials and sophisticated apparatuses and precision instru-
 ments.  At that time, these things were not available either at home or
 abroad.  We organized our own force to produce them by division of labor
 and cooperation and fixed a deadline for the fulfillment of the tasks.  At
 that time, we needed more than 13,000 kinds of new materials and none of
 these materials had ever been produced at home.  Because of the centralized
 and unified leadership and the vigorous coordination and cooperation, how-
 ever, we succeeded in testing all these materials in a short time which
 all satisfied the prescribed state quality standards.  To satisfy the need
 of the development of science and technology work, we organized the force
 of the whole nation to test produce the "nine major equipments" for making
 the special types of materials that were of particularly great thickness,
 thinness, breadth and length.  It was a pity that the "Great Cultural Revo-
 lution" put an end to all these efforts; otherwise, the technical level of
 our country's industry would have reached a higher plane.  This was an
 obvious example of science and technology promoting industrial development.
 If we had not concentrated our science and technical force and did not
 have the centralized command of our scientific and technical personnel, we
 would not have fulfilled such magnificent tasks even if we had wished to.
 These centralized efforts resulted in successes in making products of highly
 sophisticated technology, the corresponding development of many new indus-
 trial sectors and the corresponding establishment of many new branches of
 learning.  People call this period the "golden age" of our country's scien-
 tific and technical work.  This tells us a truth that in doing all our work
 we have to proceed from the needs of the state and that this is the starting
 point for us in considering and handling problems.  As long as the state
 has the need, we should take up the management.  We should not be apprehen-
 sive of managing too many things.  We should manage the personnel, finance
 and materials because the state needs us to take them up in our management.
 It is also because of the state's needs that we demand centralized and uni-
 fied planning, the mobilization of the five contingents and their coordina-
 tion in solving the contradictions that have emerged.  Thus we will be able
 to bring about the greatest return for our limited resources of labor,
 materials and funds and avoid the dispersion of the work force and duplica-
 tion of scientific research projects.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 At that time, we called this method of tackling major technical problems
 hurdles under centralized and unified leadership "developing branches of
 learning through the processes of fulfilling tasks."  This is a good method
 of developing science and technology.  Of course, this is not the only
 method.  Modern science and technology is very complicated, so we should
 adopt many ways of developing it and should not seek a "uniform" method.
 We must not discriminate against the research of basic science.  Basic
 science and applied science supplement one another.  We should be more far-
 sighted and should not look down upon basic scientific research because it
 does not bring along any tangible economic results in a short time.  Basic
 scientific research is the foundation of applied scientific research.
 Therefore, it is impossible to carry out applied scientific research with-
 out a certain amount of basic scientific research.  Our principle must be
 "strengthening applied scientific research while paying attention to basic
 scientific research" as was pointed out in Comrade Hu Yaobang's report to
 the 12th party congress.  Premier Zhou expounded on this problem in the
 past and recently so has Comrade Zhao Ziyang, time and again.
 The 12th party congress has already formulated a magnificent plan for
 socialist modernization and the Fifth Session of the Fifth NPC will soon
 examine, discuss and approve the Sixth Five-Year Plan.  The prospects of
 socialism are as beautiful as a silk embroidery.  Now the problem is the
 earnest implementation of the policies related to our intellectuals.
 Recently, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that in order to actually achieve the
 20-year development plan, in order to complete the construction of a large
 number of major key projects and in order to tackle major scientific and
 technical problems hurdles, "the first thing we should do is soundly solve
 the problem related to the management and employment of our scientific and
 technical labor force."  He said that "in order to break the boundaries of
 departments and localities, and rationally employ this force, we must unify
 its management.  This will be impossible, if we do not have a strong
 authoritative organ."  I fully agree with this opinion.  Now, we have a
 scientific and technical labor force of more than 5.7 million people.  This
 is not a small technical force.  We have some fundamental scientific
 research equipment and a larger amount of funds.  These conditions are much
 more favorable than those when I was in charge of this work.  Now, we are
 speeding up the development of integrated circuits, especially the develop-
 ment of highly condensed ones with extremely great speed and also the new
 generation of computers.  This is of tremendous significance in promoting
 the development of science and technology.  As long as we overcome decen-
 tralism.and departmental selfishness and strengthen our centralized and
 unified leadership, as long as we put an end to the malpractices of shift-
 ing responsibility to one another and of mutual blockade, but on the con-
 trary, exercise unified planning, coordinate all the activities of the
 nation like pieces in a chess game, carry out a rational division of labor,
 support one another and carry out nationwide cooperation and as long as we
 give full play to the superiority of the socialist system, we will be able
 to create a new situation in our country`s science and technology work and
 bring along a new "golden age" in this work.

 The key to the four modernizations is the modernization of science and
 technology.  In order to achieve the modernization of science and tech-
 nology, we should rely on the intellectuals who master modern science and
 technology.  Without intellectuals it will be impossible to achieve either
 the four modernizations or the magnificent goal of quadrupling.  This idea
 has recently been repeatedly propagated in our press.  However, some people
 are still not convinced, and think that the party has gone too far in
 implementing its policies related to the intellectuals.  This is a very
 erroneous viewpoint and is very harmful to the socialist cause.  We must
 teach these people to correct their views and to treat this problem with a
 strategical view.  The prejudice of looking down upon knowledge and science
 and discriminating against intellectuals was originally the reflection of
 ignorance and backwardness.  As a legacy of the old society, it has been of
 long standing in our society.  This prejudice also has its influence in our
 party.  Aggravated by the influence of the "leftist" ideology, various kinds
 of prejudice of looking down on and discriminating against intellectuals
 have emerged in the minds of some of our cadres.  This also has a very long
 history.  During the period of the Red Army, the medical and telecommunica-
 tions personnel came from KMT troops.  This work could only be done by
 employing these people because the worker and peasant cadres were not cap-
 able of doing it.  With the education of the party, these people quickly
 became our technical cadres and some of them became ministers of our govern-
 ment after the founding of the PRC.  They have played a very satisfactory
 role in our revolution and construction.  At that time, they were paid
 salaries of money, while our commanders in chief and political commissars
 received their payments in kind instead of money.  They led a better life
 than us.  However, some people did not think this was right and complained.
 During the war of resistance against Japan, we had our base areas, field
 armies and border area governments and needed to set up hospitals and indus-
 trial enterprises and arsenals to make and repair weapons.  Moreover, we had
 to carry out radio telecommunications and establish newspaper offices and
 broadcast stations.  Thus we needed a larger number of intellectuals to join
 the revolutionary ranks.  However, there were obstacles and the intellectuals
 suffered discrimination.  Therefore, in 1939, the party Central Committee
 issued the "Resolution on Recruiting a Large Number of Intellectuals."
 Since then, a large number of intellectuals came to the liberated areas.
 This problem was not solved after the liberation of the whole country and
 there have always been conflicts on it.  In 1956, the party Central Com-
 mittee held a national meeting on problems related to the intellectuals,
 in which Premier Zhou gave the "Report on the Problems Related to Intellec-
 tuals."  He pointed out that at that time, the main tendency in our party
 on the problems related to the intellectuals was factionalism, an under-
 estimate of the tremendous progress in politics and in their work of .our
 intellectual circles, an underestimate of the intellectuals' important role
 in our socialist cause and an ignorance of the fact that the intellectuals
 were a part of the working class.  He emphatically expounded on the position
 and role of the intellectuals in our socialist construction.  He said:  In
 the final analysis, the reason why we should build up a socialist economy
 is to satisfy, to the greatest possible extent, the constantly increasing
 material and cultural demands of the whole society.  In order to achieve

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 this aim, we must continuously develop a social productive force and raise
 labor productivity and must constantly increase and improve socialist pro-
 duction on the basis of a highly developed technology.  Therefore, during
 the period of socialism, we have a demand even more urgent than in any
 other period for fully raising our technology of production and for fully
 developing science and utilizing our knowledge of science.  Therefore,
 apart from the necessity of relying on the conscientious labor of the
 working class and the broad ranks of peasants, it is necessary for us to
 rely on the conscientious labor of the intellectuals.  In other words, we
 must rely on the close cooperation of manual and mental labor and the
 fraternal alliance of workers, peasants and intellectuals, thus the problem
 was initially solved.  However, a reverse tendency emerged in 1957 and 1958.
 At the national scientific planning conference and the national conference
 on theatrical creation held in Guangzhou in 1962, many scientists, writers
 and artists again aired their views on intellectual policies.  Consequently,
 discussions on an intellectual issue were added to the agenda of the
 Guangzhou conference.  Premier Zhou personally attended the conference.
 Premier Zhou, Comrade Chen Yi and I, as well as Comrade Guo Moruo, dis-
 cussed this issue on several occasions.  We held that intellectuals are not
 an independent class.  They can serve the bourgeoisie and they can also
 serve the proletariat.  We have engaged in socialism for many years and most
 of the intellectuals have been trained by us since the founding of the PRC.
 How can we say that they are bourgeois intellectuals?  We proposed to
 "remove the label from the intellectuals and provide them with a halo" by
 removing the label of bourgeois intellectuals and proclaiming them intel-
 lectuals of the working people.  Premier Zhou, Comrade Chen Yi and I spoke
 at the meetings.  Premier Zhou delivered the first speech.  He expressed
 his heartfelt pleasure at the growth and development of the ranks of our
 intellectuals.  The generation of old intellectuals had succeeded in train-
 ing a generation of new intellectuals, both of them forming socialist intel-
 lectual circles.  They had made tremendous progress after 12 years of trans-
 formation and trials.  Like the workers and peasants, most intellectuals
 love the motherland.  The premier said, we we're greatly moved by your great
 love for the motherland.  This was the pride in our intellectuals!
 Before his return to Beijing, Premier Zhou asked Comrade Chen Yi to deliver
 a speech announcing the removal of the label of bourgeois intellectuals.
 Comrade Chen Yi first transmitted to the scientists, writers and artists
 attending the conference Premier Zhou's words that they were the intellec-
 tuals of the people, revolutionary intellectuals, and mental laborers who
 served the proletariat and should be freed of the label of bourgeois
 intellectuals.  "The workers, peasants and intellectuals are the three com-
 ponent parts of the Chinese working people."  He emphatically said:  "We
 should no longer put the label of bourgeois intellectuals on all intellec-
 tuals after 12 years of transformation and trials."  Comrade Chen Yi made
 it fairly clear by saying, "They are still uncomplaining, are still willing
 to follow us and still do not lose confidence in the Communist Party after
 12 years of transformation and trials.  We can at least see a person's
 heart.  If the Communist Party still fails to test or distinguigh a person
 in 8, 10 or 12 years, the Communist Party does not have foresight!"  "Did

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Marx, Engels, Lenin or Chairman Mao ever say that the Communist Party does
 not respect knowledge and science?  No one has ever made such a remark.
 Ignorance is a great enemy.  Imperialism is an enemy, feudalism is an
 enemy and ignorance--with hundreds of millions of people having no knowledge
 and no scientific knowledge--is also a great enemy."
 After being "freed from the label and provided with a halo," the broad
 section of our intellectuals felt warm to the bottom of their hearts.
 Pleased and active, they were quick in attaining many achievements in
 scientific research.  This is the fundamental reason for the emergence of
 the "golden age" in our scientific and technological work.
 If we look through history, we can see that we did the work of "removing the
 label from the intellectuals and providing them with a halo" as far back as
 in 1962 during the Guangzhou conference.  The conclusion affirming that the
 intellectuals are socialist laborers and a part of, the working class was
 reached at that time.  However, the emergence of the "Cultural Revolution"
 overthrew all this.  Under the sabotage of Lin Biao and the "gang of four,"
 intellectuals were again labeled as "bourgeoisie," "reactionary authorities"
 and "the stinking ninth category."  They were severely hit and humiliated
 and were unable to stand up.  It was necessary for the leading comrades of
 the party at various levels to actively create good working conditions
 for the scientific and technical personnel and take good care of them
 politically and in their livelihood.  During the difficult period, in an
 effort to care for the scientists, I called in the aid of the navy for some
 fish, in the aid of the Beijing and Guangzhou Military Regions and the
 Xinjiang Military District for some meat and in the aid of some other locali-
 ties for some soybeans and edible oil.  In the first place, their labor
 was a very arduous one, and they shouldered a very important task of tack-
 ling key problems.  The party should take good care of them.  However,
 right and wrong were confounded during the "Cultural Revolution."  All this
 was regarded as the "revisionist line" and was criticized until it was
 "discredited."  They criticized what they called "scientific and technical
 fish" and "scientific and technical meat."  The "leftist" errors developed
 to a very high degree.  This not only subjected the intellectuals to great
 humiliation but also China's scientific and technological undertakings and
 even the entire social undertaking to great damage.  In the late 1950's, we
 marched toward the modernization of science and other new branches of
 learning, with such modernizations as transistors, calculators and lasers.
 At that time, some Western countries had also just started at the begin-
 ning.  Twenty years later, the gap between foreign countries and us is
 greater.  This is a.fact known to all.  Therefore, judging by the history
 of our party, it has never been able to dispense with intellectuals, either
 in its revolutionary or construction cause.  Whenever we pay attention to
 intellectuals and adopt a correct policy toward them our cause makes
 progress and develops.  On the other hand, whenever we discriminate against
 intellectuals and adopt an erroneous policy toward them our cause suffers a
 setback.  This is particularly true in the period of socialist construc-
 tion.

 Since the smashing of the "gang .of four," particularly since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the party has, in the course of
 setting things to rights, reexamined and established the party's policy
 toward the intellectuals, reaffirming that, by and large, the intellectuals
 constitute a component part of China's working class.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping
 has delivered many speeches on this issue.  Consequently, the intellectuals
 throughout the country are pleased and have peace of mind for being able to
 stand up.  They have made great contributions by actively working on vari-
 ous fronts.  The party has now made clear its policy toward the intellec-
 tuals and has issued repeated injunctions on its implementation.  The
 "Revised Draft Constitution of the PRC" submitted to the current NPC for
 consideration has also made clear in its preamble that in building socialism
 it is imperative to rely on the workers, peasants and intellectuals.  That
 is to say, the workers, peasants and intellectuals are the three main social
 forces in our country and form the principal part of our people.  It is
 necessary to tell the broad section of our cadres and masses to fully
 understand the position and role of the intellectuals in our socialist
 modernization.
 There are some people who say that "our evaluation of intellectuals is
 exaggerated" and that intellectuals are "cocky once again."  These words
 are groundless.  At present, our implementation of the policies related to
 the intellectuals has just begun and the resistance we, are encountering
 both within and outside our party is not small and can be regarded as
 being quite stubborn.  I had a talk with a GUANGMING RIBAO reporter in
 August of this year. ,Most people approved of this talk when it was pub-
 lished in the newspaper.  There were also people who opposed this talk,
 criticizing the comrades in the GUANGMING RIBAO office for speaking on a
 bourgeois stand.  I have indeed offended some people on this issue.  How-
 ever, what is to be done?  We must continue to fight for the interests of
 the party and state, for the four modernizations and for the overall imple-
 ment~tion of our intellectual policies.
 On the question of implementing the policy toward the intellectuals, it is
 still necessary for our press and press institutions to make a loud appeal
 to the public.  It is no good to talk about it in general terms; it is
 necessary to make a public criticism.  It is also no good to make a mild
 criticism; it is necessary to make a sharp criticism.  Sometimes it is even
 necessary to conduct some struggles.  Neither Marx nor Engels said that all
 intellectuals are reactionary.  They always made a concrete analysis of
 intellectuals and gave different evaluations to different intellectuals.
 Both Marx and Engels fully affirmed and highly evaluated the contributions
 to human progress made by such great scientists as Newton, Galileo and
 Darwin.  Engels also specifically said that even under the capitalist
 system, it is also possible to turn out from among the university students
 "a king of proletariat who engages in mental labor" and who fights shoulder
 to shoulder with the fraternal workers engaging in manual labor.  For this
 reason, it is necessary for us to conduct ideological education through
 various means to enable the broad section of cadres and masses to under-
 stand the idea that in developing modernization, making our economy prosper,
 carrying out the construction of the two civilizations and achieving the

 goal of quadrupling by the end of this century, we cannot dispense with
 scientific and technical progress and we cannot dispense with intellec-
 tuals.
 At present, we have to pay particular attention to giving play to the role
 of middle-aged intellectuals., The middle-aged intellectuals ranging from
 40 to 50 years old are a generation of new intellectuals who grew up under
 the direct cultivation of the party.  They are a generation serving as a
 link between the past and future, carrying forward the revolutionary cause
 and forging ahead into the future.  They love the motherland, socialism and
 the party and they never change their original intention, even under adverse
 circumstances.  Having laid a relatively solid foundation in professional
 knowledge, they have made great contributions in the field of science and
 technology to the cause of China's modernization program.  These middle-
 aged intellectuals are the backbone on all the fronts.  The heavy task of
 developing modern science and technology, building both material and
 spiritual civilization and raising the scientific and cultural level of the
 whole nation rests on their shoulders.  This is a glorious mission entrusted
 to them by history.  They have a heavy work load and have made great con-
 tributions.  However, their salaries are low and they have a lot of diffi-
 culties in their livelihood.  The party's policy toward the intellectuals
 has not been completely implemented among them.  In many departments and
 localities, they have not received their due respect and good care.  The
 problems related to their working and living conditions have not been
 solved in a satisfactory manner.  This merits the attention of our leading
 comrades at various levels, particularly the leading comrades in factories
 and institutions.  The academic ranks and titles of intellectuals should be
 solved in a satisfactory manner.  However, there is also the problem of pay
 and conditions that should be gradually solved by adopting various specific
 measures.  In short, improving the working and living conditions of middle-
 aged intellectuals has become a very urgent issue.  Marx said long ago that
 mental labor is a complicated one that should receive relatively better
 remunerations.  We should considerably increase their salaries.  We should
 practically solve this problem by overcoming the egalitarian mentality in
 our ranks.  It is necessary to free the intellectuals of their trouble at
 home so that they can wholeheartedly engage in the four modernizations.
 The advanced deeds of Comrades Jiang Zhuying and Luo Jianfu publicized in
 succession recently by GUANGMING RIBAO and GONGREN RIBAO are very touching.
 The communist spirit of these two Communist Party members is worth our
 learning.  They had bright prospects in the first place because they had
 high consciousness and made great contributions to the state.  Comrade Wang
 Daheng, director of the Changcun Optical Machinery Research Institute where
 Comrade Jiang Zhuying worked before his death, is a noted Chinese opticist.
 He had made a great contribution to the optical cause of our country.
 Comrade Jiang Zhuying was precisely a student of his pride, to whom he was
 going to hand over the future task.  It was a pity, however, that Comrade
 Jiang Zhuying died while he was "tackling key problems."  This constituted
 a loss for the state.  Such intellectuals as Jiang Zhuying and Luo Jianfu
 are excellent representatives of the contemporary Chinese intellectuals and
 are a valuable treasure of the party and state.  We all deeply regretted

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 their unfortunate early deaths.  What is more important, however, is that
 the leading party and government cadres at various levels should take good
 care of and show great concern for thousands upon thousands of living Jiang
 Zhuying's and Luo Jianfu's.  We should draw lessons from the early death of
 these middle-aged intellectuals.  Have the. leading comrades of our party
 and government organizations at various levels failed to do what they ought
 to have done and take better care of them?  It should be noted that, as far
 as our country is concerned, our scientific and technological personnel are
 not many but are few.  Those scientists and technical experts who love the
 motherland, work diligently and conscientiously and have real ability and
 training are our national treasure.  Naturally, the intellectuals also have
 their shortcomings and not all intellectuals are competent persons.  I hope
 all intellectuals will study hard, strive to make progress, overcome their
 shortcomings, raise their professional standards and strive to become both
 Red and expert and make more contributions to the motherland.

 EDUCATE THE PARTY MEMBERS IN THE NEW PARTY CONSTITUTION, MAKE IDEOLOGICAL
 PREPARATIONS FOR PARTY RECTIFICATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 11-16, 24
 [Speech by Song Renqiong [1345 0117 4522] on 19 November 1982 at the
 national conference on educating party members]
 [Text]  Comrades, this national conference on educating party members is an
 important meeting for implementing the 12th party congress spirit, studying
 and making arrangements for education of party members in accordance with
 the demands of the new party constitution, and preparing for party rectifi-
 cation.  I now want to give some views.
 I.  The New Party Constitution Is the Best Since the Founding of the Party
 The new party constitution since its promulgation has drawn a strong
 response inside and outside the party and at home and abroad.  Many com-
 rades hold that the new party constitution "is the quintessence of the
 party's historical experience and of the wisdom of the whole party" and is
 "the weapon for rectifying and building the .party.   The new party consti-
 tution affirms in charter form the correct line since the third plenary
 session, and there are great prospects for our party and our cause.
 A number of foreign publications and press agencies have also held that the
 new party constitution is "sober and realistic in tone," "expresses the
 resolve to refurbish the party work style," and has laid down a "Chinese-
 style path for building socialism."
 How should we judge whether a communist party constitution is good or not?
 There can only be one criterion and that is whether it is solved well or
 not the question of integrating Marxism-Leninism with the practice of a
 country's revolution.  I will now apply this criterion to analyze the ques-
 tion of why we say that the constitution of the 12th party congress is the
 best since the founding of the party.
 1.  The new party constitution meets the needs of the governing party.  Ours
 has been the governing party for more than 30 years.  The constitution of
 the eighth party congress touched on this question.  However, as the state
 'had not been in existence long at that time, the conditions for solving this
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 question were not sufficiently ripe.  The constitution of the 12th party
 congress takes full consideration for the position of the governing party
 and has appropriately made a series of specific regulations for ensuring
 that the organizations at all levels of the governing party and all its
 members have rules to follow.  The party constitution includes for the
 first time the stipulation that "the party must conduct its activities
 within the framework of the constitution and the law."  Ours is the govern-
 ing party that leads political power in the whole country.  The party's
 line, principles and policies are the concentrated expression of the common
 interests and will of the people of all nationalities throughout the land.
 Through the constitution and the laws formulated by the state organs of
 power, our party's leadership of the people of the whole country is also
 the concentrated expression of the common interests and will of the people
 of all nationalities throughout the land, and has also become the will of
 the state.  Hence, under our socialist system, the will of the people, the
 state and the party are identical.  For Communist Party members, no matter
 what post they hold, practicing and adhering to the constitution means
 carrying out the will of the party.  Any tendency of setting the constitu-
 tion and the law against the tasks of the party, of weak concept of law and
 discipline, or of failure to observe the law or to strictly enforce it will
 weaken the position of the governing party.  All such tendencies are intol-
 erable.  Everyone still remembers the incident that occurred a few years
 ago:  The masses asked us "whether the constitution or the county CPC com-
 mittee is the greater."  This is a simple question and also a sharp criti-
 cism.  The new party constitution has now made a totally unequivocal reply
 to this question.  The position of the governing party poses new demands
 not only on the framework of the party's activities but also on the party
 members and cadres.  The constitution of the 12th party congress lays down
 regulations suited to the position of the governing party with regard to
 the rights and obligations of party members, the basic conditions for party
 cadres, and the tasks of the party organizations at all levels.  The new
 party constitution demands that the party members "always be ordinary mem-
 bers of the laboring people,'' that "party cadres are the people's servants,"
 that "apart from individual interests and work duties within the framework
 stipulated .by the system and policy, no party member may pursue any private
 interest or special powers," and that "the party's leading cadres at all
 levels, whether they were democratically elected or appointed by the leading
 organs, do not hold their posts for life, and all of them can be transferred
 or relieved of their posts."  The appearance o,f these stipulations in the
 new party constitution shows that our party has become a mature governing
 party.
 2.  The new party constitution meets the needs of bringing order out of
 chaos.  Many of the clauses of the new party constitution can be described
 as correcting the mistakes of the 10 years of internal disorder and con-
 solidating the results of bringing order out of chaos.  The new party con-
 stitution gives a complete and scientific outline of the party's ideological
 line:  "Proceed from reality in everything, link theory with reality, seek
 truth from facts, and test and develop the truth in the course of practice."
 This is a summation of the party's positive and negative experiences in
 ideological line for a long time in the past, and is also the ideological
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 weapon for continuing to bring order out of chaos in all respects in the
 future.  The new party constitution stipulates that "the party prohibits
 any form of personality cult."  This shows that our party has absorbed the
 serious lessons of indulging in personality cult in the past and is
 resolved to establish correct relationships between the leadership and the
 party and between the leadership and the masses in accordance with the
 historical materialist viewpoint.  The new party constitution also stipu-
 lates that "no  arty members no matter how high or low his post, may
 decide himself on major issues."  This has always been our party's con-
 sistent principle.  It has also been p.ut forward in the light of the
 serious damage suffered by the party in the past as a result of the indi-
 vidual autocracy with "one person having the say" that appeared in our
 party for a time in the past.
 3.  The new party constitution suits the needs of socialist modernization.
 In accordance with the main contradictions in Chinese society, the party's
 general task in the present stage, and the focus of party work, the new
 party constitution gives prominence to socialist modernization.  This is
 the first time that a party constitution has assigned such an important
 position to the task of modernization.  The new party constitution also
 stipulates that "party leadership is mainly political, ideological and
 organizational leadership."  This has thus solved in principle the major
 question of how to uphold party leadership in the cause of China's social-
 ist construction, and has prevented lack of division of party and govern-
 ment and of party and enterprises, with low work efficiency, from con-
 tinuing to affect the progress of the cause of socialist construction.
 The new party constitution stipulates that the rank of party cadres must be
 revolutionized, younger, better educated and more specialized, that the
 party cadres must "undergo party training, investigation and examination,"
 and that the leading cadres at all levels must meet six basic criteria.
 The party's cadres are a backbone force in the socialist modernization
 cause, and building a high-quality cadre force is precisely a stipulation
 of strategic significance that our party has laid down in order to meet the
 needs of the new period.
 4.  The new party constitution suits the needs of building socialist
 spiritual civilization and socialist democracy.  Enhancing the masses'
 communist awareness, so that the people will genuinely become the masters
 of the country, is an expression of the superiority of socialism, and is
 also an historic task shouldered by the party.  The new party constitution
 points out in its general program:  "While leading the people to build a
 high degree of material civilization," the party "leads them to build a high
 degree of socialist spiritual civilization," and it must "lead the people to
 develop socialism, put the socialist system on a sound basis, and consoli-
 date the people's democratic dictatorship."  The new party constitution
 therefore puts forth a whole series of specific demands regarding the
 stipulations on the tasks of party members, party cadres and party organi-
 zations at all levels.

 5.  The new party constitution suits the needs of achieving a fundamental
 turn for the better in party work style.  The three basic demands put for-
 ward by the new party constitution regarding a high degree of ideological
 and political unity, wholehearted service for the people, and the upholding
 of democratic centralism express in concentrated form the strong will of
 our party to achieve a fundamental turn for the better in its work style.
 In order to fulfill the three basic demands in party building, the new
 party constitution lays down a whole series of regulations in the chapters
 on party members, party cadres, the party's organizational system, the
 party's grassroots organizations and the party's discipline.
 The five "suitings" mentioned above show that the reason why the new party
 constitution is good is because it fully embodies a high degree of integra-
 tion of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and
 a high degree of integration of Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the vanguard
 force of the proletarian with the practice of party building.  The entire
 contents of the constitution's 10 chapters and 50 articles are closely
 linked to our target of endeavor, to the destiny of the state and people,
 and to the tasks of revival and reform facing us.  Engels said that the
 value of the resolutions of a party congress depends on their scientific
 nature.  The five "suitings" we have spoken of as properties of the new
 party constitution are precisely the outstanding hallmarks of the scien-
 tific nature of this party constitution.
 Engels was one of the writers of the "Communist Manifesto."  Throughout his
 life, he took part in revising, examining and approving many party constitu-
 tions and programs.  In this respect, he gave some very pithy expositions.
 He once held the viewpoint that the history of a party is the best exposi-
 tion on the party's constitution.  In our previous passages, we evaluated
 the party constitution approved by the 12th party congress from the angle
 of its scientific nature.  Now we are going to use this viewpoint of
 Engels' and proceed from the evolution of the party's history and of its
 previous constitutions to look into the question of whether the 12th con-
 gress' constitution is one of the best party constitutions since the found-
 ing of the CPC.  During the 61 years since the founding of the CPC, it has
 formulated 12 party programs and constitutions (all are party constitutions,
 except the one approved by the first party congress which was called the
 "Program of the CPC").  In the 24 years from the founding of the party to
 the time before the seventh party congress was held, six party programs
 and constitutions were formulated with the direct assistance and guidance
 of the Comintern.  This was a result of the international and domestic
 political conditions at that time.  The constitution of the seventh party
 congress was the first party constitution that was independently formulated
 by our party after the dissolution of the Comintern.  It was an exercise in
 integrating Marxism-Leninism with China's revolutionary practice and was a
 party constitution that facilitated the prosperity and development of the
 party and guided the revolution in vigorously developing until nationwide
 victory was achieved.  The constitution of the eighth party congress was
 the first party constitution that was formulated after we seized state
 power.  It inherited the strong points of the seventh congress''~constitu-
 tion and put forward new requirements for the party in order to make sure

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 its position as a party in power.  What is especially valuable was that the
 report on the revision of the party constitution given at the eighth con-
 gress fully expounded on the question related to the personality cult.
 The eighth congress' constitution was a good one.  It was a pity that some
 of the regulations of this constitution were not carried out.  The consti-
 tutions of the 9th and 10th party congresses reflected our party's mistakes
 during the "Great Cultural Revolution."  The 11th congress' constitution
 was formulated not long after the smashing of the "gang of four."  As the
 party was not sufficiently mentally prepared for the overall elimination
 of the "leftist" mistakes, this party constitution was not free from the
 guidance of the "leftist" ideology, though it had played some positive
 roles.  It was precisely through drawing on both the positive and negative
 experiences of the previous party constitutions and through making further
 developments and improvements on the basis of the 7th and 8th congresses'
 constitutions that the constitution of the 12th congress was formulated
 through 3 years of collecting the wisdom of the whole party.  Compared with
 all the previous party constitutions, the 12th party congress' constitution
 deserves to be regarded as being the best one since the founding of the CPC.
 A recent report reflects the idea of some people that regarding the 12th
 congress' constitution as the "best party constitution since the founding
 of the CPC" will lead to negating the history and give rise to difficulties
 in evaluating the party constitution of the 13th and 14th party congresses.
 This idea is wrong.  By regarding the 12th party congress' constitution as
 the best one, we mean that it inherits the previous constitutions and
 facilitates further development.  Since it inherits the previous ones, it
 certainly does not negate the past nor the party's history.  On the con-
 trary, it scientifically confirms the history of the party.  Since it
 facilitates future development, it has not yet been 100 percent perfect
 and should be tested in practice.  If it is found that some of the stipula-
 tions of this constitution are not suitable or need additions, the 13th and
 14th party congresses must and can revise it, add something to it and
 develop it in order to improve it.  These comrades' apprehension for negating
 the party's history precisely proves that they are not familiar with the
 party's history and their fear of a harmful influence on precisely eval-
 uating the future shows that they do not really understand our infinitely
 bright future.
 II.   A Good Party Constitution Is Formulated To Be Implemented.  Therefore,
 We Must Act in Accordance With the New Party Constitution
 "A step of actual action is more important than a dozen programs."
 ("Selected Works of Marx and Rngels," Vol 3'~ p 3)  This well-known saying
 by Marx tells us that we should not pay attention only to the formulation
 of the program but fail to practice it.  It is very relevant to use these
 words of Marx to explain the importance o.f implementing the new party con-
 stitution.  Since the founding of the CPC, 12 party constitutions have been
 formulated.  None of the victories of our revolution could have been
 achieved if our party had not formulated and implemented its correct con-
 stitutions.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Since its promulgation, the new party constitution has been unanimously
 well received, both at home and abroad.  However, there are some people who
 have expressed their worries that some of the stipulations in the constitu-
 tion cannot possibly be carried out.  These worries are not completely
 groundless.  Quite a few of the correct stipulations in the eighth party
 congress' constitution have not been satisfactorily carried out and soon
 after the congress there emerged the movement of fighting against rightist
 deviation and then the 10 years of civil disorder caused by the "Great
 Cultural Revolution."  Should we allow, then, people's worries to continu-
 ously exist?  No, we should not.  We have to do some work in order to
 establish in people's minds confidence in the unquestionable implementation
 of the 12th party congress' constitution.  We should tell people that the
 implementation of the 8th congress' constitution was hindered because of
 certain historical conditions.  These historical conditions were:  1) dogma-
 tism and personality cult seriously fettered the party's ideology; 2) the
 "leftist" tendency seriously existed in our party; 3) the inner-party
 political life, especially the political life of the high-level leading
 stratum, was abnormal and democratic centralism was undermined; and
 4) though the shift of the emphasis of the party's work had been put for-
 ward, it could not have been carried out because of the "leftist" mistakes
 in the theory and practice related to the problem of class struggle.  Now
 all these problems have been sorted out and resolved.  First, ideologically
 speaking, we have broken away from the longstanding serious fetters of
 dogmatism and personality cult and have reestablished the ideological line
 of Marxism-Leninism.  Second, we have already sorted out and eliminated in
 an overall manner the "leftist" mistakes arising during and before the
 "Great Cultural Revolution."  Third, inner-party democratic life has
 already embarked on a route of normal development.  In this respect, the
 CPC Central Committee has taken the lead in setting an example.  Fourth,
 we have already carried out a systematic criticism of and eliminated the
 erroneous theory of "regarding class struggle as the key link" and "carry-
 ing on the revolution under the proletarian dictatorship" that was put
 forward during the "Great Cultural Revolution."
 The emphasis of the party's work has already been shifted on socialist
 modernization.  The new party constitution and all other important docu-
 ments of the 12th party congress were formulated by the party after pro-
 foundly summing up its historical experience, comprehensively analyzing the
 actual conditions and evaluating all the favorable and unfavorable condi-
 tions.  Our full confidence in the implementation of the new party constitu-
 tion is scientifically based.  In my opinion, if we clearly explain to these
 comrades the above-mentioned reasons, they will be confident rather than
 worried about the implementation of the new party constitution.
 As for a few others, they have confidence neither in the implementation of
 the new party constitution nor in any of our causes and communism.  Often
 these people cannot be convinced by mere reasoning.  We should allow them
 to watch for 1 year or several years and then let them use facts to correct
 their mistakes in understanding by themselves.  However, this only applies
 to the people outside the party.  Our party members are not allowed to
 spread any erroneous ideas that may injure the serious nature of the new
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 party constitution.  Nor are any of our party members allowed to refuse to
 implement the party constitution on the excuse of lacking confidence.  This
 is the discipline of the party.
 The implementation of the new party constitution begins on the day when it
 was approved, that is, 6 September 1982.  This is effective on a large
 scale for every party organization and member.  It cannot be delayed until
 confidence is established or until the party rectification is carried out.
 Our publicizing and implementing of the new party constitution is aimed at
 laying a foundation for the party rectification next year.  We should first
 carry out education and then examine the results.  At a later time after
 education we will evaluate whether a party member is qualified or unquali-
 fied and criticize him for his shortcomings, and thus we will be able to
 make them gladly accept criticism. and evaluation.  When we were in Yanan,
 we rectified the party work style first and then held a party congress.
 After the party rectification, we unified the thoughts of the whole party
 and formulated a correct line.  As a result, the seventh congress became a
 congress of unity and victory.  This time, we held the 12th party congress
 first and then began to carry out party rectification.  Our party is such a
 big party that in order to satisfactorily carry out party rectification, we
 have to spend some time in publicizing and educating people on the party
 constitution after the congress was held before we carry out an overall
 party rectification.  We must very carefully do all the preparatory work
 and must pay extremely close attention to this work.  It is wrong to think
 that this work can be delayed until next year when the party rectification
 has begun and thus slacken our efforts at present.  Of course, during and
 after party rectification, we should continue to study and publicize the
 new party constitution.  We must clearly explain this to all the comrades
 of party committees at all levels and to comrades of the propaganda,
 organization and discipline inspection departments of these committees.
 III.  In Order To Implement the New Party Constitution, We Should First
 Grasp Education
 In order to implement the new party constitution, we should conscientiously
 pay attention to educating our party members.  In the document concerning
 the strengthening of education among party members, a very comprehensive
 stipulation has been made on the requirements of educating party members
 in the party constitution.  The problem now is to satisfactorily carry out
 this stipulation.
 Our party has more than 39 million members who are organized into more than
 2 million basic party branches.  To carefully, vigorously and soundly
 organize party members to study and implement the new party constitution
 is a very arduous task.
 We all know that our ideological education and our work of education among
 the party members is still a weak sector.  In other words, we have a lot of
 outstanding work in this field.  It is precisely for this reason that we
 have to make great efforts to lay a foundation for satisfactorily doing
 this work.  Otherwise some party members will remain ignorant of the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 stipulations of the new party constitution a few months, or even 1/2 or 1
 year after the new party constitution came into force.  As a result the
 instances of violating the party constitution will frequently occur and
 even become a common practice.  This will actually aggravate some people's
 doubt about the possibility in carrying out the new party constitution.
 The joint investigation report on the situation in the education among
 party members in 19 provinces, municipalities and regions that was made by
 the organization and propaganda departments of the CPC Central Committee
 in June and July of this year has raised a question that calls for deep
 thought:  Why have our party members failed to play the same great role
 that they did at the initial period after the founding of the PRC, since
 the proportion of party members in the national population now is 1 to 25,
 which is 4 times the 1 to 100 proportion of that period?  In his report to
 the 12th party congress, Comrade Yaobang answered this question.  He said
 that this was because we have as yet failed to completely eliminate the
 pernicious influence of the 10 years of civil disorder, because under the
 new conditions the corrosive influence of the various kinds of ideology of
 the exploiting classes have aggravated the situation and because the prob-
 lem still exists of impurity in ideology, work style and organization in
 our party.  The document on strengthening education among party members
 points out that the actual reflection of this problem tells us that in order
 to create an overall new situation in our socialist modernization, we should
 first create a new situation in our party building and in educating our
 party members.
 In this article, we are going to recommend a good experience of satisfac-
 torily carrying out education among party members.  This is the experience
 of the Hunan Changling oil refinery in developing the education movement of
 "becoming qualified party members."  Through careful investigation, the
 party committee of this factory has learned of the problems among the ranks
 of party members there.  How should these problems be solved?  After
 repeated analysis, they found through repeated discussions an idea that
 made a breakthrough.  This idea is that they should put an end to the
 previous practice of paying attention only to the people at both ends and
 neglecting education among those people who are in the intermediate state,
 and instead, they should pay attention to educating those party members
 who are in the intermediate state and who form the majority of the party
 members.  They organized party members to study the documents about party
 building and systematically expound for them on the basic knowledge about
 the party.  Then every party member compared what he had studied with his
 own behavior and found what requirements he had satisfied and what require-
 ments he had failed to satisfy, and then fixed a goal for him to make
 further efforts to achieve.  During the process of study and comparison,
 the cadres of the party committee and branches engaged in heart-to-heart
 talks with the party members and consciously helped those whose work per-
 formance, work style and thoughts were in an intermediate state to catch up
 with the advanced.  Then they carried out the evaluation and comparison
 movement of "becoming qualified party members."  After this educational
 activity, 1,000 of the 1,100 party members who were in an intermediate
 state in the factory remarkably raised their level of awareness and 300 of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 them caught up with the advanced party members.  The change in the inter-
 mediate party members greatly shocked the originally backward party mem-
 bers.  The old "isolation of the advanced" has already been put to an end
 and the practice of "vying with one another to become advanced" has greatly
 developed.
 This factory has, furthermore, extended the movement of "becoming qualified
 party members" end turned it into an education movement of "becoming four
 qualified," that is, "becoming qualified cadres," "becoming qualified CYL
 members" and "becoming qualified workers."  The change in party work style
 has brought a change in the general mood in the factory and the erroneous
 idea of "looking for money in everything" has gradually lost its market.
 To be effective, education among the party members should be relevant and
 should be carried out in the manner of being particular about methods.
 There is still a great deal of the remnant influence of "leftism" in our
 methods of ideological and political work.  In one of his speeches,
 Comrade Yaobang pointed out that in exposing, criticizing and investigating,
 many localities still adopt the old methods of the "Great Cultural Revolu-
 tion."  Are there now any old fetters and conventions of old ideology in
 the methods of some of our people in considering problems, inspecting
 people and doing ideological work?  I think there are.  For example, some
 areas are still using the "leftist" methods of indiscriminately carrying
 out criticism in an unfair and exaggerated manner.  Of course, we must
 oppose the liberalist practice of keeping on good terms with everybody and
 maintaining peace at the expense of principle.  The combat effectiveness of
 ideological and political work lies in its relevance, but maintaining its
 relevance is aimed at effectively stirring up rather than injuring the
 initiative of our party members.  In carrying out education among party
 members in some localities, there has emerged a practice of calling some
 people party members of the "Great Cultural Revolution."  This depressed
 the comrades who joined the party during the "Great Cultural Revolution"
 and hurt their feelings.  The party members who joined our party during
 the "Great Cultural Revolution" constitute 40 percent of our party's total
 membership.
 Indeed, there are some of them who were abruptly admitted into the party,
 but we should not indiscriminately say that none of them is qualified or
 indiscriminately call every one of them a rebel.  There are indeed among
 them many good party members.  Of course, there are also some who have com-
 mitted mistakes, some even serious ones.  However, these mistakes were
 committed under the historical conditions at that time.  If only they are
 not the "three kinds of people," we should not hold them individually
 responsible for these mistakes.  These comrades should be helped and
 educated with meticulous care, both in the educational activities of study-
 ing the new party constitution now and in the party rectification next
 year.  Thus, we will make them feel the warmth of the party organizations'
 concern and become more close to the party organizations.  As for those
 who joined the party before the "Great Cultural Revolution," during the
 educational activities of studying the new party constitution, we should
 tell them that the longer one has been educated by the party, the better

 one should take the lead in implementing the new party constitution.  We
 should make them understand that "qualified party members" cannot always
 remain unchanged and that a qualified party member of the past may become
 an unqualified one under the new conditions if he fails to make efforts
 to study and implement the new party constitution.
 IV.  The Key to the Implementation of the New Party Constitution Lies in
 Cadres
 By treating cadres as the key to the implementation of the new party con-
 stitution, we mean that party cadres, especially leading cadres at all
 levels, must pay attention to and be good at educating party members.
 Moreover, they should set examples in taking the lead in implementing the
 new party constitution.
 Reflected in the sphere of party building, the tendency to neglect ideologi-
 cal and political work means neglecting education among party members.
 Seeing that the 12th congress documents stress ideological and political
 work, the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and the educa-
 tion among party members, some cadres have put forward the question of
 "policy and education, which is more powerful"?  What they mean is that
 since we have the policies of enlivening the economy at home and opening
 to the outside world and the various policies related to politics, culture,
 education and cadres, it is enough to rely on giving play to the force of
 these policies and there is no need to stress ideological and political work
 or education among party members.  This is, of course, an incorrect view.
 Indeed, correct policies are powerful.  However, the implementation of
 these policies depends on the ideological and political work publicizing
 and explaining these policies.  This is the first point.  The second is
 that ideological and political work shoulders an even more important task
 than publicizing the current policies.  This task is to train people to
 foster communist ideology.  Comrade Mao Zedong said that political work is
 the lifeline of all economic work.  The political work he meant here is
 ideological and political work that is also very powerful.  Both the view
 of regarding policies as being so powerful as to enable us to dispense with
 ideological and political work and that of regarding ideological and polit-
 ical work as being so powerful as to enable us to dispense with policies
 are one-sided views.  We suffered quite a lot in the past because of these
 two one-sided views.  Now we must be vigilantly on our guard against them.
 There has been yet another view that holds that ideological and political
 work is weak by nature and therefore we cannot rouse people to pay atten-
 tion to it in spite of our emphasis on it.  This, in fact, misunderstands
 ideological and political work.  Comrade Zhou Enlai once sharply criticized
 the practice of looking down upon ideological and political work.  He said:
 "It is never a fault of the political work itself that our political work
 becomes empty talk.  The blame lies in our political workers' failure to
 carry out genuine revolutionary political work."  ("Selected Works of Zhou
 Enlai," Vol 1, p 93)  This has made a point for us that our cadres should
 not only pay attention to ideological and political work and to the educa-
 tion among our party members, but should also learn to be good at doing this

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 work and do this work very effectively.  Have we not said that we should
 "strike a chord in people's hearts"?  When our ideological and political
 work and our education among party. members can strike a chord in people's
 hearts, this work and education can be regarded as highly effective.
 The report to the 12th party congress points out that the construction of
 socialist spiritual civilization relies on four contingents:  the contin-
 gents of ideological and political workers, cultural workers, scientific
 workers and educational workers.  The education among the party members
 relies mainly on the contingent of ideological and political workers.
 According to a rough calculation, this contingent consists of more than
 3 million people.  This is quite a large number, but the trouble is the
 insufficient political quality of this contingent.  The responsible comrade
 of the Heilongjiang Provincial CPC Committee has gone down to investigate
 the situation.  He has found that some party committee secretaries could
 speak quite a lot about the production, but could not give any clear idea
 about political work or education among party members.  He called these
 comrades "directors of factories in the true sense, but false secretaries."
 I think that this is a reasonable criticism.  Of course, a director of a
 factory should also do ideological and political work.  It will not do for
 a "director in its true sense" to fail to do ideological and political
 work.  It seems that some people have a few muddled ideas on the problem
 of being professionally competent.  Originally, our advocation of being
 professionally competent meant that our cadres should be experts in their
 jobs.  This means that those who take charge of management should be
 management experts, those who undertake horticulture should be expert
 horticulturists, those who engage in education should be education experts
 and those who do ideological and political work should be expert ideologi-
 cal and political workers.
 If a secretary of a party committee or a director of the propaganda or
 organization department does not understand the basic theory of Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, is not familiar with the history of the
 party, does not have basic knowledge about the party, does not know how
 to talk with the masses, give party lectures or do ideological and polit-
 ical work, he cannot be regarded as being professionally competent.  This
 should be included in future evaluation regulations.  We should gradually
 form an idea that ideological and political work and the work of education
 among party members is a type of science.  It is a science for running the
 party and the state.  The millions of cadres holding posts in this work
 should strive to become versed in this science, and thus a large number of
 them will become experts in doing ideological and political work and will
 be able to fulfill the task assigned them in the new period.
 The idea that the key to the implementation lies in cadres has another even
 more important implication, that is, our cadres must take the lead. in
 observing and implementing the new party constitution.  For a long time,
 some of our comrades had a kind of erroneous idea.  It seemed to them that
 the ideological and political work meant only how to educate the masses and
 it seldom struck them that this also meant that leading cadres must first of
 all receive education.  This had already been made very clear in Comrade
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Yaobang's article entitled "On the Problem Related to Ideological and Polit-
 ical Work."  We must correct this erroneous idea.  In the northeast, there
 is a county called Sunwu County where a loud cry for changing the party work
 style was raised for a long time.  But no substantial results were achieved.
 Later, the criticism of the masses made the comrades of the county CPC com-
 mittee see their errors.  The masses said that the committee spoke loudly
 about changing the party work style, but it was  anxious only in words and
 slack in deeds and it only blew the bugle but never began its march a step
 forward."  In accordance with the masses' criticism, the county CPC com-
 mittee fist rectified itself.  It sorted out and corrected one by one all
 the unhealthy practices of the leading group of the committee in the past
 few years, including using public funds to give banquets, embezzling public
 property and shifting the rural residence register of their relatives into
 nonrural residence registers.  The committee published all this, making the
 news available to the whole county.  The leadership disclosed without
 reserve to the masses all its unhealthy practices and how these practices
 were being corrected and requested the lower levels and the masses to
 supervise it.  This showed a Marxist's breadth of vision and was also the
 best method for education.  By doing this, the leadership, in fact, called
 on the lower levels and the masses as if saying "I have corrected my errors,
 now what are you going to do?"  However, this time the call was no longer
 given in vain because it was not a call criticized by the masses for being
 loud in words but slack in deeds.  This method is very effective.  Now in
 Sunwu County, a new situation in party work style and the general mood of
 the people has already emerged.
 Some comrades who have studied the ideological and political work have
 given the following viewpoint:  The argument that can teach people is half
 formed by words and half formed by deeds.  I think that this is a correct
 viewpoint and it conforms to the argument that those who educate others in
 Marxism must themselves receive education first.  If an educator acts in a
 way different from what he orally advocates, he criticizes the people from
 the platform, but is criticized by them behind his back, what right does he
 have to teach the others?  Here I should furthermore mention that the
 cadres whom we regarded as being the key to the implementation of the party
 constitution are not only the cadres in charge of ideological and political
 work, but are also all the cadres, especially the leading cadres of the
 party at all levels.  In July this year, the Shanghai Municipal CPC Com-
 mittee held a forum of fine party members.  At this forum, Comrade Ding
 Shie, a well-known Shanghai opera actress, presented a very moving idea.
 She said:  "First, I must treat myself as a party member and I should not
 treat myself as being an artist first," thus I will be able to overcome the
 tendency of treating myself as being special and becoming self-important.
 Here, she has put forth a very poignant question:  Should our party members
 who~are engaged in theoretical, educational, scientific and technical or
 literary and art work, or who hold leading posts, treat themselves first
 as being party members or first as being experts, well-known personages or
 leading cadres?  Indeed, this question is worth the deep consideration of
 some of our comrades.  In this activity of education in the new party con-
 stitution that is being carried out throughout our party, we should remind
 those comrades who do not observe the party constitution and disregard party

 discipline that the criteria for a "qualified party member" is the same
 for any party member and that our party welcomes those of its members who
 are brave to correct the mistakes they have committed, but will not allow
 any special party members, who cling to refusing to implement the party
 constitution, to remain in the organization of the pioneers of the prole-
 tariat.

 SAFEGUARD THE CONSTITUTION'S DIGNITY, ENSURE ITS ENFORCEMENT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 17-18, 33
 [Editorial]
 [Text)  Being deliberated and approved by the Fifth Session of the Fifth
 NPC, the Constitution of the PRC has been officially promulgated.  This is
 a great event in the Chinese people's political life.  This is another
 great achievement in the building of a high degree of socialist democracy
 and a high level of socialist civilization, with things being set to rights
 since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.  The new
 constitution has won the warm support of the people of all nationalities
 throughout the country.  Its enforcement will inevitably guarantee the
 further consolidation of the political situation in China, guarantee the
 development of socialist democracy and the improvement of the socialist
 legal system, and guarantee the smooth development of our socialist
 modernization.
 By carrying forward and developing the basic principles of the 1954 con-
 stitution and overcoming the drawbacks of the 1978 constitution, the new
 constitution has summed up the rich experiences of developing socialism
 in China over the past 30 years and more and has concentrated the will of
 the people of all nationalities.  Both the current situations and future
 prospects have been taken into account in the new constitution.  It is
 really a Chinese-style constitution that tallies with the needs of socialist
 modernization in the new historical period and it will remain unchanged for
 a long time to come.  The new constitution adheres to the socialist road,
 the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC and
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  It is formulated with the four basic
 principles as the general guideline.  It prescribes the general task in the
 new historical period and lays down principled stipulations on China's
 system of the people's democratic dictatorship, the socialist economic
 system, socialist spiritual civilization, the fundamental rights and duties
 of citizens, the state structure, the unifying of the nation and the unity
 of nationalities and the independent foreign policy.  For example, the
 restoration in the new constitution of the formulation that China is a
 socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship is not a simple
 restoration of the formulation and its contents in the 1954 constitution;
 instead, it accurately states the present condition of the classes in China

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 and the broad basis of our political power.  It truly reflects the fact
 that a socialist economic system has been established in our country and
 that it is growing ever stronger, affirms socialist public ownership of the
 means of production as the basis of our socialist economic system and the
 individual economy of the working people in urban and rural areas as a
 complement to the socialist public economy, and also stipulates that the
 planned economy should play a dominant role while the supplementary role
 of regulation by market mechanism should also be brought into play.  It
 restores the principle of the 1954 constitution that all citizens are equal
 before the law and stipulates citizens' fundamental freedoms and rights as
 well as their basic duties to the state and society.  All contents and
 stipulations in the new constitution reflect the achievements in the work
 of setting things to rights since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee, represent the fundamental interests of the people and
 embody the uniformity of the party's decisions and the people's will.
 Thus, they are in conformity with our country's conditions and people's
 wishes.  The new constitution is a good statute for administering our
 country in the new period.  It is the state's fundamental law, which has
 the highest legal authority, and functions as the foundation for general
 legislation.  Thus, its legal authority is higher than other laws.  As
 Comrade Ye Jianying pointed out in his speech at the closing meeting of
 the NPC session, the promulgation and enforcement of the new constitution
 will certainly push the building of our socialist democracy and legal sys-
 tem to a new phase and will certainly push our modernization construction
 to a new stage.
 It was through more than 2 years of work under the guidance of the party's
 correct line and through the nationwide discussion which pooled the wisdom
 of the masses that the new constitution was formulated in a time when our
 country was experiencing a great historical change.  The course of formu-
 lating the new constitution was in fact a course in which the people of all
 nationalities fully exercised their democratic rights.  Ours is a socialist
 state under the people's democratic dictatorship, led by the working class
 and based on the alliance of workers and peasants.  The workers, peasants
 'and intellectuals constitute the three basic social forces and are the
 masters of the country.  All power in our country belongs to the people.
 The organs through which the people exercise state power are the NPC and
 the local people's congresses at different levels.  The people administer
 state affairs and manage economic, cultural and social affairs through
 various channels and in various ways in accordance with the law.  The
 people not only have the right to participate in the discussion and formu-
 lation of the nation's fundamental law, but also have the right to super-
 vise its enforcement.  This is a fundamental sign of socialist democracy.
 Our socialist democracy is enjoyed by most people and is characterized by
 the people being the masters of the country.  Thus, it is a high degree of
 democracy.  The bourgeois democracy can never compare with it.
 Once being promulgated, the new constitution came into effect; it now has
 a universal binding force.  The new constitution stipulated:  "The people
 of all nationalities, all state organs, the armed forces, all political
 parties and public organizations and all enterprises and undertakings in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 the country must take the constitution as the basic norm of conduct, and
 they have the duty to uphold the dignity of the constitution and ensure
 its implementation."  This is to say, all political parties and organiza-
 tions, all departments and units, all groups and individuals should reso-
 lutely act in accordance with the constitution and no person is allowed to
 violate it.  The NPC and its Standing Committee have the function and power
 to supervise the enforcement of the constitution; local people`s congresses
 at all levels have also the function and power to guarantee that the con-
 stitution is abided by and implemented in their respective administrative
 areas.  It should be noted that there are now many favorable conditions for
 the enforcement of the new constitution.  Our party has successfully com-
 pleted its task of setting the guiding ideology to rights.  Developing
 socialist democracy and perfecting the socialist legal system are our
 party's unswerving principles.  After drawing a deep lesson from the 10
 years of domestic turmoil, the party and the people have all realized the
 great importance of the constitution and other laws in maintaining our
 nation's unity and stability and in the development of our cause.  Through
 the propaganda work and education in the socialist legal system in recent
 years, the vast number of cadres and masses have been strengthening their
 awareness of the legal system.  If all our 1 billion people have the idea
 and habit of abiding by and safeguarding the constitution, this will con-
 stitute a huge strength.  All kinds of obstructions will inevitably be
 overpowered by this strength.  We should have full confidence that the new
 constitution can be complied with and implemented well.
 To effectively guarantee the implementation of the new constitution, we
 must do a good job in three areas, namely, making it known to everybody,
 abiding by it and safeguarding it.  To make it known to everybody, we must
 do a great deal of propaganda and education work in a planned, methodical
 and systematic way so as to let the masses understand the constitution.
 Party committees at all levels should take the propaganda and education
 work in this field as a matter of importance.  In general, the people in
 our country, including cadres at all levels, are less aware of laws and
 legal knowledge.  This is particularly the case for the vast number of
 youths.  Now we should strengthen education in the legal system through
 the study and publicity of the new constitution.  Leading cadres should
 take the lead in the study and should personally explain the constitution
 to other cadres and the masses.  It is necessary, through all kinds of
 media and means of propaganda, to publicize the principled spirit and
 specific stipulations of the new constitution and to make them known to
 every household so that the new constitution can strike root in the hearts
 of the people.  Through propaganda and education, we should improve cadres'
 and the masses' sense of responsibility in being masters and strengthen
 their awareness of the socialist legal system so that cadres and the masses
 can all consciously comply with the new constitution and guide their actions
 with it, thus being citizens who have lofty ideals, moral integrity, educa-
 tion and a sense of discipline.
 Abiding by the constitution is the sacred duty of every citizen.  Party
 organizations, leading cadres and all party members must abide by the new
 constitution and be the models of implementing the new constitution.  A

 qualified party member or cadre must first be a qualified citizen or a
 model citizen.  Our party is the party in power.  It not only leads the
 people in formulating the constitution, but also leads the people in
 putting the constitution into effect.  Only when the party requires its
 organizations at all levels and all its. members, and particularly leading
 cadres, to set examples with their own conduct and play an exemplary role
 in complying with the new constitution can other social organizations and
 the masses be required to follow suit in complying with the new constitu-
 tion.  Cadres in our party and state, no matter in what positions they
 are situated, should never regard themselves as special citizens who need
 not confine their conduct within the limits of the constitution and laws,
 still less can they utilize their functions and powers to seek private
 interests for themselves or to gain profit for themselves by bending the
 law.  The whole party must follow the stipulation in the new party consti-
 tution that its activities must be carried out within the limits of the
 constitution and laws.  People's governments and judicial departments at all
 levels must act strictly according to law and ensure the enforcement of the
 new constitution.
 By safeguarding the constitution we mean that we must safeguard its dignity
 and dare to struggle against all illegal and criminal activities.  We
 should cultivate a prevailing custom that people always dare to protect
 good people and good things and dare to oppose evil people and evil things.
 We should create a strong public opinion that abiding by discipline and law
 is the most glorious thing while violating law and committing cximes is
 the most ignominious thing.  We should encourage the revolutionary spirit
 of not hesitating to dedicate one's life to safeguarding the dignity of the
 constitution.  All fronts should energetically commend and support good
 people and good deeds that consciously comply with the constitution, guard
 state secrets, cherish public property, abide by labor discipline and public
 order, respect social morality and resolutely struggle against evil people
 and evil things.  People who disregard law and discipline and sabotage the
 socialist legal system should be exposed and punished.  In particular, we
 must expose and crack down on the hostile forces that undermine the social-
 ist cause.  All actions in violation of the constitution and other laws
 must be dealt with according to state law.  No lawbreakers should be allowed
 to escape the net of justice.           '
 Every one of us must understand that the people are the masters of our coun-
 try and society and that the constitution is the fundamental norm for the
 people to exercise their duty as the masters.  According to the constitu-
 tion, no persons in our country can be free from being supervised by other
 people and no person can give up his duty of supervising others.  This
 represents both the right and the duty of being a master.  Every one of us
 should fully exercise this right and faithfully carry out this duty, being
 both a model in abiding by law and a brave fighter in defending law, so that
 we can certainly ensure the thorough implementation of the constitution.

 A PLAN TO LAUNCH THE NATIONAL ECONOMY ON A PATH OF HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT--ON
 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SIXTH 5-YEAR PLAN
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 19-24
 [Article by Fang Weizhong [2075 4850 0022]; passages within slantlines
 published in boldface]
 [Text]  The Sixth 5-Year Plan for China's economic and social development
 has been examined and approved by the Fifth Session of the Fifth NPC.  It
 is thus the second quite well-conceived 5-year plan following the First
 5-Year Plan, a plan which is fairly comprehensive in content and relatively
 appropriate in target terms.
 Since the carrying out of our economic construction in a planned way in
 1953, China has executed five 5-year plans altogether.  Except the First
 5-Year Plan which had a fairly comprehensive plan and was successfully ful-
 filled, the remaining four 5-year plans had merely suggested quotas or plan
 outlines and moreover, due to the impact of the "Great Leap Forward" move-
 ment or damage during the decade of domestic turmoil of the "Great Cultural
 Revolution," coupled with the influence of "leftist" thinking, some of the
 plans characterized by impetuosity and rashness and excessively high targets.
 failed to be smoothly implemented and even brought about serious setbacks
 to the development of the national economy.  The Sixth 5-Year Plan has
 appeared before the people with a brandnew look.  It is characterized not
 only by its comprehensive contents but still more by its unique style, that
 is, it has conscientiously summed up the positive and negative experience of
 the prolonged economic construction in the past, embodied the strategic plan
 for the economic development in the coming 20 years charted by the 12th
 party congress and the new principle for developing the national economy
 defined by the Fourth Session of the Fifth NPC and taken a new path of
 socialist modernization.
 The report on the Sixth 5-Year Plan delivered by Premier Zhao Ziyang at the
 Fifth Session of the Fifth NPC profoundly expounds the basic tasks of the
 Sixth 5-Year Plan, sums up the implementation of the Sixth 5-Year Plan in
 the first 2 years and formulates the key measures for the overall fulfill-
 ment of the Sixth 5-Year Plan.  This report indicates that the plan is a
 well-conceived and worthwhile one based on actual conditions under which
 production targets will be carried out in an orderly manner and step by step

 and that the measures adopted to fulfill this plan are geared to actual
 circumstances and are firm and effective.  This report substantiates and
 enriches some correct principles formulated in the past and significantly
 subjectivizes them, thus bringing the people of the whole country tre-
 mendous confidence and power to fulfill this plan.
 Such being the case, in what aspects do the characteristics of the Sixth
 5-Year Plan find expression?
 /First, decide the plan targets in accordance with the existing conditions
 rather than by wishful thinking./
 In the previous five 5-year plans, some targets were decided by wishful
 thinking, not in accordance with existing conditions.  The gross error of
 the "10-year program" formulated in 1978 was that the tasks of the plan were
 incorrectly defined.  Just when there were serious disproportions in the
 national economy and life was extremely difficult for the people due to
 damage during the decade of the "Great Cultural Revolution," readjusting
 the economy and allowing the people to rest and build strength should have
 been decided as the principal tasks of the plan but at that time, ignoring
 this basic situation and proceeding from wishful thinking, some people
 demanded that a new leap forward should be organized.  This resulted
 adversely in worsened imbalances in the economy and the aggravated diffi-
 culties in economic life, and alterations of the original plans had to be
 made.
 The reformulation of the Sixth 5-Year Plan started with a serious analysis
 of the economic situation.  The CPC Central Committee and the State Council
 have repeatedly pointed out that thanks to the endeavors to bring order out
 of chaos since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and
 the economic readjustment carried out in 1979, great achievements have been
 scored in various aspects.  However, longstanding accumulated problems can-
 not be completely solved in a brief space of time.  Since no fundamental
 turn for the better has been achieved in the state's financial and economic
 situation, the task of the Sixth 5-Year Plan is therefore to continue to
 implement the policy of readjustment, restructuring, reorganization and
 upgrading, make further efforts to seek solutions to the various problems
 left over from the past which hamper economic growth, win decisive victory
 in achieving a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and
 economic situation and lay a better foundation or create more favorable
 conditions for economic and social development in the Seventh 5-Year Plan.
 This formulation of basic tasks is entirely in conformity with the present
 economic conditions and with the objective law of economic development.
 By mentioning that the longstanding accumulated problems have not been com-
 pletely solved and no fundamental turn for the better has been achieved in
 the financial and economic situation, we mainly refer to the following
 facts:  No fundamental turn for the better has been achieved in the fairly
 irrational enterprise organizational structure and in the chaotic situation
 in operation and management; there exist a variety of problems in industrial
 structures and product mix; economic results are still very poor in such

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 fields as production, construction and circulation and the waste is quite
 amazing.  All this has resulted in the fact that under a situation in which
 the state has greatly increased its expenditure on the improvement of the
 well-being of the people, state financial revenue has increased slowly or
 even decreased due to poor economic results, which has made it hard to
 strike a balance between state financial revenue and expenditure.  There-
 fore, in order to achieve a fundamental turn for the better in the finan-
 cial and economic situation, that is, to achieve a balance between financial
 revenue and expenditure on condition of ensuring a gradual increase in the
 funds for economic and social development and a gradual improvement in the
 people's living standards, we must conscientiously carry out the overall
 reorganization of existing enterprises, gradually rationalize the industrial
 structure, the product mix and the enterprise organizational structure, and
 continue to reform the economic administrative system in an orderly manner
 so as to achieve a marked improvement in the economic results of such fields
 as production, construction and circulation.  All these tasks cannot be
 accomplished altogether during the Sixth 5-Year Plan period but various
 measures should be adopted to make some significant headway in these fields
 and to win a decisive victory in achieving a fundamental turn for the
 better in the financial and economic situation.  Practice has proved that
 doing a good job in the readjustment and reorganization of existing enter-
 prises and in the restructuring of the economic administrative system,
 eradicating the various malpractices existing in the economy, harmonizing
 proportionate relations and putting the relationships of the various
 quarters and sides concerned in proper order can yield good results and
 bring about high speed.  This is the best preparation we should make for
 the economic development during and after the Seventh 5-Year Plan period.
 If we do not concentrate our efforts on this matter and the features of
 operations and management remain unchanged, to accelerate the development
 of the economy is fundamentally out of the question.  On the contrary, the
 financial and economic difficulties will go further from bad to worse.
 Of course, to lay a sound foundation and create conditions for economic
 development during and after the Seventh 5-Year Plan period, a lot of work
 should be done in material conditions, science and technology and in the
 training of qualified personnel.  If we fail to pay close attention to the
 work in these fields, it will also be impossible to speed up the development
 of the economy.
 Continuing the implementation of the policy of readjustment, restructuring,
 reorganization and upgrading is a matter of overall importance which has a
 bearing on whether or not we can, in the 1980's, lay a sound foundation for
 the economic rejuvenation in the 1990's.  The Sixth 5-Year Plan, with the
 continued implementation of this policy as its basic task, has thus seized
 the principal contradiction and the main tasks.  In this matter we must
 preserve a high level of political consciousness and strictness and carry
 it out with great attention and in a down-to-earth manner.
 /Second, with the improvement  of economic results as the center, strive
 for a steady increase in the economy./

 The biggest disaster we suffered in the prolonged economic construction in
 the past was caused by the policy of concentrating on the growth rate of
 output and output value and on high targets at the expense of economic
 results.  We suffered in 1956; we suffered a great loss during 1958 and
 1960; and we again suffered quite a few disasters over a long period of
 time after 1970.  In order to realize unrealistic targets, we had to work
 out a high rate of development.  Excessively high targets would invariably
 give rise to all sorts of problems and result in more haste, less speed.
 They can seriously dampen the initiative of the masses of the people rather
 than arouse and protect the enthusiasm of the masses of the people for
 labor.
 In the course of drawing up the Sixth 5-Year Plan, the CPC Central Committee
 and the State Council advanced an important principle, that is, we should
 not seek high goals in economic affairs any longer, and pointed out that the
 growth rate for the Sixth 5-Year Plan should be a growth rate devoid of
 exaggeration but with staying power; an active growth rate which allows
 some leeway; and a growth rate which has as its prerequisite the attainment
 of better economic results rather than vice versa.
 The growth rate devoid of exaggeration we have mentioned here demands that
 targets should be practical and reliable, product quality should be up to
 standard, product varieties and designs should meet the needs of society,
 the consumption of materials per unit-product should be substantially
 reduced and that we must not indulge in exaggeration and not concentrate on
 speed at the expense of product quality, material consumption and product
 marketability.  Such practices are bound to lead to the emergence of the
 phenomenon whereby "in industry, good news ,is announced while in commerce,
 bad news;  in warehouses, there is overstocking while in finance, there are
 ~~
 only nominal increases  and must not strive for undeserved reputation, a
 practice which invites real harm.
 The so-called active plan which allows some leeway demands that the various
 departments and localities should make energetic efforts to tap potential,
 devote a lot of energy and effort to improving quality and reducing con-
 sumption, and increase production while practicing economy rather than
 accept the status quo and drift along.  Once a plan target is worked out,
 we must guarantee its fulfillment and strive to exceed it in its imple-
 mentation.  A growth rate devoid of exaggeration which allows some leeway
 means a growth rate with staying power.  So long as quality is really
 improved and consumption reduced, a benign cycle will take shape and a
 steady increase will be achieved in industrial production.
 The "Sixth 5-Year Plan" stipulates that industrial and agricultural produc-
 tion will increase at an average annual rate of 4 percent and that efforts
 should be made to bring the figure up to 5 percent in the course of carrying
 out the plan.  This is a good embodiment of the above-mentioned principle.
 It is a growth rate which lays emphasis on better economic results and
 strives for higher efficiency rather than a growth rate which blindly
 strives for increases in output and output value at the expense of economic
 results.  Considerable efforts will have to be made to attain this plan and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 a marked improvement in economic and technical targets is a must in this
 respect.  For example, during the Sixth 5-Year Plan the average annual
 growth rate of energy will be 1.4 percent and the growth rate of industry
 will be 4 or 5 percent.  This demands that the energy consumption rate in
 industry must reach 2.6 to 3.5 percent a year.  This plan gives full con-
 sideration to the various possibilities and can be attained so long as
 efforts are exerted.  The results of the carrying out of the 1980 and 1981
 plans surpassed their scheduled requirements.  This has proved that this
 plan is appropriate.
 The 12th party congress demands that the whole of economic work should be
 shifted to the path with the attainment of better economic results as its
 center.  To meet this demand is not an easy job and a lot of painstaking
 and meticulous work should be done in this respect.  However, we must act
 as required by the party Central Committee and first bring about a serious
 change in our guiding ideology and set strict demands on ourselves in our
 practical work.
 /Third, exercise strict control over the volume of total investment in
 fixed assets, concentrate funds, hasten the completion of key development
 projects and actively promote the technical transformation of existing
 enterprises./
 Historical experience has indicated that high targets invariably cause over-
 extension of the scale of our capital construction.  Blindly undertaking new
 construction stalls and going in for starting more new projects regardless
 of building costs and construction cycles is the most serious malpractice
 which has existed for a long time in our capital construction.  The several
 major setbacks which have occurred in our economic construction since the
 founding of the PRC are all closely related, economically, with the exten-
 sion of the scale of our capital construction.  Capital construction pro-
 jects sprang up all over the country in 1958 and we repeated this mistake
 by rushing without forethought into a lot of capital construction several
 times after 1970.
 Overextended and excessive capital construction and too many construction
 projects have brought about dire consequences in two aspects:  On the one
 hand, many construction projects were started in haste due to lack of
 proper prior preparations and all kinds of problems emerged in the process
 of construction; as a result, construction projects had to be carried out
 in an intermittent manner, with their designs being revised while construc-
 tion was under way.  Many production projects had to stop working awaiting
 the supply of raw materials from lack of material and equipment supply.  As
 a result, huge amounts of funds and materials were overstocked in the
 process of capital construction and failed to come into play as soon as
 possible.  On the other hand, many funds including the renewal and trans-
 formation funds of enterprises were diverted to capital construction.  As a
 result, the equipment of large numbers of enterprises failed to be updated
 and their technology failed to be transformed, their equipment became worn
 out and useless and labor productivity was decreasing day by day.  This
 state of affairs has brought about a vicious circle:  The more new
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 const~ruc~tion projects Mere undertaken, the more serious the damage to old
 construction projects would be.  The more often people failed to speed up
 the production of old enterprises, the more anxiously they wanted to extend
 the scale of production and in addition, the larger the scale of production,
 the poorer the returns from investment would be.  Cutting flesh to cure a
 boil can only make both sides suffer. .The overextension of the scale of
 capital construction caused disproportions in the national economy, inter-
 rupted the balances of the, national economy, interfered with the smooth
 progress of existing production and affected the commodity supply on the
 market.  While it was  roved hard to sustain any longer, some readjustments
 had to be carried out and large batches of projects had to be suspended or
 discontinued.  Capital construction has suffered grievous losses from this
 kind of large-scale construction and discontinuation.
 While drawing up the Sixth 5-Year Plan, the CPC Central Committee and the
 State Council have time and again stressed that we should not repeat this
 mistake and demanded that we should resolutely curtail the total volume of
 investment in capital construction so as to make it correspond with
 national capabilities and at the same time, the funds for the renewal and
 transformation of enterprises should be increased.  The total volume of
 investment in the whole fixed assets should be put under the unified
 management of the State Planning Commission, that is to say, we must
 ensure investment in key energy and transport projects on the one hand and
 in technical transformation of existing enterprises on the other and reso-
 lutely slash ill-considered projects launched so as to increase the
 capacity of the ordinary processing industries.  In light of this spirit
 and in accordance with the plan, the total investment in capital construc-
 tion throughout the country in the 5 years will be 230 billion yuan of which
 the state-budgeted investment will be 118.2 billion yuan, constituting 20
 percent of the total state expenditure.  This is very much lower than the
 35 percent in the "Fifth 5-Year Plan" period.  Altogether 890 large and
 medium-sized projects will be undertaken in these 5 years--far fewer than
 during the previous 5-year period.  Funds earmarked for updating equipment
 in the existing enterprises and for their technical transformation are more
 than during the previous 5-year period, amounting to 130 billion yuan in
 the 5 years and averaging 26 billion yuan a year.  The proportion of such
 funds in the total investment in fixed assets is increased from the previous
 about 20 percent to 36 percent in the Sixth 5-Year Plan.
 Of the total volume of investment in capital construction in the 5 years,
 the investment in energy and transport projects will be 88.4 billion yuan,
 accounting for 38.5 percent.  With theincreased investment in these
 aspects, the capacity of construction of coal, electricity, petroleum,
 railway and water transport will also increase.  For example, the total
 production capacity of China's coal industry in the 5 years will be 220
 million tons and in addition to a production capacity of 80 million tons
 to be made available before the end of 1985,. the production capacity
 to be carried forward into the Seventh 5-Year Plan will be 140 million
 tons.  This figure is almost 70 percent higher than the production capacity
 of 83 million tons which was achieved by the end of 1980 to be carried for-
 ward into the Sixth 5-Year Plan.  The total 'electric power in the 5 years
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 will be 36.6 million kw.  Of this figure, 12.9 million kw will be available
 before the end of 1985, while work on the remaining 23.7 million kw will
 continue in the "Seventh 5-Year Plan" period.  This figure is bigger than
 the electric power capacity of 184 million kw which was closed in the end
 of 1980 and to be continued in the "Sixth 5-Year Plan."  The exploration of
 oil in the western regions of the country and the exploration of offshore
 oil will be speeded up.  In communications and transport, on the one hand,
 the technical transformation of some of the present railways must be accel-
 erated aid on the other, several new major trunk railways for transporting
 coal and additional deepwater berths of coastal harbors will be constructed.
 Completion of these tasks will provide the development of the national
 economy with better energy and transport conditions.
 Seen from China's financial and material resources, the total volume of
 investment of the "Sixth 5-Year Plan" is by no means small, and in particu-
 lar quite a few medium and large-sized projects have been scheduled.  Put-
 ting these investments to effective control and use can play a great role.
 We must learn from the lessons in the past, concentrate strength on doing
 a good job in the construction of the projects within the plan, strive to
 shorten production cycle, cut down building costs and thoroughly put an end
 to the phenomenon in the past whereby construction was undertaken in so
 blind and unplanned way that "making an investment became a bottomless pit
 and construction projects were carried out in a marathon manner."
 Renewal and transformation funds must also be put to effective control and
 use and be really used in updating old equipment and adopting new tech-
 nologies and new techniques rather than using. them in expanding the produc-
 tion capacity of ordinary industries with old techniques.  In order to
 enhance the existing enterprises' capacity to renovate and transform, the
 State Council has decided that in light of the possibilities of the state
 financial strength, the depreciation rate of the equipment of enterprises
 should be steadily increased.
 Whether or not the scale of investment in fixed assets during the "Sixth
 5-Year Plan" period can be brought to a rational level and whether or not
 key development projects and major technical transformation can be ensured
 as required have a bearing on the success and failure of the "Sixth 5-Year
 Plan" and on whether or not the national economy can increase in a
 sustained way on the basis of steady growth.  Therefore, we must pay strict
 attention to management in this aspect and not slacken our vigilance or
 treat it casually.  Once the situation is improving, on no account must we
 "have a relapse."
 /Fourth, put science and technology and the training of qualified personnel
 in an important strategic position./
 In the previous several 5-year plans, no proper importance was ever attached
 to the development of science and technology and the training of qualified
 personnel.  The expansion of production depended mainly on extending the
 scale of production and on undertaking capital construction rather than
 depending mainly on technological advance; work in science and technology
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 was not sufficiently combined with economic construction.  Educational
 undertakings made slow progress and the level of the education the people
 have received and of science and technology and culture was remarkably low.
 This resulted in a situation in which the level of our production tech-
 niques had been in a stalemate for a long time and our work in many aspects
 still remained at the levels of the 1950's.
 In the course of drawing up the Sixth 5-Year Plan, the CPC Central Com-
 mittee and the State Council demanded that science and technology and the
 training of qualified personnel should be placed in a strategic position.
 The modernization of science and technology is a key link in our four
 modernizations.  If we do not lay stress on the study of science and tech-
 nology or promote technological progress, we cannot possibly realize the
 task of quadrupling the annual gross value of industrial and agricultural
 production by the turn of this century or narrow the gap in science and
 technology between ourselves and the economically developed countries.
 Moreover, the development of science and technology depends, in the final
 analysis, on training qualified personnel and on fully organizing the
 present scientific and technical force and bringing their initiative into
 full play.  Therefore, particular importance should be attached to educa-
 tional work and to the training and rational use of qualified personnel.
 The Sixth 5-Year Plan has begun to pay attention to putting the development
 of science and technology and education in an important position.  The
 funds scheduled by the plan for developing education, science and tech-
 nology, culture and public services will be 96.7 billion yuan, an increase
 of 68 percent over the 57.7 billion yuan appropriated in the Fifth 5-Year
 Plan.  The total state expenditure during this period will be only 17 per-
 cent more than that during the "Fifth 5-Year Plan."  The proportion of
 these funds in total state expenditure will increase from 11 percent during
 the "Fifth 5-Year Plan" period to 15.9 percent.  A large portion of the
 increased financial revenue during the Sixth 5-Year Plan period will be
 appropriated for education and scientific research.  Because the problems
 left over from the past are many, the funds allocated for these undertakings
 now are admittedly insufficient, but appropriations for these undertakings
 will gradually increase along with the future growth of our economy.
 In science and technology, the present scientific and technical force
 should, under the Sixth 5-Year Plan, be rallied to take part in all plan-
 ning work, in tackling key problems in the major theoretical problems
 raised in the course of the modernization program and in the techno-
 economic deliberations and prospecting and designing of major construction
 projects.  We must create a situation in these aspects and strive for use-
 ful achievements.  Along with this, we must, in light of the technical
 transformation of enterprises, introduce from abroad a large batch of
 advanced production techniques and key equipment in a planned way and
 enthusiastically do a good job of digestion and assimilation work.
 While energetically expanding research in the natural sciences, we should
 also attach importance to studies in the social sciences.  We should do our
 best to expound and solve the major theoretical and practical problems
 raised in the course of our socialist modernization.
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 In the training of qualified personnel, it is scheduled according to the
 plan that on the premise of improving quality, we should develop higher
 education and increase the number of newly admitted full-time students in
 institutions of higher education, continue to restructure secondary educa-
 tion and set up more new secondary vocational schools of different types.
 We should strive to make primary school education universal or almost
 universal by 1985 in most counties and to make junior middle school
 education universal in the cities and vigorously eliminate illiteracy
 among young and middle-aged people.
 In order to raise the ideological and political level and the level of
 modern science and technology and production skills of the broad masses of
 cadres, technical personnel and workers, we will widely run various kinds
 of regular universities and colleges, regular schools and training courses
 in rotation so as to put the education of staff and workers on a regular
 basis in a relatively short time.
 Putting science and technology and the training of qualified personnel in
 an important strategic position is a remarkable change in the state's
 guiding ideology in economic construction.  We must realize the great
 significance of such a change and make energetic efforts to adapt our-
 selves to such a change, achieve genuine unity in thinking and put it
 into practice in real earnest.
 /Fifth, combine development of the national economy with social develop-
 ment and pay attention to both the building of material civilization and
 that of spiritual civilization./
 Our plan in the past was mainly a development plan of the national economy.
 Although it contained the content of social development, the latter was
 quite incomplete and furthermore the content of the building of socialist
 spiritual civilization was insignificant.  One important reason for this
 state of affairs is that there existed a serious one-sidedness in our
 guiding thinking; that is, we excessively chased the rate of increase of
 production and construction at the expense of the improvement of the well-
 being of the people and the solution to social problems; we attached great
 importance to the planning of material production to the neglect of the
 planning of the production of man and the rational use of manpower; and we
 devoted much attention to the building of material civilization but under-
 estimated the importance of the building of spiritual civilization and more
 and more social problems piled up as a result.
 In the course of drawing up the Sixth 5-Year Plan, the CPC Central Com-
 mittee and the State Council instructed that we should bring social develop-
 ment into line with the plan, correct the erroneous idea of underrating
 the importance of cultural development and ideological education and give
 consideration to creating fine standards of social conduct.  Economic
 growth is indispensable to social development.  Otherwise, it will become
 aimless and lose its social guarantee.  Material civilization provides an
 indispensable foundation for socialist spiritual civilization which, in its
 turn, gives a tremendous impetus to the former and ensures its correct

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 orientation.  In all economic work, we must not only give consideration to
 the expansion of production but also to the building of socialist spiritual
 civilization, and to the bringing up of generation after generation of
 socialist new people.  With the establishment of the socialist system, we
 already have the possibility to and still must develop social production
 in a planned way and at the same time, promote social development and
 build spiritual civilization in a planned way.  The Sixth 5-Year Plan has
 changed the tendency of not attaching importance to social development
 planning.  phis is a great change and a big step forward.
 The part on social development in the Sixth 5-Year Plan includes plans for
 population, labor employment, the income and consumption of the residents
 in urban and rural areas, urban and rural construction and social welfare
 undertakings, cultural undertakings, public health and physical culture,
 environmental protection and preserving good public order.  At the same
 time, it demands that in the various economic construction undertakings,
 we should strengthen ideological education so that more and more staff and
 workers will become working people with lofty ideals, moral integrity,
 education and a sense of discipline, overcome all sorts of unhealthy prac-
 tices, strike resolute blows at the serious criminal activities in the
 economic and other spheres and at other serious criminal activities and
 create a general improvement in public order and order in production and
 other work for the realization of the Sixth 5-Year Plan.
 From the above-mentioned contents we can see that the Sixth 5-Year Plan
 is a 5-year plan which continues the implementation of the policy of
 readjustment, restructuring, reorganization and upgrading and launches the
 national economy on a path of healthy development and a 5-year plan which
 takes a new path of socialist modernization in light of China's existing
 conditions.  This is the result of bringing order out of chaos since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and the crystalliza-
 tion of implementing the party's practical and realistic line.  Earnest
 implementation of this 5-year plan will significantly raise the level of
 the whole of economic work, help the national economy steadily grow in the
 course of readjustment, help the modernization program move forward a step
 further and help continue to improve the people's livelihood.  Provided we
 successfully fulfill the Sixth 5-Year Plan, we can be certain that the
 growth rate for the Seventh 5-Year Plan will be higher than that of the
 Sixth 5-Year Plan.  Proceeding from this basis, the growth rate for the
 eighth and ninth 5-year periods is certain to be still higher.  In this
 way, we will have the possibility of realizing the magnificent objective
 of quadrupling the annual gross value of industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction by the end of this century.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, significant
 improvements have been achieved in China's planning work.  The formulation
 of the Sixth 5-Year Plan has made a degree of progress in many aspects com-
 pared with the previous ones.  However, this is only a beginning.  Owing to
 the .complexity of economic life and the restriction of the level of planning
 work, though earnest efforts have been made ,to conduct investigation and
 study and to achieve an overall balance in preparing the plan, there may be
 points needing further deliberation, which will be readjusted as required
 and handled properly in accordance with concrete conditions in the course
 of its implementation.

 COMRADE SUN YEFANG'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMIC THEORIES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 25-30
 [Article by He Jianzhang [0149 1696 4545] and Zhang Zhuoyuan [1728 0587

 [Text]  Comrade Sun Yefang is a famous economist in our country.  In his
 theoretical research activities over the past decades and particularly in
 the past 30 years, he based himself on Marxist basic theory and put forth
 major questions according to the practice of our socialist construction.
 He conducted deepgoing and intensive studies, boldly created new things,
 dared to argue, continually challenged erroneous traditional concepts, and
 put forward a complete system of socialist economic theory embodying his
 original views.  Particularly noteworthy is that, based on the results of
 his own scientific research, he has put forward a whole series of bold and
 richly enlightening suggestions and ideas on the reform of China's finan-
 cial and economic management systems and on the major problems encountered
 in the practice of China's socialist construction.  Recently, although
 gravely ill, he has remained greatly concerned for socialist construction,
 and wrote an excellent article entitled "There Is a Technical and Economic
 Guarantee as Well as a Political Guarantee for Quadrupling in 20 Years,"
 which dealt with the idea that it is necessary to rely mainly on technical
 transformation in order to quadruple total industrial and agricultural
 output value and consequently he was praised by leading comrades from the
 CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
 The theoretical activities of Comrade Sun Yefang have created a good exam-
 ple for the broad masses of theoretical workers in overcoming difficulties
 and in daring to climb the peak of science.  His socialist economic theory
 is characterized by giving prominence to economic efficiency and it is
 based on the law of saving time or the law of value as it is termed by him.
 This theory is opposed to the theory of natural economy and the theory of
 will but on the other hand it pays very much attention to the important
 significance of technical progress in developing social production, stresses
 the importance of the broad masses as masters of their land and advocates
 that enterprises should play their roles as independent economic accounting
 units.  He began by studying the double nature of products and daringly
 probed into the question of reforming socialist political economic system
 from the simple to the complex aspects through analyzing the process of

 direct production, the process of circulation and the whole process of
 social production.  The following is a brief introduction to the important
 significance of his economic theoretical views in the implementation of
 socialist modernization program in our country today.
 I.  Gaining the Greatest Results From the Least Spending Is the Supreme
 Principle in Socialist Economic Activities
 In early 1960, the sphere of economics was generally subject to the influ-
 ence of "leftist" ideology.  Textbooks of political economy stressed the
 importance of class struggle with political slogans replacing economic
 analyses.  At the same time, in actual economic life, economic law was
 replaced by objective will, coupled with making rash advances blindly and
 giving no consideration to economic efficiency, and all these resulted in
 serious losses and waste.  But Comrade Sun Yefang rose against the tide and
 put forth his famous concept that the supreme principle in socialist
 economic activities is to gain the greatest results from the least spend-
 ing.  The Economic Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
 which was then under his management, followed the directives from the CPC
 Central Committee and organized all research personnel to compile the
 book "On Socialist Economy."  Disregarding opposition from some people, he
 insisted that the book must give prominence to the importance of seeking
 economic efficiency.  He said that the textbooks of political economics
 must pay attention to economy.  What is economy?  The answer is to gain the
 greatest achievements with the least spending.  We must prove through
 analyzing the relationship of socialist production that the relation of
 socialist production is in a better position than capiromote thegdevelopment
 achievements with least spending and consequently to p
 of the social economy.
 Comrade Sun Yefang time and again stressed that political economics must
 have a value economic category.  He sharply criticized a wrong view that
 "'spare no expense' seems to represent boldness of spirit in carrying out
 socialist construction.   According to his view, under the socialist system,
 value decision still plays a governing role in the distribution among
 various forms of production whether in the readjustment of labor time or in
 social labor.  He stressed that it is necessary in a socialist economy to
 respect the role of the law of value so as to enable the "backward, medium
 and advanced enterprises constantly to engage in competition for the purpose
 of decreasing the average labor needed by society" and he said that this~~is
 a socialist "broad road for developing production and social prosperity.
 But this demand of seeking economic efficiency in all economic activities
 and the theory of respecting the law of value were termed as being in
 opposition to putting proletarian politics in command and denying class
 struggle.  During the "Great Cultural Revolution," this concept was even
 labeled as "counterrevolutionary revisionism."  Since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the CPC Central Committee has
 spared no efforts in eradicating "leftist" mistakes both in theory and
 practice.  It demanded that we must take a new road for developing the
 national economy and the core of this task is to seek economic efficiency

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 in all economic activities.  Practice has proved that Comrade Sun Yefang's
 view of taking economic efficiency as the supreme principle in socialist
 economic activities is totally correct.
 II.  Attaching Very Great Importance to Economizing and Making Rational Use
 of Socialist Capital
 It is an actual problem that we lack capital for our socialist moderniza-
 tion program.  Therefore the question of economizing and making rational
 use of limited capital are closely related to the question of whether our
 construction can be carried out smoothly.  As early as the 1950's, Comrade
 Sun Yefang was aware of the importance of economizing and making rational
 use of construction funds.  He proved this view theoretically and put forth
 some practical suggestions.
 In order to check the results in using the capital, he advocated the use of
 capital profit rate as a comprehensive norm for checking the results of
 business and management of enterprises and production costs, and the basis
 for defining prices of products.  This view was put forth during the debate
 around 1956 on the question of whether the price of heavy industrial
 products should be decreased or not.  He was opposed to a decrease in the
 price of heavy industrial products on the grounds that although the profit
 rate of such products was relatively high, the capital profit rate was low.
 He said: We made tremendous investments in our heavy industrial enterprises
 with the capital accumulated by the broad masses of workers and peasants
 throughout the country through their blood and sweat; why cannot these
 enterprises make profit?  To judge the price of products through capital
 profit rate means that it is imperative to economize and rationally use
 socialist capital, pay attention to the efficiency of using the capital
 and to check capital profit rate.
 It was once a commonly held wrong view to mix the profit of socialist
 enterprises with that of capitalist enterprises and oppose paying atten-
 tion to socialist profit and checking capital profit rate; it was under
 such conditions that in 1963 Comrade Sun Yefang wrote a research report
 entitled "The Profit Norm of the Socialist Planned Economic Management
 System."  In this report he advocated that it was imperative, according
 to state planning, to "define the orientation of production and the rela-
 tions of coordination, strictly implement supply-production-sales contracts
 and observe planned prices while the amount of profit represents a compre-
 hensive norm to show the standard of an enterprise's technical level and
 its business management level.  The social average capital profit rate is
 a level that has to be reached by each enterprise; those that have exceeded
 this rate are advanced enterprises and those that are lagging behind this
 rate are backward enterprises."
 During the "Great Cultural Revolution," these views of Comrade Sun Yefang
 were labeled by Kang Sheng, Chen Boda and the "gang of four" as "putting
 profit in command" and criticized.  But he did not make a self-criticism.
 Following the downfall of the "gang of four," he wrote the first important
 thesis under the title of "Boldly Grasp Socialist Profit."  According to his

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 view, each socialist enterprise must persist in socialist orientation and
 under the premise of implementing party principles and policies, create
 more profits through technical reform and improvement of management.  He
 has always advocated that the enterprises with more state capital should
 have the obligation to hand over more profits to the state.  One of the
 important parts of the current reform of the economic management system in
 our country is to gradually get rid of the capital supply system and change
 possession of capital without reward to the one with reward; in defining
 the prices of various categories of products, it is necessary to consider
 the funds possessed by these products; encourage enterprises to make more
 profit for the state and enable them to combine the results of their busi-
 ness, including the amount of profit, with their own economic interest.
 All these views of Comrade Sun Yefang are of practical significance for us
 today in reforming the economic management system.
 III.  Actively Advocating the Reform of the Economic Management System
 As early as 1956, Comrade Sun Yefang began to write articles in which he
 advocated the correct handling of the relationship between the planned
 economy and the law of value, and the reform of the socialist economic
 management system.  In June 1961, he wrote a research report to the CPC
 Central Committee for internal reference in which he suggested the posi-
 tion of the system in socialist political economics and pointed out the
 necessity theoretically of reforming the current economic system and a
 series of the measures for carrying out the reform.
 Comrade Sun Yefang pointed out:  The core central issue of the financial
 system is the autonomy of enterprises, their responsibilities and their
 relations with the state, and all these mean the management autonomy of the
 enterprises.  According to his view, it is not difficult to solve other
 problems in the system such as the relations between the central and local
 governments and the relations between rules and regulations and depart-
 ments once the autonomy of enterprises is resolved.  Following the tortuous
 path traversed over the past 20 years, we eventually began reforming the
 economic management system of our country .by starting from expanding the
 autonomy of enterprises and up to today we have made considerable achieve-
 ments in this aspect through practice.  When we recall the above-mentioned
 views expressed by Comrade Sun Yefang in his research report at that time,
 we can see even more clearly the value of his views.
 Comrade Sun Yefang held that under a socialist system, enterprises must
 become independent accounting units.  Of course, enterprises with the
 ownership by the whole people only have the right to possess, use and con-
 trol state finance and the state is the owner of this finance.  Therefore
 the independence of socialist enterprises is relative.  But since enter-
 prises are independent accounting units, it is within the rights of the
 enterprises to sign contracts on supply and sales among themselves, and
 to discuss the volume of supply and sales and the specifications of
 products according to the original production orientation and within the
 original sphere, and the state and localities have no right to interfere
 with this.  Some people worried that with their autonomy expanded, the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 enterprises would be bent solely on profits.  But Comrade Sun Yefang argued
 and pointed out that when enterprises are able to improve their management
 and constantly improve their technology, individual labor consumption will
 be lower than the average necessary labor volume and such benefit is gained
 mainly through the objective effort of the staff and workers of the enter-
 prises.  Therefore we cannot limit such benefit.  On the contrary we must
 encourage it because it is in the interest of improving labor productivity
 and developing social production.
 Comrade Sun Yefang has also defined the theory and the limit of the
 autonomy of enterprises.  Enterprises have "small autonomy" over the
 management of the capital value of simple reproduction.  The state, on the
 other hand, has "big autonomy" over the capital value of the expansion of
 reproduction such as investment on new enterprises and the expansion of
 old enterprises and all these must be put under strict control by the state.'
 If the state includes those matters that should be managed by enterprises
 under its control, then the control over enterprises will become too rigid;
 as a result, the state itself will be busily engaged in routine work and
 it will relax its control over major plans of state long-range construction
 and comprehensive balance work of the national economy.  Contrarily, if
 the right over the amount of capital value of the expansion of reproduction
 is totally handed down to enterprises, it will easily give rise to dupli-
 cated construction and production and spoil the balanced development of the
 national economy.
 To enable the hundreds of thousands of enterprises to display their initia-
 tive and creativity, Comrade Sun Yefang made a series of proposals for
 reforming the systems of planning, finance, goods and materials and price.
 IV.  Holding That Doing a Good Job in Circulation Is an Essential Condition
 for Developing Socialist Socialized Mass Production
 Comrade Sun Yefang is the first economist in our country that has been
 opposed to regarding socialist economy as natural economy.  Over the past
 decades, there existed a wrong view in economic theory and economic practice
 in our country that regarded the socialist economy as having no process of
 circulation.  In fact, such a "theory of no circulation" advocated the
 management of the socialist economy with the methods used in managing a
 self-sufficient economy, a method characterized by a system of rationing
 of goods and blockading regions from each other.  Such a theory seriously
 hinders the development of production socialization and the development of
 the production and exchange of socialist commodities.  Comrade Sun Yefang
 pointed out that such a theory confuses the functions of exchange and
 distribution and attempts to replace exchange with distribution.  In fact,
 without exchange and distribution, there would be no way to develop
 socialized mass production.  At the same time, the "theory of no circula-
 tion" confuses the division of technical work within enterprises with social
 division of work, improperly regards the economy with the ownership by the
 whole people as a big factory and in this factory in which there exist only
 division of technical work among various workshops and sections and not
 social division of work.  In fact, the socialist economy with the ownership

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 by the whole people is composed of hundreds of thousands of enterprises
 with independent accounting and among these enterprises there exists social
 division of work.  If enterprises do not carry out exchange of commodities
 among themselves, it would not be possible for the whole society to carry
 out reproduction smoothly.
 In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Comrade Sun Yefang pointed out that
 Volume 1 of "Das Kapital" has more contents than the other two volumes
 suitable fob us today in organizing and managing the socialist economy.
 It is only recently that this View has been accepted by more comrades and
 this situation has been proven by the fact that since last year, the broad
 masses of cadres who are responsible for economic work and theoretical
 workers have in general begun to study Marxist theory of reproduction.
 Comrade Sun Yefang has always opposed the system of rationing and advocated
 that the circulation of the means of production be included in commerce so
 that production can be directly linked with sales.  According to his view,
 it is not necessary for state planning bodies and economic management
 organizations to directly control supplies and sales that should be
 resolved by the hundreds of thousands of the relatively independent enter-
 prises directly through contracts.  The state must control only how to bal-
 ance the difference.  He also held that it is unnecessary to redistribute
 goods every year.  Is it necessary for a husband and wife to hold a wedding
 ceremony every year?  The state work of achieving overall balance must be
 based on contracts for production, supply and sales made by grassroots
 enterprises and must be carried out from bottom to top.
 According to Comrade Sun Yefang's view, the socialist economy is termed a
 planned economy because following the introduction of public ownership, the
 production within each enterprise is carried out in a planned way while the
 production-supply-sales relations among various enterprises, that is the
 process of circulation and marketing, are organized in a planned and uni-
 fied way.  Comrade Sun Yefang particularly agreed with the following view
 of Comrade Liu Shaoqi:  Circulation is the most sensitive; all the various
 problems in production are reflected in circulation and therefore in carry-
 ing out the study of economics it is imperative to pay attention to circu-
 lation.
 At present, a number of problems have cropped up in the activities of the
 national economy because we did not organize circulation well.  There are
 unsalable products and stockpiling of goods because production is carried
 out without directly linking it with sales while some other products are
 also unsalable because of regional blockades; some enterprises have failed
 to meet demand or have suspended production due to lack of materials, and
 the service of exclusive business of certain units has also dropped.  All
 these things show that it is an urgent and very important task to solve
 the problem of socialist circulation by combining theory with practice.

 V.  Attaching Importance to Technical Progress and the Technical Reform of
 the Existing Enterprises
 Comrade Sun Yefang always advocated the study of the relations of produc-
 tion by relating them to productivity and he was against carrying out the
 study without connecting it with productivity.  He paid very much atten-
 tion to the role displayed by technical progress in promoting production
 and its great influence in social economic relations.  He held that under
 the socialist system, thepe also exist invisible losses and he resolutely
 opposed the management method over equipment that is characterized by
 freezing technical progress and "duplicating antiques."  He said that
 enterprises must mainly depend on constantly improving technology in
 increasing economic efficiency, labor productivity and profits.
 Comrade Sun Yefang pointed out that in developing both industry and agri-
 culture, it is necessary to rely on both planning and scientific technology.
 The task put forth by the 12th party congress to quadruple the annual gross
 industrial and agricultural output value by the end of this century and
 particularly the task of industrial departments to more than quadruple
 their annual gross output value must mainly be grasped through the techni-
 cal reform of the more than 400,000 existing enterprises.  In developing
 production, we can no longer follow the old road of resorting to capital
 construction and building new enterprises, nor can we expand productivity
 on the basis of the original equipment, technology, raw materials and
 products.  While the number of newly built enterprises is very limited,
 existing enterprises are very great in number.  If, in developing produc-
 tion in the future, we are able to rely not only on the very limited new
 enterprises but also mainly on technical reform of the majority of the
 existing enterprises, we will consequently be able to develop production
 even faster and with higher economic efficiency and unified speed and
 efficiency.  In the past decades, industry in the Soviet Union developed
 slowly and so did our industry in the past 30 years and consequently there
 appeared a wrong feeling that industry had "big basic figures and slow
 speed."  In fact, the important reason for this situation is that the
 related economic management system hindered the technical reform of the
 existing enterprises and the transformation of the enterprises themselves.
 As a result, the majority of the old enterprises have failed to develop
 production and by solely relying on some newly built enterprises it is only
 natural that production is developing more and more slowly.
 In order to enable the hundreds of thousands of existing enterprises to
 carry out technical reform in a planned way and step by step, Comrade Sun
 Yefang suggested increasing the depreciation rate of fixed assets.  He
 suggested that in the First step, the depreciation rate may be increased
 from about 4 percent to about 10 percent and depreciation funds may be
 handed down to enterprises for renewing their equipment.  He also suggested
 that measures must be taken through economic management so that enterprises
 will have both motive force and pressure to carry out technical reform.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Comrade Sun Yefang has his own original system of socialist economic theory
 and his own incisive ideas on socialist construction because he persistently
 links theory with reality, engages in bold probing and dares to uphold the
 truth.
 He paid very much attention to the study of Marxist theory.  In the mid-
 1920's, he studied Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet Union, and later was
 responsible for interpreting courses on political economics with his rich
 theoretical experiences.  In the 1940's, he was working with the party
 school in central China and he found that within the party there existed a
 tendency of empiricism to neglect theoretical study.  He wrote a letter to
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi in which he stressed the significance of theoretical
 study in guiding the Chinese revolution to victory.  This view was fully
 affirmed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi.  Following liberation, he was posted in
 leading positions in professional departments and research departments and
 in these departments he time and again stressed that theoretical study was
 perfecting "basic skills."  He also attached great importance to studying
 and investigating economic life and from these activities he made theoreti-
 cal summaries to direct practice.  In the early 1930's, he used Marxism as
 guidance to study and investigate the economy in China and particularly the
 rural economy.  Thanks to his deep investigations, he was able to correctly
 analyze the nature of the society in China, refute the fallacies of Trotsky-
 ist faction and popularize the party principles and policies about demo-
 cratic revolution.  The above-mentioned views and suggestions were made
 possible after he grasped numerous reference materials from reality.  He
 suggested that research departments must establish contact with professional
 departments and demanded that the Economic iesearch Institute of the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences be put under the leadership of both the CPC
 Central Committee and the State Planning Commission.  In this aspect, he
 was supported by Comrades Zhou Enlai and Li Fuchun.  He actively suggested
 research units to build "experimental fields" in factories, shops and rural
 areas.  He led a number of research personnel to stay in selected factories
 to help improve their work and gain firsthand experience for guiding overall
 work.  He has also consequently written a number of research reports with
 rich contents and particular views.  In short, Comrade Sun Yefang has been
 able to fully demonstrate the party's fine style of study characterized by
 linking theory with practice.
 Another outstanding character of Comrade Sun Yefang is that he has the
 courage to uphold the truth and conduct criticism and self-criticism.
 During the revolutionary war, Comrade Sun Yefang heroically fought against
 the enemy no matter whether in his secret fight when he was carrying out
 risky underground work or in the battlefield.  When he was responsible for
 economic theoretical work following. liberation, he also boldly opposed
 traditional wrong concepts.  His motto is a sentence from a poem by Dante
 once quoted by Marx:  "As at the entrance to hell, at the entrance to
 science we must make this demand:  'Here, all hesitation must be eradicated
 and here any cowardice is helpless."'  In the early 1960's, he was labeled
 by Kang Sheng and Chen Boda as "the biggest revisionist in China"; he was
 criticized and dismissed from office.  But Comrade Sun Yefang declared:  "I
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 long ago realized the nature of this question and the argument that might
 occur.  But it is very risky to try and solve this case that has been pend-
 ing for decades."  He was jailed during the 10 turbulent years.  There
 were neither magazines and newspapers nor pen and writing paper in the
 prison cell.  Nor was he allowed visitors or access to news reports.  In
 spite of all this he did not give up.  He said:  "After I was put into
 prison, I did not feel sorry about dying, nor was fame important to me.
 But my views on economics that I had been studying for a long period could
 in no way be discarded; had I died I had to leave these views for the
 masses to understand!"  On the second day following his imprisonment, he
 began to recall the draft for the book "On Socialist Economy" which he
 .intended to write many years ago.  Excluding the preface, the book has 22
 chapters and 183 sections.  During the 7 years and 5 days when he was
 deprived of freedom, Comrade Sun Yefang worked out in his mind the draft of
 the whole program on dozens of occasions.  He also used the pen and paper
 that were given to him for writing "letters of confession" to write an
 article entitled "My Argument With Some Persons in the Economic Sector" in
 hundreds and thousands of characters to refute the fallacies of Chen Boda
 and the "gang of four."  Such is his character of refusing to yield to any
 pressure and even imprisonment.  No matter how bad the situations were, he
 unremittingly fought for the truth.  In the first half of April 1975, Com-
 rade Sun Yefang was bewildered when he was suddenly released but at the
 same time was forced to write the "three correct treatments."  But he
 openly declared:  "I will not change my will, my profession, my views!"
 Following the downfall of the "gang of four" and particularly since the
 measures taken by the CPC Central Committee to restore order, the criticism
 of "leftist" mistakes and the advocation of reforming the economic system
 have helped to prove that many of Comrade Sun Yefang's viewpoints are cor-
 rect.  But amid praise, he said:  "My theoretical viewpoints are not and
 cannot be '100 percent correct."'  He acknowledged that in the past, under
 the influence of the "communist wind," he denied the award system and the
 system of profit retention by enterprises and said that this view "is
 'leftist' thinking."  Such an attitude of daring to make self-criticism is
 as valuable as his courage in upholding truth.
 Comrade Sun Yefang is a veteran communist, with his membership dating
 back to the 1920's.  He is an acknowledged authority in the sector of
 economics in our country.  But he remains modest and open-minded.  He
 sticks to the principle that all are equal before truth and he respects
 differing views, including the views of the comrades under his leadership.
 Time and again he ordered the editorial department of JINGJI YANJIU to give
 priority to carrying the articles that express views different from his own.
 He conscientiously replies to letters to editors.  He suggested the holding
 of open discussions and stressed the importance of protecting the right
 of those criticized to debate.  He said that criticism and struggles are
 not dreadful and that the agony is to have been deprived of the right to
 debate.  He advocates clear-cut viewpoints, no matter how sharply expressed
 they are.  He never cares about personal gain and loss and he never bears
 personal grudges.  Some of the members of the group that is now helping him
 in writing books held different views with him in the past and yet he
 treats them equally, is concerned with them and is also training them.

 These comrades, on the other hand, have also been completely convinced by
 his correct theoretical viewpoints and his lofty character and they have
 become his competent assistants.
 Comrade Sun Yefang's incisive academic views and strict attitude in study
 have a considerable influence in economic  circles in our country; they
 are generally respected and have also become famous in economic circles
 abroad.  As his students, we want to follow his example, work hard on the
 economic theoretical front end make our contributions toward implementing
 the socialist modernization grogram of our country.

 THEY ARE THE MOST LOVABLE PEOPLE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 31-33
 [Commentator's article]
 [Text]  Recently, from newspapers and journals to radio and television
 broadcasts, from street corners to numerous families and households and
 from urban to rural areas in the vast socialist motherland, the two
 glorious names of Jiang Zhuying and Luo Jianfu are being transmitted and
 ,eulogized.  Their stirring deeds and lofty characters have touched and
 inspired the hearts of the people, and they can hardly refrain from tears.
 People simply do not know what words can be used to express their esteem
 and love for these two comrades.  We should say:  They, and people such as
 them, are our most lovable people today!
 In talking about most lovable people, people will call to mind the volun-
 teers of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.  During the war
 to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the volunteers were generally
 acknowledged to be the most lovable. people by all patriotic compatriots.
 Among them were heroes like Huang Jiguang, who blocked the enemy's machine
 gun with his chest and paved the way to victory for his comrades-in-arms;
 great fighters like Qiu Shaoyun, who strictly observed the law of ambush
 and remained motionless until his death although his body was on fire;
 and such internationalist fighters as Luo Shengjiao who gloriously gave up
 his life to save a Korean youth.
 Every period has its own most lovable people.  Such people as Zhang Side,
 Liu Mulan and Dong Cunrui were the most lovable people of the revolutionary
 war years.  Precisely because of their struggle and sacrifice new China was
 born.  Peacetime construction was also a battle in another form.  In the
 battle of the 1960's, we had such most lovable people as Jiao Yulu and Lei
 Feng.  Today, in the battle to create a new situation in socialist mod-
 ernization, we have such most lovable people as Jiang Zhuying and Luo
 Jianfu.  Their names should be inscribed in golden characters in the
 heroic history of the great practice of our communist movement.
 In former years the fighters on the Korean battlefield, who endured all
 kinds of hardships and persisted in fighting with the motherland in mind,

 beautiful their words were:  "We are eating snow here precisely so that the
 people of our motherland will not have to eat snow.  They can sit in their
 clean, bright and spacious houses, brew pots of tea close to their small
 stove, eat what they want and do as they please."  Must not such most
 lovable people as Jiang Zhuying and Luo Jianfu battling on the forefront
 of building material civilization and spiritual civilization also nurse the
 same aspiration?  "The needs of the state are our responsibility.  How can
 a scientific worker stand by with folded arms when practical problems crop
 up?"  This was what Jiang Zhuying said as well as practiced.  "In science,
 the important thing is the 'result' of research and not !individual'
 researcher."  This was what Luo Jianfu said as well as practiced.  For
 years they diligently worked and created under conditions similar to
 "mouthfuls of fried wheat flour and snow," willingly served as "paving
 stones  and were always ready to offer the most valuable scientific
 research materials they had mastered to others.  People could not help
 associating their character with that of the telephone operator who used
 his own body as a cable to ensure the smooth function of the communication
 network on the Korean battlefield in former years.  Jiang Zhuying and Luo
 Jianfu were indeed worthy of the title of most lovable people!
 The most lovable people on the Korean battlefront in former years were the
 indomitable fighters made of special stuff.  Although seriously wounded,
 they nevertheless gritted their teeth, stuffed the intestines back into
 their abdomens, covered the wounds with their broken hands and continued
 to give battle.  Today, we have the case of Luo Jianfu who, when his chest
 was bloated by tumors and his skin was burning with intense pain, still
 refused to take pain-killing injections or sleeping pills because that
 would interfere with his continued investigation and manufacture of the
 "Type III" graphic generator.  Likewise, Jiarig Zhuying also bravely bore
 the pain of numerous illnesses and continued his battle until his final
 breath.  How faithful and loyal they were to the cause of the party, the
 people and the motherland!  Like candles, they burned themselves up and
 gave all their heat and light to the socialist cause.  This kind of spirit
 is on the same plane as that of such heroes as Huang Jiguang and Qiu
 Shaoyun.  To call them most lovable people is not at all excessive!
 As in the case of the tens of thousands of most lovable people from among
 the workers, peasants and intellectuals who appeared on the Korean battle-
 field, there are also tens of thousands of advanced elements who selflessly
 give their all for the country, for society and?for the people in every
 field of socialist construction.  They came from among the workers, the
 peasants, the PLA and also the intellectuals.  Jiang Zhuying and Luo Jianfu
 were the representatives of advanced intellectual personalities.  There are
 still many more advanced personalities like them among the intellectuals.
 Wang Jiyong has been praised as a "living Jiang Zhuying," Zhang Tongxing
 has been praised as a "living Luo Jianfu," and famous economist Comrade Sun
 Yefang is still giving counsel in creating a new situation in socialist
 construction despite his serious illness.  They all are this kind of
 advanced personality.  They radiate the bright light of communist ideology
 and they are the reappearance of the proletarian revolutionaries with com-
 munist spirit of the war years under new historical conditions.  They

 understand science and have the knowledge, and furthermore, they also keep
 on seeking and exploring and use their knowledge to provide the most effec-
 tive service for socialist construction.  They have made. so many contribu-
 tions to the party, the motherland and the people, but they are still not
 satisfied and feel that they have not done enough.  In material life and
 treatment, they ask almost nothing from the party, the motherland and the
 people, but they always feel satisfied and refuse what is actually
 extremely rational consideration.  They freely and unconditionally dis-
 solve themselves completely into the socialist cause of the people.  Their
 greatest happiness is dedicating their all.  For the sake of struggling to
 uphold the truth, they are never the slightest bit disloyal or half-hearted
 no matter under what kind of conditions.  "The road may be long and far,
 but I will keep on searching from top to bottom."  "As this is also what my
 heart dictates, though I may die nine times I still have no regrets!"  They
 are the best offsprings of the party and the most precious wealth of the
 people.  "What they eat is grass and what they give is milk and blood."
 These words are also most appropriate when applied to them.  Our people,
 our nation and our socialist motherland should take pride in them.  They
 are also the examples people throughout the country should emulate.
 The deeds of Jiang Zhuying and Luo Jianfu have also most clearly showed
 that they are indeed worthy to be called the outstanding vanguards of the
 working class.  Their deeds have also manifested the spiritual features of
 intellectuals trained, tempered and tested for more than 30 years.  Facts
 have shown that most of our intellectuals have ideals, aspirations and
 capabilities.  They are imbued with the sense of responsibility of develop-
 ing China.  They have inseparably bound their destiny with the destiny of
 the workers, the peasants and the socialist motherland.  They have indeed
 long become a component of the working class.  They are one of the three
 basic social forces of socialist modernization.  Our socialist construction
 must rely on the creativity and labor of the workers and peasants.  At the
 same time, we also absolutely cannot be short of the efforts and struggles
 of the intellectuals.  Without a powerful contingent of intellectuals, we
 will not be able to rely on the forces of science and technology and the
 forces of the intellectuals to promote the development of productive forces,
 and we will also not be able to raise the scientific and cultural level of
 the whole nation and educate the people to become disciplined workers with
 ideals, ethics and culture.  Without intellectuals, the task of quadrupling
 production cannot be fulfilled, and the building of the two civilizations
 will become an empty phrase.  Before liberation, our country was an
 economically and culturally very backward semifeudal and semicolonial
 society, and we had actually very few intellectuals.  Since liberation,
 along with the development of cultural and educational undertakings, we
 have more intellectuals trained by the working class; but because of the
 fetters of "leftist" ideology and the concept of small production, the
 growth and expansion of the contingent of intellectuals have for a long
 time been suppressed.  During the 10 years of internal disorder of the
 "Great Cultural Revolution,  large numbers of intellectuals were prosecuted
 and this widened the gap between our science and technology and those of the
 advanced contemporary international level.  At present, the broad masses of
 intellectuals in our  country have shouldered the glorious and arduous

 mission of carrying forward the revolutionary cause and forging ahead into
 the future, as well as invigorating and developing our scientific, cultural
 and educational undertakings.  Their tasks are extremely arduous; but their
 family burden is heavy, their living and working conditions are poor and
 the state of their physical condition is rather serious.  This kind of con-
 dition is also particularly noticeable among middle-aged intellectuals such
 as Jiang Zhuying and Luo Jianfu.  All these have more clearly manifested the
 importance and urgency of implementing the policy toward intellectuals and
 giving full play to the role of intellectuals.
 However, even now, the mentality of belittling and despising intellectuals
 still finds a certain market.  Some comrades still do not acknowledge that
 like the workers and peasants, the intellectuals are a reliable force for
 building socialism.  Some comrades have remained indifferent to the fact
 that the treatment for intellectuals is inclined to be too low, and even
 resented improving the treatment and working conditions of intellectuals.
 Some comrades have assumed airs as representatives of workers and peasants
 and raised objection to the all-round implementation of the policy toward
 intellectuals.  In their eyes, it seems as though putting the stress on
 knowledge and intellectuals means negating the value of physical labor and
 the role of the workers and peasants.  This viewpoint of setting the intel-
 lectuals against the workers and peasants is extremely wrong and runs.
 counter to the opinion of the workers and peasants working diligently and
 conscientiously on the frontline of production.  The working masses under-
 stand best the role played by science and technology in production as well
 as in lightening and protecting labor.  They also clearly see the gap
 between the contribution and treatment of scientific and technical
 personnel.  They fully understand the need for closely integrating physical
 labor with mental labor and the fact that the workers and intellectuals
 cannot be separated from each other.  After the practice of the production
 responsibility system, the broad masses of peasants have a strong desire
 for scientific knowledge, and it is no longer news that technicians have
 become targets whom the peasants are competing for.  This mentality of not
 acknowledging that complicated labor is worth more than simple labor, not
 acknowledging the fact that mental labor requires certain working condi-
 tions and therefore not agreeing to improving the working conditions of
 intellectuals to heighten and enhance the efficiency of mental labor, is
 detrimental to the development of productive forces and to the early
 realization of modernization, and therefore, also does not conform to the
 basic interests of the workers and peasants.  The workers and peasants have
 all along regarded the intellectuals as indispensable members of their own
 working class.  They call upon all units with intellectuals to correct their
 understanding and attitude regarding intellectuals, conscientiously imple-
 ment the  party's policy toward intellectuals with a high degree of con-
 sciousness and fully trust and protect the intellectuals.  In particular,
 they must pay attention to taking care of and cherishing the group of out-
 standing intellectuals, who are hardworking like Jiang Zhuying and Luo
 Jianfu and have genuine ability and learning, let them boldly put their
 ideals and aspirations for building socialism to use and bring into play
 all their wisdom and strength.

 MAKING SERIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND STUDIES IS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR THE
 THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS OF ALL PARTY CADRES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 34-36
 [Ideological commentary by Shi Youxin [2457 0645 2946]]
 [Text]  Today, when reading the series of letters and comments written by
 Comrade Mao Zedong in 1961 on investigations and studies, we still have a
 feeling of freshness and closeness.  One should proceed from reality in
 doing everything.  He who has made no investigations has no right to
 comment.  This should become the guiding principle for the thoughts and
 actions of party leaders and comrades of the whole party.
 Making investigations and studies is the basic means of Marxism.  No matter
 what we do, and what we work at, it is necessary to bring the subjective to
 meet the objective and thoughts to actions in order to reach the expected
 goal.  If they fail to meet with each other we will run into a stone wall
 and meet with failure, which goes contrary to our wishes.  Why is subjec-
 tivism wrong?  Because it does not proceed from reality but from subjective
 desires.  Comrade Mao Zedong said:  'The Marxist spirit is to make serious
 investigations and studies on specific problems and to make concrete
 analysis instead of abstract and subjective analysis.  Marxist philosophy
 is both dialectic materialism and historical materialism.  It guides people
 to have an accurate understanding of the true colors of the objective world.
 Whether it is making revolution or doing construction, no success will be
 achieved unless we proceed from the realities of our country and integrate
 the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of our country.
 And the course of integration is also the course of investigating realities
 and learning the objective law.  It is not simply a matter of working style
 to go deep into the realities of life, make investigations and studies, to
 get hold of the large amount of reliable material and then draw forth the
 correct strategies, but it is a matter of upholding Marxist epistemology
 and the party's ideological line.  If one keeps oneself from the colorful
 and concrete perceptual knowledge and away from the base and source of
 recognition, how can one achieve a correct understanding?  Some comrades
 stick to the old habit of having no contact with reality which was formed
 over years, and some are used to copying word for word the instructions
 from senior authorities when issuing orders.  Instead of taking into con-
 sideration the concrete situations of one's own local area and unit,

 suggesting new methods and blazing new roads, they either seek uniformity
 regardless of real conditions or give vague and general instructions.
 The problem lies in the fact that their thinking is detached from reality.
 A great number of facts in real life have shown that whoever goes investi-
 gating among the masses, his thinking will be liberated and he will be able
 to create a new situation for the work.  Whoever fails to make investiga-
 tions and studies, his thinking will be rigid and he will get nowhere.
 Therefore it should always come first to uplift our spirit, do a harder job
 in making investigations and studies and straighten out the ideological
 line.
 If we only recall history, we will come to realize that whether we make
 investigations or not has a direct bearing on the prosperity and success
 of the course of revolution and construction.  In the years of revolu-
 tionary warfare, owing to subjectivism which did not make investigations
 and studies, and which did not proceed from realities, our party suffered
 great losses, most of the revolutionary bases collapsed and over 90 percent
 of the revolutionary forces were lost.  Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the
 road of having the countryside encircle the urban areas, and a whole series
 of principles and policies on new democratic revolution.  The fact that
 they could lead the Chinese revolution to victory is simply because Comrade
 Mao Zedong did not copy exactly the experiences of other countries, but
 through investigations and studies he got to know the national conditions
 of China and then concentrated the wisdom of the whole party and made con-
 crete use of Marxism to bring things into conformity with the realities of
 our country.  After the founding of our country, we had similar experiences
 and lessons.  In any period that attached importance to investigations and
 studies, such as the early fifties and early sixties, party principles and
 policies were relatively in conformity with the objective realities and
 the various items of work got on very well and the achievements were
 remarkable.  In some other periods, the guiding principles and policies
 were seriously separated from reality.  This gave rise to great losses.
 One of the important reasons is that few or no investigations were made.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the party's 11th National Congress, the
 party Central Committee has repeatedly stressed seeking truth from facts,
 liberating one's mind and proceeding from reality.  Resuming and encourag-
 ing the fine tradition of making investigations and studies has again
 brought the various principles and policies in conformity with the realities
 of our country as well as with the aspirations of the party and the people.
 As a result, our party is once again full of vitality and prosperity just
 as in the times of Yenan and the period just after the founding of the
 country.  Historical experiences have proved that the rise and the decline
 of the party's course is closely related to the growth and the dis-
 appearance of the style of making investigations and studies.  It is at a
 great cost that our party has come to realize the importance of making
 investigations and studies.
 Comrade Mao Zedong said:  Making investigations and studies is extremely
 important.  There are three conditions to doing a job:  1) To have a clear
 picture of the situation; 2) great determination; and 3) right methods.
 Among these three, to have a clear picture of the situation is the basis.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Only if one has a clear picture of the situation can the resolution one
 makes be correct.  The stronger the right resolution, the better can one do
 the job.  On the contrary, if one makes up one's mind before making sure
 of the situation, it might be resolution to do a wrong action, and the
 stronger is this resolution the worse the matter might turn out to be.
 These kinds of examples are not uncommon.  To have a clear picture of the
 situation is the precondition of correct methods.  An important reason for
 our winning battles in the past is that our warfare tactics--the deployment
 of army forces, the selection of breaches, the confirmation of the time of
 attack--met with realities.  Correct deployment could only come from
 previous thorough reconnaissance and studies of the situation.  In 1936,
 Comrade Peng Dehuai led the Red Army to attack Shanxi.  He made surveys by
 himself for a week in order to decide when to cross the Yellow River.  In
 1949, in attacking Taiyuan, we had over 200,000 troops yet he still could
 not set his heart at ease.  He again led the scouting officer round Taiyuan
 himself and investigated the place for 4 days.  Now we should create an
 overall new situation.  The problems that are waiting to be solved are much
 more complicated than fighting battles.  The tasks are even harder.  They
 are badly in need of "commanders" at various levels, commanders who will
 personally go investigating at the front line.
 At present, the situation is developing at a rapid pace.  New experiences,
 new creations, new situations and new problems in different spheres and
 respects keep emerging.  Under this situation, being a leader should not
 just mean having one's own thinking keep up with the development of the
 situation but should also mean making a timely summary of the masses'
 experiences and creations and then raising them to a higher level, which
 in return might further guide the masses' practice.  Furthermore, leaders
 should foresee the trend of development of matters and stand in the front
 to guide them.  From the laws of cognizance, once the events and conflicts
 that people face are more complicated and variefied the change will be
 faster, with that, the more should we take care to avoid simple, one-sided
 and rigid recognition and the more need we go deep into reality to make
 investigations and studies.  At present, there are some comrades who do not
 have much determination in doing things.  They lack confidence and means.
 One important reason is that they have stayed in the office for too long a
 time and have made too few investigations and studies of realities.  We are
 dialectic materialists, not idealists.  Our determination and confidence do
 not come from subjective imagination which has no factual basis, instead,
 they are built on the basis of knowing the realities and the objective law.
 When we have a thorough understanding of a certain matter or a certain job
 and find the law, we will naturally be filled with determination and con-
 fidence.
 The same thing applies to methods.  The various conflicts in social produc-
 tion and social living mostly take place and are exposed at the grassroots
 level.  It is the cadres at the grassroots level and the masses who know
 every detail of the various contradictions.  Inexhaustible wisdom is buried
 deep among them.  There are many wise and capable persons who have rich
 practical experience.  Every day they deal with different kinds of contra-
 dictions.  They are all there analyzing and solving contradictions,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 therefore they are also good hands at solving different kinds of contradic-
 tions.  There are many problems that we could not find solutions to by
 racking our minds in the office.  Once we have had discussions with the
 masses and the cadres at the grassroots level, there will be solutions.
 Any leaders who have boldness and means, who can make a breakthrough in
 the working situation despite complicated contradictions, are leaders who
 are good at discovering, summarizing and spreading the experiences and
 creations of the masses from investigations and studies.  Different forms
 of systems of contracted responsibilities with payment linked to output
 have been created by. the masses.  The party Central Committee discovered
 this creation and encouraged it.  This has given rise to a great readjust-
 ment in the relationship of production in our country's rural areas.  As a
 result, the development of productive forces has  been vigorously pushed
 forward.  Comrade Mao Zedong always said in Yenan that sometimes he was
 uncertain about something and felt upset, but once he got in touch with
 reality and with the masses and cadres at the grassroots level, he would
 know what to do.  Even a leader like Comrade Mao Zedong with a high level
 of Marxism, profound learning and rich experiences had to get his ideas
 and methods by learning from reality and the masses.  Should not we do just
 the same?
 Some comrades think that they can have a clear idea of things and give
 working instructions by listening to reports and reading written reports
 brought to them from grassroots units.  Of course this method is necessary,
 yet it is quite insufficient.  Amore important and basic means to grasp
 reality is if the leaders take a direct part in making investigations and
 studies.  Only by so doing can they obtain basic knowledge about various
 problems as well as a wealth of firsthand material.  Only by doing so can
 they listen directly to the voices and opinions of the masses and have a
 better understanding of their experiences and creations.  Things and
 happenings found out in such a way are more authentic and reliable than
 material retold or written down by some other people.  For they are facts
 seen and heard by the leaders themselves when they make their personal
 appearance at the forefront of practical activities.  They find out the
 facts directly from the participants of the event on production and work,
 therefore they are vivid and concrete, true to life and original as well,
 whereas items in written reports are generally polished.  They are naturally
 influenced by the thinking method, level of understanding, analyzing ability
 and writing skill of the report writers.  Some might add inflammatory
 details to the account, changing one to two things; some might be poor at
 summing up, making analysis and expressing themselves, so as a result, some
 very good experiences are not properly presented.  Even though what the
 leaders read are reports written after making serious investigations, (this
 is of great use) yet to the leaders themselves they are still indirect
 experiences though they are something of direct experience to other people.
 Therefore, it is still necessary for us to make investigations ourselves.
 Self-acquired firsthand material is the base, and some other written
 reports and data are then referred to.  As far as our horizon and insight
 are concerned, it will make a lot of difference if we have not looked into
 the matter.  Having done so, it will enable us to grasp the main contradic-
 tions, experiences and problems.  Furthermore, it will enable us to analyze,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 select and make use of the material in the written reports on a higher
 plane.  Finally, we can combine them with what we find out in our investi-
 gations, from which we might come to some essential conclusions which we
 take as our guiding principles.
 The purpose of making investigations is to solve problems and to bring the
 subjective in conformity with the objective.  Therefore, it is necessary to
 adopt an honestly scientific attitude in making investigations.  This is a
 basic demand on making investigations and studies.  In 1932 Comrade Mao
 Zedong pointed out:  "one of our slogans is that he who has made no investi-
 gations has no right to make comments.  The other is that he who did not
 make proper investigations has no right to make comments either."  The
 second slogan can be said to be a development of the first one.  This shows
 that the method of investigation encouraged by our party does not mean any
 kind of investigation, but the right investigation.  Any investigation that
 goes against objective reality such as sticking to first impressions, seek-
 ing proof, especially for oneself, with bias, or investigation which does
 not speak the truth though knowing only too well there is falsehood will
 not only be unable to reach the right conclusion but the label of "making
 investigations and studies" might do a lot of harm.  We have learned not a
 few lessons in this respect.  We should be on our guard against that.  No
 matter under what conditions, we should make a comprehensive analysis and
 summing-up of our investigation material.  We shall not be cheated by
 various false phenomena, nor should we be satisfied with observation that
 are isolated, one-sided, and that might shut our eyes to the law of
 development of matter.  Nor shall we be afraid of listening to different
 opinions.  Above all, we should not be afraid that the judgment and deci-
 sion we have already made might be toppled by the trial of practice.
 Making investigations is something of significance.  Responsible leaders
 of the party committees at various levels should personally set the ball
 rolling.  Some comrades have emphasized that they are too busy with their
 work to go to grassroots units.  It is a fact that they are busy and they
 need to squeeze in time to go down.  Leading comrades of the party Central
 Committee are occupied with a myriad of state affairs every day.  Doubt-
 lessly, they are the busiest of all.  However, they still squeeze in time
 for making investigations and studies in the four corners of the country.
 We should learn from their examples.  Here, making investigations and
 studies and improving the style and method of leadership are closely
 related and help each other forward.  If we do not make investigations and
 studies the more easily will our leading energy get trapped in trivial
 affairs; as a result, the less time we will have to get to basic units.
 In order to change this vicious circle, we should begin with making inves-
 tigations and studies.  Leading organizations at various levels, especially
 the main leading comrades, shall take the lead in changing their leading
 style and improving their method of leadership.  Seize a major period of
 time and go deep into the realities of life.  This will not only help one
 do one's own job as a leader well, but can give the juniors an example to
 follow.  Similarly, this might well create conditions for the junior
 organizations to change their style and improve their working methods.

 There is a giant in Greek mythology called (Antai), the son of the sea god
 Poseidon and the earth goddess Gaia.  When fighting, he can continuously
 absorb strength from his earth mother and therefore be incompatible on the
 condition that his body does not leave the earth.  We can say that the
 people and the masses are the mother of us communist people.  As long as
 we do not keep ourselves away from the masses and reality, and make investi-
 gations and studies, and seek truth from facts, as long as we proceed from
 reality in doing anything, we can incessantly absorb inexhaustible strength
 from the mother.  Our course will surely be to win one victory after
 another.

 [1HAT COUNTS MOST IS TO SOLVE IDEOLOGICAL, UNDERSTANDING PROBLEMS OF LEADING
 BACKBONES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 37-39
 [Commentator's article]
 [Text)  At present, cadres throughout the country are studying the docu-
 ments of the 12th CPC Congress and this vigorous mass drive is developing
 in depth.  The gains of this study campaign are notable.  The majority of
 cadres have more or less gained the same understanding of the program,
 principle and policies formulated by the 12th CPC Congress and have begun
 to solve some ideological problems.  However, it must be realized that
 this is merely a good start and the achievements are still initial ones.
 There are still many problems both in the intensity and scope of study
 which require us to develop this study drive in depth.  However, the lead-
 ing bodies of some localities and units do not quite understand this.
 After leafing through the pages once, they thought they had "already
 studied" the documents and grasped their essence "sufficiently well."
 Thus, they slackened their efforts in study.  In reality, they have not
 grasped the essence of the documents.  They have not found out, in rela-.
 tion with their actual thinking, the principal ideological obstacles to
 the implementation of the guidelines of the 12th CPC Congress in all fields
 of work and conscientiously solved the major problems of understanding in
 the leading bodies.  This method of study will invariably affect the imple-
 mentation of the guidelines of the 12th CPC Congress.
 In order to truly master the documents of the 12th CPC Congress, deepen our
 understanding and bring our thinking into line with the tasks, principles
 and policies formulated by the congress, it is first necessary to unify the
 ideology and understanding of the leading bodies at all levels, particu-
 larly the leading backbones at and above the county level.  Practice since
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee shows that how
 fast a locality, department or unit can develop depends on whether or not
 the leading body follows a correct ideological line, whether it has achieved
 unity in ideology and understanding and whether it is truly at one, polit-
 ically speaking, with the Central .Committee.  Where a good aob has been
 done in studying and grasping the guidelines of the 12th CPC Congress, the
 political awareness of the leading backbones is high and no time has been
 lost in emancipating the mind, things will develop swiftly and there will be

 a new situation in all work and rapid progress in production and other
 fields of construction.  On the contrary, if the leading cadres of a
 locality or unit are slow in becoming politically awakened and adopt a
 wait-and-see attitude, the initiative of the masses of cadres and people
 will not be brought into full play and work and production will lag behind.
 Therefore, in the present drive to study the guidelines of the 12th CPC
 Congress, leading cadres at all levels must learn from this experience,
 avoid "going through the motions" and concentrate first on solving the
 problems of ideology and understanding of the leading backbones.  Leading
 backbones must pay special attention to this task and we must pay special
 attention to the leading backbones.  Each level must keep an eye on the
 other and it is necessary to grasp the work down to the grassroots level.
 This is the key to mastering the documents of the 12th 'CPC Congress.
 The guidelines of the 12th CPC Congress are the development and improvement
 of the line, principles and policies since the 3d Plenary Session of the.
 11th CPC Central Committee.  In linking with one's actual thinking, it is
 first necessary to lay stress on linking with one's actual thinking since
 the 3d plenary session and gain a deeper understanding of the line, prin-
 ciples and policies since then.  Leading backbones at all levels must
 earnestly review the party's principles and policies since the 3d plenary
 session and find out which of these have been implemented quite well and
 where they fall short and why.  They must also find out if there are ideas
 in their own locality or department which are inconsistent with the guide-
 lines of the 12th CPC Congress.  On the basis of review and sorting out,
 they will be able to find out the principal ideological obstacles to the
 implementation of the guidelines of the 12th CPC Congress, seize on some
 major problems of ideology and understanding and work out specific solu-
 tions.  For example, a small number of cadres, including some leading
 cadres at and above the county level, feel uneasy about some of our present
 policies and fear that these policies "show deviations" and are "inclined
 to the right" because they have not thoroughly rid themselves of the "left"
 ideological influence.  They welcome diversified economic undertakings in
 practice but are not convinced on a theoretical level.  In particular, they
 .are still skeptical about the socialist .character of the production respon-
 sibility systems instituted in the countryside.  Some of them think that
 we are drifting farther and farther away from communism.  In the past,
 undertakings were "large in size and collective in nature."  Now they are
 "small in size and private in nature."  For another example, some cadres
 are one-sided in their understanding of the relationship between economic
 construction. and the building of spiritual civilization.  They think that
 once production and the people's standards of living have gone up, spiritual
 civilization will be built as a matter of course.  They fail to understand
 the importance of ideological and cultural education and the fact that
 education and science are one of the strategic priorities of economic
 development.  They think that these are "light tasks" that can be dispensed
 with.  Some of them still entertain "left" prejudices about intellectuals
 and. ref use to recognize that intellectuals, like workers and peasants, are
 forces we must rely on in building socialism.  They think that "intellec-
 tuals were subjected to too much criticism in the past but are too lavishly
 praised now."  They even ask:  "With the intellectuals becoming so popular,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 what will become of the Communist Party?"  In dealing with this kind of
 major problem of ideology and understanding, leading backbones at all
 levels must bravely say what is on their mind, be bold in appraising one-
 self and consciously expose contradictions in ideology and in work with the
 spirit of rectification of work style.  They must earnestly unfold criti-
 cism and self-criticism and overcome "left" and right errors in ideology
 and understanding which are inconsistent with the guidelines of the 12th
 CPC Congress.  Only in this way will it be possible to remove the obstacles
 to the implementation of the guidelines of the 12th CPC Congress.
 In emphasizing that we must now lay stress on linking with actual thinking,
 we are not talking in generalities and it certainly does not mean that we
 are not going to solve actual problems of work which can be solved now.
 Rather, we must bear in mind the party's. central tasks and try to do a
 better job in solving major problems and tackling formidable tasks in
 actual work on the basis of unified thinking.  For example, the organiza-
 tional reform, reforms in the economic system, party rectification and so
 on which we are carrying out now or will carry out in the future are all
 formidable tasks involving complicated problems and a strong policy bearing.
 In order to smoothly accomplish these tasks, leading cadres at all levels
 must first of all conscientiously study the documents, deepen their under-
 standing and overcome incorrect ideas.  If they are content with their
 half-baked knowledge and do not conscientiously study the guidelines of the
 documents, they will not be able to fight these tough battles well.
 As the situation develops, our party will continuously put forward new
 tasks to implement the guidelines, of the 12th CPC Congress.  For example,
 the new constitution adopted by the Fifth Session of the Fifth NPC and
 the Sixth 5-Year Plan are more concrete, enriched and developed than their
 corresponding sections in the documents of the 12th CPC Congress.  We must
 study these documents well in order to continuously deepen the drive to
 study the documents of the 12th CPC Congress.

 A GOOD EXAMPLE IN USING MATERIALIST DIALECTICS TO SUM UP EXPERIENCE AND
 GUIDE CONSTRUCTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 pp 38-42
 [Article by Zhang Jing [4545 4544]]
 [Text]  Avery important feature of the report to the 12th party congress
 is that in summing up experiences in the past or in expounding a series of
 major questions in socialist construction, this report has followed the
 principle of seeking truth from facts and the scientific ideological method
 of materialist dialectics.  This view is, in fact, what has been desired by
 the whole party and the whole nation in the tortuous path they traversed
 over the past many years and it represents a key for guaranteeing the
 prosperity of the socialist cause.  We must not only conscientiously read
 and study each part of this report but must also understand the whole con-
 tent so that we will be able to understand the scientific ideological
 method represented in this report.
 Materialist dialectics is a theory that is within our reach to understand.
 This Marxist ideological method requires us to understand things according
 to their objective nature and their inner law, without any subjective and
 metaphysical elements.  Things themselves are complicated and multifaceted
 and therefore our understanding must not be simple and lopsided, nor can we
 use our lopsided view to study the overall nature of things.  Things are
 constantly moving, developing and changing and therefore our understanding
 must not stagnate.  As things themselves include contradictions, it is
 necessary for us in analyzing and handling problems to constantly study
 the movement of the contradictions of these things and grasp the dialec-
 tical relations of the unity of opposites. of the two sides of contradic-
 tions.  The root cause of our failures in the past was mainly that
 ideologically we parted from materialist dialectics and the law of the
 unity of opposites and that in some major questions, we seriously com-
 mitted the mistakes of subjectivity and lopsidedness.  In their attempt to
 seize party and political power, the counterrevolutionary cliques of Lin
 Biao and Jiang Qing pushed this subjectivity and lopsidedness to their
 utmost and consequently subjectivity and metaphysics were rampant.  Measures
 have been taken since the 3d. Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Com-
 mittee to restore order and basically correct subjectivity and metaphysics
 ideologically and restore the scientific ideological method of materialist

 dialectics.  The reason for the report to the 12th party congress contain-
 ing scientific nature and tremendous convincing power lies in the fact
 that this report has followed and practiced the demand of materialist
 dialectics.
 These features of the report are first demonstrated in analyzing and
 expounding such questions of major principle as social principal contradic-
 tions and the party key works on the relationship between economy and
 politics.
 We suffered setbacks in the past primarily because we did not proceed from
 reality in handling such major questions and we handled them with subjec-
 tivity and lopsidedness.  After the exploiting class was eliminated as a
 class, we still regarded principal contradictions as class struggle and
 stressed the importance of taking "class struggle as the key" while under
 the situation in which economic construction has become our central task,
 we still stuck to the past practice of emphasizing such slogans as "giving
 prominence to politics" and "putting politics in command" and launched
 political movements one after another.  Such practice not only delayed the
 shift of key work but also did harm to cadres and the broad masses of the
 people and confused normal relations among mankind.  As a result, some
 comrades became used to "taking the road they are familiar with," that is,
 they became used to undertaking political struggle and political movements.
 However, some comrades were indifferent to politics and they were sick of
 political struggle.  This is why, in the process of restoring order
 taken since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, some
 cadres have failed to totally rid themselves of the influence of the past
 "leftist" mistakes and intentionally or. not have taken the old road of
 "class struggle as the key.."  Some other comrades have disregarded prole-
 tarian politics, opposed the "left" with the "right" and even doubted and
 denied the four basic principles.  In the final analysis, these two tenden-
 cies were caused by people's understanding that departed from reality, by
 objectivity and by failures in summing up experiences and lessons well and
 correctly understanding the changes in social principal contradictions,
 shift of key work and the dialectical relations between economy and politics.
 An important contribution of the report to the 12th party congress is that
 following the "Resolution on Some Historical Questions Within the Party,
 Since the Founding of the PRC," this report has further and basically
 resolved these problems that are concerned with the whole situation.  This
 report not only points out that class struggle is no longer the social
 principal contradiction and the key work of the party and the state has
 been shifted to economic construction but also dialectically expounds the
 relationship between the principal contradiction and other contradictions
 and the relationship between economy and politics following the shift of
 key work.  It puts the socialist modernization program in the first place,
 but at the same time it in no way neglects the importance of socialist
 political building and the party ideological and political work; it has
 completely corrected the "leftist" mistakes of "class struggle as the key"
 and yet it also points out the necessity of carrying out class struggle
 that still exists within a certain sphere.  The whole report is charac-
 terized by the spirit of economy being the key, politics the guarantee and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 that the modernization program we are implementing is socialist moderniza-
 tion.  Thus, under the new historical period, the report correctly handles
 the dialectical relationship between economy and politics.  By following
 the orientation pointed out by the report, we will be able to prevent
 subjectivity and lopsidedness and avoid the past lesson of going from one
 lopsidedness to another and from one extreme to another.
 Second, the features. of the report are shown in a series of guiding
 ideology and principles and policies with regard to economic construction
 and political building.
 Economically, the report includes a very important guiding ideology of
 paying attention to dialectically unifying speed with efficiency.  When
 referring to the strategic goal of quadrupling annual gross industrial and
 agricultural output value by the end of this century, the report particu-
 larly stresses the importance of "constantly improving economic efficiency"
 as the premise; it also stresses the importance of defining strategic keys
 and strategic measures while the arrangement of the various tasks during
 the period of the Sixth and Seventh 5-Year Plans must also be centered on
 improving economic efficiency so as to create conditions for unifying speed
 with efficiency still better in the future.  The report points out that in
 realizing strategic goals it is imperative to follow the four major prin-
 ciples:  concentrate funds for key construction and constantly improving
 people's life, persist in the leading position of the state economy and
 develop various forms of economy, persist in planned economy as the main
 and market regulation as the supplement and persist in self-reliance and
 expanding economic and technical exchange with foreign countries.  In fact,
 these four principles represent the four pairs of contradictions that are
 related with the whole situation in carrying out socialist economic con-
 stru~tion, the four pairs of the dialectical relationship of the unity of
 opposites and the result of deeper understanding of the law of socialist
 construction.  For quite a long period in the past, there was "leftist"
 lopsidedness in these aspects and when we were correcting this lopsidedness,
 some people slid down to another extreme.  We must acknowledge that in
 handling these relations, lopsidedness may easily happen because people
 have different ideological levels-and positions.  But when we have grasped
 materialist dialectics and we are good at carrying out investigations and
 consider and analyze problems dialectically, we will be able to see that
 the two sides of contradictions contradict and oppose each other and at
 the same time to see that they are related to each other and they penetrate
 each other.  Consequently, we will be able to raise our ideological level,
 we will not be limited by our positions and we will be able to decrease
 lopsidedness considerably.
 Politically, the guiding ideology and principles and policies for building
 socialist spiritual civilization and developing socialist democracy men-
 tioned in the report are also characterized by materialist dialectics,
 objectivity and comprehensiveness.  The general guiding ideology in building
 spiritual civilization is that the building must be carried out simultane-
 ously with the building of materialist civilization. (because these two
 aspects condition and are aimed at each other), while in building spiritual

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 civilization it is necessary to simultaneously grasp the building of
 culture and ideology (because these two aspects penetrate and promote each
 other).  Theoretically, the report has made new developments and contribu-
 tions in its profound presentation of the dialectical relations of the
 unity of opposites of these two aspects and therefore it enables us to
 understand and carry out in an overall way the socialist construction and
 the building of spiritual civilization and avoid lopsidedness in doing so.
 For example, the system of our country is the system of the dictatorship
 of the people's democracy.  On the one hand, this system guarantees that
 the broad masses of the people are masters of their land while on the
 other, it guarantees to exercise dictatorship over the few antagonistic
 elements and these two aspects are dialectically unified.  We are deter-
 mined to develop socialist democracy but it is not permitted to give the
 antagonistic elements that are harmful to society the freedom to carry out
 sabotage activities.  We are determined to exercise dictatorship over the
 few antagonistic elements but we can in no way confuse the enemy and our-
 selves, nor is it permitted to harm the people's right of freedom.  Another
 example is that the building of socialist democracy must be combined with
 the building of a social legal system.  Without a legal system based on
 democracy there will be no legal system to manifest the will of the people.
 Democracy without a legal system is neither dependable nor in a position to
 guarantee democracy.  The right of the people to become the masters of their
 land must be legalized and systematized.  In addition, it is the obligation
 of each citizen to observe and implement law.  The party has led the people
 in working out the constitution and law while the party itself must carry
 out its activities within the range permitted by the constitution and the
 law.  All these supplement each other and are dialectically unified.
 Another example, the implementation of the open-door policy and the policy
 of activating economy in the new historical period must be combined with
 the move to crack down on serious criminal activities in economic, polit-
 ical and cultural sectors.  "It is wrong to pay attention to the latter
 aspect and doubt the former one and it is dangerous to stress the impor-
 tance of the former and neglect the latter."  These two policies are
 apparently scientific and dialectical.
 Third, the features of the report are shown in the art of leadership and
 in working method.
 Following the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the
 leading work of the CPC Central Committee has once again been characterized
 by the fine tradition of seeking truth from facts.  No matter whether in
 restoring order, in working out and implementing principles and policies
 or in handling actual problems, attention has been paid so that in over-
 coming one wrong tendency we will not neglect another wrong tendency and
 we will be able to correctly launch ideological struggle against a "leftist"
 or rightist line.  In these aspects, one of the most typical and the most
 educationally significant is that mentioned by the report.  That is to say,
 in the process of restoring order, we have overcome the obstacles from the
 "left" and the right.  The "leftist" obstacles affirmed everything and
 opposed clarifying and criticizing the "leftist" mistakes that had existed
 for many years and the mistakes made by Comrade Mao Zedong in his late
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 years.  The rightist obstacles denied everything in the process of clarify-
 ing and criticizing, thus "in throwing away the bath water, they also threw
 out the baby too."  In treating these two lopsidednesses, our party did not
 resort to a simple method of oppression; it relied on the collective wisdom
 of the broad masses of cadres and people and gradually solved these problems
 through education and enlightenment.  As a result, while the past mistakes
 were analyzed and criticized, we have also been able to protect the fine
 party traditions, the scientific truth of Mao Zedong Thought and the
 historical position of Comrade Mao Zedong.  As mentioned by the report,
 over the past few years, our party has been able to oppose the "leftist"
 tendency that attempted to restore the wrong theory and policies to those
 during and prior to the "Great Cultural Revolution"; at the same time, it
 also opposed the rightist tendency of bourgeois liberalism that doubted and
 denied the four basic principles.  In this aspect, our party is not only
 firm in its clear-cut stand but is also good at carrying out persuasion and
 education and making the best use of the circumstances.  It has thus shown
 excellent art of leadership and scientific working method.
 How to estimate situations and treat difficulties is a common problem in
 the process of revolution.  These problems have become even more prominent
 following the serious setbacks suffered by the party and the state during
 the 10 turbulent years.  In this aspect, the report has also resorted to
 the objectivity and comprehensiveness of materialist dialectics in over-
 coming certain subjectivity and lopsidedness in certain understanding and
 consequently it has been able to help people clarify vague ideology and
 encourage them to make .progress.  For example, the analyses and comparison
 made in the first part of the report about the historical changes that
 happened twice during the democratic revolution and the present historical
 changes are helpful in guiding people to treat situations and difficulties
 dialectically.  The analyses made in the sixth part of the report about the
 dominant aspects and dark sides in the situations of the party are helpful
 in guiding people to correctly treat party rectification and consequently
 in increasing people's confidence in striving for a better party style of
 work; the analyses made in the conclusion of the report about how Marxists
 should treat difficulties are also dialectical and convincing.  All these
 represent the party's scientific art of leadership and working method.
 Our party has become good at summing up experiences and guiding construc-
 tion according to materialist dialectics; this ability has been achieved
 following the tortuous path taken by the party over the past two decades
 and more; this ability is based on deeper understanding of the law of
 socialist construction and it represents an important mark, showing that
 the party has become more mature in carrying out leadership.
 During the democratic revolution, our party began to understand objective
 law after it experienced a tortuous path for more than two decades prior
 to the seventh party congress and overcame serious subjectivity and lop-
 sidedness ideologically.  Thus, the party has been able to place a series
 of principles and policies on the scientif is basis of materialist dialec-
 tics.  History will not repeat itself but it often has similarities.  Our
 party's understanding of the law of socialist construction also became

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 overall, profound and firm after the tortuous path that lasted for more
 than two decades prior to the eighth party congress.
 We cannot but acknowledge that we have paid a high price for the difficul-
 ties we met since the eighth party congress.  But it is not necessary to
 regret tortuous paths in history.  It is very seldom that people understand
 the law of development in a plain sailing way and to experience a tortuous
 path in this aspect is more in line with materialist dialectics.  Like the
 situations in the period of the democratic revolution after the 6th party
 congress, the tortuous development and the repeated comparisons of victories
 and failures in the more than 20 years following the 8th party congress have
 profoundly educated the party.  As a result, we have deepened our under-
 standing of the law of socialist construction, our party has become more
 mature and it has been able to base its guiding ideology, principles and
 policies and leading method on materialist dialectics even more firmly.  In
 this  aspect, we can say that the significance of the 12th party congress
 is similar to that of the 7th party congress.  That is to say, while the 7th
 party congress was able to guide the revolution to victory, the 12th party
 congress will guide the construction to victory.
 An important feature of the report to the 12th party congress and an impor-
 tant content of general guiding ideology is that the party is good at sum-
 ming up experience and guiding construction by making use of materialist
 dialectics.  If we spare no effort to understand how to use materialist
 dialectics in summing up experience and in guiding construction, we will
 eventually be able to considerably improve our ideological level and lead-
 ing ability.  If we do not work hard to improve our way of thinking and
 overcome subjectivity and lopsidedness, we will not be able to profoundly
 understand and grasp in an overall way the principles and policies of the
 party Central Committee although they are scientific and dialectical and
 consequently we will not be able to carry out these principles and policies
 correctly and we may even make mistakes.
 The report to the 12th party congress deals with general guiding ideology
 and some major principles and policies and therefore in studying this
 report, we must relate these guiding ideology and principles and policies
 to our own thinking and practical experiences so as .to see what kind of
 thinking and ways of working are in line with materialist dialectics and
 should be persisted in and developed and what are contrary to materialist
 dialectics and should consequently be overcome and corrected.  The report
 deals with the whole and general situations while the situations, experi-
 ence and practice of various fronts, regions and units are partial and
 individual.  To understand the whole situation and the general spirit is
 in the interest of studying partial situations and analyzing individual
 situations; on the other hand, in linking with partial situations and
 individual situations we will be able to understand the whole situation
 and the general spirit still better.
 Some comrades considered the study of materialist dialectics to be the
 business of philosophers.  According to their view, it is the "business of
 the above" or the "business of the CPC Central Committee" to use materialist

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 dialectics in summing up experience and guiding construction and this work
 has nothing to do with them.  But it is not so in reality.  As a universal
 law of nature, society and ideology, materialist dialectics exists every-
 where and all sectors belong to this sphere.  As scientific ideological
 methods, materialist dialectics is the soul of all methods and in the final
 analysis, any leading method and working method cannot but take materialist
 dialectics as their core.
 Take the economic work situation for example.  A major feature in major and
 masses production is that various departments, enterprises and links are
 closely linked and they condition each other.  They are constantly moving
 and changing and in the process of their development there exists dialec-
 tical relationships of various contradictions and various unity of oppo-
 sites.  These relationships include those between industry and agriculture,
 light industry and heavy industry, accumulation and consumption, planning
 and freedom, centralization and decentralization, quantity and quality and
 speed and efficiency.  This situation demands that in studying economic
 problems ,and guiding economic work, we must resort to the scientific think-
 ing of materialist dialectics, consciously study the movement of contradic-
 tions in the economic sector and correctly handle various dialectical rela-
 tionships of the unity of opposites.  Some advanced regions and units have
 been able to develop production vigorously and develop economy .rapidly and
 naturally they have good experiences that merit our studying.  If we carry
 out meticulous study, we can find that the most basic reason is that the
 comrades who are responsible for leading production are good at considering
 economic problems dialectically and that their ways of thinking and working
 accord with materialist dialectics and the law of unity of opposites.  For
 example, the experience of the so-called "coordinated process" in industry
 in fact represents a correct handling of the relations of the unity of
 opposites between specialization and coordination while the experience of
 "united body of scientific research and production" represents a correct
 handling of the relations between production and scientific research (the
 so-called production provides the subject and scientific technology writes
 the article).  Another example, the success of the introduction of produc-
 tion responsibility system in rural areas is that because this system has
 correctly handled the dialectical relations between individuals and collec-
 tive and between collective and the state.  On the other hand, the reason
 why the practice of ."everybody eating from the same big pot" obstructed the
 development of production is that it opposes the dialectical method in
 economic life.
 Is it possible to carry out management and define policies without resorting
 to materialist dialectics?  Comrade Chen Yun said:  "In studying problems,
 defining policies and deciding planning it is necessary to compare various
 schemes"; "it is necessary to consider problems from various angles and
 study various conditions and feasibilities."' These words represent a con-
 sciousness in using materialist dialectics.  A book about management said:
 "Correct policies can be achieved from among positive and negative opinions."
 This view also accords with dialectics.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-014608000100440001-9
 The situations are the same in other works.  Our forefathers said these
 words in talking about writing articles:  "The method of writing articles
 is combining flexibility and rigidity" while in creating works, artists
 resort to the method of "strength and grace" and "images and appearances."
 All these mean using materialist dialectics in summing up experience and
 guiding creation consciously or unconsciously.  Any sector that has
 achieved good and successful experience is in line with materialist dialec-
 tics.  Any work has its own relations of the unity of opposites but as long
 as we are able to handle well these relations, we can promote our work and
 reach and surpass advanced standard.
 The report to the 12th party congress points out:  "In the new historical
 period, it is one of the greatest creative project of mankind to build an
 originally backward country in both economy and culture such as China into
 a modern and powerful socialist country."  To finish such an arduous and
 complicated project it is even more important to grasp the scientific
 ideological method of materialist dialectics than any other creativity.
 Should there be any doubt over this question?

 [Text]  In the report to the 12th CPC Congress, three concepts have been
 used in connection with communism, namely, the communist system, the com-
 munist ideology and the communist movement.  What are the differences and
 relations between them?
 The authors of Marxist classics used the term "communism" in different con-
 texts.  First, as a social system in the higher phase of development of
 human society.  Marx and Engels scientifically brought to light the objec-
 tive law that capitalist societies will invariably develop into socialist
 and communist societies.  They also put forward a number of scientific
 assumptions regarding the future of communism as a social system.  In
 their opinion, communist society must go through the socialist and com-
 munist phases in its development.  In communist society, which is a higher
 phase of development, the productive forces are highly developed, the means
 of production are publicly owned by the whole ,society, class distinction and
 social inequalities are completely wiped out and the principle of "from each
 according to his ability, to each according to his needs" is implemented.
 It is the most advanced, the most reasonable and the best social system in
 the history of mankind.  Therefore, the authors of Marxist classics often
 used the term "communism" to show.the ultimate objective of communists.
 Second, as a scientific ideology or theory that guides man in his struggle
 for communism.  Engels once said:  "Communism is teaching concerning the
 conditions for the emancipation of .the proletariat."  This teaching is the
 theory of scientific socialism established by Marx and Engels.  It provides
 the proletariat with a powerful ideological weapon for winning their emanci-
 pation.  Third, as a movement toward the goal of communism.  Marx and Engels
 held that the realization of communism as a social system in any country
 involved a protracted course of practice and required the relentless efforts
 and struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people.  Therefore,
 communism is more than just a social system.  It is above all a movement.
 Marx and Engels said:  "We call communism a real movement which abolishes
 the present state of things."

 The above shows that the communist ideology, the communist movement and the
 communist system are interrelated.  First, without the guidance of the com-
 munist ideology, there will not be any communist movement.  Only by edu-
 cating the working class in communist ideology can we make the workers see
 the essence of the exploitative relations of capitalism, understand the
 historical mission of the working class and organize their own political
 party--the communist party.  It is only under the leadership of the com-
 munist party and with the guidance of the communist ideological system that
 practical activities with the realization of the communist. system as their
 ultimate objective--the communist movement--can take place.  On the other
 hand, the communist ideology is established by Marx and Engels; but it is
 not an immutable, ossified dogma.  It is a revolutionary theory constantly
 enriched and developed through practice in the communist movements of vari-
 ous countries.  The communist ideology must be integrated with the concrete
 practice of the communist movements of various countries before it can
 truly guide the proletariat and the working people in their struggle for
 emancipation.
 Communist ideology, the communist movement and the communist system are
 also inseparable because it is impossible to set a movement apart from its
 objective.  Communism as a social system can definitely be achieved.  This
 is an inexorable law of the development of human society.  However, this
 does not mean that the communist system can spontaneously emerge in a
 capitalist society..  It must first go through a socialist revolution
 involving the replacement of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie with the
 dictatorship of the proletariat and also the building of socialism.  This
 is also the course of development of the communist movement.  The communist
 movement has the communist system as its ultimate objective and the com- ,
 munist system can only be realized ~in full through the constant development
 of the communist movement.  It is precisely in this sense that the report
 to the 12th CPC Congress emphasized that "communism is above all a move-
 ment."  China has now entered the first phase of communism--socialist
 society, and communist ideas and actions have long been part of our actual
 life.  Therefore, the view that communism is but a "dim illusion" and that
 it is no longer necessary to publicize communist ideas is wrong.
 However, while recognizing their interrelations, we must not lose sight of
 their differences.  Although the communist movement has the communist system
 as its ultimate objective, we must not equate one with the other.  The com-
 munist system can only be realized when the social productive forces are
 highly developed, when all members of the society have greatly heightened
 their awareness of communism and when science and education have been greatly
 developed and become universal.  This requires the protracted efforts of
 several generations.  Therefore, the communist movement is divided into
 stages according to different historical periods, and different stages
 have different historical missions.  We must not mix them up.  Although we
 now stress communist ideological education and the extension of the com-
 munist movement, it does not mean that we must now practice the future
 social system of communism.  We must use communist ideology to guide our
 socialist construction and fulfill our tasks in the historical period of
 socialism.  We must also set demands on the CPC members, CYL members and

 all advanced elements according to the communist ideology and moral ethics
 and, through them, to educate and influence the broad masses to work for a
 high level of socialist spiritual civilization.  Besides, the different
 policies followed by the party at different historical periods are worked
 out under the guidance of the communist ideology in the light of actual
 conditions.  In order to fight for communism, we must carry out the party's
 policies for different historical periods.  At present, we must carry out
 the party's policies for the period of socialism, such as the policy of to
 each according to his work.  Therefore, it is completely wrong to confuse
 the differences between communist ideology, the communist movement and the
 communist system and not to conscientiously carry out the party's policies
 for the stage of socialism.

 'IGNORE THE STRONG POINTS AND BRING INTO PLAY THE WEAK ONES' AND 'DEVELOP
 THE STRONG POINTS TO OFFSET THE WEAK ONES'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 24, 16 Dec 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Jiang Xia [3068 7209]]
 [Text]  Our forefathers said a lot about the philosophy of employing
 people.  Some of the more sensible theories were that we must "make use of
 the strong points and ignore the weak ones" and must not "ignore the strong
 points and bring into play the weak ones" or "employ a person to do some-
 thing which he is not skilled in."  Some people even came up with this
 extreme comparison:  "If everyone develops his strong points to offset the
 weak ones, there will not be a single person under heaven who is unfit to
 be employed.  If everyone ignores his strong points and brings into play
 the weak ones, there will not be a single person under heaven who is not
 to be rejected."  This highlighted the importance of appropriately handling
 people's strong and weak points.
 We often come across sayings to this effect in "Zhenguan Zhengyao" [6297
 6034 2398 6008] ["Political Records During the Reign of the Taizong Emperor
 of the Tang Dynasty"], "Zizhi Tongjian" [6327 3112 6639 7003] ["A Synopsis
 of History"], "Guwen Guanzhi" [0657 2329 6034 2972] ["The Best of Classical
 Writings"] and even in some poems.  These sayings give equal weight to
 reasoning and analogy.  They are vivid, incisive and enlightening.  However,
 although their reasoning and analogy show keen insight, they also reveal
 certain weak points.  For example, "the employment of persons" is often
 simply likened to "the use of tools," "a carpenter's choice of wood," "the
 picking of a horse" or "the buying of a piece of jade."  Without knowing,
 they obliterate the characteristics of personnel matters and turn people
 into things.  Thus, man's dynamic role disappears and his strong and weak
 points become innate and unalterable.  This gives rise to corrupt practices.
 In "Qingshi Biecai Ji" [3237 6108 0446 5932 7162] ["Selected Poems From the
 Qing Dynasty"], there is a poem by Gu Sixie [7357 0843 0588] entitled
 "Zaxing" [7177 5281] ["Miscellaneous Thoughts"].  The poem says:  "A fine
 horse can undergo adventures, but it cannot be compared with a cow in work-
 ing the fields.  A firm and solid cart can carry heavy things, but it cannot
 be compared with a boat in crossing rivers.  If we ignore the strong points
 and bring into play the weak ones, even a wise man will be at his wit's end.

 What makes our production tools useful is that they serve our needs.  We
 should take care not to be overcritical."  The idea of this poem is no doubt
 correct insofar as  employing a person according to his skill and ability"
 is concerned.  However, things are not that simple when we consider the
 needs of the situation and changes in the development of human resources.
 No one knows everything and no one can do everything.  In this connection,
 it is metaphysical, unpractical and even a breach of common sense to "ignore
 the strong points and bring into play the weak ones," demand perfection and
 try to make somebody do something which he cannot do.  However, some of
 man's weak points are just signs of neglect, narrow-mindedness or one-
 sidedness.  If these are not properly overcome and offset, they will hinder
 the full development of the strong points.  At a time like this, "bringing
 into play the weak points" becomes our starting point in "offsetting the
 weak points."  If we indiscriminately reject "bringing into play the weak
 points," we are not far .from "shielding our faults."  People who "shield
 their faults" are unwilling to know their weak points and to make an effort
 to improve.  How can these people begin to talk about progress and advance-
 ment!
 .Some people quote this saying by our forefathers every time they are
 assigned tasks which they do not know much about:  "If we try to make
 everybody do things which he cannot do, we will find that there are not
 many capable persons."  They make it quite plain that they are unwilling
 to do the job or are merely working with great reluctance or in a slapdash
 manner.  They do not understand that when we start an undertaking, there is
 no way to avoid unfamiliar territory.  People have dynamic power.  They
 have the ability to learn new knowledge and grasp new skills.  As long as
 we make a conscientious effort to study and to temper ourselves, our "weak
 points" can be turned into "strong points" and "things we cannot do" will
 become "things we can tackle with ease."  If we retreat every time we come
 across difficult problems, how can we master new skills and special
 knowledge?
 In the final analysis, the strong and weak points of a person are by no
 means innate (the idea of "my ability is bestowed by heaven"). ?. They are
 shaped by the history of society and the needs of the times.  When new
 historical events arise, a series of changes will take place, both in the
 overall structure of the strong and weak points of human resources in
 society as a whole, and in the established state of the strong and weak
 points of the individual.  Some strong points and special skills may con-
 tinue to be useful and some weak points and shortcomings need to be offset.
 Nevertheless, the bulk of the work is to cultivate new skills according to
 new needs.  At a time like this, we must answer our cause and do or learn
 things which we are not skilled in at the moment.  This may appear to be
 "-bringing into play the weak points" or "demanding perfection," but
 actually it is the only way to advance our cause and to develop human
 resources.
 At present, we are endeavoring to create a new situation in socialist mod-
 ernization.  There is now a much greater need for qualified persons in all

 fields.  Qualified persons in different fields also have more opportunities
 and occasions to put their ability to good use.  Society has an endless
 need for qualified persons.  Under such circumstances, it seems that while
 continuing to pay attention to the policy of "ignoring the weak points and
 bringing into play the strong ones," we also have to lay stress on "develop-
 ing the strong points to offset .the weak ones" on the question of employing
 human resources.  We must serve the needs of the development of our cause
 and cultivate, through training, new strong points which were lacking in
 the past but are particularly needed now.
 "Bringing into play the weak points" and "demanding perfection" are not to
 be tolerated.  Similarly,."shielding one's faults" and "noninterference"
 are also not to be tolerated.  Our cause needs and is bringing up all kinds
 of qualified persons.  Qualified persons in all fields must serve the needs
 of our cause and actively push our cause forward.  This is probably the gist
 of the question of human resources.
