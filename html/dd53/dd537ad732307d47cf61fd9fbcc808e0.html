 reduce budget deficits and curb inflation-these problems are still basical-
 ly unresolved:
 ? Investment continues to grow too rapidly.
 ? The 1983 budget deficit will be much higher than planned.
 ? Consumer prices continue to rise.
 Economic policy decisions-the most important of which are made by the
 Politburo-are often watered down and ambiguous. Policy options are
 limited by:
 ? The collective nature of high-level decisions.
 ? The state of political dynamics in the leadership.
 ? Preexisting economic policies-even those that have been publicly
 criticized.
 ? Identification of policies with individual leaders.
 ? Current definitions of ideological correctness.
 Policy implementation in the bureaucracy is undisciplined, in part because
 of ongoing economic management reforms. Interest groups beneath the
 Politburo level often have sufficient autonomy to make decisions that
 depart from central policy. We have identified six interest groups that play
 roles in the policymaking process and have at times blocked or delayed
 implementation of approved Politburo economic decisions: "superminis-
 tries" with broad regulatory functions; line economic ministries; local
 governments; the military; local enterprises; and government economists.
 We believe the leadership is frustrated by the inefficiency of the policy-
 making process, but cannot agree on how to improve the existing system.
 Beijing's desire for management reform is balanced by the need to ensure
 centralized planning and control of China's economy. The leadership has
 rejected-probably out of fear of losing political control-proposals of
 those economists who favor radical reform. Beijing also has resisted calls
 by party conservatives for a return to rigid, top-down management of the
 economy, because such an admission of the failure of economic reforms
 would reduce confidence in Deng's entire reform program.

 In our view, Beijing will continue searching for solutions to economic
 problems, experimenting with reforms that do not further decentralize
 decisionmaking, seeking to enhance administrative controls without de-
 stroying local initiative, and publicly criticizing the policy process without
 developing effective measures to improve it. We believe that this approach,
 while politically safe, will do little either to improve the policy process or to
 solve China's economic problems.

 China's Eight-Character Policy
 To stabilize the economy and put China on a path
 of balanced economic growth.
 To make economic management from top to
 bottom operate through material incentive sys-
 tems and, thereby, to make the economy operate
 more efficiently; to make economic actors respon-
 sible for their actions and to compensate individ-
 uals and organizations according to performance,
 not to egalitarian principles.
 To ensure that enterprises are managed by tech-
 nically competent and politically loyal individ-
 uals; furthermore, to correct lax discipline in
 enterprises throughout China by defining produc-
 tion tasks of employees at all levels.
 To raise productivity and overall management
 capabilities in the economy.
 In most of the 1952-78 period, growth was usually
 led by-and priority in resource distribution given
 to-the heavy industry sector; a concomitant devel-
 opment was high rates of investment. Readjustment
 is aimed at correcting these biases, allowing more
 resources to flow into agriculture, light industry, and
 consumption. More recently, as industry and as the
 investment-consumption relationship have come
 more into balance, the goals of readjustment have
 altered; currently, readjustment focuses on channel-
 ing resources toward sectors constraining long-term
 growth-energy, transport, and education.
 In agriculture, the former top-down decisionmaking
 structure has been weakened deliberately and land
 turned over to households, which now have much
 more control over what is planted. In industry,
 reforms have centered on allowing enterprises to
 retain a share of profits and to give them some
 latitude in spending retained earnings. In addition,
 enterprises now have more authority in production
 and marketing decisions.
 In this respect, consolidation complements manage-
 ment reform in industry. A consolidation program,
 with deadlines for enterprises to have reorganized
 along specific guidelines, is administered by the State
 Economic Commission.
 Most productivity indicators in China are below
 previous highs, and both reforms and consolidation
 also will help raise productivity. "Improvement" will
 be affected by educating individuals and by bringing
 in technology from abroad.

 The Economic Policy
 Process in China F_
 Since 1949 Chinese leaders have considered economic
 performance to be a key indicator of their success in
 governing. The watershed Third Plenum of 1978
 elevated this issue to top priority, putting political
 campaigns in second place. This paper discusses eco-
 nomic policy formulation and implementation, espe-
 cially critical issues today because Beijing has admit-
 ted publicly that devolution of decisionmaking
 authority is a chief cause of China's current economic
 problems.
 The death of Mao Zedong permitted a significant
 change in the direction of economic policy. Deng
 Xiaoping and "reformist" elements in the party and
 government pushed hard to change the rigid and
 ineffective Maoist approach to the economy. In mid-
 1979 the "eight character" guiding policy (see table 1)
 for the 1980s was framed. The two most important
 components of this policy are structural adjustment
 and systemic reform. Both prescribe fundamental
 changes in the management of the economy, in the
 interpretation of Marxist ideology, and in the way
 economic decisions are made.
 This paper describes the development of the economic
 decision making apparatus since 1978, using the 1980
 decision on economic retrenchment to illustrate the
 process. This particular decision set is chosen because:
 (1) it was a crucial decision at that time and a highly
 controversial one; (2) information about the decision is
 relatively plentiful, permitting a description of the
 steps in the policymaking process and the interest
 groups that took part in it; and (3) the decision
 remains highly salient, as the problems it addressed
 have persisted.
 The Uphill Road to Readjustment: 1978-81 '
 The Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee
 met in late 1978 and called a halt to the political
 campaign against Gang of Four followers set in train
 in August 1977. Instead, the party announced that the
 focus of work would turn to economic modernization,
 and that China would experiment with economic
 reforms. In March 1979 a Politburo meeting further
 clarified economic policy and approved the "eight-
 character policy," key elements of which were to
 moderate excessive heavy industry growth, reduce
 investment spending, and curb inflation. Three days
 after the Politburo decision, a People's Daily editorial
 made public the main thrust of the readjustment       25X1
 decision. The policy was presented to a Central
 Committee meeting in April and formally ratified by
 the National People's Congress (NPC) in June.
 Readjustment did not come easily, however, and the 25X1
 ensuing year and a half proved that lower level
 decisions and actions can work against Politburo
 decisions. The State Planning and Economic Commis-
 sions continued to promote relatively high investment
 rates, despite the fact that cutting investment was a
 primary goal of readjustment
 General economic performance worsened in 1980-as
 demonstrated by large budget deficits and serious
 inflation

 State Planning Commission), Kong Shien (head of the State Economic Commission),
 In a process similar to that in 1979, an early Decem-
 ber 1980 People's Daily editorial disclosed the general
 thrust of the readjustment program approved at the
 28 November Politburo meeting. The four important
 economic speeches at the Central Committee work
 conference were released to the party rank and file as

 Central Documents Nos. 1 and 2 of 1981 and were
 accompanied by further press editorials. Finally, in
 February 1981 the retrenchment program was made
 explicit in a public speech on the revised 1981 eco-
 nomic plan by the new head of the State Planning
 bureaucracy to the producing units.
 Economic decision making in China involves all levels
 of the party and state bureaucracies. All important
 policies are developed and approved by the Politburo
 and particularly its Standing Committee. Often, an
 editorial in the party newspaper will explain the broad
 outlines of the Politburo decision. A Central Commit-
 tee meeting sometimes formally endorses Politburo
 decisions on important policy questions. The decisions
 are passed down through layers of party and state
 bureaucracies in the form of numbered, normally
 classified, central documents. At the same time, the
 general character of such a document-usually not
 identified explicitly as such-often is publicized wide-
 ly in the press. Policy decisions are then often incorpo-
 rated in an economic plan document approved pro
 forma by the National People's Congress or its Stand-
 ing Committee, whereupon implementation details
 are passed down through the remaining layers of

 Figure 2: The "Readjustment Group"
 Usually included in the "readjustment group" are from left to right: Chen Yun (an
 authoritative economic leader rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution and newly
 reinstalled as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee), Zhao Ziyang (then
 First Secretary of Sichuan Province and soon to become Premier), Wan Li (then First
 Secretary of Anhui Province and soon to be elevated to Vice Premier), and Yao Yilin
 (an associate of Chen's from the 1950s who was soon to replace Yu Qiuli as State
 This is, of course, a great oversimplification of the
 process. A high-level policy choice does not work its
 way effortlessly down through a disciplined bureau-
 cracy to unimpeded implementation at the lowest
 administrative levels. The formulation and implemen-
 tation of economic policies are the result of a conflu-
 ence of separate decisions made by interest groups
 throughout the system: from Politburo decisions,
 through implementing choices made by ministries and
 local governments, down to specific decisions made by
 producers. Because each of these groups has a meas-
 ure of autonomy, the action that actually emerges at
 the end of the process frequently differs from the
 policy articulated at the beginning.
 We believe a number of political factors in the system
 limit policy options 3 at the top and influence the final
 policy choice:
 ? The state of political dynamics in the leadership
 may preclude selection of a particular policy. If the
 group of leaders backing a policy believes it cannot
 win support for that policy, it will not propose and
 lose but will criticize and seek to undermine alterna-
 tives.
 ' Other factors-such as information constraints and real resource
 constraints-also limit options, but discussion of these is beyond the
 scope of this paper.
 ? Preexisting economic policies restrict options. Al-
 though Beijing is adept at the redefinition required
 to make a new policy appear consistent with previ-
 ous policies, some continuity must be maintained to
 avoid bureaucratic confusion.
 ? Identification of policies with individual leaders
 promotes policy rigidity. A leader will resist a policy
 change-even if clearly needed-that could be
 viewed as discrediting his leadership. The collective
 will resist changing a failed policy to avoid having to
 affix blame for it. Conversely, a workable policy
 may be scrapped if the leader associated with it
 comes under attack for other reasons.
 ? The existing definition of ideological correctness
 may proscribe certain policy options or narrow the
 range of choices. Although the post-Mao leadership
 has demonstrated some flexibility in this regard, all
 policies must be defensible on ideological grounds.

 Secret
 As these factors suggest, there is a nonconfronta-
 tional, collective character to economic decision mak-
 ing in China. An important step in the decisionmak-
 ing process is the jockeying to win organizational
 allies and co-opt opponents on a particular issue.
 Understanding the tactics involved in this process-
 and we shall treat these at some length below-is key
 to understanding Chinese economic decision making.
 Finally, an important characteristic of the decision-
 making process is guanxi, or personal relationships.
 Although something comparable operates in every
 political system, personal relationships are critical in
 the Chinese system. In addition to formal channels for
 articulating policy preferences, individuals and groups
 exploit interpersonal relationships to influence deci-
 sions. A leader's guanxi very often determines the
 support he can mobilize behind his policy. The most
 effective administrators are those who have good
 connections up through the Politburo-to influence
 decisions-and down through the bureaucracy-to
 influence implementation. Not only is guanxi often
 the basis for advancement in a system that has not
 institutionalized performance-based promotions,
 but-in this nonmarket economy-guanxi between
 patrons and clients is a key element in resource
 allocation.
 Interest Groups: Roles and Responsibilities
 Six interest groups take part in the economic decision
 making process below the Politburo level:
 ? Superministries.
 ? Line ministries.
 ? Military establishment.
 ? Local governments.
 ? Enterprises.
 ? Think tanks.
 Each group has a distinct role and set of responsibil-
 ities in the policy formulation and implementation
 process. These are not, however, so clearly delineated
 that they remain static. Subsets of some of the groups,
 in fact, contend with one another for influence, often
 to affect resource allocation. This is especially true as
 we move further along in the decisionmaking process,
 toward implementation.
 Superministries
 China's State Council, the supreme government body,
 currently consists of the premier, four vice premiers,
 10 state councilors, and the heads of 45 ministry-level
 organizations. Of the latter, the State Planning Com-
 mission, the State Economic Commission, and the
 Ministry of Finance are the most important economic
 organizations. (Prior to its abolition in early 1982, the
 State Capital Construction Commission would have
 been included in this list of superministries.) These
 three superministries advise the State Council and the
 party on high-level policy issues, as well as initiate
 and pass midlevel policy recommendations to the
 State Council for its approval.
 The State Planning Commission (SPC) is the most
 important of the three: it is responsible for drawing up
 and coordinating economic plans-both annual and
 longer term plans. Among the 20-odd economic minis-
 tries in the State Council, the SPC has no direct
 bureaucratic control over the others, but its structure
 (see table 2) demonstrates the all-encompassing na-
 ture of its coordination role. The head of the SPC has
 typically been a vice premier of the State Council
 with correspondingly high party position." His promi-
 nence is underscored by his delivery of a highly
 publicized address on the economic plan at each
 year's NPC session
 The SPC, in addition to its functional structure at the
 central level, has bureaus in each provincial capital.
 Planning organizations at provincial and lower levels
 are directly subordinate to the SPC, but have their
 closest working relationships with the local govern-
 ment to which they are attached. Consequently, local
 planning commissions tend to become clientistic. Giv-
 en this structure and its responsibilities, we believe the
 SPC tends to favor relative centralization of decision-
 making authority and wants to have enough authority
 at its disposal to ensure that its decisions are carried
 out. The SPC tends to push ministries and provinces
 to perform beyond the limits they claim they can

 The State Economic Commission (SEC) is charged by
 the State Council with implementing and monitoring
 the annual economic plan. Through the year, the SEC
 convenes regular national meetings on economic per-
 formance, summarizing trends and providing guid-
 ance on problem areas that jeopardize fulfillment of
 the annual plan. Like the SPC, the SEC has branch
 organizations in every province. Prior to 1982 the
 SEC was responsible only for industry and communi-
 cations; in 1982 government reorganization added
 agriculture and investment to the SEC portfolio,
 significantly expanding its oversight authority (see
 table 2). The SEC works closely with the SPC, both in
 formulating annual plans and in overseeing imple-
 mentation. In some respects, the SEC is executive to
 the SPC's legislature, although many of their func-
 tions overlap. The two organizations, for example,
 share one foreign affairs office in their dealings with
 Heads of the SEC typically have held high govern-
 ment posts: Zhang Jingfu, the current chief, is a state

 vice-minister of the SEC and devotes his time to
 China's enterprise management reform program, an-
 other function of the SEC. The SEC's economic
 reform oversight function is interesting because the

 with the natural tendency of the SEC-like the

 and are the most important determinant of the alloca-
 tion of China's resources. The MOF works closely
 with the SPC in formulating economic plans and with
 the SEC in monitoring performance, but the SPC and
 MOF tend to disagree. Chinese fiscal policy is gener-
 ally conservative, and the MOF's preference for bal-
 anced or surplus budgets has often conflicted with the
 SPC's willingness to spend more to generate growth.
 Still, the SPC view generally will prevail because of
 its bureaucratic superiority over the MOF~
 The MOF chief in recent years has been of slightly
 lower political stature than the heads of the other two
 superministries, but the current head, Wang Bing-
 qian, is-like his two counterparts-a state councilor.
 Like the SEC and SPC, the MOF has a bureaucratic
 structure that extends down through local govern-
 ments.
 Beginning in 1980, fiscal reforms greatly increased
 provincial revenue but reduced the central govern-
 ment's ability to control fiscal affairs. In the 1980-82
 period it appeared that local government branches of
 the MOF were less responsive to the ministry than
 they were to provincial governments. We believe,
 therefore, that the MOF has joined the SPC and SEC
 in calling for greater centralization of economic policy
 making.
 Line Ministries
 The line economic ministries (see table 3) comprise
 20-odd economic ministries and commissions with
 much more specific interests than the SPC, SEC, and
 MOF. They are tasked with directing production of
 individual commodity lines or with some aspect of
 marketing that output. It is the coordination of the
 individual activities of the line ministries that makes
 up the work of the SPC and SEC; their finances are

 overseen by the MOF. As is the case with the
 superministries, each line ministry has provincial bu-
 reaus and subprovincial offices.
 A ministry's bureaucratic responsibilities are dual.
 One is to coordinate the activities of its subordinate
 local offices and to act as their representative in
 Beijing. Local offices, however, often are more inter-
 ested in local prerogatives than in carrying out line
 ministry directives. Thus, we believe organizational
 discipline is not strong. The second task is to oversee
 the activities of those factories that are "ministry
 managed," just as the ministry's local offices manage
 the remainder of the enterprises in that sector. Enter-
 prises under ministry management are typically the
 largest, though not always the most productive. The
 complexities of this bureaucratic structure make top-
 down control hard to maintain and obscure our view
 of actual paths of influence

 In addition to these oversight responsibilities, the
 ministry acts as spokesman for the entire sector in
 national policy and budget deliberations. Each minis-
 try seeks to influence general economic policy and the
 budget, to maximize resources allocated to its sector.8
 China's economic policies over the past 30 years have
 produced some predictable coalitions among the line
 ministries, and these coalitions are better able to
 influence deliberations on larger policy issues. China's
 pre-1978 predilection for a Stalinist development
 strategy favoring heavy industry naturally conferred
 influence on individuals in the steel, petroleum, ma-
 chine-building, and other producer goods production
 ministries. Leaders of some of these ministries-
 particularly petroleum-rose to higher positions in the
 superministries and the State Council, perpetuating
 policies that benefited their power bases. However,
 the 1981 retrenchment downplayed heavy industry
 and was accompanied by the demotion of some heavy
 industry proponents from the highest state and party

 Local Governments
 Each of China's 29 provinces, autonomous regions,
 and central municipalities is a bureaucratic micro-
 cosm of the central government (see table 4). Individ-
 ually larger than most nations, the provinces vary
 greatly in size, population, resources, agricultural and
 industrial productivity, infrastructure development,
 and reliance on central financial support. Traditional-
 ly, the provinces have been the key point at which
 national economic guidelines are translated into work-
 able policies for local implementation and have exer-
 cised considerable autonomy in economic policy mak-
 ing. Ever since the early 1950s there have been serious
 disagreements within the Communist Party over the
 degree of economic authority to be exercised by
 provincial governments. The argument persists to this
 day, with reformers (some of whom are former provin-
 cial leaders) arguing publicly that too much central

 resources.

 authority. In 1980 Beijing initiated it revenue-sharing program with
 the provinces that earmarked for provincial coffers all revenues
 from locally managed enterprises. At the same time, Beijing
 encouraged each province to "develop its comparative advantage."
 The provinces have made the most of these programs and have
 pushed local self-interest to a degree Beijing now finds unaccept-
 able. In 1981 and 1982 the central government had to borrow
 several billion yuan from provincial governments, and Beijing
 consequently reversed the revenue-sharing rules early this year

 each other for access to central funds. Some poorer
 provinces in the interior have their budgets subsidized
 by the central government, using revenues generated
 by other provinces. Nonsubsidized entities, such as
 Shanghai, have lobbied since 1978 for relief from the
 burden of supporting deficit provinces, according to
 diplomatic sources. Conversely, poorer provinces
 would not be likely, we believe, to actively support
 policies that channel more central resources into
 already developed provinces.
 Provincial government influence in economic policy
 deliberations depends in large measure on guanxi, or
 the personal relationships between local bureaucrats
 and their patrons in Beijing. Deng and his party
 reformers have seemed especially reliant on provincial
 support. We believe that a leader like Deng Xiaoping
 will use his support from provincial leaders to over-
 come resistance to his ideas by other Politburo lead-
 ers. To some extent, however, local expectations may
 exceed the actual influence the province has in Beij-
 ing.             speech to party cadre discusses
 complaints by Sichuan officials that Premier Zhao
 Ziyang, after leaving that province for Beijing, no
 longer "speaks the Sichuan dialect."
 In addition to having some control over local finances,
 Beijing has methods of guiding provincial economic
 decisions. One such device is Beijing's influence on
 local governments through the party apparatus. An-
 other is Beijing's decisions on economic infrastruc-
 ture: for example, Beijing can apply leverage on a
 province by threatening to divert energy resources
 elsewhere.
 Still, Beijing's need for the support of the local
 governments to carry out central policy gives the
 provinces a certain amount of leverage. A provincial
 government that takes immediate and effective steps
 to implement the spirit and letter of central directives
 will gain favor in the eyes of those in Beijing who
 initiated the policy.
 Military Establishment
 Although not concerned with day-to-day economic
 issues, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has an
 important place in the economic decision making
 process. China's military-industrial complex is exten-
 sive, with hundreds of thousands of workers in thou-
 sands of enterprises throughout the country. In the
 past few years, the PLA has received 15 to 20 percent
 of publicly announced budget funds (the actual figure
 is probably much higher). Moreover, several of the
 line ministries are primarily defense-related (most of
 the machine-building industries, for example) or have
 extensive production relationships with the military
 (such as the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry). The
 PLA's General Logistics Department also runs a large
 number of its own factories.
 In addition to these economic equities, the PLA has
 good guanxi in the Politburo, where much economic
 policy is made. Senior military officers constitute
 nearly one-third of the membership of the Politburo,
 and several are considered to have regular access to
 Deng Xiaoping. The PLA cannot, however, dictate
 economic policy, or even alter decisions in its own
 favor against strong opposition by economic leaders.
 For example, the military budget has been cut in
 three of the last four years, and although some senior
 officers have grumbled publicly, none have tried to
 reverse the decisions, as far as we know. However, the
 PLA does operate as a pressure group on economic
 policy questions, using its access, bureaucracy, and
 media to affect outcomes.
 Generally, the PLA leadership is interested in main-
 taining policy interest in-as well as state investment
 in-military modernization. Although most military
 officers subscribe to the need to subordinate military
 modernization to overall economic development, they
 are nonetheless anxious to make certain that the PLA
 gets its fair share of research and development funds,
 capital construction outlays, and Western technologi-
 cal know-how and equipment. The high command
 seems reconciled to the need to share military produc-
 tion skills, research facilities, and factory lines with
 civilian industry-and indeed military plants produce
 civilian goods-but it also seeks to ensure that dual
 use in no way reduces or deteriorates the productive
 capabilities of the military plants.
 Enterprises
 At the bottom of the economic hierarchy are China's
 enterprises, both urban and rural. Since 1978-and
 particularly since 1982-important organizational

 Secret
 changes have taken place in the countryside. "Produc-
 tion responsibility systems," as the rural management
 reforms are called, have turned effective control of a
 large part of China's farmland over to peasant house-
 holds." By 1982 China reported that 90 percent of
 peasant households were directly responsible for indi-
 vidually managing an assigned plot of land. The
 commune-brigade-team structure remains in place
 but is much less the dictatorial top-down management
 system it was prior to 1978. Commune reforms are
 continuing.
 China's nonagricultural enterprises number about
 400,000, divided mainly into state-owned enterprises
 and collective enterprises." The former are govern-
 ment owned and managed, while the latter nominally
 are managed by their workers. The practical distinc-
 tion is that state-sector enterprises remit most of their
 profits to the government, while most collective enter-
 prises pay taxes to the government and retain whatev-
 er is left as profit. Collective enterprises generally are
 responsible for making ends meet and pay their own
 investment costs from retained earnings; state enter-
 prise costs and investment are handled by the govern-
 ment.
 As noted earlier, state-owned enterprises are subordi-
 nate either to the central government or to provincial
 governments. Those under the central government
 answer to line ministries and-since the fiscal reforms
 of 1980-remit their earnings to the central budget.
 Enterprises managed by local governments are subor-
 dinate to functional bureaus-analogous to the line
 ministries-at the provincial level or below and con-
 tribute to local revenues.
 Economic management reforms since 1978 have given
 enterprise managers much more control over their
 own finances than at any time in the past 30 years.
 The volume of retained earnings has nearly doubled
 and now is equivalent to over half of annual consoli-
 dated state budget revenues. China's enterprises are
 by no means free agents-for example, the govern-
 ment sets most prices-but this increase in discretion-
 ary finances has strengthened their authority.
 China's enterprises have reacted to the devolution of
 authority-still primarily financial-as would be ex-
 pected of rational economic actors. Enterprise manag-
 ers seek to maximize the profits they retain and use
 these earnings to pay worker bonuses and construct
 new facilities. A major problem the government now
 faces is that China's legal and oversight structure is
 incomplete and enterprises can easily circumvent
 rules. Discipline through the system down to the
 enterprise level is so lax that government has found it
 nearly impossible to control local investment activity
 or impose fiscal restraint.
 Think Tanks: The Economists
 The government has encouraged the participation of
 intellectuals in China's search for answers to its
 economic problems. Economists across the country, in
 central government organizations and research insti-
 tutes, and in university economics departments have
 taken up the challenge to find solutions. The most
 influential economists are all rather old and steeped in
 the socialist economic theories of the 1950s, but they
 have responded enthusiastically to the regime's call.
 The State Council's Finance and Economic Commis-
 sion (founded in March 1979) set up four working
 groups to research and propose solutions to economic
 problems. Between July 1980 and July 1981, as an
 outgrowth of this initial research effort, four "eco-
 nomic research centers" were set up by the State
 Council. China's most prominent economists were
 brought in to run the centers. For example, the State
 Council Economic Research Center was headed by
 Xue Muqiao and Ma Hong and was charged with
 carrying out research on economic questions proposed
 by the Central Committee and the State Council,
 with keeping the party and government informed of
 important trends in the economy, and with coordinat-
 ing the efforts of other research organizations. Imme-
 diately after the December 1980 work conference on

 Secret
 readjustment, a forum was convened at which China's
 best known economists praised retrenchment. Al-
 though Beijing's decision to readjust the economy had
 already been made, the economists discussed the
 effects of readjustment and debated scenarios for
 economic development
 As a group, the think tank economists have more
 experience in theoretical debate than in actual man-
 agement. Some have few ideological compunctions
 about proposing nonsocialist solutions to economic
 problems. In 1979 and 1980, during the first relatively
 free economic debates in nearly 15 years, some econo-
 mists argued openly for radical changes in manage-
 ment that borrowed heavily from capitalist practice.
 The economists by and large have supported policies
 that the "readjustment group" proposed: cut invest-
 ment spending, improve living standards, expand light
 industry, and develop export markets. In fact, Xue
 Muqiao-a leading reform economist-was widely
 acknowledged to be Zhao Ziyang's personal adviser
 on economic questions after Zhao moved from Si-
 chuan to the central government in 1980. F_~
 China's economists enter the policymaking process in
 several ways. The most clear-cut influence they have
 on decisionmaking is through position papers they
 prepare at the behest of senior leaders. Economists
 also initiate policy proposals, although these will not
 go far unless they gain official sponsorship." Once a
 policy is decided, economists are called on by the
 government to publish essays in the media supporting
 the policy. During policy implementation, academic
 organizations convene meetings to debate the theoret-
 ical and practical considerations of the policy line.
 They differ from some of the other interest groups,
 however, in that they do not seek to maximize the
 amount of resources they get, but the amount of
 influence they can bring to bear on the system.F-
 11 A case in point is the policy proposals of the late Sun Yefang. Sun
 argued strongly in 1979-82 that enterprises not be permitted any
 authority to make new investment as they gained control over a
 portion of their profits. He stated that China's low depreciation rate
 should be raised, and that enterprises should be given authority to
 replace obsolete capital. Giving enterprises authority to conduct
 new investment would, according to Sun, lead to investment the
 government felt was low priority and that this, in time, would
 squeeze out high-priority government projects. Sun was proved
 correct, yet Beijing has moved only warily to recapture control over
 Policy Formulation and Implementation
 The interest groups discussed above fall into two
 broad categories: those that have a direct role in
 policy formulation and implementation and those that
 are primarily implementers. Beijing's attempts in
 1979 and 1980 to carry out a readjustment policy
 reveal much about the policy formulation and imple-
 mentation processes, and about how interest groups
 interact in these two processes. Particularly interest-
 ing are the reasons that the 1979 and the 1980 policy
 decisions were different in form and implementation.
 Policy Formulation
 On the surface, the 1979 and 1980 decisions to
 readjust were quite similar: the general call was for a
 cut in investment to permit improvements in living
 standards and for a reduction in the budget deficit to
 reduce inflationary pressures. In each case, the Polit-
 buro made a decision on readjustment that was
 ratified soon thereafter by a special meeting of the
 Central Committee. In both cases, the major leader
 behind readjustment-Chen Yun-addressed the Po-
 litburo and Central Committee on the need for read-
 justment, and he was backed up by Deng Xiaoping
 speeches supporting readjustment
 In fact, however, there were important differences in
 the details of the policies and in their actual economic
 effects. At the 1979 party meetings there was only a
 general call for readjustment, and targets for invest-
 ment and for steel production-the guidon for heavy
 industry-were lowered but by much less than the

 dustries for pursuing inappropriate policies."
 A third reason for the weaker policy in 1979 was that
 the "promotion group," whose members were the
 architects and supporters of the 10-year plan, was still
 in firm control of the SPC, SEC, and important
 ministries such as metallurgy and petroleum. As part
 of the effort in 1980 to push through a stronger
 retrenchment policy, the "readjustment group" was
 able to unseat the heads of the SPC and SEC and to
 discredit publicly the metallurgy and petroleum in-

 A second reason for the differences in the two policies
 was the all-important state of leadership dynamics. In

 Secret
 A fourth reason for the success of the 1980 policy
 outcome-one that ties in with some of the other
 points above-is that in 1980 the "readjustment
 group" was able to shape the debate in such a way
 that opponents were unable to argue effectively. Op-
 ponents of a strong readjustment had advanced the
 argument that the primary reason for the failure of
 the watered-down 1979 readjustment was that man-
 agement reforms-called for by Deng-had conflict-
 ed with readjustment goals. Deng countered that the
 main cause of China's economic problems was "left-
 ist"" views of economic managers, from central gov-
 ernment leaders on down through the ranks. The
 debate was confined to "leftism" and consequently
 the "promotion group" was blamed for the failure of
 readjustment
 Policy Implementation
 As we have noted earlier, China's economic policy
 implementation process cannot be viewed as a passive
 one wherein subordinate entities obediently carry out
 instructions from superior organizations. This has
 been particularly true since 1979, when Beijing began
 experimenting with systemic reform by devolving
 economic management authority not only to provin-
 cial governments but also to individual enterprises.F-
 From the standpoint of implementation, one impor-
 tant distinction between the 1979 and 1980 decisions
 was that readjustment opponents in 1979 took steps to
 block follow-on readjustment decisions
 the SPC and SEC allied with
 certain heavy-industry line ministries to prevent re-
 sources from going to light industry. Thus, the SPC
 and SEC not only can influence the policy formula-
 tion process through backers on the Politburo but also
 can affect implementation. By late 1980 the leader-
 ships of the SPC, SEC, and heavy-industry ministries
 were "readjusted" to ensure they would implement
 Politburo policy. The MOF-which had supported
 retrenchment but was unable in 1979-80 to hold the
 line on budget outlays-was strengthened in 1981 and
 successfully implemented a sharply reduced budget.
 economic growth through high investment and rapid growth of
 heavy industry, thereby ignoring improvements in consumption.
 The military establishment and the provinces contrib-
 uted to the unsuccessful implementation of both the
 1979 and the 1980 readjustment decisions. The mili-
 tary overspent its budget in 1979 and 1980, although
 this was attributed to the 1979 war with Vietnam.
 The provinces, meanwhile, took advantage of the
 revenue-sharing system initiated in 1980 and invested
 heavily in capital construction projects of marginal
 utility. Despite approval of a tougher readjustment
 policy, the military again overspent in 1981 and was
 itself responsible for nearly two-thirds of the deficit in
 what was to have been a balanced budget. The
 provinces continued to invest in low-priority projects,
 using funds over which Beijing had no control. The
 MOF reported that, although 1981 state budget
 investment was only slightly over target, investment
 outside the budget-including spending from provin-
 cial finances-overshot the plan by nearly 80 percent.
 The autonomy granted to China's enterprises in the
 post-1978 period has meant that, even when the
 "readjustment group" in late 1980 was able to gain
 Politburo approval and ministerial cooperation for a
 drastic retrenchment, enterprises were able to virtual-
 ly ignore the policy and pursue their own self-interest.
 Nonbudget investment rose in 1981, not only from
 retained enterprise earnings but also from bank loans
 to enterprises, and exceeded the plan by a wide
 margin in both cases.
 Consequently, the 1981. retrenchment was successful
 compared with the abortive effort of 1979-80, but
 implementation decisions by lower level interest
 groups still prevented as effective a program as the
 framers desired. The ability of interest groups to
 obstruct policy performance continues to this day.
 Beiljing's Search for a Decisionmaking Model
 As the foregoing suggests, although policymaking is
 the province of party leadership caucuses, policy
 effectiveness has been weakened by decisions made by
 certain interest groups in the economic bureaucracy.

 Secret
 This lack of discipline-or lack of control-in the
 system is, in our view, the most visible characteristic
 of the economic policy process. And it is a characteris-
 tic that has been of the greatest concern to the
 economic leadership for the past five years. F_~
 Beijing also seems to have difficulty in coordinating
 individual policies. The two policy initiatives of read-
 justment and reform often have conflicted with each
 other. Particularly, we believe the authority-dispers-
 ing effects of reform measures have undercut serious-
 ly the government's ability to achieve economic stabi-
 lization through readjustment. The incompatibility of
 readjustment and reform, already evident in 1980, has
 worsened in the ensuing three years. In fact, after
 relatively stable economic performance in 1981, the
 same problems that plagued the economy in 1979-80
 resurfaced in 1982 and persisted in 1983.'l
 The purpose of the systemic reforms Beijing initiated
 in 1979 is to improve the economic management
 process. The reformers believe that enterprise manag-
 ers should have more latitude to make decisions and
 should bear responsibility for errors as well as success.
 A major problem with the reforms has been that while
 authority has been decentralized, accountability has
 not. Beijing's dilemma is how to regain control over
 macroeconomic policy levers without seriously dam-
 aging the reform program.
 The political implications of the current situation are
 complex. We believe conservative opponents of eco-
 nomic management reform will point to the worsening
 economic situation and the inability of government to
 implement successful stabilization policies as evidence
 that the reform program has caused more problems
 than it solved. Opponents may also claim that decen-
 tralization of decisionmaking authority has led to an
 increase in corruption-so-called economic crimes. In
 our view, the recent campaign against "spiritual
 pollution"-aimed at eradicating "bourgeois" ideas in
 the party-is another manifestation of the struggle
 over reform in China
 " By stability, we mean lower investment rates, an improvement in
 the budget position, and a slowing in inflationary money creation.
 In 1983, investment growth is too rapid, the budget deficit promises
 to be the highest in three years, and money supply growth is at the
 fastest pace since 1980. Only severe measures in the final months of
 We believe Beijing has three broad options with
 respect to the economic decision making process in the
 coming years:
 ? At one extreme, Beijing could accelerate the reform    25X1
 process. This would require price reforms without
 which the reform package itself-the Chinese ad-
 mit-is doomed to failure. Beijing also would have
 to develop better macroeconomic control mecha-
 nisms in order to ensure some degree of control over
 the economy. This position has been cautiously
 advocated by some of the think tank economists.
 ? At the other, Beijing could abandon management
 reforms and concentrate central control on econom-
 ic stabilization. This would amount to a return to
 the top-down Stalinist model of management of
 1950s China. We believe that, despite five years of     25X1
 criticism of this model, it is still favored by some
 middle-level officials in some ministries, provinces,
 and the PLA.
 ? Between these two extremes, the regime could
 continue "groping"for solutions-as the Chinese
 say. This would mean a continuation of many of the
 reforms already initiated and successful, particular-
 ly those in agriculture. It also would mean a marked
 slowdown in the overall reform process and perhaps
 a recision of some reforms that have decentralized     25X1
 too far. We would expect that any new reform
 initiatives would focus on recentralizing economic
 decision making. At the same time, Beijing would
 have to continue issuing edicts aimed at correcting
 the unwanted side effects of reform that have
 undercut the stabilization effort.
 In our view, the first option is risky, because-in the
 absence of a carefully constructed reform program-
 rapid change could cause further confusion and un-
 dercut party and government control of macroeco-
 nomic policy, especially in the short to medium term.
 The second is unlikely, in our view, because manage-
 ment reform is an important political commitment of    25X1

 the current government. Abandoning it would almost
 certainly call into question the remainder of Deng's
 programs. Either of these options would significantly
 alter the policy process.
 The third option, we believe, is most likely, and this
 means that the convoluted process of policy formula-
 tion and implementation will remain essentially un-
 changed. And this option-politically the least risky
 from Beijing's standpoint-virtually ensures that
 Beijing's current problems controlling the economy
 will continue for the foreseeable future

 A Chronology of
 Readjustment Policy
 In February 1981 the National People's Congress
 (NPC) Standing Committee formally approved a
 drastic revision to the 1981 economic plan adopted by
 the full NPC the preceding September. This event
 was the capstone to events set in train at the Third
 Plenum in late 1978.
 Late 1978 to Mid-1980:
 An Abortive Attempt
 Following the Third Plenum of the 11th Central
 Committee in late 1978, a March 1979 Politburo
 meeting established a broad economic policy line for
 the ensuing years. The Third Plenum had reinstalled
 on the Politburo Standing Committee Chen Yun,
 China's economic crisis manager in the early 1960s
 during the recovery from the disastrous Great Leap
 Forward. According to Deng Xiaoping, speaking in
 late 1980, Chen was brought back to take charge of
 the nation's finance and economic work. This plenum
 also called for an end to political activity against
 Gang of Four followers and directed the country to
 turn its collective attention to economic tasks. At the
 1979 Politburo meeting, Chen Yun defined what the
 economic tasks for the coming few years would be and
 summarized them in the "eight-character policy":
 readjustment, reform, consolidation, and improve-
 ment. (Chen had coined a similar "eight-character
 policy" in the early 1960s containing readjustment as
 its primary element.)

 The major policy-setting address at the April 1979
 Central Committee conference was delivered by Li
 Xiannian, who outlined specific readjustment goals
 for the 1979-81 period (see inset). Readjustment was
 explicitly aimed at redressing sectoral imbalances in
 the economy and fostering balanced growth for the
 The "eight-character policy" was announced with
 fanfare at the June 1979 second Session of the fifth

 was not implemented to the satisfaction of Chen Yun.

 Chen's speech stressed that China had to plan for a

 basic conditions: the country is poor and backward,
 and many are hungry.
 ? Balanced economic growth will give us the fastest
 economic growth rate.

 Summary of Li Xiannian's 5 April 1979
 Central Committee Work Conference Speech
 Li's speech was considered by attendees to be the
 most important of the work conference speeches,
 because he laid out in detail the meaning of readjust-
 ment. The speech contained jive sections:
 ? Li described the economic situation at the time and
 explained why readjustment was necessary. He
 stated that relative priorities in the following areas
 had to be readjusted: agriculture versus industry,
 light versus heavy industry, electric power versus
 other industry, consumption versus accumulation.
 ? Li explained, as Chen Yun had in March, that
 China's basic conditions of poverty and backward-
 ness must be taken into account in the planning
 process.
 ? Li enumerated the following 12 principles of read-
 justment:
 - Develop agriculture as a priority.
 - Develop light industry and textiles.
 - Of the heavy industries, focus on electric power,
 transportation, and building materials.
 - Keep energy development apace with industry.
 - Reduce investment spending.
 - Import capital carefully and only according to
 needs.
 - Expand exports.
 - Slowly adjust domestic prices.
 - Gradually solve unemployment problems.
 - Control population growth.
 - Improve living standards.
 - Improve planning work.
 ? Li stressed the need to continue with enterprise
 consolidation, the program designed to upgrade
 factory management. In this way, China's enter-
 prises should be able to raise output and at the
 same time raise efficiency.
 ? Li addressed the second item in the eight-character-
 policy: reform. He said that the attitude toward
 reform must be positive, but that the reforms must
 proceed at a measured pace.
 high level of 1979. Yao's August 1980 NPC economic
 speech called for precisely the level that the SPC had
 proposed nearly a year earlier. Thus Yao, who had
 only recently assumed command of the SPC, did not
 revise its proposals before delivering the speech.
 During the August-September 1980 NPC, the Chi-
 nese press carried extensive coverage of remarks by
 NPC delegates on the state of the economy. Many of
 the remarks were critical of the government's conduct
 of the economy and called for a reduction in budget
 deficits, which were putting strong upward pressure
 on consumer prices. The deficits were linked, in many
 delegates' statements, with high spending on invest-
 ment. We believe that the Deng Xiaoping-led govern-
 ment would not have countenanced such a public
 display of displeasure with the government unless
 Deng intended to use this criticism as a. weapon
 against political opponents.
 Just preceding the public attacks at the NPC on the
 government's-and, at least implicitly, Yu Qiuli's-
 conduct of the economy, another member of the
 "promotion group" was publicly criticized by the
 government. Kang Shien, head of the State Economic
 Commission since March 1978, was accorded a "de-
 merit, first class" for the "Bohai 2 incident." The
 State Council, in handing down this punishment to

 Summary of Chen Yun's 16 December 1980
 Speech to the Central Committee Work Conference
 Chen's speech contained the following 14 points:
 ? China must use foreign capital, but must do so
 carefully.
 ? Although the current economic situation in China is
 not bad, the leadership must be aware of the
 problems, particularly inflation. If inflation is not
 controlled, living standards will be affected and
 may lead to political instability.
 ? The economic reforms have had many positive
 effects on the country, but they have brought un-
 wanted side effects, such as excessive investment
 spending.
 ? Although we continue to search for ways to allow
 rational economic principles to govern our actions,
 China is a planned economy and the government
 must have control over much of the economy.
 ? China must impose a price freeze for at least six
 months. To some people this seems like too much
 government intervention, but it is necessary.
 ? China must recentralize control over finances. Lo-
 cal governments must cut their expenditures and
 their fiscal surpluses must be turned over to the
 central government. The leadership will continue to
 look for ways to institute reforms, but reforms
 must be coordinated with the readjustment effort.
 ? Although the goal of socialist production is to
 improve living standards, China must raise stan-
 dards only when economic conditions permit.
 ? Imported capital projects must be carefully scruti-
 nized before China approves them. Experts should
 be involved in the process and all aspects of a
 problem considered.
 ? China must conserve foreign exchange. First, it
 must not allow so many delegations to go abroad.
 Second, it must ensure that Chinese exporters do
 not bid export prices down.
 ? Although China must encourage the production of
 nongrain crops, it should not allow this to reduce
 grain production.
 ? Because China's population is so large, it must be
 careful in examining the development models of
 other countries: they may not be applicable.
 ? In working toward the `four modernizations," Chi-
 na must exploit its current technology as much as
 possible. China will be able to learn from abroad,
 but there is a limit to this.
 ? The biggest problem in China's economic develop-
 ment over the past 30 years has been a 'lef'tist"
 orientation to economic work, and this has come
 from 'leftist" guidance from our leadership for all
 these years.
 ? Although there are certain aspects of readjustment
 that involve retrogression and a pulling back from
 some programs, China must do this because it will
 improve its performance in the future.

 Summary of Zhao Ziyang's 16 December 1980
 Speech at the Central Committee Work Conference
 Zhao's speech was the most important of the meeting
 and he laid out specifics of the readjustment program
 for 1981. The address was divided into five sections:
 ? First, Zhao detailed the reasons that a drastic
 retrenchment was necessary:
 Although the economic situation is good in
 many ways, there are `potential dangers" in the
 economy. Large budget deficits have forced
 excessive currency creation, which has led to
 inflation. This probably will result in political
 destabilization if not checked.
 - "Leftist" economic thinking still exists, and
 has resulted in overspending on investment.
 Consequently, after two years of readjustment,
 there is still no marked improvement in imbal-
 ances in the economy.
 - Each time readjustment has begun to take
 hold, there has been a turn for the better in the
 economy, followed by a resurgence of "leftism. "
 - In line with directive of the Politburo Standing
 Committee, there are three basic tasks: balance
 the budget, stabilize credit to control currency
 supply, and stabilize commodity prices.
 Between January and the late February convening of
 the 17th Standing Committee of the Fifth NPC, Yao
 Yilin's Planning Commission presumably put the
 finishing touches on the readjusted 1981 economic
 plan and state budget. Premier Zhao had already
 provided the specific guidelines for the alterations in
 his December work conference address, but the two
 - Zhao here detailed budget items that would be
 cut and stated how much the cuts would be.
 - Zhao also said that readjustment would last
 for the entire Sixth Five-Year Plan period
 (1981-85).
 ? Zhao hammered on the theme of centralization,
 stating that, as Deng Xiaoping had said, the only
 way to stabilize the economy was for the central
 government to recapture some of the authority it
 had decentralized. He also stated that the pace of
 economic reform would have to be slowed during
 the readjustment. Still, he said, some reforms that
 did not conflict with readjustment could be
 pursued.
 ? Zhao said that since the level of investment spend-
 ing was to be cut, China had to rely on efficiency
 improvements for growth for the coming few years.
 This would be accomplished by carrying out enter-
 prise consolidation (the third element of the eight-
 character policy).
 ? Finally, Zhao urged all Chinese to understand the
 current situation and the reasons that readjustment
 was required and exhorted everyone to pitch into
 the effort. He pointed out that the budget cuts
 would be severe, but that they were necessary.
 months were apparently necessary to permit the Plan-
 ning Commission to coordinate these changes with
 sectoral and provincial plans, most of which presum-
 ably required adjustments.
