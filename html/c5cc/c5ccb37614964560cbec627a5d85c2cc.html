 Resolution
 Policy
 The U.S. Senate on
 1 March 1967 adopted by a vote of 89-2
 Bill No. S-665 which was subsequently
 passed by the House of Representatives
 and signed by the President on 16 March.
 Public Law 90-5, as it is now known,
 authorizes supplemental appropriations
 for the Armed Forces and in effect dec-
 lares support by the duly elected rep-
 resentatives of the people of the Unit-
 ed States for the Administration:'s
 policies on Vietnam.
 The Amendment to the Bill proposed
 by Senator Mansfield (see unclassified
 attachment) was adopted by a 72-19 vote
 and is the first of its kind since the
 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964.  It
 can be cited as an indication of the
 basic unity of the American people in
 favor of our Government's policy on
 Vietnam, thus countering the overly
 ballyhooed statements and demonstrations
 of a highly vocal minority who protest
 against our combatting Communist aggres-
 sion in Southeast Asia.  It should be
 noted that this policy includes efforts
 to bring about an honorable negotiated
 settlement giving the South Vietnamese
 people the right of self-determination;
 note also that Congress supports the
 Geneva accords of 1954, and the use of
 a Geneva Conference approach today.

 Moscow-Peking Radio War Escalates.   With the introduction of the
 Soviet Union's new spring summer broadcasting schedule on 20 April,
 Mandarin-language transmissions to Communist China jumped sharply--
 from 84 hours to 182 hours weekly on a continuous, round-the-clock
 basis.  Radio Moscow's official schedule now totals 150/ hours, in-
 cluding 102 hours (unchanged) announced for Chinese listeners in South-
 east Asia but beamed also to Mainland China.  The remaining 312 hours
 are programmed by the "unofficial" Radio Peace and Progress which uses
 Radio Moscow transmitters and which added Mandarin programs to its
 multilanguage schedule on I March. Additionally, there are special
 broadcasts to China such as the recently expanded programs in Uighur
 from Tashkent.
 Radio Peking's normal schedule of broadcasts to the USSR in Russian
 totals 14 hours daily (98 hours weekly).  Unscheduled broadcasts are
 being added at such a pace, however, that transmissions (including
 simultaneous ones) are now topping 30 hours daily -- more than 210 hours
 weekly.  Thus, in terms of total time, Radio Peking is still ahead in
 the radio war.   It has also, on at least 3 occasions (March 22nd and
 23rd) added an apparently intentional but odd and unexplained twist --
 running its Russian-language tapes backward.  Radio Moscow please copy.
 More Censorship Between Communist Countries.   According to DER
 SPIEGEL,.leading West German weekly news magazine, the East German
 Government has imposed a virtual ban on Soviet films.  Whereas the
 East Zone was formerly flooded with Soviet films, only three recent ones
 will be shown. there.  The reason given by Party cultural officials is
 revealing:  they found that many recent Soviet films were too "liberal",
 specifically that they were too self-critical of "socialism", i.e.,
 Communism.  The Soviets for their part have banned the East German
 magazines BERLINER ILLUSTRIERTE (Berlin Illustrated) and FUER DICH
 (For You), the latter being a popular women's magazine.  The Soviet
 cultural authorities found that these publications of their satellite
 '?propagandized a socialist living standard which was far beyond the
 Soviet potential."  (Another instance of one Communist government's
 prohibition of a fellow satellite country's publications was noted in

 More on Communist Newspaper Circulation Shrinkage.  Despite lavish
 outlays for advertising and promotional gimmicks, and attempts to enliven
 thier contents, the major (and most of the minor) European Communist news-
 papers have steadily lost circulation during the oast 20 years, according
 to a short survey which appeared in the 10 April  issue of DER SPIEGEL,
 leading West German news weekly.  Last year the London DAILY WORKER, whose
 circulation had dwindled from 120,000 in 1946 to 60,000, changed its name
 to MORNING STAR in the hopes of adding at least 8,000 to its paid circula-
 tion.   (See ML, BPG #188, Il April  1966.)  However, its circulation
 (according to DER SPIEGEL) remains 60,000.  Evidence of the decline in
 popularity of European Communist newspapers since World War 11  is clear
 from the following statistics contained in the DER, SPIEGEL article:
 France's L'HUMANITE from 521,000 in October 1945 to about 200,000
 today;
 Italy's L'UNITA, from nearly 400,000 in 1946 to 350,000 in 1966
 (and another, perhaps more reliab,Io source estimated the 1965
 circulation as 150,000 weekdays and 200,000 on Sundays);
 Austria's VOLKSSTIMME from 100,000 in 1949 to 40,000 in 1966,;
 Holland's DE WAARHEID from 250,000 in 1946 to about 10,000 in 1966;
 Luxembourg's ZEITUNG VUM LETZEBURGER VOLLE.K from 7,000 in 1946 to
 2,000 in 1966;
 Norway's FRIHETEN from more than 15,000 in 1960 (and according to
 other sources, 131,000 immediately following World' War II) to
 2,500 in 1966; (We reported in ML, BPG #213, 10 April  1967, that
 FRIHETEN has folded due to low circulation and constant operat-
 ing deficits.)
 Denmark's LAND OG FOLK from 60,000 in 1946 to 6,600 in 1966;
 Switzerland's VOIX OUVRIERE and VORWARTS, from a combined total of
 55,000 in 1945 to about 12,000 in 1966.
 The Communist dailies have tried to reverse their downward circula-
 tion spirals.   In addition to changing its name, the British MORNING STAR
 increased the number of pages, and relegated the long speeches of Party
 functionaries to the back pages.  L'HUMANITE and L'UNITA, the two most
 important Communist dailies in Europe, went even further,  Both appeased
 their intellectual readers with brilliant supplements (feuilletons) and
 their simpler readers with detailed sports reporting.  L'UNITA also in-
 cludes photos of pin-up girls and provides comic strips (including
 American ones).  And following the example of PRAVDA, L'UNITA each year
 plays host at sports festivals, amateur plays, and exhibitions in which
 several ml'Ilion Italians participate.  L'HUMANITE annually sends out
 hundreds of thousands of admission tickets for a huge garden party.

 Nevertheless, this French CP daily organ breaks even only because it depends
 on Party volunteers both for its provincial correspondents and for much of
 its distribution (especially of its Sunday edition, which it uses 40,000
 volunteers to sell).
 (COMMENT: Above facts are very useful to deflate claims of the
 Communist press to represent the masses of the people, to denounce or to
 ridicule Communist inability to understand the interests of these masses,
 and to dissuade people from reading, or advertising in, Communist media.
 However, circulation losses alone do not necessarily reflect a weakening
 of the Communist parties or of their capability to commit further mischief--
 whether by forming "popular fronts", by promoting leftist trends among
 Social Democrats br by continued service as Moscow's fifth column.)

 ICM AND "SOCIALIST CAMP" AFFAIRS
 1.   The conference of European CPs on European security convenes in Karlovy
 Vim,   Czechoslovakia, as scheduled on April 24 -- and closes a day ahead of
 schedule on the 26th.   Although no overt evidence of conflict in the sessions
 is yet available, the results must be disappointing to the Soviet and other
 leading sponsors.  The important Rumanian and Yugoslav parties boycott the
 meeting, despite reported heavy pressure, especially on the Rumaians.   Also
 refusing to participate are the Albanians, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes, and
 Icelanders.   Key speaker Brezhnev criticizes Chinese obstructionism but
 reluctantly acknowledges that China is not on the agenda:   he also refrains
 from pushing for a world CP meeting.   Nevertheless, he reflects the continuing
 hardening of Moscow's general line, introducing a demand for the withdrawal
 of the 6th U.S. Fleet from the Mediterranean.   The resolutions are routine,
 Condemn U.S. "aggression in Vietnam," denounce West Germany and demand disso-
 lution of NATO.
 2.   The 7th Congress of the East German ruling party in Berlin on the eve of
 the above conference (April 17-22  is far "harder," anti-Chinese, and anti-
 West in tone.   Visiting delegations do not include top party bosses, with the
 conspicuous exceptions of Brezhnev and Gomulka.   China, Albania, and Cuba are
 not represented at all.
 3.   The series of bilateral meetings noted last month continues:   the Rumanians
 meet with the Bulgarians (A 17-21 , Czechs (13=14), Hungarians (13-14), and
 Italian boss Longo (5); the E. Germans with the Hungarians (March 29-30); and
 the Poles with the Bulgarians (A 3-6).   The latter produces a new friendship
 treaty less hostile to Bonn than those signed in March.
 4.   In addition to playing leading roles at the Karlovy Vary conference and
 the SED Congress as described above, Moscow holds two strangely ill-defined
 and seemingly overlapping international conferences of its own.   The first
 (March 28-31) is called a "Scientific Conference on the International Signi-
 ficance of the Great October Socialist Revolution," and has a claimed atten-
 dance by over 500 Marxists from 50 countries.   The second (April 12-15), a
 "Scientific Session on Leninism and Problems of the World Labor Movement,"
 simply has claimed  attendance by'Marxists from more than 50 countries."
 Participation at both seems to have been largely European, and both apparently
 were heavily critical of the Chinese.   It seems possible that they were used
 as cover for consultations on the forthcoming Karlovy Vary conference, -- and
 perhaps on prospects for a world meeting.
 5.   The Cubans are conspicuously absent from the Soviet-favored SED Congress
 and from the above Moscow meetings, and they lead a walk-out from the IUS
 Congress, as noted below.   Also, there is some downgrading in the wording

 of the Soviet May Day slogan on Cuba. Together with the hardly veiled criti-
 cism in Castro's March 13 speech, these events seem to give overt confirmation
 to classified reporting of increasing tensions between Castro and the Soviet
 leadership. (FYI only: there have been clandestine reports that Moscow did
 use the above "scientific conferences" to confer with Soviet-line Latin
 American CP leaders.   There is another report of a planned meeting of LA CPs
 in Havana in July, which might have been one subject for Moscow discussions.)
 6.   Tirana's Polish-language broadcasts in the name of a dissident "Provisional
 CC of the Polish CP" reach a new high in provocation with instructions to
 "comrades of the security organs and citizen's militia" for active struggle  ~~
 against "the Gomulkaite revisionists and their allied Zionist Israeli agency."
 (A 17)
 7.   Despite reports of a N. Vietnam-Chinese-Soviet agreement to expedite the
 delivery of Soviet aid to Hanoi (reportedly the N. Vietnamese will. take title
 to shipments as they pass the Sino-Soviet border), Chinese and Soviet media
 continue to attack each other heavily, as described below and detailed in
 our Chronology.
 INTERNATIONAL FRONT ORGANIZATIONS
 8.   Spared the disruption of Sino-Soviet battling -- by a Chinese-Albanian
 boycott -- the 9th Congress of the International Union cf Students (IUS) in
 Ulan Bator is nevertheless damaged by a Cuban-led walk-out of 9 Latin American
 delegations over another issue (March 26-April 10).
 9.   Our unclassified summary depicts a major new drive by the Maoist leader-
 ship to break the apparent stalemate of February-March by crushing the con-
 tinuing top-level Party opposition to their aim of carrying the CR "through
 to the end."  The Maoists' full forces -- the formal media as well as Red
 Guard activities     are concentrated in a heavy attack on Liu Shao-chi as the
 leader of this "bourgeois reactionary line" (throughout the entire 17' years of
 CCP control, it is now claimed), with the frank explanation that if he is
 brought down, "this will surely deal a fatal blow to the :handful."  The estab-
 lishment of a "Peking Municipal Revolutionary Committee" (at long last) is
 greeted by the Maoists as a great victory, but it appears to be a rather hollow
 otie.   Editorials still reveal major problems, there are new reports of clashes
 among the Maoists as well as against anti-Maoists, while the Army still
 appears to be the force holding the country together.   :Lin Piao allegedly
 appears before the public with Mao and Chou En-lai, after 5 months out of
 sight.

 WORLD COMMUNIST AFFAIRS
 CHRONOLOGY
 Continuing from preceding numbers:  The still-confused reporting on China
 is again treated in outline summa,
 A.  A new Maoist drive to overcome {opposition focuses on Liu Shao-chi.
 Evidently trying to break out of the near-stalemate of the last two months ---
 and implicitly acknowledging that opposition to the extremes of the "cultural
 revolution" is still active and wide-spread, the Maoist leadership at the
 end of March threw the regime's political and propaganda resources into an
 all-out drive against Liu, as descr.bed by the (edited) introductory para-
 graphs to the April 8 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial:
 "A great new campaign has started.... Hundreds of millions of
 revolutionary masses in China ... have launched a powerful general
 offensive against the number one party person in authority taking the
 capitalist road.... During the past L7,yi~ars, an acute and complicated struggle has
 been going on within the party between the proletarian revolutionary
 line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line
 represented by the number one party person.... Working hand and glove
 with another such top party person... it was precisely this China's
 Krushchev who patronized and shielded a handful of party persons in
 authority taking the capitalist road and a handful of bourgeois re-
 actionary academic 'authorities'....
 If we criticize penetratingly, repudiate thoroughly, and dis-
 credit completely the number one.... this will certainly deal a fatal
 blow to the handful...."
 Noteworthy steps in this new campaign include:
 (1)   The opening salvo consists of several signed articles in RED
 FLAG No. 5, broadcast by Peking on March 30-31.  Most detailed is a very
 long, twisted account by Chi Pen--yu, "Patriotism or National Betrayal --
 Comment on the Reactionary Film 'Inside Story of the Ching Court.'"  It
 goes back to 1950, when the subject film (on the Boxer Rebellion), being
 shown in China, moved '"the proletarian revolutionaries headed by Chairman
 Mao to wage a serious struggle against a handful of party people in author-
 ity taking the capitalist road.  This was the first important struggle
 launched in liberated China on the cultural and ideological front.
 Arrayed against Mao were ''counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Lu
 Ting-yi, Chou Yang, and a certain Mr. Hu,...as well as the biggest power-
 holder within the party.. .who was backing them. behind the scenes.`"  Support-
 i   Mao was wife Chiang Ching, .,a member of the motion picture guidance
 committee of the Ministry of Culture.    Foiled in his efforts to ban the
 film, Mao on 16 October 1954 ' addressed a letter to the Politburo on the
 subject, but to no avail.  "Twelve years have elapsed since 1954, but the
 reactionary, totally traitorous film. . .has so far not been repudiated....

 "Their crimes of openly and boldly opposing Chairman Mao's thought must
 be thoroughly investigated.  The revolutionary masses must bring down this
 handful... and drag the biggest powerholder ... down from his high horse....
 Chi Pen-yu's article attacks Liu's well-known book, HOW TO BE A GOOD
 COMMUNIST (also rendered as ON SELF-CULTIVATION), for many years required
 reading for Chinese Communists, as "your absurd thesis, the big poison weed
 which repudiated revolution, class struggle, seizure of political power, and
 the proletarian dictatorship, opposed M-L and Mao Tse-tung's thought, and
 promoted the antiquated bourgeois world outlook and the reactionary philosophy
 of bourgeois idealism...."
 (NCNA on April 7 announces that this 20,000-word article is to be
 distributed in booklet form beginning April 8.)
 (2)  Beginning April 1, Peking is plastered with new posters and swarming
 with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators against Liu, his book, and others
 of the "handful" identified with him.  Vice Premier and Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi is continuously attacked by posters beginning April 2.  On April 13
 Toronto GLOBE AND MAIL correspondent Oancia describes a rally of 200,000
 at which such prominent persons as Peng Chen, Po Yi-po. and Lu Ting-yi were
 dragged out on the platform for public humiliation.  On the 17th, Oancia
 reports that truckloads of people from other areas are arriving in Peking
 "in much the same manner as did thousands of Red Guards"last summer and
 are being accommodated in the same buildings.
 (3)  Posters appearing on the 17th give lengthy details of a coup d'etat
 against Mao planned by Liu and Teng for February 1966 but discovered in
 time by Mao.  Named as co-plotters are Peng Chen, Lo Jui-ching, Lu Ting-yi.
 and Yang Shang-tun.  They charge that Peng was sent to Moscow to make con-
 tact with the Soviet revisionists during the last CPSU Congress.  The pos-
 ters are signed by a "revolutionary group of employees of the Peking Party
 Committee."
 (4)  A full-length color documentary film on the 17th anniversary of the
 founding of the CPR (last October 1) makes its first appearance -_. with
 Liu, Teng, and other attacked leaders cut out of the picture after a
 struggle described by NCNA:
 "In producing the film, a handful of party people ... abused their
 power in order to prettify the top party person ... and the bourgeois
 reacionary line.  The did this in a wild attempt to belittle the great
 image of our most respected and beloved great leader   airman Mao.
 But their scheme came to nothing, because the prol. revs. promptly
 rose in rebellion and seized the power of editing and producing this
 film from them...."
 B.  A "Municipal Revolutionary Committee" for Peking.  After months of in-
 formal government by public security and military forces, the formation of
 a Peking Municipal Revolutionary Committee,"a provisional organ," is announced
 at a mass rally on April 20.  It is acclaimed by PEOPLE'S DAILY as "a

 new song of triumph for Mao Tse-tung's thought" and depicted as a "three-
 way alliance," with the standing members of the Committee including 20
 representatives of the revolutionary masses,"  6 military, and 6 '' og vern---
 ment cadres."  It is headed by Publjc Security Minister Hsieh Fu-chip  and
 two of the four vice chairman are ranking officers of the Peking garrison
 command, leading to such comment as',that in the NYTIMES from Hong Kong,
 April 20:  "Students of Chinese affairs said today that the formation of the
 rev. committee in Peking did not appear significantly to change the power
 structure in the Chinese capital."
 C.  Miscellaneous notes:
 --Lin Piao is reported making his first appearances since November:  on
 April 19 NCITA reports that "Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Piao, and Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai had a very cordial and friendly conversation" with the
 Ambassador of N. Vietnam; and on the 24th that the same three, plus Chen
 Po-ta, Kang Sheng, Li Fu-chun, and Chiang Ching, met in Peking with "lead-
 ers of provincial and municipal revolutionary committees."  A heavily
 re-touched picture is published of Mao and Lin at the ballet.
 --Despite the  continuing attacks on Chen Yi, he still appears as Foreign
 Minister at a Syrian national day reception on April l7.
 --On April 10, the Chinese Foreign Ministry orders long-time Yugoslav
 TANYUG Peking correspondent to leave the country for "false and slanderous"
 reporting on the CR.
 --We have seen no further published evidence of epidemic and food crises, --
 which does not necessarily mean that the situation has improved.
 --The Chinese champions are absent from the 29th World Table Tennis Tourna-
 ment in Stockholm, and AFP Peking correspondent Vincent reports on April 16
 that, according to the Red Guard journal of the Peking Sports Institute, the
 Govt Sports Commission decided after several days of stormy debate to send
 no further athletic delegations abroad for the time being.
 March 23 (delayed) and April 2:  Japanese CP daily AKAHATA further reflects
 strife between JCP personnel and the Chico_ms and their sympathizers in Japan.
 March 23, it carries a "resolute protest' ` by the JCP/CC against the Overseas
 Chinese Merchants Association in Tokyo:  the latter have been hanging banners
 from their building "'branding the JCP as a terroristic, violent and criminal
 organization," an "unpardonable slander," -- and then 20 of the Chinese beat
 up a delegation of four JCP representatives who went on March 22 to deliver
 a protest letter!  On April 2, A carries a lengthy round-up of "slanderous
 attacks on JCP members in Peking."
 March 26 (delayed):  IZVESTIYA carries a long article, "The Peking Farce,"
 by `political observer and professor of the Tokyo Meiji University, Hiro-
 tatsu Fujiwara,"who apparently spent some time in China.  He draws a parallel
 between a slogan current in Japan 100 years ago --- "sonnodzyei," meaning
 respect the emperor and drive foreigners away" V--- and the present situation

 in China, where one need only substitute the word "Mao" for "emperor."'
 ''What did 'sonnodzyei' bring to Japan?  It became the theoretical
 base for nationalism and chauvinism, and ultimately led Japan into a
 world war ending in bitter defeat.  I remember `Marx said:   'A tragedy,
 should it be repeated by history, will be a farce.?  Are we not present
 witnesses of such a farce?...
 ..We noticed everywhere indications that the Mao grouwas trying
 to replace hatred against the U.S. with hatred against-'the Soviet
 people.
 I do not believe that the Mao group will venture as far as a
 direct clash with the USSR, will attempt to force Maoism upon the S.U.
 That would be absurd.  But the Chinese leaders must realize that systema-
 tic Chinese border provocation by itself aggravates the situation in
 Asia, which is tense as it is....
 When  I saw present--day China, I remembered Japan again and again.
 Only recently our home-bred militarists asserted:   'We are isolated
 from the world by the line of A, B, C, and H (America, Britain, China,
 and Holland).'  They attacked Hawaii to break this line.  Does the
 Mao group want to follow such a path in eliminating its international
 isolation?  Is it not necessary to come to one's senses and to try
 other ways of acquiring friends -- friends more important than Albania?''
 March 26--April 10:  The International Union of Students (IUS) holds its
 9th Congress in Ulan Bator, ,Mongolia.  Although a boycott by the Chinese and
 Albanians saves the Congress from Sino--Soviet battling, it is torn  by a new
 issue which brings a walk-out of 9 Latin American delegations headed by Cuba.
 The new dissent concerns reports of CIA relations with the non--Communist
 International Student Conference (ISC) -.?- with which the Soviets have been
 urging cooperation -- and the walk-out comes when the Congress rejects a
 Cuban motion to expel the Chilean UFUCH which belongs to both, and which has
 been Cuba's principal rival for leadership of the Latina.
 March 28-31:  Moscow hosts a "Scientific Conference on the International
 Significance of the Great October Socialist Revolution,"" claiming attendance
 by `'over 500 prominent representatives of the Communist and workers move-
 ment, expert Marxists from 50 countries of Europe, America, Asia, and Africa.''
 Brief press reporting indicates that participation is largely European, with
 no mention  of Cuban, N. Korean, Chinese, or Japanese delegates, though the
 N. Vietnamese gets heavy play.  The discussions are apparently full of
 ideological attacks on the Chinese.  Opening and closing speeches are by
 USSR Academy of Sciences Vice President Fedoseyev, author of a mayor doctrinal
 article, `'Marxism and Mao Tee--tungism," in _OI8NNIST No. 5, signed to press
 the day before the conference opens.
 March 29:.  IZVESTIYA article by V. Matveyev,  In League with Whorn?" -- pegged
 to PEOPLE'S DAILY on Vietnam February 20 -- says:

 that this, allegedly, is in the interests of the Vietnamese people.  In
 conformance with the 'teaching of Mao Tse-tung,' bloodshed is represent-
 ed as 'the highest virtue.
 TASS reports on the March 27-29 visit in Moscow of Italian CP Gen Secy
 Longo, who met with Brezhnev and otAer CPSTJ officials.  They "attach great
 significance to the coming conference of fraternal European parties," support
 participation by all, and very conditionally endorse a new international
 conference.
 March 29 and continuing_: _   Chinese Indonesian strife escalates in tempo and
 temper.  Highlights during this period include:
 -=-A long April 10 NCNA round-up of Chinese charges, beginning:  "The Suharto-
 Nasution rightwing military clique, lackey of U.S. imperialism in I., which
 usurped presidential power and has nakedly shown the fascist features of its
 military regime, is stepping up its collusion with and dependence upon the
 U.S. imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionist leading clique to under-
 take new and unprecedented anti-China and anti-Chinese moves in all parts
 of I....
 -Next day NCNA reports "strongest protest" notes to I. in Peking and
 Djakarta against the "bloody persecution of Chinese nationals by the local
 authorities of Situbondo, Fast Java, where one Chinese was killed, two
 seriously wounded, and others "cruelly beaten up and then thrown into prison.
 "The Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate the savage atrocity of
 murder of their compatriots.  Blood debts must be paid in blood.
 M---Radio Djakarta on the 19th reports an I. Foreign Dept protest against a
 siege of the I. Embassy in Peking on April 12 by "hundreds of youths` who
 pasted insulting placards and blockaded staff personnel from leaving the
 building.
 --?-NCNA on the 21st reports that "the I. reactionary authorities yesterday
 mobilized. large numbers of armed forces, police and gangsters to attack the
 funeral procession held by Chinese nationals for murdered Overseas Chinese
 leader Nin Hsiang.-yu," wounding '`more than 10 Chinese nationals. PNCNA says
 that it was "a mammoth procession of 30,000,' and that they -'recited Chair-
 man Mao's quotations amid whistling shots, shouted slogans, and marched
 bravely."  The Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged "the strongest protest
 against the outrage.
 *See insert, p. 12.
 --NCNA on the 22nd reports a Chinese F4 "strongest protest" over a siege
 of the C. Embassy in Djakarta.  On the 23rd, it is a "most urgent and
 strongest protest" against the blockade and the "abduction by force of

 March. 30:  An editorial in N. Vietnamese Party daily FHAN DAN on prepara?,
 tions for the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution includes its usual.
 ``equal time'' bow to China:  "Following the Russian October Revolution, the
 great Chinese Revolution ended in a brilliant victory,...the event of great-
 est significance since the 0. Rev."
 March 30 and continuing...  Chinese media continue to hit at Soviet-U.S.
 collusion  in at least a dozen articles during this period.  On the 19th,
 1t FIT rresents a round-up of Soviet-aU.S. relations with India, Japan, Indo-
 nesia, and Malaysia in their joint efforts ''to patch up a counter--revolution-
 ary 'holy alliance' and an anti-China 'ring' in Asia.'  PEOPLE'S DAILY on
 the same subject next day begins:   The Soviet revisionist rulinc clique has
 of late been flirting most outrageously with various puppets and pawns, both
 big and small, of U.S. imperialism in Asia and is engaged in affairs will all
 those that are willing," while the U.S. ''winks approvingly.   The secret is
 allegedly revealed by a U.S.  Senate  fact-finding' mission which went to
 Asia and concluded that the U.S. should  involve the S.U. in joint efforts
 to develop and stabilize Asia rather than trying to curb Moscow's influence
 on the continent."  New as ects of Sov U.S.collaboration condenmed duril'r
 this period include:  the  .S. "Industrial Design'' exhibit warmly welcomed
 in Moscow (March 30)  the Soviet bid_ to furnish turbines for the Grand
 Coulee Dam (April 18) - and the sale to Dow Chemical Co. of the "rare strategic
 material`' ma.nesium (April 18).
 March 31:  PRAVDA commentator Zhukov, referring to joint statement in Peking
 signed by Japanese Foreign Trade Association, says:
 ``The leaders of China, who are undermining the edifice of the unit-
 ed anti imperialist front in defense of Vietnam..., are not sparing any
 efforts to establish relations with various kinds of monopolistic
 circles....The desire of the Chinese leaders to-make the, Japanese
 capitaliststheir allies in the anti-Soviet campaign-is all the more
 odd if one recalls the close links between the J. monopolies and the
 Saigon regime... .This odd political triangle, with its corners in
 Tokyo and Peking...(and) its apex in Saigon-causes one to wonder
 where and what kind of friends are the present Peking leaders seeking?"
 IZVESTIYA returns to the subject on April 14.
 April 1:  PEOPLE'S DAILY article by the Red Guards of Tsinhua Univ. "gives
 the lie to the fallacy spread by TASS that they detained a car with Soviet
 diplomats'' on March 26 (#12).  Giving its version of the incident, it adds:
 Gone are the days when imperialists could do as they liked and
 swagger about on Chinese territory.  What are Soviet revisionist
 diplomats dreaming about when they attempt to put on the superior airs
 of latter-day imperialists in front of the Chinese people today?''
 April 1 and continuing   Soviet media continue to hammer at Chinese  erecu_-
 tion of minorities.                          IZVETIYA article by A. Dymkov on April 1 asserts that

 "forcibly Sinicize the people of Sinkiang.''
 April 2 and continuing   Soviet media hit somewhat less frequently on the
 theme of Chinese?U.S. collusion, but Radio Moscow on April 2 introduces a
 new angle, claiming that the designer of Chinese missles "held. a key post
 in this field in the U.S. until recently. The administration then allowed
 him to go to China.  A moving situation:  the paper tiger helps his enemy
 create nuclear weapons carriers!`'  The Czechs take up the cry of Chinese-
 U.S. collusion in a RUDE PRAVO commentary on "the seamy side of (China's)

 1122.                 SOVIETS EXPOSE CHICOM MINORITY
 POLICIES IN SINKIANG
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  (UNCLASSIFIED)  During the period of Sino-Soviet con-
 troversy before the fall of Khrushchev, one of the main bones of propa-
 ganda contention between Moscow and Peking was the historic claim of
 China to vas'ious Asian territories taken over by the Tsars and now ruled
 by the USSR.  In the more recent period of Sino-Soviet tension which has
 accompanied the Cultural Revolution, relatively little overt attention
 has been given to territorial questions.
 In May 1966, Foreign Minister Chen Yi told Scandinavian news-
 men that the Russians were thieves who had annexed 1.5 million
 square kilometers of Chinese territory -- not only in the 19th
 century, but since (see below).   On the other hand, a Soviet
 archaeologist announced in a radio talk in December 1966 that
 excavations in the Amur basin proved an ancient culture had existed
 there, free of Chinese influence; this was of course meant as a
 refutation of Chinese claims to have inhabited these territories
 from the earliest times.   This is however slight treatment compared
 with the polemics on the territorial question in the past.  In
 fact, the Soviets have shown considerable sensitivity to Western
 reports that the territorial question has been revived.
 There can be no doubt, nevertheless, that the Soviet leadership
 is very conscious of the existence of the Chinese claims, and of
 their potential future significance.   China's population is believed
 to have increased from approximately 600 million to approximately
 750 million in the last lL years (no reliable census data exist).
 The Soviet population was estimated in 1966 to be 232 million.
 The USSR is the largest country in the world in land area  22.4
 million square kilometers or 8.65 million square miles), and its
 least populous areas are those in the East, north of China.   The
 Soviet lands claimed by China have at'present a population of about
 6 million.
 Even aside from the annexations of the Tsars, which include
 the territories northeast of Manchuria, and lands in Central Asia,
 the Chinese have serious territorial grievances against the Soviets.

 Mongolia was annexed as recently as 1944; this is the Tu.va Autono-
 mous Soviet Socialist Republic, formerly known as Tannu Tuva.   The
 Mongolian People's Republic itself was officially a Chinese province
 (Outer Mongolia) from 1686 to 1911, though Soviet influence is now
 dominant there.   In the 1930's and prior to the end of World War II,
 Soviet influence prevailed in Sinkiang, in Western China.   In the
 later period, around 1944-45, the Soviets were allied with Moslem
 rebels opposing Chinese authority.  With Soviet weapons and air-
 craft, the rebels at one time set up an "East Turkestan Republic,"
 though later, in the 1950's, the Soviets seemed to have conceded the
 area to China.
 The striking development in current polemics --- at least in regard
 to the Sino-Soviet border -- has been a Soviet propaganda campaign on
 the mistreatment of minorities in China, especially the Moslem minority
 in Sinkiang.   Broadcasts from Tashkent in Uighur (the principal language
 of Sinkiang Moslems) beamed specifically at Sinkiang have been doubled
 since January 1st.   Aside from glowing descriptions of conditions in
 the USSR and statements of solidarity with the people of Vietnam, these
 programs carry reports of attacks by Western Communists on Mao and accu-
 sations that the Maoist leadership is disloyal to the Chinese people.
 (This type of broadcast is also a staple of "Radio Peace and Progress,"
 Moscow's "unofficial" radio which added broadcasts in Mandarin to China
 to its regular programs on 1 March 1967.)  Moreover, the Uighur broad-
 casts issue reports of minority resistance to the Cultural Revolution;
 on 28 January, for example, a Soviet broadcast told of bloody clashes
 in Sinkiang resulting in over a hundred deaths and claimed that the
 Uighurs' and Kazakhs, "the real inhabitants of Sinkiang, "had long been
 persecuted by the Peking government.   On 13 February, a refugee from
 Sinkiang compared Maoist oppression with the delights of life in the
 Soviet Union, and on 23 February another refugee, now a member of the
 Kazakh Academy of Sciences, condemned Chicom repression of minorities in
 Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Sinkiang.
 Moscow has also spread propaganda on Chinese minorities to its own
 people and to audiences, especially Moslem ones, elsewhere.   On 25 Jan-
 uary, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA carried an extensive article, largely made
 up of alleged eyewitness reports.   (See attachment)  A commentary in
 IZVESTIYA on 1 April, by Aleksandr Dymkov, asserted that "the Maoists
 have proclaimed the assimilation of non-Han peoples to be their aim."
 Broadcasts to Arabs in Arabic, to Africa in English,-to Cuba in. Spanish,
 to Finland in Finnish, to Albania in Albanian (the Albanians are two-thirds
 Moslem),     and even to China in Mandarin ("Radio Peace and Progress")
 have reported minority resistance or attacked-Mao's treatment of minority
 religions and nationalities.   On 5 April, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA (in an
 item reported by TASS  International Service in English) asserted:

 It   . it is not Communism that interests the Peking dictator.  He
 is. thinking of quite different things:   for him, Communist ideas
 are merely a cover  for a plan for the establishment under his hege-
 mony of something like a new racialist Reich in Asia and even
 beyond it."
 This last quotation further points up a theme which is often stated
 or implied.   This is that, with their enormous population, the Han
 (ethnic) Chinese are in a position to submerge national minorities with
 a flood of immigrants, leaving the minorities a mere splinter, progres-
 sively assimiliated by the Chinese hordes.  Soviet (and Indian) reports
 on Tibet and Sinkiang claim that indigenous women are forced to marry
 Chinese males; their children will be raised as Chinese.   In Sinkiang,
 the population (according to Western estimate) has been doubled by an
 estimated 3 million immigrants from Eastern China.   Settlement reportedly
 began in 1950 when an estimated 20,000 Chinese troops stationed in Sinkiang
 volunteered to stay.  Campaigns are conducted to recruit intellectual
 youth to "Go West," similar in some respects to Khrushchev's and
 Shelepin's'Virgin Land settlement campaigns in the 1950's -- one aim of
 which may also have been to make Kazakhstan more securely Soviet.  The
 Sinkiang-Uighur Autonomous Region capital, Urumchi, is now reported to
 have, become largely a Chinese city.   Some of the scientific  weapons
 projects conducted in Northewest China have also brought an influx of
 Chinese -- while possibly increasing Soviet interest in the area.
 Reports of Chinese broadcasts tend if anything to confirm the Soviet
 accusations.  While the Chinese have lately accused the Indians of
 stirring up the Tibetans to revolt, they have made no direct replies to
 the Soviet propaganda on minorities.  Maoist  broadcasts from Urumchi
 are in Mandarin and are obviously aimed at Chinese settlers; they refer
 scathingly to "local nationalist elements," to "remnants of feudalism,"
 or to "monsters and freaks in society" -- if they refer to the minorities
 at all.
 Obviously there has been a very unstable situation in Sinkiang in
 recent months.  A Peking wall newspaper stated on 31 January that there
 was to be "an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of armed troops" and
 that "the masses are not allowed to fire on the reactionary organizations."
 It seems highly probable that minority groups have participated in the
 revolt, and they certainly have been encouraged by propaganda from the
 USSR, if not in more material ways as well.   It has been reported (by
 Agence France Presse) that on 27 January Mao ordered that "the state of
 preparedness for war should be consolidated" in areas bordering on the
 USSR, and (by Prague radio) that on 5 February Chen Yi declared that war
 with the USSR was possible.   Prague radio has reported that, at the behest
 of the CCP Central Committee, the Chinese Army took over radio and press
 in Urumchi in order to limit strife arising from the Cultural Revolution
 and normalize the situation.   Unfortunately, it is difficult to get reports
 from reliable and disinterested sources on any area in China, and parti-
 cularly on Sinkiang.

 While immersion (forcible assimilation) policies are only partly
 executed in Sinkiang and Tibet, the pattern in Inner Mongolia shows
 what is in store.   There nomadic Buddhist Mongols :Lived until recently
 as they did under the great Khans.   The Chinese have tried to make polit-
 ical profit out of pan-Mongolism, currying favor with Mongols both, in
 Inner Monglia and in the Mongolian People's Republic by honoring Genghis
 Khan, a figure whom the Soviets are forced by their whole tradition
 to oppose.   But Han colonization in Inner Mongolia has taken place to
 such a degree that the Inner Mongolians, still one third of the popula-
 tion in 1950, are now outnumbered there by about 10 to 1, and it is this
 above all which keeps: the MPR firmly aligned on the Soviet side.
 Manchuria, now the Ruhr of China and a firmly Han area with some 40
 million inhabitants, was closed to Chinese settlement until .1878; in
 staging the Mukden incident in 1931 and establishing a puppet state in
 1932, the Japanese were, among other things, trying to put a stop to
 the progressive Sinification of the area.   It has been said that China's
 real secret weapon is its population.   (End UNCLASSIFIED)
 It is hard to fathom Soviet :intentions in their propaganda campaign.
 Possibly one aim has been to bring pressure on Peking to cease other
 complaints by reminding the Chicoms that under present conditions, the
 USSR has a military capability to annex Sinkiang and other Chinese border
 areas.  But Soviet propaganda also seems to reflect a genuine Soviet
 concern over the long-term prospects for underpopulated territories near
 China.. Such concerns could well be shared. by other nations bordering
 on or near to the CPR.

 1123.      MOSCOW-CONTROLLED INTERNATIONAL STUDENT CONGRESS
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  The International Union of Students (IUS) held its 9th
 Congress March 26 - April 6, in Ulan Bator, Mongolia.  Although the
 meeting attracted over 80 national unions of students and generally in the
 last analysis backed the Soviet line, the Soviets and Eastern Europeans
 who finance the IUS had to permit some debate, and they faced serious
 divisions within the organization.   The recent disclosure of CIA funding
 of the American student organization, USNSA, and accusations that the non-
 Communist International Student Conference (ISC) was CIA-infiltrated and
 supported, caused considerable confusion and some conflict.  The Soviet-
 dominated IUS Executive Committee has pursued, over the protests of the
 hard-line Chinese and Cuban sympathizers, a "united front" tactic aimed
 at bringing Communist and non-Communist student groups together under
 Soviet leadership.  These tactics have involved periodic propaganda calls
 for "world student unity" with the ISC.  Although China and Albania refus-
 ed to attend the Congress  eking did not even comment on it),saving the
 IUS from becoming the subject of another bitter Sino-Soviet wrangle, new
 trouble developed from the Latin American affiliates.
 The Cuban B&e-Noire.  In July 1966, Cuba emerged as the new militant
 challenger within the IUS, when it successfully manipulated the 4th Latin
 American Student Congress (CLAE) -- which the IUS had helped set up --
 into voting to establish a permanent Continental Latin American Students'
 Organization (OCLAE) with headquarters in Havana.  Cuba has since been
 disappointed by the meager support forthcoming from the IUS for the CLAE
 organization, while the IUS organization, for its part, has resisted all
 pressures towards greater regional autonomy.   Cuba has been further incens-
 ed by continuing Soviet feelers towardq the Chilean Students Federation
 (UFUCH), which boycotted the 4th C4A.4.  UFUCH, which is dominated by the
 Christian Democrats, is a member of both the IUS and the ISC, and is a
 major rival to Cuba for influence over Latin American students.
 Walk-Out from Prague Executive Committee Meeting.  When the IUS Execu-
 tive Committee met in Prague, March 13-17, to prepare an agenda and report
 for presentation to the Congress a fortnight later,allegations. of CIA
 funding of the ISC dominated its discussions, taking precedence overiall
 other issues, including the war in Vietnam.   The Cubans and their support-
 ers urged that all members of IUS  who  refused to break off ties with ISC
 should be expelled from IUS.   The Soviet_lining majority, however, pushed
 through a resolution calling only for members of the ISC to "reconsider"
 their affiliation.  The Cubans also used the CIA issue to demand expulsion
 of UFUCH from IUS on grounds that it was an agent of CIA.   The Cuban pro-
 posal was defeated, but did receive considerable support:                                13 for the
 Cuban resolution; 17 against; 6 abstentions; and 3 refusing to participate

 in the vote.  Voting with the Cubans were the Dominican Republic, Venez-
 uela, Puerto Rico, Guyana, French Guiana, Ecuador, Haiti, Brazil, Guade-
 loupe, Ceylon, India and North Vietnam.  The Cubans then walked out, tak-
 ing with them six of the other Latin American delegations and North Viet-
 nam.
 Repeat Walk-Out at Congress.  The convening   of the Congress in
 Mongolia, an Asian nation following the Soviet line, was expected to.demon-
 strate harmony in the IUS under Soviet leadership; however, soon after the
 Congress opened it became apparent that the IUS was deeply split, not only
 between Cuban and Soviet supporters, but into a number of antagonistic
 blocs. A Latin American proposal against UFUCH was presented and when it
 was defeated Cuba, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Ecuador, Puerto Rico,
 Guyana, Haiti, Brazil, and Guadeloupe walked out of the Congress.  A
 statement on the walk-out was issued by the Latin Americans in Praguia.  (See
 unclassified attachment).
 What Relationship with ISC?  Many of the delegates felt that IUS
 members should sever all ties with the ISC, but as in Prague, the Soviet-
 dominated leadership was able to bring to a successfu:L vote a mild resolu-
 tion urging IUS members  who  have dual membership to reconsider their ISC
 affiliations for review,by the next IUS Executive Committee meeting.  The
 resolution also condemned. the past and present officers of the U.S. Nation-
 al Student Association and urged IUS members to break relations with USNSA
 until that organization adopts "more progressive policies."  In debates
 on the issue, the Soviets took the position that it had been known al.l
 along that the leaders of ISC were agents of U.S. imperialism, but a line
 must be drawn between the leaders who have compromised themselves and. pro-
 gressive elements within the ISC.  K:OMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA echoed this argu-
 ment in an article on the IUS Congress, adding that the growing influence
 of IUS angers reactionary leaders of the ISC and Chinese splitters.
 Vietnam.  The IUS President, Zybynek Vokreuhiicky, a Czech, dwelt
 heavily on the war in Vietnam when he presented. the Executive Committee's
 report to the Congress (see unclassified attachment).   He called for un-
 conditional cessation of U.S. bombing and recognition of the National
 Liberation Front of South Vietnam as sole representative of the South
 Vietnamese people.  A representative from the World Peace Council (WPC)
 addressed the Congress on the war in Vietnam (see unclassified attachment),
 saying Washington has rejected peaceful negotiations in order to gain a
 military solution to the Vietnam problem.   He drew a parallel between
 the danger posed by the war in Vietnam and the bombing of Hiroshima and
 Nagasaki.   The Congress sent a telegram to President Johnson demanding
 immediate and unconditional end. to bombing and military operations in
 Vietnam., withdrawal of troops, and recognition of the NFLSV as sole re-
 presentative of South Vietnam.  A telegram of solidarity was sent to Ho
 Chi Minh.

 Organization and Membership.  The Congress reelected Vokrouhlicky
 president.  Representatives from 23 member organizations were elected to
 the secretariat and delegates from 47 organizations were elected to the
 executive committee; this represents an(expansion of both headquarters
 groups from 21 and 21 members respectively.  Although the IUS leadership
 expanded its headquarters personnel, it resisted making changes in the
 organizational structure.  Any change in organization would bring to the
 fore repeated demands from some members for greater regional autonomy.
 A proposal by the French National Student Union to set up a commission to
 reappraise the basic structure of IUS, was defeated, reportedly by only
 one vote, and caused considerable ill-feeling.
 The IUS membership now includes national student organizations from
 86 countries.  Admission of new members was one of the points on the agenda.
 Yugoslavia's application to change ip status from observer to associate
 member, which was approved, had been considered a possible source of serious
 controversy, but only the North Koreans and North and South Vietnamese
 voted against it.  Student unions from Uruguay, Ireland, and Quebec (French-
 Canadian Separatists) also became associate members.  Application by the
 Canadian Union of Students for associate membership was postponed.  Full
 membership was granted to student unions from Spain, Morocco, Lebanon, and
 Iran.  The application of the Israeli student union for observer status
 caused a major dispute in the credentials committee: it recommended, and
 the Congress accepted, granting Israel visitor status, some Arab delegations
 refusing to participate in the vote. The Federation of Costa Rican Univer-
 sity Students was denied associate membership on the allegation that it was
 created by CIA; it was seated as an observer, however.   The African Student
 Association (South Africa) was also granted observer status. Two rival
 delegations from Ghana showed up at the meeting.  Although all the English-
 speaking African delegates, with the exception of Tanzania, supported the
 delegation favoring the current government, the pro-Nkrumah group was re-
 seated on a general vote.
 Reportedly, the IUS plans to publish a new quarterly in French, English,
 and Spanish, under the title DEMOCRAIZATION OF EDUCATION.
 Other Issues.   European delegates gave attention to the need for
 student activities in support of European security and spoke out against
 the growing danger of neo-Nazism in West Germany and its dangerous influ-
 ence on students.   The resolution on European security touched off a
 debate in which Rumania and Yugoslavia argued for an IUS position against
 any intervention by one state in the affairs of another.  The Arab and
 Latin American delegations took violent exception to this position, arguing
 that while "reactionary intervention" is bad, "progressive intervention"
 (i.e., on the side of revolutionaries) is not only good, but to be encour-
 aged.   This position eventually won the day, and the Rumanian proposal was
 rejected.
 In general, it is interesting that the Cubans were unable to muster
 substantial support from the African delegations.  The Soviets had been
 concerned about recent Cuban activities (e:.g.,travel of AALAPSO delegations)

 in Africa, but TASS reported that speakers from Algeria, Angola, and .Congo
 Brazzaville affirmed support for past policies of the IUS.  The West
 African Students Union, which was sharply attacked for deviations by the
 Latin Americans in the 1966 IUS Executive Committee meeting, was dropped
 from the Secretariat but permitted to take its place as a full member of
 the Congress.
 Divisions Remain.  Although the IUS leadership had anticipated the
 possibility of a Latin American walk-out, it was unable to prevent it from
 happening.  Now the IUS is faced with the possibility of an entirely
 separate Latin American student organization led by the Cubans, with. the
 additional possibility that Chinese backing may be involved.
 At times, the Soviets reportedly appeared nearly to lose control of
 the IUS Congress, especially in the debate on the ISC and on the French
 motion for structural reform.  The confusion said factional division may
 have weakened the Soviet thrust to discredit the ISC after the allegations
 of CIA financing.   However, the Soviets maintained relatively firm control
 over the Secretariat, and can be expected to renew their united front
 offensive after allowing the passions aroused at the Congress to cool.   The
 basic Soviet strategy of the last several years -- to Extend communist in-
 fluence over non-Communist and non-aligned student groups -- remains un-
 changed.

 FIGHTERS:  A European-oriented Communist
 Front Joins the Vietnam Propaganda Campaign
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   (UNCLASSIFIED)  The International Federation of Resis-
 tance Fighters (FIR), a Communist front group little known outside of
 Europei  and Israel, was established at a congress in Vienna in June 1951
 organized by its predecessor, the International Federation of Former
 Political Prisoners of Fascism (FIAPP); the FIAPP had been set up in
 Paris in 1947 without participation of resistance fighters.   For the
 first year of its existence the FIR had its headquarters in Warsaw, and
 then it moved to Vienna (where it is still headquartered) and also set
 up a small secretariat in Paris.
 The Congress, the major body of the FIR,:is supposed to meet every
 three years and has actually been convened in June 1951, November 1954,
 November 1958, March 1959, December 1962, and December 1965; the first
 four sessions were held in Vienna and the latter two in Warsaw and Buda-
 pest.   (See attached unclassified clipping from the January-February
 1966 issue of the FIR monthly magazine for the list of officials elected
 at the 1965 Congress in Budapest.)  The General Council, comprising
 Bureau members and members nominated by National Association*, is sup-
 posed to meet at least once a year between meetings of the Congress.
 The Bureau (see below for a report on its April 1967 meeting) conducts
 the day-to-day business of the FIR; there are also a Secretariat and
 Financial Control, Historical, Medical, Legal, and Social Commissions.
 Full membership is open to organizations of former Partisans,
 Resistance fighters, political prisoners, and victims of Nazism or
 Fascism.   There is also an associate membership for organizations and
 an affiliated membership for individuals, both carrying consultative
 status only.   Including these various gradations of membership a total
 enrollment of 10 million has been claimed in the past by the FIR (in
 1959 it was claimed that full membership was 4 million, but quite
 obviously death and old age have taken their toll of World War II parti-
 cipants in the past 8 years), drawn from 44 organizations in 19 European
 countries and Israel; the FIR claimed that at its Budapest Congress in
 1965 there were 175 delegates and 98 observers from 23 countries and
 68 organizations.
 The FIR has close relations with two other major Communist fronts,
 the World Peace Council (WPC) and the International Association of
 Democratic Lawyers (IADL).  Its stated aims are to keep alive the memory

 of those who died fighting Fascism underground, to protect the :rights
 of those who survived, to prevent the reemergence of Nazism or Fascism,
 and to insure world peace.   Like the other Communist fronts around the
 world, it has recently joined in the Moscow-orchestrated. campaign to
 den grate U.S. policies in Vietnam.
 A three-day session of the FIR Bureau ended in Prague 9 April :L967.
 Over `50 delegates from 20 European countries and Israel discussed,
 according to a Czechoslovak News Agency dispatch that day, "further co-
 operation in strengthening peace in Europe and how to counter Neo-Fascism
 in various countries of the world."  What the FIR now considers mani-
 festations of Neo-Fascism around the world can be seen in the resolu-
 tion submitted by the Polish delegation at the Prague meeting and sum-
 marized by the Polish News Agency on 11 April:
 "The FIR joins the worldz,ide cc~tr ai;Zn demanding the cessation
 of air raids on the RV,, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
 Vietnam, and the recognition of the rig t of the Vietnamese  ec
 to self-determination, so that peace negoti'ati'ons may sta:zueen
 the belligerent parties.  The FIR    also in so-ari     th the
 struggle of the Spanish people for their rights and with the actions
 of the Greek people to oppose the threat of dictatorship and to
 guarantee constitutional and democratic liberties.
 "The FIR Bureau declares that peace in Europe depends now
 primarily on the development of the political situation in the
 German Federal Republic.  The influence which the neo-Nazi party
 (NPD) has won in the German Federal Republic proves that the possi-
 bility of the German state being again ruled by forces as aggres-
 sive and inhuman as those which acted in Germany from 1933--1945,
 cannot be ruled out.  Neither can we underestimate the fact that
 the present German Federal Republic Government, by rejecting any
 international control over its atomic industry, justifies the leaps
 that the West German Government may consider the exploitation of
 this industry for military purposes.
 "We have to state in particular that despite certain formal
 changes in its foreign policy, the German Federal Republic Govern-
 ment maintains the stand of previous West German governments:
 1)  when it refuses to recognize the present frontiers and partic-
 uZarly the Oder-Neisse frontier; and  2)  when it refuses to recog-
 nize the existence of the second German state and claims the right
 to represent all of Germany."
 Resistance associations in the East European Satellite-countries
 affiliated with the FIR (in its consistent support of Soviet foreign
 policy the FIR has only collaborated with Resistance associations under
 Communist control, not with groups organized on a national non-party
 basis in non-Communist countries) have also become act.ve in the campaign

 of attacking the United States and other Free World nations in regard
 to their policies on Vietnam.   Since. the Bonn Government has always been
 the chief target of the FIR, West German efforts in Vietnam have become
 a natural area for Soviet and East European propagandists to attack.   A
 recent example of how the Communist Resistance groups are expanding
 their interests to Vietnam, while keeping West Germany as the center of
 attention for the European audience, is contained in this Polish News
 Agency dispatch on 19 April:
 "A meeting of representatives-of former Resistance movement
 fighters and former prisoners of Nazi camps from Austria, Bulgaria,
 Czechoslovakia, France, Israel, Yugoslavia, the GDR, Rumania, Italy,
 the Soviet Union, and Poland took place in Warsaw 18 April.  Prob-
 lems of the unity of all combatant organizations in the.struggle
 against imperialism, the reviving West German militarism, and the
 threat of a new world war were discussed during the meeting.  The
 participants in the meeting adopted ,a resolution which reads in
 part:
 "Nepresentatives of national resistance movement organizations,
 who participated in the unveiling of the international monument at
 Oswiecim,* are determined to join their efforts in the struggle:
 1.) for a detente in the world and peaceful coexistence of all
 peoples;  2) dgainst the production of nuclear weapons and the
 destruction Of the stockpiles of these weapons;  3) for general
 disarmament which should be the basis for the liquidation of mili-
 tary blocs;  and 4) for immediate cessation of U.S. air raids on
 Vietnam and making peace in Vietnam according to the 1954 Geneva
 agreements.
 "We are determined to unite and mobilize all people of good
 will in the struggle against the application of the statute of
 limitations to Nazi crimes and for the  punishment of war criminals.
 In the name of the unity of former resistance movement fighters
 and in the name of the common aims which linked them in their
 struggle against nazism, we appeal for an intensified struggle
 against the reviving Nazi and fascist forces and for mobilizing in
 this struggle broad masses of the population and public opinion.
 All neofascistorganizations, primarily the NPD and the militaristic
 organizations in West Germany, should be dissolved."
 East European Resistance fighters are also being exploited to
 propagandize another Communist line on Germany:   the campaign to solicit
 diplomatic recognition of East Germany.   The West Berlin independent
 DER TAGESSPIEGEL reported on 23 December 1966 the East German Communist
 Party Politburo had decided to send several groups of Resistance fighters
 to about 30 neutral countries in early 1967.   The paper stated:

 "These groups, made up oFf 2 to 5 persons each, will take along
 documents to these countries on the part the Corrmunists played in
 the anti-Hitler resistance, as well as documents on the alleged
 Neo-Nazi danger in West Germany and the persecution of peaceful
 elements by the Bonn judiciary.  Public meetings are to be ore7a-
 nized with local Communist parties or their front organizations.
 The East Zone regime is supposed to be already in contact with
 governments in India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Guinea, Tanzania,
 and Colombia in regard to entrance permits."
 The FIR, as the coordinator of the activities of the various national
 Resistance groups, has organized several international meetings in
 recent years in West Europe, frequently in. conjunction with the IADL.
 It also sustains interest in its activities by means of several publica-
 tions:   a monthly magazine in French (RESISTANCE UNIE) and in German
 ;DER WIDERSTANDSKAEMPFER); a twice monthly mimeographed Information
 Bulletin; and special pamphlets (such as the one published in. December
 1966 on the 20th anniversary of the Nuremberg Trials, dealing with past
 history and today's "revival of Neo-Nazism and revanchism especially in
 West Germany").
 An FIR Bureau meeting held in Vienna 10-?11 December 1966 discussed,
 according to the Austrian CP daily VOLKSST:IME, the growth of Neo-Nazism
 and passed a resolution on Vietnam.   Although the text of the resolu-
 tion was not reported, its contents were presumably similar to the
 letter of protest which the FIR sent to President Johnson last summer
 (see the attached reproduction of the masthead and lead item in the
 26 August 1966 issue of the FIR Information Bulletin). (END UNCLASSIFIED)

 PLIGHT OF CHINESE NATIONAL MINORITIES WORSENS
 Moscow:   Radio Peace and Progress in English to Asia, 17 February 1967
 Communists and anyone else who disagrees with the Peking dictator's course
 are being killed.   The national minorities in China and all non-Chinese
 people are being bitterly persecuted by the chauvinistic Maoist clique.
 Radio station Peace and Progress has many letters from people who managed
 to escape from the so-called Red Guard.  It is hard to read these letters
 without anger.  The following is the statement of Balkhash Bafin, a
 former People's Liberation Army lieutenant-colonel, graduate of the
 central national school in Peking, and holder of three orders and five
 medals of China.   He is now a citizen of Soviet Kazakhstan.
 From day to day the campaign against all honest communists in Sinkiang
 increased.  Arrests began.   The Kazakh national intellectuals were rid-
 iculously  accused of trying to set up Kazakh rule and to unite all the
 Kazakhs of China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union under them.
 This ridiculous claim about the setting up of Kazakh rule first appeared
 with the failure of the creation of the new history of the Kazakhs, the
 Uighurs and the Kighiz of Sinkiang Province.  The Chinese Communist
 Party leaders and the Chinese Government figured that this new history
 would prove one thing:  Namely, that the Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kirgiz are
 all Chinese, and consequently they have one motherland stretching from
 the  southern part of China to the Aral Sea.  In other words, the new
 history was needed to uphold the great power chauvinism of the Chinese
 leaders. They wanted it to be formed by the Kazakhs, Uighurs and Kirgiz
 who lives in China.
 But the intellectuals, the communists of Sinkiang, did not fall for this
 lie.   Peking then declared that the residents of Sinkiang had two hearts
 -- one yellow Russian heart and the other a red Chinese heart.   "We will
 trample on the yellow heart," said Peking.
 As the years went by, the life of the minority nationalities worsened,
 and with the creation of the people's communes it became unbearable.
 Back in February 1957, Ching Yang, a Chinese Communist correspondent of
 NCNA, openly criticized the people's communes in a Binkiang newspaper.
 He told about the difficult life of the Kazakhs and Uighurs, about their
 poverty and lack of rights.   The correspondent was accused of under-
 mining national prestige and a warrant was issued for his arrest.   But
 it was too late:   he hanged himself.
 "I was dismissed only because I was a Kazakh," writes Bafin.   "Not wait-
 ing for things to get worse, I decided to carry out my old dream and the
 behest of my father, who died in a Chiang Kai-shek jail, and cross the
 border, returning home to the land of my ancestors.   I once sent a

 parcel, to some friends in Sinkiang," says Bafin.   "The food happened to
 be wrapped in an old issue of the newspaper Socialist Kazakhstan.  This
 was enough for my friends to be arrested and accused of ties with the
 Soviet Union.   It is forbidden to talk in one's native tongue at public
 places."
 Ziya,Samedi, former chairman of the Board of Writers of the Sinkiang-
 Uighur Autonomous Region of China, now a member of the Bureau of the
 Uighur section of the Kazakh Writers Union, as well as Abdykadyr Abdrak-
 hamov, Daragbeyev, Magamedov, and other former Chinese citizens, write
 about the bloody terror being perpetrated against the national. minorities
 in China.
 They say that millions of Chinese have moved to Sinkiang, that the local
 population is being driven off of their ancient lands and herded deeper
 into China onto lifeless deserts.  Forced assimilation is taking place.
 Kazakh, Uighur, and Kirgiz girls are taken away from their parents and
 for fear of death, are forced to marry Chinese.
 The leaders of the so-called Red Guards say that Chinese blood. must
 predominate in the veins of every person.  The Red Guards destroy every-
 thing:  books, record players and records, furniture and dishes.  They
 cut off the braids of the women and girls and forbid the wearing of
 national clothes.  This is the truth as reported by eyewitnesses.  This
 is the truth about the activities of Mao and his gang, which completely
 contradict the interests of socialism and the national policy of the
 communists.
 TASS International Service in English, 1 April 1967
 Moscow -- Aleksandr Dymkov writes in Izvestiiya today about the policy of
 stepped-up discrimination against national minorities in China.  "In an
 open challenge to Marxism-Leninism, the Maoists have proclaimed the
 assimilation of non-Han peoples:to be their aim," he writes.
 There are close to 13 million non-Chinese living in China.  The largest
 national minorities live in autonomous regions, of which there are only
 five.  "The other nationalities received only 'regional' and 'rural
 district' rights," Dymkov writes.  "Andthese regions and rural districts
 were so (?situated) as to break up the national minorities to the utmost,
 disrupting their territorial, economic, and political unity."
 To substantiate this statement, the journalist cites the example of the
 Mongolians.  They live mainly in the autonomous districts of Inner Mongolia,
 but some live in two small autonomous units which do not belong to a
 district.   The Tibetans, too, have several autonomous rural districts in
 provinces bordering on the Tibet region.

 Nearly all administrative and party posts in the autonomous regions are
 held by Chinese.  All business correspondence is conducted only in Chi-
 nese.                          The national languages are taught at schools only in junior
 classes.
 -The journalist points out that persecution of national customs was con-
 ducted in China under the pretext of struggle against "feudal culture."
 Since 1961+, the magazine Red Flag has repeatedly declared that the ulti-
 mate aim of the nationalities policy in China is "complete obliteration
 of specific national features and distinctions."
 TASS International Service in English, 5 April 1967
 Moscow -- Ernst Henry writes in Literary Gazette today that it is not
 communism that interests the Peking dictator.   He is thinking of quite
 different things:   for him, communist ideas are merely a cover for a plan
 for the establishment under his hegemony of something like a new racialist
 Reich in Asia and even beyond it."
 Once you take this into consideration, everything else falls immediately
 into place, the author continues.  A man who harbors "such fanatical
 plans must logically be interested in both the destruction of the modern
 international working class movement and of world culture."  "To this
 power-mad man, global war must seem like the shortest way to the reali-
 zation of his demented, adventurist plans.  And we know of some precedents."
 Ernst Henry writes about Mao Tse-tung's insane guidelines for a third
 world war.   "We cannot sacrifice a single continent, we cannot agree to
 the vanguard of mankind, advancing toward communism, being thrown at a
 whim into the flames of thermonuclear war," the author points out.
 "Only rabid imperialists and adventurists who have betrayed Marxism are
 interested in this:      communism is needed for the living."
 TASS International Service in English, 10 February 1967
 Alma Ata -- "The clique of Mao Tse-tung has turned Sinkiang into a prison
 for small peoples."  Abdulhai Rusiyev,  Uighur poet from Kulja, told a
 TASS correspondent.   Before he moved to the Soviet Union, he was a member
 of the Union of Chinese Writers and led a poet's section in Urumchi.
 "Several Million Uighurs now live in Sinkiang, Rusiyev said.  My people
 are sincerely striving to build a new society together with the Chinese.
 However, in the past 10 years the Chinese authorities have perpetrated
 one discrimination after another against the Uighur people."
 Against their wishes, the Uighur were forced to use an alphabet which
 conflicts with the phonetic demands of the Uighur language.

 "As early as 1960, the Sinkiang Daily (No. 36) published 500 different
 Chinese words that the Uighurs should use."
 "The children have no opportunity to study the history of their people
 in school," Ruziyev said.   "Distorting the truth, the historical facts,
 the Chinese repeated over and over to our children that the Uighurs are
 of Chinese origin.  This is what Chiang Kai-shek asserted in his time."
 "In recent years instruction in Chinese has been forcibly introduced at
 the Uighur higher education establishments and the term of studies
 increased to seven years.   The publication of Uighur literature sharply
 decreased.  Nine tenths of the Uighur writers and poets, among them the
 well known writers Kadvey, Aliyev, Nimshakhit Armya, were subjected to
 repressions.  Uighur theater and dance groups are included in the Chinese
 ensembles."
 Nizamdin Saliyev, an Uighur and former member of the CPR Academy of
 Sciences, declared:   "In promoting a great-power chauvinistic policy,
 the Chinese leaders aim at the forcible assimilation of small peoples,
 the elimination of their national features, and their absorption.  My
 native territory, Sinkiang, has been flooded for this purpose with
 millions of Chinese settlers from the central regions of the country.
 Uighur girls are forced to marry Chinese.  Insubordination is assessed as
 a minifestation of nationalism."
 Shikir Gubarbakiev, a former editor in chief of the magazine Sinkian&.
 Liberator Army, told a TASS correspondent:  "The Mao Tse-tung group has
 of late stepped up the baiting of Moslems.  In Kulja there were some 150
 mosques.  Now only three are open:  the Uighur, the Bungan, and the
 Uzbek.   The authorities confiscated the property of the closed prayer
 houses.
 In Nilhing district, the Hung Weiping recently attacked a mosque where the
 people were celebrating the Juma Namaz festival.  Bloody clashes took
 place between the hooligans and believers.
 Everyone who knows even a little Marxist-Leninist teaching knows abso-
 lutely that these teachings totally reject any violence against the
 people's faith.   Lenin always asserted the necessity of respecting national
 and religious feelings.   Thus, force must not be used.
 The hysterical (word indistinct) of the Red Guards to get rid of Islam,
 to prohibit the reading of the Koran,. and to ban religious duties is a
 policy completely alien to genuine Marxism-Leninism.   The destruction
 of the mosques, the use of violence, and the ridiculing of Muslims in
 China is but another undeniable proof that the cultural revolution is
 the work of a group of chauvinists who are trying to establish their
 personal authority without regard for the interests of the people -- no
 more and no less.   The persecution of the Muslims in China is incon-
 sistent with the principles which, as Lenin stated, must be put into the
 law of the socialist state.   It was natural that such principles were
 embodied in the constitution of the first socialist state in the world
 and in its practical life.

 Religion in our country is separated from the state.   Every citizen in
 the Soviet Union enjoys the inviolable right to freedom of religion and
 religious duties.  Mosques are operating in Soviet towns.  Also, there
 are Islamic religious administrations and lawful institutions.  Many
 Soviet Muslims have taken the pilgrimage to Kaabah and have visited the
 Arab countries.  A large number of men of religion from the Arab
 countries have visited the Soviet Union and upon their return to their
 homeland have confirmed that there is freedom of religion in the Soviet
 Union.
 The present events in China, and the acts of hooliganism, and the rid-
 iculing of thousands of innocent people arouse the conscience of every
 honest person.  Moreover, they also force the condemnation by all Soviets
 who have always firmly adhered to the principles of socialist-Leninist
 ethics which are based on a noble humanitarian spirit and the ideas of
 fraternity and friendship with all peoples of the world.
 Moscow Radio, in Albanian to Albania, 10 March 1967
 Commentary by Vladimir Setov
 (Summary)  The historic creation of the Chinese state on a territory
 inhabited by many nationalities -- 52 in all -- has been distorted by
 various reactionaries in order to oppress the minorities.  It is aston-
 ishing but true that Mao Tse-tung has adopted the same attitude which
 endangers the existence of these minorities.
 This sad conclusion is supported by the example of the Sinkiang Uighur
 Autonomous Region which represents one-sixth of China's territory, and
 at one time was inhabited by 605 million people, of whom, 4.2 million
 were Uighurs.  It is planned to fill up the central region of Sinkiang
 with Chinese.  Thus, the autonomy of this region will become fictitious,
 and the indigenous population will lose all rights.
 These plans are being carried out in great haste.  It must be noted that
 in Urumchi, almost 300 Chinese arrive daily.  Those who are expelled take
 nothing with them.  They must simply leave the country.  In other words,
 the indigenous Uighurs are expelled from the towns and transferred to
 agricultural regions.   The Uighurs' houses are being taken over by the
 Chinese.   If it were a question of transferring the surplus Chinese
 population in Sinkiang, this could be excused, but the Chinese leaders,
 in their secret meetings, have adopted the policy for quickly assimi-
 lating the Uighur Autonomous Region.  This assimilation is being carried
 out in various forms.
 Thus Uighur and Kazakh girls are forced to marry only Chinese.   The
 main role in this assimilation effort is being played by the 70,000 Red
 Guards of Sinkiang.   Last September Peking sent 200 so-called Rebels to
 lead them.   The operation usually runs as follows:  A Red Guard proposes
 marriage to a Uighur girl.   If the girl asks to be allowed to think it
 over even for a day, she is immediately accused of nationalism and is

 threatened with ominous consequences.  In carrying out this chauvinist
 policy to eliminate the local population, they also use the policy of
 differentiation in the distribution. of food.  If a Chinese gets 600
 grams of wheat per day, the other inhabitants of this autonomous region
 receive only 300 grams.
 The Uighurs are now being persecuted for killing the followers of Chiang
 Kai-shek during the 1940's.   The attack against local. culture is carried
 out in such a way as to annihilate everything.  National poets and
 writers are completely omitted from school textbooks; the Chinese have
 rewritten the history of the peoples of the region.   In 1956 a text was
 issued. in the Uighur language containing a short history of the Uighurs,
 repeating the views of the Chiang Kai-shek historians.  The historic
 monuments of the Uighur people and language have been destroyed.
 Here is another example of the oppression of the local people:  The Red
 Guards from Peking took away even the stones of the Uruinchi mosques and
 were ordered to prepare to destroy all the mosques of the town..
 The policy of Great China chauvinism is being intensified by the complete
 destruction of national cadres.  This policy, which started in 1952, has
 been intensified beyond measure during the present madness of the cultural
 revolution.  Sinkiang is covered with concentration camps.  In. November
 1962, 800 inmates of one camp were taken into a previously mined pit; the
 explosives were detonated killing all of them. In a forced labor colony
 there are 3,000 to 50,000 Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kirgiz, and Dungars in chains.
 All protest is cruelly suppressed.  In 1962, in [?Kucha] the Chinese
 opened fire aginst unarmed local inhabitants -- mainly women and children --
 killing 88 and wounding hundreds.
 The example of commune in the [?Durbuzhin] area, Uighur Autonomous
 Region, shows the types of rules being imposed by the Chinese on the
 peoples of Sinkiang.  Here, since 1965 a so-called group of revolutionary
 civil servants has existed, composed of 150 people who hold mass, seven-
 hour meetings every day.  At these meetings they interrogated persons
 under  suspicion, using very cruel methods.,  The peasants' life is mili-
 tarized.   They are forced to march in a military manner and sing for
 hours. in Mao Tse-tung's praise.  These "anti-Chinese elements" are
 forced to work 16 to 18 hours in the fields.
 In presenting his ideas as the beacon of the revolutionary peoples,
 Mao Tse-tung, through his national policy is on the road of treason to
 socialism and he has been proven to be the continuer of Great China
 chauvinism.
 At the same time recent events in China have shown that Mao Tse-tung; has
 not learned anything from the inglorious collapse of the big leap policy
 and is again hatching a plan for a big step ahead.   He adopts as the
 pattern for his social structure something which has nothing in common

 with neither Marxism nor utopian socialism.  According to the blueprints
 of the Peking theoreticians, all the Chinese people have to do is master
 the ideas of Mao and all problems, including economic problems, will be
 solved immediately.
 It is not the wide-scale introduction into the Chinese economy of the
 achievements of modern science and engineering, nor the mastery of all
 the riches of world culture, that Mao Tse-tung sees as the road to a
 society which he calls the socialist society, but in the return to a
 barter economy using the most primitive equipment.  As a result, instead
 of setting the task of insuring a well balanced, all-around development
 of the productive forces of the country and a steady rise, on that
 basis, of the managerial and cultural standards of the masses, the idea
 is advanced that the most backward forms of social organization should
 be preserved.  Indeed, the very principle of raising the material and
 cultural standards of the working people in socialist society is con-
 demned by Mao Tse-tung and those around him as bourgeois and counter-
 revolutionary.  In China at present (?speculation on) communist ideas
 is taking place on an enormous scale and Mao Tse-tung's group tries to
 take advantage of this to assert his ideological and political hegemony
 in the world revolutionary movement.  As for the political slogans
 advanced by Mao Tse-tung and those around him, they are utterly alien
 to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of socialism.

 Statement by Latin American Students on Their Walk-Out from the IUS Congress
 The delegations of the Cuban University Student Federation (FEU) and 10 other
 Latin American student organizations that walked out of the ninth congress
 of the International Union of Students (IUS) held recently at Ulan Bator,
 Mongolia, have released a statement in Prague explaining the reason for their
 action.
 The statement, addressed to public opinion and the world student movement,
 sets forth principles adopted by the 11 delegations against retention of the
 Union of Chilean University Federations (UFUCH) in the IUS and argues that
 their own position cannot be called antiunitary, and still less sectarian.
 The 11 student organizations recall their petition that the congress expel
 the UFUCH from the IUS as a reactionary organization whose policy and conduct
 do not represent the Chilean student body's aspirations and desires.  The
 signers of the manifesto say the essential principle governing their conduct
 is "a resolute battle to the death against imperialism -- chiefly Yankee
 imperialism -- colonialism, and neocolonialism, for the achievement of genuine
 independence and national liberation, and a true peace with dignity."
 "These principles," the statement continues, "conform fully to our idea of
 unity; we fight for that unity, for a unity embracing the revolutionary,
 democratic, and progressive forces."  It goes on to say that accepting the
 UFUCH in the.IUS "is to flagrantly violate the principles we have defended
 and will resolutely continue defending.
 The student organizations from the 11 Latin American countries say in their
 joint manifesto that the arguments and charges they submitted to the congress,
 amply backed by concrete proof, were disregarded and sidestepped by a majority
 of the congress, which "confirmed the place of the UFUCH.in progressive and
 revolutionary ranks, as if it actually had those qualities."  "That decision,"
 they continue, "is a violation of the principles upheld by the IUS, because
 the UFUCH, through its reactionary and pro:imperialist Christian Democratic
 leadership, which determines its action and political line, is an organiza-
 tion which does not represent the aspirations and desires of the progressive
 student body of Chile."
 The 11 delegations also accuse the UFUCH of "coinciding in objectives and
 conduct with the Cuban counterrevolutionaries in exile and of pursuing a
 proven divisionist line in the Latin American student movement.   The most
 eloquent examples of this were its presence at the divisionist Guatemala
 conference, the so-called fourth CLAE in Natal, Brazil, and its systematic
 boycott of the fourth CLAE in Havana."
 The statement says that the UFUCH, as has been corroborated by various news
 items in the world press, "is an organization that has had and still has close
 ties with organizations financed by the CIA, such as the ORMEU and the CIE,

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060003-0
 and some of its leaders collaborate directly with the CIA."  Furthermore, it
 is a silent accomplice to the murder of workers at the Salvador mines by
 Frei's Christian Democratic administration.
 It then rejects and denounces the speeches made by certain delegates describ-
 ing the attitude of the 11 Latin American delegations as "antiunitary and
 sectarian"    and criticizes "the arbitrariness and abnormality that charac-
 terized the debates and later conclusions.   We strive for unity, a unity
 resting on the principles of the revolutionary, democratic, progressive stu-
 dent movement of.the whole world that are faithfully embodied in the spirit
 and letter of the fourth CLAE held in Havana.
 "We are convinced that our conduct contributes directly to the cause of the
 peoples ... and is inspired by the sacred d.3:fense of anti--imperialist prin-
 ciples and preservation of their real, practical, effective worth rather
 than just their theoretical value.  We see our conduct as a concrete contri-
 bution to solidarity with battling peoples, particularly heroic  Vietnam."
 The statement says in conclusion:  "We fight and will continue fighting for
 the fulfillment of the most genuine aspirations of our student body and our
 peoples, always ready to take the invariably hard, trying course, and to
 march with firm steps to victory."
 The statement is signed by the following organizations:   Federation of Uni-
 versity Students for Puerto Rican Independence (FUPI); Cuban University Stu-
 dent Federation (FEU); Venezuelan Federation of University Centers (FCU); Ecua-
 doran University Student Federation (FEUE); Colombian National University
 Federation (FUN); Haitian National Student Union (UNEH); French Guiana Stu-
 dent Union (UEG); Guadeloupe General Student Union (UGEG); Student Council of
 the Guyana Pyo; Dominican Student Federation (FED); and Brazilian National
 Student Union (UNEB).

 Speech by IUS President and Debate on Vietnam at IUS Congress
 The ninth congress of the International Union of Students continues in Ulan
 Bator.   The congress heard a report of the executive committee presented by
 the union's president, Zybynck Vokrouhlicky.   The overwhelming majority of
 students, he said, are aware of their role in the development of society and
 understand that only by active participation in the common struggle of the
 peoples for liberation from imperialist domination and exploitation can they
 achieve their aim.  In the past 20 years the IUS has always stood firmly on
 the side of progressive forces in their struggle against imperialism.
 Speaking on the situation in different parts of the world, he dwelt particu-
 larly on the escalation of U.S. aggression against the DRV and the intensifi-
 cation of the bombardment of its negotiations until the United States stops
 its aggression against Vietnam.
 The United States, he went on, ought to deliberately and unconditionally stop
 the bombardment of the DRV and recognize the NFLSV as the only genuine repre-
 sentative of the South Vietnamese people.   Until these problems are solved
 the Vietnamese people have no choice but to fight against the imperialist
 aggression of the United States.
 The IUS directs its efforts to mobilize the student masses of the world for
 stronger solidarity with the Vietnamese people and constant help to its struggle.
 We render to our Vietnamese friends all possible material and financial help.
 Bulgarian students, noted Vokrouhlicky, collected more than 20 million to
 buy necessary things for the embattled Vietnamese people.   Soviet students
 have held a series of meetings protesting U.S. aggression in Vietnam and have
 made a great financial contribution to the struggle of the Vietnamese people.
 The speaker dwelt further on the broad movement of solidarity with the struggle
 of the Vietnamese people among students of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin
 America.
 The IUS and the progressive student movement come out for democratic reforms
 in education based on the principle that education should be accepted as a
 right irrespective of sex, color, religious or political beliefs, and social
 conditions.  The IUS carries out considerable work in the fields of culture
 and publishing.
 The development of the international student movement, states the report,
 vividly shows that the activities of the IUS are in the interest of broad
 student masses all over the world.   In the period since the last congress in
 Sofia the union has grown and at present includes 80 national organizations.
 The IUS has grown into the largest and most representative progressive demo
 cratic international organization of students.   the IUS program serves the
 purpose of strengthening solidarity and international cooperation of students
 against imperialism and colonialism and for world peace, national independence,
 social progress, and democratic reforms in education.

 The congress also heard reports by (Nguyen Dak Yuri -- phonetic), a represen-
 tative of the student movement for the liberation of South Vietnam and a
 member of the executive committee of the union, and by (Nguyen Van Vu -?-
 phonetic), a delegate of the DRV student movement.   Both delegates and guests
 gave a warm and hearty welcome to the representatives of the students of
 heroic Vietnam and both speakers were heard with great attention and were
 many times interrupted by applause.
 Speaking in the debate on the report of the executive committee and the
 reports from Vietnam, representatives of the student union of Uganda said
 that the question of Vietnam is the most important and of support to the
 heroic struggle of Vietnamese people.  The speakers said that the United
 States must be held responsible for the enormous human losses suffered by the
 people of Vietnam.
 A Soviet delegate said that the contribution of Soviet students to the cam-
 paign of solidarity with heroic Vietnam was well known.   The land of the
 Soviets, the delegate said, the entire Soviet people will always support
 embattled Vietnam.  We lend a vigorous political support to our Vietnamese
 comrades.   Thousands of solidarity rallies, collection of funds, donation of
 blood, and voluntary work toward the Vietnam fund -- all these are merely
 a fraction of the constant efforts of Soviet students toward helping Vietnam.
 The representative of the student union of Kenya denounced all forms and
 symptoms of imperialist enslavement and neocolonialism.   The representatives
 df student organizations of Mongolia, Ethiopia, Brazil, Tanzania, Cyprus,
 and other countries also spoke in the general debate.
 The IUS ninth congress sent a telegram to U.S. President Johnson which said:
 On behalf of the 80 national student unions represented at this congress we
 demand an immediate and unconditional stop to the bombardment of the DRV
 and military operations in South Vietnam.   We demand that the U.S. troops and
 the troops of its allies be withdrawn from South Vietnam and that the NFLSV
 be recognized as the sole and genuine representative of the South Vietnamese
 people.
 The congress sent another telegram to President Ho Chi Minh of the DRV with
 expressions of solidarity for the struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people
 against the aggressive war of the American imperialists.   The congress com-
 pletely supports the position of the DRV.

 Speech by World Peace Council Representative at the IUS Congress
 The ninth congress of the International Union of Students continues its work
 in Ulan Bator.  General debates continued on 30 and 31 March with representa-
 tives of student organizations and student unions of West Africa, Zambia,
 Sweden, Cuba, and other delegations participating.
 On 31 March a speech was made at the congress by Comrade Chimid, representa-
 tive of the World Peace Council and member of the World Peace Council.  On
 behalf of the millions of people of good will and participants in the world
 movement of supporters of peace, as well as on behalf of the World Peace
 Council, he sincerely greeted the participants in the ninth IUS congress.
 Comrade Chimid said in his speech that the American bombs that exploded in
 the last days of World War II over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and
 Nagasaki vividly demostrate what our planet can be transformed into by the
 imperialists if the peoples are unable to restrain them.
 He continued:  The World Peace Council highly appreciates the great contribu-
 tion of youth and student organizations, including the IUS which is the leader
 of the student movement, to our common struggle for easing international
 tension, for peaceful coexistence of states with different social and politi-
 cal systems, and for disarmament.
 Chimid said:  The principle of peaceful coexistence long ago captured the
 minds and thoughts of millions upon millions of people and whatever the enemies
 of the principle (?may say to dishonor it), it has become a program of the
 people's struggle for averting a new world war.
 Comrade Chimid continued:  There are people who maintain that the principle
 of peaceful coexistence means all-round conciliation and appeasement and the
 perpetuation of the many injustices existing in the world of ours.   Those
 who think so probably take us to be out of touch with reality.   When we speak
 of principles of peaceful coexistence we apply them to relations between
 independent and sovereign states with different social and political systems.
 But these principles are by no means applicable to relations between parties
 and between colonies and the colonial powers.  Any Mongolian shepherd will
 tell you that the care of sheep should not be entrusted to wolves.
 Chimid continued:   Together with you we of the World Peace Council heard
 with great agitation the speeches of the student representatives of South
 Vietnam and the DRV.   Their speeches sounded like an indictment of the Ameri-
 can aggressors, and yet at the same time as a tribute to the courage and
 glory of the people defending their freedom, independence, and honor.
 Together with you we viewed a documentary film.   I do not know how many copies
 of this film have been produced by our Vietnamese friends, but I am certain
 that every sequence of the film has left its mark on our hearts.

 To the proposal of the DRV Government that stated that if the United States
 will unconditionally stop the bombardment and other military actions against
 the DRV then it would be possible to sit at a table of negotiations, the
 American rulers cynically answered by intensified artillery Fire on the
 ground and sea, the mining of rivers, and active air raids.   The recent
 gathering on Guam once again laid bare for the whole world to see the aggres-
 sive nature of the American militarists.
 Washington has rejected peaceful negotiations, hoping for a military solution
 of the Vietnam problem.  Yet the imperialists should better remember the
 lessons of history.  Instances of an ignominious end of aggressors who enslaved
 one people or another are many.  Let the imperialists know that the Vietnamese
 people are not alone in their struggle.
 If other peoples cannot hear the sound of cannon over the wonderful Vietnamese
 soil it does not mean that they can remain deaf to what is going on there.
 If the splinters of American shells and bombs do At reach other peoples, it
 does not mean that their hearts and souls do not shudder.  No, the peoples
 of the whole world share in the misfortune and suffering of the heroic Vietna-
 mese people because they are defending not only their own cause but the cause
 of."all peoples.
 The peoples of all countries, first of all of the countries of the great
 socialist community, Comrade Chimid'continued, are rendering and will continue
 to render all necessary help to the fraternal people of Vietnam, including
 military aid.
 The rallying of all peace-loving forces for effective aid to the fraternal
 Vietnamese people is a requirement of the times.   In this connection we cannot
 help noting the harm Inflicted by those people whose policy it is to under-
 mine the unity and cohesion of the anti-imperialist forces and to put. obstacles
 in the way of action in support of the Vietnamese people.
 The World Peace Council recognizes the NFLSV as the only lawful representa-
 tive of the South Vietnamese people and fully supports the concrete proposals
 of the NFLSV and the DRV Government as the only real and. acceptable founda-
 tions for the settlement of the Vietnam problem.
 As regards the problem of European security, the speaker said, the policy of
 the West German imperialists is the main obstacle on the path of peace and
 security in Europe.   It is necessary to wage an intensified struggle for
 insuring collective security on the European continent.
 The broad program of struggle for the normalization of the situation on the
 European continent that has been developed by certain socialist countries,
 the speaker said, promotes the further intensifi:catior.G of aspirations of the
 majority of European countries for easing tension, for developing good-
 neighbor relations, and for the solution of the security 'problem in Europe
 on the general European basis, on the principle of peaceful coexistence of
 states with different social systems.

 Comrade Chimid continued:  Another sphere of imperialist expansion that is
 wrought with serious consequences is the policy of enslavement of peoples
 and suppression of the national liberation movement and the policy of racial
 discrimination and apartheid.  The time has passed when the imperialists
 could at will command the fates of the peoples of Asia and Africa.  As a
 result of the triumphant national liberation movement in the severe struggle
 against foreign enslavers a score of new states have emerged.   The struggle
 of the peoples of Latin America for liberation from the oppression of monop-
 olies of the United States is growing.
 The World Peace Council resolutely condemns colonialism and neocolonialism
 in all its forms and once again expresses its complete solidarity and support
 to the struggle of the peoples of Portuguese and other colonies for their
 freedom and independence.  The speaker emphasized that there is no stronger
 means for the successful opposition to the forces of reaction and aggression
 than the unity of all anti-imperialist and peace-loving forces on the broad-
 est democratic base.
 Our organizations should still more develop and widen our contacts and ties
 with each other as well as with other organizations outside our ranks and
 insure the unity of action of. all forces standing on the platform of peace
 and democracy in their struggle against imperialist aggression and against
 world war, the speaker said in conclusion.
 The IUS congress: is. continuing its work.
