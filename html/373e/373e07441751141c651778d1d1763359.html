 1) 64                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Under the protective provisions of the
 fifth amendment no person can be de-
 prived of his life, liberty, or property
 without due process of law. These guar-
 antees are as operative against legisla-
 tive action as they are against action of
 the courts.  Due process is as much de-
 nied by arbitrary and unjustified con-
 gressional action as it is by judicial ac-
 tion which deprives an individual of his
 day in court or his right to justice. Due
 process demands that the legislative
 body, in performing its functions, jus-
 tify any legislation which would curtail
 the time-honored right of a property
 owner to use his property as he sees fit.
 This has not been done in the case of the
 legislation commerce.
 No respected legal scholar has ever
 suggested such a far-fetched theory. If
 the commerce clause can be stretched to
 such an extreme, then Federal power and
 authority could be used to achieve a
 completely planned economy by regulat-
 ing all business-local and intrastate as
 well as interstate-in matters connected
 with alleged civil rights.
 I should like to say that again with
 emphasis.  If under the emotional im-
 pulse of civil rights we are to stretch the
 commerce clause far enough and broadly
 enough to reach all the matters out-
 lined in the bill, I submit to the Ameri-
 can people that the last barrier of pro-
 tection they might have in any of their
 private or business or social affairs is
 broken.  The only exception is very in-
 nermost parts of the private homes.
 Congress has jurisdiction over inter-
 state commerce. If interstate com-
 merce is to be extended, to the limits at-
 tempted here under authority of the
 commerce clause bf the Constitution,
 there are no boundaries to it.
 Incredibly, we are asked to stretch the
 commerce clause to reach even the
 tiniest of the allegedly covered busi-
 nesses, even though it is admittedly not
 in interstate commerce, if cumulatively
 the "total operations" of it and all the
 other similar businesses taken together
 would exercise a "substantial" effect on
 interstate commerce.
 In other words, the courts have held
 that a fragmentary or remote effect on
 interstate commerce will not give us ju-
 risdiction.  There must be a substantial
 impact.  Those who argue for the bill
 say that a single little restaurant will not
 itself affect commerce substantially, but,
 they say, "There are a great number of
 little restaurants on the highway; and
 if we add them all together they have a
 substantial effect cumulatively on inter-
 state commerce."
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield at that point?
 Mr. STENNIS.  I yield.
 Mr. HART.  Accepting the Senator's
 statement as a statement of fact, let us
 suppose that for 100 miles on the high-
 way there are only tiny little restaurants,
 but, judging from a distance of 50 feet,
 a man is excluded from being served in
 any of those little restaurants because
 he is colored.  Would that not affect In-
 terstate commerce?
 Mr. STENNIS.  It would have a very
 remote effect.
 Mr. HART.  It depends on how hun-
 gry a person becomes in a hundred miles,
 and how much he needs shelter.
 Mr. STENNIS.  The point I am ar-
 guing is that one little restaurant A
 would not have a substantial effect on
 interstate commerce.
 Mr. HART.  I was not talking about
 restaurant A. I was talking of restau-
 rants A through AAA, in a stretch of
 road.  I ask the Senator if such a sit-
 uation does not affect interstate com-
 merce.
 Mr. STENNIS.  To obtain jurisdiction
 over the little restaurant A under the
 theory of the proponents of this bill, it
 is necessary to consider all its activities,
 all its customers, all its present and ex-
 pected business, and everything else, and
 to throw it in with a great many others.
 Then, and only then, according to the
 bill's proponents, can it be said that that
 small restaurant has a substantial effect
 on interstate commerce.  My point is
 that we have no jurisdiction over it be-
 cause its business is so remote from the
 standpoint of interstate commerce.  I
 understand the Senator's position.
 I ask Senators to listen again to Mr.
 Kennedy's testimony before the Senate
 Commerce Committee. He said:
 We intentionally did not make the size of
 a business the criterion for coverage because
 we believe that discrimination by many small
 establishments imposes a cumulative burden
 on interstate commerce.
 I wish to make it clear that that was
 not my conclusion, but that Mr. Ken-
 nedy's conclusion.
 Based upon the interpretation of the
 Nation's highest legal official even before
 the bill is enacted, it is not too difficult
 to envision what this would mean to the
 lives, the property, the fortunes, and the
 very existence of the small restaurant
 owners, motel owners, theater owners,
 lodging house owners, and the like, who
 would allegedly be covered by this bill
 and forced to answer a charge that they
 were engaged in interstate commerce-
 not because of what they did-but be-
 cause they and other cumulatively were
 engaged in operations which collectively
 affected interstate commerce.
 The testimony of Mr. Kennedy evoked
 a pertinent comment from the distin-
 guished Senator from Oklahoma [Mr.
 MONRONEY], and I commend him for it.
 It was:
 Many of us are worried about the use of
 the interstate commerce clause will have on
 matters which have been for more than 170
 years thought to be within the realm of local
 control under our dual system of State and
 Federal Government, based on the doctrine
 that those powers which were not specifically
 granted to the Federal Government by the
 Constitution are reserved to the States.
 Let me also point out that Mr. Ken-
 nedy's testimony before the Commerce
 Committee revealed that he apparently
 does not recognize the distinction be-
 tween a statute which compels racial seg-
 regation and one which grants freedom
 of choice. When he appeared he placed
 in the record a document entitled "State
 or Local Laws Compelling Racial Segre-
 gations in Public Accommodations." Un-
 der  the  heading  "State  Segregation
 Statutes," he listed section 2046.5, Mis-
 sissippi Code of 1942.      He would have
 found, if he had bothered to completely
 read this statute, that it does not com-
 pel segregation.  To the contrary, it
 provides for freedom of choice and au-
 thorizes the owner of an establishment
 to sell to whom he pleases and, if he so
 desires, to refuse to sell to, wait upon or
 serve a person that he does not desire to
 do business with.
 This is a right which I believe is one
 which is inherent in the concept of indi-
 vidual liberty and which is protected by
 the fifth amendment.  This means, in
 my judgment, that the Federal Govern-
 ment cannot-even in pursuance of a
 nebulous concept of public welfare-pass
 a law dictating to the owner of an estab-
 lishment those customers he must serve.
 It means that a private owner has the
 basic liberty to choose, according to his
 own desires-be they arbitrary, capri-
 cious, or even irrational-the persons
 with whom he will do business.
 More and more, Mr. President, there
 has been an intrusion of national au-
 thority into matters which were hereto-
 fore conceded to be of purely local con-
 sideration and concern. It therefore be-
 comes increasingly imperative that the
 Federal  Government  respect  those
 principles which mark the line of de-
 marcation between Federal and State
 authority.  As we debate this new and
 radical proposal for a quantum jump in
 Federal intrusion, let us remember the
 words of the Court in Carter v. Carter
 Coal Co., 297 U.S. 238 (1936).  They
 were :
 Every journey to a forbidden end begins
 with the first step, and the danger of such a
 step by the Federal Government in the direc-
 tion of taking over the powers of the States
 is that the end of the journey may find the
 States so despoiled of their powers, or-what
 may amount to the same thing-so relieved
 of the responsibilities which possession of
 the power necessarily enjoins, as to reduce
 them to little more than geographical sub-
 divisions of the national domain.
 Let us not, in misguided but impas-
 sioned enthusiasm, undermine our great
 Constitution-the repository of all our
 liberties.  Instead let us dedicate our-
 selves to upholding the Principles upon
 which the Constitution was built. Let us
 reject title II and thereby insure that in-
 dividuals will have the right to say what
 they please, to associate with those whom
 they choose, to use their property as they
 see fit, and to operate their private busi-
 nesses in the manner which they desire.
 In closing, Mr. President, if I may be
 permitted to paraphrase a popular safety
 slogan, I would say this to my fellow Sen-
 ators: Be careful of what you do.  The
 constitution you destroy may be our own.
 Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. STENNIS.  I yield.
 Mr. SPARKMAN.  I compliment the
 Senator from Mississippi most heartily
 on an excellent presentation.

 Mr. SPARKMAN.  I was thinking as
 the Senator was speaking-and I wish
 given yesterday by my colleague, th
 senior 8Senator from Alabama.  Justic
 Brandeis was one of the all-time libera
 Justices, and a clear thinker.
 Justice Brandeis is quoted as saying J
 Experience should teach us to be most on
 our guard to protect liberty when the Gov-
 ernment's purposes are beneficient.
 Men born to freedom are naturally alert
 to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-
 minded rulers.  The greatest dangers to lib-
 erty lurk in insidious encroachment by men
 of zeal, well meaning, but without under-
 standing.
 Does the Senator from Mississippi
 think that is very real and pertinent at
 this time?
 Mr. STENNIS.  Very real; and it cer-
 tainly is applicable.  The Senator from
 Mississippi, along with the Senator from
 Alabama, I am sure, as, young men, or
 perhaps only boys, remember when Jus-
 tice Brandeis was nominated for the Su-
 preme Court of the United States.
 Mr. SPARKMAN. I do.
 Mr. STENNIS. I remember that Jus-
 tice Brandeis was opposed in the Senate
 on the ground that he had extremely
 liberal views.  Many people believed his
 views were not in keeping with our con-
 stitutional principles.  Justice Brandeis
 was known as a man of impeccable char-
 acter, lofty standards, and a great mind.
 He adorned the Court with great learn-
 ing and pointed out clearly the funda-
 mentals of our Constitution, our liber-
 ties, and our rights.
 I thank the Senator for making that
 very fine remark, which is an excellent
 closing.
 Mr. President, I suggest the absence

 THE UNITED STATES SHOULD GET
 OUT OF VIETNAM
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, the
 mess in Vietnam was inherited by Pres-
 ident Johnson.
 Over 10 years ago, after a careful study
 of the situation in Indochino, a report
 was made to the Senate outlining the
 following conditions for success in that
 troubled area of the world:
 The basic problem  which confronts  all
 three governments and particularly that of
 Vietnam is, to put clown firm roots in their
 respective populations. They will be able to
 do so only if they evolve in accord with pop-
 ular sentiment and they deal competently
 with such basic problems as illiteracy, pub-
 lic health, excessive population in the deltas,
 inequities in labor, and land tenure, and
 village and agricultural improvements.  Fi-
 nally, it'is essential that there be a constant
 rising of the ethical standards of government
 and a determination to use the armies, now
 the process of formation, strictly for national
 rather  than private purposes.   Failure in
 these fundamental responsibilities of self-
 government will result in the achievement of
 the shadow rather than the substance of in-
 dependence.  It could also mean the rapid
 reduction of the three nations to chaos and
 the subsequent intrusion of some new form
 of foreign domination from close at hand.
 The date of that report was October
 27, 1953, over 10 years ago.
 The person making the report was our
 very able and distinguished majority
 leader, the Senator from Montana [Mr.
 MANSFIELD],  whose  knowledge of that
 area of the world is most extensive. With
 respect to South Vietnam, the recom-
 mendations of the Senator from Mon-
 tana, were prophetic, but they went
 unheeded.
 History shows that the major causes of
 the deterioration, not only of the U.S.
 poistion, but also of the position of the
 South Vietnamese governments, have
 been actions by the South Vietnamese
 government contrary to the advice of-
 fered by the distinguished majority lead-
 er 10 years ago.
 The war in South Vietnam is not and
 never has been a U.S. war.  It is and
 must remain a fight to be fought and won
 by the people of South Vietnam the m-

 Mr. GRUENING.  Why have these
 been unavailing in bringing security to
 South Vietnam from the Communist-led
 attacks of the Vietcong?  As Sam Cas-
 tan, Look senior editor, wrote on January
 28, 1964:
 But in spite of our noble intent, our mas-
 sive aid and all the small acts of selfless hero-
 ism our men have performed in its behalf,
 South Vietnam's path to peace is cluttered
 by the debris of mistakes that America either
 made or endorsed.
 I ask unanimous consent that the en-
 tire article by Mr. Caston entitled "Viet-
 nam's Two Wars" be printed in full in the
 RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 1.)
 Mr. GRUENING.  It is to the past
 then, rather than to the events of recent
 days and months, that we must look for
 the answer to the "why" of the present
 dilemma of the United States in South
 Vietnam.
 When President Eisenhower took office
 in January 1953, the war in Indochina
 was not going well.  It was a French war,
 fought with French troops as well as the
 troops of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
 U.S. military and economic aid had been
 going to the French in ever-increasing
 amounts as the drain of maintaining a
 fighting force of a quarter of a million
 men and of supporting three Indochinese
 national armies numbering 120,000 men
 increased.
 In reviewing the situation on January
 27, 1963-6 days after taking office-

 cause the French who are doing much of the
 fighting there are making great effort and
 that effort subtracts just that much from
 the capacity of their building a European
 army and making the contribution which
 otherwise they could be expected to make.
 In terms of fighting men, France was
 there as the only major power on the
 scene because the three countries had
 been and were French colonies.  While
 they had been given independence in
 1949, the independence was with respect
 to internal affairs only.  They were still
 within the French Union and France had
 an obligation to them to help fight the
 Communist-supported internal fighting
 they faced.
 But the long supply lines and the fierce
 lighting  continued  to  sap  French
 strength.
 Then came the tragic events at Dien-
 bienphu in March 1954.                       The Commu-
 nists under Ho Chi Minh attacked that
 fortress in force.
 Those were the days of brinkmanship,
 of massive retaliation and of the domino
 theory-policies proclaimed b y Secre-
 tary of State John Foster Dulles.
 While the fighting was taking place,
 Gen. Paul Ely, French chief of staff,
 flew to Washington to inform the Eisen-
 hower administration that the French
 could not hold out much longer and
 needed direct U.S. intervention.
 This request precipitated a behind the
 scenes struggle at the highest levels of
 Government circles both here in Wash-
 ington and in London.
 While General Ely was still in town,
 Secretary of State Dulles held a news
 conference in which he stated that what
 military aid was given to France was a
 military matter and that "if there are
 further requests of that kind that are
 made, I have no doubt that our military
 or defense people will attempt to meet
 them."
 I ask unanimous consent that the text
 of Secretary Dulles' news conference on
 March 23, 1954, be printed in full in the
 RECORD, at the conclusion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 2.)
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. Fletcher Kne-
 bel, well-known Washington correspond-
 ent, in an article in Look on February
 8, 1955, gave a forceful account of ma-
 neuverings in high places in Washington
 and London in those fateful, early days
 of 1954 when the United States stood on
 the brink of an all-out invasion of Viet-
 nam.
 According to Mr. Kriebel, Adm. Arthur
 W. Radford, then Chairman of the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff, advocated an immediate
 airstrike from carriers; Gen. Matthew
 B. Ridgway, Army Chief of Staff, was
 opposed since he believed that such a
 strike could lead to all-out intervention;
 Admiral Carney, Chief of Naval Opera-
 tions, and Gen. Nathan F. Twining, Air
 Force Chief of Staff, felt that, while an
 airstrike might help the French at
 Dienbienphu, more force would be need-
 ed to win the fight in Vietnam.
 President Eisenhower, according to
 Knebel, agreed with Admiral Radford on
 two conditions: That the United States
 be joined in the action by other allies;
 namely, Great Britain; and that con-
 gressional approval be obtained for the
 action. Since neither condition could be
 met, the United States moved back safely
 from the brink.
 I ask unanimous consent that that
 portion of Mr. Knebel's article dealing
 with Indochina be printed in the RECORD
 at the conclusion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 3.)
 Mr. GRUENING.  Dienbienphu fell on
 May 7, 1954.
 At Genera on July 21, 1954, delegates
 from Great Britain and the U.S.S.R.,
 France, the United States, Communist
 China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and the
 Vietminh came to a settlement to resolve
 the fighting in Vietnam. The main pro-
 visions of the agreement concerning Viet-
 nam were as follows:
 First. Vietnam was to be partitioned
 along the 17th parallel into North and
 South Vietnam.
 Second. Regulations were imposed on
 foreign military personnel and on in-
 creased armaments.
 Third. Countrywide elections, leading
 to the reunification of North and South
 Vietnam, were to be held by July 20, 1956.
 Fourth. An   International  Control
 Commission-ICC-was to be established
 to supervise the implementation of the
 agreements.
 The United States was not a signatory
 of the agreement, but issued a statement,
 unilaterally, stating that-
 . It (1) will refrain from the threat or the
 use of force to disturb the Geneva Agree-
 ments; (2) would view any renewal of the
 aggression in violation of the aforesaid agree-
 ments with grave concern and as seriously
 threatening international peace and secur-
 ity," and (3) shall continue to seek to achieve
 unity through free elections, supervised by
 the U.N. to insure that they are conducted
 fairly.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?,
 Mr. GRUENING.  I yield with pleas-
 ure.
 Mr. MORSE. I may say to the Sena-
 tor from Alaska that I had planned to
 sit through every word of his speech.  I
 had expected it would come earlier this
 afternoon.  Unfortunately, I must go to
 an official conference.  I assure the Sen-
 ator from Alaska that I have read every
 word of his speech.  I would have the
 RECORD today show that the senior Sena-
 tor from Oregon thinks this is one of the
 great speeches in this session of the Con-
 gress on foreign policy.  I associate my-
 self with every word of the speech.
 I am awaiting my Government's an-
 swer to it.  In my judgment, there is no
 answer to the Senator's speech.  There is
 no justification for killing a single Amer-
 ican boy in South Vietnam.  It is about
 time the American people awakened to
 what is going on in South Vietnam and
 recognized that South Vietnam is beyond
 the perimeter  of American  defense.
 There is no justification for murdering
 a single American boy in South Vietnam,
 for the issue has now become one of
 murder.
 Everyone knows that if we got into a
 war with Russia or Red China it would
 4659
 be a nuclear war, not a conventional
 war.  I do not know what we are doing
 over there with a conventional program.
 Furthermore, as the Senator pointed
 out, where are our alleged allies in South
 Vietnam?  In contrast with South Ko-
 rea, where are our friends there?  So
 long as we are willing to pay 99 percent
 of the bill and spill American blood, they
 will be satisfied.
 If my Government wants to make this
 an issue across the land, I am willing to
 have it become an issue; but I do not in-
 tend to vote for a single dollar for opera-
 tions in South Vietnam or to give sup-
 port to the American Secretary of De-
 fense who is bespeaking American for-
 eign policy with no right to do so.
 South Vietnam is not worth the life of
 a single American boy.  I say to my ad-
 ministration that I have no intention of
 giving any support whatsoever to contin-
 uing the cost in blood and money for
 operations in South Vietnam that can-
 not be justified on the ground of Ameri-
 can defense or on any other ground.
 The Senator from Alaska has set forth
 the issue in his speech in terms so un-
 answerable that the American people
 have a right to say to the administration,
 "What is your answer?" I wait for the
 answer.
 Mr. GRUENING. I thank the Senator
 for his helpful comment.
 Within 2 months, on September 8,
 1954, the Governments of Australia,
 France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the
 Philippines, Thailand, the United King-
 dom and the United States signed a col-
 lective security pact at Manila, known as
 the Southeast Asia Collective Defense
 Treaty.  Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam
 were not parties to this treaty, but by a
 simultaneous protocol to the treaty all
 the parties to the original treaty agreed
 to include the territories of those three
 nations in the territory protected by the
 treaty from "armed attack and counter
 subversive activities directed from with-
 out against their territorial integrity and
 political stability."
 The United States made it clear to all
 the signatories that the type of aggres-
 sion it considered itself bound to prevent
 was Communist aggression.  As Secre-
 tary of State Dulles explained it:
 We stipulated on behalf of the United
 States, however, that the only armed attack
 in that area which we would regard as neces-
 sarily dangerous to our peace and security
 would be a Communist armed attack.
 In his address to the Nation on Sep-
 tember 15, 1954, explaining the action
 taken at Manila, Secretary Dulles first
 reiterated his concept of the domino
 theory of possible events in southeast
 Asia in the following words :
 Any significant expansion of the Commu-
 nist world, would, indeed, be a danger to
 the United States, because International com-
 munism thinks in terms of ultimately us-
 ing its power position against the United
 States.   Therefore, we could honestly say,
 using the words that President Monroe used
 in proclaiming his Doctrine, that Commu-
 nist armed aggression in southeast Asia
 would, in fact, endanger our peace and se-
 curity and call for counteraction on our past.
 Secretary of State Dulles had ex-
 plained the domino theory at an earlier

 news conference on May 11, 1954, in the
 following words: Asked if the plan for
 collective security could succeed if one
 or more of its segments were lost to the
 Communists, Secretary Dulles replied:
 The situation in that area, as we found
 it, was that it was subject to the so-called
 domino theory. . You mean that if one went,
 another would go?  We are trying to change
 it so that would not be the case. That is the
 whole theory of collective security. You gen-
 erally have a whole series of countries which
 can be picked up one by one.  That is the
 whole theory of the North Atlantic Treaty.
 As the nations come Together, then the
 domino theory, so-called, ceases to apply.
 And what we are trying to do is create a situ-
 ation in southeast Asia where the domino
 situation will not apply.  And'while I see it
 has been said that I felt that southeast Asia
 could be secured even without perhaps Viet-
 nam, Laos, and Cambodia, I do not want
 for a minute to underestimate the impor-
 tance of the countries. nor do I want for
 a minute to give the impression that we be-
 lieve that they are going to be lost or that
 we have given up trying to prevent their
 being lost.  On the contrary, we recognize
 that they are extremely important and that
 the problem of saving southeast Asia is far
 more difficult if they are lost.  But I do not
 want to give the impression, either, that if
 events that we could not control and which
 we do not anticipate should lead to their
 being lost, that we would consider the whole
 situation hopeless, and we would give up in
 despair. We do not give up in despair.  Also,
 we do not give up Vietnam, Laos, or Cam-
 bodia.
 In his nationwide address on Septem-
 ber 15, 1954, on the Southeast Asia
 Treaty, Secretary of State Dulles also
 expounded his massive retaliation theo-
 ries of how to contain communism any-
 where in the world, anytime, at the least
 cost:
 . We considered at Manila how to imple-
 ment the treaty.  One possibility was to cre-
 ate a joint military force.  However, I ex-
 plained that the U.S. responsibilities were
 so vast and so far flung that we believed
 that we would serve best, not by earmarking
 forces for particular areas of the Far East,
 but by developing the deterrent of mobile
 striking  power,  plus  strategically  placed
 reserves.
 This viewpoint was accepted.  Thus, the
 treaty will not require us to make material
 changes in our military plans.  These plans
 already call for our maintaining at all times
 powerful naval and air forces in the West-
 ern Pacific capable of striking at any aggres-
 sor by means and at places of our choosing.
 The deterrent power we thus create can pro-
 tect many, as effectively as it protects one.
 I ask unanimous consent that a sum-
 mary of events in Vietnam from the time
 of the Geneva agreements as prepared by
 the Library of Congress be printed in the
 RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 4.)
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, by
 January 1, 1955, U.S. aid began to flow
 directly to South Vietnam and on Febru-
 ary 12, 1955, a U.S. military assistance
 advisory group took over the training of
 the South Vietnamese army. Previously,
 U.S. aid had been given through France.
 In October 1955, the Eisenhower ad-
 ministration picked Ngo Dinh Diem to
 rule South Vietnam.
 There may be some room for disagree-
 ment as to whether Diem was a poor
 choice for the job to begin with or
 whether, after having come to power, the
 thirst for more and more power on his
 part and on the part of his many rela-
 tives, whom he placed in high govern-
 mental posts, became insatiable.
 Seven months before the former em-
 peror, Bao Dai, was deposed on October
 23, 1955, in a national referendum in
 which Diem received 98 percent of the
 votes, Diem met and greatly impressed
 Secretary of State Dulles. In a nation-
 wide broadcast on March 8, 1955, Secre-
 tary Dulles said:
 I was much impressed by Prime Minister
 Diem.  He is a true patriot, dedicated to in-
 dependence and to the enjoyment by his
 people of political and religious freedoms. He
 now has a program for agricultural reform.
 If it is effectively executed, it will both assist
 in the resettlement of the refugees and pro-
 vide his country with a sounder agricultural
 system.  I am convinced that his Govern-
 ment deserves the support which the United
 States is giving to help to create an efficient,
 loyal military force and sounder economic
 conditions.
 Ngo Dinh Diem ruled South Vietnam
 from October 23, 1955, until the coup of
 November 2, 1963, deposed him. As the
 guerrilla fighting intensified through the
 years, so did the mismanagement and
 corruption of the Diem government. It
 became increasingly oppressive, tram-
 pling the rights of individuals and ignor-
 ing the necessity for economic reforms to
 benefit the people.
 There is no room for disagreement
 concerning the fact that the United
 States condoned or ignored actions by
 Diem and his ruling relatives calculated
 to antagonize the people on whose sup-
 port any stable South Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment must rest-or fall.
 As Jerry A. Rose stated in the New
 Republic on October 12, 1963:
 For some reason, diplomats, soldiers in the
 field, and politicians in Washington are un-
 able to grasp the importance of the people.
 While forever raising wet fingers to the wind
 of public opinion in the United States, the
 policymakers appear to operate on the belief
 that Asian people have no opinions, and
 even if they did have an opinion, It would
 carry no weight.  A good Gallup poll would
 easily disprove the former proposition, and
 history has proved time and again the fal-,
 lacy of the latter.
 I ask unanimous consent to have Mr.
 Rose's article entitled "Dead End in
 Vietnam" be printed in full in the RECORD
 at the conclusion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 5.)
 Mr. GRUENING. The recent spate of
 optimistic announcements from the Pen-
 tagon on how well the war in South Viet-
 nam is going-despite contrary reports
 from trained observers on the scene-
 only carries on a tradition begun in the
 earliest days of U.S. participation in the
 fighting in Vietnam.
 Thus, in July 1956, in the face of con-
 tinued Vietcong sabotage and virulent
 propaganda, Vice President Nixon ad-
 dressing the first Constituent Assembly
 of South Vietnam, stated that "the mili-
 tant march of communism has been
 halted." But by the middle of the next
 year, Vietcong guerrilla bands stepped
 up their attacks, bombing U.S., MAAG
 and USIS installations and attacking
 settlements near Saigon.
 Mr. Nixon's overoptimistic statement
 in July 1956 is on a par with his state-
 ment in October 1960, when he stated:
 As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated
 over and over again that it was essential dur-
 ing that period that the United States make
 it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina
 falling under Communist domination.  Now,
 as a result of our taking the strong stand that
 we did, the civil war there was ended, and to-
 day we do have a strong free bastion there.
 Vietcong guerrilla activities, reinforced
 by arms and men from North Vietnam,
 increased greatly during Diem's regime.
 So did corruption and the oppression
 of the people.
 As Castan states in his article already
 referred to:
 To his [Diem's] personal credit, he alleged-
 ly managed, again with American aid, to
 amass a personal fortune of some $50 million
 during the same period.  Diem changed-too
 slowly for our then Ambasador Frederick J.
 Nolting, an intimate friend of both Diem and
 his charming sister-in-law, Mme. Ngo Dinh
 Nhu, to notice.  Too slowly for Gen. Paul D.
 Harkins, boss of our military-assistance com-
 mand, to notice.                                                                                                                                    No one, in fact, noticed un-
 til we found that we had been duped into
 complicity, and were compounding by assent
 the mistakes of Diem and his family.
 In the face of increasingly serious
 guerrilla activity, the so-called strategic
 hamlet plan was instituted in 1961.  It
 was copied from Malaya, but served only
 to make it easier for the guerrillas to
 capture arms and supplies.   It was a
 failure also as a means of isolating
 Diem's opponents.
 Two accounts illustrate the hows and
 the whys of the failure of the strategic
 hamlet plan:
 The first is related in the article before
 referred to by Castan:
 Plei Ia Miah, one of the hamlets, is an ex-
 ample.  "The soldiers forced us out of our
 huts," said the village chief, shortly before
 the November coup d'etat, "and told us that
 a fortified village was ready for us in, the
 valley. Can we take our land?' we asked.
 Two  men  refused  to  leave  our  ancestral
 home and were shot.  It took us 60 days to
 march here.  We have no land to farm, and
 if the Government doesn't give us food soon,
 we'll have to sell the pigs and buffalo we
 brought with us.  The Vietcong come at night
 for our weapons.  We give them the weapons.
 Why should we die for weapons?"
 The second is from a Reporter article
 by Bernard Fall in the October 24, 1963.
 issue. I ask unanimous consent to have
 the article printed in the RECORD at the
 conclusion of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 6.)
 Mr. GRUENING.  Reading from the
 Fall article:
 There is not one plantation that has not
 been attacked or partly pillaged several times
 by the Vietcong during the past 5 years, and
 which has not seen several of its French
 personnel kidnaped and held for ransom or
 killed.  During  the  Indochina  war,  the
 plantations had been allowed to arm them-
 selves and maintained militia forces at their
 own expense.     When Ngo Dinh Diem came
 to power he ordered all plantations disarmed
 and they thus became military liabilities.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                March 10
 lent analysis of the Vietnam situation a
 few weeks ago and for his plea for less
 rigidity in our policy in Indochina; he
 stated:
 It is important, however, in  our Asian
 policies, that we strive to achieve flexibility,
 flexibility which our policies in recent years
 have failed to have.  We cannot allow our-
 selves to be frozen forever with a rigid policy
 hoaiy with age.  In Asia as elsewhere we
 must be willing to discuss anything with
 anybody who is willing to discuss in a
 rational and responsible manner.  We are
 the greatest power on earth and we have no
 need to fear Red China and no need to fear
 negotiations.
 I also wish to commend the able senior
 Senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE] for his
 splendid speech last week on this same
 topic.  Senator   MORSE   pointed  out
 cogently that-
 American unilateral participation in the
 war in South Vietnam cannot be justified

 east Asia to be beyond the perimeter of U.S.
 defense.  Southeast Asia is not essential to
 U.S. defense. Southeast Asia may very well be
 essential to the defense of some of our
 allies, but where are they?  They ran out
 on us.
 And more pointedly, in response to a
 question from Senator ELLENDER what
 Senator MORSE would advise we should
 do in South Vietnam, Senator MORSE
 answered with his usual forthrightness:
 We should never have gone in.  We should
 never have stayed in.  We should get out.
 stubbornly when a decade of bitter ex-
 perience has shown us that the expendi-
 ture of blood and treasure has resulted
 in failure?
 Shall we not, if taught anything by this
 tragic experience, consider that of the
 three alternatives: First, to continue this
 bloody and wanton stalemate; second, to
 go in "all out" for a full-scale invasion
 and the certain sacrifice of far more lives
 and a scarcely less doubtful outcome;
 or, third, to pull out with the knowledge
 that the game was not worth the candle.
 This last is the best of these choices.
 in the event of determining on that
 last and least unhappy alternative, we
 shall no doubt be told by some that the
 United States will lose face in Asia.
 I doubt whether we should lose face,
 whatever that may mean.  But if it be
 so interpreted by some whose opinion
 should give us small concern, I say better
 to lose face than to lose the life of an-
 other American boy, or a score, or an-
 other 200 of them, doomed in varying
 numbers as long as we stay on.
 President Johnson, let me repeat, in-
 herited this mess.-  It was not of his
 making.  As he approaches the difficult
 task of making the necessarily hard deci-
 as South Vietnam, whose people are so
 reluctant to fend for themselves.  Let
 us keep on, by all means, supplying them
 with arms.  Let us continue to give them
 the means if they wish to use them.
 But not our men.
 The time has come to cease the use-
 less and senseless losses of American
 lives in an area not essential to the
 security of the United States.
 Only yesterday the report came in
 of two more American fighting men
 killed in Vietnam.
 Last Wednesday the report was made
 that three American officers had been
 killed there.  Part of the UPI story reads
 as follows :
 Two U.S. officers were killed yesterday in
 separate battles  with  the  Vietcong,  mili-
 tary sources reported.                                                                                                 A U.S. Navy officer
 was killed yesterday in a helicopter crash.
 One of the Army officers died as he at-
 tempted to rally Government paratroopers
 for an assault on a Communist position near
 the Cambodian border.
 There were few details on the death of
 the  other  Army  officer.  Reports reaching
 Saigon said he    was killed in a battle at
 Trung Lap village 27 miles northwest of
 Saigon.
 It is obvious from this story, as it has
 been for some time now, that the United
 States so-called training mission is actu-
 ally engaged in fighting the Vietcong in
 a war which the South Vietnamese are
 themselves reluctant to fight.
 I urge the President to take steps to
 disengage the United States immediately
 from this engagement.
 All our military should immediately
 berelieved of combat assignments. All
 military dependents should be returned
 home at once. A return of the troops to
 our own shores should begin.
 I also urge the President to go to the
 American people and explain in detail
 how the United States got involved in
 Vietnam; when we got involved in Viet-
 nam, and why we are getting out of
 there.
 I sincerely hope that President John-
 son will heed the advice of our distin-
 guished majority leader, Mr. MANSFIELD,
 and others in this body, as knowledge-
 able as Senators MORSE, ELLENDER, and
 others reassess the Dulles doctrine of
 sions with respect to the problems in
 South Vietnam, problems created long
 before he was President, he should feel
 no compunction to act in such a way as
 to justify past actions, past decisions and
 past mistakes.  He should feel entirely
 free to act in such a manner and to make
 such decisions as are calculated best to
 serve the interests of the United States
 and the free world-a world changed
 greatly from the time President Eisen-
 hower and Secretary Dulles initiated our
 southeast Asia policies.
 Would South Vietnam go Communist
 if we get out?  Probably, but it will
 doubtless do so in any event.  What
 would the loss of a million men, or 2 mil-
 lion, or 5 million matter to the jam-
 packed nation of 700 million that is
 mainland China, that can and will un-
 concernedly pour its cannon fodder into
 an adjacent, long-coveted area, and
 peopled with its fellow Asiatics.  Their
 lives mean nothing to their own bloody
 rulers who have liquidated vast numbers
 of their own.  But our American boys'
 And Senator ELLENDER seconded that
 clear-and in my judgment thoroughly
 correct and realistic counsel-by saying:
 I have been advocating such P. course of
 action.  After my last visit there, I again
 stated that we should never have gone in
 there and that we should get out.  My advice
 was never heeded.  That is my advice today.
 Had this advice of Senator ELLENDER
 given some time ago, now repeated by
 him and reaffirmed by Senator MORSE
 been heeded 200 precious American lives
 would not have been lost.  These are far
 more important than the billions of dol-
 lars we have now wasted in seeking
 vainly in this remote jungle to shore up
 selfserving corrupt dynasts or their self-
 imposed successors and a people that has
 conclusively demonstrated that it has
 no will to save itself.
 I consider the life of one American
 worth more than this putrid mess.  I
 consider that every additional life that
 is sacrificed in this forlorn venture a
 tragedy. Someday-not distant-if this
 sacrificing continues, it will be de-
 nounced as a crime.
 I would ask my colleagues and indeed
 American fathers and mothers this ques-
 tion:
 If your drafted son is sent to Vietnam

 cluttered by the debris of mistakes that
 America either made or indorsed.
 Ngo Dinh Diem was one.
 In 1954, after an 8-year losing war to pre-
 serve Its colonial holdings In Indochina,
 France took the knockout punch at Dien-
 bienphu.  The United States had a heavy
 interest in Southeast Asian developments.
 We had underwritten fully 60 percent of
 France's military costs-about $2 billion-
 and were considering direct military inter-
 vention when the end Game.  France sued
 the victorious Vietminh-a largely Commu-
 nist guerrilla force led by a wily old Asian
 Marxist, Ho Chi Minh-for peace, and the
 Geneva Conference of 1954 divided the former
 French colony into four independent states:
 North Vietnam, led by fio Chi Minh- neu-
 tralist Cambodia, Laos,, and pro-Western
 South Vietnam.  The West knew that Ho
 Chi Minh had for years been preparing his
 share of the spoils for self-sufficiency.   A
 civil service was ready, factory sites were
 laid out, teachers and industrial workers
 were trained, and a communications system
 as already buzzing messages to Peiping.
 The West also knew that South Vietnam had
 been left unprepared by France, and that
 with all the help we might give the new
 nation, its first, shaky steps toward demo-
 cratic Independence would be menaced by
 Vietminh cells left behind for purposes of
 disruption.  We badly needed a man in Viet-
 nam, and Diem was in.
 Descended from a family of central Viet-
 namese mandarins, Ngo Dinh Diem was an
 ascetic Catholic bachelor who had once lived
 in, .a Lakewood, N.J., monastery.  As a civil
 administrator under the French, he had en-
 joyed a certain measure of popular support.
 Most important, he was an avowed anti-
 Communist. That was it,  Secretary of State
 John Foster Dulles picked him, Senator MIKE
 MANSFIELD  endorsed him, Francis Cardinal
 Spellman praised him, Vice President Rich-
 ard               M.  Nixon  liked  him,  and President
 Dwight D. Eisenhower OK'd him.
 ,Although 80 percent of South Vietnam
 was, and is, Buddhist, Diem's Catholicism
 was good politics in the United States.  The
 Catholic Bishops' Relief Fund and the Cath-
 olicRelief Service assumed major roles in the
 resettlement of refugees streaming out of
 predominantly Catholic provinces of North
 Vietnam.  Cardinal Spellman kept shower-
 ing praise on Diem and his brother, Arch-
 bishop Ngo Dinh Thuc. 'At this point, some
 American Catholics were beginning to vote
 Republican anyway, and the Eisenhower ad-
 ministration, with a wary eye toward John
 F. Kennedy in 1960, stressed its own role In
 creating an Asian haven for Catholics.
 Out in the Vietnamese boondocks,, how-
 ever, Diem's catholicism didn't mean a thing.
 Both America and Saigon were remote from
 the peasant huts along the muddy canals of
 South Vietnam, where 80 percent of the
 population  lives,  and  the  nation's  real
 strength lies. It was not religion that turned
 the people against Diem, and, aside from the
 extra aid it may have brought in, it was
 certainly not religion that helped him sus-
 tain the nation through those early, critical
 years.  Diem managed, with half a billion
 dollars per year in American aid and his own
 shill, to keep South Vietnam afloat in the
 flood of propaganda and subversion let loose
 by the old Vietminh cells-now called Viet
 cong.
 That much was to Diem's administrative
 credit.  To his personal credit, he allegedly
 managed, again with American aid, to amass
 a personal fortune of some $50 million dur-
 ing the same period.  Diem changed-too
 slowly for our then Ambassador, Frederick J.
 Nolting, Jr., an intimate friend of both Diem
 and his charming sister-in-law, Mme. Ngo
 Dinh Nhu, to notice. Too slowly for Gen.
 Paul D. Harkins, boss of our military assist-
 ance command, to notice.  No one, in
 noticed until we found that we had been
 duped into complicity, and were compound-
 ing by assent the mistakes of Diem and his
 family.
 In 1958, the Vietcong turned from subver-
 sion and propaganda to violent guerrilla in-
 surgency.  "And Diem," says a Vietnamese
 Army lieutenant, who was later called away
 from his post in the field to police Saigon
 during a martial-law period, "made things
 so easy for them that every time the sun
 rose on South Vietnam, the Vietcong was
 stronger than they had been the night be-
 fore."
 Diem installed virtually all of his relatives
 in key positions, and insured their tenure by
 rigged elections. Family friends became dis-
 trict and province chiefs; their sons received
 commissions and cushy Army spots.  What-
 ever dissidence this caused among the popu-
 lation was left to Diem's brother, Nhu, to
 handle, through  18 separate secret police
 agencies and the Vietnamese Special Forces,
 which  were  not a branch of  the regular
 militia, but in effect a private police force.
 Under cover of .the 1961 rainy season, Viet-
 cong forces were bolstered by heavy rein-
 forcements, along the famous "Ho Chi Minh
 trail." Vietcong raids became more frequent
 and more ferocious.  By this time, corruption
 in Saigon was well known throughout the
 provinces.  The Ngo's, influenced by Malaya's
 experience, devised a plan to contend with
 increased guerrilla activity and, at the same
 time, contain pockets of internal dissidence.
 It was called the strategic hamlet program,
 and it had still another benefit.  For public
 relations,  the  fortified  villages could  be
 passed off as a reminder of the pioneer stock-
 ades of early America.                                                                                   This device would
 bring in still more aid money.
 It worked for everyone-everyone being
 Diem and the Vietcong.      Diem got his money,
 the Vietcong got clearly marked and easily
 taken resupply points for food, weapons, and
 ammunition.  But it didn't work for the
 people.  Plei Is, Miah, one of the hamlets, is
 an example. "The soldiers forced us out of
 our huts," said the village chief, shortly be-
 fore the November coup d'etat, "and told us
 that a fortified village was ready for us in
 the valley.  'Can we take our land?' we asked.
 Two men refused to leave our ancestral home,
 and were shot.  It took us 60 days to march
 here.  We have no land to farm, and if the
 government doesn't give us food soon, we'll
 have to sell the pigs and buffalo we brought
 with us. The Vietcong come at night for our
 weapons.  We give them the weapons.  Why
 should we die for Weapons?"
 Buddhists, who comprise the great bulk of
 South Vietnam's population, became special
 targets of Nhu's secret police last summer.
 Like the university students who followed
 them into the torture cells and concentra-
 tion camps ringing Saigon and Rue, they
 were too cohesive, too vocal to be allowed
 freedom.  South Vietnam owes them a pro-
 found debt, for their protests, along with
 Madame Nhu's arrogant tirades about "Bud-
 dhist barbecues" and "American adventur-
 ers," focused world attention on the police-
 state measures Diem had adopted.   The
 United Nations sent a special,conunission to
 investigate religious persecution in South
 Vietnam, but it arrived too late. On Novem-
 ber 2, 9 days after the commission reached
 Saigon, Diem fell, and a wildly jubilant
 Saigon crowd carried newly released Buddhist
 monks on their Shoulders through a free
 city.
 The coup d'etat of last November was en-
 tirely predictable, despite the contentions
 of  certain  American  journalists,  notably
 Joseph Alsop and Marguerite Higgins, and
 the official word from the Public Informa-
 tion Office of our Military Assistance Com-
 mand Vietnam (MAC-V)  that Diem was
 winning the war and enjoying popular sup-
 4663
 port.   "You  Americans  wouldn't  under-
 stand," said one coup leader.   "Diem be-
 trayed us in the critical hour of our fight
 against communism.   We had to kill him."
 Added another, "Diem started a second war-
 himself, his family, and his American allies
 against the people. That was the important
 war as far as he was concerned.  In another
 month, the Vietcong would have controlled
 every province in the country."
 What sort of war have Diem's mistakes,
 and ours for allowing them, left us to face in
 the bloody showdown ahead?
 South Vietnam's new military government
 estimates that hart-core Vietcong guerrillas
 total upward of 35,000 men, with around
 100,000  part-time  irregulars  joining  them
 each night.  Nearly all are armed with the
 best weapons America has been able to man-
 ufacture. a                                                                                                                                        19 The homemade rifles they began
 are used as drill weapons for
 recruits.  The  number  of      Vietcong rose
 sharply last year, when Diem's political in-
 terference in the military campaign was at
 its height, and popular resentment against
 the regime was sharpest. "Diem hated large
 casualty reports," relates one ARVN (Army
 of the Republic of Vietnam) colonel.  "Our
 orders were to surround the enemy on three
 sides, and let the main body out to avoid
 pitched battles.  We had to head back for
 the barracks at dusk, even if it meant letting
 a boxed-in group we could easily handle get
 away."
 These  factors,   combined  with  outright
 neglect in some provinces, and the existence
 of isolated and vulnerable "paper hamlets,"
 to which Diem could point as proof that he
 was "showing the flag," have so strengthened
 the Vietcong that they no longer operate in
 marauding cutthroat gangs.  "They've got
 regular battalions," says one American ad-
 viser, "with heavy-weapons sections, radio
 communication-the works."   Says a chop-
 per pilot, "I half expect to see a Vietcong jet
 fighter waiting for me every time I go up."
 The most critical factor in any guerrilla
 war is still popular support. The Vietcong,
 for all their newly gained strength, do not
 have the staying power in any one area to set
 up hospitals, rest areas, training camps, etc.
 In many areas, they don't need them, for
 every hut is a place to eat and rest and have
 wounds  treated.  "Five  miles  down  the
 canal, there's a Vietcong village," says a U.S.
 Army ,,Special Forces sergeant at Tan Phu.
 "There are never any men around when we
 come through, but every hut's got a Vietcong
 flag on the wall, and there's a school with
 paper Vietcong pennants on every desk.  I
 knew this was a strong Vietcong area, but
 the first time I hear about a Vietcong PTA,
 I'm getting the hell out."
 We are faced, then, with a dedicated enemy
 grown strong on an endless string of mis-
 takes we  endorsed, fighting on his own
 ground and calling the tune.  None of this
 has changed substantially since the coup.
 The new government will need months to
 replace commanders, district, province and
 village chiefs, and Institute the civil reforms
 that will give South Vietnam its first real
 chance for democracy.  Meanwhile, as sol-
 diers and peasants wait to see how the new
 government will go, some of the old habits
 remain.  And the Vietcong have taken every
 opportunity during this transitional period
 to strike and strike again.  In the 4 weeks
 following the coup, Vietcong activity rose 50
 percent.
 South Vietnam's uppermost need is to re-
 gain the military initiative.  No one in the
 new government deludes himself with the
 notion that we are winning the war, or that
 we even have the balance to jab back when
 we are hit.  The common people of South
 Vietnam are tired after 20 years of fighting
 (against  Japanese  Invaders,  French  colo-
 nialists                                                                                                                                           and now   Communist    guerillas).
 The new government must show its will to
 prosecute the war until a workable peace is
 in sight.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE
 How well the regime does depends upon
 the unity of the junta.  Behind a facade of
 strength, strains are appearing among the
 14 generals who wrested power from Diem.
 Most are loyal to Gen. D,uong Van Minh,
 chairman of 'the revolutionary council, but
 some observers see the youngest general, 3&-
 year-old Ton That Dinh, as a comer.  fie is
 an ambitious man who assumed nearly all
 the credit for the coup's success, and his
 high personal ambitions remain unsatisfied.
 It was Dinh's weight that swung crucial
 troops against Diem.  Immediately after the
 Presidential palace surrendered, he promoted
 himself from two- to three-star general.  "I
 was the coup," says Dinh. "It was my plan-
 ning,   my  courage,                   my  leadership    that
 brought Diem down.    I did it for the peo-
 ple-not for money, not for another star.                      I
 have no personal ambitions," To prove that
 it believed him, the revolutionary council
 named Dinh Minister of Security, a consid-
 erably lesser post than he may have planned
 for himself.
 If dissension is actually developing within
 the provisional  military  government,  the
 war effort may be adversely affected.    So
 may the peace effort, if the generals decide,
 and if the United States, which pays their
 salaries, agrees, that tile war cannot be won,
 and some sort of neutralism, such as that
 envisaged by France's President Charles de
 Gaulle, is the best way out of a bad thing.
 As long as there is shooting, the American
 involvement will, of course, continue.  The
 -removal of over 1,000 Americans last month
 was characterized by one personnel officer as
 "trimming some of the fat off our Saigon
 surplus.  Those boys had nothing to do but
 create a problem for the MP's, and stuff
 more money into Saigon's black market."
 Our field forces stand at their highest
 level of 2,700 officers and men.  There will
 be more American fatalities, more wounded
 and more captured.  And more, too, of the
 weirdly funny tales that are part of any war.
 There was the. young Army pilot who, shook
 up by the presence of Gen. Paul Harkins as
 a passenger, forgot to drop his wheels for
 a landing.   Harkins climbed out of the
 wreckage, saying, "That's one way to stop
 the damned thing."  And those two  ser-
 geants  in Pleiku who measured their                  re-
 maining time in Vietnam by the number of
 weekly malaria pills they still had to take.
 "I'm down to 22 pills," boasted one to the
 other.  "How many pills do you have left?"
 Thanks in part to our blunders, to our old
 policy of seeing, hearing and thinking no
 evil  CC anyone who labels himself "anti-
 Communist," and to our love of bucking
 reality, a tired, bloodied nation is approach-
 ing its critical hour.
 How many pills does South Vietnam have
 left?

 AN INTERVIEW WITH TON THAT DINH
 Question. General Dinh (full name pro-
 nounced Tone Tuck Dinn), what made you
 turn against Diem?  You are the general
 who led his August pagoda raids against the
 Buddhists and ruled Saigon as military gov-
 ernor when he declared martial law.
 Answer. Diem did not order the raids.  It
 was his brother Nhu who ordered me, against
 the Buddhists, and as a soldier, I had to fol-
 low.  They must have thought me a fool,
 those two.  The very morning of the coup,
 I visited them in the Presidential Palace. I
 asked Diem how his head cold was coming.
 I was very pleasant. Then Imustered troops
 against them.
 Question. What made you decide to join,
 in a coup d'etat?
 Answer. As a soldier, my resentment was
 building up for a long time.  I was in the
 French colonial army as a private, and later
 became a cadet at St. Cyr, the French equiv-
 alent of your West Point.  I have attended
 your General Staff College at Fort Leaven-
 worth, Kans.  I did not like being told how
 to fight the Vietcong.  I did not like seeing
 them win because of Diem's and Nhu's inter-
 ference.  The last straw came when the na-
 tional elections of last October were fixed. I
 knew then that Diem intended to stay in
 power, to keep interfering and never to in-
 stitute reforms.
 Question. Which reforms, specifically?
 Answer. He had promised to institute re-
 ligious freedoms, to end press censorship,
 to insure justice in the courts, to restore the
 legitimate authority of ministers and army
 commanders.  I knew that none of these
 would ever come about, and that he had no
 intention of removing Nhu and his wife, or of
 lessening the air of discord and suspicion
 that was everywhere.  We all became masters
 of subterfuge and intrigue under Diem. That
 much he taught us, and we used it against
 him.
 Question. How  do you  think  the  war
 against the Vietcong will go now?
 Answer. In some areas, the situation is
 very bad.  We will have to start from scratch.
 But now we will push much harder.             We
 will try to control the Cambodian border,
 where many of their supplies come through.
 We'll step up night operations-until now,
 the Vietcong has been fighting at night. And
 we have been fighting in the daytime, and
 well take risks. I was not frightened of risks
 when I fought Diem.  I led the attack.   I
 was  at  the palace, hurrying the troops
 through breaches in the wall. I did it. And
 now I can do it against the Vietcong.
 Question. Would you consider taking a
 higher government post than the one you
 now hold as Minister of Security?
 Answer. I have no personal ambitions.  I
 am a soldier.  But if the people ask me to
 serve, I will obey-nor for myself, for them.
 I only want to serve, as I served Diem.  I
 was sorry that we had to kill him. I cried.

 INDOCHINA
 Asked at his news conference today about
 the situation in Indochina, Secretary of State
 John Foster Dulles made the following state-
 ment :
 "I do not expect that there is going to be
 a Communist victory in Indochina.  By that
 I don't mean that there may not be local
 affairs where one side or another will win
 victories,  but  in  terms  of  a  Communist
 domination of Indochina, I do., not accept
 that as a probability.
 "There is a very gallant and brave struggle
 being carried on at Dienbienphu by the
 French and Associated States Forces.  It is
 an outpost.  It has already inflicted very
 heavy damage upon the enemy.       The French
 and Associated States Forces at Dienbienphu
 are writing, inmy opinion, a notable chap-
 ter in military history.  Dienbienphu is, as
 I say, an outpost position where only a very
 small percentage of the French Union Forces
 are engaged, and where a very considerable
 percentage of the forces of the Vietminh is
 engaged.
 "Broadly speaking, the United States has,
 under its previously known policy, been ex-
 tending aid in the form of money and ma-
 teriel to the French Union Forces in Indo-
 china.                                                                               As their requests for materiel become
 known, and their need for that becomes evi-
 dent, we respond to it as rapidly-as we can.
 Those requests have assumed various forms
 at various times.  But I think that we have
 responded in a very prompt and effective
 Inanner to those requests.
 "If there are further requests of that kind
 that are made, I have no doubt that our mili-
 tary or defense people will attempt to meet
 them.
 "As soon as this press conference is over,
 March 10
 I am meeting with Admiral Radford.  But
 so far I have not met General Ely, and I do
 not know what requests he has made, if
 any, in that respect because that would be
 primarily a matter for the defense people in
 any case. The policy has already been estab-
 lished so far as the political aspects of it are
 concerned.
 "We have seen no reason to abandon the
 so-called Navarre plan which was, broadly
 speaking, a 2-year plan which anticipated,
 if not complete victory, at least decisive mili-
 tary results during the fighting season which
 would follow the present fighting season,
 which is roughly a year from now.
 "As you recall, that plan contemplated t
 very substantial buildup of the local forces
 and their training and equipment.  It was
 believed that under that program, assum-
 ing there were no serious military reversals
 during the present fighting season, the upper
 hand could definitely be achieved in the area
 by  the  end of the  next  fighting season.
 There have been no such military reverses,
 and, as far as we can see, none are in pros-
 pect which would be of a character which
 would upset the broad timetable and strat-
 egy of the Navarre plan."
 Asked whether that ruled out any possi-
 bility of a negotiated peace at Geneva, Mr.
 Dulles replied:
 "At any time if the Chinese Communists
 are willing to cut off military assistance, and
 thereby demonstrate that they are not still
 aggressors in spirit, that would, of course,
 advance greatly the possibility of achieving
 peace and tranquility in the area.  That is a
 result which we would like to see.
 "To date, however, I have no evidence that
 they have changed their mood.       One is al-
 ways hopeful in those respects, but, so far,
 the evidence seems to indicate that the Chi-
 n@se Communists are still in an aggressive,
 militaristic and expansionist mood."

 WE NEARLY WENT TO WAR 3 TIMES LAST YEAR
 BUT IKE SAID No
 (By Fletcher Knebel)
 Three times wthin the past 10 months, the
 United States stood on the brink of war with
 the Communists in the Far East.  Three
 times the proposal of war in the Orient was
 advanced in the highest councils of the Ei-
 senhower administration.  Twice it was re-
 jected.  Once it was abandoned-but only
 after a veto by Great Britain.
 Last April, America came to the thresh-
 old of war to save Indochina from the Com-
 munist forces of Ho Chi Minh, a venture that
 might or might not have involved us in hot
 war with Red China.
 In September, the United States was but
 inches away from a decision to go to war to
 prevent the little island of Quemoy, off the
 Chinese mainland, from falling into Com-
 munist hands.
 In November, America was stayed from a
 naval and air blockade of Red China-an
 act of war-by President Dwight D. Eisen-
 hower and Secretary of State John Foster
 Dulles.
 The story of how America narrowly missed
 armed conflict in Asia is a fascinating inter-
 play of the convinctions of powerful men,
 all of them high-principled, all of them shar-
 ing the Nation's top secret intelligence re-
 ports and all of them determined to guide
 America's destiny to the eventual goal of
 world peace.

 History may credit a number of men with
 helping to keep America out of war in the
 last  10                            months.  They  were  Eisenhower,
 Dulles, Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, Anthony

 The struggle for war or peace in Washing-
 ton was contested on an oddly shaped trian-
 gle, its points resting on the White House,
 the State Department and the Pentagon
 across the Potomac River in Virginia.
 Here is the inside story, as gathered from
 many of the participants, of how the United
 States looked into the pit of war-and turned
 away.
 INDOCHINA
 Last March, the Communist warriors of Ho
 Chi Minh besieged the French fortress of
 Dienbienphu in tremendous strength, seeking
 a knockout blow to win the dreary, 8-year-
 old conflict.
 Six days later, Gen. Paul Ely, French chief
 of staff, arrived in Washington and secretly
 informed U.S. leaders that American inter-
 vention was needed to.save Indochina,,, This
 set in motion a month-long chain of private
 Washington huddles and frenzied diplomacy.
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff, America's top
 military body, met in the Pentagon.
 Adm. Arthur W. Radford, a carrier and air-
 power naval officer and chairman of the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff, advocated U.S. intervention
 through a carrier strike from the U.S.S.
 Essex and Boxer, both then in the Gulf of
 Tonkin, and by Air Force bombers from the
 Philippines. Radford had long favored a dis-
 play of force in the Far East, was already
 an advocate, of blockading Red China.
 Gen, Matthew B. Ridgway, Army chief of
 staff and former Korean commander, declared
 himself flatly against American intervention.
 He declared that an air strike would lead in-
 evitably to action by American troops as soon
 as the first planes were shot down.  He con-
 tended that his limited army, with commit-
 ments around the globe, could not fight In
 the jungles of Indochina short of allout mo-
 bilization at home.
 Adm. Robert B. Carney, chief of naval op-
 erations, and. Gen. Nathan F. Twining, Air
 Force chief of staff, took a middle ground
 between Radford and Ridgway.  They ex-
 pressed belief than an airstrike would be
 effective in aiding the defenders of Dien-
 bienphu, but doubted the aerial blow alone
 could win the war for the French.
 Radford took his recommendation for U,S.
 intervention to the National Security Coun-
 cil. President Eisenhower accepted Radford's
 opinion that an airstrike would be effective,
 but quickly laid down the rule that the
 United States would intervene only if joined
 by other allies.  In the circumstances, "other
 allies" meant Britain, which had a carrier

 Council to extraordinary session at Denver
 to discuss war  in  Quemoy.  The meeting
 was held in the Officer's Club at Lowry Air
 Force Base.
 Dulles was in Manilla, signing the south-
 east  Asian  collective-defense  treaty.                                                   He
 cabled that he had two questions: One. Was
 Quemoy essential to the defense of Formosa
 (which the United States is committed to
 defend) ?  Two. Was Quemoy itself defend-
 able?
 Dulles got the answers to his questions
 from Radford.  Quemoy could be defended,
 but Quemoy was not absolutely essential to
 the defense of Formosa.  Dulles then took
 a stand against any ironclad assurance to
 Chiang that we would help defend Quemoy.
 Vice President Nixon also opposed American
 aid for Quemoy.
 President Eisenhower in the end decided
 that we would make no definite commitment
 to Chiang to defend Quemoy.  On the other
 hand, if the Reds attacked Quemoy in force
 as an obvious prelude to an invasion of For-
 mosa, we would be free to strike if we wished.
 President Eisenhower cast his deciding vote
 against war.
 THE BLOCKADE
 Barely 2 months later, strong men in the
 administration                                 and  the  Republican  Party
 again propelled the United States toward war
 with Red China.
 In late November, the Chinese Communists
 announced they had imprisoned as spies 11
 U.S. airmen and 2 civilians, captured in the
 Korean war.
 Secretary Dulles was vacationing  at his
 home on Duck Island in,Lake Ontario, where
 the chief blessing Is the absence of a tele-
 phone.  When Dulles stepped ashore Sunday,
 November 28, in Jefferson County, N.Y., he
 learned of the gathering thunderclouds.
 Senate  Republican  leader  William  F.
 Knowland, of California, had called for a
 naval blockade so tight that "no vessel can
 get in or out of China until these Americans
 are released."  He was then backed by other
 Republicans.    Also, Dulles knew that Ad-
 mirals Radford  and  Carney  on  the                                                                                                                                     joint
 chiefs favored a blockade, not specifically be-
 cause of the spy "conviction" of the Ameri-
 can airmen, but as a tool to yank the fangs
 of militant Red China.
 Dulles decided to call the President. who
 was In Augusta, Ga., for Thanskgiving, but
 the President got him first at the home of
 friends in the hamlet of Chaumont on the
 shores  of  Chaumont  Bay,  Lake  Ontario.
 They talked for 15 minutes and agreed that
 a blockade would be an act of war, that
 America should not commit its armed might
 in response to what they believed was a care-
 fully timed provocative act by the Commu-
 nists.
 Dulles sketched a proposed revision of his
 scheduled speech in Chicago Monday night
 and Ike approved it.   The  next morning,
 Dulles called to dictate the text of his revi-
 sion, and an aid took it to Ike, who was out
 playing golf.  As he sat on a bench beside a
 tee, the President made a few changes and
 approved the rest.  The speech flatly rejected
 a blockade.
 The decision again was against war.
 Twice in 1954, the President turned down
 proposals  that  America  fight  Red  China.
 Once he approved war action, but only on
 condition that our allies join us-they never
 did.
 In the search for peace, an American Presi-
 dent must finger many tools.  Once Ike used
 President Eisenhower also stipulated that      way opposed it,                                                  the hammer. To understand the peace quest

 No. 43-8
 ering war in Indochina.
 The legislators said "No" in various ways
 to the suggestion of congressional authoriza-
 tion for U.S. solo intervention.                                                                            And Dulles
 indicated that the President had no thought
 of asking this anyway, since the principle of
 "united action" had been determined.
 The Secretary of State flew to London and
 Paris in mid-April, got British and French
 agreement to proceed with united action
 talks.  A communique was issued, after Sir
 Winston  Churchill  himself made penciled
 changes.
 BRITISH MOVE ANGERS DULLES
 Back in Washington, Dulles arranged an
 eight-power conference on methods of stop-
 ping                                                                          the      Reds  in   Indochina.  On  Easter
 Sunday,  however,  Sir  Roger  Makins, the
 British Ambassador, called Dulles at home to
 say he had been instructed not to attend the
 talks.  Angry at the apparent British re-
 treat, Dulles changed the meeting into a
 I6-power Korean peace conference as a face-
 saving device.
 The transatlantic maneuvering generated
 terrific tensions behind the scenes.  At one
 congressional briefing, a Republican legisla-
 tor blurted out to Dulles, "You are either a
 liar  or  Eden  is  a  doublecrosser." Dulles
 vowed he had told the exact truth of the ne-
 gotiations  with  the                                                                                      British,  that London
 suddenly had switched signals on him.
 On April 25, the British Cabinet met in
 emergency session      and    decided finally
 against military action in Indochina. The
 decision was relayed to Dulles in Paris by
 Anthony Eden.  U.S.    officials learned that
 Nehru in India bad influenced the British
 Cabinet's decision by voicing violent objec-
 tion to British-American military action in
 Indochina.
 Radford flew from Paris to London the
 next day, conferred with British leaders in
 an effort to arrange some other joint action
 in Indochina.  But this mission failed.  This
 ended all thought by U.S. leaders of inter-
 vening to save Dienbienphu, and on May 7
 the fortress fell tq Ho Chi Minh's troops.
 QUEMOY
 Two months after the Indochina armistice
 was signed in Geneva, July 21, the United
 States again moved to the edge of war In the
 Orient.  This time, however, there was no
 question of "united action."  This time, the
 joint  chiefs proposed  that America  go it
 alone.
 In early September, Red Chinese artillery
 began shelling the Nationalist Chinese is-
 land of Quemoy, a few miles off the Asiatic
 mainland and about 125 miles from Chiang
 Kai-shek's stronghold on Formosa.
 The American Joint Chiefs of Staff, fear-
 ing preparations for the long-promised Red
 invasion of Formosa 'had begun, met at the
 Pentagon.  They decided to urge President
 Eisenhower to use the 7th Fleet to thwart an

 DEAD END IN VIETNAM
 WE CAN'T WIN, BUT WE NEED NOT LOSE--I
 (By Jerry A. Rose')
 SAIGON.-The war in South Vietnam cannot
 be won.  That is now the on-the-spot opin-
 ion of numerous Vietnamese, American and
 other foreign experts.  After 4 years of closely
 observing the situation, I concur.  But it is
 unlikely that the Secretary of Defense, Rob-
 ert McNamara, and the Chairman of the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Maxwell Taylor, have
 reached a similar conclusion, though they
 have heard passionately contradictory view-
 points.  There are powerful voices of opti-
 mism.
 Gen.  Paul  D.  Harkins,  Commander     of
 the Military Assistance  Command,  is  one
 such voice. To many of us long in the area,
 his voice is like a frightening echo of past
 American commanders.  Gen. "Hanging Sam"
 Williams  considered  President  Ngo  Dinh
 Diem a near brother and felt that the Viet-
 cong guerrillas  could be                                                                                                                                        eliminated  with
 tanks  and  howitzers-and  while  he   was
 molding the Vietnamese troops into standard
 warfare units, guerrilla terrorism increased.
 But Williams chose to ignore that lethal in-
 crease.                                                                                                                                          Then came Gen. Lionel "Stonehead"
 McGarr, who once told me that "President
 Diem is a genius, a genius."  McGarr, to the
 day he left Vietnam because of "heart trou-
 ble," stoutly contended that the guerrillas
 were being contained.  The opposite was true
 to any rational observer.  Strangely, the tra-
 dition of rosy optimism dates back to French
 commanders during the Indochina War who
 saw a final victory forever around the corner
 until one day they turned the corner and ran
 smack into Dien Bien Phu.
 "Vietnam has been the burial ground for
 more generals and diplomats than any other
 place on earth," said a laconic reporter the
 day Ambassador Frederick Nolting departed.
 And indeed it has, though more realism and
 less wishful thinking may have saved their
 own necks and the nation's.  Lesser officials
 and the much-maligned correspondents have
 called  the  hard,  unpleasant but  realistic
 shots.  To do so is not difficult; it takes but
 a recognition of the basic factors involved
 in Vietnam and in guerrilla warfare.      And
 the most basic of these factors is the attitude
 of the people toward their government and
 national leader.  But for some reason, diplo-
 mats, soldiers in the field, and politicians in
 Washington are unable to grasp the impor-
 tance of the people.  While forever raising
 wet fingers to the wind of public opinion in
 the United States, the policymakers appear to
 operate on the belief that Asian people have
 no opinions, and even if they did have an
 opinion, it would carry no weight.  A good
 Gallup poll would easily disprove the former
 proposition, and history has proved time and
 again the fallacy of the latter.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                March 10
 During their week's stay in Vietnam, Mc-
 Namara and Taylor got little if any inkling
 of Vietnamese public opinion and of its sig-
 nificance in the war effort.  Rather, they
 have been evaluating the war largely through
 military statistics. Such statistics-when ac-
 curate-indicate trends but not solutions.
 The trend is: greater Vietcong activity, in-
 creased casualties on both sides (with the
 Government suffering generally fewer), and
 the crucial ratio of weapons lost and gained
 favoring the enemy by at least 2 to 1.
 A recent tabulation within 1 week showed
 the guerrillas to have captured 360 weapons
 from the Government while losing only 150
 to the national forces.  These figures tell a
 clear story: the Vietcong are winning the
 ground battles, though they incur heavy
 casualties from Government airstrikes. Thus,
 with a steady flow of weapons from within
 South Vietnam-and an increasing stream of
 Communist-bloc weapons being smuggled to
 the guerrillas from the outside-it is not
 surprising that the hard-core Vietcong force
 has jumped by an estimated 8,000 men in the
 last several months.  There are now some
 31,000 Communist guerrillas, well above last
 year's figure of 20,000 to 25,000.
 Nevertheless, $1.5 million a day and about
 17,000 active U.S. military men has had some
 positive effect.  The keynote strategic hamlet
 plan to urbanize and control the population
 goes well north of Saigon.  As of September
 8,227 strategic hamlets have been built, en-
 compassing 76 percent of the population or
 9.6 million people.  In costal provinces such
 as Quang Ngai, once a Vietcong stronghold,
 the "hamletization" coupled with sound agri-
 cultural projects (small dams for irrigation,
 tons of fertilizer and pesticides) has gone far
 to winning back the support of the people.
 And here, notable military victories have
 been. won-for it only takes one govern-
 ment-oriented peasant to inform on the
 movements of the  Vietcong, one peasant
 actively supporting the Government.  With
 solid information, the military can prepare
 itself. Just recently the Government caught
 the guerrillas by surprise and gained a de-
 cisive battle because one old lady came In to
 report the Vietcong's position.
 "We're lucky to hold our own"
 Incredible though it is, that one active
 individual is lacking in most areas of the
 Mekong Delta, the economic heart of South
 Vietnam.   Americans   working  with  the
 strategic hamlet plan in the delta readily
 admit that the program is floundering, has
 made little progress.  Militarily, the situa-
 tion is equally unsatisfactory.  Commented
 an American  general:  "Below the Bassac
 River, we're lucky to hold our own." Many
 feel that we are not even doing that.
 This economic heart of South Vietnam, the
 Mekong Delta, has suffered severe strokes
 over the last several years. In 1961, rice
 exports from the area-Vietnam's major ex-
 port product-were totally suspended.  The
 exports began to diminish in 1962. Now,
 they have against been halted.  Despite the
 vast American aid, the Government is finding
 itself short of cash.  For example, this year
 the strategic hamlet program was calculated
 to cost about $30 million.  The United States
 was to pay the first 6 months (to the end
 of June), the Vietnamese the latter half of
 the year.  As of September, the Diem gov-
 ernment had not yet started to fulfill its
 part of the agreement.      From July of 1962
 to July of this year, Vietnam's foreign and
 gold reserves fell from $200 million to $130
 million.   The national bank is reported to
 have a piaster reserve of only $14 million.
 And  Vietnam's  debts       to  foreign  banks
 amount to some $14Q million (which is one
 reason why hardheaded Hong Kong busi-
 nessmen decided to cease trading with the
 country).
 "Right now, our greatest danger," said a
 Vietnamese economist, "is national bank-
 ruptcy and wild inflation."
 Part of this economic condition is due di-
 rectly to President Diem.  He will not listen
 to the counsel of his own trained economists.
 Similarly, President Diem refused to listen
 to reasoning voices of moderation when the
 Buddhist trouble erupted. He took brother
 Nhu's advice and cracked down harshly. He
 has echoed his sister-in-law, the now in-
 famous Madame Nhu, in calling the self-
 immolation of a Buddhish monk a murder.
 Then the Vietnamese students began to riot,
 and over 8,000 teenagers, both girls and boys,
 were imprisoned.  Ministers of the state, civil
 officials, army officers went to the prisons
 with packages of clothing and food for their
 sons and daughters.  Throughout the coun-
 try, the word of these events-both with the
 Buddhists and the students-slowly seeps
 down.  (Slowly seeps down, for news does not
 travel quickly.)  Slowly seeps down and takes
 seed in the minds of the Vietnamese people,
 who are perhaps the most politically sophis-
 ticated people in Asia, for they have suffered
 the wars of politics for more than 20 years.
 They have listened to many political ideol-
 ogies.  They have learned to choose cau-
 tiously, but they have also learned that to
 survive they must, sooner or later, choose a
 side. The repression against the students
 and the Buddhists will inevitably affect their
 choice, for they are no different from any
 other peoples in the world.  They do not like
 to see their religious leaders or their young
 people persecuted.
 Yet, almost unbelievably, some U.S. offi-
 cials maintain that the Buddhist and student
 demonstrations have not affected and will
 not affect the people and the "way the war
 is going."  It has been said many times now,
 by U.S. Army officers, by disinterested ob-
 servers, by journalists, by Communist guer-
 rilla leaders themselves that "a guerrilla war
 cannot be won by military means alone,"
 that "the people are the key to victory."  It
 has been said so many times that the state-
 ment has become cliche.  It is true neverthe-
 less-except I believe that the roots of rancor
 now run so deep in South Vietnam that the
 people can no longer be won over, at least
 not enough of them to result in clear-cut
 stability.
 "Outside of a miracle, a genius-like Mag-
 saysay--coming to the fore," said one Amer-
 ican in Saigon who has dedicated all his
 energies over the last 3 years to South Viet-
 nam, "this country is lost."  Then, rather
 wearily, he murmured: "Leadership, leader-
 ship."  Even as late as last year, popular
 leadership may have spelled the difference.
 Today, the grassroot strength of the Viet-
 cong appears so strong, particularly in the
 delta, that  it  seems  unlikely  any  leader
 could shake it.
 On top of this a few hardheaded observers
 contend that the war could never have been
 won. Said one Australian diplomat: "We
 must clearly define what we mean by `win-
 ning' the war. An outright victory Is impos-
 sible.  Stability as existed in 1957 might still
 be achieved-but as then, there will always
 be terrorism."  While acknowledging the
 need of sound and popular leadership to
 gain that 1957 stability, this gentleman
 points to South Vietnam's long, gaping bor-
 ders: a border with Cambodia, another with
 Laos, a third with North Vietnam. "Porous
 borders," he calls them-they could never
 be sealed off; they would always permit a
 shower of infiltrators, terrorists.  Thus: "In
 that sense, the war cannot be won.  Peace
 cannot be established."
 According to good estimates, last year in-
 filtration into South Vietnam ran in the
 neighborhood of 1,000 men per month. This
 year it fell off for awhile to almost nothing,
 now it is back to around 500 per month.
 But the shocking factor is not the actual
 number of Infiltrators but the capacity for
 infiltration.  An intelligence expert told me
 bluntly: "If North Vietnam wanted to, they
 could send down 20,000 infiltrators in one
 swoop and it would be 2 weeks before we
 knew it."
 Now let us review briefly the current sit-
 uation in South Vietnam: (1) a national
 leader who is unpopular and whose family
 is detested;  (2)  a nation of discontented
 people, two segments of which (Buddhists
 and students)  have  overtly demonstrated
 their unhappiness, another segment which
 covertly demonstrates its unhappiness (by
 siding with the Vietcong), a final segment
 which remains for the time being passive
 (popular passivity helps the Vietcong-for
 the government needs active informers) ;
 (3) a shaky, inflationary economy; (4) a war
 that grows fiercer each week despite vast
 American aid in both money, materiel and
 personnel; and (5) "porous borders" with
 three countries that permit a steady influx
 of guerrillas.
 Take  these  five  elements,  place  them
 against the stated American policy in South
 Vietnam:  "To win and     get out,"  and it
 should be starkly  clear  that the United
 States is at a dead end.  We cannot win,
 But we do not necessarily have to lose.
 That is, though an outright victory over the
 guerrillas now seems impossible (and I be-
 lieve that despite the borders it was once
 possible), an outright defeat can still be
 prevented.  But U.S. thinking must undergo
 some  radical  changes.  Washington  must
 begin to consider the proposition that peace
 to South Vietnam will come not on the bat-
 tlefield but only at the conference table.
 And I do not mean General de Gaulle's con-
 ference table. Within the foreseeable future,
 reunification of the North and South could
 only result in a final Communist victory.
 But there are other possibilities.  To under-
 stand them, one must be aware of the diffi-
 cult position of the Democratic Republic of
 (North) Vietnam.
 An Asian Yugoslavia?
 In the slow-seething years  before Red
 China and the Soviet Union split totally
 asunder, North Vietnam's President Ho Chi
 Minh tried to play the neutral moderator.
 He preferred the Russians, but the proximity
 of China did not permit him to take sides.
 He knew that to become an oriental Albania
 was to risk eventual destruction.  Now, since
 the split, Ho has, by necessity, leaned more
 toward China.  But the Chinese ruled Viet-
 nam for almost 2,000 years, and China has
 never ceased to look hungrily at Vietnam's
 rice bowl, the Mekong Delta.  In fact, it is
 the Mekong Delta which the North itself
 wants, and needs, to achieve a solid economy
 (the North has always been industrial, the
 South agricultural).  All Vietnamese have a
 natural dislike, suspicion, and fear of the
 Chinese, and it is highly probable that Ho
 Chi Minh and the other Communist leaders
 of the North would do much to disengage
 themselves from China's sphere of influence.
 They could do this if they were able to trade
 for food with South Vietnam and for mate-
 rial with the West.  And they likely would
 be willing to enter into trade relations, cease
 hostilities-become a sort of  Asian Yugo-
 slavia-providing they were convinced an
 outright victory could not be gained in the
 South within a reasonable length of time.
 The United States must convince the North
 it cannot win soon or easily.
 This could be done if President Diem were
 removed, a better leader emerged, popular
 support gained to some degree, the morale
 and efficiency of the Vietnamese Army im-
 proved.  As Diem obviously is not easily
 removed,  alternatives  must  be  examined.
 One alternative is to put a division or more
 of  American combat     troops  into action.
 Coupled with this direct involvement would
 be the establishment of a dual chain of
 United States-Vietnamese Army commands
 that ignored  and bypassed the President.
 We could continue to finance the Vietnamese
 Army, but through nongovernmental chan-

 nels.  We could also cut back on our budget-
 ary support.
 North Vietnam's response to this chal-
 lenge could only be to heavily step up in-
 filtration with large units of soldiers.          The
 moment it does, three important changes
 occur in the nature of the war: (1) North
 Vietnam will begin to suffer the financial
 burden of war, a burden which it can ill af-
 ford; (2) sooner or later one of these in-
 filtrating units will be captured and North
 Vietnam will be inextricably caught in the
 act of aggression; and (3) with definite proof
 of aggression, North Vietnam will leave itself
 open to direct retaliation, as through bomb-
 ing attacks.  At such a point, would the war
 escalate?
 The North Vietnamese do not want to be
 devastated, nor are they prepared to finance
 a war the size of the Korean conflict.  Nei-
 ther is Red China in any financial position
 to engage on a lengthy battlefield.     The
 Soviet Union not only has been detaching
 itself from this part of the world, but also
 seems to wish peace as much as the United
 States.  The conference table stands ready.
 The contract for peace is comparatively sim-
 ple: trade relations in exchange for non-
 aggression.
 To sum up: One solution now for the
 United States appears to be a show of power
 in South Vietnam which would pave the
 way toward a compromising settlement.  But
 is the risk of a power play warranted?
 Southeast Asia has been likened to a "set of
 dominoes."  If South Vietnam falls, the rest
 of the blocks go too.  It would seem, there-
 fore, that it is in the high interest of the
 United States, as a leader and a system of
 government, to risk much in stabilizing that
 tottering block.
 CIA's "thirst for power"
 In a scathing dispatch from Saigon dated
 October 2, Richard Starnes of Scripps-Howard
 reported that on two occasions the CIA in
 Vietnam "flatly refused to carry out instruc-
 tions from Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge."
 In one instance, "the CIA frustrated a plan
 of action Mr. Lodge brought with him from
 Washington, because the Agency disagreed
 with it." Mr. Starnes also said that:
 "CIA 'spooks' (a universal term for secret
 agents here) have penetrated every branch
 of the American community in Saigon. ? ? ?
 Few people other than John Richardson
 [Chief of the CIA appartus In Vietnam] and
 his close aides know the actual CIA strength
 here, but a widely used figure is 600."
 "For every State Department aid here
 who will tell you 'Dammit, the CIA is sup-
 posed to gather Information, not make policy,
 but policymaking is what they're doing here'
 there are military officers who scream over
 the way the spooks dabble in military op-
 erations.
 "One very high American official here, a
 man who has spent much of his life in the
 service of  democracy,  likened  the  CIA's
 growth to a malignancy, and added he was
 not sure even the White House could control
 it any longer."
 The story of the CIA In South Vietnam,
 said Mr. Starnes, "is a dismal chronicle of
 bureaucratic arrogance, obstinate disregard
 of orders, and unrestrained thirst for power."
 NEGOTIATING WITH THE NORTH   It
 (By Ho Thong Minh 2)
 When he returned to Vietnam in June 1954,
 Ngo Dinh Diem asked me to work with him.
 I resigned as Minister of National Defense
 on April 29, 1955, end of a brief 9-month
 2Ho Thong Minh, a 43-year-old civil en-
 gineer, ndw lives in Paris where he is the
 moving spirit behind the group Pour Le
 Vietnam. His comments were first published
 in Le Monde of September 19.
 period during which, as a result of the Gen-
 eva agreements, peace was temporarily re-
 stored.  After 16 years of war, it did not
 seem to me that South Vietnam could con-
 tinue moving toward its own reconstruction
 in a spirit of unity and harmony.  All hope
 of positive advance had been made impossi-
 ble by the nefarious activities of the Ngo
 clan.
 At present South Vietnam has a popula-
 tion of 14 million (as many as the former
 Belgian Congo).  Inside the nation a facade
 of republicanism conceals the sordid reali-
 ties: corruption, informer tactics, stagnation,
 the denial of all democracy.  It is a dismal
 and telling contrast to recall that under
 Syngman Rhee in South Korea there were
 some 90-odd opposition deputies in office at
 Seoul, whereas Diem refuses to tolerate a
 single  one  at  Saigon.   The Diem regime
 claims to be anti-Communist, but its think-
 ing and its actions are patterned after the
 psychological warfare of the French colonels.
 It has successively gotten rid of Bao-Dai, of
 the various religious sects, of the French, of
 all domestic opposition, of the Buddhists, of
 the Vietnamese people themselves, and now,
 finally, It is in difficulty with the Americans.
 The amount of U.S. aid to South Vietnam
 (and hence to the Ngo clan) is comparable to
 the contribution which France was making
 not so long ago to Algeria.  Between direct
 military and economic aid and its own ex-
 penses for maintaining U.S. troops in Viet-
 nam, the United States pours annually into
 the yawning South Vietnamese pit the sum
 of $700 million.  This expenditure enables
 the United States to equip an army of over
 half a million Vietnamese (510,000, to be
 precise) on territory only half the size of
 the area where, in 1954, the French and
 Vietnamese together mustered only 450,000
 men.   All that money and military man-
 power-only to be held at bay by 50 Viet-
 cong battalions all told.
 The whole world has become aware of the
 drama  which  is  being  enacted  in  South
 Vietnam, and the Diem regime is as sharply
 criticized abroad as at home.    How is the
 impasse to be got around?  Although the
 people of South Vietnam are resolutely com-
 mitted to a program of defiance and insur-
 rection, they aspire beyond this to surviv-
 ing as a free and independent nation. They
 are certain that the Ngo regime must end
 and  are  already  looking  forward  to  the
 prospect of peace.  But by what road is this
 peace to be achieved?
 The current situation renders imperative
 (first of all) the overthrow of the Diem
 regime; for this the Vietnamese Army will be
 the ineluctable instrument, and in this con-
 nection, the Americans are increasing their
 efforts to dissociate the army from the pre-
 sent                                                                                government at Saigon.  Next should
 come the cessation of foreign intervention-
 in other words, both the Americans and the
 infiltrators from the North should depart.
 This, of course, can only be done by a truce,
 a suspension of hostilities, with the Viet-
 cong.  Thirdly, after the foreign bases have
 been eliminated, it will be necessary to have
 solid international guarantees so as to make
 the present SEATO troops unnecessary.
 If these three steps could be taken,  it
 would then at last be possible for the two
 Vietnams to sit down together and settle
 their problems.  Of course national reunifica-'
 tion continues to be the ultimate goal of the
 Vietnamese.  But for the time being political
 realities require   compromise   solutions.
 Everyone knows that North Vietnam is di-
 rected by a Communist regime which seeks
 to maintain an attitude of neutrality as be-
 tween ''eiping acid Moscow.  Under these
 circumstances and for the i nmediate pre-
 sent, the next South Vietnamese government
 can hardly be anything but non-Communist.
 In fact, if it were anti-Communist, practi-
 4673
 tally nothing would be changed and there
 would be a danger of the country being
 swallowed up in Diemism without Diem.  If,
 on the other hand, the new regime were to
 welcome Communists in the government, it
 could no longer speak as equal to equal in
 independent conversations with the North.
 Furthermore, one need look only as far as
 Laos to find an example of the very great dif-
 ficulties  which  could  rapidly  become  in-
 surmountable  if       the  Vietnamese       Govern-
 ment were to be a three-headed coalition-
 and the example is still more compelling
 when  one  considers  that Laos  is all one
 country, not cut in two pieces like Vietnam.
 A future non-Communist regime in Saigon
 could, however, where domestic problems are
 concerned, invite  the  participation  of  all
 Vietnamese  patriots, from  the  Buddhist
 clergy to the National Liberation Front, pro-
 vided they are not Communists.
 In the international sphere, such a regime
 could contribute to peace in southeast Asia
 by adopting the same neutralist attitudes as
 those of its neighbor, Cambodia.  It would
 certainly not oppose the diplomatic recogni-
 tion of North Vietnam by France.  In this
 way, France would fulfill a privileged role-
 providing a connecting link for economic
 unity and, most particularly, for cultural
 unity, the lines of which would be laid down
 between the two Vietnams in their efforts
 to  establish  the  united  and  independent
 Vietnam which General de Gaulle has re-
 cently and rightly envisaged.
 There remains the crucial problem of the
 confrontation between China and the West
 in southeast Asia.  Here it is possible to be-
 lieve  that  the  present  conflict  between
 Peiping and Moscow has been brought about
 less by ideological differences than by dif-
 ferences In the level of economic develop-
 ment.   When  China attains     the  level  of
 economic development that now prevails in
 the U.S.S.R., it too will surely feel that it
 must protect the progress it has made by
 practicing peaceful coexistence.
 In any event, things being as they are, the
 foregoing program and prospects are those
 which seem to me within the realm of the
 possible.
 A TALK WITH HO CHI MINH-III
 (By Bernard B. Fall)
 As the second Indochina war now grinds
 on into its 4th year, a large-scale reappraisal
 is  under     way  both  among  Americans in
 Saigon and in Washington as to the ultimate
 objectives and outcome of that war.     For
 the time being, no solution envisaged con-
 siders seriously the possibility of talks with
 the real enemy by proxy, North Vietnam.  In
 fact, it is not without significance that the
 only open reference made to such negotia-
 tions  came from no one  else but                                                                                                                                          South
 Vietnam's  secret  police chief,  Ngo  Dinh
 Nhu, in his recent interview with an Amer-
 ican columnist, Nhu, beyond a doubt seeks
 to use at least the threat-if not the real-
 ity-of such south-north contacts as a coun-
 terblackmail  against  the  United                                                                                                                                               States
 which has thus far (and with conspicuous
 unsuccess)  sought his and his wife's re-
 moval from Vietnamese politics.
 Thus, negotiating with North Vietnam-
 or, for that matter, any kind of contact
 with  that  country-has  become    another
 bogey that, in the months to come, may
 supplant Cuba and even Red China in the
 public eye. Of course, as even a brief stay in
 North Vietnam shows,  that  attitude  cuts
 both ways: in Hanoi, the only kind of dem-
 onstration                                                                                                                                            that  is allowed  is  directed
 against the United States, the Ngo family,
 or, on occasion, against the Indian and Can-
 adian (not the Polish, of course)                                                                                                                                       members

 tiveness makes it a permanent monument
 to the impossibility of 'settling a dispute
 when it directly involves the prestige or in-
 terests of both of the major power blocs.
 French non-Communist writers have been
 able, over the years, to visit North Vietnam,
 just as Canadian, Australian and British
 writers have been able to visit Red China.
 In my own case, the fact that I had writ-
 ten a solidly-documented (and, hence, un-
 flattering) book in French about North Viet-
 nam, perhaps incited the North Vietnamese
 leaders to be franker than usual. What fol-
 lows is based on notes taken in the course
 of a conversation which took place in JuTy
 1962 supplemented by a tape recording made
 during that conversation and by notes made
 immediately afterward, while my memory
 was fresh. It is a verbatim translation from
 the original French, and leaves out only some
 of the usual banter.
 A brief note on the North Vietnamese
 leaders involved: Prime Minister Pham Van
 Dong, born in 1906 in Central Vietnam, Is
 of senior mandarin origin; in fact, say some,
 he outranks President Ngo Dinh Diem. While
 Diem's father was chief of cabinet to Em-
 perot Thauh-Thi, Dong's father held the
 same post under Emperor Duy-Tan. A grad-
 uate of Chiang Kai-shek's own Whampoa
 Military Academy (class of 1925), Dong has
 been Ho's Prime Minister and probably clos-
 est associate since 1955.
 Ho Chi Minh, born in 1890 in Central Viet-
 nam, was a revolutionary since his age of
 14, when to Europe in 1911, became a co-
 founder of the French Communist Party in
 1920 and a French delegate to the Komin-
 tern.''in 1923.  He founded the Indochinese
 Communist Party in 1930 and became Pres-
 ideRit of the Democratic Republic of Viet-
 on September 2, 1945.  He un-
 questionably is the most important Asian
 Communist leader after Mao Tse-tung, and
 the last of the Old Bolsheviks in power any-
 where in the Communist world.
 All remarks made by bong are preceded by

 tions are placed in brackets.

 would call this in accordance with demo-
 which apply to everybody.  [While theoreti-
 cally true, the rule obviously applies to

 white film has to be exposed prior to de-
 parture and the developed film submitted to
 the Foreign Ministry for censorship.  Eveh
 so, the airport police again Inspected' my
 films prior to departure.]
 F. Monsieur  is  Prime  Minister,  North
 Vietnam has had some serious economic dif-
 ficulties.  Do you believe that they have
 been mastered?
 P, As you know, the recent Seventh plenary
 session  of  the  [Vietnamese]   Communist
 Party's Central Committee has decided to
 give priority to basic heavy Industries, al-
 though attention will be paid to a proper
 balance with agriculture and consumer goods
 production.   ,
 We base ourselves upon the Marxist eco-
 nomic viewpoint: heavy industrial develop-
 ment is essential to Socialist construction,
 but we also the "full belly."  Intaany       importance of
 case, we do not seek
 to bluff and will not put emphasis on "show-
 piece" industries but on sound and useful
 economic development.
 Yes, we have made economic mistakes, due
 mainly to our backwardness and ignorance
 in the field of economic planning.  Not all
 of those errors have yet been corrected and
 some of their effects are still felt, but we try
 to overcome them rapidly thanks to help
 from friendly countries.
 F. Monsieur le Prime Minister, President
 Ho Chi Minh made a declaration to the Daily
 Express [London] in March 1962, referring
 to the conditions under which North Viet-
 nam would negotiate 'a settlement with the
 South.  Has  anything  happened  in  the
 meantime which would change those condi-
 tions?
 P. Our position has remained largely un-
 changed since President Ho Chi Minh's dec-
 laration.  What  has  changed,  however,                                                                               is
 the extent of American intervention in South
 Vietnam, which has eontinued to increase
 and to take over increased responsibilities.
 and  control  over  the  [Ngo Dinh] Diem
 regime.
 The real enemy is American intervention.
 It is of little importance as to who the Amer-
 ican agent in Vietnam might be.
 F. Monsieur  Is     Prime  Minister, the In-
 ternational Control Commission [composed
 of Indian, Polish, and Canadian members]
 has recently accused the North Vietnamese
 Republic of aiding and abetting the South
 Vietnamese rebellion.  What do you think of
 that accusation?
 P [deprecating gesture].  We understand,
 Monsieur Is Professeur, under which outside
 pressures the [Indian and Canadian] mem-
 bers of the ICC labor.                                                                             After all, India does
 depend  for  development  upon  large-scale
 American aid.
 F. But would it not at least be conceiv-
 able that some of the almost 100,000 South
 Vietnamese who went north  [of the 17th
 parallel] in 1954 and  whose relatives are
 now  fighting  against South  Vietnamese
 forces, would attempt to slip across your
 border back into South Vietnam in order to
 help their relatives-even without the per-
 mission of the North Vietnamese Govern-
 ment?  Wouldn't that be at least conceiv-
 able?
 P. Monsieur, in our country one does not
 cross borders without permission.
 F. Would not a spreading of the guerrilla
 war entail a real risk of American reaction
 against  North Vietnamese  territory   You
 have been to North Korea last year, Monsieur
 Is Prime Minister; you saw what American
 bombers can do.
 P  [very seriously]. We fully realize that
 the American imperialists wish to provoke a
 situation in the course of which they could
 use the heroic struggle of the South Viet-
 namese people as a pretext for the destruc-
 tion of our economic and cultural achieve-
 ments,
 We shall offerthem no pretext which could
 give rise to an American military interven-
 tion against North Vietnam.

 nounced.  Mao Tse-tung suit in suntan cot-

 H. You see, people say a lot of things that
 aren't true.  [Looks at my jacket, tape re-
 corder, book, next to me on sofa.]  My, you
 have got a lot of things with you.
 F. I am sorry, Monsieur is President [Push
 things together.  Ho sits down next to me,
 humorous gleam on face, slaps me on thigh.]
 H. So, you are the young man who is so
 much interested in all the small details about
 my life.  [In my book "Le Viet-Minh" and
 the forthcoming "Two Viet-Nams," I have at-
 tempted to include as complete a biographi-
 cal sketch of Ho Chi Minh as possible.  Dur-
 ing my stay in Hanoi, I also interviewed
 many of Ho's old friends on Ho's life, and
 he apparently had been informed of this.]
 F. Monsieur le-President, you are after all
 a public figure, and it certainly would not be
 a violation  of  a military secret to  know
 whether you had a family, or were in Russia
 at a given date.
 H. Ah, but you know, I'm an old man, a
 very old man [he's 73].  An old man likes to
 have a' little air of mystery about himself.
 I like to hold on to my little mysteries.  I'm
 sure you will understand that.
 F. But-
 H. Wait until I'm dead.  [In spite of this,
 I received just before I left Hanoi a letter
 containing six manuscript pages of details
 about Ho's life, filling in most of the gaps-
 no doubt on his own orders.]
 P. Monsieur Fall brought you a book on
 the Indochina war which contains a draw-
 ing of you by his wife.
 H   [With  an  old  man's  impatience].
 Where? Where?  Let me see it. Providing
 she's got my goatee right.   Providing the
 goatee looks all right.  [Unwraps and looks.]
 Mmm-yes, that is very good.  That looks
 very much like me.  [Looks around, grabs a
 small flower bouquet from the table, :hands
 it to me.]   Tell her for me that the draw-
 ing is very good and give her the bouquet
 and kiss her on both cheecks for me.
 P. Monsieur Fall is interested in the pres-
 ent situation in South Vietnam.
 F. Yes, Monsieur le President, how do you
 evaluate the situation In South Vietnam?
 H. Monsieur Ngo Dinh Diem is in a very
 very difficult position right now and it is not
 likely to improve in the future.  He has no
 popular support.
 F. But would you negotiate with South
 Vietnam?
 P. The situation is not eyt ripe for a real
 negotiation.  They [South Vietnamese] don't
 really want to negotiate.
 H. That is absolutely true.  They are show-
 ing no intention to negotiate.
 F. But are you not afraid that the situa-
 tion might degenerate into a protracted war?
 H  [Earnestly, turning full face.]   Mon-
 sieur le Professeur, you have studied us for
 10 years, you have written about the Indo-
 china, war.  It took us 8 years of bitter fight-
 ing to defeat you French in Indochina.                                                                                                                                 Now
 the Diem regime is well armed and helped
 by many Americans.  The Americans are
 stronger than the French.  It might perhaps
 take 10 years, but our heroic compatriots in
 the south will defeat them in the end. We
 shall marshal world public opinion about
 this unjust war against the South Vietna-
 mese people.
 P. Yes, the heroic South Vietnamese peo-
 ple will have to continue the struggle by its
 own means but we watch its efforts with the
 greatest sympathy.
 H. I think, the Americans greatly under-
 estimate  the  determination  of  the  Viet-
 namese people.  The Vietnamese people has
 always shown great determination when it
 was faced with an invader .
 F. But are you still willing to come to a
 negotiated settlement if the occasion pre-
 sented itself?
 H. Yes,  but  only with  people  who  are
 willing to sit down with us at one and the
 same  table  and  "talk."   [French word:
 "causer" which means: "negotiate In good
 faith."]
 F. You mean you would negotiate with
 any South Vietnamese Government?
 H. Yes, with any.
 F. But what kind of relations would you
 envisage?

 H. Of whatever type they [South Viet-
 namese] wish.  After all, the East and West
 Germans have flourishing trade relations in
 spite  of the Berlin Wall, haven't they?
 [After some further amenities, Ito leaves.]
 F. Monsieur 1e Prime Minister, what do
 you think of Mr. Ngo Dinh Diem's personal
 position as of right now?
 P. It is quite difficult.  He is unpopular,
 and the more unpopular he is, the' more
 American aid he will need to remain in
 power.  And the more American aid he gets,
 the more as an American puppet he'll look
 and the less likely is he to regain popularity.
 F. That sounds pretty much like a vicious
 circle, doesn't it?
 P [humorous gleam]. No, Monsieur le Pro-
 fesseur.  It is a, descending spiral.
 F. But you must understand, Monsieur le
 Prime Minister, that South Vietnam is in a
 different situation than the non-Commu-
 nist parts of Germany and Korea.  In the
 latter two cases, the non-Communist part
 is by far the more populated, whereas in
 the case of Vietnam, the non-Communist
 part has 13.8 million people against your 17
 million.  You can clearly see that they have
 good reasons to fear North Vietnam which
 also has the larger army, and one with a
 fearsome reputation, as we French well know.
 P. Certainly, we realize that we are in the
 stronger position.  Thus, we are also willing
 to give all the guarantees necessary for the
 South to be able to come our fairly [pour
 que Is Sud trouve son Compte] in such a
 negotiation.
 You will recall President He's declara-
 tion with regard to maintaining the South's
 separate government and economic system.
 The Fatherland Front embodies those points
 in its program, and the South Vietnamese
 Liberation Front likewise.
 We do not envisage an immediate reuni-
 fication and are willing to accept the verdict
 of the South Vietnamese people with re-
 gard to the institutions and policies of its
 part of the country.
 F. What, then, would be the minimal con-
 ditions under which the Democratic Repub-
 lie of Vietnam [North Vietnam] would ac-
 cept a settlement of the conflict which at
 present exists in South Vietnam?
 P [makes a statement as below].
 F. Would you object to my making a tape
 recording of that answer?  It is a reply that
 I would like to have verbatim, if possible.
 P [thinks it over, makes notes, agrees].
 P. This is a very timely question: The
 DRVN  [North Vietnam]      government has
 made sufficiently explicit declarations on the
 subject [but] let me underline what follows:
 The underlying origin and immediate cause
 of the extremely dangerous situation in the
 South of 'our country is the armed interven-
 tion of the USA and the fascist dictatorship
 of Monsieur Ngo Dinh Diem, the creation
 and instrument of that [American]  inter-
 vention,
 It is obvious, then, that in order to nor-
 malize the situation in our whole country,
 those factors of dissension must disappear.
 We support with determination the patriotic
 struggle of our Southern compatriots and the
 objectives of their struggle-I mean, the
 program of the Southern Liberation Front.
 We are certain that the massive help of all
 classes of South [Vietnam's] society and the
 active support of the peoples of the world,
 shall determine the happy outcome of the
 situation full of dangers which exist in the
 South of our country.
 The people of Vietnam and the DRVNX, gov-
 ernment remain faithful to the Geneva ac-
 cords [of July 1954) which establish our
 basic national rights.  We shall continue to
 cooperate with the International Control
 Commission on the basis of those accords,
 and hope that this cooperation sha11  be
 fruitful-providing that all members of the
 Commission respect the accords,
 F. Thank you, Monsieur le Prime Minister,
 for that statement.
 P. I would like to say something about a
 remark you made in your book on our Re-
 public about our alleged "isolationism" from
 neutral and pro-Western countries, and from
 international organizations.  No, no and no,
 we are not isolationists.  On the contrary,
 we seek "open windows" towards any coun-
 try or organization that will deal with us on
 a matter-of-fact basis.    We are willing to
 trade with them and make purchases from
 them.
 F. What would be the position of the for-
 eign community in South Vietnam, if the
 war worsens?  There are still 15,000 French
 citizens living there.
 P. As you know, the Southern Liberation
 Front has repeatedly shown that it does not
 wish to hurt the legitimate interests of the
 Europeans who live in South Vietnam.  We
 make a distinction between France's posi-
 tion and that of American imperialists.
 F. What is the 'attitude of the DRVN to-
 wards Laos and Cambodia?
 P. We shall respect the Laos accords [this
 was stated briefly` after the signature of the
 1962 Geneva accords on Laos. It has become
 obvious since then that North Vietnamese
 troops still operate in Laos to some extent,
 or travel through South Vietnam], and shall
 at all costs maintain good relations with
 Cambodia.
 EXHIBIT 6
 [From the Reporter, Oct. 24, 19631
 WHAT     DE  GAULLE  ACTUALLY  SAID  ABOUT
 VIETNAM
 (Bernard Fall)
 President de Gaulle is used to being mis-
 understood by those to whom he directs his
 more Delphic remarks, and he is particularly
 used. to being misunderstood by Washington.
 Indeed, there are times when one almost
 suspects he likes being misunderstood by
 Washington. The evidence is increasing that
 this is more or less what happened in the
 wake of Be Gaulle's recent affirmation of
 France's abiding interest in the ultimate in-
 dependence-"independence  vis-a-vis  the
 outside," as he put it-of all of Vietnam,
 North and South.  These remarks prompted
 considerable wringing of hands in Washing-
 ton (even though Walter Lippmann thought
 that De' Gaulle was right if he meant what
 Lippmann thought he meant), and many
 seemed to feel that his remarks were meant
 as merely a nettlesome intrusion into U.S.
 policy in Southeast Asia.  As usual, almost
 everybody was wrong.
 The original version of the statement in
 question was drawn up in August, just after
 the Buddhist riots had begun in Hub and
 Saigon and while the French Foreign Ministry
 was working with a skeleton vacation-time
 staff.  At De Gaulle's request, the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs had drawn up a short note
 on the subject of Vietnam.  Most Foreign-
 Ministry aids seemed to feel that what was
 going on in Vietnam was far, far, away, and
 that anyway for once it was something hap-
 pening not to the French but to somebody
 else. Thus the original note hardly went be-
 yond voicing pious hopes about religious
 tolerance, phrased in terms that were con-
 siderably weaker than the Pope's statement
 on the some subject.
 At the Elysee, one of De Gaulle's civilian
 aids redrafted the note for his chief, but
 still without going much beyond the Qual
 d'Orsay draft. The new version was submit-
 ted to De Gaulle after his return from his
 mid-August vacation and disappeared from
 view until the President himself brought it
 up at the council of ministers on August 29,
 after Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de
 Murville had made his oral report on recent
 developments in Vietnam.  The text which
 De Gaulle then regri was a radical departure
 from the Quai d'Orsay draft, with perhaps
 4675
 the sole exception of its initial phrases re-
 ferring to the "attention and emotion" with
 which "Paris views the grave events in Viet-
 nam."
 The operative paragraphs, which President
 Kennedy considered sufficiently disturbing
 to repeat 4 weeks later on the occasion of
 the departure of Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor and
 Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara
 for Vietnam, were entirely in De Gaulle's
 own hand:
 "France's knowledge of the valor of the
 (Vietnamese) people permits her to discern
 the role they could play in Asia's present
 situation, for their own progress and to the
 benefit of international understanding;  as
 soon as they could deploy their activity in
 independence vis-a-vis the outside, in peace
 and unity at home, and in concord with
 their neighbors.
 "That is what France wishes, more than
 ever today, to all of Vietnam.  It naturally
 is up to the (Vietnamese) people themselves,
 and   to  themselves  alone,  to choose  the
 means of arriving (at that result) but any
 national effort undertaken by Vietnam with
 that aim will find France ready, within the
 means at its disposal, to enter into cordial
 cooperation with that country."
 The statement, read to the assembled
 journalists at the end of the council meeting
 by  Information  Minister  Alain Peyrefitte,
 had the effect of a brick in a birdbath.  Yet
 it needs to be examined coolly to understand
 De Gaulle's meaning.
 He wants Vietnam to be reunified in inde-
 pendence.                                                                                                                                           That is a wish that every Western
 statesman trots out whenever he  visits a
 divided country like Germany, Korea, and
 Vietnam, or a city like Berlin.  It is, in fact,
 an explicit long-range aim of Western policy,
 and the price of reunification will in all
 likelihood be non-adherence to any bloc, as
 in  Austria, for example,  or nominally in
 Laos.  In the case of Vietnam (as well as of
 Germany) such reunification would actually
 be dangerous to world peace if the reunified
 country,  far stronger  regionally  than  its
 neighbors, were to embark upon a policy of
 nationalistic revanchism.  For Vietnam, that
 would mean starting where it left off when
 the French arrived in 1858: gobbling up and
 destroying Cambodia and Laos, presumably
 in collusion with Thailand.
 According to De Gaulle's statement, Viet-
 namese Independence should be arrived at
 by means chosen by the Vietnamese people
 themselves, and by "themselves alone."  Any
 "national"  effort,  i.e.,  by  the Vietnamese
 nation as a whole, would find France willing
 to give such support as it can afford.  This
 kind of vague promise is hardly designed to
 commit France to immediate action in the
 Far East.   It simply says that if by some
 unspecified miracle  the Vietnamese arrive
 at reunification-a reunification in which
 both America and the Sino-Soviets would
 lose their most obvious reasons for contin-
 uing to pay the lavish bills of their respec-
 tive Vietnamese client governments-France
 would be willing to take up, as far as pos-
 sible, the slack of the transitional crisis.  In
 quite a few cases where Russia or the United
 States or France, for one reason or another.
 cut a particular country off its payroll, an-
 other country (or the United Nations) paid
 the most urgent bills until an equilibrium of
 sorts was established.  That was about all
 there was to the De Gaulle statement.
 POOR  HOMEWORK
 It was downright amusing to see the be-
 wilderment on the faces of French officialdom
 in Paris as the storm broke.  Washington
 went into a flap and spoke unofficially but
 loudly of yet another "De Gaulle betrayal"
 of the West in general and the United States
 in particular.  French Ambassador Herve Al-
 phand was hastily summoned to the State
 Department and met with Secretary Rusk
 for more than an hour.  His subsequent

 statement, which stuck pretty closely to the
 text (always a sound policy when one tries
 to interpret Gaullist prose), obviously con-
 vinced no one, least of all the White House,
 which seems to have written off De Gaulle
 as Public Enemy No. 1. The American press,
 on cue, took up the cudgels to transform
 that two-hundred-word statement into an
 explicit bid for a French takeover in Indo-
 China, preferably in collusion with Hanoi, to
 make the treachery even blacker.
 Interviewed by Walter Cronkite on a CBS
 television program on Labor Day, President
 Kennedy voiced this reaction to the De
 Gaulle statement on Vietnam: "It was an
 impression of his general view, but he doesn't
 have any forces there or any program of
 economic assistance, so while these expres-
 sions are welcome, the burden is carried, as
 It usually is by the United States and the
 people  there.   r ? * What,  of   course,
 makes   Americans  somewhat  impatient  is
 that after carrying this load for 18 years,
 we are glad to get counsel, but we would
 like a little more assistance, real assistance"
 The words clearly showed how poorly the
 President's entourage had done his home-
 work for him.  The flat assertion that the
 French do not have any program of economic
 assistance in Vietnam is simply incorrect.
 Furthermore, it clearly shows that, on a
 public level at least, the White House still
 does not know Who exactly has a stake in
 Vietnam, and for what reason.
 In Paris, Mr. Kennedy's statement was re-
 ceived with a shrug.  "Obviously, the Ameri-
 cans  haven't understood,  or  they  don't
 choose to understand," was the reaction of
 a seasoned newspaperman from Le Monde.
 That paper and Agence France Presse had
 spelled out the French stake In South Viet-
 nam, about 17,500 French citizens still live
 there, 60,000 of whom are French-born, the
 others being of Asian, Eurasian, Indian, or
 African origin; French investments in the
 country, including important rubber planta-
 tions, total close to $500 million; and there
 is a fairly sizable French economic and
 cultural-aid program.
 In terms of actual dollar expenditures,
 French aid is not large, but it affects some
 politically  important  sectors.  There  are
 more than 340 French teachers in Vietnam.
 They are to be found from grade school
 to the university level, but are concentrated
 above all in the lycees, where tomorrow's
 elite is being trained. Close to 30,000 Viet-
 namese children go to schools staffed and
 paid for by the French cultural mission, and
 more Vietnamese are now passing the dif8-
 cult French baccalaureate examinations than
 at any time during the colonial period.  But
 French economic aid is also felt in another
 key sector: agrarian reform.  By a conven-
 tion signed on September 10, 1958, France
 agreed to advance funds to Vietnam for the
 repurchase of more than half a million acres
 of French-owned rice land...-This permitted
 the Diem regime to redistribute land free to
 the farmers without having to resort to the
 expropriation of land belonging to the Viet-
 namese landlords, many of whom were high
 officials in the regime.  The French also fi-
 nanced the only working coal mine in South
 Vietnam, the only indigenous source of fuel;
 and they donated diesel locomotives for Viet-
 nam's battered railroads.
 But there is an even more important field
 in which France plays a key role, and that is
 Vietnam's trade.  It is perhaps one of the
 unique tragedies of that poor country that
 it is more dependent now on France's taking
 its export products than at any time during
 the colonial era. The following table shows
 the whole grim problem at a glance:
 Exports to-
 France-------------
 32.2
 67.5
 42.0
 United States------
 12.0
 18. 1
 4.3
 Imports from-
 France-------------
 55.7
 24.5
 11.8
 United States_-----
 4.2
 28.0
 37.0
 France has been displaced in the import
 field, since imports now are financed by
 American aid; but in the export field few
 others but the French, who are used to them,
 seem to be willing to take Vietnamese goods.
 This French magnanimity is easily explained:
 Rubber, which in 1939 represented a healthy
 21.4 percent of all Vietnamese exports, now
 represents an unhealthy one-crop 89.6 per-
 cent-and the rubber is produced largely by
 the huge French plantations.  Like their
 counterparts in Malaya in the 1950's, French
 rubber planters are paying a heavy toll in
 lives and treasure to the insurgents.  There
 is not one plantation that has not been at-
 tacked or partly pillaged several times by
 the Vietcong during the past 5 years, and
 which has not seen several of its French
 personnel kidnapped and held for ransom
 or killed.  During the Indo-China War, the
 plantations had been allowed to arm them-
 selves and maintained militia forces at their
 own expense.  When Ngo Dinh Diem came
 to power he ordered all plantations disarmed
 and they thus became military liabilities.
 The plantation managers now keep in
 business by closing their eyes to the Viet-
 cong emissaries who come to the workers'
 villages and exact tribute; they silently pay
 millions of piastres of ransom to the Viet-
 cong-and as much again to bribe South
 Vietnamese authorities .to allow them to
 operate.  Here and there, the Saigon-con-
 trolled press announces that a French plan-
 tation was fined tens of millions of piastres
 (a million dollars or more)  for "economic
 violations."  SEverybody knows what that
 means, and business goes on as usual.
 Those Frenchmen and their property are
 hostages to both sides in South Vietnam's
 messy war.    A brief visit to the Syndicat des
 Planteurs de Caoutchouc in Paris gives an
 eloquent picture of what this means:  "It
 means," says one of the officials, "that we
 are being told by the Vietcong that if we
 don't cooperate, our trees will be slashed
 and personnel killed.  And when we do pay
 our 'blood money,' the Government's district
 chief comes and fines us exactly the same
 amount.  There will come the day when the
 whole damned thing simply becomes too
 expensive to carry on, and we'll all go home,
 and Vietnam's last economic mainstay will
 collapse. After all, should the Americans
 pull out tomorrow, they'll simply create a
 beachhead around Saigon and fly out their
 military personnel and few local residents.
 But our 17,000 Frenchmen are spread out all
 over the country and there'll be a blood bath
 like back in 1945 when the Vietminh took
 over, or in 1960 in the Congo."
 It is obvious, then, that renewed French
 preoccupations  with Vietnam stem from
 reasons that are more realistic than the
 desire to nettle the young men in Wash-
 ington while their policies are in disarray.
 BY NHU OUT OF ALSOP
 But that first row had barely simmered
 down when its second round broke out from
 a not entirely unexpected quarter.  Joseph
 Alsop, who 'for the past 5 years has been a
 self-appointed spokesman for the Ngo Dinh
 Diem view of the outside world, arrived in
 time in Saigon to discover evidence of ugly
 stuff, to which he gave maximum play in his
 syndicated column of September 18.  Fur-
 ther embroidering on the theme of De
 Gaulle's alleged desire to inherit the Viet-
 namese mess, Alsop interviewed Ngo Dinh
 Nhu and came away with the following in-
 telligence,  all  directly  gathered from the
 lips of Diem's official political adviser, head
 of the secret police, and chief anti-Ameri-
 can:
 The French representative in North Viet-
 nam, Jacques de Buzon, had seen Nhu to-
 gether with French Ambassador Lalouette
 and had brought him an offer from Ho Chi
 Minh  to  negotiate-presumably  via  the
 French and behind the back of the United
 States.
 The Polish member of the Indian-Cana-
 dian-Polish International Control Commis-
 sion (ICC) in Vietnam had come to see Nhu
 at Lalouette's behest with a message from
 North Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong.
 Nhu had not even told his brother Diem
 of all this for fear of causing a stir.
 The reaction in France was immediate.
 To the French, who know of Alsop's close
 relations with President Diem, this seemed
 one more deliberate attempt to blame the
 French colonialists for everything that was
 going wrong in Vietnam. Officially, the Quai
 d'Orsay simply said the article "does not
 even merit a denial."  Unofficially, however,
 the following facts soon came to light:
 De Buzon, who had taken over his job
 in Hanoi only very recently, had never been
 to Saigon at all, as the flight records of'the
 ICC aircraft testify, and there is no other way
 of getting from Hanoi to Saigon except by
 rowboat across the 17th parallel along the
 coast of the South China Sea.
 The Polish "ICC" member, after years of
 being snubbed, had suddenly been invited
 to Diem's receptions-a fact which American
 newsmen had reported.  Lalouette had never
 presented the Pole to Nhu.
 As noted in the semi-official La Nation,
 the newspaper of De Gaulle's "UNR" party, if
 Nhu wanted  to keep    the whole thing a
 secret from his brother, why did he give
 the story to Alsop to plaster all over the
 world?
 What had happened is that Nhu cleverly
 used Alsop to strengthen his own bargaining
 position in his life-and-death struggle with
 the United States.  This was obvious from
 August 31, when Saigon almost immediately
 hailed the De Gaulle statement as "not being
 critical of our position" and chose to inter-
 pret Diem's resistance to American demands
 for reform as an aspect of its own policy of
 struggle for "external independence."  Nhu
 sought (and still seeks) to bolster the myth
 that he has two fallback positions: if the
 Americans let him down, he can always turn
 to the French; and if they let him down, he
 can always make a deal with Hanoi where, he
 says, he and his brother are greatly admired.
 Alsop realized that he was out on a limb;
 In his next column he backtracked by giving
 the world a description of the Gia-Long
 Palace in Saigon (where the Ngo Dinhs hide
 from their people)  which resembled H. R.
 Tervor-Roper's description of Hitler's bunker
 In its last days, and which makes both Diem
 and Nhu look like paranoiacs.  But having
 said that Nhu's egotism goes "beyond normal
 vanity" and that Diem has "lost his ability
 to see events or problems in their true pro-
 portions," Alsop nevertheless returns to his
 idee fire that Paris has nothing else in mind
 or in store for Saigon but a "Communist
 takeover * * * by courtesy of the French."
 It is certain that De Gaulle, and for that
 matter any Frenchman seriously concerned
 with southeast Asia, is less than happy with

 the way things have been going in South
 Vietnam of lgte-but this is a view that many
 Americans share with them, including some
 leading personages in Washington.  The real
 problem (beyond the extremely serious one
 of emotional overreaction in Washington
 whenever the name "De Gaulle" comes up)
 is that nothing better than "swimming with
 Diem"-and Nhu, of course-has been pro-
 posed anywhere.  As a consequence, French
 Ambassador Lalouette was placed in the
 strange  position of  apparently  lecturing
 newly arrived U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
 Lodge on the merits of the present Saigon
 rulers.  In 1955, the French tried to get rid
 of Diem; they got thrown out of Vietnam
 for their pains and have not forgotten the
 lesson.
 Alsop's suggestion of French negotiations
 on behalf,of Hanoi might be an interesting,
 even a clever idea.  But, as I was able to
 judge there for myself, De Buzon's predeces-
 sors In Hanoi were, in the words of Georges
 Chaffard  in  Le  Monde  of  September  3,
 "filled with a visceral hatred of all that was
 Communist."   They were not even received
 by Hanoi's top leaders, let alone used as mes-
 sengers for negotiations.                      The French have
 no illusions about what their role would be
 in a reunified Vietnam dominated by Hanoi:
 almost all their properties in North Vietnam,
 worth close to $1 billion, have been confis-
 cated, all their missionaries were expelled,
 and for the privilege of being able to main-
 tain two teachers of French and one school
 administrator at one lycee, they must pay
 for the upkeep of the whole establishment.
 French trade with North Vietnam is $2 mil-
 lion a year; with South Vietnam it is far
 greater.
 On the whole, it seems difficult thus far to
 ascribe much more to De Gaulle's statement
 than an understandable desire to be heard
 on an issue in which the French feel, rightly
 or wrongly, that they may once more become
 the scapegoats; or worse, the victims.

 MACV, MACT, MAAG: PAPERWORK Is A TIGER
 TO UNITED STATES
 (By Jim Lucas)
 CAN THO, SOUTH VIETNAM, March 6.-To
 understand               anything  at  all  about  this
 strange little war, it helps to examine some
 of the organization problems.
 For one thing, the command structure-
 ours and the Vietnamese-is grotesque. Like
 Topsy, it just growed.
 On our part, we have MACV  (Military
 Assistance Command, Vietnam) headed by
 Gen. Paul Harkins.  General Harkins also is
 MACT (Military Assistance Command, Thai-
 land).
 ADVISORY TEAMS
 Then, we have MAAG (Military Advisory
 Assistance Group)   headed by Maj.  Gen.
 Charles Timmes. MAAG has been here since
 the early  1950's.   It controls the advisory
 teams.
 Then there is a support command, headed
 by Brig. Gen. Joe Stilwell, Jr.  It controls
 the operating troops, such as the helicopter
 crews.  Theoretically, they are here to sup-
 port the Vietnamese.  In practice, they are
 fighting a war.
 On top of all this, we have a "country
 team" headed by Ambassador Henry Cabot
 Lodge, who is a major general in the Army
 Reserve.
 HORRENDOUS
 Men in the field often work for all three
 commands. They must submit reports to all
 three.  The paperwork is horrendous.
 There are rumors that Lt. Gen. William
 C.  Westmoreland  will  abolish  MACV or
 MAAG when he succeeds General Harkins.
 The troops devoutly hope this is true.  Gen-
 eral Westmoreland is now General Harkins'
 deputy.
 The Vietnamese have four categories of
 troops in the field, some working for the
 Ministry of Defense, others for the Ministry
 of Interior.
 At the lowest level, there is the hamlet
 militia.  They work in squads.  They have,
 at most, one automatic weapon.  If they are
 paid at all, it is by the people they protect.
 Usually it is in rice.
 Next, there is the Self-Defense Corps.  It
 is organized in platoons, and slightly better
 armed.  Its men are paid $9 a month.
 THIRD ECHELON
 Third echelon is the civil guard.  Roughly
 it compares with our National Guard.  It is
 organized into companies.  Its men draw $12
 a month.
 Finally, there is the ARVIN (Army of the
 Republic of Vietnam).  It is organized into
 regiments, divisions and corps.  Its men qre
 much better paid.  They have fairly modern
 weapons.
 On top of this, there is the Vietnamese
 JGS (Joint General Staff), comparable to our
 Joint Chiefs of Staff. And to add to the con-
 fusion, the Province Chiefs (Governors) are
 majors, and the district chiefs under them
 captains and first lieutenants.  Each has his
 own troops.  Each Province Chief has a U.S.
 Army major as his adviser.
 BETTER PAID
 Though the ARVIN Is better paid and bet-
 ter armed, it is the civil guard that bears
 the brunt of the war.  The average ARVIN
 battalion goes 2 weeks without making con-
 tact with the Vietcong.  An average civil
 'guard company is fighting 2 days out of 3.
 There are reasons for this contrast.  The
 civil guard is smaller (company-size units).
 It has less fire power; no artillery.  Its men
 are  sketchily  trained.   It  does  not have
 enough good officers, consequently it is not
 so well led.
 But the big reason the guard sees more ac-
 tion is psychological, and the Vietcong are
 canny enough to exploit that.     A civil guard
 company is a local unit. These boys grew up
 in the province  where they're stationed.
 Everybody knows them.
 KILLED
 If the Vietcong can chew up a civil guard
 company, they effectively assert their rule
 over that area.  A man joins the civil guard
 one week, and they bring his body home the
 next.  That night, the Vietcong slip In and
 tell his widow, "we killed your man because
 he opposed us."
 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, will
 the Senator Yield?
 Mr. GRUENING.  I yield.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  I regret that I did
 not hear the entire address by the Sena-
 tor from Alaska. I do not know whether
 I am prepared to agree with all the con-
 clusions he has drawn without having
 had an opportunity to study the text of
 his proposal.  But as one Member of the
 Senate who is much interested in the se-
 curity of our country and the peace of
 the world, I commend the Senator from
 Alaska for the thoughtful questions that
 he has raised today.
 I wonder if the Senator is aware of
 the fact that 10 years ago, almost to the
 day, the then Senator John Kennedy, of
 Massachusetts, made a similar speech
 with reference to French involvement in
 French Indochina.  On that day, the
 Senator from Massachusetts ticked off
 a list of overly optimistic estimates that
 had been made by French military lead-
 ers about the success of the war in
 French Indochina, some of those esti-
 mates being shared by our own military
 strategists.  Senator Kennedy warned
 against some of the sterile possibilities
 that faced the French if they continued
 what appeared to the Senator from Mas-
 sachusetts to be a futile effort in South-
 east Asia.
 It is quite ironical that that speech
 should have been made in April 1954.
 Thirty days later, the French cause was
 abandoned in French Indochina, and for
 the past decade we have been seeking,
 with questionable success, to carry on
 the same policy.
 Mr. GRUENING.  I thank the Senator
 from South Dakota for his valuable con-
 tribution to the discussion.  The fact is
 that Senator Kennedy as Senator did not
 make foreign policy.  It was made by the
 Eisenhower administration-by the Pres-
 ident and by Secretary of State John
 Foster Dulles. When John Kennedy be-
 came President 6 years later, he in-
 herited the situation and tried for 3
 years to do something about it.  Consid-
 ering the experience of failure to rectify
 what had been done during those 3 years,
 there has now been a total failure for
 a whole decade, with a steady loss of
 American lives.
 It is high time to reassess our policy
 and ascertain why we are in Vietnam,
 why we should continue to be there, and
 why we should continue to sacrifice the
 lives of American boys for people who
 will not fight for themselves. We should
 not remain there. We should make the
 best deal possible before withdrawing,
 but in any event we should withdraw our
 men from the fighting front immediately.
 We should supply the South Vietnamese
 with all kinds of arms. But this is their
 war.  We should try, by reassessing our
 policy, to bring an end to the tragedy
 that has taken place in the last 10 years.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  I appreciate the
 point the Senator has made.  Speaking
 for myself, I would view both our involve-
 ment in Vietnam and any possible re-
 evaluation of our position there as a bi-
 partisan or nonpartisan matter. I would
 hope we could take the Vietnamese issue
 out of partisan politics and consider it
 from the standpoint of what is best for
 our country and what will make the most
 likely contribution to the cause of peace.
 I thank the Senator from Alaska for
 yielding.
 Mr. GRUENING.  I agree that the
 policy should be nonpartisan and should
 remain nonpartisan.  This issue is far
 too serious to be permitted to deterio-
 rate into a matter of partisan politics.
 The reason this question is pertinent
 is that President Johnson, only recently
 arrived in office, is the heir of all these
 policies, and now he has an opportunity
 to reassess them.  I believe he should
 do so.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  I think the Senator
 from Alaska will agree that it is impor-
 tant to determine the best course for
 us to follow now, rather than to attempt
 to assess the blame for what has hap-
 pened.
 Mr. GRUENING.  I agree that we
 should not assess the blame.  But we
 should learn from experience.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Mr. President, I
 thank the Senator from Alaska for
 yielding to me.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                March 10
 Mr. GRUENING.  I thank the Sen-
 ator from South Dakota.
 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  Mr. President,
 will the Senator from Alaska yield
 briefly to me?
 Mr. GRUENING.  I yield.
 Mr.  SALTONSTALL. The  Senator
 from Alaska has made a very thought-
 ful speech, although I would not agree
 with some of the conclusions he has
 reached.
 I certainly feel, as does the Senator
 from South Dakota, that this is not a
 partisan matter in any way, and that
 what President Eisenhower and Secre-
 tary Dulles did 10 and 12 years ago was
 done under different conditions in the
 Far East and also under different world
 conditions. How well that policy finally
 work out, we cannot say at the moment.
 But I wish to point out that the pres-
 ent administration has sent one of its
 leading and most responsible officials to
 Vietnam, to determine what we should
 do now; I refer to Secretary McNamara.
 In my opinion, our policy in regard to
 Vietnam also involves our policies in re-
 gard to other areas, including Malaysia,
 New Zealand, Australia, and also our
 concern in Korea, and even our relation-
 ships with the Philippines.  All those
 questions and others are involved, as I
 see the matter, in our policy in regard to
 South Vietnam at the moment. Also in-
 volved is our prestige in Panama, in
 Cuba, and in the countries of South
 America, if we quit South Vietnam.
 So, as the Senator from Alaska has
 said, the President has a very difficult
 decision to make; and certainly it can-
 not be made very quickly or with rela-
 tion to only one situation.
 All of us very much deplore the loss
 of the lives of Americans in South Viet-
 nam, and we hope no more Americans
 will lose their lives there.  However, I
 believe we must give the present ad-
 ministration an opportunity to view this
 matter-particularly after sending the
 Secretary of Defense there-in light of
 all the conditions in the areas I have
 named, as well as those existing in South
 Vietnam alone.
 I agree with the Senator from Alaska
 that the people of South Vietnam must
 fight for themselves; if they do not, we
 cannot fight for them.
 Mr. GRUENING.  I confess that I
 was shocked to read in the newspapers
 of the extravagant promises which Sec-
 retary McNamara has been making-
 promises of all-out U.S. aid.  In my
 Judgment, he has no business to make
 such commitments.  He went there at
 the direction of the President to study
 and report to the President, and what
 authority he has to make such promises,
 I do not know.
 If we are to have an all-out war there,
 it is for Congress to declare such a war.
 So I believe it unfortunate that Secre-
 tary McNamara has spoken so freely.  I
 believe it would have been much better
 if he had kept quiet, returned to this
 country and had reported to his chief
 and let him make the commitments.
 I address this question to all Sena-
 tors--not on a personal basis, because
 the question is already answered insofar
 as I am concerned: If a . Senator's son
 were to be drafted in the current draft,
 under the conscription act, and were sent
 to Vietnam, and were killed there, would
 that Senator feel that his son had died
 in the defense of our country?  Per-
 sonally, I would not.
 In South Vietnam we have been sup-
 port corrupt and evil regimes and we
 have done it all alone.  We are losing
 men there every day; while the South
 Vietnamese people will not fight for
 themselves.
 Mr. President, I yield the floor.
 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT O;
 of the motion  of  Mr.  MANSFIELD  to
 proceed the consideration of the bill
 (H.R. 7152) to enforce the constitutional
 right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon
 the district courts of the United States
 to provide injunctive relief against dis-
 crimination in public accommodations, to
 authorize the Attorney General to in-
 stitute suits to protect constitutional
 rights in public facilities and public edu-
 cation, to extend the Commission on Civil
 Rights, to prevent discrimination in fed-
 erally assisted programs, to establish a
 Commission on Equal Employment Op-
 portunity, and for other purposes.
 SPARKMAN DEBATES PROCEDURE ON H.R. 7152
 Mr. SPARKMAN.  Mr. President, we
 now have before us a motion to proceed
 with the consideration of H.R. 7152, the
 so-called civil rights bill.  As the dis-
 tinguishedsenior Senator from Georgia
 pointed out yesterday afternoon, in the
 normal course of events in the Senate,
 a motion to proceed to the consideration
 of any specific bill on the calendar is
 usually decided without debate.  How-
 ever, I could not agree more with the
 same distinguished Senator's further re-
 marks to the effect that there has been
 nothing normal, usual, or ordinary about
 the processes which have brought H.R.
 7152 to the calendar of the Senate.
 Rather, the contortions involved in the
 parliamentary travels of this bill have
 been as extraordinary as any that I have
 witnessed since I first came to serve in
 this august body.
 Let us now consider briefly the strange
 machinations which have brought this
 bill to its present place on the calendar
 of the Senate.
 The first comprehensive hearings of
 this proposed legislation were held by a
 subcommittee of the House Judiciary
 Committee.  The members of this sub-
 committee were specially selected pro-
 ponents of this type of legislation, seem-
 ingly chosen for their great support of
 this cause. Then, in executive session,
 that subcommittee wrote a bill which
 has been discussed in some detail by the
 full committee.
 However, the proponents of the bill
 had some controversy among themselves
 as to where credit for the bill should go.
 The essence of the matter was that,
 overnight, the bill which the subcommit-
 tee had considered for 6 months was
 dropped like a hot potato. With no de-
 bate, no careful examination, a new bill
 was rammed through the committee.
 With reference to this new bill, six mem-
 bers of the House Judiciary Committee
 stated :
 This legislation fa being reported to the
 House without the benefit of any considera-
 tion, debate, or study of the bill by any
 subcommittee or committee of the House
 and without any member of any committee
 or subcommitte being granted an opportu-
 nity to Offer amendments to the bill.  This
 legislation is the most radical proposal in the
 mmittee of the House or Senate.  It was
 awn in secret meetings held between cer-
 certain select persons, to the exclusion of
 other committee members.
 Thus were the rights of the minority
 trampled ruthlessly under foot.
 I wish to make clear that that is not a
 charge which I am making; I am merely
 quoting from the minority views of the
 members of the House Judiciary Com-
 mittee.
 It was just as bad on the floor of the
 other body. The combined leadership of
 the House supported the bill, despite its
 unusual birth.  Under this prod, along
 with what has been described as the most
 intensive and extensive lobbying seen in
 Washington in many years, the House
 passed the bill.
 We all know that the bill went on the
 calendar of the Senate by a procedure
 which many of us felt to be in violation
 of the rules of the Senate, and certainly
 in disregard of the rules of the Senate.
 However, the proponents of this legisla-
 tion defeated us by sheer numbers.
 Legislation similar to certain portions
 of House bill 7152 has been given con-
 sideration by committees of the Senate.
 However, there has been no committee
 consideration of most of this bill, which
 is 55 pages long and has 11 titles.
 Therefore, it is essential that the nu-
 merous aspects of this proposed legisla-
 tion be given more careful consideration.
 If this consideration is not going to be
 given in committee, I propose, along with
 my teammates, to give it a thorough air-
 ing on the Senate floor.
 My concern over following proper Sen-
 ate procedures is especially magnified
 in view of the seriousnessof the measure
 in question.
 Mr. President, I digress to say that
 while over the next several weeks of
 debate on the long, intricate so-called
 civil rights bill, involving many legal
 and constitutional questions-questions
 that have not had a thorough going-
 over by committees, as is designed in our
 legislative setup, while we must of ne-
 cessity spend considerable time on the
 floor of the Senate trying to find out
 what the bill proposes and what the con-
 stitutional questions involved are, there
 will be piling up a logjam of badly
 needed proposed legislation.
 Today the Committee on Banking and
 Currency meta Thre or four or five
 bills are ready for consideration. There
 is considerable interest in having some
 of them passed. We decided that there
 was no need to hold an executive ses-
 sion of the committee to consider the
 bills, because we knew they would be
 held up during the entire time occupied
 by the present debate.
 There is a very important housing bill
 upon which hearings have been com-
