 PENETRATION OF AFRICA VIA THE'TAN=ZAM RAILROAD
 25X1C10b
 1.  The construction of the Tan-Zam Railroad, now in progress,
 will provide a 1200-mile rail link between the rich copperbelt of
 Zambia and the Indian Ocean port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania,
 thereby freeing land-locked Zambia.f rem dependence on white-
 minority regimes for an outlet to the sea,  Construction of the
 railroad also brings into sharp focus the foreign policy objectives
 of Communist China, as reflected in its huge subsidy of men, money
 and materials for this project,  It is a major step in the Communist
 Chinese objective of increasing its influence and enlarging its
 presence in Africa,
 2,  The railroad is Communist: China's most important foreign
 aid project, and for it the regime has granted an interest-free
 loan of almost $400 million, divided equally between Tanzania
 and Zambia; both are considered major influence targets of China.
 Among all African countries the Chinese Communist presence is
 strongest:in Tanzania where they have steadily increased their
 investment and involvement, and where they have identified them-
 selves with President Nyerere's commitment to liberate the white-
 dominated blacks of south Africa.  In addition to the railroad,
 Peking is helping to build a naval. base in Tanzania, is training
 and equipping the 10,000-man Tanzanian army, known as the Tanzanian
 People's Defence Force, and is aiding the air force,  Chinese
 Communist military aid to Tanzania is by itself estimated between
 $10-$15 million.  Other Tanzanian projects in which Communist
 Chinese aid is involved include a state farm, construction of a
 stadium and a saw mill.  In Zambia they are helping to build a
 major highway between Lusaka and Choma, and three broadcasting
 stations near Lusaka,
 3, The probable motives underlying such heavy Communist
 Chinese in.vol?: ement in East Africa
 25X1C10b
 a)  The Chinese decision to undertake the railroad
 project demonstrates not only that Peking is willing to
 take on a project that was turned down by the West, but
 it also provides a showcase for displaying Chinese
 technical capabilities.  (This despite a recent report
 that, a railroad tunnel has collapsed, killing three
 Chinese and about twenty Africans, and another report
 of a British TV documentary on the construction work:
 The film showed Chinese workers loading flatcars with
 rails which had been pre-laid in concrete ties.  The
 rails were stacked vertically and then moved down the
 tracks to be set down, one after another, as sections

 Approved For Release 1                 79-01194A000300050001-8
 of a ladder might be laid end to end,  According to one
 who saw the film, this seems to be a fast method of track-
 laying, but the railroad has a slightly "meandering" appearance.
 Presumably it will be adequate for slow-moving freight if not
 for crack passenger trains,)
 b)  Commitment to the railroad ostensibly puts the
 Chinese Communists squarely on the side of African nationalism,
 since it is probably viewed by other African countries as a
 major Chinese effort to support Zambia in its struggle to
 have its own route to the sea; thus no longer having to rely
 so greatly on transportation routes through Rhodesian and
 Portuguese African territory.  Likewise, their almost exclusive
 presence in Tanzania gives the Chinese Communists access to
 the numerous southern African insurgent groups based there.
 Furthermore, if Nyerere fears possible retaliation from the
 south for harboring the liberation movements, he probably
 believes that it would be only the Chinese who would give
 him any substantial support against the countries of southern
 Africa,.
 The railroad project provides the Chinese with an
 easy means of infiltrating their own propagandists and
 revolutionists into Africa.  Of the estimated total work
 force of 50,000, there are already close to 15,000 so-called
 Chinese technicians posted in the-area -- outnumbering the
 Tanzanian army by several thousand.  Most of them are reported
 to be soldiers in the engineering or signal corps of the
 Chinese People's Liberation Army, and among them are doubtless
 experts in propaganda and in guerrilla warfare   Assuming
 that the railroad will require a long period of maintenance
 by Chinese technical personnel, once it is completed, and
 given the fact that many such Chinese workers traditionally
 remain for years in the areas where they have worked on
 building projects, they can probably count on solid and
 prolonged entrenchment in this areas.
 (i)  With such entrenchment, enhanced as it will be by
 the railroad, the Chinese will be within easy reach of the
 vast natural resources of Central Africa with its cobalt,
 copper, gold, diamonds and other minerals, as well as its
 natural agricultural wealth,
 e)  Since the Chinese are trying to develop a long-range
 missile capability and are therefore probably considering the
 Indian Ocean as a likely test impact area, they would then
 need monitoring facilities near this area, and a land-based
 facility in East Africa would have many advantages over an
 instrumentation ship,

 4, Since construction began on the railroad last  ear  there
 have been reports of a variety of new problems

 a)  Under the terms of the aid agreement, about half
 of the credit for the railroad project is being used to
 finance imports for sale locally to defray the cost of the
 Africans' participation,  However, the commodity imports
 from Communist China during the past year have not been
 sufficient to provide the required local revenue,  This
 has stemmed from high import prices, the poor quality of
 many.Chinese goods, uncertain shipping dates and Chinese
 inability to guarantee a steady flow of spare parts for
 someof the imported equipment,
 b)  African workers on the project are becoming
 increasingly disgruntled about work conditions:  They feel
 that: salaries are too low, the workday is too long and
 that the work shifts are badly timed for workers to get
 adequate transportation to their homes  They have also
 complained that the key jobs are all held by the Chinese,
 and even some of the menial jobs have been taken over
 by the Chinese.  These conditions, plus growing racial
 tensions, have led the Africans to threaten a strike if
 the situation is not soon improved.

 Railroad: It was written in 1969 and contains a wealth of
 information useful for propaganda.  Your attention is called
 in particular to Section 4, "Possible Chinese Gains," for
 several additional themes,  Also attached is material from the
 U.S. and foreign press which provide analysis and comment on the
 Chinese involvement in Africa.. Although most of these appeared
 last year, before or at the time construction on the railroad
 began, they contain themes still valid for our purposes,

 THE TAN-ZAM RAILWAY
 1.   Background
 Serious interest in a railroad connecting the Zambian
 Copperbelt to the Tanzanian Indian Ocean port of Dar es
 Salaam dates to the early 1950's%  In 1951, Sir Alexander
 Gibbs and Partners undertook a feasibility study on behalf
 of the government of the territory of Northern Rhodesia
 with the purpose of determining the possibilities deriving
 from a rail link between Northern Rhodesia and Tanganyika.
 The firm's conclusion was that such a railroad would not be
 economically viable although it might provide political and
 strategic. advantages to the territories concerned.  With
 decisions for Northern Rhodesia being made in Salisbury,
 the huge cost was the dominant consideration, and the
 scheme was shunted aside.
 In the election campaign in Northern Rhodesia in 1962,
 the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the present
 ruling party in Zambia, focused on the political rather
 than the economic benefits of the rail line and exploited
 the rail issue to its advantage.  UNIP argued against
 dependence on Rhodesia for exporting Zambian copper and
 importing almost everything that Zambia needed.  Victorious
 in the ellection of January 1964, UNIP under President
 Kenneth Kaunda undertook to carry out its campaign pledge
 for the Tanzanian-Zambian Railway (see the map, inside
 front cover) and requested the International Bank for
 Reconstruction and Development (IBRD - World Bank) for a
 loan to build the line.
 The government of Zambia was joined in its request to
 the IBRD'by the government of Tanzania.  President Julius
 Nyerere saw the rail line as an opportunity to open up the
 agricultural potential of the Kilombero Valley and the
 mineral resources of the Mbeya area, both stymied by a lack
 of transport.  A recent survey indicated a potential of 300
 million tons of coal and 45 million tons of iron ore south
 of the area through which the railroad would pass.  In
 addition, Tanzania expects to share in the revenue result-
 ing from the passage of Zambian copper shipments through
 its territory.
 The Tanzanian-Zambian request was rejected by the IBRD,
 which concluded after a survey that the railroad would cost
 some $162 million and would operate at a-loss?until about
 1990.  Later the cost estimate was revised upward to $390
 million.  The IBRD noted in its report that transport
 through Rhodesia'`s existing railroads was economically more

 sensible, that no political development was really likely
 to disrupt it, that the Zambian economy was unlikely to be
 able to afford a second railroad system, and that if routes
 were needed to the north and east, a road system would be
 economically more feasible.  These findings were confirmed
 by two further surveys, one by East African Railways and
 another by Lonrho.
 As Rhodesia's threat to proclaim a Unilateral Declara-
 tion of Independence from the UK approached, the sense of
 urgency that the Zambians felt toward the Tan-Zam Railway
 increased'.  Zambian dependence o,n Rhodesian railroads was a
 political handicap to any Zambian government, however much
 more sensible economically such an alternative might be.
 During 1964 and 1965, Tanzania and Zambia, alone or in
 concert, sought assistance from the US, the UK, Canada,
 West Germany and Japan -- public or private, as individual
 contributors or in consortium -- but to no avail.  All the
 western countries made reference to the 1964 IBRD report as
 the basis for their refusal to subscribe to the under-
 writing of the railroad and instead offered to assist in
 the improvement of road facilities.  In despperation,
 Tanzania had even turned to the USSR for?help in August
 1964 but was rejected outright by the Soviets who refused
 not only to build the railroad but even to conduct a survey.
 It was then that Nyerere seriously looked to Communist
 China for assistance.
 The Initial Tanzanian approach to the Chinese for aid
 may have taken place as early as July 1964 during a visit
 by Vice President Kawawa to Peking.  A more urgent request
 for assistance probably was made by President Nyerere
 during his trip to China in February 1965.  In any event,
 in July 1965 Nyerere announced that China was willing to
 help.  A month later a Chinese'survey team arrived in
 Tanzania.  The team studied the proposed route in Tanzania,
 but not in Zambia, and remained in the country for several
 months.  Although their report, in Chinese and Swahili,
 turned out to be of little help, the Chinese indicated a
 willingness to undertake a more comprehensive survey and
 even to build the railroad.
 While Tanzania concentrated on seeking Chinese
 Communist aid, Kaunda continued to seek aid from the West
 because of his preference for Western financing and his
 concern over Chinese political intentions in Africa.
 Finally in September 1965 -- just two months before
 Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence,-the UK
 and Canada agreed to finance a $420,000 feasibility survey

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 which was carried out by?three firms headed by Maxwell'
 Stamp Associates, a British economic consultant firm.  The
 survey was: completed in August 1966, and the resultant
 Stamp report recommended that the project be undertaken and
 concluded that the high capital investment was justifiable
 on economic grounds even if there were no political objec-
 tions to using Rhodesia Railways.  To handle the increase
 in Zambian, traffic assumed by the report, the -Rh*ode'sia
 system itself would have to make a large capital increase.
 The Stamp report put the cost of construction and
 rolling stock for the Tan-Zam Railway at $353 million, in
 addition to $33 million required to enlarge the harbor at
 Dar es Salaam to handle annually an estimated 2.5 million
 tons more of cargo.  Thus the total cost would be $386
 million on the assumption that the railroad were built by
 :modern construction techniques.
 On the. basis of assumptions that (a) the line would be
 completed by the mid-1970's; (b) almost all of Zambia's
 non-fuel traffic would be transferred from existing routes
 through Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola to the new line,
 bringing total freight on the line to more than 4 million
 tons by 1981; and (c) operating costs per ton-mile would
 rank among the lowest of the world's railroads and would be
 nearly 30 percent below those of Rhodesia Railways, the
 report estimated that by 1981 revenues would reach about
 $100 million and profits almost $52 million.
 Complete comparisons of railroad versus road systems
 have not been made, but copperbelt experts have pointed out
 that most of the rail traffic would travel the full 1,000
 plus miles, of the railroad.  American and Western European
 arguments for the superiority of roads assume that traffic
 will be picked up and let off at many points along the
 route, an assumption which is not valid for the Tan-Zam
 Railway.
 On the: basis of the Stamp report, Zambia'hoped that a
 consortium of the UK, US, West Germany, Japan and the IBRD
 could be formed to pay for an engineering survey and even-
 tually for; construction of,the railroad.  It was largely
 this hope which kept Zambia -- and through Zambia, Tanzania
 from pursuing any Chinese offer of assistance during
 1966.  Early in 1967 the Starr  report was submitted to the
 African Development Bank (ADB) and to the IBRD for joint
 review and financial assistance.  This was the second time
 that the IBRD reviewed the project.  Experts from the
 United Nations Development Program were also asked to
 review the report.

 In March 1967 the.ADB and the IBRD issued.a report
 sharply criticizing the Stamp surveys economic analysis
 and recommending a re-examination of its findings.  Addi-
 tional technical studies were also suggested for both the
 railroad and the-port of Dar, es Salaam before a decision
 could be taken to finance an engineering study.  Zambia and
 Tanzania indicated their willingness to allow the IBRD and
 ADB to undertake further technical studies, but they refused
 to permit a re-examination of the-projectts economic feasi-
 bility.  The United Nations Development Program experts
 reached conclusions similar to those of the ADB-IBRD review.
 Stamp's traffic projections and revenue forecasts for
 the proposed railroad were overly optimistic.  Zambia is
 unlikely to transfer all of its non-fuel traffic to the new
 line as many of its imports will continue to come from
 South Africa  and Rhodesia because of lower prices.  More-
 over, Rhodesia is likely to insist on a share of Zambian
 traffic in exchange for low railway rates on coal shipments
 and other goods.   As a result, revenues would be substan-
 tially less than Stamp estimated.  The IBRD, for example,
 estimates that roughly 50 percent of Zambia's imports and
 about 20 percent of its exports will continue to be shipped
 over existing routes.  The IBRD believes that the railroad
 would carry less than 3 million tons of freight in 1981 and
 that revenues would be roughly one-half those estimated by
 Stamp.  The lower traffic levels would result in higher
 operating costs per ton-mile because,of high fixed costs.
 The low operating costs envisioned by Stamp seem to be .m-
 realistic in the light of experience on the Rhodesia
 Railways, which now.handles the bulk of the traffic to be,
 carried by the new line and which is an efficiently run
 system.  The anticipated revenue of the line does not
 provide an adequate basis for financing the project.
 The railroad would result in few economic gains for
 Zambia and Tanzania.  Zambia's northeastern region, through
 which the railroad would pass, has little development
 potential.  The area is sparsely populated and for the most
 part the land is infertile and can support little more than
 subsistence agriculture.  Although deposits of manganese,
 coal, copper and a few,other minerals are located along the
 proposed right of way, they are small.  While Tanzania
 would earn some foreign exchange from transit services
 provided to Zambia, few other benefits may be expected.
 The government's scheme to develop the relatively fertile
 Kilombero Valley in the southwest would require large
 investment and numerous skilled personnel -- both of which
 are in critically short supply in Tanzania.  Also, much of
 the area through which the railroad would pass is infested

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194AO00300050001-8
 with Tsetse fly, and the population is small and widely
 scattered.  Some minerals are located in southwest Tanzania,
 including the Songwe coalfields, but the deposits are
 generally of poor quality and not commercially exploitable,
 even with relatively low-cost rail transport.
 Zambian goods are expected to account for almost all
 the railroad's tonnage.  Tanzanian traffic would'be very
 small because southwestern Tanzania is largely unpopulated
 and the country does not have the capital or skilled man-
 power needed to develop the region.  Some traffic would
 also come from the Katanga copperbelt, but the amount would
 not be very great.  Congolese exports over Rhodesia Railways
 now total less than 10,000 tons annually, and it is unlikely
 that all of this traffic would be diverted to the Tan-Zam
 railroad.
 Outbound traffic on the railroad would consist almost
 entirely of copper, and the inbound traffic of a wide
 variety of imports.  The railroad would not carry POL for
 Zambia, because of the Italian-built, 1060-mile 8-inch
 petroleum pipeline from Dar es Salaam to Ndola on the
 copperbelt can carry the required POL.  Also, the coal
 needed to operate copper smelters in Zambia would probably
 continue to be imported from Rhodesia because the Wankie
 Colliery is the cheapest source of coal for Zambia.
 2.  Chinese Offer
 After the negative review by the ADB and the IBRD of
 March 19.67, Kaunda finally realized that Western support
 for the-railroad was not likely to be forthcoming.  More-
 over, Zambian efforts to develop other railroad transport
 routes which would avoid Rhodesia had proved equally
 unrewarding.  Thus the long-standing Chinese offer became
 more attractive.   Overcoming his inner doubts, Kaunda
 sounded out Communist China regarding its willingness to
 construct the Tan-Zam Railway.  Encouraged'by the Chinese
 response, Kaunda visited Peking in June 1967.  Shortly
 afterwards, negotiations began between Tanzania and Zambia
 on the one hand and China on the other, and on 5 September
 1967 an agreement was concluded.
 Tanzania and Zambia see the 5 September agreement as a
 firm commitment by Peking to follow through with the
 project.  According to the tripartite agreement, China was
 to finance building a railroad through an interest-free
 loan with no strings attached.  If current Chinese aid
 practices continue, loan repayment is likely to extend over
 Approved For Release 1999/09/025: CIA-RDP79-01194AO00300050001-8
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 a very long period and.might well include at least partial
 payment in Zambian and Tanzanian goods.  These terms would
 be highly favorable by Western and even Soviet standards.
 In addition, the agreement called for China to provide
 technical assistance for surveys and construction of the
 railroad.  The agreement was necessarily vague on the size
 of the over-all Chinese loan and the number of Chinese
 technicians to be involved because accurate'estimates were
 not available at the time the agreement was signed. In any
 case, this very simple contractual form is often used by
 China.  According to the agreement the project was to pro-
 ceed through three stages:  (1) preliminary investigations;
 (2) engineering and design surveys, for which the Chinese
 pledged a $14 million interest-free loan; and (3) construc-
 tion.  Discussions among the three governments will take
 place between each stage, and more detailed agreements will
 follow.
 Present Chinese planning is reported to call for a
 single-track railroad between Kapiri Mposhi, Zambia, and
 Kidatu, Tanzania, a distance of about 960 miles.  Other
 reports have indicated that the Chinese will extend the
 line from Kidatu tD Dar es Salaam to avoid transshipping at
 Kidatu.   All rolling stock, signalling and communications
 equipment will be supplied by the Chinese.  The railroad
 engineers will be provided by the Tanzanians and Zambians,
 but maintenance of line and equipment will be handled by
 the Chinese for at least 10 years after the completion of
 the railroad.  During this period the Chinese will train
 Tanzanian and Zambian maintenance teams.  The construction
 loan will be for 10 years with the terms and dates of repay-
 ment to be determined after the railroad is in operation on
 the basis of capability for repayment by Tanzania and
 Zambia.
 The estimated Chinese cost for the construction of the
 railroad is reported to be $60 million for the Tanzanian
 section and $20 million for the Zambian section if maximum
 use is made of Chinese materials and labor.  The Chinese
 estimate is between 20 and 25 percent of the best Western
 estimates.
 3.  Chinese Survey
 Starting in December 1967, a nine-man Chinese team of
 railroad and construction experts carried out preliminary
 investigations of the Zambian section of the Tan.Zam
 Railway, similar to the 1965 preliminary study of the
 Tanzanian section.                      ; A 600-man team of
 Approved For Release 1999/002 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 Chinese technicians began the detailed railroad survey in
 Tanzania in February 1968 and a 350-man team began the
 Zambian section of the survey in November 1968..  The
 Tanzanian' portion of the survey is already completed and
 the Zambian portion should be completed before the end of
 1969.  At present the number of Chinese in Tanzania is
 estimated at up to 1,200 and in Zambia between 500 and 700.
 As a result of unfortunate experiences in Southeast
 Asia as well as in Africa resulting from excessive local
 Chinese revolutionary zeal, the Chinese attempted initially
 to keep their presence unobtrusive and their visibility low.
 Indeed, at the outset in Tanzania and Zambia, they sought
 to present an image of hard-work and austerity with an
 almost total absence of adornment and frivolity.  In support
 of this image, the Chinese railroad surveyors keep to them
 selves, carefully refraining from fraternization with the
 local population except for group meetings sponsored by the
 Chinese embassies in Dar es Salaam and Lusaka.  The only
 regular and continuing contact with the locals is main-
 tained by Chinese public relations men or medical tech-
 nicians.  As a result of this low-key approach, the Chinese
 surveyors. have made a generally favorable impression on the
 Tanzanians and Zambians whom they meet in the bush during
 their surveying work.
 Shortly after their arrival in Zambia, the Chinese
 surveyors established three base camps as regional head-
 quarters for the railroad survey.
 The base camps are located at the Mkushi River
 Hotel in Mkushi, the Crested Crane Hotel in Mpika, and a
 large building in Kasama.  Security is very strict at all
 the camps, which are surrounded by barbed wire and guarded
 by Chinese personnel.   Local Zambians who are employed as
 guides and manual laborers live outside the camps.  Visitors
 are discouraged, and even official visits are only reluc-
 tantly permitted.  All visitors, including government
 officials:, are closely questioned before admittance,  All
 activities in the camps, including even simple domestic
 routines, are discontinued until the visitor departs.
 Living conditions in the base camps are very crowded
 with most: of the workers living under roofs with only the
 spillover in tents.  (All personnel in'the field camps live
 in floorless tents set up over sand.)  In the headquarters
 buildings, 8 men sleep in rooms 8 feet by 12 feet on tiers
 of bunks.   Each room has a wash basin, but the entire
 building uses the same toilet facilities, which are filthy.
 Meals are eaten in-the bedrooms because what used to be the
 dining rooms are used as sleeping quarters for additional

 Chinese.  The bedrooms are also used as offices during the
 day.  The food is almost all canned and imported from China.
 There is little variety.  Occasionally, vegetables are
 obtained from local markets, but so infrequently that the
 Chinese are planting their own gardens.
 Life in the camps is austere and monastic..  There is
 group study of Mao's thoughts in the morning before work
 and singing of revolutionary songs in the evening.  Each
 man carries with him into the bush his book of Mao's
 thoughts.  Each member of the survey teams does his own
 washing and a certain amount of manual labor, regardless of
 his position.
 The only women with the survey teams are attached to
 the medical staffs.  There have been unconfirmed, reports of
 the Chinese taking Zambian women into their camps at night
 and of engaging in homosexual practices with local men.
 r
 Although most Chinese in the camps are not permitted to
 move about on their own, conditions are different in Lusaka,
 and the Chinese there are rapidly becoming as evident as
 those in Dar es Salaam.  Groups of six or seven Chinese may
 be seen in most hotels, with the Ridgeway Hotel apparently
 the Chinese favorite.  The Chinese in Lusaka are always seen
 in groups and do not talk to or mix with the local popula-
 tion.  They are apparently free to come or go into the city
 as they please, using any form of transport -- road, rail
 or air..
 The activities of the Chinese medical technicians
 attached to the survey teams have been especially rewarding
 from the Chinese point of view.  Originally these techni-
 cians only accepted patients for treatment in clinics set
 up at the camps of the railroad surveyors, but when the
 Chinese saw how popular their medical work had become among
 the local population, the medical technicians began moving
 'out among villages in the bush to increase the number of.
 prospective patients treated.  Local government officials
 have been included among their clientele.
 The primary method of treatment of the Chinese medical
 technicians is acupuncture -- a method of treatment invol-
 ving the puncturing of a part of the body with needles two
 or three inches long.  This treatment is combined with.the
 passage of drugs  to the patient.  Although stories of
 miraculous cures have come -out of the bush, other reports
 indicate that the general inattention to basic sanitary
 .procedures by the Chinese "doctors" may well result. in
 acupuncture practices inducing infection as well as cures

 in the patients.
 Dissemination of Chinese propaganda accompanies all
 treatment.by the medical technicians and provides a channel
 to get propaganda into the remotest corners of Tanzania and
 Zambia.  Initially the Chinese were more agressive in their
 propaganda efforts in Tanzania than in Zambia.  Several
 sharp rebuffs from the government of Zambia to'the Chinese
 embassy in Lusaka and a written protest by Kaunda to Chou
 En-lai served as?a temporary check on Chinese distribution
 of propaganda in Zambia.  With the recent large influx  of
 Chinese into Zambia, however, Zambian government capability
 to monitor and control the activities of Chinese propagan-
 dists has declined..  This decline is apparent in the
 villages where unsuspecting schoolteachers are provided
 with propaganda materials by the Chinese and even in the
 cities where the Chinese employ seemingly innocent accounts
 of the activities of the surveyors to insert into local
 med.ia pro-:Chinese and anti-Western and anti-Soviet
 propaganda..
 The Chinese attacks on the USSR have inspired Soviet
 counterattacks. for example, the       newspaper, Times of
 Zambia, on 6 May printed a Radio Moscow broadcast which
 claimed that the policies of Mao had caused a drop in the
 Chinese standard of living.  Again on 7 May the Times
 reported a Moscow broadcast on the "armies of Ma     This
 same issue of the Times also included a reply from the
 Chinese embassy in Lusaka to the Soviet blast of the
 previous day.   Thus, Zambia is becoming a propaganda battle-
 ground for the Chinese and the Soviets.
 The gradual step-up of Chinese propaganda output in
 Zambia began in February 1969 with the arrival of a top
 NCNA propagandist whose objective was to gain wide play in
 Zambian media for news of the ostensibly beneficial
 activities:of the surveyors.  The new visitor was immedi-
 ately successful, and favorable local coverage of the
 surveyors immediately increased.  Coverage'by the Zambian
 press, radio and TV, and the Zambian Informati-on Service
 became frequent and friendly.  Subsequently the Chinese
 undertook several surveys, to assess the impact of their
 overt propaganda in Zambian media and their covert dissemi-
 nations in the bush.  They have been reported to be pleased
 with the results of these surveys obtained to date.
 In addition to Chinese propaganda activities, the
 governments of Tanzania and Zambia have experienced, as a
 result of the Chinese presence, problems in other fields
 including labor and security.

 The Chinese engineers and workers on the survey teams
 are setting labor norms that disturb the trade unions of
 Tanzania and Zambia.  Surveying in some of the most diffi-
 cult terrain in East Africa, the Chinese teams work ten
 hours every day, including Sunday, for a base pay less than
 that of local trade unionists and with no overtime or extra
 allowances.  The Chinese eat frugal five-minute lunches and
 flaunt their spartan work methods before the -locals.  They
 are virtually self-sufficient in all their requirements,
 having brought wi.th them from China almost everything that
 they believed they would need, ranging from dustbrooms and
 gasoline tanks through electricity-generators and engineer-
 ing equipment to trucks and Chinese-style landrovers.  They
 service all their equipment themselves.
 The Chinese take advantage of the inability of the
 governments of Tanzania and Zambia to keep a close watch
 and control over the activities of the railroad surveyors.
 It is very likely that these governments do not even know
 the actual number of Chinese surveyors ih their countries.
 Several techniques are employed by the Chinese to infiltrate
 more of their people than show up on airport manifests or
 transient rolls.  Under one technique, after the arrival of
 a plane full of Chinese, a single Chinese will sign the
 manifest for large numbers of his incoming colleagues who
 mill about the airport.  He will write a Chinese surname --
 for example, Li -- and beneath it write a dozen or so ditto
 marks.  Another technique was first observed in Mali.  To
 obfuscate the local custom authorities, an incoming group
 of Chinese surveyors is met at the airport by a large group
 of Chinese already in the country.  The two groups mingle
 in a spirit of exuberance and make a mass exodus past the
 bewildered customs officials.
 Other Chinese activities may be more serious in the
 long run.  These activities in      the movement of arms
 into Tanzania and Zambia for passage to African liberation
 movements and the unobserved use made of the freedom given
 the survey teams to survey and map an enormous area of
 Zambia, much of it previously uncharted.
 It seems certain that the
 Chinese will be able to prepare detailed military topo-
 graphical maps of Tanzania and Zambia as a byproduct of the
 survey.  Such maps could prove invaluable if the Chinese
 ever undertake large-scale military support of the liberation
 movements located in Tanzania and Zambia.
 The extra-curricular activities of the Chinese survey
 teams have greatly disturbed President Kaunda, who on
 numerous occasions has publicly expressed his fears and
 Approved For Release 1999/09/6 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 frustrations resulting from these unauthorized Chinese
 activities in Zambia.  Even President Nyerere of Tanzania,
 considered by many to be more lenient to the Chinese than
 Kaunda, noted in a press interview on 5 May in Mwanza that
 he was aware of the dangers of a policy of close relations
 with Commuryrst China. He made clear his understanding of
 the anxiety of the outside world since his policy "might
 let the Chinese into their sphere of influence," but China
 was willing to build the Tan-Zam Railway which Tanzania
 wanted and the West had refused to build it.  Nyerere added
 a warning to China.  "'We are a stubborn people,," he said,
 "The Chinese will learn that if they want to control us
 they will :get into trouble,*
 4.  Possible Chinese Gains
 The Chinese offer of assistance for the construction of
 the Tan-Zam Railway is unprecedented for Communist China
 and represents by far China's single largest foreign aid
 project to date.  It would be the third largest foreign aid
 project in all Africa, outweighed only by the billion-
 dollar Aswan High Dam, where the USSR provided about one-
 third of the cost in credits, and by the Volta Dam in Ghana
 which was mainly financed by the US.
 On they basis of the Stamp report estimates of cost
 (see page 3, above), if the Chinese do eventually construct
 the railroad, they would be undertaking a project which
 could equal more than one-third of their total economic aid
 commitment's since 1956 and almost match all of their actual
 aid expenditures to date.   Since the inception of.the
 Chinese aid program in 1956, China's total worldwide
 commitments amounted to somewhat more than $1 billion while
 actual expenditures were about $400 million.  Annual
 commitments reached a peak of $310 million in 1964 but
 averaged about $120 million in 1965 and 1966 and declined
 to under $100 million in 1967.  Drawings on aid since 1964
 have averaged about $75 million annually.
 China has had a series of political and diplomatic
 reverses in Africa since its highwater mark in 1964 when 18
 African governments recognized Communist China.  Since then,
 as a result of Chinese subversive activities, Burundi,
 Dahomey, the Central African Republic and Ghana have broken
 diplomatic' relations with China; Kenya and Morocco have ex-
 pelled Chinese diplomats; Ethiopia, which has never had
 diplomatic relations with China, threw out the local NCNA
 representative, and China withdrew its mission to_Tunisia.
 Presently more African states (21) recognize Taiwan than
 Communist China (14) and more African states have voted
 against Chinese Communist admission to the UN (20) than
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 11
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 have voted in favor of admission (15).  One important objec-
 tive of the Tan-Zam Railway, therefore, is to permit
 Communist China to recoup some of its recent losses in
 prestige and position in Africa and to reassert its interest
 in Africa's development.
 The Chinese are publicly committed to a policy of con-
 tinuing revolution in colonial and semi-colonial countries.
 In the process of constructing the Tan-Zam Railway, the
 Chinese will  improve their access to masses of the local
 peasantry who may be :"ripe for revolution" as Chou En-lai
 noted in 1964.  The Chinese also will increase their
 ability to work with members of-southern African liberation
 movements, far from prying eyes, in remote bush areas of
 Tanzania and Zambia.  In view of previous Chinese
 performances in Ghana, Congo CBrazzavi.lle) and Mali, the
 Chinese may very well set up on-the-scene guerrilla train-
 ing camps, even unknown to most members of the Tanzanian
 and Zambian governments.  Such camps would provide bases
 for subversion not only against southern African targets
 but also against Congo (Ki'nshas-a).  Once the Tan-Zam
 Railway was completed, it could provide an artery for sus-
 taining a large-scale Chinese-supported military effort
 directed at Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and Congo
 (Kinshasa).  With the availability of the railroad, such an
 effort could encompass heavier weapons, including artillery,
 not used to date by the guerrillas.,
 A permanent, secure Chinese position in Zambia would
 give the Chinese access'to mineral resources of which they
 are currently in short supply such as copper, gold and
 diamonds.  The potential access to Congo (Kinshasa) would
 place the Chinese within reach of the world's largest
 known source of cobalt as well as uranium.  In 1962, the
 Union Miniere du Katanga produced 68 percent of the Free
 Worlds cobalt.  Since the Sino-Soviet split in 1961, the
 Chinese'have been hard pressed to obtain for their reactors
 sufficient quantities of suitable uranium and the cobalt
 required to enrich it.
 China must rely on labor-intensive methods to build the
 railroad as it does not.have sufficient construction
 machinery.
 Consequently, large numbers of laborers will be required
 for the period of. construction, a period that should last
 at least five years.  Tanzania and Zambia cannot supply the
 required labor force, and on the basis of its previous ex-
 periences, China would not be willing to accept local
 laborers in large numbers even if they were available.
 Therefore, China can be expected to import the requisite
 labor force.  In the short run, the impact on the local
 economics of such a force could be significant and In the
 long run it could become an ethnic and subversive'prob.lem._

 Historically speaking, Chinese railroad workers employed in
 the US and in Peru and Indian railroad workers in East
 Africa remained behind. after completion of the projects on
 which they were employed.
 Present Chinese plans call for the provision of con-
 tinuing technical  assistance in running the railroad and
 providing: replacement equipment as necessary.  There have
 been reports that the Czechs and Japanese were willing to
 supply rolling stock for the railroad, with the Czechs
 indicating a willingness if necessary to participate with
 the Chinese in the funding,  This Czech willingness
 predates the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and probably
 has now given way to sentiments host'i'le to the Chinese,
 Even if the Czechs were still willing to participate in the
 railroad, the Chinese are unlikely- to accept them or the
 Japanese and are likely to induce the governments of
 Tanzania and Zambia to refuse recent rtali'an offers to
 provide*operati,ng personnel after the railroad is built,
 Zambian problems operating present railroad facilities
 indicate conditions probably will deteriorate further.
 Therefore, in the absence of other foreign assistance, the
 Zambians will have to rely increasingly on the Chinese for
 help in the operation, maintenance and repair of railroads
 in Zambia
 In spite of sincereprotestations of non-alignment by
 Nyerere and of friendship for the West by Kaunda, these
 African leaders will find themselves increasingly at the
 mercy of the Chinese once construction of the railroad is
 well underway.   The governments of Tanzania and Zambia, of
 necessity, will have to curry favor with their Chinese
 benefactors.   They will gradually have to provide special
 treatment.for the Chinese at the expense of other countries
 toward which the Chinese are hostile.  A partial list of
 anticipated Chinese gains, based lar ely on precedents
 established elsewhere, include:   (a.)) limitations on the
 freedom of movement of all foreigners other than Chinese
 Communists,; (b.) increasing toleration of Chinese efforts
 to spread propaganda; (c.) favored treatment for Chinese
 imports, including consumer items which are non-essential
 or of marginal quality; (d.) growth of Chinese influence in
 the military, police and other local elements which come in
 frequent contact with the Chinese (it appears that in the
 future only th.e Chinese will train the Tanzanian Peoples
 Defense Force); (e.) virtually total suppression of any
 criticism 'of China and the Chinese in local media and by
 public officials; (f..) partial Chinese. control over the
 local economy through long-term loan and barter deals which
 commit the participating country to import Chinese goods
 that are not necessarily compatible with national needs at

 CHINESE AII) AND TRADE IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES
 T I-IE decision to build three new Ci nese radio transmitters in Za-nbia
 following the visit to Peking by Sikota Wirta, Zambian Minister of
 Information, signifies further evidence of China's growing involvement
 in Africa and. the revolutionary movements in Southcra Africa and
 Rhodesia. China has already built two similar transmitters in Brazzaville
 and Tanzania which have been used to broadcast anti-Wcstern propaganda
 and revolutionary theory to neighbouring states.
 The radio stations are only part of the invisible foothold China is gaining
 in Africa. Visible Chinese influence is evident with the growing number
 of stores selling Chii;ese goods a --d books and the increasicg army c.

 340 surveyqrs already employed on the '1,042 milt:. Tanzaaia-Zmb;a
 railway.
 Work on the railway is progressing rapidly according to reports from
 Chinese and African sources. Since the initial survey started it-. D:.ccn~~cr,
 1958, the survey-team-is said to have completed the preliminary suvey
 of the 550 mile main route from Dtr-cs-Salaam to the heart of the copper-
 belt. The whole project is due to be completed by 1975.
 By providing an advance of the capital cost of between z:00-?130
 million, most of the ]a.bour and ~nrobably all the contract, including rolling
 stock. China has surprised bona African aid Western observers, a;any of
 whom declared the project both uneconomic and impractical without
 massive British and American support. The routo rolls through some of
 the most difficult terrain in the region, rising from the coast at Dar-es-Salaam
 to the high, hilly areas-of the Cenral African plateau at 7,000 feet with
 its bushland and savanah before reaching the Zambian copperbclt.
 Apart from gaining valuable enginecring expcric:rcc, ('Icarning while
 oing and doing while le: rnirg' according to Chairman Mao's teaching
 China is hoping to win friends andinfiucnce enemies. Much has been made
 n both the Africar, and Chinese news media of the conditions under which
 he Chinese are employed. The Chu;ese engineers accept what appears to brs
 onditions similar to the local Africans. They exist separately and frugally
 hough their standards; arc still considerably better than the average rural
 i?ican's. Nevertheless-this provides a useful contrast to Europeans work-
 ng in the copper-mines and expatriate officers in government institutions
 ho expect to maintain living stauda:als well beyond the means o: tho
 w affluent Africans.
 Moreover, it appears than in additioL to their spartan lift the Chinese;
 rc willing to devote much, of their Sparc time to welfare projects such as
 epairing bridges, helping with harvests; and according to one N.C.N.A.'

 1c?f mute.
 Feasibility studics by British firms who laid the permanent way across

 Chinese assistance is not only limited to the 1A          i way.
 The Friendship Tcxtild Mill, built with Chinese labour at a cost of ?3
 million in the form of an interest-free loan, is turning out 90 million square
 yards of cloth annually and is expected to make Tanzania self-sufficient
 in cloth by the end of 1970. The mill, the first of its kind in Africa being
 fully integrated and capable of printing patterns on cloth spun from locally
 produced cotton, was completed in 18 months from design to finish and
 is now operating with the minimum Chinese supervision and is providing
 employment for 3,000 workers.
 The Upcnja State Farm in Zanzibar, built on 1,300 acres of arable land
 with Chinese assistance, is now producing rice, fruit and vegetables and !
 poultry-meat on land previously thought unproductive. While in Somalia,
 a Chinese hydro-geological survey team has been drilling wells and map-
 ping Inc territory since March. 1969, and Chinese bicycles are on sale in f
 Mogadishu.
 This activity adds up to a new rise in Chinese influence in Africa which,
 following the 1965 Afro-Asian solidarity conference in Algiers,. fell to its
 lowest ebb and remained ineffective during much of the cultural revolution.
 The mainspring of China's campaign to gain support in Africa began late
 in 1966 with the formation of the Sino-Tanzanian shipping line and the. first of a new series of loans to African countries starting with U.S. $17
 million to Zambia.
 African opinion was generally apathetic and prior to 1967 in some states
 it was positively hostile. Coups in Ghana, Dahomey. The Central African
 Republic and. Burundi preceded the exit of Chinese personnel accused of
 sabotage and subversion. Ghana's new Head of State at the time, General
 Ankvah, emphasised China's efforts had been in setting up spy-schools,
 military. training camps and instruction in sabotage in jungle camps
 rather than agro-technical stations and rural industry.
 Chinese involvement need not, however, be construed as part of a plot.
 China is publicly committed to revolution in the region, but at the same
 .time is willing to offer aid to countries who turn their eyes away from
 U.S.-Soviet sources: The countries falling into this category are still few in
 number and so quite a small fragment of China's resources allocated
 for aid . against imperialism .can have a marked erect on recipient
 territories. In 1968 China budgeted ?750,000 for African liberation move,
 =cuts.
 This dual personality China displays in Africa as a provider of aid
 to non-aligned newly-emerged States on the one hand and as agent-
 provocateur in the wars of liberation on the other means that no African
 Head of State can ever be quite sure that the Chinese are on his side or if
 they .are secretly plotting against him. Thus, Col. Bokassa of the Central
 African Republic (C.A.R.), himself the recipient. of. a Chinese U.S. $4 }
 million loan, could say realistically in July, 1967: 'To have peace one must
 not admit the Chinese Into one's country because they teach subversion. I
 tell you that the C.A.R. had in its territory a Chinese school for subversion
 and even a military training camp'.
 Westerners who tend to see the growing Chinese influence in Africa as a
 curious mixture of the yellow peril and red menace seem to forget the
 extent of Western assistance; for every Chinese technician there are ten or
 twelve Westerners working on joint aid ventures. Perhaps the Africans are
 more pragmatic than Europeans. China's aid, in any case, tends to be
 piecemeal. Most aid is-in the form of long-term loans rather than direct';:
 grants and since 1954 China ,has provided little more than U.S. $950
 million. Zambia and Tanzania are the chief recipients of this aid. Since
 1961 Tanzania received ?121 million. A further ?I17 million was promised
 for rural - development. Ir contrast, in 1968 East African countries, ex-
 cluding Tanzania and Zambia. received from Britain alone approximately
 U.S. $56 million in bilateral grants and loans. ?

 China's trade with Africa is not great; in 1962 it registered approximately
 4 per cent of her total trade. In 1964 this was valued at U.S. 590 million.
 By; 1968 this value had dropped to an estimated U.S. $74 million. Before
 relations were severed with Ghana, trade agreements were signed for
 inoroasas in two=way trada up to U.S. $12 million. But this sever ma.eria.-
 lised, despite the exchange of Ghanalan industrial diamonds, grains and
 cotton for Chinese machinery, fertilisers and agricultural products. Total
 trade amounted to less than a quarter of the original estimates. Guinea's
 five-year trade agreement suffered a similar fate.
 In spite of China's cash -rant of U.S. $2.8 million in May, 1964, relations
 with Kenya have never been good. Two Chinese diplomats and an
 N.C.N.A. correspondent were expelled from Kenya for `interfering is
 Kenya's internal affairs'. In June, 1967, the Chinese Charge d'Affaires
 was expelled for attacking a speech by Tom Mboya In a Nairobi news-
 paper. Red Guards retaliated with an attack on the Kenyan Embassy in
 Peking. a few weeks later. In 1968, China accused Kenya of pursuing a
 two-China's policy as a result of articles on Taiwan in the Kenyan press.
 VWhen Tom Mboya was assassinated in July 5, this year, the Chinese
 embassy was. the only mission that failed to fly its flag at half mast.
 It is unlikely that China will improve her trading position among
 African states. Even Chinese low-priced goods are too costly for un-
 sophisticated rural markets and in any case they tend to compete with
 local products. In countries such as Kenya where relatively buoyant markets
 are available, relations have been soured by political failures. Because
 of this China favours emphasis o--i small but well chosen projects.
 The TANZAM line is a Jambi-: to recoup in the '70s the lost ground of
 the, '60s. In the meantima, Peking will continue to focus its aid on
 favoured recipients- such as the Rhodesian Zimbabwe African National
 Union (Z.A.N.U.) which advocates hit-and-run tactics across the Zambian
 border into Rhodesia, and the South African Pan African Congress
 (PA.C.), trying at the same, time to block all Soviet in,.rference in what
 China now considers her rightful sphere of infl'ience. This was evident at
 the International Conference of Solidarity with the Freedom Fighters of
 South Africa and the Portuguese Colonies, held in Khartoum in January.
 19.69. China denounced this meeting as a 'Soviet revisionist plot'. Peking's
 African allies were conspicuously absent from the meeting.
 China's future position in Africa hinges on her capability of main-
 taining friendly relations with African states with hostile political systems.
 Coups and rumours of coups are endemic in developing Africa. Zambia
 has had its share of rumours of a coup for some months now, and Peking
 could be faced with a similar situation to Ghana, but with an expensive
 railway line on her hands. The truth is that while ? China is trying to
 sweep Africa with revolution, like the Soviet Union she remains willing
 to pursue ties with bourgeois and military r6gimes In the economic
 field China continues to maintain trade worth ?S' million a. year with
 South Africa.
 The time has come for, i eking to make up for lost ground. The
 Chinese now have relations with nine African states south of the Sahara.
 compare.1 with 12 in 1965. In this respect the railway and other projects
 are gambles that have to pay off.

 What puzzles Tanzania's friends, and scares its enemies, however, is China's role
 as arms supplier and military adviser. Up to January of this year ,Canadians advised
 the army, and trained Tanzania'i pilots. This arrangement was not totally satisfactory
 because of Canada's membership of Nato- which Tanzania accuses of arming Portugal
 with weapons to. suppress African guerrillas. Sweden and Czechoslovakia were..mcn-
 tioned as alternatives, and it was pointed out that Italy is training the Zambian ail`
 force. It soon-became clear, however,'that it was China. that would fill the gap. Naval
 and air force personnel 'went to China for training, and Chinese engineers began work
 on a naval base in Dares Salaam harbour. They had already biuilt'.several army
 barracks.
 All these mcasures'nre being taken in preparation for`what Tanzanians believe will
 be an eventual armed confrontation' with the south. Their greatest fear in fact is of a
 Rhodesian, South African or Portuguese pre-emptive strike.""(It has been. reported
 that the Chinese have warned them not to provoke one at this stage; the present low
 level of 'freedom fighting' in Africa -except in the Portuguese .territories.-- suggests
 this advice may have been offered, and heeded. President Kaunda even denies
 harbouring any guerrilla bases in Zambia, although this *is patently untrue. But it
 would be naive in the extreme to imagine that in the' long run the Chinese will be a
 restraining influence.)
 The African guerrillas welcome Chinese help, but they are at pains to point out
 that they are first and foremost nationalists. Just as President Nyerere tries to balance
 the Chinese by western advisers, so the guerrilla groups make much of the assistance
 they receive from private groups in America and Britain, and government contribu-
 tions from Sweden.                   .
 Supporting the guerrilla groups gives the Chinese the.chance to engage in political
 indoctrination in the training camps, particularly those remote from Dar es Salaam
 and Lusaka. They undoubtedly have made some useful converts. But Chinese penetra-
 tion of Zambia may not be as far advanced as some western observers fear.     . ,.,

 approximately ?169 million; it is the biggest aid project the Chinese have ever under-
 taken. There is little doubt that China hopes the railway will be both a Trojan horse
 for Chinese trade and a conveyor belt for the spread of Mao's thinking.
 To some extent the project marks a' shift in, Peking's ' 15'olicy; towards Africa. -The
 excesses of the cultural revolution prompted several'African states to sever .diplomatic
 relations with 1?eking,' on the ground 'that Chinese agents were. engaging in ?subvcrsive
 activities on African territory. Peking decided at this stage to combat western and
 Russian influence by concentrating on a few selected countries.' F',
 Tanzania is -one of the chief of these. 'Even before the railway deal was fixed, -Peking-
 had become involved in about 20 aid projects in that country. But what the ,Chinese,
 wanted was' a major prestige' project - something that would :parallel the Russians'
 building of the;Aswan Dam. The Tanzania-Zambia rail line was the answer.
 So far the Chinese ~ there are 6,000-of.them -have behaved impeccably in Tanzania
 and Zambia; they seem content to let their political ambitions wait, for 20 years. if
 necessary. They were fully aware of the initial handicaps they had to overcome.
 Indeed, in 1965 the Zambians were so suspicious"ofChina (whose.embassy had been
 expelled from nearby Burundi for subversion] that, they refused to let the preliminary:
 rail survey team enter Zambian'. territory; the first report was' confined to 'the Tan-'
 zanian section. President Kaunda, -dragged his feet for nearly two years, 'I presumably
 hoping for a late counter-offer from the west, which never came, before entering into
 an agreement.
 Today China finds itself the major aid giver to both Tanzania and Zambia, and
 sole military adviser and chief arms, supplier to 'I'anzania.A'Lcommodity, agreement
 tied to the railway loan indicates that China will replace Britain as the two African
 countries' most important trading partner. Meanwhile, the two countries' support for
 the liberation struggle enables the 'Chinese to maintain close contact with southern
 African guerrillas.
 But China's presence is balanced by that of other aid-giving' nations, notably Canada
 and the Scandinavian countries (whom Dr Nyerere often praises). The Tanzania-
 Zambia highway is being built by a western consortium including USAID (United
 States Aid for International Development). And, to underline the Tanzanians' prag-
 matic approach, an American business efficiency team is , currently advising the
 Tanzanian state trading corporation and the development planning ministry. There
 is not a single Chinese adviser in any ministry in either Dar es Salaam or Lusaka. Very
 few senior officials of any sort go to' China for training, partly because it has been
 found difficult to integrate them into. the administration when' they return..
 Nor are the Chinese particularly popular with local people. They appear humourless
 and aloof, and they do not mix. Those Tanzanians who have been to' china for training
 complain of condescending behaviour on the part of their hosts.';

 Lank, opposed construction
 of  the  railway  on  two
 rounds:
 First, Zambia already had
 an outlet to the sea through
 the Rhodesian and Portu-
 guese African rail sgait'tens
 and, second, an Amertcan-
 built tarred road from Tan-
 zania to the Zambian copper,
 belt, scheduled for comple-
 tion next year, would enable
 Zambia to export  all  the
 copper it wanted through
 lack Africa.
 But these strict economic
 8rguments Ignored both pol-
 itics and history.
 As a Tanzanian govern-
 ment press release put it
 last  week,  the  Western
 world had "forgotten that
 elsewhere    many similar
 schemes were   undertaken
 regardless-of immediate eco?.
 nomic benefits.
 As an example, the -gov-
 ernment cited the first rail-
 road  in cast Africa, the
 Uganda Railway built by the
 British  from  the  Indian
 Ocean to Lake Victoria at
 the turn of the century.
 That    railroad.   which
 moved through undeveloped
 tribal lands, was derided in
 the  British Parliament at
 the  time  as  "a gigantic
 folly" and "a railway with
 two ends and no middle."
 The British government,
 however justified it on polit-
 ical grounds. Ministers said
 the railway would end the
 caravan  slave  trade  and
 would   enable the' British,
 rather than the Germans, to
 control the source of the.
 Vile River.
 In the end, the railway,
 had an even more Important
 political result. It opened
 Kenya to white settlement"
 and made that country 'the
 only "white man's colony
 in cast Africa.
 In the opening ceremonies
 for, the Chinese ra'.lway in
 liar es Salaam last week,'
 President Kenneth ICaunda
 ofZnmbia dealt With one of
 the major political problems
 of the railway-ruspielon of
 the Chinese.
 Kaunda said Western op-
 poncnts of the railway had
 "a rather psychopathic fear
 of the intentions and objec-
 tives of the Chinese." He
 dismissed  this, as  -arro-
 gance."
 '-The Chinese people are
 our friends," he said, "and
 they will remain so as loner
 as it is to the benefit of our
 respective peoples."
 Kaunda  also  told  the .
 Chinese delegation on the
 platform that the Africans
 "pledge to fight malicious
 campaigns   being waged
 against the railway by the
 detractors."
 An example of the kind of
 campaign ICaunda had In
 mind came up recently In a
 Nairobi  newspaper.  The
 newspaper published a pic-
 ture that showed a recruiter
 in :China promising volun-
 teers free land in Tanzania
 if they would ' work on the
 railroad there. The 'Chinese
 government has denounced
 the  photograph  as phony
 and diplomats here agree.
 The   fabricated   photo.
 graph, -however, did awaken'
 fears  some  Africans and
 many outsiders have about
 the  numbers  of  Chinese
 coming to Africa. Already
 4,700 Chinese are at work on
 the railroad alongside 7,000
 Africans. The  number of Chinese should reach 6,000
 by the end of the year.
 The photo also recalled
 another historical. problem
 of railway building In east
 Africa.
 To build their railway, the
 British imported 32,000 In-
 dian coolies at the turn of
 the century. Of these. 2,500
 died in Kenya and 6..5001)(1-
 i       too sick to work, The
 British  returned  the slck-
 coolies and 16.000 healthy;
 ones to India. But .7,000.?re
 mained to settle in cast Af-
 rica and become the nucleus
 of the resented Asian minor-
 ity that controls much of the
 commerce of cast Africa
 today.
 tt'hen the Chinese project
 was first announced.; many
 Western skeptics did not he- s
 lieve they could do the job.
 It took the British twice,
 as long as they intended and
 it cost them twice what they
 expected to build their rail-
 way. But the British were
 slowed by lions that ate 28
 Indian  workers  and  two
 British supervisors. warring
 tribesmen who stole rails to
 make spears and telegraph
 wire to make necklaces, and
 terrible climate, terrain and
 disease. .
 The Chinese also will face
 difficult problems in push-
 ing their railway through
 mountainous  terrain  a n d
 trop cal climate. But. they
 actually are ahead of sched-
 ule.
 Although  the o f f i c i a l
 opening was celebrated last,
 week,  the Chinese began
 work several months ago.
 More   than 100  miles  of
 bridges, culverts and em-
 banknt'ents have been bulk.
 all ready for the laying of
 rail.
 The belting now is the
 Chinese will finish the job
 by their target data of Ia7A._J

 CPYRGHTCHINESE GAIN INFLUENCE THROUGH RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION
 Three or four years ago many western diplomats' in Dar es Salaam,
 especially Americans, wore expressions of mild superiority while
 listening to Chinese plans to build a railroad in Tanzania.
 was to be more than 1800 kilometers long and extend from the Tanzanian
 capital through hinterland that was either swampy or mountainous or
 inaccessible, through difficult terrain, to join the Zambian railroad
 system at Kapiri' Mposhi.  There was, some doubt that the Chinese had
 sufficient technical qualifications and equipment to carry out such a
 project.  After all, following a study showing it to be economically
 unfeasible, the World Bank had refused financial backing.  Furthermore,
 it was argued that it would take Mao Tse-tung's workers and technicians
 at least a decade before they could run their first train on this road.
 How much could happen during that time?  By then the Dar es Salaam-
 Lusaka highway, over which copper could be brought to the coast,
 would have been paved with Swedish, Italian and American aid.  In that
 time Zambia's President Kenneth Kaunda and his Tanzanian colleague
 Julius Nyerere could become convinced that they had backed the wrong
 horse in choosing the train project.

 Chinese Technical Skill
 Then as now very little was known about communist China.  As
 a rule we tend to think of tremendous hordes of coolies doing compulsory
 labor with primitive tools on endless masses of land; we'think of them
 being technically where we in the west were about 50 years ago. Of
 course we have learned a little more about them in the meantime; for
 instance we know that their technicians can build hydrogen bombs and
 propel long-range missiles over tremendous distances.  But anyone
 who had the opportunity to see the first geologists and railroad experts
 mark out and survey the line in Tanzania quickly had to revise his ideas
 about archaic technical knowledge in Mao Tse-tung's subjects.
 In the meantime, according to official figures, some 4700 Chinese
 have crossed the ocean.  With them they have brought modern technical
 equipment like earth moving machines, tractors, steel girders for
 bridges as well as drilling machines for tunnel building.  The Chinese
 are already considerably farther along in their program than western
 experts had anticipated. They have already finished some 110 bridges
 and thrown up dams over long stretches.  By next month they are sup-
 posed to start on the manufacture of concrete blocks near Dar es Salaam.
 and figure on producing 2000 per day.  Current calculations picture the
 stretch in operation in about four years.

 On 26 October Kaunda laid the cornerstone for this tremendous
 undertaking at the gates of Dar es Salaam in the presence of the Chinese
 chairman of the Economics~elations with Foreign Countries Commission,
 Fang I.  Kaunda, in his speech, briefly outlined the early history of the
 project: a World Bank study had shown that the road was economically
 unfeasible and not worth the expense;' a later study by the Canadian-
 American Maxwell Stamp Company had, it is true, come to the opposite
 conclusion; but all attempts at persuasion had been in vain; the project
 had been coolly received everywhere and met with refusal.  The west
 had made the mistake of looking at the project only from the economic
 point of view.  It had not considered Zambia's special economic situation
 as a landlocked country, surrounded by hostile neighbors.  Possibly
 this negative attitude could also be explained by "political and ideolo-
 gical" motives:  they did not want to offend South Africa, Rhodesia and
 Portugal.  Kaunda pointed especially to Great Britain whose "vested
 interests" in "white" southern Africa would have been disturbed by the
 railroad project.  But Zambia would slowly have to free itself from
 dependence on southern Africa and political rather than economic con-
 siderations were more important here.  Furthermore, both Zambia and
 Tanzania were at liberty to choose their own helpers -- and their own
 friends and enemies.  The contract with Peking to build the railroad
 was based on the assurance of "mutual respect and non-intervention."
 Thus there were due grounds to be thankful to the Chinese.  There
 could no longer be any doubt that the project would be realized.

 ready made several western observers reevaluate their thinking. They
 remember the Aswan Dam in Egypt in which Secretary of State John
 Foster Dulles would show no interest.  The contract with the Soviets
 to build the dam opened for them the way to economic penetration
 of Egypt.  Finally it led to military and political influence that did not
 stop in Cairo.  It has extended to most of the countries in the Arab
 sphere, and to such a degree that Moscow has'not only secured im-
 portant strategic bases but is also in a position to have a decisive say
 in the dispute with Israel.
 Chinese Presence is Firmly Established
 Under Chinese administration, events could develop in a similar
 fashion in Tanzania and Zambia.  Peking has not limited itself to financing
 and constructing a railroad in Tanzania; it has also taken over other pro-
 jects and is now training the army, air force and navy.  At Tanzania's
 request, Peking has agreed to supply modern arms such as jet fighters
 against possible Portuguese threats. At the end of last year a Canadian
 military commission denied this request on the grounds that such in-
 struments were too expensive, training would take too long and anyhow
 the military situation did not warrant it.  The Chinese certainly also
 knew these facts.  But just as for the Soviets in Egypt, political aspects
 are more important to them.    Therefore they will shortly deliver jet
 fighters to Tanzania because they know that this will make it necessary
 to keep instructors, advisers and technical' assistants there for some

 Thus we will have to reckon with a  hz.n se p
 for decades.  And this will surely have its effect on the neghboring coun-
 tries.  This not only stiffens the Africans' backs in their fight against
 Portuguese domination in Mozambique and Angola, but also presents
 the Red Chinese with a propaganda base in East Africa to a degree that
 till then they had been unable to secure anywhere on the black continent.
 The assurances of "mutual respect and non-intervention" may be enough
 for Presidents Nyerere and Kaunda.  Yet they may be giving in to wish-
 ful thinking if they believe that Peking is acting purely out of motives of
 brotherly love for the "poor and exploited black brothers."  When such
 concerns are voiced in Dar es Salaam, however, the answer the Tan-
 zanians give, not without some reason, is that the West had the oppor-
 tunity to keep the Chinese out butt now it has lost this chance..
 Subversive Emanations
 Reliable sources in Congo-Kinshasa report that since the beginning
 of this year Chinese arms are again being smuggled across. Lake Tan-
 ganyika to the western shore of the area around Fizi.  During the Congolese'
 rebellion, that is from 1964 to 1966, the Chinese were the chief arms
 suppliers for the rebels and used secret roads from Bujumbura in Burundi
 and from Kigoma on the east shore of Lake Tanganyika. The peninsula
 at Fizi on Lake Tanganyika was the last rebel nest of resistance.  In
 1966 it was wiped out after a hard fight by white mercenaries under the
 South African Mike Hoare.. At that time an entire arsenal of Chinese
 arms was found: heavy machine guns, heavy mortars, hand grenades,
 and automatic rifles.

 But in all their undertakings the Chinese plan for the future.  And the
 current situation in the Congo could change overnight, as it does so
 frequently in Africa.  The "liberation movements" in southern Tanzania
 operating against.the Portuguese in Mozambique have been.supplied
 with Chinese arms for years.  Apparently the Tanzanian government
 itself has long since lost count of the amount of military equipment from
 Peking in i'ts country. ; .
 Of especial importance, naturally, are Peking's economic in-
 terests.  The most important to be considered is Zambia's wealth of
 copper. But of equal importance may be the iron ore and coal deposits
 in the southern parts of Tanzania which to date have been inaccessible anu
 also the great number of tropical agricultural products.  The tie-in
 with the Zambian railroad not only provides an efficient connection be-
 tween the Indian Ocean and the Zambian copper belt but in addition,
 with the great treasure chest of Congolese Katanga.  In this area Peking
 probably hardly believes in the maintenance of the status quo in Africa,
 but is probably patiently girding itself for the inevitable disintegration
 of white domination in the countries south of the Zambesi.
 Technical Aspects
 At the festive cornerstone-laying in Dar es Salaam the Tanzanian
 Information Ministry for the first time published several details and figures
 on the railroad project.  The length of the stretch from Dar es Salaam to
 Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia where it meets the Zambian railroad net will

 Zambia.  This means that the rolling stock cannot be used on the East
 African road, which has a one-meter gauge.  Official information  re-
 leases estimate that the new road will be able to handle 1. 75 million
 tons annually in both directions.  Whereas the East African roadbed can
 take only 30 kilograms per meter, the new Tanzania-Zambia railroad
 (Tazara for short) can carry 45 kilograms per meter.  They figure on
 top speeds up to 100 kilometers per hour as -against a maximum of 60
 kilometers per hour on the East African line.
 Apart from the fact, that Zambia, after completion of Tazara, can dis-
 pense with the Portuguese railroad to Beira, the road will also provide
 access to Tanzania's hinterland in which rich iron and coal deposits
 have been prospected.  In addition they hope to win new, agricultural
 land for cultivation in the Rufiji valley.  To date, because technical
 reasons make it inaccessible, it has been practically a wasteland.
 According to official reports, a total of 12, 000 workers and technicians,
 including 4700 Chinese, are at work on the road.  It is expected that
 this figure will rise to 20, 000 workers and technicians.
 Credit and Export Pressure
 Peking has.  made available to Tanzania and Zambia an interest-
 free credit of 2866 million Tanzanian shillings (about 1.5 billion Swiss
 francs).  Repayment is to start in 1983 and extend over a period of 30
 years.  Local costs are calculated at 52 percent of the credit and are
 to be defrayed by the Tanzanian and Zambian governments through
 imports of Chinese goods on_the basis of a"commodity credit agreement.!'

 According to the information releases, the current. importation
 of Chinese consumer goods (toys, china, textiles, etc) is not to be
 increased, but rather so-called capital goods like construction materials
 are to be imported.' Total value may run as high as 200 million Tan-
 zanian shillings annually (about 110 million francs).  Peking will also
 supply the railroad's rolling stock.  Costs may be some 20 percent of
 the total expenditures.  The Chinese will not finance the development of
 the port of Dar es Salaam.  At present there are only three piers for
 deep sea ships.  Three additional ones are currently under construction;
 two further ones are planned.  As soon as the railroad has been put
 into operation it is thought that an additional 8 to 10 more piers with
 special loading facilities will be needed, especially for large bulk goods
 freighters, specially equipped to transport ores.

 CPYRGHT            PEKING'S AFRICAN BRIDaaM
 In the streets of Dar es Salaam, under the niango.trees from which
 ripe fruit is falling now, vendors are peddling the wisdom of Chairman
 Mao.  Between the city and the airport a signboard lettered in Chinese
 points the way through the cocoanut palms to the Yombo Railroad Center.
 In the beautiful, natural harbor of the city, shortly before sundown
 the vessel "Jianhua" from Canton arrives with a cargo of hundreds of
 Peking development helpers and ties up not far from the luxury caravan-
 sary of the Kilimanjaro Hotel.  On the occasion of,'a brief visit to Tanzania
 apart from the above-mentioned casual observations and encounters the
 Chinese presence is not obtrusive.  The principal Peking project --
 construction of a railroad connection (more than 1800 kilometers in
 length) between the Zambian copper belt and the harbor of Dar es Salaam,
 the Tanzania Zambia Railroad (TAZAR) -- is hardly visible.  The camps of the
 Chinese construction force are not only behind barbed wire but also in part
 concealed by "Spanish walls " which prevent the passer-by from catching
 a glimpse of the materials stores and construction machinery as well as
 of the notoriously camera-shy subjects of Mao.  The actual construction
 sites are equally inaccessible.  Requests to visit the sites, placed
 before Tanzanian authorities, are frequently rejected with a reference to
 the sensitivity and the secretiveness of "our Chinese friends."  But
 the visitor does not need too much time to find out that so much discretion
 also suits the locals.  There is little inclination to broadcast
 Peking's invdivement.  Here and there it is understood that he who makes
 himself green can easily be gobbled up by the goats -- even if this
 idiom were to be phrased in a more African manner.
 The advantages which the railroad brings to the three partners are
 obvious.  Zambia will be rid of its political mortgage of having to ship
 its copper on the railroad system of "White Africa" -- via Rhodesia and
 Mozambique--to the Indian Ocean.  Tanzania, on the other hand, is hoping
 that apart from strengthening transit trade it will be able to provide
 stimuli for uncovering coal and iron ore deposits as well as expanding the
 agriculture potential of the currently still inaccessible hinterland.  The
 value of the Peking bridgehead -- which is possibly being expanded mainly
 for purposes of subversion in White Africa south ofthe Zambezi -- will
 essentially be dependent upon whether it can earn the confidence of the
 host countries and objectors which are members of the African community.
 The distrust of, say, Kenya has been awakened.  Not only vis-a-vis
 the good words of Chairman Mao in the little red booklet, which was confis-
 cated in Nairobi, but also with respect to the detrimental effects which the
 construction of the railroad could have on native industry which is in the
 embryonic stage through the influx of Chinese goods (whose value serves
 to cover local construction costs).  Even historical memories play a
 role in this feeling of malaise.  Construction of the East African
 Railroad had, at one time, led to a strong multiplication of Asiatic
 peoples; the Hindu workers settled in the land.

 It remains to be seen whether TAZAR will become for Peking what the
 Aswan High Dam is for Moscow.-- a foot in the door.  The preliminary
 history of the project is a reminder of-that pertaining to the dam:  the
 experts from the World Bank and from Western countries (however also from
 the Soviet Union) showed Tanzania and Zambia a cold shoulder with respect
 to TAZAR.  If the lesson of Aswan was obviously not heeded in this regard
 it can at least bear fruit in other matters subsequently:  refusal, in
 predicting the technical competence of the unwanted development helpers,
 to confuse wishes with reality.  The difficulties of the construction
 project in the Kipengere Mountains are obviously horrendous.  But for
 the time being nothing is contradicting the expectations that Peking
 will be able to accomplish the goal of. constructing an operational rail-
 road within five years.
 The World Bank had at one time rejected a loan with the justification
 that the railroad project was uneconomical.  Now it [the Bank] appears on a

 Dar es Salaam, 17 July (REUTER)--The Tanzanian Government said today REUTERS

 "The attention of the Tanzanian Government has been drawn'to a report which was

 told the Zambian Parliament on July 15, 1971, that the Tanzam railway now cost 17

 Mwanakatwe is known to have told the Zambian Parliament.  This case of misreporting is
 is unfortunate because the estimated cost of the railway, which the People's Republic
 of China so generously agreed to assist in financing, still remains the same as agreed
 between China, Zambia and Tanzania.
 "The Tanzania Government has information that what in fact the Hon. Mwanakatwe was asking
 parliament was merely to request for budgetary provision to fulfill Zambia's obligations
 as agreed on between the three parties," the Tanzanian Government statement said.

 NYERERE DENIES RUMORS ABOUT PRO TECHNICIANS
 Dar es Salaam, June 24            --"Tanzania is ours and we shall defend it for
 the benefit of Africa," declared Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere when he was addressing
 armymen of the Tanzania military academy at Mgulani, south of the capital, on June 22,
 according to press reports here.
 He said that former colonial powers would like to see Tanzania and other countries in
 Africa play their former part--the victim of exploitation.   Those who colonized Africa
 would still like to maintain their sphete of influence should they have the opportunity
 to do so.  Tanzania's?resolution to gain independence was therefore not in their Interest
 and they would go all lengths to ensure that they can continue with their exploitation.
 Referring to the anti-China rumour concocted and spread recently by the $ritish paper
 "DAILY TELEGRAPH" about Chinese railway technicians in Tanzania President Nyerere said
 that this is just one of the ways in which colonialists wanted to pick up-a quarrel with
 Tanzania in an attempt to exploit it.
 He said that if the imperialists and exploiters win in one country, they look for another
 where they can strike a blow.  "If they come, they will come seriously, and"we must be'
 prepared for them by being serious."

 THE RUSSIAN CHURCH IN POLITICAL ACTION
 If Lenin had felt sure of himself in 1918 he would no doubt
 have outlawed all forms of worship in the Soviet Union.  Instead,
 he opened a period of religious persecution that still flourishes.
 Today, churchmen who dare to be outspoken about their constitutional
 rights to practice religion are imprisoned while those who are
 politically docile and subservient to the dictates of the Soviet
 regime are sent abroad for "dialogues" with Christians, Muslims,
 Buddhists, etc.  It is this subservient group that the Soviet regime
 uses to build up its facade of religious tolerance at home,  This
 "tolerance" embraces some 14 officially recognized church denominations
 throughout the USSR, the largest of which are the Russian Orthodox
 and Islamic Churches.  In exchange for official toleration, the
 Soviet regime extracts obeisance from church leaders, support for
 its foreign and "peace" policies, and uses Communist dialogues with
 foreign religious groups to promote Communist popular front tactics.
 Ecumenical Dialogues
 In the decade preceding the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of
 Czechoslovakia, the USSR was highly successful in utilizing its own
 subservient church representatives, particularly those from the Russian
 Orthodox Church, to maneuver supposedly apolitical ecumenical groupings
 into espousing Soviet foreign policy pronouncements.  This was
 accomplished by working through the Christian Peace Conference,
 founded in 1958, and by the entrance in 1961 of the Russian Orthodox
 Church into membership in the World Council of Churches.  The failure
 of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Christian Peace Conference to
 take any significant action or stand following the invasion of
 Czechoslovakia (with the exception of individuals such as Russian
 Orthodox dissenter Aleksandr Levitin-Krasnov, later imprisoned)
 convinced many world Christian leaders that what they had viewed as
 positive experiment with a unique East-West dialogue had been fast
 turning into an Eastern monologue.  Mounting evidence of continued
 religious persecution (as recounted in samizdat publications reaching
 the West) that goes on behind the facade of official "tolerance" has
 further increased the wariness of some Communist and most non-Communist
 religious leaders about Soviet intentions.
 Christian Peace Conference
 Since its founding in 1958 by a group of East European theologians
 in Prague, the Christian Peace Conference (CPC) has functioned as the
 primary channel through which Communist churchmen reach and try to

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 influence world Christian bodies and public opinion in general,
 During the first ten years of its existence, the CPC also
 characterized a new subtlety in Soviet manipulation of Communist
 fronts and permitted Soviet "peace" propaganda to become an
 effective instrument of Soviet foreign policy,  Before the founding
 of the CPC, Soviet peace organizations were notorious for their
 inflexibility in prohibiting either pronouncements or proceedings
 to deviate in the slightest from Soviet policy. Within the CPC,
 however, individual Soviets stayed in the background and permitted
 an impressive degree of freedom in theological discussions so
 long as they could feel sure that the desired resolution on a
 given topic (Vietnam, Zionism, West German revanchism, etc.)
 would be forthcoming.  This small degree of permissiveness in
 organizations such as the CPC greatly enhanced the potential of
 such groups to attract non-Communist support.
 The Christian Peace Conference, which prefers to call itself
 a "movement" rather than an organization, grew rapidly.  Only 47
 participants (of whom only four came from the West) attended the
 founding meeting in 1958.  During the next ten years, the CPC
 sponsored three large international meetings called All-Christian
 Peace Assemblies.  The third Assembly, held in Prague 31 March -
 S April 1968, was attended by over 500 delegates from 55 countries,
 representing churches of 20 European, 18 African, and 12 American
 countries,  The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was
 represented by a Roman Catholic theologian.  Some 63 observers were
 sent from organizations such as the World Council of Churches, the
 Conference of European Churches, and the British Council of Churches.
 Among non-Christian attendees were representatives from the Buddhist
 religious societies of Ceylon and the USSR.  Conference documents
 listed the names of 82 newspapers, magazines, and radio-TV reporters
 accredited to the Assembly,  The "Czechoslovak Spring" was at its
 height during the third Assembly, and for the first time after twenty
 years of imposed silence, Czechoslovak Christians were free to
 disclose how their churches had been manipulated and infiltrated
 by the Communist Party.
 Four months after the close of the third Peace Assembly,
 Czechoslovakia was invaded, signaling the beginning of the metamorphosis
 of the CPC from a quasi-independent grouping to one completely under
 Soviet control,  The president of the CPC, Dr. Josef Hromadka and its
 general secretary, Jaroslav Ondra, both of whom spoke out against the
 invasion, were purged from the CPC in the course of its "normalization."
 Hromadka had been a firm believer in the Soviet socialist revolution,
 a member of the Soviet-run World Council of Peace, and in 1958 he
 received a Lenin Peace Prize for "his services to the cause of Communism
 at home and abroad, and especially in the ecumenical movement."  The
 day after the invasion, Hromadka wrote the Soviet ambassador to
 Czechoslovakia that "the Soviet government could not have made a more
 tragic mistake.-O'ly a:-  rrmediate withdrawal of the occupying armies
 can partly mitigate our ceru"or tragedy."  The reply came from the

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church who, in an angry
 letter, called Hromadka's views "inadmissible expressions."
 In a subsequent memorandum written for internal CPC use, Hromadka
 wrote that the cause of peace could not be served "with views and
 tasks given to us from outside" and without the "courage to listen
 to each other and to make decisions freely in real dialogue."  This
 memorandum marked an irrevocable turn in the life of the CPC and
 eventually forced the resignations of its general secretary and
 president.. The 15 November 1969 issue of Frankfurter All em~eine
 Zeitung noted that the CPC as "breaking up," and sai    ait~l the
 vo iet-led invasion some members of the organization had taken
 "Soviet speeches about peace as genuine and had placed themselves
 at Soviet disposal as a church program for such propaganda. The
 invasion shocked many and the work of the CPS has been crippled
 ever since."
 Following Hromadka's departure, Metropolitan Nikodim of the
 Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) succeeded in gaining almost complete
 control of the organization and the situation within the CPC rapidly
 deteriorated.  During an early 1970 Working group meeting, for
 example,'Nikodim's high-handed tactics in the handling of procedural
 matters and his complete disregard for any opposition within the CPC,
 caused a walkout by seven of the Western representatives, including
 those from France and West Germany.  By mid-1971, associated groups
 in most of Western Europe, Japan,, and the U.S. had all but withdrawn
 from active participation in the CPC as it is run under Nikodim
 The Fourth All-Christian Peace Assembly is scheduled to meet in
 Prague this month, from 30 September to 3 October 1971.  The prognosis
 is for a very slim attendance.
 Nikodim, Metropolitan of Leningrad and Novgorod, at 31 and with
 little theological training, became the youngest Bishop in the ROC
 and in 1963, at age 34, was elevated to Metropolitan, a rank just
 below that of Patriarch.  As head of the church's Department of
 External Relations in Moscow, Nikodim directs all ROC foreign relations
 and is the ROC's representative in the World Council of Churches,,
 How Nikodim functions as an articulate foreign affairs spokesman
 for the Russian church, and thereby for the Soviet regime, is described
 in the attached newspaper clip reprints.
 After its founding in 1948, the Soviets at first viewed the
 Geneva-based World Council of Churches (WCC) as "a tool of Western
 imperialism."  But by the mid-1950's and as the WCC grew in stature
 and size, the Soviet regime began. to see a possibility for using the
 organization as a co-activist in its own "peace" campaign.  Feelers
 were put out and by the time of the WCC Third General Assembly in
 New Delhi in late 1961, the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) had been
 admitted to membership.  The entry of Russia's largest church into
 the WCC was hailed by many as a triumph of Christian unity over
 political disagreement; others were not so sure.

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 Concerning Metropolitan Nikodim as representative of the
 Russian church in the WCC, Michael Bourdeaux noted, in his
 book Opium of the People (1965), that upon Nikodim's entry into
 the WC- C,he began campaigning for the WCC to play its part in
 the peace forum, particularly by supporting resolutions adopted
 by the Prague-based Christian Peace Conference (CPC).  If
 challenged, Nikodim would answer, "By supporting such causes
 we gain standing in the eyes of our government."  Bourdeaux
 commented that it was "surprising that he never said that it
 must be a basic Christian concern to further the cause of peace
 in the world."  When asked what contribution the Russian Church
 could bring to the WCC, "instead of giving me an answer about
 the richness of the Russian liturgy,.. or saying it would bring
 a new stream of Christianity into a predominantly Protestant
 movement., Nikodim started talking of the value to Western
 Christians of the social experience they would gain from the
 Soviet Union."
 As the chief organizational. expression of the ecumenical
 movement in the world today, the WCC is by dictate of its charter
 apolitical,  Nevertheless, as the ROC became increasingly active,
 WCC statements increasingly reflected an imbalance in their
 political orientation  For example, following the August 1968
 invasion of Czechoslovakia, the statement issued by the WCC
 "deplored the military intervention" and called for the removal
 of the Warsaw Pact troops "at the earliest possible moment."
 In contrast, WCC statements on Vietnam issued during the same
 year had adopted standard North Vietnamese-Soviet terminology
 in calling for "an immediate and unconditional" halt to the
 bombing of North Vietnam.  The U.S. presence in Vietnam, according
 to WCC statements had brought about "mortal suffering of the
 Vietnamese people," while the Soviet presence in Czechoslovakia
 was viewed by the WCC as an "ill-considered action."
 The type of imbalance as reflected in these and other state-
 ments on East-West political issues has been a source of disillusion-
 ment to many Western churchmen.  The inadequacy, if not lack of
 response, from the WCC to appeals from those imprisoned in the
 USSR because of religious persecution is to many an added frustration.
 Within the ecumenical movement, an increasingly critical eye is
 being cast on "what it means to be in responsible communication with
 Christians in Communist societies."  (Among the attached clippings
 are included some which illustrate recent developments of political
 trends within the WCC.)

 SAMIZDAT SOURCES' CN RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN THE USSR
 The Soviet constitution guarantees each citizen the right
 to practice religion and states that anyone who prevents him
 from so doing is liable to punishment.  Samizdat* sources, however,
 ,provide evidence of religious persecution anTTow that Soviet
 laws are so framed as to enable the authorities to imprison believers
 for nothing more than the normal practice of their faith.
 Most samizdat documents on religious matters come from the
 Russian Or its odo`x -and Baptist sources. Religious protesters
 tend to concentrate on denominational matters.  Only a few
 individuals, such as Russian Orthodox dissenter and writer
 Aleksandr Levitin-Krasnov or the late Boris Talantov, have signed
 non-religious protest documents.
 Modification of the constitution is one of the Soviet believers'
 chief demands.  Since May 1929, believers do not have the right to
 teach religion to children or to other adults (except in officially
 recognized seminaries).  Soviet believers have also appealed for
 their constitutional rights as they stand; they have petitioned
 the officially approved religious authorities to permit a democratically
 elected hierarchy and appealed for the registration of so-called
 illegal sects, such as the dissident Baptists, and for the reinstate-
 ment of dismissed churchmen and against the closure of churches.
 Imprisonment
 Believers are frequently charged under Article 142 of the RSFSR
 Criminal Code - "violation of the laws on separation of Church from
 State and school from Church" - for which the maximum punishment is
 three years' deprivation of freedom.  They may also be charged under
 Article 227 for encouraging religious activities "harmful to the
 health of citizens" or.inciting people "to refuse to participate
 in social. activity or to fulfill their civic obligations."  Since
 1961 this: has carried a maximum sentence of five years deprivation
 of liberty or exile.  The longest known sentence on believers were
 those of 15, 13 and ten years' imprisonment given to leaders of the
 All-Russian Social-Christian Union for the Liberation of the People
 in Leningrad in 1967 and 1968.  This group has produced a political
 program for democratic reform 'and was engaged in clandestine para-
 military self-education and organization work.
 * samizdat translates as "we,publish ourselves," that is, not the  -
 state, but we, the people.

 According to a protest letter sent to the Presidium of the
 Supreme Soviet in 1969 by the imprisoned writers Daniel, Ginzburg
 and Galanskov, believers are prohibited from receiving any religious
 literature and may not even have a Bible while in prison.
 One result of putting so many believers in prisons and labor
 camps has been that they have sometimes formed religious groups
 there.  Mikhail Sado, serving a long sentence in one of the strict
 regime prison camps for criticizing Khrushchev, founded the All-
 Russian Social-Christian Alliance, according to a samizdat document
 written and distributed by Alexander Petrov-Agatov, himself a prisoner.
 Dissident Baptists
 A great deal of documentation about persecution of their
 members has been provided by the Evangelical Christian Baptists
 or initsiativniki, who broke away from the Baptist Church in 1965
 an  have never received official recognition.  They have at least
 two regular samizdat publications - including a monthly, Brats
 Listok, and a quarterly, Vestnik Spaseniya.
 The initsiativniki, who had objected to the compromises made
 by the leaders of   e Baptist Church to.placate the Communist
 regime, are particularly active, and some 500 of them have been
 imprisoned since 1961.  The repressive measures taken against
 them were described in an appeal to the party leadership by
 1,453 women in March 1969.  They said their children were victimized'
 and beaten up at school and sometimes forcibly removed from the
 parents by the KGB (secret police) and placed in children's homes.
 They had addressed thousands of petitions to the authorities
 begging for an end to persecution but it became even harsher:
 "Fines beyond our means, beatings-up, dismissal from jobs
 and institutes, confiscation of flats, arrests of fathers,
 husbands and, improbably as it may seem, mothers - this is
 the reply we have received so far from you to all our
 complaints..
 Russian Orthodox Church
 Less is known about the treatment of rank-and-file members
 of the Orthodox Church but the cases of three leading dissidents
 have been reported in the underground journal, Chronicle of Current
 Events.  Levitin-Krasnov who was arrested in September, 1969, and
 subsequently released has signed a number of protests about the
 abuse of civil rights in the Soviet Union and about the invasion
 of Czechoslovakia.  He was a member of the Action Group for the
 Defense of Hunan Rights in the Soviet Union.  After his arrest,
 a number of documents were circulated attesting to the excellence

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300050001-8
 of his character and the legality of his actions.  A letter
 from seven Christians, addressed to the World Council of Churches
 in September, 1969, said:
 "Anatoly Bmrmanuilevich was doing his duty as a Christian
 and none of his activities . . . infringed Soviet laws. . ."
 Boris.Talantov, a lay member of the Orthodox Church, who
 wrote a series of protest letters about the lack of religious
 freedom in the Soviet Union, was tried in September 1969, for
 allegedly publishing "anti-Soviet propaganda."  Chronicle No. 10
 (October, 1969) reported that he was given a two-year sentence
 in a labor camp.
 Neither the charge against the Orthodox priest Pavel Adelheim,
 arrested in December 1969, nor his sentence in known, but his
 character was smeared by Pravda Vostoka (the Uzbek Republican
 newspaper); which accuse  him o  sadism towards his wife and
 children.  According to Chronicle No. 13 (April 1970) however,
 his initiative and energy shad enabled believers in Kagan to
 build a new, stone church.  He was
 '"     . .  a young, well-educated priest and a good preacher,
 enjoyed great love and authority among his parishioners.
 His ecclesiastical activity was beyond reproach from the
 viewpoint of civil law."
 Ukrainian Uniate Church
 Increased activity of the Uniates, who acknowledge the supremacy
 of the Pope (but have been illegal since 1945), has been matched
 by increased persecution.  According to Chronicles Nos. 7 and 8
 ( April and June 1969), priests have been  etai.ne  and beaten up
 by the police.  On 18 Ottober 1968, the homes of ten were searched
 and religious objects confiscated.  In January 1969, Bishop
 Velichkovski, who was about 70 years old and in poor health, was
 arrested and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for infringing
 regulations.  (Bishop Velichkovski had been sentenced to ten year's
 hard labor when the.Uniate Church was forcibly integrated with
 the Orthodox Church in 1946.)
 Further information has come from a samizdat essay of
 January 1970, Chronicle of Resistance, by-Valentin Moroz, a
 Ukrainian historian.  He con epnne    e appropriation of religious
 works of art from a Uniate church in the Kiev area,' which belonged
 to a strongly nationalistic minority, the Hutsuls.  Arguing that
 religion and national culture had become inseparable in Eastern
 Europe, he said:

 Sectarians
 Few Sectarian protest documents have come to light other
 than those of the Evangelical Christian Baptists, but Chronicle
 No. 14 (June 1970) reported the case of a woman Adventist from
 Belorussia who was detained in December 1969, and illegally
 searched.  Her money was confiscated without a receipt.  In
 April 1970, her house was searched and religious literature
 confiscated.  Chronile No. 15 (August, 1970) noted that ten-year
 sentences had been passed on two women members of the schismatic
 True Orthodox Church and sentences of ten years and seven years
 plus five years' exile on two Jehovah's Witnesses.

 This phrase, which Incorpor.
 ated a basic policy premise of
 Independent-minded Romania,
 appeared to rule out at least
 for the Immediate future any
 dramatic Impetus toward an
 East European version of the
 Common Market.
 This also suggested to West-
 ern analysts that there had
 been no basic change in the;
 preference of the East Europe-!
 ans for bilateral rather than:
 multilateral solutions to their
 economic problems, which are
 now  being  highlighted  by

 prospect that the West Eurp-1

 This is because the East Eu.

 Romania, are trying to expand

 "Integrate" Its economy more'

 The agreement. announced
 Thursday. was hammered out
 by  a  three-clay  session  in

 Communist common market.
 It said the seven nations had

 Scintela, the Romanian Com-

 with an editorial stressing that
 Romania's independence was

 It singled out the points in
 the announcement that talked

 of full sovereignty on all prob.

 "The  program,"  Scintcial
 said, "clearly specifies that the
 socialist economic integration
 proceeds on the basis of fully

 any nation can opt out of any
 step of the integration process.

 It was quite a coincidence. The way
 Moscow tells it, the Communist Party
 boss of every nation in the Soviet bloc
 -with one notable exception-just hap-
 pened to be vacationing on Russia's
 Crimean peninsula last week. Since they
 were all on hand anyway, even Mon-
 golia's Yurnshagin Tscdcnbal, why not
 get together for a little fraternal talk?
 The missing party chief was Ruma-
 nia's independent-minded Nicolae Ceau-
 sescu, who was sunning himself on his
 country's own Black Sea coast. Was he
 deliberately overlooked by the Kremlin,
 or did he refuse to attend what was in re-
 ality a Communist summit conference?
 The question was asked with some ner-
 vousness in Eastern Europe last week;
 in August 1968 the Soviet-led invasion
 of Czechoslovakia was preceded by two,
 Warsaw Pact summit meetings from
 which the leaders of Prague's "Spring-
 time time of Freedom" had been excluded.
 There are other ominous parallels.
 The 1968 meetings were accompanied
 by military maneuvers, and last week a
 new Warsaw Pact exercise dubbed Opal
 71 began in Hungary, uncomfortably
 close to Rumania's western frontier. Ear-
 ly next week full-scale war games are
 scheduled to begin in Bulgaria, near Ru-
 mania's southern border.
 Cozy Relations. Moscow is irritated
 with Ceausescu for a number of rea-
 sons. Rumanian combat units have not
 participated in Warsaw Pact maneuvers
 for more than three years. Under a law
 that he concocted shortly after the 1968
 invasion  of  Czechoslovakia,  foreign
 troops may not cross Rumanian terri-
 tory without permission ;from the Na
 tional Assembly. As it happens, the As

 as many as 40,000 men, to the im-'
 pending war games in Bulgaria, or ship
 them across the Black Sea-unless it
 wants to risk marching them through
 Rumania without official permission.
 What most unsettles the Kremlin at
 the moment, however, is Ceausescu's
 cozy relations with China, particularly
 now that Peking and Washington are be-
 ginning to speak to one another. The
 Russians believe that the Rumanian lead-
 er helped to open Peking`s door to Rich-
 ard Nixon both before and during his
 own trip to Peking in June. With 600,000
 Russian troops stationed along China's
 borders and no sign of an end to the
 Sino-Soviet feud,  Moscow considers
 Ceausescu's conduct a grave breach of
 Socialist solidarity.
 Usual  Secrecy. Accordingly, ever
 since Ceausescu returned from China,
 the Soviets have been seeking an op-
 portunity to get the Warsaw Pact coun-
 tries together to censure him for his
 Asian indiscretions. Two weeks ago, the
 Soviet Ambassador to Bucharest handed
 Ceausescu a letter from Soviet Party
 Chief Leonid Brezhnev. Foreign dip-
 lomats in Rumania believe that the let-
 ter advised Ceausescu that a Communist.
 summit was going to be held in the Cri-
 mea but they disagree over whether
 Ceausescu refused an invitation or was
 snubbed. But as one high-ranking Ru-
 manian official put it, "If we had been in-
 vited, we would have participated."
 The meeting was surrounded by the
 usual secrecy; non-Communist observers
 are not even certain whether it was held
 at Sochi or 40 miles away at Pitsunda.
 Presumably, the conferees touched on a
 wide range of foreign policy problems
 -Berlin, the Soviet setback in the
 Sudan, China. What most interested
 Kremlinologists was the final conference
 communique containing a short but
 sharp denunciation of "left-wing and
 Steps are under

 adA-pltal.  ,
 right-wing  opportunism."  Translated,'
 that means China on the left and Yugo-
 slavia and Rumania on the right.
 Ceausescu's Law. In view of such crit-
 icisms, how has Rumania's leader man-
 aged to survive? For one thing. he has
 remained markedly conservative in do-
 mestic affairs. That has made it im-
 possible for the Soviets to accuse him
 of unorthodoxy. According to what
 Western observers call Ceausescu's Law,
 the more daring the foreign policy, the
 more rigidly conservative the domestic
 climate.  Accordingly,  Ceausescu  fol-
 lowed up his Peking trip with a tough
 crackdown on those "invidious Western
 influences" that the Soviets regularly
 criticize as bourgeois and decadent.
 Rumanians dubbed the new policy,
 which was announced only two weeks
 after Ceausescu's return from China,
 the mini-culturalh, after Peking's Cul-
 tural Revolution. Among the casualties
 so far have been acid-rock music on
 state radio and in youth clubs (too West-
 ern), the movie Midnight Cowbny (per-
 verted) and the American TV series
 The Untouchables (too violent). Ccau-
 sescu evidently believes that the mini-
 culturali, begins at home; his teen-age
 son Valentin appeared last week with
 his formerly long locks closely shorn.
 He explained to friends that his father
 had ordered the haircut.
 Will Nicolae Ceausescu's cultural pu-
 rity save him from Russia's wrath? In
 all likelihood, the Russian-Rumanian 1ri-
 sis will prove to be nothing more than
 a Soviet campaign of intimidation. The
 situation is significantly different f roni
 Czechoslovakia in 1968; the Russians
 know that the Rumanians, like the Yu-
 goslavs, would fight if they were at-
 tacked. Even so, the current war of
 nerves is an uncomfortable reminder to
 many East Europeans of that terrible

 . ,in this respect, the whole
 country Is unanimous. Our
 conflict with the Russians did
 not start when they expelled
 us from the Cominform in
 10,18, but even before the war,-
 when Tito defied Soviet efforts
 to dominate our Communist
 party."
 "The Russians," said anoth
 er, "have always wanted a lot
 from us - without giving any-.
 thing in return."
 Today the Soviet Union con-
 stitutes the biggest single out-.
 side threat to Yugoslav sover '
 eignty. +7his threat haunts the.
 Yugoslav leadership, the
 cadres of the Communist par-
 ty and the ordinary citizens.
 To the Russians, the success.
 of the Yugoslav economic ex-
 periment  in workers self
 management Is overshadowed
 by the country's persistent ef-
 forts to solve its nationalitie
 problems.
 Currently consisting of six
 republics and two autonomous
 provinces, Yugoslavia is im-.
 plementing a far-reaching pro-;
 ,gram of accentuating the au-.
 tonomy of the various regions

 If this succeeds - and

 can - it would constitute an
 enormous threat to the seeth-

 -Union.
 That is why Russia Is the
 biggest single enemy of this
 venture in Yugoslavia, often
 ideseribed as the first country
 =ln modern history to become a
 confederation  of  sovereign
 states.
 The constitutional amend-
 ments gradually put into ef-
 fect call for a large degree of
 autonomy for the republics,
 reserving for the federal gov-
 ernment the management of
 defense and foreign affairs
 plus some over-all economic
 guidelines.
 Whispering Campaign
 A rising whispering cam-

 Scholarships for Subversion:  A Footnote.  The recent announce-
 ment that   e Mexican-Soviet Cultural   c tinge Institute has dis-
 continued scholarships to Patrice Lunumba University in Moscow is
 an appropriate footnote to the disclosuresthat followed the recent
 arrest of the North Korean trained members of the Mexican guerrilla
 group, the Revolutionary Action Movement (MAR).  The cancellation,
 which applies not only to students already accepted but to future
 applicants as well, is obviously connected with the discovery that
 the MAR guerrillas were recruited while studying at Patrice Lumumba
 University.  With the expulsion from Mexico of five Soviet diplomats
 in connection with this scandal, the Soviet Union is now rightfully,
 if embarrassingly, linked to North Korea in the business of promoting
 world-wide revolution..  Thus it has apparently seen fit to lower its
 profile until this affair blows over..  (See Perspectives issues of
 May and June 1971 for articles on Lumunba University    North Korean

 was dead; but not quite.  At. the beginning of August this year
 Svetova Literatura reappeared -_ like Anne Boleyn atop the walls of
 the Towerof  Lon on, "with her, head tucked underneath her arm,"  The
 new editorial board was revealed to be made up mainly of dogmatists
 from the 1950's including the man who liquidated the Union of Czech
 Writers, Karel Bousek of the Ministry of Culture.  The new editorial
 board decreed in its policy statement that it will be the task of
 the revived periodical "to portray the progressive trends and
 phenomena in world literature from commited socialist positions and
 in the most accurate manner possible.  Svetova Literatura will be a
 literary revue of socialist orientation.

 According to this policy, the revived periodical has every
 right to sustain the exposure it so long accorded to Solzhenitsyn
 in,such tributes as the one in issue no. 4, 1968, when the magazine
 drew attention to the author's moral greatness.  We have appended
 a copy of Solzhenitsyn's challenge to the Soviet Security Police
 as it appeared in the 18 August 1971 issue of The Washington Post.
 The letter gives no evidence that it is the work of a person who
 has renounced socialism; it cannot be said to deviate one iota
 from socialist legality.  Indeed, any strengthening of the legal
 aspects of socialism must surely be a progressive trend or
 phenomena of the sort that Svetova Literatura's directors wish to
 emphasize.  And no one can maintain that t e letter does not present
 the facts with the utmost clarity.
 Warsaw Intercontinental On Its Way.  The Intercontinental Hotel
 Corporation, a British construction fii
 and the Polish tourist agency
 Orbis in mid-August signed a preliminary agreement for the construction
 of a 450-room hotel in Warsaw.  Orbis will manage the hotel when it
 is completed, probably by mid-1974.  The agreement while still tentative,
 ends a long period of Polish inaction on a project in which the Poles
 first expressed interest over two years ago.  It can be taken to
 indicate that the Gierek regime is willing to conclude agreements
 with Western firms which had evidently been rejected by the Gomulka
 regime as too bold, and thus to catch up with the less timid Warsaw
 Pact countries.  Bucharest and Budapest already are graced by Inter-
 continental Hotels.
 New "Legal System" for Cuba.  There has been a little-noted
 but significant development in-Cuba in the recent declaration that
 a new legal system, that recognizes only "the power of the revolution"
 will soon be adopted,  Known as the "Organic Law of the National Legal
 System," the new code officially subordinates the country's legal system
 to the Council of Ministers, headed by Castro himself.  Although this
 subordination has in fact existed since Castro took over the government
 in 1959, it has now been officially codified and provides an opportunity
 to point out that Castro will use every means possible to strengthen
 his personal grip on the government.

 For many years I have borne In silenca

 confiscation of half of it, the search of my
 dcorrespondents' homes and their official and

 Rozhdestvo, ' Naro-Fominsky  Rayou  was
 empty, and the eavesdroppers counted on
 my absence. Having returned to Moscow be.
 cause I was taken suddenly ill, I had asked
 my friend Alexander Gorlov to go out to `the
 country house for an automobile part. But it
 turned out there was'no.lock on the house
 and voices could be heard from inside. Gor-
 lav stepped inside and demanded the rob?
 hers' documents. In the small strueturfy,
 where three or four can barely turn around,
 there were about ten of them, in plain
 clothes.
 On the command of the senior officer To
 the woods with him and silence him'=--they
 "bound Gorlov, knocked him  down,  and
 dragged him face down into the woods and
 beat him. cruelly. Simultaneously, others
 were running by a circuitous route. through
 'toe bushes, carrying to their car packages,
 papers, objects perhaps also a part from the
 `apparatus they had brought themselves.
 However, Gorlov fopght back vigorously and
 ,yelled,  summoning  witnesses, neighbors
 from other garden plots came running In re-
 sponse to his shout$ and barred the robbers'
 way to the highway and demanded their doe-
 'uments. Then one of the robbers presented a
 red identification card and thepeighbors let

 tkn we can do anything."
 Captain-according to the documents he
 peoserted to the neighbors-Ivanov, accord-
 iii to his personal statement first took. Gor- ?.i
 lov to the Naro-Fominsky millta, where. the f
 local officers greeted "Ivanov" with defer-
 ence. There, "IvanoV" demanded from Gor-'
 lov written explanation of what had hap
 pened.  Although  he  had  been  fiercely,,
 beaten, Gorlov put in writing the purpose of a
 his trip and all the circumstances. After that
 the senior robber demanded ? that Gorlov:
 sign an oath of secrecy, Gorlov flatly re-
 fused.
 Then they. set off fors Moscow and on the {
 mad the senior robber bombarded Gorlovj
 vyith literally the following phrases: "If Sot-.
 zhenitsyn finds out what took place at. the 4
 Dacha,, it's all over with you, Your officiat
 career t Gorlov is a candidate of. technical.
 sciences and has presented his doctoral dis
 tertation for defense, works in the Institute ;
 Giprotis of Gosstroya of the ;U.S.S.R.] will go
 no farther, you will not be able to defend'
 any dissertation. This will affect your family:
 and children and, if necessary,, we will put
 yiiu in prison."
 Those who know our way of life know the
 full feasibility of these threats,, But Gorlov1
 dill not give in to them, refused to sign the
 pledge, and now he Is threatened with re-;
 prisa1.
 I demand from you, citizen minister, the
 public naming of all the robbers, their pun- {
 ishment as criminals and an explanation of.;
 this incident. Otherwise I can only believe
 that you sent them.
