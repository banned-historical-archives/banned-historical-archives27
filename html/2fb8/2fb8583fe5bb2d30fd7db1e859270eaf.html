 Talk of peace negotiations took over the Laotian scene this week. T
 Lao Communists=,proposals broadcast by Hanoi radio on 6 March, thorkh
 repeating old demanpds, contained specifics that have prompted the Royal
 Laotian Governmenl.and its allies to consider them seriously. In edition,
 Pathet Lao head Souphanouvong is sending a message to Souvanna- houma,
 Laotian prime minister'gnd half-brother of Souphanouvong, presumably as a
 follow-up to the peace proposals. There are still, however, numerous impedi-
 ments to an actual conveying of talks aimed at settling the: differences be-
 tween the various participants in the war. Pending this, the fighting goes on,
 with the North Vietnamese posing an increasingly serious threat to General
 Pao's headquarters at Long TieiIg.
 With the obvious prompting'-,of elements in the Cambodian Govern-
 ment, a mob of students and othhuk s sacked tie Vietnamese Communist
 embassies in Phnom Penh on 1 1 Marc, The dnionstrators followed this up
 the next day by rampaging into Viet ame~c sections of the city. These
 activities have produced the most seriou  risis to date between Sihanouk
 and conservatives in the cabinet led l   Qeputy Prime Minister Matak.
 Sihanouk has reacted sharply to this fjst Overt challenge to his long-held
 domination over the conduct of foreign affaie. About to leave Paris on a
 swing through several Communist countries, Sih  ouk curtailed the trip and
 is returning ahead of schedule to Phnom Penh to 'onfront the government
 leaders who have been slowly moving to limit his po er.
 The war in South Vietna?eithis week continued t  be relatively quiet.
 In one respect, however, tll  Communists are contining to make their
 presence felt. Enemy forced=are offering an increasingly st~ challenge to the
 pacification program in s Veral parts of the country. A nflinber of attacks
 have caused setbacks in~ocal areas and serve to remind the focal populace
 that the Communists ar still around in force.

 The leadership g i Communist China is continuing to demapstrate its
 desire to conduct the nation's business out of public view. Mao Tse-tung and
 Lin Piao have bee)i absent now for five months, and several other top leaders
 have not appeared publicly for varying periods. Although Mao may yell be
 slowing down, .there are no reports that he is sick. Presumably he contiiues
 to be active behind the scenes, dealing with various domestic and infer-
 national problems.

 The Communists seem to be
 offering an increasingly stiff
 challenge to the pacification
 program in several parts of the
 country.   Enemy forces struck
 hard at three government out-
 posts on 9-10 March, overrunning
 one position in Phu Yen Province
 on the central coast and another
 near Can Tho in the delta.   A
 second outpost in Phu Yen came
 under heavy Communist pressure
 but held out.   The government's
 Territorial Security Forces lost
 35 dead and 42 wounded in the ac-
 tions; there were no reports of
 any enemy losses.   Also last week,
 a number of other government out-
 posts in the delta and south of
 Da Nang in I Corps were hit hard.

 The specific missions of these
 highly trained forces are not
 known, but they should consid-

 of the five enemy regiments and
 other replacement troops that the

 to IV Corps since mid-1969.

 Although many members of the
 National Assembly have denounced
 the government's handling of the
 Chau case, it has had little ap-
 parent effect on government-
 backed legislation thus far.   The
 Upper House passed the govern-
 ment's high priority land reform
 bill by a substantial majority
 last week and sent it back to
 the Lower House for further ac-
 tion.   It will probably still be
 some time before the program is
 enacted, although the Lower House
 is scheduled to take up the bill
 again next week.
 The Saigon press, meanwhile,
 has not let the recent atmosphere
 deter it from confronting the
 government over a matter it con-
 sidered of vital economic inter-
 est:   a new tax decree, which
 among other things, would have
 doubled the cost of imported
 newsprint.   The press threatened
 to engage in repeated strikes,
 reportedly with support from the
 powerful Vietnamese Confederation
 of Labor.   This caused the gov-
 ernment to back down and revise
 its decree by revoking the con-
 troversial tax.   The conciliatory
 action suggests that President
 Thieu wishes to avoid any further
 appearance of repression at a
 time when he has been receiving
 adverse publicity over the Chau

 PHNOM PENH IS SERIOUSLY CHALLENGING SIHANOUK'S POWER
 Sihanouk is returning to Cam-
 bodia to reassert his authority in
 the wake of unprecedented attacks
 against the Vietnamese Communist
 embassies in Phnom Penh.   The sack-
 ing of the North Vietnamese and Pro-
 visional Revolutionary Government
 diplomatic installations by thousands
 of students caps a period of growing
 anti-Communist sentiment and has
 produced the most serious crisis to
 date in Cambodia's relations with
 Hanoi and the Viet Cong.
 There is no doubt that the at-
 tacks, which protested the presence
 of Vietnamese Communist troops on
 Cambodian territory and the forth-
 coming visit of North Vietnamese
 Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, were
 government inspired.   The assaults
 in the capital were preceded and
 followed by anti - Viet Cong demon-
 strations in several provinces, and
 portions of the Vietnamese community
 in Phnom Penh also were objects of
 mob actions.   The attacks received
 the unanimous support of a special
 session of both houses of the Cam-
 bodian legislature, which passed a
 declaration asking the government
 to take all measures necessary im-
 mediately to solve the problem of
 Viet Cong infiltration.
 The Cambodian chief of state
 has curtailed his scheduled visits
 to Prague, Moscow, and Peking and
 notified the Queen that he is re-
 turning to Cambodia to call for a
 referendum,  asking the people and
 the army to choose between himself
 and "those personalities" who or-
 ganized the sieges on the embassies
 on 11 March.   He threatened to step
 down if he loses; he has used such
 threats in the past to quiet domes-
 tic criticism.
 Sihanouk's decision to return
 abruptly is a clear sign that he
 interprets these events as a strong
 challenge to his authority. Sihanouk
 and the government have been at odds
 for some time, but the assaults on
 the Vietnamese represent the first
 overt attempt by the government to
 undermine his foreign policy.   Al-
 though Sihanouk has led the criti-
 cism of Vietnamese Communist ac-
 tivities in Cambodia, he has taken
 some pains to avoid pressing the
 Communists too far.
 It is still not clear what gov-
 ernment leaders hoped to achieve by
 the attacks.   By playing on tradi-
 tional Cambodian animosity. toward
 the Vietnamese, they may have wanted
 to confront Sihanouk on an issue on
 which popular opinion would be
 against him.   They may also, how-
 ever, have miscalculated Sihanouk's
 reaction.   Until now,  the govern-
 ment's  strategy has been to limit
 Sihanouk's power slowly and care-
 fully.  They must now decide whether
 to meet Sihanouk head on or give
 ground.   Much will depend on how
 hard Sihanouk presses them and
 whether individuals  like Deputy
 Prime Minister Matak, who has led
 the anti-Sihanouk forces,  calculate
 that they can count on firm and con-
 tinuin   su   ort from those forces.

 CHINA'S ABSENT LEADERS
 Chinese Communist Party
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung and his
 designated heir Lin Piao have
 once again slipped into the shad-
 ows.   This time they have been
 publicly inactive for five months.
 In fact, aside from three cere-
 monial appearances in October
 1969, they have been out of the
 public eye since last April and
 May, when they appeared in con-
 nection with the Ninth Party Con-
 gress.
 it appears that
 infrequent public appearances
 have become a style of leadership
 in China.                 Although Chou En-lai
 and several other leaders have
 appeared frequently, about one

 Adding to the impression of
 aloofness from Mao is the fact
 that he has entirely stopped
 turning out "latest  instruc-
 tions," pronouncements which
 played such an important part in
 Peking's propaganda during the
 Cultural Revolution.   The last
 such instruction was originally
 issued in September as a National
 Day slogan without attribution to
 Mao, but later propaganda des-
 cribed it as Mao's own composi-

 Despite his public inactiv-

 is following the Sino-Soviet bor-

 Moscow has published its most authoritative statement on SALT since
 the end of the Helsinki talks. A Pravda "Observer" article on 7 March
 emphasized Soviet concern over recent US decisions on defense-particularly
 the plan to expand Safeguard-but did not tie success at the forthcoming
 Vienna\negotiations to repudiation of these programs. On the same duty,
 Pravda al o carried an article that could be read as a sign that SALT has
 caused disreement in the Kremlin. The article reminded the military of its
 subordinatidc to the will of the party.

 reviewed for the record concessions that Warsar! expects from Bonn before a

 EAST GERMANS INTENSIFY INDOCTRINATION OF POPULACE
 The East Germans are again
 displaying concern over the po-
 litical reliability of the people
 and are intensifying ideological
 indoctrination among the masses.
 Although there is little overt
 opposition to the regime, Pankow
 appears concerned over the lack
 of popular ideological fervor and
 commitment.
 As in the past, East German
 party  (SED)  cadres are paying par-
 ticular attention to the youth
 whom they accuse of aping Western
 "pop culture," of refusing to be-
 come involved in regime-sponsored
 programs, and  of being influenced
 by the New Left ideologies.   Of-
 ficial warnings are continually
 made about "Western unculture,"
 which Pankow believes could in-
 fluence people to oppose party
 policies.   A recent article in a
 party publication charged that
 this could lead to "open counter-
 revolution as, for example, in 1968
 in Czechoslovakia."
 To counter Western influence,
 Pankow is vigorously trying to chan-
 nel young peoples' energies and to
 curb unrest by making "concessions"
 in areas such as music and fashions,
 while increasing its efforts at
 ideological indoctrination.   The
 regime is also reducing drastic-
 ally the amount of free time avail-
 able to the young by conducting
 obligatory premilitary training
 and using "youth brigades" on con-
 struction projects.   More young
 SED members are being directed
 to take over leadership positions
 in local youth organizations to
 combat the growing unwillingness
 of members to participate in re-
 gime-approved activities.   The SED
 recently distributed to students
 a 30-page questionnaire obviously
 designed to detect "deviationist"
 tendencies, particularly those
 concerning Pankow's policy toward
 Bonn.
 Intensified ideological work
 is also going on in the factories.
 Here, too, party cadres are encoun-
 tering apathy and open grumbling.
 Even the military appear to have
 encountered problems in their ideo-
 logical work.   Minister of Defense
 Hoffmann recently called on the
 armed forces to rid themselves of
 "illusions concerning the imperial-
 ist opponent."

 FANFANI CHOSEN TO TRY TO END ITALY'S CRISIS
 Following former premier Aldo
 Moro's decision on 11 March not to
 undertake formation of a new gov-
 ernment, President Saragat has
 turned to another former premier,
 Amintore Fanfani,  in yet another
 attempt to avoid calling early
 parliamentary elections.   Fanfani
 has accepted "the task of making
 necessary contacts for the forma-
 tion of a new government."
 In view of the failure of ef-
 forts so far to form a four-party
 center-left coalition, Fanfani is
 likely to try for an all-Christian
 Democratic government with support
 of the other center-left parties.
 Such a government would allow tem-
 pers to cool as each of the par-
 ties decides on its future course.
 It would also presumably permit
 preparations to go forward for the
 regional and local elections this
 spring.
 All the issues that have kept
 the center-left parties apart re-
 main,  among them those on which
 feeling has recently been partic-
 ularly intense:   the Vatican's
 open challenge of the divorce law
 now pending in parliament,  and the
 question of defining what support
 the government may accept from
 Communists in parliament on impor-
 tant questions.   The two Socialist
 parties differ on guarantees to be
 required before forming tactical
 alliances with the communists in
 local governments.   Some Christian
 Democrats prefer an all-Christian
 Democrat government, which would
 allow their party more cabinet
 seats.   Their left wing, however,
 prefers an exclusive two-party
 coalition with the left-wing So-
 cialist Party.   Finally,   any
 leader trying to form a govern-
 ment is hindered by the conflict-
 ing leadership ambitions of other
 politicians who do not want to
 boost their rival's chances.
 Thus the government crisis is
 prolonged both by the issues and
 by the political maneuvering of
 the so-called "political class."
 Even if parliament were to be dis-
 solved and new elections called--
 and President Saragat has been de-
 termined to avoid this if at all
 possible--there is no assurance
 that the electorate would clarify
 the political scene in ways  that
 would lead to a new more stable
 center-left coalition.   If Fanfani
 fails to form a government, how-
 ever,  Saragat will have few alter-
 natives but to a call for                                                                              arlia-
 mentary elections.

 STUDENT UNREST IN FRANCE FLARES UP AGAIN
 Discontent on France's trou-
 bled Nanterre University campus
 erupted last week into the largest
 student-police confrontation since
 the May-June crisis of 1968.   Or-
 der has been restored and the
 school reopened, but leaders of
 the UNEF  (National Union of French
 Students), France's most powerful
 student union, this week called
 for "a campaign for a massive and
 spectacular boycott" of student
 elections scheduled for next month.
 Such statements, and the activities
 of the far-left student groups
 that sparked last week's conflict,
 are likely to increase tension both
 at Nanterre and throughout the
 French university and secondary
 school system.
 Public opinion in France is
 especially sensitive to the latest
 outburst because it was students
 from Nanterre who launched the
 1968 student-labor crisis.   In
 general, most Frenchmen deplore
 the activities of campus radicals,
 but among the moderate student ma-
 jority there is enough sympathy
 for the dissidents to prevent any
 concerted action against them.
 Ironically,  the present cha-
 otic situation in French universi-
 ties is largely the result of re-
 form efforts initiated by De Gaulle
 after the 1968 upheaval.   De
 Gaulle's education minister, Edgar
 Faure, pursued the government's
 reform program--which was aimed
 at decentralization and student
 and faculty participation in uni-
 versity affairs--vigorously and
 won the praise of many students.
 When Pompidou took office last
 June, however, Faure was replaced
 by Olivier Guichard, a man less
 committed to reform ate.--out of
 touch with student problems.
 The unrest at Nanterre may
 spread to other campuses in the
 spring, and this will force the
 Pompidou government to devote more
 attention to what is known in
 France as the "youth problem."
 The government's first line  f
 dei\ense is a police force  th
 spebial components trainee and
 specially equipped to cofront
 the students, but any 1 ng-range
 solutio  to unrest in yhe uni-
 versitie  will requir  a more
 vigorous    xecution     reform
 legislation already enacted by
 the National  ssemby.   The broader
 problem affec  ng  he government
 is a widesprea feling, both among
 students and wor -ers, that the Fifth
 Republic's system is so inflexible
 that only direct a tion tactics
 bring results.
 French history i  replete
 with examples of events repeating
 themselves and at some p int the
 May-June crisis of 1968 m     be re-
 played.   Unless student an                                                                   labor
 unrest is deeper than most  bserv-
 ers believe, however, no major
 explosion will disturb France:!s
 social.peace this spring.   Ner-
 theless, scattered student demon-
 strationsri-the sprin  should not
 be ruled out.

 HUNGARY REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC REFORM
 Premier Fock,  in a recent
 speech to the National Assembly,
 emphatically affirmed Hungary's
 determination to continue the
 economic reform program  (NEM)  and
 to link reforms more closely with
 "democratization" of Hungarian
 life.
 In order to mollify critics
 of reform,  including those from
 the USSR, he denied that the NEM
 violates socialist practices and
 indicated that its tempo will con-
 tinue to be governed by circum-
 stances.   Fock side-stepped cer-
 tain recent criticisms of the
 NEM by attributing many difficul-
 ties to the weakness of govern-
 ment officials in the bureauc-
 racy. He stated that the regime
 will not transfer the blame for
 difficulties in implementing the
 reform to enterprises nor react
 by restricting their rights and
 authority.
 A major objective of Hun-
 gary's economic policy is improv-
 ing the standard of living.  The
 goal is to increase real per cap-
 ita national income at an annual
 rate of five percent and to in-
 crease the availability of con-
 sumer goods.   Fock criticized
 the uneconomic use of labor and
 called for increased discipline
 as a critical step in raising
 productivity.   At the same time
 he claimed that a high level of
 employment will be guaranteed
 despite the planned closure of
 inefficient plants and a reduc-
 tion in construction of new en-
 terprises.
 Housing remains a serious
 problem despite overfulfillment
 of 1969 construction plans in
 that area.   Budapest still hopes
 to build one third more dwellings
 during 1971-75 than in the cur-
 rent five-year period.
 Plans to increase trade and
 other forms of cooperation with
 both socialist and  nonsocialist
 countries are in the making. Pur-
 chases of licenses and formation
 of joint enterprises with non-
 socialist countries are slated
 to increase.   For the first time
 in several years, Hungary in 1969
 had a trade surplus with both so-
 cialist and capitalist countries
 as well as as surplus in its bal-
 ance of payments.
 In line with further imple-
 mentation of the NEM program,
 state subsidies will not be given
 to enterprises deemed inefficient
 by the regime.   The development
 of industry is to be more selec-
 tive, with power, chemicals,
 aluminum processing, and petro-
 leum refining among those to be
 expanded.
 The Hungarian regime has
 been able to live with its re-
 form program for two years with-
 out backing down.   It is not yet
 clear, however, whether the NEM
 is going to pay off in ways that
 really count--increased effi-
 ciency, economic growth, and a
 relatively higher standard of liv-
 ing for the average Hungarian.

 AIR SAFETY MEASURES UNRESOLVED
 Interna'ional measures to
 deal with the\problem of civil

 subject of intehsive discussion
 in recent weeks,but wide support
 for any specific aproach is
 still lacking.   Agr1oement on any

 International Civil Aviaion Or-
 ganization  (ICAO)  or a special in-
 ternational conference thaw month
 under ICAO auspices.
 This week the executive  Cpm-

 Transport Association  (IATA), thV
 airlines' organization, called or
 the airports of the world to pro-'
 vide "all appropriate means" to
 ensure the physical protection of
 passengers and aircraft.   Under
 the guidance of IATA Director Gen-
 eral Knut Hammarskjold, the com-
 mittee drafted a "security action4
 program" that will be presented,"
 to the May ICAO meeting.
 Earlier in the month, the
 intergovernmental European Civil
 Aviation Conference took similarly
 tepid action after two days of
 debate at an emergency/session in
 Paris.   The 19 delegartes could
 only agree to support the  convening
 of the ICAO Assembly  and to call
 on their governmejits to establish
 "airport security committees" to
 counter sabotage and hijacking
 attempts.
 The Swiss and the Austrians
 have beenthe primary proponents
 of both alternatives  for an ICAO

 may choose one of the alternatives
 next week.   The US has picked up

 The tempo and weight of Israel's military strikes against its Arab
 '
 s apparent self-imposed
 neighbors dropped somewhat in the past week. Israel
 paus6 included an extended halt in air strikes against targets in Jordan, but
 even Fiore noticeable was the let-up against Egypt. Although the Israelis
 broke a~lull of several days in air strikes across the Suez on 12 March, they
 have not bit close to Cairo since 26 February.
 Announcement  From both Iraqi and Kurdish spokesmen have pro-
 claimed an end to th  Kurdish rebellion. Baghdad had been discussing a
 solution with Kurdish r\eseptatives for sonic time, but the Kurds had been
 resisting the governmen. A similar agreement in 1966 proved fragile
 and broke down comple68.
 The political situation in  urkey remains muddled. Although Prime
 Minister Demirel probably will rec 've a_ new vote of confidence this week-
 end, the narrow margin will not pro h S)tc strong government. Meanwhile, a
 new wave of militant anti-Americans' may be forming as young radicals,
 possibly Maoist-oriented, continue the\. student rallies to generate more
 revolutionary fervor.
 Ceylonese Prime Minister Senanayake's at N ounccment that Parliament
 will be dissolved on 25 March has climinatedthe need for a scheduled
 by-election and has created speculation that elect ns for a new parliament
 will be held in late May,. Senanayake's United Natio , all Party now appears to
 hold a slight lead over the leftist opposition coalition. Elimination of the
 by-election precludes the risk of his party suffering a  ychological blow by
 losing in what has been a bellwether district.
 The sixth conference of Maghreb economic ministA , which was to
 have opened ,in Rabat on 10 March, was apparently for           doed by the
 Algerians when the Libyan delegation failed to show. The meters were to
 have signed a "charter" integrating the economics of the four Na th African
 countries.-The Libyans have long believed that the others       L~byan oil
 revenues as a means to finance intra-Maghreb economic development.llgeria
 has committed its own oil revenues to such cooperation and was unwilling to
 go ahead without Libyan participation.
 Jacques Foccart, France's primary operator in African affairs, will
 arrive in Congo (Kinshasa) on 16 March for discussions with President
 Mobutu. Mobutu may use the visit to seek support from Paris for his efforts
 to isolate the radical regime in Brazzaville. Foccart, for his part, may play on
 Mobutu's fears of Brazzaville in order to extend French presence in Kin-

 ISRAEL AND FEDAYEEN PUT SQUEEZE ON LEBANON
 Israel is keeping pressure
 on the Beirut government for new
 curbs on fedayeen activities
 across the Lebanese-Israeli bor-
 der.
 Over the past two months the
 fedayeen have moved down from the
 eastern region and permeated the
 central and western sectors of
 the border, giving them easier
 access to Upper Galilee.)
 To back up their series of
 warnings to Lebanon--including
 threats to establish a "no-man's
 land" in depth in southern
 Lebanon--Israel carried out a
 cross-border raid the night of
 6-7 March.   An Israeli force
 destroyed seven buildings  in the
 village of Ayta ash Shab and
 warned the villagers of future
 reprisals if they continued to
 assist the fedayeen.   Earlier,
 Israeli forces had clashed with
 Arab guerrillas in the same gen-
 eral area, but on the Israeli
 side of the border near Shetula.
 Israel also claims to have killed
 five fedayeen on 8 March west of
 the Israeli settlement of Zarit
 in the central sector.
 on Lebanese soil.
 The fedayeen issue has ag-
 gravated the deep divisions
 within the Lebanese body politic;
 these splits will become even more
 serious as the presidential elec-
 tion approaches in late summer.
 Lines have already been drawn
 within the cabinet and the elec-
 torate between opponents of the
 fedayeen and their supporters.
 In general, Lebanese Muslims--who
 probably constitute more than half
 the population--support the feda-
 yeen wholeheartedly.   The Chris-
 tians,  on the other hand,  though
 strongly anti-Israel, are more
 concerned about preserving the
 independence of Lebanon from the
 rest of the Arab Muslim world.
 They want to avoid Israeli retal-
 iation against Lebanon, because
 this could result in the presence

 INDIA'S PARLIAMENT MEETS ON BUDGET
 The traditionally acrimonious
 budget session of the Indian Parlia-
 ment has gotton off to an unusually
 mild start.   Prime Minister Gandhi,
 anxious to deprive her political
 enemies of a strong controversial
 issue to use against her, has
 steered a careful legislative
 course. On the whole, her proposals
 have been less far reaching than
 the fanfare attending the creation
 of her "new and radical" Congress
 Party last fall had led the con-
 servatives to expect.   At the same
 time, her programs appear "progres-
 sive" enough to mollify the "young
 Turks" in her party who had earlier
 criticized her for not building so-
 cialism fast enough.
 The budget for the fiscal year
 beginning 1 April, which Mrs.
 Gandhi, as her own finance minis-
 ter, presented to Parliament on
 28 February, was only mildly ex-
 pansionary.   She told the legis-
 lators her aim was to "reconcile
 the imperative of growth with con-
 cern for the well-being of the
 masses."  The budget does not
 really provide much of a stimulus
 for increased economic growth,
 however.
 Mrs. Gandhi's suggested rev-
 enue measures are only marginally
 different from those accepted last
 year, but it is possible that Par-
 liament will still balk at approv-
 ing all of them.   Both the govern-
 ment and the legislature will prob-
 ably be able to reach an agreement
 because, at this juncture,  neither
 side appears anxious to create con-
 ditions that could topple the gov-
 ernment and risk the expense and
 uncertainties of a new election.
 The budget session does not ad-
 journ until May, however, and Mrs.
 Gandhi will need to continue to
 move cautiously.   Elections for one
 third of the seats in the upper
 house of Parliament are scheduled
 for the beginning of next month.
 Mrs. Gandhi's faction now controls
 less than half of the state legis-
 latures whose members, in turn,
 elect the deputies in the upper
 house.   Her faction's strength in
 that house, therefore, is almost
 certain to decline.   Legislative
 initiative rests mainly with the
 lower house of Parliament, but up-
 per house members can block legis-
 lation if the lower house is closely
 divided.
 Meanwhile, tensions building
 on other fronts are likely to put
 additional strains on the govern-
 ment while Parliament is in session.
 Violence has been on the increase
 in the Communist-dominated state
 of West Bengal and the government
 there is in danger of collapse.
 Such an event would put Mrs. Gandhi
 under pressure to recommend "presi-
 dent's rule" for West Bengal.   She
 has been reluctant to intervene,
 however, because historically such
 a move has tended to deflect the
 public's irritation away from in-
 ternal state troublemakers   toward
 the central government.   Her con-
 cern for maintaining potential sup-
 porters among Communist legislators
 in New Delhi is also an inhibiting
 factor, but she may ultimately opt
 for a limited form of  "president's
 rule" in the hopes that a cooling-
 off period might lead to the suc-
 cessful formation of an alternative
 government.

 NIAKARIOS RETAINS CONTROL IN CYPRUS
 President Makarios has again

 With thousands of Greek-Cypriots
 demonstratir\g support for him in
 the streets &nd with messages ex-
 pressing horrkr at the attack com-

 has at least teporarily recovered
 the prestige lo -4,-t during the months
 of gradually increasing political
 fragmentation in the Greek-Cypriot

 long drawn-out intercommunal t9.lks
 and his withdrawal from poli  `cal
 life.   This might not be ary'unwel-
 come  development for Malyrios, but
 it could spell the end/f the dia-
 logue between the Grey    Cypriot and
 Turkish-Cypriot con Unities, which
 has at least helpplft to preserve a
 shaky truce for,,, any months.
 Makar'os may also choose to

 for- his year in order to avoid the
 rl. k they would have of diffusing
 is own authority.   He could also
 insist on his own arrangement for
 apportioning parliamentary seats
 among the several progovernment
 parties.
 Although such moves might gain
 Makarios temporary political advan-
 tages, they will not diminish the
 danger of future attempts on his
 life by the several groups of de-
 termined and dangerous enemies who
 mow consider him a traitor to the
 use of union with Greece  (enosis).

 Following Rhodesia's shift to re-

 most Western countries with con-

 they will close their missions,
 following the US lead.

 Only South Africa and Portugal

 however, probably believed, as did
 the black African states,  that the
 US consulate was the key to Rho-

 therefore,  is a strong psychologi-

 GOVERNMENT WINS VICTORY IN SALVADORAN ELECTIONS
 The
 official
 landslide victory of the
 government party in last
 Sunday's congressional and municipal
 elections removes the threat of mil-
 itary intervention.   Although Presi-
 dent Sanchez will have to contend
 with charges of voting irregularity
 raised by the opposition Christian
 Democrats, primary attention will re-
 turn to the country's development
 problems and to the festering quar-
 rel with Honduras.
 Incomplete returns indicate
 that the government party has won
 more than 60 percent of the congres-
 sional seats and has control of lo-

 will probably try to discredit the
 government by claiming that it used
 harassment and coercion to ensure
 victory.   Nevertheless, the order-
 liness of the election process and
 the absence of violence will sharply
 limit the ability of the opposition
 to embarrass the government.
 Both the Christian Democrats
 and members of the economic elite
 will be closely monitoring the gov-
 ernment's attitude toward land re-
 form and revision of the banking law
 and labor code.   In the pre-election
 period, the government tentatively
 accepted the legislative reform pro-
 gram begun last November after the
 Christian Democrats joined with dis-
 sident members of the government
 party to overthrow the unprogressive
 assembly leadership.   President San-
 chez will probably be convinced
 that there are political advantages
 in a continued commitment to reform,
 but he may wish to moderate the pace.
 With elections out of the way,
 the Salvadoran Government will prob-
 ably wish to resume bilateral talks
 with Honduras in an effort to im-
 prove relations.   Prompt resumption
 of negotiations, however, may be
 difficult, because the Hondurans
 are still upset about a border clash

 ARGENTINE PRESIDENT MOVES TO FORESTALL LABOR UNREST
 The government is maneuvering
 to prevent a new eruption of labor
 unrest this month as workers return
 from summer vacations.   Two recent
 moves appear to be aimed primarily
 at farm hands and other low-paid
 workers in the provinces, where so-
 cial and economic conditions are not
 good and where local labor leaders
 have little sympathy for the rela-
 tionship developing between national
 labor leaders and the government.
 On 27 February the government
 unexpectedly announced the creation
 of a social services  fund to extend
 medical benefits to more than six
 million workers.   The money col-
 lected, which is expected to be
 about $200 million annually, will be
 controlled and allocated at the na-
 Page 2 8
 tional level by the unions them-
 selves.   The government obviously
 hopes that the decree will blunt ex-
 pected pressures for an inflationary
 wage increase and buy additional
 time for the administration's eco-
 nomic stabilization program.   Simi-
 larly, the naming of former Peronist
 Felipe Sapag as governor of the in-
 terior province of Neuquen, a post
 he had held previously, is appar-
 ently intended to quiet labor unrest
 in that province and win the support
 of Peronist labor leaders for the
 labor confederation now being cre-
 ated by the Ongania government.
 It is questionable, however,
 whether the government's tactics
 will succeed.   Farm hands, railroad
 workers, and other minimum-wage

 workers who benefited most from the
 Ongania government's wage conces-
 sions  last year will probably be
 content for the present.   Problems
 could come, however, from the more
 volatile and better organized in-
 dustrial workers.   Before 1967 they
 were accustomed to receiving annual
 wage increases that exceeded 30 per-
 cent--a rate that ran ahead of in-
 flation.   Real wages fell in 1967-68,
 but recent hikes have amounted to
 about 11 percent,  just a little
 more than the cost of living rise.
 Nevertheless, many workers believe
 that their wages still are lagging
 behind cost of living increases,
 especially since the recent rises
 in public transportation fares and
 basic food prices..
 If provincial labor leaders
 begin agitating for wage increases,
 national leaders may adopt a more
 militant stance to preserve their
 own influence and position with
 union members.   By seizing the in-
 itiative, giving labor leaders a
 large slush fund to administer,
 Ongania apparently hopes to outma-
 neuver the more militant labor
 leaders and bolster the position
 of those leaders who favor cooper-
 ation with the government.
