has been acting as spokesman for the group. On 4:Ju1y 1968 
he and Markt.-HAFIRO, another deserter, staged a sit-in at 
the Amer:ran EMbassy in Stockholm, for which they were arrested. 
Released on bond, they illegally left Sweden to attend the 
Ninth World Youth Festival in Sofia, Bpluiria, as guests of 
the Festival Committee and the Bulgarian Government. If JONES 
does not return to Sweden because of the pending jail sentence, 
someone else will replace him as spokesman for the deserters.

fight in a revolution against the U.S. Government. He feels 
that the capitalists can be made to change only when there 
has been a violent revolution and the power structure has 
been removed from their hands. Ue views the war in Vietnam 
as the logical end of American capitalism. 
3. JONES is a Castro-type revolutionary and opposes the 
Soviet view on revolution. He pointed out that it is easier 
to land in jail in a Socialist country than in a neutral or 
Western country, and that one must he very careful in expressing 
one's views in a Socialist country. lie has no immediate plans 
for his future.

Delegation to the Ninth World Youth Festival 
1. The Bulgarians listed below, last names unknown, were 
interpreters assigned to the American delegation to the Ninth 
World Youth Festival (28 July - 6 August 1968) in Sofia, Bulgaria. 
The interpreters were between 21 and 25 years of age, 
2. Bmil,.the chief interpreter, said that he 145-S graduated 
a few years ago from the Harvard University School of Interna-
tional Marketing (or the International Marketing Institute at 
Harvard University) and hoped to return to the United States 
soon. He had volunteered for the interpreting job and would 
receive no pay for his services. He said that Bulgaria was 
a long way from Communism and that it will take several genera-
tions for the people to develop the correct spirit. He fully 
expects the time to come when each man will contribute his 
utmost and the State will satisfy all of his needs. He admitted 
that he had two cars and, for this reason, he considered him-
self selfish. 
(COMMENT: Emil ispossibly identical with

3. Nicole, 23, is a political science major and is about 
to complete his schooling. He hopes to enter the Bulgarian 
foreign service and eventually come to the United States. He 
said that he had been separated from his I9-year old wife since 
May 1968 and was hoping that the separation would help mold her 
to his pattern. He spent much of his time with the women of 
the American delegation. 
4. Mino (accented on last syllable) said he is a chemistry 
student and will work in a chemical plant until 1969. He 
learned English in school. 
S. Sanya, one of three female interpreters, said she is 
a student and lives with her parents in Sofia. The girls were 
quiet, unfriendly, and apparently serving as interpreters because 
they were ordered to do so. Sanya complained of the long hours, 
admitting that she retired at 0200 hours and had to arise at 
0600 hours. 
6. Another male interpreter, both names unknown, was in 
the tobacco business and was frequently absent because he was 
attending conferences, one of which was in Plovdiv. He was 
short, fat, in his 40's, and resembled Khrushchev.

Allgarian Contacting an American Participant in the

1. Nicola LNU was at the Vinzavod, a wine-bottling plant 
outside of Sofia, Bulgaria, about 30 July or 1 August 1968, 
when the American delegation to the Ninth World Youth. Festival 
visited the plant. He struck up a conversation with one of the 
delegation members, stating he wished to practice his English. 
He said that he wanted to visit the United States and was 
awaiting a visa. He indicated that he would be working for the 
Bulgarian Government in Washington, D.C. 
2. Kola is about 38 or 40 years old, 5'9" tall, has black 
hair, and is of medium build, weighing from 155 to 160 pounds. 
He is from the seaport of Varna on the Black Sea, is married 
and has two children, a boy of 15 and a girl of 8. His English 
is quite limited as he has studied for only six months. He 
was unable to engage in a meaningful conversation. He finally 
admitted he was in the Bulgarian diplomatic service, but below 
the rank of Ambassador. He seemed to lack foreign-language 
ability, other than his limited knowledge of English. He 
appeared quite naive, particularly in his questions concerning 
prices, living conditions, and schooling in the Washington, D.C. 
area. He was friendly and was quite proper in his behavior, 
asking no provocative questions. He said that he worked in a 
government office in Sofia and spent the weekends with his family. 
3. Kola met the delegation member at the American Housing 
Area the following morning, by arrangement, and the two went 
shopping. Kola bought $10 to $15 worth of gifts for the 
delegation member and his family, including a wooden half-liter 
flask and an embroidered handkerchief. Most of the purchases 
were bought in ZUM, the Bulgarian State Store and Kola pocketed 
receipts for each purchase. 
4. Kola did not meet with the delegation member again, but 
took his name and address in the United States and said he hoped 
to contact him there. 
5. None of the Bulgarian interpreters admitted knowing Kola.

SEP 1958 
1. Steve GERSHADER is a U.S. Army deserter who has been 
living in Sweden since May 1968. He attended the Ninth World 
Youth Festival in Sofia, Bulgaria (28 July - 6 August 1968), 
at the invitation of the Festival Committee and the Bulgarian 
Government. 
2. GERSHADER, a draftee, had expected to receive some 
political education in the Army but remained uninformed and 
no explanation was ever provided as to the Army's role in 
Vietnam or the reason it was there. He felt that the Army 
placed no value on his life and began reading material made 
available by North Vietnam, the National Liberation Front, and 
anti-war groups in the United States. He discovered sufficient 
information in this material to cause him to be concerned over 
his future, which led to his desertion. He denied that he 
had been victimized by propaganda, claiming that he had sought 
information on his own initiative and had reached his decision 
on his own. He deserted "through the underground" but Commented 
that 1t is possible to desert through the National Liberation 
Front in Vietnam. He is presently "reinforcing his political 
conscience and is finding reassurance." He claims that all 
deserters are not knowledgeable of or believers in the Marxist 
theory, maintaining that it is not necessary to be a Communist 
in order to hate "the capitalistic way, the American way, and 
the military way." 
3. GERSHADER is very sincere in his feelings. He is a 
pacifist who hates killing. He was open in stating that he 
was finding reassurance and support from the leftists who are 
teaching the deserters "about the world." He does not feel 
at home in Sweden and does not wish to remain there the rest 
of his life. He will return to the United States only if there 
is a general amnesty or after a general revolution. 
4. He attended helicopter school in February 1967.

The Ninth tlorld Youth Festival 
(28 July - 6 August 1968) 
1 SEP nC3 
1. The American contingent to the Ninth World Youth 
Festival (28 July - 6 August 1968)in Sofia, Bulgaria, com-
prised 85 delegates. A group of 10 delegates left New lork 
on 23 July aboard a Soviet Aeroflot plane, arriving in Sofia 
via Moscow. Twenty-one delegates left New York on 25 July 
aboard a Scandinavian Air Lines plane, changing in Copenhagen 
to a Bulgarian Air Lines flight, and reaching Sofia on 27 July. 
This charter flight was sponsored by the Du Bois Clubs o 
America:and was arranged by Euge 0' OURNOUR, aka Gene TOURNOR, 
of New lork City.ff 'The 45 other American delegates, primarily 
members of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and those 
opposing the war in Vietnam, arrived separately, either with 
student groups traveling in Europe or individually. Six 
American military deserters living in Sweden attended as guests 
of the Festival Committee and the Bulgarian Government, with 
all expenses paid by the Bulgarian Government. They were not 
considered part of the American delegation. 
2. The group of 21 was met at the Sofia airport by Jarvis 
TYNER, president of the Du Bois Clubs of America, and his 
assistant, Caroline BLACK, both of whom had gone to Sofia earlier 
to participate in Festival preparations. Student delegates from 
Uruguay were aboard the same plane.

3. Festival officials were disappointed that the 300 
expected delegates from the United States had not turned up, 
particularly in view of the fact that 400 had attended the 
affair in Helsinki. The officials were curious as to whether 
this indicated that the youth movement had lost support in 
the United States or whether it was becoming better organized 
and therefore more exclusive. TYNER explained that organization 
of the movement had improved and that standards were higher. 
No Festival applications had been sent to either Harvard or 
Stanford Universities, which had sent large contingents to 
previous Festivals, because many of,those from these schools 
had proved to be disruptive Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
plants. During a discussion of the youth movement in the 
United States with a Bulgarian Youth representative on 4 August, 
the disorganized state of the American youth movement was 
brought out, along with the competing roles of the SDS and the 
Du Bois Clubs for leadership of the socialist movement in the 
United States. Strategy and tactics of youth groups was also 
discussed. 
4. A meeting of the American delegation on the afternoon 
of 28 July was attended by about 65 persons and was primarily 
concerned with such administrative problems as issuance of meal 
tickets, issuance of Festival passes in exchange for passports, 
payment of fees by those arriving separately from the tour grou 
etc. Several were excluded from the delegation because theirfe

had not been paid. The meeting was chaired by Caroline BLACK, 
because TYNER was occupied with other Festival business. BLACK 
claimed that some reactionaries were present and expressed her 
fear that CIA people might also be present; for this reason, 
.1 
she would decide who would live in the housing area with the 
delegation. SDS delegates :most of whom had arrived separately, 
1 
challenged her from the floor, accusing her of being partial to 
Du Bois Club delegates. BLACK then labeled the SDS delegates 
racists who opposed both her and TYNER because they were black. 
S. No American delegates were accused openly of being CIA 
spies, although Du Bois Club literature from the University of 
Wisconsin and the Festival press organ emphasized that CIA was 
out to destroy the Festival. There was such a paranoid fear of 
CIA actions that late American arrivals were suspected of being 
with the CIA and were therefore not allowed to join the American 
delegation. One of these was a Quaker pacifist who requested 
housing with the delegation and was turned down by BLACK, who 
accused him of being from the CIA. 
6. Some bearded American hippies were prevented from 
entering Bulgaria and were forced to camp outside the country 
until they washed and shaved. American hippies and other similar 
types were reportedly being kept out of Bulgaria as an excuse 
for preventing unkempt Czech students from entering the country 
because it was feared that the Czech students would cause trouble 
at the Festival. The Bulgarian News Service released an English 
language item picturing the Czech students.

7. The press representative of Liberation News Service, 
Alan YOUNG, gave American delegates pins inscribed, "I am an 
AMLRICONG." Festival activities were also covered by Sally 
PEW, who represented American Documentary Films, a leftist 
front group in California. 
8. American delegates expressed their dissatisfaction 
on several occasions over the failure of TYNER and BLACK to 
provide adequate leadership. One of these occasions was an 
interdelegation meeting on 29 July, when the Americans were 
generally upset over the endless delays, over-all disorganization 
and long meaningless speeches, each of which had to be translated. 
TYNER's ineffectiveness as a speaker increased their irritation 
at this time. Another occasion was on the afternoon of 4 August 
during a meeting with the seven Bulgarian interpreters assigned 
to the delegation and a Bulgarian Youth representative to discuss 
post-Festival activities. No formal tour of Bulgaria had been 
arranged, although such a trip had been implied in the $82.50 
package deal for Americans attending the Festival. Each delegate 
had to make his own arrangements for the week between the closing 
of the Festival and the departure of the charter flight from 
Sofia on 14 August, and had to finance himself during this period. 
TYNER and BLACK maintained that there had been no promise of a 
week's tour of Bulgaria for the Du Bois Club members at no extra 
cost. The American delegates asserted that a great deal of time 
had been lost at the Festival due to the failure of TYNER and 
BLACK to make appropriate lans and arrangements in advance.

Most of the American delegates found the Festival generally 
successful because it had accomplished the aims for which 
it was created - "peace, solidarity, and friendship" - but 
claimed that this had been possible only through, the individual 
efforts of the delegates and not because of demonstrated abiliij 
on the part of the leaders. Some delegates, however, said that 
they did not feel that the Festival was woyth the $500 it had 
cost them. 
9. The Festival opened officially on 28 July and there was 
a parade of all delegations through Sofia that afternoon. It 
was dark when the parading elements entered the Nevski Stadium, 
which was packed with 75,000 people and fully equipped with 
modern lighting. Ceremonies, including dances and other spectacl 
by 17,000 Bulgarian students, lasted until midnight. Only the 
Soviet, Bulgarian, North Vietnamese, and American delegations 
received the "red card" treatment from the crowd. The American 
delegates had no flag, were poorly dressed, did not march in 
step, carried a small sign reading "USA-CAW," and, in general, 
made a poor showing, but were greeted enthusiastically when 
then they entered the stadium. There were cheers of "Kennedy, 
Kennedy." Bulgarians explained that this was because Kennedy 
was the only American political figure that the Bulgarian press 
had presented to the people in a sympathetic light. 
10. On 1 August 15 American delegates met with the U.S. 
military deserters living in Sweden who were attending the Festival. 
The,deserters were Bill JONES, who has been acting as spokesman,

Steve GERSHADER, Charles ONAN, John PICCIANO, Walter WOODS, 
and Nark SHAPIRO. David GOTTLIEB, press representative of the 
deserters, stated that no secrets would be revealed by the 
deserters and that they would only provide informai'ion normally 
given out at any press conference. Each deserter made a state-
ment explaining his situation and beliefs. This was followed 
by a short question and answer session. The deserters seemed to 
have their own individual psychological and behavioral problems. 
They appeared generally agreed that they had never felt so clear 
in their thinking; that they found it impossible to kill; were 
pacifists; believed that war in general was immoral and that 
American participation in the war in Vietnam was illegal; and 
that they had no immediate plans or goals but all wanted to return 
to the United States eventually, either under an amnesty or after 
a revolution. They maintained that they were mixed up in their 
minds at the time of induction into service but that this had 
ended with desertion and that they finally were able to see issues 
clearly for the first time. They were quite friendly and one of 
them spent the night with the American delegation'. During the 
meeting Marianne BALDWIN, one of the American delegates, seemed 
quite hostile and asked numerous questions of Walter WOODS. The 
deserters gave their address erican Deserters Committee, c/o

which was a tour of the Vinzavod, a wine-bottling plant outside

of Sofia, where the workers were most enthusiastic in explaining 
the plant and in hosting a banquet lavish with food and wine. 
Additional bottles of wine were presented to the Americans when 
they boarded the bus for the return to Sofia. Thee workers had 
contributed the money used to defray housing expenses for the 
American delegation. The other trip was a mountain-climbing 
expedition, with bag lunches eaten atop the mountain in the cold 
and a two-hour descent to the bus in a driving rain. 
12. Two members of the American delegation, Lonnie SCHLEIN 
and Laurie OLSON, who visited the Chinese Embassy in Sofia, were 
followed when they left by Bulgarian secret police who confis-
cated 'material picked up at the Embassy, including the complete 
works of Mao Tse-tung. No reason was given for the confiscation. 
13. None of the following were noted at the Festival: Joan 
BAEZ, Avery BRUNDAGE, Cassius CLAY, Stokely CARMICHAEL, the 
ROLLING STONES, CORE representatives, Louis VALDES' theater group, 
or outstanding black American athletes boycotting the Olympic 
Games. 
14. There were rumors-of deep-seated dissension at the 
international level. Some said that there was trouble because 
revolutionaries could not Ilk and argue as they wished and that 
the moderates were in control. Castro and Mao radicals found the 
Soviet brand of Communism too conservative and insufficiently 
revolutionary. They also classified the USSR as too capitalistic. 
The Yugoslav delegation left early. The Cuban delegation did not

arrive. There were two Canadian delegations, one of which was 
from the Province of Quebec. There were rumors of fighting 
within the West German delegation between members of Students 
For a Democratic Society and other students. Some of the 
Soviet 800-member delegation appeared fairly well along in year 
to be classified as students; these delegates were uniformly 
dressed and spoke English. 
15. Most delegations seemed so totally preoccupied with 
dissension within their ranks that they avoided contact with 
other delegations. Contacts between Americans and other 
delegates at the Festival were confined generally to exchanges 
of greetings, exchanges of addresses, presentation of pins or 
souvenirs, and the like - all on a more or less formal basis. 
There was little interdelegation contact between American and 
Soviet representatives and what little there was appeared to 
be accidental. There appeared to be little or no socializing 
among delegations, even though several ate at the same restaurants 
le. Delegates from North Vietnam were very popular and 
were cheered at parades and spectacles, but none spoke English 
so interpreters were required for all contacts, which were there-
fore maintained on a very formal and impersonal basis. The 3/ 
July visit of the Americans to the Vietnamese delegation involved 
numerous lengthy speeches by both sides, all of which had to be 
translated. Among those speaking were two girls, one of whom said 
that she had killed 18 Americans with 26 bullets and the other 
of whom claimed that she had been tortured by having acid applied

to her face and throat. Young Vietnamese, reported to be orphansi 
were toasted for their courage in facing life without their parents, 
who allegedly had been killed by napalm or other means of torture. 
Kendra ALEXANDER, of the American delegation, said that blacks and 
whites must join in opposing war and racism, both of which result 
from the evils of capitalism as it is found in the United States. 
The Vietnam Solidarity Center opened on 29 July to the accompaniment 
of long speeches and gift donations. The British delegation 
presented eight motor scooters and the Americans, two Nordmende 
(German) shortwave radios, one for North Vietnam and the other 
for the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam. 
Exhibits included parts of American aircraft said to have been 
shot down over North Vietnam and numerous propaganda photographs 
some depicting what appeared to be hard-working North Vietnamese 
and others showing troops said to be American pictured as engaging 
in various types of purported atrocities. Other photographs 
showed pointed bamboo stakes, barbed-wire traps, and booby traps. 
A propaganda film on the war was entirely in the Vietnamese 
language and was highly repetitious. The American delegation 
donated blood for North Vietnam on two occasions, 18 delegates 
on 29 July and 15 delegates on 5 August. 
17. A meeting with the West German delegation scheduled 
for 29 July never materialized. 
18. At a meeting of the Lao and American delegations, the 
Pathet Lao delegates presented rings allegedly made from aircraft 
claimed to have been shot down oyer Laos. The figure "700" on

fT 
the face of each ring reportedly represented the 700 American 
aircraft claimed destroyed. Many Americans discarded the rings 
subsequently as they maintained they found it distasteful to wear 
a portion of aircraft that reportedly had brought death to so 
many in Laos and North Vietnam. During this meeting TYNER said 
that the black people in the United States were facing the same 
struggle against white imperialists as the Pathet Lao and that 
the blacks were fighting for the same cause and the same goals as 
the Pathet Lao. 
19. All delegations were housed in the Garishka subdivision 
a new development that will be made available to the Bulgarian 
working class. There were 102 apartments in each building, fully 
equipped except for stoves. The apartment buildinse 
constructed and both workmanship and materials seemed low in 
quality. For the Festival, there were three beds in each bedroom 
four in each dining room, and one in each kitchen. Maid service 
was available during the Festival, as was free medical and dental 
care. A special post office was set up to handle mail for the 
delegation. Laundry was cheap and haircuts cost only $.25. The 
American, Australian, and Argentine delegations ate at a restaurar 
called Lebed on the Lake, five miles from the housing area. 
20. Currency controls were strictly enforced. There were 
no acts of hooliganism, there was no thievery, and there were 
no arrests. No peaceful protests were permitted so there was 
little occasion for the police to become active, but there was 
no evidence of heavy-handedness or brutality on the part of 
police.,

21. The Festival closed on the evening of 6 August with 
a huge demonstration in the stadium and prizes were awarded 
to various delegations. Most delegates began leaving on 7 
August, and only eight or nine members of the American delegation 
remained in Sofia after that date. In response to a Soviet 
request for a group of Du Bois Club members to visit the USSP, 
TYNER selected eight black delegates to tour the USSR for two 
or three weeks after the Festival. About 16 or 17 Americans 
flew to Prague for sightseeing before boarding the return 
charter flight from there on 15 August. Others went to the 
USSR or to various places in Europe before returning to the 
United States.

2. WOLFF speaks Lnglish quite well. He is a revolutionary 
whose position lies somewhere between that of Castro and that 
of Mao Tse-tung, and he is obviously hostile to the Soviet 
position. He was leader of the aborted anti-American demonstratio 
at the American Embassy in Sofia during the Ninth World Youth 
Festival (28 July - 6 August 1968.) He was quite bitter over 
the fact that the East German delegates had denounced him as 
a "fiscist Goebbels" and because so few Americans participated 
in the demonstration. 
3. WOLFF plans to arrive in the United States in September 
1968 to participate in a seminar at Columbia University sponsored 
by the SDS. His travel plans are indefinite, as are his funding 
arrangements and backing. He was hopeful of setting up other 
meetings in the United States during his visit. 
4. The SDS office seemed small, as did their budget. The 
office contained old wooden desks and old manual typewriters. 
All of the workers appeared to be absent on vacation.
