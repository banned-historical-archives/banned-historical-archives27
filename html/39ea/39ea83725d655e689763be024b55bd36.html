 Sino-Soviet Exchanges, 1969-84
 Impact of the Sino-Soviet Dispute
 The Sino-Soviet dispute emerged into full view in the
 1960s as relations steadily deteriorated from ideologi-
 cal bickering to armed clashes along the contested
 frontier; Sino-Soviet exchanges came to a nearly
 complete halt:
 ? By 1967 both sides had recalled their ambassadors;
 diplomatic relations were being conducted by
 charges d'affaires.
 ? During the period of 1967-69, government-
 organized demonstrations repeatedly besieged the
 other side's embassy.
 ? In 1966 China broke party ties.
 ? By 1967 media from both sides had ceased reporting
 on leaders' messages and receptions on national
 holidays.
 ? In 1967 cultural, scientific, sports, and other such
 exchanges ceased.
 ? Trade was still carried on, but the level fell rapidly.
 No trade talks were held from 1967 through 1969.
 ? Routine matters, such as the maintaining of naviga-
 tion markers and dredging of border rivers were also
 affected; China refused to send a delegation to an
 annual border-river navigation meeting in 1968.0
 Typifying the state of Sino-Soviet exchanges, Chinese
 leaders refused to talk with Premier Kosygin when he
 phoned on 21 March 1969, presumably to discuss the
 Sino-Soviet border clashes. Perhaps the only channel
 of communication that worked well at that time was
 the propaganda machines in Moscow and Beijing,
 which turned out lengthy daily diatribes.
 The border clashes in 1969 marked a major turning
 point in the worsening dispute. Each power increas-
 ingly saw the other as a major security problem and
 strengthened long-term diplomatic and defense strate-
 gies accordingly. The Soviet Union continued to
 expand and modernize its forces along the Sino-Soviet
 border and to adopt diplomatic initiatives-sometimes
 backed with offers of economic and military aid-
 designed to isolate China and curb its influence in
 China not only reoriented its defense policy but
 undertook a basic geopolitical realignment toward the
 West. As a major counterweight to Soviet power, the
 United States has loomed large in Chinese calcula-
 tions, establishing a compatibility of Chinese and US
 interests in checking the expansion of Soviet power.
 Overlapping strategic concerns remain at the core of
 the Sino-US reconciliation cemented by the 1972
 Shanghai Communique and the 1978 Joint Commu-
 nique establishing diplomatic relations.
 Although China and the Soviet Union agreed in late
 1969 to reduce the chances for military conflict along
 the frontier, to start talks on border problems, and to
 resume a modicum of governmental interchange, this
 did little to temper the strategic and political rivalry.
 Throughout the 1970s, China's firm demand for a
 pullback of Soviet forces from so-called disputed
 areas ' of the border impeded any significant improve-
 ments in the relationship.
 Triangular Politics
 Whatever accommodations have taken place over the
 past 15 years have largely reflected the determination
 on both sides to avoid military conflict, and to im-
 prove each country's tactical position within the US-
 Soviet-Chinese triangle.
 The Soviet Union has consistently promoted increased
 exchanges, largely to undercut perceived advantages
 the United States has derived from the Sino-Soviet
 ' "Disputed areas" refers to all territory Beijing claims Imperial        25X1
 and Soviet Russia occupied beyond the boundary lines set by the
 19th-century "unequal" treaties. The territory is estimated at about
 30,000 square kilometers-mainly in the Pamir Mountains in the
 west and involving several hundred disputed border-river islands,
 including Zhen Bao (Damansky Island), the site of the bloody
 clashes of March 1969, and Heixiazi (Big Ussuri Island), the large
 Soviet-held island at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers,
 immediately opposite the strategic Soviet city of Khabarovsk (see

 dispute and to persuade China to accept the territorial
 and military status quo in Asia. To retard Sino-US
 cooperation against them, the Soviets offered in the
 early 1970s to modify their territorial claims along
 the border, to sign nonaggression pacts and/or agree-
 ments prohibiting the use of force, to base Sino-Soviet
 relations on the five principles of peaceful coexistence,
 and to restore high-level official contact, including
 party ties, in the interest of common opposition to the
 United States.
 China largely ignored these offers. It agreed in 1970
 to restore ambassadorial relations and to resume
 normal trade talks, but otherwise rebuffed Soviet
 overtures on the grounds that they did not meet
 Beijing's demand for a Soviet withdrawal from dis-
 puted border areas. China focused instead on greater
 defense preparedness, diplomatic initiatives, and clos-
 er ties with the United States
 Weary of Chinese intransigence, Soviet leaders had
 decided by 1973 to await the death of their nemesis,
 Mao Zedong, then in declining health, before making
 new overtures to improve relations with China. When
 Mao died in September 1976, Moscow followed
 quickly with several gestures:
 ? Soviet media stopped criticizing China for four
 months.
 ? Brezhnev sent a Soviet party (CPSU) message of
 condolence on Mao's death-the first Soviet party
 message sent to China in a decade-followed by a
 CPSU message in October congratulating Hua
 Guofeng on his appointment as the new Chinese
 party chairman.
 ? Soviet media gave unusually prominent attention to
 China's National Day celebrations on 1 October
 1976.
 ? In late November the Soviets sent their chief negoti-
 ator, Deputy Foreign Minister Ilichev, back to
 China to resume the border talks after a hiatus of
 18 months.
 ? Privately, the Soviets offered to assist China in
 rebuilding factories destroyed in the massive North
 China earthquake of 1976.
 China again rebuffed the Soviets. In February 1978,
 Beijing added new public demands, calling for Soviet
 military withdrawal from Mongolia and the reduction
 of Soviet forces in the Far East. In June the border
 talks were suspended. In addition, China's leaders
 continued to seek closer political and economic ties
 with the United States, Japan, and other Western
 countries, called for a united front against "Soviet
 expansionism," and normalized relations with the
 United States. Beijing accelerated the improvement of
 its relations with the United States in an effort to
 temper the Soviet reaction to China's invasion of
 Vietnam.
 During the same period, the USSR stepped up mili-
 tary activity around China's periphery:
 ? In March 1978, Brezhnev and Defense Minister
 Ustinov toured the Soviet Far East and viewed a
 Soviet military exercise not far from China's border.
 ? Moscow increased support for Vietnam, signing a
 friendship treaty in November 1978 and giving
 large amounts of aid in 1979 and 1980.
 ? Just before the Chinese invasion of Vietnam, it
 became clear that the USSR had established a new
 Far East command, the first since 1954.
 ? During China's action against Vietnam, Soviet bor-
 der forces went on alert in an apparent effort to
 intimidate the Chinese.
 ? Finally, shortly after Chinese forces withdrew from
 Vietnam in March 1979, Moscow conducted-
 ahead of schedule-what the Chinese claimed was
 the largest military exercise ever held near the
 Chinese border. Two Soviet divisions, transferred to
 Mongolia for the exercise, stayed on after its conclu-
 sion.
 To deflect Soviet military pressure, China dropped its
 demands that Soviet troops withdraw from disputed
 border areas as a precondition for improved relations
 and called for unconditional talks to better Sino-
 Soviet ties. Suspecting China was trying to use the

 talks to drive a wedge between the USSR and Viet-
 nam, Moscow responded cautiously. Only one session
 was held in late 1979 before China suspended the
 talks following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in
 Recently Increased Exchanges
 As Sino-US differences over Taiwan and other issues
 reemerged in 1980-82, however, Chinese leaders be-
 gan to reassess their foreign policy strategy. Hoping to
 reduce tensions with the Soviets and increase China's
 room for maneuver in the strategic triangle, Beijing
 proclaimed an "independent" foreign policy and
 agreed in 1982 to open "consultative talks" with
 Moscow. Subsequently, China has accepted on a
 limited basis a number of longstanding Soviet offers
 for more bilateral exchanges, especially in sports,
 cultural, and economic areas. Soviet leaders, and to a
 much lesser degree Chinese officials, have highlighted
 these exchanges 2-unprecedented in the past 20
 years-as signs of improving relations.
 The rivalry between the two powers has not abated,
 however. Neither side gives any sign of a willingness
 to compromise on basic issues affecting their security
 and political interests in Asia. Moscow has repeatedly
 rejected China's conditions that call for the Soviet
 Union to:
 ? Withdraw from Afghanistan.
 ? Stop supporting Vietnam's occupation of
 Kampuchea.
 ? Reduce its forces along the Sino-Soviet border.
 ? Withdraw its troops from Mongolia. (u)
 In early 1983, the Chinese added that Soviet interme-
 diate-range SS-20 missiles deployed in the eastern
 USSR be included in any reduction of Soviet forces
 along the border.
 We do not anticipate that the recent increases in Sino-
 Soviet trade and other exchanges will develop into a
 broader detente. There are, however, a number of
 2 By late 1983, Beijing and Moscow had established separate
 forums for talks at the level of vice foreign minister to deal with
 bilateral relations and "global" issues. Vice foreign ministers also
 conducted talks on Sino-Soviet border questions, but those talks
 have not convened since 1978. Beijing and Moscow also held talks
 on bilateral trade, border-river navigation issues, border trade,
 exchanges of sports teams, tourist delegations, economists, students,
 developments we would look for as signals for such a
 basic change in Sino-Soviet relations:
 ? Holding regularly scheduled summit meetings.
 ? Reestablishing cooperative party ties.
 ? Chinese acceptance of Soviet proposals for nonuse
 of force, nonaggression, or Soviet territorial claims
 along the border.
 ? Soviet withdrawal of several divisions from Mongo-
 lia or along Sino-Soviet border, or proportionately
 large cutbacks in military support for Vietnam or
 Afghanistan.
 ? Soviet provision of large amounts (several hundred
 million dollars) of technical and economic aid to
 Chinese economic development.
 ? Muted Chinese opposition to obvious signs of Soviet
 expansion abroad or direct Chinese political collabo-
 ration with the USSR against US policies.
 The Sino-Soviet Border Talks, 1969-78
 The Sino-Soviet border talks-held at the deputy
 foreign minister level-were the main channel of
 official contact between the Soviet Union and China
 for nine years, until they were suspended indefinitely
 in mid-1978. Developments in the talks fall into three
 distinct phases-each demonstrating strikingly diver-
 gent Chinese and Soviet objectives.
 Soviet Proposals and Chinese Responses
 1969-73. The border talks were an outgrowth of the
 escalating frontier clashes in the spring and summer
 of 1969. Fearing a full-scale conflict, both sides
 agreed to start the talks in order to ease tensions. In
 doing so, the Soviet Union backed away from its
 initial contention that, since the existing border trea-
 ties were "valid," only "consultations" were needed to
 delineate some "ill-defined" sectors of the frontier.
 The Chinese, in turn, dropped several preconditions
 for negotiations only to table them again as demands
 when the talks began in October 1969. The Chinese
 wanted:
 ? Soviet acknowledgment that the border was based
 on "unequal" treaties forced on China by czarist
 Russia.

 Key Events in the Sino-Soviet Border Talks, 1969-78
 1969
 Soviet-Chinese forces clash along the border from
 March through August. Border talks begin in Octo-
 ber-bog down almost immediately over Beijing's
 demand that Moscow withdraw forces from Chinese-
 defined disputed areas along border. F__]
 Moscow proposes nonaggression pact, differentiation
 of disputed and nondisputed sectors of border, and
 improved diplomatic, trade, and other exchanges.
 1970
 Moscow states its willingness to accept main channel
 as boundary line along border rivers. Soviets with-
 draw troops from some border-river islandsF-I
 pact.
 1971
 Soviets propose agreement prohibiting the use of
 force; reaffirm willingness to accept main channel as
 boundary line, and indicate willingness to accept a
 new agreement covering entire border.
 ? The return "in principle" of nearly all disputed
 territory to China.
 ? The withdrawal of Soviet forces from all disputed
 territory.
 The agreement to start the talks was reached follow-
 ing a meeting in the drab halls of the old Beijing
 airport on 11 September 1969 between Chinese Pre-
 mier Zhou Enlai and Soviet Premier Kosygin, who
 was on his way home from Ho Chi Minh's funeral.
 According to East European officials, Kosygin pro-
 posed that both sides regulate border tensions, begin
 frontier negotiations, restore ambassadorial ties, and
 resume talks on bilateral trade.
 Technically, Beijing was willing to accept the boundary line of the
 "unequal" treaties once Moscow met these preconditions, but this
 would have given China control of "disputed territory" along the
 1972
 Moscow agrees to base Sino-Soviet relations on the
 Chinese initiated five principles of peaceful coexist-
 ence.
 Soviets offer long-term trade agreement, to resume
 deliveries of full sets of industrial equipment, and to
 renew scientific, technical, and cultural exchanges.
 1973
 Soviets reiterate offer on main channel as river
 boundary marker. Again offer a nonaggression pact.
 1973-78
 No progress in talks. Soviet negotiator only infre-
 quently in Beijing. Last meeting in June 1978-F
 1981-83
 Soviets call for revived border talks, propose "confi-
 dence-building measures" along the border, and show
 willingness to consider mutual troop withdrawals.
 According to Chinese accounts, later denied by the
 USSR, Zhou and Kosygin reached an "understand-
 ing" to withdraw forces from disputed areas along the
 frontier. Since the areas were then under Soviet
 control, the reported accord amounted to Moscow's
 agreeing to a unilateral Soviet troop withdrawal.
 China's demand that the Soviet Union implement the
 Zhou-Kosygin understanding and withdraw its troops
 from disputed areas, and the Soviet refusal to do so,
 subsequently not only blocked progress in the border
 negotiations but also served as a brake on any signifi-
 cant improvement in Sino-Soviet relations over the
 next 10 years.

 Between 1969 and 1973, Chinese and Soviet negotia-
 tors met frequently. In all, a Soviet deputy foreign
 minister spent 35 months at the talks in Beijing.
 Anxious to show forward movement in relations with
 both China and the United States at a time of
 perceived Soviet disadvantage in the US-Soviet-Chi-
 nese relationship, Moscow offered a series of propos-
 als designed to promote an accommodation. Several
 were timed to coincide with high-level Chinese delib-
 erations on foreign policy or Soviet negotiations with
 the United States on SALT and other questions.
 The most significant Soviet initiatives during this
 period include:
 ? The USSR proposed to limit forward patrolling and
 propaganda exchanges along the frontier. According
 to one account, the USSR took several of these steps
 in late 1969 and the Chinese reciprocated. Both
 sides:
 - Avoided forward patrolling that would dispute
 the lines of control then maintained by Soviet
 and Chinese border guards.
 - Consulted on frontier issues instead of resorting
 to force to resolve them.
 - Took into account the interests of the civilian
 population living along the border (for example,
 by allowing herders to follow their flocks across
 the border in seasonal migrations).
 - Stopped propaganda exchanges with loud-
 speakers along the frontier.
 ? Soviet troops were withdrawn from some disputed
 border-river islands such as Zhen Bao (Damansky)
 Island, site of the bloody clashes of March 1969.
 The pullback was reported to have taken place by
 February 1970.
 ? The Soviet Union privately indicated a willingness
 in January 1970 to accept the main channel, the
 "Thalweg Principle," as the boundary marker along
 the Amur and Ussuri Rivers. Moscow reiterated
 this position in early 1971 and again in March 1973.
 The Soviets had contended in 1969 that the border
 should run along the Chinese bank of these rivers.
 The new Soviet position, in effect, recognized Chi-
 na's claim to Zhen Bao (Damansky) and other
 disputed islands, with the notable exception of the
 strategically located Heixiazi (Big Ussuri) Island,
 opposite the Soviet city of Khabarovsk.
 ? Soviet propaganda attacks on China were cut back
 in late 1969 and early 1970.
 ? The Soviet Union reportedly offered to sign a
 nonaggression pact with China in late 1969. Varia-     25X1
 tions of this proposal were offered on 11 February
 and 8 July 1970, and in June 1973.
 ? According to diplomatic reports from Beijing that
 were later confirmed by Soviet and Chinese public
 statements, the USSR proposed a nonuse of force
 agreement with China on 15 January 1971. China
 refused on the grounds that such an accord would
 duplicate the existing 1950 Sino-Soviet treaty of
 alliance. Moscow then countered with an offer to
 add a protocol to the 1950 treaty, committing both
 sides to the nonuse of force and noninterference in
 border regions. China again refused, but offered one
 of its rare counterproposals-including provisions
 on nonuse of force in a new accord on maintaining
 the status quo along the border. The two sides then
 negotiated a mutually acceptable text only to have
 the whole exercise founder over China's insistence
 that the article on nonuse be tied to Soviet accept-
 ance of the Chinese concept of "disputed areas."
 ? The Soviet Union offered several times during the
 first four years of the border talks to restore ambas-
 sadorial relations, improve trade relations-includ-
 ing the sale of whole Soviet plants-and to resume
 scientific, technical, sports, and cultural exchanges.
 (Ambassadorial relations and annual trade agree-
 ments were resumed in 1970.)
 ? The USSR offered to base Sino-Soviet relations on
 the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence-a sig-
 nificant concession made public by Brezhnev in
 March 1972. In November 1970, China had de-
 clared that these principles should govern relations
 between all states, in sharp contrast to the Soviet

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/19: CIA-RDP85TOO31OR000100010003-2
 contention that relations between socialist states
 should be based on the principles of "proletarian
 internationalism." According to the Brezhnev doc-
 trine, Soviet "principles" of international relations
 also included the right and obligation to interfere in
 the affairs of a fraternal state that strayed too far
 from the socialist path. The Chinese principles of
 peaceful coexistence, however, emphatically prohib-
 ited such interference.
 ? The Soviet Union proposed summit meetings, joint
 Sino-Soviet action in support of Vietnam against the
 United States, and the restoration of Sino-Soviet
 party ties:
 On 8 July 1970, the USSR proposed summit-
 level talks to discuss a draft accord on mutual
 nonaggression that would include a ban on
 using nuclear weapons.
 In October 1969 and August 1970, Brezhnev
 publicly disclosed Soviet interest in renewed
 Sino-Soviet party ties and cooperation against
 the United States.
 China responded positively to only a few of these
 Soviet offers and made an occasional gesture on its
 own:
 ? It reciprocated Soviet efforts to reduce the chance of
 conflict by border patrols.
 ? It agreed in 1970 to restore ambassadorial relations
 and resume trade negotiations.
 ? It returned to the border-river navigation talks in
 1969, but nothing was accomplished.
 ? It matched Moscow's propaganda standdown for a
 few weeks in late 1969
 During the first two years of the border talks, Moscow
 asked that the sessions alternate between Moscow and
 Beijing or that they be downgraded to the ambassado-
 rial level. The Soviets may have hoped to use the
 veiled threat of downgrading the talks to prompt
 China to be more cooperative. Concerned about losing
 this "safety valve," China took steps to assure that the
 border talks continued as before. Most notably, Mao
 Zedong took a rare personal initiative in 1970 by
 asking a Soviet official at the May Day reception in
 Beijing when the head of the Soviet negotiating team
 would return to resume the border talks. By then, the
 talks had been in recess for several weeks amid
 reports of Soviet dissatisfaction with the lack of
 progress.
 July 1973-September 1976. After the summer of
 1973 until Mao's death in 1976, meetings became
 much less frequent and shorter. China's defense pro-
 gram, successful diplomatic offensive, and establish-
 ment of ties with the United States by the time of
 President Nixon's visit in February 1972 helped offset
 Soviet military and political pressure in Asia. Under
 these circumstances, China presumably judged that it
 had little need to accommodate the USSR. Seeing the
 futility of further gestures toward China at this time,
 Moscow decided to wait until its principal nemesis,
 Mao Zedong, left the scene, hoping new Chinese
 leaders would be more responsive to Soviet overtures.
 The chief Soviet negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister
 Ilichev, went back to Moscow in July 1973 saying that
 he would return to Beijing for only short periods
 unless there was a change in China's policy. China did
 not budge. The Chinese National Day message to the
 USSR on 6 November 1974 said:
 It is necessary first of all to conclude an agreement
 on mutual nonaggression for nonuse of force
 against one another, on maintaining the status quo
 on the border, on averting armed conflicts, and on
 the departure of the armed forces of both sides
 from disputed areas, and then to proceed toward
 the solution of the border question as a whole by
 the way of talks.
 Brezhnev replied on 26 November that China's pro-
 posal for a preliminary agreement was:
 Nothing more nor less than a demand for a
 withdrawal of Soviet Frontier Guards from a
 series of areas of our territory to which the
 Chinese have now decided to lay claim and have
 consequently begun to call 'disputed areas'

 Secret
 In June 1975, a Soviet Foreign Ministry China
 specialist, Mikhail Kapitsa, told the US Ambassador
 in Moscow that China had limited its demand for a
 withdrawal of Soviet troops to 20 kilometers from the
 border, but this was still unacceptable to the USSR.
 At the same time, Soviet commentator A. Bovin said
 flatly that the border talks were "deadlocked." F_
 September 1976-June 1978. After Mao's death, Mos-
 cow sent Ilichev back to Beijing on 27 November
 1976 for a stay of three months. He reiterated Soviet
 interest in a nonaggression or nonuse of force treaty
 and in improved bilateral exchanges. The talks ad-
 journed in February 1977 with Ilichev complaining
 about China's demands on the "unequal" treaties and
 the withdrawal of Soviet troops. A year later, Chinese
 Premier Hua Guofeng publicly reaffirmed Beijing's
 insistence on Soviet withdrawal from disputed areas.
 He added a new public demand that the USSR also
 withdraw its troops from Mongolia and reduce its
 forces along the Sino-Soviet border to the level of
 Khrushchev's time. Amid these bleak signs, Ilichev
 once again returned to Beijing on 26 April 1978. In
 May, Chinese Embassy officers in Moscow
 saw Ilichev's return as a
 "joke." In late June, Ilichev left Beijing conceding
 privately that the talks were "useless."
 Recent Developments. Although there have been no
 border talks since mid-1978, the USSR from time to
 time has shown interest in reviving them.' Official
 guidance issued in late 1982 said that Soviet Foreign
 Minister Gromyko, meeting Chinese Foreign Minister
 Huang Hua at Brezhnev's funeral in November 1982,
 indicated a Soviet willingness to withdraw some
 troops from along the Sino-Soviet border, while Deng
 Xiaoping told visiting Americans in December 1982
 that a Soviet troop pullback was possible during the
 near future. "Confidence-building measures," such as
 giving prior notification and sending observers to
 military exercises in the border regions, were also
 raised by the USSR,
 llichev, the chief Soviet negotiator during most of the border talks,
 was Moscow's chief negotiator at the 1979 deputy foreign minister
 Vice Foreign Minister Talks, 1979 and 1982-83
 As Sino-Soviet military tensions reached their highest
 point in 10 years following China's invasion of Viet-
 nam in February-March 1979, Beijing moved to ease
 the situation by calling for unconditional Sino-Soviet
 talks. The Chinese overture came in a backhanded     25X1
 way-contained in the 3 April 1979 formal announce-
 ment of China's intention to allow the Sino-Soviet
 treaty of alliance to lapse in 1980. Once the talks got
 under way in late September 1979, Beijing hewed to a
 tough line, insisting that the USSR remove "obsta-
 cles" to improved relations. The Chinese specifically
 demanded that Moscow:
 ? Reduce Soviet forces along the Chinese border to
 the level of the early 1960s.
 ? Withdraw Soviet troops from Mongolia.         25X1
 ? Cease Soviet support for Vietnam's occupation of
 Kampuchea.
 ? Work to resolve the Sino-Soviet border dispute.
 Moscow rejected the Chinese conditions, emphasizing
 that progress in the talks would depend on China and
 that improvement in Sino-Soviet relations would not    25X1
 occur at the expense of third countries. The Soviets   25X1
 also reportedly proposed a joint statement of opposi-
 tion to "hegemony," an end to Sino-Soviet polemics,                                                                              25X1
 regular Sino-Soviet meetings, including summit meet-
 ings, and expanded trade, technical, and cultural
 exchanges. Three months later, in January 1980,
 China officially suspended the talks because of the
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
 By mid-1982, however, China changed tack again-
 this time adopting a much more flexible attitude
 toward vice-ministerial talks with Moscow. And, un-
 like Beijing's previous strict insistence on restricting
 Sino-Soviet exchanges, the Chinese agreed to expand
 contacts in such areas as trade, cultural, and sports
 exchanges while continuing to insist that normalizing
 relations would depend on Soviet concessions in the
 security sphere.

 Key Events in Vice Foreign Minister Talks
 April 1979
 China proposes unconditional talks on improving
 Sino-Soviet relations.
 September-November 1979
 Sino-Soviet talks at vice foreign minister level held in
 Moscow. No progress reported as China insists Sovi-
 ets address "obstacles" to improved relations con-
 cerning Mongolia and Vietnam. Soviets refuse to
 normalize Sino-Soviet relations at expense of third
 countries.
 January 1980
 Beijing suspends Sino-Soviet talks on account of
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
 October 1982
 "Discussions" between Vice Foreign Ministers Qian
 and Ilichev on normalizing Sino-Soviet relations held
 in Beijing. China stresses three "obstacles''-de-
 mands withdrawal of Soviet forces from Sino-Soviet
 and Sino-Mongolian borders, end of Soviet support
 for Vietnam in Kampuchea, withdrawal of Soviet
 troops from Afghanistan.
 This adjustment paralleled China's new emphasis on
 an "independent" foreign policy-an attempt to rely
 less explicitly on the United States as a strategic
 counterweight to Soviet power and more on diplomacy
 as a tool to counter Soviet threats to China's security.
 It was more tactical than strategic in nature, reflect-
 ing the influence of several factors:
 ? China had become increasingly dissatisfied with US
 policies, especially regarding Taiwan, and presum-
 ably judged that reopening Sino-Soviet talks would
 prompt US leaders to pay more attention to Chinese
 interests.
 ? China also saw the Soviet Union bogged down with
 serious foreign and domestic problems--including
 leadership succession-that temporarily reduced the
 likelihood of a Soviet attack and possibly increased
 chances for Soviet concessions.
 March 1983
 Round two of Qian-Ilichev talks. Detailed discus-
 sions regarding Soviet troops in Asia but no accord
 reached. Agreements reached on increased trade,
 revived student exchange.
 September 1983
 Sino-Soviet discussions on "international issues" be-
 gin in Beijing between Vice Foreign Ministers Qian
 and Kapitsa. Little of substance accomplished except
 that Qian agrees to continue the talks later in
 Moscow.
 October 1983
 Round three of Qian-Ilichev talks. Soviets offer
 "condence-building measures" along the border,
 suggest raising talks to foreign minister level, propose
 22 specific scientific or cultural exchanges. Expanded
 barter trade along the border is discussed. Agree that
 the talks will resume in March 1984
 ? Beijing had decided to give more priority to econom-
 ic over military modernization. As a result, China
 was inclined to emphasize political negotiations, in
 tandem with a slow but steady military buildup, to
 deal with the Soviet threat.
 ? Close association with the United States was ham-
 pering China's ability to increase its influence with
 Third World countries and so-called progressive
 political parties that are traditionally suspicious of
 the United States.
 Anxious to exploit an opportunity to drive a wedge
 between Beijing and Washington, the USSR offered
 to reopen talks and reduced criticism of Chinese
 policy.

 occurred along two tracks.
 Qian-Ilichev Talks
 The first involves talks between Chinese Vice Foreign
 Minister Qian Qichen and Soviet Vice Foreign Minis-
 ter Ilichev, a veteran of the Sino-Soviet border talks
 and Sino-Soviet talks of 1979. The first round oc-
 curred in Beijing in October 1982, followed by rounds
 in Moscow in March 1983, and in Beijing the follow-
 ing October
 The Chinese have characterized these sessions as
 "consultations." As best we can determine, they have
 firmly reiterated their preconditions for normalizing
 Sino-Soviet relations:
 ? Withdraw Soviet forces from along the Sino-Soviet
 border and Mongolia. Since 1983, this has included
 Soviet SS-20 missiles in Asia.
 ? End Soviet support for Vietnam's occupation of
 Kampuchea.
 ? Withdraw Soviet forces from Afghanistan.
 The Soviets, in turn, have reiterated their refusal to
 discuss matters involving third countries. Moscow has
 tried to encourage forward movement-thus far with-
 out success-through proposals on a nonaggression
 pact, mutual force reductions along the border, and
 so-called confidence-building measures involving prior
 notification of military exercises and troop movements
 near the frontier.
 The agreements reached as a result of these meetings
 have been in nonpolitical areas. For example, both
 sides agreed in principle during the October 1983
 talks to increase bilateral trade in 1984 and to
 increase student, sports, and cultural exchanges. In
 addition, the Chinese accepted a Soviet offer to send
 technicians to help renovate a few Soviet-equipped
 industrial plants in China.
 Kapitsa-Qian Talks
 In September 1983 Soviet Vice Foreign Minister
 Kapitsa, a leading Soviet China specialist, paid an
 official visit to Beijing to try to open a separate
 channel for talks on "international issues"-perhaps
 in order to accommodate China's demand that issues
 regarding Mongolia, Indochina, and Afghanistan be
 discussed. He met twice with Vice Foreign Minister
 Qian Qichen and once with Foreign Minister Wu
 Xueqian, reportedly to exchange views on recent       25X1
 developments in the Middle East, Central America,
 the Indian Ocean, Indochina, and on disarmament,
 including the deployment of SS-20s in Asia. He and
 the Chinese also discussed expanding trade and stu-
 dent exchanges.
 Kapitsa had been trying to get an official invitation to
 China for three years but had only been able to travel
 there in 1980, 1981, and 1982 as a "guest" of the     25X1
 Soviet Embassy. The 1983 visit had been scheduled
 originally for May, but was reportedly canceled by
 China in April amid a flurry of sharp Sino-Soviet
 media exchanges regarding Sino-Vietnamese military
 clashes at that time. The Chinese finally agreed in
 July to allow Kapitsa to come, this time as an "official
 guest."
 Perhaps the most significant result of the September
 trip was China's agreement to send Qian to Moscow
 for followup talks at a later date-allowing Kapitsa to
 say as he left Beijing that the two sides had "opened a
 new channel of contact." Coming on the eve of
 Secretary of Defense Weinberger's visit to Beijing,
 both the Soviets and the Chinese apparently hoped to25X1
 use this agreement to their advantage in jockeying for
 position within the great-power triangle.
 Since late 1969 the Soviets and Chinese have adopted
 measures to prevent clashes by border patrols. As a
 result, there have been no major clashes and only a
 few publicized incidents over the past 15 years.
 The most dramatic incident occurred in March 1974
 when the Chinese arrested and detained three mem-   25X1
 bers of a Soviet helicopter crew that made a forced
 landing in Xinjiang (see figure 1). The Chinese did not
 release the crew and the helicopter until 21 months
 later.

 As military tensions continued to build between the
 two sides in 1978 and early 1979, another incident
 occurred in July 1979 along the Xinjiang and Ka-
 zakhstan frontier. Soviet forces captured and detained
 a Chinese veterinarian. Seven months later, the
 USSR released him--on 14 February 1980, the 30th
 anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet alliance.
 Beijing responded negatively, organizing a rally in
 Xinjiang to protest the border incident. An incident
 also took place along the Soviet border with Inner
 Mongolia in October 1980.
 Subsequently, China held well-publicized military
 exercises in 1981 and 1982 in regions fairly near the
 frontier. These exercises were designed to demon-
 strate Chinese military preparedness. The Chinese
 also conducted a large military exercise in western
 China in September 1983, but did not publicize the

 not responded positively to these overtures.
 Border-River Navigation Talks
 The Sino-Soviet agreement on the Navigation and
 Construction of the Boundary Waterways, signed in
 Harbin in 1951, established a Sino-Soviet Joint Navi-
 gation Commission to deal with technical questions

 concerning river traffic. The commission has met
 most years, alternately in China and the USSR.[
 The Sino-Soviet dispute began to affect navigation
 cooperation in the 1960s. As early as 1964, the USSR
 began requiring Chinese boats to get approval from
 Soviet authorities before going to the confluence of
 the Amur and Ussuri Rivers (see figure 3). On 30
 April 1965, the Chinese implemented regulations
 prohibiting Soviet vessels from loading or unloading
 people and goods without an inspection. On 19 April
 1966, China adopted further measures, giving Chi-
 nese officials the right to board Soviet ships in
 Chinese waters and placed a number of new restric-
 tions on Soviet vessels.
 The Soviets in 1967 closed the Amur-Ussuri conflu-
 ence to Chinese boats, forcing China to use the
 Kazakevich Channel instead, which the USSR
 claimed marked the border line. The channel was
 more shallow than the confluence and froze earlier in
 the fall.
 During the 14th annual meeting of the Navigation
 Talks in July 1967, China raised territorial questions,
 but the Soviet delegate protested and the Chinese
 delegation walked out. China did not send a delega-
 tion to the next meeting of the commission, scheduled
 for May 1968, and broke off informal consultations
 between local Chinese and Soviet officials on changes
 in the course of the rivers and other navigational
 matters.
 China agreed to resume the Navigation Talks in June
 1969 after a two-year hiatus, but China continued to
 raise territorial questions, which the USSR judged
 inappropriate. The commission did not meet in 1975
 or 1976. Meanwhile, the Kazakevich Channel began
 to silt up by 1974. The Soviets accused China of
 blocking Soviet dredging operations. In May 1974 the
 USSR offered to allow the Chinese access again to
 the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri, provided that
 China respected the Soviets' "sovereign rights." The
 USSR also suggested the creation of a joint Sino-
 Soviet project to dredge the Kazakevich Channel.
 China accused Moscow of "blackmail" and rejected
 the Soviet proposals.
 In 1977, the Chinese called for a resumption of
 navigation talks, and the 20th annual session was held
 from 27 July to 6 October 1977. Chinese media
 reported for the first time since the 1960s that
 technical agreements were reached.
 understanding had been reached, allowing Chinese
 boats to use the confluence when the Kazakevich
 Channel was unnavigable, provided Soviet authorities
 were "informed."
 Complaints about minor navigational infractions and
 incidents have persisted in recent years, but exchanges
 between the two sides have become more cordial.
 Terse Chinese announcements of the annual Naviga-
 tion Commission meetings have also been more posi-
 tive in tone, stating without further explanation that a
 "larger" area of agreement has been reached than in
 the past.
 Border Railway Developments
 In August 1978, Chinese and Soviet negotiators met
 at Moscow's initiative in a vain effort to set an agenda
 for renewed meetings of the Sino-Soviet Joint Rail-
 way Commission, moribund since the early 1960s.
 Three years later, Beijing announced in April 1981
 the signing of a protocol on railway transit, which
 Chinese officials privately said covered only "techni-
 cal discussions." A more important railway agree-
 ment was reached as part of the 1982 Sino-Soviet
 trade talks, allowing containerized Chinese goods to
 travel to markets in Europe and the Middle East via
 the Trans-Siberian Railroad. A Chinese accord on
 rail transhipment with Mongolia was reached in
 September 1983.
 Border Trade
 Revived Sino-Soviet interest in border trade surfaced
 in April 1982 when Beijing reported that it had
 exchanged notes on frontier trade with the USSR.
 Moscow reported in November that informal border
 trade talks had been held in Khabarovsk and that
 state bank officials of the two sides had reached
 agreement in December on procedures for settling
 border trade accounts. In April 1983, a protocol was
 signed after the first formal meeting on Sino-Soviet

 Summit Meetings and Interchanges
 Between High-Level Officials
 No top Soviet leader has visited Beijing since Premier
 Kosygin's impromptu meeting with Zhou Enlai at the
 Beijing airport in September 1969. Nor has any top
 Chinese party or government leader visited Moscow
 since Zhou traveled there in November 1964. Indeed,
 the only senior Chinese officials to pay an official visit
 to the Soviet Union in recent years were Foreign
 Minister Huang Hua in November 1982 for Brezh-
 nev's funeral and Vice Premier Wan Li in February
 1984 for Andropov's funeral-the first such higher
 level visits by Chinese officials in almost 20 years. F-

 years.

 Trade Relations, and People-to-People
 and Other Exchanges
 Sino-Soviet trade dropped sharply in value during the
 1960s from a high point of $2 billion in 1959 to a low
 of $47 million in 1970. No Sino-Soviet trade agree-
 ments were signed during 1967-69 (see table)
 After a new Sino-Soviet trade agreement was negoti-
 ated in November 1970, trade rose to $154 million the
 following year. Since then, annual trade agreements
 have been negotiated. The value of trade has fluctuat-
 ed, reaching $524 million in 1980, but declining to
 $248 million in 1981. Sino-Soviet trade rose again to
 $308 million in 1982
 Trade doubled in 1983 and is scheduled to increase to
 a level of $1.2 billion in 1984. Even with recent
 increases, China's trade with the Soviet Union in
 1984 will represent only about 2 percent of China's
 total trade, and a much smaller share of Soviet trade.
 Indeed, China transacts about as much trade with
 Romania as it does with the USSR.
 The bulk of Soviet deliveries have been machinery
 and transport equipment, with steel products and
 timber making up much of the remainder. In ex-
 change, China has supplied minerals, nonferrous met-
 al ores (including tungsten and tin), textiles, and
 foodstuffs for the Soviet Far East.

 cultural and scientific areas. Sino-Soviet trade in-
 creases from $248 million in 1981 to a projected $1.2
 billion in 1984.
 Soviet aircraft, electrical generating equipment, and
 trucks were major export items during the 1970s. The
 USSR also provided general machinery and spare
 parts for China's Soviet-designed industry. The air-
 craft were primarily turboprop medium transports
 and helicopters. China imported long-range IL-62 jets
 in 1971 and 1972 but was unhappy with their per-
 formance. For longer range jet aircraft and helicop-
 ters, the Chinese turned to the United States and
 West European suppliers. Beginning in 1971, the
 Chinese imported over a dozen Soviet 100,000- to
 200,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators. Soviet
 technicians installed these units, one of the few

 instances of Soviet technical presence in China since
 the break in Soviet assistance to China in 1960. In
 1983, the Soviet Union and China agreed that Soviet
 experts would travel to China to study remodeling a
 few Chinese factories containing equipment supplied

 From the late 1960s until the late 1970s, sports,
 cultural, educational, and social exchanges were a
 rarity. But, over the past six years and especially since
 late 1981, when Beijing decided to broaden its dia-
 logue with Moscow, such exchanges have expanded
 steadily.
 The Soviets, of course, have long advocated these
 kinds of contacts, ostensibly because they help to
 improve the atmospherics in the relationship. But the
 Chinese refused to respond to these overtures until
 after Mao's death. The Chinese Foreign Minister, for
 example, attended the Soviet National Day reception
 in Beijing in 1977 for the first time in 10 years, and in
 1978 the Chinese Sino-Soviet Friendship Society sent
 its first National Day greetings to the USSR since
 1965
 Sports and cultural exchanges have picked up espe-
 cially over the past few years:
 ? Chinese gymnasts in Moscow for an international
 meet in November 1981 were noted for the first
 time in over 10 years being feted by the Sino-Soviet
 Friendship Society.
 ? In June 1982, Pravda reported a Soviet track team
 visited China.
 ? During 1983, tourism delegations representing the
 Chinese and Soviet Friendship Associations ex-
 changed visits, and China participated for the first
 time in the Moscow Book Fair and Film Festival.F_
 As a result of the Sino-Soviet vice-foreign-ministers'
 talks, an agreement was reached in 1983 to resume
 student exchanges involving an estimated 200 stu-
 dents in all. The Soviets subsequently proposed 22

 Key Events Regarding Polemic Restraint
 Similarly, the Soviets made a strong pitch to China to
 join them on the basis of "proletarian international-
 ism" in support of the Vietnamese, following US-
 backed incursions into Cambodia and Laos in 1970-
 71. More recently, the Soviets have tried to generate
 concern in China over the US military buildup in East
 Asia and closer political and possible security cooper-
 ation among the United States, Japan, and South
 Korea, implying that this "alliance" is aimed at China
 The Chinese have been much more flexible in han-
 dling their relations over the past few years with other
 Communist parties once considered too "revisionist"
 or "pro-Soviet"-including ruling parties in Eastern
 Europe. In an interview with correspondents accom-
 panying French party chief Marchais on a visit to
 China in October 1982, Communist Party General
 Secretary Hu Yaobang defined Beijing's new ecu-
 menical approach to party-to-party relations. He said
 China was ready to establish friendly relations with
 "any party, whether a workers' party, Communist
 party, or nationalist party," as long as it abides by the
 cardinal principle of noninterference in other parties'
 internal affairs.
 Chinese leaders also moved to explore possible re-
 sumed party ties with Soviet Bloc nations. In June
 1983, Premier Zhao Ziyang publicly affirmed that
 China views them as "socialist." The impediment now
 seems to rest more with the East Europeans, who are
 reluctant to get out in front of the USSR and who
 insist that China first restore party ties with Moscow.

 name. The Soviets showed longer forebearance, not
 renewing high-level attacks on China until March
 1970.
 Chinese media attacks on the Soviets became espe-
 cially virulent in 1974 and 1975, because of a Chinese

 After the death of Mao, Soviet media muted anti-
 Chinese polemics for several months. China also toned
 down its anti-Soviet diatribes for a few weeks, until
 Chinese Vice Premier Li Xiannian revived Chinese
 attacks by accusing the USSR of trying to create a
 "false impression" of relaxation in Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions.
 The start of Sino-Soviet negotiations in 1979 on
 normalizing relations did not result in any significant
 reduction in polemics by either side. Moscow's failure
 to reduce media attacks was particularly noteworthy,
 given the Soviets' previous efforts to improve the
 atmosphere in Sino-Soviet relations at the start of the
 border talks in 1969, after Mao's death in 1976, and
 during the Sino-Soviet discussions of 1982-83 by
 toning down their propaganda. Moscow was particu-
 larly wary of China's intentions in the 1979 talks,
 coming as they did in the wake of Beijing's announced
 decision to terminate the Sino-Soviet alliance and
 China's military incursion into Vietnam.
 More recently, Moscow followed Brezhnev's call in
 March 1982 for improved relations with China with a
 halt in most authoritative Soviet statements critical of
 China. When Sino-Soviet discussions resumed in Oc-
 tober 1982, Soviet media cut back sharply on criti-
 cism of China. And they have remained restrained on
 this subject, although occasional polemic exchanges
 marked Sino-Soviet coverage at the time of Premier
 Zhao Ziyang's visit to the United States in January
 1984. Moscow has continued to be critical of China
 through the Soviet-based clandestine radio, Ba Yi.
 First heard in 1979, the radio claims to reflect the
 views of Chinese military personnel critical of the
 more pro-West orientation of recent Chinese policies.
 China, for its part, has continued criticism of Soviet
 foreign policy, although past attention to Soviet "revi-
 sionist" internal policies has all but disappeared since
 China's own economic policies have been significantly
 changed after Mao's death.
