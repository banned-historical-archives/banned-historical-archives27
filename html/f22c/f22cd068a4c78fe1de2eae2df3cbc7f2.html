 An Historical Perspective on the Senkaku Islands Dispute
 The recent incursions of some 200 Chinese fishing
 boats into Japanese-claimed waters off the Senkaku
 Islands in the East China Sea have further delayed the
 resumption of negotiations on the long-pending Sino-Japa-
 nese peace and friendship treaty.   The Japanese claim to
 the Senkakus was virtually uncontested until 1968 when a
 UN survey suggested that oil deposits might be found in
 the vicinity.   Since then, Taiwan and subsequently China
 have claimed the islands.
 Latest Incident
 The incursions by Chinese fishing boats began on
 12 April and ended two weeks later.   Peking has claimed
 that the incursions were "accidental;" according to the
 Chinese, the fishermen strayed into the area as they
 chased filefish--a species the Japanese do not catch.
 Chinese officials also pointed out that when their boats
 had fished near the Senkakus in 1977, Tokyo had not ob-
 jected and that the recent incident could have been
 resolved through normal diplomatic channels.
 Notwithstanding Peking's explanations, the incident
 stirred a strong reaction in Tokyo.  Aside from gener-
 ating strong domestic support for Tokyo's protest of the
 incursions, it has raised questions concerning Peking's
 motives and tactics.  Demands by Japanese opponents of
 the peace and friendship treaty that the Senkaku terri-
 torial dispute be settled before resuming negotiations*
 reportedly prompted the Chinese to reassert their claim
 to the islands.   In any case, the incursions have slowed
 movement on the treaty for the time being.   The Chinese
 action may also affect the course of pending legislation
 in the Japanese Diet for the implementation of the
 Japan - South Korea Continental Shelf Agreement, which
 *This demand conflicts with an earlier understanding reached by
 Japan and China that the territorial issue would be treated
 separately from the treaty.

 deals with development of oil resources in another area
 claimed by China.
 Physical Setting
 The Senkaku Islands--to the Chinese, the Tiao-yu
 Tai--comprise a chain of eight uninhabited islets about
 200 nautical miles from China, 100 nautical miles from
 Taiwan, and 80 nautical miles from the nearest inhabited
 island in the Ryukyu chain.  The Senkakus are commonly
 considered part of the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa.
 From evidence collected in a 1969 Japanese geological
 survey, there is little doubt that the islets are also
 part of the continental shelf.
 There is a submarine trench about 40 nautical miles
 southeast of the islands separating the Senkakus and the
 East China Sea continental shelf from the Ryukyu Islands.
 This trench provides the basis for the Chinese claim
 that the Senkakus are physically detached from the
 Ryukyu chain.
 Japan:   In 1895,  the Japanese Government installed
 markers on the islands signifying that they belonged to
 Okinawa and proclaimed the Senkakus as Japanese terri-
 tory.                     Four of the islands were then leased for 30 years
 to Japanese farmers.       Tokyo alleges that it conducted
 several investigations of the islands in order to con-
 firm that they were uninhabited and outside Chinese
 authority.
 After World War II, the Ryukyus were placed under
 US administration; they were returned to Japan in 1972
 when the US relinquished its administrative rights to
 the area.   Since then, the Japanese Maritime Safety
 Agency has patrolled the area routinely.
 Taiwan:  Taiwanese fishermen provided the only
 Taiwanese contact with the Senkakus before 1969, when
 the Japanese survey confirmed the findings of the UN
 team.  The Taiwanese have occasionally fished for bonito

 and shellfish in the waters near the Senkaku Islands;
 for their part,  Japanese fishermen seldom operate there
 because the winds and currents are largely unfavorable.
 The Taiwanese have also searched the islets for eggs,
 feathers,  turtle shells,  and guano.   In July 1969, Taiwan
 simultaneously granted a concession to an American oil
 firm to explore the area around the Senkakus for oil and
 informally disputed the Japanese claim to the islands.
 In doing so,  Taipei based its case on the San Francisco
 Peace Treaty of 1952, which limited Japan's sovereignty
 to the four main Japanese islands.
 In 1971,  the Nationalist government took an even
 stronger position by publicly claiming sovereignty over
 the Senkaku Islands.   Taiwan also requested that the US
 "respect the sovereign rights of the Republic of China
 over the Tiao-yu Tai islets and restore them to the Gov-
 ernment of the Republic of China when the US occupation
 of the Ryukyu Islands terminates."
 China:   China made no significant public statement
 concerning the islands or the continental shelf when the
 possibility of oil deposits in the area prompted the
 dispute between Japan and Taiwan.   In the fall of 1970,
 however, Peking attacked business efforts in Tokyo,
 Taipei, and Seoul to foster cooperation in the develop-
 ment of the area.   Subsequently,  in a 30 December 1971
 statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared that
 the Senkakus have been an inseparable part of Chinese
 territory since ancient times, citing among other things,
 Ming dynasty documents of 1403 that supposedly mention
 the islands.   When Okinawa reverted to Japan in 1972,
 Peking once again proclaimed its sovereignty over the
 _slands.
 China's public claims to the Senkakus were motivated
 by what was considered to be a dangerous foreign in-
 fringement of Peking's territorial rights.   China may
 also have feared that Japanese-Taiwanese cooperation in
 developing the continental shelf's oil resources would
 strengthen Tokyo's interest and influence in Taipei,
 thus complicating the ultimate settlement of the Taiwan
 problem.   (SECRET NOFORN-NOCONTRACT-ORCON)

 Burma:   Disenchantment with China
 The Burmese Government reportedly has presented a
 sharp note to the Chinese Ambassador in Rangoon protest-
 ing Chinese backing of the approximately 10,000 Burmese
 Communist insurgents in northeast Burma along the Chinese
 border.  Although China's direct involvement in the in-
 surgency has been reduced since the early 1970s,  Rangoon
 has become increasingly frustrated over its inability to
 persuade China to end its support for the insurgents.
 The reported protest may stem from President Ne Win's
 outrage over an upsurge in the insurgency immediately
 following Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's visit
 to Rangoon early this year.  While there is no evidence
 that the Chinese were responsible for the stepped-up
 rebel activity, Ne Win may have interpreted it as a par-
 ticularly gratuitous show of Chinese insensitivity to
 Burmese concerns.  I
 Burmese are prepared to publicize testimony from 82
 Chinese troops captured in counterinsurgency operations
 if the Chinese do not give some assurance of cutting back
 their support.
 We have no confirmation of the protest,  and such a
 forceful and direct approach would be out of character
 for Burma.   Anxious not to antagonize its powerful north-
 ern neighbor, it has until now been notably oblique in
 raising the matter and patient with Chinese evasiveness.
 Ne Win has tried without success to draw out the Chinese
 on the subject in his repeated trips to Peking.   He also
 hoped that he could work out a solution with Teng, and
 his disappointment on this score may have prompted him
 to order a change in diplomatic tactics.
 A protest would be in line with other indications
 of Rangoon's downgrading of its relations with China.
 Recently Burma named a junior diplomat as new Ambassador
 to China and published unusual if not unprecedented crit-
 icism of China in its party journal.  At the same time,
 Burma is showing signs of greater openness toward its

 non-Communist neighbors and the US.   Burmese diplomats
 have also reportedly been instructed to sound out US
 officials on a visit by Ne Win.
 Despite its annoyance, it is unlikely that Burma
 would risk provoking China by giving heavy play either
 to its protest or to the statements of Chinese prisoners
 it claims to hold.   In the absence of sustained publicity
 from Rangoon,  Peking will probably respond by pigeonhol-
 ing the Burmese protest.   (SECRET NOFORN-ORCON)

 Burma:      Strains with Bangladesh
 Burma's efforts to root out illegal residents in
 Arakan State along the Bangladesh border have prompted a
 flow of refugees into Bangladesh that has complicated
 bilateral relations and could increase tensions.
 In February, Rangoon moved to enforce immigration
 laws against Arakan State residents of Bangladesh origin.
 Burma claims there are 75,000 illegal residents in the
 state,  about one-half of them recent arrivals.   The high-
 handed manner of some of the 200 immigration officers
 sent into the area apparently prompted the flight of up
 to 20,000 refugees into Bangladesh by late last week,
 and the press has reported that the flow increased over
 the weekend.
 The Bangladeshi press and government claim there
 have been at least four incidents of firing between
 Burmese and Bangladeshi forces.  During one operation,
 Burmese troops reportedly crossed the border and burned
 three Bangladesh villages.   Rangoon has expressed regret
 for the incident and promised compensation.   Bangladeshi
 officials accept Burma's right to enforce its immigration
 controls, but--overwhelmed with refugees--have urged
 Rangoon to suspend the measures that have prompted the
 flow of migrants.
 There has long been a drift of Bangladeshis across
 the border into underpopulated Arakan.   Several hundred
 thousand Bangladeshis live in Arakan and outnumber the
 Buddhist Burmese in some areas.   Rangoon sees illegal
 immigration from Bangladesh as adding to existing Muslim
 disaffection and separatist tendencies in the remote state.
 Alert to Bangladeshi mischiefmaking among Arakanese
 Muslims, Rangoon expelled the Bangladeshi military at-
 tache last year for alleged involvement with separatists.
 Although Rangoon has accepted a replacement, it remains
 concerned over subversion among the large alien minority.

 There has been an exchange of official delegations
 to discuss the problem, and another round of talks is
 planned for this week.   Bogged down with insurgencies
 in all its other border areas, Rangoon would presumably
 not want to inflame the situation along the Bangladeshi
 border.   It is also concerned over possible international
 Islamic criticism of Burma's treatment of its Muslim
 minority.   Bangladesh apparently did not raise the issue
 at the international Islamic conference in Guinea last
 week, but the Bangladeshi press has charged the Burmese
 military with atrocities against the refugees.   The
 government has told foreign diplomats in Dacca that the
 press reports are "generally accurate."  Although neither
 side wants to push the situation to a confrontation,
 Rangoon's determination to rid itself of unwanted
 aliens--along with Dacca's compulsion to support its
 ethnic kin--seems to rule out an easy solution.   (SECRET

 South Korea:   Cautious Import Liberalization Policy
 South Korea, which had a half-billion-dollar trade
 surplus with the United States last year, is cautiously
 liberalizing its restrictive import policy.  A five-year
 program, announced on 15 April, will remove curbs on 321
 commodities by 1982.   This follows an easing of barriers
 on almost 200 items late last year.   Commodities were
 carefully selected for liberalization; many are already
 freely imported in practice, and others are not competi-
 tive on the Korean market.
 Taken together, the liberalization measures should
 result in about $700 million in additional imports in
 1978, mainly industrial raw materials and capital equip-
 ment.   Japan stands to benefit most from the changes,
 although Seoul is encouraging increased purchases from
 US and West European suppliers.
 Background
 Since assuming power in 1961 the Pak Chong-hui gov-
 ernment has maintained a wide array of nontariff import
 barriers to protect domestic industries and keep out non-
 essential goods.   The semiannual trade plan with its list
 of banned and restricted items is the most effective
 barrier.   Seoul also employs an export-import link sys-
 tem, end user requirements, and import deposit require-
 ments to restrict the inflow of foreign goods.
 The Push for Liberalization
 A dramatic improvement in South Korea's balance of
 payments in 1976 and further gains in 1977 enabled the
 government to consider easing import barriers.   A dou-
 bling of exports in two years and a sharp rise in re-
 ceipts from overseas construction work pushed South
 Korea's current account into the black in 1977 for the
 first time in more than a decade.   Moreover, rapidly
 increasing foreign exchange inflows contributed to
 inflationary pressures.  Foreign exchange reserves

 increased 45 percent last year, leading to a 40-percent
 hike in the money supply.                   Seoul resorted to extensive
 price controls and tight credit restrictions to keep
 within its 10-percent inflation ceiling and began to
 consider import liberalization as an anti-inflation tool.
 The government's liberalization policy also grew
 out of rising pressure from its trading partners, espe-
 cially the United States.   Seoul wants to avoid trade
 problems with Washington at a time when the Pak Tong-
 sun scandal has strained relations and when military
 aid decisions are being made by the US Congress.   For
 the first time,  Seoul has set import as well as export
 targets for its trade with the United States to hold
 down its bilateral surplus.
 The South Korean leadership has been widely split
 on the liberalization issue.   The Economic Planning
 Board, concerned with slowing inflation and improving
 Korean export competitiveness, has pushed hard for a
 rapid easing of controls.   The Ministry of Commerce and
 Industry, citing the growing wave of protectionism in
 the developed countries, has offered strong resistance.
 Implementing Liberalization Measures
 The measures implemented last year were narrow in
 scope but becoming more substantial as the year ended.
 The steps taken in June and July, namely, the removal
 of 46 subitems from the restricted list, were largely
 window dressing.   The trade plan announced in late 1977
 for the first half of 1978 went further, removing re-
 strictions on 186 commodities.   The trade plan and sub-
 sequent administrative guidelines also lifted end-user
 requirements on 40 machinery items,  abolished the export-
 import link system, lifted restrictions on certain types
 of textile machinery, and dropped import ceilings on a
 list of 300 items covered in specific commodity legisla-
 tion.
 The pressure for liberalization increased early
 this year because of a pronounced rise in inflation,
 from 10 percent in 1977 to.24 percent (annual rate) in
 the first quarter of 1978.   Responding to an order from
 President Pak, a committee was established in January

 and quickly set up guidelines.   Key considerations in-
 cluded a desire to foster Korean export competitiveness
 while at the same time protecting emerging industries,
 especially heavy and chemical industries.
 The liberalization program announced on 15 April
 will remove curbs on 321 subitems over the next five
 years--133 items this month,  78 in 1979-80,  and 110 in
 1981-82.   The cautiousness of the program is reflected
 in the categories singled out for early liberalization.
 They include commodities in which Korea lacks compara-
 tive advantage, commodities that are not produced in
 Korea, and commodities in. which Korea is strongly com-
 petitive.
 Impact of the Measures
 According to government estimates, the measures an-
 nounced in November and December 1977 were expected to
 boost 1978 imports by $500 million to $1 billion; in
 practice, the increase probably will not exceed $500
 million.   The additional measures announced on 15 April
 should add another $200 million to 1978 imports,  raising
 total purchases to about $13.5 billion.   Given the changes
 expected in exports and in the services accounts, the
 1978 current account probably will show a deficit close
 to the $300 million now estimated by the government.
 The impact of the program is limited by the commod-
 ities selected for liberalization.  Many of the items
 already are being freely imported in practice, while
 others, such as black and white television sets, are
 not competitive on the Korean market.
 The increase in foreign purchases in 1978 will
 primarily involve raw materials, capital equipment, and
 technology, especially those items destined for Korean
 export firms.   Selected food products will be imported
 more freely for stabilization purposes.   In contrast,
 imports will remain highly restricted for most agricul-
 tural commodities, most consumer products, and those
 industrial goods the government is trying to foster
 domestically.
 Japan, which supplies 37 percent of South Korean
 imports, stands to benefit most from the reduction in

 barriers.   Seoul, however, will attempt to divert bene-
 fits to US and West European suppliers by actively en-
 couraging purchases from those sources.  A massive trade
 deficit with Japan in January and February has intensi-
 fied government efforts in this direction.  Pressure is
 being applied to Korean trading companies and Japanese
 trading firms in Korea to meet specified targets to
 close the trade gap.
 Evaluation
 The South Korean Government, while apparently
 serious about moving toward a more open trading system,
 is proceeding cautiously because of strong domestic
 opposition to liberalization.   Introduction of a new
 surveillance category in the trade plan--in which com-
 modities are monitored and could be moved back to the
 restricted list--leaves the Pak government the option
 of backtracking should payments problems arise.
