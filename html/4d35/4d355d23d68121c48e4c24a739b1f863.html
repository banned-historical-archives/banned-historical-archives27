 Hanoi and the Summits
 The North Vietnamese have yet to comment
 officially on President Nixon's trip to China, but
 the Hanoi press has made it clear that the North
 Vietnamese are worried about the possibility of
 big-power deals on Indochina, in Peking or in
 Moscow. Privately, the Vietnamese Communists
 have been even more fretful. During the recent
 anti-war conference in Versailles, the Vietnamese
 delegates complained that Hanoi was caught in a
 squeeze. "Chou En-Iai is too interested," they
 said, in the US to concern himself with Vietnam,
 "except in speeches." They expressed fears that
 the war would be settled in Peking. A number of
 Page  1
 other North Vietnamese leaders, including party
 First Secretary "tee Duan, have betrayed similar
 concern over the implications of the summits.
 They are obviously worried that, in agreeing
 to summit talks with the US, Hanoi's patrons in
 Peking and Moscow, inadvertently or not, are
 helping the US to distract attention from the
 Vietnam issue. Indeed, in Hanoi's eyes the aura of
 good will being emphasized by both Peking and
 Washington in" coverage of the President's visit
 undercuts the militant, hostile stand against the
 US that Hanoi has been at such pains for so long

 to encourage and tends to spotlight Hanoi as a
 hold out against the new trend of reasonableness
 in the Communist world. But beyond this the
 Vietnamese seem genuinely concerned that China
 or the Soviet Union might make a deal with the
 US at their expense. Such a concern sows doubts
 about the triangular relationship with Moscow
 and Peking that forms the cornerstone of Hanoi's
 foreign policy. A key goal of North Vietnamese
 diplomacy has always been to ensure an adequate
 flow of moral and material backing from China
 and the Soviet Union without coming under the
 thumb of either. Up to now Hanoi has been more
 or less successful in playing Moscow and Peking
 off against each other because each has been
 ready to vie for influence in Indochina, and-
 more important-because neither has been willing
 to see the other become dominant in Hanoi.
 Other factors, of course, have had a bearing
 on Hanoi's relations with its two patrons. Over
 the years the North Vietnamese have had to face
 up to Moscow's dealings with their American ad-
 versary. Hanoi evidently has learned to live with
 this behavior-helped to do so, perhaps, by the
 continuing flow of Soviet assistance to North
 Vietnam. Up to now, however, the North Viet-
 namese have not had to make similar allowances
 for the Chinese. The establishment of contacts
 between Peking and Washington has clearly re-
 opened the question of Chinese motivation, and it
 may be this, feeding on the old legacy of distrust,
 that accounts for the shrillness of Hanoi's re-
 action.  The  Chinese  have  worked  hard  to
 persuade the Vietnamese that Peking's backing is
 as strong as ever, and Hanoi may learn to tolerate
 Peking's  big-power waywardness  as  it has
 Moscow's. Still, so long as the North Vietnamese
 are determined to achieve their maximum poli-
 tical objectives in Indochina, they will be tempted
 to read the worst into Peking's motives and will
 remain hypersensitive to any change in the poli-
 tical environment which might limit their free-
 dom of action or reduce their leverage on world
 opinion.
 These concerns are not, of themselves, likely
 to lead to a basic shift in Hanoi's approach to the
 Page  2
 two big Communist powers. That might happen if
 Moscow or Peking seemed about to give up com-
 peting for influence in Indochina. The continuing
 series of "supplemental" aid agreements being
 signed with both parties suggests, in fact, that the
 competition is very much still on. The recent
 expressions of concern in the North Vietnamese
 press may even be designed in part to prompt a
 more positive response from  both allies that
 would confirm the value of Hanoi's traditional
 balancing act.
 But no matter how successful they are in
 this effort, the North Vietnamese will probably
 never be able to convince themselves that their
 world is what it was prior to the first tentative
 feelers between the US and China. In part, of
 course, their changing perspectives are due to
 international shifts which predate the announce-
 ment of the US-China summitry. In addition,
 after so many years of war, the North Vietnamese
 may simply be taking more seriously the prospect
 of a post-war environment in which regional con-
 tacts will become a more important complement
 to  Hanoi's  relations  with  the  great  powers.
 Hanoi's recent tentative feelers toward such coun-
 tries as Japan and India may be part of an effort
 to hedge bets against the eventual outbreak of
 peace in the area.
 Without the extra incentive provided by the
 changes in big-power relationships, however, it
 seems unlikely that Hanoi would be pursuing the
 new possibilities for international exchange and
 cooperation as vigorously as it has been. I n pur-
 suing new contacts abroad  Hanoi cannot, of
 course, hope for the kind of material aid it has
 gotten from Moscow and Peking; nor can it realis-
 tically expect such countries as Japan or India to
 come out four-square behind North Vietnamese
 objectives on the war. But it may well have de-
 cided that an effort to expand its international
 ties would be advisable and opportune, not only
 as political and economic insurance for the future
 but also as a way of reminding its two major allies
 that they can no longer take their role in North
 Vietnamese affairs for granted and had better
 look  to  their  basic  long-term  inter  s  in
 Hanoi.                                   25X1

 Prime  Minister  Mintoff  insists  on  more
 money and has suggested a meeting with Prime
 Minister Heath. In letters to Heath on 17 and 23
 February, Mintoff renewed his demand for an
 additional, one-time payment of $13 million. He
 stuck to his position on how many Maltese the
 British should employ and how much they should
 be paid. He also raised the question of British aid
 to improve the Malta drydocks as part of a settle-
 ment. London had offered the previous govern-
 ment $7.8 million to improve the drydocks, pay-
 able in  1974 when the original defense and
 financial arrangements were to have lapsed.
 Heath has agreed to a meeting, but has asked
 for a working-level session first to reduce the
 number of issues requiring decisions by the princi-
 pals. Heath reaffirmed the UK-NATO financial
 offer, the allied position on foreign military use
 of Malta, and the broad outlines of the British
 position on the remaining bilateral issues. Mintoff
 told the US ambassador on 22 February that the
 British position was "unacceptable" and that he
 believes only a high-level meeting can close the
 gap. He claimed to have two alternatives-pre-
 sumably Libya and the USSR-to a continued
 British presence. He acknowledged, however, that
 acceptance of either option might provoke violent
 disturbances in Malta.
 There is no reason to believe that Mintoff
 has found a politically viable alternative to the
 final UK-NATO offer of $36.4 million annually,

 Page    4  WEEKLY SUMMARY
 plus bilateral aid. Mintoff apparently wants an
 agreement with the UK, but his inflated view of
 Malta's worth, his increasing domestic strength,
 and his strong belief that the Maltese have long
 been exploited by the British leave him at present
 temperamentally incapable of compromise.
 On the domestic front, Mintoff, who has
 capitialized on growing Maltese nationalism, is in
 complete control. His sharp criticism of British
 negotiating tactics and attitudes has helped to
 consolidate his Labor Party support and has won
 over many apolitical, but anti-British, Maltese.
 Moreover, Mintoff's success in squeezing more
 money out of the UK and NATO at almost every
 stage of the talks so far has probably convinced
 moderate Laborites to continue their support,
 despite misgivings over his tactics.
 For the present, Mintoff has neutralized the
 opposition Nationalist Party and the politically
 influential  Catholic  Church.  The  Nationalists
 seem mesmerized. They are reluctant to criticize
 Mintoff, believing that, if the talks fail, Mintoff
 could accuse them of hampering the government's
 efforts, and that, if the talks produce an accord,
 the Nationalists could be portrayed as having
 been willing to give in for less than Mintoff got.
 The involvement of Archbishop Gonzi, the
 island's conservative Catholic primate, in a futile
 mediation  effort  last  month  and  Mintoff's 25X1
 subsequent calls on the religious leader have given
 the  outward  appearance  that  Gonzi is fully
 briefed and supports the government.

 Cold Hits Soviet, East European Crops
 Severe cold and scanty snow cover threaten
 winter  crops in the Soviet  Union and  Eastern
 Europe. Winter grains usually account for almost 50
 percent of the USSR's bread-grain production. They
 constitute roughly 90 percent of the total in Eastern
 Europe.
 Abnormally low temperatures hit the heart of
 the Soviet winter grain belt in mid-January, and
 there was little snow cover to protect the seedlings.
 The Soviet press admitted damage to the grain in "a
 number of areas" and that some reseeding would be
 necessary. An unusual one-day conference of party
 and government leaders called in Moscow last week
 to discuss spring field work and the livestock sector
 probably reflects the leadership's concern about
 crop prospects this year.
 Similar weather conditions prevailed in 1969
 when about one third of the winter grains sown
 failed to reach maturity. The Soviets have lost a
 large portion of their winter grain about every
 fourth year because of harsh weather. Losses have
 risen as higher yielding but less hardy varieties have
 been adopted.
 The extent of the damage this year will depend
 on the weather to come. That part of the crop not
 yet affected is vulnerable because the lack of snow
 cover  continues  and soil  moisture is declining.
 Losses of winter grains can be recouped in part by
 reseeding with spring grains and by heavier ferti-
 lizing of the surviving winter grains. Resowing re-
 quires an additional expenditure of seed. Moreover,
 yields of spring grains are generally less than those
 of winter grains, and a severe winter often lowers
 the yields of the winter grains actually harvested. If
 the winterkill proves to be as extensive as in 1969,
 the net loss would amount to about four percent of
 the planned grain crop, or seven million tons-
 almost as much as the USSR has arranged to import
 this fiscal year. Last week, Soviet foreign trade bank
 officials admitted that further imports may be
 necessary.
 Throughout Eastern Europe low levels of pre-
 cipitation since last fall combined with a two-week
 period of sub-zero temperatures in late January
 probably caused ar above-normal amount of damage
 to winter crops, particularly the less hardy barley
 and rape crops. A recent warming trend may have
 melted the already sparse snow cover, in which case
 damage from a new freeze in the coming weeks
 would be even more serious.
 Although much of the damage to winter grain
 can   be alleviated through  reseeding this spring,
 normal  or  above-normal     precipitation  will be
 required in the coming weeks to overcome the soil
 moisture deficit.  Lacking that, output of small
 grains will be substantially down from the levels of
 1971, and East European requirements for grain
 imports-most from the USSR-would exceed the
 current relatively high levels.

 Indochina
 SPRING CAMPAIGN SPUTTERS
 Communist military activity picked up last
 weekend, and small-scale harassing actions con-
 tinued through the week. But, so far, no large
 Communist main-force units have been involved.
 Rocket and mortar attacks struck several allied air
 bases and provincial capitals, as well as a number
 of South Vietnamese field positions and outposts,
 but ground assaults were confined primarily to
 small  outposts defending remote villages and
 hamlets.
 Some of the increased fighting was the result
 of aggressive allied patrols and field operations
 designed to disrupt enemy preparations for a new
 offensive. Several stiff battles erupted in the
 northern provinces, where a considerable number
 of enemy troops were reportedly killed. South
 Vietnamese forces were placed on full alert on 19
 February and intensive artillery and air strikes are
 under way to pre-empt enemy plans.
 Thus far, the level of Communist attacks is
 well below what enemy battle preparations would
 have indicate.
 e enemy  ig  comman  may  e allow
 ing su ordinates greater flexibility in the timing
 of attacks this dry season compared to some
 previous years.
 BACKING OFF IN CAMBODIA
 Lon Nol has temporarily backed off from
 replacing Chief of State Cheng Heng and assumin
 the prerogatives of that office himself.
 Lon  Nol  had been urging the Con-
 stituent Assembly to approve a new constitution
 by mid-February providing for the office of presi-
 dent. There were even  plans under way for
 demonstrations in support of such a move.
 If he had persisted, he could well have re-
 vived political tensions in Phnom Penh, especially
 among his many critics who would likely have
 interpreted his haste as further evidence of an
 increasingly authoritative and arbitrary manner.
 When the assembly failed to act by his deadline,
 the prime minister was prevailed upon to wait
 until the constitution is formally completed, pos-
 sibly by the end of February. To quiet specula-
 tion that Cheng Heng would be replaced or that a
 cabinet shuffle was under way, the prime minister

 Jarres. In a clear effort to protect vital supply
 lines, the North Vietnamese are launching sharp
 probes and shelling attacks against the irregular
 forces. One irregular task force moving against
 suspected 130-mm. gun positions on the southern'
 edge of the Plaine has been forced to retreat to
 the area southeast of Phou Louang, while another
 force has made little progress toward the high
 ground at Phou Theung. The two other task
 forces have encountered much less resistance, but
 they have made only slow progress toward objec-
 tives near Route 4.
 The  irregulars thus far have done little
 damage to the Communists' logistic operation,
 but their presence near the Plaine des Jarres has
 relieved  somewhat the Communist pressure
 against Long Tieng and Sam Thong. The level of
 enemy-initiated action near these bases has been
 uncommonly light for the past two weeks.F_
 With the
 number of Communist troops diminished, ir-
 regular units have been able to patrol more
 aggressively, and small forces have moved down
 the north slope of Skyline Ridge to probe enemy
 positions.
 The battle for Long Tieng, however, is not
 over. Air observers report that the Communists
 may have extended the new road from the south-
 ern Plaine to within four miles of Long Tieng. If
 the Communists can quickly disperse Vang Pao's
 forces near the Plaine, they could use the road to
 0 Government-held location
 0 Communist-held location
 redeploy additional troops toward Long Tieng
 and more easily move supplies forward for an
 assault before the rainy season begins in mid-May.
 Souvanna Phouma took a generally concilia-
 tory tone in his response to Souphanouvong's
 recent message on talks. Souvanna indicated that
 he is willing to receive the Communists' special
 envoy in Vientiane to open a "constructive dia-
 logue" as soon as possible and reiterated his
 standard refusal to call for a bombing halt as a
 precondition. Souk Vongsak, the Communist en-
 voy, probably will return to Vientiane fairly soon.
 Productive negotiations, however, seem as remote
 as ever.

 Manila Weighs China Ties
 The Philippines may be preparing to broaden
 contacts with China. Mrs.  Marcos' younger
 brother, Benjamin Romualdez, who has been used
 as a presidential emissary in the past, recently
 made a ten-day visit to Peking that has been
 widely interpreted as laying the groundwork.
 The Romualdez trip was a marked departure
 from Manila's studied avoidance of the Chinese
 and a major step in the slow weakening of the
 Philippines' traditional aloofness from the Com-
 munist world in general. Manila announced last
 month that it would establish its first diplomatic
 ties with Communist countries-Yugoslavia and
 Romania. The mission to Peking coincided with
 statements from Manila of an intention to seek
 closer trade and political relations with Commu-
 nist countries.
 Romualdez probably did raise the question
 of opening trade channels in his talks with Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai. According to the Manila press,
 sources close to Marcos claim the Chinese have
 agreed that trade could develop even in the ab-
 sence of diplomatic relations. Although early
 diplomatic ties with Peking now seem unlikely,
 Manila recognizes the need for eventual move-
 ment in this direction given what it sees as a
 declining US commitment in the western Pacific.
 The Manila press is speculating on a possible
 visit by Mrs. Marcos to China this year. There is
 no other evidence that such a trip is under active
 consideration, but the Marcoses may have decided
 that it would help repair their damaged political
 prestige after the poor showing of the Nacion-
 alista Party in off-year elections last November. A
 journey to China by Mrs. Marcos would, in any
 case, clearly accelerate the move toward closer
 cultural and economic ties and would pave the
 way for additional steps in the future. r
 JAPAN AND MONGOLIA: GETTING TOGETHER
 Tokyo and Ulan Bator established diplo-
 matic relations last week and intend to exchange
 ambassadors within a few months. While Japan
 gave de facto recognition to Ulan Bator in 1961
 by supporting Mongolia's entry into the United
 Nations, Tokyo had in recent years been reluctant
 to move much ahead of the US on establishing

 tered only a pro forma protest, reiterating their
 claim to Mongolian territory.
 The Soviets have been urging the
 Japanese to recognize Ulan Bator for some time,
 and Foreign Minister Gromyko probably pressed
 the case during his recent visit to Tokyo.
 Japan's decision to move at this time reflects
 declining concern with Taipei's interests and a
 belief that the action will not adversely affect the
 improvement of relations with Peking. Following

 World Money: The Dollar is Firm      French Government Under Attack
 This week, the dollar has stabilized, at least
 temporarily, in international currency markets,
 and European central bank intervention has sub-
 sided. The Reuters index of major currencies
 shows an over-all dollar depreciation since the
 Smithsonian currency realignment of 1.1 percent,
 a level midway between the dollar's central rate
 and the lower limit of its wider band. Two cur-
 rencies, the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder, are
 very near their ceilings. The German mark and
 Japanese yen are about 1.6 and 1.8 percent, re-
 spectively, above their central rates. Central banks
 in these countries have intervened in moderate
 support of the dollar over the past few weeks.
 Although the German interventions have been the
 largest, they were made chiefly to demonstrate a
 willingness to defend the Smithsonian currency
 alignment. Japanese dollar purchases have been
 intermittent and primarily to smooth out daily
 market  fluctuations.  On  Thursday,  however,
 Tokyo reimposed some controls to stem the
 inflow of dollars.
 Several factors have contributed to the firm-
 ness of the dollar,  including the businesslike
 Senate hearings on raising the price of gold, which
 dampened speculation against the dollar. Perhaps
 more important have been reports that Germany
 may lower its bank rate and require German firms
 to deposit a portion of their foreign borrowings in
 interest-free domestic accounts, thereby in-
 creasing the real cost of borrowing abroad.
 The reported consideration by West Ger-
 many-Europe's most ardent defender of free
 capital movement-of implementing such restric-
 tions reflects a growing belief in Europe that
 controls on capital movement will be required to
 defend the Smithsonian currency realignment.
 Foreign central banks are willing to purchase
 limited  amounts  of  dollars,  but  if  massive
 speculative flows were to resume, they would
 probably impose strict controls on movement
 rather than absorb substantial quantities of dol-
 lars.
 Until recently, the largely divided opposition
 parties in France had little political ammunition
 to fire at the government. The economy is in
 good shape and Prime Minister Chaban-Delmas
 has kept students and labor pacified. The con-
 troversy over alleged  irregularities in Chaban-
 Delmas' tax returns, however, and criticism of
 Gaullists implicated in other scandals have given
 the opposition new life.
 The government, greatly embarrassed, fears
 that such publicity will cut into the Gaullist
 majority  in  the  parliamentary  elections this
 spring.  The  government  is  in  no immediate
 danger, and President Pompidou does not wish to
 dismiss Chaban-Delmas. Although the prime min-
 ister has not regained the degree of public confi-
 dence he enjoyed six weeks ago, he has had some
 success in fending off criticism. Given this re-
 maining support and the prime minister's cordial
 links with the centrists, who lend tacit and some-
 times open support to the government, Pompidou
 has good reason for keeping Chaban-Delmas in
 office-at least for the present.
 Since defending himself on television last
 week, Chaban-Delmas-with full  support from
 Pompidou-has continued to proclaim his per-
 sonal integrity and to speak out for government
 policies.  By  supporting  the  prime  minister,
 Pompidou hopes to minimize the electoral impact
 of the tax affair and other scandals. Nine separate
 cases involving fraud, abuse of public confidence,
 influence peddling, extortion, and outright theft
 surfaced in 1971. A common thread running
 through  all  the  scandals  is  a  connection-
 sometimes  explicit  and  sometimes                                                                                   tenuous-
 between those accused and the Gaullist party.
 Only a few Gaullists are involved thus far, and, on
 the basis of what has been uncovered to date,
 critics cannot accuse the Pompidou government
 of widespread corruption. There are persistent
 rumors,  however,  that  ranking  Gaullists  are
 implicated in more serious abuses.

 Problems Face Geneva Arms Conferees
 The 26-nation Geneva disarmament con-
 ference resumes on 29 February, but prospects
 for agreement on any of the likely issues do not
 appear good. There is no indication as yet that
 the Chinese plan to attend, although their admis-
 sion to the conference received strong support at
 the UN General Assembly last fall. If they decide
 to show up, they will likely insist on ending the
 US-USSR co-chairmanship, letting in third-world
 countries sympathetic to their views, and con-
 sidering such propagandistic proposals as "no first
 use" of nuclear weapons. Should the Chinese take
 part, the French will likely be asked again to sit
 in, they have left their chair empty for ten years.
 A prime question facing the conference this
 year will be a ban on the development and stock-
 piling of chemical weapons. The non-aligned, in
 particular, want such a ban to follow up the
 convention on biological weapons, which will be
 opened for signature next month. The US has
 gained some support for its argument that verifi-
 cation measures are not yet sufficient to permit
 an international accord on chemical weapons.
 The other prominent topic is the perennial
 one of a comprehensive nuclear test ban. The
 Soviets continue to reject on-site inspection. Sev-
 eral NATO allies and Secretary General Waldheim
 now appear inclined to accept the Soviet position,
 with international exchanges of seismic data as a
 possible back-up to national means of verifica-
 tion. Moreover, many non-nuclear states seem to
 regard a comprehensive ban as logical at this time.
 However, no significant progress will be possible
 until the long-standing US-USSR impasse over
 verification is broken.
 The Geneva conferees have managed one
 significant agreement in three of the last four
 years, and pressures will be strong to keep up the
 pace. Progress at Geneva this year would undercut
 support for convening the unwieldy all-member
 UN Disarmament Commission or holding a world
 disarmament conference, as proposed at the
 General  Assembly last fall.  Further progress
 toward putting into effect the safeguards required
 by the Non-Proliferation Treaty would also
 improve the international climate on disarmament
 matters. The third round of negotiations between
 the IAEA and EURATOM on these safeguards
 was held in Vienna this week. The outcome of
 these negotiations will have an important bearing
 on whether the five EURATOM non-nuclear
 states-as well as Japan-will eventually ratify the
 Non-Proliferation Treaty.
 UN MARITIME TALKS RESUME
 The General Assembly's seabeds committee reconvenes in New York on 28 February to
 prepare for the 1973 Law of the Sea conference. The Chinese Communists will participate in
 committee work for the first time. Peking does not appear to have a fully developed policy on the
 complex maritime subjects as yet, but its statements to date suggest that it will support coastal state
 claims to extensive territorial waters and the seabeds below. This week, for example, Peking
 officially recognized Argentina's 200-mile territorial waters claim.
 Conferees at the New York session must agree on a list of issues for the 1973 meeting.
 Spain-which wants more control over passage through the Straits of Gibraltar-has joined the
 South American states to prevent progress in hopes of obtaining more support for their positions.
 Other participants, however, are now more inclined to draw up an agenda for 1973. With regard to
 territorial waters, a consensus may be developing for agreement on a 12-mile limit, with coastal
 states having some control over resources and pollution problems in a broader zone.

 Hungary: Still the Conservatives
 Party leader Kadar is trying to fight off
 conservative attacks on his moderate reforms. Al-
 though the conservatives have some support from
 Moscow, Kadar is threatening to act against those
 who get out of step. He has flown to Moscow to
 remind the Soviets that, by backing the conserva-
 tive faction, they invite instability in Hungary,
 where the population is volatile and potentially
 anti-Soviet.
 The conservatives have seized on balance-of-
 payments and investment problems as ammuni-
 tion to attack further economic and political
 reforms.                          some of the
 attacks are coming rom wit in t e central com-
 mittee. Zoltan Komocsin, an opportunist polit-
 buro member, allegedly wants to abandon the
 reforms and hew more closely to the Soviet
 model. On 3 February, the Soviets lent support to
 the conservatives with an article in Pravda warn-
 ing about Hungarian susceptibility to nationalist
 and Zionist deviations. Pravda also pointedly
 reminded  Budapest of past problems with
 younger, overly liberal party members who were
 promoted over "veteran Communists."
 On 10 February, Kadar personally stepped
 into the quarrel. At a Budapest party meeting, he
 emphasized that he was in control and seconded
 demands for action made by one of his loyal
 proteges, Karoly Nemeth. Nemeth had said that
 officials at all levels who ignore or distort the
 party line should be demoted. He also warned
 against using Soviet-style anti-Zionism-Nemeth
 candidly  called  it  "anti-Semitism"-to  attack
 Jewish liberals, some of whom are close to Kadar.
 On 11 February, Kadar began three days of
 talks with Brezhnev in Moscow. Kadar probably
 told the Soviets that his domestic policies are
 "the only possible way" to build a stable Com-
 munist system in Hungary. This argument has
 succeeded in the past and still carries weight.
 Although                             Kadar won
 Soviet support and alt oug  t e communique
 after the talks alleged a "complete identity of
 views," it is doubtful that Kadar overcame either
 Kadar: To Be Persuasive
 Soviet misgivings about his reforms or the Krem-
 lin's affinity for the Hungarian right.
 Moscow reportedly is unhappy with Buda-
 pest's increased indebtedness to the West and
 with its occasional failure to deliver contracted
 goods to the USSR. There are more practical
 ways for the Soviets to register these complaints
 than by direct interference in Hungarian internal
 affairs. A Soviet delegation will discuss long-range
 economic cooperation later this year and the pres-
 sure inherent in such talks should help keep the
 Hungarians in line. In fact, the current difficulties
 will be read in Budapest as a go-slow sign on
 innovations.
 There are long-range stakes in the conserva-
 tive challenge to Kadar. If he permits any ques-
 tioning of his basic policies now, chances for a
 smooth  succession  would  all  but  disappear.
 Kadar's decision to turn to Nemeth for support at
 this time indicates that Nemeth is a prime con-
 tender  to  succeed                                                                                the  60-year-old    party

 Open Roads in Eastern Europe
 Poles, East Germans, and Czechoslovaks in
 large numbers are taking advantage of new agree-
 ments that minimize passport and customs for-
 malities. They poured across the borders in record
 numbers last month. All that the Poles and East
 Germans now need to cross into each other's
 territory for three-month periods are their per-
 sonal identity documents. Since 1 January their
 governments have dramatically relaxed currency
 restrictions and have virtually abolished reciprocal
 customs duties and declarations.
 A similar agreement between East Germany
 and Czechoslovakia went into effect on 15 Janu-
 ary; a third such arrangement between Poland and
 Czechoslovakia will be completed in April. During
 the first three weeks of the Polish - East German
 agreement, over a half-million East Germans
 visited Poland, and 350,000 Poles went to East
 Germany. These exchanges far surpassed total
 tourist traffic between the two countries for all of
 1971.
 The new travel arrangements are designed to
 popularize the East German and Polishparty lead-
 erships and to relieve people's frustrations. Some
 East German disappointment over the failure of
 the Berlin agreement to provide for greater travel
 to the West, for example, may be softened by
 easier travel to the East. A Polish survey reports

 that 83 percent of the Polish population has an
 urge to travel abroad. Poles have been told that
 the new travel arrangements will satisfy this urge,
 and the Polish consumer is being told that access
 to East German commodities will be a vast im-
 provement  over the drab selection at home.
 Indeed, Polish women are being encouraged to
 shop in Berlin, which for many Poles is far closer
 than Warsaw.
 The regimes may indeed be substituting lib-
 eral                     border-crossing regulations for what they
 know they cannot offer in the near term. Thus, in
 the absence of any real freedom of expression or
 any hope of a solution to the chronic housing
 shortage, the new travel arrangements are billed as
 a significant manifestation of individual freedom
 that "widens one's living space."
 Forecasts in the Polish press that all the
 European socialist countries, except Albania, will
 conclude open-border agreements in 1972 seem
 overly  optimistic.  The practical  problems as-
 sociated with a flood of tourists-accommoda-
 tions, transportation, and food-are already cre-
 ating difficulties. Last week, Prague banned the
 export of certain foodstuffs and consumer goods
 by tourists because of short supplies.
 In addition, many authorities doubtless have
 serious political reservations about the experi-
 ment in Eastern Europe's northern tier. For them,
 the massive response in mid-winter probably has
 added to misgivings about what summer would
 bring. Hungary already has announced a wait-
 and-see attitude and has voiced apprehensions
 over uncontrolled tourism. Indeed, control is the
 key factor; Eastern Europe's leaders have not yet
 resolved the problem of how to relax certain
 restraints without fostering demands for addi-
 tional liberties.                                  25X1

 USSR Draws Close to Arab Clients
 The Soviet Union is devoting an unusual
 amount of attention to its position in the Middle
 East, particularly in Egypt, Iraq, and Syria, which
 receive more than half of all Soviet military as-
 sistance to the third world. Moscow's relations
 with these states, often troubled, have been dis-
 turbed lately by Arab distrust generated by Mos-
 cow's alleged support for the Communist coup in
 the Sudan last summer, its support for India in
 the defeat of Muslim Pakistan, and its lukewarm
 support for Sadat's ambitious aims. Moscow is
 moving to overcome these obstacles.
 The USSR had been particularly cautious in
 developing ties with Iraq and Syria because of
 misgivings about the stability of those regimes.
 The Kremlin apparently believes at this juncture
 that Baghdad and Damascus have their internal
 affairs in the kind of order that would permit the
 USSR to benefit from more visible signs of sup-
 port. Iraq and Syria, for their part, are edging
 away from their traditional isolation within the
 Arab world and are interested in better ties with
 the USSR.
 The Soviets signed large military and eco-
 nomic aid agreements with Baghdad in the past
 year. Last week's visit to Moscow by Saddam
 Tikriti, the current strong man in the Iraqi Gov-
 ernment, strengthened these ties. The Baghdad
 press has announced that a treaty of friendship
 and cooperation will be signed in April when an
 impressive Soviet delegation is due to visit Iraq to
 dedicate the North Rumaila oil field, a Soviet aid
 project.
 The communique winding up Tikriti's visit
 was marked by some Iraqi movement toward the
 Soviet position favoring a "democratic solution of
 the Kurdish problem." The Soviets have long
 urged the Iraqis to at least pay lip service to
 greater political participation for the Kurds and
 the Communists. The communique did not en-
 dorse a political settlement in the Middle East,
 however, and the Iraqis apparently did not yield
 to the Soviets on this point.
 This week, the Soviets sent Kiril Mazurov,
 politburo member and deputy chairman of the
 Council of Ministers, to Syria at the head of a
 delegation of high-ranking military and economic
 officials. On 22 February, the two sides signed
 the first cooperation agreement between the
 Syrian Baathist and Soviet Communist parties.
 Soviet Defense Minister Grechko returned to
 the USSR on 21 February from four-day visits to
 Egypt and Somalia, where the armed forces de-
 pend on Moscow for nearly all of their military
 assistance. Neither visit yielded any announce-
 ment of new aid commitments, but in both places
 Grechko reaffirmed Moscow's support for con-
 tinued military cooperation. The presence of
 several high-level Soviet military officials with
 Grechko in Egypt suggests that his visit there was
 not a routine affair. The Soviets may have under-
 taken a comprehensive review of Cairo's military
 needs, as well as those of Moscow's own forces
 operating in the Middle East.
 The announcement that Libyan Deputy Pre-
 mier Jallud would arrive in Moscow on 23 Feb-
 ruary suggests that Tripoli may receive more
 Soviet military equipment. President Qadhafi has
 criticized the Soviets at every opportunity and
 has worked hard to limit the Soviet presence in
 the Mediterranean. But like other Arab leaders, he
 realizes that the Western states do not deliver
 arms as willingly or as cheaply as the USSR.
 Jallud has taken part in Soviet-Libyan arms talks
 before.
 Military assistance remains the common
 denominator in all of these Soviet-Arab contacts.
 Arms aid has built Moscow a position of influence
 in the Middle East at the expense of the West and
 has given the Soviets access to ports, airfields, and
 other  facilities for their expanded military
 presence.

 Egypt: Patience, Peace, Palestine
 Over the past ten days, Egyptian officials
 have been stressing the need for patience in the
 present trying period while attempting to lay the
 blame for some of the country's problems on
 "outside elements."
 President Sadat and other high Egyptian of-
 ficials focused on meetings of the national party
 congress. He again pointed up the dangers of
 impatience to the congress, declared the Arabs
 have other equally effective weapons beside the
 threat to use Arab oil as a weapon against the US
 and Israel, and acknowledged that relations be-
 tween Egypt and the Soviet Union might be sub-
 ject to differences. Sadat characterized these as
 minor and maintained that there were no strings
 attached to Soviet aid.
 The President directed another warning at
 Egypt's students, stating that he would not allow
 study time to be devoted to anything but study.
 The repeated warnings, which he has demon-
 strated will be backed by the use of force when
 necessary, along with measures designed to under-
 cut student grievances apparently have had the
 desired effect for the moment. Cairo's universities
 reopened last weekend with no incidents re-
 ported.
 Egyptian officials have sought to deflect
 criticism from the regrme by blaming foreign spies
 and saboteurs for some of Egypt's problems. The
 arrest of three alleged Israeli agents, accused of
 distributing  anti-government  leaflets  to  incite
 student  demonstrators   last  month,  was      an-
 nounced this week. The discovery of another
 group of anti-government intellectual activists was
 also publicized, their goal allegedly being the
 overthrow of the Egyptian and other Arab gov-
 ernments.
 The hearings of the four Palestinians accused
 of assassinating Jordanian Premier Wasfi Tal also
 gained widespread attention in Cairo during the
 week. The four defendants publicly admitted the
 killing, but claimed it was a legal commando
 action to do away with an "Arab traitor." If, as
 indicated, the trial turns into a public indictment
 of King Husayn and his policies toward the
 fedayeen, Egyptian-Jordanian relations, already
 cool, will be further damaged.
 Meanwhile, UN envoy Gunnar Jarring ar-
 rived in Tel Aviv on 25 February on his tour of
 Middle East capitals. He spent three days in Cairo
 last weekend before proceeding to Nicosia and
 Amman. In addition to discussing the general
 state of diplomatic play, the Egyptians probably
 used the visit to sound him out on his interest in
 playing a role in the US-proposed "proximity
 talks" with Israel on an interim Suez arrange-
 ment. Jarring, for his part, probably would be
 interested.
 Amman, on the other hand, would prefer
 that Jarring focus more attention on Jordanian
 interests in the Arab-Israeli problem. The Jor-
 danians have chafed at his concentration for over
 a year on the Egyptian-Israeli negotiating impasse.
 They probably pressed Jarring to ask Tel Aviv to
 set forth its terms for a settlement on the Jor-
 danian aspects of the dispute.
 Israel is unlikely to be forthcoming on either
 of these schemes. In recent months, Tel Aviv's
 dissatisfaction with Jarring has been evident, and
 the Israelis would be reluctant to spell out their
 terms vis-a-vis the Jordanians.

 The Arab World
 The seizure on 21 February of a Lufthansa
 Boeing 747 by the fedayeen was the latest inci-
 dent in the Palestinian terrorists' campaign against
 Western economic interests. Although the feda-
 yeen who commandeered the aircraft identified
 themselves as members of "the Organization of
 Victims of the Zionist Occupation," they are
 probably members of either Fatah, the Popular
 Front for the Liberation of Palestine, or the
 Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of
 Palestine, all of which have been involved in hi-
 jackings. The latter two organizations have long
 had close ties with the Yemen (Aden) govern-
 ment, where the plane was forced to land. The
 perpetrators allowed the plane and its crew to
 continue their flight on the 23rd despite an earlier
 demand that a number of Palestinians allegedly
 arrested by West German police be released first.
 Press reports from Beirut claim a $3 million
 ransom had been paid by Lufthansa. If the re-
 ports are true, the fedayeen will be emboldened
 to carry out still further hijackings.
 Sheik Ahmad ibn Ali al-Thani, frequently an
 absentee ruler, was deposed on 22 February by
 his cousin, Sheik Khalifa ibn Hamad al-Thani, the
 heir apparent and prime minister.
 The ouster took place while the former ruler
 was in Iran on a hunting trip. Shortly after the
 change of leadership was announced, Sheik
 Khalifa increased the salaries of security force
 personnel and other civil servants and canceled
 debts due the government from low-income pur-
 chasers of public housing. He has also announced
 that the former ruler's income, which allegedly
 amounted to 25 percent of the state's revenues,
 will be transferred to the general budget. There
 has been no opposition to the turnover.
 The two cousins were at odds during the
 mid-1960s, but their relations seemed to have
 settled down in recent years. Sheik Khalifa had
 responsibility for running Qatar on a day-to-day
 basis, while the ousted ruler spent much of his
 time abroad. The ruling family is large-num-
 bering  perhaps  500  male members-and well
 armed. Some members have a reputation for
 undisciplined behavior, so the new ruler will have
 to make certain he has the support of the various
 branches of the family.
 The 3,000-man public security force, divided
 between military and police components, is made
 up largely of Saudi and Yemeni mercenaries. It is
 commanded by Muhammad Mahdi-born Ronald
 Cochrane-a former British officer converted to
 Islam. The public security force has shown no
 sign of becoming involved in domestic affairs.
 This is the second move within a month

 other Arab states were implicated in the coup

 A conference of Islamic foreign ministers
 will begin in Saudi Arabia on 29 February. About
 30 states are expected to be represented at this,
 the third conference since 1970. The five-day
 meeting is being held under the aegis of the
 Islamic Secretariat, a creation of King Faysal
 designed  to  promote Muslim solidarity, rally
 international Islamic support for the Arab posi-
 tion, and-not incidentally-enhance the Saudi
 monarch's prestige.
 Previous conferences have produced acrimo-
 nious debate cloaked by final communiques bland
 enough to satisfy the diverse interests of those
 represented. Little in the way of substantive
 achievements have come out of them. The prosaic
 formal agenda of this conference includes the
 establishment of an Islamic development bank
 and a news agency. It is likely that the Indo-
 Pakistani conflict and the Iranian occupation of
 the Persian Gulf islands will be discussed, along
 with such perennial topics as Palestine and the
 "liberation" of Africa.
 After months of procrastination, interrupted
 by intermittent consultations with the political
 opposition, King Hassan has at last moved toward
 sharing some of his powers with the government
 and  parliament. In the process, the King has
 thrown his opponents off balance and increased
 confusion in their ranks.
 Late last week, Hassan announced that a
 nationwide referendum, now scheduled for 1
 March, would be held to approve certain constitu-
 tional amendments. He said these would involve
 the direct election of two thirds of parliament,
 the indirect election of the other third, and pro-
 vide increased but balanced powers for the "exec-
 utive" and legislative branches of government.
 The King reserved for himself all the prerogatives
 of a chief of state, including appointment of the
 government,  dissolution  of  parliament,  and
 amending-subject to referendum-the constitu-
 tion. Once again, he claimed the mandate of the
 people.
 While these proposals on the surface appear
 to give significant authority to the government
 and parliament, they fall far short of meeting the
 basic demands of the opposition National Front
 coalition, which seeks a constitutional monarchy
 with circumscribed  powers. Carefully avoiding
 outright rejection, the front registered "astonish-
 ment" at the King's announcement. The front
 declared that the King's new constitution, "re-
 gardless of the positive elements it might present,
 does not respond to the demands of the situation
 or constitute a valid solution." Five days later, it
 announced it would "abstain" during the referen-
 The King's behavior over recent weeks may
 in the long run help create new difficulties for
 him. His power base has been narrowing for the
 past decade. Both students and labor are restive-
 the former have boycotted their classes almost
 continuously since early this year and the latter
 seized on the relaxation of economic controls last
 fall to engage in prolonged and repeated strikes to
 gain  more  benefits.

 Greece-Cyprus: No Solution Yet
 The  Greek  Government and  President
 Makarios are retreating cautiously from the edge
 of violence. The recent events on Cyprus have
 surfaced some very basic disagreements between
 the Archbishop and Athens, however, and it will
 take intensive care to mend this rift. Meanwhile, a
 trivial incident on the island could lead to rash
 action.
 The Greek regime, since the take-over in
 1967, has failed to convince Makarios that
 Athens, being the center of Hellenism, has a right
 to advise him on Cypriot matters. In Makarios'
 view, this is interference in Cypriot internal af-
 fairs. The Archbishop's major concern has been to
 protect his position as the political and religious
 leader of the Greek Cypriots in the face of in-
 creasing political pressure from Athens. Other
 factors contributing to the ill-will  between
 Makarios and Athens include the Greek-Turkish
 rapprochement over the past three years, Athens'
 and Ankara's renewed efforts to find a solution to
 Cypriot intercommunal problems, and the clan-
 destine return of General Grivas to the island last
 September. All of these events raised Makarios'
 fears of a Greek or a combined Greek-Turkish
 attempt to force him to accept an imposed solu-
 tion to Cyprus' problem.
 The Athens government, until  recently,
 made every effort to obscure these growing dif-
 ferences with the Archbishop. The number-one
 priority in Athens, however, has been to work for
 good relations with Ankara. The Turks have be-
 lieved all along that Makarios is the real obstacle
 to permanent peace in Cyprus. The Czech arms
 issue provided Greece with a reason to accept the
 Turkish position, further improve Athens-Ankara
 relations, and put an end to Makarios' stubborn
 refusal to accept Greek primacy.
 Nothing has yet come of Athens' threat last
 week of military action against Makarios. It is
 difficult to believe that Athens really accepted
 Panayotakos' claim that in a showdown the Greek
 Cypriots would support Greece over Makarios,
 but given the apparent high regard for Panayo-
 takos in Athens, it is one possibility. On the other
 hand, both the Turkish charge in Cyprus, Inhan,
 and the head of the Greek Cypriot House of
 Representatives, Clerides, say that the Greeks
 have spent a long time in preparing for the con-
 frontation with Makarios, and they both believe
 the crisis has not passed.
 In any event, now that the immediate threat
 has faded, the focus has returned to the Czech
 arms issue. Makarios has not responded to Greek
 demands that he turn over the arms to the UN.
 Turkish concern for its community on Cyprus is
 likely to persist as long as this demand is not met,
 and Ankara may eventually insist upon a compen-
 satory arms buildup for the Turkish Cypriots.
 Although the record of Greek-Cypriot relations
 favors some kind of negotiated settlement, as long
 as the arms issue remains unresolved, the situation
 on the island will remain explosive.

 Bangladesh: Trials of a New Nation
 Transport problems, raw material and food
 shortages, and labor difficulties are hampering
 economic recovery. The two major ports, Chit-
 tagong and Chalna, cannot handle the relief and
 rehabilitation imports that Bangladesh requires.
 They still are partially blocked, and clearing
 operations get more difficult as sunken ships set-
 tle farther into the mud. Undiscovered mines re-
 main a hazard; on 12 February, an Esso oil tanker
 exploded and sank in Chittagong harbor. Accord-
 ing to the UN, Chittagong port is handling only
 about one third  of  its normal  200,000-ton
 monthly capacity. The UN relief operation has
 chartered vessels and tugs to try to speed port
 clearances. There are 350,000 tons of inbound
 cargo alone clogging the docks.
 Exports of jute and jute manufactures, the
 major foreign-exchange earners, are far below
 normal. Last fall's jute crop is estimated by the
 chairman of the Bangladesh Jute Board at only
 4-4.5 million bales-more than 40-percent below
 normal. But transport bottlenecks preclude ship-
 ment of even this amount. About 70,000 tons of
 jute manufactures and 145,000 tons of raw jute
 reportedly are awaiting shipment at the two
 ports,  and  more is stocked elsewhere. Dock
 workers are causing further delays by refusing to
 load jute until each bale is relabeled "Product of
 Bangladesh." Large quantities of jute are being
 smuggled into India where the price is almost 20
 percent higher.
 The lack of skilled, technical, and managerial
 personnel is retarding industrial recovery, while
 urban  unemployment  is  rising  as  unskilled
 workers flock to cities. In the jute industry, many
 skilled Bengali workers were killed during the civil
 war, and their Bihari counterparts are afraid of
 reprisals  if  they  return  to  work.  The large
 Adamjee  Jute  Mill,      which normally employs
 30,000 workers, is running at 15-20 percent of
 capacity with only 8,000 workers.
 With the economy unable to provide suf-
 ficient employment, discontent among the Mukti
 Bahini guerrillas-who greatly outnumber the gov-
 ernment security forces and in many cases are still
 armed-is likely to grow unless Dacca manages to
 find enough places for them in the government
 bureaucracy, the new national militia, the army
 and police forces, or the country's educational
 institutions. For the most part, the guerrilla's
 have not seriously disrupted law and order in the
 two months since independence. Last week, how-
 ever, two clashes, with gunfire and casualties,
 broke out between government forces and ex-
 guerrillas who felt they were being denied their
 rights  and  prerogatives as  former  freedom
 fighters.  Additionally, reports of  looting and
 extortion, both by genuine ex-guerrillas and by
 hooligans masquerading as Mukti Bahini, are be-
 coming more frequent.
 Raw material  shortages are hindering in-
 dustrial recovery. For example, only five of the
 17 tobacco processing factories in Bangladesh,
 which employed over 34,000 workers, are operat-
 ing. The rest are closed for lack of tobacco, which
 previously was imported from West Pakistan. The
 five will have to close by mid-March when their
 supplies run out.
 The Bangladesh Government is helping the
 refugees returning from India-over 8 million are
 back in Bangladesh-and the estimated 20 million
 displaced persons within the country. Although
 Dacca has allocated $22 million for reconstruc-
 tion of the rural economy and $41 million for
 immediate relief and rehabilitation, only $7 mil-
 lion has been distributed so far. It is far from
 enough.
 The UN estimates that Bangladesh will re-
 quire 200,000 tons of imported foodgrains a
 month until the harvest next winter. The major
 winter rice crop, just harvested, was better than
 expected but still far smaller than in previous
 years. The spring crop is likely to be relatively
 poor  because  not enough fertilizer and farm
 equipment will be available. India has pledged
 500,000 tons of foodgrains to be delivered by 1
 June, primarily by overland and barge transport
 because of the port congestion. Two trains carry-
 ing 57,000 tons have already reached destinations
 in Bangladesh, and at least three more trains with
 foodgrains are en route from Calcutta.

 SOVIET SHIPS LEAVE INDIAN OCEAN
 The Soviets have begun withdrawing part of the naval force sent to the Indian Ocean following
 the outbreak of hostilities between  India and Pakistan. Early this week, a guided-missile cruiser
 and a nuclear-powered cruise-missile submarine left the Indian Ocean, apparently returning to their
 Pacific Fleet bases. Two other surface ships and a submarine may soon be headed for the Malacca
 Straits en route to home waters.
 Until the Indo-Pakistani war, the usual Soviet force in the Indian Ocean consisted of three
 surface combatants and a submarine. In response to the fighting on the subcontinent and the
 presence of a US naval task force in the Indian Ocean, the Soviets increased their force during
 December by eight combatants and nine support ships. Although the Soviets demonstrated readi-
 ness to augment their naval forces, the logistic requirements almost certainly strained their support
 system. As the tensions between India and Pakistan relax, the Soviets will probably continue to
 Indian States Go to the Polls
 Elections will take place in 16 of India's 21
 states and in two of its six union territories begin-
 ning on 5 March and stretching over a seven-day
 period. Of these, eight are under the political
 control of the Ruling Congress Party, seven are
 under administrative control of the central gov-
 ernment, and three have other than Ruling Con-
 gress governments. Prime Minister Gandhi's Rul-
 ing Congress Party is expected to win majorities
 in most states. Even in those areas where the
 going may prove difficult, Ruling Congress strate-
 gists expect enough votes to give the party a
 dominant position in a coalition government.
 The Ruling Congress Party is fielding candi-
 dates in all the states and territories, and in-every
 case Mrs. Gandhi has personally approved the
 slate. Only her candidates received "electoral
 tickets." This nomination process has shaken the
 party  organization; many old-line leaders,
 dropped by Mrs. Gandhi, are running as inde-
 pendents. Nevertheless, Mrs. Gandhi's promise of
 a new and "progressive" era has strong appeal and
 the bulk of local Ruling Congress Party leaders
 will be loath to buck the tide. Mrs. Gandhi ex-
 pects that the 1972 state elections will consoli-
 date her control of the party organization at the
 local level in the same way that the 1971 national
 election consolidated her control of the central
 government.
 For the most part, the opposition to Mrs.
 Gandhi is demoralized and fragmented. The op-
 position parties are concentrating their efforts in
 those states where they believe they have some
 chance of success and are not fighting the Ruling
 Congress on a nationwide basis. Still, their
 prospects appear bleak. The Organization Con-
 gress, which broke with Mrs. Gandhi in 1969, is
 plagued by infighting and has not succeeded in
 shedding its unpopular conservative image. The
 Socialist Party is unable to create a viable con-
 stituency from among those who find the Com-
 munist parties too extreme and the Ruling Con-
 gress too moderate. Hindu-nationalist parties such
 as the Jana Sangh have failed to compete ef-
 fectively, especially in light of the government's
 recent victory over Pakistan. Conservative groups
 like the Swantantra Party continue to disintegrate
 in a nation avowedly "socialist," and regional
 parties are being pushed hard by Ruling Congress
 Party workers attempting to capitalize on the
 national euphoria induced by India's military suc-
 cess.
 Nevertheless, all will not be smooth sailing
 for the Ruling Congress.  In states such  as
 violence-prone West Bengal, politically frag-
 mented Bihar, and the Punjab-long ruled by the
 Sikh  religious sect-the  Ruling Congress has
 elected to hedge its bets by entering agreements

 with like-minded parties not to contest against
 each other in specified constituencies. In the ma-
 jority of cases, the Congress has found it most
 convenient to team with the pro-Moscow Com-
 munist  Party  of  India.  By aligning with this
 "moderate" Communist group, Mrs. Gandhi suc-
 ceeds in dealing a blow to their common enemy,
 the radical Communist Party of India/Marxist.
 The pro-Moscow Communists hold only 24
 seats in the 521-member lower house of Parlia-
 ment to 258 for the Ruling Congress, and Mrs.
 Gandhi does not consider them a threat. She has
 undertaken to share power with them in West
 Bengal, but elsewhere she has been reluctant to
 tie the Ruling Congress to any coalition agree-
 ments. Although Congress strategists probably are
 considering the possibility of post-election coali-
 tion governments in some problem states, for the
 most part the party is going it alone. The prog-
 nosis for this strategy is good-as many as 30
 Congress Party leaders in seven states have already
 been  declared  elected  unopposed.

 Congo: Ngouabi Still in Charge
 President Ngouabi's extremist partners in his
 military-based coalition appear to be shattered in
 the wake of the confused events in Brazzaville on
 22 February. An extensive purge and reorganiza-
 tion of the regime is expected.
 Broadcasts over Radio Congo on the morn-
 ing of 22 February accused army chief of staff
 Yhomby-Opango  of trying to  seize power in
 Brazzaville while President Ngouabi was in the
 coastal city of Pointe Noire. The radio then went
 off the air for several hours. It returned with a
 statement from Yhomby-Opango asserting his
 loyalty to Ngouabi and  announcing that "in
 communication  with"  the President  he  had
 crushed a military plot by "ambitious" army ele-
 ments under the leadership of extremist political
 bureau member, Ange Diawara. Ngouabi then re-
 turned to the capital and gave a radio speech. He
 repeated Yhomby-Opango's charges and stated
 that many arrests were being made.
 The actual course of events during the da
 remains murky.
 In any event, it is clear that Ngouabi is exploiting
 the situation to move decisively against the left
 wing of his regime. Virtually all of the country's
 prominent leftist extremists are reportedly under
 arrest or being hunted down. As of 23 February,
 Diawara evidently was still  at large. Another
 important political  bureau  member, Ambroise
 Noumazalaye, and the popular militia commander
 are among the detainees.
 Ngouabi has already made some changes in
 the army, and other moves to solidify his position
 are sure to follow. Meanwhile, Ngouabi has re-
 sponded warmly to a congratulatory message
 from President Mobutu, which could presage a

 El Salvador: Disputed Election
 The presidential election on 20 February
 was almost a draw between the two leading con-
 testants. In the absence of official returns, the
 only certainties are that none of the four candi-
 dates won a majority and that, unless the military
 intervenes directly, the legislature will elect El
 Salvador's next president.
 The left-of-center opposition is crying fraud;
 its allegations are based mainly on the tally in the
 Department of San Salvador, the area of its great-
 est strength. Leaders of the opposition coalition
 say the departmental count showed their candi-
 date, Napoleon Duarte, running about two-to-one
 ahead of the governing party's Colonel Molina.
 Early figures released by the Central Electoral
 Council indicate a narrower margin-enough to
 give Molina, strong in rural areas, an over-all
 plurality. The council's delay in announcinq offi-
 cial results is taken by the coalition as "proof"
 that figures are being juggled to deny Duarte a
 victory.
 The legislature is expected to decide early
 next week whether Duarte or Molina has won.
 There is no legal requirement that the decision be
 in favor of the person designated by the council
 as having received the larger number of votes. The
 Legislative Assembly is dominated by Molina's
 party (34 of the 52 seats), and it would normally
 be expected to elect Molina.
 The situation has become far from normal,
 however, and the final decision will probably be
 dictated by the military, the number one source
 of political power in the country. A coup is a
 possibility, but a solution within the constitu-
 tional framework would entail fewer risks. De-
 spite the military's distrust of the parties of the
 left and its anger over some of the coalition's
 campaign charges, the officer corps could support
 Duarte's succession under certain conditions if it
 becomes convinced that he actually won. Duarte
 would undoubtedly have to agree to complete
 disassociation from the Communists and a gradual
 approach to controversial subjects such as agrar-
 ian reform and unionization of rural work-
 ers.
 Ecuador: Rodriguez Takes Hold
 President Rodriguez has dealt successfully
 with the first major controversy within his admin-
 istration. The dispute, which surfaced in his first
 week in office, was touched off when it became
 apparent he planned to act on his own, consulting
 only army colleagues, rather than through a gov-
 ernment council made up of the commanders of
 the army, navy, and air force. The navy and air
 force commanders protested bitterly and re-
 signed.

 Replacements have been named, and the
 council has been reorganized-at Rodriguez' di-
 rection-to remove another point of friction, this
 time between council members and Minister of
 Defense Aulestia. Aulestia took the position that
 he could not report to a government council
 made up of the three commanders while he was in
 theory their military superior. To solve this sticky
 question of protocol, each service chief now will
 designate a representative to serve on the council.
 A third problem, the discrimination against
 the navy and air force in the allocation of cabinet
 posts, could cause continued resentment. The
 new commanders of the air force and navy prob-
 ably will be somewhat stronger than their prede-
 cessors, but the army will continue to dominate
 the government. The new navy chief has been
 responsible for enforcing Ecuadorean policy
 against US tuna boats, but he reportedly has been
 helpful to US officials within the constraints
 imposed by that policy. The new air force chief
 reportedly is a political moderate who is friendly
 to the US.
 The fact that Rodriguez won this initial
 showdown will increase his power in the short
 run; in any event, he can stay in office as long as
 he retains the support of important army units.
 At the same time, lack of military unity will
 hamper the execution of his policies. If, in the
 long run, the navy and air force become too
 obstructive, army officers who want to set Ecua-
 dor on a progressive course may replace Rod-
 riguez with someone who can command wider
 support.
 Uruguay: Opposing Bordaberry
 The electoral court has officially proclaimed
 Juan Maria Bordaberry president-elect of Uruguay
 after two and a half months of vote counting.
 Bordaberry does not begin his five-year term until
 1 March, but his administration already appears
 headed for trouble with the Congress and hostile
 labor unions.
 On the first day
 of its session, the new
 Chamber of Deputies
 chose a member of the
 Blanco opposition to
 be its leader. Although
 the new congressional
 alignment gives the
 Colorados a slim lead
 over the Blancos in
 both houses, members
 of the leftist Frente
 Amplio coalition re-
 portedly supported the
 President-Elect Bordaberry:
 Headed for Trouble
 Blanco candidate. Voting in the Uruguayan legis-
 lature traditionally has been split among the nu-
 merous political factions rather than along major
 party lines, and efforts to obtain a majority prob-
 ably will have to be renewed on each specific
 issue.
 While congressional confusion has long char-
 acterized Uruguayan politics, Bordaberry's prob-
 lems may be compounded by the animosity of his
 defeated Blanco opponent, Wilson Ferreira. Fer-
 reira, who probably will head the largest Senate
 coalition, has denounced the election results as
 fraudulent. Bordaberry, however, is attempting to
 improve  inter-party  relations and has invited
 Ferreira and the other Blanco leaders to join his
 administration "in any form they find accept-
 able." The president-elect specifically requested
 Blanco collaboration on the major issues of public
 safety, education, and regulation of the leftist
 press.
 In addition to these political difficulties, the
 Communist-dominated  labor confederation has
 attacked the new president in its report on the
 labor movement, adopted late last month. Al-
 though this latest diatribe contains nothing new,
 it establishes the foundation for a continuation of
 the policy of repeated labor-government prob-
 lems. A general work stoppage is scheduled for 14
 March, at which time labor leaders will present
 their demands to Congress.

 Bordaberry and his running mate, Jorge
 Sapelli, were both strong supporters of President
 Pacheco and can be expected to follow the gen-
 eral lines of his conservative policies. Although
 Bordaberry has yet to establish a clear national
 image, he has maintained closer ties than his
 predecessor with other Colorado leaders, in-

 Colorado List 15 group. One of Battle's chief
 lieutenants appears certain to get the Economic

 US-Venezuela Relations Strained
 Compulsive politicking by the Christian
 Democratic administration is making it difficult
 to halt the deterioration of US-Venezuelan rela-
 tions. Even though some leaders, notably busi-
 nessmen, are unhappy with the trend, the Caldera
 government is working on the assumption that
 legislative and rhetorical assaults on the foreign
 oil companies are a fail-safe method of pleasing
 the general public. Caldera further seems to be-
 lieve that the US, being inured to anti-American
 invective and in need of Venezuelan oil, has a
 high tolerance for this sort of surging nationalism.
 Several anti-US incidents have occurred over
 the past two weeks for which the Caldera gov-
 ernment has expressed regret, but largely for US
 consumption. The Christian  Democrats, for
 example, officially deplored the burning of an
 American flag, though their youth organization is
 known to have been responsible and though a
 party leader gave a highly inflammatory anti-
 American speech at the burning. Also, the min-
 ister of mines has again charged that declining oil
 production is a result of a conspiracy by the
 foreign firms, and the education minister linked
 recent student violence to interference by the oil
 companies. This latter charge was retracted fully
 only in Caracas' English-language daily.
 Caldera's own view was illuminated in an
 interview with a US journalist last week. Caldera
 judges that US energy requirements demand a
 secure source of fuel and that since Venezuela can
 fill this need, the US will continue to buy from
 Venezuela at least at the current volume. Given
 this necessary relationship, Caldera sees no reason
 why Venezuela cannot enjoy a guaranteed stable
 market for its oil "at prices comparable to those
 for petroleum produced in the US."
 President Caldera also continues to tell the
 public that he plans no retreat from the nation-
 alist position he has taken in defense of Vene-
 zuelan resources. This approach and the repeated
 denunciations of alleged pressure tactics by the
 oil companies do little to ease the strains in
 US-Venezuelan relations and may point to further
 trouble ahead. The next clue to the progression of
 bilateral relations is likely to surface in Caldera's
 state of the union message next week.

 Cuba: Looking at Guantanamo
 Since last November, Castro's government
 has been showing unusual interest in the subject
 of the US naval presence at Guantanamo. The
 communique issued at the end of Kosygin's visit
 to Cuba on 1 November mentioned "US-encour-
 aged hostile actions," and referred to the "unlaw-
 ful presence of the North American military base
 at Guantanamo." Soon thereafter, the Cuban
 military magazine,  Verde Olivo,  made similar
 charges, and Havana television carried a special
 documentary along the same general lines.

 tional support for the ouster of US forces from

 Youth on a ceremonial round-island tour and
 accompanied by a small gunboat intended to put
 in at Caimanera. There was good reason to
 suspect that such a plan, which would necessitate
 sailing through waters of the US naval base, had
 been engineered to dramatize Cuba's Guantanamo
 claim by provoking US authorities into denying
 transit to the Cuban gunboat. According to treaty
 arrangements governing the base, Cuban military
 vessels may not enter the US base. In any event,
 the merchant vessels bypassed the base and went
 on to Baracoa, and the gunboat turned back
 before reaching the entrance to Guantanamo Bay.
 the naval facility, Castro told Chilean reporters in
 early December that he viewed the US presence in
 Guantanamo as a "dagger stuck in the heart."
 "There are many accounts to be settled and some
 day we will have to demand payment," he added.
 The only solution, he said, was for the US to pull
 out, since the "base served no purpose from a
 military point of view." Castro said, "We will let
 them stay in Guantanamo until they get bored."
 At a press conference in Guayaquil on 4 Decem-
 ber, Castro commented that Cuba "is saddled
 with a United States naval base" and that the
 same situation occurs in Panama with the case of
 the canal.

 Cuba continually monitors the activities of the

 intends to gain "rightful" control over Guan-

 will undertake hostile actions against the base.

 Chile: Allende Strikes Back
 President Allende will invoke his broad con-
 stitutional powers to fight the opposition's latest
 move to curb the nationalization of private indus-
 try. He will veto important sections of a constitu-
 tional amendment passed on 19 February that
 requires legislative approval of each nationaliza-
 tion. He insists that a two-thirds congressional
 majority is necessary to override his veto. The
 opposition claims that only a simple majority is
 required and that the President's only recourse
 thereafter would be a plebiscite on the issue
 which he would lose. Allende has declared that
 instead of a plebiscite his recourse would be to
 the constitutional tribunal. The recently estab-
 lished tribunal's decisions have most often ac-
 cepted Allende's position, in part because Chilean
 constitutional law is vague, flexible, and favorable
 to presidential prerogatives.
 Allende's crack
 legal adviser, former
 political conservative
 Eduardo Novoa, is a
 constitutional expert.
 He has dug up for-
 gotten decrees issued
 by a short-lived So-
 cialist government in
 the 1930s to facilitate
 some of the already ef-
 fected  nationali-
 zations. He is the ar-

 zation of US copper interests and the justification
 for lack of compensation.

 After marking time for nearly five years, Communist China again is expanding its
 presence in Africa. Since October 1970, five African governments have established diplo-
 matic relations with Peking. When the two others now in the process do so, the Chinese
 Communists will be ahead of the rival Chinese Nationalist regime in the contest for
 recognition. When the UN General Assembly voted to admit the People's Republic of China
 to the world body, Peking received most of the African ballots. Along with these diplomatic
 gains, there has been a considerable increase in Chinese economic aid to African nations.
 Transforming such short-range political profit into long-term influence will depend on
 a number of factors: the effectiveness and continued generosity of Peking's economic aid,
 the ability of the Chinese to allay African fears of subversion, conditions and events within
 Africa, and Peking's ability to find issues on which China and the African regimes can unite.
 China undoubtedly will continue to give priority to its relationships with the US, the USSR,
 Japan, and Europe, but in Peking's effort to alter power relationships in the world, Africa
 has a definite, if limited, part to play.
 The Early Years
 Africa first attracted the attention of the
 Chinese Communists in the mid-1950s, when the
 European powers came under increasing pressure
 to grant independence to their colonies. Taking
 advantage of the surge in African nationalist senti-
 ment, Peking stressed its opposition to imperial-
 ism, offering moral and, on occasion, material
 support to African national liberation move-
 ments. In May 1956, Egypt's President Nasir,
 sensing a potential source of support in his devel-
 oping dispute with Britain and France over the
 status of the Suez Canal, became the first ruler on
 the African continent to recognize Mao's regime.
 Peking's aid to the nationalist rebels in Algeria
 paid off in 1962 when the newly independent
 government established diplomatic relations with
 China.
 Peking's efforts to assert itself as a revolu-
 tionary model for African independence move-
 ments and to forge diplomatic, economic, and
 political ties with the more radical of the newly
 independent African states set the stage for
 increased competition with the USSR, and, as
 Sino-Soviet differences widened during the 1960s,
 rivalry for influence in Africa increased. Peking's
 attempt to preserve its ideological purity and out-
 bid Moscow in revolutionary appeal, however,
 soon adversely affected Chinese diplomacy. Once
 in power, most African nationalists, who wel-
 comed Chinese political and material aid during
 their struggle for independence, gave a chilly
 response to the Chinese cries for continued social
 revolution that Peking felt compelled to sound as
 part of its contest with Moscow for ideological
 leadership of the Communist movement.
 Nevertheless, as an increasing number of
 African colonies gained independence during the
 early 1960s, China stepped up its efforts to gain
 influence, mainly to match Soviet moves. The
 Chinese were also trying to counter the rival over-
 tures of the Nationalist regime on Taiwan and
 reduce US influence on the continent. As Chinese
 diplomatic missions on the continent grew in
 number, a modest foreign aid program was in-
 augurated to woo African governments and
 enhance Peking's prestige. High-ranking Chinese
 leaders, such as Premier Chou En-lai and Foreign
 Minister Chen I, made personal tours in Africa.
 African delegations were encouraged to visit Pe-
 king, and promising African revolutionaries were
 cultivated  and  occasionally given  training  in

 China. By 1965, 15 African countries had diplo-
 matic relations with Communist China.
 Starting in 1965, China's steady, if modest,
 progress in Africa began to slow down. African
 leaders resented Chinese efforts to use them as
 political weapons in the widening quarrel between
 Peking and Moscow. A major reason for the can-
 cellation of the Afro-Asian conference planned
 for Algiers in 1965 was the desire of many Afri-
 can leaders to avoid association with any Chinese
 effort to turn the meeting against the USSR.
 Peking's doctrinaire support of revolutionary
 action cast suspicion on its motives. In some
 cases, such as their backing of the radical Lu-
 mumba and Mulele uprisings in the Congo (now
 Zaire), the Chinese appear to have overestimated
 the  revolutionary  potential  of  the  situation.
 Revelations-some of them concocted-of Chinese
 complicity in subversion aimed at overthrowing
 independent regimes, as in Burundi, alarmed
 many African leaders. Close Chinese ties with
 such national leaders as Ghana's Nkrumah meant
 that when those leaders were ousted, Chinese
 influence suffered.
 Peking also discovered that diplomatic ties,
 modest Chinese economic aid, and ideological
 rhetoric were no match for the larger amounts of
 economic and military assistance available to Afri-
 can governments from Moscow and the West. In
 Algeria, for example, Peking was unable to com-
 pete with the large Soviet military and economic
 aid commitment. Nor was the prospect of Chinese
 political support on international issues attractive
 enough to win over more African regimes. Peking
 lacked the superpower status and political punch
 of the US or USSR.
 African uneasiness over Peking's policies in-
 creased with the unfolding of the Cultural Revo-
 lution. The Chinese at that time appeared almost
 completely engrossed with domestic concerns and
 presented an image of internal instability. All of
 China's ambassadors, with the exception of the
 one in Cairo, were called home. In only one
 instance,  however,  was there  a  break  in
 diplomatic relations between an African nation
 and Peking during the most tumultuous stage of
 Special Report
 the Cultural Revolution. In 1967, after Tunisian
 complaints about Chinese propaganda activities
 and Chinese accusations that Tunsia wished to
 wreck relations, Peking closed its embassy. Peking
 was otherwise generally able to isolate its basic
 interests in Africa from the effects of the up-
 heaval, "although Chinese prestige and influence
 undoubtedly suffered. The major effect of the
 Cultural Revolution in Africa was to curtail the
 extension of new Chinese economic aid and to
 put a moratorium on further expansion of Pe-
 king's  diplomatic  relations.  After  Mauritania
 recognized Communist China in July 1965, no
 other African government entered into diplomatic
 relations with Peking for over five years.
 In 1969, the restoration of order at home
 and the adoption of a more pragmatic and flexi-
 ble approach to foreign policy laid the ground-
 work  for a renewal of China's campaign to
 increase its presence and influence in Africa.
 Chinese ambassadors began returning to their
 posts. Peking's economic effort on the continent
 was given new impetus; in 1970, China extended
 $452.8 million in new economic aid to African
 regimes, far exceeding its previous aid to Africa.
 The commitment to finance and build the Tan-
 zania-Zambia railway accounted for most of this
 total ($401.2 million), but Guinea ($10 million)
 and Sudan ($41.6 million) were given a slice of
 the pie. Continuing its version of dollar diplo-
 macy into 1971, China extended new economic
 aid to Somalia ($109 million), Ethiopia ($84 mil-
 lion), Sudan ($40 million), Algeria ($40 million)
 and Mauritania ($20.5 million). In Mali, Peking
 indicated its interest in financing and constructing
 the $100 million Manantalli dam project.
 A New Approach to Revolution
 Since 1969, Peking's answer to the problem
 of differences between the demands of its African
 policy conducted in a world of nation states and
 the demands of its revolutionary ideology has
 been to downplay the ideological factor and to
 operate on a more pragmatic basis. In effect, the
 goal of social revolution has been retained but put
 off into the indefinite future. Chinese policy now
 emphasizes the cultivation of good state-to-state

 relations with any government willing to recog-
 nize Mao's regime as the sole legitimate govern-
 ment                     of  China.  No ideological strings are
 attached, and Peking does not demand that other
 governments support its position vis-a-vis the
 USSR. Communist China's leadership apparently
 accepts the fact that non-Communist, nationalist
 regimes are in power throughout Africa and are
 likely to remain indefinitely. Naturally, the Chi-
 nese are pleased when an African regime adopts a
 radical position, as in Guinea or Congo (Brazza-
 ville). Nevertheless, while publicly applauding
 such measures as the nationalization of various
 sectors of the African economy, Peking has
 demonstrated considerable private caution. Chi-
 nese officials have warned various African regimes
 of the dangers of going too far, too fast in
 remaking their economies. Chinese spokesmen
 also have reminded African leaders hungry for
 economic aid that China's capacity to help them
 is limited, implying that they should not cut
 themselves off from other sources of assistance.
 China's adoption of a flexible, pragmatic
 policy emphasizing good state relations has paid
 off in wider acceptance of Mao's regime by Afri-
 can states. In turn, diplomatic recognition by
 African governments helps buttress the interna-
 tional legitimacy of the Peking government and
 undermine that of its rival on Taiwan. African
 regimes are encouraged to believe that they can
 do business with Peking without fear of Chinese-
 sponsored subversion. In the long run, the Chi-
 nese obviously hope that increased international
 prestige and acceptance will be translated into
 support for Peking's moves directed at altering its
 power relationships with the US and the Soviet
 Union.
 Peking loses no opportunity to establish the
 image of China as a champion of third-world-
 hence, African-interests against those of the two
 superpowers. Chinese propaganda hits hard on the
 theme that Washington and Moscow are "con-
 tending and colluding" in order to divide the
 world between them, that Soviet and US eco-
 nomic and military aid are given with ulterior
 motives, and that Afro-Asian (and Latin Ameri-
 can) countries should "get united" to oppose the
 Special Report
 schemes of the two superpowers to block the
 attainment of complete political and economic
 independence. Peking, which repeatedly pledges
 never to behave as a superpower, looks for con-
 crete issues of importance to Africans on which
 China can take the lead. For example, China
 supports African anti-colonial moves in the UN,
 approved the Security Council decision to hold a
 session on African problems in Addis Ababa, and
 keeps up a drumf ire of criticism against the white
 governments in Rhodesia and South Africa. If
 possible, Peking attempts to select issues that
 involve the interests of as wide a range of third-
 world countries as possible. Thus, Chinese sup-
 port of the claim of several African countries to a
 200-nautical-mile limit for territorial waters, a
 matter of even greater concern to most South
 American states, was included in the communique
 of July 1971 summarizing the visit of a govern-
 ment delegation from Sierra Leone. Later the
 same month, the communique marking the end of
 the visit of the Algerian foreign minister called for
 a "Mediterranean for the Mediterranean states,"
 obliquely criticizing the presence of both the US
 and Soviet fleets in the area.
 Current Chinese pronouncements stress the
 African states' struggle to protect their sover-
 eignty and interests in the face of "imperialism,
 neo-colonialism, and  racism." Peking is fully
 aware of the damage done to its position in Africa
 by its past association with subversive move-
 ments. The Chinese quickly, and probably truth-
 fully, denied charges made in the summer of 1971
 by Uganda's President Amin that they were aiding
 exiled President Obote in his plans to return to
 power.
 There is no good current evi- 25X1

 ganda support to any movements aimed at over-
 throwing blackor Arab regimes in Africa. Indeed,
 as demonstrated by Chinese criticism of the
 Soviet Union's alleged meddling in the internal
 affairs of the Sudan, Peking is attempting to turn
 the tables on those who continue to label it
 subversive.

 China maintains the revolutionary basis of
 its African policy by supporting liberation move-
 ments directed against white rule in Portuguese
 Africa, Rhodesia, and the Republic of South
 Africa. Peking furnishes arms and training to the
 Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) based
 in Tanzania, and a small amount of arms have
 been given to the rebels in Portuguese Guinea.
 The FRELIMO leader, Samora Moises Machel,
 visited Peking in late summer 1971, and further
 Chinese aid probably was discussed. The Chinese
 have given limited amounts of aid to two smaller
 groups, the Mozambique Revolutionary Com-
 mittee and the Partisan Liberation Union of
 Mozambique, in an effort to maintain wide con-
 tacts within the anti-Portuguese liberation move-
 ments.
 The chairman of the Popular Movement for
 the Liberation of Angola made his pilgrimage to
 Peking in July 1971, and he may have secured
 promises of Chinese support in the form of sup-
 plies and training by Chinese instructors in Tan-
 zania. The Chinese also have given token amounts
 of aid to the National Union for Total Inde-
 pendence of Angola. Peking furnishes funds and
 military training in Tanzania to the Zimbabwe
 African National Union, an organization seeking
 the overthrow of the present regime in Rhodesia.
 Ideological and organizational splits have
 undermined the political and military impact of
 the various liberation movements, particularly
 those in Rhodesia, and Peking probably discounts
 their ability to overthrow colonial or white rule in
 the foreseeable future. After seeing their aid to
 various African revolutionaries frittered away in
 the early and mid-1960s, the Chinese apparently
 have  decided to  give only relatively modest
 amounts of aid to such groups, at least until these
 organizations prove to have created effective,
 well-disciplined movements with a chance of
 eventual success.
 Chinese influence among the African libera-
 tion movements faces several limiting factors.
 Many of the movements, such as in Portuguese
 Guinea, receive aid from the USSR which their
 leaders are loath to jeopardize. The thought of
 Mao Tse-tung may inspire some African leaders
 intellectually and emotionally and interest them
 as a general guide to military and political action
 in a "people's war," but none of these leaders is
 an out-and-out Maoist, and all are ardent national-
 ists. None of them appears susceptible to firm
 Chinese control, even if Peking should attempt to
 exert it. Finally, Chinese efforts to influence the
 liberation movements are restricted by the atti-
 tudes of the African states that play host to the
 rebels. For example, in view of Peking's efforts to
 court the Nyerere regime, it is highly unlikely
 that the Chinese would go against his wishes in
 dealing with FRELIMO.
 Given these limitations, which are aggravated
 by China's remoteness from the scene of action,
 the Chinese are contenting themselves with being
 more of an inspirational force to the movements.
 Chinese propaganda stresses the necessity for each
 movement to be self-reliant, to build a base of
 local popular support, and to adopt its tactics to
 the local social and political environment.
 The Chinese have no qualms about reducing
 or even abandoning their propaganda or material
 support of an African liberation movement, if
 such an action helps cement good relations with
 an African government. Peking ceased propa-
 gandizing for the Eritrean Liberation Front sev-
 eral months before China began recognition talks
 with Ethiopia, and, since the establishment of
 diplomatic relations, Peking has severely cut back
 and probably ended support for the Eritrean
 rebels. Suspension of aid, never very great in
 absolute terms, was one of the main conditions
 set by Ethiopia as the price of recognition, and
 the Chinese apparently paid the price with alac-
 rity in order to gain a presence in an important

 African state. During Emperor Haile Selassie's
 visit to Peking in October 1971, the Chinese lead-
 ership emphatically reassured their guest that
 their aid to the Eritrean Liberation Front had
 ended.
 Peking's decision to accept the necessity of
 dealing with  the existing  African  nationalist
 regimes is paralleled by a decision to write off as a
 potential source of support the few existing-and
 in almost every case illegal-African Communist
 parties. Most of the parties have generally been
 ineffectual and have lined up behind Moscow in
 the Sino-Soviet ideological split, making it easier
 for the Chinese to write them off as revisionists.
 Peking's utter indifference to African Communist
 parties is illustrated by its reaction to the fate of
 the Sudanese Communists. China did not join the
 Soviet and East European chorus protesting Presi-
 dent Numayri's violent suppression of the Sudan-
 ese party.
 IThe Chinese
 ambassador waste  irst foreign representative
 received by him after his restoration to power.
 Peking has nearly doubled its economic assistance
 to his regime and has signed a military protocol
 with Khartoum. Chinese national interest in gain-
 ing influence at the expense of the USSR in a
 major African state clearly overrode ideological
 considerations.
 If Peking has written off the existing Com-
 munist parties, there is still the question of why
 the Chinese have made no great effort to en-
 courage the formation of pro-Peking Communist
 movements in Africa. One deterrent to such a
 move is the bias toward "European Communism"
 in the African movement. Particularly in French-
 speaking Africa, most of the recruits to Com-
 munist or other ultraradical views have undergone
 ideological conversion under European influence.
 During the colonial era, the embryonic African
 Communist parties were in a sense an extension
 overseas of the Communist movements in the
 Special Report
 metropole. An equally strong factor is Peking's
 view of the prospects of African Communism.
 The Chinese very likely do not regard the situa-
 tion as ripe for the launching of African Com-
 munist parties, which in their view cannot be
 organized from outside but must evolve according
 to the circumstances in each state. Rather than
 engage in futile efforts to encourage chimerical
 Communist movements, Peking has chosen to
 support selected radical African leaders or nation-
 alist movements and to await developments more
 favorable to the organization of pro-Chinese par-
 ties.
 Since the renewed expansion of Chinese
 activity in Africa in 1970, most of China's new
 economic aid has gone to regimes that already
 have recognized the People's Republic. In part,
 this generosity is meant to impress African leaders
 who do not recognize China with the tangible
 benefits to be gained by good relations. Ethiopia 25X1
 and Equatorial Guinea concluded economic aid
 agreements with China within a year after reco -
 nizing Peking.
 Peking
 uses its foreign aia as more than just a lure for
 recognition.  Provision of aid helps project an
 image of a dynamic, expanding, and modern
 Chinese economy that will serve both as an in-
 spiration and source of help for underdeveloped
 nations.
 The Chinese are well-suited by experience
 and the level of their technology to build basic
 projects-roads, railroads, dams, ports, light in-
 dustry, and agricultural and medical facilities--so
 badly needed by many African nations. The tech-
 nologically more sophisticated Western donors
 often will not match Peking's financial terms,
 which include mainly no interest credits with
 repayment  over  a  long  term  following  a

 substantial grace period. Chinese aid has been well
 received by most of its African recipients. The
 Chinese have a reputation for hard work, fru-
 gality, and living within the local economy. The
 scarcity of African complaints about Chinese
 ideological proselytizing in connection with the
 aid programs suggests that Peking is treading with
 circumspection. Moreover, the Chinese are willing
 to undertake economically dubious projects if
 they believe that the political gains will justify the
 burden.
 China's economic competition with the West
 or the USSR is limited by its own economic
 deficiencies. In Africa, Chinese economic aid has
 surpassed that given by the Soviet Union in onl
 seven countries.
 image by recalling past Chinese association with
 subversion and, on occasion, by meeting the
 Chinese in head-on competition, as in Somalia,
 where the recent Soviet agreement to finance a
 large agricultural development project obviously
 is meant to offset increased Chinese economic
 aid.
 Moscow's competition probably will not
 deter an increasing number of African regimes
 from seeking Chinese economic assistance in the
 future. Almost all African regimes profess to fol-
 low a nonaligned foreign policy, and acceptance
 of Chinese aid helps reinforce this image. Al-
 though there probably are few African leaders
 who have any illusions about China's ability to
 replace the West or the USSR as an economic
 patron, Peking's assistance is welcome, not only
 in its own right but also as a device to counter-
 balance any Western or Soviet presence, and as a
 bargaining tool with which to negotiate elsewhere
 for more aid on better terms. The Malian regime,
 for example, appears to be trying to play off
 China, France, and the USSR in an effort to
 secure greater economic aid.
 Military Aid
 Most African states also retain important eco-
 nomic ties with their former colonial rulers; there
 is still considerable French economic interest in
 west and central Africa, and the United Kingdom
 is an important trade partner for its former Afri-
 can possessions, including Tanzania and Zambia.
 Chinese aid activities, particularly in Ethiopia and
 Somalia, have succeeded in arousing Soviet
 apprehension.  Moscow's representatives have
 attempted to blacken Peking's new pragmatic
 of their new military equipment.
 Peking's use of military aid as a supplement
 to its larger economic effort is more sparing.

 Apart from Tanzania, no African govern-
 ment has received large amounts of military aid
 from Peking since 1960. The agreement con-
 cluded in July 1971 between China and Guinea
 calls for Peking to supply only several small patrol
 boats and an undetermined amount of arms and
 ammunition. Despite the signing of a military aid
 agreement with Congo (Brazzaville) in September
 1971-which will bring in Chinese tanks and
 "heavy equipment," and send some military
 personnel to China for training-the Congolese
 receive most of their military equipment from the
 USSR. The Chinese have been well received, how-
 ever, garnering considerable prestige from a
 modest amount of aid.
 Prospectus
 Locked in a competition with the US and
 the USSR in the changing world power balance,
 Peking is likely to continue to take advantage of
 Africa's underdeveloped economies and endemic
 political instability to expand its influence and
 secure African political support. How well the
 Chinese do will depend on a number of factors.
 Fifteen years of expanding involvement in Africa
 have given  Peking certain  intangible assets-
 experience in the area, contacts with several
 important African leaders, such as Nyerere and
 Kaunda, and a greater understanding of the
 region's complex social and political structure.
 These assets have not always been well used-
 witness the setbacks dealt the Chinese during the
 mid-1960s-but Peking's increasing experience in
 Africa suggests that its policies and activities there
 are likely to become more sophisticated in the
 years ahead. The turn toward a pragmatic policy
 after 1969 has paid off in an expanding Chinese
 presence, yet Peking, by backing selected national
 Special Report
 liberation groups, has managed to retain its revo-
 lutionary aura.
 Transforming these assets into long-term
 political gains is a more uncertain process. The
 Chinese must continue to make good on their
 promises of economic aid and to show African
 leaders that China's support is valuable in attain-
 ing their sometimes competing national objec-
 tives. A major factor shaping the future of China
 in Africa is, of course, the unpredictability of
 events on the continent  itself. The fall  of
 Nkrumah, which wiped out the political gains
 Peking had made in Ghana, and the failure last
 year of the attempted coup in the Sudan, which
 opened up a new opportunity for expandinr25X1
 Chinese influence, are cases in point.
 So far, China's ability to influence develop-
 ments in Africa has been very limited. No African
 regime or liberation movement appears about to
 adopt the Maoist model of society in toto, and,
 given the intensity of the African desire for
 independence, it is unlikely that any African
 regime will allow itself to become completely
 dependent on Peking. African leaders are more
 likely to become increasingly skillful in balancing
 the competing pressures from the West, the
 USSR, and China.
 But as long as Peking supports important
 African objectives, avoids a repetition of med-
 dling in subversive activities within black and
 Arab African nations, and offers cheap economic
 and military aid, it probably will continue to
 make modest aains.
