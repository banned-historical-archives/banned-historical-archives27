 LEBANON
 President Sarkis named Salim Ahmad
 al-Huss, a close adviser on economic
 matters, as Lebanon's prime minister on
 December 8.  The appointment un-
 derscores Sarkis' preference for a cabinet
 composed of loyal technocrats and his
 determination to remain as free as possi-
 ble of old-line political factions as he
 works on the economic reconstruction of
 Lebanon.
 Conservative Muslim and Christian
 leaders, especially National Liberal Party
 chief Camille Shamun, have been pressing
 Sarkis to establish a government con-
 taining representatives of all the major
 religious and political groups, as
 Lebanese presidents traditionally have
 done. The Conservative leaders hope to
 circumscribe the President's freedom of
 action and protect their own vested in-
 terests.
 Little headway was made this week in
 resolving the related questions of the in-
 troduction of Syrian peacekeeping forces
 into southern Lebanon and the collection
 of heavy weapons from the various
 Lebanese and Palestinian militias. Sarkis
 is unlikely to be able to persuade the
 Christians to give up their arms or to stop
 stockpiling additional weapons until Arab
 peacekeeping forces are in a position to
 cut off the flow of arms still coming into
 Tyre and to begin rounding up arms in the
 hands of Palestinian and leftist elements
 in southern Lebanon.
 Israel reportedly remains adamantly
 opposed to the movement of Syrian
 troops or any other non-Lebanese force
 into the south to occupy the Palestinian
 and leftist strongholds of Tyre and
 Nabatiyah. The Rabin government may,
 for reasons of domestic political expedien-
 cy, consider it necessary to take a tough
 stand against Syria.   The Israelis,
 moreover, do not want the Syrians to es-
 tablish a toehold in southern Lebanon
 even if the Syrian forces do not represent
 an immediate threat for fear that they
 might not withdraw later.
 The Israelis may also believe that
 Syrian control over the south might make
 the Palestinians too much of a pliable tool
 of Syrian policy toward Israel. In any
 event, the Rabin government would clear-
 ly prefer to see its Christian allies, or a
 friendly Lebanese force of some sort, con-
 trol the border area, even if it means hav-
 ing to contend with occasional terrorist
 RHODESIA
 The Geneva conference on Rhodesia
 continues to focus on the mechanics of
 setting up an interim government, but
 there are still sharp differences among the
 black nationalist delegations, as well as
 between the nationalists and the Rhode-
 sian government delegation. Rhodesian
 Prime Minister Smith returned to Geneva
 this week to resume leadership of the
 government team.
 The Rhodesian guerrilla leaders who
 arrived in Geneva last week to participate
 in the settlement talks have been playing a
 low-key role as part of Robert Mugabe's
 nationalist delegation.
 Despite earlier indications that these
 men might challenge Mugabe's leadership
 of the Zimbabwe African National Union
 delegation, there has been no sign yet of
 such a move. The US mission in Geneva
 reports that Mugabe has appeared much
 more relaxed and confident since the
 arrival of the military leaders.
 Joshua Nkomo has told the US mis-
 sion that he believes the guerrillas can be
 more fully controlled now that their lead-
 ers are at the conference. He hopes to
 take advantage of their presence by
 resuming negotiations begun some time
 ago on military coordination between
 his own limited forces and the ZANU
 guerrillas.
 Despite the outward harmony, there are
 continuing reports of disunity within the
 Mugabe delegation and the ZANU fac-
 tion. The US mission reports that there
 may be as many as five basic subgroups
 within ZANU, and that Mugabe's delega-
 tion remains an extremely fragile coali-
 tion.

 The Soviet leadership will probably not
 allow the posts of first deputy minister of
 defense and commander in chief of the
 Warsaw Pact armed forces to remain va-
 cant very long.
 Marshal Yakubovsky, who held those
 posts, had been ill for some time before
 his death on November 30, and the Soviet
 leadership has had several months to con-
 sider the problem of replacing him.
 The new Warsaw Pact commander in
 chief will almost certainly be a Soviet
 military officer, despite occasional Roma-
 nian complaints about Soviet domination
 of the Warsaw Pact command structure.
 Like Yakubovsky, the new commander
 will also serve as a first deputy under
 Soviet Minister of Defense Ustinov.
 In the event of war, the Warsaw Pact
 commander would hold the highest field
 command position in the Soviet armed
 forces and would receive his orders from
 the Supreme High Command through the
 General Staff. In peacetime, he is the first
 deputy who usually fills in for the Soviet
 minister of defense when the latter is ab-
 sent.
 On a day-to-day basis, however, the
 chief of the General Staff may play a
 more important role in deciding policy
 matters or advising the Soviet minister of
 defense on various issues. The Warsaw
 Pact commander is away from Moscow
 much of the time, visiting the forces under
 his command in Eastern Europe or engag-
 ing in other activities that keep him in the
 limelight but away from meetings on im-
 portant defense questions.
 Any one of several high-ranking Soviet
 military leaders could be in the running
 for Yakubovsky's posts, but the most
 likely candidate is General Ivanovsky,
 commander of the Soviet Forces in Ger-
 many.
 Another name frequently mentioned in
 Moscow is General Ogarkov, a deputy
 minister of defense, who we believe to be
 working on systems analysis of Soviet
 defense needs.
 General Kulikov, chief of the Soviet
 General Staff, is yet another possibility.
 Other candidates for the top post in the
 Warsaw Pact command include Generals
 Pavlovsky, Kurkotkin, and Petrov.

 CI EC
 The participants in the Conference on
 International Economic Cooperation
 have decided to postpone the ministerial
 review scheduled for December 15. The
 conference was organized last year to dis-
 cuss energy issues and development
 problems.
 The conference chairmen, Allan
 Maceachen of Canada and Manuel Perez
 Guerrero of Venezuela, agreed last week
 to a compromise formula for delaying the
 meeting-a course favored by almost all
 of the participants-that circumvented at-
 tribution of responsibility for the delay.
 The cochairmen asked the representatives
 of the 27 countries participating either to
 acquiesce in or reject explicitly a decision
 postponing the ministerial meeting.
 The industrialized countries, particular-
 ly the Europeans, feared that the
 ministerial meeting might give the OPEC
 states grist for their arguments favoring
 the oil price increase that is widely ex-
 pected later this month. Many of the
 developing states, although disappointed
 with the lack of progress in the con-
 ference, think they may still obtain some
 of their demands in later negotiations and
 were thus not willing to jeopardize the
 scheduling of future talks.
 The change in US administrations and
 the lack of progress among the EC states
 on reaching an agreed position have been
 cited by industrialized and developing
 states as justifying a delay. Most par-
 ticipants, however, recognized that little
 substantive progress has in fact been
 made in the talks and that a ministerial
 conference would have almost inevitably
 degenerated into an acrimonious confron-
 tation.
 The principal differences between
 developed and developing countries in the
 CIEC discussions include:
 ? The OPEC countries, faced with ob-
 jections from all of the industrialized and
 some of the developing states, seek formal
 recognition of their right unilaterally to
 set oil prices.
 ? The industrialized and developing
 countries still disagree on how to maintain
 prices of raw materials while taking infla-
 tion into account, although the focus of
 the debate over this issue has shifted to
 forums of the UN Conference on Trade
 and Development.
 ? The industrialized countries have
 PORTUGAL 2 +-2_ 6
 The results of the local elections in Por-
 tugal on December 12, touted in some
 quarters as a referendum on Prime
 Minister Soares'  Socialist minority
 government, are not likely to show a
 significant shift in the relative strengths of
 the parties.
 The vote, the final step in the establish-
 ment of a democratic structure in Por-
 tugal, will fill some 50,000 positions in
 parish and municipal governing bodies.
 Nationwide results will be tabulated in a
 variety of ways, and each party will
 probably be able to find figures it can in-
 terpret in a favorable light.
 The two-week campaign has aroused
 little voter interest, and the turnout is like-
 ly to be lower than it was in the three elec-
 tions held during the past 20 months. The
 lack of interest is due in part to increasing
 public apathy toward politics, but even
 more to the shortage of funds available to
 most of the contending parties and the
 prohibition of radio and television cam-
 paigning.
 The Socialists will probably again
 receive around 35 percent of the vote, as
 refused to meet the developing countries'
 demands for automatic debt relief. The in-
 dustrialized countries and those develop-
 ing countries that depend on private credit
 advocate a case-by-case consideration of
 debt problems.
 ? The developing countries seek a
 specific timetable for each industrialized
 country to allocate seven tenths of one
 percent of its gross national product to
 they did in the legislative assembly elec-
 tion last spring. Disenchantment with the
 Socialists' temporizing, particularly in the
 economic field, is growing, but the party
 can probably use its control of govern-
 ment to offset any defections.
 The Socialists benefit from widespread
 media coverage that comes as a byproduct
 of their control of the government. Also,
 the election law was drafted by the
 Socialists to work in their favor. Local of-
 fices will be filled on a proportional basis,
 thus benefiting the Socialists who are
 relatively strong throughout the country.
 Perhaps the most significant contest is
 the one between the two parties to the
 right of the Socialists. Both have stepped
 up their criticism of the government in an
 effort to attract disgruntled Socialists.
 The conservative Social Democratic
 Center, however, has been more
 vituperative than the Social Democratic
 Party, which apparently thinks it may be
 asked to form a coalition with the
 Socialists. The showings of the two par-
 ties may provide some indication of the
 extent to which a vigorous antigovern-
 ment line is a good campaign tactic.
 The Communists will probably score
 the largest gains, regaining many of the
 votes lost to the far left last summer when
 the Communist presidential candidate
 polled less than 8 percent of the vote. The
 Communists are still likely to run fourth,
 however, with around 15 percent of the
 vote

 SPAIN `2
 Radicals failed this week in their efforts
 to move the Spanish Socialist Workers'
 Party further to the left, but the dilemmas
 facing the party remain unsolved.
 At the Socialist congress on December
 5 through 8, Felipe Gonzalez and other
 party leaders turned back radical
 demands that the Socialists refuse to sup-
 port the government's political reforms
 unless the government meets various
 tough conditions. The congress instead
 called for negotiations with the govern-
 ment to ensure that the legislative election
 next spring is not manipulated by en-
 trenched  rightists.  The question  of
 socialist participation in the election was
 left unresolved pending the outcome of
 the negotiations.
 As expected, the congress called for
 abstention in the referendum to be held on
 December 15. This is largely a sym-
 bolic gesture, however, because the gov-
 ernment is widely expected to win a com-
 fortable majority on its reform pro-
 posals.
 Party radicals may draw some comfort
 from the congress' pronouncements on
 foreign policy, although these largely
 reiterated earlier party positions. The
 congress called for a US withdrawal from
 its bases in Spain, denounced US
 "imperialism" in Latin America, con-
 demned the Spanish retreat from Western
 Sahara, and rejected both NATO and the
 Warsaw Pact.
 Privately, however, Socialist leaders
 have shown more flexibility on these
 issues, implying that the US bases and
 Spanish membership in NATO could be
 acceptable if they have the support of the
 Spanish people.
 After the emotional opening
 ceremonies, which featured distinguished
 foreign socialist leaders such as Francois
 Mitterrand, Olof Palme, and Willy
 Brandt, the congress settled down to the
 urgent business of patching up differences
 in the party.
 The Socialist Workers' Party has been
 weakened by internal conflicts in recent
 months as it searches for an identity that
 will distinguish it from the Communists
 without alienating important support. The
 rapid growth of the party over the past
 year has brought in many new members
 who are more radical than the leadership
 and also more radical than much of the
 party's  potential  constituency-white-
 collar workers, small businessmen, and
 blue-collar workers.
 Socialist leaders are torn between their
 principles, which commit them to support
 moves toward free elections, and their
 reading of the tactical political situation.
 They are concerned that their support for
 the government's program would allow
 the Communist Party to assert with some
 credibility that it is the only true represen-
 tative of the left.
 The congress' resolutions indicate that
 the Socialists have not resolved their
 dilemmas. The Socialists must come off
 the fence soon, however, and they are like-
 ly to lose potential supporters regardless

 close collaborator, Interior Minister
 Michel Poniatowski. The party has been
 struggling unsuccessfully to broaden its
 support in order to become a more effec-
 tive rival to the Gaullists.
 The party's sporadic efforts to merge
 with the other two members of the gover-
 ning "presidential majority"-the cen-
 trists and the Radical Socialists-were
 hampered most recently by the weakness
 that all three showed in the November
 by-elections. This made the Independent
 Republicans less attractive as a merger
 partner and made the other parties more
 reluctant to submerge their own identities
 Former French prime minister Jacques
 Chirac consolidated his control over the
 Gaullist party by pushing through a
 reorganization, ratified on December 5,
 that included:
 ? His election as the party's first
 president.
 ? A change in the party's name to
 Rally for the Republic.
 ? An overhaul of the party's gover-
 ning bodies to bring non-Gaullists into
 some advisory positions.
 Chirac's elevation will influence the
 maneuvering of both right and left for the
 legislative election in 1978 and introduce a
 new fluidity into French politics. It will
 also further stimulate a trend toward
 polarization of the center-right as both
 Chirac and President Giscard strive to at-
 tract new voters. Giscard's popularity is
 now lower than that of any president dur-
 ing the Fifth Republic; the Gaullists,
 elated by their two first-round victories in
 the legislative by-elections last month, are
 finding they have less and less in common
 with his policies.
 Giscard reorganized the leadership of
 his Independent Republican Party on
 December 2, naming as its president his

 POLAND
 The Poles have announced personnel
 shifts and changes in the five-year plan
 designed to help the leadership muddle
 through the next six to nine difficult
 months. Party chief Gierek and Prime
 Minister Jaroszewicz disclosed the
 changes at a Central Committee plenum
 and at a followup parliamentary session
 on December 2.
 On the policy side, the changes are
 designed-ultimately-to benefit the con-
 sumer. Investment funds are to be
 diverted from producer to consumer
 goods. As a result, housing construction,
 food production and processing, and the
 manufacture of other consumer goods are
 to be given increased emphasis.
 The regime promised private
 businessmen a more free and stable in-
 stitutional environment and increased
 government assistance. Gierek also
 sought to attract greater support from
 private farmers by saying that they will be
 able to purchase more land.
 The leadership did not promise any im-
 mediate relief from shortages of consumer
 goods. It faces the difficult task of trying
 to convince the population to wait from
 two to five years for the fulfillment of its
 hopes. In the meantime, the leadership
 will have to be particularly careful not to
 take any action that could provoke riots
 and strikes as happened last June.
 The personnel decisions will strengthen
 Gierek's hand in the party and the party's
 control over government technocrats.
 Although Prime Minister Jaroszewicz
 remains in power, most Polish and
 Western observers agree that he will
 probably be replaced sometime in the next
 six to nine months.
 Two men were promoted to the party
 secretariat. Stefan Olszowski resigned his
 position as foreign minister and Alojzy
 Karkoszka as deputy premier to take up
 positions in this key political and ad-
 ministrative body. Olszowski, who has
 returned to the mainstream of party life,
 will apparently be one of Gierek's key ad-
 visers.
 The two apparent losers were Jan
 Szydlak and Jozef Kepa, who became
 deputy premiers.
 Gierek has now moved them away from

 Mexico's new  vernment is trying to
 defuse a potentially dangerous situation
 by persuading peasants in the northwest
 state of Sinaloa to accept a promise that
 their land claims will be accommodated.
 According to press reports, some
 peasants withdrew peacefully on
 December 6 from the rich crop land they
 had occupied since last week, but many
 others refused to disperse. By week's end,
 police and army units were preparing to
 dislodge them by force. Peasant leaders
 and property owners met in Mexico City
 with government agrarian officials to
 work out a solution to the land invasions.
 An agreement will get President Lopez
 Portillo off to a good start in his efforts to
 restore confidence and revive the faltering
 economy. Businessmen strongly oppose
 any further land expropriations of the
 kind decreed by former president
 Echeverria last month. Lopez Portillo met
 with representatives from business and in-
 dustry this week in what was probably the
 first of a series of meetings aimed at con-
 vincing them that the country needs their
 help and that his administration un-
 derstands their problems.
 Although the new president will have to
 implement the massive expropriation of
 100,000 hectares carried out by
 Echeverria in the state of Sonora, he
 reportedly wants to avoid such radical
 measures in the future.
 Reaction to Lopez Portillo's inaugura-
 tion address from bankers and
 businessmen has been generally favorable.
 They welcomed his promises to
 streamline  the  complex  federal
 bureaucracy, cut government spending,
 and reduce foreign borrowing. Lopez Por-
 tillo acted quickly to secure the support of
 business leaders by announcing that he
 would authorize private investments in the
 country's basic industries, such as
 petrochemical and iron and steel. These

 industries are now almost completely con-
 trolled by the state. Labor union officials,
 perceiving a less populist cast to the new
 administration, have received the promis-
 ed changes coolly. They plan to press for
 large wage increases next month.
 The peaceful and orderly transfer of
 power from the ambitious and
 provocative Echeverria to Lopez Portillo
 has in itself contributed to dispelling the
 atmosphere of crisis surrounding the in-
 auguration. The beleaguered peso
 responded to the changeover by rising to
 20.50 to the US dollar at the start of this
 week-its best level since late October.
 Lopez Portillo's honeymoon will
 probably continue until early in the new
 year. Although the President has said that
 he will need time to deal with pressing
 economic and social problems, dis-

 CUBA    `I     q
 The basic power structure in Cuba
 remains virtually unaltered despite the
 far-reaching institutional changes the
 government has  undergone in the past
 week.  Fidel Castro-Cuba's new
 president-is in supreme command, and
 his younger brother Raul is the un-
 challenged number-two man in the
 regime.
 Osvaldo Dorticos was removed not
 only from the presidency, which he had
 held since 1959, but also from his post as
 chief of the Central Planning Board. The
 board is now headed by a young Soviet-
 trained protege of Raul Castro's. Dor-
 Brazil: Gelsel's Image Enhanced
 ticos remains on the 31-member Council
 of State and is a vice president of the new-
 ly appointed Council of Ministers. Health
 problems, rather than political dif-
 ficulties, are the probable explanation for
 his less prominent standing.
 One significant change is the removal
 of Raul Roa as foreign minister in favor
 of Isidoro Malmierca Peoli. Roa's
 age-he will be 70 in April-and health
 were probably factors in the change.
 Malmierca is 46, has traveled extensively
 abroad, speaks English, and was a
 member of the pre-Castro communist
 party. If the Cuban regime intends to try
 to improve relations with the US, it might
 find Malmierca a more  appropriate
 negotiator than the acerbic, bitterly an-
 ti-US Roa.
 The rest of the leaders continue to be
 those who have been close to Castro for
 years. All of the members of the party's
 Political Bureau, for example, are
 members of the governing Council of
 State.
 The chiefs of the various mass
 organizations were also made members of
 the Council of State, but this is merely a
 formalization of the close relationship
 they previously had with the regime
 leadership. The second- and third-ranking
 officials of the Armed Forces Ministry,
 both of whom served in Angola, have
 seats on the Council of State.
 Veteran Communist Bias Roca and
 Raul Roa were "elected" president and
 vice president, respectively, of the
 National People's Assembly, which was
 in session on December 2 and 3. The short
 duration of the Assembly's session, in
 spite of the amount of business at hand,
 indicates that real authority lies with the
 Council of State, even though the
 Assembly is theoretically the senior of the
 two bodies.
 The Council of State, of which Fidel
 Castro is president, functions as the
 supreme organ of government when the
 National People's Assembly is not in ses-
 sion. Castro clearly has no intention of
 allowing the 481-member Assembly to
 play a major role in day-to-day governing.
 The returns from Brazil's nationwide
 municipal elections, held November 15,
 have enhanced President Geisel's image.
 Tensions among conservative military
 leaders critical of Geisel's gradual moves
 toward political liberalization have been
 reduced by the strong support won by the
 pro-government party. The President now
 can claim an election mandate for his in-
 novative approach to major policy issues.
 In the past, the local contests for ap-
 proximately 4,000 municipal council seats
 and nearly as many mayorships have been
 politically insignificant. Early this year,
 however, Geisel elevated them to national
 importance  by proclaiming them a
 "plebiscite" on his administration. He
 also broke a 12-year tradition of presiden-
 tial noninvolvement in civilian politics
 and-despite his reserved manner-prov-
 ed to be an adept campaigner.
 There is no doubt that the President
 views the election returns as a national
 vote of confidence in his leadership; his
 buoyant mood has had a calming effect on
 the country. A rash of bombings-at-
 tributed to right-wing extremists who op-
 posed Geisel's political activism-sub-
 sided with the elections, and military
 criticism of the administration has soften-
 ed noticeably in recent weeks.
 It now seems unlikely that Geisel will
 revamp the political party system or make
 major cabinet changes in the near future,
 as many observers have predicted.
 Instead, he has been focusing his attention
 on more pressing economic issues and
 military personnel shifts. In both areas, he
 has moved forcefully, making major cuts
 in public investment and promoting of-
 ficers on the basis of seniority and
 professional competence to the highest
 ranks.
 The respite from criticism and disrup-
 tive political maneuvering by dissidents
 will almost certainly be temporary. Con-
 tinuing economic problems and the
 likelihood of a mild recession next year
 make it even more likely that, after a
 short breathing period, military hard
 liners and leading industrialists will renew
 their complaints

 JAPAN  4
 The sharp setback suffered by Japan's
 Liberal  Democrats at the polls on
 December 5 did not cost them control of
 the government, but apparently it did end
 Prime Minister Miki's tenure in office.
 The party's officially endorsed can-
 didates fell seven seats short of winning a
 majority-256 seats-in the Diet's lower
 house. Nine conservative independents
 who won seats have already joined the
 Liberal Democratic Party, ensuring that
 it will maintain its majority in the Diet.
 Six more independents will join or vote
 with the ruling party.
 Even so, the Liberal Democrats will
 still fall short of the 271 needed to main-
 tain effective control over all the com-
 mittees in the lower house. The party will
 now have to bargain and compromise
 with a group of young dissidents who
 bolted the Liberal Democratic Party
 earlier this year-or with the Democratic
 Socialists, the most moderate of the op-
 position parties.
 Despite the Liberal Democratic losses,
 the election returns do not indicate any
 change in the basically conservative senti-
 ment of most Japanese voters. The share
 of the popular vote won by conservative
 candidates rose to 51 percent, slightly
 above the 1972 level. Younger and more
 independent candidates did somewhat
 better, however.
 The voters also rejected militant op-
 position candidates in favor of the
 middle-of-the-road parties. The Com-
 munists won only 17 seats compared to 39
 in 1972, once more becoming the smallest
 opposition party in the lower house.
 Miki is expected to announce his inten-
 tion to resign as prime minister fairly
 soon, and consultations are already under
 way among ruling party leaders to select a
 successor. Former deputy prime minister
 Fukuda is the front-runner. He was en-
 dorsed by a solid majority of Liberal
 Democratic members of the Diet before
 the election. Despite some efforts by
 Miki's supporters to put part of the blame
 on Fukuda for the party's poor showing,
 he apparently retains the backing of much
 of the rank and file.
 Perhaps more important, Finance
 Minister Ohira, Fukuda's leading ally in
 the party, has reportedly reconfirmed his
 support for Fukuda. If so, the chance of
 any significant opposition to Fukuda aris-

 major departures from its current foreign
 policy line.
 The position of premier is still held by
 party chairman Hua Kuo-feng. Sup-

 job be kept in Hua's hands until Teng can

 Teng supporters may include Defense

 strong possibility over the longer term.
 There was no announcement of a new
 chairman of the National  People's
 Congress, a position equivalent to head of
 state. Filling this post could be a conten-
 tious issue. There are signs that some in
 the leadership would like Yeh Chien-ying
 to move up to that job, thus leaving the
 defense portfolio to ambitious military
 man Chen Hsi-lien. Yeh probably does
 not want to relinquish his control over the

 The Thai agreed to station additional

 allayed Thai suspicions that the Malay-

 large Muslim population in southern
 Thailand that wants to become part of
 Malaysia. The Thai had insisted-as a

 Malaysians also participate in joint

 problem since early November, trying to
 get formal border talks resumed and joint

 agreements broke down last April when
 the Malaysians bombed Thai territory
 without permission.
 With the conservatives in Malaysia's

 communists in general, Hussein will find
 it politically useful to point to improved
 border cooperation with the Thai.
 INDIA    571 5;
 India is harvesting a bumper grain crop
 for the second consecutive year.
 Food grain production reached a record
 118 million tons for the crop year ending
 in June 1976 and should range from 107
 million to 112 million tons this crop year.
 Output averaged only 102 million tons an-
 nually during the preceding four years.
 Good weather has been primarily
 responsible for the larger harvests,
 although increased use of fertilizer and
 better seeds has helped.
 Grain import orders were suspended
 last spring and are not likely to be resum-
 ed anytime soon. Barring a poor spring
 crop, which appears unlikely, no new im-
 port commitments are likely before
 mid-1977.
 Two good harvests in a row are severely
 straining India's food storage capacity.
 Buffer stocks now total 17 million tons
 and are likely to increase further. India   25X1
 has permanent facilities for some 12
 million tons; much of the remainder has
 been stored in the open.
 The upturn in agriculture-and in the
 overall economy-is largely responsible
 for the calm political atmosphere that has
 prevailed since Prime Minister Gandhi
 tightened her hold over the government in
 mid-1975. The absence of significant
 public discontent has enabled her to con-
 centrate on restructuring the government
 along authoritarian lines and to postpone
 the nation  election for a second year,
 until 1978.

 The cease-fire in Lebanon has left Syria with considerably
 enhanced influence in Middle East affairs. Syria is now bent on
 doing all it can to push for resumption of serious Arab-Israeli
 peace negotiations.
 Syria: Foreign Policy Beyond Lebanon
 Syrian President Asa s pose ton at
 home and abroad has strengthened
 significantly since the Arab heads of state
 endorsed the Lebanese cease-fire in late
 October.
 The halt in fighting-even without
 progress toward a political settlement
 among the  Lebanese-has  eliminated
 most public expressions of discontent
 within Syria, stopped effective pressure
 from Egypt and the USSR, and ended
 any possibility of conventional military
 moves by Iraq.
 The improvement in Asad's political
 position has already opened the way for
 him to focus on foreign policy concerns
 beyond Lebanon, and is likely to make
 him push harder for progress in
 Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. It will
 not, however, make Asad any more will-
 ing to offer significant concessions to
 Israel.
 Syria's strategy now is to marshal as
 much Arab and international support as
 possible to press the US and Israel to
 resume serious peace negotiations. To
 minimize the political risks and to avoid
 the appearance that he is making con-
 cessions, Asad probably will work
 through Arab states with close ties to the
 US, particularly Jordan and Egypt.
 The Jordan Strategy
 Asad's immediate aim is to strengthen
 further his close ties to Jordan. During his
 visit to Amman this week, he persuaded
 King Husayn to join him in an announce-
 ment of their intention to create-some-
 time in the future-a federation or con-
 federation of the two countries.
 The Syrians doubtless believe that such
 a demonstration of Jordan's support and
 confidence-following Syria's victory in
 Lebanon-will remind the US, Israel, and
 Asad's Arab critics that Syria is in an in-
 creasingly powerful position in the region,
 and that its views on Lebanese and Mid-
 dle East peace negotiations must be ac-
 commodated.
 Syrian leaders presumably believe also
 that a forceful public reminder of Syria's
 powerful position will have a salutary
 effect on Egyptian President Sadat, whom
 Asad plans to visit in Cairo on December
 11. Despite the recent rapprochement
 between Syria and Egypt, the Syrians are
 not yet confident about dealing with
 Egypt and will want to underscore their
 ability and determination to play a major
 part in forming future Arab policy.
 Jordanian leaders value their close
 association with Syria because it keeps
 them involved in broad Middle East
 issues. Despite the urgings of powerful
 private advisers to enter into a federation
 with Syria, however, Husayn and other
 Jordanian officials are inclined to allow
 only a modest expansion of existing
 military and economic arrangements.
 King Husayn probably will endorse the
 principle of closer political cooperation.
 He will delay indefinitely, however, im-
 plementing any scheme that would cede to
 others significant influence over Jordan's
 internal security or foreign and military
 policy.
 Coordination with Egypt
 Asad is now willing to put aside his
 public criticism of the second Sinai accord
 while he attempts to work through Sadat
 to make gains in negotiations.
 The Syrians have long believed that the
 Egyptians are inclined to make un-
 necessary early concessions in peace
 negotiations, but they nevertheless prefer
 that Sadat take the lead in arranging a
 new round of talks. Asad recognizes that
 Egypt has more experience than Syria in
 dealing with the US and also prefers that
 Egypt suffer the public criticism that
 would accompany a failure to get talks
 going again.
 Working with Egypt also helps Syria in
 its relations with the other Arabs. It par-
 ticularly pleases the Saudis, who provide
 budget support to Syria, fund the
 predominantly Syrian Arab peacekeeping
 force in Lebanon, and control use of the
 Arab oil weapon.
 The rapprochement between Syria and
 Egypt also helps undercut Asad's radical
 Arab critics. The Palestinians and the
 Iraqis succeeded in delaying the establish-
 ment of a Syrian-backed peace in
 Lebanon when they had active backing
 from Egypt, but without Egyptian support
 they have had to acquiesce in the Syrian
 presence. Several hundred Iraqi troops
 have already withdrawn from Lebanon.
 Politically, the Palestinians will find it
 much more difficult to play the Syrians
 and Egyptians off against one another as
 long as the Syrian-Egyptian rapproche-
 ment holds.
 This will reduce the chances that the
 Palestinians will be able to veto any for-
 mula the Syrians and Egyptians may
 arrange for an Arab delegation to return
 to Geneva, or to use a future meeting of
 the Palestinian National Council-the
 Palestinian parliament-to reduce Syria's
 military or political control of the
 fedayeen.

 Syria for months has equivocated
 publicly about the utility of reconvening
 the Geneva conference, but there is no
 doubt that it will be willing to return to
 the conference if it believes there can be
 significant progress in peace negotiations.
 Syria's renewal last month of the man-
 date of the UN observer force on the
 Golan  Heights  without significant
 political wrangling reflects in part Syria's
 interest in avoiding an obstructionist im-
 age at a time when the Arabs are pushing
 for a resumption of serious negotiations.
 Asad is not likely to abandon his posi-
 tion  that the Palestinians must  be
 represented at Geneva from the start of
 any new round of talks. If he perceives
 that progress may be possible on substan-
 tive issues, however, he might agree to the
 formation   of  a  joint Arab
 delegation-which Egypt would sup-
 port-that would include Palestine
 Liberation Organization representatives
 but not have the PLO present as an
 organization.
 This would have the advantage, from
 Syria's point of view, of facilitating con-
 trol of the PLO by the moderate Arab
 states. It would also have the advantage of
 putting both the PLO and Israel on the
 defensive. Neither would like such a for-
 mula, but both would be concerned about
 the possible political costs of rejecting it.
 On substantive matters, Syria in the
 coming months will press for negotiations
 aiming at the return of the Arab
 territories occupied by Israel in exchange
 for an end to "all forms of aggression,"
 Asad is already attempting to bolster
 his case internationally by arguing that
 Israel's demands that diplomatic, com-
 mercial, economic, and cultural ex-
 changes be included in a final peace settle-
 ment are only obstacles raised to ensure
 that no progress is made.
 Israel and Lebanon
 Asad's successful pursuit of his
 Lebanon policy against the wishes of the
 Soviets, Palestinians, and several Arab
 governments almost certainly has rein-
 forced his conviction that perseverance
 pays off. We anticipate that the net effect
 of the Lebanese involvement, therefore,
 will be to make Asad more confident and
 more determined than ever to maintain
 heavy pressure on the Israelis, and to give
 them no excuse to refuse to participate in
 negotiations or to turn to military action.
 Syria will continue, for example, to
 reaffirm its support for the creation of a
 Palestinian state. This serves also to dis-
 arm Asad's fedayeen critics, who argue
 that his Lebanese policy was directed
 against the Palestinians.
 Troops in Lebanon
 The 25,000 to 30,000 Syrian troops in
 Lebanon constitute an implicit threat to
 Israel, even though they are dispersed
 throughout the country and pose no im-
 mediate threat to Israel's security. This
 military presence probably will remain for
 many months even if the Lebanese cease-
 fire holds, and will tend to create new
 political problems between Israel and
 Syria.
 Syria has begun to rebuild the Syrian-
 controlled Saiqa fedayeen group in
 Lebanon, and has moved small units of
 the Syrian-dominated Palestine Libera-
 tion Army into the Arqub region of
 southern Lebanon. These actions are not
 directed at Israel, but, because they ex-
 pand Syrian control in Lebanon, will also
 raise Israeli concern.
 The Syrians have indicated in the
 Damascus news media their desire to
 move their forces into the southern
 Lebanese port of Tyre to eliminate the
 last important source of resupply for the
 Palestinians and leftists, but have delayed
 doing so in the face of Israel's stated op-
 position to such a move.
 If the Syrians conclude they cannot risk
 a move into Tyre, they are likely to decide
 that continued tension and occasional
 skirmishing between the fedayeen and
 Lebanese Christian and Israeli forces in
 the border area-despite the adverse im-
 pact on Lebanese stability-serve Syria's
 interests in dealing with Israel.
 Continued tension, the Syrians might
 calculate, would oblige the Israelis to
 choose between a Syrian presence in the
 border area and continued insecurity with
 low-level fedayeen cross-border terrorism.

 The Italian political situation remains complex, but most
 factors in the equation seem likely to drive the Christian
 Democrats and the Communists closer together rather than
 further apart.
 25X1
 Italy: Andreotti's Problems
 Prime Minister Andreotti is grappling
 with the most difficult combination of
 economic and political problems to con-
 front an Italian government leader in
 years.
 The essence of Andreotti's dilemma is
 that his Christian Democratic minority
 government must rely on Communist
 cooperation to implement an urgently
 needed economic stabilization program,
 while at the same time the leadership
 is searching for ways to revive a non-
 communist governing coalition.
 Unable to muster support for such a
 coalition among their traditional allies
 following last June's election, the Chris-
 tian  Democrats have been forced to
 bargain for Communist abstention in
 parliament in order to install Andreotti's
 government and enact austerity measures
 to halt the spiraling inflation and a large
 balance-of-payments deficit.
 In return for their abstention-and for
 keeping labor protest within manageable
 limits-the Communists have received
 key parliamentary posts previously denied
 them, along with a broader more overt
 consultative role in government policy
 making.
 Thus the dominant feature of the period
 since the election has been an uneasy but
 growing cooperative relationship between
 the Communists and Christian
 Democrats.
 It is clear that this arrangement cannot
 go on indefinitely. Eventually, the two
 parties must move toward closer, more
 formal collaboration or revert to a
 semblance of the old order, the central
 feature of which was a much clearer dis-
 tinction  between  the Christian

 Democratic - led governing majority and
 the Communist opposition. Both parties
 face difficult choices but, on balance, the
 Christian Democrats appear to have the
 more complicated and risk-laden task.
 Communist Goals
 The Communists' goals are relatively
 clear-cut. Cooperation with Andreotti is
 designed to provide simple political
 leverage, but also something much more
 far-reaching. Communist leaders appear
 convinced that unless they work with the
 Christian Democrats and demonstrate a
 responsible attitude toward Italy's press-
 ing problems, they cannot achieve
 membership in the government without
 triggering unacceptable levels of domestic
 and international uncertainty.
 The major risk for the Communists is
 that their traditional working-class base
 will become alienated by the party's ac-
 quiescence in austerity measures that will
 hit hard at lower income groups. There
 has already been considerable evidence of
 restlessness among the Communist rank
 and file, particularly in the labor sector; at
 one point in October, for example, Com-
 munist cadres had to fan out into the
 northern industrial centers to quell a rash
 of wildcat strikes and explain the party's
 support  for
 workers.
 the government to the
 The risk of weakening Communist
 strength among the workers is offset
 somewhat by the failure so far of the other
 leftist parties to present themselves as
 credible alternatives or to develop the
 kind of organizations necessary to com-
 pete with the Communists' vote-gathering
 machinery.
 For example, the Socialist Party-the
 Communists' most substantial rival on
 the left-is mired in internal disputes that
 prevent it from projecting an image clear-
 ly distinct from that of the Communists.
 Even as they proclaim their autonomy
 from the Communists, the Socialists say
 that they will not join the Christian
 Democrats in another coalition unless it is
 a broadly based emergency government
 that includes the Communists.
 In these circumstances the Communists
 probably will be able to hold most of their
 hard-core supporters, while working to
 neutralize anti-Communist sentiment
 among other voters by appearing to be the
 most important ally of a government
 beset by massive economic problems.
 The longer the de facto partnership
 between the Communists and Christian
 SECRET
 Democrats continues, the more likely it
 becomes that Italians will view any
 governmental success as a by-product of
 collaboration between the two parties.
 This, in turn, would tend to make Com-
 munist chief Berlinguer's three-year-old
 offer of an "historic compromise" with
 the Christian Democrats look less and less
 threatening.
 The Christian Democrats
 While the Communists are playing a
 risky game, the Christian Democrats face
 a more acute dilemma as they weigh the
 probable  consequences  of closer
 collaboration  with  the  Communists
 against the implications of an attempt to
 put together a government more insulated
 from Communist influence.
 Perhaps the greatest limit on the Chris-
 tian Democrats' freedom of maneuver
 stems from their long-time emphasis on
 anti-communism, which had made party
 strategy to some extent a captive of that
 issue. While Berlinguer has for at least
 three years been preparing the Com-
 munist rank and file for closer relations
 between the two traditional rivals, the
 Christian Democrats have been proclaim-
 ing for decades that they would never go
 as far as they have since June toward an

 accommodation with the Communists.
 The Christian Democrats managed to
 retain their plurality in the June election
 by draining right-wing support from the
 smaller  parties-such  as  the  neo-
 fascists-with a tough anti-communist
 campaign. Thus, any move toward formal
 collaboration with the Communists would
 seriously jeopardize the Christian
 Democrats' base of support among anti-
 communist voters.
 Leadership Strained
 It would also severely strain the cohe-
 sion of the Christian Democratic
 leadership. While Christian Democratic
 leaders are generally united behind An-
 dreotti's economic program, many of
 them are nervous about his government's
 dependence on the Communists.
 Divisions among Christian Democrats
 over the communism issue are reflected in
 recent developments in the key northern
 industrial region of Lombardy. The
 Christian  Democratic-led  regional
 government there has entered into a for-
 mal "legislative accord" with the local
 Communists that goes well beyond the ad
 hoc consultative arrangement at the
 national level. The regional party leader
 has recommended that Andreotti consider
 applying the Lombardy model at the
 national level-as a way of assuring con-
 tinued Communist support without ad-
 mitting the party to the government.
 Right-wing Christian  Democrats in
 Lombardy have revolted, however, and
 taken over the party organization in
 Milan, the regional capital. Their leader,
 Massimo De Carolis, recently provoked
 considerable controversy by asserting that
 the present drift toward cooperation with
 the Communists should be cut short by
 returning to a policy of confrontation with
 them, even if that involves another elec-
 tion.
 There are signs that these competing
 points of view are being debated in the
 party's national leadership, although An-
 dreotti's tactics appear to have the back-
 ing or acquiescence of most influential
 Christian Democrats not because they
 favor an accommodation with the Com-
 munists but because they believe the alter-
 natives to the present course are even less
 attractive.
 Closer relations with the Communists
 would create serious internal problems for
 the Christian Democrats but, as they look
 to the future, the Christian Democrats
 can draw little comfort from the fact that
 a noncommunist majority still exists in
 parliament. The Christian Democrats'
 former allies might eventually be per-
 suaded to rejoin them in the government,
 but any attempt by the Christian
 Democrats to push the Communists to the
 sidelines would risk incurring the kind of
 Communist opposition that would make
 Italy even harder to govern.
 Even before the June election, Christian
 Democratic-led governments found it dif-
 ficult to enact programs opposed by the
 Communists; with the strength the Com-
 munists gained in June, it is clear that any
 government that excludes the Com-
 munists will still need their benevolence to
 secure approval of key bills, particularly
 in the economic area.
 The Socialists
 except in the highly unlikely event that
 they elect to go into opposition.
 Neither the Communists nor the Chris-
 tian Democrats want to force the issue
 now, and uneasy rapprochement probably
 will continue for at least several more
 months. Given the usual caution of Italian
 political leaders, it may well take some
 decisive event-perhaps another election
 or an economic deterioration sharp
 enough  to subordinate political
 differences-to force a further qualitative
 change in relations between the two par-
 ties any time soon. While it is too soon to
 sketch in the details of the relationship's
 next phase, most factors in the Italian
 political equation seem likely to drive the
 Communists and Christian Democrats
 closer together rather than further apart.
 25X1
 The Socialists, whose support the
 Christian Democrats must have to form a
 noncommunist government, would not be
 likely to go along unless the Christian
 Democrats were willing at least to seek
 Communist support for government
 programs. The Socialists want to ensure
 that the Communists share some respon-
 sibility for government decisions rather
 than being left free to criticize from the
 opposition.
 Apart from that, however, the
 Socialists have probably concluded from
 their experiences in a succession of
 center-left coalitions between 1963 and
 1974 that Communist abstention or sup-
 port in parliament might frequently be
 necessary to offset Christian Democratic
 defections during votes on controversial
 social and economic programs.
 The Christian Democrats thus face un-
 palatable choices whether they move
 toward more formal collaboration with
 the Communists or try to put more dis-
 tance  between  themselves  and
 Berlinguer's party. Sooner or later, they
 will have to choose one sort of alliance,

 The coming months may be difficult for the East German
 leaders as they grapple with a complexity of political and
 economic challenges.
 East Germany The Regime's Problems
 Since mid-August a number of
 problems have appeared on the East Ger-
 man domestic scene, and all of them have
 contributed to political malaise and public
 discontent. Economic problems, too, have
 come to the fore, and informed observers
 appear to agree that economic issues were
 behind the leadership reshuffle in Oc-
 tober.
 In all likelihood a Central Committee
 plenum will meet to review several critical
 problems, including the economic situa-
 tion. Some personnel shifts may occur,
 although there have been no strong in-
 dications pointing in this direction. Party
 chief Honecker may follow up the
 top-level shifts in the government that
 were made in late October with other
 moves to strengthen the party's control
 over the government's administrative and
 economic machinery.
 The Leadership
 It has not been an easy autumn for East
 German leaders, and in many respects the
 coming months could turn out to be a
 "winter of discontent" for the government
 and the population. East German
 authorities seem uneasy about issues that
 could provoke public displeasure. Accord-
 ing to some observers, the public is more
 critical and outspoken than it has been at
 any time in recent years. In short, the
 potential for collision between critics of
 the regime and the insecure, oversensitive
 authorities is rising.
 The regime's ability to monitor the
 public mood and ensure that adequate
 security precautions are taken is well
 proven. The authorities are subject,
 however, to miscalculation and overreac-
 tion-particularly when West German
 media enter the picture-and in recent
 months have done more to aggravate
 some situations than to ease them.
 To what degree the problems that have
 come to the surface have provoked con-
 troversy and differences of opinion within
 the Politburo is difficult to determine.
 There seems to be a consensus on broad
 issues, but recriminations are doubtless
 made when developments take an unex-
 pected or adverse turn.
 Overriding all other considerations is
 the importance to the USSR of a stable,
 secure East German regime. This is
 crucial to the Soviet ability to deal with
 West Germany and Europe in general.
 The USSR will stop at nothing to main-
 tain stability in East Germany and con-
 tinue its ultimate control over events
 there.
 For the East German regime, and es-
 pecially for Honecker, the critical ques-
 tion is to ensure Soviet support on a wide
 range of inter-German issues. To this end,
 the  East  German  party  chief
 enthusiastically pursues all measures
 leading to stronger bilateral ties with the
 USSR.
 Honecker realizes that his position as
 party leader and preservation of the
 limited autonomy that the regime has in
 domestic affairs depend almost complete-
 ly on his ability to ensure internal order.
 He has a well-deserved reputation for
 painstaking attention to detail and has a
 firm hold on the party organizational
 machinery.
 Taken individually,  none of the
 problems confronting Honecker is intrac-
 table. At least for the moment, he seems
 to have them under control. Taken
 together, the challenges to the authority
 of the state are pervasive and interlocking.
 They will require prudent and dis-
 criminating attention by the leadership. A
 harsh ideological crackdown would risk a
 serious public backlash.
 The Problems
 First of all, the incidents of last summer
 in Berlin and along the East-West Ger-
 man border focused attention on the ques-
 tion of travel and contacts between the
 two Germanies.
 Church-state relations then became
 aggravated-tensions remain high, and
 East German officials are still chafing
 over the defiant boycott by some of the
 church hierarchy of the parliamentary
 election in October. Official displeasure
 over youth problems is more pronounced,
 economic problems continue, and the
 regime has now embarked on a
 crackdown on the country's more out-
 spoken, dissident intellectuals. All of
 these issues take on an added air of uncer-
 tainty when viewed through the prism of
 inter-German relations.
 One of the chief concerns of leading
 party and government officials at the mo-
 ment  is  the  rise in  emigration
 applications. Such applications are
 reported to number in the hundreds of

 thousands, and the congenitally
 suspicious communist leaders may see the
 challenge as something amounting to a
 national conspiracy.
 Inter-German relations unquestionably
 pose the most vexing problem for East
 German policy makers. It is also the one
 area where there are probably differences
 of opinion among them. Indeed, mixed
 signals on this subject from both East and
 West Germany are the norm rather than
 the exception.
 For example, with virtually the entire
 Politburo backing him up, Honecker held
 a widely publicized press conference at the
 Leipzig Fair on September 5 during which
 he took a fairly conciliatory position on
 the subject of Western travel. In essence,
 he tied increased travel to the West to im-
 provements in the regime's hard-currency
 deficit.
 Since the West German election,
 however, East Berlin has been taking a
 tougher line toward Bonn. The change
 may reflect the regime's concern over the
 increasingly open, sympathetic attitude of
 East German church and youth groups
 toward dissident East German artists. The
 tougher line could also be a reaction to the
 West German media's exploitation of the
 situation in East Germany.
 It is too soon to tell whether East Ger-
 many intends to carry out a full-scale
 cultural crackdown; tentative indications
 point in thg opposite direction.
 Bilateral talks between East and West
 German negotiators on "human con-
 tacts" continue. The East Germans may
 be seriously considering some action to
 case the regime's restrictive travel
 policies. If so, the current hard line being
 taken against what amounts to the "ex-
 pendable" fringe element of East German
 society will serve as a stern warning for
 the average East German who visits the
 West.
 ment changes have certainly been aimed
 at enhancing the party's role in society,
 and there may be some additional shifts in
 this direction in the near future.
 As the past months have indicated,
 however, there are forces at work within
 East German society that will sorely test
 Honecker's capacity for leadership.
 The regime's determination to pursue
 its distinct economic interests may carry it
 to the point of agreeing to further im-
 provement in  East-West travel
 arrangements in return for credits from
 West Germany. This could create fur-
 ther political opportunities for West
 Germany and might even pose complica-
 tions in East German relations with the
 USSR.
 In short, the pressures on the Honecker
 regime can only mount as moves toward
 Outlook
 The assumption of the chairmanship of
 the Council of State by the 64-year-old
 Honecker in October. brings him to the
 summit of his power-he now holds the
 same positions previously held by his
 predecessor, Walter Ulbricht. The govern-
 further relaxation of controls over in-
 ter-German contacts conflict with the un-
 bending effort of the regime to impose on
 its own population a distinctly separate,
 communist  sense  of  identity.
