 VIETNAM
 Communist forces may have begun their fall-winter cam-
 paign in three of South Vietnam's northern provinces,
 and evidently are massing along the Cambodian border
 for an offensive in that area.     East European officials
 seem to be hinting about improved prospects for peace
 talks, but Hanoi shows no sign of softening its stand.
 In Saigon, Premier Ky must still resolve his cabinet
 crisis, which was papered over before he left for
 Manila.   The crisis, however, does not seem to have
 slowed the work of the Constituent Assembly.
 MUTINY BY LAOTIAN AIR FORCE CHIEF COLLAPSES                           5
 The growth in influence of General Kouprasith, which
 has been accelerated by the departure of air force Gen-
 eral Ma,  is likely to result in increased pressure for
 a greater military voice in the government.
 CAMBODIA MOVES TOWARD  IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE US                   6
 Sihanouk is no longer certain of a Communist victory in
 Indochina and has begun to reappraise Cambodia's posi-

 contacts with the West and open a dialogue with the US.

 SOVIET INDUSTRY CONTINUES  ITS LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE
 Moscow's plan-fulfillment statistics for the third quar-

 WEST BERLIN MAYOR AND  SOVIET AMBASSADOR LXPLORE DETENTE
 Mayor Brandt believes expansion of West Berlin's contacts
 with the East is essential to the city's future.   To this
 end he has met four times since spring with Moscow's am-
 bassador to East Germany.            Both sides see advantages in
 the exchange which override any concern they may have
 about objections from the East or West German govern-
 ments.
 SPAIN INCREASES  PRESSURE ON GIBRALTAR
 After a fourth inconclusive round of talks, Madrid has
 imposed trade and traffic restrictions--and threatened
 to make further such moves--in an effort to force Lon-
 don to concede Spanish sovereignty over the disputed
 territory.    In a bid for US support,  Madrid has also
 warned of repercussions for Western defense interests
 if it is rebuffed.
 NATO MOVES  TOWARD SETTLEMENT OF SOME OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS
 The tripartite  (US,  UK,  West German) review of Alliance
 strategy and financial burden-sharing has gotten under
 way despite continuing protests from the other allies
 anxious for a role in these talks.   The French have won
 their point on procedures for talks regarding French
 forces in Germany.    A decision to transfer the North
 Atlantic Council from Paris to Brussels has been made.

 TRIPARTITE CONFERENCE IN NEW DELHI PRODUCES NO SURPRISES
 The three-day meeting in New Delhi of Presidents Tito
 and Nasir and Prime Minister Gandhi is unlikely to in-
 fuse new life into the concept of a united nonaligned
 world.
 CENTO LIKELY TO SURVIVE DESPITE DISSATISFACTION AMONG
 MEMBERS
 Continuing disenchantment with CENTO on the part of
 Pakistan and Iran is reflected in recent rumors and
 press speculation that they and their ally Turkey are
 considering an alternative regional arrangement.   The
 prompt official denials and the inherent political and
 financial problems involved make any serious move
 against CENTO unlikely at present.
 PURGE OF YEMENI  GOVERNMENT CONTINUES
 Egypt's encouragement of President Sallal's ruthless re-
 pression suggests Nasir has abandoned any attempt to pre-
 serve the image of Yemeni cooperation in Cairo's domi-
 nation of the country.
 NIGER.IA'S   EASTERN REGION AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STILL AT ODDS   18
 The Eastern Region is boycotting the interregional con-

 negating the modest progress which had been made toward
 resolving Nigeria's drawn-out governmental crisis, and
 pushing the East closer to de facto independence.
 FOURTH SUMMIT OF AFRICAN UNITY ORGANIZATION DUE EARLY NEXT

 PARAGUAYAN PRESIDENT SEEKS OPPOSITION COOPERATION
 Stroessner wants to replace the 1940 Constitution so

 Communist forces may have
 begun their "Thu Dong" or fall-win-
 ter campaign in the South Vietnamese
 provinces of Quang Nam, Quang Tin,
 and Quang Ngai in the southern part
 of I Corps.   Since 14 October, en-
 emy units have attacked five out-
 posts,  a power plant,  and a dispen-
 sary,  shelled two district headquar-
 ters,  and harassed refugee camps
 and lines of communications.
 Principles allegedly set forth
 at a Communist strategy meeting in
 this area in early September said
 that the "Thu Dong" offensive will
 employ the 5,600-man North Vietnam-
 ese Army  (NVA)  620th Division,  two
 Viet Cong sapper  (demolition) bat-
 talions,       and Viet Cong main force
 units operating in conjunction with
 local guerrilla forces.   Tactical
 plans call for intensified guerrilla
 efforts in friendly rear areas and
 widespread attacks against outposts,
 especially those manned by South
 Vietnamese paramilitary forces. The
 primary role of Viet Cong/NVA regu-
 lars will allegedly be to ambush
 allied forces dispatched to relieve
 friendly positions under siege by
 guerrilla units.
 However,  the campaign in at
 least Quang Nam Province appears to
 have been temporarily disrupted by
 a highly successful spoiling opera-
 tion conducted this week by US Ma-
 rines and the South Vietnamese Army
 (ARVN)  some 25 miles south-southwest
 of Da Nang.   The coordinated allied
 effort---codenamed KERN/TRUY KICH--
 resulted in more than 400 Communists
 killed,  as against friendly losses

 of 35 killed  (eight US)  and 120
 wounded  (26 US).
 NVA forces are continuing to
 expand their infiltration corri-
 dors on the western flank of the
 Demilitarized Zone and to consoli-
 date their base area in and south
 of the zone.   The Communists are
 estimated to retain the capability
 to attack troop concentrations,
 outposts,  and population centers in
 the coastal and interior regions of
 northern Quang Tri with a strike
 force of up to three reinforced di-
 visions.
 In the western highlands of
 II Corps,  evidence continues  to
 mount that major elements of the
 NVA 630th Division are massing
 along the Cambodian border in south-
 western Kontum and northwestern
 Pleiku provinces, possibly in prepa-
 ration for a major assault on the
 Plei Djereng Special Forces Camp.
 The primary objective of such an at-
 tack would probably be to inflict
 heavy casualties from ambush posi-
 tions on large numbers of allied
 forces dispatched to the area as re-
 inforcements.
 Elements of seven US Army bat-
 talions participating in Phase IV
 of Operation PAUL REVERE  reported
 several sharp skirmishes with pla-
 toon- and company-size enemy units
 in the Plei Djereng area during the
 past week. To date,  the six-month-
 long PAUL REVERE  surveillance cam-
 paign along the Cambodian border
 has successfully blunted several ma-
 jor Communist offensive operations

 Prospects for Negotiations
 Some East European officials,
 following high-level contacts with
 Hanoi and the summit conference in
 Moscow, are broadly hinting that
 prospects are now better for some
 move toward negotiations.   These
 spokesmen are taking the line that
 Eastern European countries are
 sharply increasing their aid to
 North Vietnam in order to increase
 their influence at the expense of
 the Chinese. At the same time, press
 reports allege that they will advise
 Hanoi to soften its insistence that
 the National Liberation Front is the
 sole representative of the South
 Vietnamese people and call for a
 halt to infiltration. The US,  it is
 argued, could then cease its bombing
 of the North.
 Previously, East Europeans
 had urged a cessation of the bomb-
 ing as a first step toward negotia-
 tions,  and they may hope by their
 latest tactic to increase pressure
 on the US to do so.   Recent hints
 are probably also an effort to put
 the best possible face on their ad-
 ditional aid to North Vietnam so
 that it does not appear to be a di-
 rect rebuff to President Johnson's
 recent overtures for improved re-
 lations with Eastern Europe.
 There is no indication, how-
 ever, that the East Europeans are
 very hopeful that Hanoi will re-
 spond to their suggestions.   East
 European delegations returning from
 Hanoi have reported that the North
 Vietnamese continue to insist on
 their four-point peace proposals,
 and the Czechs publicly endorsed
 this stand while in Hanoi. It is
 doubtful, therefore,  that the East
 Europeans would now undertake a new
 initiative without a good indica-
 tion that the US or North Vietnam
 had altered its position.
 Premier Ky's cabinet problems,
 as well as the over-all issue of
 north-south regional antagonisms,
 were put aside while ranking South
 Vietnamese Government officials at-
 tended the Manila Conference.
 Just before leaving for Manila,
 Ky obtained a promise from six of
 the seven dissident southern minis-
 ters to remain at their posts until
 after the conference;  in a public
 display of confidence, he named
 Nguyen Luu Vien, one of the dissi-
 dents, as acting premier.l-1

 one of the dissident ministers now
 says he is no longer pressing for
 Loan's removal; he suggested a face-
 saving device which would allow most
 of the ministers to stay on.
 Even if the immediate dispute
 is quietly resolved, however,  the
 major issue involving the proper
 southern share of influence in the
 government will remain.  Efforts
 during the next several months by
 northern officials to broaden their
 political base, while restricting
 the growth of any significant na-
 tional opposition, will be carefully
 scrutinized and probably opposed by
 the southerners and other elements
 eager for a significant voice in the
 future constitutional government.
 The Constituent Assembly
 So far, the cabinet dispute
 has not significantly affected the
 work of the Constituent Assembly.
 The credentials of all the deputies
 have now been certified, and proce-
 dural rules have been adopted.  As
 was generally expected, former chief
 of state Phan Khac Suu, a moderate
 southerner, was elected permanent
 chairman of the assembly on 26 Oc-
 tober, with a northerner and a Hoa
 Hao leader elected as assistant
 chairman.  Second to Suu in the bal-
 loting for chairman was Tran Dien,
 a Catholic member of the Dai Viet
 nationalist party from Central Viet-
 nam, who apparently drew consider-
 able support from the cohesive Cath-
 olic bloc in the assembly. The posts
 of secretary general and chairman
 of the constitution drafting commit-
 tee remain to be filled before
 drafting begins.
 Buddhist Split Hardens
 The special Unified Buddhist
 Association  (UBA)  congress in Saigon
 on 21 and 22 October ended in chaos
 and failed to resolve the organiza-

 militant supporters of Tri Quang
 and the moderates of Tam Chau now
 appears one step closer.  At pres-

 Institute chairmen--Tam Chau and
 militant Thien Hoa--each with his
 own supporters and headquarters in

 MUTINY BY LAOTIAN AIR FORCE CHIEF COLLAPSES
 The collapse of air force
 General Ma's 21 October mutiny
 against the Laotian General Staff
 removes still another major obsta-
 cle to the growing influence of
 General Kouprasith, deputy com-
 mander in chief of the Royal Armed
 Forces  (FAR).   The end of Ma's
 career  came  just a week after
 General Kong Le was forced out of
 his command of the neutralist
 forces, a move that probably pre-
 sages at least their partial ab-
 sorption into FAR.   One result of
 these changes is likely to be in-
 creased pressure for a greater
 military voice in the government
 and for elimination of "leftist"
 vestiges in the coalition,  such
 as the vacant cabinet portfolios
 held open for the Communist Pathet
 Lao.
 The  mutiny  began on 21 Oc-
 tober, when T-28 aircraft under
 Ma's command bombed the FAR head-
 quarters installations near Vien-
 tiane.   The planes missed their
 prime targets--the quarters of
 senior officers--but succeeded in
 knocking out armed forces communi-
 cations and killing more than 20
 people.
 Ma's ostensible goal was the
 removal of corrupt senior offi-
 cers;  however,  it also appears
 that he believed the pressure play
 might stave off his impending de-
 motion from command of the tactical
 air force.   After it became clear
 that none of the regional military
 commanders supported the move, Ma
 fled with a number of his planes
 and pilots to Thailand where he
 requested political asylum.
 The military have asked for
 his extradition,  and Premier Sou-
 vanna Phouma reportedly is support-
 ing the request.   Although Souvanna
 has long supported Ma and privately
 acknowledged his contribution to
 the fighting against the Pathet
 Lao, he now may fear that leaving
 Ma in Thailand--where disgruntled
 generals Phoumi Nosavan and Kong
 Le are also in exile--would bol-
 ster the possibility that an op-
 position  might form there.   it
 is not clear whether the Thais
 will agree to return Ma to Laos.
 Ma's departure deprives the
 Laotian tactical air force, which
 has proved itself highly effec-
 tive in strikes against Communist
 forces in Laos, of a highly mo-
 tivated and skilled leader.   In
 the long run,  however,  it will
 pave the way for a closer inte-
 gration of the air force into
 the armed forces

 CAMBODIA MOVES TOWARD IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE US
 There are continuing signs
 that Sihanouk is moving cautiously
 toward a more middle-of-the-road
 course for Cambodia.
 The substantial input of US
 troops into South Vietnam and
 the growing realization that the
 Communists are not going to score
 an early victory there have
 prompted him to reappraise Cam-
 bodia's position.   At the same
 time,  a divergence of viewpoint
 has surfaced between Phnom Penh
 and Peking on the future of In-
 dochina.   Phnom Penh has been
 particularly disturbed over Pe-
 king's refusal to back a Cam-
 bodian proposal to expand the
 International Control Commission
 in Cambodia,  a move calculated
 to keep the war from spreading
 onto Cambodian territory.
 Although Sihanouk's reap-
 praisal has not led to any diminu-
 tion in the flow of his anti-US
 and pro-Communist rhetoric,  it
 has inspired a series of steps
 to expand contacts with the West
 and open a dialogue with the US.
 The most remarkable sign of
 the new Cambodian attitude, how-
 ever, was the red-carpet treat-
 ment given a Pan American Air-
 lines team in late September.
 Panam acquired landing rights
 with little prior negotiation,
 and the team was told that Cam-
 bodia would like to be designated
 as a rest and recovery area for
 US troops.   The Cambodian nego-
 tiators stated that they realized
 that diplomatic relations would
 have to be restored, but indi-
 cated that this could be worked
 out by the two governments.
 The new Cambodian cabinet,
 announced on 20 October,  is
 further evidence that Sihanouk
 has become responsive to propo-
 nents of a more moderate course.
 The new premier,  former defense
 minister Lon Nol, has long been
 critical of Sihanouk's leftist
 policies,  and especially of Cam-
 bodia's dependence on Chinese Com-
 munist military assistance.   The
 conservative complexion of the
 cabinet is also underlined by
 the absence of Phnom Penh's most
 prominent leftist and the appoint-
 ment of Douc Rasy,  leader of a
 group of younger anti-Communist
 figures,  to the cabinet.

 CHINESE RED GUARDS STEP UP CRITICISM OF HIGH OFFICIALS
 Since mid-October Red Guards
 in Peking and other cities have
 intensified attacks on officials
 in the party apparatus and, for
 the first. time, have directed
 major criticism at important of-
 ficials in the government machin-
 ery. Descriptions of the attacks
 indicate that they are officially
 and centrally directed.   They are
 made through large and prominently
 displayed posters,  sometimes ac-
 companied by well-organized dem-
 onstrations.
 The most prominent govern-
 ment officials under criticism
 are Foreign Minister Chen Yi and
 Finance Minister Li Hsien-nien,
 both ful:L politburo members.   In
 spite of the current criticism,
 both men have been representing
 the regime in meetings with for-
 eign delegations.   On 20 October
 Li met a Pakistani delegation
 which Chen has been hosting.  On
 25 October Chen even appeared
 with Mao Tse-tung in a meeting
 with the delegation.   So far,
 major regime pronouncements on
 the "cultural revolution" have
 focused attention on bringing
 down party, not government, of-
 ficials.
 The strongest attacks in
 recent weeks have been directed
 at Li Hsueh-feng, who replaced
 Peng Chen as head of the Peking
 city party committee in May and
 was promoted into the politburo
 as an alternate member in August.
 Red Guard posters have linked
 him with chief of state Liu Shao-
 On 21 October, large posters de-
 manding the removal of Liu and
 party general secretary Teng
 Hsiao-ping reportedly appeared
 on one of Peking's main streets.
 This is the first reported major
 attack on Teng.
 Reports from Peking indicate
 that unusually virulent poster
 attacks against important regional
 officials in the Northwest and
 Southwest party bureaus have been
 displayed in recent days.   They
 include demands,  for example,  that
 the Southwest Bureau be razed be-
 cause it is a "stronghold of op-
 position to the cultural revolu-
 tion."   Its first secretary, Li
 Ching-chuan,  is a full politburo
 member and is thought to be a
 protege of Teng Hsiao-ping.
 A campaign against key offi-
 cials in the party apparatus has
 been building up since the party
 plenum in early August,  and re-
 cent developments appear to be
 part of a concerted effort to
 bring down those who oppose the
 current ruling faction of Mao
 Tse-tung,  Lin Piao,  and Chou En-
 lai.   Unlike the government men
 now being criticized,  the targets
 in the party apparatus have not
 been publicly active, except in
 their seemingly routine appear-
 ances at large leadership turn-
 outs.

 SOVIET INDUSTRY CONTINUES ITS LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE
 Moscow has released statis-
 tics for Soviet industrial pro-
 duction during the third quarter
 of 1966 which indicate no signif-
 icant change from trends observed
 earlier this year.   The over-all
 increase in output is at an annual
 rate comparable to the unsatis-
 factory level of recent years.
 It is also considerably below
 the performance necessary to re-
 alize the 1970 goal.   (See table.)
 The rate of production of
 chemical equipment during the
 past quarter fell off drastically
 from the performance of the first
 six months,  although the rate of
 increase in petroleum equipment
 and agricultural machinery rose
 moderately.   The increased pro-
 duction of agricultural machinery
 may be a harbinger of further ac-
 celeration in output provided for
 in Brezhnev's agricultural pro-
 gram for 1965-70.   In the energy
 sector,  the fuel industries--
 with the exception of petroleum
 --continued to develop at less-
 than-acceptable rates.
 The Soviet consumer continues
 to experience only a slight im-
 provement in his standard of liv-
 ing, with increased supplies in
 some products offset by virtual
 stagnation in the output of
 others.   Most of the more impres-
 sive percentage increases, more-
 over, were in consumer durables
 such as television sets and re-
 frigerators which have been and
 remain in extremely short sup-
 ply in absolute terms.   Consumer
 welfare will improve noticeably
 only after the food industries
 and light manufactures dependent
 on agricultural raw materials
 have been able to raise their
 production as a result of this
 year's performance in agriculture.
 Notwithstanding the excellent
 wheat harvest, the Soviet regime
 has not relaxed its 1963 ban on
 the distribution of flour to the
 public,  except for token allot-
 ments allowed in connection with
 major holidays.   The individual
 ration for this year's 7 November
 celebration is the same mea er
 4.4 pounds as last year.

 WEST BERLIN MAYOR AND SOVIET AMBASSADOR EXPLORE DETENTE
 West Berlin's Mayor Willy
 Brandt has indicated that he will
 continue to push his ideas on ex-
 panding the city's, and West Ger-
 many's, contacts with the East.
 Speaking at the Social Democratic
 Party's national meeting in Ber-
 lin on 20 October, Brandt cited
 the attempts of the "great pow-
 ers" to move toward detente as
 justification for his policy of
 attempting to achieve the "most
 orderly coexistence possible."
 Brandt regards expansion of
 West Berlin's economic and cul-
 tural interchange with the East
 as essential to its future growth
 and prosperity, and for nearly a
 year has advocated making the
 city a center for East-West con-
 tacts.   To promote this idea with
 the Soviets--as well as his own
 political future--and probably to
 generate more interest in West
 Berlin's problems both among the
 Western Allies and in Bonn,
 Brandt has met with the USSR's
 envoy   to East Germany, Ambassa-
 dor Abrasimov, on four occasions
 since last spring.   The mayor
 has also authorized West Berlin
 city officials to establish con-
 tacts with Soviet Embassy offi-
 cials and to explore the possi-
 bilities of West Berlin trade
 with Eastern European countries,
 including East Germany.
 There are obvious advantages
 for the Soviets in encouraging
 Brandt's desire to play a role
 in East-West affairs.   It of-
 fers the Soviet Union direct con-
 tact with a potential German
 chancellor--Brandt is the leader
 of the Social Democratic Party--
 and the opportunity to encourage
 dissension between Bonn and West
 Berlin.  These contacts would
 circumvent Walter Ulbricht's ef-
 forts to negotiate with the West
 Berlin government, but Soviet
 officials are not overly con-
 cerned about the East German
 leader's misgivings on such mat-
 ters.   Furthermore,  direct deal-
 ings with West Berlin would
 suit the Soviet  (and,  inciden-
 tally the East German)  thesis
 that the city is a "special po-
 litical entity" and would pro-
 mote a de facto quadripartite

 SPAIN INCREASES PRESSURE ON GIBRALTAR
 Spain is increasing its
 pressure on Gibraltar following
 a fourth inconclusive round of
 talks with the UK over Spanish
 claims to the British colony.
 On 25 October Madrid banned
 trade and vehicular traffic across
 the land frontier at the town of
 La Linea.   It has asked Britain
 to cease using the Gibraltar air-
 field for military planes, charg-
 ing violation of Spanish terri-
 tory.   The Spaniards also main-
 tain that Britain is illegally
 using part of a neutral zone on
 the isthmus for its airfield.
 The British expect further
 harassments,  including an attempt
 to deny them use of the airfield.
 Among these could be complete
 closure
 of the border and

 tional Court of Justice.
 The Spanish Government con-
 tinues to seek US support in the
 dispute.   It notes that US "neu-
 trality"  favors the status quo
 and charges that it is not con-
 sonant with the US'  general anti-
 colonial stand.   Madrid has warned
 of serious repercussions for US
 and Western defense interests if
 it were rebuffed.   It mentioned

 NATO MOVES TOWARD SETTLEMENT OF SOME OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS
 US, British,  and German rep-
 resentatives began their review
 of Alliance strategy and financial
 burden-sharing in Bonn on 20 Oc-
 tober, with NATO Secretary General
 Brosio attending.     It was agreed
 at this meeting to establish three
 working groups to study the three
 phases of the review--threat,
 forces,  and costs.   At their next
 meeting, in Washington on 9 Novem-
 ber,  the principals will go over
 the work of these study groups.
 The initial meeting served to
 highlight the continuing differ-
 ences on how the talks should pro-
 ceed.              The US and Germany are urg-
 ing careful assessment of the So-
 viet threat and of NATO strategy
 and force levels before going on
 to the balance-of-payments ques-
 tion.              The British, on the other
 hand,  are insisting that Germany
 decide quickly on plans to offset
 the UK's foreign exchange cost of
 maintaining forces in Germany. The
 three sides hope to make enough
 progress to enable them to report
 to the NATO foreign ministers
 meeting on 15 and 16 December.
 In an
 persistent
 allies
 selves
 in the
 talks,
 effort to counter the
 protests from the other
 anxious to ensure them-
 as great a role as possible
 outcome of the tripartite
 Brosio and the "big three"
 representatives agreed that ar-
 rangements would be established to
 keep the others informed of the
 progress of the review and that
 any conclusions reached would be
 submitted to them for considera-
 tion.   The protests have continued,
 however.
 As for the French problem,
 Paris has won its point on proce-
 dures for negotiating with the
 other Fourteen allies over the
 role and mission of the French
 forces in Germany.   At the 24 Oc-
 tober meeting of the North Atlan-
 tic Council the Fourteen and the
 French agreed that talks on the
 subject should begin at once be-
 tween SACEUR and the French mili-
 tary, with the Fourteen and the
 French issuing direct and separate
 instructions to their respective
 military representatives at these
 talks. This is the arrangement in-
 itially proposed by the French but
 rejected by the other NATO foreign
 ministers at their meeting last
 June on the grounds that the gen-
 erals needed agreed political in-
 structions from the council be-
 fore beginning their talks.
 Another major NATO problem
 was settled at the 26 October
 meeting when the full North Atlan-
 tic Council unanimously agreed to
 recommend to the NATO foreign min-
 isters that they approve, at their
 December meeting,  the transfer of
 the council from Paris to Brus-
 sels. The break on this issue came
 when the Canadian, German,  and
 Danish council representatives an-
 nounced prior to the meeting that
 their governments were ready to
 drop opposition to the move and
 go along with the majority.   The
 French had repeatedly said they
 would not oppose the relocation of
 the council.

 Middle East - Africa
 TRIPARTITE CONFERENCE IN NEW
 The communique issued on
 24 October following the three-
 day meeting in New Delhi of
 Presidents Tito and Nasir and
 Prime Minister Gandhi contained
 no surprises.   The three leaders
 emphasized economic problems
 facing underdeveloped countries,
 although international attention
 has been focused on the communi-
 que's references to Vietnam.   On
 this issue,  the three merely re-
 peated their previous demands
 for cessation of the bombing of
 North Vietnam "without any pre-
 conditions" and for   participa-
 tion of the National Liberation
 Front as  "one of the main par-
 ties" in any peace negotiations.
 The communique reiterated
 opposition to colonialism and
 racialism in Africa--a standard
 theme at nonaligned conferences.
 The use of economic "pressures"
 against developing countries
 was deplored while developed
 countries were asked to provide
 for easier transfer of resources
 to the less developed countries.
 The communique ignored the
 problems posed by Communist
 China's policies.   Nasir told a
 press conference that there was
 a lack of "full or true" infor-
 mation about China.                           All three
 leaders again supported Peking's
 admission to the UN.
 This tripartite conference,
 the third in a series dating
 DELHI PRODUCES NO SURPRISES
 back to 1956, was originally
 proposed early last spring but
 was put off by the Indians due
 to "pressing internal problems."
 Mrs. Gandhi's final acquiescence
 and her insistence that it be in
 New Delhi probably stemmed from
 a hope that the presence of the
 two other leaders in India would
 enhance her own and the Congress
 Party's prestige in the period
 preceding national elections next
 February.
 Prior to the conference,  the
 three participants found it nec-
 essary to emphasize that a tri-
 partite meeting--not a "non-
 aligned summit conference"--was
 being proposed.   The suspicion
 within several Afro-Asian govern-
 ments that the leaders intended
 to arrogate to themselves the
 role of spokesmen for all non-
 aligned nations was never com-
 pletely overcome, however.
 The communique called for
 continued cooperation among the
 nonaligned states.   However,  in
 view of the paucity of signifi-
 cant results,  the New Delhi meet-
 ing is unlikely to infuse new
 life into the concept of a united
 nonaligned world--a concept which
 has been battered more and more
 often in recent years by divided
 and often conflicting national
 interests.

 CENTO LIKELY TO SURVIVE DESPITE DISSATISFACTION AMONG MEMBERS
 Current rumors predicting
 a serious weakening or even dis-
 solution of the Central Treaty
 Organization  (CENTO)  probably
 reflect no more than   continu-
 ing Pakistani and Iranian dis-
 satisfaction with the organiza-
 tion.   Turkish support,  although
 not enthusiastic in recent years
 does not appear to have weakened.
 Recent trips by Turkish
 President Sunay to Iran and
 Pakistan and by Pakistani Presi-
 dent Ayub Khan to Iran produced
 widespread press speculation in
 Rawalpindi and Tehran that the
 tripartite Regional Cooperation
 for Development  (RCD)  organiza-
 tion--formed by Turkey,  Iran,
 and Pakistan two years ago--
 would be given a new military
 role.   The addition of a mili-
 tary function to what has been
 a purely economic pact would
 bring it in direct competition
 with CENTO, and would be a clear
 indication that the three  "re-
 gional" members of the older
 organization were prepared to
 see CENTO disappear.
 RCD was  formed in  large
 part because the Shah and Ayub
 resented the far-reaching US
 influence in CENTO.   Although
 the US is not a member of CENTO,
 as are the UK,  Iran, Turkey and
 Pakistan,  it provides the bulk
 of CENTO's economic support and
 is a member of the pact's Mili-
 tary Committee.
 CENTO has long been under at-
 tack--especially in Pakistan--
 for being an obstacle to im-
 proved relations with the USSR
 and for its failure to support
 Iran against Iraq and Pakistan
 against India.   Its economic
 contributions, although signif-
 icant in some fields, have not
 always been well publicized in
 the three nations.
 Speculation about an early
 dissolution of CENTO,  however,
 kish officials have denied that
 President Sunay's state visits
 to Iran and Pakistan early this
 month included military. discus-
 sions.
 The three regional members
 have no assurance that they would
 gain politically by weakening
 CENTO,  and RCD lacks the  finan-
 cial backing to assume CENTO's
 economic functions.   Turkey,  Iran,
 and Pakistan appear unlikely to
 make any serious move against
 CENTO, but their support for it
 may continue to diminish. 1    7

 PURGE OF YEMENI GOVERNMENT CONTINUES
 Yemeni President Sallal,  fol-
 lowing Cairo's lead, has culmi-
 nated six weeks of stringent re-
 pressive measures by the trial
 and execution of two former cabi-
 net ministers.  Anti-Egyptian
 Yemeni republicans have meanwhile
 been casting about for ways and
 means to counter Sallal's purge
 without surrendering the few re-
 publican political gains.
 Since President Sallal was
 first returned to Yemen and formed
 a new government by arbitrarily
 dismissing the al-Amri cabinet,
 an increasingly harsh campaign
 of arrests and dismissals has
 been carried out.   This move has
 purged the government of any trace
 of opposition to Sallal's new
 program of complete support for
 hard-line Egyptian policy.
 The number of government
 personnel affected is estimated
 at over 700,  including virtually
 every army commander and every
 civilian member of ex-Premier
 al-Amri's anti-Egyptian govern-

 segment thus far treated lightly

 NIGERIA'S EASTERN REGION AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STILL AT ODDS
 The Eastern Region is boy-
 cotting the interregional consti-
 tutional conference which resumed
 last Monday in Lagos, negating
 the modest progress which had
 been made toward resolving Niger-
 ia's drawn-out governmental cri-
 sis,  and pushing the East closer
 toward de facto independence.
 Eastern military governor
 Ojukwu had laid down stiff pre-
 conditions for the East's attend-
 ance,  including a demand--impos-
 sible for Supreme Commander Gowon
 to meet--for the removal of North-
 ern troops from Lagos and the
 Western Region.   Ojukwu's posi-
 tion has hardened as the weakness
 of the federal government and the
 ineffectiveness of its army be-
 come more apparent, and it is un-
 likely that he is ready to partic-
 ipate in any meaningful dialogue
 on a new constitutional formula
 at this time.
 The East appears anxious,
 nevertheless, to avoid the onus
 for a final breakdown in negotia-
 tions.   A key member of the East-
 ern delegation claimed this week
 that the Easterners had no inten-
 tion of "closing the door" to a
 resumption of talks.   He said the
 East planned to circulate on
 27 October a memorandum setting
 forth its position.   This docu-
 ment, however, will simply re-
 state the East's insistence on a
 constitution providing for a
 loose federal association.   Fur-
 thermore, it will put forward pro-
 posals for an interim governmental
 arrangement which run counter to
 Gowon's announced plan for a 12-
 member civilian advisory committee.
 The East believes that such a
 committee would scheme to entrench
 itself in power.
 Leading Nigeriahs have tried
 but failed to break the deadlock
 between the now almost intractable
 positions of the federal and East-
 ern Region governments.   Northern
 military governor Katsina's speech
 on 18 October expressing "deep
 sorrow" for the atrocities com-
 mitted in the North against East-
 erners was a peace-feeler designed
 to placate Eastern bitterness.   It
 met, however, strong adverse re-
 action from Eastern news media.
 Similarly, the government's essen-
 tially objective statement concern-
 ing its proposed white paper on
 events in Nigeria since January
 1966 had the effect of further
 antagonizing the East.
 Meanwhile, Gowon appears de-
 termined to restore discipline
 among unruly Northern troops.   He
 plans to court-martial the mu-
 tineers in Kano who joined civil-
 ians in slaughtering Ibos from the
 East.   If the trial is held,  it
 will provide a major test of Go-
 won's measure of control over the
 Northern army elements who brought
 him to power.

 FOURTH SUMMIT OF AFRICAN UNITY ORGANIZATION DUE EARLY NEXT MONTH
 The fourth summit confer-
 ence of the Organization of
 African Unity (OAU), scheduled
 to be held in Addis Ababa from
 5 to 9 November,  finds this
 association of 36 independent
 African states seriously flag-
 ging as a result of divisions
 among its members.   For the
 second successive year, many of
 the heads of state and govern-
 ment will be absent.   However,
 all members will probably be
 represented at the preparatory
 Council of ministers session
 which begins on 31 October.
 Presidents Houphouet-Boigny
 of Ivory Coast,  and Bourguiba of
 Tunisia are among those who see
 little use in a summit meeting
 this year.   However, Ethiopia's
 Haile Selassie, whose country is
 host for the OAU's headquarters,
 would lose prestige if the or-
 ganization failed.  He and other
 pan-African-minded leaders such
 as Presidents Toure of Guinea
 and Nasir of Egypt have pushed
 for convening the summit.   They
 hope to revive the ailing OAU
 by focusing attention on southern
 African issues which engage the
 emotions of all Africans.  More-
 over,  certain of the military
 leaders who have come to power
 since the 1965 conference appear
 eager to enhance their prestige
 by attending.
 No direct East-West issues
 have been included on the pro-
 visional agenda, and it is hoped
 that inter-African territorial
 discussions can be thrust into
 the background to keep the spot-
 light on the Rhodesia and South-
 West Africa problems.   However,
 a lively interchange may well
 break out between Ethiopia and
 Somalia over French Somaliland
 which both hope eventually to
 annex.
 The new moderate Ghana re-
 gime and radical Guinea are also
 likely to clash sharply over
 Toure's continued support of
 ousted Ghanaian president Nkru-
 mah.   Should Nkrumah himself at-
 tend, the conference would cer-
 tainly founder,  as many moderate
 leaders would leave in protest.
 There are indications that
 the organization's radically
 oriented secretary general,  Di-
 allo Telli, will come under heavy
 fire at the summit for his free-
 wheeling activism.   He is not
 likely to be ousted, however.

 MOBUTU TRIES TO OUST CONGOLESE PREMIER
 Congolese President Mobutu
 has moved to consolidate his
 position by stripping Premier
 Mulamba of his post.   The popu-
 lar army general is resisting
 the move to oust him, but his
 chances of rallying effective
 support appear slim.
 Mobutu took over the post
 of premier on 26 October and
 designated Mulamba as minister
 of defense.   Mulamba initially
 refused to accept the new post
 and may be belatedly trying to
 round up supporters in the ranks
 of the Congolese National Army
 (ANC)  and among some of the pol-
 iticians who are presently in
 the  bad  graces of Mobutu.
 Mulamba's position in the
 military has made him one of the
 few Congolese officials who has
 a chance of displacing Mobutu.
 However, Mulamba never seems to
 have tried to build his own power
 base and has loyally performed
 those tasks assigned by the Pres-
 ident.   This has not prevented
 Mobutu, as well as most of the
 senior officers in the ANC and
 the civilians in the ruling group,
 from suspecting Mulamba because
 of the latter's friendliness with
 the Belgians,  alleged ties with
 former premier Tshombe',  and per-
 sonal popularity with the ANC
 troops.
 Although Mobutu is the likely
 victor in this showdown, harsh re-
 prisals against Mulamba personally
 or against the Katangan mutineers
 who recently surrendered and other
 alleged supporters of Tshombe
 could further alienate other groups
 in the Congo which are unhappy
 with Mobutu but have lacked the
 strength to oppose him.

 BORDER DISPUTE FLARES UP BETWEEN GUYANA AND VENEZUELA
 A dispute between Venezuela
 and Guyana over ownership of the
 border island of Ankoko resulted
 last week in the sudden dispatch
 of an 80-man Guyanese military
 force to the vicinity of the is-
 land.
 Prime Minister Forbes Burn-
 ham charged in an emotional radio
 address on 14 October that a work
 crew and national guard unit sent
 by Venezuela to construct build-
 ings and a 5,000-foot airstrip
 had encroached on Guyana's part
 of the island.   On the same day,
 during a demonstration by sev-
 eral hundred persons encouraged
 by the government, the flag of
 the Venezuelan Consulate in
 Georgetown was burned.
 The strength of Burnham's
 reaction against the alleged in-
 trusion is in large part the con-
 sequence of his fear that his
 opponents, notably Cheddi Jagan,
 would exploit any sign of weak-
 ness on the part of his govern-
 ment.
 In a diplomatic note of pro-
 test to Venezuela, Burnham took
 the position that the border in
 the area is that agreed to by a
 Venezuelan-British commission
 in 1905.   Venezuela's response
 was that "Ankoko has always been
 Venezuelan."
 The Venezuelan ambassador-
 designate to Guyana has informed
 the US Embassy in Caracas that
 his government had made a cal-
 culated decision to build the
 airstrip on Ankoko in order to
 "catalyze" negotiations on Vene-
 zuela's long-standing claim to
 more than half of Guyana's ter-
 ritory.   According to the dip-
 lomat, his government is increas-
 ingly frustrated by the lack of
 progress made by the joint com-
 mission created to resolve this
 issue.
 Although both sides still
 appear interested in achieving
 a reasonable, quiet settlement,
 Burnham's emotional reaction and
 Venezuela's aggressive attitude
 have created new friction which
 will handicap the work of the
 negotiating commission.   Also,
 the presence of armed forces
 from both countries in the An-
 koko area has increased the pos-
 sibility of a sudden incident
 occurring.

 ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT MOVES TO END LABOR ABUSES
 The imposition of new work
 rules governing Argentina's dock
 workers indicates that the Ongania
 regime intends to pursue vigorously
 its efforts to end privileges long
 abused by various sections of or-
 ganized labor--still dominated by
 Peronist leaders.
 Argentina's longshoremen had
 for years insisted on working short
 shifts,    received outrageously high
 overtime pay,  and made Buenos Aires
 one of the world's most expensive
 ports for shippers.   When the gov-
 ernment announced early in October
 that it intended to put the dock
 workers on longer shifts and have
 the docks operate 24 hours a day,
 the Longshoremen's Union declared
 that it would seek the cooperation
 of all transport workers in call-
 ing a general strike.
 The government moved swiftly,
 announcing its reasons for impos-
 ing the new work rules, taking over
 the union,  and putting the Argen-
 tine Navy in charge of the port of
 Buenos Aires.   Faced with loss of
 their working privileges, the Buenos
 Aires longshoremen began to return
 to work late last week under the
 new rules, undercutting the strike
 call of the union leaders.   Workers
 in other ports accepted the govern-
 ment decree,  and the ports,                although
 still operating at less than normal
 capacity, should soon show greater
 efficiency.
 The government carried out its
 plans even though a meeting of the
 Peronist-dominated General Confed-
 eration of Labor,  (CGT)  at which
 new
 officers were
 to be elected,
 was
 in progress.
 The CGT condemned
 the
 government's
 intervention
 in
 the
 Longshoremen's Union, but
 there
 was
 no sentiment
 to support a
 gen-
 eral
 strike.
 Although the CGT elections
 were largely controlled by Peronist
 moderate Augusto Vandor, some inde-
 pendent union leaders succeeded in
 winning election to the executive
 council.    The confederation repre-
 sents some 70 percent of organized
 labor in Argentina.   It has criti-
 cized the government's labor poli-
 cies, but has generally cooperated
 with the government and obeyed its
 decrees.   A group led by Jose. Alonso,
 who still takes his orders from Juan
 Peron in Madrid, boycotted the CGT
 election.   This group has diverged
 from the mainstream of organized
 labor,  and may be losing some of
 its following.
 This month's events indicate
 that the "truce" which has prevailed
 between Peronist elements and the
 Ongania regime is continuing, de-
 spite labor's growing unhappiness
 with government labor policy.   On-
 gania expected some trouble with
 the dock workers, but has said that
 his major problem will come when new
 work rules for railroad workers, who
 are just as inefficient as the long-
 shoremen,  come into effect in Novem-
 ber.   The railroad workers'  union,
 probably stronger than the long-
 shoremen's, may give the regime its
 first major labor trouble.

 PARAGUAYAN PRESIDENT SEEKS OPPOSITION COOPERATION
 President Stroessner is ap-
 parently seeking the cooperation
 of some of the opposition politi-
 cal groups in Paraguay in his ef-
 forts to replace the 1940 consti-
 tution and thereby permit his re-
 election to the presidency.
 Since assuming power in 1954,
 Stroessner has sought to give a
 legal basis to his rule.   Although
 authoritarian he has gradually re-
 laxed the controls on individual
 and press freedom while giving
 the country stability.   Stroes-
 sner is a popular president and
 even the opposition recognizes
 that his re-election would be in
 the nation's best interest, but
 the present constitution allows
 a president to serve only two
 terms.   Stroessner's present term
 expires in 1968.   If a new con-
 stitution is adopted, Stroessner
 could be elected for a first term
 under it at the end of this term
 and could legally remain in the
 presidency for still another term
 as well.
 constitutional
 draft when actually
 revealed in
 the
 Colorado Party
 convention
 held
 last month did
 not include
 the
 liberal provi-
 sions that
 had
 originally been
 discussed.
 Stroessner reportedly would
 like to have at least some repre-
 sentatives of the opposition po-
 litical parties participate in
 the constitutional convention,
 which will probably be held late
 this year or early next.   He re-
 cently met with Rafael Franco,
 leader of the Febrerista Party,
 in an apparent bid for coopera-
 tion.   The Febreristas are now a
 recognized party, but were once
 banned for subversive activity.
 The bulk of the Liberals,  the
 major opposition party,  is still
 illegal and considered subversive
 by Stroessner.   Only a small Lib-
 eral faction, called the Levi-
 Liberals,  is actually seated in
 the legislature.
 When the ruling Colorado
 Party politicians first began to
 discuss the constitutional revi-
 sion this year, they indicated
 that the new document would be
 more liberal than the existing
 one.   It would have given the
 legislature more influence in
 government, especially in deciding
 when to declare a state of siege--
 a situation in which the president
 exercises dictatorial powers.   The
 Stroessner probably will
 permit the opposition little more
 than token representation in re-
 writing the constitution, but his
 efforts to give his regime more
 of at least the trappings of de-
 mocracy   support his professions
 that he wants to develop a viable
 political system in a nation that
 has known little else but dicta-
 torship or political strife          25X1
 throughout most of its history.

 ANTI-DUVALIER SENTIMENT GROWS IN HAITI
 25X1
 In addition to the peren-
 nial plotting against the Duvalier
 regime which continues in Port-
 au-Prince, new signs of public
 disaffection have recently sur-
 faced in Haiti's outlying dis-
 tricts.
 J President Duvalier, as
 usual, has acted quickly to pre-
 vent this unrest from solidifying
 into a possible challenge to his
 authority,  and his tough measures
 are likely to prove effective as
 they have in the past.
 The first manifestation of
 increased unrest was a seemingly
 spontaneous demonstration in the
 coastal city of Gonaives on 3 Oc-
 tober.  This was touched off when
 a local tax collector attempted
 to collect fees in the town's
 market area.   Some of the people
 refused to pay and many shouted
 antiregime slogans.   Militia in
 the area did nothing to stop the
 demonstration, which reportedly
 continued for about two hours.
 The unrest at Goanives,  among
 people who are normally apathetic,
 subsequently spread to two other
 25X1     coastal cities, where
 anti regime
 leaflets were distributed.   This
 occurred while US naval forces
 were in the country participating
 in relief activities following
 Hurricane Inez.   The coincidence
 of these activities apparently
 encouraged the various groups in
 Port-au-Prince long engaged in
 conspiracies against Duvalier
 to believe that their prospects
 of success had improved.   This
 is probably not the case, al-
 though there may be more than the
 usual amount of restiveness among
 the Haitian military, partly in-
 duced by the regime's frequent
 delays in paying salaries.
 Duvalier is fully aware of
 the potential dangers to his po-
 sition these signs of unrest con-
 note.   He has ordered the trans-
 fers of a number of officers to
 prevent a coalescence of anti-
 regime sentiment in the military.
 In addition, Duvalier has stepped
 up police surveillance of sus-
 pected trouble makers.
 Notwithstanding the indi-
 cations of increasing unrest,
 Duvalier's opposition--including
 that within the military--lacks
 the organization which would be
 required to mount a serious ef-
 fort against Duvalier at the
 present time.   A spontaneous act
 against the "President-For-Life"
 by someone with frequent access
 to the closely guarded Presi-
 dential Palace, however   is al-
 ways a possibility.

 NEW DEMONSTRATIONS PROBABLE I N PANAMA
 Students and urban slum-
 dwellers, Panama's most volatile
 and discontented elements, may
 soon instigate another series of
 antigovernment and anti-US demon-
 strations.   Celebrations on 3,  4,
 5,  and 28 November honoring na-
 tional independence and the Pana-
 manian flag have traditionally
 been occasions for extremist-led
 political agitation.
 A recent student incursion
 into the Canal Zone may fore-
 shadow additional acts of this
 nature.   On 20 October a small
 group of flag-carrying Communist-
 led secondary students was inter-
 cepted by zone police near the
 governor's residence.   Before
 they were dispersed the students
 shouted slogans, threw several
 "cherry bomb" firecrackers, and
 taunted police.   The incident was
 reminiscent of the one that
 sparked the anti-US riots in
 January 1964.
 Opposition leader Arnulfo
 Arias, in his efforts to dis-
 credit President Robles, has
 been encouraging extremist ele-
 ments to agitate against the
 government
 commitment
 Arias is likely to
 attempt to exploit any outbreak of
 antiregime activity during the up-
 coming anniversaries to undermine
 public confidence in the Panama-
 nian President.
 The National Guard is alert
 to the possibility of trouble and
 can be expected to take precaution-
 ary measures.   President Robles has
 consistently frustrated moves by
 extremists to initiate prolonged
 disorders and should be able to
 maintain order

 MOVES AGAINST GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS MAY SPUR NEW TERRORISM
 Guatemala's Communists ap-
 pear likely to renew terrorist
 activity on a wide scale in an
 effort to divert army units now
 encircling guerrilla redoubts
 in the mountains of the north-
 east.
 There are indications that
 the army is having  greater suc-
 cess in its present antiguerrilla
 campaign than in others in the
 past.    Its operations have led
 to several engagements with the
 guerrillas,  and its forces have
 reportedly killed 16 extremists
 and captured weapons and sup-
 plies.                       The encirclement tactic
 has been under way for several
 weeks, and the guerrillas now
 are concerned that they will be
 unable to break out.
 A full-scale revival of
 guerrilla terrorist activity
 therefore appears possible.
 Such activity on widely dis-
 persed fronts would be diffi-
 cult for the army to handle
 and could cause a further de-
 cline in public confidence in
 the government.
