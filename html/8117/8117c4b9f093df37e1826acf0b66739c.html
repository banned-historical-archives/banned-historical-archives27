CHINA'S REGIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEADERS: 
THE PURGE OF THE MILITARY, 
TEL RISE OF OLD PARTY CADRES 
MEMORANDUM FOR RECIPIENTS 
This report traces the steady if slow 
progress of Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai in attempt-
ing to restore civilian control of the governing 
apparatus in China, at the regional and provincial 
levels, after years of dominance by the PLA. 
The purge of Lin Piao and other military 
leaders is seen as part of this effort. At the 
regional level, where power has been held entirely 
by career military men, several military leaders 
have been purged, and the power of others is being 
diluted. At the provincial level, many Party 
secretaries are missing, most of whom are career 
military men, the new secretaries are almost all 
old Party cadres. 
The report speculates on other things that 
Peking may do in order to establish civilian con-
trol at all levels. It finds, however, that there 
is a considerable distance to go, and it leaves

open the question of whether the aim can be 
accomplished in the lifetime of either Mao or 
Chou. Also, it points to the possibility of 
a civilian-military showdown in the post-Mao 
period. 
In preparing this report, this staff has 
received constructive assistance from the Central 
Reference Service and the Office of Current Intel-
ligence, both of which contributed substantially.

CHINA'S REGIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEADERS: 
THE PURGE OF THE MILITARY, 
THE RISE OF OLD PARTY CADRES 
Principal Observations  
Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai are moving to 
restore civilian control of the governing apparatus 
at the regional and provincial levels, as well as at 
the national level, although the pace at the regional 
and provincial levels remains slow. 
Even prior to the purge of Lin Piao and other 
central military leaders, Mao had defined the main 
issue in Chinese internal politics as the role of the 
military. At the regional and provincial levels, 
military domination of the government apparatus was 
striking. The only regional authorities were the 
Military Region headquarters, almost all of which 
were in the hands of apparent proteges of Lin. And 
of the 29 provincial-level Party committees, 20 were 
headed by career military men, and almost all were 
heavily staffed with them; of all provincial-level 
Party secretaries, about 60 percent were career 
military men, the great majority of whom held important 
military posts concurrently. Many of these military 
men had not been properly responsive to the principle 
of 'Party leadership": too often, decisions affecting 
local work were being made by military Party committees 
and carried out without adequate reference to local 
Party committees or to the civilian members of them.

The decapitation of the PLA central leadership 
in September 1971 had obvious implications for regional 
and provincial leaders. Still other conspirators had 
to be apprehended. Those long associated with the 
principals had to be re-examined. Those who were un-
willing to accept the principle of civilian Party control 
of the military had to be replaced. This would mean 
the purge and reorganization of some of the MR head-
quarters and many of the provincial Party committees 
and military districts. 
The purge in fact moved quickly to the regional 
and provincial levels, taking two MR commanders and two 
MR first political officers (out of 22 such positions) 
and several provincial military leaders -- a group which 
included several men who were concurrently first secre-
taries of provincial Party committees. Since that first 
wave the purge has remained at the provincial and army 
level, but has included additional military leaders who 
were concurrently provincial first and second secretaries. 
The number of missing secretaries, as of early 
July 1973, is 31 (about one-fifth of the total number of 
provincial Party secretaries as of September 1971), of 
whom four (all PLA men) are or were the first secretaries 
of their provinces, and 10 (all PLA men) were second-
ranking secretaries. In all, at least 17 of the missing 
secretaries are career military men, almost all known 
or believed to have held important military posts at 
the time of their disappearance. Most of these missing 
military-political leaders have been reported purged 
or seem to have been purged in connection with the Lin 
Piao affair: as alleged conspirators or supporters, 
as longtime associates, or as leaders of military units 
to which Lin's group allegedly looked for support. At 
the same time, several proteges of Lin and other purged 
leaders remain active and in apparent favor. Some have 
evidently persuaded Mao of their loyalty, while others 
may have been marked for purging later -- one by one, 
in order to avoid provoking coordinated resistance.

A few of the missing military-political leaders 
-- career military men who are or were provincial-
level Party secretaries -- have probably been purged 
or set aside not for actual or alleged involvement in 
the Lin Piao affair but on grounds of principle: that 
is, their actual or alleged resistance to civilian 
Party control. This could mean either their poor 
responsiveness to directives from Peking or their 
failure to cooperate satisfactorily with the civilian 
secretaries of provincial-level Party committees. 
There has been a steady if undramatic improve-
ment in the position of old Party cadres vis-a-vis 
military leaders in the regional and provincial struc-
tures of power in the past year. It is true that most 
of the regional military leaders remain in power, that 
the military Party committees are still the only known 
regional Party organs, and that most of the Party com-
mittees in provinces containing MR headquarters are 
still headed by career military men who are active MR 
leaders. However, old Party cadres are being increas-
ingly installed as senior political officers in those 
MR headquarters, and may be acting as first secretaries 
of some military Party committees at that level. More-
over, the known first secretaries of other provinces 
-- those not containing MR headquarters -- are either 
old Party cadres or career military men no longer 
identified in military posts in those provinces. 
Further, old Party cadres hold the great majority of 
the identified posts of first political officers of 
the 27 Military Districts or major Garrisons. 
As things now stand, 18 of the first secretaries 
(or senior secretaries on the spot) of provincial or 
major municipal Party committees are career military 
men, while 11 are old Party cadres. However, of the 
170-odd secretaries of all ranks known or believed to 
be active, the balance is now even between career

25X1 
military men and old Party cadres. Of the 45 
identified new secretaries -- added since August 
1971 -- the great majority are known or believed 
to be old Party cadres. 
There are other things that Peking is now 
doing, or is expected to do, or can do, to help to 
restore civilian Party control at all levels. These 
include the reaffirmation of the Party chairman's 
authority over the PLA, the naming of a civilian 
as chairman (if any) of the regime, the reconstitution 
of the Politbu-o standing committee and the full 
Politburo to assure civilian domination, the addi-
tion of old Party cadres to the Military Affairs 
Committee and its General Political Department, 
the exclusion of PLA figures from leading positions 
in the political security apparatus, and the 
extension of a political security network into the 
PLA at regional and provincial levels. Some outside 
possibilities are the naming of a civilian as 
Minister of Defense, the early re-establishment of 
Party regional bureaus, and the reorganization of 
military-dominated provincial committees to separate 
principals who have long worked together. 
Whether civilian Party control of the govern-
ing apparatus throughout China can be fully restored 
in Mao's lifetime, or even in Chou's, is impossible 
to judge. Although another direct challenge to Mao 
seems unlikely, some of the military leaders at all 
levels may be preparing for a showdown, at some point 
in the post-Mao period, with the civilian Party leaders.

CHINA'S REGIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEADERS: 
THE PURGE OF THE MILITARY 
THE RISE OF OLD PARTY CADRES 
I. THE REGIONAL-PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP AS OF 1971 
One of the most striking features of the Lin 
Piao affair was that the regional and provincial 
governing apparatus constructed during the period of 
Lin's decline and fall was dominated by military 
figures, many of them Lin's proteges, and that the 
Party's civilian leaders in Peking in this same period 
were greatly concerned with the issue of civilian 
versus military control of that apparatus. As of 
August 1971, when Mao began the "inspection tour" in 
which he told regional and provincial military-political 
leaders something of his plans to cv.rry out a purge 
and to re-establish cvilian Party control, the military's 
domination of the governing apparatus outside Peking 
was at its height. There were no regional authorities 
apart from the.11 Military Region headquarters, all 
but one of which (Peking) were in the hands of apparent 
proteges of Lin; these headquarters seemed to be 
answerable only to the Military Affairs Committee, 
itself headed de facto by Lin and composed almost en-
tirely of proteTei?UT?Lin. And of the 29 provincial-
level Party committees -- 26 provinces, three major 
municipalities, the last of which had just been pro-
claimed in late August -- fully 20 were headed by career 
military men, the other nine included career military men 
in leading posts, and of the 150-odd secretaries and 
deputy secretaries about 60 percent were career military.

when the Party apparatus was destroyed in 1966-1967; 
and from January 1967 -- when Mao directed the PLA to 
intervene to "support the Left" -- the PLA constituted 
the effectual government of China outside Peking (and 
to a large degree in Peking itself). The PLA's political 
role was to be temporary; Lin Piao himself said in 
March 1967 that the PLA would be removed from its 
"dominant position in local units" as soon as new 
leaders could be found. But new leaders -- in the 
form of old Party cadres -- were not generally avail-
able; many of the old provincial-level secretaries had 
been purged, and most of the rest were undergoing re-
education, under the supervision of the PLA. 
The PLA's performance i 
in 1967 was uneven.  7

 _iin some provinces 
and municipalities the PLA did in fact support the 
"rebels" then or later judged to be Maoist, in others 
the PLA initially suppressed the groups finally vin-
dicated as Maoist, and in others the PLA split, sup-
porting contending groups.* 
*Some of the PLA leaders praised for their perform-
ance in this period were later removed from their 
leading posts in these provinces, while some who 
performed poorly in this period were later named to 
leading posts. In general, the record of any given 
PLA leader in this first confused period was appar-
ently not the main determinant of his later fate.

It was Mao's intention from the start that a 
reformed Party ("revolutionary cadres") lead the 
revolutionary committees -- provisional organs of 
power -- then being formed. And in fact, of the 13 
provincial-level committees formed by early February 
1968, seven were placed under first secretaries who 
were old Party cadres. 
Continuing disorder, however, apparently led 
to a decision to place these new committees largely 
in the hands of military leaders. Of the 16 provin-
cial-level committees formed between early February 
and September, only two were awarded to old Party 
cadres, while 14 were given to career military men 
(nine commanders, five political officers). By 
September 1968 the pattern had been formed which was 
to persist until Lin Piao's fall three years later: 
20 of the 29 provincial-level committees were led 
by career military men, and almost all of the most im-
portant of them -- in the provinces containing MR 
headquarters -- were headed by proteges of Lin Piao. 
Mao was visibly dissatisfied with the perform-
ance of the PLA as China's de facto government out-
side of Peking. In his speech to the first plenum 
of the new Central Committee in April 1969, at several 
points he enjoined the PLA to "work carefully," to 
avoid arrogance and complacency, and to proceed with 
particular care in its leading role in rebuilding the 
Party.* By Army Day (1 August) 1969, these admonitions 
*Mao showed some sympathy for PLA leaders who had 
made "mistakes" in dealing with mass organizations, 
on the grounds that it had indeed been hard to dis-
tinguish friends from enemies. The.opaque and some-
times conflicting directives from Peking had not much 
helped.

had risen to the level of a campaign to ensure that 
the PLA work carefully and modestly, and under "Party" 
leadership, People's Daily found it necessary to 
reaffirm that veteran Party cadres were well qualified 
to assume leading positions in the rebuilt Party ap-
paratus, and Red Flas, charged the leading cadres of 
the revolutionary committees -- mainly PLA men -- with 
offenses against the principle of "collective leader-
ship": namely, slighting or even suppressing the 
views of civilian members (old Party cadres and mass 
representatives), and conducting "one-man rule".. The is-
sue of civilian versus military control of the appara-
tus, which was to become and to remain the central is-
sue in Chinese internal politics, was shaping up. 
The Fact of Military Domination: As is now 
well known from the Party's massiveZYcumentation of 
the Lin Piao affair, Lin and other central military 
leaders are charged with having conspired, prior to the 
Party plenum of August 1970, to make a "surprise at-
tack" during that plenum. Some of these leaders (al-
though not the most important ones) were in fact re-
moved from their posts later in 1970. The Party further 
contends that Lin by the end of 1970 had concluded that 
he was to be purged, and that he began in desperation 
to' make his plans for a coup, including a plan for 
the assassination of Mao if necessary.* It is one 
It is apparent from the course of Party policy in 
1969-70 that Mao was turning increasingly to Chou En-
Zai, and Chou probably played a larger role in chang-
ing Mao's mind about Lin than can be documented

on by Mao and Chou would not and indeed could not be

basic assumption of this paper that these essentials of 
the Party's story are true. 
But the fact remains that it was just at that 
time -- December 1970 -- that the new provincial-level 
Party committees began to surface in the same pattern 
as had the earlier revolutionary committees and Party 
core groups in the years in which Lin was clearly Mao's 
favorite and his designated successor: a pattern of 
domination of these committees by career military men, 
and of the most important of them by proteges of Lin.* 
The considerations that led Mao -- and Chou, as the 
Party's de facto secretary general from 1970 -- to 
confirm military leaders outside Peking as concurrently 
the leaders of most of the new Party committees seem 
*The new Party committees in provinces containing 
Military Region headquarters were -- in nine of 11 
cases -- headed by either the military commander or 
the first political officer of the MR, or both. There 
were two exceptions: one (Yunnan) in which the first 
secretary, although first political officer of the MR, 
was a career Party cadre rather than military man, and 
another (Hopei) in which the MR headquarters was not 
in the provincial capital. Eleven other provincial 
Party committees (in addition to those nine) were 
headed by career military men, usually either the com-
mander or first political officer of the provincial 
Military District. In the nine (of 29) provincial-
ZeveZ Party committees headed by old Party cadres 
(Hopei, five other provinces, and the three major 
municipalities), the MD or Garrison commander was 
almost always among the subordinate secretaries, and 
in all cases career military men were.

to have been a combination of practicality and prudence. 
These leaders were in place, and were probably the 
most experienced and capable at hand. They probably 
could not yet have been replaced en masse by old Party 
cadres. Although many old Party cadres were in fact 
named to the new Party committees, some of them as first 
secretaries, Peking apparently did not have enough to 
go around; old Party cadres in general had not been "reha-
bilitated" in the eyes of Peking or the populace, and 
only a few of the "rehabilitated" (those few who were 
in fact named) had the experience in high-level posts 
to qualify them to be first secretaries. Moreover, a 
failure to confirm the military in their political 
posts -- that is, a general sweeping-out of men long 
accepted as the local leaders -- might have been seriously 
disruptive to public order, still precarious in many 
provinces. Further, Mao had not completed his prepara-
tions for a purge of Lin Piao and his proteges in Peking; 
he had not yet, for example, got the assurances of the 
regional military-political leaders that they would sup-
port him against Lin and his group in a showdown, and 
he had apparently not yet fixed the time for a purge. 
(The 12-13 September date seems to have been precipitated 
by receipt of information on Lin's plans.) Mao and 
Chou might understandably have preferred not to move 
against any of the military leaders outside Peking 
while they were still seeking assurances of support 
from important figures among them, and before the 
purge in Peking had been carried out. 
Party briefings have stated the main considera-
tion in terms of self-imposed restraint, of unwilling-
ness to move against Lin and his central proteges 
-- with all of the implications that would have for 
military leaders outside Peking -- until Mao and Chou 
had what they felt to be proof of conspiracy. (In some 
of those statements, Party leaders are quoted as defining

the possible consequences of action, in the absence 
of such proof, as "civil war.") This was of course 
an admission of a degree of weakness -- of inability, 
that is, simply to order a massive purge, on the Stalin-
ist model. It was a position of weakness even as 
compared with the first year of the Cultural Revolu-
tion, when Mao had in fact ordered and carried out the 
destruction of the Party apparatus. But the PLA was 
-- as it remains -- a much more formidable antagonist. 
These considerations did not deter Mao from in-
tensifying his campaign of "rectification" of the PLA. 
Military administrators at all levels continued to 
be criticized for arrogance and complacency, and the 
Military Regions were directed to conduct self-examina-
tions. The Military Region leaders themselves were 
the main problem, as there was no civilian Party check 
on them at their level -- no regional Party apparatus, 
as in the old days; and in their capacities as first 
secretaries of the Party committees of the provinces 
containing MR neadquarters they were in a position 
simply to impose their wills on those committees. 
At all levels, the leaders of PLA Party committees were 
too often making the decisions -- not simply "military" 
decisions but decisions relating to the full range of 
political and economic tasks of local governments --
and carrying them out either without adequate refer-
ence to the local Party committees or in their second 
hats as the heads of those local Party committees. 
Moreover, they were sometimes forcing the local Party 
committees to seek PLA approval of their own actions. 
Peking's prescription at the time was that PLA leaders 
should voluntarily correct themselves: that is, accept 
the subordination of PLA Party committees to local 
Party committees, or, where PLA leaders themselves 
headed local Party committees, to give larger roles 
to the civilian members of these committees. It seemed 
apparent that the PLA leaders were resisting this 
counsel; that is, they enjoyed their power, and meant 
to keep it.

Mao's Talks with Regional Leaders: 
  in August 1971, as the last of the new 
provincial-level Party committees was being proclaimed, 
Mao had a series of talks with regional and provincial 
military-political leaders in South and East China 
-- talks in which Mao made his case against Lin and 
other central military leaders, appealed for the support 
of regional and provincial leaders, and pointed toward 
a process in which civilian Party control of the mili-
tary would be re-established,* 
Mao's emphasis was on the need 
for "unity" (behind himself) and for an end to "con-
spiracy" (against himself), He reviewed the history 
of "splits" and conspiracies in the Party, treating 
the central military leaders soon to be purged as the 
most recent of such groups. He went into detail on 
the offenses of these central leaders, beginning with 
their collusion prior to the August 1970 plenum. Mao 
expressed disbelief that these leaders could "correct 
their mistakes even if they tried to do so." 
Mao went on to speak of or-
ganizational steps against these leaders that he had 
already taken. He made clear, however, that these 
steps were not sufficient, and that he would need the 
support of other military leaders for a forthcoming 
purge of the central leaders. He expressed confidence 
-- judging from other developments, more confidence 
*There is no verbatim account of any of these talks. 
A "summary" of them was circulated by the Central Com-
mittee in March 1972. Mao's remarks may have been 
emended as well as summarized, but the summary books

than he actually felt -- that the central military lead-
ers in disfavor would not be able to command any sub-
stantial portion of the PLA to "rebel" against him.

25X1 
Mao told these audiences that 25X1 
they should now be devoting more attention than they 
had in recent years to strictly military affairs (in 
other words, they were to think of themselves as again 
primarily soldiers), and that in their political roles 
-- e.g0 as provincial Party secretaries -- they were 
to conduct their affairs differently. It is important 
to recognize that Mao did not tell them that they were 
to be deprived of their political posts: they were 
to continue to occupy military and political posts 
concurrently. But they were to study the Party line, 
to correct "wrong practices" in their style of work, 
and to avoid the "mountain-stronghold" attitude. 
Specifically, local Party committees (now proclaimed 
in every province), rather than PLA Party committees, 
were to exercise the coordinating leadership; it was 
wrong, Mao said, for PLA Party committees to override 
or overrule the local Party committees. 
Mao went on to make clear that 
old Party cadres would be playing a larger role in the 
governing apparatus. He defended the purge of the 
leaders of the Party apparatus in 1966, but reiterated 
that the great majority of cadres were good and would 
be rehabilitated and given posts. 
Finally, Mao in these talks 
offered the regional and provincia military-political 
leaders an opportunity to redeem themselves. They had 
made mistakes, but the fault was not primarily in them

but rather in the group of central leaders who had 
"deceived" them. They were to undergo criticism and 
self-criticism and "correct their mistakes." 
Soon thereafter, Mao was to return to Peking, 
in circumstances which apparently precipitated the 
flight of the Lins and some lesser conspirators.. On 
the same night (12-13 September), a meeting of Party 
leaders was convened, and continued for several days.

were made in this meeting against other Politburo-

II. THE PURGE SINCE SEPTEMBER 1971 
The decapitation of the PLA leadership in 
September 1971 left Mao and Chou and their supporters  
with still a lot to do, outside Peking.  r' 
conspirators would have to be apprehended as quickly 
as possible. Others who had had long and close 
association with Lin and other conspirators had to ' 
be re-examined and re-evaluated, and if necessary 
removed, as opportunity permitted. And those who 
seemed to be unwilling to support Mao and Chou on 
what had become the central policy issue ir that 
struggle -- that of civilian Party control of the 
apparatus -- would also have to be replaced. But 
Mao on his own showing could not afford a confronta-
tion with the PLA as a whole or with a largl number 
of PLA leaders simultaneously. He could move only 
in stages, against small groups, taking care not to 
provoke coordinated resistance. The questions were 
open as to how rapidly Mao and Chou would move 
against any group except the identified conspirators, 
whether there would prove to be some groups (e.g0 
powerful regional leaders) against whom Mao would 
lack the confidence to move, and whether there 
might be successful resistance at any point.

aready in trouble -- especially in Chekiang and Ninghsia; 
(b) at the leaders of another province, Kiangsi, headed 
by a longtime protege of Lin Piao; and (c) at an ap-

purely Party cadres, without concurrent military posts

were thought to be involved. 
The third wave of the purge, roughly the rest 
of 1972 and the first two months of 1973 (as those 
who have failed to appear only since March have not been 
out of sight long enough to qualify for a "missing" 
list), seems on present evidence to have been a smaller 
and weaker wave than were the first two. It still 
struck at some military-political leaders, however, 
charged with supporting Lin Piao's group. The pre-
viously-mentioned two ranking secretaries on the 
Kweichow committee, who had not been seen since April 
1971, are said to have been actually purged in 
summer 1972; and Pu Chan-ya, the second-ranking 
secretary of the Hunan Committee and 1st Political 
Officer of that MD, last seen in late 1972, has since 
been reported purged as one of the conspirators. 
Some other important figures dropped out of

include: Wei Tsu-chen, second-ranking secretary 
in the Kwangsi Committee and probably a military

cadre and secretary in Sinkiang who was said to be 
an important power there after the purge of the 1st 
Secretary. (Wang Hsin, second-ranking secretary 
and political officer in Honan, has reappeared, but 
at the bottom of the list, and may be on his way out.) 
Except for the first-mentioned Wei Tsu-chen, who spent 
many years with Lin Piao and other disgraced military 
leaders and may have been caught up in that case, 
these absences are inexplicable. 
Some Figures and Propositions: The total 
number of missing provincial Party secretaries as of 
early July -- a figure which does not include those 
missing only in recent months, or those who are just 
possibly secretaries, or those demoted and fading --
is 31, out of about 200 identified secretaries. 
Several of them are members or alternate members of 
the Central Committee, but, of much greater importance, 
four of them (all PLA) were the first secretaries in 
their provinces, and ten of them (all PLA) were second 
or second-ranking secretaries. In all, at least 17 
of the missing 31 secretaries are career military men, 
almost all of whom are known or believed to have held 
important military posts concurrently with their posts 
as provincial Party secretaries. 
Some 14 (at most) of the missing secretaries 
are career Party cadres, mass representatives, or un-
knowns. None of these was a first or second secretary. 
The 17 (or more) missing provincial secretaries 
who are career military men who had active military 
posts concurrently are clearly a much more important 
and interesting lot. The striking common feature among 
the largest number of these missing military/political 
leaders -- among, in fact, 13 of them -- is their 
reported association with the Lin Piao affair. Others 
have been less firmly associated. The conclusion seems

justified that Mao and Chou and other leaders in power 
and favor genuinely believe that Lin Piao's group was  
conspiring against them/ 
/An alterna-
tive explanation, that Mao and others are simply playing 
off old scores from the Cultural Revolution  
  can-
not be disproven but does not seem to hold up; it does 
not seem to explain either the timing or the targets 
of the purge.* 
It is also a striking fact that at least a dozen 
provincial Party secretaries, all of them career mili-
tary men with concurrent military posts, who had been 
regarded as proteges of Lin Piao and other purged lead-
ers are not missing and appear to be in favor and prosper-
ing. These include several commanders and first poli-
tical officers of Military Regions, some of whom are 
the first secretaries of the Party committees of the 
provinces in which their MR headquarters are located. 25X1 
These dozen or so are men who, in general, were not 
as close to Lin as the purged central leaders or the 
regional and provincial figures named 
as fellow conspirators, but who were proteges 25X1 
in the conventional sense: 'records of substantial early

*This is not to deny the possibility -- even prob-

Peking are exploiting the Lin Piao affair, even fabricat-
ing evidence against old antagonists, and that some 
of the missing can be explained on this basis. But this 
wcuZd be a Lgszliva feature of the current purge, 
The central feature is the Mao-Chou effort to identify 
those who were engaged in conspiracy or were prepared to 
support the conspirators in either victory or temporary 
defeat.

service with Lin, preferment given them by Lin after 
he became Minister of Defense, additional favor shown 
them during the Cultural Revolution, and, in some cases, 
expression by themselves of loyalty to Lin. Good 
examples are Liu Hsing-yuan, as of early 1972 1st Poli-
tical Officer of the Canton MR and 1st Secretary of the 
Kwangtung Committee of the CCP, who has re-emerged in 
1973 in the same roles in troubled Szechuan, and Han 
Hsien-chu, Commander of the Foochow MR and 1st Secre-
tary of the Fukien Committee of the CCP. It would 
not have been surprising to see both purged. But 
both appear to have found the key to survival: to 
have persuaded Mao that they are loyal to him person-
ally, despite their past ties to Lino] 
/ Some of the 
other Lin proteges who survive haveevidently taken 
the same path, while others may yet fall when Mao 
and Chou get around to them. 
The missing military-political leaders whose 
absence cannot be explained by the Lin Piao affair are 
probably men who have been purged or set aside -- perhaps 
under prolonged investigation -- on the issue of civil-
ian-ve\sus-military control of the governing apparatus. 
This could mean either their lack of responsiveness 
to directives from Peking or their failure to cooperate 
satisfactorily (a matter which has itself been the 
subject of a number of directives from Peking) with 
civilian secretaries and other civilian members of pro-
vincial-level Party 'committees, 
With respect to both groups -- the conspirators 
and the resisters -- there is as yet no good evidence 
that any military-political leader has been spared 
because Mao and Chou have been afraid to move against 
him, or that anyone has put up successful resistance

to his purging. In the simplest terms, it is doubt-
ful that any given leader has been actually summoned 
to Peking and has refused the summons. From the first 
days of the Cultural Revolution, powerful military 
leaders have repeatedly been summoned to Peking 
-- sometimes in large groups -- and have obediently 
gone. It would seem that only the most desperate 
leader -- someone in a state of mind like that of the 
desperate Lin Piao planning his "coup" -- could cal-
culate that his best chance of survival would lie in 
trying to hold his area of command against all the 
military force that could be brought to bear against 
it, rather than going to Peking to attempt to clear 
himself. Those who have failed to satisfy the leaders 
in Peking have normally if not always been brought to 
Peking and held there, just as simply as Mao and Chou 
in September 1971 convened a meeting of military lead-
ers and arrested Lin's central and closest proteges 
on the spot. 
But the possibility that Mao and Chou are even 
now not yet ready to move against certain military 
leaders has to be regarded as genuine. It is possible, 
that is, that Mao and Chou are still secretly worried 
about some of the Military Region leaders, and would 
like to get rid of them, but have chosen to wait. This 
is possible despite the fact that four very important 
MR leaders were removed in the first wave of the post-
Lin purge, and despite the fact that all or almost 
all of the remaining MR leaders have apparently spent 
some time in Peking since Lin's fall. In other words, 
it is possible .that some of the military leaders summoned 
to Peking, and then returned to their posts apparently 
cleared, were secretly jueged to be unreliable, and 
have been marked for later purging. It seems likely 
that Mao and Chou are still taking great care to avoid 
provoking cbordinated resistance by a substantial 
number of the remaining MR leaders (the only way that

some of them, with deliberation, one by one, in months

to be good evidence that MR leaders have not only 
cleared themselves but are being given credit for 
playing important roles in bringing down Lin Piao's 
group or at least for preserving good order in their 
commands while this was being done, so that their 
positions look to be as secure as positions ever are 
in Mao's China.

III. THL RISE OF OLD PARTY CADPES 
It was apparent in Mao's talks with the regional 
and provincial leaders in August-September 1971 that 
he intended to enhance the position of old Party cadres 
vis-a-vis career military men in the regional-provincial 
structure of power. This has in fact been happening, 
although slowly. The power of the Military Region 
leaders is being diluted by the installation of old 
Party cadres as political officers in those headquart-
ers, and there is a higher proportion -- than at the 
time of Lin Piao's fall -- of old Party cadres among 
the first secretaries and all other secretaries of 
the provincial Party committees.* 
*The public media have spoken more precisely than 
did Mao (whose pronouncements are sometimes rambling 
and opaque) about the principle of the Party's 
"absolute leadership," the need for a center and 
obedience to that center, the need for "collective 
leadership" in Party organs at all levels (entailing 
a reduction in the importance of the first secretaries), 
the enhancement of the role of old Party. cadres vis-
a-vie the military, and the subordination of military 
Party committees to local Party committees. Provincial 
broadcasts from all of Lin's onetime regional centers 
of power have dutifully joined in repudiating Lin 
(although still not by name) and reaffirming Mao's 
principles. Some recent provincial broadcasts have 
been unusually specific and frank about actions taken 
to subordinate the military, For example, one states 
that it is time for the provincial Military District 
to shift its emphasis to its "main peacetime task... .

The Militari_Rmions; The Lin Piao affair has 
not visfgry ra. the centraf Party leaders -- meaning 
mainly Mao and Chou -- to repent of the system under 
which the Party committee of a province containing a 
Military Region headquarters is headed by a career 
military man who is either the commander (usually) or 
the first political officer of that MR. Mao and Chou 
may indeed have repented of it and may intend to 
NI( change it, but there are still no solid indications 
of this. Of the ten provinces involved (Hopei being 
excluded, as the MR headquarters is in Peking, not 
in the provincial capital of Shihchiachuang), the Party 
committees of nine were so headed -- by six MR com-
manders, three MR first political officers - at the

athers hail the advancement of an old Party cadre over 
a military man as the head of a county's Party commit-
tee, and another says that the military should deal with 
military affairs and even in this sphere should accept 
the leadership of the local Party committees, More-
over, as noted by the U,S, Consulate General at Hong 
Kong, the current (2973) annual circular on military-
civilian relations "writes off" the PLA's role in poli-
tical affairs, omits past references to the PLA's roles 
as the main support of the proletarian dictatorship 
and as the supporter of the "Left" and as a great con-
tributor to the Cultural Revolution, and introduces an 
instruction that the indoctrination campaign on this 
relationship is to be Conducted under the "centralised 
leadership" of Party coNmittees all of which, the 
Consulate General remarks, mfurther points up the in-
tention to reassert civilian authority."

time of Lin's fall, and the tenth by an old Party 
cadre acting as first political officer. (The other 
principal military leader was normally the second 
secretary.) Eight of the ten still appear to be 
headed by career military men, and the other two (with 
the recent appointment of Saifudin in Sinkiang) by 
old Party cadres doubling as first political officers. 
Nine of these dual leaders -- in Liaoning (Shenyang MR), 
Shantung (Tsinan MR), Kiangsu (Nanking MR), Kwangtung 
(Canton MR), Hupei (Wuhan MR), Szechuan (Chengtu MR), 
Yunnan (Kunming MR, Kansu (Lanchow MR), and Urumuchi 
(Sinkiang MR), the leader in the first five cases 
being the commander of the MR headquarters there and 
in the other four the first political officer -- have 
been explicitly confirmed in the past year as both the 
MR leader (i.e. one of the two principal leaders) and 
the provincial Party committee's first secretary. 
(However, some have not been confirmed as both during 
1973, and may conceivably have lost one post.) In 
one other case -- Fukien (Foochow MR) -- the MR com-
mander, while not identified in any particular post, 
has made appearances suggesting that he holds both 
the military and the political posts. (Again, he 
may conceivably have lost one post.) In other words, 
while Peking has apparently purged two of the MR 
commanders who were concurrently provincial first 
or acting first secretaries at the time of Lin's 
fall, and two MR first political officers who were 
provincial second secretaries, there has been no 
marked change in the pattern, apart from naming another 
old Party cadre (Sinkiang) to replace a career military 
man as first secretary (concurrently first political 
officer).

There are no longer self-evident reasons for 
retaining career military men who are MR leaders as 
concurrently first secretaries of the provinces con-
taining their headquarters. Old Party cadres are 
now available in sufficient quantity, although 
perhaps still not enough with sufficient prestige. 
There is no apparent threat to public order -- not, 
at least, on a scale large enough to justify what 
is in effect a military government in those pro-
vinces (with the possible exceptions of Szechuan 
and Fukien, among the MR provinces). One possible 
reason is that it is simply more efficient to con-
centrate military and political authority in these 
provinces if reliable men can be found -- that is, 
to streamline the system of command-and-control. 
Another possible reason is hierarchical: that is, 
in the nature of the case the MR leaders are the 
most important persons in their provinces and it 
could be thought impracticable to subordinate them 
to merely provincial figures (although in fact 
one alternate member of the Politburo is con-
currently a subordinate secretary in Honan). In view 
of Mao's own emphasis on the importance of re-establish-
ing civilian Party control, however, and the obvious 
fact that the problem of re-establishing this control 
outside Peking is primarily the problem of controlling 
the MR leaders, the main reason for not depriving at 
least some of these MR leaders of either their military

or their political posts may well be that Mao and Chou 
are simply not yet prepared to do this.* 
There has, nevertheless, been some additional 
movement toward diluting the power of career military 
men in the MR headquarters, by assigning old Party 
cadres as first or second political officers. (The 
first political officer is the principal check, at the 
regional level, on the MR commander, and the second 
political officer is the principal check on the first.) 
This process in fact began in 1967, with the assign-
ment of Chang Chun-chiao as first political officer 
of the Nanking MR, a post in which he has recently been 
confirmed. It continued when Chi Teng-kuei, an old 
Party cadre from Honan, was (reportedly) named first 
political officer of the Peking MR in or about 1970. 
The above-mentioned old Party cadre Chou Hsing has 
apparently been the first political officer of the 
Kunming MR since 1971. Old Party cadre Li Ta-chang was 
installed as second political officer in the Chengtu MR 
early in 1972, and he may become the first political 
officer if Liu Hsing-yuan gives up that role to become 
the new commander. Hua Kuo-feng, an old Party cadre 
*It must be emphasized that these MR leaders are 
powerful figures, not merely "administrators," as it 
is sometimes put. They are genuine regional authorities, 
key figures in a chain-of-command, men whose power is 
the sum of the power of all of the commanders subordinate 
to them, commanders of regular armies, regional forces, 
and production-and-construction corps. AZthough Peking 
can and does issue orders directly to armies disposed 
in the MRs, the MR commander is normally their commander, 
within the limits of the orders he himself has had from 
Peking, Moreover, these armies are immediately avail-
able to the MR commander, just as the Peking Garrison 
is the immediately available force in Peking.

from Hunan (still the first secretary there) has been 
assigned as political officer in the Canton MR -- evi-
dently the senior man -- replacing Liu Using-yuan. 
And Saifudin, an old Party cadre, has just been named 
as first political officer of the Sinkiang MR (as 
well as first secretary of the Sinkiang provincial 
Party committee). Moreover, an old Party cadre may 
have beeh assigned (without publicity), or may soon 
be assigned, as first pclitical officer in the Foochow 
MR, where the first is missing and believed purged. 
Even the apparently secure career political officers 
now serving as first political officers in the Shenyang, 
Tsinan, Wuhan, and Lanchow MR's (like Chengtu) could be 
replaced by qualified old Party cadres in those areas 
if Peking should choose to be thorough-going about 
this. Moreover, some of these old Party cadres may 
be acting as the first secretaries of the military 
Party committees of these MR headquarters, and would 
thus be the principal regional authorities. 
Of these ten provinces containing MR headquarters 
being considered (still excluding Hopei as a special 
case), eight are coterminous with Military Districts 
(Szechuan and Sinkiang are not MDs). In recent years 
these have normally had career political officers as the 
first political officers of their MDs, but it is not 
known whether this is still the case. The one certain 
identification of a first political officer in this group 
of MDs (in Hupei) is in fact an old Party cadre. Career 
political officers are probably still the first poli-
tical officers in two other of these MDs. The situation 
in the other five is simply unknown. The same thing 
may be happening here that is happening in the MR 
headquarters -- the displacement of career political 
officers by old Party cadres. 
The Other Provinces: In the 19 other provincial-
level Party committees, the picture is mixed, but seems 
to show an enhancement of the ;position of old Party

cadres. Whereas in the ten provinces with MR head-
quarters in the provincial capitals eight of the pro-
vincial Party committees appear to be headed by career 
military men who are still active MR leaders (although 
some may not be), in the other 19 provincial-level 
committees the military men are barely in a majority: 
of ten to nine. 
25X1 
In one of these 19 cases, Tsinghai, the picture 
is quite confused: the nominal first secretary, a 
career military man, is apparently not active in the 
post and is not even in the province. The senior 
secretary on the spot, however, is also a military man. 
The provincial-level Party committees of this 
group of 19 which are headed by old Party cadres are 
Peking, Hopei, Tientsin, Shanghai, Chekiang, Kwangsi, 
Hunan, Honan, and Shensi; the nine (of this group) 
which are headed by career military men who are on 
the spot (six commanders, two political officers, one 
mixed) are Shansi, Inner Mongolia, Kirin, Heilungkiang, 
Anhwei (where Li Te-sheng shuttles from Peking), Kiangsi, 
Kweichow, Tibet, and Ninghsia. Three of these are 
new first secretaries: two career military men, one 
old Party cadre. 
The picture is not really clear, however, as to 
whether the career military men who head provincial 
Party committees in this group of provinces are still 
active as military men. Of the nine, at least one 
(Hsieh Chen-hua in Shansi) had apparently been replaced 
in his military post by 1971, and only one of the 
others has been identified in a military post since 
August 1972 (and in that instance a post in Peking, 
not in his province). It may be that military identi-
fications have been withheld for reasons of public 
relations, as part of the overall effort to give the 
PLA a lower profile, but on the other hand it may be

that some or 6ven most of these men are in fact no 
longer active military leaders. 
In the 16 MDs and three major municipal garri-
sons associated with the above-cited 19 provincial-
level Party committees, old Party cadres hold the 
great majority of the identified posts of first poli-
tical officers. In the six provinces and three major 
municipalities in which the first secretary of the 
Party committee is an old Party cadre, the first poli-
tical officers of seven are known to be old Party 
cadres, in six of the seven eases the first secretary 
acting as first political officer concurrently; and in 
an eighth case this i.s probably true. In the ninth 
of the nine cases, the first political officer was 
a career political officer, but he is missing and 
reported purged, and may well have been replaced by 
anothur old Party cadre. 
In the other ten cases, in which nine provin-
cial committees are headed by career military men and 
the tenth has a career military man as the senior 
secretary on the spot, only three of the first poli-
tical officers have been identified. Two are career 
political officers, both concurrently the provincial 
committees' first secretaries; the third is an old 
Party cadre. The chances are that in at least some 
of the other seven provinces, the acting first 
political officers are old Party cadres. 
New Secretaries: About 45 additional provincial 
Party committee secretaries and deputy secretaries 
(not counting transfers) have been identified since the 
last of the original committees was proclaimed in 
August 1971. There are probably many more of these 
new secretaries, as yet unpublicized, as some of the 
provincial committees have as few as three identified 
secretaries, whereas others have as many as 12.

The backgrounds of more than half of the iden-
tified new secretaries are known. These are almost 
all old Party cadres, many of them brought down in 
the Cultural Revolution, rehabilitated, and reassigned, 
often in the provinces in which they served before. 
Only four of the new secretaries are known to be 
career military men. Of those whose backgrounds are 
unknown some will almost certainly prove to be old 
Party cadres who never previously rose high enough to 
be publicized, some will probably prove to be young 
Party cadres risen on the Cultural Revolution, and 
some will probably prove to be PLA men. However these 
unknowns break down, and whatever the backgrounds of the 
new secretaries still unidentified, it seems probable 
that the great majority of the new secretaries will 
prove to be Party cadres, not PLA men. 
One of these new secretaries was named acting 
first secretary, in Kiangsi; it was one of the PLA men, 
replacing an apparently purged PLA man. Six other 
provincial committees have been given new first secre-
taries in this period since August 1971, but in each 
case it has represented the transfer and/or promotion of 
someone who was already a secretary: Peking, where an 
old Party cadre moved up to replace a long-ailing security 
specialist who died; Chekiang, where an old Party cadre 
was transferred and promoted to replace an apparently 
purged military man; Kwangtung (an MR province), where 
a PLA man was promoted from that committee to replace 
a transferred PLA man; Szechuan (another MR province) 
where the PLA man transferred from Kwangtung replaced 
a PLA man who had died; Kweicriow, where a PLA figure 
was transferred and promoted to replace an appar2ntly 
purged PLA man; and just now, Sinkiang, where an old 
Party cadre was promoted to replace a purged PLA man. 
It is probably not coincidental that in six of 
the seven cases in which three or more new secretaries 
are known to have been added to provincial committees,

those committees are headed by military men. As the new 
secretaries are overwhelmingly civilians, the aim here 
as elsewhere seems to be to dilute the power of the 
military leader. This will be a trend to look for, in 
other committees headed by military men. It may also 
occur in certain provincial-level Party committees, 
whether headed by military men or old Party cadres, 
which look to be still too heavily-staffed by military 
men: e.g., Peking (4 to 2), Inner Mongolia (3 to 1), 
Kirin (3 to 0 at the moment), Kiangsu (4 to 2), Szechuan 
(3 to 1 at the moment), Kansu (3 to 2 at the moment), 
and Ninghsia (where only two secretaries are appearing). 
Some Overall Figures: As previously noted, at 
the time of Lin Piao's fall in September 1971 career 
military men were the first secretaries of 20 of the 
29 provincial-level Party committees and comprised about 
60 percent of the 150-odd provincial secretaries of all 
ranks (first secretaries, second secretaries where 
named, and plain secretaries). 
There are now 27 identifiable active first 
secretaries, and two acting firsts. Of these, 18 are 
career military men, eight of whom head the Party 
committees of provinces in which Military Region head-
quarters are located, and another of whom (Li Te-sheng 
of Anhwei) reportedly heads another MR (Peking) in 
which his province is not located. The other 11 are 
old Party cadres, two of whom (in Yunnan and Sinkiang) 
head the Party committees of provinces in which MR 
headquarters are located, six of whom are in less 
important provinces, and three of whom head the com-
mittees of major municipalities (two of these, Peking 
and Shanghai, being as important as an MR province). 
Again, 18 to 11 in favor of the military, as against

the previous 20 to 9: not really a dramatic change. 
However, as noted, some of these career military men 
may have lost their military posts (in one case, 
almost certainly), so that the figures may be mis-
leading. Although the evidence is very soft, it 
may be that old Party cadres occupy about as many of 
the first secretaryships as do active military men 
-- and just conceivably even moFF751?them. 
There now seem to be about 170 identifiable 
active secretaries of all ranks, a somewhat larger 
number than in August 1971. Of those whose backgrounds 
are known (the great majority), the balance is now 
even between career military men and old Party cadres, 
as ,-.gainst the earlier 60-40 split in favor of the 
military. Here the trend is clear, and emphasized 
by the character of the identifiable new secretaries. 
In the 11 MR headquarters, old Party cadres 
are known or reported to hold five of the posts as 
first political officers, while career political 
officers hold five; an old Party cadre may hold the 
unpublicized post in the Foochow MR. In the 27 MD-
level posts (including three major municipal garri-
sons), old Party cadres hold the great majority (9 or 
10 to 2) of the identified posts of first political 
officers; and it seems likely that old Party cadres 
will turn up in several of the unpublicized positions. 
Of the approximately 45 new secretaries (added 
since August 1971), the backgrounds of 24 are known. 
Of these, 20 are old Party cadres, and only four are 
career military men. It seems highly probable that 
this trend will continue.

DEA-JIVE j. 
IV, OTHER POSSIBLE ACTIONS 
In addition to the organizational steps already 
taken at the regional and provincial levels -- the 
purge of a substantial number of military leaders and 
the strengthening of the relative position of old Party 
cadres -- there are other actions which the civilian 
leaders in Peking are taking or can take to reassert 
civilian Party control of the still-evolving regional-
and-provincial-level structures. Some of these relate 
to the central leadership organs, both Party and mili-
tary, and some to the political and military structures 
outside Peking. 
The Chairman, the Politburo, the MAC: Even 
before the purge of Lin Piao's group, Mao, as part 
of his preparations for the purge, was reasz..erting 
his position as the "leader" of the PLA as well as of 
the Party, and this continues. Whether the formulation 
sneaks of leadership by Mao alone, or by Mao and the 
Central Committee, or by the Central Committtee and 
Mao, the point is the same: the Chairman of the Party 
has supreme authority over the PLA. If the post of 
Chairman of the regime is restored, and if it carries 
with it again the title of commander-in-chief of the 
armed forces (thus far a nominal authority), the new 
Chairman will almogt certainly be a civilian. 
The Politburo Standing Committee, the core of 
the Party's organizational power, still consists offi-
cially of only two active members, Mao and Chou. If 
and when it is formally reconstituted, it will probably 
include a military member, Yeh Chien-ying, but the 
civilians can be expected to dominate it. (Yeh is 
now the only career military man among the eight top-
ranking active members of the Politburo from whom any

new Standing Committee will presumably be drawn. It 
is conceivable, however, that the new Standing Committee 
will reach down to the ninth-ranking active member of 
NA/ the Politburo, Li Te-sheng, in order to take in a young-
er military leader.) 
Just as the present Politburo as a whole includes 
several career military men, including three MR com-
manders, so the reconstituted Politburo is expected 
to include several. There are several good candidates 
among the central leaders now being treated by the media 
as ranking just below the level of the known Politburo 
members, and several in the MR headquarters. The MR 
commanders on the new Politburo will probably be more 
than balanced, however, by old Party cadres who are 
concurrently MR -- or Garrison -- political officers 
(e.g., Chang Chun-chiao, Chi Teng-kuei, Wu Te, Hua 
Kuo-feng, Wang Hung-wen). The new Politburo is expected 
too to set the pattern for the provincial-level ap-
paratus by taking in additional relatively young men.* 
*The Chinese Party leadership has already done pretty 
well in tis respect. While the leadership is some-
times regarded as consisting of a few old men who will 
leave China leaderless when they die in the near future, 
only the top three men -- Mao, Chou, and Yeh -- are past 
70, The other active members of the Politburo, and 
of the group treated as just below that level and likely 
to join it, average about 55 and include three men 
under 45. This compares favorably with the profile 
of the provincial Party first secretaries, who average 
closer to 60. There are of course many young people 
among the provincial secretaries, but the proportion 
is not as high as it is at the top levels in Peking 
itself, and the media, in calling as it does for "good 
young comrades? to be brolight into "leading positions" 
at all levels, is in effect telling the provincial-

Mao's leadership of the PLA has been more than 
symbolic. He has been and remains the chairman of the 
Military Affairs Committee, and delegates this authority. 
Just prior to the purge of Lin Piao's group, Mao cri-
ticized the work of the MAC and stated his intention 
to add some people to it -- probably meaning, to its 
Standing Committee. The Standing Committee has been 
and probably remains composed largely of career mili-
tary men.) 
  There will surely be no repeti-
tion of a MAC Standing Committee composed almost 
entirely of career military men who are proteges of 
a single military leader. The chances are that more 
regional military leaders will also be placed on this 
Standing Committee, and will be more actively involved 
in its work.*

controlling the MAC would be to make it responsible 
to a civilian-dominated Secretariat as the principal  
executive organ of the Party,

The Security Apparatus: The infusion of old 
Party cadres may be happening as well to the MAC's 
General Political Department, charged principally 
with indoctrination of the PLA. (With more old Party 
cadres in the MAC Standing Committee, the GPD can prob-
ably be safely left in its present direct subordina-
tion to the MAC, rather than placed directly under 
Chou En-lai or any other de facto secretary-general.) 
The GPD is presently headia FT?a?career military man 
-- Li Te-sheng -- close to Mao, but only one of the 
active deputy directors is known (the other, a Lin 
Piao protege, is missing). This very active and im-
portant Department would seem to require several deputies 
and it would not be surprising if some of them turned 
out to be old Party cadres rather than career political 
officers. 
The very sensitive political security function 
-- investigation and evaluation of Party leaders, in-
cluding military figures, and provincial-level leaders --
will probably be placed more securely in civilian hands. 
PLA'figures are known to have had important roles in 
this work -- in both investigating and evaluating --
during tne Cultural Revolution (and in the Lin Piao 
affair), and some PLA leaders may well have been among

 I The problem may be artificial, 
in that the apparent candidates for vacancies on the 
Politburo standing committee and for the principal 
posts in the Secretariat Zook to be generally the 
same people, and mainly civilians, so that it may not 
matter greatly whether the MAC reports directly to 
Mao and Chou, to a Politburo standing committee headed 
by Mao and Chou, or to a Party Secretariat headed by 
Chou and staffed by Mao's and Chou's men.

the officers of the central political security office 
(whatever it was called). There may now be a formal, 
although unpublicized, Political Security Department 
or Special Investigation Department to which the 
lesser ad hoc units report, but nothing is solidly known 
about trie organization of any such department. The 
coordinator of political security work is generally 
believed to be Mao's man Wang Tung-hsing, an old Party 
cadre, who could handle this work from his post as 
Director of the Central Committee's Staff Office, if 
no separate department exists.* Wang's deputy in the 
Staff Office post, Yang Te-chung, who is believed to 
be one of his deputies in political security work, is 
a career political officer but in recent years has 
been appearing only as a civilian, There is some evid-
ence (most recently, in the Lin affair) that political 
security work is now supervised by Chou En-lai, although 
Wang and others in this field may also report directly 
to Mao on occasion,, 
Mao has never allowed political seculAty work 
in the PLA itself to be conducted solely by PLA 
organs, and it seems certain that the Lin Piao affair 
has strengthened this disposition. Whatever the arrange-
ments were as of 1971, the early-warning system was 
not working as well as it should have been, or the 
conspirators of Lin's group could not have come as close

reasonable to assign it to a broadly-based committee 
of Lin's peers, rather than to keep it within the

to assassinating Mao as they apparently did. (And 
there had earlier been some successful assassinations.) 
The political security specialists may now be working 
to make the political security apparatus pervasive, 
as it once seemed to be, in the military establishment, 
in the form of separate offices outside of the political  
officer system./ 
This system could 
be set up to be eirectly responsive to Peking, or, if 
Peking wishes to reinforce the career Party cadres 
against the military at the provincial level, could 
be placed under the control of first secretaries of 
provincial Party committees not headed by military 
men or of subordinate civilian secretaries of the 
military-led committees, who themselves would report 
to Peking. There are fragmentary indications that 
this latter arrangement has been made in some cases. 
The less sensitive public security function 
-- dealing in general with the populace at large 
rather than with political and military leaders --
has reportedly already been returned to civilian hands, 
largely if not completely, at all levels.* (Severely 
troubled provinces might be exceptions.) The new 
Minister of Public Security, Li Chen, is a career 
security specialist, engaged in such work since at 
least 1945.. The senior deputy, Yu Sang, is also an

old Party cadre long in security work, and the other 
apparent deputy is the above-mentioned Yang Te-chung, 
also a civilian now. 
Some Outside Possibilities: There has been 
some speculation that Peking might make a striking 
move toward tigher civilian control of the military 
by naming an old Party cadre as Minister of Defense 
for the first time. (Chang Chun-chiao has been 
mentioned.) This would indeed be a striking symbolic 
act, but the Ministry itself is probably still con-
trolled by the MAC, already headed by a civilian 
(Mao). A younger career military man seems more 
likely, when old Yeh Chien-ying dies or tires. 
Another idea that might look attractive but 
seems unlikely to be acted on in the near fiture is 
the reconstruction of the Party's great regional 
bureaus. These existed from 1949 to 1954, at which 
time the Kao Kang case apparently made these region-
al concentrations of power seem threatening to the 
central leadership, and again from 1960 to 1966, at 
which time they were again abolished, as a part of 
destroying the Party apparatus in the first stage of 
the Cultural Revolution. The principal benefit to be 
gained from such bureaus would lie in their role as a 
regional control over the Military Region headquarters, 
on the principle of subordination of PLA Party com-
mittees to "local" Party committees. The principal 
disadvantage would lie in their potential for combining 
with the MR headquarters in opposition to Peking, as 
charged in some cases in 1966. The latter considera-
tion has evidently impressed Mao and Chou more than 
the former. (A simpler means to the same end is to 
name old Party cadres, concurrently political officers, 
as first secretaries of the military Party committees 
of the MR headquarters.) Should they change their 
minds, the career Party cadres now being assigned as

first or second political officers in the MR headquart-
ers -- known or reported to be in place in several of 
them -- might be named as first secretaries of regional 
Party bureaus concurrently, as in the 1960-66 period, 
with MR leaders and provincial Party leaders named as 
subordinate secretaries. This would again place authority 
at the regional level primarily in the hands of old 
Party cadres, who would occupy two or three of the four 
most important posts -- first sec.retary and first poli-
tical officer, and perhaps first secretary of the 
military Party committee -- in each region or in most 
of them,* 
Another possible step would be to divide authority 
in the provincial Party committees between the military 
secretaries and the old Party cadre secretaries, in 
effect restricting the military men to military-related 
affairs and giving the old Party cadres the responsi-
bility for everything else. This has already been 
reported from two provinces (Kwangtung and Szechuan). 
The reporting is cloudy, however, and such an arrange-
tent would seem impossible to carry out in precisely 
*Peking is still a long way from solving the prob-
lems inherent in the relationship between a Military 
Region Party committee and a provincial Party commit-
tee. While in general terms military committees are 
to work under the "leadership" of local committees, 
when the Regions are explicitly discussed it is sometimes 
delicately said that they are to "respect the views" 
of the local committees. The old Party cadres assigned 
as senior political officers in these MRs are presum-
ably, as part of their work, to observe whether the 
career military men of the MR headquarters do in fact 
"respect the views" of the lower-ranking civilians.

those committees in which it might seem an answer to 
the problem of assuring civilian control -- those in 
which an active military leader is the first secretary 
(as in Kwangtung and Szechuan). It would seem simpler 
to replace the military man as first secretary with 
an old Party cadre; it would not be enough at the provin-
cial level to name an old Party cadre the First Secretary 
of the military district Party committee, as the pro-
vincial committee ranks it. 
Yet another possible step would be to break 
up the "family"-type provincial committees, those in 
which the principal secretaries have worked together 
(with occasional interruptions) for many years and 
whose bonds with one another might be thought to be 
stronger than their loyalty to Peking. This might be 
done despite the fact that some of the current Party 
committees that give this appearance (e.g., Shantung, 
Kiangsu), are headed by military men in whom Mao seems 
to have particular confidence Almost all of these 
"family" committees are dominated by military figures, 
and their dissolution or dilution -- the reassignment 
of either the first secretary or his deputies -- would 
of course reduce one kind of threat to Peking. This 
consideration, however, seems unlikely to be the main 
factor in the reorganization of any provincial com-
mittee. The threat is not large enough at the provin-
cial level. Reorganizations which have the effect 
of breaking up "family" committees are likely to be 
aimed primarily at reduciEL the power of regional 
military leaders, the level at which the real frifeat 
is posed.

V. PROSPECTS 
25X1 
The methodical purge of the regional and pro-
vincial leaders -- which is predominantly of PLA 
figures among them -- can be expected to continue, 
but, probably, in waves of diminishing force. Indeed, 
there may be no more "waves" -- simply the purge of 
individuals, one by one, over the course of the next 
year or two. Some of those now missing can be expected 
to return (as have some of those missing in the past), 
as investigations are completed and they are cleared, 
but a substantial number -- probably more than half 
of the now-missing provincial secretaries -- will prove 
to have been removed from their posts, along with 
many other military leaders who are not provincial 
secretaries. Moreover, some of the military leaders 
now in place -- including some of the MR leaders concur-
rently first secretaries of provincial Party commit-
tees -- may be purged as opportunity permits, although 
Mao and Chou will probably move cautiously against 
MR leaders in disfavor. Others, less clear-cut cases, 
\( will probably be reassigned. 
Most of the purged military leaders, among the 
provincial Party secretaries, will probably be replaced 
as secretaries by old Party cadres. Most of the first 
secretaryships will probably come to be held by old 
Party cadres, and veteran cadres will probably come 
to constitute a substantial majority of all provincial 
secretaries. Old Party cadres will probably continue 
to move increasiagly into the MR headquarters as senior 
political officers, and, eventually, may constitute 
the majority of first political officers of both the 
MR's and the provincial MDs.

The reassertion of civilian Party control of 
the Party's central leading organs, the Politburo and 
the MAC, will surely proceed. Old Party cadres will 
probably be assigned larger icles in those portions of 
the security apparatus not already controlled by 
civilians, and the entire apparatus will be strengthened. 
All of this will take time. The removal of 
Military Region leaders would be a particularly 
delicate operation, probably requiring substantial 
intervals between removals, in order both to avoid 
provoking the formation of regional alliances and 
to find reliable replacements, men who will not 
constitute new threats to the center. 
The message which Mao has been sending to the 
regional and provincial levels is that he is steadily 
re-establishing civilian control of the central Party 
apparatus, that he means to establish it as well at 
the regional and provincial levels, and that this is 
inevitable and had better not be resisted. In harsher 
terms, the message to any given leader outside Peking 
is that he is isolated and vulnerable, that in recent 
years hundreds of regional and provincial leaders have 
been summoned to Peking and purged, without a single 
known case of effective resistance. 
Whether civilian Party control of the governing 
apparatus throughout China can be fully restored in 
Mao's lifetime, or, even in Chou's, is impossible to 
judge. No Western observer can know how many names, 
how many things to do, are on the list, and not even 
Mao and Chou can know how many years remain to them. 
Moreover, Mao and Chou may not be using the same list. 
Although Mao has-been working carefully, Mao's list 
may be such -- may be perceived to be such -- that 
another little band of conspirators will shape up (in 
order to save themselves from purging), a band that

might be more intelligently led than was Lin Piao's. 
On balance, the history of the past ten years would 
seem to discourage another such challenge to Mao. A 
better possibility is that some military leaders 
-- national, regional, and provincial -- will conclude 
that they should take care to avoid offending Mao and 
to retain their positions and as much as possible of 
their powers, in preparation for an eventual showdcwn 
with the career Party cadres in the central leadership 
and in the regions and provinces. In any case, this 
question of the balance of power between the civilian 
and the military leaders at all levels is one which 
must be period.',cally recalculated.

 by Li Te-sheng, an alternate member 
of the Politburo and Director of the General Political 
Department of the Military Affairs Committee; Li ap-
peared "on behalf" of the Peking MR in November '72. 
Like other MR commanders, Li has a concurrent provin-
cial political post, but his is not in his own MR. 
The 1st Political Officer of the Peking MR is 
Chi Teng-kuei, also an alter-
nate member of the Politburo, also with a provincial 
post outside of this MR. The only known key figure 
of this MR Hqs. who is not concurrently a provincial 
Party Secretary is Chen?gFien-jui, a leader of this 
MR for many years and now probably the second-ranking 
PolOff. 
Peking Municip.al Committee CCP  
(1) Wu Te, 1st Secretary, probably 1st PolOff 
of the Peking Garrison concurrently. (An old Party 
cadre, about 60 now, with some Party police background. 
By '56, 1st Sec'y of Kirin Ctte CCP, transferred 
to Peking in '66. E..evated from alternate to full

Became 2nd Secretary -- under a new 1st Secretary, 
Hsieh Fu-chih -- when new Peking Ctte CCP was pro-
claimed in March '71, and officially succeeded Hsieh, 
for whom he had been acting, on latter's death in 
early '72. Appeared f.n uniform as of '71, but 
has not been identified in a military post. Is grouped 
with Politburo members in turnouts, and seems marked 
for Politburo. No obvious patron, but occupancy 
of two very sensitive posts in the capital -- 1st 
Sec'y of municipal committee and 1st PolOff of Gar-
rison -- must mean that Mao Tse-tung regards Wu as 
his own man.) 
(2) Yang Chun-sheng, Secretary, perhaps con-
currently either 1st Pc1Off of the Artillery Force 
or a senior officer of the Peking Garrison. (A 
career political)officer, probably about 60. Early 
service with Lin Piao, most of career with others. 
Was 1st PolOff of Artillery by '69, when named an 
alternate member of new Central Ctte. Was appearing 
in unspecified PLA role as recently as June '72.) 
(3) Wu Chung, Secretary, concurrently Com-
mander of the Peking Garrison. (A career military 
commander, probably his 50's, who rose under 
leaders other than Lin Piao's group. By '68 with 
Peking Garrison, possibly concerned with Mao's body-
guard, and in '69 was named an alternate member of 
Central Ctte. Sometime after the purge of the 
Peking Garrison commander -- a Lin Piao protege --
in summer '70, Wu became the new commander, and 
appeared publicly in this role in early '72. Party 
briefings portray him as playing a key role in Mao's 
actions against Lin's group. No apparent career 
patron, but his occupancy of this very sensitive 
post -- in Party leadership crises perhaps the most 
important military post -- and his role in the Lin 
Piao affair indicate that Mao regards Wu Chung, like 
Wu Te, as his man.)

III. TSINAN MILITARY REGION 
This MR is virtually coterminous with Shantung 
province on the Yellow Sea, The MR is commanded by 
Yang Te-chih, concurrently 1st Secretary of the Shantung 
Ctte CCP. The senior Po/Off of the MR, Yuang Sheng-
ping,, is 2nd Secretary of that Ctte. Materials 
prepared in this MR in the campaign against "arrogance 
and complacency" were used by Mao as part of his 
case against Lin Piao's group, which may help to 
explain why none of the secretaries of the Shantung 
Ctte CCP is missing. 
Shantung Provincial Committee CCP 
(1) Yang Te-chih, 1st Secretary, concurrently 
Commander of the Tsinan MR. (A career military com-
mander, about 60. Early with Lin Piao's forces, 
later with other leaders; Cdr of Tsinan MR by '58, 
preceding Lin's appointment as Minister of Defense. 
The winner in a dispute for dominance in Shantung, 
Yang was named a full member of Central Ctte CCP 
in April '71. Has been identified as both 1st 
Secretary and MR Commander as recently as April '73.) 
(2) Yuan Sheng-ping, 2nd Secretary, concur-
rently 1st or acting 1st PolOff of Tsinan MR. (A 
career political officer, probably in his 60's. 
Spent many years with Lin Piao's forces and was re-
garded as a onetime Lin protege. In Shantung since 
'61, thus has been with Yang Te-chih more than ten 
years. Named full member of Central Ctte in '69. 
By early '70, had displaced as senior PolOff the 
man who lost out in the dispute with Yang Te-chih, 
and in this post Yuan must have had a leading role 
in preparing the material useful to Mao in purging 
Lin's group. Has been identified as both 2nd Sec'y 
and ranking PolOff as recently as April '73.)

This MR comprises the Southeast China provinces 
of Fukien (containing the MR headquarters at Foochow) 
and Kiangsi. The MR is commanded by Han Hsien-chu, 
one of several military leaders clearly favored by 
Lin Piao who is still an MR Commander. (The MR's 
former senior PolOff has apparently been purged.) 
Han is concurrently a Deputy C/S and 1st Secretary of 
th9 Fukien ctte CCP. Many of Han's associates are 
missing, but at least through 1972 Han seefied to 
continue to prosper. The current 1st PolOff of this 
MR is unknown, but might be either Wang Chien-an, who 
is not known to be a provincial Party secretary, 
or She Chi-te, the ranking secretary of the Kiangsi 
Ctte CCP. The one-time commander of the Wuhan MR, 
Chen Tsai-tao, and the onetime 1st PolOff of CPV 
Korea, Li Chih-min, were moved into this MR in '72. 
Fukien Provincial Committee CCP  
(1) Han Hsien-chu, 1st Secretary, concurrently 
Commander of the Foochow MR and Deputy C/S of the PLA. 
(A career military commander, in early 60's; earlier 
service with leaders other than Lin Piao's group but 
after World War II with Lin's forces. Commander of 
the Fukien MD by c. '55, was named by Lin as Commander 
of the Foochow MR by '60 and as a Deputy C/S by '65. 
The principal leader in Southeast China throughout the 
CR, he was elevated from alternate to full member of 
the Central Ctte in '69 and was named 1st Secretary of 
the new Fukien Ctte CCP in January '71 In his public 
speeches thereafter, Han seemed to a strong sense 
of personal loyalty to Lin Piao ' as to Mao, and

was regarded as a Lin protege,/ 
 /Since then, he has repeatedly appeared 
as the ranking figure in Fukien, although in the late 
months of '72 and in '73 not expressly identified in 
either his Party or military posts. Because he had 
seemed to close to Lin Piao, it is possible, despite 
his apparent ability to clear himself, that he will 
yet fall. 
(2) Chu Shao-ching, Secretary, perhaps Com-
mander of 31st Army concurrently. (A career military 
commander, probably in his 60's, rising under leaders 
other than Lin Piao's group, has been with Han Hsien-
chu in Fukien for many years. Said to be a DepCdr of 
the Foochow MR and Cdr of the 31st Army there as of 
'68. Appears to be a protege of Han. Has apparently 
replaced as second-ranking secretary Chou Chili-ping, 
MISSING since April '71. Chou, a career pJlitical 
officer, 2nd Secretary of the Fukien Ctte CCP, 1st 
PolOff of the Foochow MR and a full member of 'the 
Central Ctte, was very close to Lin Piao; he was named 
in Party briefings as one of Lin's conspiratorial group, 
and is presumed purged.) 
(3) Huang Ya-kuang, Secretary, no known con-
current post. (Apparently an old Party cadre, prob-
ably in his 60's, was an officer of the People's 
Bank of China through the '50s, returned to his native 
Fukien in '60s, was named a secretary of the new 
Fukien Ctte CCP in '71. Perhaps an economic specialist. 
May have replaced as third-ranking secretary Cho 
Hsiung, MISSING since August '72. Cho, an old Party 
cadre with experience as a political officer and in 
Party police work, may have had connections with Lin 
Piao's forces in the Northeast in the '40s but has 
not visibly had them since, and his absence is inexplic-
able.)

no known concurrent post; MISSING since August '72.

Fukien Ctte CCP since c. '50, head of OrgDept by '54,

in Kiangsi of any current Kiangsi leader, he was named 
the junior deputy secretary of the new Kiangsi Ctte 
CCP in '71, but during '72 was elevated to full secre-
tary and has apparently replaced Yang Tung-liang as the 
second-ranking secretary. Yang, MISSING since February

with Lin Piao; like Cheng, he disappeared after Lin's

VI. CANTON MILITARY REGION 
This MR comprises the South China provinces of 
Kwangtung (containing the MR headquarters in Canton, 
and including Hainan Island in the jurisdiction of the 
provincial Party committee), Kwangsi (nominally an 
'autonomous region'), and Hunan (Mao's native province). 
The MR is commanded by Ting Sheng, who, following the 
transfer of the original 1st Secretary of the Kwangtung 
Ctte CCP, became the new 1st Secretary concurrently. 
Ting in his early career had substantial service with 
Mao, Lin Pia o and Huang Yung-sheng. The 1st PolOff 
appears to be Hua Kuo-feng, recently transferred from 
Peking. The three provinces of this MR are more 
saturated with apparent proteges of Lin and Huang than 
are the provinces of any other MR in China. This MR 
has been specified in some Party briefings as one in 
which Lin Piao's group was especially confident of find-
ing high-level support, and in other briefings as one 
in which Lin's group was actually able to find only 
low-level support. Key figures of this MR Hq. who are 
not concurrently provincial Party secretaries are Huang 
Jung-hal,a Lin-Huang protege who is apparently the 
senior DepCdr of this MR and also 1st Sec'y of the 
Canton (municipal) Ctte CCP, and Jen Szu-chung, another 
Lin-Huang protege, who looks to be the third-ranking 
PolOff of this MR but has no known Party post. 
Kwangtung Provincial Committee CCP  
(1) Ting Sheng, 1st Secretary, concurrently 
Commander of the Canton MR. (A career military com-
mander, about 60. Was reportedly an early bodyguard

leaders from '52, was a DepCdr of the Sinkiang MR by 
'66. Criticized in the CR, he was apparently defended 
by Mao and Lin, and was transferred to the Canton MR 
in '68, at about the time of Huang's transfer to Peking 
to be C/S. He was de facto Cdr of the MR from '68, 
and was named a full EZEUFr of the Central Ctte in '69. 
He was named a Secretary of the new Kwangtung Ctte CCP 
in December '70, under 1s3 Secretary Liu Hsing-yuan, 
the 1st PolOff of the MR., Soon after Liu's transfer 
to Szechuan in or about March '72, Ting became the 
1st Sec'y of the Kwungtung Ctte CCP, and has since been 
identified in both the Party post and the military post. 
(2) Kung Shih-chuan, Secretary, concurrently 
the apparent 2nd PolOff of the Canton MR and possibly 
Commander of the Canton Garrison. (A career political 
officer, about 5S, long associated with Lin Piao and 
Huang Yung-sheng, and regarded as their protege. 
Transferred from the Canton MR to Peking in '54 for a 
long tour with the PLA's Political Academy, he was 
transferred back to Canton in '67 as a high-ranking 
political officer, and was named a full member of the 
Central Ctte in '69. As of winter '70-'71, he was 
known to be a secretary of the new Kwangtung Ctte CCP 
and reported to be concurrently Commander of the Canton 
Garrison. Has not been identified in military posts 
in recent months.) 
(3) Chen Yu, Secretary, no known concurrent 
post. (An old Party cadre, about 80. A secretary of 
the Central-South Bureau of the CCP when the CR began. 
Criticized in CR, but defended by Chou En-lai, renamed 
a full member of Central Ctte in '69, and renamed a 
secretary of the Kwangtung Ctte CCP in '71. Possibly 
too old to play much more than a ceremonial role, but 
has been said to be active and important.)

VIII. KUNMING MILITARY REGION 
This MR comprises the Southwest China provinces 
of Yunnan (with the MR headquarters at Kunming) and 
Kweichow. The Commander, Wang Pi-cheng, and 1st PolOff 
Chou Hsing, respectively 2nd and 1st Secretary of the 
Yunnan Ctte CCP, returned to view in late '72 after 
a long absence. Both provinces have apparently been 
put in relative order, after prolonged periods of 
trouble. 
Yunnan Provincial Committee CCP  
(1) Chou Hsing, 1st Secretary, confirmed as 
1st PolOff of the Kunming MR concurrently. (An old 
Party cadre, about 65, a security specialist for most

apparatus, similar posts in Peking in the '50s, trans-
ferred to Yunnan in early '60s, by '65 was a secretary 
of the Yunna% Ctte CCP and 1st PolOff of the Yunnan 
MD. With purge of 1st Sec'y in '67, Chou became the 
ranking secretary in Yunnan, and in '69 was named full 
member of Central Ctte. With death of Tan Fu-jen 
in December '70, Chou apparently became the 1st PolOff 
of the MR, and in June '71 was named 1st Secretary 
of the new Yunnan Ctte. Recently confirmed as both 
1st Sec'y and 1st PolOff.) 
(2) Wang Pi-cheng, 2nd Secretary, concurrently 
Commander of the Kunming MR. (A career military com-
mander, about 60, rising under leaders other than 
Lin Piao's group. By '61, a DepCdr of Nanking MR 
under Hsu Shih-yu. Praised by Kang Sheng during CR 
for a good self-criticism. By '70, transferred to 
Kunming MR as senior DepCdr, and in '71 named to 
new Kunming Ctte CCP. Identified as Cdr of this MR 
and 2nd Sec'y as recently as April '73.)

work in the '40s, but since '50 in various military 
command positions in Yunnan. A DepCdr of the MR and 
Cdr of the Kunming Ga:rison in the '60s, engaged in 
factional struggle with Chou Hstng dut.ing the CR. 
In favor by '69, named a full member of the Central Ctte, 
and in '71 named tc new Yunnan Ctte CCP under his old 
rival Chou. Was the only secretary making appearances 
for some months in '72, but his last appearance was 
in Peking, and there is some reason to believe that 
he may have died, unpublicized.)

years '59-'62, then disappeared, unless he reappeared 
as a military man of the same name. The military 
man, however, is believed to be a different person, 
connected with Artillery Forces; to confuse matters 
completely, the military Kuo Chao was reportedly 
purged with Lin Piao's group, but the same name turned 
up in a group of PLA leaders after the time of the 
reported purge. In any case, the Kuo Chao in Kweichow

forces moved south, and in early '60s was with the Poli-
tical Department of the Shenyang MR. In '64, was re-

Peking in '68 and identified there as a PLA leader in 
'69, he was named a full member of the Central Ctte in 
'69. Named 1st Secretary of the new Tsinghai Ctte CCP 
in March '71, he has been, more than Li Te-sheng of 
Anhwei, the 1st Sec'y in absentia, as he has apparently 
spent all of his time in Peking., In view of early 
career and preferment given him during CR, had been 
regarded as a protege of Lin Piao, but he obviously 
has other patrons, as he is customarily ranked just 
below members of the Politburo and may be marked for 
it himself. Has not been identified either as the 
1st Sectv in Tsinghai or as a military leader since 
'71.)

and thetop man on the spot since '68. Named an alter-
nate member of the Central Ctte in '69, and soon iden-
tified as Commander of the Tsinghai MD. Named second-
ranking secretary of the new Tsinghai Ctte CCP in '71, 
has since appeared only in that role.) 
(3) Sung Chang-keng, Secretary, concurrently 
the de facto 1st PolOff of Tsinghai MD. (Unknown 
before '68, and may be relatively young. Probably a 
career PolOff, as appeared in that role in Tsinghai in 
'68, and has been de facto 1st PolOff since late '68. 
During '72, appear ga only inhis role as a Party 
Secretary, until January '73 the ranking secretary
