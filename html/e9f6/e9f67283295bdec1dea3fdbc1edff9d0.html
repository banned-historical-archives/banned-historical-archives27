 PORTUGAL
 January 30, 1975
 The Portuguese Communist Party and some minor
 leftist groups have called off the political demonstra-
 tion they had scheduled for Friday.  Their action came
 in response to a request from the Armed Forces Movement
 that the three political demonstrations planned for that
 day not take place.
 If the other major political party planning a dem-
 onstration--the Socialists  abides by the cancellation,
 the chance of violence over the weekend will be substan-
 tially reduced.  The Communists, whose demonstration
 was scheduled to draw off support from the Socialist
 rally, which they expected to be a big success, will be
 gratified by the cancellation.
 Minister Without Portfolio Vito Alves, speaking on
 television on behalf of the Armed Forces Movement yester-
 day, said that the demonstrations would interfere with
 the process of bringing democracy to Portugal and
 "should not take place."  His announcement indicates
 that the Armed Forces Movement can still act as a body,
 even though seriously divided between moderates and rad-
 icals.
 The government's concern over the rival demonstra-
 tions increased yesterday when the Maoist Reorganizing
 Movement of the Proletariat Party announced.it planned
 to meet at the same location as the Socialists.   The So-
 cialists, determined to make their show of strength in
 spite of competition, changed locations to avoid con-
 flict.  The announced times and places of the three dem-
 onstrations, however, were so close that planned or
 spontaneous clashes were still possible,
 Before the announcement by the Armed Forces Move-
 ment, the Socialist leader, Foreign Minister Soares,
 told Ambassador Carlucci that his party would go ahead
 with its demonstration, even if the government canceled
 it.     The Socialists, nevertheless, may now back down.

 The Maoist group may not be as willing to back
 down.    Press reports indicate that the Maoists are pre-
 pared to hold their demonstration in defiance of a gov-
 ernment ban.
 If the Maoists do not have the Socialists too dem-
 onstrate against, they may substitute a new cause--the
 ten-day NATO antisubmarine exercise that began yesterday
 in international waters near Lisbon.   The Maoists have
 been joined in condemning the exercise by the Popular
 Socialist Front, a radical Catholic group that recently
 split from the Socialist Party.

 O   A027400010012-4
 January 30, 1975
 Egyptian President Sadat left France yesterday with
 the promise of sizable French arms sales and Paris' agree-
 ment to consider participating in a wide range of eco-
 nomic projects in Egypt.
 Sadat told a press conference that Paris agreed to
 provide Mirage F-1 aircraft.  He did not divulge the
 number, saying only that the package consists of far
 fewer than the 120 planes mentioned earlier in the press.
 French sources have told the press that 50 planes are
 involved.
 Sadat did not mention any other types of arms in
 the new agreement--which is doubtless also being financed
 by Arab oil producers.   He is known to have been seeking
 surface-to-air missiles, tanks, helicopters, and radar
 equipment.
 While in Paris, Sadat made a much publicized tour
 of the plant that produces Crotale surface-to-air mis-
 siles and electronic equipment.  Egypt's war production
 minister, General Badri, has stayed behind for further
 discussions with plant officials.
 Sadat is surely pleased with the military agree-
 ment, particularly with the heavy publicity it received.
 The pointed reference in the communique that France
 agreed to sell arms to Egypt to help compensate for war
 losses was probably inserted at Sadat's request as a
 slap at the Soviets.   Sadat has recently made much of
 Moscow's failure to provide Egypt with replacement equip-
 ment, and he has shown he can go elsewhere to obtain at
 least some of Egypt's military needs.

 Sadat probably hopes that the promise of a militarily
 stronger Egypt will buttress his negotiating position with
 Israel, though he did try at his press conference to avoid
 giving the impression that the French arms will impede
 the progress of talks.  At the press conference, he re-
 peatedly emphasized that delivery of the Mirages will
 take several years, and reminded his audience that Lib-
 yan Mirages stationed in Egypt during the war had not
 been used in combat.  Sadat also reiterated that Egypt
 and Syria have no intention of starting a new war.
 Although Sadat and President Giscard held extensive
 discussions on economic cooperation, few firm agreements
 appear to have been made.   Sadat had said he intended
 to request a nuclear power station, but the communique
 referred to this only as one of many projects in which
 French participation was "reviewed."   A high French
 official announced, while Sadat was in town, that France
 would not sell nuclear reactors unless guarantees "satis-
 fying the international community" were provided.  Agree-
 ment was reached on the construction of a conventional
 electric power plant and on a system for color television.
 On Middle East peace issues, the communique called
 for "secure, recognized, and guaranteed borders" for all
 states in the area.   This wording, inserted at Giscard's
 insistence, is a refinement on UN Resolution 242, which
 calls for secure and recognized borders.  Giscard's use
 of the key phrase "guaranteed borders"--which he repeated
 several times before and during Sadat's visit--reaffirms
 France's desire to take part in settlement efforts.
 In his press conference, Sadat said that he would
 welcome the stationing of French troops to guarantee
 the border in a final peace settlement, so long as they
 were positioned on both sides.   Sadat said that "in a
 coming stage" France and all of Western Europe should
 play a role.

 The Greek government apparently is not yet ready
 to discuss in detail the consequences of its decision
 to withdraw from NATO's integrated military command.
 Greece formally withdrew from the military command struc-
 ture of NATO during the fighting in Cyprus last summer,
 but it has done little since then to 'Implement that de-
 cision.
 Athens informed NATO on December 4 that it was pre-
 pared then to discuss questions raised by its decision
 to withdraw.   In a conversation on January, 28 with the
 US ambassador in Athens, however, a high Foreign Minis-
 try official noted the Greek government's desire not to
 cause unnecessary problems for NATO activities in Greece.
 In particular, Athens wants to ensure the continued op-
 eration of the NATO missile-training facility on the
 island of Crete.  Athens, therefore, prefers that the
 status of the installation not be discussed at a NATO
 meeting in Brussels in early February.  The official
 explained that the Greek government is still in the
 process of,determining what kind of relationship to
 maintain with NATO and would therefore prefer not to
 take a position on the fate of specific NATO facilities
 in Greece at this time.
 The Greek military establishment seems to favor
 the maintenance of as many ties to NATO as politically
 possible.  While Prime Minister Karamanlis probably sym-
 pathizes with this position, he is also mindful of the
 popularity of the decision to withdraw from NATO's inte-
 grated military command.

 Yugoslav sensitivity concerning its independence
 and nonalignment surfaced in a recent commentary that
 criticized the Austrian press.
 On January 26, a Belgrade broadcast charged that an
 Austrian newspaper was guilty of fabrication and sensa-
 tionalism in its report that the Soviets have a major
 military involvement in Yugoslavia.  The newspaper re-
 ported that an airfield is being built for Soviet trans-
 port aircraft, that Soviet aid has been used in construct-
 ing underground shipyards and docks, and that a Soviet
 airborne unit is deployed near Belgrade.
 To refute these charges, the Yugoslav commentary
 underlined Belgrade's nonalignment.   It also reiterated
 the basic principle of an all-people's defense concept,
 saying that it "can be turned against anyone," including
 countries "either big or small, strong or weak, geographi
 ically near or distant."
 While the broadcast reflects the present chill in
 Yugoslav-Austrian relations, it was in Russian and there-
 fore apparently directed against the Soviet Union.   The
 specific motive is unclear.   It is possible that the
 broadcast was used to counter either existing or poten-
 tial Soviet pressure for increased access to Yugoslav
 port facilities and an   long-term Soviet designs on a
 post-Tito Yugoslavia.

 The appointment of a new chief of staff and a new
 head of the army's political department strengthens party
 control over the armed forces.  The appointees are both
 civilians, an unusual but not unprecedented move.  The
 chief of staff has always been a professional soldier.
 The new chief of staff, Teng Hsiao-ping, is the
 ranking vice premier and has been filling in for Premier
 Chou En-lai since he entered the hospital last year.
 Teng had a distinguished military career during the civil
 war, but has been a party and government administrator
 since then.  Teng has a well-earned reputation as a dis-
 ciplinarian.
 //Chang Chun-chiao, the new head of the General Polit-
 ical Department, rose to the top party post in Shanghai
 as a result of the.Cultural Revolution.
 Chang has been
 the first political commissar of the Nanking Military
 Region since 1967, but he does not have an extensive mil-
 itary background.
 Both Teng and Chang are members of the,Politburo
 standing committee, and Teng was elevated to the rank of
 party vice chairman at a party plenum earlier this month.
 Their unusually high rank lends emphasis to the party's
 desire to assert control over the military establishment.
 Furthermore, Teng had been reappointed to the Politburo
 and named a vice chairman of the party's military commis-
 sion in late December 1973 in conjunction with an earlier
 move to undercut military political power--the rotation
 of the military region commanders.

 Teng will probably enlarge his role in military pol-
 icy-making, but it is not yet clear whether he will take
 a firm handle on day-to-day military affairs.  His broad
 government duties would seem to demand much of his time,
 unless Premier Chou's health permits him to resume a more
 active role in government affairs.   It is also possible
 that Teng will rely heavily on his eight deputy chiefs of
 staff, several of whom possess the necessary experience
 to fill the job themselves.
 Chang Chun-chiao is now one of the handful of lead-
 ers who hold top party, government, and army posts.
 He seems to have been acting as party secretary general,
 but his new military duties do not conflict with his per-
 formance of this important party function.  The concen-
 tration of power tends to increase central control, but
 it could create problems over the longer term if the in-
 cumbents depart the political stage, thus creating a num-
 ber of vacancies which may be difficult to fill.

 The third and largest Mekong River convoy to at-
 tempt the trip from South Vietnam to Phnom Penh during
 the past week arrived in the capital early this morning.
 When the convoy left South Vietnam, it consisted of
 11 cargo ships, barges, and tankers carrying rice, ammu-
 nition, and petroleum products.  One of the four tankers
 was sunk and another set afire and beached after re-
 ceiving heavy communist shore fire in the vicinity of
 the southern narrows about 12 miles north of the South
 Vietnamese border.  A third ship carrying rice ran
 aground just south of Neak Luong.   The fate of the crew
 on the sunken tanker is not yet known, but most of the
 other crew members aboard the other two ships were re-
 portedly rescued.
 Operations are now under way to recover the beached
 ships.   Two additional ships developed mechanical prob-
 lems and are being repaired at Neak Luong.
 Other combat activity is still concentrated north
 and west of the capital.  Government forces are trying
 to dislodge Communist gunners from rocket-launching po-
 sitions northwest of Pochentong airfield, but unfavor-
 able terrain and stiff resistance is preventing any sig-
 nificant progress.   Communist forces are maintaining
 pressure against the 7th Division northwest of the capi-
 tal and have isolated the division headquarters.
 Elsewhere, the communists have launched attacks
 against government defenders at the provincial capital
 of Kampot, in the far southwest.  Although the.' insurgents
 forced government troops to abandon some positions over
 the weekend, the garrison has been reinforced and the
 situation has since been stabilized.

 Renewed fighting between government forces and in-
 surgents in Eritrea Province appears to be almost unavoid-
 able.  The ruling military council is also facing increas-
 ing opposition to its radical policies from a variety of
 Ethiopian groups.
 Insurgent leaders reportedly have broken off talks
 with local Eritrean notables, who have been acting as
 go-betweens, on the possibility of holding direct contacts
 with the council.   The insurgents appear to believe they
 can achieve their goal of independence by military action.
 Yesterday, the council announced in Addis Ababa that
 it had reached the end of the line in its policy of "re-
 straint" and that it is ready to use force against the
 rebels. During the past two weeks, the council has made
 extensive preparations for renewed hostilities.   It has
 established a joint army-police command in Asmara, the
 provincial capital, to coordinate all military activities.
 The council will probably refrain from initiating
 hostilities until the return of a delegation currently
 touring Arab capitals to explain the government's policy
 toward the predominantly Muslim insurgents.  The delega-
 tion is expected to return within a week.
 Opposition groups in other parts of Ethiopia are be-
 coming increasingly active.   The critics of the ruling
 military government represent a broad-based collection
 of Ethiopians with different ethnic, economic, and re-"'
 gional interests, but each views the council as a threat
 to their position and traditions.
 Leaders of these groups believe the council's pol-
 icies, including its adoption of socialism, nationaliza-
 tion of businesses, and intention to adopt land reform,
 are too radical for Ethiopia.   Some believe the council's

 actions presage a turn to communism.                They are concerned
 that these policies could lead to civil war and the dis-
 integration of Ethiopia.   Most of them still appear to
 be in the stage of getting organized and broadening their
 support;
 Most of these groups pose no direct threat to the
 council and lack the ability to stage a coup at this time.
 Some of them are capable, however, of harassing the coun-
 cil by organizing insurgencies in the provinces.   Dissiident
 activity, already under way in the northern provinces, has
 now been reported in Shoa Province, where Addis Ababa is
 located.  Armed bands have formed in northern Shoa, in
 reaction to the council's announced intention to implement
 land reform.   Last weekend, 12 soldiers reportedly were
 killed in a clash with civilians within 75 miles of the
 capital.
 Any attempt to oust the council in the near future
 would have to come from within the military.  Military
 opposition is widespread, but it is mostly unfocused and
 without direction.  Dissident officers could decide to
 act, however, if provincial unrest continues to increase,
 or if the council makes a serious misstep.

 The cabinet's basically conservative view of Middle
 East peace issues was underscored by the resignation yes-
 terday of Informaton Minister Yariv and by Defense Minis-
 ter Peres' recent hard-line public statements on an in-
 terim settlement with Egypt.
 Yariv's resignation is an outgrowth of long-simmer-
 ing frustration over the secondary status accorded his
 ministry and over his limited ability to influence gov-
 ernment policy.  One major area of policy difference has
 been the government's opposition to negotiations with the
 Palestine Liberation Organization.
 Rabin may hold off naming .a replacement pending an
 assessment of factional requirements for his coalition
 cabinet.  Yariv belongs to the dominant Mapai faction
 of Rabin's Labor Party, and his departure should not
 jeopardize the coalition.   The Prime Minister may also
 study the need for a separate information ministry.
 Yariv, upset over the lack of political and budgetary
 support, repeated an earlier recommendation in his res-
 ignation that the ministry be abolished.

 Defense Minister Peres, meanwhile, told an Israeli
 television audience on Tuesday that there is room for an
 Israeli withdrawal of 20 to 30 miles in the Sinai, in
 return for political concessions by Cairo.   An Israeli.
 pullback, he said however, would not include the Gidi
 and Mitla passes, nor the Abu Rudays oil fields demanded
 by the Egyptians.
 Peres' hard-line definition of the Israeli negotiat-
 ing position is reminiscent of the line first presented
 by Foreign Minister Allon during talks in Washington last
 December; the Egyptians found Allon's proposal totally
 unacceptable.   Peres' statement, however, is not Tel
 Aviv's final word.  The full cabinet reportedly will dis-
 cuss Israel's Sinai negotiating position next week  most
 likely at Sunday's regularly scheduled session.

 Representatives of Italy's major labor unions and
 employers over the weekend reached agreement on the most
 contentious issue dividing them in recent negotiations--
 the question of wage increases linked to the cost-of-
 living index.   By yielding to most of the unions' major
 demands, the employers paid a high price for a tenuous
 peace with labor.
 The unions received substantial increases in the
 cost-of-living allowance, a lump-sum payment to each
 worker for past losses due to inflation, and a hike in
 the family allowance.   Settlement of the wage escalation
 `dispute followed an agreement last week on increased un-
 employment compensation.                              Changes in the wage-supplement
 fund and increased employer contributions to it will
 enable those on reduced work weeks to receive 100 percent
 of their salaries.   Workers who have been laid off will
 now receive compensation amounting to 93 percent of their
 incomes for up to a year; they currently get 66 percent
 for up to three months on a renewable basis.
 Another union demand--improved pension payments for
 the lowest paid individuals--was approved several weeks
 ago.
 Although the government has given its blessing to
 the latter two agreements, the accord on cost-of-living
 increases may cause concern among economic officials.
 Treasury Minister Colombo, for example, has warned that
 the upward revision of the cost-of-living payments system
 could negate the effects of the five-month-old austerity
 program.   Deputy Prime Minister La Malfa, moreover, has
 traditionally opposed such concessions to labor.  He has
 frequently clashed with the Socialists, who support the
 government in Parliament, over such issues.
 The agreements will add billions of dollars to in-
 dustry's costs at a time when demand is flaccid because
 of high prices and job uncertainty.   If employers are

 forced to reduce profits, instead of raising prices, to
 pay for increased labor costs, funds for capital expan-
 sion could be sharply curtailed, and investment could
 drop more than the 4.5 percent we have been expecting.
 The three agreements could jeopardize the govern-
 ment's goal of holding total wage costs this year to 16
 percent.   The package will add at least 7 percent to the
 average working man's pay.   In spite of these increased
 benefits, there is no evidence that the unions have prom-
 ised to moderate future demands.  More than half of the
 industrial labor force's contracts will be up for re-
 newal this year, including those of the most militant
 unions.

 JAPAN
 January 30, 1975
 Industrial production in December was 3.5 percent
 below November, matching the record decline set in August.
 The figure is down about 15 percent from Japan's highest
 monthly output, which was achieved in 1973.                   The overall
 drop in manufacturing output last year was the first in
 20 years.
 The cuts are the result of a sharp slump in domestic
 demand, which has caused inventories of finished goods to
 soar.  Attempts to adjust inventories by slowing produc-
 tion have failed, as sales have fallen even faster.
 The Ministry 'of International Trade and Industry is
 studying ways to cope with the deepening recession.  In
 the short term, such measures as government loans and
 easier credit will help firms avoid bankruptcy, but they
 are unlikely to turn the economy around.  With stocks
 now up about 50 percent from levels last year, further
 production declines, accompanied by increased unemploy
 ment, are almost a certainty.

 Philippines:  The size of the Philippine armed  orces
 was almost doubled in the past year to give it a better
 capability to combat the Muslim insurgency.            To convert
 this increased strength--which now totals 105,000 men--
 into an effectively integrated, well-trained fighting
 force remains an elusive and long-range goal.   The con-
 tinuing insurgency, with its requirements for widely
 dispersed forces, has prevented the development of large
 unit capabilities and has produced serious logistic and
 command-and-control problems.  A severe shortage of ex-
 perienced officers and noncommissioned officers also
 has been a problem.
 Denmark:  Denmark's Queen Margrethe yesterday ap-
 pointed Karl Skytte, speaker of Parliament and a member
 of the middle-of-the-road Radical Liberal Party, to at-
 tempt to form a new government.  Both caretaker Prime
 Minister Hartling and Social Democratic leader Jorgensen
 recommended Skytte.   Because none of the Danish politi-
 cal parties wants another election right now, Skytte
 appears to have a better than even chance of putting a
 new government together; he would not necessarily head
 it.
