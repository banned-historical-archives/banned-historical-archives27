 28 March 1966
 Set-        Soviet Concern with
 backs to    "spectaculars."
 science
 Unconvincingly, the
 Soviets announced on 5 March that
 the craft that hit Venus on 1
 March has been sterilized before
 launch and that its mission had
 been a soft landing (later cor-
 rected to say:   to land on the
 planet).   This announcement was
 a feeble response to the concern
 and confusion expressed earlier
 by US and European scientists.
 (See Press Comment 3 and 4 March
 66)  Sterilization of spacecraft
 destined for other planets is a
 complex, expensive matter and a
 burning issue among US scien-
 tists; yet Soviet scientists
 at international conferences
 cannot be drawn into meaningful
 discussions of this subject.
 Hence, it is believed that the
 Soviets have probably failed to
 take the fullest possible pre-
 cautions against the contamina-
 tion of Venus and consequently
 they could have jeopardized
 future scientific research in
 the environment of Venus.  Also,
 the announcement contradicted a
 Soviet report of 28 Nov 65 that
 the craft, Venus-3, and its com-
 panion, Venus-21{ would pass the
 planet on different sides and
 report back.
 Some questions piquing the
 curiosity of Western scientists
 are:
 --Why does Soviet publicity
 consistently cast doubt
 on the validity of Soviet
 technological feats which
 deserve praise?
 Briefly Noted
 000,
 --Why can't Soviet scientists
 share fully in the world's
 dialogue concerning the con-
 quest of space?
 Part of the answer is found in
 the pathological secrecy underlying
 Soviet society, as seen once more in
 connection with the successful Luna
 9 (see BPG #994).
 The               "Socialist" -- but
 trickery          Really  Communist"
 of words.
 Among the 21 conditions
 for admission to the
 COMINTERN, Lenin specifically pre-
 scribed the use of the name Commu-
 nist Party and also required appli-
 cants to agree to identify themselves
 asa "Section of the Communist Inter-
 national."  But communist strategists
 have long since attempted to appro-
 priate the term socialist to gain
 the advantage of appearing associated
 with liberal and progressive forces
 throughout the world.
 Bona fide established socialist
 parties and the various types of
 socialism evolving in the under-
 developed countries of the world
 differ basically from communism;
 but the limited comprehension of
 this fact has failed to counter,
 generally, the favorable nomenclature
 the communists have sought.
 In our output, we should never
 call communists anything but commu-
 nists -- and we should avoid using
 proper names of countries which have
 appropriated the word socialist (or
 people's democracy), or of groups

 which have adopted names such as
 labor or workingmen's organization
 or party for the same propaganda
 purposes.  Where such misleading
 words occur in a title or a quota-
 tion, we should either put them in
 quotation marks or add the true
 identity in parentheses or in a foot-
 note.   Our goal is to deny communists
 the favorable image attached to so-
 cialism (or the left):  we can start
 by resisting any further extension
 of its use -- e.g., in new organiza-
 tions, in agreements, etc. where they
 attempt to insert phrases such as
 "the socialist countries"; and we can
 give greater currency to their proper
 title in a concerted movement to sup-
 plant their use of misnomers.
 We can also, for example:  note
 that they downgrade "socialism" in
 all their doctrinal works as the last
 phase (of undesirable societies) be-
 fore the ultimate achievement of commu-
 nism; or we can lampoon them for being
 so obviously ashamed of their proper
 name.

 According to the Uru-

 PROPAGANDIST'S GUIDE to COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 Commentary
 2-15 March 1966
 Principal Developments:
 1.   The 23rd CPSU Congress remains scheduled for 29 March:   numerous
 clandestine or off-the-record reports describe or forecast plans or inten-
 tions of the Soviet leaders and of other CPs for treating the problems of
 the ICM at that gathering -- but the reports are so divergent that it is
 difficult to summarize them.  Most sources apparently assume that the CPSU
 has promised not to engage in anti-Chinese polemics or to attempt to use
 the gathering to isolate or excommunicate the Chinese.  On the other hand,
 a number of sources predict that the Chinese will attend and will attempt
 to use the forum for a down-the-line denunciation of Soviet policies and
 objectives, thus precipitating the "organizational demarcation" which the
 Chinese have been proclaiming in recent months.
 2.   Overtly, Peking continues to excoriate Moscow on the old charges of
 selling out the revolutionaries of the world and, specifically, trying to
 "bring the Vietnam question into the orbit of US-USSR collaboration."
 Moscow does not reply.
 3.   Castro replies to Peking's late-February rebuttal of Castro's earlier
 charges, delivering a long, free-wheeling speech which brands the Chinese
 leaders as "degenerate" and in their "dotage" (by implication, holding on
 to their posts after they have become "biologically unable" to run their
 country), including by name the "god Mao Tse-tung," and predicts that "the
 Chinese people will settle accounts" with them for their present errors,
 Castro expresses his opinion that "they have been trying to create a prcb-
 lem, to provoke a break."   (The 72-year-old Mao Tse-tung has now been out
 of public view for 5 months, exceeding his longest recorded previous absence
 in 1956-57 when he is believed to have suffered a stroke,  This absence,plus
 a recent outpouring of idolatrous propaganda, leads observers to speculate
 that he may be nearing the end of the road.)
 4.  A Yugoslav correspondent reports from Moscow that "observers" there em-
 phasize that China's aim is to pressure the USSR to open in Europe a second
 front of struggle against imperialism and'also to push North Korea into a
 similar move against South Korea.
 5.  Western correspondents in Moscow report continued rumors there -- trace-
 able to the Chinese Embassy -- of the move of large Soviet troop units into
 Mongolia in accordance with the 1966 Soviet-Mongolian mutual assistance
 treaty.
 6.  The Miyamoto-led Japanese CP delegation flies from Peking to Pyongyang.
 In Europe, Italian CP SecyGen Longo confers with Polish First Secy Gomulka

 in Warsaw, and a Kadar-Kallai Hungarian party-state delegation visits
 Rumania.  Emphasis is on the need for unity, but nothing is heard from
 either Warsaw or Bucharest about an international CP meeting.
 7.  The Yugoslav Party CC approves a 17-point resolution embodying such
 far-reaching economic and social changes that press observers call it a
 new "greap leap forward -- in revisionism."
 8,  In neighboring Albania, there is fresh evidence, including an open
 letter from the Party CC to the population (broadcast 6 March but text
 not yet received here), of serious factional differences in the leader-
 ship, with opposition to Hoxha,reportedly led by Defense Minister Balluku,
 disturbed by lack of economic progress and Albania's international isola-
 tion.
 9.  Pro-Chinese Communist splinters from most of the countries of South
 America reportedly held a clandestine conference in Santiago, Chile, at
 the beginning of March.  Reported as violently anti-Cuban and anti-Soviet
 in tone, though final resolution omits Cuba and makes Soviet revisionism
 the main enemy (above U.S. imperialism), to be fought to the end and with-
 out quarter.  NOTE:  This is highly sensitive Noforn information, FYI only
 until further notice.
 10.  A further clandestine report on plans for the 1966 conference of the
 CPs of the European capitalist countries places it in Vienna 9-11 May.
 (This is still unconfirmed information, differing slightly from earlier
 reports -- #71.)
 Significance:
 Although the 23rd CPSU Congress will be under way or past when this
 reaches its readers, we (and most of the rest of the world, Communist as
 well as non-Communist) are still unable to forecast with any assurance pro-
 spective developments relating to problems of the ICM.
 Meanwhile, the public charges and counter-charges of this period are
 again concerned almost exclusively with state and national rather than
 ideological issues.

 CHRONOLOGY -- COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #74
 2-15 March 1966
 March 2-5:  Italian CP SecyGen Longo meets with Gomulka and other top
 Polish Party officials in Warsaw, discussing (according to Warsaw PAP)
 the main problems of the international situation and the ICM and
 stressing the "decisive importance of unity of action" -- with no
 mention of any kind of a Communist meeting.
 March 6 and.7:  Peking People's s Daily excoriates IVioscow on two successive
 days.  On the 6th, a Commentator article headed."What Are They Up To?
 -- Comments on the Moscow Talks Between the Leaders of the British and
 Soviet Governments,includes passages such as the following:
 It is true that the roles played by the British Labor
 Government and the Soviet Leadership are not entirely the same.
 The Wilson Government is playing the open, undisguised part.
 Whenever U.S. imperialism escalates the war, it cheers and applauds:
 whenever U.S. imperialism peddles its 'peace talks' hoax, it hawks
 all around the world.
 "`The Soviet leaders, however, follow a different course.
 They pretend to support the Vietnamese people,by mouthing a few
 words in condemnation of U.S. imperialism....  But their real aim
 is to try to lead, by hook or crook, the Vietnamese people to the
 conference table of 'unconditional discussions' of the Johnson
 administration to bring about another 'Munich.'"
 A highly defensive article entitled ''About Twists and Turns" on
 the 7th acknowledges that even "'Comrade Mao has said:  'Like every
 other activity in the world, revolution always follows a tortuous road
 and never a straight one,'" and that, although "twists and turns in
 themselves are not always bad, of course one prefers not to have them.
 Answering its own question:  "'What sort of attitude one should take
 toward the twists and turns in the path of revolutionary advance?"
 PD declares:
 "The attitude of M?-Ls and other thoroughgoing revolutionaries
 is diametrically opposed to that of the opportunists and revi-
 sionists:  the former do not slacken their vigilance but anticipate
 possible twists and turns...; and when twists and turns do come,
 they are never panic-stricken, nor do they sink into passivity and
 despair....
 "Today, whenever a temporary zig-zag appears in the revolu-
 tionary road in a certain country, the modern revisionists, like
 the opportunists of former times, will jubilantly try to peddle
 their foul proposition for the abolution of revolution....  This
 is the typical countenance of a renegade...."

 March 8:  Yugoslav Radio correspondent in Moscow, Milika Sundic,
 comments on Chinese efforts to stir anti?-U.S, hostilities on other
 fronts:
 "...China's aim is not war against the U.S., Moscow observers
 emphasize.  Its aim is pressure on the Soviet Union to o en in
 Europe a second front of struggle against imperialism.  The
 possibility must not be discounted that this is precisely what is
 being demanded in N. Korea now, with bigger prospects of success
 than in the case of the Soviet Union, which, contrary to N. Korea,
 can resist this pressure and recognizes where the opening of a
 second front in Europe or in the Far East would lead."
 March 10-12:  Hungarian Party First Secy Kadar and Premier Kallai pay
 'a friendly visit" to Bucharest, holding talks with top Rumanian party-
 state officials.  Bucharest AGERPRES says "the two parties and govern-
 ments hold that it is imperatively necessary to make efforts for the
 strengthening of the unity and cohesion" of the socialist countries
 and the ICM,,-- but makes no mention of any discussion of an interna-
 tional meeting.
 March 11:  The Miyamoto-led Japanese CP delegatibn which has been
 touring in China and X. Vietnam (see also #72 and 73) flies  by special
 plane" to  ongyang, with a send-off by Chou En-lai and "more than

 March 13:  Speaking more than 4 hours at Havana University on the 9th
 anniversary of the assault on Batista's Presidential Palace, Cuban
 Premier Castro waxes increasingly vituperative and personal in his
 denunciation of the Chinese leaders (among other subjects!):
 11... It is painful, and it is shameful at the same time, that in
 the midst of the battle that our people are obliged to wage against
 imperialism, we also have to divert our energies to replying to
 those who until a short time ago we believed to be sincere and
 honorable allies of the people who fight against that imperialism,
 to those who until a short time ago we believed to be honorable
 revolutionaries.  It is shameful and painful to see how NCNA can
 now hardly be distinguished from UPI and AP.
 "It is shameful that even the Government of that country has
 not yet made a reply, but in a belligerent tone threatens like a
 veritable Jupiter and has limited itself to writing a brief string
 of insults and saying that it reserves the right to reply.  What
 fear!  What terror!  What a fearsome threat:  What an intimidating
 threat!  (See Chrono #73, Feb. 22, for Chinese "threat" to which
 Castro refers.]....

 others, the salaried ones, the ones who lie for wa es, who are the

 against Cuba a campaign in the imperialist style, in the Goebbels
 style, in the fascist style.
 "If we are going to argue basically, we must tell some basic
 truths and we must unmask everything that is of fascist type
 hidden under Marxist emblems.  Of course this story of revolu-

 that men are capable of doing when they degenerate.
 We ... have ... one of the first laws of the revolution,
 establishing a prohibition against putting the name of any living
 leader on any street, on any city, on any town, on any factory,
 on any farm;  prohibiting even the statues of living leaders;
 prohibiting something more -- official photographs in adminis-
 trative offices.

 of the Chinese People's Republic to approve a similar law in their
 country....

 men of this revolution, when in obedience to biological law we
 become unable to run this country, will know enough to leave our
 posts to other men able to do it better.  It is preferable to
 organize a council of elders, where they are listened to, but in

 published hardly a word about about the conference.  Then when

 and presenting in a lying and false manner as a victory for them
 the results of the Conference....
 ... Some day the Chinese people will settle accounts in ^onnection
 with the errors which their leaders are committing with regard to
 us.  They have tried to present to the Chinese people our charge
 as an act directed against the Chinese people, an anti-Chinese
 act.  There is nothing more infamous, nothing more slanderous....

 WANTED:
 THIRD COUNTRY ASSISTANCE FOR SOUTH VIETNAM
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION: In going to the assistance of South Vietnam the U.S. has
 shouldered a burden of benefit to the whole free world.   This effort has
 received considerable free world support, but more is required.   The tragic
 cost to the U.S. in the lives of her fighting men is growing inexorably and
 the consumption of military hardware and cost of civilian economic aid for
 South Vietnam will rise this year to a tremendous $10,500,000,000.*  The
 casualties already suffered and the money already spent have not finished
 the job in Vietnam -- even though they have begun to turn the tide.  Defense
 Secretary McNamara has just authorized (2 March) an increase in U.S. forces
 to 235,000 men and is already preparing Congress and the public for another
 boost by assuring the nation that the U.S. forces in Vietnam can be increased
 to 350,000 without calling up the reserves.
 World-wide public support and governmental aid for Vietnam is essential
 -- and should be an obligation accepted by all.   South Vietnam needs help
 against its enemies -- the communist aggressors from the North -- who are
 also the enemies of the entire free world.   In answering South Vietnam's cry
 for help, the U.S. has been fulfilling duties to the world,   It is now time
 for the free world to recognize that the reality in Vietnam -- Communist ag-
 gression -- is a vital concern of all free nations.
 U.S. official efforts have drawn material and military support from
 allies; but Vice President Humphrey's mission to muster country support for
 South Vietnam did not elicit as much as could be hoped.   Formal efforts will
 continue, of course, but a non-attributable, world-wide effort is now needed
 to persuade third countries that the battle in Vietnam is theirs also and
 that separation by distance and ocean mean very little in the way of protec-
 tion in the nuclear age.   Since self-interest is the driving force behind
 any nation's offer of assistance in a situation like that in Vietnam, this
 *as of early March 1966, 2,314 Americans had been killed and 11,472 had
 been wounded.

 can be used to U.S, advantage today -- not in reminding our allies what
 they owe us for our investment of billions in foreign aid after World
 War II, but in pointing out that it is to their own interest to see

 finished in Vietnam can Southeast Asia and the Far East be at peace.

 1000 WH.                CASTRO FACES NEW DIFFICULTIES
 25X1C1015
 SITUATION:  The trial on 8-9 March 1966 in Havana of seven persons
 accused of a plot to assassinate Cuban premier Fidel Castro was widely
 interpreted in Cuba as a phony show-trial, designed to provide an excuse
 for eliminating several of Castro's opponents.   The trial itself gave
 every evidence of being staged, with the principal defendent abjectly
 declaring his guilt, blaming his failing on a "disorderly life of parties,
 cabarets, vices, and all the things involved, including drugs."    "If I
 must die, I will die shouting 'Long Live the Revolution and Long Live
 Fidel!   Fatherland or Death!"', proclaimed Major Cubelas, a comrade-in-
 arms of Castro in the Escambray mountains in the struggle against Batista.
 As the trial neared its end Castro unexpectedly sent a letter to the
 prosecutor requesting that the original demand for the death of the chief
 defendents be dropped.   It is believed that the motivation for this sur-
 prise move was in good part the widespread protest movement which arose
 among the students at Havana University.  Their signs painted on university
 walls went so far as to threaten Castro's life if he executed the accused.
 There is also evidence that this protest struck a sympathetic chord among
 the armed forces, where Major Cubelas and another defendent, Major Guin,
 enjoyed a certain prestige as a result of their role in the revolution.
 The protests of the students are in turn symptomatic of growing popu-
 lar discontent on the island, where Castro's Communist dictatorship is, by
 its own admission, in very difficult times.   Sugar production is not meet-
 ing expectations, per capita food production is off by one third compared
 to pre-Castro times, and the rice ration has been reduced to three pounds
 per month from the former level of 11 pounds.   Other indicators of discon-
 tent are the defections of Cubans abroad and the continued exodus of re-
 fugees to the United States.   The airlift from Varadero to Miami is carry-
 ing out from 3,500 to 4,000 refugees per month, and the waiting list still
 grows,   Some 200,000 Cubans have applied for exit permits and Cuban refugees
 in the United States have submitted the names of almost one million persons
 they believe would leave if they had the chance.
 Castro is also having his troubles on the international scene.   The
 blatant call to armed revolution which issued from the Tri-Continent Con-
 ference in Havana served more to stiffen the opposition to Castro than to
 frighten shaky governments.  Most of all, Castro must be haunted by the
 spectres of fellow dictators Ben Bella, Sukarno, and Nkrumah -- all over-
 thrown by their own military forces.

 That these troubles weigh on Castro was clearly in evidence in his
 speech at the University of Havana on 13 March.   Displaying a defensive,
 whining, petulant state of mind which contrasted starkly with the ebulli-
 ent, aggressive, optimistic Castro of years past, he lashed out at a
 "degenerate," "feeble-minded" Mao Tse-tung, called Chilean President Frei
 "a liar," and the CIA:   "this plague of rascals who in all the ports of
 the world, in all the cities of the capitalist world, await the Cuban
 merchant ships and besiege the diplomatic and commercial officials of our
 country,  Anybody who reads that captain so-and-so abandoned such-and-such
 a ship, or this commercial attach' or the other ambassador deserted, and
 who judges our people by that, would be making a tremendous mistake, be-
 cause he would be judging our people by that weak, vacillating, cowardly,
 corrupt, conscienceless, unprincipled, characterless tribe that lets itself
 be bought for a few paltry pesos."

 SOVIET MARITIME POWER GROWS --
 for Legitimate and Illicit Uses.
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  Because of their potential use for aggressive and defensive
 purposes, the Soviet merchant fleet (SMF) and Soviet fisheries are con-
 sidered jointly.                  Together they give the Soviets an increasing presence on
 high seas and shore bases throughout the world.   (See attached map.)  They
 provide the Soviets with a force in-being to concentrate on objectives in
 particular areas. Besides contributing to the development of Soviet sea
 power the SMF and fisheries are economically advantageous.
 Soviet Merchant fleet.   In 1965 the Soviets' share of total world sea-
 borne foreign trade amounted to only 7 to 8 percent; it is expected to rise
 to about a tenth by 1970.   However, the growth in tonnage and the perfor-
 mance of the fleet, now sixth in the world, has been rapid and is expected
 to continue.*  Whereas the Soviets depended on foreign-owned vessels for the
 shipment of well over half of their seaborne cargoes in 1958-64, they were
 able to ship half of their cargo in their own ships in 1965 (and they have
 never been known to suffer delays in shipping military goods [Secret]).   By
 1970, they are estimated to be able to ship about two thirds of their
 cargoes in their own vessels.   To a limited extent, they will also be able
 to service shipping needs of other countries during lulls in their own demand.
 1958 to 1965 the fleet increased to a total of 8.4 million deadweight tons
 -- about 150 percent.   In ten years ending 1965, seaborne cargo increased
 by about 400 percent to 56 million tons, and the ton-miles increased by
 almost 1,000 percent to 176 billion.   The five-year plan programs a tonnage
 increase of 50 percent, 1966-70, and ton-miles performance by 82 percent.

 The major economic results of these improvements will be a saving of scarce
 convertible currencies and the benefits from exercising closer control over
 their shipments.
 Fisheries.  The growth of the Soviet fishing fleet, now one of the
 world's largest, has been even more remarkable than that of the SMF.  But
 the growth of the fish catch, while substantial, has not been commensurate
 with the increase of fishing facilities.*  This disparity provides support
 for the widely held belief that some of the Soviets' purported fishing
 activity is a cover for other activities.  And, according to a recent Mos-
 cow broadcast, in 1966-1970 "larger and more up-to-date ships are to be built
 which will be able to operate efficiently in any ocean of the world."  Pre-
 sumably, the broadcast refers to ships of a size up to and including the
 43,000 displacement ton factory ship now under construction in Leningrad.
 Besides its canning and freezing facilities this ship will carry 20 small
 trawlers on its deck.
 The fishing industry contributes almost 15 percent of the animal protein
 consumed in the USSR.   Its low time and investment costs have spurred Soviet
 planners to program in 1966-70 an increase in the catch by 50 percent or more.
 The geographical areas of Soviet fishing activity -- actual and poten-
 tial -- are shown on the attached map.  Also shown are the land bases for
 fishing activities in Africa, South America, Asia, and Caribbean which the
 Soviets have either established or have shown an interest in establishing.
 Another revelation of the geographic scope of Soviet fishing activities is
 indicated by the industry's significant auxiliary, the world's largest and
 most active fleet of oceanographic vessels.  This fleet consists of at least
 18 well-equipped vessels from which Soviet scientists have conducted re-
 search in:  the Northeast, Northwest, Central, and South Atlantic; the Car-
 ibbean; the Mediterranean; the Red Sea; the Indian Ocean; the Arctic; the
 Antarctic; and the Pacific.   (Details of last sentence  S E C R E T.)
 Intelligence collection and support for navy:  This coverage by the
 fishing ships, plus the sealanes which are or could be covered by Soviet
 merchant ships, provide the Soviets with a virtually unlimited scope of
 operations on the high seas.   The Soviets have taken advantage of several
 opportunities to use fishing and merchant ships for the collection of
 *1948-1955:   fishing fleet horsepower increased by 242 percent (to 834,200)
 and the number of ships by 244 percent (to 10,872) while the fish catch (in-
 cluding whales and other sea animals) increased only by 74 percent (to
 2,737,000 tons).
 1965:   fish catch exceeded original play by 26 percent and was 112 percent
 more than 1955, compared to an increase in the fleet's horsepower by 193
 percent,   (Western analysis based on unclassified sources.)

 intelligence and support of their navy.   Such uses have been extensive elec-
 tronic monitoring and photography of US and Allied naval vessels on maneuver
 and US missile and space shots, and refueling of naval vessels on the high
 seas.   (Secret)
 Most of the Soviet intelligence collection has been performed by
 trawlers stripped of their fishing gear which has been replaced by electronic
 equipment.   It is noteworthy that no Soviet fishing trawler so equipped has
 ever been registered at a non-bloc port.   (Secret)
 Potential uses:   Of greater concern, however, are the potential useq to
 which such vessels could be put.   Among the numerous fears which have been
 raised, the more plausible are the following:   landing of small guerrilla
 or sabotage units; logistic support of Soviet submarines and other warships
 on the high seas; expanded intelligence collection by electronic means;
 guidance of submarine-launched missiles through precise mapping of ocean
 topography and by stationing well-equipped vessel between shore and distant
 submarines; detection and reporting of other nations' submarines by trawlers
 (between 200 and 800 of them fish in the NE Atlantic on a year-round basis).
 (Secret)
 Soviet penetration objectives and methods:  A separate but related
 problem arises in the sphere of Soviet aid in the establishment of fisheries
 in underdeveloped countries.   As shown on the attached map, the Soviets have
 completed or are building fisheries in 6 countries and have entered into
 discussions with 5 other countries about establishing fisheries with Soviet
 aid.   Not only does this form of aid provide the Soviets land bases far from
 their own shores for possible uses in intelligence collection and naval
 support, but it also has been an early step in the penetration of under-
 developed countries.
 Soviet fisheries activities in 3 African countries -- Ghana, Somalia,
 and Senegal -- yield some insight into the Soviet methods and objectives.
 In Ghana, a fishery was among the first batch of projects discussed, and
 was included in the August 1960 agreement which provided the first USSR
 credit given Ghana.   This economic agreement preceded the first Soviet
 military aid to Ghana by an estimated 1 to 2 years.   In Somalia, a fish
 cannery was on the original list of projects under the June 1961 economic
 aid agreement with the USSR.   The first Soviet military aid to Somalia dates
 from November 1963, almost 2.1/2 years later.   In Senegal, the first and
 only economic aid agreement, signed in November 1964, covered the construc-
 tion of a tuna-fishing complex.
 From the foregoing it can be speculated that the Soviets use fisheries
 as a lure in the early stages of their economic-political-military pene-
 tration of underdeveloped countries.   The recently publicized espionage and
 insurgency activities in Ghana and the Soviet focus on Somalia for their
 military assistance and instruction in East Africa serve as a warning against
 possible Soviet motives in offering assistance in establishing fisheries.

 Activities by other bloc countries:  In addition to the Soviet efforts
 along these lines, account should be taken of some of the activities of other
 bloc countries.   Poland was active in the preliminary steps to set up a
 fishery in Guinea; recently however, the Soviets are reportedly taking over
 this activity.   East Germany has supplied 10 fishing vessels on credit to
 Tunisia under an April 196+ agreement.  And the Bulgarians and Ethiopians
 have discussed a joint venture to develop the fishing industry of Ethiopia.

 1002.                        MAY DAY CELEBRATIONS
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  May 1 (May Day), first proposed by the Second Socialist
 International in 1889 as a day for world-wide labor demonstrations, will
 be observed as Labor Day in many free and in all the Communist-controlled
 countries.   Celebrations will range from entertainment, to serious rallies,
 marches, parades, demonstrations, and possibly to riots.   In the Communist
 countries, May Day is a government-organized propaganda spectacle; and in
 certain Free World countries Communists are the most active May Day cele-
 brants.   Originally, May Day celebrations sought to muster international
 labor solidarity, primarily in European countries but also in the U.S.,
 Cuba and Chile, for an eight-hour work day.   This year, May Day will most
 likely also give occasion to protests -- be it in the form of resolutions
 or of demonstrations at U.S. embassies on the war in Vietnam.
 It is somewhat ironical that the big achievements made by labor, es-
 pecially in the advanced. countries, have made the masses of non-Communist
 workers increasingly apathetic to May Day celebrations, even in the many
 countries where May Day is a paid holiday today.  With the improved living
 standards and the faster-living societies, the accent is more on private
 or family relaxation in a great variety of forms rather than on organized
 political, socio-economic or similar activities.  Where free labor demands
 largely have been satisfied domestically, the accent of May Day celebrations
 is on labor's role in international affairs, and in such instances labor
 Leaders and socialists tend'tbifeel that further justified demands can well
 be met without parades.  On the other hand, the modified character of May
 Day has drawn some non-socialists into the ranks of the celebrants.
 Free World labor organizations (ICFTU and its affiliates, as well as
 the Socialist International and its member parties [see also BPG 186 Item
 #9971 now emphasize on May Day the need for social and economic progress
 for the working masses in the developing countries -- i.e., the battle
 against hunger and disease, the closing of the gap between "have" and
 "have-not" nations, etc, -- which, if not attained, will lead to frustration
 and unrest and ultimately to dictatorship. In these situations, they consider
 the rights and role of free labor a vital one.   In countries where labor
 unions are state-controlled (Communist, fascist or military dictatorships),
 free labor deplores the exploitation of workers under these systems, i.e.,
 less than decent pay, inadequate housing, sub-standard working conditions,
 inhuman labor discipline, production "norms," denial of basic workers' rights,
 etc.

 Communist governments and Communists in the Free World exploit May

 tries issue May Day greetings to fellow Communist regimes and to selected
 governments outside the Communist sphere as well as a series of May Day

 sents a threat.

 1003 FE,NE,g.           THE PRAGMATIC POLICIES AND
 PERSONAL DIPLOMACY OF AYUB KHAN
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  Pakistan's Fear of India Continues to Dominate Its Foreign
 Policy.   The armed conflict between India and Pakistan, which drew to an
 inconclusive close with the cease-fire agreement of 22 September 1965,
 marked the alteration of the framework of great power relationships with
 the subcontinent, but left the basic issues between the two countries still
 unsettled.   Pakistan sees itself in a struggle for survival against India,
 a struggle symbolized by Kashmir.
 The immediate aftermath   of the conflict was a conviction that
 Pakistan's worst fears had been realized, and caused Pakistan to test inter-
 national friendships by the measure of support given it against India.  Ac-
 cording to Pakistan, Communist China alone among the big powers stood by
 Pakistan.  The result was a bitter Pakistan, unmindful of past support,
 deeply skeptical of the Western alliance and sensing abandonment by the
 United States in favor of India.
 During the seven months since the cease-fire, Ayub Khan has held
 private talks with President Johnson in Washington in December 1965; with
 Prime Minister Shastri and Premier Kosygin at Tashkent in January 1966;
 with Vice-President Humphrey in Pakistan in February 1966.   These exertions
 in personal diplomacy have resulted in a new and more pragmatic approach
 to Pakistan's foreign alignments.  Ayub has recently displayed a keener
 appreciation of Pakistan's continuing requirements for US (and Western)
 aid for economic stability, while at the same time counting on friendship
 with Communist China for political tranquility and insurance against future
 Indian aggression.
 On 1 March 1966, Ayub expressed his current reapprasial of the political
 necessities of national survival:   "The guiding principle of our foreign
 policy is that differences among other countries should not interfere with
 our relations with them.   Consequently, alongside our ties of sincere friend-
 ship with China, we are developing friendly relations with the United States
 on the one hand, and the U.S.S.R. on the other."

 Pattern of Personal Diplomacy Established By Ayub.
 The frank talks held in private between President Johnson and
 Ayub helped to improve the atmosphere between Pakistan and the United
 States, and gave each leader a better understanding of the policies of
 the other.  These private talks also set a pattern of personal diplomacy
 which Ayu:b continued at Tashkent.   The most important were those held
 between Ayub and Shastri alone:   Pakistani spokesmen emphasized the
 value of these direct contacts between the responsible leaders of the
 two countries.  While Pakistan certainly did not achieve a victory over
 India in Tashkent, a basis was established from which fruitful negotia-
 tions could proceed.   (At least equally important, from the Pakistan
 point of view, was the role of the Soviet Union as that of an impartial
 friend of India and Pakistan rather than that of a partisan of India.)
 But Shastri's sudden death created new uncertainties just when the re-
 lations between India and Pakistan showed signs of improvement.   The
 friendly personal relations which Ayub appears to have established with
 Shastri have lost their effect on future Indo-Pakistan relations.   Further-
 more, Ayub had regarded the pending visit to Washington by Shastri as the
 third important part in the round of discussions begun by Ayub's talks in
 Washington,  Washington's attitude towards India, in Ayub's view, would
 have had to confirm the US attitude towards Pakistan as clarified to him
 in Washington in December.  Although Prime Minister Indira Ghandi has
 pledged her government's support to the Tashkent Declaration signed by
 Shastri, the momentum of the personal diplomacy established by Ayub with
 Shastri is lost, and the extent of mutual understanding possible between
 Mrs, Ghandi and Ayub is still an unknown factor.
 Resolution of Kashmir Basic to Indo-Pakistan Dispute.
 Both Pakistan and India realize -- helped by the insistence of the
 US and the Soviet Union -- that some accommodation and eventual reconcilia-
 tion between them is essential, but both are seemingly intransigent about
 Kashmir.  Neither government can afford to move too fast or too far from
 positions in which each is so firmly entrenched.  Public opinion in both
 countries reflect the emotionally charged climate resulting from the con-
 fli~:t over Kashmir.  Demonstrations against the Tashkent Declaration have
 occurred in both India and Pakistan, each side citing the Declaration as
 a betrayal of the Kashmir people, and even more, an acknowledgment of
 defeat in the bitter three-week war.
 President Ayub has termed the Tashkent Declaration a beginning and
 not an end.   Both countries have completed the withdrawal of their forces
 to positions held prior to the armed conflict in September 1965 and met
 the 25 February 1966 deadline, as outlined in the Declaration.
 The first Ministerial talks called for in the Tashkent agreement
 were held in Rawalpindi the end of February, with another scheduled for
 late March. No significant progress was made in solving the sources of
 dissension, although Pakistan insists that the talks produced one minor
 accomplishment.  By undertaking extensive discussion on Kashmir, India in

 effect, tacitly acknowledged that its claim to the area is a proper
 subject for negotiation.   This is looked upon as a step forward by
 Pakistan, since at the time of the cease fire, victory could be claimed
 by neither side....  Pakistan did achieve its tactical purpose of
 bringing the long-simmering Kashmir question to international attention,
 although falling far short of its ultimate goal of removing Kashmir from
 Indian control.
 Neither Ayub nor his Foreign Minister Bhutto has given any evidence
 of compromise regarding Kashmir in their consideration of foreign policy.
 Winding up the debates in the Pakistan National Assembly on 15 March,
 Bhutto categorically stated that Pakistan will never accept a non-war
 pact with India as long as the Kashmir dispute remains unresolved, and
 that the Tashkent Declaration of 10 January 1966 was merely a "declaration
 of intent" and not a contractual obligation,

 Official statements supporting forces fighting communist aggres-
 sion in South Vietnam
 Philippines:  Former President of the Philippines, Diosdado
 Macapagal, who was making an extended tour of Latin America, was
 asked while in Argentina in January 1966, his opinion of the U.S.
 role in Vietnam.    Macapagal's reply was carried in all Buenos
 Aires morning papers on 24 January:
 "I think (U.S. intervention in Vietnam) has been
 very opportune, because it has prevented that part of
 Asia from falling under communist domination.  The
 situation has greatly improved with the increase in
 American troops and our hopes have grown that democracy
 will continue in the Far East."
 Philip ip nes:  The newly-elected (November 7.965) President
 of the Philippines, Fernand Marcos, in discussing Philippine
 contributions to the Vietnam conflict stated that he feels it is
 essential for the Philippines to send more than engineers to
 Vietnam to augment the small group of civilian Filipino doctors
 and technicians already there.  The Philippines will spend $350
 million to send the engineers.  In discussing this expenditure
 and related matters on 22 February 1966, Marcos told the Filipino
 people:
 "If South Vietnam falls we may have to spend $350
 million for the defense of the Philippines . . (it is
 our intention to make our commitment in Vietnam) more
 meaningful . . . the necessity for stopping this
 aggression is obvious.  If we sat by complacently
 awaiting the uncertain arrival of peace, we might wake
 up to find that we had nothing left to negotiate about."
 Marcos went on to say that if the communists win in
 Vietnam, "that victory will signal the reactivation of
 Communist insurgency all over Southeast Asia, including
 the Philippines . . . assisting Vietnam today consti-
 tutes one form of guarantee that communist activity does
 not arise in our country again."
 West Germany:  During 1965 German publishers in West Berlin
 initiated a fund raising campaign for the material and moral
 support of the South Vietnamese people.  At the end of the
 December 1965, 133,473 DP?i (about $33,368US) had been collected.
 On 1 March 1966 a number of Berlin newspapers thanked contributors
 to the fund in identical articles which reported the use of much
 of the fund for the purchase of medical supplies:

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300060006-8
 "In the light of the meaningful, humanitarian
 purpose of this project on behalf of the suffering people
 of South Vietnam, pharmaceutical houses . . . responded to
 the appeal with such open-heartedness and charity that the
 actual market value of the drugs supplied was three times the
 sum collected....
 "Special gratitude is due the German Red Cross and the
 International Committee of the Red Cross for aid in the
 packaging and transporting of medical supplies to Vietnam.
 ""In late January 1966 a delegation of the publishers
 association delivered the initial shipment of medical sup-
 plies to South Vietnam's Social Minister in Saigon.  This
 gesture was received by the Vietnamese public with consider-
 able gratitude.
 "Berlin daily newspapers have learned that (their)
 initiative has led to the development of worldwide attention
 to the social problems of these people who have lived under
 war-time conditions for 25 years.  (We) once again thank all
 the participants for this successful demonstration of
 humanitarian unity."
 West Germany:  During January and February 1966 West German
 Minister of the Interior Luecke has been carrying on discussions with
 various German firms regarding contributions German industry could make
 to the South Vietnamese war effort.  In January 1966 Luecke stated  that:
 "Federal Republic of Germany is in agreement that there
 should be a substantial and well-coordinated German aid
 effort for Vietnam . . . to make the German people more
 fully aware that their own interests are at stake there."
 Luecke is also organizing a publicity campaign to explain the Viet-
 namese situation to the German public and to enlist popular. support
 through public contributions for a CARE-type of program.
 West Germany:  In press conference given 2 March 1966 when Walter
 Scheel, West German Minister of Economic Cooperation was asked about
 West German aid for South Vietnam, he replied:
 "The Federal Republic of Germany has comprehension for
 the difficult problem the U.S. faces in Southeast Asia and
 considers that the U.S. is defending the freedom of the people
 of that country and of other people in the world....
 "We should be grateful to the U.S. for thus engaging
 itself in the defense of freedom."

 Belgium:  In a speech delivered in Brussels on 7 March 1966,
 Paul Henri Spaak, Belgian Foreign Minister and former Secretary General
 of NATO posed a series of questions to his audience stressing the far
 reaching implications of what was going on in Vietnam:
 In 1960, the North Vietnamese CP declared (publicly)
 that the objective of North Vietnam was the conquest of South
 Vietnam - that is the way the affair began . . . little by
 little North Vietnam sent troops into South Vietnam . . . it
 was then and only then that the U.S. intervened.
 "If the U.S. does not observe one among the commitments
 it has made in various parts of the world, how can the rest
 of the world believe that it will respect other engagements?
 Here, we are directly concerned.  (Should) . . . the U.S.,
 which has a treaty with South Vietnam . . . fail to honor
 it . . .?  Is there anyone who would dare to suggest that
 the free peoples of Asia are not menaced by Chinese imperial-
 ism?
 "Much more is at stake in the Vietnam conflict than
 simply the independence or the servitude of South Vietnam.
 If the Americans were voluntarily to abandon Vietnam, why
 should they remain in any Asian country?  I am astounded and
 stupefied when I receive petitions asking . . . peace in
 Vietnam.  Of the belligerents, which ones unceasingly offer
 peace under reasonable conditions?  The Americans and the
 South Vietnamese.  Who obstinately refuse?  North Vietnam
 supported by Communist China."
 Spain:  The Spanish philosopher Salvador de Madariaga made the
 front pages in Bern on 5 March 1966 in discussing the obligations of
 European nations to assist in what is also Europe's battle in Asia:
 "The U.S. is fulfilling duties to the world.  The most
 one could charge is that they should patiently wait until
 the necessity of their battle is gratefully recognized by
 some hundred nations and a billion people who seek protection
 behind American soldiers . . . it would be better if . . .
 European nations - a United States of Europe - stood to-
 gether with the United States of America against Chinese
 imperialism . . . for their fight is our fight."
 Italy:  At the end of a week long visit to Argentina in January
 1966 the Italian Defense Minister Guilio Andreotti, made a statement
 warning against abandonment of Vietnam.  The Buenos Aires Herald of
 22 January 1966 quoted from Andreotti's speech:
 "It is not a question of United States prestige but to
 avoid leaving all Asia and the Philippines at the mercy of
 Red China.  Italy appreciates and shares the desire for

 peace but feels that peace cannot be gained at the cost of
 abandoning Vietnam to the hands of the communists."  Andreotti
 added, "United States withdrawal would also give China an
 open road to Australia."
 Canada:  In late 1965, a Toronto group of brimarily)students
 formed an organization called "Canadian Volunteers for Vietnam" to
 recruit 900-1200 Canadians for induction in the U.S. armed forces as
 a unit.  The convictions and aims of the group have been embodied in
 a charter from which a few quotes follow:
 "The governments of Communist China and her satellites
 are determined to extend their system . . . over the entire
 world, and are willing to employ military force to this end
 . . . only a conviction of the capacity and willingness of
 the U.S. and her allies will persuade China and her satellites
 of the unfeasibility of extending their system by warlike
 means.
 if... all free men have an interest in a U.S. victory in
 Vietnam.  Only through such a military victory can come the
 fruits of American financial and technical aid to the
 development of this troubled, sorely distressed country."

 CASTRO'S MOUNTING TROUBLES
 The growth of Castro's troubles seems to be accelerating; at
 least that is the deduction to be made from the 8-9 March trial in
 Havana of seven persons accused of plotting the assassination of the
 Cuban premier.  Actually, it developed during the course of the trial
 that only three of the defendants were really accused of the assassi-
 nation plot; three others had unwittingly become involved in a plan to
 buy an escape boat, and another, it turned out, was in the dock on the
 much used charge of being a spy for the CIA.
 The leader of the group of plotters was Army Major Rolando Cubelas
 Secades, a former member of the Revolutionary Directorate, once a
 powerful anti-Batista organization.  In March 1957 he had taken part
 in an abortive attack against Batista's presidential palace and had
 subsequently become military leader of the Directorate's guerrilla
 forces in the Escambray Mountains during the prolonged struggle against
 the Batista dictatorship.  He was named Deputy Minister of Interior in
 the first revolutionary government.  Subsequently, he returned to
 medical school, where he was appointed president of the powerful
 Federation of University Students as a result of which he gained con-
 siderable popularity among the students.  He graduated from medical
 school in 1962 and was then named director of the Manuel Fajardo
 Hospital in Havana, one of Cuba's largest.
 Also implicated in the alleged assassination plot were Jose Luis
 Gonzalez Gallarreta, who had been secretary of the Cuban Embassy in
 Madrid and had apparently been in close contact with anti-Castro exiles,
 and Alberto Blanco Romariz, who had been sent abroad by Castro's
 secret service as a spy, but who had immediately put himself at the
 service of the anti-Castro exiles.  Three persons were accused of
 attempting to arrange for the purchase of a get-away boat; one of them
 was convicted, though the prosecution failed to demonstrate that he
 was aware that there was an ulterior purpose behind his friend's
 request for help in buying a boat for weekend fishing; the other two
 were acquitted.
 Thrown into the trial as an accessory, on the accusation that he
 was aware of the plot but hadn't reported it to the authorities, was
 Major Ramon Guin Diaz.  Guin, only 31 years old, had served under
 Cubelas as a guerrilla fighter in the Escambray Mountains.  Since the
 revolution he has served as a high official of the National Institute
 of Agrarian Reform.
 The trial.  The conduct of the trial was obviously carefully
 staged by Castro's minions to be a convincing demonstration of the
 guilt of the accused.  This was an extremely important point for Castro
 because the two major defendants were important, well-known figures.
 They bore the highest rank in the Cuban army, that of major, they had

 fought with him it the hills against.B,atista, they had been important
 officials in establishing the regime after the revolution, in short,
 their revolutionary credentials were as authentic as his -- and yet
 they set out to assassinate him for his perversion of the revolutionary
 cause.  Castro was obviously concerned over the support and sympathy
 they might have among the military, which constitute the single most
 important source of support for the regime, and among the students,
 the breeding ground of political discontent in Cuba.
 Because it was too carefully staged, perhaps, the trial succeeded
 in horrifying many observers.  Major Cubelas, a guerrilla fighter,
 leader of an attack against the presidential palace, a leading light
 of the revolution, abjectly declared his guilt, blaming his failing
 on "a disorderly life, a life of parties, cabarets, vices, and all the
 things involved, including drugs."  He shouted:  "If I must die, I will
 die shouting `Long Live the Revolution and Long Live Fidel.  Father-
 land or Death!"                 At times the testimony was pure rote:
 Question: Cubelas Secades, what, in your view, is the
 punishment merited by [your] conduct?
 Cubelas:  The worstl
 Question: What do you mean by  the worst?"
 Cubelas:  The wall.
 Question: What do you mean by "the wall?"
 Cubelas:  Deserved execution by a firing squad.
 Question: And what is execution by firing squad?
 Cubelas:  Execution by firing squad is the punishment
 for those who commit errors such as this.
 Question: And what is the consequence of the execution?
 Cubelas:  The consequence of the execution by firing
 squad? Well, the decision the court may have taken on . . .
 Question (interrupting -- evidently because Cubelas had
 missed his cue):  But what is the consequence of execution
 by firing squad?
 Cubelas:  The consequence of execution by firing squad
 is loss of life.

 Question:  Loss  of life?  Do you want to lose your life,
 or not?
 Cubelas:  I deserve to be executed, that's what I deserve.
 Perhaps some day some scholar will prepare a dissertation on the
 staged trial as a necessary phase in the evolution of the Communist
 state, drawing on the abundant material available in the archives of
 Moscow, Prague, Peking, and elsewhere.
 In sum, Guin, Gallarretta and Blanco also dutifully admitted their
 guilt.  The other three acknowledged their tangential involvement in
 the purchase of a boat, but firmly denied any knowledge of the assassi-
 nation plot.  The prosecutor demanded the death penalty for the four
 leaders and 30 year prisons sentences for the other three.
 The imposition of the sentences demanded by the prosecutor seemed
 a foregone conclusion until, in a last-minute letter to the prosecutor,
 Fidel Castro requested that '`you not ask the court for the death sen-
 tence for any of the accused."  As a result, Majors Cubelas and Guin
 were sentenced to 25 years imprisonment and Gallaretta and Blanco
 each received 20 year terms.  Two of those involved in the getaway
 boat were absolved and one, Juan Alsina Navarro, was sentenced to
 10 years in prison.
 Castro's "intervention." The motivation of Castro's interven-
 tion puzzled observers until the explanation leaked out through
 refugees recently arrived in Miami:  the trial had stirred widespread
 unrest among both the military and the students.  One refugee reported
 seeing an old, emaciated horse which had been left grazing in a
 neighborhood where many of the government leaders have their residences.
 The horse carried a sign which read:  "No me empujen.  Yo me caigo
 solo"  (do not push, I will fall by myself).  This was an obvious
 reference to Fidel Castro who is referred to by the public as "'El
 Caballo"  (The Horse).  Other refugees reported seeing signs on walls
 in the University of Havana area which read:  "Fidel, Cabeza Paga
 Cabeza" (Fidel, one head pays for another head), which can only be
 taken as a direct threat of reprisal against the premier's life should
 the prisoners be executed.  Other refugees reported additonal signs
 and also a student demonstration  march which had to be broken up by
 the police and by firemen using water hoses.  According to other
 reports, there were widespread arrests in the western end of the
 island:  some seventy persons arrested, including some military.  The
 most common interpretation of these extraordinary protests was that
 both the students and the military viewed the charges as trumped up
 reasons for eliminating Castro opponents.
 Student opposition.  Actually student unrest existed well before
 the trial, which served principally to exacerbate the situation.  The
 older complaints were against the political indoctrination which has
 largely replaced education, frequent purges of teachers and students,

 often under the guise of eliminating homosexuality, and, most of all,
 protest against the closing of the universities for one or two months
 in the cane cutting season to force students and teachers into the
 cane fields to help in the harvest.  In the lower schools there has
 been discontent over the hiring of totally unqualified teachers.
 Because of the large numbers of teachers applying to leave Cuba for
 refuge in the United States, the Ministry of Education appealed on
 5 February for youths to undertake a five-month teachers' training
 course.  The only academic qualification stipulated was the completion
 of primary education!
 Military opposition.  There has also been considerable opposition
 to the regime by the military, the very forces which constitute the
 backbone of Castro's authoritarian regime.  In April 1961, Major
 Humberto Sori Marin and Rafael Diaz, an engineer, were executed after
 being accused of an assassination attempt.  And in October 1961 the
 Cuban police foiled an attempt to fire several bazooka shells at the
 balcony of the Presidential Palace, where Castro was scheduled to
 speak.  Again, in the summer of 1965 a Cuban Air Force pilot was
 executed after failing in an attempt to shoot down a plane carrying
 Fidel Castro.  On 7 February 1966, Raul Castro, Minister of the
 Armed Forces, spoke about the difficulties they were having in
 recruiting regular army officers and technicians.  He suggested that
 party members in the armed forces should work to improve the image
 of the army among non-party civilian families.  This would seem to be
 a rather urgent necessity in view of the trial of Major and Cubelas
 and the others.
 Indeed  the image was even further sullied by the announcement
 on 17 March that the Vice Minister of the Armed Forces (i.e. second
 only to Raul Castro) Major Efigenio Almeijeiras was dismissed, stripped
 of his rank, and would be court-martialed for "activities contrary to
 revolutionary morals."  Almeijeiras was one of the original cohorts
 of Fidel Castro, having participated in the attack on the Moncada
 Barracks in Santiago de Cuba in July 1953, having been with Castro in
 exile in Mexico, and having been one of the 12 survivors of the small
 band that landed on the coast of Oriente Province.  Reportedly
 several dozen other government officials were arrested at the same
 time as Almeijeiras and they will also be tried for "antisocial
 activities."
 Other symptoms of unrest have appeared with increasing frequency
 in recent months.  There seems to have been a veritable flood of
 merchant marine officers deserting the Cuban ship of state.  One
 Cuban merchantman sailed from Japan without insurance coverage because
 Castro apparently couldn't provide a qualified captain to replace the
 one who defected in Tokyo.  There has been a steady stream of defections
 from the Cuban diplomatic service, including ambassadors and minister@.
 And, of course, the airlift of refugees from Cuba to the United States
 continues.  Although 3,500 to 4,000 persons are flown out each month-,

 the waiting list gets longer and longer.  Some 200,000 Cubans have
 already applied for exit permits, and Cubans in the United States have
 submitted the names of almost one million relatives they believe
 would leave Cuba, given a chance.   Cuba's population is only 7 million.)
 Failures.  These symptoms of discontent reflect the all-too-
 obvious failure of Communism in Cuba, where the economy is falling to
 pieces.  Despite Castro's early boasts of freeing the nation from
 dependence   on sugar, Cuba is now more a one-crop economy than ever.
 In 1965 sugar production of 6,050,000 tons barely equalled the 1952-59
 average of pre-Castro Cuba; production of rice, root crops, and corn
 fell to half of the pre-Castro levels; the cut in rice imports from
 China has forced a reduction in the monthly rile ration to 3 pounds per
 person (compared to an average 10 pounds per month consumption pre-
 Castro).  Overall, total agricultural output last year was almost 15
 percent lower than the 1957-59 level, and per capita food output,
 exclusive of sugar, was about a third lower.
 On the international front, too, Castro is in serious trouble.
 His blatant call to armed revolution in Latin America issued at the
 Tri--Continent Conference did more to arouse a determined opposition than
 to frighten other Latin American governments.  Most of all, Castro
 must be haunted by the spectres of Ben Bella, Sukarno, and Nkrumah --
 all fellow dictators overthrown by their own military forces.
 That these troubles weigh heavily on Castro was clearly in evi-
 dence on the 13th of March when he gave a speech at the University of
 Havana commemorating the ninth anniversary of the assault on Batista's
 presidential palace.  Displaying a defensive, whining, petulant state
 of mind which contrasted starkly with the ebullient, aggressive,
 optimistic Castro of years past, he lashed out at a "degenerate,
 "feeble-minded" Mao Tse Tung, called Chilean President Frei i1a liar,"
 and decried the constant defections of his ambassadors, merchant
 marine personnel, and commercial officials abroad.  He cited the array
 of forces assailing Cuba in such detail that the Cuban listener must
 surely have sensed a siege of acute paranoia.
