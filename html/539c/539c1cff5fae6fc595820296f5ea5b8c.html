 2.        New college for training irrigation specialists in Turkmen SSR.  The
 head of the educational branch of the Chardzhov Technical College recently
 predicted that there will be an increased demand for specialists after the
 main Turkmen Canal is built and the area of irrigated lands is trebled.
 To meet this need, a new technical faculty has been opened at Chardzhov,
 a further two year section added to the Ashkhabad Irrigation College, and
 new technical branches are being organized in the Tashauz Agricultural
 25X1    College.
 Comment.-  Soviet propagandists claim that the main Turkmen Canal, to
 be opened in 1957, will involve the irrigation and watering of over eight
 million hectares of land.
 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.  World Peace Council meeting in Vienna will
 include mass demonstration.  The World Peace Council meeting opening in
 Vienna on 1 November will include a "peace march" on 3 November.  Plans
 filed with the Vienna police specify 22 assembly points throughout the
 city.  Reviewing stand speakers will include Professor Joliot-Curie,
 Pietro Nenni, Ilya Ehrenburg and the Dean of Canterbury.

 UN General Assembly meeting.   It is likely that the Communists deliberately
 delayed announcement of their plans in order to handicap Western counter-
 plans.
 In the past, Communist mass demonstrations in Vienna have not aroused
 much popular enthusiasm.
 ALBANIA.  Government announces capture of American and British spies-.
 The Belgrade press on 25 October reported that the Albanian Government
 had announced the shooting of "thirteen American spies from Munich" as
 they attempted to parachute into Albania. The Albanian press on the same
 date said that the state security forces, helped by the people, recently"
 eliminated "nine British spies" who parachut         Albania-with weapons.,
 equipment and various documents.

 had decreed the enforced delivery of potatoes by the peasants.  The US

 of foodstuffs.

 Finance Minister Popovic s stn emen                 the institution of
 duction of the new economic    tem and announcing
 several deflationary deviceso $ Embassy Belgrade draws the following
 conclusions-
 (1) This retreat is dictated by a fear of inflation which would
 follow the introduction of a free market,
 (2) The immediate objectives of this tactical shift are greater
 voluntary food deliveries by the peasants, lower urban purchasing power,
 and stabilization of prices and money circulation..
 (3) It is not yet possible to judge whether the deflationary
 measures are intended to prepare the ground for devaluation or are a
 substitute for devaluation,
 (4) The Popov~p plan gill favor the peasants and hit urban workers
 hard,
 (5) The choice of Popovic as the promulgator of the policy of
 retrenchment, instead of Chairman of the Economic Council Kidric, is a
 further indication of their changing roles in the party.
 Comment.  It is significant that during last spring's US-British-
 French discussions concerning economic aid to Yugoslavia, the Yugoslavs
 insisted that the peasants, not the workers, should bear the brunt of
 policies necessitated by the investment program and increased defense
 expenditure. But now, economic leaders openly proclaim-tie necessity
 for lower worker living standards, at least temporarily.  This shift
 highlights Yugoslav dependence upon rural productivity and indicates a
 more realistic approach to the solution of critical problems posed by
 suppressed inflation.

 Convent.  These statements represent a deliberate distortion of the
 facts.  The Burmese War Office now estimates that there are about 18,500 in-
 surgents in Burma, and Commander in Chief Ne.Win recently admitted that thel
 initiative had passed to them.  The remarks of the Prime Minister may be only
 an effort to maintain the fiction of Burma's "neutral" foreign policy or to
 hide the Burmese Government's weakness.  The extreme air of casualness, how-
 ever, which has been assumed by both the Burmese'and Indians gives rise to
 the suspicion that the conference between the two Premiers was of greater
 significance than described and that important substantive decisions may have
 been taken regarding Burma's foreign relations, particularly insofar as they
 relate to Communist China.

 Romulo was deeply disappointed when it was indicated to him that the US

 Security Council.  He argued that American failure to support the Philip-

 Comm   s  Romulo has been campaigning in support of the administration's
 acceptance of the Japanese peace treaty, and he would be particularly
 desirous at this time of any increments to the Philippines' international
 prestige.
 13.    CHINA.. Peiping asks for austerit   rogramob  In a report on economic
 and financial affairs, Chinese Communist Vice Premier Chen Mun.deolared
 that the nation's financial resources were adequate for the demands for
 national defense and economic reconstruction.  The Communists, he pointed
 out, have kept prices in line and maintained a stable currency.  Hie never-
 theless called for an austerity program on a nation-wide scale.                   Economy
 and increased production, he said, "ere essential elements of the Communist
 25X1     economic policy.  F7             I
 25X1
 Co  ens  A campaign for austerity would formalize what has in fact
 been consistent practice in China since the Communist victory.   Workers have
 repeatedly been enjoined to give emphasis to increased output rather than
 to kiigh@r wages. Peasants have been propagandized on the duty of paying
 htg1 taxes.  "Voluntary" contributions to support the Korean campaign have
 been exacted from all classes.  The Communists have enforced austerity with
 marked vigor.  As a result, they have managed fairly well to keep the
 economy stable and have avoided the sort of inflationary spiral which cost
 the Nationalists public prestige after World War II.

 15.                  palai Lama endorses Communist program for the "liberation"
 of Tibet..  Peiping radio has broadcast an exchange of telegrams between
 Mao Tse-tung in Peiping and the Dalai Lama in Lhasa.  Mao thanked the Dalai
 Lama for his "efforts in implementing the agreement for the peaceful
 liberation of Tibet."  The Dalai Lama had advised Mao on 24 October that the
 local government, monks and populace of Tibet are giving the May 1951
 25X1     agreement "unanimous support."
 C   gn o  A delegation from Lhasa concluded an agreement with the
 Peiping regime in May 1951 providing for Tibetan cooperation in the ex-
 tension of Chinese Communist authority over V.bet.  It was widely believed
 that the Dalai Lama, in refuge on the Indian border, would repudiate this
 agreement, which deprived him of all significant power in Tibet.  However,
 by September the Dalai Lama had rr-+,i-ned. to Lhasa, under no(-. unntion by
 Chinese Communist advance forces,;and has since been expected to endorse
 the agreement.  The Dalai Lama's adherence will facilitate the consolidation
 of Communist control of Tibet.

 The lower house seems to feel that Germany's anticipated new political
 position has already been achieved, and that any further attempts of the
 Allies to complete unfinished programs are a violation of the sovereignty
 Germany has not yet gained.  Our representatives expect this attitude to
 become more evident before the contractual relationship goes into effect,

 "undue" optimism, are even talking of unification of the major non-Communist

 Meanwhile, there are indications that Moscow has given the French
 Communists a free hand for organizing an "economic" mass movement devoid
 of "political antics."  Strikes will probably be called during the UN
 2 5X1   Assembly session in Paris.
 Comment:  The General Labor Confederation dominates French labor
 largely because the non-Communist unions have always failed to cooperate
 effectively.  Virtually every political crisis in recent years has been
 precipitated by the Socialists who feared General Labor Confederation gains
 at the expense of the non-Communist unions.
 The Socialists, in order to prevent a Gaullist accession to power, may
 now try to strengthen the wobbly Pleven government by supporting such-a
 national economic conference.
 French Communists have consistently failed in their strike movements
 largely because they were ordered to tie in political objectives.
 French show continued interest in trade with USSR:  A Foreign Office
 spokesman has told a    Embassy official that France p ans "active" pursuit
 of the current trade negotiations with the USSR in view of increased French
 grain import requirements and declining supplies of dollars.  The spokesman
 added that COGOM commitments would "of course be scrupulously observed."
 25X1
 Comment:  These trade negotiations were begun after the two countries
 sign.  a general commercial treaty early in September 1951.  French officials
 have been placing increasing emphasis on their country's need for more
 imports from the Soviet Orbit, and at the August UN-sponsored meeting on
 East-West trade the French eagerly explored all possibilities of trade with
 the USSR in non-critical items.  The USSR consistently demanded strategic
 commodities in return for Russian grain.
 The French have previously admitted that they reserved the right to
 export limited quantities of critical items to the Orbit when necessary to
 obtain vital imports such as coal.  It is doubtful,, hovyever, that French
 grain needs are urgent inasmuch as the 1951 bread-grain harvest nearly
 fulfilled French needs, and this year's abundant rainfall has greatly
 reduced feed-grain requirements.
 NETHERLANDS.  Benelux countries may oppose European Defense Forces plan:
 A Social! st member o  the Dutch Parliament states confidentially that the

 is divided on the issue, with the Socialists and Catholics supporting the
 25X1    P. Comment:  The Meeting of Benelux ministers ostensibly was intended
 to examine The various questions which might be raised in connection with
 a common European defense organization.  None of the Benelux countries has
 indicated any enthusiasm for the plan, and the Dutch Foreign Minister is
 known to be personally opposed.  However, after much Cabinet and high-level
 discussion, the Dutch recently sent an official delegate to the European
 Defense Forces conference in Paris.

 Comment:  Spain has long resented the preponderant French influence in
 Morocco  and desires to strengthen Spanish prestige with the Arab states.
 By apparently relaxing their severe repression of nationalism, by
 promising participation in government now, and by hinting that Spain favors.
 Moroccan independence, Spanish officials hope to discredit France with the
 Arab League and improve Spain's relations.  Spain has no intention, however,
 of relinquishing its hold on Morocco,

 8.   SWEDEN.  Foreign Minister fears UN may become a broadened NATO:  On the
 anniversary of the UN, Swedish Foreign Minister Unden stated in a public
 address that the UN must not become an anti-Communist alliance.  Although
 he admitted the non-..aggressive and basically legitimate character of the
 Atlantic Pact, the UN would not, in his opinion, be able to preserve its
 character as a universal organization for international cooperation if it
 becomes an enlarged anti-Communist alliance.
 Comment:  The Swedish Government, which continues to favor an "alliance
 free" foreign policy, harbors certain apprehensions that if the UN becomes
 strongly anti-Communist, that is, anti Russian, Sweden may be forced to
 disassociate itself from that organization and retreat into an isolated
 seclusion.  That the Swedes are disturbed by the impact such a move would
 have on their reputation as well as on their security, was indicated by
 the fact that Unden took great pains to quote the London Times and Sir
 Gladwyn Jebb to show that Sweden is not alone in its desire    keep the UN
 an organization for "harmonizing the actions of the nations in different
 fields."

 Comment:  The Taluei was faced with deregistration proceedings under
 try
 the 1 August Panamanian directive ordering the cancellation of regismaterials
 for all vessels calling at Communist ports in Asia or caring war
 to Macao or Hong Kong.  The freighter recently delivered a cargo of
 strategic manganese to Macao for alleged transshipment to China.
 The US Consul in Hong Kong believes that P. J. Lobo, Macaots economic
 director and reputed political boss, will welcome all such applications for
 transfer to Portuguese registry.  A Portuguese Foreign Office spokesman has
 stated informally in Lisbon that only Portuguese-otivned ships are eligible
 for Portuguese registry; he gave his assurances that he will watch closely
 all applications for Portuguese registry.
