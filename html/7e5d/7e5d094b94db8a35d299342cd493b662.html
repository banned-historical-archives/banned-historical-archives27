 among the PRC leadership on this point. With KO
 percent ~rf China"s population (approximately 1 bil-
 lion) ernpluycd in agriculture, Chinese leaders see
 modernization in this sector as the principal means of
 acquiring capital to finance overall modernization and
 as the quickest means of improving the quality of life
 fur most Chinese. Success here is the key to success of
 the entire plan.
 Industrial modcrnilatiun is seen as contributing to
 Chinas economic and political status in the world
 arena a, well as imhroving living conditions within the
 cuuntn. Chinese leaders have increasingly emphasized
 development of light industry, to include energy
 resources" as a principal means oC capital accumula-
 tion. The products of light industry arc to be geared to
 both domestic and furcign amsumptii.m. Exploitation
 of China"s energy resources is critical to the acquisition
 of furcign exchange and to the support of heavy
 industry. Modernization of Chinn"s heavy industry has
 been made more of a lung-term priority" but it is still
 vital to f financing o1 the nwdcrnizution program and to
 impnrving the milit~rry industrial base
 The need fur military nu~dcrnization has been stressed
 by the Chinese in both their words and actions (for
 example, solicitation of foreign military technology).
 While an enhanced national defense could well be the
 priority nrutiva~in~,=. force in China"s modernization,
 Chinese leaden have provided little insight as to their
 specific plans for nx~dcrniz~ition in this sectur.~~

 B. S & ~i" Modernization Goals
 China"s eight-year Shi~h nu~dcrni~atiun pion ~y.i,
 announced by the Minister fur S&~I~, Fang-1'i, ;it the
 National Science Cunferencc held in March 1'~ %~.
 Although there has been a gaud deal of discussion ul~
 the politicai differences and shades of cm Khasi; ~ Ii;it
 emerged at lhi. Confcrencc, the statcnrcnt of nri j~u~
 goals which emerged rcnr,rins the mint authoritative
 outline of China"s science and technology prugr,inr fur
 the next eight years. Four broad goal, were shrc ificd:
 ? To approach or reach advanced world Irveh of the
 1970s in unspecified S&~h areas by 19hh.
 ? To increase the nwi~ber of pnrfcssiunal resear~ h
 workers to K00,000.
 ? To build ;r number of up-tu-date research centcr~
 ? To complete a nationwide system of scientific .nni
 technological research.
 With regard lu the first goal, the Chinese pcrrenr
 themselves to be 10 to ?~ years behind the advanced
 nations in must areas of science and technology. ~1hile
 they plan Lo reach 1910 levels of Western ta~hnology ui
 some unspecified fields by I ~>~iti, they hut,c to r~;u;il ur

 that the past 10 to 12 years have seen a widening of the
 technology gap between the advanced nations and the
 PRC.
 China recognizes that an enhanced educational system
 is central to the realization of each of its four broad
 S&T goals. The PRC has made it clear that it intends
 to place renewed emphasis on academic excellence in
 its universities and technical schools and to raise the
 S&T expertise of students and technical workers both
 by sending some abroad for study and by inviting
 foreign experts to teach and lecture in China. Nonethe-
 less, the goal of 800,000 researchers will also depend
 upon exploitation of exisiting talent. Thus, extensive
 efforts have been made to remotivate scientists dis-
 couraged from research work by the antiscience
 policies of the late sixties and early seventies, but many
 scientists remain wary of this shift in policy
 While a system of nationwide research has existed for
 some time, over the past two years steps have been
 taken toward rejuvenating it as called for by Fang-Yi.
 Science conferences have been held in virtually all
 provinces and major cities to bring together provincial
 S&T personnel and to spur plans to develop S&T in
 the provinces. Lectures on scientific subjects have been
 given to provincial cadre to raise their scientific
 awareness, and the Guangming Daily and the Liber-
 ation Army Dally have both instituted science sections
 to popularize science. Administrative and structural
 reorganizations intended to improve the science system
 have been made in the Chinese Academy of Sciences
 and in universities. Personnel in these organizations
 have been shuffled so as to give more authority to
 professional scientists as opposed to political activists.
 Most of the professional societies have been reacti-
 vated along with their parent organization, the Chinese
 Science and Technology Assocation, which was
 reestablished in 1977 after a 10-year hiatus. These
 societies have again begun to publish their scholarly
 scientific journals
 China's overall modernization program is geared
 toward what appears to have become an overriding
 national objective: transforming China into a modern,
 powerful, socialist country by the end of the century.
 Chinese officials have constantly stressed the impor-
 tance of science and technology and education in
 attaining this objective
 C. Priority Areas for S & T Development
 As revealed through accounts of Fang-Yi's address to
 the 1978 National Science Conference, the eight-year
 S&T modernization plan provides for research in 27
 separate fields and enumerates 108 key research
 projects. These fall within eight areas which have been
 designated as priority "Pace Setting" spheres of
 endeavor:
 Agriculture
 Energy
 Materials
 Electronics
 Lasers
 Space
 High Energy Physics_
 Genetic Engineering
 Perhaps the clearest statement of these priorities was
 offered in mid-1978 by Zhou Peiyuan, a top Chinese
 spokesman in science. According to Zhou, there were
 three levels of priority for the PRC:
 ? At the top was the "production-related sector"
 (including agriculture, energy, and materials) to be
 developed first.
 ? The "new" science of electronics, lasers, and space
 was assigned second importance.
 ? The "basic sector" (meaning S&T development
 involving basic rather than applied research) was
 third. It includes high energy physics and genetics.
 Two fundamental constraints to S&T development,
 limited finances and limited quantities of trained
 manpower and equipment, became apparent to the
 PRC leadership in mid-1979. At that time the Chinese
 scaled down some S&T projects, emphasizing those
 with near-term applications.
 1. Agriculture. PRC leaders hope to expand agricul-
 tural output by up to 4 percent. With only about
 two-thirds as much arable land as the United States,
 China must feed a population that is more than four
 times as large and is increasing at a rate estimated at
 1.2 percent annually. Consequently, China's most
 persistent challenge is to expand food production at
 least as fast as the population growth rate without the
 option of a sizable increase in cultivated area. Accord-
 ingly, applied research in plant breeding and protec-
 tion has received top priority in China's agricultural

 rrniain rn an inaestigative phase
 t_ 1luterial.c. t'nder this ublcctive in their plan, the
 Chinese lumped a ~+ide number of S&T efforts ranging
 from the improvement of steel and other metallurgical
 processes, through the upgrading of the metals mining
 industry, and including the devcloprncnt of better
 capabilities in the newer materials technologies such as
 rcinfurccd plastics and metal-plastic composites. Like
 thr energy field, the improvement of China's metallur-
 grcal technology, including that of nonferrous metals,
 is of major importance to its economic modernization.
 China has considerable raw materials (for example,
 tungsten, copper, and so forth), but lacks the technol-
 ogy to extract, trrnipurt, and process them adequately,
 ;rnd therefore is left dependent upon foreign sources.
 q  Electronics. < hina has designed and now produces
 in limited quantities a wide range of communication,
 industrial electronic, and computer equipment using
 nu~dern digital circuitry, solid-state components, and
 medium-scale integration of components. Such cquip-
 ment, however, is inadequate in such important areas
 as high capacity communication systems, geophysical
 prospecting, precision instrumentation and test equip-
 ment, and high-speed, high-capacity computers fur
 handling and analyzing large amounts of data. The

 longstanding policies, both domestic and international.
 These two factors create several key issues, the
 handling of which will largely determine the extent to
 which China's modernizaton goals are realized. These
 key issues deal generally with:
 ? Political consensus
 ? Technological acquisition
 ? Education and training
 ? Organizational management and administration.
 A. Political Consensus
 The success of the S&T program is inextricably linked
 to domestic politics and foreign policy debates. At
 present, a solid consensus exists among the PRC
 leadership on the need to modernize. It must be
 recognized, however, that leadership succession
 struggles or improved or worsened relations with one of
 the "superpowers" possibly could upset this consensus.
 In the middle 1970s, for instance, the radical-moderate
 struggle for power dampened efforts to begin and later
 to resurrect the four modernizations. While the
 radical-moderate struggles ended with the purging of
 the Gang of Four, differences of approach among the
 moderates still exist. With regard to this issue of
 political consensus, a number of questions remain:
 1. Can the leadership mold and/or continue to
 maintain a consensus in both political and scientific
 circles sufficient to achieve modernization?
 2. Will disagreements over pace and means become
 profound enough to disrupt plans significantly?
 3. How would the death of a key leader such as Deng
 affect consensus? What is the depth of commitment to
 modernity?
 B. Technology Transfer
 Chinese leaders perceive their modernization program,
 and particularly S&T modernization, to be highly
 dependent upon the acquisition of foreign technology
 and expertise. They are concerned with a wide range of
 technology-related issues: military, industrial, scienti-
 fic research equipment and materials, manufacturing
 plants, literature, education and training, and manage-
 ment know-how. This is evidenced by dramatic in-
 creases in volumes of purchases, in new orders for
 goods, and in stated interest in acquiring new technol-
 ogy. China's extensive negotiations for acquisition of
 foreign technology raise serious questions concerning
 its ability to finance such acquisitions. The Chinese
 clearly perceive the means for the acquisition of
 foreign technology to be largely dependent upon the
 development of an export-led economy and the adop-
 tion of modern financial and business practices.
 STIC believes the following questions are central to
 the technology transfer issue:
 1. Can China assimilate the technology it acquires?
 2. How far will countries go in providing China with
 technology?
 ? Might the current willingness to sell abate?
 ?  What pressures might the USSR apply to trading
 partners and what will the effect be?
 3. Can China afford to purchase the technology and
 expertise it needs?
 ? Can sufficient capital be generated through indus-
 trial and agriculture goods?
 ? Will credit ratings remain good through the mid-
 1980s?
 ? Will capital developed through exports, loans, and

 C. Education and Training
 Chinese leaders recognize that success in S&T mod-
 ernization will depend upon a far greater capability to
 assimilate foreign technology and to spawn technologi-
 cal innovation than currently exists within the PRC.
 Serious shortages of research personnel and educators
 have been recognized, and China has undertaken new
 initiatives to upgrade the size, capability, and produc-
 tivity of its indigenous S&T work force through:
 ?Wider educational opportunities, both domestically
 and abroad,
 ?Better use of S&T professionals, with five-sixths of
 their time to be devoted to professional (vice political)
 work.
 ?Greater incentives.

 ~e~~erthclcss, S~TIC believes a number of key questions
 remain. Thcv deal with the issue of whether domestic
 SKI educ;Ilion can be upgraded quickly enough to
 produce scientists and engineers of sufficient caliber

 based research by the mid-19HOs. Specifically,
 In the near term, can foreign language capabilities

 1). Management and Administration
 Rcf~~rni in the areas of organizational management
 and administration, and specifically in the area of~
 tcchnulugy management, is essential to China's mud-
 crnizatiun. Recent changes have bccn evident in
 industrial organization, enterprise and factory man-
 agement, quality control, wage policy, and so forth.
 (lthcr initiatives to upgrade management which China
 has either taken, ur expressed an interest in, arc:
 ? Centralization (for example, SSTC) at top levels,
 and decentralization at local levels.
 ? Consolidation (for example, research network).
 ? Streamlining S&T organization (for example,
 C:~S 1.
 ? Financing local agricultural and industrial pr~jccts
 through bank loans rather than government
 allocations.
 ? :lduptiun of foreign management methods.
 ? Increased enterprise autonomy and a form of profit
 rctcntion
 In terms of the management issue, SI~IC lielie~es
 several questions are central:
 ? Can a s~~stcmatic appnrich to managcnunt and ;i
 well-trained scientific m;inagemenl cadre be
 achieved'?
 ? Can control of pnrgrtms be centralizc~_1 or ~+ill

 made and to their handling of the issues previoi~sl~

 A. China's Reassessment of
 Modernization Plans
 Chinas overall modernization plan appears to ~,i;nr
 been formulated with some understands ~g of the h,ui~
 obstacles to the rcahzation ul~guals, but nut with ;i (ell
 appreciation of the difficulty in overarming th~~tic
 obstacles. In late 1978, China initiated a mai~~r
 reassessment of its overall modernization prugrsun,
 specifically tts strategy' for rapid ecunoniic gru~~,h.

 Approved For Release 2008/07/22 :CIA-RDP05T00280R000200110001-4
 Through this reassessment, the Chinese leadership
 apparently has come to believe that the original
 modernization targets were overly ambitious and in
 some case ill suited to present conditions. Thus, there
 has been a scaling down of targets in the 10-year plan
 announced only last year.
 The central figure in the reevaluation was long-term
 economics expert Chen Yun, who was reestablished as
 a Politburo Standing Commitee member and put in
 charge of revamping the entire modernization pro-
 gram. Chen's reevaluation has led to the cancellation
 or postponement of expensive noncritical projects,
 reviews of existing capital construction outlays, and an
 increasing emphasis on projects crucial to the develop-
 ment of agriculture and light industry. Chinese plans
 for nuclear power plants and a particle accelerator
 were some of the major items that were either
 postponed or canceled.
 The most dramatic impact of the reassessment has
 been a conscious deemphasis of investment in capital-
 intensive, high-technology industrial projects. Simul-
 taneously, there has been a refocusing upon the
 problems of agriculture and light industry, recognizing
 that these are the sectors that will supply the materials
 and money needed for faster growth, as well as soak up
 the extra purchasing power of the people, who have
 been promised higher prices for farm goods and better
 wages. At the second session of the Fifth National
 People's Congress in June 1979, China's Finance
 Minister portrayed a picture of economic recovery in
 1977 and significant new economic advances in 1978.
 He noted, however, that there were shortcomings:
 "When our revenue multiplied at a fast tempo, we
 tended to see mainly the favorable conditions, and to
 pay too little attention to the problems and difficulties.
 Additional investments in capital construction were a
 bit too large. Importation of new technology was a bit
 too hasty and the steps taken were not steady
 enough."
 B. Working Group Assessments
 1. While S&T modernization has been identified as
 critical to modernization in the other areas, Chinese
 leaders have increasingly emphasized the priority of
 agricultural development over all other aspects of
 modernization. Agriculture offers the greatest poten-
 tial for near-term creation of capital (through export of
 raw and processed agricultural products) for purchase
 of foreign technology and equipment. On the other
 hand, agriculture also presents China's largest poten-
 tial problem should scarce resources have to be
 diverted from investment in other areas of moderniza-
 tion to feed China's population of approximately
 1 billion. Thus, the rate of foreign technology acquisi-
 tion will be directly and indirectly affected by the rate
 of agricultural modernization.
 2. As might be expected, the Chinese have not been
 very explicit about their technology requirements for
 military modernization. Nevertheless, the importance
 of technological advances in this area is suggested by
 the large number of military delegations sent abroad in
 the past year to study or discuss the purchase of foreign
 military hardware. The Chinese have actively sought
 the acquisition of foreign systems (military and
 nonmilitary) from which they might garner technology
 which could be adapted to their own defense needs.
 The Chinese undoubtedly realize that they cannot
 achieve military modernization through the acquisi-
 tion of large numbers of foreign-made weapon systems,
 but must upgrade their military-product scientific and
 industrial base in order to design, develop, and produce
 their own more modern systems. The 18 percent
 increase in the 1979 state budget may have provided
 for some upgrading.
 3. Within the S&T modernization plan, a number of
 areas, such as ahigh-energy physics program, are
 simply not as vital to Chinese security or economic
 modernization as are, for example, agriculture and
 energy. The development of a major high-energy
 physics research base involving construction of a large,
 modern, experimental accelerator, would be extremely
 expensive to pursue seriously even in the advanced and
 affluent West. It would be especially burdensome for
 the Chinese to develop, even with foreign assistance, on
 the scale envisioned in their S&T plan. In such areas,
 the Chinese have tended to do a lot of talking and
 looking at foreign equipment and programs but have
 made no major commitments of funds. In this, and
 similar areas such as genetic engineering and perhaps
 lasers, monetary restraints as well as uncertainty over
 the proper technologies to buy or develop first, will
 limit the scope of Chinese endeavor. In such areas, the

 grogram while closcl~ munr[orine Wrstern nroeress for
 ipplicibilits to its own needs.

 ;ontruvenial policy areas lur C}7ina~s Maoist leader-
 ship; it will, of course, be the hey area lur increasing
 the number of research workers required to modernize
 (~hina~s scientific and technological base and fur
 r,ii;ing levels of expertise necessary to nssinrilate
 I~orcign technology. Ideological and resource con-
 rariints, however. continue to be obstacles to achieve-
 mrnt of this particular goal. Throughout the decade
 follutiing the Cultural Revolution, scientific research
 ~.v~rs scorned. Many scientists were sent to the country-
 ~,id~. O[hers chose to slip into other occupations to
 ;iv~~id harassment..~~s a consequence, although wcl-
 romed, measures to re~uvenatc science in C Nina wc~;re
 treated warily by ninny scientists who hesitated to
 resume their scientific activity fur fear of being
 persecuted should there again be a reversal of policy.
 (_~hina~s technical expert, are expected to remain wary.
 The decmphasis of politics that accunipanied the first
 scar under China's rnudernization program has bccn
 qualified by the more recent admonition that ideologi-
 cal and political work should not be weakened because
 of the drive fir modernization but rather strengthened
 because of it. Similarly, the surge for acquisition of
 f~~reign technologies has bccn dampened by the recent
 reassessment of modernization goals. 'There is in-
 creascd emphasis upon older technologies "more suit-
 +.blc" to China's needs, and criticism of earlier
 selections of foreign technologies for import. Should
 there be now ur in the near future a reversal of policy
 toward the rule and prestige of scientists, the disen-
 chantnicnt of (~hina~s scarce trained S&T personnel
 will be a nrrjur setback to her prospects fur S&T
 rnodcrnization. Similarly, if China should reject for-
 eign, advanced technologies, the pace of her S&T
 nuxfernization vv~ill be greatly retarded
 ~. ~T~hc Chinese, however, continue to view their entire
 mudcrnirrtion program, particularly S&T modcrniza-
 tiun, as largely dependent upon acquisition of foreign
 technology and expertise. During the past two years,
 PR(_~ dclcg.rtions have traveled abrrnote foreign trade:
 ?  Delegation of greater authority fur provincial offi-
 cials to deal directly with foreign business.
 ? Increased allocation for foreign exchange to local
 production units for the purchase of foreign
 equipment.
 ? fatablishment of special factories to deal in exp~n~t
 goods.
 ? Establishment of corporations to deal in import;'
 export goods.
 ? Financing ~.~f imported equipment and technology
 with "pay back by product" arrangements with
 foreign suppliers

 Approved For Release 2008/07/22 :CIA-RDP05T00280R000200110001-4
 Chinese officials have been considering a number of
 trade and financial agreements (previously unheard of
 in China) which could significantly enhance China's
 ability to purchase foreign technology:
 ? Long term credits and import financing through
 foreign bank deposits with Bank of China.
 ? Barter, compensation, and coproduction deals for
 plant purchases.
 ? Component production.
 ? Joint ventures such as oil exploration.
 ? Tourism.
 7. In addition to the basic problem of transforming the
 economic base, accompanying social reforms designed
 to alleviate the problems of a dualistic society will be
 required to sustain the total modernization program.
 Among the problems considered most critical are the
 following:
 ? Education: The acceptance of a revised educational
 system based on merit, which inherently favors
 urban over rural youths and those from better
 educated families over those from less educated
 lineage. The sudden change in political climate in
 October 1976 has produced a renascent fever for
 learning. The drive in education has generated the
 risk that tensions may build up between the educa-
 tional "haves" and "have-nots," especially those
 millions in the countryside, who do not get as far as
 the entrance exams.
 ? Standard of Living: The acceptance of an increased
 gap between urban and rural living standards
 resulting from the priority attached to rapid
 industrialization.
 ? Foreign Contacts: Learning to cope with an in-
 creased foreign presence (though perhaps at a lower
 level than envisioned in 1978), both physical and
 intellectual, resulting from such things as the impor-
 tation of complete plants with their consignment of
 foreign technicians and techniques, and increased
 tourism as a source of revenue will also provide an
 increased incidence of social contact with foreigners.
 8. It appears that since early 1978 China's emphasis on
 modernization, at least in the areas of agriculture and
 science and technology, has remained basically un-
 changed. The reassessment of its modernization goals
 has certainly narrowed the scope of Chinese endeavors,
 particularly in areas of technology transfer, yet a
 better understanding of what is most critical and most
 likely to be accomplished appears to have taken place.
 The importance of increased educational opportunities
 and of a greater role for the scientist and technical
 expert continues to be reflected in action. Similarly,
 acquisition of foreign technology, although more
 selective than initially envisioned, continues to be
 recognized by the leadership as a key issue in
 modernization
