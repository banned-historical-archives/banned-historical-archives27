 UN officials in charge of administering UN disengagement forces in the Middle
 East believe that Syria will renew the mandate of the observer forces stationed on
 the Golan Heights, due to expire on November 30.
 Lieutenant  General  Silasvuo,  the  UN  Coordinator  of  Midd a   astern
 Peacekeeping Operations, had come away from talks last week with Syrian Defense
 Minister Talas and chief of staff Shihabi so convinced that Syria would extend the
 mandate that he has advised Secretary General Waldheim that he need not make a
 special visit to Damascus at this time.
 A local journalist has informed the US embassy that she had learned the same
 thing. She claimed that Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Rafai had said Baath Party
 leaders had decided a week ago to renew the mandate. A Beirut newspaper also
 reported last weekend that Syria would extend the mandate, but for only two
 months.
 President Asad and his advisers may privately have concluded now that Syria
 has no alternative to renewing the mandate. Nevertheless, we are puzzled by these
 reports, since we still expect the Syrians to withhold formal approval until the last
 moment in hopes of obtaining some diplomatic quid pro quo from the US and
 Israel.
 Asad is on record as saying that the renewal of the mandate would have no
 particular importance because Syrian forces would not hesitate to go right through
 the UN observer forces if Syria decided to go to war. Such reasoning could be used
 for domestic purposes as a rationale for extending the life of the mandate for up to
 six months.
 Meanwhile, the situation has been quiet along the disengagement line, and there
 has been no further reporting on Syrian military movements or preparations for any
 kind of military action.

 A Soviet delegation is scheduled to arrive in Cairo today to continue talks on
 rescheduling Egypt's debt to the USSR. It seems unlikely, however, that a conclusive
 agreement will be reached.
 Soviet Deputy Foreign Trade Minister I. T. Grishin will pick up the discussions
 where they left otf in Moscow last summer. At that time, the Soviets had said they
 would study Cairo's proposals. President Sadat has claimed that the total Egyptian
 debt to the USSR is $4 billion.
 The Egyptians want aten-year moratorium and the right to make future
 payments in goods rather than in hard currency. The Soviets apparently will come
 up with some counterproposals, but they probably will fall far short of meeting
 Egyptian demands. The Soviet deputy chief of mission in Cairo, for example,
 recently indirectly suggested to his US counterpart that Moscow might propose
 rescheduling up to 50 percent of Egypt's economic debt, which totals at least $500
 million; he would not talk about the larger debt on military purchases.
 By continuing the debt discussions, Moscow hopes to suggest flexibility in its
 position and to indicate that responsibility for any further deterioration in relations
 rests with President Sadat. The Soviets seem intent on maintaining their economic
 and military pressure on Cairo until Sadat makes some specific political gesture to
 Moscow's liking.

 US  embassy  officials  in  London  report that no major arms deals were
 concluded between the UK and Egypt during President Sadat's early November visit
 Following the visit, both British and Egyptian officials have said that press
 reports of a pending Egyptian purchase of 200 supersonic Jaguar fighters were
 inaccurate. According to these sources, the press greatly exaggerated the immediate
 likelihood of a Jaguar deaf as well as its size. US embassy officials believe the British
 Defense Ministry is in favor of such a deal and is pushing the cabinet to authorize
 further negotiations.

 This policy undoubtedly is of concern to Cairo, although the Egyptians appear
 confident that they will obtain some sophisticated equipment from the UK. In any
 case, the Egyptians do not want to become too heavily dependent on British arms
 because they are worried that the UK may again cut off arms deliveries if there is
 another Middle East flare-up.
 The Egyptians may be more interested in package deals that include wea ons

 Egypt has been negotiating with Great Britain for some time to produce under
 license the Hawk advanced jet trainer and the Anglo-French Lynx helicopter. The
 Hawk would be a better initial choice than the Jaguar if the Egyptians are seriously
 interested in producing an advanced fighter aircraft. The Hawk is an excellent trainer
 with good ground-attack capabilities that could be built using less sophisticated
 technology than that required to build the Anglo-French Jaguar. The Jaguar strike
 fighter, however, would give Egypt a much greater military capability, but any
 licensed production program for this highly sophisticated aircraft would require
 considerably more direct Anglo-French assistance and for a longer period of time.

 Earlier this year, the British appeared close to concluding a Hawk deal with the
 Egyptians, but in recent months the French have been pressing hard to sell Cairo the
 Franco-German Alpha Jet, an aircraft similar to the Hawk. Sales competition for the
 Arab dollar, especiallly between the UK and France, is intensifying, and Sadat
 undoubtedly realizes that he is in a good bargaining position.
 Thailand continues to resist demands by Laos and Vietnam for the return of
 US aircraft flown to Thailand just before the communist take-overs in Vientiane and
 Saigon.
 A high-level Thai government official has privately assured the US embassy that
 Foreign Minister Chatchai was not speaking for the Thai government two weeks ago,
 when he claimed that Bangkok had decided to return US aircraft to Laos. Chatchai's
 failure to raise the question subsequently is a further indication that he has been
 overruled by Prime Minister Khukrit. Despite continuing communist pressure, the
 Thai government so far still holds that the disposition of the aircraft is a matter for
 bilateral settlement between the US and Laos and Vietnam.
 The Vietnamese, perhaps judging that Bangkok is committed to a policy of
 eventual accommodation with its communist neighbors, seem prepared to hold to
 their  uncompromising  position  until  the  Thai  give  in.  In  a  November  13
 commentary, Hanoi sharply attacked a recent statement by Prime Minister Khukrit
 arguing that the aircraft issue not be made an obstacle to friendship between
 Thailand and Vietnam.
 Although Hanoi clearly at this time is making the aircraft issue the main point
 of attack in this test of wills, the Vietnamese also seem to sense an opportunity to
 pressure Bangkok to abandon its general policy of cooperation with the US on
 security matters. The commentary listed a number of other obstacles flowing from
 Bangkok's  "US-serving  policy,"  including  the  presence  of  a  US  radar hasp in
 Thailand and U-2 flights from Thai territory.

 Portuguese Prime Minister Azevedo is said to be preparing to make some
 changes  in his government, probably at the sub-cabinet level. He is apparently
 reacting to the recent Communist-led anti-government demonstrations.
 According to press reports yesterday, Azevedo discussed possible changes with
 Socialist Party leader Mario Soares. An aide to Soares said earlier that a new cabinet
 might  be  formed,  excluding both the center-left Popular  Democrats and the
 Communists. Later reports indicate the changes being considered do not involve any
 first-line officials.
 Changes  of  sub-cabinet  officials could  be significant  if  they  involve the
 politically sensitive Labor or Social Communications ministries, which have borne
 the brunt of the Communist offensive. The Communists have sought to halt the
 attempt by Labor Minister Tomas Rosa to eliminate their influence and to assist
 non-Communist labor leaders in wresting control of key labor unions from the
 Communists.
 An  announcement issued  yesterday by the Prime Minister's office could
 foreshadow possible changes in Rosa's ministry. The announcement disavowed a
 speech by Rosa at apro-government demonstration in Viseu on Sunday, in which he
 implied that the government would not honor wage increases granted last week.
 Rosa was substituting at the demonstration for Azevedo.
 Attempts  by  the  Social  Communications Ministry to reduce Communist
 influence  in the  media also are under attack. Two weeks ago, Communist-led
 workers held a high  Information  Ministry  official, Ferreira da Cunha, hostage
 overnight to protest such reforms. Ferreira da Cunha may, in fact, be one of those
 about to be replaced.
 A reshuffle in these ministries might mollify the opposition temporarily and
 possibly buy the authorities some time, but it would be unlikely to have any
 sustained effect on the Communists' drive to gain greater representation in the
 government and in the ruling Revolutionary Council.

 In  a  low-key  speech  yesterday  on  the  20th  anniversary  of  Morocco's
 declaration of independence, King Hassan proclaimed a victory for Morocco in
 Spanish Sahara.
 Obviously  appealing  for  support at  home,  Hassan  repeatedly  praised  his
 countrymen for participating in the green march and helping return Spanish Sahara..
 to Morocco without bloodshed. He praised the heroism of the armed forces and said!
 they would continue to play an important role in defending Moroccan gains.
 In regard to Spanish Sahara, the King promised a major development effort
 that would require investments above and beyond the revenues received from the
 phosphate deposits. He did not provide further details, however, about the trilateral
 agreement worked out last week with Spain and Mauritania. All three countries seem
 to be withholding the terms of the agreement until the Spanish parliament acts on
 decolonization.
 Departing from the Saharan  issue,  Hassan  referred-without mentioning a
 date-to holding the national election in Morocco that he had postponed last March
 pending resolution of the Saharan dispute.

 PANAMA
 The US embassy reports that there is surface tranquility in Panama on the eve
 of the next canal treaty negotiating round.
 Panamanians obviously expect little if any substantive progress in the talks
 before the  1976  US elections. The controlled press and public statements by
 Panamanian negotiators have been increasingly blunt in this regard. The embassy
 also reports that many of Panama's treaty advisers are privately discouraged about
 maintaining  a  favorable  negotiating  climate  for  an  extended  period.  Further
 complicating the situation, hard-liners are vying with mare moderate treaty advisers
 for Panamanian strongman Torrijos' ear, with the former recommending closer
 relations with the socialist world and increased pressures on the US.
 Despite the backstage jockeying, public signs of tension have abated in recent
 weeks. Torrijos has bent considerable effort toward mending political fences with
 the business community, encouraging officially sponsored dialogue, and sacking a
 ll
 y
 labor minister with an anti-management reputation. Students, always potentia
 have  uieted since their stoning     US embass  in September.
 The  anamanian  rea y pr posals presente  in   as ing on on
 October   re ected little movement toward the last US compromise positions.
 The Panamanian  consensus would appear to be tl~at, given  US domestic
 political considerations, little will be lost by digging in for the next year on the
 substantive treaty matters most important to them. While for domestic political
 reasons it will be important to provide for the semblance of ongoing talks-if not
 substantive progress-building international support will be the primary focus over
 the next year. Thus the advisers who counsel pillorying the US in international
 forums anr~  ctrpnnthaninn socialist ties are likely to gain the upper hand over the
 moderates.

 MEXICO-GUATEMALA
 President Echeverria's assertion that Mexico has rights to Belizean territory
 complicates the Belize issue for Guatemala.
 Echeverria made the statement during his three-day visit to Guatemala late last
 week. Instead of reiterating his remarks of last month in support of Guatemala's
 claim,  Echeverria surprised his hosts by referring to an old treaty staking out a
 Mexican claim to a portion of northern Belize. The Mexican leader said his country
 does not propose to fight for its claim, but will present it "upon resolution of
 Guatemala's problem with Belize."
 Guatemala probably does not expect that Mexico would intervene militarily if
 Guatemala went to war over Belize. It probably suspects, however, that Mexico
 would lodge its claim in connection with any negotiations with Britain involving
 Belizean territorial concessions.
 Guatemalan reaction to the British reinforcements dispatched to Belize early
 this month has thus far been restrained, although the Guatemalans are concerned that
 incidents with British forces patrolling the border could occur and lead to a serious
 clash. British forces in Belize, numbering about 1,100 troops plus six Harrier attack
 aircraft-which are vastly superior to any Guatemalan aircraft-can defend all but
 remote jungle areas of Belize.
 Faced with the strong probability that a military action with even a limited
 objective would fail, the Guatemalans are seeking a solution through negotiations
 with the UK. The Guatemalans are looking for some British gesture indicating that
 meaningful negotiations are a distinct possibility.
 If the British do not offer aface-saving device, the risk of a military conflict
 will increase. Over the weekend, Guatemalan Foreign Minister Molina was quoted by
 the press as saying his government does not exclude the possibility of armed
 conflict.
 The Belize resolution sponsored by the UK and Caribbean nations should come
 to a vote at the committee level in the UN this week, possibly today. Guatemala
 expects the resolution to pass by a large margin.

 The third  round of  negotiations on a new fishing agreement ended in a

 Both  countries tried first to resolve their differences aver the size of the

 earlier last week, an Icelandic official appeared hopeful that the British might accept
 a limit of 80,000 tons, but his superiors later rejected this figure as too large.
 The Icelandic coast guard reportedly will only gradually enforce the nation's
 unilaterally declared  200-mile fishing limit. Icelandic authorities estimated that
 about 50 British trawlers were fishing "illegally" as of November 14, and coast guard
 patrols ordered many out of the area. The first incidents since the expiration of the
 old pact occurred on November 15, when patrol boats cut the lines of two trawlers
 fishing within the old 50-mile limit.
 There  is  strong  opposition  within  Iceland  to conciliatory  moves by  the
 coalition to permit foreign fishermen to operate within the 50-mile limit, which
 includes the richest fishing grounds. Two editorials last week in the official organ of
 the Prime Minister's own party, however, began to try to prepare the public for a
 compromise  in  the negotiations with the UK, West Germany, and others. The
 editorials noted that Iceland lacks the strength to enfarce its claims, and argued that
 experience had demonstrated that more was to be gained through bargaining than by
 intransigence.

 West German officials describe the visit by President Scheel and Foreign
 Minister Genscher to the Soviet Union last week as a "modest success" for both
 sides.
 Neither  Bonn  nor  Moscow  anticipated  substantive  breakthroughs,  and
 apparently little progress was made toward resolving outstanding bilateral issues. The
 West Germans appear content that no controversies arose and that the Soviets were
 friendly and relaxed throughout.
 The highlight of the visit was a meeting on November 11 between Soviet party
 leader Brezhnev and the two West German officials. Brezhnev told them that the
 25th Soviet party congress  in  February will confirm that Moscow intends to
 continue to pursue detente. This is the first time that Brezhnev has given such an
 assurance regarding the party congress. His remarks were clearly meant to quiet
 speculation that major changes in  Soviet foreign policy will come out of the
 congress. The West Germans found Brezhnev appearing to be in good health.
 The  two  sides  discussed  bilateral  problems,  particularly concerning West
 Berlin's inclusion in three pending agreements, but did not resolve their differences.
 Bonn had taken care beforehand not to raise hopes that marked progress would be
 made toward solving outstanding problems. On his return from the Soviet Union,
 Scheel  stressed that West German -Soviet relations must be viewed from the
 long-term rather than the short-term prospective.
 Scheel raised the topic of implementing the understandings reached at the
 summit  of  the  European  security  conference,  particularly  those  involving
 humanitarian measures such as reuniting divided families. Pravda did not publish
 Sch-eel's public comments on this issue, but neither did the Soviets publicly rebut
 him, in contrast to the handling of similar remarks by French President Giscard
 during his visit in October.
 The Soviets launched an extensive discussion of the Middle East. President
 Podgorny reportedly said that Moscow is not opposed in principle to partial steps
 toward resolving problems, but expressed the fear that Syria and Egypt would
 become  impatient and that this might lead to renewed conflict. The Soviets
 ' "
 requested the West Germans to permit the Palest
 an office in Bonn, but the West Germans refused.

 Soviet gold sales of 75 metric tons during the first seven months of 1975 have
 just been confirmed. They were made on the Swiss market and earned Moscow some
 $400 million. For the year as a whole, Moscow may earn $1 billion from the sale of
 about 200 tons of gold.
 Rumored sales of some 50 tons of gold at midyear directly to Middle East
 buyers have not been confirmed, although a spokesman of the Soviet-owned
 Moscow Narodny Bank in London admitted to "some" sales there. If true, they
 could have earned Moscow an additional $265 million.
 Gold sales were particularly heavy in June and July, when 26 and 33 tons were
 sold respectively. It is likely that comparably heavy sales continued into August,
 when prices remained high. By then, Soviet hard-currency requirements were well
 known because of a looming record trade deficit. August sales could have earned
 Moscow another $100 million.
 There are unconfirmed reports of small gold sales in early September by the
 USSR, in spite of declining prices following the International Monetary Fund's
 decision to sell some of its gold holdings. Any sales probably would have been very
 small, and it is likely that the Soviet Union got out of the market when prices
 continued to plunge.
 Moscow probably reentered the market in October when gold prices recovered
 and appeared to stabilize at around $145 per troy ounce. Sales of about 20 tons per
 month through the end of the year-a reasonable estimate based on past Soviet sales
 and assuming stability in the gold market-could earn Moscow another $275 million.
 If the market allows, Moscow will sell even more.

 The Chinese appear to be highly satisfied with Burmese President Ne Win's visit
 to Peking last week, his first since 1971.
 In a joint communique issued Saturday, the Burmese added their name to the
 growing list of Asian countries that support Peking's dark view of Soviet intentions
 in the area. Rangoon agreed not to participate in "any military alliance" directed
 against the Chinese, an obvious reference to Moscow's proposed Asian collective
 security pact. Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, in a welcoming speech for Ne Win
 earlier in the week, had connected the callective security scheme with Moscow's
 "wild ambitions" in the region.
 More  important,  Ne Win also expressed opposition to countries that seek
 "hegemony" in any part of the world, a formulation that is directed against the
 Soviets.
 What the Burmese received in return for these gestures is not entirely clear.
 Chinese support to the communist insurgents in northeastern Burma is the one
 bilateral issue Rangoon seems most anxious to resolve, and Ne Win clearly planned
 to discuss the matter in Peking. In recent months, the Burmese have taken a number
 of steps that seem designed to signal their good intentions to Peking, probably
 hoping that these gestures would engender a more conciliatory Ghinese response on
 the insurgency question. For example, Burma switched its position on the Korea
 question in the UN and voted for the Chinese-supported pro-Pyongyang resolution
 last month. The Burmese also cracked down recently on pro-Taipei organizations in
 Burma.
 The communique includes a statement that neither side will "carry out acts of
 aggression" against the other, but it is doubtful that the Chinese made any specific
 promises to reduce current levels of support to the insurgency, an activity the
 Chinese have always insisted was nonofficial and outside the sphere of state-to-state
 talks.
 It seems reasonable that Peking, as part of its effort to get an identity of views
 on Soviet "expansionism" in Southeast Asia, would attempt to satisfy Ne Win's
 minimum  requests on the  insurgency question. The Chinese may have used a
 formulation similar to the one recently used with other Asian leaders-a generalized
 promise not to meddle in Burma's internal affairs.
 The Chinese also agreed during the Ne Win visit to expand trade and technical
 coo eration with Burma. No details of the agreement have been released.

 CHINA -NORTH KOREA: The Chinese have made clear their unhappiness
 with the heavy-handedness of the North Koreans in suspending diplomatic relations
 with  Australia.  As the Australians prepared to  leave Pyongyang, the Chinese
 ambassador approached the Australian group and  in full view of disapproving
 Korean officials shook hands with each of them. The Chinese also made a special
 effort to facilitate issuance of Chinese visas to the Australians, who traveled through
 Peking on their way back to Australia. Although Peking will not make a major issue
 of the incident with Pyongyang, the Chinese almost certainly hope to make it clear
 to the Australians-and probably other countries-that they  la ed no  art in
 Pon  an 's over reaction and, in fact, disapproved.
