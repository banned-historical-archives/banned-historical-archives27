 North Korea opened an intensive propaganda cam-
 paign in late October aimed at bringing about new
 talks on Korean unification.             Pyongyang apparently
 hopes to convince the world that it sincerely desires
 unification, to establish a new basis for subverting
 the south, and to blunt American efforts at achieving
 an economic rapprochement between Seoul and Tokyo.
 While South Korean president Rhee has rejected all
 previous overtures, he may come to believe that some
 advantage can be gained from direct negotiations with
 Pyongyang.

 MOTIVATIONS OFD' SOVIET ECONOMIC POLICY TOWARD THE

 While Soviet policymakers have been alert to
 exploit the political opportunities presented by
 their foreign trade programs, they have shied away
 from using economic measures for political purposes
 when the costs have been too high.         As the Soviet
 economy continues to grow, the USSR will become
 capable of and probably more disposed toward in-
 dulging in this luxury.
 ROLE OF COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY IN SOVIET POLICY MAKING   . Page 17
 The new Soviet leaders, while displaying a more
 flexible and imaginative approach to problems of for-
 eign and domestic policy, are apparently as orthodox
 in their ideology as Stalin was.   Marxist-Leninist
 ideology still has an important and in some cases
 determining influence on the actions and thinking of
 the Soviet policymakers.

 THE SOVIET WORLD
 Moscow has apparently come to the aid of two of its
 Satellites which have been plagued with increasingly serious
 economic difficulties.  East Germany and Hungary are reported
 to have been granted special assistance by the USSR in the
 form of loans of approximately $161,000,000 and $27,000,000
 respectively.
 The East German credit may be drawn on in any desired
 currency and will probably be used for the purchase of
 industrial goods, machinery and--of particular importance--
 consumers' goods.  The loan appears to be unusually large, in
 view of a 1953 Soviet loan to East Germany of $121,250,000,
 including $34,750,000 in free currency.  The unique "show-
 window" position of East Germany vis-a-vis West Germany may
 have caused the Soviet Union to give it special consideration.
 Hungary's credit is reported to be in the form of vanadium,
 chrome, cobalt, and consumers' goods.
 Persons apparently implicated in Satellite purges of
 several years ago continue to be released from prison as
 part of the campaign to build up confidence in and support
 for new course policies in the Orbit.  The Czechoslovak
 regime has released three minor figures involved in the
 Slansky trial, including Vilem Novy, the former editor of
 the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo.  Novy was expelled
 from the party in 1950 and, a tfo ugh not publicly tried, was
 named as an accomplice during. the Slansky trial.  The Poles
 are reported to have released General Waclaw Komar, former
 quartermaster general of the armed forces.  At the time of
 his arrest he was charged with maintaining foreign espionage
 contacts and contacts with national deviationists including
 General Spychalski, former minister of reconstruction.
 Spychalski, named with Gomulka as a national deviationist,
 is reported due to be released soon,
 the Polish government is considering amelioration of the
 conditions of confinement of Cardinal Wyszynski, primate
 of Poland, who was arrested over a year ago.
 Agreements for scientific and technical co-operation
 are currently in force between virtually all the European
 Satellites on the one hand and China and North Korea on the
 other. Such co-operation programs are executed under the

 general supervision of the Orbit's Council of Mutual Economic
 Assistance, with which China and North Korea have close
 connections.   It is not clear, whether these countries are
 full members of the council, as the USSR and European Satel-
 lites are, although they are undoubtedly represented at meet-
 ings.
 There have been several indications recently that the
 Orbit plans a.gradual and extensive expansion of its activ-
 ities in Southeast Asia.   Economic assistance and trade are
 expected to play the principal parts in this program, but
 propaganda apparently is receiving additional emphasis also.
 The Soviet embassy in Rangoon is said to be planning to
 intensify its propaganda efforts in Burma through large-scale
 daily distribution of current Soviet and world news to the
 local press.  The plan envisages a news service of suffi-
 cient scope to compete with the American and British infor-
 mation services.  The Soviet embassy has recently stepped
 up the distribution of low-priced books and pamphlets in
 Burmese, and has. established distributing agencies in ten
 widely separated Burmese urban centers.

 THE RATIFICATION DIFFICULTIES OF THE SAAR AGREEMENT
 Fundamental French-German differences on the Saar,
 deliberately glossed over in the text of the agreement
 reached in Paris on 23 October, are now coming to the surface
 as press and parliamentary. discussions force clarification of
 ambiguous terms.  As a result, the two governments have al-
 ready been obliged to take more extreme positions than either
 had originally intended.  Both premiers seem confident, how-
 ever, that the realization in France and Germany of the conse-
 quences of rejecting the Paris accords "package" will carry
 the Saar agreement through.
 French opinion initially saw the Saar settlement as a
 diplomatic victory which made the rest of the Paris accords--
 i.e., German rearmament---more palatable.   In late November,
 however, a Gaullist spokesman surprisingly reversed this
 argument.  While he contended that the Saar settlement had
 many serious defects, including the lack of international
 guarantees, he nevertheless recommended acceptance in order
 not to jeopardize the Paris accords as a whole.
 The two premiers agreed in October that they might have
 to interpret the Saar text in different ways to their re-
 spective parliaments., but that each would try to avoid harm-
 ing the other's case.  Adenauer met such strong opposition
 from some of his minor coalition partners, however, that he
 postponed the Bundestag debate on the Paris accords from
 November to mid-December and attached to the text of the Saar
 agreement a preamble emphasizing that the settlement would be
 provisional pending conclusion of a peace treaty and that the
 Saar would remain legally German.
 The French government felt it necessary to protest pub-
 licly against this statement and to redraft its own "brief"
 covering the Saar text in a more  polemical" vein.   Mean-
 while, the assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee successfully
 demanded postponement of assembly debate on the Paris accords
 from 14 to 20 December, largely because of the government's
 delay in submitting the texts, particularly that on the Saar.
 Despite   initial   success.  of   negotiations   on
 implementation of the agreement in which the French made
 important secret procedural concessions to help Adenauer,
 the German negotiator now reports a definite stiffening of
 the French attitude, and both Sides are backing away from
 further negotiations.

 The German preamble would assure easy passage of the
 Saar agreement in the Bundestag,  and Adenauer could probably
 secure approval of the text even without the preamble, though
 with a considerably smaller majority.   The French may ease
 Adenauer's position somewhat if they refrain from demanding
 Anglo-American guarantees of the settlement.   At present the
 French doubt they could obtain guarantees that Britain and
 the United States would support the settlement at any German
 peace treaty talks.   Indeed, according to a Foreign Ministry
 spokesman,  the French may even decide not to ask the Germans
 to join in requesting the Anglo-American guarantees of the
 settlement for the period prior to peace talks, as provided
 in the agreement.   General de Gaulle's suggestion in his
 speech of 4 December that Anglo-Saxon guarantees have little
 value could be of assistance on this point.
 Geriiaan concern over the French difficulties is also
 evident in Bonn's suggestion that the United States and
 Britain try to moderate the opposition of French groups
 still angry at Mendes-France because of his handling of EDC.
 Mendes-France may use one of several parliamentary devices
 to emphasize that France is bound only by the basic text
 on the Saar and not by the unacceptable German preamble. He
 assured Ambassador Dillon on 2 December, however,  that
 despite these difficulties he still expects slightly more
 than an absolute majority vote for all the Paris accords
 including the Saar agreement.

 NORTH KOREA CONDUCTING INTENSIVE NEW UNIFICATION CAMPAIGN
 The North Korean regime has waged an intensive propaganda
 drive since late October for new negotiations aimed at bringing
 about Korea's unification.  Pyongyang apparently hopes to con-
 vince the world that it sincerely desires unification, to estab-
 lish a new basis for subverting the Seoul government, and to
 blunt American efforts at achieving a South Korean--Japanese
 rapprochement.
 Foreign Minister Nam Il touched off the current drive in his
 report on 28 October to the Supreme People's Assembly on the
 Geneva conference.  He called for meetings between North and
 South Korean assemblymen and civic officials, suggested immediate
 cultural and economic exchanges, demanded the withdrawal of the
 remaining American troops in the south, and urged early estab-
 lishment of diplomatic relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.
 He also enlarged on previous tentative offers to trade North
 Korean industrial products for South Korean agricultural produce.
 The assembly adopted Nam's proposals and called on the south
 to participate in a joint conference on unification at Pyongyang
 or Seoul "during 1955.1'  It suggested that a preliminary meeting
 to initiate economic exchanges be held at Panmunjom or Kaesong
 next February and that "political parties, social organizations
 and patriotic personalities in all walks of life" be guaranteed
 freedom of activity throughout Korea.
 The North Korean Home Ministry on 17 November guaranteed
 safe conduct to any South Koreans who might travel north to
 establish economic and cultural exchanges.   Subsequently Pyong-
 yang asked the Military Armistice Commission to permit persons
 under the military control of both the Communist and UN Commands
 to cross the demilitarized zone for  "nonmilitary purposes" and
 invited Seoul officials to a conference on 17 December to dis-
 cuss the exchange of mail and the reopening of other communica-
 tions.
 Pyongyang's substantive proposals on unification, calling
 for a joint commission representing the North and South Korean
 legislatures to arrange elections for an all-Korean assembly,
 differ little from those made prior to the hostilities in 1950
 and from those rejected by the UN at Geneva.   This is the first
 occasion, however, that the time and place for a meeting have
 been spelled out.  Pyongyang apparently envisages a conference

 like that at Pyongyang in 1948--which attracted some prominent
 South Korean leaders--with discussions on economic and cultural
 interchanges leading to broader meetings.
 Pyongyang's campaign, timed to follow up the October Sino-
 Soviet declaration on Korea, was apparently designed primarily
 to convince the neutralist nations at the UN General Assembly
 that the Communists are taking concrete steps to achieve
 unification.  Although Soviet delegate Malik was less explicit
 than Nam, merely calling on the "interested states" to convene
 a Korean conference "at an early date," he in effect seconded
 Pyongyang's appeal by saying that the UN should not "stand in
 the way" if a peaceful settlement could be reached by direct
 north-south talks.
 The inauguration of Pyongyang's campaign at the height of
 American-South Korean differences over aid programs suggests
 North Korea is hoping that continued tensions between Washington
 and Seoul will drive the latter into eventual economic accords
 with the north.   The campaign also may be designed to support
 Seoul's current opposition to American attempts to build up
 Japan as a complementary economic area to South Korea.  By
 offering favorable trade terms, North Korea may be seeking to
 appear a better trading partner than Japan.  Actually North
 Korea would be unable to deliver most of the commodities it
 so extravagantly offers in its propaganda.
 Pyongyang's proposal to the Military Armistice Commission
 is an attempt to pervert that organization, a strictly military
 body, into a commission empowered to deal with political matters
 not properly within its competence.   The plea for freedom of
 political activity reflects Pyongyang's desire to gain legal
 status for its agents to rebuild the remnant Labor (Communist)
 Party in the south as a step toward subverting the Rhee govern-
 ment after failing to do so by clandestine means.
 While President Rhee has rejected all past overtures from
 North Korea, he has frequently threatened in talks with American
 officials to negotiate with the Communists, arguing that
 unification under Communism would be preferable to Korea's
 indefinite division.   Since he is now convinced that Washington
 is wedded to coexistence and unwilling to resume the war, he
 may come to believe that some gains can be made by responding
 to Pyongyang's appeals for joint negotiations.

 THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PROGRAM IN TIBET
 Chinese Communist control of Tibet has been assured
 by a combination of military, political, and economic
 pressures which have been brought to bear on the Tibetan
 people and government.   Peiping's economic development of
 Tibet will consolidate Chinese control and increase Tibet's
 importance as a factor in Feiping's relations with India and
 the small Himalayan border states   (see map p.   13).
 "Liberation" Agreement
 Chinese control of Tibet was formally established in
 May 1951 with the signing of an agreement proclaiming the
 "peaceful liberation" of the country.   The agreement was the
 result of a complex campaign of threats, cajolery and deceit
 that followed the defeat of the main Tibetan military force
 at Chan.gtu (Chamdo) in Sikang Province in October 1950.
 Terms of the agreement provided that the Tibetan people
 would have the right to exercise regional autonomy under the
 "leadership" of the Chinese Communist government; Peiping
 would have exclusive control of Tibet's external affairs;
 political and religious institutions would not be altered;
 and Tibetan troops would be integrated into the Chinese
 Communist army.   In addition, China undertook to develop
 education in accordance with local conditions in Tibet and to
 raise the living standard by developing the economy.
 Techniques of Control
 The agreement further provided that Tibet was to be
 governed by a military and administrative committee with
 Chinese and Tibetan members, but this measure has never been
 put into effect.   The traditional Tibetan civil administration,
 which has not been materially altered in form, remains the
 nominal government of Tibet.   Tibet is controlled, however,
 by a military occupation staff with the aid of the Tibet Work
 Committee, an agency of the Chinese Communist Party closely
 associated with the military.
 Various methods are used to assure Tibetan compliance
 with Chinese Communist desires.   The operations of the
 Tibetan government at Lhasa are supervised by a representa-
 tive of Peiping who also controls Tibet's external affairs.
 Local Tibetan officials work under the watchful eyes of

 Chinese Communist military commanders in their districts.
 In addition, some minor changes have been made in the Tibetan
 administration to bring about greater centralization and con-
 trol by Lhasa.
 Communist propaganda is attempting to make Chinese con-
 trol palatable to the people of Tibet and to weaken their
 traditional loyalties to the monks and nobility.   To carry
 their propaganda to the people, the Chinese have established
 newspapers and formed Tibetan counterparts of China's  "people's
 organizations" for youth, women and other specialized groups.
 Schools have been set up in Tibet and considerable numbers of
 young Tibetans have been sent to Peiping. and elsewhere in
 China to study.
 Mao Tse-tung's regime has made astute use of internal
 political tensions in Tibet to eliminate unfriendly officials.
 On the topmost level the Dalai Lama remains the nominal head
 of the government in spite of his open opposition to the
 Chinese prior to their occupation of Tibet.   Peiping's propa-
 ganda,  however, has emphasized the role of the Panchen Lama,
 chief contender for the Dalai Lama's authority, who allied
 himself with the Chinese Communists in 1949.   Both lamas
 are now in Peiping, where they were brought in August 1954
 as delegates to the first session of Communist China's
 National People's Congress.,
 The Chinese army's monopoly of Tibet's scant transporta-
 tion and communications facilities enables it to dominate
 trade, banking, and finance in the region and further con-
 solidate Chinese control.
 Airfield and Road Construction
 There are no known airfields in Tibet.   There have been
 numerous reports since 1551 of Chinese airfield construction
 at Lhasa, Lake Manasarowar, Gartok and other points, but
 these have not been confirmed.
 The Chinese are currently engaged in an ambitious road-
 building program,  in which Soviet technicians are assisting,
 to link Tibet with China proper.   The official New China
 News Agency has announced the completion of a road through
 Sikang Province to Lhasa.   A broadcast on 16 November stated
 that a truck convoy had. arrived at the town of Heiho,  190
 miles north of Lhasa, by way of a new highway through Tsinghai
 .rrrovince.   This road was described on 27 November as having
 reached a point 50 miles from Lhasa.   The roads are each
 about 1,300 miles long and traverse extremely mountainous

 terrain.   Their primary purpose is probably to facilitate
 supply of Chinese Communist military forces in Tibet, but
 they will also contribute greatly to the economic develop-
 ment of the area.
 In addition to these roads leading into Tibet, reports
 from India indicate that the Chinese also have plans for a
 highway from Lhasa to Gartok in western Tibet and another
 from Gyantse to Yatung.which would provide a motor route from
 Lhasa to the Indian border.
 Development of this road system will enable the Chinese
 Communists to maintain larger garrisons and will facilitate
 the penetration of border areas to the south and west.
 Communist China's threat to the northern borders of India
 will thus be increased.
 Future Chinese Plans
 A further increase in the number of Chinese and in their
 influence in Tibet is expected after the new roads are opened
 to traffic.   Radio Peiping has claimed that the Chinese develop-
 ment program in Tibet will make it possible for the country to
 support a population of more than 10,000,000.   A recently
 released official Chinese estimate placed the present popula-
 tion at just under 1,300,000.
 According to Peiping's propaganda, the economic develop-
 ment of Tibet will include the bringing under cultivation of
 vast areas of virgin land,  the construction of hydroelectric
 plants on Tibetan rivers, and the development of mineral
 resources.   Among these resources are borax, one of Tibet's
 few exports, and possibly gold.
 Low agricultural yields due to Tibet's high altitudes,
 and the high cost of transport between Tibet and China proper,
 will make economic development expensive.   Peiping has
 committed itself to an ambitious program, however, and may be
 expected to attempt to carry it out.
 In spite of the Chinese Communists' protestations that
 they intend to respect the traditional Tibetan way of life,
 there have been persistent reports of uprisings against their
 rule.   In some instances, unrest apparently has been due to
 such unpopular measures as forcing monks to work on construc-
 tion projects and restricting the supply of food to monas-
 teries.   With the Chinese Communists in firm control of
 military forces and communication,  transportation, and propa-
 ganda facilities, however,  it seems clear that the Tibetans
 can offer no effective resistance to Communist rule.

 MOTIVATIONS OF SOVIET ECONOMIC POLICY
 TOWARD THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD*
 Soviet economic policy toward the "capitalist" states has
 traditionally been motivated by a. hybrid mixture of economic
 and political considerations.   By and large,  however,  one
 paramount fact has dominated the foreign economic policy of
 the USSR--the need to import to make good deficiencies in the
 bloc economies.   At the same time,  Soviet policymakers have
 been alert to exploit the political opportunities presented
 by their own foreign trade programs.   They have shied away,
 however, from using economic measures for political purposes
 when the economic costs have been too high.  As the Soviet
 economy continues to grow, the USSR will become more capable
 of and probably more disposed toward indulging in this practice
 when high political rewards can be gained with little strain
 on tx:.e Soviet economy.   The Soviet policyanakers may consider
 that this situation prevails in the underdeveloped economies
 of non-Communist Asia and the Middle East.
 To date,  Soviet foreign economic policy, despite the
 conciliatory gestures of the post-Stalin regime, has been
 dominated by the USSR's internal economic needs.   This is
 clearly reflected in the modifications of the Soviet trade
 pattern in the past year and a. half.   Heavily committed to
 giving the domestic consumer a better break,  the government
 has diverted a significant share of its most marketable agri-
 cultural exports to the domestic market and has imported a
 heavier volume of consumers'  goods from the non-Communist
 world.   As a result,  the USSR has been obliged to increase its
 exports of semistrategic goods--manganese,  chrome, petroleum.
 These developments have resulted from revisions decided
 upon by the Soviet government in the scale of priorities for
 the internal Soviet economy,  It is unlikely that the pros-
 pects of international political gains carried decisive weight
 in the Soviet councils which decided on revision of the foreign
 trade program,
 The USSR's attempts to make political capital out of this
 situation have taken several forms.   The most significant is
 the propaganda claim that the new Soviet interest in Western
 consumers' goods demonstrates the peace-loving intent of the
 USSR and the sincerity of the Soviet claim that unrestricted
 East-West trade would ease international tensions,

 This theme,  supplemented by the bait offered to West
 European businessmen in the form of large Soviet orders,
 has served to stimulate appreciable political pressures
 within Western Europe for relaxing COCOM regulations.   In
 turning economic measures to political effect in this
 fashion, however, the USSR is promoting an.important eco-
 nomic interest of its own  removal of the remaining political
 barriers to Soviet purchase of goods.required for the USSR's
 internal economy.
 While the general outlines of the Soviet, foreign trade
 program are established by internal bloc economic consider-
 ations, there is still some latitude for political oppor-
 tunism in individual commercial transactions.   The USSR can
 afford, for example, to express its political pique at
 Australia over the Petrov case by suspending wool procurement
 when wool is plentiful elsewhere in world markets.   Similarly,
 the USSR can protest the Danish refusal to supply tankers by
 walking out on trade agreement negotiations, when it is pre-
 pared to continue some purchases from Denmark without a formal
 trade agreement.   Nor would Soviet traders be reluctant to
 stir up a political disturbance by bidding for American-owned
 surplus stocks when they are seriously in-the market for im-
 ported butter.
 The mixture of politics, with commerce in cases such as
 these has one significant feature:   the USSR suffers no eco-
 nomic disadvantage.   When economic costs are of some magnitude,
 as would be the case if a program of "benevolent buying" from
 favored firms or from depressed industries in the West were
 called for, the USSR would not be likely to accept severe eco-
 nomic losses for potential political gains.
 In the coming years the growth of the industrial sector
 of the Soviet economy may well accommodate a limited program
 of politically motivated foreign economic maneuvers.   In its
 present stage of development, the Soviet economy can spare
 moderate quantities of industrial goods for export with much
 less strain than it can provide its traditional agricultural
 exports to the West.  Aware that the underdeveloped areas of
 non-Communist Asia and the Middle East and Latin America
 provide a fertile ground for political penetration, the USSR
 may be prepared to accept the limited drain on its economic
 resources which a modest program of assistance to these coun-
 tries would entail.

 The over-all magnitude of such a program would probably
 not be great.   But the two conditions necessary for politi-
 cally inspired Soviet economic moves would be present:   the
 prospects for substantial political gains would be bright
 and the economic cost to the USSR would be slight.

 ROLE OF COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY IN SOVIET POLICY MAKING
 The new Soviet leaders, while displaying a more flexible
 and imaginative approach to. problems of foreign  and domestic
 policy, are apparently as orthodox in their iaeology as
 Stalin was.   Marxist-Leninist ideology still has an important
 and in some cases determining influence on the actions and
 .thinking of the Soviet policymakers.
 Ideology receives the same propaganda play it did under
 Stalin; there has been no reduction in the Marxist-Leninist
 orientation of Soviet society; and now life has even been
 infused into the pursuit of some ideological goals, such as
 the elimination of religious belief.   On the other hand, the
 new regime is making a greater effort to reduce the dele-
 terious effects of ideologically inspired policies.   Where
 ideological goals conflict with major practical considera-
 tions, the new regime--like Stalin's--ignores the Marxist-
 Leninist teachings or explains them away.
 Soviet thinkers have never maintained that Marxism-
 Leninism provides specific solutions for concrete situations,
 but have said rather that it furnishes a way of thinking and
 a guide in assessing the significance of specific develop-
 ments.   While the ideology outlines general goals,  the need
 for the utmost flexibility in the actual attainment of them
 has always been emphasized.
 The current Soviet antireligious campaign shows that
 Marxist-Leninist doctrine does color the Kremlin's estimate
 of a situation, however.   The campaign's deleterious effects
 on the regime's program of building popular support can only
 be justified by the Marxist-Leninist teaching that religion
 in any form is anathema to a Communist society and must be
 completely, if gradually, rooted out of men's minds, for
 religion now presents no serious threat to the regime.
 The recent changes in rural administration demonstrate
 how ideology influences the methods the Kremlin uses to solve
 its practical problems.   The changes are primarily designed
 to increase agricultural production, but they are oriented
 to such unpalatable Communist goals as transforming the
 peasant into a wage-laborer and reducing his attachment to
 his private plot.

 Marxist-Leninist doctrine also influences policy indi-
 rectly by coloring the reports on which policymakers base
 their decisions.
 F
 There has, been some evidence of the direct  influence
 of Marxist-Leninist dogma on the top leaders.   In an inter-
 view with New York lawyer Marshall MacDuffie, Khrushchev, who
 is more free with his opinions than  other Soviet leaders,
 stated, apparently seriously, that all the American statements
 on the aggressiveness of the USSR were made on order from the
 capitalists to justify a profitable rearmament program.   He
 said that the reason that Democrats as well as Republicans
 support present American foreign policy is that "behind all
 these people are the magnates of capital who are interested
 only in profits."
 The heritage of past policies toward ideology limits
 the regime's freedom of operation.   The new leaders inherited
 a political system, whose official doctrine and justification
 were based on Marxism-Leninism; a people which had been forced
 to make terrific sacrifices in the name of that ideology;  and
 a bureaucracy which had been taught to think in those terms
 and operate under that banner.   The allegiance of many of the
 USSR's foreign supporters springs, at least in part, from
 their adherence to the teachings of Marx and Lenin.   This
 ideological legacy puts practical limits on the leaders'
 choice of policies and makes it virtually imperative for them
 publicly to express and explain their plans in Marxist terms.
 Some of the difficulties of the "new course" in Hungary, for,
 example, apparently sprang from conflict between "doctrinaires"
 and "moderates" within the Hungarian party over the slowdown
 in progress toward Communist goals involved in even this shift
 in tactics.
 There has, in fact, been no discernible reduction in the
 amount of Soviet propaganda and educational effort devoted to
 explanations of Marxism-Leninism and its vital role in Soviet
 life.   With the deflation of the Stalin myth, the ideology,
 in its guise as the inspiration of the party, has been given
 credit for some policies previously ascribed to Stalin's per-
 sonal genius, and the new leaders are attempting to revitalize
 the ideology, so long stultified by the dead hand of Stalinism.

 Marxism-Leninism is still described as the party's
 "guide to action," an "all-conquering teaching" which "arms
 the party with knowledge of the laws of social development
 and gives the party and people invincible strength and
 ability to blaze new trails in history."  Soviet citizens,
 especially party members, are urged to study it carefully.
 Its importance as a bond which unites all Communists and
 provides an infallible guide to sound policies has been
 especially emphasized by the propaganda issued in times of
 strain or crisis, such as Ileria's purge and Stalin's death.
