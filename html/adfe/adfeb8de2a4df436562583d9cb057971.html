 USSR-US: Human Rights Issue
 I      I A Soviet official has warned that recriminations
 over    e human rights issue could "negatively" affect the
 visit to Moscow of Secretary Vance later this month. Until
 now, the Soviets have not hinted that the human rights issue
 would affect either the timing or the content of the Secre-
 tary's talks.
 MI,   de ut  director of the USA Institute, Radomir
 e    p   Y
 Bogdanov, told a US embassy officer on Wednesday that Moscow
 hopes the US will tone down its statements on human rights be-
 fore the visit.                             If not, Bogdanov said Moscow will be compelled
 to "lash out."
 I                  //Since the strong Soviet demarche on February 17
 protesting  S statements in support of Soviet dissidents,  So-
 viet officials have been taking a mo            a   attitude to--

 tor specifically cautioned against putting the USSR in the dock
 at the Belgrade meeting this summer to review progress on im-
 plementing the 1975 Helsinki accords.

 American Klansman trying to dispel her husband's misgvings
 about inviting a Soviet dissident to dinner. The allusions to
 the President's meeting with Bukovsky were unmistakab_e.
 //Moscow also has hinted that it could take
 direct action against Sakharov should US representations on
 the human rights issue persist. The veiled warning against
 Sakharov occurred on Wednesday following the US protest to the
 Foreign Ministry against the detention of Soviet citi2:ens try-
 ing to enter the US embassy.//
 //The deputy director of the ministry's USA
 department, Konstantin Fedoseyev, implied to the US political
 counselor that Soviets engaged in hostile activities would be
 denied access to the embassy in the future. Sakharov's name
 was not mentioned, but Fedoseyev referred to the Soviet pro-
 test on Tuesday that concerned Sakharov and which described
 him as an "enemy of the Soviet state."//
 //In addition to cutting off access to the em-
 assy to human rights dissidents, the Soviets could move di-
 rectly against Sakharov by stripping him of his remaining
 privileges as a member of the Academy of Sciences. The Soviets
 have already made their legal case against him in their own
 press and in the New York Times.//
 //We cannot predict just how far the Soviets will
 go in defending their perception of the USSR's national inter-
 est on the human rights issue. The fact that Fedoseyev referred
 to the damage to bilateral relations,  "which had not been easy
 to improve " a  ears to-indicate that Moscow        move care-
 fully.//
 CHINA: Provincial Appointments
 I     I China has made rapid progress in the last week in
 tilling key provincial leadership vacancies, and also may have
 taken the first measured steps toward initiating a campaign
 against leftists within the military.
 I     J The naming of three top provincial leaders brings to
 five the number of new provincial leaders we have identified

 since mid-February and to seven the total named since the purge
 of the four leftist Politburo members in October. The latest
 appointments appear to enhance Peking's prospects of filling
 other major vacancies in the party and government, including
 two provincial- and six ministerial-level positions.
 //Only three of the seven new provincial bosses
 replaced incumbents.  It is still possible that Peking will re-
 place others who may have supported the purged leftists in
 1976. So far, however, only one is known to have come under
 serious local criticism for his ties to the left.//
 //The appointments made so far are doubtless the
 resu    of  complex political manuevering in Peking and the prov-
 inces. One pattern that has emerged seems to reflect the influ-
 ence of Politburo members Yeh Chien-ying and Hsu Shih-yu, both
 military men. Only three of the new provincial leaders are ca-
 reer soldiers, however, and two of them have been political
 officers.//
 //Progress in filling provincial vacancies sug-
 gests                  at other contentious issues that have divided the re-
 gime may be nearer resolution. The Chinese, however, continue
 to provide conflicting information on the status of former
 vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping, and local officials have been un-
 certain how to deal with directives contained in an important
 editorial published early last month.//
 //The status of numerous high-ranking officers of
 rne     y is still unclear. Three military region commanders and
 the commander of the air force have been out of sight since
 last year,  and the positions of chief of staff of the army and
 director of its general political department are still open.//
 I           IA campaign announced last week in an editorial in the
 Lbi era ion Army DaiZy, the army's propaganda organ, may presage
 some personnel changes in the army. The campaign calls for
 evaluation of the "Hard Bone 6th Company of the Nanking Mili-
 tary Region." This has many implications but the most immediate
 are the unit's record of participating in army intervention in
 factional disputes in Chekiang in 1975 and its annual rectifi-
 cation campaigns.

 Approved
 The "Hard Bone 6th" is a unit of the 1st Army that
 was move      from central China to Chekiang in mid-1975 under or-
 ders from then chief of staff Teng Hsiao-ping. The unit re-
 placed another that had taken sides in the disputes among ci-
 vilian factions and apparently had illegally passed arms to
 one of the sides. The parallels between the experience of the
 6th Company and units that since October 1976 have been called
 on to bring order to at least one province and several cities
 are unmistakable and will not be lost on political activists
 still intent on creating disturbances.
 I     I The army has apparently not conducted a nationwide
 rectification campaign since 1972,  the year following the Lin
 Piao incident which,  according to some local propaganda broad-
 casts, was not thoroughly investigated because of leftist in-
 terference. Although the army apparently harbored relatively
 few supporters of the "gang of four," at least three military
 regions have reported extensive leftist interference in mili-
 tary affairs.
 I     I Chairman Hua Kuo-feng, who largely depended on the
 army to'  -he purge of the leftists, has apparently been reluc-
 tant to undertake a rectification campaign in the army., Accord-
 ing to the Liberation Army Daily, however, Hua does have the
 support of Yeh Chien-ying in promoting the "Hard Bone 6th." He
 probably can also rely on Hsu Shih-yu, who commands the Canton
 Military Region and may also head the Nanking Military Region.
 I             Despite the prestige of Yeh and Hsu,  the campaign to
 emulate the model company is off to a slow start. Only one
 province, Chekiang,  in which the unit is now located, has re-
 sponded to the call for the campaign. Moreover, the campaign's
 public inauguration seems to have come a month late. A Nanking
 Military Region broadcast asserted that the Military Commission
 had chosen the unit as the army's model in January.
 PAKISTAN:  National and Provincial Elections
 I         lWhatever the results of the election next Monday and
 Thursday  or Pakistan's national and provincial assemblies,
 Prime Minister Bhutto will be in a far weaker position than
 when the campaign began two months ago.
 Approved Fot Release 2007/03/07 : CIA-RDP79T00175A029900010008-2

 //The opposition, demonstrating unaccustomed unity,
 has wage    /a vigorous campaign and clearly has considerable
 popular support. It has almost certainly made major gains in
 the large cities, where Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party has
 never been strong. The opposition's standing in the much more
 important rural areas is more difficult to determine now.//
 I     I Other observers still believe that Bhutto can win a
 -1 slight majority, enabling him to remain in office but with much
 less freedom of action. Even with a majority, he could face a
 strong effort to discredit the results if his majority depends
 on victories in Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Prov-
 ince.
 I     I With the government in complete control of the elec-
 tion process and the opposition boycotting the election in
 Baluchistan, the party will presumably win all seven seats
 there despite its lack of popular support. The degree to which
 the government will determine results in the North-West Fron-
 tier is unclear, but, with the major opposition party there
 outlawed, even a slight majority will be open to question.
 A majority of the votes in the Sind, Bhutto's home
 province, and the Punjab would establish the legitimacy of a
 victory for his party. The campaign so far in the two provinces
 has been free of excessive government interference, although
 there has been some violence and other questionable practices
 by both sides.
 I            IRural voters in the Punjab, who will determine the
 composition of about half the National Assembly, hold the key
 to Bhutto's future. Bhutto seems likely to lose in the Punjabi
 cities, and in Karachi and other large cities in the Sind. His
 party still seems likely to do well enough in rural areas in
 the Sind to win a majority there.

 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:  Exports to OPEC States

 worth o  goods to members of the Organization of Petroleum Ex-
 porting Countries in 1976, reflecting a serious effort on both

 sides to cope with their large trade imbalance. While a sub-
 stantial gain from the early 1970s, this amount is still far
 from covering the $20 billion of imports that these developing
 countries take from the oil producers.
 I     I Since the oil price hikes of 1973 and 1974, the OPEC
 members have been under considerable pressure to favor imports
 from other developing nations. These countries have stressed
 in various international forums the need for increased sales
 to OPEC members, and many government-sponsored delegations
 have toured OPEC capitals to promote sales and to negotiate
 new bilateral trade agreements.
 I     I The results have been mixed. From a small base, non-
 OPEC developing countries'  sales to OPEC members rose at an av-
 erage annual rate of more than 30 percent during 1973 to 1976.
 Although this was substantially ahead of the growth rate for
 non-OPEC developing country exports to the rest of the world,
 it lagged behind the gains of industrial country exports to
 OPEC markets.
 In 1976, the gain in OPEC markets by the developing
 countries over the previous year dropped to an estimated 7
 percent. As a result, the group's share in world exports to
 OPEC declined to roughly 10 percent, compared with 13 percent
 in 19 73 .
 I     I The developing countries'  concentration on primary
 products--roughly two thirds of their total exports--has lim-
 ited their penetration of OPEC markets. Tropical foodstuffs
 and industrial raw materials are relatively unimportant compo-
 nents in OPEC members'  consumption patterns. Only a few devel-
 oping countries are sufficiently industrialized to take advan-
 tage of surging OPEC demand for machinery and equipment, build-
 ing materials, and sophisticated consumer products.
 I  Asia and Latin America accounted for more than four
 fifths of the shipments to OPEC last year. Developing coun-
 tries in Africa and the Middle East still have only a small
 share in the OPEC market.

 A few relatively advanced countries account for most
 o  the recent gains. India, Singapore, Brazil, South Korea,
 and Taiwan combine an array of industrial products with shrewd
 commercial practice to improve their market position.
 The outlook for 1977 is for continuing deterioration
 in the developing states' share of the OPEC market.  The indus-
 trial countries will continue to supply the bulk of imports
 required for OPEC development programs. Some of the more ag-
 gressive developing-country exporters of producer goods; and
 consumer durables probably will match the rise in world sales
 to OPEC customers; the poorer ones, however, will at best see
 sluggish advances.
 BELGIUM:  Shaky Government
 In what may prove a prelude to calling an early elec-
 tion,            a gian Prime Minister Tindemans has expelled one of the
 government's coalition partners and lost his parliamentary ma-
 jority. The Tindemans government has been on shaky ground for
 some months because of poor economic conditions and its. inabil-
 ity to produce a consensus on the plan to restructure the coun-
 try into autonomous linguistic communities.
 The coalition partner, the small Walloon Rally Party,
 yesterday refused to back the government in a vote on the
 budget. Last week, it had declared that it would quit the in-
 terparty talks on the regionalization of the country--and pos-
 sibly leave the coalition as well--unless a final decision fa-
 vorable to the French-speaking community were reached this
 weekend. This halted the talks because the opposition parties
 considered negotiations pointless until it is clear whether
 the government could continue in power.
 The Walloon party's action followed an announcement
 of various new economic measures--including higher taxes--which
 are opposed by most labor and business groups. The principal
 labor unions have scheduled a month-long series of 24-hour
 strikes to show their displeasure.

 I                   I In a speech on Monday,  leading party Secretary Stane
 Dolanc accused the West of overemphasizing human rights provi-
 sions in the Helsinki accords and of launching a campaign in
 support of the country's dissidents. He said Yugoslav dissi-
 dents are trying to exploit Western publicity to attack the
 Yugoslav system.
 I     I Dolanc said the regime will "ignore all these insig-
 nificant ventures" and will stick to its principles, especially
 by strengthening the leading role of the party. Perhaps in an
 effort to balance somewhat his criticism of the West, he also
 chided "dogmatic forces"--a reference to Moscow and its loyal-
 ist allies--that have taken a highly polemical attitude toward
 Yugoslavia's self-management system.
 I      I The US embassy reports that two signers of a December
 petition on freedom of travel have lost their jobs, and the au-
 thor of a magazine article harshly criticizing the Czechoslovak
 regime's handling of dissidents in Prague expects to lose his
 job in a purge of the magazine's staff. A recent issue of the
 party's official weekly Kommunist attacked the magazine for
 printing the article which conflicted with the "basic values
 and orientations of Yugoslav society."
 J The Yugoslav regime initially supported the Czecho-
 slovak dissenters implicitly, but Yugoslav media have since
 shifted to an incomplete and less sympathetic treatment of
 dissent elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
 Kommunist also criticized a bishop of the Serbian
 orthodox church who had attacked several leading Yugoslav Marx-
 ist theoreticians. The prelate was warned that "ideological"
 interventions are contrary to the constitutional role of relig-
 ious communities. Trials and imprisonment of outspoken nation-
 alists and members of emigre groups continue.

 I           IThe regime has not yet formulated a policy toward
 its   issi ents, and there are reports of disagreements within
 the leadership over how to deal with them. This indecision
 risks provoking more challenges to the regime's authority,
 which would further blot Yugoslavia's record before this sum-
 mer's preparatory meeting in Belgrade for the conference on
 European security this fall.
 I               While Dolanc--who seems to be a relative dove--may      25X1
 argue For less repressive measures than his colleagues in the
 military or security organs, it is doubtful that he or any
 other key figure will countenance active dissidence.
