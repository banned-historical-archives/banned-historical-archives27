 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE ODER-NEISSE ISSUE ON THE EVE OF THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE.  Page 1
 Statements by high East German and. Polish officials
 during recent weeks indicate that attempts are being made
 to avoid any appearance of friction over the Oder-Neisse
 frontier on the eve of the summit meeting..  The Soviet
 Union apparently prefers not to discuss at this time the ques-
 tion of  revising the Oder-Neisse line in favor of Germany.
 The USSR might play this trump card later when this   ight
 have a major effect on Germany's orientation.  0

 The American-South Korean economic talks scheduled
 to begin in Washington about 20 June are likely to be
 protracted and acrimonious.   President Rhee probably will
 revive his long-time economic grievances, and will use
 the opportunity to bid for a major share of Asian aid,
 an enlarged military establishment, a stop to the alleged
 American "build-up" of Japan, and an end to neutral nations'
 activity in Korea.
 CHINESE COMMUNISTS BESET BY  AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS .  .       Page 8
 The Chinese Communists are faced with new agricul-

 development and military modernization programs.   To counter
 this danger and to maintain exports of foodstuffs, the
 Peiping regime has been tightening control over food
 consumption in both rural and urban areas.   Some open unrest
 has reportedly resulted from these measureg.

 SOVIET LEADERS TIGHTEN IDEOLOGICAL REINS .  .               .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 11
 Since the Writers' Congress of December 1954, Soviet
 leaders have required greater conformity with the party
 position in ideological controversies, and have increas-
 ingly relied on doctrine to enforce discipline and inspire
 confidence.  The more militant ideological line is remi-
 niscent of the line pursued by Andrei Zhdanov from 1946
 to 1948.   The present leaders have also reinstated some
 of the men attacked by Zhdanov as imitators of the West
 and have argued for increased study of Western methods.
 The regime apparently does not wish to return at this
 time to the Stalin pattern of tyranny in ideology,
 enforced by purge and terror.

 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 THE SOVIET DELEGATION
 AT SAN FRANCISCO
 The Soviet delegation to
 the United Nations commemora-
 tive session at San Francisco
 is a lower-level group than
 attended the Berlin and Geneva
 conferences last year.  The
 purely cermonial, nonsub -
 stantive nature of the confer-
 ence probably influenced the
 composition of the delegation.
 The inclusion of N. T.
 Fedorenko and B. M. Volkov in
 the group suggests that the
 USSR may intend to make a for-
 eign.. policy move involving
 the Far East.  Fedorenko,
 second-ranking member of the
 delegation, is a deputy minis-
 ter                                  of foreign affairs and
 the former head of the Far
 East Division.  Volkov is the
 deputy head of the Southeast
 Asia Division.
 Molotov may choose the
 forum at San Francisco to press
 for an ultimate great-power
 meeting which would include
 Communist China.
 The Soviet delegation un-
 doubtedly will reiterate the
 USSR's demand for full UN
 membership for Peiping including
 the Security'Council seat now
 occupied by the Nationalist
 On 13 June TASS issued a
 statement supplementing the So-
 viet note agreeing to a Geneva
 conference on 18 July.  The
 statement contained a list of
 urgent international problems
 Chinese.  The Soviet repre-
 sentatives will also have an
 opportunity to negotiate with
 various Asian and Middle Eastern
 states which participated in the
 Bandung conference.
 The Chinese Communists, on
 their part, have suggested in
 their propaganda that Peiping
 would welcome an international
 conference--of five, six, ten
 or even more powers--to "relax
 tensions" in the Far East.
 Peiping has made unofficially a
 number of proposals for the Far
 East, similar to those expected
 from the USSR in the "summit
 conference."
 Peiping has indicated a
 desire to define. Far Eastern
 issues as including the banning
 of weapons of mass destruction,
 liquidation of SEATO and all
 other Western miliary pacts,
 withdrawal of foreign forces and
 disestablishment of foreign
 bases, normalization of rela-
 tions between all Asian govern-
 ments, universal membership in
 the UN.and "restoration of
 China's rightful place" in that
 body, and the development of
 trade and an end to economic
 restrictions and subversive
 activities.
 that might be considered as So-
 viet agenda proposals:   reduction
 of armaments and prohibition of
 atomic weapons, a European col-
 lective security system, Asian
 and Far East peace and security,

 This list of-possible

 European countries and the
 activities of international
 Communism had been raised by
 the United States in an attempt
 to divert attention from the
 urgent problems listed above.
 Moscow is making clear its
 categorical.refusa.1 to permit
 discussion of these two sub-
 jects at a conference.
 Ambassador Bohlen believes
 that the Soviet leaders are
 seriously concerned about the
 burdens and consequences of an
 all-out arms race.  He thinks
 there may now be a more serious
 basis for discussion of dis-
 armament than has existed in the
 past, although he doubts that
 Moscow is prepared to accept the
 controls and inspection neces-
 sary for a disarmament plan to
 work.
 The European security plan
 expected to be put forth by the
 USSR will probably be accom
 panied by some of the elements
 of Malik's 10' May proposal for
 elimination of foreign bases
 and the evacuation of troops
 from foreign countries, partic-
 ularly Germany.
 The i1SSR may propose that
 Far Eastern quetions be dis-
 cussed at a later conference,,
 to be attended by representatives
 of the Big Four and Communist
 China, and perhaps'by other
 countries.
 The exclusion of German
 unification from lists of press-
 ing issues adds to the evi-
 dence that Moscow wants to
 postpone discussion of that
 question and perhaps transfer
 it to an East-West German con-
 ference table.  The invitation
 t6 West German chancellor
 Adenauer pointed in the same
 direction,
 Soviet officials, however,
 have been dronnine hints to
 apparently intended to create
 the impression that the USSR is
 ready to abandon East Germany
 and agree to German unification.
 Deputy Foreign Minister
 Semenov said that West Germany
 should be able to dominate a
 united Germany if it follows a
 policy of peace.  Another So-
 viet official contradicted East
 German party leader Ulbricht's
 statement that a united Germany
 could not overlook the achieve-
 ments in the eastern zone,
 saying that no one could foresee
 the results' of all-German elec-
 tions.
 American officials in
 Frankfurt see the possibility
 that the Communist extremists
 in East Germany may be. in dis-
 favor with Moscow, and that the
 Kremlin might seek to reduce
 the unpopularity of the regime
 by promoting a popular front
 policy.   It is at least apparent
 that Moscow has been treating
 its East German puppets publicly
 in a'cavalier fashion and that
 they are uncertain'of Soviet
 intentions.
 The unpopularity of the
 East German regime seriously
 reduces the USSR's flexibility
 on the German issue-and provides
 a strong motivation for trying
 to avoid discussion of the unity

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Soviet-Japanese Negotiations
 At the first substantive
 meeting on 7 June between the
 Japanese and Soviet negotiators
 in London, the Japanese proposed
 that outstanding issues be set-
 tled prior to the establishment
 of diplomatic relations.
 The Japanese advanced the
 following topics for discussion:
 the repatriation of Japanese
 held by the USSR, territorial
 rights over the Habomai and
 Shikotan Islands, the status
 of the Kurils and South Sakhalin,
 fishing rights, and Japan's ad-
 mission to the United Nations.
 Matsumoto also made it
 clear that the negotiations
 must not affect Japan's obli-
 gations. under the San Francisco
 treaty and the United States
 security  treaty.
 On 14 June, according to
 press reports from Japan, the
 Soviet negotiators responded
 to Japan's proposals by out-
 lining Moscow's position for
 concluding a peace treaty. Ac-
 cording to these reports, Soviet
 delegate Malik took the position
 that the repatriation of Jap-
 anese in USSR territory had
 already been settled, and that
 war criminals would be re-
 turned on completion of their
 terms; that Shikotan and the
 Habomai Islands were part of
 the Kurils and Moscow did not
 intend to return theta to Japan;
 and that the USSR demands the
 right of free navigation for its
 warships in the straits ad-
 jacent to Japan.
 The Soviet position, in
 the opinion of the Japanese
 press, indicated that the USSR
 will use the Soviet-sponsored
 amendments to the San Francisco
 peace treaty as the basis for
 the London begotiations.
 The Soviet treaty amend-
 ments, Which would have a major
 effect on Japan's present in=
 ternational obligations, called
 for a limitation on Japanese
 rearmament, withdrawal of all
 foreign troops, barred Japan
 from entering any coalitions or
 military alliandes, directed
 against participants in World
 War II, and barred atomic and
 nuclear weapons..   In addition,
 the Soviet amendments required
 Japan to recognize Soviet sov-
 ereignty over South Sakhalin
 and the Kurils and Chinese Com-
 munist hegemony over Manchuria
 and Formosa.
 These implied demands would
 strike at Japan's security treaty
 with the United States, and ac-
 cording to the announced position
 of the Japanese government, would
 be unacceptable to Japan.
 The Soviet stand probably
 is an initial bargaining position,
 designed to counter Japan's
 original proposals which repre-
 sented maximum demands.
 The negotiations are still
 in the initial stage, and the
 fact that the negotiators agreed
 not to meet again for a week
 further confirms that their posi-
 tions are relatively far apart.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 June l95~
 Present British Position
 ~n        a Question
 From a recent revision of
 the Foreign Office policy paper
 on Formosa and from the atti-
 tude adopted toward Krishna
 Menon's mediation efforts, it
 is evident that Britain con-
 siders its appropriate role in
 the Formosa dispute to be still
 that of honest broker among the
 principal parties.
 London seems to think that
 any change in the present sit-
 uation is most likely to be for
 the worse; its apparent policy
 therefore continues to be that
 of encouraging inaction.
 Foreign Secretary Macmillan
 has encouraged India's chief
 UN delegate Krishna Menon~in
 his effort to secure a '"relax-
 ation of tensions" in the For-
 mosa area.  The Foreign Office
 has informed the American em-
 bassy in London that it be-
 lieves Menon, whom Macmillan
 has characterized as "Nehru's
 Harry Hopkins," to be a genu-
 ine "force for peace" and to be
 a spokesman for a large sector
 of Asian opinion.
 London, however, evidently
 does not believe Menon has re-
 ceived any real concession from
 Peiping,  or that Menon himself
 has any very clear proposal for
 possible negotiations between
 Peiping and Washington.
 The Foreign Office thinks
 that formal negotiations should
 be avoided for the indefinite
 future,  since neither side
 appears prepared to retreat
 substantially from its present
 position.   In the Foreign Of-
 fice view, Peiping would at
 present be satisfied with noth-
 ing less than the elimination
 of Western power and influence
 in East Asia.
 The British believe that
 Chinese Nationalist evacuation
 of the offshore islands remains
 the . key. factor in obtaining an
 indefinite de facto cease-fire.
 They hope that evacuation can
 be arranged soon, during the
 present "temporary lull."
 Over the long term, the
 Foreign Office's revised policy
 paper recommends a "China-For-
 mosa" solution rather than a
 "two-China" solution, and in-
 dicates willingness to support
 Peiping's eventual accession
 to China's present seat in the
 UN.  Britain would wish For-
 mosa to gain a seat of its own
 independently of Peiping, per-
 haps through some sort of
 "package deal."
 In general, London offi-
 cials consider that Formosa's
 future independence depends on
 whether it can become politi-
 cally and economically "viable."
 London has shown some interest
 in the suggestion that during
 his lifetime, Chiang should be
 supported as Formosan head of
 state by the UN or other inter-
 national guarantors of the pro-
 posed cease-fire.
 Both the Chinese Communists
 and the Chinese Nationalists
 have repeatedly denounced com-
 promise proposals of this type.
 The Nationalists can be ex-
 pected to remain bitterly op-
 posed to any further weakening
 of their international position,
 but the Peiping regime might
 well modify its present line
 to accommodate to the-British
 view.
 Peiping could see such
 British proposals as an op-
 portunity to make early po-
 litical and economic gains,
 with a prospect of eventuall
 annexing Formosa.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Yugoslav Policy in the Balkans
 Since the Soviet visit to
 Belgrade, there have been vari-
 ous reports that a meeting of
 high-level Yugoslavs and Bul-
 garians, possibly the heads of
 state, is to take place.
 These reports are sup-
 ported by Orbit propaganda on
 the Soviet-Yugoslav communique,
 a statement. by a Yugoslav of-
 ficial that he expected Yugo-
 slav-Bulgarian relations to be
 the first to improve in the
 wake of the Soviet visit, and
 an official Yugoslav report
 that the USSR had raised the
 question of Bulgaria's admis-
 sion into the Balkan pact.
 Such a meeting would
 bring Yugoslavia's postwar
 pretensions to hegemony in the
 Balkans back into the lime-
 light.
 The Yugoslavs  hailed the
 treaty of alliance with Bul-
 garia, signed in August 1947,
 as the first formal step to-
 ward federation.                                                                              Although the
 Bulgarians never carried
 through with their supposed
 willingness to cede Pirin Mace-
 donia, they did allow Yugo-
 slavia to establish its own
 schools in that region.
 Following the break in
 1948, all such arrangements
 were discontinued and little
 has been heard about a federa-
 tion and a greater Macedonia
 since the end of the Greek
 civil war in 1949.  Yugoslavia's
 alliance with Greece and Turkey
 has somewhat limited Belgrade's
 freedom of action, particularly
 since Greece holds a part (Aegpan
 Macedonia) of what has tradi-
 tionally been considered "Mace-
 donia."
 While the subject has
 been almost completely buried
 since the Tito-Cominform break
 in June 1948, a Balkan federa-
 tion was one of Tito's prin-
 cipal objectives after World
 War II.
 As early as November 1944,
 Yugoslav vice president Kardelj
 proposed in Sofia that the
 Bulgarian Communist Party ap-
 prove a plan to cede Pirin
 (Bulgarian) Macedonia to the
 Yugoslav Macedonian Republic
 and that Bulgaria itself be-
 come the seventh republic in
 a South Slav federation along
 with the six Yugoslav repub-
 lics.
 Bulgarian and Soviet lead-
 ers favored the concept of a
 federation, but the Bulgarians
 feared possible subordination
 to Tito, and countered with a
 proposal that the two coun-
 tries form a union with power
 equally' distributed.
 Because of the Balkan
 pact and the changed European
 situation, Belgrade probably
 has no desire to revive pub-
 licly any proposals for a Bal-
 kan federation similar to what
 it envisioned before the break,
 but it may have more immediate
 thoughts about the possibilities
 of enlarging the Balkan pact
 to include Bulgaria and pos-
 sibly Albania.
 Actually, all three pact
 nations generally agreed that
 the clause in the pact allow-
 ing for the accession of other
 countries in the future could
 apply to the present Soviet
 Satellites.   In fact both
 Yugoslavia and Greece originally
 hoped the pact would eventually
 be expanded into an associa-
 tion of Balkan states.
 Yugoslavia is undoubtedly
 more optimistic about the pros-
 pects for freedom in Bulgaria

 than are Greece and
 Turkey, and it might
 consider high-level
 talks with Sofia
 useful as a means of
 determining whether:
 the USSR is willing
 to allow the Satel-
 lites real freedom.
 Belgrade's view is
 probably colored by
 a wish to have Bul-
 garia in the pact so
 that Yugoslavia's
 independent status
 and socialist theo-
 ries could serve to
 weaken Sofia's ties
 to Moscow.
 The Yugoslavs
 would present Bul-
 garian participation
 in the pact to the
 West as a realistic
 way of fathoming So-
 viet intentions to-
 ward the Satellites,
 which Belgrade has
 long said would be
 the key test of basic
 change in Soviet
 policy.
 At present there
 are no signs that
 the Soviet Union
 would be willing to grant Bul-
 garia the necessary freedom to
 make it acceptable as a member
 of the Balkan pact.  Neverthe-
 lesp,discussions may be held
 regarding Bulgaria's role in
 any future Balkan arrangements.
 There-has been a rumor
 that Bulgaria might again be
 willing to consider the cession
 of Pirin Macedonia to Yugoslavia.
 Such a specific proposal seems
 improbable at this time.   Even
 if it were,made, the Yugoslavs

 It seems more probable
 that the Bulgarians might be
 willing to grant a number of
 concessions in respect to Pirin
 Macedonia, short of outright
 cession of territory, such as
 the establishment of cultural

 East Germany on the Anniversary
 0  the June uprising
 On the anniversary of the
 uprising of 17 June 1953, oppo-
 sition to the regime is wide-
 spread in East Germany but there
 is little active resistance.
 The popular mood is one. of
 irritation.
 Food shortages, increased
 work norms, and the prospect of
 obligatory service in the armed
 forces have given rise to work
 stoppages and illegal meetings
 in widely separated industrial
 establishments this spring.
 Repeated East German denuncia-
 tions of the "Western espio-
 nage centers" in West Berlin,
 current spy trials and harass-
 ing measures have increased
 tension in the Berlin area.
 Recent international devel-
 opments have probably raised
 hope among the East Germans con-
 cerning the prospects for unity
 and the withdrawal of the Rus-
 sians.                                     Any such optimism, how-
 ever, will probably be tempered
 by their memory of the failure
 of the Berlin conference in the
 spring of 1954.
 An indication of the tem-
 per of the populace is the -in-
 crease in the flow of male refu-

 Top Soviet Leaders
 The Soviet delegation to

 atives-on  the scene.  Yugoslav
 officials were reported contemp-
 tuous of the Soviet leaders fol-
 lowing the visit.
 curred in March at Greifswald
 University.
 The unrest among railroad
 workers cause.d,by the sudden
 introduction of a new work
 schedule in April apparently
 has continued.
 The regime is stepping up
 security precautions and cur-
 tailing contacts between East
 Germans and the West.   It is
 avoiding measures which might
 provoke the population, and has
 been exceedingly cautious in
 putting into effect the higher
 work norms announced by First
 Secretary Walter Ulbricht on
 15 April.
 Although shortages of
 essential foods, particularly
 fats, continue, the appearance
 of vegetables and grains from
 the 1955 crops in the next six
 weeks may alleviate the situation.
 Despite the population's
 unrest this spring, another up-
 rising'by East German workers
 similar to that of June 1953 is
 unlikely.   The regime's repres-
 sive measures at that time are
 still fresh in the memory of
 East Germans, who also are
 acutely aware that Soviet ar-
 mies, numbering 400,000, are in
 a position to crush any insur-
 rectionary moves  as they did
 two years ago.
 The British embassy in
 Belgrade reported that the
 Yugoslavs had a strong feel-
 ing that the Soviet delegation
 was composed of "uncouth second-
 raters," and that Tito stood
 head and shoulders above any of
 the Soviet representatives.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 June 1955
 The         Yugoslavs were also said
 to be dismayed  by the con-
 tinued inflexibility and
 Stalinist cast of Soviet think-
 ing.
 believe that  neither Khrush-
 chev                            nor Bulganin  displayed
 qualities of leadership in
 Belgrade.
 Soviet visit caused the
 Yugoslavs to realize how much
 they had grown in intellectual
 stature and  broad-mindedness
 since the 1948  break and how
 deep the gulf had  become be-
 tween the two                                  parties in
 their thinking, knowledge of
 the world,and manners.
 Khrushchev,   he said,
 looked like one of those
 " hornyhanded . miners who
 receives a gold watch from
 his pals and boss following
 30 years of toil,   while
 Bulganin looked  like a petty
 bureaucrat of  tsarist days.
 These men, he said,   "are
 not the heirs of Stalin,
 they  are the legacy."
 Ambassador Bohlen has
 commented,   following at-
 tendance at the Soviet re-
 ception for Nehru, that the
 more the top Soviet leaders
 are seen, the less impres-
 sive they become.    Bohlen
 feels that, with the ex-
 ception of Malenkov, who
 gives the impression of
 ,superior quality even in
 eclipse, and Molotov, who
 perhaps because of his ex-
 perience gives the impres-
 sion of greater dignity and
 capability,   there is not
 one of the present presid-
 ium  members vo appears
 to have outst,ding per-
 sonal qualitj..,~;:.:                                                                           or abilities.
 The unfavorable reaction
 produced by the Soviet leaders
 in Belgrade was probably due
 partly to the uninhibited,
 headlong style in which Khrush-
 chev pl.yed his new role. It
 provided a sharp contrast to
 the calculated reserve of    -
 Stalin, who kept himself from
 close scrutiny.
 Khrushchev undoubtedly
 displayed diplomatic inepti-
 tude at Belgrade, but this
 quality is not likely to cause
 his decline,. His position will
 probably be ' little?affected by
 the Belgrade performance.
 It would be equally unsafe
 to conclude that, since individ-
 ua.l . Soviet leaders may lack pol-
 ish'and do not always fit'the
 Western picture of skillful lead-
 ership, Soviet policy is in in-
 competent hands.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE MEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 June 1955
 No affirmative reaction has
 been reported from the other
 countries which were invited.
 The leader of the 12-man
 Indian parliamentary delega-
 tion which toured the Soviet
 Union and Yugoslavia said on
 his return to New Delhi on 13
 June that "the desire of the
 USSR for peace seems genuine
 and sincere."
 The USSR probably hoped
 when it set up this program
 that members of the Supreme
 Soviet could give  just this
 impression  to members of
 other parliaments, under-
 cover of friendly                                                                               discussion
 of common  legislative  prob-
 lems.  This may have appeared
 to be a more direct means
 than the usual  appeal to
 "peace-loving people" to bring
 pressure  on Western  govern-
 ments  against co-operating
 with American  foreign policies.
 The government's campaign
 against the remaining Hoa Hao
 rebels and remnants of the
 Binh Xuyen continues as an an-
 tiguerrilla operation; an of-
 fensive against Ba Cut's 3,300-
 man force may be imminent.
 Diem, meanwhile, has an-
 nounced his willingness to en-
 gage in talks with the Viet
 Minh regarding elections, but
 he reportedly will insist that
 only a future national assembly
 could commit the government to
 participate in country-wide
 elections.
 Ba Cut and General Soai
 have been declared outlaws and
 their property ordered seized.
 The government hopes that con-
 tinued military pressure will
 induce most of the Hoa Hao
 troops to turn themselves in.
 Four understrength battalions
 of General Soai have reportedly
 already done so.
 Should the army press an
 attack on Ba Cut's men, as is re-
 ported likely, Ba Cut  may  move
 his troops into Cambodia where
 they would create problems for
 the Cambodian security forces.
 The Hoa Hao rebels, however,
 could not long maintain them-
 selves as a unit in a hostile
 .countryside.
 According to one report,
 some 200 Viet Minh officers and
 noncoms have joined Binh Xuyen
 remnants southeast of Saigon.
 A Viet Minh-Binh Xuyen tie-up
 would make the government's
 security operations more diffi-
 cult but there are not believed
 to be any large number of Viet
 Minh personnel in or near the
 area to which the Binh Xuyen
 has retreated.
 Meanwhile, Diem has an-
 nounced his willingness to en-
 ter into talks with the Viet
 Minh on the subject of elections.
 In entering such talks, Diem's
 motive would be to undercut
 Viet Minh charges of Geneva
 violations.
 A government spokesman
 has said that South Vietnam
 would not commit itself to par-
 ticipate in elections without
 elaborate guarantees of free
 voting and the results of any
 preliminary discussions would
 have to be submitted for ap-
 proval to a future national
 assembly.

 portedly try to get

 pare for the elections as "the

 the conference must open "ex-

 by the Geneva agreement."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 June 1955
 Cambodia and Laos
 The International Control
 Commission in Cambodia has de-
 termined, by a two-to-one vote,
 that the recently concluded
 American-Cambodian military aid
 agreement is in conflict with
 the Geneva agreement.
 In general terms, the
 Indian and Polish members of
 the commission have interpreted
 certain passages in the bilat-
 eral agreement as implying a
 military alliance aligning
 Cambodia with the Western bloc.
 The commission plans
 further discussions to establish
 more clearly these alleged con-
 traventions of the Geneva terms
 and to decide on a course of
 action.
 The Canadian member, who
 has argued strongly in the mi-
 nority, plans to insist that
 nothing more is required than
 an interpretive statement from
 the Cambodian government.  Other
 possible steps, for which the
 Polish delegate is expected to
 argue strongly, are a protest
 to the Cambodian government and
 a formal report of violation to
 the Geneva powers, or a request
 for formal amendment of the mili-
 tary aid agreement.
 han-Pakistani Dispute
 Ithe Afghan-Pakistani dis-
 pute is deadlocked.
 Afghanistan refuses to ac-
 cede to Pakistan's demand that
 the Afghan foreign minister be
 present at the flag-raising cere-
 mony in Kabul--presumably to
 The Indian chairman as
 usual holds the key to the com-
 mission's final decision.
 The Cambodian government,
 particularly sensitive to foreign
 criticism, can be expected to
 view any protest from the com-
 mission as another instance of
 unwarranted meddling in its in-
 ternal affairs.
 In Laos, the assembly and
 the royal council voted almost
 unanimously to postpone the na-
 tional elections, previously
 scheduled for August, to 25 De-
 cember.
 This postponement provides
 both the royal government and
 the Pathet Lao with additional
 time in which to prepare for the
 elections, and the advantages
 to either side appear in this
 respect about equal.  However,
 there will also be additional
 time for Premier Katay, en-
 couraged by the International
 Control Commission, to pursue
 negotiations for a political
 settlement with the Pathet Lao--
 negotiations which are unlikely
 to prove conclusive except
 through dangerous compromise on
 the part of the royal government.

 Elections for Constituent
 Assembly in Pakistan
 Intense political maneuver-
 ing in Pakistan over the new
 constituent assembly to be
 elected on 21 June is weakening
 the position of the government.
 Although Governor General Ghu-
 lam Mohammad may be able to
 control the new assembly, fac-
 tionalism at both national and
 provincial levels makes un-
 likely its development as a
 stable governing body.
 Breakdown of this latest
 attempt to achieve constitu-

 that Moscow can effectively

 ation efforts, Turkey, Iraq,
 Egypt, and Iran may step in, and
 seek a solution.  The majority
 of these countries would be in-
 clined to put more pressure on
 Afghanistan than on Pakistan.
 The Afghan government.ap-
 parently does not yet feel the
 necessity of giving in.   It may
 do so in the near future, if
 popular opposition is aroused
 by economic shortages, layoffs
 of personnel, and the restive-
 ness of military conscripts.
 Even if the situation re-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 June 1955
 Of the 40 West Pakistani
 seats, 30 are to be elected
 from the Punjab, Sind, and the
 Northwest Frontier Province.
 These 30 seats will probably
 be under the governor general's
 control.   The other 10 seats
 which represent minor states
 and territories are to be
 elected by the assembly itself
 after it convenes.: These and
 10 East Pakistani seats, re-
 ported in the hands of leftist
 Awami League leader Maulana
 Bashani, are a potential bal-
 ance of power in the assembly.
 Absence in Europe of Gov-
 ernor General Ghulam Mohammad
 and H. S. Suhrawardy, his
 political ally, is undoubtedly
 handicapping the governor gener-
 al's  supporters. Ghulam Mo-
 hammad is the only political
 Iranian Prime Minister
 May Be Replaced
 The ineffectual Iranian
 government of Prime Minister
 Ala, which came into power on
 7 April, appears to be drifting.
 The government has made almost
 no progress in implementing its
 much-touted reform programs
 and its lack of direction has
 created a growing feeling among
 Iranian politicians that Ala
 may be replaced in the near
 future.
 The prime minister, who is
 loyal and subservient to the
 Shah, returned on 12 June after
 two months' absence for medical
 treatment and convalescence.
 Ala's protracted absence from
 Iran gave wide currency to
 reports that he intended to re-
 sign.   His return and his
 formal denial of the rumors are
 not likely to change the picture.
 There is growing opposi-
 tion to the government and the
 figure in Pakistan with suf-
 ficient acumen and authority
 to resolve another crisis.
 Interior Minister Iskander
 Mirza, staunchest supporter of
 the governor general, has ex-
 pressed his concern over the
 situation by stating that when
 the assembly convenes, the gov-
 ernment is going to be in "a
 hell of a mess."
 Although an open clash
 may not come immediately, the
 Huq-Ali group and the governor
 general's supporters in the as-
 sembly may be so evenly matched
 as to make effective government
 impossible.   In this case, the
 governor general may resolve
 the  situation by using his
 emergency powers again.
 Shah in the Majlis and the vot-
 ing there is becoming progres-
 sively less favorable on govern-
 ment-sponsored bills.
 An  antigovernment coali-
 tion reportedly will soon be
 formed including Majlis deputies
 and senators, dissident army
 factions, remnants of the Na-
 tional Resistance Movement, and
 discharged government employees.
 American charge Rountree
 says the cabinet ministers re-
 maining in Tehran are trying to
 carry out their responsibilities,
 but even they are getting dis-
 couraged.
 Majlis deputy Jehangir

 the Shah recently to dis-
 solve the Majlis on the_grounds
 that it was obstructing his so-
 cial program.   The Shah later
 said he would not hesitate to

 co-operate.
 The Majlis represents for
 the most part the landlords,
 and these, with the army, have
 traditionally been the monarch's
 only firm support.
 The progressive elements,
 comprising for the most part
 the National Resistance Move-
 ment, bitterly oppose the Shah
 and his government.  The Re-
 sistance Movement itself is
 disunited because of a struggle
 between the xenophobic extrem-
 ists and the moderates who are
 seeking to reorient the movement
 toward the West.  The Shah's
 policies have tended to weaken
 these moderates.
 American  officials in
 .Tehran  see no indication that
 the Shah  has altered his in-
 tention to retain most of the
 responsibility for the  di-
 rection of the government,and
 they  expect  continued weak-
 ness in the government                                                                             and
 increasing political difficul-
 ties.
 A prediction made in
 April    that the Shah's mis-
 rule would last                                                                                   only three
 months probably  represents
 a consensus, of the  Mai l is .
 A former official of the
 Zahedi government   also stated
 that "the Shah is   heading
 for real trouble."
 Israeli-Egyptian Border
 Prospects for high-level
 talks between Egypt and Israel an
 conditions along the border of the..
 Gaza strip have dimmed, but the
 atmosphere is somewhat less tense.
 Israel is continuing mili-
 tary activities in the area,pre-
 sumably seeking by a demonstration
 of strength to impress Egypt and
 the West with the necessity of
 high-level talks.
 Cairo's note to the United
 Nations on 10 June accepted, the
 proposal for talks, but restrict
 ed the agenda to the four points
 suggested by General Burns, the
 United Nations truce supervi-
 sor,and to Prime Minister Nasr'e
 suggestion for some kind of
 "no man's land" in the area.
 Cairo has also made it clear
 that it will not appoint a gener-
 al                                 officer to represent it in
 the talks, as requested by the
 Israelis. Nor is Nasr willing
 to give a written asurance that
 his representative, Colonel
 Gohar, will have power to com-
 mit the Egyptian government.
 These developments have
 led Israeli prime  minister
 Sharett to  conclude  that the
 project  has "fizzled out."
 Activity on the diploma-
 tic level is likely to con-
 tinue, however, for the im-
 mediate future.  Ambassador
 Lawson in Tel Aviv feels that
 the apparent improvement  in
 Cairo's control over its bor-
 der forces  will, if maintained,
 make  it more difficult for
 Israeli "activists" to justi-
 fy the necessity of large-
 scale military action.
 Lawson believes  that
 a quiet  border  is to the
 interest of the  major Israeli
 coalition  parties  during the
 present  election campaign,
 scheduled to end 26 July.
 The absence of incidents
 would help the  parties a-
 gainst  any extremist charges
 that the  government  is
 unable to defend  Israel's
 border "pioneers" against
 the Arabs.

 rebuffs of Communist overtures
 by the Socialist Party leader-

 One half of the 320-member

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE ODER-NEISSE ISSUE ON THE EVE OF THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Statements by high East
 German and Polish officials
 during recent weeks indicate
 that attempts are being made to
 avoid any appearance of
 friction over the Oder-Neisse
 frontier on the eve of the sum-
 mit meeting.   The USSR appar-
 ently prefers not to discuss
 the question now and has no im-
 mediate intention of reversing
 its consistent position that
 the frontier is permanent,
 Eventual revision of the
 frontier in favor of Germany is
 Moscow's trump card, which it
 can play most effectively in
 future direct dealings with the
 Germans.  No offer to revise the
 frontier is likely until it
 could be expected to have a
 major effect on Germany's orien-
 tation.
 Walter Ulbricht, first sec-
 retary of the Socialist Unity
 Party, warned on 1
 June that anyone who
 raises the issue in
 connection with ne-
 gotiations on Germany
 "only proves that he
 is looking for a pre-
 text to prevent re-
 unification."
 In Poland, high-
 level spokesmen have
 laid unusual stress
 in recent weeks on
 the definitive char-
 acter of Poland's
 possession of its
 western territories.     3~'?
 Premier Cyrankiewicz
 made this point in
 his address on 11 May
 to the Warsaw con-
 Terence which set up
 the Soviet-Satellite
 joint command.  He
 underscored the role
 of the common frontier
 Poland with East Germany.
 Moreover, the Warsaw pact
 signed on 14 May pledged all
 signatories to take the meas-
 ures necessary to "guarantee

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 June 1955
 The Soviet position fur-
 nished the basis for the East
 German.-Polish treaty signed 6
 June 1950 recognizing the Oder-
 Neisse line as final and the
 agreement of 6 July 1950 pro-
 viding for demarcation of the
 frontier.
 Soviet and Polish spokes-
 men have argued that concessions
 made by the Western leaders at
 Yalta and Potsdam constitute de
 facto acceptance of the Oder-
 Neisse settlement.
 Polish authorities moved
 into the "Regained Territories"
 in the wake of the Soviet armies.
 They immediately took advantage
 of the authorization in the
 'Yalta and Potsdam agreements
 to deport Germans and con-
 currently instituted a drive
 to attract Polish settlers into
 the borderlands.
 Approximately 6,500,000
 Germans. were deported or left
 the territories under their own
 volition.
 They were replaced during
 the first five years after the
 war by approximately 5,000,000
 Poles, including some 1,500,000
 emigrants from territories an-
 nexed by the Soviet Union.
 The present population of
 the regained provinces is pre-
 dominantly Polish.  There are
 approximately 125,000 ethnic
 Germans in the area.
 The acquisition of-the
 "Regained Territories" increased
 Poland's industrial and agri-
 cultural production potential
 significantly.  The possession
 of the Oder  River waterway with
 its key port of Szczecin (Stet-
 tin), added to Gdansk (Danzig)
 and the existing Polish port
 of Gdynia, vastly augmented
 the country's foreign trade
 facilities.
 Balanced against these
 gains, the seizure of the former
 German territories saddled Po-
 land with a permanent source
 of friction with Germany.  The
 Germans have never reconciled
 themselves to the loss of 22
 percent of prewar German ter-
 ritory--26 percent of prewar
 Germany's agricultural land--
 and the displacement of Germans
 from historically German ter-
 ritory.  There has been re-
 current evidence that many East
 German party members have also
 questioned the wisdom of the
 settlement.
 East German and Polish
 leaders have sought to play
 down latent friction by repeated
 statements lauding. the "fra-
 ternal" relations of the two
 countries.  Co-operation,
 nevertheless, remains somewhat
 limited.
 The usual inter-Satellite
 agreements calling for economic,
 technical and cultural co-
 operation have been signed. East
 Germany reportedly has been as-
 signed dock space at Sczcecin
 and plans to make large invest-
 ments to develop facilities in
 the port.  A special agreement
 was signed last autumn under
 which Polish and East German
 barges would be used interchange-
 ably on the canal systems of the
 two countries.
 The two countries
 are committed to mutual assist-
 ance by the Warsaw pact.
 Prospects for the Future
 The Poles have frequently
 shown signs of believing that
 the USSR would one day find it
 expedient to return all or part
 of the territory to Germany.
 They have hesitated to
 move into the western borderlands

 praised their Soviet allies for
 assistance in "regaining"

 Polish officials
 and journalists visiting East
 Germany have displayed a "cer-

 of the settlement.
 Under certain conditions
 Soviet leaders might revive
 Western suggestions made at
 the 1947 Moscow conference, that
 agricultural areas in the Pol-
 ish western borderlands be re-

 ited offer, however, would not
 have much impact.
 Western Germans in par-
 ticular would probably be
 skeptical of any offer which
 did not include substantial
 portions of the Upper Silesian
 industrial area.  The USSR
 might, nevertheless, take this
 course at some future date in
 order to achieve some specific
 important goal in Germany.
 A Soviet move to return
 substantial portions of the
 "Regained Territories'tto Ger-
 many would awaken violent anti-
 Soviet sentiments among the
 Poles and deal-a severe blow to
 Such a change in Poland
 would have repercussions in
 Czechoslovakia, where a similar
 latent fear has existed that the
 Soviet Union would eventually
 sacrifice the Czechs in order
 to gain advantages from the
 Germans.
 For these reasons, the
 Soviet Union probably will not
 raise the Oder-Neisse question
 at the Big Four conference.
 If the issue arises, the
 USSR is likely to fall back on
 the bilateral agreement signed
 by the Polish and the East Ger-
 man governments in 1950, and
 may revive Molotov's argument
 at the 1947 Moscow conference
 that these territories belong
 to Poland by right and not in
 compensation for the lost East-
 ern territories.  The USSR
 presumably would also contend
 that the Western allies, by
 assenting to the transfer of
 populatfons,agreed de facto to
 the present frontiers.

 AMERICAN-SOUTH KOREAN TALKS
 The American-South Korean

 President Rhee probably

 will. not readily retreat.   In
 order to prepare both domestic
 and foreign opinion, he is re-

 attacking the United States
 and Japan in his controlled
 press, organizing "spontaneous"
 demonstrations, and falsely
 attributing "promises" to
 American officials.  He is re-

 ington, New York and Tokyo to
 "promulgate widely" his ob-
 jectives.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 June '1955
 Economic issues, such as
 the adoption of a realistic
 exchange rate, adequate pric-
 ing of imported aid goods,
 budgetary and tax reforms, and
 the proper use of Korea's own
 foreign exchange, may con-
 stitute the crux of the talks.
 According to American aid
 officials, failure of South
 Korea to co-operate on these
 issues cost Seoul revenue
 equivalent to its entire budg-
 et deficit--the primary
 cause of inflation.
 .The perennial exchange
 rate controversy will be.one
 of the most difficult issues to
 settle.  Rhee maintains a
 theory, which has become an
 obsession with him, that
 changes in the exchange rate
 cause inflation, rather than
 reflect it.  He has already
 attempted to fix his position
 by publicly implying that the
 United States has agreed to a
 permanent rate effective 1
 July.
 Rhee told Ambassador
 Lacy on 7 June that he wanted
 a fixed rate for six months,
 believing that this period
 would permit him to prove that
 a fixed rate would reduce in-
 flationary pressures.  He
 probably contemplates extreme
 measures, if necessary, to
 prove his point.
 He also said that the
 actualrate was not important,
 so long as it is permanent.
 ou    Korea w
 seek a rate of 300 or 350 hwan
 per dollar, against a realis-
 tic rate of about 600 to 1.
 South Korea will probably be
 reluctant to value the hwan
 below that of the Japanese yen,
 currently 360 to 1.
 Even if a realistic rate
 could be agreed on, the con-
 tinuing inflation would make
 such a pegged rate pro-
 gressively more costly for the
 United States.  Aid goods
 would be underpriced, thus
 minimizing their counter-
 inflationary effect, black
 markets would be stimulated,
 and favorites would get wind-
 fall profits.
 South Korea  reportedly
 will also press for unilateral
 control of 60 percent of the
 hwan counterpart funds, which
 are now under joint American-
 South Korean administration.
 This would permit diversion
 of the funds to finance un-
 economical projects, designed
 for prestige purposes, which
 have been blocked:in the past
 by American administrators.
 Such funds also would be use-
 ful to Rhee's Liberal Party
 in the 1956 presidential
 elections.
 South Korea considers
 questions of currency stabili.
 zation inseparable from the
 general question of the level
 of American military and eco-
 nomic aid.
 Reports indicate that
 Rhee plans to demand a mini-
 mum economic-military aid
 program of $900,000,000 for
 fiscal 1956--of which at
 least $350,000,000 would be
 economic aid.  This total
 represents an increase of
 $200,000,000 over the 1955
 program.
 Rhee is already charging,
 through the controlled South
 Korean press, that his mili-
 tary establishment is inade-
 quato,and he will probably
 demand that the United States
 increase South Korea's mili-
 tary strength.  This demand
 would ignore the peacetime
 manpower problem of main-
 taining even the present
 650,000-man army, which
 necessitates a 10-year term
 of service for all eligible
 males.
 Rhee's military demands
 reflect a genuine concern
 over the Communist armed
 threat as well as his primary
 objective of unifying Korea,

 which he believes can be done
 only by military force.  By
 maintaining the largest non-
 Communist army in the world
 except for the United States,
 Rhee would be in a position to
 exploit any opportunity to
 achieve this objective.   It
 would also enable him to keep
 the United States' stake in
 Korea high and aid him in his
 attempts to exert a dispro-
 portionate influence on Far
 Eastern affairs.
 The negotiations give
 promise of being a repetition
 .of last summer's talks, when
 Rhee delayed implementation of
 the aid program for four months
 while repeatedly misrepresent-
 ing and abusing American motives
 and intentions.

 CHINESE COMMUNISTS BESET BY AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS
 The Chinese Communists are
 faced with new agricultural set-
 backs which threaten their in-
 dustrial development and mili-
 tary modernization programs.
 To counter these threats and to
 maintain exports of foodstuffs,
 the Peiping regime has been
 tightening controls over food
 consumption in both rural and
 urban areas.   Some open unrest
 has reportedly resulted from
 these measures.
 The production outlook for
 the early crops being harvested
 this month in most of China is
 poor, but the harvest will re-
 lieve somewhat the starvation
 in certain localities and the
 general food shortage.
 The crops sown last winter,
 which are about to be harvested,
 normally constitute about 30
 percent of China's annual food
 output.  They have been hit by
 a series of disasters--planting
 problems as a result of un-
 drained land, other afteref-
 fects of last summer's disas-
 trous floods, a severe winter,
 and drought this spring which
 has affected all of China ex-
 cept Manchuria and the Yangtze
 valley.
 The Chinese Communist press
 has already conceded that in
 the North'China plains, a major
 wheat-producing area, there
 have been losses to the wheat
 crop as a result of the drought.
 The drought in the South China
 province of Kwangtung is said
 by Communist sources to have
 been the severest in 90-odd
 years.  The food situation there
 is expected to remain critical
 until after the late summer
 rice harvests.  Meanwhile,
 thousands of refugees and desti-
 tute farmers are reported flee-
 ing to Macao and Hong Kong.
 No mitigation of agricul-
 tural taxes in kind or of quotas
 for peasants' forced sales,
 both of which are set on the
 basis of norms, has as yet
 been announced.
 To combat the general
 scarcity, the government, which
 controls the distribution of
 most of the country's food,
 has been reducing allocations
 to both rural and urban markets
 late this spring, in an inten-
 sification of the austerity
 campaign.
 Rationing in cities, first
 adopted on a wide scale last
 year, has been extended to
 more items in more areas in
 recent months.  Recent. urban
 austerity measures appear de-
 signed to reduce the food ra-
 tions of population groups less
 favored by the regime.
 Another action taken this
 spring by the government to
 deal with agricultural problems
 has been the strengthening of
 the party cadres, the real rulers
 of rural China.  This effort to
 increase party control over the
 peasants probably indicates
 that the 1955 fall harvests will
 be followed by stricter procure-
 ment policies and a renewed
 drive to develop agricultural
 producer co-operatives, an
 elementary form of collective.
 To control food riots in
 the starvation areas and deal
 with other manifestations of
 hostility, the regime has ap-
 parently strengthened security
 forces in the countryside.
 Because of 1954's disastrous
 floods in the Yangtze valley,
 China's "rice-bowl" area, this
 year's exports of rice to Cey-
 lon--planned at about 300,000
 tons--have come from Canton,
 despite the critical food situa-
 tion in South China.  Rice ex-
 ports from South China to Macao
 were stepped up in late 1954 and
 resumed to Hong Kong in early
 1954 after an interval of several

 years.       Some 10,000 tons have
 also been shipped to the Viet

 Moreover, Peiping continues to
 ship rice to the USSR.

 buy from Burma this year
 300,000 tons of rice, which
 will offset part of the Chi-
 nese rice exports.

 last year's production.  This
 goal may not be reached unless
 the fall harvests are larger
 than normal.
 As happened in all other
 years since the,Communists came
 to power in 1949, food produc-
 tion on a. grain equivalent basis
 again may fail to reach the
 average output of the prewar
 years from 1931 to 1937.
 These failures, reminis-
 cent of the difficulties ex-
 perienced in the USSR. during
 the early years of Soviet eco-
 nomic development, appear to
 have been a principal factor
 behind the acceleration of so-
 cialization and state controls
 and the adoption of increasingly
 harsh austerity policies in the
 past two years.
 The peasant hostility
 aroused by the regime's actions
 is regarded by some observers
 as constituting a major poten-
 tial source of instability--
 unless, of course, the regime
 chooses to moderate its policies
 at the expense of the current
 rate of industrial and military
 development.  There are no indi-
 cations, however, that the re-
 gime is inclined toward such
 a major shift in its planning.
 Recent official statements
 indicate that Peiping recognizes
 the rise in food output during
 the first two Five-Year Plans
 (1953-62) will be limited be-
 cause of the low priority as-
 signed to allocation of invest-
 ment resources to agriculture.
 Peiping obviously abandoned
 hopes, expressed early in the
 first Five-Year Plan, for an
 increase of as much as 70 per-
 cent in food output by 1962.
 Actually, during the first
 two Five-Year Plans (1953-62)
 the rise in food output will
 probably not exceed 9 o1 10
 percent and may be much less.
 Estimated population growth
 during this period will almost
 certainly keep pace with the
 rise in food production.
 After that it will be
 impossible to maintain an equi-
 libriutd without substantial
 inputs of fertilizer.
 The two principal means
 ofachieving agricultural in-
 creases in China--the applica-
 tion of chemical fertilizer
 and the opening up of new land
 with mechanized, equipment--will
 not be attempted on a large
 scale until the third Five-
 Year Plan of 1963-1967, accord-
 ing to a report of last March
 by the minister, of agriculture
 to the State Council.
 It is estimated that the
 supply of chemical fertilizer
 will rise from about 500,000
 tons in 1953 to only 1,000,000
 tons in 1960.  At least 10,000,-
 000 to 15,000,000 tons are
 needed to achieve significant
 crop increases.
 A modest plan to expand
 acreage during the next five
 to seven years was recently
 announced.  The plan envisages
 the addition of only 6 percent
 to Communist China's present
 cultivated acreage.
 Meanwhile, Peiping plans
 to concentrate on expansion of
 irrigation and water conserva-
 tion works as its main effort
 to raise food output, and mod-
 est increases can be expected
 from this program.
 In view of these unfavor-
 able long-range prospects, the
 'rising needs of the regime for
 foodstuffs are to be met by an
 accelerated drive to increase
 control over agricultural out-
 put.
 These unfavorable agricul-
 tural prospects, the drive to-
 ward socialized farming, and
 other harsh rural policies have
 led some observers to conclude
 that during the first two Five-
 Year Plans (1953-62) Communist
 China may witness a peasant re-
 action similar to that of the
 peasants in the USSR during its
 first Five-Year Plan.  Neither

 this possibility nor that of
 a more open peasant revolt ap-
 pears to worry the Communist
 regime which has already de-
 veloped effective security
 controls in the countryside.
 Unless such a serious re-
 action occurred, agricultural
 failures would probably have
 no great effect on Peiping's
 military plans.
 The worst food situation
 in the regime's history occurred
 in early 1950.  At that time,
 however, Communist China was
 prepared to invade Formosa,
 and later in the year the
 Chinese Communists intervened
 in Korea.  The food situation
 remained poor, although slowly
 recovering, in 1951 and early
 1952 when Peiping committed
 and supplied some 700,000
 Chinese Communist troops in
 the Korean war.

 SOVIET LEADERS TIGHTEN IDEOLOGICAL REINS
 The Soviet leaders apparent-
 ly are trying to re-establish
 a militant ideological line.
 A drift toward less rigid
 party control on ideological
 matters, noticeable since the
 death of Stalin, was halted at
 the Congress of Soviet Writers
 in December 1954.
 The line now being intro-
 duced is similar in many re-
 spects to that followed by the
 fiery Communist Party activist,
 the late Andrei Zhdanov, in the
 1946-1948 period.
 Zhadanov, as the ranking
 party secretary after Stalin,
 was instrumental in developing
 a rigid pattern of party con-
 trol over all spheres of crea-
 tive activity in the early post-
 war years.   In 1947, he forced
 G.F. Alexandrov out of his
 position as director of agita-
 tion and propaganda for "tooth-
 less vegetarianism with regard
 to enemy philosophers."  Alex-
 androv's successor was Mikhail
 Suslov, who acquired much of
 Zhdanov's ideological authority
 after the latter's death.
 During this period, ideo-
 logical "deviations" led to
 the intimidation of any in-
 dependent criticism and often
 to the liquidation of the
 guilty party.
 In the period of rela-
 tively diffused authority
 after Stalin's death, however,
 Considerable discussion began
 to emerge on ideological and
 particularly literary ques-
 tions.
 Malenkov's occasional
 willingness to disregard doc-
 trine in order to accommodate
 popular desires--for consumers'
 goods in particular--was ac-
 companied in late 1953 and early
 1954 by growing demands for
 "sincerity" in writing and more
 consideration of purely literary
 values in criticism.   In February

 1954, at the high point of
 freer literary discussion, G.F.
 Alexandrov was appointed minis-
 ter of culture, thereby return-
 ing to prominence a personal
 and ideological rival of the
 more rigid Suslov.
 In June 1954, Suslov and
 the other ideologists of the
 central committee opened the
 attack on the more liberal
 attitude by approving an editor-
 ial in Rommunist which cited the
 "great and-major I significance"
 of resolutions on the arts a-
 dopted by the central committee
 from 1946 to 1948.  This call
 for greater party control was
 followed by specific attacks
 on "the cult of sincerity" and
 the works of authors who had
 reflected a relatively independ-
 ent critical outlook in their
 writings.
 The proponents of more
 creative freedom were surpris-
 ingly unsubdued,however, and
 some high-level support for
 their position may have been a
 factor in postponing the Writ-
 ers' Congress from autumn to
 late December 1954.  A clear
 resolution of the controversy
 was evidently required in order
 that the congress--only the
 second in the history of the
 USSR--would not become a demon-
 stration of ideological division.
 The list of speakers and
 the tone of speeches at the
 congress indicated that the
 debate had already been resolved
 in favor of stricter party dis-
 cipline along Zhdanov lines.
 The report on the activi-
 ties of the Writers' Union was
 largely a catalogue of ideolog-
 ical tendencies to be avoided;
 and the formal message from the
 central committee pointedly
 urged writers "not to remain
 passive from the political
 point of view."
 Michael Sholokhov,  the
 only writer to argue seriously
 for greater creative freedom
 and scope for the artist, was
 rebuked by the chairman, who
 spoke of his "party duty" to
 denounce "the un-party-like
 attitude" of Sholokhov.
 The resigned tone of
 Alexandorv's speech at the con-
 gress and his subsequent dis-
 missal as minister of culture
 confirmed the rise of firmer
 party control in literature.
 The emphasis on ideologi-
 cal conformity moved into wider
 fields in January.  Kommunist,
 under the title "The Sta egy
 and Tactics of Leninism," printed
 a militant statement of classi-
 cal revolutionary doctrine.  An
 unusual feature of the article
 was an accompanying note which
 explained that this text would
 "clear up the question of what
 the strategy and tactics. of
 Leninism are."  The article
 referred to the Communist Party
 as "the shock brigade of the
 world revolutionary workers'
 movement," and Mao Tse-tung was
 quoted to reaffirm that "who-
 ever tries to fight the Com-
 munists must be prepared to be
 ground to dust."
 Other publications in Janu-
 ary denounced those who "oscil--
 lated from one side to the other
 with the help of pretexts" and
 "wreckers on one side and bun-
 glers on the other" who had in-
 fected the party with "their
 filth of theory and practice."
 Resolution of the more
 fundamental issue apparently
 had to await the discrediting
 of Malenkov in early February.
 Molotov, in his speech to
 the Supreme Soviet the day after
 Malenkov's demotion, condemned
 the "weak-nerved and weak-kneed"
 in the USSR, saying that not
 "world civilization" but only
 the "decaying social system of
 which bloodthirsty imperialism
 is the core" would perish in
 any new world war.   Thus, he
 rejected Malenkov's statement
 of March 1954 that a new atomic

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 war would mean "the destruction
 of world civilization."
 The speech was the most
 Stalinist in several years.
 Like the decision to stress
 heavy industry over consumers'
 goods and to increase military
 expenditures, this development
 was a clear indication that the
 government was determined to
 react with firmness to the rati-
 fication of the Paris agreements
 and the growling strength in the
 West.
 Molotov's speech was fol-
 lowed by the deletion of all
 "defeatist" references to "the
 destruction of world civiliza-
 tion" from the domestic press
 and radio, although they still
 appeared in international propa-
 ganda.
 This attitude of forced
 optimism in the party drew
 much of its inspiration direct-
 ly from the period of Zhdanov's
 dominance.
 Citing a Cominform declara-
 tion of September 1947 that
 "the main danger today for the
 working class lies in under-
 estimating its own forces and
 overestimating the forces in the
 imperialist camp," Kommunist
 declared,  "This was correct in
 1947.   It is all the more cor-
 rect in 1955."
 The importance of this re-
 newed party discipline in
 ideology has been emphasized in
 all recent party publications.
 Nevertheless, a full
 return to Stalinism does not
 appear to be intended.
 A number of men known to
 have identified themselves with
 the policies of Malenkov have
 recently been elevated in
 authority, indicating the un-
 willingness or inability of the
 apostles of the firmer policy
 to revive the Stalinist pattern
 of purges .
 There has been no renewal
 of interference with scientific
 research on ideological grounds
 as in the Lysenko controversy
 some years ago.  Khrushchev, in
 fact, has warned that Soviet
 scientists must not ignore
 Western science "under the guise
 of the struggle against cosmo-
 politanism."
 Denunciation of writers
 has not yet led to their dis-
 appearance.  A number of writers
 discredited in the 1946-47 peri-
 od have reappeared.  The at-
 titude has been that writers
 should create enthusiasm for new
 achievement above and beyond
 routine conformity.
 This position is exempli-
 fied by Alexander Korneichuk,
 one of the official summarizers
 of the 'Writers' Congress, and a
 man who may well be the closest
 of all major Soviet writers to
 Khrushchev.  The Moscow opening
 of Korneichuk's play, The
 Wings, was attended on-M Febru-
 aryby Khrushchev and other
 Soviet leaders.  Khrushchev re-
 portedly made a point of applaud-
 ing the portions of the play
 criticizing Beria and his methods--
 apparently anxious to indicate
 that greater party control over
 literature would not mean a re-
 turn to terror of the Stalin
 type.
 Khrushchev appears to favor
 a return to Zhdanovism without
 terror.  Concerned not only with
 steeling conviction among the
 faithful, Khrushchev wishes to
 secure positive approval for dif-
 ficult new undertakings such as
 the new lands program.  Having re-
 jected Malenkov's primary reliance
 on consumer incentives, Khrush-
 chev seeks to use "the lively
 study of theory" to inspire
 confidence and stimulate popu-
 lar enthusiasm.   "Scholasti-
 cism" and "routinism" have be-
 come the accepted terms of re-
 proach for those who do not
 find ideology a "stimulus" for
 increased accomplishment.

 CONFIDENTIAL
 Apparently Khrushchev and
 the ideologists of the central
 committee want to get the best
 of both worlds: the stability
 and confidence of renewed party
 control and ideological firm-
 ness, along with the practical
 benefits of learning from the
 West and allowing for creative
 initiative from below on tech-
 bical matters.
 Whether the present leader-
 ship will eventually return to
 the capricious terror and crude
 ideological intimidation of
 Stalin's day, or whether in-
 stead there will be a more and
 more realistic accommodation to
 actual conditions and popular
 desires, will largely be de-
 termined by the success of the
 present policy.
