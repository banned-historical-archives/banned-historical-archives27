 FAR EAST
 China has reacted to intensified US air strikes
 in North Vietnam with charges that the US is plot-
 ting to extend the war to China.   Peking's propa-
 ganda claimed its air force destroyed five US aircraft
 which allegedly violated Chinese territory.   No
 specific threats of counteraction were made.   China's
 charges appear designed primarily to deter US air
 operations near the Chinese frontier.
 The pace of Communist military action in north-
 ern South Vietnam increased sharply last week with
 massive shellings of US positions and an extended
 engagement between an estimated 2,500 North Vietnam-
 ese regulars and two US Marine battalions.
 In Peking,  the Chinese staged an unusual May
 Day celebration which featured the largest turnout
 of leaders since last November.   The roster of the
 select group surrounding Mao Tse-tung suggests that
 further changes have been made in the military high
 command.   The absence of Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
 ping further underlines their isolation and degrada-
 tion.
 The resignation of Prime Minister Lon Nol's cab-
 inet in Cambodia apparently reflects an attempt by
 Chief of State Sihanouk to check political infighting
 and to establish a better balance between forces of
 the right and left.   Sihanouk's action may have
 been prompted by indications that the prime minister
 and the army were preparing a major purge of the left,
 threatening his traditional practice of playing
 leftist and conservative elements a ainst each other.

 VIETNAM
 The tempo of Communist oper-
 ations in South Vietnam's two
 northernmost provinces increased
 sharply during the past week,
 amid indications of continuing
 reinforcement of units.
 On 27 and 28 April, Commu-
 nist forces shelled US Marine
 positions at Gio Linh and Dong
 Ha in northern Quang Tri Province
 and at Phu Bai in adjacent Thua
 Thien Province with one of their
 heaviest barrages of artillery,
 rocket, and mortar fire to date.
 The obviously well-coordinated
 attacks resulted in cumulative
 US losses of 12 killed and nearly
 200 wounded,  as well as damage to
 US aircraft and artillery.
 In western Quang Tri Province
 near the Laotian border,  two US Ma-
 rine battalions and an estimated
 2,500 North Vietnamese Army  (NVA)
 regulars have been engaged for
 more than a week in sporadic
 heavy fighting some six m les
 northwest of Khe Sanh.   The ac-
 tion began on 25 April when a
 Marine engineer convoy participat-
 ing in Operation PRAIRIE IV was
 ambushed along Route 9 by what
 was estimated to be an NVA bat-
 talion.              The convoy was reinforced
 by additional Marine units,  and
 a major battle then developed
 for control of three strategic
 hills northwest of Khe Sanh
 astride key enemy infiltration
 routes from both Laos and the De-
 militarized Zone  (DMZ).
 As of 3 May,  US forces,
 supported by continuous air and
 artillery bombardment, had dis-
 lodged some elements of the
 enemy force--now tentatively
 identified as at least a regiment
 of the 325th NVA Division--from
 their heavily fortified hilltop
 positions.   The battle, however,
 has been costly to both sides--
 enemy casualties to date are
 473 killed and US losses are 119
 killed and 330 wounded.
 The pattern of the past week's
 Communist activity in Quang Tri
 and Thua Thien provinces sug-
 gests at least a temporary shift
 of military attention away from
 Revolutionary Development teams,
 South Vietnamese Army district
 headquarters, and outposts.   The
 massive shellings of US bases
 are designed to inflict maximum
 American losses at minimum enemy
 cost.   The action at Khe Sanh
 is clearly intended to draw
 elite US combat units into a pro-
 tracted battle of attrition in
 terrain tactically advantageous
 to the Communists.   The concen-
 tration on US targets may also
 reflect an increasing determina-
 tion to register a spectacular
 victory against a major US posi-
 tion--for its psychological value
 both locally in the provinces
 and in Saigon and Washington.
 Preliminary analysis of
 bomb-damage photography of the
 strike on Kep Airfield on 1 May
 showed three parked MIG fighters
 burning.   At least two other MIGs
 at Hoa Lac were also damaged.
 Although the facilities at both
 fields sustained limited damage,
 the primary runways appear to be
 serviceable.

 Politics in Saigon
 Considerable anxiety is evi-
 dent in current Constituent As-
 sembly debate on the proposed
 presidential electoral law pre-
 pared by an assembly drafting
 committee.   This anxiety stems
 from the desire of both civilians
 and the military to derive some
 built-in advantage from the pro-
 visions of the law.
 Premier Ky and his support-
 ers have been concerned that the
 prospects   of the military nominee
 could be reduced by possible re-
 strictions on the number or
 eligibility of candidates,  or by
 a requirement that the winning
 candidate must have a specified
 minimum percentage of the total
 Although the subcommittee
 had dropped the provision calling
 for a runoff between the top two
 candidates,  deputies supporting
 civilians for the presidency may
 attempt to reinsert it during
 the assembly's plenary debate.
 In addition,  some provision aimed
 at restricting the number of can-
 didates now seems likely to be
 adopted as a compromise.
 Certain other differences
 between the military and the as-
 sembly over the electoral regu-
 lations,  although not likely to
 bear significantly on the outcome
 of the elections, reflect the
 defiant mood of some of the depu-
 ties.   For instance, the assembly
 has approved a 3 September elec-
 tion date out of pique at the
 Armed Forces Congress for having
 previously,  on its own,  announced
 the date as 1 September.   The
 draft law also states that mili-
 tary personnel must request leave
 without pay beginning with the
 date they file their candidacies
 through election day.   Some depu-
 ties believe candidates should be
 completely divorced from govern-
 mental positions.   This issue may
 arise during plenary debate.
 Another irritant which could
 upset relations between the mili-
 tary and the assembly is the des-
 ignation of Police Director Loan
 in place of General Tri as the
 Directorate liaison contact with
 the deputies.   Loan's heavy-handed
 method of interjecting Ky's rec-
 ommendations have already nettled
 some of the assemblymen.   It is
 possible, however,  that many of
 them fear Loan's security appa-
 ratus enough to submit to pressure
 tactics.
 The final form of the contro-
 versial provisions will be decided
 upon in the next few days of as-
 sembly deliberations.   The in-
 terests of the military establish-
 ment appear to be well represented
 through sympathetic deputies in
 the Democratic-Alliance bloc--the
 largest and most influential as-
 sembly grouping-,-and it does not
 appear likely that the present
 draft presidential. election regu-
 lations will be seriously altered.

 PEKING MAY DAY LINE-UP POINTS TO FURTHER CHANGES
 Mao Tse-tung, Lin Piao,
 and Chou En-lai joined 150 other
 officials at a mass May Day rally
 in Peking in the biggest turn-
 out of Chinese Communist leaders
 since last November.   The list
 of names for this huge turnout
 points to possible changes in
 the military command structure
 and the further isolation and
 degradation of Liu Shao-chi,  Teng
 Hsiao-ping,  and their adherents.
 Mao and Lin spent the day
 cruising from gathering to gather-
 ing in an open car,  followed by
 13 other politburo members, mili-
 tary leaders,  and Cultural Rev-
 olution officials.
 Mao
 appeared quite healthy and alert
 25X1    on the rostrum, where he remained
 for 90 minutes.
 The roster of the elite group
 in Mao's motorcade suggests that
 further changes have been made in
 the military high command.   The
 only military men aside from Lin
 were acting Chief of Staff Yang
 Cheng-wu, Minister of Public Secu-
 rity Hsieh Fu-chih, the top army
 commissar Hsiao Hua,  and Su Yu,
 a capable officer who had been
 in political limbo since being
 replaced as chief of staff in
 1958.   Su's return to prominence
 Page 5
 in company with these three
 tends to confirm poster reports
 late last month that the four
 had been named vice chairmen of
 the party's Military Affairs Com-
 mittee.   Reportedly,  they have
 replaced three members who have
 been under heavy Red Guard at-
 tack--Hsu Hsiang-chien, Yeh
 Chien-ying,  and Chen Yi.
 Several politburo members,
 including these three, who have
 been castigated through posters
 and demonstrations,  turned up in
 their proper formal ranking on
 the Tienanmen rostrum with Mao.
 Their presence does not mean
 that they have been restored to
 good standing.   All were point-
 edly excluded from the motor-
 cade and from small elite groups
 which joined Mao in various cere-
 monial events during the day.
 Their appearance, however, makes
 more conspicuous the absence of
 such major propaganda targets
 as Chief of State Liu Shao-chi.
 Several high-ranking mili-
 tary officials from the prov-
 inces showed up at the rally,
 including the commanders of the
 Lanchow, Tibet, Kunming and Foo-
 chow Military Regions.   Their
 presence in Peking may be a sign
 that a parley of regional mili-
 tary officials is under way to
 decide how to handle local political

 disturbances.   There is evi-
 dence, however, that Peking does
 not fully trust at least two of
 these commanders--those from
 Kunming and Lanchow.   They may
 have been brought to Peking to
 get them out of the way while
 their commands are being reor-
 ganized.
 There are,  in fact,  several
 signs that the drive to remove
 local military commanders is be-
 ing stepped up.  Numerous posters
 highly critical of local command-
 ers have been displayed in Peking
 in the past two weeks.   Poster's
 allege that in Kansu Province,
 for example, two party secre-
 taries supported by a deputy com-
 mander of the Lanchow Military
 Region used civilians and troops
 to rout Red Guards from a news-

 CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT REPLACED
 The ouster of the moderate
 Lon Nol cabinet in Cambodia rep-
 resents  another  effort by Chief
 of State Sihanouk to strike a
 fresh balance between the right
 and left in Phnom Penh.
 In announcing Lon Nol's
 resignation on 30 April,  Sihanouk
 explained that it resulted from
 "grave dissension" among "im-
 portant leaders" in the govern-
 ment and the National Assembly.
 Sihanouk has long played leftist
 and conservative elements against
 each other,  and his latest move
 may have been prompted by indi-
 cations that the prime minister
 and the army were preparing a
 major purge of the left.   One of
 the reasons given for Lon Nol's
 resignation was the recent dis-
 appearance of two leading left-
 ists who had been charged with
 complicity in recent antigovern-
 ment disturbances.
 The Cambodian left has at-
 tacked the Lon Nol government
 since its establishment last Oc-
 tober,  largely because of its
 lack of leftist representation.
 Sihanouk's support continued,
 however, until the outbreak of
 dissidence in western Cambodia
 last month and an upsurge in
 leftist agitation undermined the
 Lon Nol government's position.
 The new "interim" cabinet,
 which was announced on 2 May,
 contains no major surprises.  It
 is dominated by old-line conserv-
 atives,  among  them the new prime
 minister, Son Sann, Sihanouk's
 chief economic adviser.   The in-
 clusion of two prominent left-
 ists, however, indicates Sihanouk
 is determined to make it less
 vulnerable to attack from the
 left than its predecessor.   Si-
 hanouk has stated that the Son
 Sann cabinet will hold office
 for only one to three months,
 in the  "hope" that the political
 situation will then permit the
 installation of a more permanent
 government.
 The army, meanwhile,  is con-
 tinuing sweep operations against
 what it terms  "Communist" dissi-
 dents in western Cambodia.   Si-
 hanouk has also moved to meet
 popular discontent in the area
 by naming a new governor of
 Battambang Province,  center of

 EUROPE
 The Soviets displayed no new military equipment
 in this year's May Day parade.   They are probably
 waiting until the 50th anniversary celebrations in
 November to show off their newer weapons.   Defense
 Minister Grechko's May Day speech contained the
 standard denunciation of US policy in Vietnam and
 the standard specter of a nuclear-armed West Germany.
 The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee's re-
 convening has been postponed from 9 May until 18 May
 in order to give the US and the USSR more time to
 work out their differences over the draft nonprolif-
 eration treaty.   The main problems are the safeguards
 article and the question of whether nuclear states
 should retain a veto on amendments to the treaty.
 Prime Minister Wilson's long-awaited announce-
 ment of a new bid to join the Common Market implied
 that he will accept the existing community with mini-
 mum conditions, although possibly for tactical rea-
 sons he stopped short of a flat offer to sign up.
 Some Labor backbenchers will be vehement in their
 opposition when Parliament debates the subject next
 week, but Wilson is certain to get overwhelming en-
 dorsement for a formal application.   The next impor-
 tant steps rest with the EEC members, and all inter-
 ested parties are waiting to see what line De Gaulle

 PROGRESS IN SOVIET WEATHER SATELLITE SYSTEM
 Soviet efforts to develop
 a weather satellite--including
 nearly three years of flight
 testing---have apparently culmi-
 nated in a decision to proceed
 with establishing an operational
 system.
 With the launch of Cosmos
 156 on 27 April,  the Soviets have
 two operating weather satellites
 in orbit., indicating that develop-
 ment has been completed and that
 they have confidence in the sys-
 tem.   Soviet statements also in-
 dicate that the USSR has decided
 that a space weather system is
 both desirable and feasible.
 Cosmos 144 and 156 are in
 almost circular orbits more than
 300 miles high at inclinations of
 81 degrees, giving almost world-
 wide coverage.   The planes of the
 orbits are perpendicular,  result-
 ing in nearly maximum frequency of
 coverage for a two-satellite sys-
 tem.   The light and dark sides
 of the earth are each scanned
 twice daily.
 the SL-3 launch system (the SS-6
 with a Lunik upper stage), the
 satellites weigh 3,000 to 5,000
 pounds and use solar cells for
 electrical power.
 Moscow is sending cloud maps
 and other data from both satellites
 to the US over the weather "hot
 line" under the terms of the bi-
 lateral agreement on cooperation
 in space.   So far,  however,  the
 data is not being sent as quickly
 as the agreement calls for.   The
 initial satellite weather data
 provided to the US by the Soviets
 came from Cosmos 122 in 1966,  the
 first of the test vehicles to op-
 erate satisfactorily and the first
 to be publicly identified as a
 weather satellite.
 The Soviets will probably
 launch more weather satellites
 to replace those which malfunc-

 The satellites are equipped
 with both television and infrared
 systems.   The television provides
 day-time pictures of the earth and
 its cloud cover with a resolution
 approximating that of similar US

 permits analysis of cloud cover
 and meteorological conditions
 both day and night.   Orbited by

 FRENCH GOVERNMENT SEIZES THE INITIATIVE IN PARLIAMENT
 The government's decision
 to seek special powers for six
 months in order to decree economic
 reforms reflects both the serious-
 ness of the problems it faces and
 its lack of confidence in parlia-
 ment.   The reforms are intended
 to prepare France for full compe-
 tition from its five Common Market
 partners when the last tariffs
 within the EEC are removed on
 1 July 1968.   There are measures
 to modernize inefficient indus-
 tries or regions or to redirect
 their efforts,  to assure full
 employment,  to increase state as-
 sistance to unemployed workers
 and to put the social security
 system on a sound financial foot-
 ing.
 To avoid seeking a majority
 in parliament in favor of the
 enabling legislation,  the govern-
 ment probably will take advantage
 of a constitutional prerogative
 whereby the bill will be adopted
 automatically unless a majority
 of the membership supports a cen-
 sure motion.   This tactic spares
 dissatisfied deputies from having
 to go formally on record in favor
 of the bill and places the burden
 of gaining a majority on the
 opposition.
 The opposition Federation of
 the Left has already announced
 its intention to introduce a
 Page  12
 censure motion and expects  support
 from the Communists and many of
 the center deputies..   The Gaullist
 camp, however,  supported by indi-
 vidual center deputies,  is ex-
 pected to hold a thin edge. Gis-
 card d'Estaing and his Gaullist-
 allied Independent Republicans
 are unhappy over a procedure which
 robs them of any opportunity to
 influence the nature of the pro-
 posed legislation.   The government
 is banking, however, on Giscard's
 reluctance to take responsibility
 for bringing the government down
 in the face of an implicit threat
 of new elections.
 The government's real problem
 is to get under way a program
 which, within six months, will
 stimulate economic growth.   With
 the French balance of payments
 running a small deficit,  the gov-
 ernment will try to avoid infla-
 tionary measures that would make
 French exports less competitive.
 Some measures will be highly un-
 popular.   Should the government's
 economic reforms fail to show
 satisfactory results by next fall,
 the parliament would be emboldened
 to strike back, possibly by re-
 fusing to pass crucial legisla-
 tion.   More important, defections
 from within De Gaulle's own camp
 could seriously erode his parlia-
 mentary base.

 YUGOSLAV ELECTIONS STIR GRASS-ROOTS POLITICAL ACTIVITY
 Yugoslavia's elections last
 month produced some surprises
 as well as a few major defeats
 for the regime.   The elections
 were to fill assembly  (parlia-
 mentary)  seats at local,  repub-
 lic,  and federal levels and were
 the first real test of the rota-
 tion principle adopted by the
 1963 constitution.   About one
 half (some 14,000)  of the seats
 in the various assemblies changed
 hands to conform with legislation
 prohibiting deputies from suc-
 ceeding themselves.                           The elec-
 tions were also a test of the
 regime's policies which had been
 designed to encourage competition
 for the seats and to curtail the
 direct control of the party over
 the selection of candidates.
 The regime's complicated
 system of filtering candidates
 up through local,  republican,
 and federal levels  (only local
 elections are direct)  generally
 resulted in choices acceptable
 to the party.   Local voters,
 however,  took a particularly
 strong hand in the process.   In
 one constituency,  angry crowds
 disrupted a political caucus
 to prevent its rejection of their
 candidates.   In other caucuses,
 "mild panic" broke out as many
 party hacks found themselves
 passed over in favor of younger,
 more popular men and women.
 The party suffered a definite
 defeat in Serbia.   Approved nom-
 inees for five out of the ten
 vacant seats in the country's
 highest parliamentary body,  the
 Federal Assembly, were beaten by
 opposition candidates who cam-
 paigned against the regime's pol-
 icies.   The most notable loser,
 Foreign Trade Minister Nikola
 Dzuverovic,  lost by a three to
 one margin to a partisan hero
 of World War II.   His opponent,
 and the winners of the other four
 seats, won by playing on dissat-
 isfaction                                                                                 among  the peasants
 and by condemning the country's
 economic reform program as alien
 to their interests and to the
 interests of the republic.
 The regime had established
 a freer election process to help
 rid itself of the conservative,
 partisan type who resist Yugo-
 slavia's liberal programs.   The
 leaders will be aware that these
 very people used the elections
 to defeat the party's more lib-
 eral candidates in Serbia.
 Nevertheless,  it seems doubt-
 ful the leadership will reinsti-
 tute cumbersome controls to en-
 sure election of only party-spon-
 sored candidates.                                                                               A conservative
 reaction against the ouster of
 Aleksandar Rankovic last summer
 was to be expected in Serbia, but
 backers of the liberal programs
 fared well in the other five re-
 publics.   The regime will prob-
 ably continue the policy of en-
 couraging a real choice among
 generally acceptable candidates.

 RUMANIA ACCENTUATES ITS INDEPENDENT STANCE
 Bucharest, by deciding to
 stay away from the all-European
 Communist Party conference held
 last week at Karlovy Vary, moved
 perceptibly closer to a position
 long held by neighboring Yugo-
 slavia.
 This decision climaxed an
 unprecedented number of bilateral
 contacts with Communist parties
 of both NATO and Warsaw Pact coun-
 tries as well as with the Yugo-
 slavs.   To further emphasize its
 disapproval,  the regime's press
 published a wave of articles, one
 of which flatly states tliat the
 establishment of both internal
 and foreign policy lines is the
 "...exclusive business,  the un-
 alienable right of each Commu-
 nist party."
 Bucharest based its decision
 not to go to the conference on
 differences with its Communist
 allies much broader than were
 evident when it decided not to
 attend the Moscow consultative
 meeting in March 1965.   At that
 time, the disagreements were
 limited essentially to ideologi-
 cal issues within the Communist
 camp,  for example,  the Sino-So.-
 viet dispute,  and Soviet hegemony.
 This time, however, Bucharest
 also stressed its unilateral
 right to have relations with any
 country,  such as West Germany.
 Page  14    WEEKLY SUMMARY
 This "active coexistence"
 line resembles Yugoslavia's po-
 sition and, this similarity--along
 with the greatly stepped-up con-
 tacts between the two parties--
 indicates that their joint absence
 from the Karlovy Vary meeting was
 no mere coincidence.   The Ruma-
 nians and Yugoslavs have made at
 least nine party-government ex-
 change visits since last November.
 President Tito and Rumanian party
 chief Ceausescu have met twice
 during the same period.
 More intensified party con-
 tacts between the two countries
 can be expected in view of their
 common concern for European secu-
 rity,                                                                        and their mutual apprehen-
 sions about Soviet hegemony.
 Ceausescu reportedly plans an of-
 ficial visit to Yugoslavia next
 month.   In their pursuit of Euro-
 pean security the Rumanians will
 probably continue to give strong
 public and governmental support
 to the Group of Nine--an informal
 United Nations group of which they
 are members and which promotes
 friendlier relations among all
 European countries.   Both Commu-
 nist mavericks believe that mean-
 ingful progress toward European
 security can be made only at the
 state level rather than through
 Communist party meetin s such
 as Karlovy Vary.                              25X1

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The food crisis in India is reaching serious
 proportions and will remain acute until at least
 the end of the year.   Economic strains stemming
 from two years of drought are contributing heavily
 to the political difficulties India is experienc-
 ing.   The election for president is scheduled for
 6 May,  and the Congress Party candidate,  a south
 Indian Muslim, has only a 50-50 chance to win.
 The loss of this post by Congress would further
 erode support for Mrs. Gandhi's government.
 In Turkey, the split in the opposition Repub-
 lican People's Party  (RPP)  further fragments the
 political opposition and strengthens the ruling
 Justice Party.   Disturbed by the RPP's increasing
 drift to the left,  48 center-oriented senators
 and deputies resigned on 30 April.
 World-wide reaction to the Greek coup has been
 strongly antagonistic.   This is particularly true
 in the USSR and Eastern Europe which harbor large
 Greek-exile communities.   For events in Greece it-
 self see page 16.
 Nasir in his speech on 2 May portrayed the US
 as Egypt's real enemy, and praised the "honorable
 stand of the Yemeni Government" in its recent ac-
 tions against the US AID mission.
 In Africa,  the prestige of Sekou Toure's re-
 gime has fallen to its lowest ebb due to financial
 scandals and a sinking economy, but the regime is
 expected to survive.   Tourd most likely will react
 by lashing out at "foreign corruption."   He has
 already directed that all foreign missionaries be
 expelled by 1 June.
 Nigeria is still on the verge of breaking up.
 The Western Region's leaders now say that if the
 East secedes so will the West.

 GREEK MILITARY REGIME DIGS IN
 The two-week-old military
 regime continues to tighten its
 hold on the country, and no or-
 ganized resistance has developed.
 Below the surface calm, however,
 there are fears that the purging
 of all the moderate political
 elements can only lead to an in-
 evitable clash between extreme
 rightist and leftist factions.
 Prominent political personal-
 ities of both the center and the
 right are dismayed by recent
 events.   They doubt that there
 can be any speedy return to any
 form of representative government.
 They believe that eventually the
 extreme left may be led or driven
 to armed resistance.   For now,
 however,  Communist elements--the
 presumptive organizers of guer-
 rilla resistance--are all but
 paralyzed, because most of the
 "hard-core" troublemakers have
 been rounded up and sent to de-
 tention centers on outlying is-
 lands.
 The most prominent political
 detainee is Center Union deputy
 Andreas Papandreou, whom the coup
 leaders regard, as Greece's "enfant
 terrible" and the man most re-
 sponsible for the country's drift
 to the left.   Andreas apparently
 will be detained until the regime
 is satisfied that his power to
 foment a revolution from the left
 is broken.
 Cyprus has not been affected
 by the coup in Greece.   Both the
 Greek and Turkish Cypriots reacted
 with caution,  and the coup leaders
 may be too preoccupied with events
 at home to concern themselves
 with the Cyprus problem.
 There has been predictably strong
 adverse reaction to the coup around
 the world,  particularly from East-
 ern Europe and the USSR.   Both
 harbor large Greek-exile communi-
 ties from the Communist guerrilla
 war of 1947-49.   Government and
 public opinion in Western Europe
 has been almost unanimously crit-
 ical of the take-over.
 After discussions with UN
 representatives from the Communist
 countries, UN Secretary General
 Thant asked the Greek representa-
 tive to urge his government to
 follow the usual judicial proceed-
 ings in dealing with the political
 detainees.

 Husayn and Faysal, made a passing

 TROUBLES MOUNTING IN GUINEA
 The prestige of Sekou Toure's
 regime is at its lowest ebb since
 Guinea became independent in 1958.
 Tour's extensive grass-roots po-
 litical apparatus and his long-
 standing precautions against an
 army take-over will probably keep
 him in power although a major
 political upheaval cannot be
 ruled out.
 Problems have been piling up
 lately.   A number of highly placed
 officials have been implicated in
 financial scandals involving state
 trading enterprises.   Some of them
 have been arrested,  demoted,  or
 have opted for exile.   The re-
 gime is pushing a clean-up cam-
 paign, which began with the cre-
 ation earlier this year of a con-
 trol commission to oversee the
 activity of the state enterprises.
 In addition,  Toure promised this
 week to punish without clemency
 those involved.   Financial scan-
 dals are not a novelty in Guinea,
 but the latest have been more se-
 rious and have exposed senior of-
 ficials.   Toure may be able to
 gain some political benefit by
 his punitive measures, but popu-
 lar respect for public officials
 has been further undermined and
 Toure's own confidence in those
 around him shaken.
 The general decline of the
 economy also has been continuing.
 Food shortages and power failures
 threaten in Conakry,  and local
 markets upcountry are low on
 stocks.   There have been reports
 that the government has not been
 meeting its payrolls--including
 those at some military facilities.
 Moreover, bankruptcy proceedings
 against the foreign-owned iron
 mining company, which had been
 one of the few going concerns in
 the country, have just been con-
 cluded.
 Toure's most likely reaction
 to his accumulating problems will
 be to lash out at "'foreign cor-
 ruption."   He holds European busi-
 nessmen at least partially respon-
 sible for the scandals.   He be-
 lieves French officials may have
 been involved in last month's
 "defection" to Paris of one of
 his old friends who resigned from
 the Guinean diplomatic service.
 Antiforeign sentiment already has
 been stirred up by the capture of
 a French-officered Ivory Coast
 fishing boat which the Guineans
 claim was lurking offshore near
 Conakry for subversive purposes,
 and by a world-wide press campaign
 that Toure's overthrow is immi-
 nent.
 The first Guinean retaliation
 has been directed at Christian
 clergy and foreign missionaries,
 who were placed under restriction
 last month.   The major new item
 in Toure's May Day speech was the
 announcement that all missionaries
 would be expelled by 1 June in
 order to "Africanize" the churches,
 although the real causes probably
 stem from their less than whole-
 hearted support of the regime and
 the frequency of their contacts

 the West,  and Mid-West--perhaps
 as many as 2,000-2,500--have re-
 cently returned to the East.   The
 removal of Yorubas from army units
 outside the West,  together with
 the Ibo migration to the East,
 will contribute greatly to inef-
 ficiency and mismanagement because
 these two tribal groups have long
 provided the more technically
 qualified personnel throughout
 Nigeria.   It will also reduce po-
 lice and military capability to
 handle civil disturbances.
 Further concessions to the
 East, as proposed by the Western
 leaders, as well as the removal
 of Northern troops from Lagos and
 the West would not sit well with
 Northern hard-line military officers,
 nor with many of the high-level
 civil servants in Lagos.   Gowon is
 to be allowed a guard unit in the
 capital.   There continue to be
 reports, however,  that Ghanaians
 and a group of leading civilian
 politicians from all regions are
 attempting to bring Gowon and
 Ojukwu together.
 If Gowon agrees to ease the
 gradually increasing pressure he
 has been putting on the East,  and
 if Ojukwu believes the East may
 now be able to profit by Western
 pressure on Gowon, Ojukwu may be
 willing to postpone his reported
 plans to secede the Eastern Region
 by the end of May.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Troublemakers were almost completely unsuccess-
 ful this year in their annual efforts to cause dis-
 turbances during the May Day period.   The only major
 disruption took place in Ecuador, where the Guayaquil
 labor day parade erupted into a fistfight between pro-
 Moscow and pro-Peking Communist factions who are vying
 for control of a labor federation.   In Guatemala, Com-
 munist plans for violence were disrupted by a police
 raid which netted documents detailing plans and lists
 of targets.   In a clash with Communists, government
 security forces wounded and captured a long-time
 party member who also was a leader of the Rebel Armed
 Forces.
 Fidel Castro was in full prominence at the Cuban
 celebration but apparently fulfilled an earlier prom-
 ise to share the spotlight by letting Acting Minister
 of Defense Juan Almeida hurl the usual invectives at
 the US.   Old records of Che Guevara's voice were used
 to perpetuate his image as a leading revolutionary.
 Cuba's repeat of calls for armed struggle in Latin
 America will sustain the anti-Castro attitude of some
 governments and further irritate pro-Soviet Communist
 leaders in the hemisphere.
 In other d-velopments right-wing dissatisfaction
 with Dominican President Balaguer has increased and
 there have been more rumors of antigovernment plotting.
 On the other end of the island, Haiti's President
 Duvalier nipped a suspected plot by transferring and
 dismissing some of his elite guard.   He has probably
 not solved the problem completely, however.
 Argentina's President Ongania has kept the lid
 on labor and student activities and in Brazil the
 authorities have so far coped with several student
 anti-US demonstrations.   This agitation has not
 spread into other elements of the populace.
 The Bolivian military continued its attempts to
 encircle guerrillas in the southeast,  resulting in
 minor clashes.

 "NEW LOOK" IN BRAZIL
 The new Brazilian Government
 which took office on 15 March,
 is enjoying considerable domestic
 popularity.    This is largely a
 reflection of President Costa e
 Silva's success in playing upon
 Brazilian pride and nationalism
 and upon popular hopes for a re-
 laxation of the economic austeri-
 ties of the Castello Branco ad-
 ministration.   Costa e Silva's
 popularity may be short-lived,
 however,  unless he can show some
 positive accomplishments--partic-
 ularly in the domestic economic
 field--in the relatively near
 future.
 Of immediate interest to
 most Brazilians is the effort
 under way to "humanize" the more
 stringent aspects of the former
 government's stabilization pro-
 gram.   The government's prime
 goal now is said to be "develop-
 ment" rather than fighting infla-
 tion.   Rent increases have been
 eased, certain tax hikes delayed,
 and income tax exemptions in-
 creased.   There is as yet,  however,
 no evidence that the government
 is prepared to take the less pop-
 ular complementary measures--such
 as reducing expenditures to com-
 pensate for reduced revenues.
 The new administration has
 greatly changed the method and
 style of government operations.
 Instead of maintaining the highly
 centralized organizational system
 that had characterized the preced-
 ing administration, Costa e Silva
 has delegated extensive authority
 to his ministers.   The initial re-
 sult appears to be uncoordinated
 policies set up by able but ambi-
 tious cabinet officers.   No one
 has yet had to make a tough,  un-
 popular decision, and it remains
 to be seen whether members of
 the administration can submerge
 their desire for personal ag-
 grandizement and work together as
 a team.
 Costa e Silva's emerging for-
 eign policy also reflects the
 drive to broaden his popular base
 of support.   "Independence"--pre-
 sumably from the US---is the watch-
 word,  although the government has
 taken this tack in public pro-
 nouncements far more firmly than
 it has in private.   Some key pol-
 icy shifts have occurred.   For
 example,  the government has
 turned its back on establishing
 an Inter-American Peace Force.
 Costa e Silva has also won con-
 siderable domestic approval with
 his impassioned defense of Brazil's
 "right" to the advantages of nu-
 clear technology and his call for
 the formation of a Latin American
 atomic community.
 The government's  "new look"
 in foreign and domestic policy
 has not yet developed sufficiently
 to form a definitive pattern.   It
 is becoming clearer, however,  that
 US-Brazilian relations, while re-
 maining good,  are likely to diverge
 more frequently as  the Costa e
 25X1
 Silva administration strives to at-
 tract domestic support.

 DOMINICAN PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL POSITION WEAKENING
 Increasing right-wing dis-
 satisfaction with Dominican Presi-
 dent Balaguer has led to renewed
 rumors of antigovernment plotting.
 Dissidents are not yet capable of
 seriously threatening the govern-
 ment, but Balaguer's political
 position continues to erode.
 Luis Amiama Tio's resignation
 as minister of interior and police
 last week has contributed to the
 unease.   Many political factions
 had viewed him as a counterweight
 to "trujillista" elements in the
 government.   The leader of the
 Social Christians,  for example,
 said that the replacement of
 Amiama with another prominent
 "anti-t:rujillista" was vital to
 national stability.
 Balaguer's appointment of
 Carlos Goico Morales to the post
 did not stem the discontent. Goico
 is a long-time friend of the
 President and is considered a good
 administrator, but he served in
 Trujillo's cabinet and has been
 described as one of the dictator's
 "foremost panegyrists."   Another
 of Balaguer's personnel actions
 that stirred strong private criti-
 cism was his reinstatement of one
 of Trujillo's most feared and
 brutal police officers, one-time
 colonel. Carlos Herrand Blyden.
 Rightists are continuing to
 exploit the "trujillista"  issue
 to gain a wider following.   Some
 are reported to be talking of the
 need for an "Argentina-type"
 military take-over to solve the
 country's problems while others
 are promoting an "anti-trujillista,
 anti-Communist Dominican Freedom
 Front."  The coup rumors, as well
 as allegations that the US has
 withdrawn support from Balaguer,
 may originate with rightist ele-
 ments which hope to undermine
 confidence in the regime.
 One danger in the current
 situation is that Dominican mod-
 erates--who often sit on the
 political sidelines--will seek to
 disassociate themselves from the
 government.   Indicative of this
 possibility was an editorial in
 the respected Santo Domingo daily,
 Listin Diario, which noted that
 much of the public was preoccupied
 with the reasons behind Amiama's
 resignation.   It said that Bala-
 guer's "loyalty to primitive ele-
 ments" in the government, as well
 as their official conduct gave
 opponents a pretext to act.   The
 paper called on Balaguer to use
 his authority to "create public
 confidence" that the government
 will not tolerate repression and
 violence.
 Balaguer has promised a public
 response to Amiama's resignation
 and in it he will probably address
 his other critics.   In the past
 Balaguer has tended to explain
 away much criticism--whether well   25X1
 intentioned or not--as designed
 to discredit the government.

 LABOR UNREST AND MILITARY DISCONTENT IN ECUADOR
 Strikes and strike threats
 continue to plague the government
 of interim president Otto Arose-
 mena.   Public employees struck
 for 36 hours last week to protest
 a measure before the constituent
 assembly that would eliminate some
 400 government jobs for budgetary
 reasons. The strike ended on
 28 April after the assembly agreed
 to observe civil service regula-
 tions regarding a reduction of
 force, but the government did not
 capitulate to the strikers'  demand
 that the measure be shelved.
 The Telecommunications
 Workers'  Union  (FENETEL)  walked
 out on 27 April to protest alleged
 government inaction on a FENETEL-
 proposed bill that would create a
 government-owned communications
 monopoly.   Communications were
 virtually paralyzed throughout the
 country for a day,  and there were
 some acts of sabotage against
 telegraph lines and communications
 equipment.   The FENETEL strike
 has been suspended pending further
 assembly action.
 In addition to the public
 employees strike and that of
 FENETEL,  a number of other minor
 strikes occurred throughout the
 country.   For the most part these
 have been settled or suspended,
 but additional walkouts involving
 banana workers and railway workers
 are scheduled during the next few
 weeks.
 Military grumbling against
 the government and the constituent
 assembly is increasing.   Junior
 officers in particular are annoyed
 because the assembly has allowed
 some of its members--such as ex-
 president Carlos Julio Arosemena--
 to harass and denigrate the armed
 forces.   The officers were also
 perturbed that the government,  the
 military high command, and the
 armed forces delegate to the as-
 sembly, General Banderas, did not
 defend the military in the face
 of these attacks.   On 26 April
 Banderas spoke out strongly in
 the assembly for retaining in the
 new constitution the president's
 power to use the armed forces to
 maintain internal order.   His
 speech and the lessening of labor
 tensions have cooled tempers, but
 a residue of discontent remains.

 HAITIAN PRESIDENT SQUELCHES INCIPIENT PLOT
 President Duvalier relieved
 a number of presidential guard
 officers of their duties last
 week and reassigned them to posts
 outside Port-au-Prince.   No reason
 was given for the transfers, but
 it appears that Duvalier acted
 to head off a palace intrigue that
 may have involved members of his
 own family.
 This is the first time that
 Duvalier has been known to have
 removed any officer from his
 elite Presidential guard.   One
 of the officers transferred,
 Jose "Sonny" Borges, was one of
 the regime's leading propagan-
 dists.   He had been in charge of
 the government radio station and
 was reportedly very close to
 Duvalier.
 Approved For Release 20Q
 Duvalier's moves may have
 been set off by a dispute within
 the president's family--specific-
 ally between his sons-in-law, the
 ambitious presidential guard of-
 ficer Max Dominique and Director
 of Tourism Luc Foucard.   Some of
 the presidential guard officers
 who were transferred were close
 to Dominique, suggesting that
 Duvalier acted to clip his wings.
 Suspected plotters have
 been removed from Port-au-Prince
 and separated from each other,
 thereby diminishing any immediate
 danger they may have posed to
 Duvalier.   The president retains
 one of his strongest weapons, his
 ability to provide funds for his
 personal power structure, but
 some plotting can be expected to
 continue.                                  25X1

 KENNEDY ROUND
 KENNEDY ROUND APPROACHES FINAL BARGAINING
 Four years of Kennedy Round
 negotiations are nearing their end.
 Final agreement must be reached
 shortly if the necessary documents
 are to be drawn up before 30 June,
 when the President's authority under
 the 1962 Trade Expansion Act expires.
 Differences,  primarily between
 the US and EEC,  are still to be re-
 solved, however, before the final
 "package"--containing a reasonable
 balance of concessions among all
 the major participants--can be com-
 pleted.  If differences remain,  there
 could be a general withdrawal of
 concessions already offered and a
 drastic "unraveling"  of the liber-
 alization of trade which the whole
 undertaking was designed to achieve.
 The Common Market's position
 on agriculture is a major problem
 in large part because it does not
 provide adequate assurance that US
 grains will have continued access
 to the EEC market.   The EEC has
 tentatively accepted the idea of a
 world food-aid program for the less
 developed countries as one way to
 dispose of surpluses, but the actual
 amount of such aid the Six may be
 willing to finance will be small.
 Moreover,  the Community insists on
 including feed grains in any cereals
 agreement--a provision which could
 undercut the competitive advantage
 of the US in this area.   EEC "offers"
 on other agricultural products are
 also meager.
 On the industrial side, the ma-
 jor issue has been the EEC's insist-
 ence that all its proposed reductions
 in chemical tariffs be contingent
 on the US' abandoning a tariff valu-
 ation procedure--American Selling
 Price (ASP)--which substantially in-
 creases the prices of certain im-
 ported chemicals.   The US is willing
 to request congressional authority
 to abandon ASP, but holds that it
 could not show Congress a "balanced"
 package if all the EEC's offers on
 chemicals are conditional.   Thus
 each side uses grains and chemicals
 as a gage of the other's willingness
 to liberalize agricultural and in-
 dustrial trade, respectively.   It
 may not be until the final bargain-
 ing sessions that an attempt will
 be made,  if at: all,  to trade off
 concessions in one area for those
 in the other.
 The EEC Council met again early
 this week to consider the commis-
 sion's latest report on the status
 of the negotiations,  and the commis-
 sion is reported to have been given
 additional leeway to try to meet
 the US demand for a "two-package"
 approach on chemicals.   It is likely;
 however,  that the commission will
 continue to seek some softening in
 the US position on agriculture,  and
 any deal will still be subject to
 council endorsement.
 The commission is in a position;.
 of great responsibility again.   It
 will try to present the council next
 week with "nearly final" deals
 reached in Geneva,  figuring that
 none of the Six want to risk an in-
 ternal Community crisis at that
 point over disagreement on the EEC's
 offered concessions.
