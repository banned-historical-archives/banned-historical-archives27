 Vietnam's successful 1984-85 dry-season campaign along the Thai-
 Cambodian border, resulting conditions on both sides of that border,
 and  subsequent  diplomatic statements and  maneuvers by  Hanoi,
 ASEAN, and China are all indicators of new realities in Indochina. This
 Estimate examines these conditions and maneuvers, the probable course
 of events, as well as less likely alternatives.

 Capabilities and Order of Battle of Vietnamese Forces tin Cambodia, is

 KEY JUDGMENTS
 Vietnam is determined that the situation in Cambodia be resolved
 on its own terms. Before significantly reducing its troop strength in
 Cambodia, Hanoi will insist that both Cambodia and Laos heed its
 direction and leadership under the rubric of "special relationship." We
 believe that it will not hesitate to wield a heavy hand if either smaller
 country demonstrates too much independence, especially in foreign
 affairs.
 Hanoi believes a cohesive Indochina under its domination is a
 geopolitical imperative if it is to avoid being swallowed by what it views
 as a historically expansionist China.
 If Hanoi achieves its objectives in Cambodia, one potential casualty
 would be the current congruence of Chinese and US interests opposing
 Vietnamese hegemony in Indochina; this could adversely affect the
 broader aspects of US-Chinese relations.
 Vietnam has said that the Cambodian problem will be solved and
 its troops withdrawn within the next five years. Hanoi appears confi-
 dent that the destruction of the resistance forces' bases in the last two
 years has laid the groundwork for the demise of the resistance. For
 Hanoi this is a serious timetable, not merely propaganda or wishful
 thinking.
 There is little chance,  however,  that  Heng  Samrin's  People's
 Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) regime will be able to fend for itself any
 time soon. Morale remains fragile, political reliability is often suspect,
 and technical and tactical proficiency are low.
 Accordingly, our iudgment, based on present trends, is that Hanoi
 has a better than even chance of achieving a de facto solution of the
 Cambodian problem by 1990. Significant Vietnamese force reduction
 would be possible, although a substantial military presence will still be
 required for joint anti-insurgent operations and a large contingent of
 civilian advisers will be used to oversee the Heng Samrin apparatchiks.
 We believe that the resistance forces will not resolve either their in-
 ternal leadership problems or their difficult relations with each other.
 The resistance and its supporters are united only in the goal of
 bringing about a Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia. On other
 aspects of the issue, motivations differ and often collide:
 - The  non-Communist  KPNLF  and  ANS  are  concerned  lest
 Cambodia lose its identity.

 - The Communist Khmer Rouge agree, but are focused more on
 regaining exclusive power in Cambodia.
 - ASEAN, too, seeks Vietnam's withdrawal; however, Indonesia
 sees Indochina as Vietnam's natural sphere of influence, while
 Thailand, Singapore, and, to a lesser extent, Malaysia take a
 hard line that aims at making the KPNLF and ANS forces
 competitive with the Khmer Rouge for control of a postoccupa-
 tion Cambodia.
 -China opposes Vietnam's hegemony in Indochina (seen, in part,
 as a plan by the Soviets to encircle China) and supports the
 Khmer Rouge as the best means of forcing Vietnam to compro-
 mise on Cambodia.
 We believe there is an even chance that over the next five years a
 falling out with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea
 (CGDK), a particularly tempting offer from Phnom Penh, or merely
 recognition of his own mortality could lead Prince Sihanouk to make se-
 rious contact with his Vietnamese-backed adversaries in an effort to
 engineer a rapid compromise solution.
 In our judgment, China, while it will continue to support the
 resistance forces and apply military pressure on Vietnam itself, will not
 chance the extreme degree of  direct offensive action against the
 Vietnamese that would compel them to alter their Cambodia strategv
 The Soviets will continue to provide military and economic support
 to Vietnam in order to sustain the alliance and assure continued access
 to Cam Ranh Bay, and as a means of applying pressure on the Chinese
 regardless of changes in the atmosphere of Sino-Soviet relations.
 Furthermore, we believe that Vietnam is more determined and
 steadfast over the long run than Thailand and its ASEAN partners. Most
 important in its calculation is the assumption that the resolve of its
 ASEAN opponents, especially Thailand, will weaken over time and with
 the introduction of new leaders who lack a stake in current policy.
 While we do not anticipate outright rupture of the ASEAN front on
 Cambodia, consensus will be more difficult to maintain.
 A settlement that left Communist administration in Phnom Penh,
 in our judgment, could lead a significant proportion of the 230,000
 displaced Khmer now in encampments inside Thailand to elect not to
 return to their country.

 1.  Vietnam  is  determined  that  the  situation  in
 Cambodia be resolved on its own terms. Its fundamen-
 tal objective in Cambodia is to have a government
 responsive  to  its  direction  and  free  of  any  other
 significant external influence, particularly from China
 or Thailand.  Hanoi  believes a cohesive  Indochina
 under its domination is a geopolitical imperative if it is
 to avoid  being swallowed  by  what  it  views as a
 historically expansionist China.
 2. Hanoi has made a huge investment in Cambodia,
 and we believe that before it is willing to consider
 compromise seriously it will have to be assured that its
 investment is protected. In general terms this means
 essential control over Cambodia (and Laos) with mini-
 mum practicable visibility.  We believe that before
 significantly reducing its troop strength in Cambodia
 Hanoi will insist that both Cambodia and Laos heed its
 direction and leadership under the rubric of "special
 relationship." In our judgment, it will not hesitate to

 4. Hanoi appears confident that the destruction of

 the coming years. Hanoi has set 1987 as the date for

 are in fundamental agreement on the goal of bringing
 about a Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia. But
 each party has motivations that at times collide with
 one or more of the others'.
 7. The non-Communist reststance  groups  under
 Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk are concerned about
 the prospect that Cambodia will soon lose its identity
 as a  nation.  Neither believes an outright  military
 victory over Vietnam is realistic, but both believe that
 increasing military pressure must be applied in order
 to convince Hanoi of the need to compromise. They
 believe they have potentially widespread popularsup-
 port throughout Cambodia, but must receive increased
 and sustained external support in order to exploit it.
 Both groups are deeply concerned about their ability
 to compete with the Khmer Rouge and agree on the
 need to prevent its return to power in the event of a
 Vietnamese withdrawal.
 8. The Khmer Rouge has the same fundamental
 goal as its non-Communist counterparts of preventing
 the "Vietnamization" of Cambodia. But while it nomi-
 nally cooperates with the non-Communist groups in
 the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea,
 and has made a series of efforts to present a more
 moderate image,  we believe the Khmer Rouge still
 envisions a return to exclusive power. This would be
 accomplished, not by military victory over Vietnam,
 but by a power struggle among Cambodian factions
 following a Vietnamese pullout. In the meantime, the
 Khmer Rouge iealously safeguards its "liberated areas"

 land's borders, but is deeply worried about the long-
 term orosnects for subversive action if Hanoi is al-

 expand influence in the Cambodian interior.
 9. ASEAN's goal is to secure Vietnamese withdraw-
 al Erom Cambodia and the holding of popular elec-
 tions under international auspices. It has relied pri-
 marily  on  diplomatic  pressure  through  yearly
 resolutions passed by overwhelming margins by the
 UN  General Assembly in efforts to isolate Hanoi.
 ASEAN opposition has also thwarted Hanoi's efforts to
 unseat the CGDK at the UN. In June 1982, ASEAN
 prevailed on the three resistance groups to form a loose
 coalition in order to attract and sustain international
 backing for anti-Vietnamese Forces.
 10.  While ASEAN has been successful in sustaining
 a broad consensus against Vietnam's Cambodia policy,
 differing perspectives within its ranks have frequently
 served to undermine its effectiveness. A "soft line"
 faction led by Indonesia essentially assumes that Indo-
 china is Vietnam's natural sphere of influence and, in
 fact, serves as a useful buffer against a potentially
 greater threat from China. Elements in the Malaysian
 13. China itself remains steadfast in its opposition
 to Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia. Beijing not only
 opposes a rival power center that a united Indochina
 would represent, but also seeks to blunt Moscow's use
 of Vietnam in its purported strategy of encirclement
 of China. Beiiing is the largest single material support-
 er of  all  three resistance groups,  but has aroused
 suspicion within ASEAN by providing the bulk of its
 aid to the Khmer Rouge. Beiiing has sought to counter-
 act these perceptions through public expressions of
 support for a future non-Communist Cambodia and
 by asserting that the imbalance in aid to the resistance
 parties is predicated solely on the greater effectiveness
 of the Khmer Rouge against the Vietnamese. Never-
 theless, China's continued heavy support of the Khmer
 Rouge has to some extent undermined ASEAN efforts
 to improve the relative capabilities of the non-Com-
 munist resistance.0
 14. China also applies continuous military pressure
 on Vietnam's northern border. By limiting its opera-
 tions mostly  to a single,  isolated salient,  however,

 the interior. The PRK government at the same time
 intensified psychological warfare operations to entice
 resistance supporters to the government's side

 Vietnamese Strategy
 Fighting .. .
 15. Hanoi has employed a mix of military intimida-
 tion and diplomatic guile since 1979 in attempting to
 gain acceptance of its control over Cambodia. But
 since early 1989 it has mounted the most determined
 and coherent combination yet of its "fight, fight, talk,
 talk" strategy to bring about a favorable and decisive
 outcome. The centerpiece of its strategy has been to
 gain an overwhelming military position against the
 three resistance groups in Cambodia. In this respect
 the 1984-85 military offensive was highly successful
 for the Vietnamese. The military situation has moved
 from stalemate to one in which the Vietnamese retain
 the strategic initiative. Thai border bases of each of
 the three resistance groups, whose forces have greatly
 increased since 1980, were destroyed or disrupted.
 Instead of pulling back the bulk of its forces to interior
 garrisons during the rainy season, as in previous years,
 the Vietnamese have conducted aggressive sweep op-
 erations in concert with PRK forces that have sharply
 restricted  resistance  efforts  to  exploit  the  tactical
 Beijing has signaled that forceful action on the scale of
 its 1979 invasion is not likely in the foreseeable future.
 Beijing's border posture requires Hanoi to keep ap-
 proximately half of its million-man army, armed with
 superior  Soviet  equipment,  committed  in  northern
 Vietnam. By the same token, however, those forces
 represent a  maior  deterrent  to large-scale Chinese
 attack ~~
 anoi   oyes t at t e net effect of these
 efforts will be the eventual destruction of the will and
 capability of  the  resistance and  its supporters to
 continue, while improving conditions for the PRK to
 consolidate its capabilities. n
 .. ,and Talking
 17. In the diplomatic arena, Hanoi has been equally
 assertive. Without yielding on any fundamental issues,
 it  has sought to build on  its military position by
 suggesting greater willingness and flexibility in seeking
 a diplomatic solution. The 1985-86 political offensive
 is designed to exploit the military success of 1984-85
 and to create the impression of an irreversible situa-
 tion in Cambodia. The  olitical offensive has several
 components, including:
 - Play  on  the  less  committed  members  of
 ASEAN-Indonesia and Malaysia-with an eye

 Probing ASEAN
 18. Hanoi has attempted to suggest that a process of
 dialogue on Cambodia has begun. A primary tactic has
 been to intensify efforts to split ASEAN by exploiting
 the differing perceptions within the group on how to
 deal with the Cambodia issue. Hanoi has concentrated
 particularly  on  detaching  Indonesia,  traditionally
 more accommodating toward Vietnam, from the rest
 of the group. (See inset on next page.) For example, it
 has tried to portray bilateral talks between Indonesian
 Foreign  Minister Mochtar and  Vietnamese  Foreign
 Minister Thach  in August  as part of  an  ASEAN-
 Indochina dialogue. Hanoi has also stepped up court-
 ing of Malaysia, which, although nominally a partici-
 pant in the hardline ASEAN Three grouping with
 Singapore and Thailand, has shown signs of receptive-
 ness to Vietnamese overtures.
 19. At the same time, Hanoi has taken a generally
 harsh approach toward Thailand, castigating Bangkok
 for  cooperating  with  China  in  aiding  the  Khmer
 Rouge and for allowing the resistance to use Thai
 territory. Through its Lao surrogate it has attempted to
 exploit a dispute involving three villages on the Thai-
 Laotian border to put Bangkok on the defensive in the
 UN and  embarrass  ASEAN  members  in  the Non-
 aligned Movement. There also are elements of overt
 intimidation in the increased frequency of Vietnamese

 The Jakarta Connection
 The flirtation between Indonesia and Vietnam has
 complex roots and takes several forms. At one level it is
 the product of supposedly similar post-World War II
 anticolonial experiences, resulting in a revolutionary
 kinship. Both countries, for different reasons, share the
 view of China as the maior long-term security threat to

 military intrusions into Thailand in pursuit of Khmer
 resistance forces. Hanoi is aware of the anxieties in
 some Thai quarters-government and private-over
 the increased risks and costs entailed in Thailand's
 continuing confrontational stance. Some Thai officials
 are concerned the Vietnamese will mount future cross-
 border incursions as a  means of accentuating such
 concerns.)
 Communist Versus Communist
 20. Despite an effort to appear more flexible, Hanoi
 has remained consistent in its outlook toward the role
 of the Khmer Rouge. The minimum Vietnamese goal
 is the end of the Khmer Rouge as a political and
 military  entity,  including,  but  not  limited to,  the
 "elimination of Pol Pot and his accomplices."'  We
 believe Hanoi would be willing to co-opt current
 Khmer Rouge Communists, other than the top leaders,
 iust as it did former Khmer Rouge Communists such as
 Heng Samrin and Hun Sen. Indeed, Hanoi says rank
 and file Khmer Rouge would be welcome if they
 renounce their ties to the group
 enduring threat to its national security.
 21. The  depth  of  Hanoi's  conviction  about  the
 Khmer Rouge issue is hard to overstate. Aside from the
 brutal border attacks that were the casus Belli for the
 Vietnamese invasion, the group is seen by Hanoi as an
 instrument of China's strategy to keep Vietnam weak.
 From Hanoi's standpoint, to accede to survival of the
 Khmer Rouge in any meaningful Eorm would risk an
 22. Both China and the Khmer Rouge itself oppose
 Hanoi's attempts to remove Pol Pot and other top
 leaders. Although little is known of a "second genera-
 tion" Khmer Rouge leadership, we believe the depar-
 ture of  the existing leadership  would  have  maior
 repercussions for a movement whose cohesion is al-
 ready suspect. Aside from any efforts by Hanoi to
 undermine the group, the ability of the Khmer Rouge
 to maintain internal discipline as current top leaders
 Heng Samrin's PRK: Nurturing a Puppet
 23. Hanoi continues to nurture the slow develop-
 ment of the PRK regime and army. The regime has
 demonstrated scant capacity for self-governance thus
 far, and there is little evidence that Hanoi has begun
 to wean it from dependence on the Vietnamese advi-
 sory presence that makes or approves most maior
 decisions.

 poorly and remain weak and politically unreliable.

 will be able to fend for itself any time soon. Morale

 fore carried out by Vietnamese forces.
 However, there is evidence of modest headway. [n the
 past two years, at least one new PRK division has been
 created, armor and artillery units have become opera-
 tional, MIG aircraft and pilots have been readied for
 service,  and  several small  naval  craft  have been
 delivered. Provincial military units and local militias
 have been organized in many areas of the countryside.
 Main-force units deployed in border areas have seen
 increasing frontline duty and are being groomed to
 assume many of the anti-insurgency functions hereto-
 27. Hanoi apparently agrees with Mochtar's assess-
 ment of the US factor. Hanoi has made explicit its
 interest in normalization, and in that connection has
 recently made sudden gestures of cooperation on the
 POW/MIA  issue.  In  our  judgment,  Vietnam  will
 continue to attempt to exploit this issue to create the
 illusion of broad-based progress toward US-Vietnam-
 ese normalization. For example, in a recent letter to
 about  a  hundred  countries  comprising  Vietnam's
 "close friends," Hanoi falsely claimed that a recent US
 mission to Hanoi resulted in progress on POW/MIAs
 and "other matters of mutual concern," when, in fact,
 only the former issue was raised by either side. Despite
 the inevitable US denial, Hanoi probably feels it has
 been able to add to the impression that the diplomatic
 tide is flowing its way, and we believe that it will
 continue to take advantage of such occasions in this
 effort would increase over time
 The US Factor
 26.  Both ASEAN and Hanoi see the United States as
 an  important  element  in  an  eventual  Cambodian
 settlement. On his own initiative, Mochtar has extend-
 ed the lure of normalization with Washington-the
 "new dimension" in his strategy-as Hanoi's reward
 for concrete measures to resolve the POW/MIA issue
 and compromise with ASEAN on Cambodia. Mean-
 while, the ASEAN hardliners-notably Singapore and
 Thailand-have  been  increasingly  vocal  in  urging
 increased US aid to the non-Communist resistance.
 Aside from its symbolic impact, Singapore views US
 aid as a useful counterweight to potentially excessive
 Chinese influence on Thailand. Both Singapore and
 Bangkok also hope an initially modest US support
 Seducing Sihanouk
 28. In mid-1984 the Vietnamese and Heng Samrin
 made  quiet  attempts  to  set  up  meetings  between
 CGDK President Sihanouk and PRK Foreign Minister
 Hun Sen in Paris. The Chinese and Sihanouk's CGDK
 partners vetoed such meetings, to the Prince's great
 agitation. Hanoi has since declared it will "never" talk
 with Sihanouk, but did not rule out contacts with his
 subordinates (such as his son Prince Ranarith)  or
 29. Sihanouk has publicly and repeatedly stated his
 distaste for  his  coalition  partners,  particularly  the
 Khmer Rouge, and his pessimism about the future
 toward which Cambodia is being taken. He has also
 repeatedly stated his belief that all Cambodian fac-
 tions, including that of Heng Samrin, must talk togeth-
 er; in that line he has recently proposed an interna-
 tional "colloquium" at which all four groups could be
 30.  We believe there is an even chance that over
 the next five years a falling out with the CGDK, a
 particularly  tempting offer from  Phnom  Penh,  or
 merely recognition of his own mortality could lead
 Sihanouk to make serious contact with his Vietnamese-
 backed adversaries in an effort to engineer a rapid
 compromise solution.  However,  the actions of  the
 volatile Prince, who has switched sides in previous
 Indochinese conflicts, are always difficult to predict.
 The Sino-Soviet Calculus
 31. The strategic benefits that the Soviets derive
 from their relationship with Hanoi, including the use
 of facilities at Cam Ranh Bay, will continue to take
 precedence over any inducements Bening is likely to
 offer. Nevertheless, the one political contingency that
 would impact sharply on Vietnam would be a dra-
 matic further improvement in Sino-Soviet relations,
 accomplished at Vietnam's expense, a factor which
 Hanoi may worry about but which we believe is
 unlikely during the next two to three years. In any
 event, Hanoi's mistrust of Moscow's long-term reliabil-
 ity will provide an additional incentive for Hanoi to
 resolve the Cambodia issue as early as practicable.
 32. Hanoi has made      overtures
 to Beijing to begin talks and has tried to convey an

 SECRET
 overall impression of improved relations with China
 despite  Beijing's  resection of its overtures. On the
 military front, Vietnam seems confident that it can
 absorb and contain the costs China imposes on its
 Cambodian policy. We believe Hanoi has calculated
 that its own defensive measures and Beijing's preoccu-
 pation with economic development make it unlikely
 that China will mount a "second lesson" similar to its
 invasion  in  1979.  This  permits Hanoi  considerable
 leeway in pursuing its strategy in Cambodia.
 Can the Resistance Reverse the Tide?
 33. Hanoi's strategy has not only been an immedi-
 ate setback to the resistance, but poses an increased
 obstacle to Future efforts by the latter to develop and
 sustain guerrilla warfare. The Khmer Rouge have been
 relatively successful in transferring the locus of the
 fighting from the Thai border area to the interior since
 early this year. Most of their able-bodied troops have
 moved into the provinces and carried out an active
 guerrilla campaign against highways, railroads, local
 their attacks do not appear to have provoked major
 adjustments in Vietnamese and PRK defenses.
 34. The Khmer Rouge will retain their dominance
 within the resistance and will remain a security threat
 in many areas of the countryside. However, the group
 is not likely to threaten seriously Vietnam's strategic
 advantage. There has been no solid evidence of growth
 in Khmer Rouge ranks in the past year or two, and
 recruitment efforts probably do little more than re-
 place losses, if that. There are also occasional signs of
 dissent within the group, but the leadership has man-
 aged to prevent significant erosion in overall disci-
 pline.
 35. Non-Communist troops have had little success
 in implementing their announced strategy of waging
 guerrilla warfare deep in the Cambodian interior.
 Although both the ANS and the KPNLF have plans for
 infiltrating well over half of their forces into Cam-
 bodia by the end of the year, their record thus far
 suggests they will Eall well short of that goal. Vietnam-
 ese sweeps, combined with their own internal limita-
 tions,  have limited most non-Communist forays to
 areas little beyond traditional zones of operation along
 the border.
 36. Aside from the military obstacles facing the
 non-Communists, they have severe internal deficien-
 cies. The KPNLF, in particular, is racked by factional-
 ism that has directly contributed to the inability of the
 group to mount a systematic guerrilla warfare effort.
 Fundamental questions persist regarding the morale
 and motivation of KPNLF soldiers and of those com-
 manders who have lost access to lucrative black mar-
 kets and have displayed little interest in the rigors of
 guerrilla warfare
 37. The ANS forces, thanks to more capable lead-
 ers, have made surprising headway over the past year
 and have surpassed the KPNLF in military effective-
 ness. They have also mounted systematic infiltration
 efforts and developed contacts with the local populace.
 But they also are troubled by internal rivalries, and
 Vietnamese pressure as well as Khmer Rouge harass-
 ment has kept them offguard and limited the depth
 39. The  same  constraints  that  impede  progress
 against the Vietnamese also offer little hope that the
 non-Communists can close the gap in effectiveness and
 influence with the Khmer Rouge.  The latter have
 demonstrated repeatedly, despite pressure from China
 and Thailand to desist, that they will directly oppose
 non-Communist efforts to expand operations signifi-
 cantly, particularly when they move into areas the

 Khmer Rouge consider to be their turf. Non-commu-
 nist leaders complain of "having to fight the Vietnam-
 ese with one hand and the Khmer Rouge with the
 other." There is little reason to believe this fundamen-
 tal dilemma can be resolvedP
 40. Inability of the non-Communists over atwo- or
 three-year period to improve their standing relative to
 the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge would be likely to
 have severe implications for non-Communist morale.
 Both Prince Sihanouk and his son Prince Ranarith are
 pessimistic  over  resistance  military  prospects-con-
 tinued inertia and military setbacks would raise the
 risk that they would abandon the effort. ~~
 Outlook
 Vietnam in the Driver's Seat .. .
 41. Our judgment, based on present trends, is that
 Hanoi has a better than even chance of achieving de
 facto solution of the Cambodian problem by 1990. We
 believe that the Vietnamese will be able to seriously
 restrict resistance guerrilla activity and prevent the
 establishment of liberated areas. At the same time we
 believe that the resistance forces will not resolve either
 their internal leadership problems or their difficult
 relations with each other. Significant Vietnamese force
 reductions would be possible, although a substantial
 military presence albeit disguised in some way, will
 still be required for ioint anti-insurgent operations and
 a large contingent of civilian advisers will be used to
 oversee the Heng Samrin apparatchiks. We note that
 in Laos there are roughly 45,000 Vietnamese troops
 and several thousand civilian advisers. The residual
 Vietnamese presence in Cambodia probably would not
 be less than this.
 42.  [n our judgment, China, while it will continue
 to support the resistance forces and apply military
 pressure on Vietnam itself, will not chance the ex-
 treme degree of direct offensive action against the
 Vietnamese that would compel them to alter their
 Cambodia strategy. The Soviets will continue to pro-
 vide military and economic support to Vietnam in
 order to sustain the alliance and assure access to Cam
 Ranh Bay, and as a means of applying pressure on the
 Chinese regardless of changes in the atmosphere of
 A situation in which the Khmer Rouge sustained or widened the
 gap with the non-Communists would also threaten ASEAN unity.
 Although Thailand and Singapore would probably want to continue
 their aid in order to keep the non-Communist option alive as long as
 possible, Malaysia might be persuaded by Vietnam's claims [hat
 further opposition is futile.~~
 43. The primary factor underlying these judgments is
 our estimation that Vietnam is more determined to
 accomplish its primary obiectives in Cambodia than any
 other non-Khmer party to the affair, and has a greater
 investment to  protect.  By  Hanoi's security calculus,
 Cambodia is simply too important to permit compromise
 on fundamental issues. Specifically, we believe Vietnam
 is more determined and steadfast over the long run than
 Thailand and its ASEAN partners, and has a greater
 investment to protect than does China.0
 44. It is our judgment that Vietnam will attempt to
 reduce its presence to the extent consistent with the
 security situation. In this connection we believe that
 Hanoi calculates it can contain damage done by the
 resistance and ultimately demoralize it through a
 combination of internal security operations and border
 interdiction, while building up the Heng Samrin ad-
 ministration to a semblance of a functioning govern-
 ment. Most important in its calculations, however, is
 the assumption that the resolve of its ASEAN oppo-
 nents, especially Thailand, will weaken over time and
 with the introduction of new leaders without a stake in
 the current policy.0
 45. Under these circumstances, Indonesia and per-
 haps Malaysia would probably attempt increasingly to
 dilute ASEAN's position and reach a political compro-
 mise, particularly if Hanoi continues its current osten-
 sibly flexible diplomatic line. ASEAN's stance would
 be undermined if Sihanouk or Son Sann abruptly
 reconciled  with  the  PRK  regime.  A  softening  of
 Thailand's position toward Vietnam would also result
 in a rapid reformulation of ASEAN policy. Such a
 Thai policy shift could occur by 1990 if, for example,
 there  were  a  new  government  in  Bangkok  or  if
 Cambodia became a divisive domestic issue.  We do
 not anticipate outright rupture of the ASEAN front on
 the Cambodia issue. Nevertheless, the ASEAN consen-
 sus will be more difficult to maintain.~~
 ...but WithouT a SeatbelT
 46. Alternatively, several incipient problems could
 dim  Vietnam's  prospects.  For  example,  while  we
 believe the Vietnamese are aware of the implications
 of the historical animosity the Khmer feel for them,
 their continued presence over the next few years could
 cause widespread popular resentment leading to active
 support for resistance.  This could be the result of
 Vietnamese civilian settlement in Cambodia, as well as
 the military presence. Another factor is the continued
 conscription of thousands of Khmer laborers to con-
 struct barriers in hostile and malaria-ridden areas of
 the Cambodia-Thailand border.n

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/08 :CIA-RDP87T00495R001001040001-4
 SECRET
 47. We cannot rule out the possibility that the
 CGDK resistance forces could solve their leadership
 and image problems and galvanize the Khmer people
 into more active opposition to the Vietnamese occupa-
 tion. This might occur through death or resignation of
 some of the more controversial figures in both the non-
 communist and DK factions, or by leverage exerted
 by aid donors.
 48. Finally, and least likely, the Sixth Congress of
 the Communist Party of Vietnam, reportedly sched-
 uled for spring 1986, could  produce a new  set of
 leaders in Hanoi who would be concerned more with
 development issues than with the overamplified secu-
 rity concerns represented by the Cambodian venture.
 Such leaders would presumably be quicker to make
 concessions and withdraw from Cambodia.'
 Implications of a Vietnamese-
 Controlled Cambodia
 49. Implications of  a successful  consolidation of
 Vietnamese control over Cambodia would depend
 largely on the manner in which it was achieved. For
 illustration we postulate two basic scenarios-one a
 contentious process in which ASEAN unity disinte-
 grates and Hanoi gets its way largely by default; and
 the other a  Eace-saving formula that would allow
 ASEAN a graceful means of ending its opposition and
 formally accepting a Vietnamese fait accompli.C
 50. For ASEAN, dissipation of the political consen-
 susthat has been the most effective obstacle to Hanoi's
 goals in Cambodia would significantly undercut the
 organization's international political stature.  Agree-
 ment on Cambodia has been ASEAN's most powerful
 rallying  point  since  1979.  A  bitter  split  between
 ASEAN softliners and hardliners over Cambodia could
 adversely affect economic and political cooperation in
 the  region,  but  a  sustained  disruption  in  ASEAN
 relations would be unlikely. Collapse of the consensus
 on Cambodia could lead Thailand to "go it alone,"
 with China and Singapore providing some support for
 the resistance for a time, but the loss of the ASEAN
 diplomatic stand could also lead to domestic pressure
 on Thai policvmakers to reach an accommodation
 with Vietnam. While the breakdown of a consensus
 over Cambodia and the ultimate playing out of an
 accommodation with Hanoi could contribute to in-
 ' While the emergence of a Vietnamese Deng Xiaoping cannot be
 disrnunted, our best estimate a[ [his time is that [he next generation
 of leaders in Hanoi, heavily influenced by the Soviets and lacking
 the revolutionary ethos of the current group. will be a[ least as rigid
 creased inter-ASEAN suspicions,  it  is doubtful that
 existing bilateral differences would be allowed to
 fester. Each ASEAN member has a vested interest in
 regional security and the broad variety of regional
 contacts should help to smooth over differences re-
 garding relations with the Vietnamese
 51. A more likely scenario is that ASEAN, led by
 Indonesia and Malaysia, would gradually ease into a
 face-saving accommodation that recognized Vietnam's
 dominance in Cambodia and permitted ASEAN to
 contain damage to both its external image and internal
 viability. Thailand, however, as the "frontline state" in
 ASEAN,  would  require  continuing  reassurances of
 support from fellow members in dealing with a con-
 solidated  Indochina.  A withdrawal  of  Vietnamese
 troops-almost  certainly  a  prerequisite  for  any
 ASEAN-Vietnamese deal-would go far in assuaging
 Bangkok's concern, but Thailand's fears over long-
 term Vietnamese subversive efforts would require
 attention by ASEAN.
 52. China  would  probably  continue  to  oppose
 Hanoi's policies in Indochina regardless of a general
 acceptance by others of  Vietnam's dominion over
 Cambodia. Beiiing's leverage, however, would be re-
 stricted. Bening would find it difficult, if not impos-
 sible, to sustain Thai cooperation in supporting Cam-
 bodian resistance forces at current levels. Although
 sympathetic Thai officials might be amenable to a
 modest aid program for resistance elements, Beiiing's
 opportunities for increasing military pressure on the
 Vietnamese and PRK would be sharply circumscribed.
 Removal of the Cambodia issue as a common cause
 with ASEAN would slow the overall diplomatic head-
 way Bening has made in Southeast Asia over the past
 few years. Bening would also weigh Vietnam's degree
 of involvement with the Soviet Union in determining
 its policy toward Indochina
 53. For the USSR, broad acceptance of a Vietnam-
 ese  Eait  accompli  in  Cambodia,  particularly  one
 reached on amicable terms, would improve its pros-
 pects for developing closer ties to Southeast Asian
 states. Moscow, however, would probably have diffi-
 culty in exploiting such a turn of events to improve
 relations with China. Beijing would probably make
 new demands of Moscow to reduce support for Hanoi
 in hopes of promoting a split between the Vietnamese
 and Soviets
 54.  Vietnamese success could over the longer term
 reduce Hanoi's dependence on Soviet assistance and
 consequently reduce Moscow's political leverage there.
 Eventually, Moscow's use of Vietnamese military facil-
 12
 SECRET
 25X1
 hies might be curtailed. On balance, however, we
 believe the Soviets' broader interests are best served by
 resolution of the Cambodian conflict on Hanoi's terms.
 Implications for the United States
 55. IE the ASEAN consensus broke down as Hanoi
 imposed its solution, the United States would face
 pressure  to  take sides  with  the  opposing  ASEAN
 members. There could be recriminations from Singa-
 pore and Thailand over US reluctance to provide
 military aid to the non-Communist resistance. Indone-
 sia and Malaysia, on the other hand, might look to the
 United States to persuade the hardliners to compro-
 mise.  Thailand,  with support  from  Singapore and
 Malaysia, would seek stronger US security guarantees
 and greater arms assistance. Under a settlement for-
 mula  acceptable  to  ASEAN  the  way  would  be
 smoothed for eventual normalization of US-Vietnam-
 prospects for resolving other issues.
 56. A potential casualty of such a turn of events
 would be the current congruence of Chinese and US
 interest in opposing Hanoi's policy. Given its funda-
 mental strategic concerns over an  entrenched  Viet-
 namese control of Indochina, Beiiing would not be
 likely to accept US rationale for increasing dealings
 with Hanoi and would seek new ways to prevent
 Hanoi from gaining its ends.
 57. However achieved, a settlement in Cambodia
 that left a Communist administration in Phnom Penh
 would, in our judgment, lead a significant proportion
 of the 230,000 displaced Khmer now in encampments
 inside Thailand to elect not to return to their country,
 This would create pressure on the UN system and its
 donor countries to continue indefinitely the relief
 program for these people, and would almost certainly
 generate Thai pressure on the United States to resettle

 The Capabilities and Order of Battle of Vietnamese Forces in Cambodia a
 We believe that the Vietnamese forces permanently
 based  in  Cambodia,  augmented  by  the  existing
 People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) forces, can
 accomplish most of the security missions that Hanoi
 envisions Eor its forces:
 - Demonstrating  control  of  the  border and  its
 environs to prevent establishment of a "liberated
 area" and  to  reduce levels of  infiltration by
 resistance forces.
 - Securing the Cambodian interior sufficiently to
 enhance the legitimacy of Heng Samrin's PRK
 regime and permit delegation to PRK Forces of a
 greater degree of  responsibility for rear area
 security.
 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia as of 1 September
 are estimated to number about 130,000 to 190,000.
 This new estimate, down from the previous one of
 150,000 to 170,000, reflects both mode         with-
 drawals and a reanalysis of existing data
 Vietnam has improved its logistic system in Cambo-
 dia to the point where there are no maior shortages of
 ammunition or petroleum products.
 Hanoi is dependent on Soviet military aid, which is
 abundant (Vietnam ranks seventh among Soviet aid
 recipients). We expect this level to continue-allowing
 some equipment modernization within the People's
 Army of Vietnam (PAVN), but not greatly increasing
 the capabilities of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia.
 Vietnam has said that it intends to withdraw from
 Cambodia by 1990. Although Hanoi probably would
 like to reduce its forces, we not only find this date
 unrealistic, but believe that Hanoi intends to maintain
 a sizable military presence in Cambodia indefinitely.
