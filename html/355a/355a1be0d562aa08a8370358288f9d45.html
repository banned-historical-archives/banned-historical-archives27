 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX      February 1,1,
 here said, to me. "If you want to call this
 light something else that is your privilege.
 But basically you are resisting the Chinese
 thrust for complete dominance of Asia, and
 I commend you for It.  You are the only r:a-
 Lion in the world with the guts and vigor to
 do it."
 I:oth hawks and doves agree that China is
 o' it, of the central issues of the war, and that
 lie Vietcong versus Vietnamese Governments
 struggle  is--relatively-a  side  issue.  The
 hawks are pressing for a direct confronta-
 Lion with China, some of them even hoping
 for an excluse to bomb out the Chinese :nu-
 clear facilities.  The doves feel that no mat-
 ter what we do. China in the year 2000 will
 clearly be the dominant power in Asia. as we
 are in the Western Hemisphere, and it is, a
 waste of money and lives to fight such a use-
 less fight
 The terrible thing is that both arguments
 are valid, and a choice between them is not
 simple.  A direct challenge to the Chinese
 would not be a simple matter of bombing
 a Comic facilities.  One would have to send
 in .,t land array to fight across China, and as
 Mao Tse-tung has pointed out, it would be
 almost impossible for us to field ate army
 large enough for victory.  We are, after all,
 almost completely alone in our current Asian
 policy.
 A 'he aa.sumption that China is interested
 only in consolidating its power in Asia as-
 sumes that it dedicated Communist revolu-
 tionary has a point at which he becomes
 sated.  It is inconceivable that the Chinese
 will launch a fleet of junks across the Pacific
 to storm ashore at San Diego.
 I sut the military strategists are also aware
 tlu;.t in a Jew years the Chinese will have the
 missiles  rec:uired  to  launch  their  atomic
 weapons,  and      when that clay  dawns,  the
 United States will be faced with an adversary
 tax more dangerous than Nikita Khrushcl.ev
 ever was.    'There is no indication that the
 younger generation of Chinese Communists,
 whose character was not formed in the long,
 bloody civil war with Chiang Kai-shek, are
 less hard, or less Chinese than the aging
 guerrillas head by Mao Tse-tung.
 It took the Russians 40 years to face the
 responsibilities of their power," one American
 political officer said.  "The Chinese are just
 starting t:o flex their musclies.   It's like a
 street fight.  The most dangerous kid on the
 block is usually the strong young kid who
 Chinks he's unbeatable."
 No one understands the Chinese thirst for
 expansion better than the Vietnamese, north
 arid south.    They fought the Chinese for
 almost 1,6Q0 years.  In his way, Ho Chi. Minh
 has done in astute job of holding them back
 even now.
 "Ho has played it very cagey," one Saigon
 political observer said. "He took all the help
 lie needed from the Chinese during the fight
 against the French, and used China as a
 rsasictuare.   But  he  never  allowed  North
 Vietnam to become       the kind  of outright
 satellite that say, Rumania, was.  The Viet-
 cong are taking the weapons from- China, and
 the political support.  They know that most
 Asians lair China, and they make that fear
 work for them.  But they also tell you that
 they will not have fought the Japanese, the
 French wid the Americans for 30 years just
 to let the Chinese march in."
 In some ways, the Vietcong in the south
 do not even trust Ito Chi Minh.  On at least
 three separate occasions the north has sold
 nut the southern revolution: in March 1946,
 when Ho made an agreement with the French
 that created a free state within the French
 Union, but left Cochin China (South Viet-
 nam) under absolute French rule; in Geneva,
 in 1954, when Ho accepted the cutoff at the
 17th parallel; and again in 1956 when North
 Vietnam made only feeble protests about the
 cancellation of the elections whir h were sup-
 posed to reunite the country.
 "Everyone thinks the war can be solved
 if the United States just sits down with the
 North Vietnamese," one Saigon official said.
 "Suppose the Vietcong say to boi h 'get lost'?
 What happens then?"
 The truth is that it is absurd to think
 of negotiating a solution to the war without
 making the Vietcong, and their Political arm,
 the National Liberation Front, a party to the
 proceedings.   They made the revolution-
 with  the                                                                                    support  of  North Vietnam  and
 China, to be sure--and they will have a say
 in how it ends.
 Unfortunately, the best we can expect from
 a negotiated settlement is a coali -ion govern-
 ment, and there is little doubt that such a
 government would become Communist in a
 matter of a, few years.  With China breathing
 hard upon all of them, there is little hope for
 any nation in southeast Asia to be truly inde-
 pendent.     They   might   be   sovereign,
 but no more independent than  stay, Guate-
 mala.                                                                             And our own chances id, trying to
 transform Ito Chi Minh into a kind of south-
 east Asian Tito withered In the erld war, and
 the missionary evangelism of   John Foster
 Dulles.  The history of our involvement in
 Vietnam, like that of China and Cuba, is a
 history of lost chances
 ~iu the hard choices in Vietnam are staring
 us in the face.  We can negott:ete a settle-
 ment, if the other side agrees finally to talk,
 and be prepared eventually to lose South
 Vietnam to a Communist government.  We
 can save face doing this; by agreeing to phase
 out our troops over a 3-year period while the
 coalition government  tries  to  govern the
 country   As it nation, we can then pull back
 to a more sensible commitment    n the world.
 We can concentrate on South America, on our
 own domestic running sores like slums and
 poverty.  We can give up the role of playing
 policemen to the world.
 But if we do that we must rec-arnize it as a
 kind  of  victory  for  China.   The  Chinese
 themselves are making this war into a war of
 Asians against white men.  We oust be very
 clear on that if we decide to negen.iate. China
 is holding up the Vietnamese exstnple to the
 rest of the world.  One more decade of in-
 competent. hopeless rule, and India could go
 to the Communists.   If Africa continues on
 its erratic path, the Communist.:; could take
 most of it.  The one thing comremnism does
 otter. after all, is stability.  It is the stability
 of the graveyard, but it you are rcarching for
 peace and quiet, Albania is the 1,i:e.ce to go.
 '.Chose who have studied the  situation do
 not believe' much in the domino theory, but
 they do feel that the Chinese Communists see
 the world power struggle as an extension of
 guerrilla, warfare.  In guerrilla warfare you
 isolate the enemy in the cities bt, taking over
 the countryside.     By extension, the conti-
 nental United States becomes the city, the
 underdeveloped world the countryside.   In
 those terns the Chinese threat, especially
 when it. achieves the means , f delivering
 atomic weapons, is a real one.
 So the second choice is to fight;.  If we de-
 cide the fight is worthwhile and that we can
 contain Chinese expanionism by making that
 fight in South Vietnam, then we must imme-
 diately snake the terms of the fig] it clear.  We
 must stop the pious rhetoric and the murky
 generalities.  We must tell the people of this
 country that young men will die in the next
 5 or 6 years as they have never died before.
 One military man in Saigon told me that we
 must be prepared to take 300,000 casualties,
 and possibly more.  We can hope that in the
 interim Ho Chi Minh and Mao Tse-tung will
 die; the Vietcong cause will lose popularity
 with the death of Ho; and the Chinese might
 become more tractable without Mao.
 Every military man I spoke to is apre.ed
 that the war will be bloody and long.  The
 popularity-of-the-war polls are running in
 favor of keeping the war going.  But most
 experts suspect that this is only because he
 war and its bloody possibilities have never
 been fully explained.
 The various plans for solving  he war, in-
 cluding the so-called Gavin plan,  are all
 based on an American pullout.  One can sit
 in enclaves and leave therest of South Viet-
 nam to the Vietcong until a peace of sorts
 can be negotiated.  Other plans call for figcrt-
 ing until the rebellion is crushed, as was
 done in Malaya, the Philippines, and Greece.
 Each is based on the belief that there are
 simple solutions to complex problems.
 As a reporter, I discovered in South Viet-
 nam that the world is never as simple it:; it
 seems when sitting at a typewriter in New
 York.  I don't like young men dy' rg.  I dent
 like the idea that my country is fighting to
 keep it corrupt, selfish, feudal society in pourer
 in a country whose citizens demand revolu-
 tion.                                                                                                                                    I wish for once we had joined a revolu-
 tion instead of fighting against it.
 But I would hate to have to explain to
 young men in 1980 that the reason we are
 about to engage the Chinese in ;i contest to
 destroy the world with nuclear arms  was
 because we walked away from a light ire 11,66.
 I do wish the cant and the lying would be
 removed from the discussion and that, we
 would be told some concrete truths about
 the war.  Perhaps if our Government would
 do that we could all decide clearly what we
 think should be done.  I don't really know.
 I do know that as you read this young me;n
 are dying.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPR:ESENTATIVIP;
 Wednesday, February Z, 1966
 Mr. TEAGUE of Texas.  Mr. Speaker,
 before the present Congress is adjourned,
 we will be called upon to consider and
 act on a number of pieces of legislation
 affecting labor and industry.  Under
 leave to extend my remarks I wish to
 include a copy of a letter written by a
 small independent businessman. Nantes
 and figures have been deleted, but the
 thoughts in the letter are worthwhile in
 light of the pending legislation:
 JANUARY  14, 1061
 I  have  just  returned  from                                                          New York,
 where, for a period of 10 days, I was for,,ed
 to experience the inconvenience and disccin-
 fort in connection with what wus probably
 the costliest and most unnecessary strike in
 the history of the city of New Yorlc.  If there
 had not already been a critical need for such
 a letter as this, going through the subway
 strike would certainly have provoked one.
 First of all, may I express my appreciation
 for the fact that you are our Congressman
 at large, and I find myself seldom if ever in
 disagreement with the stand you have taken
 on legislation.
 We are now in a new session of Congress,
 and if one would be influenced by President
 Johnson's  message  to  Congress,  it  world
 seem that a considerable portion of the legis-
 lation under consideration will be of a char-
 acter, which, if enacted, would :have :a dev-
 astating effect on smaller towns and smaller
 retailers, so disastrous, in fact that there is

 Women's Division, Miami Chamber of Com-
 merce.
 The club sponsored a 13-week traffic safety
 program on Channel 2 in 1958 and Edna Van
 Acker that year became Southeastern Re-
 gional Chairman of the Business and Pro-
 fessional Women's Clubs.-
 She previously had headed district 10 and
 the Florida Federation, which she also had
 served as scholarship chairman and member.
 ship chairman.  In her latter role she assisted
 in organizing 25 clubs in Florida, with a
 membership of more than 1,000 women.
 A BIRTHDAY HONOR; THE LEADING WOMEN OF
 MIAMI BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL WOMEN'S
 CLUB
 Business and professional women's club
 leaders have been heralded throughout the
 last half century in this community ever
 since the Mian)i BPW Club, was organized
 February 2, 1916.
 Miami Club will honor several of theirs at
 its 50th birthday party Saturday at Ever-
 glades Hotel including their first president,
 Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who has written
 many books that have brought her fame
 since that day when she took office.
 Mrs. Douglas, a former newspaperwoman,
 is author of "The Everglades, River of Grass,"
 "Road to the Sun," "Freedom River" and
 "Hurricane"  as  well  as  many  magazine
 stories.
 When the club's current leader, Florence
 McMahon (Mrs. Richard T.) Yoder left De-
 troit for Miami in 1956 she went back to
 college.  Two years later she graduated with
 honors from the 1 niversity of Miami, a
 bachelor of business administration.
 Mrs. Yoder began her business career run-
 ning a sewer. cleaning business.  Today she
 is external auditor for the Dade County Port
 Authority at Miami International Airport,
 employed by Morgan Altemus & Barrs, CPA
 firm.
 She is a member of Alpha Lambda Delta,
 Beta Sigma Phi, and Phi Kappa Phi.  Upon
 graduation from the university she received
 an award from the Florida Institute of Cer-
 tified                  Public  Accountants.   In      September
 1965 "Mac" married Richard Yoder of the
 Finance  Office, Urban Renewal Project in
 Dade County.
 One of the Miami club's past presidents,
 Mrs. Clara Caspar, will come all the way from
 Junction City, Kans., to attend the 50th
 birthday candlelight dinner.  She served her
 club in  1941-42  and was the first of its
 World War II leaders.  She saw her member-
 ship making quick response to wartime vol-
 unteer service.
 With other past presidents Mrs. Caspar
 will be introduced during Saturday's cele-
 bration by another past president, Lila Mae
 (Mrs. Samuel L.) Durgan.
 Lila Mae rose to be president of the Flori-
 da Federation of BPW Clubs in 1958.  She
 was first State governor of Florida Opti-Mrs.
 Clubs; was chairman of the Poinciana Fest-
 ival in the city of Miami in 1961.  In 1962
 she served as president of the United Church
 Women of Greater Miami.
 It  was  during  her  administration  of
 Miami BPW that she inaugurated the Club
 Chatter, a bulletin.
 Traffic safety has long been a must in
 the lives of the Miami BPW Club members.
 Among past presidents who backed it with
 fervor  is  Irene  Redstone,  attorney,  who
 served as prexy in 1946-47.
 She inaugurated a traffic sticker program
 that employed the slogan "Safety Through
 Courtesy.",
 Miss Redstone is assistant staff counsel for
 the Florida Bar Association in charge of its
 grievance committee office.  She specializes
 in child custody matters.
 Her membership in Miami BPW was inter-
 rupted during World War II by 3 years
 in the Navy as Yeoman 1st Class.  It was
 after the war that she studied law at the
 University of Miami and earned her degree.
 She serves the American Bar Association's
 Council on the section of family law.
 When Miamian Valley K. Bennett's hus-
 band Robert, died in Tifton, Ga., in 1917, she
 became president of Bennett's Hardware, Inc.,
 dealers in hardware, paints, varnishes, and
 farm implements.
 Mrs. Bennett learned "Ignorance is bliss.
 It stood me in good hand during many an
 incidental need for knowledge."
 She started learning the business includ-
 ing how to assemble plows, mowing machines,
 milk separators, cultivators, much to the
 amazement of my customers.
 In Tifton in 1918 she helped organize and
 became  president  of the  Tifton  Business
 and     Professional   Women's   Club. Then
 came an exodus of many Georgians to Flor-
 ida, among them Mrs. Bennett.
 Through the first vice president of the
 First   National Bank  of  Miami,   Mildred
 Romfh, Mrs. Bennett became manager of the
 savings  department  of  the  bank.    Miss
 Romfh was a past president of the Miami
 BPW Club, which Mrs. Bennett had joined.
 Valley herself became president in 1933.
 Before her retirement in 1953 Mrs. Bennett
 had been an accountant for a factory rep-
 resentative of food products and allied lines.
 During World War II she was chairman of
 the business and professional women's divi-
 sion of the Dade County War Finance Com-
 mittee for the U.S. Treasury.
 She also is an active member of the Miami
 Soroptimist Club and the Miami Bookfellows.
 While Judge Mattie Belle Davis was presi-
 dent of the Miami BPW Club (1952-54) Dade
 County women became incensed by the lack
 of enforcement of the 1961 meat inspection
 law in Florida.
 Her Miami club joined other clubs in show-
 ing their disapproval.  The result was favor-
 able action by the State Livestock Board.
 Judge Davis is the first Floridian to serve
 as president of the National Association of
 Women Lawyers and the only woman to sit
 on the bench of the Dade County Metropoli-
 tan Court.
 She began her legal career as a secretary
 in the office of the late Troy Davis, whom
 she later married.  With him she practiced
 law after passing her bar examinations in
 1936.
 Georgia-born Judge Davis was appointed
 as judge of the Metropolitan Court of Dade

 NBC Honors Chicago's Len O'Connor on
 His 25th Year of Reporting
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS

 HON. ROMAN C. PUCINSKI
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, January 12, 1966
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, last
 night the National Broadcasting Co.
 honored one of Chicago's most highly
 A701
 respected journalists, Len O'Connor, who
 is observing his 25th year of reporting,
 Len O'Connor is one of Chicago's most
 popular television journalists and com-
 mentators.  NBC is to be congratulated
 for honoring him on his 25th anniver-
 sary.
 He is frequently called the "Guardian'
 of Chicago's Conscience,"  Because of
 his thorough understanding of the prob-
 lems of a large city like Chicago; his
 deep insight into problems of America
 and his thorough knowledge of inter-
 national affairs,, he today has several
 million people in the Midwest following
 his daily commentary both on radio and
 television.
 Len O'Connor - is a newspaperman's
 journalist.  He is penetrating, percep-
 tive, understanding and often pungent,
 but never unfair.  He has earned the
 respect not only of those he reports
 about, but also those he reports for.
 Mr. Speaker it was a privilege to be
 invited yesterday to see the top manage-
 ment people from the National Broad-
 casting Co.'s Midwest facilities present
 Len O'Connor with a wrist watch in
 grateful recognition of his 25 years of
 outstanding journalism.
 May time be kind to him so he can
 observe his golden jubilee of enterprising
 and dedicated contributions to the high-
 est standards of American journalism.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROY H. McVICKER
 OF COLORADO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, January 17, 1966
 Mr. McVICKER.  Mr. Speaker, Amer-
 ica is at its greatest when it accents the
 positive, and this we. are able to do when
 we fight "wars" on poverty and disease
 and thus lift tip the spirits of mankind.
 This is the step we are taking now in
 Vietnam-a positive step, reflected by
 the fact that the President. took the Sec-
 retaries of Welfare and Agriculture to
 the Honolulu meeting.
 The New-York Herald-Tribune said:
 It is in their fields that the United States
 can well take the offensive, against disease
 and poverty, and thus strengthen the de-
 fense of South Vietnam at vital points.  For
 this is the positive side of the ugly war, the
 hope and the promise.
 And it is this that gives a particular moral
 content to the whole united effort to bring
 peace to a free South Vietnam.
 I found the editorial to be most en-
 lightening, and I therefore recommend
 that it be printed in the RECORD, where
 others also may read it.
 COUNCIL IN THE PACIFIC
 It is reasonable to suppose that the pri-
 mary intent of President Johnson's journey
 to Hawaii to meet with the Americans and
 South Vietnamese concerned with the strug-
 gle in Vietnam is to discuss the prosecution
 of the war.  Meanwhile, in the wake of the
 Security Council's decisiop to take up the
 Vietnam question, U.N. members have been
 stepping up activities intended to end the

 war.   Yet the two efforts are not  contra-
 ,t i:- Ivory.
 tmerican alms fn Vietnam are essentially
 defensive.  They are to prevent the forcible
 .absorption of South Vietnam by the north.
 Diplomatic efforts to end the war must take
 into account the stark fact that the goal of
 r,ito  North Vietnam  Government  and  the
 Vietcong is to swallow up the south; neither
 has; ever deviated in public statements from
 that goal.. Naturally, the Communists would
 prefer to accomplish this without further
 ite;tcti.ng; naturally, they would accept sur-
 raider by the south.  But since this is com-
 plctely at odds with the American commit-
 ment, the diplomatic purpose must be to
 clrinotlstrate  th:it conquest  is impossible.
 A'i.l unless this is credible, from events in
 IJii  field, diplom.i, a will fail-again.
 Whether Mr. Johnson's Pacific conference

 Mr's. BOLTON.  Mr. Speaker, several
 days ago I commented on the failure
 of the District of Columbia to deal effcc-
 tively with the snow situation which
 paralyzed the city.  Since then I have
 had many reports and examples of dan-
 :;erous situations which were permitted
 i.,o exist.  For instance, I am told that
 >, week after the snow fell, along the
 :a.chool  'rounds at 13th Street NW., at
 Nfilitary Road, little tots still had to
 +:hoose whether to defy the dandy rut;h-
 ilour traffic on 13th Street or brave the
 chin-deep snow, still untramplcd on the
 :.chool walk.
 Tn. front of Wilson High School on
 rcel>raska Avenue, the snow, higher than
 a. tall man stands:, remained untouched
 1;r days after the children returned to
 heal.  The rcnort which came to me
 indicated that similar conditions were
 l:mind at most other District of Columbia
 .:schools. It seems that the only thing
 ii ought to bear on the snow surrounding
 our public schools here were the cold,
 d,,lnn feet of courageous children beating
 :a  ath to classes that were declared re-
 1' ned, with a dare to get there if you
 Unit'.
 tl times of such emergency, why can-
 t 'i we recruit from among the ranks
 of (;hose men who are drawing upon the
 various federal sustaining programs, at
 1. a.st to perform the public service of
 c licatring a path so our school buildings-
 before we order the children to ret urn?
 Perhaps the Job Corps could help in such
 instances-or those who, under better
 weather circumstances, would be working
 on the beautification program.

 Eery now and again I hear from a reader
 w .,-,o, as I, must rely on a wheelchaii,  and

 it, is possible at. all.  The last time I heard
 from her, her interest was to Public Hall
 where she h.,.-.d hoped to see the trailer ; how.
 This she was unable to do, persevere though
 did.
 the auditorium, as so many o  our
 public buildings, is the  product of   nept
 architecture.   Even  getting into the new
 muitimillion-dollar wing is an impossi ility
 fir the chairborne.
 The hall does have ramps but how tr find
 them is a Chinese puzzle and no one Is very
 cooperative.
 In fact, after several futile attempts  and
 it was a snowy, blustery, hitter night, my
 friend was asked by a guard why she had
 even bothered to make the eIIbrt.  In   ther
 words, if you are handicapped and pr. sent
 a problem, then stay home.  Anyway, that
 did it.  The disappointed lady and her  mite
 rightly outraged husband drove away-

 plated such an adventure that, she can Paul
 Hurd, wise manages the building, and :cave
 it up to him.  He must at lent know i here
 the ramps are.

 It would be easier to climb the pyra nids
 than make it into the Fede_r,ti Buildi, = on
 Public Square.
 in fact, anyone in a chair mu't are Inge
 Lu  have  the freight  elevator  brougha  up
 through   the  sidewalk, which   is  pre. isely
 what I did when I had to get a new pas-port
 not too long it-o-  Actually, I rather eniyed
 it, but it was summer and the weather was
 fine.
 The public library?    I gave that up long
 ago.  I went to the practically brand new
 art institute last week,  however,  eag r to
 see the faculty show.
 Well, it is a splendid exhibition, smal and
 beautifully hung but the effort spent getting
 inside the building was exhausting and T will
 think twice before attempting it again
 It seems simply incredible that our  ,reat

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 Or NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 10, 1966
 Mr. RYAN.  "Mr. Speaker, I have b! on
 bringing to the attention of my col-
 leagues a series of articles written from
 Vietnam for the New York Post by Cor-
 respondent Pete Hamill. I include at this
 point the third article in the series:
 VITNAM:  Tim  ENDLESS  WAR-ARTICLE  1.11:
 Ouus ALLIES
 (By Pete Hamill)
 SAIGON.--The  one  thing  everyone  was
 agreed upon when Nguyen Cao Ky took over
 as Premier of South Vietnam last year was
 that he had color.  There was no question
 about it: At 34, he was young, handsome :i rd
 dashing, with all the swaggering style of the
 Japanese movie star'I'oshiro Mifune.
 As head of the country's air force, he led
 his squadron into battle in a tailormade
 black silk flying suit and lavender scarf, "mills
 a   chronic- plated,   pearl-handled  revolver
 slung low en his hip.  To celebrate his c i c r.r"e
 from his wife-a Frenchwoman who bore him
 live children-and his remarriage to a pretty
 Air Vietnam stewardess, he led his squadron
 of 20 Skyraiders on a low sweep over Saigon
 to a bombing run on an empty clump of
 jungle not far from the capital.    Ernbar-
 rassed Vietnamese military spokesmen later
 said the area was a Vietcong stronghold, and
 the air strike had been a success.  Ky  II inn-
 buddies  toasted  him  that   night                                                                                                                                      with
 champagne, then moved to the backyn.'-d to
 empty their revolvers at tin cans.    There
 were no casualties.
 Away from the hazards of war, Ky acquired
 a garish reputation as a Tu Do Street hipster.
 Ile and his flyboy buddies would spend the
 evenings in restaurants like Brodard's, nur-
 sing  brandy  and. coffee,  listening  to                                                                                                                              the
 melancholy songs of Edith Piaf on the juke-
 box, discussing endlessly the merits of their
 women. At parties, he would compose love
 poems on the spot, and recite them to the
 loveliest  woman  in  the room,  his  voice
 choked, his eyes brimming with tears.  When
 such pursuits wearied him, he turned for
 s:olace to his gamecocks, which he raised on
 the side.
 Today, his intimates say, Ky is it changed
 man.  The burdens of office lie heavily upon
 him.  The  girls  don't  see  him  around
 Brodard's any more, his literary talent is a':-
 ercised on official documents and speeches,
 and even when he visits a battlegroun l he
 brings his wife along.  He hasn't done a thing  swa;thbuckling in months. Except,
 perhaps. to survive.
 In the can of worms which is Saigon Iol-
 itics, to survive as long as Ky has is a very real
 accomplishment.  When he took the lob lest
 June, as the, front man for a 10-man military
 junta, he became the head of the ninth gov-
 ernment in South. Vietnam since the murder
 of Ngo Dinh Diem in November 1963.
 One of the major reasons for Ky's survival
 is his realistic attitude toward the job.  "Thc
 generals have picked me more to risk my life
 than as an honor," he said when he took i;he
 post last June.  "I have told my wife to buy
 me it coffin."
 One cannot blame him, Saigon today is a
 sinkhole  of  corruption,  indifference,  and
 greed.  As the American millions are poured
 in, the number of hands reaching eagerly into
 the till are. proliferating.   On the  Saigon
 waterfront, it shipping owner can get his ship
 unloaded out of turn by paying 5500.       At
 police checkpoints, Communist agents carry-

 ing contraband medical equipment into the
 countryside get by with a small bribe.  The
 stalls in the black market are choked with
 American  soaps,  hair  sprays, cigarettes,
 candy, shoe polish and even C-rations, most
 of it booty from pilfered PX deliveries.
 The wives of prominent Chinese merchants
 smuggle diamonds out of the country every
 week, because gold is too bulky, and the
 paper currency is about as stable as the gov-
 ernment which prints it.  In the Indian book-
 shops on Tu Do Street, where you can still
 pick up dusty copies of such classics as "Dave
 Dawson in Libya," the rate is now up to 170
 plasters to the dollar; the official rate is 73
 to the dollar.
 The rice merchants plead that the Vietcong
 have cut off their deliveries, and then, when
 the price has been sufficiently jacked up, they
 produce large quantities of it.  The wife of
 at least one Vietnamese general, according to
 reliable sources, takes a monthly cut from a
 string of brothels.  And the liveliest argu-
 ments among the members of the junta are
 not over methods of beating the Vietcong,
 but over who will control the customs, the
 port of Saigon and the communications sys-
 tems.
 When Ky first took office, he announced
 with loud fanfare that his major task would
 be the elimination of graft and black mar-
 keteering.  (Has any military junta in history
 promised anything  different?)    He  sum-
 moned the top 28 rice merchants in Saigon
 and told them that if prices were not low-
 ered, one of them would be selected by lot
 and shot. The prices went down, at least for
 a while.
 Ky also promised to reform the draft sys-
 tem.  And it is true that in Saigon you can
 watch the police round up young men coming
 out of movie theaters every afternoon.  But
 it is still possible to pick up a forged draft
 card for about $10, and for $250 a young man
 can obtain an exit visa and study medieval
 scholasticism at the Sorbonne in Paris for the
 duration.   Meanwhile,  in  rural  areas, the
 army-like the Vietcong-employs a system
 which differs from kidnaping only to the ex-
 tent that no ransom is asked.
 Aside from the usual tributes to freedom
 and a kind of glib anticommunism, no one
 really knows where Ky and the junta stand
 politically.   Last month, in a  Vietnamese
 equivalent of a state of the union message,
 Ky promised a new constitution for the coun-
 try by October, and free elections to be held
 next year.     Most old Saigon hands doubted
 that he would be around to vote in them.
 Many officials  in  the  American  mission
 here-civilian and military-shudder at the
 prospect of Ky's having a free hand.  They
 realize that this war is as much a political
 problem as a military one, and that the poli-
 tical solutions will take years of hard, frus-
 trating, grueling work.
 The Vietnamese have also become quite
 touchy about what they feel is a growing
 American takeover of the war. Ky has made
 some statements asserting his independence,
 viewing that the war would never be solved
 without the consent of the Saigon govern-
 ment.   But the hard fact is that we have
 committed billions of dollars to the war, and
 more than 200,000 troops, and we should have
 a major say in the solution.
 "The Vietnamese want it both ways," one
 American political "officer in Saigon told me.
 "They want our money, our gun's and our
 men to die for them.  But they don't want
 us to negotiate a settlement.  Goddammit,
 the hard truth is that this has become our
 war and we should settle it our way without
 worrying about wounded feelings."
 The man with the responsibility of main-
 taining some equilibrium between the Amer-
 ican leaders and the Vietnamese is Ambassa-
 dor Henry Cabot Lodge.  Somewhere there
 must be a man with the adrenalin, ideas
 and style to handle this delicate, taxing job.
 Many here feel that Henry Cabot Lodge is
 not that man.
 For  practical  political  purposes  Lodge
 could just as well be serving as the Ambassa-
 dor to Patagonia.  He was here as Ambassa-
 dor once before, for seven months beginning
 in June of 1963, and performed creditably at
 that time. Arriving during the Buddhist
 crisis which eventually toppled the Diem re-
 gime, he had nowhere to move but up-
 everything having gone wrong under the
 tenure of the previous Ambassador, Frederick
 Nolting.  Lodge worked relatively hard, and
 used his past experience as a professional
 politician to some advantage in defusing the
 anti-American  sentiment  caused  by  the
 Buddhist-Catholic argument.
 Since replacing the icy Maxwell Taylor,
 however, it has become more and more evi-
 dent that Lodge's prime qualification is that
 he is a Republican, and that he photographs
 well.   The men who work under him say
 that he just does not seem interested in t4e
 job any more.  They say he prefers swimming
 at the Cercle Sportif to the back-breaking
 homework that such a job requires.
 "Cabot Lodge always had a lazy mind,"
 one member of the American civilian estab-
 lishment told me.   "But there were times
 when he could rise to an occasion, as he did
 against the Russians in the U.N., as he did
 during his first tour here.  But he doesn't
 care any more and I think I know why.  He
 has stopped running for office."
 Some observers say that the main problem
 with Lodge is his image; in a revolutionary
 situation the most important American in
 the country should not look like a repre-
 sentative of the landed gentry.  "Hell, we'd
 be better off with some tough old roll-up-
 the-sleeve  radical like  Saul  Alinsky,"  an
 officer in the AID program said. "That kind
 of guy would go out and pull rice with the
 peasants, drive bulldozers in the country,
 look like he understood what the roots of
 the war are all about."
 Such criticism is harsh and, in some ways,
 unfair.  Lodge gets along well with Ky, and
 is an improvement over Taylor in matters
 of tact. Many of the Vietnamese generals
 could  not  forgive  Taylor  for  what  they
 thought was his haughty, disdainful manner.
 The story is told that after one of the coups
 that plagued his year as Ambassador, Taylor
 summoned the generals to dinner at a res-
 taurant,  asked  them  if                                                                                     they  understood
 English, dressed them down for pulling the
 coup, then told them he had wasted his
 money  even buying  them  dinner. Lodge
 would never consider doing such a thing.
 Meanwhile, Ky  continues  to    walk . the
 tightrope.  His meeting in Honolulu should
 shore up his prestige and perhaps he can
 continue as Premier for a few more years.
 He has already lasted longer than anyone
 expected.
 But if he survives, Ky will have to do more
 for his country than ask for more bombing,
 more American troops and more money.  He
 has to become a leader, of his people. And
 he will never do that sitting in an office in
 Saigon.
 The Elkhart, Ind., Truth Endorses -
 4-Year Term for Congress
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN BRADEMAS
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 2, 1966
 Mr. BRADEMAS.  Mr. Speaker, under
 unanimous consent I insert in the RECORD
 the text of an editorial published on Jan-
 uary 27,- 1966, by the Elkhart, Ind.,
 Truth endorsing a constitutional amend-
 ment providing 4-year terms for Mem-
 bers of Congress and expressing support
 as well for staggering the terms.
 The.editorial follows:
 FOUR-YEAR TERMS, BUT WITH PROVISO
 While we favor extending the terms of U.S.
 Representatives from 2 to 4 years, as proposed
 by President Johnson, we don't believe they
 should all be elected in the presidential elec-
 tion years.
 To do that would greatly increase the
 power of the presidency, and thereby upset
 checks and balances as between the branches
 of the Government.
 This would encourage the candidacy of
 "coattail riders," seeking to reach legislative
 office through the casting of straight tickets
 for a personally popular President or other
 presidential candidate.
 Besides, it is important that people have
 recourse during an, "off-year" election to the
 choice of some new Representatives in case
 they don't like what has happened in the 2
 years past.
 This could be taken care of easily'by "stag-
 gering" the terms, for example by electing
 half of the House of Representatives in the
 presidential year and half in the off-year.
 Yes, the 4-year term for House Members
 would be good. It would allow new Members
 more time to learn the ropes; it would re-
 quire current Members to spend less timeon
 campaigning for reelection, thus they could
 devote more time to the people's business.
 But in drawing up the proposed constitu-
 tional amendment to accomplish this, let's
 apply the modification as to method of elec-
 tion we have indicated.

 O7'? CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday/. February 2, 1966
 Mr. TUNNEY.  Mr. Speaker, today, I
 would like to join the Postmaster Gen-
 eral, Lawrence O'Brien, in expressing my
 deep regret over the resignation of his
 Executive Assistant, Mr. Michael Mon-
 roney.
 I am sure that I speak for my col-
 leagues in saying that Mike Monroney's
 vast experience in Government affairs
 will be missed.  He has made great con-
 1xi.butions to the Post Office Department
 which will long be remembered by the
 citizens of the Nation.
 Mike has served his country well under
 President Kennedy and President John-
 son.  Mike Monroney began his present
 :atssig'nment in early 1961 under former
 Postmaster General J. Edward Day, as-
 sisting him during the transition of the
 l'ost Office Department to the Kennedy
 administration.
 Monroney brought to his postal Sob
 ecnsiderable and varied experience  in
 journalism and in local and Federal
 Government affairs.
 Moving into nearby Silver Spring, Md.,
 following  his  graduation  from Dart-
 mouth College in 1951, he covered subur-
 ban affairs as a staff reporter for the
 Washington, D.C., Post and Times-Her-
 ald during most of his 5 years with the
 newspaper.
 In 1957 and 1958, he served as a top
 aide to the county manager of Mont-
 gomery County, Md., adjacent to the
 District of Columbia.  In 1956 he se"ved
 on the presidential campaign stall' of
 Gcv. Adlai E. Stevenson.
 The 38--year-old Monroney served, for
 2 years as administrative assistant to
 Congressman JOHN BRADEMAS, of Ieldi-
 ana, during which he worked on a variety
 of legislative problems, including aid to
 di tressed areas, Federal aid to educa-
 tion, the Federal airport construction
 program and labor-management reform
 legislation.
 He left Congressman BRPtDEMAS' :staff
 in January of 1961 to assume his present
 position.  As executive assistant to the
 Postmaster  General,  Monroney  iv  in
 charge of congressional liaison for the
 Post Office Deparment in additiol: to
 other assignments at the direction of the
 Postmaster General.
 Named Maryland Young Democrat of
 the Year in 1961, Monroney was also
 nominated that same year for one of the
 10 outstanding young men of the year
 awards sponsored annually by the Na-
 tional Junior Chamber of Commerce.
 A Navy veteran, he is the son of U.S.
 Senator A. S. MIKE MONRONEY, of Okla-
 homa.
 I would like to wish him the best of
 success in. whatever field of endeavor he
 chooses to enter.  Past experience slows
 that Mike is a man who has a deep un-
 derstanding and sympathy for his fel-
 lowman and is dedicated to servinpl his
 cOUntry.

 Mr. Karl Abraham in his article in the

 points out that the Saturn V launch ve-

 mendous  payload capability and dis-
 cusses manned as well as unmanned use
 of this large vehicle.  He also clearly
 points out the need to reach an early
 decision so that our current space pro-

 for gradual changeover of the current
 work underway to the newer objectives
 that will follow our initial lunar land-

 The article follows:

 SPACE EXPERTS MUST SOON DECIDE QUESTION:
 WHERE AFTER THE MOON?
 (By Karl Abraham)
 The men who run the Nation's space pro-
 gram,                                                                                                                                                           although they are not yet sure  of
 successfully landing men on the moon, :i..:1st
 decide soon what to do after the first lunar
 landings are made.
 The alternatives are extensive exploratous
 of the moon for a decade or a shift of em-
 phasis toward planetary missions.  Both are
 to be reckoned in the tens of billion;; of
 dollars.
 For President Johnson, who omitted men-
 tion of the space program's future from his
 state of the Union message last week, it is
 largely a financial question to be weighed
 against his hopes for the Great Society and
 conclusion of the Vietnam war.
 CRITICAL DECISION
 But the National Aeronautics arid Space
 Administration, its space centers, the indus-
 tries, universities, and the Nation's scientific
 and engineering communities face a related
 critical decision within the space program
 itself.
 The decision confronts them now---po;-
 sibly somewhat earlier In the drive toward
 the  moon  than  many  had  anticipated--
 largely because of a single technological de-
 velopment:                                                                                                                                      the impending arrival, finally,
 of big, powerful rockets.
 The moon rocket, the advanced Saturn,
 sometimes called the Saturn 5, with its 7.5-
 million-pound thrust booster and two upper
 stages, giving it a total power of 8.7 million
 pounds thrust, will be a mighty workhorse.
 NEW POSSIBILITIES OPEN
 With other upper stages, such as the new
 hydrogen-fueled Centaur, all kinds of new
 possibilities open up in space exploration.
 The Saturn 5's primary mission is to send
 a 95,000-pound Apollo three-man moonship
 to the moon, including the lunar landing
 craft and enough rocket power for the trip
 back from the moon.
 But It is capable of other missions also.
 It can lift 250,000 pounds-125 tons--into
 a 500-mile-high earth orbit; carry 50 'tons
 away from earth;  45 tons toward Mars or
 Venus; 20 tons to the giant planet Jupiter;
 and with a Centaur upper stage, it could
 even carry a probe weighing 7.5 tons clear
 out of the solar system.
 WHERE NEXT
 Saturn 5 will make possible the assembly,
 in Earth orbit, or other larger rockets--sent
 up a stage at a time, the fuel separately.  A
 complete Saturn 5 could be assembled       in
 space for all kinds of missions.
 It  is  this  impending  prospect  and    the
 knowledge that many years of engineering
 and design of payloads will be needed to Lake
 advantage of Saturn 5 for these advanced
 missions that makes a decision on "where
 after the Moon?" such an urgent one.
 The decision is by no means only a scien-
 tific or technical one.
 The attitude of James E. Webb, NASA's
 Administrator-very much reflecting Presi-
 dent Johnson's also-is tied up in a ques-
 tion he has posed to many of his workers
 and consultants.
 DENEFITS QUESTIONED
 "How can the space program most sub-
 stantially                                                                                                                                                                   benefit  the  American  people?
 How  can  space exploration and  what                                we
 learn from it help us on Earth," he asks river
 and over.
 One     segment  of                              the  Nation's scientific
 community, while mindful of these consid-
 erations, poses the question of the future in
 different terms.

 panel, which urged higher priorities for ex-
 ploring the planets, put it this way:

 City's War on Poverty Runs Well but Has
 Its Troubles in Job Field
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 NON. JOHN J. GILLIGAN
 OF OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 10, 1966
 Mr. GILLIGAN.  Mr. Speaker, a re-
 porter, Margaret Josten, of the Cincin-
 nati Enquirer, has written a seven-part
 series on the antipoverty program in
 Cincinnati.  Today, I include the last
 part of her series to illustrate the kind
 of reporting that helps inform the public
 about, the. various antipoverty programs
 at work in our communities under the
 U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity.
 CITY'S  WAR  ON  POVERTY  RUNS  WELL,  BUT
 HAS ITS TROUBLES IN JOB FIELD
 (By Margaret Josten)
 While the antipoverty war at the Federal
 level is beset by a never-ending stream of
 financial and political troubles, Cincinnati's
 effort seems to be running on fairly well-
 oiled wheels.
 Theodore M. Berry, former Cincinnati vice
 mayor, now a top official in the U.S. Office of
 Economic Opportunity, is gratified, in fact,
 to see his home city doing its job with what
 he Calls "a minimum of the kind of tension
 and conflict general in other communities."
 He rates Cincinnati's effort as better than
 average, adding, "I think it ranks very well
 in the upper 10th of the class."
 Cincinnati does have some problems, how-
 ever.                   And while they may not be of im-
 portance In the big picture, some do get to
 the very key to the success of the anti-
 poverty war.  They have to do with jobs and
 job training.
 A dispute has developed here in recent
 weeks between the Community Action Com-
 mission, local arm of the war, and the Ohio
 Bureau, of Unemployment  Compensation,
 charged by law with setting up job-training
 programs under the Manpower Development
 Training Act.
 John E. Hansan, CAC executive director,
 charges that the BUC has failed to show
 aggressive action in getting such programs
 into operation.
 Lewis H. Evans, BUC area manager, an-
 swers that he cannot set up job-training
 classes until he determines whether jobs will
 be available for the graduates.
 "We fan do not greater injustice to an
 individual than to put him into training and
 then have no job for him," adds Mr. Evans.
 Mr. Hansan's argument is that MDTA re-
 quirements in connection with occupational
 demand  can be  adhered  to  "liberally  or'
 rigidly" He thinks Mr. Evans is -being too
 rigid.
 Another argument which goes 'round and
 'round in Cincinnati has to do with union
 membership for Negroes, who, by their very
 position on the economic ladder, are most
 involved in the war against poverty.
 Civil rights groups charge that the build-
 ing trades unions give only token member-
 ship to Negroes.  The unions say otherwise.
 Efforts to straighten out the matter locally
 have had little effect.
 This argument goes on nationally, too.
 Top OEO. officials avoid taking one side or
 another.  One does say, however, that a large
 union (presumably in the building trades) is
 getting ready to set up an apprenticeship
 program which would alleviate much of the
 trouble.
 A number of job-training programs are
 underway in Cincinnati.  The board of edu-
 cation, the Citizens Committee on Youth,
 .and the BUC are prominent among the
 sponsors.
 Mr. Evans reports that an average of 400
 persons a month have been in training under
 the  Manpower Development Training  Act
 during 1965.  This does not include on-the-
 job programs in which 113 person's are train-
 ing in 17 categories at private local firms.
 Occupations for which people train under
 MDTA range from automobile repairing to
 welding,  from  tool  and  die  making  to
 cooking.
 A major problem in the local antipoverty
 effort lies in that area known as Over the
 Rhine, where, although help is sorely needed,
 there is as yet no program funded by OEO.
 Over the Rhine, which Mr. Hansan calls
 one of the most difficult neighborhoods in
 Cincinnati, is a heterogeneous mixture of
 young and old, white and Negro, old estab-
 lished families and migrants.  The topogra-
 phy is so fragmented it really is not a single
 neighborhood.
 Mr. Hansan explains that the area has a
 proliferation  of  social  agencies  and  reli-
 gious institutions, each with its own way of
 doing things, but none with the staff or
 budget to do the big job.
 In addition, he says, southern Appalach-
 ian migrants, of whom there are many in
 Over the Rhine, are neither joiners nor be-
 longers.  This makes any kind of neighbor-
 hood attack on poverty difficult, he adds.
 But Mr. Hansan is optimistic.  He hopes
 that "sometime before spring" enough lead-
 ership will have been pulled together from
 among the residents and the institutions to
 make some definite antipoverty plans.
 The word from Washington is such, how-
 ever,  that  the  financial outlook for  new
 programs is bad.
 Several national programs will need to be
 cut back. And the community action divi-
 sion of the OEO, now headed by Mr. Berry,
 is not going to be free with its money in the
 future.
 The war in Vietnam has top priority.
 Youngsters 'Favoring U.S. Vietnam Policy
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. OMAR BURLESON
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 10, 1966 -
 Mr. BURLESON.  Mr. Speaker, it is
 with a great deal of pride I learned of
 the action of students of the Big Spring
 High School, Big Spring, Tex., who have
 formed the Big Spring Youth for Free-
 dom in Vietnam and who have obtained
 533 signatures on a petition supporting
 U.S. policy in Vietnam.  The petition
 reads:
 We, the undersigned, as patriotic students
 of Big Spring Senior High School, in the in-
 terest of promoting a better understanding
 of the prevailing opinion of American youth,
 and recognizing the right to dissent, never-
 theless realizing that any aggression, whether
 it be fascist, Nazi, or Communist, must be
 arrested, do hereby proclaim that we support
 the present U.S. policy in Vietnam.
 I compliment these young people on
 this most impressive statement, and join
 them in the sentiments they express. It
 causes a welling pride that students in
 my area have taken an,initiative in this
 matter, at a time when we hear of the
 protesters and draft card burners in
 other parts of the Nation.
 The following is an article from the
 Big Spring, Tex., Herald, which describes
 this effort- on the part of these students.
 YOUNGSTERS FAVORING U.S. VIETNAM POLICY
 (By Tom Barry)
 The effects of the -war in Vietnam can be
 felt thousands of miles away-by politicians,
 the electorate, demonstrators pro and con-
 arid                                                                                                                                      in Big Spring, where vibrations have
 reached into Big Spring High School.
 Reaction to the war and its implications
 recently came from three Big Spring High
 /junior classmen, David Thomas, Larry Arn-
 hart, and Dale Pless.  They were discussing,
 these 16-year-olds, Vietnam over the noon
 meal  at the  school cafeteria.   More  par-
 ticularly, they were        discussing                                                                                                                                          draft card
 burners, beatniks, and the image given by a
 loudmouthed minority to the majority of
 teenagers.  These boys felt something should
 be done.
 PETITION PLAN
 Others were listening to the discussion.
 Ten in all decided that the thing to do was
 to get 500 students to sign petitions saying
 they,  even  though  nonvoting  teenagers,
 support the present policy of the U.S. in
 Vietnam.  When signed,- the petitions will
 be sent to Members of Congress.
 Forms were printed, permission of school
 authorities was granted to pass them out and
 post them on the bulletin board, and by
 Friday more ' than the original goal of 500
 signatures of students had been obtained.
 Also, the group gave itself a name-Big
 Spring Youth for Freedom in Vietnam.
 Five hundred students represent more than
 one-third of the entire student body of the
 high school, according to the youthful chair-
 man of the organization, David Thomas.
 "We expect more, and will not close our
 signature drive until TueCday," he said.  "We
 have had surprisingly little opposition. to the
 drive,"  he  continued.   "We've  had     more
 trouble with students signing two or more
 petitions each than with those who refuse
 to sign."
 David said only three students have re-
 fused  to  sign  the  petition                                                                                                                                       because they
 favor getting the U.S. out of ' Vietnam; and
 a few more refused to sign because they think
 the war ought to be accelerated.
 . Four purposes unite the 10 members of
 the organization to disavow the draft card
 burners; to show the adult world how they
 feel;  to encourage representatives in Gov-
 ernment; and to support the present policy
 in Vietnam.  Some of the members of the
 group, like young Thomas, are strongly con-
 servative in their political views; others are
 on the left side of the fence; and there are
 some who are middle-of-the-roaders.
 After the petitions are signed, they will be
 divided into three groups of  about  equal
 numbers  and  mailed  to    Senator   JOHN
 Towns,  OMAR  BURLESON,  representing  the
 17th district, and GEORGE MAHON, represent-
 ing the 19th district.
 "We hope we have a better chance of the
 petitions having more weight by sending
 them to the three individuals rather than
 to President Johnson," Thomas said, "after
 all, in a few years we'll be the ones fighting
 in Vietnam if the war goes on, and it is an
 election year, even though we can't vote
 yet."
 About 12 teachers are helping the group
 In one way or another, Thomas said, putting
 petitions up in classrooms and passing them
 around in government classes.
 Will the petitions do any good?
 "Well," Thomas said, "let's say our hopes
 are moderate."
 "We thought we should do something,"
 Thomas said.  "We are hardly the type to
 demonstrate in the streets, and we know
 that petitions don't normally get a lot of
 results, but we wanted to speak our piece."
 The vigor with which the  10 members
 of the organization are presenting their case

 for the majority of teenagers (already several
 teachers have announced open support of
 the campaign, according to Thomas)  indi-
 rates that something beyond ignoring the
 normally quiet, "average" teenager should
 result.
 HON. JOHN P. SAYLOR
 OF :PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 10, 1966
 Mr. SAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, in testify-
 ing before the Senate Committee on In-
 terior and Insular Affairs, prior to his
 eonlirmation as Director of the Bureau of
 Mines last week, Dr. Walter R. Hibbard,
 Jr., noted that very promising progress
 iii being made on the Bureau's research
 project for the use of automobile scrap
 in modern steelmaking.  In view of the
 numerous steps that are in the making
 to contend with the auto junkyard prob-
 lem, I feel that every Member of Con-
 i;ress should familiarize himself with all
 i"acets of the subject.
 The Highway Beautification  Act of
 1965 provides that the establishment and
 use and maintenance of junkyards in
 areas adjacent to the Interstate System
 and the primary system should be con-
 trolled in order to protect the public in-
 vestment in such highways, to promote
 the safety and recreational value of pub-
 lic travel, and to preserve natural beauty.
 Among the provisions are Federal par-
 ticipation in junkyard removal, land-
 scaping and screening, as well as a re-
 duction in  federal  highway  funds to
 r;tates which fail to provide effective con-
 trols.
 Also during the last session of Con-
 gzress, I proposed that 1 percent of the
 auto excise tax be used by the Federal
 Government to dispose of auto junk-
 yards, with as much as half of the in-
 c:ome to be put into research to deter-
 mine whether the junked cars have fur-
 ther economic use.  Numerous recom-
 mendations have come from the general
 public as well as from interested busi-
 nesses in response to this suggestion, and
 meanwhile   considerable   development
 toward economic disposal of scrapped
 ears has taken place.  I have received
 correspondence from representatives of
 the scrap industry who are convinced
 that research thus fa; clearly indicates
 that the time is near when through
 proper crushing and incineration old
 cars can be dismantled and the steel
 :salvaged profit,,:ibly.  Meanwhile Secre-
 tary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall has
 invited universities, nonprofit organiza-
 tions, business firms, and individual citi-
 zens to submit constructive recommen-
 dations and proposals to the Bureau of
 Mines for expanded research on disposal
 of scrap autos and other solid mineral
 wastes.
 The Bureau's own scrap-auto research
 i; described as follows:
 Bureau research on the scrap-auto prob-
 1cm is directed toward overcoming presently
 known economic and technological barriers
 -such as changes in steel making and auto-
 mobile manufacturing practices-that have
 caused once-sizable markets for these dis-
 carded cars to shrink.  Out of the Bureau's
 research have come two promising metal-
 lurgical processes, both of which are sched-
 uled for early testing in large-scale demon-
 stration plants.
 One process involves the conversion  of
 all the iron and steel in auto body scrap to
 a, high-grade iron ore for which there is
 a ready market.  With this process the scrap
 can be used as a :reductant for low-grade,
 nonmagnetic taconite that is abundant in
 the United States.  This is done by care-
 fully controlled roasting of the scrap and
 the taconite in a rotating kiln, which ron-
 verbs both the iron in the taconite and the
 iron and steel in the scrap to magnetic iron
 oxide.  After roasting, any unconverted scrap
 is screened for recycling, and the iron oxides
 are  concentrated  by  magnetic  separation
 into a high-grade form of iron oxide.   All
 nenferrous materials in the scrap, as well as
 the gangue in the taconite, are rejected in
 the process.  By changing the roasting con-
 dit;.ons, the process can be made to opcrrate
 without taconite.  In this variation iron in
 the scrap is obtained as an oxide, which
 can be separated magnetically from aaon-
 ferrous contaminating elements in the scrap.
 In the other process being developed by
 the Bureau, cylindrical shaped bales made
 from cannibalized automobiles, less engines
 and transmissions, will be run throu?g;h a
 rotary kiln at a temperature high enough
 to burn the combustible materials and melt
 the nonferrous metal parts.  The kiln gases
 will be cleaned to prevent air pollution.  Re-
 sulting clean scrap,  upon discharge                                                                                from
 the kiln, will be compacted to any desired
 density for steelmaking charges.  After the
 technique for burning and separating non-
 ferrous metals from baled automobile hulls
 is developed in a pilot plant, a larger demon-
 stration plant including a modern electric
 steelmaking furnace with necessary acces-
 sories will be built for demonstrating the
 economic feasibility of the thermal treat-
 ment technique.  The objective is to :,how
 that many types of steel can be prod aced
 frcm  thermally  treated  automobile  e:erap
 on.y, and that almost any type of steel can
 be economically produced from thermally
 treated scrap and directly reduced iron ore.
 Mr. Speaker, as these efforts continue,
 the number of junked cars to bight
 suburbs and countryside rises annually.
 More than 5 million were dumped onto
 the heaps last year.  The president of
 General Motors predicted on January
 17 that the average annual demand for
 pars and trucks in the United States
 could exceed 11 million by 1970, thus
 blazing the way for bigger and bigger
 junkyards.
 While the unsightly cars are piled
 higher, adjacent land tracts-whether
 they are business, residential, or farm
 areas-suffer correspondingly.  Regard-
 less of how attractive your own plot of
 ground may be, its beauty is quickly
 marred if a neighbor is unconcerned
 about the trash in his yard.  In our par-
 ticular region of Pennsylvania, the Penn-
 sylvania Electric Co., has long practiced
 beautifying to the fullest possible extent
 the properties on. which its facilities, are
 located, including the rights-of-was, for
 power lines.  Trees are planted and care-
 fully nurtured, and the company takes
 pride in helping to keep our State teau-
 tiiul.
 Responsible mining companies needed
 no laws to insist upon reclamation of
 stripped properties.  For years they have
 been turning earth from which coal has
 been extracted through surface opera-
 tions into attractive forest, farm, and
 recreational areas.
 These operations by the utilities and
 coal companies have been carried out
 at their own expense, without cost to
 Federal or State government.  By the
 same token, it would seem reasonable
 for auto manufacturers and consumers
 to provide the means for proper disposal
 of cars that are no longer usable, and
 the use of a portion of the excise tax
 would appear to be the least injurious
 or objectionable means of absorbing the
 cost.
 The Bureau of Mines projects are com-
 mendable and should receive high priori-
 ty, but once a satisfactory method of
 economic disposal of auto bodies is de-
 veloped, the Federal Government Should
 retire from this activity and permit com-
 mercial growth of the industry.  I am
 hopeful that such plans will be achieved
 prior to July 1, 1970, in order that it will
 not be necessary for Federal and State
 governments to finance removal and
 screening of auto junkyards, as provided
 in the Highway Beautification Act of
 1965.
 Newspaper Columnist Joe Crump has
 observed:
 Making junked automobiles commercially
 profitable is a sure way to remove them from
 the scene.
 With a portion of the excise tax avail-
 able in support of the junked car dis-
 posal program, there is all the more rea-
 son to assume that research can and will
 make it a profitable undertaking.
 While some development engineers are
 confident that small disposal plants-
 even portable facilities-can dispose of
 junked cars economically, the concensus
 would appear to favor-at least in the
 early stages-large centers to which the
 steel shells would be hauled from points
 within a wide periphery.  In the latter
 event, I would hope that automobile
 transportation firms will be ready to as-
 sume a role in the operation without
 delay.  Stackback and piggyback rail-
 road cars as well as the two-deck auto-
 carrying trucks that move from assem-
 bly centers with new vehicles snuggled
 closely together should quickly be con-
 verted for hauling remnants from scat-
 tered junkyards to points where giant
 incinerators have been established.
 We are obviously making headway in
 our battle to eliminate the ghastly auto
 junkyard. Let us give it a boost by ap-
 criTde.

 A Citizen's Views on Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. MORRIS K. UDALL
 OF ARIZONA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 10, 1966
 Mr. UDALL.                                                           Mr. Speaker, I know
 that we all receive a great deal of mail
 these days on Vietnam.  This, to me,
 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400020004-2
 Februar10, ?`     ed For    ~9     9      RW~7~400020004-2         A691
 indicates a great concern and uneasiness
 throughout the land.  My own mail re-
 flects the obvious differences in opinion
 and comes from people in all walks of
 life. The expression and understanding
 of the writers varies greatly but recently
 I received a letter from a constituent
 which so cogently states some of the un-
 derlying questions in people's minds, that,
 with the permission of the House, I would
 insert it in the RECORD.  We have all
 heard from many sources the arguments
 for and against our policy in Vietnam;
 and while I do not agree with all the
 writer's views, his letter is, I believe, an
 eloquent effort by a citizen to reason
 things out for himself.
 SIERRA VISTA, ARIZ.,
 February 1, 1966.
 DEAR SIR: I, as an American citizen and
 veteran, deplore the ambiguous, indecisive,
 vicious policies of the administration in re-
 gard to Vietnam,
 If our objective is to merely stem Com-
 munist aggression, .why are we unable to en-
 list wider allied support?
 If we wish to be the power in Asia, won't
 it be necessary to "acquire territories and
 bases?"
 If we are striving for a military victory,
 why did we engage in a bombing pause or
 throw ourselves on the mercy of the United
 Nations?
 If we desire peace  through the United
 Nations, why are we bombing North Viet-
 nam?
 If the problem is so complex, why do the
 alternatives of policy, to bomb or not to
 bomb, sound so simple?
 We stand in violation of the Geneva ac-
 cords and the United Nations' Charter, yet
 we claim to be prepared to wage a 6-year war
 to  the  tune  of  half a  million  American
 men.
 Along  with  an  ineffective  buildup     of
 strength and a relatively ineffective bomb-
 ing of North Vietnam, we are to assume
 that Red China and the Soviet Union will
 stay out of the conflict in the field.
 To disagree with our current policy is not
 to endorse the righteousness of either the
 Vietcong or North Vietnam.  It is rather to
 realize that the time for sending living, pro-
 ductive citizens to die for an ambiguous and
 strange point of honor has passed us by.
 And this conflict does hinge on a strange
 point of honor.  Senator JOHN STENNIS has
 said it was a mistake to enter this conflict,
 but now that we are committed we cannot
 back down or withdraw.  The commit your
 policy and your sons to a stubborn position
 such as this is strange indeed.  History will
 label it not only strange but vicious.
 I suspect that since the war is a reality
 (undeclared and unconstitutionally execut-
 ed) your mail is divided 10 to 1 in favor of
 our policy.  However, sir, if on the eve of our
 now vast commitment it had been put to a
 vote, I wonder if our President would have
 enjoyed such odds.
 Finally, I resent this administration's muz-
 zling of debate.                          Let me remind you, sir, a
 conference with 21 congressional leaders is
 not debate, any more than a public state-
 ment announcing the resumption of bomb-
 ing is debate after this bombing has already
 occurred.
 When you read the opinions of your con-
 stituents into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, I
 would feel far less helpless if you could ex-
 press mine in the halls of what was once a
 vital forum for debating and forming pol-
 icy-the Congress of the United States of
 America.
 Sincerely yours,
 TIMOTHY W. GARGIULO.
 The New GI Bill of Rights
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. JOHN W. WYDLER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr.. WYDLER.                                      Mr. Speaker, I have
 repeatedly urged, supported and voted
 for the new GI bill of rights-H.R. 12410.
 This bill authorizes a program of edu-
 cation and training for veterans of mili-
 tary service discharged after January 31,
 1955.
 The serviceman has met his responsi-
 bilities to the Nation.  It is the Nation's
 responsibility to prepare the serviceman
 returning from service to take his place
 in civilian life.
 I only regret that the .benefits of this
 bill do not come up to those of the
 Korean war bill.  I supported such in-
 creased benefits.  The administration
 opposed them and made clear that any
 attempt to raise benefits would end
 chances for Presidential approval of the
 legislation.
 ANALYSIS
 Education: Provides a permanent program
 of educational assistance for individuals serv-
 ing in the Armed Forces, discharged after
 January 31, 1955.  College-level and below-
 college-level  training  in trade,                                                                  vocational,
 and technical schools is provided.  Part-time
 training is permitted.  Eligibility accrues at
 the rate of 1 month of training for 1 month
 of service, not to exceed 36 months.  Persons
 serving on active duty for training do not
 accrue eligibility.  The education and train-
 ing allowances provided are as follows:
 Institutional:
 Full tinic___________
 Three-quarter time_
 flail time-_________
 Cooperative____________
 No de-
 pendents
 $100

 2 or more
 depend-
 ents
 $150

 Fees and tuition are paid for less than half-
 time  training.  Education  must  be                                                                                           com-
 pleted within 8 years from the date of dis-
 charge or 8 years from the effective date
 of the act, whichever is later.  Training is
 provided  for active-duty members  of            the
 Armed Forces who have served at least 2
 years, a portion of which occurred after Jan-
 uary 31, 1955.  These active-duty members
 may receive payments for fees and tuition.
 Administrative provisions of the GI bill for
 veterans of the Korean conflict and the war
 orphans' training program are applicable to
 this proposed program.  Schools will be ap-
 proved by State approval  agencies of the
 various States, and these agencies will be re-
 sponsible for extending supervision to ap-
 proved schools.
 Guaranteed and direct home loans: Bene-
 fits of both the guaranteed and the direct
 home loan programs are extended to vet-
 erans discharged after January 31, 1955.  The
 guarantee of a loan by a private lender in
 the amount of $7,500 is extended to this
 group and, in areas established as direct loan
 areas where guaranteed financing has not
 generally been available, a maximum direct
 loan of $17,500 is authorized.  The Admin-
 istrator of Veterans' Affairs is authorized to
 regulate interest rates, consistent with the
 ceiling established for Department of Hous-
 ing and Urban Affairs.  A fund is established
 for the Administrator to offset losses under
 this program, by requiring the veteran to
 pay 0.05 percent of his loan at closing.
 Non-service-connected  medical  care:  At
 the present time, veterans serving after Jan-
 uary 31, 1955, are eligible for medical care
 in Veterans' Administration facilities only
 for    service-connected disabilities. This
 group is made eligible under the provisions
 of this bill for treatment of non-service-
 connected disabilities on the same basis as
 war veterans.  Eligibility for treatment of
 non-service-connected disabilities is based on
 availability of a bed and the signing of a
 statement of inability to pay for treatment
 elsewhere, as is required of veterans of earlier
 conflicts.
 Preference in Federal employment: Pref-
 erence in employment in Federal service is
 extended to the group of veterans discharged
 after January 31, 1955, on the same basis as
 is currently applicable to war veterans.  This
 benefit is not extended to those on active
 duty for training.
 Presumption  of  service  connection      of
 chronic and tropical diseases: This presump-
 tion  of  service  connection  of                                                                                                                                           numerous
 chronic and tropical diseases, as listed in
 section 301, title 38, United States Code, now
 applicable to war veterans, is extended to
 those veterans with service after January
 31, 1955.
 Burial flags: The bill will permit the Vet-
 erans' Administration to furnish a flag for
 draping the casket of deceased veterans of
 service after January 31, 1955, as is now pro-
 vided war veterans.
 Job counseling and job placement assist-
 ance: Places veterans discharged after Janu-
 ary 31, 1955, on the same basis as veterans
 of earlier conflicts for assistance through the
 Department of Labor in job placement and
 counseling.
 Soldiers' and sailors' civil relief: Amends
 the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act by
 increasing protection for individuals who are
 renting homes when called to service from
 $80 monthly rental to $150 monthly rental.

 Appointment of Jack Hood Vaughn To
 Head the Peace Corps
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February.10, 1966
 Mr. OTTINGP:R.  Mr. Speaker, it was
 my privilege to visit the other body yes-
 teida,y and to testify before the Foreign
 Relations Committee on the nomination
 of jack flood Vaughn, to be the Direc-
 tCr of the Peace Corps.
 While my primary purpose in testify-
 ing; was to urge the committee to ap-
 prove Mr.. Vaughn's nomination, I also
 discussed the role of the Peace Corps in
 our oversea assistance efforts.
 Because of the great respect I have for
 Mr. Vaughn and the importance I at-
 tach to the position to which he has been
 nominated,  I  thought  my  testimony
 would be of interest to our colleagues and
 oiler it herewith for insertion into the
 RECORD.
 TESTIMONY OF 11ow. RICHARD L. OTTING1:1t, 01.
 NEW YORK, BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE
 ON  FOREIGN  RELATIONS,  RELATIVE  TO  THE
 NOMINATION OF JACK H. VAUGHN, AS DurEc-
 TOR OF THE PEACE Coups, FEERIIARY 9,                                                                         1966
 Mr. Chairman, I am grateful and delighted
 at the opportunity you have afforded rise to
 testify in behalf of the nomination of Sack
 Hood Vaughn for Director of tie Peace Itrrps.
 I warmly endorse his nomination.
 While I know it, is usual to speak pri-
 marily of a nominee's qualifications at t.i.ese
 clearings, 1. should like to concentrate first
 on the importance of the position, for I think
 it has been, underrated both. in Congress and
 by the public.
 'rhe Peace Corps too often still tod is is
 viewed as a mere idealistic outlet to absorb
 the energies of the starry--eyed do-gor rlers
 of our society.  While under the brlliiant
 leadership of Sargent Shriver it has or. 'red
 universal praise from the complete spectrum
 of our society-from its most conservative to
 its most liberal elements-its weight and im-
 portance is still not generally recognized.
 One has but to ponder that one of the Presi-
 dent's highest aids, Bill Moyers, aspired to
 this post as the "Everest" of his ambitions,
 to come to second thoughts about its sig-
 nificance.
 In may view, the Peace Corps demonstrates
 an approach to success in our endeavors with
 the developing countries, where all other ap-
 proaches have to a greater or lesser degree
 failed.  I think I will meet little argument
 that the future of the world and of our role
 in the world lies ;largely with these develop-
 ing nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin. Amer-
 ica.
 The Peace Corps has proved the validity
 of working from the bottom up rather than
 from the top down in these countries.  It
 hags demonstrated', the success potential of
 community development techniques of hav-
 ing our people live with the people they are
 assisting in the slums that surround all of
 the major cities of these countries and in
 the countryside in the rural peasant villages.
 It has  demonstrated the  importance  and
 practicality of stimulated self-help--and the
 economy of such programs.  It has shown
 that work in primitive societies does not
 necessarily  require  top technical back-
 ground--that  the  average  citizen  of                                                                                                                                     this
 country can play a meaningful role in the
 development of a country where infant mor-
 tality is over 50 percent and the people dr)n't
 know the significance of feces disposal, water
 impurities, or sound diet.  It has proved the
 feasibility and efficacy of intensive language
 and  cultural  preparation  of  our  foreign
 cadres, of having them live within the com-
 munities they serve rather than in isolated
 American ghettos., of having them receive
 compensation   comparable   to  their   host
 counterparts and play roles not as superior
 advisers but as coequals.
 The future expansion of our foreign assist-
 ance endeavors should be along lines dem-
 onstrated successful by the Peace Corps-.
 and no more appropriate person could be
 found than Jack Hood Vaughn to preside
 over this extension.
 Indeed, by standards of experience, knowl-
 edge,  ability,  personality,  character,  and
 temperament, no equal could be conjured.
 Jack Vaughn is a close personal friend and
 became so when he was my bass at the
 Peace Corps. He was RegionalDirector for
 Latin America and I, Director of Programs
 for the west coast of South America under
 him, virtually from the start of the Peace
 Corps.
 I, therefore, am able to speak of him from
 a vantage point of an associate as well .'s a
 friend, and as a person intimately familiar
 with the Peace Corps operation he is  to
 head, for I was the second staff mctnher
 brought on board by Mr. Shriver to formu-
 late the concept of a Peace Corps early in
 1961.  I can also speak of him from a pa-_
 sonal  familiarity  with  his  knowledg:: or
 Latin America and the respect Latins hold
 for him.
 What an unusual combination of
 ence.  Jack Vaughn has served In virtu sly
 all of our overseas agencies--the State 1),-
 pa.rtmen.t as Assistant Secretary of State f r
 Latin America and before that as Ambae::' -'l+,r
 to Panama.: our foreign aid agency as mis-
 sion director in Senegal; he started his Cloy
 ernment career in the early days of Uhf
 A
 in Bolivia and Costa Rica; and, of course, he
 served as a. Regional Director of the Peace
 Corps itself.
 The geographic  diversity of his             foreign
 experience has been broad, bringing him in
 direct coat:,et with two of the three i i! t.i-
 cents of the world with which the I'd-lie
 Corps deals-Africa and Latin America--aid
 with incomparable breadth and depth where

 February 10 A~gnued ForWgR(J9RM$P6714~Bqg,0400020004-2
 the greatest Peace Corps concentration of ac-
 tivity lies, in Latin America.
 Jack Vaughn's rise to responsibility has
 been meteoric and hard won.  He came up
 the hard way, by his bootstraps.  It's a real
 American success story worthy of Horatio
 Alger-how a golden gloves fighter from Co-
 lumbus,  Mont.,  going under the inauspi-
 cious pseudonym of "Johnny Hood" made
 good.  He graduated  from  the    University
 of Michigan in 1943 and volunteered for the
 Marine Corps where his talents earned him
 promotion from private to captain In just
 3 years. He got a master's degree from
 Michigan when he got out and taught there
 and at the University of Pennsylvania.  In
 1949 he offered his services to USIA and from
 there had the spectacular span of Govern-
 ment service and rise of personal success
 previously recounted.
 In the Peace Corps, Jack Vaughn built
 the Latin  American  program from  insig-
 nificance to the dominant program.                            He was
 a man who was universally respected in a
 highly competitive organization and whose
 advice and counsel were sought by all.  As
 a boss, he encouraged his associates to inno-
 vate and inspired from them an indescribable
 devotion which led to uncanny productivity.
 This human quality no doubt played an im-
 portant part in his continuing series of suc-
 cesses and his warm following among his
 associates and the foreign peoples with whom
 he worked.  He was immensely popular and
 respected both as Ambassador to Panama and
 previously as ICA mission chief in Senegal
 as well as at his other posts.  The universal
 acclaim he received from all Latin capitals
 during his recent trip as Assistant Secretary
 of State is well known and recognized as a
 major contribution to our Latin American
 relations.
 It gives me great pleasure to give this
 nomination my unqualified praise and to
 urge upon you and the committee the con-
 firmation of a most unusually well qualified
 man for this job of, great national and inter-
 national importance.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. FRANK E. EVANS
 OF COLORADO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 10, 1966
 Mr. EVANS of Colorado. Mr. Speaker,
 although Hanoi and Peiping have thus
 far  given                   only  negative  responses  to
 peace overtures, we are continuing the
 search for a door which will one day
 lead to. peace.                    We can be encouraged
 that efforts toward peace are being taken
 by the United Nations, by the Pope, by
 various governments, as well as by pri-
 vate diplomatic explorations.
 And we can all be encouraged by the
 bold and positive move which our Presi-
 dent took in going to Hawaii.
 In an editorial dealing with the mis-
 sion to Hawaii, the New York Journal-
 American commented that it will be of
 great advantage for President Johnson to
 meet personally with the two ranking
 South Vietnames delegates, and it adds:
 Indeed, the meeting will be of equal ad-
 vantage for the Vietnamese.  Direct, blunt
 talks between the leaders of the two Govern-
 ments can only result In closer understand-
 ing of each other's problems and an improved
 cooperation in pursuing the was.
 The newspaper concludes that "once
 again President Johnson has made a. bold
 and positive move with regard to the ex-
 plosive Far East situation, and the Na-
 tion should solidly support him in his
 effort."
 I think many of my colleagues may
 want to read the editorial in its entirety,
 and with this in mind, I submit it for the
 RECORD.
 MISSION TO HAWAII
 President Johnson's sudden trip to Hawaii
 to confer with top American and South Viet-
 namese officials on the Vietnam war is further
 evidence of the mounting gravity of that
 cdnflict  and                   of  the  administration's  pre-
 occupation with ending it.
 Significantly,  it marks  L.B.J.'s first de-
 parture from the continental United States
 since becoming President.
 Hawaii is a logical place for so top-level a
 conference. As well as being the closest the
 President should go to Vietnam, as far as his
 personal safety is concerned, Hawaii is also
 the command center of all American military
 operations in and off Vietnam.
 Gen. William C. Westmoreland, American
 commander  in  Vietnam,  reports  to  the
 Hawaii  headquarters  of Adm.  Ulysses  S.
 Grant Sharpe, commander of U.S. forces in
 the Pacific. In turn, Admiral Sharpe reports
 to the Pentagon, which then reports to Presi-
 dent Johnson.                                                                                 Thus the President is, in ef-
 fect,  temporarily  shortening  this                                                                              lengthy
 chain of command by his visit.
 It will also be of great advantage for Presi-
 dent Johnson to meet personally with the
 two ranking    South  Vietnamese delegates,
 Premier Nguyen Cao Ky and Chief of State
 Nguyen Van Thieu.
 Indeed, the meeting will be of equal advan-
 tage for the Vietnamese.                                                                               Direct, blunt talks
 between the leaders of the two Governments
 can only result in closer understanding of
 each other's problems and in improved co-
 operation in pursuing the war.
 Once again President Johnson has made a
 bold and positive move with regard to the
 explosive Far East situation, and the Nation
 should solidly support him in b.is effort.
 Thaddeus Kosciuszko-Hero of Two
 Worlds
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. EDWARD P. BOLAND
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 7, 1966
 Mr. BOLAND.                             Mr. Speaker, on Feb-
 ruary 12, Americans and Poles alike cele-
 brate the anniversary of the birth of
 Thaddeus Koscluszko, Polish soldier and
 statesman. His unswerving dedication to
 the great cause of national independence
 for both the United States and Poland
 earned him the title of "hero of two
 worlds."
 Thaddeus Kosciuszko was a man of ac-
 tion, of great courage, and of an undying
 belief in the right of every nation to be
 free. When the American Revolution
 erupted, he hastened to this continent to
 fight for American independence.. To the
 cause he brought -great skill as an engi-
 neer and great personal valor, and in 1783
 a grateful United States of America ex-
 tended to him the privilege of American
 citizenship and the deepest thanks of the
 American Congress.
 A693
 His task in America done, Kosciuszko
 returned to his beloved Poland to join in
 the struggle to prevent the third and final
 partition by Russia, Prussia, and Austria.
 The Polish patriots, led by General Kos-
 ciuszko, defeated the Russians. at Ra-
 clawice and ably defended the beautiful
 city of Warsaw but were at last overcome
 by the superior numbers of the enemy.
 In the battle of Maciejowice on Octo-
 ber 10, 1794, the gallant Poles were de-
 feated and their leader was taken pris-
 oner by the Russians. Released 2 years
 later, General Kosciuszko dedicated the
 rest of his life to efforts to obtain Polish
 independence.
 Mr. Speaker, the torch of freedom has
 been passed to our generation of Ameri-
 cans and Poles.  We gain inspiration
 from the great hero Thaddeus Kosci-
 uszko and on this day reconsecrate our
 lives to the great cause of freedom to
 which he gave his best.
 New England's Economic Comeback

 HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 10, 1966
 Mr. CONTE.                                                                               Mr. Speaker, the eco-
 nomic headaches we in New England
 have suffered almost since the end of
 World War II are a familiar story to
 most Americans.                                                                          While the country in
 general progressed and moved forward
 to new records of prosperity each year,
 New England for a long time lagged be-
 hind.  We were in a virtual depression
 while the rest of the Nation enjoyed an
 unprecedented boom.
 We lost the bulk of our textile indus-
 try.  Because of economic stagnation, we
 lost our young people who migrated to
 the areas of greater opportunity.  We
 lost industry, manpower, and economic
 resources.
 But as dramatically as the nightmare
 began, so apparently has it ended.
 New England has bounced back. To-
 day it is an economic success story of
 major proportions.
 Those of us who are privileged to serve
 the six great States that comprise the
 New England region are justly proud of
 the progress, the imagination, the initia-
 tive, and courage that are so much a part
 of New England traditions and which
 have been demonstrated again so well in
 recent years.
 This week the pages of the U.S. News
 & World Report magazine contained
 .an 'excellent story about our economic
 comeback.. The article deals specifically
 with the causes behind both our eco-
 nomic decline and our unprecedented re-
 juvenation.  Credit is given where it is
 due-primarily to the businessmen and
 industrialists, to the economists and
 planners who could see through the des-
 pair of one generation to the bright op-
 portunities of another; who could re-
 member the resourcefulness and op-
 timism of a bygone day when New Eng-

 truly the Hub of the Universe.
 The adaptation of existing resources to
 modern problems, the initiation of im-
 portant  new  industries  keyed  to the
 unique skills and capabilities of the New
 liingland region lie behind our success
 story.
 f feel the aforementioned magazine
 article deserves to be read by all Ameri-
 cans and certainly by the Members of
 this body.  In. my opinion it contains
 some valuable seeds of wisdom for those
 of us whose job it is to ponder the scope
 and efficacy of government with respect
 to regional economic problems.  I there-
 fore have asked unanimous consent to
 reprint the article in full at this point in
 the RECORD, and respectfully commend it
 to the attention of my distinguished col-
 leagues.
 The article follows:
 NEW ENGLAND'S BIG COMEBACK:  LATEST
 ScrccESS STORY
 BoszoN:-New England today is enjoying
 a boom unprecedented in history-and one
 which is steadily gaining momentum.
 't'he upswing is broadly based.  It extends
 to nearly every major industry and to almost
 every community of the six-State area.
 Employment  in  New  England  in  1965
 moved past the 4 million mark-the highest
 on record. Gains were reported not only in
 the region's factories, but also In a number
 of service industries of growing importance
 to Its economy. Among these are insurance,
 financial, and business services, medical serv-
 ice, education, and recreation.
 Construction, which trailed the rest of the
 country's Industries last year, reached new
 levels.   Spending for plant and equipment
 rose 18 percent in the region in 1965, and a
 similar increase is forecast for this year.
 Throughout New England, unemployment
 is low and labor scarce.  It is not just skilled
 labor  and  technical  employees  that  are
 needed.   Many employers would be overjoyed
 to  find  unskilled  workers who  could be
 trained.  Help-wanted advertisements in the
 major newspapers are at an alltirne high.
 Some areas are running short of housing for
 recently hired workers and their families.
 UP f'ROM ADVERSITY
 The current boom is something new and
 welcome in New England.  Since the end of
 World War II, the region's economic growth
 had consistently lagged well behind that of
 the Nation as a whole.  Regional compari-
 sons usually had shown New England bring-
 ing up the rear in nearly every measure of
 economic progress.
 Many of New England's woes were trace-
 able to the loss of a big segment of an im-
 portant industry-textiles.  Scores of major
 firms picked up stakes and moved to the
 South  to take  advantage of lower  wages,
 land costs, and taxes, and to be closer to raw
 materials and major customers.
 Left behind were factories of Civil War
 vintage, blighted cities and pockets of mas-
 sive unemployment.
 Other long-established industries-shoes,
 shipbuilding, fishing, and paper-either de-
 clined or showed slow growth.
 The States, particularly Maine and Ver-
 mont, suffered  heavy losses of workers as
 residents moved out to find new ,jobs.  Says
 one Vermont ollicial of that period:    "Our
 biggest export was our young folks."
 New England came to be viewed by the
 rest of the country as worn out, ultracon-
 servative, lacking vitality, and removed from
 the mainstream of postwar prosperity.     As
 one Connecticut official remembers it, "Peo-
 pie came to think of New England as hiving
 nothing to offer but stone fences, lobster
 pots, wooden bridges, and Yale University."
 THE SPREAD OF SUCCESS
 A unique feature of New England's new-
 found prosperity is that the northern tier
 of States---New Hampshire, Maine, and Ver-
 mont-is sharing in the uptrend.  Even in
 good times, these States usually had lagged
 behind southern New England.  Connecticut
 for many years has been better off than the
 rest of the region and unhappy over being
 tarred with the same brush.
 Now the fastest-growing State in New Eng-
 land                                                                    is  New  Hampshire.          Unemployment
 there is the lowest in the Nation.  In 1.965,
 unemployment averaged 2.9 percent of the
 State's labor force, compared with D. national
 figure of 4.6 percent.  Industrial construction
 in New Hampshire in 1965 was up 400 percent
 from the 1964 figure.
 BEHIND 'L'IIE BOOM:  BRAINPOWER
 What has happened to change the picture
 in. New England so suddenly?
 Many of the region's top economic experts
 admit they are si,umped for an answer.  One
 explains it this way: "It is all very vague,
 ylou cannot measure it by statistics.  But, New
 England today h.as.a competitive advantage
 over other areas.  This advantage boils down
 to this-b:rainpower."
 Long a leader in the field of education,
 New England lately has been getting a big
 payoff from this investment.   The brain-
 power advantage is traceable, mainly, to the
 big three of its prestige universities-  Har-
 vard, Yale  and,  especially, the Massachu-
 setts Institute of Technology.
 MIT  is a  university   completely      built
 around science and technology.  Because of
 its pioneering work in electronics, it was
 selected  as the site  of the    Government's
 World War II research laboratory that per-
 fected radar.                                                                        This was a huge effort, com-
 parable to the Manhattan project, which de-
 veloped the atom bomb.  Top scientific and
 engineering personalities were drawn to MIT
 from all over the United States.
 Another wartime laboratory at MI'1' did
 early work on guidance systems and  fire-
 control techniques.  Today, the university is
 heavily engaged 'in guidance systems for mis-
 siiles such as Polaris and for the Apollo moon
 vehicle.
 When Soviet Russia exploded a nuclear
 bomb in 1949, the Federal Government called
 on. MIT to develop an intercontinental de-
 fe:ase system.  A new laboratory was  built
 on. Route 128, a highway that encircles all
 of Boston but the waterfront.  In the process
 of developing the new system, major ad-
 vances were made in computer technology.
 Among universities, MIT is the largest com-
 pleter research center in the world.
 OFFSPRING OF MIT
 To supply the new laboratory with needed
 parts and materials, a number of small firms
 began to spring up along Route 128.  Many
 top scientists and engineers left the labora-
 tory to form their own firms, to exploit their
 knowledge in a new and expanding tech-
 nology.
 With MIT spawning new ideas, with top-
 notch scientists and engineers, and new com-
 panies, the Boston area became a leader in
 the field of electronics and research-oriented
 industry based on new technology.
 Once a country road, Route 128 today is
 bordered by new plants.  A recent survey
 showed 574 firms along the highway, em-
 ploying nearly 5:1,000 people.  Included were
 almost 100 manufacturing firms, 66 research
 companies, and 56 engaged in both research
 anal manufacturing.  Since 1962, there has
 been a 45-percent increase in the number of
 firms along the golden semicircle, as it is
 now called.
 Graduates of MIT, who once left New Eng-
 land to take jobs in more prosperous areas,
 now seem to prefer to settle in or near Bos-
 ton and to work in one of the many labora-
 tories or electronics firms.   Says an MIT
 official:
 "As top scientists moved into this area,
 more and more younger men wanted to Come
 and rub elbows with them. They were at-
 tracted, too, by the cultural advantage of the
 New England area.  Culture is an 'in' thing
 with these highly educated people.  We have
 more Ph. D.'s per acre around here than
 any other place in the country."
 Recently, MIT set up four new research
 centers-space sciences, life sciences, earth
 sciences and materials science and engineer-
 ing.  Coming is one in communications-
 There is no evidence that the birth of new
 firms is slackening.  It appears more likely
 to  increase.  University  officials  say  that
 revolutionary changes may be ahead in the
 field  of  biology.  Some  new  fields    being
 studied by MIT's laboratories include ocean-
 ography and medical instrumentation.
 Other major New England universities also
 a.re- beginning to expand research activities.
 SEARCH FOR PLANT SITES
 The mushrooming growth of electronics
 and related research firms is by no means
 confined to Route 128 or the Greater Boston
 area.                           Successful firms seeking sites for new
 plants are pushing out into southern New
 Hampshire and, to a lesser extent, Maine
 and Vermont.  Connecticut and Rhode Is-
 land, as well, are gaining new industries.
 The growing interest in siting plants in
 northern New England is due, in part, to a
 desire to get away from big-city congestion
 and   problems.  Vermont,   for   example,
 stresses its "moral climate" in newspaper ads.
 Says one: "Vermont has no really big cities
 with snarled  transportation, strife, crime,
 bureaucratic waste, poor housing, air pollu-
 tion and all the other seemingly hopeless
 problems of large metropolitan areas today."
 INDUSTRY FIT TO AREA
 The growth of research-oriented industry
 fits in perfectly with New England's needs.
 The region does pose handicaps for mass-
 production industries.  It is poorly situated
 with respect to the center of U.S. population.
 It has high transportation and electric-power
 costs, and is Lacking in most raw materials.
 Because of these deficiencies, New England
 is specializing more in low-bulk, high-value
 products.  "Even in electronics," comments
 one observer, "when something is developed
 suitable for mass production, it is usually
 produced elsewhere.  Then the research peo-
 ple come up with something new.  We have
 to keep running all the time."
 Throughout the region, there has been a
 steady shift to new products and procedures
 based on research.   A study in 1955 showed
 about one third of factory employment, de-
 pended on products not in existence a decade
 earlier.  A similar study today, experts say,
 would show this figure to be about one half
 of total manufacturing employment.
 New Englanders believe that their combi-
 nation of brainpower and a skilled, adaptable
 labor force will enable the region to keep
 abreast of new developments.  They also see
 the growth  of research-based industry  as
 giving New England a stability it never had
 before.
 NEW ROLE FOR OLDER INDUSTRIES
 Some long-established industries also have
 played a role in New England's upswing.
 One of the most important of these is
 transportation equipment.  United Aircraft,
 centered in Connecticut, is the region's big-
 gest private  employer.  Its                                                                                                                               payroll  is ap-
 proaching 70,000 and has been increasing at
 a rate of 1,000 a month as the firm seeks to
 keep up with orders for jet engines, :heli-
 copters  and  other  aircraft  components.

 Another big employer,  General  Dynamics'
 Electric Boat division at Groton, Conn., has
 built much _of the U.S. nuclear-submarine
 fleet.  It has been stepping up production,
 hiring more workers.  A large number com-
 mute from Rhode Island.
 The machine-tool Industry, long impor-
 tant to the area's economy, is showing new
 strength.    Employment  in  this  industry
 tends to rise and fall in line with capital
 spending by firms across the country.  With
 plant-and-equipment   spending     at  high
 levels, and further gains projected, the in-
 dustry is expected to continue to lend its
 weight to the boom.
 TEXTILES: NO LONGER A DRAG
 Even the textile Industry, which for many
 years acted as a drag on New England's econ-
 omy, added slightly to its payrolls in 1965.
 During the-, postwar period, employment in
 the industry had fallen from 275,000 t9 about
 100,000, but now it appears to have stabilized
 at that level.  Most of the cotton-textile in-
 dustry already has been lost, and remaining
 firms produce   mostly woolen  yarns  and
 fabrics-a more expensive product.
 The leather and shoe industry has been
 adding workers. Much of it has shifted out
 of older Massachusetts towns with high wage
 rates to newer plants in Maine and New
 Hampshire.  The area continues to produce
 one third of the leather footwear made in
 United States.
 Shipbuilding, which had been in the dol-
 drums for years is-showing new life-partly
 as the, result of growing defense needs.
 There also has been heavy- new investment
 in the paper industry, important to Maine.
 New England's biggest growth, however,
 has not been in manufacturing, but in serv-
 ices.   This includes a whole grab bag of
 activities.                                       -
 Among the most important is medicine.
 The Boston area is one of the world's major
 medical centers.  Doctors and patients come
 from Europe, Latin America and other parts
 of the world for training or treatment.
 Education is another big service, and New
 England is the leader in the field.  Harvard,
 Yale, MIT and Brown, plus a host of smaller
 schools such as Darthiouth, Amherst, Wil-
 liams, and Middlebury, are among the Na-
 tion's top-rated educational institution.
 Many of the largest insurance firms have
 headquarters in New England, especially in
 the Boston and Hartford areas.  Boston is
 one of the four largest financial centers in
 the United States.  Its investment houses
 handle most of the major mutual funds.
 WINTER PLAYGROUND, TOO
 New England always has been a popular
 arear for summer vacations, and its share of
 the recreation industry is growing steadily.
 In  1965,         excellent - weather brought huge
 gains in the tourist business.
 Now, the region is. experiencing a winter-
 vacation boom.   Ski resorts are rising all
 over, especially in the northern tier. Building
 of new lodges, motels, and roads has had a
 major impact on the construction industry.
 It is also driving up land prices.  In one part
 of Vermont where land sold 5 years ago for
 about $5 an acre-less than it cost in 1760-
 the price rose to $200 an acre or more when
 a new ski-center went up nearby.
 Vermont has the fanciest of the new ski
 resorts.  Some offer such lures as heated out-
 door swimming pools, sauna baths, ice skat-
 ing, closed gondolas to take people up ski
 slopes, rather than T-bar lifts or rope tows,
 and   cocktail  lounges,  night  clubs,  and
 theaters.
 The 1965-66 ski season got off to a roaring
 start.   A 40-inch snowfall in Vermont in
 December is estimated to have been,worth
 $250,000 an inch to the State.   Holiday ski
 business in some areas ran 200 percent ahead
 of last season.       -
 THN.- MULTIPLIER  EFFECT
 Skiing has what is called a "multiplier ef-
 fect."   State officials estimate that, for $1
 spent- for, skiing, an additional $4 is spent
 for food, lodging, liquor, entertainment, gas-
 oline and other needed goods and services.
 Northern New England is one of the few
 undeveloped areas left, in the Eastern United
 States. It is accessible to huge population
 centers in both the United States and Can-
 ada.  Roads are being improved, making it
 easier to reach.  With more people having
 3 weeks or more of vacation a year, many
 employers are urging Workers to take part
 of their vacation in winter-and New Eng-
 land is benefiting from this trend.
 New England also is getting a boost from
 another development-the  desire of many
 American families to own two homes.  More
 and more high income families  that live
 along the eastern seaboard want to get away
 from the  congestion.   With increased in-
 terest in skiing and other winter sports, peo-
 ple can use a second home in winter as well
 as in summer.  This two-house trend is add-
 ing to the rise in land values, especially in
 southern Vermont and New Hampshire.
 CITIES: MIRRORS  OF  PROSPERITY
 The effects of prosperity can be seen by
 driving  through  some, of  New  England's
 cities.
 Greater Boston,  still the "hub" of New
 England with 3.2 million of the region's 11.2
 million people, has been changed radically
 In appearance by a group of new buildings.
 In 1965, the $160 million Prudential Cen-
 ter, which now dominates the Boston skyline,
 opened its doors.  In process -of construction
 is a $200 million Government center in the
 heart of the city.  The first building of the
 center to be completed, a $26 million State
 office building, was opened last year.  Just
 finished is  a new Federal  office building.
 Still under construction: a large, crescent-
 shaped office building and a new city hall.
 Another skyscraper nearing completion is
 the State Street Bank building, adjacent to
 the financial district.   It was financed by
 British investors.
 Construction Is about to start on a $60
 million  electronics-research center for the
 National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
 tion.  It. will rise close to MIT, across the
 Charles River from downtown Boston.
 Boston also is having a boom in apartment
 construction.  A large, high-rise building is
 going up across from the Boston Common.
 Others  have   been  built  overlooking  the
 Charles River and in outlying sections of the
 city.
 Progress is being made on new highways
 and expressways.  In 1965, the last link of
 the Massachusetts Turnpike was completed,
 bringing  it  into the  downtown  part  of
 Boston.                                  -
 Urban renewal is evident in many other
 cities of New, England. Hartford and New
 Haven in Connecticut have completed huge
 projects that have revitalized large areas.
 A further example of a city which has
 come back is Providence, RS.    For many
 years, this city was listed as a "depressed
 area" by the Department of Labor, with '!sub-
 stantial                                                                                   and  persistent  unemployment."
 Last May, Providence and its environs were
 taken off the list.  In October, joblessness
 was down to 3.9 percent-lowest figure in
 15 years.
 Providence has been helped by a new inter-
 state highway which cuts through the cen-
 ter of the city and links It closely to Boston
 on the north and New York on the south.
 The  highway  has  opened  new  industrial
 sites, and the city could become an impor-
 tant distribution center.
 More spectacular than the progress of
 some of the larger cities is the change that
 has taken place in scores of smaller cities
 which were hardest hit when their textile
 mills closed their doors and moved south.

 THE NASHUA STORY
 Nashua, N.H., lost its major textile em-
 ployer in 1948.  In an effort to find jobs for
 thousands of people thrown out of work, a
 tax-free, nonprofit foundation was set up to
 buy the mill properties and either sell or
 lease them to any prospective employer.
 Today, hardly a square foot of factory space
 is' available of the- 21/2 million square feet
 originally purchased.   Instead of one firm
 employing 3,500 workers, the space is oc-
 cupied by 24 .separate firms employing more
 than 6,000 workers.
 In addition, the city has 16 new plants-
 five of them built by firms which outgrew
 their space in the old mill.  Manufacturing
 employment, which stood at 8,400 before the
 textile plant left, has grown to 13,000.
 Nashua, in fact, now has a labor shortage.
 Firms in the  area are estimated to    have
 2,000 jobs they are unable to fill.  As 1965
 ended,  unemployment  was  down      below 2
 percent of the labor force.
 Much of the same story is true of Man-
 chester.   After the loss of a huge textile
 mill, Manchester had staggering unemploy-
 ment.                                                                                                                                         Like Nashua, it Is now booming, has
 a much more diversified industry and is look-
 ing for more workers.
 Another city which has gone from bust
 to boom is Burlington, largest city in Ver-
 mont.-                                                                                                                                         It lost its major employer, a large
 woolen  mill.   Burlington took a different
 tack.   Instead of trying to interest employ-
 ers in the old mill property, business lead-
 ers formed  an industrial corporation  and
 raised money to build a plant on specula-
 tion.                                                                                                                                         They snagged International Business
 Machines. Employment at the plant has
 risen from 500 to 2,500 over the past 18
 months.                                  -
 THE AREA'S SERIOUS PROBLEMS
 New England is not without problems.
 Railroad service is poor-Maine is the first
 State to be inaccessible to passengers on
 regular schedules by rail-but expected merg-
 ers of New England railroads with major rail
 networks may help.
 The threat of severe drought hangs over
 the region unless it gets heavy winter snows
 and spring rains.
 Some of the older cities still have financial
 problems and urban blight.  Others have ex-
 ceptionally high property taxes that could
 discourage new industry.       -
 Another worry is that much of the boom
 in industries such as electronics, shipbuild-
 ing-and transportation equipment is due to
 defense orders.  Any major cutback in de-
 fense spending could have a heavy impact.
 But many business leaders aware of this
 danger are making efforts to diversify.
 Right now, however, New England's great-
 est problem is its labor shortage.  Both gov-
 ernment and business leaders are making
 concerted efforts to attract labor.
 Some employers are considering trying to
 recruit Cuban refugees, or Puerto Ricans and
 Negroes from  crowded  eastern cities. - At
 present, New England has few nonwhites.
 Vermont's population Is .002 percent Negro.
 Many New Englanders say they would like
 to  keep the racial balance the way it  is
 now.
 IS THE COMBACK PERMANENT?
 Because  of  New England's  large urban
 population and heavy industrialization, few
 experts believe the region can match newer
 areas such as the Southwest or Far West in
 growth rates.                              But they see the present boom
 as more than a cyclical revival.
 "The east coast still has the Nation's big-
 gest market, the biggest population," says
 an industrial development official in Con-
 necticut.
 And, it appears, the-view that New England
 is decrepit, out of time with modern times,
 will have to be reviewed and updated as the
 boom continues.
