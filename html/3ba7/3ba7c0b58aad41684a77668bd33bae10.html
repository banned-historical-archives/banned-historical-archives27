 Leadership Appearances: A Non-Pattern
 A series of major events in Peking--the Kim
 Il-song visit, rallies in support of communist vic-
 tories in Cambodia and Vietnam and May Day--brought
 most of China's leaders into public view.  Not all
 leaders appeared at all events, however.  Some
 failed to appear at events they would normally be
 expected to attend, and others appeared in unusual
 capacities at other festivities.
 Among the more surprising inconsistencies was
 the non-appearance of Politburo member Chang Chun-
 chiao at the festivities surrounding Kim's visit
 and both the Cambodia and Vietnam rallies.   Chang
 has often assumed hosting duties on behalf of visit-
 ing foreign communist delegations, but his absence
 from all functions associated with visiting com-
 munists raises questions about whether he has re-
 linquished this role in light of his recent accumu-
 lation of other duties.   Chang does not appear to
 be in any political trouble.   He did appear on May
 Day, and his article in last month's issue of Red
 Flag continues to be cited frequently in the pro-
 vincial propaganda, sometimes without reference to
 the earlier article by fellow Politburo member Yao
 Wen-yuan.
 Yao emerged in an unusual role during the Kim
 Il-song visit, as the second-ranking participant
 in some of the substantive discussions between Kim
 and Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.   While Yao has
 often hosted visiting journalists on his own, this
 was the first time he is known to have taken part
 in substantive talks with a visiting head of state.
 Yao appeared at all of the recent events in the
 capital, somewhat overshadowing the nominal third
 man in the leadership, Wang Hung-wen.

 Wang was not present for Kim Il-song's arrival
 or departure, and, although he was the highest
 ranking Chinese leader at both banquets during the
 Kim visit, the speeches for the Chinese side were
 given not by Wang but by Teng Hsiao-ping.   Wang's
 protocol ranking in the leadership obviously does
 not automatically entitle him to an important role
 in such major events as the visit of Kim Il-song.
 Moreover, despite his presence at both the Cambodia
 and Vietnam rallies, it was Defense Minister Yeh
 Chieng-ying, rather than Wang, who delivered the
 speeches.
 The appearances of Chiang Ching seemed almost
 arbitrary.   She was on hand to greet Kim Il-song
 but did not see him off.   Although she rarely at-
 tends state banquets, she was present at the banquet
 for Kim but did not attend Kim's reciprocal banquet.
 She attended the Cambodia rally but not the Vietnam
 rally.  Most startling of all she was the only major
 leader, other than Mao and Chou, to miss May Day.
 Her absence was made even more glaring by the pre-
 sentation, given by some ten thousand cultural
 workers, of songs from the operas produced under
 her auspices.   Radio Peking called the presentation
 "by far the biggest festival performance in Peking,"
 begging the question of Chiang Ching's absence.
 Taken together, the recent events in Peking
 and the leadership appearances associated with them
 may give some clues as to the relative importance
 of certain officials.   Chiang Ching's political
 standing, as usual, remains hazy.  Teng Hsiao-ping
 is clearly important, perhaps far more so than his
 sixth-ranking position in the leadership would sug-
 gest.   By contrast, young Wang Hung-wen's performance
 to date does not seem to equal his standing as third
 in the leadership.  The other members of the "second
 generation," particularly Chi Teng-kuei, who himself
 was tied up with the visiting Belgian prime minister

 but managed to appear at all the other events, are
 taking on greater responsibilities.   Although this
 pattern has been discernible since the National
 People's Congress in January, the most surprising
 development is the role of Yao Wen-yuan during the
 visit of Kim Il-song.  Yao has not seemed to figure
 greatly in the growing role of the second genera-
 tion, but his future activities may merit close
 watching.   (CONFIDENTIAL)

 May Day and the Military
 Leadership appearances on May Day suggest that
 while party-army relations remain strained, civil-
 ian leaders in Peking and regional commanders have
 reached a certain accommodation. The campaign to
 strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, which has
 so far emphasized social order and production goals
 and has not been used as a means to attack the mili-
 tary, almost certainly appeals to the vast majority
 of military men on both counts.  While provincial
 turnouts are incomplete, and some missing leaders
 are soldiers who hold party posts, most top ranking
 military men have been accounted for. One previously
 absent leader who had been heavily criticized, former
 Canton Military Region political commissar Jen
 Ssu-chung, has apparently been given a high ranking
 military post in the Tsinan Military Region. The
 effort to ease military men out of party and govern-
 ment posts continues, and with some success, but
 Peking's tactics are quite different than they were
 during the campaign to criticize Lin and Confucius.
 At that time, regional commanders were the targets
 of severe criticism, and seven of them were stripped
 of their provincial party posts in one bold stroke.
 The current standing of the military is typified
 by the appearances of two military region commanders
 who are also politburo members. Shenyang commander
 Li Te-sheng led the turnout in Liaoning. Li, who
 lost his post as head of the PLA's General Political
 Department last year and was dropped from the politburo
 standing committee this year after running into
 serious trouble during the anti-Lin., anti-Confucius
 campaign, had been conspicuously absent from large
 turnouts in Liaoning in April to greet Kim Il-song
 on his arrival and departure from China.   Li's
 political standing remains shaky, but he apparently
 remains Shenyang Military Region commander.

 Canton Military Region commander Hsu Shih-yu,
 who was reported to be visiting a "grassroots unit"
 on May Day, was the only one of the provincial-based
 politburo members who did not head a turnout in his
 provincial capital.   The peculiar treatment accorded
 Hsu seems a sign of political weakness and serves to
 emphasize his separation from the locus of political
 power in the region.   However, the party first sec-
 retary of Kwangtung was also absent from Canton,
 which tends to cloud the meaning of the turnout.
 Other recent indicators are consistent with
 Peking's carrot-and-stick approach toward the mili-
 tary.                              Two provincial military figures who were
 heavily criticized last year and seemed likely purge
 candidates continue to appear in Peking. Han Hsien-chu,
 who was rotated from Fukien to Kansu, and Hsieh
 Chen-hua, who headed Shansi until a play produced
 there was branded a "poisonous weed," were listed
 among members of the party central committee appear-
 ing in the capital.   Neither leader has appeared in
 his province in some time, but they have not yet been
 replaced, either.
 Several military men were publicly rehabilitated
 or given active posts for the first time on May 1.
 Fu Chung-pi, who was Peking Garrison commander until
 his fall in the 1968 purge of acting chief of staff
 Yang Cheng-wu,  is now listed with ranking officers
 of the Peking Military Region. A continuing relation-
 ship with Yang, who is now a deputy chief of staff,
 cannot be established, but Fu certainly has no strong
 ties to his superior, Peking Military Region commander
 Chen Hsi-lien. The appointment appears to be another
 example of the civilian leadership using checks and
 balances to control a politically sensitive military
 command.   Another professional soldier who fell
 early in the Cultural Revolution, former artillery
 commander Wu Kuo-hua, has also returned to active

 ranks, while Tan Cheng, who was the head of the
 General Political Department and a vice-minister
 of defense in the 1950s, was listed as "attending"
 the festivities.
 Pressure on the military nevertheless continues.
 Wu Hsiu-chuan, a former head of the party's
 International Liaison Department, is either a deputy
 chief of staff or, more likely, a deputy director
 of the General Political Department. In either case,
 Wu seems to continue the trend of placing putative
 civilians in high military posts. Moreover, domestic
 propaganda seems to be telling PLA men that they
 will no longer receive preferential treatment in
 the form of urban employment upon demobilization.
 Numerous articles also continue to emphasize that
 local military leaders are to support their party
 and government counterparts at all times.  (SECRET

 May Day in the Provinces
 May Day turnouts in the provinces were con-
 siderably larger than a year ago when the anti-
 Confucius campaign was raging, but less impressive
 than those for National Day (October lst) when a
 major effort was made to project an image of sta-
 bility and unity.  Accounts of this year's festivi-
 ties are notable principally for their blandness.
 There were no major surprises this year.   No
 new first secretaries were named, nor were any
 purges revealed.   Five provinces--Anhwei, Heilung-
 kiang, Hupeh, Liaoning, and Shansi-.-still do not
 have a publicly identified first secretary, and
 civilians continue to head 16 of the 29 provincial-
 level units.                             Military men lead the other eight.
 Anhwei, Chekiang, Fukien, and Kiangsu--four
 of the more troubled provinces--failed to publish
 detailed accounts of their local celebrations,
 indicating that the situation remains unsettled
 there.   Heilungkiang, whose first secretary appar-
 ently was purged recently, also failed to provide
 a name list of those in attendance.  Yunnan, on the
 other hand, turned out in force despite its con-
 tinuing factional struggles.
 A few provincial leaders appeared in Peking.
 Most notable were Jen Jung and Lu Jui-lin, the
 bosses of Tibet and Kweichow, respectively.  Jen may
 be discussing Tibet's long-standing economic and
 supply problems with officials at the center.   Lu
 may be in Peking to discuss Kweichow's persistent
 factionalism,  although rumors of poor health neces-
 sitating trips to the capital for medical treatment
 continue to surface.

 Military Region commander,  and Chiao Lin-i, Canton's
 mayor,  all failed to attend the provincial rally.
 Hsu was reportedly with a "grassroots unit" some-
 where, but no effort was made to account for Chao's
 and Chiao's absence.  There is no evidence to sug-
 gest that either man is in political trouble.   In
 their absence, Kung Shih-chuan, the second ranking
 military man stationed in the province, led the
 turnout.  Kung's role is mildly surprising because
 he was apparently stripped of his provincial party
 titles as a result of the anti-Confucius campaign,
 although he retained his military posts.   It was
 apparently in that capacity--as well as a member
 of the Central Committee--that he led the turnout
 in Kwangtung.
 The top party figures in Inner Mongolia and
 Tsinghai also missed local celebrations.   As was
 the case in Kwangtung, no explanation was offered
 for their absence, and neither man seems to be in
 political difficulty.   Inner Mongolia's number two
 man did attend the festivities in Peking as a mem-
 ber of the Central Committee.
 May Day turnouts indicate that the campaign to
 study the proletarian dictatorship has had little,
 if any, effect on provincial leaderships so far.
 Both national and local leaders have successfully
 managed to keep the campaign focused on impersonal
 behavior patterns and away from the specific actions
 of individuals, including their own.   Recent report-
 ing, however, suggests that this phase of the
 campaign may be coming to an end, and that criticism
 of individuals--which could lead to changes in some
 of the less stable provinces--will begin shortly.

 Chiang Ching: Both a Legalist
 and a Confucianist Be
 Although the anti-Confucius campaign has faded
 into the background, some discussion of the histor-
 ical struggle between legalists and Confucianists
 continues to surface in the propaganda. Two such
 articles recently received in Washington seem to
 take opposing views of Chiang Ching.
 Last year, Chiang Ching's supporters appeared
 to make a case for her to be chosen as Mao's suc-
 cessor by painting a favorable picture of Empress
 Wu, generally regarded as a terrible ruler. The
 spruced-up image of the empress, suddenly called
 a "legalist," was countered by wall posters that
 attacked Empress Wu and linked her directly to
 Madame Mao.
 Chiang Ching's supporters evidently tried again
 in early January with another article on the virtues
 of the "legalist" empress. The timing of the article,
 just after the party central committee had completed
 a new slate of government officers that omitted
 Chiang Ching, may be significant. The article smacks
 of some vengeance over the obstacles Empress Wu/
 Chiang Ching had to overcome to win positions of
 power.
 In addition to repeating the earlier theme that
 Empress Wu ruled China well for many years after her
 husband's death, the article made some specific claims
 that seem to resemble more recent events. Striking
 what appeared to be a rather vindictive note, the
 article lashed out against the court elders who objected
 to the emperor's marriage to Wu and who vigorously de-
 fended the emperor's current wife as one who "should
 not be divorced lightly." The passage seems to refer
 to the controversy surrounding Mao's marriage to
 Chiang Ching, which many party officials opposed,
 and their support for his highly respected wife, Ho

 Tzu-chen, who had made the Long March. In its de-
 fense of Wu, the article noted the emperor was at-
 tracted to her because, among other things, she
 was "well versed in literature," apparently an
 allusion to Madame Mao's cultural aspirations.
 The article also complained that those in power,
 including the court "secretary-general" and some
 who held important government positions, constantly
 conspired against her. Upon assuming the throne,
 the article noted that Empress Wu removed 36 such
 officials, including the prime minister. These
 actions were portrayed in the article as praise-
 worthy, legalist policies.
 By contrast, an article in March on the struggle
 between Confucianism and legalism complained bitterly
 that. the Confucianists used opera to attack the
 legalists, distort historical facts, and advance
 their own cause. Although the article was cast in
 historical terms and the operas attacked are ancient
 ones, the complaints could easily apply to the model
 operas created under Chiang Ching's guidance.
 The article claimed that the operas glorified
 certain Confucianist figures, whose names were
 widely used in the anti-Confucius propaganda last
 year to represent Lin Piao, and eulogized historical
 generals who advocated policies of "national betrayal."
 Chiang Ching's operas, in fact, glorify some military
 men who undoubtedly were originally intended to
 represent Lin Piao, and several of her operas glorify
 the military in general. Last year's anti-Confucius
 propaganda, inter alia, accused not only Lin but some
 regional military commanders of harboring traitorous
 ideas.
 The article noted that none of the old operas
 praised the major legalist figures and that one,
 "The Stubborn Prime Minister," even attacked a

 respected legalist. One of Chiang Ching's operas
 is open to similar charges. Perhaps somewhat akin
 to "The Stubborn Prime Minister," it not only does
 not praise Premier Chou En-lai but actually appears
 to denigrate him and portrays him as "stubborn."
 Lest there be any doubt that the discussion of
 ancient operas has current relevance, the article
 accuses "Lin Piao and company" of using the Confucian
 practice of producing operas as "monuments" to
 themselves. Any operas created after Lin gained power
 in 1966 in fact were done so under Chiang Ching's
 tutelage. Consequently, the article's criticism of
 operas created by Lin "and company" can only refer
 to Chiang Ching's model operas.
 Although the article lauds the "revolution in
 Peking opera," it attributes this not to Chiang Ching
 but to "the proletariat." It concludes with
 ritualistic praise for the model operas but calls
 for "continued effort" to root out Lin Piao's
 influence, particularly the distortion of history,
 in the cultural sphere.  (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Peking is making a major effort to expand its
 international tanker fleet.   The fledgling fleet--
 600,000 dead weight tons acquired since mid-1974
 for more than $150 million--could reach 1 million
 tons by the end of the year.   Tankers account for
 about 80 percent of the international merchant fleet
 total tonnage purchased during the first four months
 in 1975.   By world standards, it is a small fleet.
 The newly acquired tanker fleet will carry an
 increasing share of China's growing petroleum ex-
 ports.                     Crude oil deliveries totaling nearly 9
 million tons are scheduled for this year--8 million
 tons of it to Japan--of which the Chinese may carry
 as much as one third.   The fleet has already car-
 ried one million tons of crude to Japan since July.
 Chinese tankers will also participate in deliveries
 of 650,000 tons to the Philippines, with chartered
 tankers carrying the initial consignments.   (SECRET)

 Another Hat for Chen Hsi-lien
 Peking regional military commander Chen Hsi-
 lien has added another job to his growing list of
 responsibilities. The only military man among the
 newly appointed vice premiers of the government,
 Chen was identified on May 11 as a member of the
 Military Commission, the organization through which
 the party maintains its control over the military.
 Radio Peking coyly refrained from specifying whether
 Chen is a "leading member" of the Military Commis-
 sion or "the" leading member. The distinction is
 important because he could either be one of several
 vice chairmen of the commission or the ranking vice
 chairman, a job generally thought to belong to De-
 fense Minister Yeh Chien-ying.
 Despite Yeh's presence at the military sports
 meet  at which Chen's new job was publicly revealed,
 it was Chen rather than Yeh who gave the opening
 address. Chen welcomed the participants "on behalf
 of the Chinese PLA," the only military leader other
 than Yeh Chien-ying to use those words since the fall
 of Lin Piao. Chen's speech dwelt on military training
 and preparedness and made no reference to a political
 role for the PLA.
 Chen seemed to clash with moderate leaders in
 Peking when he led an attack during the summer of
 1973 on the use of university entrance examinations.
 He was also attacked by historical analogy during
 last year's anti-Confucius campaign. Since that time,
 however, he has performed well in his capacity as
 vice premier and has shown no recent signs of opposi-
 tion to current moderate policies. His apparently
 docile behavior in recent months can perhaps best be
 explained by the number of new jobs he has been given.
 He was transferred to Peking in the rotation of mili-
 tary commanders at the end of 1973, thereby' bringing

 to participate in the national government, and
 giving him an opportunity         possibly limited when
 he was stationed in Liaoning--to be present at all
