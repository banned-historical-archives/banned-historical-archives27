 The Military Situation
 in South Vietnam
 A search-and-destroy opera-
 tion initiated on 18 August by
 two US Marine battalions about
 six miles south of Chu Lai has
 developed into the most signifi-
 cant engagement between Viet
 Cong and US ground forces to
 date.
 One of the marine units exe-
 cuted an amphibious landing while
 the other landed by helicopter
 further inland in an attempt to
 encircle suspected enemy forces.
 The units are supported by US
 naval gunfire.
 By nightfall the Marines,
 reinforced by four additional
 companies,  had succeeded in en-
 circling the enemy's defensive
 positions.   The enemy unit has
 been identified as the 1st Viet
 Cong Main Force Regiment.   Its
 strength is estimated to be ap-
 proximately 2,000 troops.
 Viet Cong losses are now
 officially estimated at 550,
 with 50 taken prisoner.   Nu-
 merous weapons and supplies have
 also been captured.
 US casualties have been of-
 ficially reported as 52 killed
 and 204 wounded.
 Otherwise, recent military
 activity in South Vietnam has
 been characterized by significant
 results from several Vietnamese
 Government operations and con-
 tinued attempts by Viet Cong
 force units to avoid contact.
 Government troops are continu-
 Page  1
 ing their clearing operation along
 Route 19 near the Duc Co
 paramilitary camp in Pleiku
 Province, although Viet Cong
 forces have successfully avoided
 a major engagement since the
 arrival of a large relief column
 at the camp on 11 August.  Cumulative
 results of operations in the
 area since 3 August now total
 434 Viet Cong killed and six
 captured,  as against govern-
 ment losses of 59 killed and
 109 wounded.
 In Phong Dinh Province,
 information obtained from local
 inhabitants concerning the loca-
 tion of a Viet Cong battalion
 contributed to another success-
 ful government operation on 12
 August.   Government troops attacked
 the enemy force from four direc-
 tions and, aided by close air
 support, killed 258 Viet Cong
 while sustaining only 58 casu-
 alties.
 On 17 August, government
 ground forces in Quang Tri Prov-
 ince were also successful in
 making contact with an estimated
 200 Viet Cong following a US B-52
 Stratofortress bomber strike in
 the area on 13 August.   In the
 ensuing activity, 71 Viet Cong
 were killed and sizable quantities
 of food, arms, and ammunition
 were seized by government forces,
 who suffered only light casualties.
 US military authorities in
 Saigon reported that during the
 week ending 14 August, a total of
 1,330 Viet Cong were killed--
 the highest number for any single
 week of the war--while government
 casualties were less than the

 vious week.  Moreover, govern-
 ment troops during the same
 period captured more than twice
 as many weapons from the Viet
 Cong as were lost to the enemy.
 The Political Situation
 In South Vietnam
 Premier Ky and several
 other top Saigon officials de-
 parted on 15 August for four-
 day visits to Taiwan and Bang-
 kok.   Although there are still
 few specific details concerning
 what Ky hopes to accomplish
 from this mission,  he referred,
 on his arrival in Taipei, to
 the possibility of obtaining
 both economic and military aid,
 and to his desire for greater
 solidarity among anti-Communist
 Asian nations.   He has also
 been quoted by the Taiwan press
 as having stressed the need to
 eliminate Communism from both
 North Vietnam and mainland China.
 The South Vietnamese have fre-
 quently pushed this theme over
 the past year and half.
 Although Ky's absence from
 Saigon leaves at least a partial
 political vacuum, there continues
 to be no specific evidence of
 an impending power grab.   Before
 departing,   Ky publicly warned
 that the air force would act to
 quash any coup attempt,  but he
 has shown little outward sign
 of concern.
 Military Situation in the DRV
 Two new SAM sites--the ninth
 and tenth--were uncovered by a
 drone reconnaissance mission of
 12 August.   Site 9,  about six
 Page 3
 miles east-southeast of Hanoi,
 consists of six launch revet-
 ments in a star-shaped configura-
 tion,  a guidance revetment and
 three hold revetments.   The site
 appears complete and is appar-
 ently operational.   Site 10,
 about ten miles south-southeast
 of Hanoi,  is apparently in the
 early stages of construction.
 Both installations lie inside
 the ring of five SAM sites es-
 tablished earlier around Hanoi.
 The North Vietnamese are
 showing increased caution in the
 use of their SAM defenses in an
 effort to prevent their destruc-
 tion by US air attack.   In ad-
 dition to taking advantage of
 the mobility of the SA-2 weapons,
 recently observed DRV tactics
 indicate that the SAM guidance
 radar,  FAN SONG,  is being turned
 on only when approaching target
 aircraft are getting close to
 or are within range of a SAM
 site.   The effectiveness of these
 tactics is apparent in the un-
 successful attempts by US air-
 craft to locate and destroy SAM
 sites outside the Hanoi area on
 13 August.   About 60 sorties
 were flown but no sites were
 detected.   Five US Navy aircraft
 were shot down by ground fire
 while searching for SAMs at low
 altitude.
 Recently available informa-
 tion suggests that some ele-
 ments of the North Vietnamese
 304th Infantry Division may be
 in South Vietnam.   The inter-
 rogation of nine prisoners cap-
 tured at Dong Rene in south-
 central Laos discloses that
 seven of them were members of
 the 9th Regiment of the 304th.

 Three of them claim to have been
 told prior to their departure
 from the 304th garrison area at
 Ninh Binh that they were going
 to South Vietnam.
 Although there has been no
 information concerning the pres-
 ence of 304th Division elements
 in South Vietnam from Viet Cong
 or PAVN captives,  it is possible
 that some elements of the 9th
 Regiment continued southward and
 may now be in South Vietnam.
 Communist Political
 Developments
 North Vietnam emphasized its
 defiance of the US step-up in
 combat strength in South Vietnam
 last week in a statement by Ho
 Chi Minh,  broadcast on 12 August.
 Ho stated flatly that the Viet-
 namese,  faced with two roads,
 "either to fight until victory,
 or to consent to a slave's fate,"
 had chosen the first.   "We shall
 fight until complete victory,"
 Ho said.
 As if to emphasize that the
 US troop increase has not changed
 Hanoi's position on negotiations,
 Ho Chi Minh,  in an interview with
 Le Monde,  reaffirmed that the US
 musf -accept the DRV's four-point
 proposal before a settlement can
 be achieved.   He further insisted
 that the US Government must "give
 tangible proofs" that it accepts
 the four-point stand,  that the
 US must "immediately stop" the
 air attacks on North Vietnam,
 "stop forthwith" the war in South
 Vietnam,  and "withdraw from there "
 all US troops and weapons.
 He avoided committing him-
 self to negotiations in case the
 US agreed to his demand for a
 unilateral cease-fire in Vietnam,
 but his remarks to Le Monde
 serve to strengthen evidence that
 Hanoi is not insisting on the
 withdrawal of US troops as a pre-
 condition for starting talks.

 The Communist World
 Tentative signs have recently
 appeared of deliberate attempts to
 discredit persons within the top
 Soviet  leadership.   This suggests
 that the power struggle expected
 in the wake of Khrushchev's ouster
 could be coming to a head.
 Available information on the
 recent "leaking" to the West of
 Soviet economist A. G. Aganbegyan's
 mid-June critique of the Soviet
 economy raises the possibility
 that the "leak" was engineered
 by the Committee for State Secu-
 rity (KGB) with the presumed in-
 tention of discrediting advocates
 of liberal economic reform.   Sharp
 differences have developed over
 economic policies not only among
 Soviet  economists but also, ap-
 parently, among the top leaders.
 "Operation Aganbegyan," therefore,
 could be a maneuver in a Kremlin
 power struggle.
 The most obvious high-level
 target is Premier Kosygin, though
 the evidence for his occupancy of
 this unenviable position is by no
 means conclusive.  According to
 the Aganbegyan story by a British
 correspondent, Kosygin was so im-
 pressed with Aganbegyan's report
 that "he offered him the top job
 in Gosplan."  This, however, is
 the only evidence at hand of a
 link between Kosygin and Agan-
 begyan.   Furthermore, although
 the premier has been thought to
 view economic reform favorably,
 his statements suggest that he may
 not be too enthusiastic about it.
 Nevertheless, he could be more
 seriously committed to liberal re-
 form than his public speeches in-
 dicate, since he must have provided
 at least some of the pressure for
 current Soviet experimentation in
 economic liberalism.
 If the Aganbegyan "leak" was
 in fact a planned operation, pre-
 sidium member Shelepin seems the
 likely villain behind it because
 of his presumed--though unproven--
 control of the KGB.  Although pub-
 licly echoing an earlier Brezhnev
 statement favorable to economic re-
 form, Shelepin has at the same time
 made a strong appeal for discipline
 and control.   This equivocal posi-
 tion could reflect the play-it-
 safe tactics of a political schemer
 not yet certain of the success of
 his machinations.
 Rumors of a forthcoming shake-
 up at the highest levels of the So-
 viet leadership have been circulat-
 ing for some time
 IThe degree of
 similarity among several of these
 rumors suggests they may have been
 planted with the purpose of in-
 fluencing Kremlin relationships.
 Whether there is any direct con-
 nection between those rumors, the
 KGB, and "Operation Aganbegyan"
 cannot yet be determined.
 The most common elements in
 the rumors discredit Brezhnev's
 abilities, and extol Shelepin's.
 Kosygin is most often portrayed as
 a good administrator, but not a
 contender for political power. The
 persistence of the Brezhnev-Shelepin
 descriptions suggests a deliberate
 attempt to discredit one or the
 other, or possibly both.   At the
 moment there are no good clues to
 the identity of those behind the

 The reappointment of Mar-

 of the influence of ground forces
 proponents in the Soviet mili-
 tary establishment and high-

 mand changes.   A new No. 2 man
 in the general staff and a new
 head of the general staff academy
 have also been designated.
 Marshal Chuykov put his re-
 turn as commander in chief of
 ground forces in the context of
 a comeback for ground forrces ad-
 vocates in a conversation with
 the US      Army attache   in Moscow.
 After revealing his resumption

 and the re-establishment of the
 Ground Forces Headquarters,  he
 added that "some people thought
 they would do away with the
 ground forces,  but they found
 out they couldn't do this."
 Chuykov lost the ground
 forces post during a series of
 organizational changes in July
 1964.   He was apparently down-
 graded for strongly advocating
 the importance of ground forces
 and was left holding only his
 additional job of chief of civil
 defense.   At the same time,  his
 Ground Forces Headquarters was

 Marshal Grechko reportedly was
 given command of the ground
 forces in addition to his duties
 as commander in chief of the
 Warsaw Pact Forces.
 Within the last several
 weeks,  55-year-old General of
 the Army Pavel F.  Batitskiy,
 long-time commander of the
 Moscow air defense district, has
 replaced 65-year-old General
 of the Army Vladimir D.  Ivanov
 as first deputy chief of the
 general staff  (for general af-
 fairs).   Ivanov has been ap-
 pointed chief of the general
 staff academy,  a post apparently
 filled only by an acting chief,
 since Marshal Zakharov left it
 in November 1964 to replace
 Marshal Biryuzov as chief of
 the general staff.
 As the highest ranking
 general staff officer available
 the aging Ivanov is a natural
 choice for the important acad-
 emy post.   The selection of
 Batitskiy for the No.  2 posi-
 tion on the general staff is
 interesting because both he
 and his predecessor Ivanov--
 although veteran ground forces
 officers--were air defense dis-
 trict commanders prior to their
 appointment.   This suggests
 that an air defense background
 has become a requirement for
 the post of first deputy chief
 of the general staff.
 The Chinese Communist re-
 gime has taken several steps re-
 cently to combat what it con-
 siders to be continuing unsatis-
 factory political attitudes among
 military personnel.   Chief among
 these attitudes is the persist-
 ent reluctance of professional
 officers to accept Mao's theories
 of "revolutionary" army build-
 ing as a replacement for modern
 concepts.   Peiping has issued
 stern reminders to military per-
 sonnel not to resist or even re-
 sent party domination--a peren-
 nial sore point with many offi-
 cers.
 On 1 August,  the People's
 Daily,  the party's theoretical
 journal Red Flag, and the Liber-
 ation Army Daily simultaneously
 published a long defense of the
 Page 7
 history of Mao's efforts to im-
 pose party control over the army.
 The article, written by politburo
 member Marshal Ho Lung,  admitted
 that from the first there had
 been stubborn "bourgeois" op-
 position to Mao Tse-tung's mili-
 tary ideas,  and that the party
 had had to cope with such oppo-
 sition "again and again."
 In an allusion to former
 defense minister Peng Te-huai,
 dismissed in disgrace in 1959,
 and to the period of Soviet
 support of the modernization of
 the People's Liberation Army
 (PLA)  from 1954 to 1960,  the
 article said that for a time
 after the regime came to power
 in 1949,  "a few persons who
 stuck to bourgeois views on
 military affairs came to the

 fore again and created trouble
 ....   In the name of building
 a modern regular army,  they ad-
 vocated the abolition of the
 party committee system in the
 army, which in reality meant
 abolishing the leadership of
 the army by the party."   This
 repetition of party concern over
 the PLA's interest in becoming
 a "modern regular army" is the
 most recent indication that ele-
 ments within the PLA remain dis-
 tressed by the withdrawal of
 Soviet support for the modern-
 ization of the army.   Earlier
 indications of PLA disagreement
 with party policy toward the
 Soviet Union were contained in
 secret military documents cap-
 tured in 1961, and in reports
 made to the National People's
 Congress last winter.
 Mao's determination to re-
 store the revolutionary image of
 the PLA and his implied dissat-
 isfaction with officer attitudes
 were also indicated by the 1
 June decision to abolish all
 formal military ranks and to
 remove all insignia from uni-
 forms.  Peiping explained that
 this decision, which marks a
 reversion to the system employed
 during the revolution, was nec-
 essary to make the army "more
 proletarian and militant."
 There have been several subse-
 quent reports that this order
 was accompanied by an unpubli-
 cized cut in pay, about half,
 for officers.
 In mid-July, the regime
 also declared that it would in-
 SECRET
 crease the already intensive
 level of political indoctrina-
 tion given to officers above
 the regimental level.   Senior
 officers were told to devote a
 part of every day to the study
 of Mao's writings and to apply
 his ideas more intensively in
 their daily work "to ensure
 that guns are always in the
 hands of reliable persons."
 Peiping's concern implies
 that the numerous purges and
 continuous indoctrination drives
 conducted in the army by the
 party since 1960 have not been
 entirely successful.   There is
 an apparently significant group
 of "professional" officers who
 believe that party interference
 is excessive and who probably
 disagree with Mao Tse-tung on
 a wide range of issues,  includ-
 ing, in particular, his deter-
 mination to quarrel with Mos-
 cow at the cost of losing mili-
 tary aid, his one-sided stress
 on guerrilla warfare, and his
 belief in the efficacy of a
 popular militia force.

 The current measures to
 increase the "revolutionary

 to impair morale somewhat.   How-

 significantly affect current op-
 erational capabilities, and the
 PLA would almost certainly re-

 FIRST DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW SOVIET FIVE-YEAR PLAN
 Soviet economists have be-
 gun to publicize the forthcom-
 ing five-year economic plan in
 terms that indicate the 1966-70
 period will witness a continua-
 tion of recent trends.   However,
 the basic question of the allo-
 cation of resources among indus-
 try,  agriculture,  defense,  and
 the consumer has yet to be ex-
 plicitly treated in the discus-
 sion.
 Published articles state
 that the so-called "progressive"
 branches of industry--such as
 chemistry, power generation,
 advanced machine building, ra-
 dioelectronics,  and atomic en-
 ergy--will continue to develop
 at rates faster than the aver-
 age for all industry.   Such
 priority growth for these in-
 dustries is said to be justi-
 fied on the grounds that their
 continued high productivity
 will spread throughout the econ-
 omy.                     The articles also note
 that these industries have been
 selected for continued inten-
 sive development because much
 of their output during the next
 five years will be required to
 support the new agricultural
 program.
 Within the chemical indus-
 try,                     the production of synthetic
 fibers, plastics, tires, and
 household chemical products
 will increase at more rapid
 rates than mineral fertilizers
 and pesticides.  Oil and gas
 are slated to increase their
 relative share in the over-all
 fuel picture,  and the high an-
 nual rate of growth of electric
 energy achieved in recent years
 will be maintained through 1970.
 In the machine building
 field,  the emphasis will be on
 improving the quality, dura-
 bility, and precision of the
 most advanced items produced.
 The discussion of the vehicle
 industry repeats Premier Kosy-
 gin's call of last March for
 the increased production of
 trucks and automobiles.
 The articles only describe
 general projections for indus-
 try and do not include planned
 rates of growth, which probably
 have not yet been worked out.
 Discussion of the 1966-70 plan
 for agriculture has thus far
 been solely in terms of summa-
 rizing the extensive program
 announced last March.   A better
 deal for the consumer is im-
 plied by the contemplated faster
 growth of the food and light
 industries, which are said to
 have a crucial role in closing
 the gap between the rates of
 growth of capital and consumer
 goods by 1970.   The future re-
 quirements for defense have
 been noted so far as being met
 most economically by fostering
 the development of the techno-
 logically advanced branches of
 industry.
 will not differ appreciably
 The recent articles com-
 menting on the plan apparently
 are based on the same five-year
 plan draft.   Although this draft
 will undoubtedly be revised be-
 fore it is adopted later this
 year, public discussion of it
 now implies that the final plan

 RECENT SOVIET WHEAT PURCHASES AND THEIR IMPACT
 Moscow is expected to fi-
 nance a significant part of its
 recent contracts with Canada
 and Argentina for the import of
 about seven million tons of
 wheat, worth approximately $500
 million,  by substantial with-
 drawals from its gold reserve.
 The USSR already has re-
 entered the gold market where
 it has not been active since
 mid-1964.   This is its longest
 absence from the market since
 it began to sell gold regularly
 ten years ago to finance trade
 deficits.   The prolonged absence
 reflects an effort to conserve
 gold reserves.   The initial gold
 sale last week   totaled  $35 mil-
 lion and the USSR is continuing
 its activity in the market.
 The Soviet gold reserve had
 dropped to an estimated $1.5
 billion by the beginning of 1965
 as a result of the heavy with-
 drawals to pay for extraordinary
 wheat purchases in 1963 and 1964
 During those years Soviet gold
 sales, which had previously
 averaged about $200 million per
 year, soared to over $500 mil-
 lion annually.
 Gold sales this year will
 reduce the impact of the current
 wheat purchases on other Soviet
 buying programs in the free
 world.   The wheat imports will
 probably cause the USSR to con-
 centrate on expanding exports
 to hard currency markets,  and
 to continue to be highly selec-
 tive in its imports of Western
 equipment and materials.
 Purchases of chemical plants,
 intended largely to meet the
 longer range goals of increasing
 the availability of consumer
 goods,  have just been stepped
 up.    This trend probably will
 be less affected than procure-
 ment of other plants and equip-
 ment.                                                                         The recently proposed
 acquisition of a major automobile
 production line from Western
 Europe, for example,  presumably
 will be deferred for some time.
 This is the third consecu-
 tive year that the USSR--once a
 net exporter of wheat--has bought
 sizable   quantities.   The dis-
 astrous agricultural failure in
 1963 led to imports in excess of
 11 million tons.   Purchases
 following the 1964 harvest
 dropped to 3.5 million tons,
 more than a quarter of which
 was diverted to Cuba and Eastern
 Europe.   Although a substantial
 quantity  of  the latter purchases
 have not yet been delivered,  So-
 viet concern over the poor 1965
 spring wheat crop led to the
 current purchases,  even though
 final outcome of the harvest is
 still not known.   Imports now
 have been scheduled through July
 1966.

 There is still considerable
 uncertainty over the future re-
 lationships of the various par-
 ties affected by Singapore's
 secession, and Malaysia's in-
 ternal stresses have been in-
 creased.
 So far, Singapore has done
 nothing to justify Tunku Abdul
 Rahman's acrimonious admonitions
 against the establishment of
 diplomatic and trade ties with
 Indonesia.   The Singapore Gov-
 ernment has announced that it
 will make no effort along these
 lines until Djakarta recognizes
 Singapore as a sovereign state.
 Furthermore,  the Lee government
 has made it clear that Indonesia
 must accept the fact that Singa-
 pore has the sovereign right to
 maintain the military bases and
 installations of a friendly power
 for defensive purposes.   There-
 fore,  Singapore has no intention
 of requesting the removal of UK
 bases within the foreseeable
 future, although a new defense
 agreement with the UK will have
 to be negotiated.
 The expressions of economic
 independence which followed the
 secession appeared to threaten
 a trade war between Malaysia and
 Singapore,  but both sides have
 now assumed moderate positions.
 Upon secession, Singapore clamped
 quota restrictions on 185 Malay-
 sian items, and goods began to
 pile up along the causeway con-
 necting Malaya and Singapore.
 Kuala Lumpur launched a
 campaign to "buy Malaysia," even
 if Malaysian goods cost as much
 as 10 percent more than foreign
 imports.   The "buy Malaysia"
 theme eventually became less
 audible when Singapore's minister
 of finance, Lim Kim San, stated
 that trade relations with Malay-
 sia were much more important to
 the survival of Singapore than
 a resumption of trade with In-
 donesia.   Lim has promised that
 the Singapore Government will
 remove the quota restrictions
 on Malaysian goods within the
 next few days.

 Chief Minister Stephen
 Kalong Ningkan of Sarawak and

 have offered emphatic pledges to
 continue in the Malaysian Feder-
 ation.   Despite these assurances,
 however,  separatist sentiments
 are pronounced in both states,
 partly because the people of
 Borneo have never closely iden-

 ment derives from Kuala Lumpur's
 condescending attitude toward

 them about Singapore's withdrawal
 from the federation.   Whether
 these factors will offset the

 Premier Souvanna appears
 hopeful about prospects for gov-
 ernment stability in the wake
 of the recent National Assembly
 elections.   In recent discus-
 sions with Assembly leaders,
 Souvanna has won support for a
 continuation of his coalition
 government,  including the reser-
 vation of cabinet seats for the
 Pathet Lao.  However,  he may
 have to make concessions to the
 Assembly by reshuffling some of
 the other portfolios.
 The Pathet Lao seem dis-
 posed to avoid a major confronta-
 tion over the new government.
 Despite these hopeful signs,
 however,  factional rivalries run
 deep and will continue to pose
 a threat to the viability of
 Souvanna's government.   In recent
 weeks,  there have been reports of
 growing friction between the
 strongly rightist military ele-
 ments in the capital and some
 second-echelon neutralist leaders
 who deplore Souvanna's growing
 rapprochement with the conserva-
 tive faction.
 The military situation has
 remained generally quiet through
 the summer monsoon season, but
 small actions continue in widely
 separated parts of the kingdom.
 Rightist regular and guerrilla
 forces are continuing their lim-
 ited offensive against Communist
 positions on Route. 6 between Ban
 Ban and.Samneua.    Government
 forces there are receiving ef-

 SIHANOUK TO BEGIN EXTENDED TOUR NEXT MONTH
 Prince Sihanouk intends
 to start an extended trip to
 several Communist and "friend-
 ly" capitals next month,  but he
 apparently is not planning any
 new diplomatic initiatives.
 He has not addressed himself
 to the recognition problem,
 and his plans do not call for
 a stopover in Hanoi,  although
 he is visiting almost all of
 the Communist capitals.
 Sihanouk has made it clear
 in public statements that his
 primary aim is to get additional
 economic and military aid.   An
 advance Cambodian team,  led by
 economic troubleshooter Son
 Sann,  returned from Peiping
 this week claiming promises of
 increased Chinese economic
 assistance, including the con-
 struction of a 200-bed hospital.
 Sihanouk says that similar prom-
 ises will be forthcoming from
 other countries on his itinerary,
 including the USSR, North Korea,
 and France.
 Before previous visits to
 Peiping,  Sihanouk warned that
 he would conclude new military
 or political agreements with
 Cambodia's Chinese "brothers"
 and that negotiations would be
 opened with the North Vietnamese
 and the Viet Cong's National
 Liberation Front, leading to
 diplomatic recognition.   This
 time,  however,  he has been un-
 commonly reticent regarding po-
 litical aspects of the trip.
 For the past several months,
 Sihanouk has refrained from
 making any major political
 moves.   His avenues of diplo-
 matic maneuver--a game in which
 Sihanouk fancies himself with-
 out peer--have been severely
 circumscribed by the break in
 relations with the US and by
 Peiping's and Hanoi's refusal
 to back an international con-
 ference on Cambodia or South
 Vietnam.
 Sihanouk probably has also
 calculated that Cambodia's accom-
 modation with the Communists
 has gone about as far as it
 can without significantly in-
 creasing the danger of South
 Vietnamese and US retaliation.
 The specter of a punitive South
 Vietnamese expedition into
 Cambodia continues to haunt
 Sihanouk.  This fear is reflected
 in his extreme sensitivity to
 recent remarks by US and South
 Vietnamese officials regarding
 the problem of Viet Cong sanctu-
 ary.

 Indian forces continue to
 engage Pakistani-trained infil-
 trators in Kashmir after two
 weeks of sporadic fighting.
 Clashes along the Cease-
 fire Line near Kargil have re-
 sulted in Indian reoccupation
 of several key posts on the
 Pakistani side of the line.
 These posts command India's
 sole road link between Srina-
 gar and Indian forces deployed
 against the Chinese in Ladakh
 and were occupied briefly by
 the Indians during the Rann of
 Kutch crisis in May and June.
 Pakistan continues to deny
 its complicity in the raids.
 The Indians,  however,  have re-
 leased statements allegedly
 obtained from prisoners de-
 scribingtheir training program
 at Murree in Pakistan.   The
 Indians claim that some 2,800
 men, many of them drawn from
 Azad (Free) Kashmir units at-
 tached to the regular army,
 were trained under the direc-
 tion of Pakistan's 12th Divi-
 sion commander.
 The apparent success of In-
 dian forces in meeting the threat
 posed by the infiltrators, together
 with the guerrillas'  inability to
 arouse significant support from
 the Kashmiri populace, may have
 reduced political pressures on
 Shastri to retaliate.   Demands
 for such countermeasures among
 parliamentarians assembling in
 New Delhi for the current parlia-
 mentary session were much less
 intense than at the height of
 the April-June Kutch crisis. How-
 ever, continued harassments by
 Pakistani-supported forces could
 raise the tempo of demands in
 New Delhi for reprisal.
 Thus far, India's political
 reaction has been limited to can-
 celing the Indian-Pakistani for-
 eign ministers' meeting scheduled
 for today in New Delhi as part of
 the Rann of Kutch agreement.   How-

 another provision of the agree-

 King Constantine has given
 former interior minister Elias
 Tsirimokos the mandate to form
 a new government in his latest
 attempt to solve the month-old
 government crisis.
 The King is determined to
 find a government not under the
 control of former premier Papan-
 dreou.                 The choice of Tsirimokos,
 who has had ties with left-wing
 and Communist-front organizations,
 illustrates how far the King is
 willing to go.
 Tsirimokos'  chances of ob-
 taining a vote of confidence are
 uncertain.   However,    the mandate
 was probably given with the hope
 that additional support in Par-
 liament will be picked up before
 a vote of confidence takes place.
 Tsirimokos has announced that he
 will appear in Parliament early
 next week to ask approval for
 his program.   He will need 151
 votes to win a vote of confi-
 dence if all 300 deputies are
 present.
 Papandreou has condemned
 the choice of Tsirimokos and
 has forecast his failure to ob-
 tain parliamentary approval.
 During a speechmaking tour of
 the country scheduled to begin
 this week end, Papandreou will
 continue to demand that the

 to him or call new elections.

 Tsirimokos in declaring himself

 The Algerian Government is
 making a massive effort to line
 up support for the rescheduled
 Second Afro-Asian Conference on
 5 November.   About 20 countries
 have indicated a willingness to
 attend,  but not much enthusiasm
 is apparent, and Algiers fears
 the meeting may be scuttled
 again.
 Foreign Minister Abdelaziz
 Bouteflika has been the prime
 mover behind the conference
 since the ouster of Ben Bella.
 He is concerned that Ghanaian
 President Nkrumah's request that
 a scheduled African summit meet-
 ing be moved from September to
 21 October is an attempt to
 undermine if not take over the
 larger conference.   Bouteflika
 has personally visited Mali,
 Ghana, and Guinea--countries
 which received the Ben Bella
 overthrow with reserve--with
 apparently little success either
 in lining up firm support for
 his conference or in persuading
 Nkrumah to put off the African
 meeting until December.
 Two or three other high-
 level Algerian delegations are
 touring Africa, and another will
 swing through the Middle East
 later this month.   Minister of
 State Rabah Bitat--who repre-
 sented Algeria at Indonesia's
 17 August independence celebra -
 tions--will presumably discuss
 conference plans when he tours
 Communist China and Pakistan.
 Indonesia,  China, and Pak-
 istan have also pressed hard for
 the new conference.   The Indo-
 nesians apparently regard the
 proposed meeting as a spring-
 board to the Conference of New
 Emerging Forces  (CONEFO) sched-
 uled for Djakarta in mid-1966.
 Sukarno probably still favors
 Algiers as the Afro-Asian con-
 ference site.   During a recent
 African tour his foreign minis-
 ter probably probed for reactions
 to a change of locale,  but pre-
 sumably concluded there was no
 consensus in favor of a shift.
 The reverse Peiping suf-
 fered in the original postpone-
 ment of the conference was prob-
 ably less severe than the Indians
 and a number of Western observers
 initially believed.   Peiping's
 subsequent actions indicate that
 the Chinese still hope to ac-
 complish in November what they
 were unable to do in June:   that
 is, to use the conference as a
 forum for strengthening their
 claims to leadership of the  "emerg-

 resolution denouncing US policies

 UK AVIATION INDUSTRY FACES MAJOR DECISION
 The question of the future
 orientation of the British air-
 craft industry lies at the root
 of the difficult decision now
 facing the British Government
 whether to purchase French Mi-
 rage IV aircraft, rather than
 the US F-111.   Although govern-
 ment and aviation circles gen-
 erally agree that Britain can-
 not maintain an independent
 aircraft industry, there is no
 consensus on whether it should
 turn to the US or to Europe for
 cooperative projects.   Strong
 pressures on both sides are
 being brought to bear on the
 government.
 The Ministry of Defense
 and the services urge purchase
 of US planes such as the F-111,
 to replace the canceled  Brit-
 ish TSR-2.   They point out that
 this would give the services
 the best available performance
 characteristics in the quickest
 time and that it might be pos-
 sible, in turn, to sell the US
 specialized aircraft components
 such as electronic equipment,
 ejector seats, and some types
 of engines.
 The aircraft industry, on
 the other hand, feels it has a
 better chance of survival by
 cooperating with European firms.
 Industry spokesmen contrast the
 failure to obtain production-
 sharing and cooperative sales
 agreement on US-UK - developed
 projects with the more equitable
 arrangements made with France
 for such projects as the Con-
 corde supersonic transport and
 other supersonic aircraft.   The
 industry is supported by the
 Ministry of Aviation
 This view also is
 reinforced by those who,  for
 political reasons,  want British
 ties with Europe strengthened.
 France apparently is try-
 ing to present Britain with an
 either/or choice between Europe
 and the US.   When Britain de-
 cided last February to buy US
 Phantom and Hercules aircraft,
 the French press speculated
 that there was little left for
 Anglo-French programs after
 Britain had committed the major
 share of its aircraft expendi-
 ture through 1975 on US planes.
 The decision between the
 Mirage IV bomber and the F-11
 fighter-bomber is being repre-
 sented by France as the "test
 case" of British sincerity in
 wanting Anglo-French coopera-
 tion.  The Mirage IV's cheaper
 price, and its compatibility
 with the Rolls Royce Spey en-
 gine produced by the British
 Aircraft Corporation, add to
 the attraction of the French

 Public opinion polls continue
 to indicate a very close race in
 the West German national elections
 on 19 September.
 The Social Democratic Party
 (SPD) seems to have its best chance
 of victory since 1949, but there is
 still a relatively large number of
 undecided voters, many of whom pre-
 sumably will opt for the Christian
 Democratic Union (CDU) as the sym-
 bol of 16 years of prosperity and
 social progress.
 The three major parties are
 conducting their campaigns for the
 496 Bundestag seats in accordance
 with a "fairness agreement" which
 restricts the tactics to be em-
 ployed and limits campaign expend-
 itures to about $4 million per
 party.
 The estimated 38.5 million
 eligible voters will use a double
 ballot--one vote for a specific
 candidate and one for a party list.
 Each of the 248 electoral districts
 will send a directly elected rep-
 resentative to the Bundestag;  the
 other 248 seats will be filled from
 party lists according to a propor-
 tional allocation system.
 Most informed observers still
 expect the CDU to win, but by a
 narrower plurality than in 1961.
 This would throw open the question
 of renewing the CDU's coalition
 with the small Free Democratic
 Party and generate increased pres-
 sure for a "grand coalition" with
 the SPD--a move already rejected
 by Chancellor Erhard but viewed
 with considerable favor by some
 other CDU leaders.
 In view of the large measure
 of agreement between the CDU and
 SPD on foreign policy,  the stress
 thus far has been on domestic is-
 sues.   Even here,  the SPD is hard
 pressed to avoid a "me-too" stance.
 Having worked hard to establish
 the image of a moderate reformist
 party purged of Marxist dogma and
 pledged to preserve the basic
 structure of the economic system,
 it is anxious to avoid alienating
 uncommitted voters by proposing
 radical programs.   The issues
 available--the need to "modernize,"
 to expand education and scientific
 research, and to reform the tax
 structure--are hardly likely to
 capture the imagination of the
 voters.
 Faced with this handicap,
 Brandt and the SPD are turning to
 foreign policy matters,  particu-
 larly those directly affecting       25X1
 Germany.   The leadership has prom-
 ised                                                                    the       electorate that a govern-
 ment controlled by the SPD would
 provide movement toward reunifica-
 tion and, in addition, pursue a
 more "confident" German policy by
 not blindly following the lead of
 Washington or Paris on all ques-
 tions.
 Despite recent developments,
 Continental bankers and financial
 officials remain cautious about
 any changes in the international
 monetary system.   They see little
 immediate threat of a critical lack
 of world liquidity.   They suspect
 that an international monetary

 conference would be "technically
 unwieldy" and  that its first
 concern might be to find addi-
 tional support for sterling.
 Furthermore,  they fear to entrust
 changes in the system to a forum
 in which their conservative views
 might not predominate.
 These attitudes have pre-
 vailed in the European reactions
 to Secretary Fowler's statement
 last month that the US is willing
 to participate in an interna-
 tional monetary conference.   Ini-
 tial comments of European offi-
 cials indicated "surprise" over
 the lack of prior consultation
 with the advanced industrial coun-
 tries which constitute the Group
 of Ten.
 The principal concern of EEC
 officials attending a Monetary
 Committee meeting prior to a 3-4
 August session of the Group of Ten
 was to ensure a paramount role for
 the Group in any preparatory con-
 ference on new international ar-
 rangements.   The officials sug-
 gested that the interests of
 "third countries"--primarily less-
 developed countries--be repre-
 sented by the IMF.
 Page 22
 The French,  despite their
 earlier expressions of interest
 in new monetary arrangements,
 have been notably cautious on
 the new US position.   They never-
 theless have followed closely--
 in absentia--the last two EEC
 Monetary Committee meetings
 and have consulted individually
 with their EEC partners on the
 issues before the Group of Ten.
 Expectation of a possible
 sterling crisis this fall persists
 despite Prime Minister Wilson's
 determination to maintain the ex-
 change rate,                                                                          the recently an-
 nounced improvement in British
 trade figures, and the rumors
 of promised US support for the
 pound.   The question of continen-
 tal solidarity in the face of
 such a situation will probably
 be a test of European attitudes
 toward participation in inter-
 national reform moves in general.
 In late July,  French Foreign
 Minister Couve de Murville admitted
 that,  of the "two crises" in Europe,
 France was most concerned with the
 sterlin  situation.

 NEGOTIATIONS FOR DOMINICAN SETTLEMENT CONTINUE
 Negotiations to end the
 Dominican impasse are continu-
 ing as the OAS attempts to
 satisfy rebel objections without
 sacrificing the principles of
 its proposals.   Prolonged dis-
 cussions were conducted to ease
 fears among the rebels that dis-
 mantling of their zone would re-
 sult in an "invasion" by the
 Inter-American Peace Force.  A
 detailed memorandum will prob-
 ably have to be worked out
 specifying how the zone would
 be abolished and rebel militants
 disarmed.
 The rebels have agreed
 "in principle" to leave the
 makeup of the military to the
 provisional president, who
 will most likely be Hector
 Garcia Godoy.   They are trying,
 however, to get prior agreement
 from Garcia Godoy to let all
 rebel military personnel rejoin
 the armed forces and to remove
 the present high command.   An-
 other issue that appears far
 from settled is the length of
 time the IAPF will remain in
 the country.
 Discussions paused in mid-
 week after the rebels charged
 the OAS with imposing a solu-
 tion and asked the UN to enter
 the negotiations. The OAS Com-
 mittee called off a meeting
 with the rebels, saying it could
 not negotiate when faced with
 these tactics.   The rebel UN
 representative withdrew his re-
 quest for a Security Council
 meeting, which had been supported
 by the Soviets, possibly because
 of the OAS reaction.
 There has been no indica-
 tion that Imbert will sign the
 Act of Reconciliation if it is
 substantially changed to con-
 ciliate the rebels.  One member
 of Imbert's Government of Na-
 tional Reconstruction  (GNR)
 reiterated that the regime will
 sign the act only if it is not
 changed.
 GNR military leaders ex-
 pressed concern over delay in
 reaching a settlement because it
 gives extremists among the
 rebels time to consolidate
 their positions.   The army
 chief even proposed that Garcia
 Godoy take office without rebel
 agreement, a step he has been
 reluctant to take without at
 least some support among rela-
 tive moderates in the rebel
 camp.   The OAS has reassured
 the military leaders that Garcia.
 Godoy   recognizes the Communist
 problem and has plans to handle
 it.

 cause all rebel demands might
 not be met through negotiations,
 a "united democratic front"
 should be organized to continue
 the political struggle for the
 revolution's fundamental objec-
 tives.   Caamano's appeal was
 consistent with the Dominican
 Communist Party (PCD) line.
 The PCD continues to at-
 tempt to unify all Dominican
 Communists into one party, an
 effort that may in part be
 motivated by concern over the
 growing influence of other ex-
 tremist groups.   Little has been
 accomplished in a series  of in-
 formal meetings with the Peiping-
 oriented Dominican Popular Move-
 ment and the pro-Castro 14th of
 June Group, however, and the
 PCD's recent advocacy of a pol-
 icy of armed insurrection may
 be a further attempt to a  ep~al
 to the other two groups. i
 Government forces, react-
 ing to the 9 August attacks by
 the Castroite Movement of the
 Revolutionary Left (MIR)  in
 Junin Department, are conduct-
 ing vigorous counterinsurgency
 operations there.   The Peru-
 vian Air Force has carried out
 at least eighteen bombing sor-
 ties against the guerrillas,
 using locally made napalm.   The
 napalm exploded properly, but
 results of the air attacks are
 unknown.
 Army rangers are making a
 sweep to the southwest from the
 village of Kubantia, scene of
 last week's fighting, in an at-
 tempt to locate the guerrillas.
 Other troops are working north-
 ward toward the rangers' area
 of operations.
 No large-scale
 clashes between government
 forces and guerrillas have oc-
 curred this week.
 No further incidents have
 been reported from southern
 Peru.  The government had feared
 that destruction of a bridge in
 Cuzco Department on 31 July
 marked the beginning of a nex-
 MIR front.

 Guatemalan security forces
 have dealt severe blows to the
 Communist Party  (PGT) apparatus
 in the capital.   A raid on the
 PGT leadership school on 15 July
 uncovered lists of names and the
 addresses of other party sites.
 In a series of follow-up raids,
 authorities confiscated large
 quantities of propaganda,  print-
 ing equipment, a pickup truck,
 and caches of arms and ammuni-
 tion.   Two terrorists were
 killed,  and a number of party
 members were arrested,  includ-
 ing central committeeman and
 candidate for secretary general,
 Alfredo Guerra Borges.
 The party expects to
 replace lost equipment and to
 be functioning normally in
 about a month.
 Meanwhile,  the PGT has not
 been able to follow through on
 plans to sabotage US official
 and commercial installations and
 to attack Guatemalan Government
 officials.
 August in the hold of a ship
 anchored at Puerto Barrios and
 loaded with cargo from New
 Orleans may have resulted from
 PGT sabotage.
 In the past, when the
 government has scored major
 successes against party terror-
 ists, the PGT has been fairly
 quick to order violence against
 police agents or high govern-
 ment officials.   Despite the
 damage done to the PGT this
 time, Communists may be ex-
 pected to strike back, en-
 couraged by increasing public
 expression of dissatisfaction
 with the incumbent regime.

 The arrival of the US Canal
 Study Commission on 19 August
 is likely to add new fuel to
 Panamanian impatience with the
 status of the present canal.
 Former negotiator Jorge
 Illueca.,  an ambitious, clever
 ultranationalist, had already
 taken the position that the com-
 mission should not be allowed
 to conduct studies for a sea-
 level canal in the country as
 long as "Panamanian demands"
 have not been met and the 1903
 Hay-Buneau VarillaTreaty has
 not been "definitely canceled."
 During an hour-long radio
 interview on 12 August,  Illueca
 charged that the Robles regime
 has no clearly defined position
 on a sea-level canal and reit-
 erated an earlier charge that
 the government's views do not
 reflect Panamanian consensus.
 He alleged that the negotia-
 tions lack popular support be-
 cause no one knows what is being
 done.   Illueca pointed out that
 the country's largest political
 party, Arnulfo Arias' Panamenista
 Party  (PP), is not represented
 on the negotiating team.
 In recent private conversa-
 tions with US officials, several
 Panamanian leaders have exhibited
 anxiety over public demands that
 the Robles government provide
 tangible evidence of progress
 in the negotiations. Last month
 former foreign minister Galileo
 Solis stated that although he
 was confident Washington would
 deal fairly with Panama,  the
 US probably could not agree to
 changes as sweeping as many
 Panamanians expected.   Solis
 feels it is essential that Presi-
 dent Robles undertake a careful
 public relations campaign to
 prepare the people and the Na-
 tional Assembly to accept a
 "realistic" agreement.
 Government spokesmen have
 said only that they are engaged
 in complex and delicate negotia-
 tions which cannot be conducted
 in public.   They do admit that
 progress is slow but aver that
 this is in the best interests
 of Panama.   Foreign Minister
 Eleta is said to be planning a
 series of background briefings
 on the negotiations for Panamanian
 news representatives.   His degree
 of success in evincing evidence
 of progress will be important
 for Robles in the coming weeks.
 When the National Assembly
 reconvenes in October, the gov-
 ernment will face increasing
 pressure to demonstrate that
 it has been able to wrest con-
 cessions from the US.   Failure
 to do so could provide Communists
 and extreme nationalists with a.
 ready-made issue to discredit
