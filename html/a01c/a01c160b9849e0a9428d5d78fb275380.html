PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA htivF carried signed articles by their own

the inckson amendment, wan changing his mind about 'inking most-favored-

policy. IZVESTIYA concluded on the 25th that the delegntionsm discus-
sions showed that 'n dialog is both possible and effective" even with 
"skeptics" of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. 
Ponomprev, bent known recently for his remarks in January about 
"the general crislA of capitalism," during the current visit has 
voiced strong support For improved U.S.-Soviet relntions in general 
and for further steps at %%LT in particular. in doing no he has 
echoed some of the traditional themes of arms control arivocates 
such. as USA institute director Ceorgly Arbatov. PRAVDA on 25 May 
carried n TASS account of Ponomarev's remarks at n press conference 
which included his observation about the need for military in well 
as political detente, since "detente and the arms race cannot 
proceed simultaneously indefinitely." That argument was also 
presented recently by Arbatov in an article in the May issue of 
USA which went on to warn that if new agreements at SALT do not 
Follow moon the arms race may teatime in full force. PRAVDA 
did not carry Ponomarev's further observation, an reported by 
TASS on the 24th, that success at SAtT would enable both sides 
"to substnntinily reduce defense expendttui-es and rechannel these 
resources toward peaceful constructive tasks."

Peking's desire t(0 sostain close political and trade ties with 
the West was emphasized on 74PVPTII 01-1n/Onn in the pint wopk, 
In a series of high-level Chinese leadership contn.7ts with 
Western visitors that were given extensive coverage and prominent

French indnatrlal Pxhibition In Peking, in:Iuding NCNA reports 
Ott separate receptions marking the event gfven by the French 
embassy, the PRC Foreign Trade Ministry, and the Chinn Council 
For the Promotion of international Trade. Chou rn-lal on 21 May 
departed from normal protocol practice to meet and hnve 
"friendly" conversation with the l'rench Nat tonal Assembly delegate 
charged with opening the exhibit, while Vice Premier Teng 
1-Wan-ping met the delegate on the 24th. 
Mao Tse-tung on 30 May had a "very cordial conversAtion" with 
visiting Chinese-American physicist LI Cheng--tan. Li on 24 May 
had a "most cordial talk" with a widely representative group of 
Chine4e leaders headed by Chou En-lit, Wang Hung-en, Chang Chun-chlao, 
Chiang Ching, 'fan Wen-plan and Teng llglao-pfng. That occasion 
marked the firer high-levet ChIneae leadera' meeting with Chinese-

leaders hid had a "cordial" conversation with LI when he visited 
China In October 1972. 
Peking's desire to maintain close relations with Western leaders 
opposed to the Sovlet Union was clearly evidenced by the extraordinary 
welcome it accorded Former British Prime Minister Heath during his 
24-28 May visit to Peking. Departing from normal protocol require-
ments, Heath was accorded honors reserved for visiting allies or 
heads of government, Including rousing airport welcome and departure 
ceremonies and a meeting with Mao on 25 May. Chou En-hi was 
present at Heath's visit with Mao and held separate talks with him 
on 27 May. Chiang Ching accompanied the former prime minister to 
a Peking concert on 26 May. 
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, Heath's host in Peking, spoke 
positively of West European unity during a 25 May welcoming banquet 
address for the British guest. Teng Asserted that West European 
unity has made progress in impeding Soviet "hegemonistic schemes"

AID AGREEMENT' COMMUNIQUE CAP KH1EU SAMPHAN VISIT TO CHINA 
The Cambodian Front delegation led by insurgent armed forcen 
chief Khieu Samphan climaxed tts extended tour of eleven 
countries over the pant two monthe with a 20-27 May vintt in 
Peking that was marked by the signing of a military aid agree-
ment for 1974 and the relense of a joint communique on the 
delegation's stays in Chins during April and May.* The 
Cambodian visitors atteneed a dance performance with a Chinese 
delegation led by Mao's wife and three other politburo members 
on 23 May and held talks the following day with Vice Premier 
Li Hsien-nieu, who subatituted for Chou En-lai, the group's 
chief host during itn April stay in Peking. LI spoke at the 
reciprocal banquet given by the delegation on the 2601, signed 
the aid agreement 'Along with Khieu Samphan on that day, and 
saw off the Cambodians at the airport, in the company of Vice 
Chairman Yeh Chin-ying and two dther Chinese politburo members. 
Chou En-lid's oily appearance with the Cambodian delegation 
curing this leg of its trip was at the aid agreement signing 
ceremony. 
The delegation stopped off on the 27th in Hanoi, where it was 
greeted at the airport by a high-level group led by Pham Van 
Dong and Vo Nguyen Giap, and was later received by Le Duan. The 
visitors were feted at a dinner on 29 May hosted by Pham Van 
Dong, who took the opportunity to denounce continued U.S. in-
volvement in Inl:..oina and the presence of U.S. forces in Thailand. 
A 28 May DRV Foreign Ministry communique marking the stopover 
disclosed that the DRV had accepted a Cambodian invitation to 
send a delegation to visit Cambodia at an "appropriate date." 
SIHANOUK'S POSITION Against the background of Khieu Samphan's 
emergence during the two-month foreign 
tour as a prominent Front international spokesman with authority 
rivaling that of "head of state" Prince Sihanouk, Peking and Front 
media continue to sustain an image of Front unity under Sihanouk's 
titular leadership role. As he had during the delegation's stay

30 MAY 1974 
in Peking last month, Sihanouk attended major ceremonial functions 
for the Front visitors, including the 23 May dance performance, 
the aid agreement signing and reciprocal banquet on the 26th, ant 
the airport r/eperture cerem,nies on the 27th. In their speeches 
at the reciptocal banquet both Khieu Samphan and Li Hsien-nien 
were careful to note that the conclave was being held "under the 
auspices" of "head of state" Sihancuk. Li also went out of his 
way to recall that Sihanouk and RGNU Prime Minister Penn Nouth 
had been present during the delegation's 2 April meeting with Mao. 
AID AGREEMENT The 26 May signing of rlie agreement on China's 
"eratis provision r: military equipment and 
suppliee tociabodia for 1974" prompted a Ligh-level turnout, 
including Chou Ea-lai and Yeh Chien-ying on the Chinese side and 
Sihanouk, Penn Nouth, and Khieu Samphan for the Front. By contrast, 
Penn Routh and Ll Hsien-nien had been the higheut o'ficials 
present for the 13 January 1973 signing of tivd last aid sgreement. 
I. February 1972 Chou En-lai and Yeh Chien-ying had led Chinese 
officials at that year's agreement signing, which was witnessed 
by Sihanouk. As in past years, NCNA did not report any revarks 
by either side during the ceremony. There was no mention this 
year of "economic aid," which had been covered in agreements for 
1973 and 1972. 
PRC-FRONT RELATIONS The joint communique noted that both sides 
expreeded "full satisfaction" with the 
"complictte enccess" of the delegation's China visit but failed to 
record a "complete unity of views" as had been marked in the 2 April 
DRV-RGNU statement on the delegation's 28 March- 1 April 1974 visit 
to Hanoi.* In the communique, and in Li's speech at the 26 May 
banquet, Peking conveyed a more restratned tone than had Chineue 
speeches at the start of the Front delegation's PRC tour early 
last month. Those speeches had revived themes from Mao's 20 May 
1970 statement on Cambodia in an effort to underscore Peking's 
proletatian internationalist credentials and its commitment to the 
struggles of the Cambodian and other oppressed peoples. The Chinese 
did laud Khieu Samphan's foreign tour, reaffirm support for the 
five pofnts and backing for the RGNU as the "sole legal government 
of the Cambodian people," and criticize the Lon Nol regime. Peking 
also routinely demanded that the United States end its interference 
in Cambodia and allow the Cambodians to settlL their own affairs 
without outside interference.

the Front concerning the need for "protracted people's war" to

formulationa that had nifirms0 China's "powerful barking" and that 
Peking would provide "a reliable rear area" for the Cambodian 
struggle--formulations pointedly recalled by Front npenkere and 
in the Front section of ths communique. Peking demonstrated Its 
influence with the i:ambodion on the quentlon of the Soviet Union, 
gaining Front endorsement in the communique ryf China's ntandard

PRG BREAKS OFF PARTICIPATION IN FOUR-PARTY JMC TALKS 
The PRG announced In a 30 May statement by its military delegation 
in Sragon that it was suspending its participation in the four-part 
Joint Military Commission (JMC) meetings, charging the United Stgion 
and Saigon with raising "illogical conditions for restoring the 
prerogatives and immunities" allegedly being denied the communist 
delegation and failing to adopt a "serious attitude in negotiations. 
The latest PRG walkout from the negotiating table follows its 
10 May refusal to continue its attendance at the two-party SMC 
talks and its 13 May announcement that the consultative meetings 
between the two South Vietnamese parties at La Celle-Saint-Cloud 
were indefinitely suspended--thus completely severing all formal

two such explicit references by Mario Soares, head of the Portugueme 
Socialist: Party and now the country's foreign minister. In both 
reference's Soares warned that economic difficulties nnd leek of 
lefCat unity had perinitt& a rightist countercoup in Chile. Moscow

of broad lessona drawn from the Allende experience, among them:

MOSCOW SEES CONTINUING FAILURES IN U.S, LATIN NIERICAN POLICY 
Moscow has depicted the entabliahment of new U.S. commiasion 
to reexamine Latin American relations an a Rign of the con`inulag 
failure ol U.S. policy in 1nnt region. Although he 28 Mav 
Moscow dcmastic radio commentary doeR not identify the body 
specificilly, it in clearly referring to the 23-member inde-
penriont study commiRslon headed by for-er U.S. OAS ambesaador 
Sot M. Linowitz.* Moscow depicts t'le move an the katest 'at a 
series of U.S. effortm deRtgned to renpond to Latin Ameritan 
demands for a new deal in hemispheric relationships. 
The commentary goes on co underscore what tm described as "a 
considerable wnvsening of relation between the United States 
and many Latin Averican Rtates," stmeming from U.S. efforts 
to strengthen it influence in the region. The observations 
are consistent vith Moscow's roports of acute differences 
between the United States nod its southern neighbors said to 
have been manifeated at the OAS foreign miniRters' conferences 
at Tlaltelolco, Mexico, last February and in Atlanta in April. 
The U.S. position at the conferences had been described by 
Moscow as conciliatory in principle, but 'erne As tV-epatific 
commitments concerning Cuba, the Panama Canal, and private 
investment, among others. 
The commentary suggests that the new commission is likely to 
share the fate of WaRhington's previous efforts to repair 
relations with Latin America. Noting Secretary Kissinger' 
recent efforts to "open a dialog" on U.S.-Latin American 
relations, the commentary observes that these efforts stimur. 
lated a "growing unity" among the Latin American stateu, and 
strengthened their resolve not to submit to the "diktat" of 
the United States. In these circumstances, the commentary 
concludes, Washington is obliged to search "feverishly" for 
new ways and methods and to "reluctantly" agree to a review 
of these relations.

YUGOSLAV 1I\ 
LCY CONGRESS MARKS IMPROVED CPSU TIES, STRESSES NONALINEMENT 
Thil 10th Congress of the League of Communintn o: YugonInvie (ICY) 
on 27-0 May reflected the marked improvement In Belgrade's 
relations with the CPSU and the other pnrtlen of the Warsaw 
Pact countries. This improvemenk was manifested both In Yugoslav 
pronouncements and In speeches by delegates from the orthodox 
Waraaw Pact countries, which had boycotted the Inst ICY congress 
five years earlier. At the come time Tito'e min report an well 
os :emarka by party eutennnte Edvnrd Kardelj and Stone Dolanc 
cisarly served notice that Yilgoslavim will ccotinue to pursue 
its t,icy or nonalinement. On tly.t domestic front, the party 
conv.ean took place against the background if Belgrade's thrre-year 
cempaign to reneert the party's leading role In society and the 
principle of democr.icic centralism within the party. 
RELATIONS WITH CPSU, PACT Parties of *-7ery Pact country were 
represented at the congress, unlike 
the last congress in 1969 when, following Yugoslav criticism of 
intervention in Czechoslovakia, only Romania sent a delegation. 
Alain this year, neither the Chinese Communist Party nor the 
Albanian Workers Party was represented. Doianc, according to the 
26 May Moscow PRAVDA, explained at a precongress news conference 
that neither party had been invited, since party-level relations 
do not exist because according to those parties "the ICY Is not a 
party with which they can maintain contacts," 
Led by the CPSU'e Andrey Kirtlenko, who in a Kragujevac factory speech 
on the 28th labeled Yugoslav-Soviet positions on "key" international 
issues as "either identical at very close,' the Pact delegates and 
party greettAgs messages notes accept/once in varying degrees of 
Yugoslavia's current domestic and foreign policies, while at the 
same time calling for socialist unity and coordination. 
However, the Bulgarian Communize Party awl its delegate Zhivko Zhivkov 
both took the opportunity to obliquely criticize the LCV for its 
repeated concerns over Bulgaria's refusal to identify it Macedsnians 
as a nationality. The Bulgarian CP Central Committee greetings rind 
Zhivkov in a 27 May speech while "siting Montenegro called for 
"respecting the principles of noninterferencz in internal affairs . . . ft

the LCY is now reasnerting control within the country, pointing out 
that the Yugos1av/4 "have made fundamentel changes in the country's 
deRtiny . . . ." 
Tito echoed the CPSU's expressions of satisfaction over the 
development of relations, while noting in his congress report that 
difference/4 "may lead and have led unfortunately to tense relationa 
between individual socialist countries." Tito eschewed charges 
of Stalinism voiced at the Ninth Congress but reiterated the 
position that relations among socialist countries must be beeed 
on "principles of equality, independence, mutual respect and 
noninterference in internal affairs." Individual communist partie:.:, 
Tito said, "must not make absolute or glorify only their paths and 
the specific traits of their development and must not impose their 
systems on others." And in a remark that could apply to the 
PRC, Tito noted that differences among parties are ittettablc, and 
he proposed not only "dialog" but also "mutu&I cc,:atr?ctive criticism" 
among communist parties. 
COMMITMENT TO NONALINEMENT Tito's expressions of satisfaction with 
the improvement of relations with the

conference, Dolanc also reasserted Yugonlavia's nonalined 
policy. Denying rumors that Yugoslavia wan "joining the socialist 
camp," Dolenc, according to TANJUG on the 24th, said: "We are not 
going anywhere; we are stayinG right where we are--a socialist 
country, but a country for whose foreign policy nonalinement is 
the foundation." Party theoretician Kardelj elaborated on 
Yugoslavia's nonalined policy in a 27 May speech on the 
compatibility of nonalinement and socialism. Nonalinement, he 
said, is "directed against al i forms of political and economic 
oppreosion," but he also emphasized that its "fundamental essence" 
is "snti-imperlalist." 
Kardelj, an well as Tito, called for restrictions on the 
activities of multinational companies. Although neither Tito nor 
Kardelj referred specifically to the United States, TANJUG on the 
28th reported UN delegate Lozar Mojsov telling the congress: 
"Although these companies were multinational ones, by and large, 
one rich powerful country stood behind them--the United States." 
Tito did directly criticize the United States in his remarks 
on Indochina, calling for a "cessation of all interference by the 
United States" in Vietnam and Cambodia. However, he avoided 
criticizing the United States durtng his remarks on the ItfAiian 
border dispute, unlike his 15 April speech in Sarajevo, whtn he 
had attacked the timing of U.S.-NATO maneuvers in the Mediterranean. 
Italy was tne only Yugoslav neighbor directly criticized by Tito, 
although obviously he had in mind the difficulties with StOpiria 
over the Macedonians and with Austria over the Carinthians 143;en, 
in referring to national minorities, he condemned "th denial of 
their national and ethnic affiliation and of their language and 
culture" and also condemned "their assimilation by the nation 
in whose state they are now incluied."

CZECHOS LOVAK I A 
LENART CALLS FOR CONTINUED STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM 
Slovak partyFirst Secretary Jozef Lenart has implicitl; c:Itt(oned 
that the softer line toward "revisionists" among Czechoslovrkials 
scientific and technical intelligentsia--reflected in the 14-15 Mfy 
Czechoslovak party plenum--did not signal any basic shift away 
from the party's orthodox line on the 1968 events.* L-srt, a 
pragmatic moderate of Husak"s stripe, emphasized in 20 May 
Bratislava speech that revisionism "remains the main danger," an 
affirmation reflecting the moderates' concern to avoid leaving 
themselves vulnerable to possible chlrges of ideological compromise 
from hardliners such as Bilak and Indra. 
Lensres speech, delivered at a seminar devoted to the 30th anniversary 
of the Slovak National Uprising, was reported by CTK on the 20th and 
published in the Bratislava PRAVDA on the 21st. Four days after it 
had carried an innocuous recorded excerpt of the speech on the 20th, 
the Prague domestic radio on the 24th pointedly summarized the pass-
ages dealing with the struggle against revisionism, indicating the 
importance of its action by noting at the outset that "today we 
return once again to" Lenart's speech. 
In an unusually outspoken comparison of the Hungarian events of 
1956 and those in Czechoslovakia in 1968, Lenart argued that the 
very fact bloodshed was averted in Czechoslovakia made it more 
difficult to convince the populace that the Warsaw Pact intervention 
was necessary and that a continuing struggle must still be waged 
against revisioniam. Thus, he pointed out, while a victory was 
achieved in overcoming the "counterrevolution" in Czechoslovakia 
by "political" means, rather than the "rigid administrative procedure" 
used in Hungary, this at the same time confronted the Czechoslovak 
communists with "a problem" which he said was still unsolved: 
As our people did not go through the cruel experience 
of the Hungarian people, it is necessary to explain 
Lo the people the logicai developments which would 
have occurred--that in our country, too, everything 
was pointing to a civil war--so that they can under-

stand the great importance of our llies' help. 
From this viewpoint the struggle against the 
revisionist rightist forces remains topical, 
and for this reason revisionism remains the 
main danger. 
While stressing the need to continue the struggle against re-
visioniem, Lenart repeatedly insisted, in standard terms, that 
the post-1968 "consolidation" of the situation in Czechoslovakia 
had been successfully carried out. 
The Prague broadcast of Lenart's remarks wound up with a further 
tribute by the Slovak partyleader to the August 1968 intervention 
and to the "Leninist" leadership of Kusak since April 1969. Lenart 
had been Czechoslovak premier during the No%Itny era and was thus 
out of favor during the 1968 liberalization. Following Rusak's 
takeover Lim Dubcek as Czechoslovak party first secretary, Lenart 
in January 1970 was restored to full membership in the CPCZ 
Presidium and appointed Slovak CP first secretary.

USSR 
CPSU OFFICIAL ATTACKS BREZHNEV, URGES ECONOMIC REFORMS 
In a remarkably transparent attack on Brezhnev's leadership, a 
CPSU Central Committee official has called for thorough exposure 
of mistakes in leadership of the economy and an open, party-wide 
debate on a new economic policy. F. if. Petrenko, whose career 
appears to have gone into eclipse after authoring several anti-
Brezhnev articles on collective leadership in the mid-1960's, 
declared in an article in the April issue of QUESTIONS OF CPSU 
HISTORY, Ligned to press on 2a Match, that only sweeping criticism 
of mistakes along the lines of the repudiation of Stalin's cult 
and Khrushchev'e "subjectivism" can clear the way for adoption 
of effective new policies. 
In 1973 Petrenko reappeared in the central party press with 
several provocative arfAcles, the most notable cf which was 
published in PRAVDA on 19 October. In that article he i.ointedly 
praised the work of Supreme Soviet agencies, trade unions and 
economic managers along the same lines as in his earlier articles, 
conveying by implication his adr.i.:.ation for bu,!eaucracies headed 
by Podgornyy, Shelepin and Kongie, respectively. Petrenko's 
visits to and writings on the bloc countries suggest a relationship 
with KGB chairman Andropov, who until May 1967 was head of the 
bloc relations section of the Central Committee and who has long 
been reputed to he a "modernist" in the Folitteiro. 
In view of Petrenko's unmistakably revisionist outlooL and his 
apparent political affiliations with the opposition to Brezhnev, 
the timing of his most recent articles assumes critical importance. 
The twin appearances of the PRAVDA article less than two weeks after 
the outbreak of the Middle East war and of the second Petrenko 
article at the cloee of Secretary of State Kissinger's 24-28 March 
visit to Moscow suggest that foreign policy considerations were 
paramount in the timing of the apparent moves against Brezhnev. 
QUESTIONS OF CPSU Petrenko's April article, entitled "Freedom 
HISTORY ARTICLE of Discussion and Criticism Is a Fundamental 
Principle of CPSU Life and Activity," declared 
that nothing can remain unchanged forever and placed party cadres on 
notice about the onset cl a period of intense criticism and discussion. 
Stating that various economic traditions and practices and even some

aspects of the political system have become outdated, he argued 
that if moves to criticize and correct these shortcomings were 
not made, there could be "a serious political crisis, as shown, 
for example, by events in Czechoslovakia in 1968-69." Further. 
the wide discussion of "social and intraparty problems" were said 
to be necessary because of the possibility of "subjective" mistakes 
in leadership. While conceding that collective leadership, "on 
which the party relies at all levels," reduces the likelihood of 
errors, he maintained that it "cannot fully exclude them." 
Petrenko virtually called upon Soviet leaders to admit their mistakes, 
recalling pointedly that Lenin "considered honest admission and correction 
of mistakes a sign of political maturity" and that he had maintained 
that if leaders tell the people "even bitter and harsh truth," 
the "masses will understand" and "any difficulties" can be over-
come. Citing Lenin's idea that publicizing "is a sword which 
heals the wounds it causes," Petrenko refuted those who argue 
that it Is too dangerous to reveal mistakes and weaknesses because 
these will be used by enemies, and he also ridiculed the "strange 
logic" of those who argue that a hidden fault "is not really a 
fault at all." 
Progress, according to Petrenko, is ensured by thorough exposure 
and criticism of shortcomings, followed by determinat4-T of a 
correct course through broad discussion. "Every time the communist 
party has faced new complicated tasks," he went on, it has turned 
to criticism of shortcomings and party-wide discussion. The two 
historical examples he cites have striking parallels with the 
present day. In 1925, he recalled, when the party was "summing 
up the results of the new economic policy and deciding questions 
of further paths of economic construction," it ordered that the 
"party masses must be drawn intc L.e most active participation 
in discussion and decision of questions facing the [coming] cougress," 
and in the late 1920's, when the growth of the economy snd culture 
made urgent the task of fighting "bureaucratic distortions in state 
and economic uor," the Central Committee made the theme of criticism 
from below of everyone, irrespective of rank, one of the key slogans 
of the day. 
He argued that even the most radical repudiation of the party's 
past errors would be accepted by the public and would be successful. 
"One of the most striking examples" of the positive value of thormgh 
criticism and exposure of errors, he wrote, was the party's "bold 
and open declaration on errors and distortions committed as a result 
of the cult of Stalin's personality." This received the "full support

of the whole Soviet people," cleared away "serious obstacles on 
the path of development of Soviet society," and strengthened the 
communist movement. He depicted the overthrow of Khrushchev in 
October 1964 in a similar light, alleging it opened the way for 
great improvements in economic management. 
Party decisions, according to Petrenko, must be arrived at collec-
tivoly,by "free discussion of problems of theory and practice on 
all levels" of the party. Virtually ignoring the Politburo, Petrenko 
described the recent party congresses and Central Committee plenums 
as the key decision-making bodies which have thoroughly debated 
economic policies and shortcomings. Discussion of social and 
intraparty problems, he declared, is becoming even more important 
today, and he reported that at all levels of the party the rank-and-
file are now discussing such questions as the CPSU peace program, 
economic plan fulfillment and the "effectiveness and style of party 
leadership." 
PAST ARTICLES Brezhnev's ant athy toward economic reform 
appears to be the target of Petrenko's article, 
especially since Petrenko's antipathy toward Brezhnev is abundantly 
clear from past articles. Every article he has written since 
Brezhnev's rise in 1965 has been permeated wtth themes iehcrently 
inimical to Brezhnev's laterests: collective leadership, reduction 
of party interference in economic affairs, reliance on specialists 
and intellectuals, the urgency of economic reform and the right 
of the Czechoslovaks and other nations to pursue an independent 
course. In particular, his articles in 1966-1967 criticizing first 
secretaries who set themselves above the collective were unmistakable 
swipes at Brezhmw. 
Petrenko's works disappeared in the central party press after :Ile 
Invasion of Czechoslovakia, but they reappeared in 1973 in the form 
of articles urging greater scope for soviet and governmental agencies 
in running the economy and greater reliance by party leaders on 
advice of specialists and intellectuals. Brezhnev responded to this 
viewpoint with a warning at the December CPSU plenum against a 
"technocratic" approach to management of the economy. 
Petrenko's first controversial article after Khrushchev's fall 
appeared in a September 1965 issue of PARTY LIFE, and it was co-
authored by Yu. V. Bernov. In May 1965 Petrenko, identified as 
a "responsible official of a Central Committee section," and Berney, 
head of the Bulgarian-Yugoslav sector of the Central Committee's 
bloc relations section, had accompanied Suslov on a visit to Atagaria.

In the September article they described the role of the Bulgarian 
party in the economy and society. They reported that the Bulgarian 
Central CommP'tee had condemned party leaders for duplicating the 
functicna of economic officials and that "direct interference in 
the operational-economic activity of enterprises and their leaders" 
had thus been reduced. They also descrt5ed how the Bulgarian Central 
Committee and local par z.y committees had increased their reliance 
on specialists by creating "problem commissions" headed by party 
secretar!as and including prominent scientists and specialists. 
The description of Bulgarian affairs was in fact similar to themes 
then prominent in Soviet commentazy on domestic affairs. 
In a December 1965 KOMMUNIST Article keyed to the upcoming party 
report-and-election conferences prior to the 23d CPSU r.ongress, 
Petrenko argued that higher echelons of the party should allow 
lower echelons greater scope in electing their own leaders and 
that election meetings should be marked by free discussion, bold 
criticism and more openness and publicity. He rejected the notion 
that this wou1.1 undermine "the organizing role of a higher party 
committee in relation to lower" committees. 
Petrenko' 41 next article was a transparent response to abortive 
attempts in early 1966 to elevate Brezhnev above the collesial 
organs of authority. At the 23d Ccngress in March-April 1966, 
Gorkiy oblast first secretary Katushev--who had been installed 
in that post by Brezhnev in December 1965?was the only prominent 
official to urge that "henceforth the Central Committee be headed 
by a General Secretary." In a 20 July 1966 PRAVDA article on 
collectivity, Petrenko criticized "some leaders" who "force" 
their opinion on party committees. "A party committee secretary is 
not a chief, he has not been given the right to command," he wrote, 
"he is only the senior in an organ of collective leadership elected 
by communists," and "in deciding questions he has only as many 
rie-Its as other members of the committee." Collectivity "its 
strengthened where respect for authority does not exceed reasonable 
limits . . . ," he added. 
In March 1967 Petrenko authored a QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY article 
on criticism not unlike his most recent QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY 
article. The 1967 article clearly revealed Petrenko's reformist 
credentials. Not only under capitalism but also Ander socialism, 
he wrote, the "assertion of the new is impossiblc without critical 
negation of the old which has ceased to correspolid to 'hanged conditions 
and tasks." But under socialism4he maintained, "this negation is 
aimed not at weakening the existing system :Alt, on the c-Nntrary,

at ,Jtrengthening It." He went on to pain' out tnct the struggle 
between new and out ideas and practices "as n rule" doe? not lead 
to "groat social conflict's" under socialism. And he praised the 
efforts of historlans arA writers to "critically interpret the 
Stalin period as a "necessary tage in the further development: of 
historical science and artistic creation" but cautioned that the past 
must not be depicted only as a "chain of mistakes." 
MILITANT RZFORMIST Petrenko returned to the theme of collectivity 
ahortly after N. G. Yegorychev was ousted as 
Moncow city first secretary for reporteoly criticizing Soviet policy 
In the Hindle East at the June 1967 CPSU pleetm. In a September 1967 
PARTY LIFE article, entitled "Strictly Obverve Leninist Norms nf Party 
Life," Petrenko warned that "creation of truly comradely conditions 
for collective leadership largely depends on the secretary of a party 
committee or bureau," and if that official "misuses his position, 
collectivity can be reduced to nought." Noting that Lenin provided 
an "instructive example" of haw collectivity should operate rt meetings 
of the Central Committee, Politburo, Orgburo and Secretariat, Petrenko 
declared that "one could argue quite freely with Lenin on any 
question . . . ." Shortly afterward Petrenko, identified as a 
"responsible official of the Central Committee," also delivered a 
lecture on "Collectivity?the High Principle of Party Leadership," 
according to the 7 January 1968 MOSIZOVSKAYA PRAVDA. 
In a 17 April 1968 rRAVDA article on the role of the party, Petrenko 
again argued that the party should not engage in "petty supervision" 
of state and economic organs and also voiced indirect support for the 
upsurge of reformism in Prague. Arguing that national peculiariza:s 
often dictate differences in approach by communist parties in different 
nations, Petrenko recalled the "different roads to socialiau" thesis 
made familiar in the Khrushchev era. He insisted that "eaco fraternal 
party is independent in determining its own policy and also the concrete 
forms and melt-hods of activity," and that "the CPSU tre&ts the experience 
of fraternal parties with deep respect and attention." 
But the crisis over Czechoslovekia and the Auglst 1968 invasion clearly 
placed Petrenko and other reformers on the defensive. In an October 
1968 PARTY LIFE article on democratic centralism, he blamed the "Czech 
events" on the abandonment of the principle of democratic centralism 
in the name of party democracy--specifically, the failure to prevent 
overt factionalism and uphold Party discipline. However, the Czech 
failures, he contended, do not discredit reformism, since the events 
in that nation "have nothing in common with genuine concern for develop-
ment of party democracy . . . ."

No subsequent articles by Petrenko appeared in the major party 
publications until 1973, though a book review appeared in the 
journal for the party rank-and-file. POLITICAL SELF-EDUCATION, 
in April 1971. The book review was used by Petrenko as a vehicle 
i:Jr propounding the view that state and economic agencies should 
be independent of party interference. He noted that "propagandists 
and social science teachers sometimes are asked whether the phrty 
snd its organlzationr should so thoroughly 'push their way' into 
economic problems and whether state and economic agencies crnnor 
themselves handle economic matters and decide them." He wrote that 
Lenin had considered it necessary to raise the independence of 
soviet institutions and officials, leaving the party with responsibility 
for "general leadership." 
Although his articles no longer appeared in the major party 
publications, Petrenko retained his Central Committee post. He was 
identified in the September 1971 QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY as a 
"responsible official of the Central Committee," and he was reported 
to have addressed a July 1971 conference of "Znaniye" Society 
lecturers on the 24th CPSU Congress and the role of the party. He 
was again identified in PRAVDA on 22 May 1973 as a "reeporsible 
official" of an unnamed Central Committee section and as a member 
of a delegation headed by Katushev atter...ling a Warsaw theoretical 
conference. 
RE:ENT ARTICLES In 1973 Petrenko _rice again emerged as an author 
in PARTY LIFE, KOMMUNIST and PRAVDA. In his April 
1973 PARTY LIFE and July 1973 :COMMUNIST articles, he subtly manipulated 
the words and experience of Cuban and North Vietnamese party leaders 
in a manner calculated to support a case for ending party interference 
in the economy. In his 19 October 1973 PRAVDA article, he advocated 
his views more directly. 
In the kpeil PARTY LIFE article he reported that in August 1970 the 
Cuban Politburo had adopted a basic decision to separate party and 
state functions. Before that, party cadres had handled both party 
and economic work, regional secretaries had directed plan fulfillment, 
and party secretaries at entervrise) had concurrently served as 
directors of their plants. "Now party and economic functions at 
enterprises have been separated," h.. wrote, and, according to Castro, 
Cube was raising the role of mass public organizations which had been

in the July KOMMUNIST article, a laudatory review of a new book by 
North Vletnameae First Secretary Le Duan, Petrenko focused on Le 
Duan's etacements 4pholding the prerogatives of state organization4 
in the winagement of the economy. He cited Le Duan's statement 
that it is a "task of extreme importance" that party officials and 
committee,/ "raise the scientific level of their leadership by close 
collaboration with scholars and specialists and leIrn to rely on 
their knowledge and experience," and he quoted Lentn to the effect 
that "a communist who cannot demonstrate his ability to rally and 
modestly direct the work cf specialists . . . is ofteu harmful." 
In the 19 October PRAVDA article, Petrenko stated that the quality 
of work by "state and public organizations"--economic agencies, 
local soviets and track. unichls--had improved so much that party 
agencies no longer need iaterfev. in their work and are free to 
concentrate on more impertant problems nf socio-economic, political 
and spiritual life. While crediting the party with the "leading 
role" in the state, he nrged state and public orgaaizatlons to 
"use their rights and opportunities to the maximum." Further, 
Petrerko attributed the party's abilif:y to lead industry, agriculture, 
science, culture, state administration and foreign policy to "the 
growth of the intellectual potential of the party"--an article of 
faith among revisionist party officials and intellectuals. 
Petrenko's article was clearly aimed at a profoundly derogatory 
point of view toward the Soviet middle class of economic specialists 
and administrator advanced by such reactionary party ideologists 
and spokesmen for Brezhnev as V. P. Stepanov and R. I. Kosolapov. 
It was not until the public disclz,sure of a partial text If Brezhnev's 
10 December 1973 speech at the two-day CPSU plenum that Brezhnev 
was directly linked with this point of view. According to the 
published version of Brezhnev's remark, he called for a "party 
approach" in all spheres of economic activity and, reflecting eviCent 
disdain, declared that "one cannot approach leadership of the 
economy and the improvement of thia leadership from narrow managerial--
let alone technocratic--positiovs," Petrenko's response to the 
body of opinion championed by BreAnev was thus tantamount to a 
direct accusation of failure by Brazhnev in economic policy.

NEW GRECHKO ARTICLE REFLECTS RECENT SHIFTS IN OFFICIAL OUTLOOK 
An article by Soviet Defense Minister Grechko on regime-army 
reletians, appearik.; in the May issue of the journal QUESTIONS OF 
CPSU HISTORY, provides an authoritative glimpse at recent changes 
in the Soviet official outlook on domestic and world affairs. In 
tone, content and documontation the article differs markedly 
from an earlier Grechko article on the same subject, published in 
a Fkbruary 110,1J of KOMMUNIST No. 3, 1974. The two articles are 
also noteworthy 5ecauae their respective dates of publication--
18 February and 24 April?coincide with significant changes in the 
editorial board of KOMMUNIST and the supervisory agency for 
QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY. The KOMMUNIST article was written at a 
time when that journal was without a chief editor, while the 
QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY article appeared after the former chief 
editor of KOMMUNIST? Anatoliy Yegorov, was identified as new 
director of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, the CPSU Central 
Committee agency responsible for publication of QUESTIONS OF 
CPSU HISTORY. 
The most notable substantive differences between the two Grechko 
articles may be summarized as follows: 
On the issue of olitical authorit over the armed forces, 
the first article meandered vaguely in a purely doctrinal vein 
about the founding fathers of communist revolution; the second 
stressed the strict subordination of the armed forces to collegial 
organs of political authority in a manner suggesting that certain 
military leaders have 'oefv.. reprimanded for major violations of the 
political-military code. 
4. On the image of the outside world, the first article conveyed 
a conventional, doctrinaire and almost frantic image of a genuine 
external military threat; the second projected an image of a 
potential, though clearly manageable, external military danger. 
-1- On the authority for tine differences in outlook, the first 
article cited a passage from Brezhnev's 26 October speech to the 
World Peace Congress in Moscow, which referred ominously to 
"continuity; and even intensifying" preparations in the West for 
a new "world war;" the second conspicuously skirted this passag2, 
repeatedly alluding instead to statements made in the controversial 
"CPSU Program," formulated in the Khrushchev era, and the "CPSU 
Central Committee report" to the 24th CPSU Congress in 1971.

4. On a military buildup, the first: article reiterated the 
conventional goal of strengthening the 41.fensive capability 
and combat might of the armed forces; th.c second treated that 
goal more as a necessary evil that-. as a desirable condition of 
international relations. 
4 On military training prmal, the first article recited the 
conventional doctrinaire ritual on the "profoundly scientif'.: 
line" of the regime--a line said to be fully consistent wIth the 
"polittezl, economic, spiritual and military capabilities of 
the Soviet state"; tie second stressed the overriding importance 
of military knowledge and military science and the need to avoid 
"obsolete tenets," ag well as "voluntarism and hare-brained 
schemes" in military matters. 
On domestic  affairs, the first article merely mentioned the 
official designation of the Soviet Union as a "developed" socialist 
state made at the 24th CPSU Congress; the second gave new content 
to the official formula, stressing the "complexity" of the Soviet 
system, the confrontation with "qualitatively new tasks on a 
far-reaching scale," and the consequent urgency of obtaining 
"profoundly sci)ntific, principled iendership oriented toward 
long-term objectives and ideals." 
The differences in ow. look between the two articles are go 
substantial as to raise questions about Grechko's authorship of 
either. Circumstanyially, the evidence suggests that different 
Politburo factions have at different times used his authority--
and that of the armed forces?La. their own purposes. Grechko's 
most recent article places his authority squarely on the side of 
what might be called a faction of tough-minded though practical 
modernists represented by men like Yegorov and his high-level 
backers. 
CHAIN OF COMMAND The most recent Grechko article opened with 
a clear-cut delineation of the operational 
subordination of the armed forces to the highest collegial organ 
of cuthority. the CPSU Central Committee. It cited the text 
of the official 1918 decr/4e on the political-military chain of 
command as follows: 
The policy of the military department, as well 
as of all other departments and establishments, 
is pursued on the precise basis of the general 
directives of the party via its Central 
Committee and under its direct control.

It went on to cite the authority of the CPSU Program, adopted 
by the 22d CPSU Congress in 1961 in the midst of Khrushchev's 
controversial revival of de-Stalinization, as a more recent 
basis for part) leadership over the armed forces. 
The reasons for Grechko's unusual reminder about the subordinate 
role of the armed forces in the Soviet state were undoubtedly 
compelling. The issuance of such a reminder two months after the 
appearance of an article covering the very same ground of 
regime-military relations suggests that it wan prompted by some 
act of high-level insubordination, perhaps even by Grechko 
himself. This suggestion is strengthened by Grechko's failure 
to deliver a speech or cmtribute an article to PRAVDA on 
V-E Day--the first such occurrence since he became defense mininster 
in 1967. This indignity was compounded by the appearance of an 
obscure military historian writing the 9 May PRAVDA literary 
assignment traditionally performed by the defense minister--an 
indignity surpassed only by Brezhnev'e failure to monopolize the 
May Day ceremoniea as he had in recent years. 
The QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY article also introduced a new clause 
in an otherwise stereotyped listing of "Leninist principles" 
allegedly governing Spviet military policy. The innovation, 
which did not appear in Grechko's February KOMMUNIST article, 
referred to "the unity of political, economic and military 
leadership," and this principle was ranfted second in a list of 
nine official guidelines for Soviet military behavior. Although 
the motivations behind the introduction of the new guideline are 
unclear, they clearly reflect heightened official concern over 
relaticna between militaTy leaders, on the one hand, and the 
leaeerehip of other elements of Soviet society on the other. 
This concern was notably amplified in a later passage in Grechko's 
article, which warned against "any miscalculations" in the use 
of the nation's fiscal, economic and manpower resources. The 
passage reads as follows: 
The CPSU demands that army communists, workers of the 
defense industry, and planning organs approach every 
question in the sphere of armaments and combat equip-
ment from positions of consistent and specific 
implementation of the economic and social policy 
formulated by the 24th CPSU Congress and developed in 
the documents of subsequent Central Committee plenums, 
and that they insure that deciatons, at whatever level 
they may be taken, are justified, effective, and economical. 
Any miscalculations in this sphere could lead to unjustified 
expenditure of funds and of the country's z7---7mic and man-
power resources.

Logically. a public warning of this kind cou/A be interpreted as a 
rebuke to spendthrifts in the armed forces, as well as to 
countless political1 economic and military spokesmen lobbying 
for greater defense expenditures along the lines of Grechko's 
KOMMUNIST article. Coming from an official with an unmistakable 
record as a military lobbyist, however, Grechko's warning was 
both ironic and self-critical. 
DIVERGENT IMAGES Unlike Grechko's KOMMUNIST article, which 
OF EXTERNAL THREAT wan replete with grossly exaggerated 
images of the military threat posed by the 
West, his QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY article was, by Soviet standards, 
relatively objective. Adopting a posture of almost equanimous 
vigilance, the article criticized the "aggressive'' intentions and 
actions of "capitalist monopolies" and "reactionary forces" in the 
West and regretfully affirmed that as a consequence the Soviet Union 
had been "forced" to rearm after the war. The pro forma exercise 
in criticism was marked, however, by unusual restraint and little 
truculence or invective. 
SurInisingly enough, the Soviet defense minister surveyed the state 
of world affairs with almost unbounded confidence. In this respect, 
his most recent article echoed themes akin to those sounded in the 
awards speeches by Kosygin and Podgornyy in Minsk and Riga last 
November and December, respectively. He referred to the existence of 
a "new correlation of forces" in world affairs which was "constantly" 
and irretrievably moving in favor of the Interests of socialism. 
Thus, while taking appropriate note of the potential danger of war, 
he took special pains to discount its likelihood under present 
and foreseeable circumstances arid to reiterate the regime's commitment 
to detente and "the struggle for general and complete disarmament." 
By contrast, the themes of detente and disarmament had been notably 
absent in Grechko's KOMMUNIST article. Instead, that article echoed 
the militant, truculent themes made familiar in the past by hardline 
theoreticians of the Lenin Military-Political Academy, the notorious 
ideological citadel of the army's political cadres. Not only did 
the earlier urticle reiterate in belligerent terms the validity of 
the Leninist doctrine on war and politics, it also totally disregarded 
the doctrinal implication- of the advent of nuclear weapons on the 
world scene. It pointed to the."innately aggressive" nature of the 
"capitalist states," and stressed the role of military power as the 
"only means" to curb their "expansionist aspirations" and ensure 
victory in the event of war. "War and aggression," it mainteined, 
"always have been and will remain the inevitable companinn of capitalist 
sociezy."

FBIS TRENDS 
30 MAY 1974 
The bellicoie rhetoric about the threat posed by the West was 
authenticated by reference to Brezhnev's 26 Oirober'speech in 
Moscow: "Nor do we have the right to forget, Comrade 
L.I. Brezhnev said at the Moscow World Peace Congress, 'that 
even under conditions of relaxation vf international tension, 
a procliss which is in fact tantamount to material preparation 
for world war is continuing and even intensifying." Grechko 
had reiterated this very same formula in his January awards 
speech in Kazan, as had Suslov and Pcnomarev?they 'lone among 
the members of the Soviet rvting group. However, the formula 
was missing from Grechko's mote temperate appraisal of the inter-
national situation in his 13 March report to a Kremlin conference 
of Komsomol secretaries in the armed forces. 
MILITARY DOCTRINE The two Grechko articles also displayed 
sharply divergent interpretations of the 
origins of Soviet military doctrine. The KOMMUNIST article 
flatly stressed the ideological sources of Soviet military doctrine: 
Developing these [military] tenets to conform with new 
historical conditions, V.I. Lenin formulated a harmonlous 
doctrine on the defense of the socialist fath rland, 
thereby making a major contribution to the treasury of 
Marxism. He enriched the ideas of Marx and Engels on 
the need for the armed defense of the victorious prole-
tariat's achievements and the creation of its military 
organization and resolved many questions raised by the 
practical revolutionary struggle of the working class 
and all working people against the aggressive forces 
of the old world. 
Without slighting Lenin's role in the development of the Soviet 
state, the QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY article gave an entirely 
different account of Soviet military development: 
In building the Soviet army the party had to travel 
unknown paths, for there were no ready-made theo-
retical theses--even less, any practical experience--
in this respect.

FBIS TRENDS 
30 MAY 1974 
Instead of stressing the role of seemingly immutable ileological 
principles in the shaping of the Soviet armed forces, as was 
done in the earlier article, the more recent Grechko article 
focused on the impact of domestic and foreign influences on the 
leadership and structure of the armed forces. Aba,:e all, it 
stressed the combined role of "Marxist-Leninist teaching on war 
and the army and of research and conclusions of Soviet military 
science," with particular emphasis on the latter. 
Buttressed with quotations from Lenin not contained in the 
February article, the more recent Grechko article stressed the 
overriding importance of military science. Lenin's statements 
on "the tremendous significance of military knowledge and on 
the need to "really learn military affairs" were cited, along 
with his dictum that "a modern army cannot be built without 
stience." 
TECHNOCRATIC OUTLOOK In keeping with a pragmatic outlook on 
the development of the armed forces, 
the QUESTIONS OF CPSU HISTORY article offered an unusual glimpse 
at the components of a "deve/oped" or "mature" socialist 
society, which had been touched upon only briefly in Grechko's 
earlier article. Placing a high premium on qualities of lzader-
ship, the article declared: 
A mature socialist society is a complex social 
organilm, but the mcre complex it is, the more 
difficult it is to direct, and the more it needs 
proper leadership. 
The article went on to emphasize that the search for solutions to 
"qualitatively new tasks on a far-reaching scale" would require 
"profo?ndly scientific, principled leadership oriented toward 
long-term objectives and ideals expressing the aspirations and 
interests of the working people of all nations and nationalities and 
of all citizens of the Soviet Union." The clearly pragmatic and 
enlightened outlook on domestic affairs conveyed in this article 
was a far cry from the attitude projected in the earlier one, which 
had described the Soviet regime in characteristically doctrinaire 
terml as a "state of the dictatorship of the proietariat"--a 
concept conveying visions of class warfare instead of social harmony. 
POLICY IMPLICATIONS Where the earlier Grechko article .:learly 
seemed to be plugging for incremmarillitery 
expenditures in the face of an allegedly implacable foe, the more 
recent article seemed to view the maintenance of a strong military

posture as an unavoidable though unpleasant reality of modern 
life. However, in attempting to make the most out oZ an 
imperfect world, the more recent Grechko article advanced a 
number of unusual ideas with perhaps far-reaching implications 
for Soviet behavior at home and abroad. 
On domestic affairs, it spoke of a "definitive" and "irretrievable" 
withering away of the coercive functions of the Soviet armed forces. 
This was explained by the alleged absence of "exploiter classes 
and social groups against which military force might be used." 
This unusual statement, which clearly is more applicable to the 
distant Soviet past than to the present period of Soviet politics, 
may be a veiled reference to the coercive functions exercised by 
organs of Soviet authority other than the armed forces. Insofar 
as the KGB has been particularly active against dissident elements 
in recent years, the statement in the Grechko article could signal 
a possible onset of internal relaxation. 
In foreign affairs, the Grechko article referred to the "close 
union" between the theoretical and practical activity of foreign 
communist parties, and it credited those parties with a "leading 
role" in their respective domestic pursuits and international 
relations. Whether this statement foreshadows any change in the 
traditional relationship between the Soviet Union and its allies 
remains to be seen. 
The Grechko article also appealed to Soviet citizens to become 
"consistent internationalists," as well as "ardent patriots." 
In a similar vein of internationalism, the article, while 
reaffirming the traditional goalv of detente and disarmament and 
disclaiming any predatory intentirns on the part of the Soviet 
state, introduced a notable escalation in the Soviet posture of 
opposition to the export of "counterrevolution." Where earlier 
elite statements had spoken of Soviet "solidarity" with and "active" 
support for this cause, the Grechko arti=le added a new "purposeful" 
ingredient to the Soviet posture: 
In its foreign policy activity the Soviet state 
actively and purposefully opposes the export of 
counterrevolution and the policy of oppression, 
supports the national liberation struggles, 
and resolutely resists imperialist aggression 
in whatever distant region of our planet it may 
appear.

The new Grechko formulation may be related to recent signs of 
movement in Moscow's public posture on Vietnam. Moscow moved 
in March to give its first authoritative endorsement to 
Vietnamnse communist demands for a settlement of outstanding 
political issues in South Vietnam, after avoiding official 
Soviet endorsement of earlier six-point proposals in April 
and June 1973 by the South Vietnamese Provisional Revolutionary 
Government for implementation of the political aspects of the 
January 1973 Vietnam peace agreement. 
The first indications of this shift came in Soviet reports of a 
20 March 1974 meeting between Kosygin and DRV Premier Pham Van 
Dong, which quoted the Soviet premier as declaring the "unswerving 
solidarity" of the Soviet Union for DRV and PRG efforts for 
implementation of the Paris agreement "on a lust settlement of the 
internal political problems of South Vietnail.," Two days later, 
on the 22d, the PRG issued a government statement with a revised 
version of its six-point platform. The six points were finally 
officially endorsed by Moscow on 31 March, in a TASS statement 
which said that they had met with "great satisfaction by 
authoritative Soviet circles." 
In terms of the novelty of its outlook on Soviet domestic and 
foreign affairs--not to mention its possibly far-reaching 
practical implications--the latest Grechko article clearly 
ranks among the most striking and most explicit pronouncements 
to emerge r....ently from the Soviet Union.
