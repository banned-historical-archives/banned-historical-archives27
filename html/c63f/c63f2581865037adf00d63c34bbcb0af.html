The Repatriates Reception Bureau officials promptly ushered 
the repatriates into a warehouse on the quay converted into a 
rest facility for repatriates. In the gathering held there to 
welcome the repatriates, the representative of repatriates from 
a certain prefecture in Japan handed a message from the local 
Chosen Soren to the chairman of the welcoming committee. After 
the repatriate group leader and the Reception Bureau chairman 
delivered their speeches, 50 to 60 local Democratic Youths League 
members entertained the repatriates with Korean dances and music 
and square dances. 
It was obvious from the beginning that the North Korean 
officials and citizens were avoiding conversation with repatriates ? 
But when unavoidable, they replied to the repatriate's questions 
in a formal and evasive manner. 
Repatriates are sent to either Ch'Ongjin 
on their group number. The 9th group 
being an odd number, was taken to the reception center at Hamhying; 
the repatriates returning in the group with an even number are taken 
to the reception center at Ch'Ongjin.

or Hamhying depending 
repatriates were put aboard a train made up 
of 13 Soviet-made sleepers, departed for Hamhying after dark on the 
day of their arrival at Ch'Ongjin. The sleeper's capacity was 56 
passengers, but about 100 repatriates were loaded on each car X1-HUM 
A portrait of KIM Il-song and a poster with "Long Live Korean 
Labor Party!" and "Long Live Marshal KIM Il-song!" were posted side 
by side above the door at either end of each sleeper. 
the established rule for displaying the Premier's 
portrait and the Party slogans is that the portrait must always 
be at the right side and the slogans at the left and that an35oxi -HUM 
infraction of this rule is punished severely. 
Two Reception Bureau officials assigned to each car distributed 
tags showing assignment of quarters at the reception center. 
IV. Repatriate Reception Center at HamhOng  
1. Facility 
The repatriate reception center at Hamh4ng is made up of 
three 5-storied concrete apartment buildings located across the 
plaza from the Hamhying railway station. These buildings, each with 
approximately 260 apartment units, were built in 1959 with financial 
aid from East Germany in order to receive repatriates from Japan. 
The socialist countries granted aids to finance specific projects 
in rebuilding North Korea after the Korean War. East Germany's 
project was the reconstruction of Hamhiang. 
50X1-HUM 
The apartments were assigned, beginning from the 1st floor, 
with primary considerations given to the size and age of family 
members. A married man is given a 2- or 3-room unit, depending on 
the size of his family,  bachelors were put on the 
5th floor, five of them in each of the 1-room units. The 1-room 
unit was about the size of a 6-mat room, but it had a wash basin, 
a flush toilet, a shower (bath tub for family unit), and was 
steam heated, but it did not have a closet, furniture, and house-
hold utensils. There was plenty of running water on th day, 
but the pressure dropped so much from the next day that 
had hardly enough water to wash their faces.

The repatriates had their meals in the dining hall on the 
1st floor of their respective apartment buildings. Meals were 
far inferior to those served aboard the repatriate ship. The 
main dish was 250 to 300 grams of polished rice, but subsidiary 
dishes did not taste good owing to lack of seasoning. 
The apartment store outlet sold Soviet chocolate bars and 
North Korean candies, fruits, wine, cigarettes, clothes, and other 
items to the repatriates, but not yet aware of shortage of goods 
in North Korea, no one bought them in substantial quantities. 
The playground between the buildings went unused because 
it was too cold and also because no recreational equipment was 
available. 
2. Welcome and tour of the city 
The repatriates unpacked their suitcases and bathed on 
their first day at the reception center. They boarded a dozen 
buses after supper to attend a welcoming rally held at the 
municipal theater. These buses, each with a 50-passenger capacity 
and imported from Czechoslovakia, were operated exclusively for 
the center. Repatriates were not required to go; but about 90 
percent of them attended since they were still responsive as it 
was only a day after their arrival in North Korea. 
The municipal theater, like the reception center, was 
built with East German aid. The seating capacity was 1,500, and 
seats and other equipments were East German made. The theater 
normally shows motion pictures and plays. 
The rally opened with a city official's denunciation of 
Japanese imperialism and sympathy extended toward the repatriate's 
long hardship in Japan and a praise that the Korean liberation was 
a great victory for the Party and KIM Il-song. The repatriate 
group leader responded with a speech crediting KIM 11-song and the 
Party for making repatriation possible. A program of performances, 
far more substantial than the one given at the rest facility in 
Chiongjin, followed. The rally lasted for about three hours. 
Other than the repatriates, only the city's citizens 
selected by the Reception Bureau attended the rally. 
No function was held for repatriates in general on the 
second day, but in the evening the local Democratic Youths League 
organization sponsored a gathering in the Youths Hall in the city 
to welcome the returning youths. About 250 young men in the 
repatriate group attended, and they were mingled with the league 
members in seating arrangement. After the representatives of the two 
groups addressed the gathering, the youths enjoyed music and 
square dancing. 
On the third day, the repatriates were required to submit 
personal history statements, their preference for employment and 
place of settlement, and other papers and documents (refer to a 
later paragraph). 
On the fourth day, they were taken on a tour of a farm, a 
fertilizer factory, a nursery, and construction sites in the out-
skirts of Hamhung, but preoccupied by the anxiety over not knowing 
about their final destination or job assignment, they blankly 
followed the guide. 
The fertilizer factory, the repatriates were told, was 
formerly a 'Japanese-operated nitrogen factory, and its monthly out-

put is 5,000 tons. The farm they saw, according to the guide, 
was a model agricultural co-operative, but its facilities and 
implements were quite inadequate. Although the guide boasted 
that the farm was completely mechanized, they were cutting rice 
stalks for fodder with cogwheels (?). 
3. Placement 
As mentioned earlier, the repatriates submitted personal 
history statements and other documents on the third day at the 
reception center. They each received a grant of 20 win in return. 
The documents required were a copy each of personal history 
statement (biographic information, educational background, family, 
and skill), biography (kind of life led since the birth and 
description about friends and relatives), and job preference (list-
ing of three preferences for employment and place to settle down). 
50X1-HUM 
exaggeration and falsification went unchecked and that the job 
assignment is based on these entries 
  A repatriate who was only a high50X1-HUM 
school graduate stated in his personal history statement that he 
was attending a college and was allowed to enter a North Korean 
college without any fuss  50X1-HUM 
another 
repatriate who had no technical skill acquired a job as an 
accomplished technician by falsehood. (In later gruups the North 
Koreans required students to produce student certificates.) 
Contrary to the Chosen Soren's assurance that each 
repatriate would be given 200 wOn, only 20 wOn was granted to each 
repatriate regardless of his age or sex. 
Interviews of individual repatriatesibr job assignment 
commenced from the seventh day. Five or six repatriates were called 
to a room at a time and interviewed by two middle-aged officials, 
and they assigned jobs according to the general plan worked by 
the Government. If no agreement could be reached, the interview 
was repeated on the next day. 50X1-HUM

Apparently only the group leader is granted the job assign-
ment of his choice. It seems that about 10 percent of repatriates 
accept placement at the first interview, 30 percent after the 
fifth or sixth interviews, and the rest at the third or the fourth. 
The interviewers obviously prefer to place repatriates in 
coal mines, mineral mines, farms and smaller industrial cities. 
Some repatriates, unable to reach an agreement with the interviewer, 
engage in heated argument with him. Some become drunk on wine 
purchased from the reception center store and run amuck in anger. 
However, there are cases in which repatriates had their way

V. Enterprise Management Structure and Life of Workers  
1. OnsOng Stock-farm 
A state-operated enterprise, the OnsOng Stock-farm covers 
an area of over 4 kilometers square and employs about 1,000 persons 
(farm population number 5,000 when dependents are included). Its 
livestock is made up of 100 head of cattle, 2,000 to 3,000 pigs, 
10,000 head of sheep, 3,000 leghorns, and several tens of thousands 
of rabbits. 
2. Management structure 
Every enterprise is comprised of two parts: management

and the Party apparat. The structure of state-operated stock-
farms and agricultural co-operatives is as follows: 
Manager, 
Assistant Manager 
Livestock Department 
Work Squads 
Farming Department 
Work Squads 
Finance Department 
Hospital 
Stores 
Workers -- Cadre Department 
(Handles personnel affairs; a large enterprise 
has a workers department and a cadre department) 
Mechanical Department 
(Makes and maintains farm machinery and imple-
ments) 
Party committee chairman  
Party committee vice chairman 
Party cell chairmen 
Party branch chairmen 
Party members 
The manager is appointed by the Minister of Agriculture; 
each work squad is made up of about 20 men and women; the names of 
departments differs according to the types of enterprises. The 
party committee chairman is in actual control of both the manage-
ment and Party affairs; he is appointed by the Korean Labor Party 
headquarters. The manager is often the Party committee vice 
chairman. 
Each enterprise also has local organizations of the Demo-
cratic Youths League, the Democratic Women's League, the Korean 
League of Workers Unions, and the Pioneers. Members of these 
organizations are organized under respective local chairmen and 
branch chairmen under them. All workers and their families with 
the exception of infants, belong to some kind of organization. 
3. Production plan and norm 
Each enterprise, toward the end of year, receives a pro-
duction quota for the following year from the Government. The 
planning committee of the enterprise, made up of departmental 
chief and Party cadres, formulates the enterprise's production 
plan on the basis of the assigned quota and sets norms for each 
department. A large enterprise has a permanent planning department, 
which continuously keeps tab on production.

  The norm tor a truck 
driver is comparatively light  in North Korea because driving is 
considered a first-rate skill 
Incidentally, it was per-50X1-HUM 
miscible to carry up to five persons the truck bed without special 
authorization. 
4. Daily schedule for workers 
All workers, regardless of where they work, are required 
daily to be at their respective places of employment by 0730 
hours and participate in indoctrination until the work begins at 
0800 hours. Conducted by the work squad leader or a party activist, 
who take turn as the occasion demanded, the morning indoctrination 
is devoted to listening to commentaries on current events and 
dissemination of the Party policies, mainly on the basis of the 
Nodong Sinmun and the Minju Sinmun articles. 
Lunch and rest from 1100 to 1300 hours. From 1700 hours, 
when the work stops, to 1730 hours, the workers are assembled 
in the socalled "work review" meeting, where their work accomplish-
ment for the day is assessed individually and instructions are given. 
They are free from 1730 hours onward except on one evening each 
week when they are required to attend weekly indoctrination. 
5. Indoctrination 
The weekly indoctrination is held from 1730 hours 
respectively by the earlier-mentioned organizations at the enter-
prise. Since no time limit is set, indoctrination lasts from 
two hours to as long as four hours. 
The weekly indoctrination requires study of 1) the party 
history, 2) the memoirs of anti-Japanese partisan war, 3) the 
resulutions adopted by the Party Congress, 4) the resolutions 
adopted by the People's Committee, and 5) the teachings of KIM 
Il-song. The time devoted to these items average 30 percent for 
1), 20 percent for 2), and 50 percent for 3), 4), and 5), with 
the proportion among the last three varying according to the 
emphasis of the time. In 5), the workers are required to memorize 
the gist of each and all the utterances KIM Il-song made while 
touring factories, farms, and other places. 
The weekly indoctrination is conducted mostly by the 
chairmen of the respective organizations. These chairmen, in 
turn, must attend the cadre indoctrination course, which is con-
ducted once a week, from 1500 to 2200 hours for the vice Party 
Committee chairman and above. 
The workers who fail to attend the weekly indoctrination 
are not only harshly criticized and their work credits reduced, 
but they are often banished or placed under arrest. 
Weekly indoctrination efforts almost always repeat a 
basic pattern: 1) lecture, 2) discussion, 3) written test, 4) 
workers' comments (their comments are read at the general meeting 
held each month; those who submit assenting comments are recommended 
for award and those with negative comments are criticized) and 
5) discussion of the workers' comments.

The subject taken up was the production plan for 1962. The 
lecturer, after repeating the analysis of the world situations 
two or three times, explained why increased production is needed and 
gave a briefing on the Party production quota for the enterprise; 
the ensuing discussion was devoted to what each worker intended 
to do to help meet the production goal; the written test required 
each worker to describe the Party policy and his plan for doing 
his share to help the enterprise achieve its quota. 
The Party tolerates no laxity in indoctrination efforts, 
and it ceaselessly harps on the need for indoctrination to the 
following effect: "We cannot foretell when and how the enemy 
might confront us, so we must be in a constant state of readiness 
by arming ourselves spiritually through indoctrination. Indoctri-
nation is synonymous to developing one's revolutionary vigilance." 
But most of the workers and low-echelon party men privately 
indicate their dislike for indoctrination. Repatriates particular 
detested it so much that in their early months of their return to 
North Korea, they reacted with almost neurotic abhorrence whenever 
they were told to attend one. 
6. Remuneration  
The workers' monthly wages vary as follows according to  
their categories of skill  
Average Mo. Wage 
Categories 2 to 4 (unskilled workers) 27 to 28 win 
Category 5 (semi-skilled workers)  31 to 32 wOn 
Category 6 (technicians) (unknown to Sourc 
Category 7 (engineers)  ft 
Category 8 (engineers)  70 to 80 wOn 
Party membership or Party position does not mean a better 
salary, but the pay for workers in a same jjob category varies  
with enterprises. For example, the salaries of workers in the  
enterprises, namely, the Ch'ongpinSteel 
or six other  enterprises, are 5 to 6 won better than the workers 
of corresponding categories at the Onsongi Stock-farm, which is a  
second-class enterprise, and the salaries for those in the second-
class enterprises are 5 to 6 won more than wages paid to third-
class enterprise workers. 
The wages of workers in enterprises operated by county, 
(gun) or province (do) (cottage industry) vary according to the  
productivity of the enterprises: few workers earn more than the  
corresponding workers in the first-class enterprises, but the  
rest earn less than those in the third-class enterprises. 
7. Cost of living  
50X1-HUM 
Five percent of the salary is withheld for taxes nom-
pulsory saving, and social security, a  
truck driver in Category 5, received a monthly wage50X1-HUM 
of 31./3 won, of which 1.00 won was withheld for taxes, 5.00 won  
for compulsory saving, .50 won for the social security system, .30  
won for the Democratic Youths League membership fee, and 3.00  
to 5.00 won for food items (meat, edible fats and oil, and rice; the  
cost varied by month) rationed to him by the stock-tarm. After  
paying 9.00 won more for board (cost of seasonings, vegetables, 
fuel, etc.), he only had about 10,00 left each month, out of which  
he paid for entertainments (mostly movies) and ci arettes (refer  
to the table showing commodity prices)

skill, and output to receive the "Chiollima Squad" designation. 
A work squad has to work hard to win the title but even harder 
to keep it. Ordinary workers are not interested at all in the 
title, but if one or more dedicated ones among the squad members 
propose extra efforts to try for the title, the rest of the squad 
has no particular reason to object, or more correct to say that 
they fear being branded reactionaries and punished, so they 
cooperate to the extent that they would not be blacklisted. 
9. Holidays, physical fitness, and cultural activities 
North Korea makes no distinction between sexes in work 
norm or wages. The workers, whether men or women, are given a 
total of 14 holidays a year. Expectant mothers are given a 
total of 70?lays to rest with pay before and after child birth. 
The workers with superior performance are allowed to 
spend their vacation at a rest facility operated by the Federation 
of Labor Unions upon recommendation by the federation's subsidiary 
organization at the enterprise, but in most cases the workers 
chosen are not enthusiastic because they are not permitted to take 
their family along. 
The North Korean Government is keen on the physical 
fitness and cultural activities of workers, but lacking in 
facilities and equipment, the worker is limited to calisthenics 
during lunch hours and square dances on May Day and Korean 
Liberation Day. Cultural activities and entertainment available 
for workers are watching plays and movies. Motion picture 
theaters are always packed. Having no place else to go, it is 
common for one to see the same picture a half dozen times. 
10. Medicines 
High-quality medicines such as penicillin and strepto-
mycin are imported from the Soviet Union or Communist China and 
are not administered on an ordinary worker unless he is seriously 
ill. The newspaper reported quite some time ago that the Na-1_wilm 
Koreans have built and begun operating a penicillin factory, 
 I Other 
drugs are also in very short supply; soda is used for indigestion, 
and morphine as the panacea for most of other disorders.  
50X1-HUM 
11. Differentiation between Party members and ordinary workers 
There is no distinction between a Party man and an 
ordinary worker as far as work or wages are concerned. But a party 
member is not subjected to arrest unless the cell to which he 
belongs approves; he is given a lighter sentence at the court on the 
ground that he could be reformed; and the party membership is pre-
requisite to becoming administrative or political cadres of an 
enterprise. So workers, particularly young men, strive relentlessly 
to become a party member. 
Party members in North Korea are said to now number 
1,400,000 but to qualify for membership one must not only excel 
in work performance and discipline but more important is to be 
born to a right family background. A prospective member is re-

VI Ch'ollima Movement  
1. Origin 
50X1 -HUM 
the movement originated 
with a man who called for firm unity and a progress of a speed 
of a ch'ollima (flying horse) for the reconstruction of the father-
land. The movement was local in scope at first but extended over 
the entire North Korea with the government encouragement. The 
man who initiated the movement is now a "hero." 
2. Objectives 
The ch'ollima movement had been introduced into schools 
and places of employment for brain-washing and organizing 
students and workers, educating them and improving their efficiency, 
and having them keep an eye on fellow students or workers. The 
movement is the basic KLP tool for implementation of its socialist 
policies.

4. Qualifications 
50X1 -HUM 
the proceedings for application 
as follows: 
a. The group (the league or the federation) at the school 
(class) or enterprise adopts a resolution to campaign for con-
ferment of the title. 
b. The campaign is put underway with the leader (party 
cadre) guiding the efforts to acquire necessary qualifications 
and improve efficiency. 
c. The application is submitted to the city, province, 
and county party committees (TN: Presumably through Party channel). 
d. The city, province, and county party committees examine 
the qualifications. 
When the group is found to be qualified, the "Ch'ollima" certi-
ficate is granted and each member of the group receives a "Ch'ollima" 
badge, which he wears over his right chest. Qualifications may 
vary with the school or enterprise, but the recipients must be 
members of either the Federation of Labor Unions or the Democratic 
Youths League. If any member of the applying group is found to be 
disqualified, the title is denied to the entire group. 
5. Activities 
a. The movement strives to increase production by effecting 
improvements to double the norm.

b. It endeavors to step up indoctrination efforts and 
further knowledge and appreciation of the Party history, political 
science, and economics in order to boost activities of the 
respective organizations. 
c. It endeavors to "reconstruct" numan beings, that is, 
to covert a straggler in the group into a man adapted to the 
North Korean situation. In other words, the purpose is to en-
lighten the ones with less appreciation, and if tnere is a 
repatriate in the group, he becomes the target of the group's 
efforts. A suitable target is created where none is found. 
d. New ideas for solving the group's problems are worked 
out and executed. 
b. Awards 
Formerly the group which won the title also received 
clothes, radios, watches, and foodstuff (usually candies), but now 
only the certificate, badges, and handkerchiefs are issued. No 
special award in kind is given to the recipients of the double, 
triple, or quadruple Ch'ollima title. 
7. Present situation and workers' attitude 
The title recipients not only received material incentives 
formerly as mentioned in the above paragraph but the leader was 
promoted to party official and non-party members were made party 
members and assigned to better positions. Anyone wearing the 
badge was looked upon with envy by others, and all workers, 
regardless of their places of employment, participated eagerly and 
fully in the movement. But now one out of 10 workers wear the 
badge and some of them are recipients of double and even triple 
and quadruple badges (the badge makes no distinction for number 
of conferments). Moreover, to receive the badge entails con-
siderable amount of extra time and efforts and sacrifice of what 
-little personal leisure available to them. Under these circumstances, 
increasing number of workers see no reason why they should p,9ticipate 
in the movement when it calls for a greater norm with no refiuMeration. 
A majority of the groups which conduct the movement fail these days. 
The Party, which considers the movement lobe the principal implement 
for conduct of its socialist policies, is having the leaders (cadres) 
initiate the movement, but it has become sterotyped and most of 
the workers seem to merely go along from force of habit. 
8. Disqualification 
Because of the growing trend toward ignoring the movement, 
increasing number of groups are now being stripped of the title 
and the badges. A recipient group must improve, or at least 
maintain, the efficiency in order to hold the title, and if the 
check by the Party Central Headquarters conducted once or twice 
a year uncovers lowered achievement standard of even one member 
of the group, that group is deprived of the title and its members 
their badges. 
Cadres now resort increasingly to falsification of 
individual and group achievements in order to conceal declined 
efficiency, fearing that their leadership capability would be 
questioned if the truth becomes known.

Guard Section 
4. People's squad (Inminpan) 
The people's squad is similar to the neighborhood 
association in wartime Javan. 
50X1 -HUM 
a. Organization 
A people's squad is made up of 15 to 20 households. 
A typical apartment building has four floors and houses 64 house-
holds, so these households are organized into four squads. A 
residential area made up of private homes is divided into sections 
of 20 households each, and the households in each section is 
organized into a people's squad. 
b. Squad members 
The people's squad is made up mostly of housewives who 
are not members of the Party or other organizations. Other house-
hold members are not included because they are either party members 
or members of Federation of Labor Unions and other organizations. 
c. Qualifications 
No special qualifications is needed to become a squad 
member. Normally no more than one member from each household joins 
the squad. The people's squad leader is to be elected by the 
squad, but in actual practice the leader is a housewife picked by 
the party. 
d. Activities 
Liaison among member households, security, observation 
of sanitary conditions, furnishing manpower for volunteer work, 
keeping an eye on activities of other members. 
e. Others 
Squad members are given recognition as a matter of 
formality, and they display a membership emblem at the main 
entrance to their homes. Not a coercive organization, most of 
the members do not harbor dissatisfaction toward the people's 
squad. 
VIII. Schools and School Life  
1. Entrance examination 
Anyone wishing to enter a school for higher education 
applies at the Federation of Labor Unions (FLU) organization at 
the place of his employment: the FLU organization submits the 
application with its letter of recommendation to the school via 
higher echelon FLU organizations. 
The entrance examination is made up of two parts: written 
and interview. The general subjects covered in the entrance exami-
nation for professional schools and above are mathmetics, physics, 
chemistry, Russian language, Korean history, and the Party history. 
The interview is conducted at the county people's committee. In 
screening ordinary applicants, more importance is placed on the 
recommendation than the results of the written examination. Party 
members, their offsprings and relatives, and those with the record 
of military service are given a priority consideration in entering 
the schools of their choice.

The Najin Maritime Training School was said to be a college 
level institution entrance examination   
 : the mathematics test 
made up of a quadratic equation problem, a factoring problem, a 
Pythagorean theorem problem and the chemistry test consisted of 
identifying five elementary symbols. 50X1-HUM 
2. State-operated professional schools and colleges 
The state-operated professional school are the highest 
technical training schools in North Korea, and there are altogether 
six of them in the country. They are: the Najin Maritime Train-
ing School,   the physics school and t150X1-HUM 
transportation school at P'yongyang, the fishery school at Sinp'o, 
and the agricultural school and the construction school at Onsan, 
and one other school. 
As for colleges, North Korea has the KIM Il-song University, 
a construction college, a transportation college, a physical 
edacation college, an art college, a music college, a teachers' 
college, a light industry college, and a dental college. In 
addition, each province has a college devoted to technical tralning. 
3. Curriculum of the Najin Maritime Training School 
The Najin Maritime Training School had a student body of 
about 4,000, of which about 2,000 were enrolled in the navigation 
department (50 students per term), 160 in the engine department 
(30 to 40 per term), and 40 in the management department (enroll-
ment in this department iftadjusted to the need). 
There were 32 mandatory subjects for the navigation 
students, of which Source remembers the following: 
a. General subjects: mathematics, physics, chemistry, 
drafting, Russian, physical education, literature, and history (total 
of about 100 hours; most of these subjects are completed in the 
first year, that is, the first two semesters). 
b. Technical subjects: terrestrial navigation, celestial 
navigation, ship operation, ship theory and engineering, navigation 
instruments, and log (approximately 170 hours). 
c. Engineering subjects: strength of materials, engine, 
electrical engineering (approximately 70 hours). 
d. Political subjects: the Party history, the Party 
policies, indoctrination in communism, the history of Korean 
liberation (approximately 200 hours). 
e. Health and hygiene: two subjects. 
f. Military subjects: military drill, firing practice, 
stripping of weapons, formation drill, military theories (about 
200 hours; conducted year-round). 
g. Practical training: 1) cruise of the North Korean 
waters (a month after enrollment in the school and four months be-
fore graduation) on the training ships, the

As evident from the curriculum, much emphasis is placed 
on political and military subjects. The military subjects are 
taught by reserve officers (senior officers on active duty teach 
college students), and the students receive a thoroughgoing 
training comparable to the one given to infantrymen. The students 
undergo a familiarization course to handle rifles, light and 
heavy machine guns and, before the graduation, fire 5 rounds of 
ball cartridges with a Japanese "38"rifle and 25 rounds with a 
Soviet submachinegun. A passing grade in the firing practice is 
29 points or more at 100 meters. 
The school instructors are held responsible of any student 
failing in the subjects other than the military or political ones, 
so they give obvious hints to the students during examinations, 
and cribbing is common among the students.

The students, like workers, are subjected to indoctrination 
once a week after school. 
The professional schools students are required to work 20 
days outside of the school each year (40 days in 1962; college 
students work 40 days a year). Their labor is contributed to the 
public. In addition, the students are usually required to spend 
holidays and Sundays on beautification of the school or attend 
various meetings, so they only have an average of one day every 
two months for rest. 
6. Scholarship and expenses 50X1-HUM 
The students who do not have any relative 
in North Korea are provided with a scholarship of 11.00 wOn a month, 
and those with relatives are granted 9.00 wOn a month. In addition, 
the students receive 18.00 wOn for the months they are participating 
on the training cruise. The student's expenditures are: the cost 
of board, 6.00106n a month, the Democratic Youths League fee, .01 
wOn a month, (TN sic), newspaper subscription and other reading 
materials, .30 win, and the remainder is his spending money. But 
the students never have enough money because they purchase extra 
foodstuff to augment the meager meals of staple grain and beanpaste 
soup. A vegetable dish is added only to the Sunday meals. 
IX. Food Situation and Commodity Prices  
1. Production and Ration System 
The North Korean Government announced that last year's 
domestic production of cereals was 5 million tons. At the same 
time it was able to store a 3-year supply of rice as a result of 
keeping up the ration system, which had been effective for meeting 
emergency. 
But because of strained international rdhtions of late, 
the Government is asking the people to follow its policy and continue

with the life of austerity and move forward with the program of 
socialist construction. The thinking people are secretly very 
critical of the Government by saying: "Even if everyone of the 
12 million North Koreans eat one kilogram of ride a day, 
4,380,000 tons will be more than enough for one year's supply 
of rice. And yet the Government is spending the hard-to-got 
foreign exchange for importing cereals from Cuba, Australia, 
East Germany and Vietnam. Thy is this necessary, especially 
when the Government has rice on hand? After all, the Government 
itself exposed the fact that the production figures announced 
were false and they were only for propaganda sake." The workers 
in general, too, are dissatisfied and complaining "we don't 
mind so much about clothing and housing but we want to eat stomach-
ful." 
At present, staple foods, oil and fats, fish and meat, 
are rationed, but even tobacco and matches become rationed items  
in case they run short. With the exception of some of special  
workers, the general public gets rice and other cereals as staple  
foods. Miscellaneous cereals include corn, corn flour, songhun, 
wheat flour, potatoes, etc. The percentage of staple foods  
rationed--from harvest time (autumn) to early winter--is 70 percent  
rice and 30 percent miscellaneous cereals. Lately the percentage  
of miscellaneous cereals has gradually increased that it is now  
half and half from winter to spring, 30 percent rice to 70 percent  
cereals from spring to summer, and practically all cereals by the  
time harvest starts. 
The amount of rations differs with age and kind of occu-
pation, and the amount per day for: ordinary laborer, 700 grams; 
a pit worker and fisherman, 900 grams only rice); a seaman, 
800 grams (only rice); a worker performing a hazardous job, 800  
to 900 grams (only rice); up to high school student, 400 grams; 
student, 700 grams; a housewife, 400 grams (from the early part  
of last year, even a woman working has been treated as a supporter. 
Therefore, even a person who was treated as an ordinary laborer  
and entitled to 700 grams of staple foods now gets 400 grams if  
he gets married.). And each person gets 200 grams of fats and 
oils every month and he only gets about 500 grams of meat on  
holidays. Workers engaged in hazardous job get special rations of  
1 kilogram of pork and 1 kilogram of fats and oils every month. 
Fishes near fishing ports seem to be on sale on public markets, 
but they are only available once in six months in the mountainous  
regions. 
Tobacco and matches become rationed as soon as they run  
short. A monthly ration of cigarettes is about 300.

X. Public Security and Transportation Facilities 
1. How Security is Handled by Ministry of Internal Affairs 
(reorganized in Oct 62--now Ministry of Social Security) and the 
Status of Hamgyong-pukto's Internal Affairs Bureau 
The Ministry of Internal Affairs controls the security 
of the nation. As previously mentioned (refer to 11 of V), 
ordinary people can be arrested without warrant for any trivial 
thing committed and, because they can be severely punished for 
criticizing government policy, they are leading a miserable life. 
On the other hand, the Ministry handles security cases with 
extremely conciliatory as well as repressive punishments. For 
instance, in the case of blackmarketing, ordinarily, it would go 
only to the extent of confiscating the goods. In other words, 
it would only give light sentences to habitual violators of law. 
But when a man in charge of food ration center abused his privilege 
and stole about 60 pounds of ricepte was shot to death before 
the public to let the public know what could happen to anyone 
committing the same crime.

manufacturing plant, and iron manufacturing plant. The spinning 
mill is officially called Chemical Textile Plant and its size 
is equal to those in P'yongyang and Sinuiju and is called one of 
the three major spinning mills. There are about 2,000 people 
working in this plant and most of them are women. The amount of 
production is unknown, but North Korea has announced its annual 
production of textile to be 250,000,000 meters. More than half 
of this textile is being produced by these three plants. 
The steel manufacturing plant has two revolving type  
blast furnaces (Kaitenshiki Yokbro) and employs 10,000 workers 
and produces 1,200,000 tons of steel annually. The iron manu-
facturing plant makes iron out of the iron ore shipped in from 
the Musan mines but nothing. else is known except that it employs 
about'5,000 workers. As in the case of the steel plant, going 
in and out of this iron plant is strictly controlled. 
The automobiles seen running in the city are Soviet-made 
Volga and Pobeda, and judging from the cars running around the 
city, there must be about 30 of them. Only managers of first 
class enterprises, party's county committee chairmen and general 
officers can make use of these cars. There are about 4o to 50 
jeeps, including those belonging to the military. 
2. Ch'ongjin Port 
a. Port entry and exit of foreign ships 
The principal foreign ships that entered North Korea's 
leading ports are West German ship (15,000 tons), Greek ship (12,000 
tons), Soviet ship (10,000 tons), Norwegian ship (6 to 7,000 tons), 
British ship (8,000 tons), and 7 Japanese ships that make regular 
runs. The Japanese ships are the No. 11 and 12 KINSEI MARU, 2 
under the name of INABAYAMA MAHU, the KIMISHIMA MARU of Kobe, the 
TAISHO MARU of Tokyo and one other ship. 
The main 'export items are pig iron, zinc and cement 
(to the Soviet Union) while the main items imported are wheat, 
sugar -(from Cuba), and paints. Paints and most of the wire and 
fish nets are imported from Japan. It appears that petroleum is 
being shipped overland from Communist China. 
b. Harbor facilities 
The Chiongjin port is made up of the main port, the 
west port and the fishing port. 
The main port now is being used as the base of coast-
wise and repatriation ships, as ship refueling place, and as army 
and naval base. (The average water depth is from 7 to 8 meters, and 
5 to 7 meters deep in the shallow areas.) It was paid that the 
main port would be opened as trade port from about August. The 
west port (water depth from 7 to 8 meters) is where foreign ships 
dock. 
The west port is now being dredged with the objective of 
digging to a water depth of 13 meters by 1965. When any foreign 
ship is in port, a Naval Border Guard Unit member would stand 
guard on the quay at all times and no one other than dockworkers 
is allowed to go near the ship.

c. Ch'ongjin Dredging Office 
The organizational structure of the Chtongjin Dredg-
ing Office   Transportation Ministry--
Maritime Trasnportation Administration Bureau--Hamgyong-pukto 
Maritime Transportation Administration Bureau--Ch'ongjin Dredging 
Office. The dredging office had 400 to 500 employees and 30% 
of them were working on land. There were 40 to 50 party members 
among them. The office consisted of a manager and assistant 
manager and an accounting department chief, a dredging department 
chief and an engineering department chief under them. Under the 
department chiefs were dredging boat captains and towboat captains, 
and under the towboat captains were chief engineers and dirt 
hauling boatmen. There wererthree dredgers: a 210-ton and a 
600-ton steam enginelbucket-type^dredgers, (made in Japan before 
the war) and a 400-ton, 200-hp firedome Yanmar engine. There 
were two pump ships (Soviet-made and imported after the Korean 
War), one equipped with a 490-hp engine and another with 11500-hp 
engine. The towboats were built by the Najin Shipyard around 
1957-or 1958, each one of them was a 30-ton job equipped with 
100-hp engine. There were 7 of them with numbers from 1,001 
through 1,007. About three dirt hauling boats were assigned to 
each dredger. The captains of tugboats were party members. . 
There were Aine regular crewmembers on the tugboat 
The 
working hours, as a rule, were 8-huur work in three shifts. Be-
cause of the shortage of personnel, a 6-man crew is working in 
two shifts now with a 30-minute orientation class held between 
shifts. 
The monthly norm for the 210-ton bucket dredger is 
5,000 cublo. meters. 
XII. Special Operations Vessels, Shipyards, and Coast Guard Unit 
1. Special Operations Boats (fast boats) 
At the military lase of Chtongjin's main port there were 
four 50-ton and one 100-ton camouflaged fishing boats believed 
to be for operational use. These ships were said to have been 
built at the Najin No. 28 Plant and above the deck of every one 
of these ships was of wooden structure for camouflage purpose 
(lower part is torpedo boat structure). All of these vessels 
were painted either white or gray, but they were constantly being 
repainted. Each of the 50-ton class vessel was said to have two 
100-hp engines and they were seen cruising in the port at a speed 
of 12 to 13 knots. Each had a removable heavy machine gun in 
the stern and was equipped with an antiaircraft machine gun in the 
bow which could be concealed in the hatch. The 100-ton boat was 
equipped with a 31600-hp engine and four screws. It cruised at 
an average speed of about 40 knots outside the port, but it was 
said it could make a maximum speed of 60 knots. 
Since the special operations boat moves in and out of the 
port mostly at night and its movements unscheduled, it is very 
difficult to find out what it, is really doing. One of the dis-
charged soldiers said that anyone working on this boat "must 
keep everything secret even to his wife when he receives orders." 
He said that once a certain crewmember carelessly told his wife 
"I shall come home in about a week" before leaving home. His 
wife told this to the wives in the neighborhood, and it so happened 
that her husbands superior found out about this. The result was 
that the boat was ordered to return to port with its mission un-
finished. The boat was scheduled to cross the 38th parallel.

Since the Crewmembers of this boat wear Army chevron, they 
must be Army personnel. 
2. Shipyards 
The shipyards in North Korea have no dock, so overhead 
method is being used. The shipyard in Najin called the No. 28 
Plant can build freighters up to 3,000 tons, but ordinarily it 
repairs steel vessels of about 200 tons. Its monthly repair 
capacity is 2,000 tons. 
The steel ship repair shop at Kimch'aek employs 400 to 500 
people. There is a shipyard in Ch'ongjin which builds mostly 
fishing vessels. It can build trawlers up to 400 tons, and 
it can build a Little more ships that the Najin shipyard. 
There is a shipyard in Wonsan which builds fishing 
vessels but the size is-not known. 
In Sinp'o there is a shipyard which specialized in repair-
ing fishing boats. It has the capacity of building ten 70 tons 
to 80 tons vessels a year and employs 200 workers. 
3. Coast Guard Unit 
Coast Guard Unit has been set up to control crimes committed 
on the high sea and is responsible to the Internal Affairs Bureau. 
Fishing vessels going out to fishing grounds carry weapons because 
of possible contact with South Korean fishing vessels. Each vessel 
carries , . at least one Coast Guard Unit member, who, in case 
cdemiergency, wolld take command of the anticipated fight. 
XIII. Repatriates from Japan  
1. Living condition and mental state  
The North Korean Government received the repatriates  
warmly in the early days of the repatriation program, but pro-
gressively growing cool toward them, it no treates repatriates  
no differently from other North Korean citizens. It still  
grants 20 wan each to newly arrived repatriates, but now allows  
only one week Before they are assigned to jobs. 
Almost all the repatriates find it difficult to make ends  
meet, as they had experienced better life in Japan and have no  
slid foundation in North Korea upon which to earn a stable liveli-
hood. Because they resort to selling goods and personal effects  
brought back from Japan to help meet expenses, their circumstances  
deteriorate rapidly. 
Moreover, the repatriates are not only barred from the  
munitions industry and other sensitive work but are ostracized  
by native Koreans, so nearly all of them feel harassed and regret  
having repatriated to North Korea. 
2. Exfiltration of repatriates from North Korea  
Disappointed with conditions in North Korea, most of the  
repatriates long to return to Japan. But not allowed to do so, 
some of the more desperate ones are seeking for an opportunity  
to smuggle out of the county; they are willing to go anywhere  
as long as they could get out of North Korea.

a. Two bachelor repatriates (names unknown) from Tokyo  
employed by the Ch'ongjin Steel Works escaped to the USSR by  
train in early 1961. They were arrested by the Soviet authorities  
and deported to North Korea after two months of detention. After  
40 days of detention and interrogation by the HamgyOng-pukto 
Internal Affairs Bureau, they were released and returned to their  
former jobs at the steel works. 
b. Yl In-su (2621/ntc/ntc), who repatriated from Tokyo 
with his mother and a younger sister (  Not clear whether 50X1-HUM 
singular or plural), was studying at the P'yongyang Drama-Motion  
Picture College, but during the spring vacation of 1962, he and  
five or six of his friends attempted to exfiltrate to the ROK.  
They were caught by the North Koreans near the DMZ and later sentenced  
to 17 years of penal servitude. 
c. A group of repatriates (names and number unknown) smuggled  
out to Communist China late 1962 but were caught by the Chinese  
and deported. Nothing is known about them since. 
d. A repatriate ran up the accommodation ladder of the  
departing repatriate ship to smuggle back to Japan, only to be  
arrested immediately. 
The North Korean Government, concerned about recurrence of  
exfiltration by repatriates and their repercussions on the piblic, 
strictly forbids circulation of rumors and accounts regarding  
escapes and deals harshly with those who were caught in the  
attempt. 
XIV. Miscellaneous Items  
1. Economic development 
The current progress of economic development and the 
future plans for emphasis on certain industry are frequently re-
ported in the Nodong Sinmun and explained at the indoctrination 
meetings, but whether these pronouncements merit credence is 
doubtful. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that North Korea is 
making a steady economic progress, as the workers, though 
reluctantly, are producing more, spurred on by the ch'ollima move-
ment. The people's standard of living, however, is not improving 
correspondingly because the main efforts are being diverted to 
armament.. 
2. Repatriates' attitude toward the North Korean Government  
A certain repatriate commented about the North Korean  
leaders to other repatriates: "They are sorely lacking in  
statesmanship: they bait workers with medals and titles, a method  
completely out of step with the trend of the times, in the atteut  
to arouse their will to work. They also require the people to  
submit blindly to the cult of individual. Their way is completely  
primitive!" 
3. Comments about the Chosen Soren by North Korean officials 
Apparently only the NK Officials  are aware of the existence of the 
Chosen Soren in Japan. Comments of officials 50X1-HUM 
a. The Chosen Soren is doing a tremendous job of letting 
the Free World, particularly Japan, know about the significance

machinery, optical instruments, precision tools and instruments, 
and other needed items to North Korea. A considerable number of 
North Korean railway stations was without watches a few years ago, 
but all the stations now have them because watches were brought 
back in large quantities by the repatriates. 
4. Public reaction to the campaign for unrestricted travel 
between Japan and North Korea. 
The North Korean Government has repeatedly announced its 
support of the campaign for unrestricted travel between Japan and 
North Korea, but the general public shows very little interest 
because the Government speaks of the freedom of the Korean nationals 
in Japan to visit North Korea but makes no mention of the North 
Korean citizens' visit of Japan. The repatriates would naturally 
welcome the lifting of the ban on travel to Japan, but, resigned 
to the likelihood that the North Korean Government would allow 
only a select few to visit Japan in the fear that the hard internal 
conditions would become known to the outside world. They show 
no enthusiasm for the drive even if the Japanese were to approve 
unrestricted travel.? 
5. Sino-Soviet rivalry 
The North Korean Government has publicly criticized that 
"the Soviet Union and some eastern European countries, in contra-
vention to the Marxist-Leninist doctrines, have yielded to the 
imperialists" and made known it support for Communist China in the 
Sino-Soviet confrontation. The danger of revisionism playing into 
the imperialists' hands is stressed at indoctrination meetings, 
but the average citizen, having only a vague notion of what 
revisionism is because no one bothers to explain it to him in 
details, merely believes what he hears about it.

XV. Repatriates from Countries Other than Japan  
Koreans who repatriated to North Korea from the Soviet Union 
and Communist China number several times over those 
from Japan. The observations of these repatriates 
are as follows: 
a. Repatriates from USSR 
who repatriated 
50X1 -HUM 
Repatriates from the Soviet Union reach a considerable 
number; they include not only pre-1945 residents of USSR but those 
who had gone there in recent years to work as lumberjacks and 
fishermen. The trafficking of these lumberjacks and fishermen 
is considerable, and  the lumberjacks work50X1-HUM 
in the forests in the interior of Vladivostok and fishermen in 
Sakhalin, all under a three-year contract, and that most of them 
go on their own volition but some are sent willy-nilly. 
these contract workers live 50X1-HUM 
better in Siberia and Sakhalin than in North Korea and noticed 
that they are envied by others because they return with watches, 
sewing machines, radios, and other items which are unavailable 
to other North Korean.workers. 
b. Repatriates from Communist China 
Most of the repatriates from Communist China are pre-
1945 residents of that country, and many were farmers and coal 
miners. They apparently repatriated to escape hard life, for most 
of them, unlilw the returnees from USSR, came back with hardly 
anything more than the clothes on their backs. Yet, some of them 
apparently chose to go back to Communist China again to work, saying 
privately that the food situation is worse there but they are 
happier. 
c. Other information 
50X1 -HUM 
Repatriates from the Soviet Union say that some North 
Koreans defect to the Soviet Union. They first smuggle across the 
border into Communist China and then escape to USSR through mountains 
along the Sino-Soviet border. 
The Chinese Communists are supposed to arrest, detain, 
and deport border jumpers from North Korea and the North Koreans 
are to reciprocate, but in practice the latter do not punish or 
deport Koreans who escape from Communist China. Some several 50X1-HUM 
tens of thousands of Koreans crossed the border and returned to 
North Korea in the summer of 1962 owing to a disaster (  Presumably 
a crop failure resulting from a natural calamity), but none of them 
were punished. 
Also, a Korean national who was shot in his leg by the 
Chinese border guard in mid-August 1962 while escaping was receiving

Those who jumped the Sino-Soviet border were apparently 
arrested and deported to their native country in the past, but 
a rumor circulated in North Korea from about late 1962 that escapees 
would be summarily shot seems to have completely discouraged use 
of that route to escape from North Korea.

KIM Il-sOng attacked the Soviet Union, particularly 
Khrushchev, in his New Year speech and called for strengthening 
of the national defense. 
Personal history of individuals, particularly members 
of the low-echelon Party organizations, were checked. 
Instructors from the Party headquarters began conducting 
orientation courses on modern revisionism. 
c. Others 
A thoroughgoing drive was waged to confiscate any 
and all Soviet publications. 
All organizations began endeavors to bolster the 
national defense. 
February to March 1963: 
a. Press and radio 
Much effort began to be devoted to propagandize the 
reconstruction of Communist China. 
Attack on revisionism was shifted to denunciation of 
Khrushchev. Pictures of Soviet students dancing were printed. 
b. Government actions 
More and more personnel were shifted as the result of 
the earlier checks on personal history. 
c. Others 
Indoctrination efforts devoted to attacks on the Soviet 
Union were stepped up. 
Endeavors were made to thoroughly enlighten the public 
about modern revisionism. 
April 1963 onward: 
a. Press and radio 
All-out condemnation of Khrushchev gotten underway. 
Disparaging reports about the Soviet Union printed and 
broadcasted. 
Reports about Communist China increased. 
b. Government actions 
Class indoctrination begun (TN: Refer to later paragraphs). 
c. Others 
Propaganda emphasizes that Communist China is the correct 
side in the Sino-Soviet dispute. 
2. Investigation of personal history 
The investigation of personal history commenced in January 
1963 was directed mainly at Party members who are serving as enter-
prise officials. Those who made false entries into their personal 
history statements were transferred to other jobs, and students who 
falsified their personal history statements were expelled from school.

of workers, but the investigation disclosed that roughly 25 percent 
of them were from farm families. 
50X1-HUM 
Repatriates who have relatives in South Korea serving as 
government officials ( Presumably military included) or in  
Japan working as Mindan officials were likewise disciplined ( 
presumably the repatriates who failed to mention about these   
50X1-HUM 
relatives were disciplined). 
3. Modern revisionism 
The propaganda and indoctrination call Khrushchev's modern 
revisionism "appeasement of the capitalists and imperialists by 
the socialists countries." They attack the Soviet Premier for 
having sold warplanes to India during the Sino-Soviet border war, 
denouncing it as a Soviet act of unarmed aggression against 
Communist China; they accuse him of having interfered with inde-
pendence of Cuba when he removed the missiles from the island 
country under the American threat of nuclear retaliation; they 
denounce him for having concluded a 20-year non-aggression pact 
with the Americans for the fear of the latter and call the move a 
defeat for the proletariats. Modern revisionism, they tell the 
people, stands for personal gains at the expense of other socialist 
countries and establishing dictatorial control over the latter 
countries. 
4. Class indoctrination 
a. Objective 
The objective of class indoctrination is to brainwash 
the people into acquiring correct appreciation of the present state 
of the proletarian class. 
b. Organization 
Indoctrination is conducted by different organizations 
(usually the Korean Democratic Youths League for those less than 
30 years old and the Korean Federation of Workers Unions for those 
30 years old or over) with the officials who attended the courses 
at their respective central headquarters taking charge. It is con-
ducted in groups of 20 to 30 persons each. 
c. Methods 
The time and place for indoctrination are designated 
by the respective league or federation organizations each time. 
The indoctrination is conducted daily for two hours after work or 
school except on Sundays and Tuesdays, which are reserved for 50X1-HUM 
militia training to bolster the national defense. (  Militia 
training is conducted every Tuesdays but the groups showing poor 
results are required to train on Sundays, too.) Two or three days 
each week is devoted to study on the basis of the book entitled, 
"Class Indoctrination" (Kyeklip Kyoyang), and the remaining two or 
three days to discussions, after which weekly examination is given. 
The book is not available to group members, so they listen to the 
instructor's lecture and take notes. The examinations is conducted 
both orally and in writing, but if anyone in a group should fail to 
make the grade, the entire group is required to repeat the lesson 
until everyone passes the examination. The notes are subjected to 
inspection, and anyone with a torn or damaged page is punished as a 
thought offender. 
d. Indoctrination subjects

particularly exploitation of workers by the 
capitalists. NOFOREIGNOISSEM

(2) The origin of capitalism and the history of 
development from slavery to socialist revolution. 
(3) Comparison of life under capitalism and communism. 
(4) Criticism of Khrushchev's modern revisionism. 
Examples of criticisms directed at Khrushchev are: 
he uses modern revisionism to establish his 
dictatorship; he exhumed Stalin from his grave and 
disposed of the remains; because Khrushchev im-
ported dancing and the strip tease to USSR after 
watching them during his tour of the United States, 
the Soviet youths and students have become corrupt 
and now indulge in lewd passtimes; Communist China 
is the correct side in the Sino-Soviet dispute, 
and Communist China possesses atomic bombs and is 
now the most powerful country in the world. 
50X1-HUM 
(5) The workers and students are told that they must 
endure austerity in order to build up the national 
defense for peace and must have faith in order to  
accomplish that goal. 
5. Public Attitude 
Subjected to exhaustive class indoctrination, the North 
Korean people believe that KIM Il-song is a very trustworthy leader 
who guides the nation on a proper course of supporting the Chinese 
Communists in the Sino-Soviet dispute.  50X1-HUM 
Some inwardly resent the class indoctrination as vigor with 
which it is conducted is far out in proportion with other indoctri-
nation efforts, but they participate because they feel that they 
have no choice but to obey the will of the authorities. 
_XVII. Premier KIM Il-sOng  
50X1-HUM 
KIM Il-sOng is almost deified and the public blindly believe 
that they are told about him. However, some intellectuals among 
Korean Labor Party members are privately critical about dictatorial 
methods ("Robot") of KIM Il-sOng, and CHTOE  Yong-kOn (1508/1661/ 
0256) and PAK Se-ch'01 (2613/0013/0772) ( Presumably misprint 
of PAK KOm-ch'01 /1613/6855/08117) are gaining popularity among the 
North Korean public since about two years ago. The reason for the

shift in popularity is that CH'OE Yong-kOn is frequently mentioned 
in the press because he is in charge of talks and dealing with 
foreign countries (-1 It is not clear whether PAK Se-ch' 01 150X1-HUM 
gaining popularity also because he is frequently mentioned in the 
press). The two (CH'OE and PAK) are deemed by the public to be 
successor to KIM Il-sOng, but the common talks speculate in faunr 
of PAK Se-ch'01 Sic). 50X1-HUM 
Another reason for rising popularity of CH'OE Yong-kOn and 
declining popularity of KIM Il-song since about late 1962 is the 
banishment of HAN S01-chi (7281/7185/0037)1-7 Presumably mi:50X1-HUM 
of HAN S01-ya /7281/7185/68517), the foremost writer of North Korea, 
to a coal mine. HAN wrote a book entitled, "KIM Il-ng," but he 
was arrested by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (  Presuma50X1 -HUM 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs here and elsewhere in this report 
means the Ministry of Social Security) because its entire contents 
were based on the theme that KIM Il-sging and his group alone re-
built North Korea. The news of his arrest was never printed but 
was circulated by rumors and came as a considerable shock to the 
public. 
?XVID; Armed Forces of North Korea: Conscription System, Ranks and Grades, 
Equiptent, and Training. 
1. Conscription system 
The Korean People's Armed Forces, comprised of the Army, 
the Navy, and the Air Force, recruits its personnel under the 
conscription system. Young men and women are summoned from the 
county military affairs department for physical examination when 
they reach the age of 17 or 18. Repatriates (-7 Presumably 50X1-HUM 
repatriates from Japan) are not drafted apparently for security 
reasons: some repatriates volunteered for military service but 
were turned down. 
Military men belong to a privileged class in North Korea. 
They are not only better treated than workers but are given 
priority in job selection after discharge. 
2. Military ranks and grades 
The components of the People's Armed Forces No 50X1-HUM 
distinction in the three services is made in the original document) 
are corps, divisions, regiments, battalions, companies, and 
platoons. 
Its ranks and grades, starting from the bottom are:

men, but in practice they apparently serve close to seven. Their 
training not only emphasize military skills but political indoctri-
nation as well. They are repeatedly reminded to always be prepared 
for a national emergency because Korea is under a constant threat 
of war. They undergo platoon training daily, company training 
each week, battalion training each month, and a large-scale 
maneuver each year with divisions and corps with the Navy and the 
Air Force units participating. 
Work levied on servicemen is limited to digging trenches, 
building roads and bridges, and other work linked directly with 
military needs.

- -5MT Strengthening of National Defense  
1. General  
The Korean Labor Party Central Committee in December 1962, 
decided to strengthen the national defense, and simultaneously  
with making public of the new of Sino-Soviet rivalry in the latter  
part of the same month, the press and radio launched a vigorous  
propaganda drive for the national defense. The defense need was  
also stressed at the political indoctrination classes at the  
places of employment and schools at the same time. And the New  
Year speech by Premier KIM Il-sOng calling for redoubled defense  
efforts drove home to the public the urgency the Government attaches  
to boosting the defense of the country. 
The North Korean Government justified the increased defense  
efforts by pointing out that the country is confronted with the  
American imperialists across the DMZ, that the Soviet Union is  
orienting herself completely in revisionism under dictatorial  
control of Khrushchev, and that therefore, North Korea must  
strengthen her national defense to rebuild and defend herself un-
assisted. What added military preparations are in progress is not

known, but the country's adoption of a posture akin to a wartime  
footing is being impressed upon the people, what with an expanded  
conscription system, strengthening of the militia, and tightened  
food rationing. 
2. Expanded conscription system  
Men are being drafted into military service at an accele-
rated pace since the beginning of 1963, and the draft age, which  
was 18 through 26, had apparently been extended by two or three  
years. 
Moreover, the students in the professional schools, not  
often drafted before, came to be pressed into military service in  
increasing numbers, and so more and more schools are being closed  
and merged. At the Najin Maritime Training School, for example,  
an average of one student a month from each class was drafted up  
to the end of 1962, but the recruitment, with exception of the  
navigation students, was increased five-fold from January 1963. 
The enrollment in its engineering course was 45 at the onset, 
but only 11 remained by the 1963 graduation. 
50X1 -HUM 
In Najin alone, attrition of students resulted in closing  
of the medical college, the business college, ana the fisheries  
trainin: school. Now the Na'in Maritime Trainin: School is the 
only fisheries training school sic. Presumabl Source means  
that the functions of the fisheries training school were absorbed  
by the Najin Maritime Training School and that the latter is now  
the only institution in North Korea where courses in fisheries are  
offered.) 
Out of the population of 50,000 in Najin-gun, 5,000 (20  
percent of them women were drafted during the first two months  
of 1963.

"excellent", 15 to 20 points "good", and below 
15 points "fair." The first two were passing 
grades, but the students with a fair grade 
were not eligible to graduate from the school. 
The recipients of 21 points or over were made 
to fire 25 rounds with a submachine gun. 
Normally many students fail to attain a passing 
grade in firing, but since such a poor showing 
is considered a reflection on the instructors, 
everyone is given at least a "good." 
50X1-HUM 
An unannounced practice mobilization of militia 
was conducted once 
The code word for enemy invasion 
was "Thunder." 50X1-HUM 
f. Duty assignments 
A number of militiamen picked from enterprises guard 
the coast, newspaper plants, radio stations, government buildings, 
and uninhabited areas during the hours of darkness under order 
from the military. These militiamen carry full combat gear and are 
issued ball cartridges. 
The militiamen guarding the coast are dressed identically 
with regular troops and cover the gaps in coastal vigilance by the 
regulars. These militiamen are on guard duty half of the month 
and work at their respective jobs during the other half, but the 
Source is not knowledgeable about other details. 
g. Treatment 
Militiamen are not accorded preferential treatment. Even 
when they were called out for night duty, they are required to appear 
for work next morning. Inwardly discontended with the extra burden, 
yet many are burning with desire to defend the fatherland as the 
propaganda constantly keeps alive the fear of invasion from South --

Gasoline Supply, 
f' 
Since North Korean does not produce 
petroleum 
50X1-HUM 
oil, she had been importing  
from the  
Soviet Union and Communist China. However, the Russians, at the  
North Ebrean-Soviet meeting held last year, demanded exorbitant  
prices for the petroleum, so the North Koreans replied that they  
would be unable to pay such- high prices. It is said that the 50X1-HUM 
Chinese Communists learned about it and advised the North Koreans  
not to thenceforth accept even a drop of Soviet oil in aid (   
176gUMWEly the indignant Chinese promised to supply all the future  
need for petroleum in Korth Korea) and assured the Koreans that  
they would pay the Soviets for all the debt the North Koreans  
incurred in petroleum importation from 'USSR. At any rate, oil  
transportation from the Soviet Union ceased since about summer of  
1962 and importation from Communist China is on the increase. 
North Korea has one small oil refinery at a place called Aoji  
(TN: Romaji transliteration of the original kana), located near  
the OnsOng (3306/1004) coal mine. It is said that the plan is to  
develop the area into a huge petroleum industry complex. 
The petroleum imported by rail is distributed to gasoline  
stations operated by provinces and cities and made available only  
for motor vehicles operated in connection with work, In the early  
days of repatriation, petroleum was available for the sedans and  
motorcycles the repatriates brought back from Japan, but it is only  
ra lone o eir no orcyc es lately. The Ministry of Internal  
Affairs is now compelling the repatriates to sell even their motor-
cycles to the Ministry ( Presumably the repatriates were a15axi -HUM 
ready forced to sell their sedans to the Ministry).

XXIII. .Sanitary Conditions in North Korea  
? 
General  
1. The sanitary conditions in North Korea are poor. Bed-
bugs and flies abound, and lice infest workers and Party members 
alike. Bedbugs are found everywhere with the exception of re-
inforced concrete apartments and flies are evident everywhere 
except at the stores on the main streets. 
2. Other than high-class apartments in category I cities, 
apartment dwellers share kitchen and toilet facilities with 
other dwellers, they use water stored in containers, and they 
do not have garbage cans or a sewage disposal system. Apart-
ment dwellers dispose of their garbage and trash by digging 
a hole near-by and sharing it as a dump, Other people simply 
throw away their garbage and trash in a vacant lot or dump it 
in the river. They dispose of sewage in the same manner; some 
rural communities do not even have toilets. 
3. Toilet facilities at parks, halls, and other public 
places are very limited; vacant lots back of stores or apartment 
buildings are filthy. 
Government Sanitation Measures  
4. The North Korean Government, in the Cabinet Order No. 20, 
requires extermination of flies and bedbugs. The Government has 
established a sanitation week twice a year, once in the spring 
and again in the autumn, and the province and country sanitation 
week comes every two months. During these weeks, students attend 
classes only half of the regular hours and spend the rest in 
sanitation drive, and the workers perform thoroughgoing cleaning-
up after work. Everyone must carry a fly swatter during these 
weeks and swat 30 to 50 flies daily. He or she takes the required 
number of dead flies to the office handling local sanitation 
affairs to receive a stamp of acknowledgment; failure to do so would 
cause forfeit the privilege of going out of the quarters. A 
restaurant in which a fly is found during the week is fined. 
5. Communities other than the category I cities like P'yongyang 
and Ch'ongjin do not even have a garbage department or garbage 
trucks. They collect garbage with man-drawn carts. 
6. Because of the shortage of insecticides and other chemicals, 
flies and other noxious insects multiply rapidly as soon as the 
sanitation week is over. 
7. In case of a flu epidemic, only a limited number of people 
are inoculated; the others are confined to their general areas to 
prevent spread of the disease. 
Public Concern  
8. Not that the people are unconcerned about sanitation, but 
there is not much they can do because needed chemicals, soap, and 
other supplies are scarce. Public bath houses are few and 
expensive (.25 von for admission), so ordinary workers could afford 
to take a bath only once or twice a month. They are so pre-
occupied with making ends meet that they could not be worried about 
sanitation.
