 Communist China's international relations reach well beyond its
 official representation abroad, and numerous devices have been utilized
 to extend these relations.  In addition to diplomatic representation ex-
 changed with 11 Sino-Soviet bloc nations, official recognition exists
 as of the date of this compilation with Yugoslavia and 17 other nations.
 Israel announced recognition of Communist China in January 1950, but
 Communist China has never reciprocated.  In addition, trade delegations
 have been established on a permanent basis in at least 9 of these 30
 countries.  Trade and cultural agreements have been entered into with
 all the Sino-Soviet bloc nations and with at least 10 of the other na-
 tions with which official representation has been established, most of
 these on a government-to-government basis.
 This compilation indicates in Part I the location of Chinese Com-
 munist diplomatic representations and the names of ambassadors, ministers,
 and consuls, as appropriate.  It also names the cultural attaches or
 counsellors whose dual tasks seem to be the development of Chinese Com-
 munist influence in and control over the overseas Chinese communities,
 and the expansion of cultural exchanges between their country of assign-
 ment and Communist China.
 Part II lists the commercial attaches and counsellors at the various
 diplomatic installations who, along with the official permanent trade
 representatives, seek to expand trade between Communist China and the
 areas in which they are assigned.  Key figures in the Ministry of Foreign
 Trade of the Chinese (Communist) People's Government, and in the national
 corporations, the China National Import and Export Corporation, and China
 Resources Company are also named.  Officials of the China Committee for
 Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) are also included since this
 committee is an official front organization which sponsors trade delega-
 tion exchanges with non-Communist countries.
 Other official organs of the Chinese Communist government which
 extend into areas outside the mainland and play a part in that government's
 international relations, which are covered under Part III, are:  The Bank
 of China and other Chinese Communist-controlled banks, the China Travel
 Service, the New China News Agency, the China Insurance Company, the Min
 An Insurance Company, and the international operations of the Civil Avia-
 tion Administration, all under control from Peking.
 Participation in the many international Communist front organiza-
 tions is covered in Part IV which lists those known to be active in this
 regard and through such activities to be in cofitact with representatives
 of Communist parties throughout the world.

 A separate portion, Part V, of this study is concerned with the
 Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Coun-
 tries (AcRFc) and the cultural offensive it has conducted, particularly
 in concert with the China friendship associations internal to Communist
 China and those in other nations.
 The final section, Part VI, is devoted to a summary report on the
 interchange of delegations with non-Communist countries, with particular
 emphasis on the travel of Communist Chinese delegations to these coun-
 tries in 1955 and 1956.
 It is to be emphasized that this compilation covers the highlights
 of Communist China's relations with foreign countries and the more im-
 portant representatives in and to these countries acting officially for
 the CPG, CCP, or organs under their direction and control.  These offi-
 cial representatives in many cases are stationed outside China but are
 not to be considered among that body of persons generally referred to as
 "Overseas Chinese."  Strenuous efforts have been made since 19+9 by the
 Chinese Communists to gain influence and control over the some 1+,900,000
 Chinese residing outside the China mainland.  One of the principal ef-
 forts of some of the official representatives in foreign countries, par-
 ticularly the diplomatic installations and their cultural counsellors and
 attaches, is directed at winning the loyalty to Communist China of these
 Chinese overseas, maintaining a flow of remittances from them to the
 China mainland, and fostering the return to Communist China of foreign-
 trained Chinese technicians who are so badly needed in that country.  The
 subject of the Chinese overseas is a separate one and is not dealt with
 as such in this compilation.
 At the end of the text of this compilation will be found:
 a.  Appendix A, a listing of the abbreviations used in the
 text and the organizations for which they are adopted.
 b.  Appendix B, an alphabetical tabulation of Chinese named
 (non-Chinese are not included).
 The alphabetical tabulation is not to be considered as providing
 full biographical data on the persons named.  For the most part it in-
 dicates only their connections in a leadership capacity with the or-
 ganizations and activities with which this compilation is concerned.
 In a few instances the connections of individuals with Chinese Commu-
 nist Party or Chinese People's Government organs have been included.
 Members of the executive or central committees of the various non-Com-
 munist political parties, All China federations, and domestic front or-
 ganizations appear only when such membership occurs incidental to list-
 ing of the names, for other reasons, within the scope of this paper.

 Use of the alphabetical tabulation in conjunction with the list of
 abbreviated organizational titles will facilitate its usefulness.  For
 example, the list of abbreviations (Appendix A) shows WPC as the code
 used for the World Peace Council, whose Chinese Communist leaders are
 named on page 42 of Part IV.  Reference to this page shows the name KUO
 Mo-jo.  In the alphabetical listing (Appendix B) his connections with
 other organizations, particularly those covered in the text, will be
 noted.  Although some of the organizations coded after KU0's name are
 not covered in this compilation (CPC - China Peace Committee; ACFSS -
 All China Federation of Scientific Societies), the identity of these
 organizations may be determined from Appendix A, the list of abbrevia-
 tions, and the scope of KU0's participation in non-CCP, non-government
 activities will be indicated.   It should be understood that the organiza-
 tions shown after each name represent only those more important ones
 with which the individual is known to be associated.
 Reference to the Table of Contents, Part VI, will indicate that
 delegations to and from non-Communist countries have been broken down
 into 14 basic categories.   In Appendix B, the alphabetized list of
 names, it will be noted, for example, that the data on LIU Ning-i in-
 cludes a reference "see Part VI, Trade Unions and Peace Groups."  This
 indicates that LIU Ning-i is named in these two sections of Part VI.
 It should be clearly understood that Part VI does not include all dele-
 gations to and from non-Communist countries but only represents a small
 cross section of the total number of persons travelling to and from
 these countries since 1 January 1955.  The Chinese Communist press claimed
 that in this two-year period more than 11,000 persons travelled from
 Communist China to 49 non-Communist nations, while more than 10,000 per-
 sons from 75 non-Communist countries visited Communist China in delega-
 tions or as individuals.  Those delegations listed in Part VI, therefore,
 are only a small sampling of the total exchanges of delegations.

 Listed below are the countries with which Communist China has diplo-
 matic relations, including the consulates in these countries, together
 with the names of its ambassadors, consuls, and cultural attaches or
 counsellors.
 Cultural attaches are included in the list since they appear to be
 principally responsible for stimulating cultural exchanges between Com-
 munist China and countries in areas where they are located.   The cultural
 attaches also appear to be responsible for maintaining contact with the
 Chinese communities overseas and the formation and activities of the China
 friendship associations.

 Since the very nature of its operations and functions call for the
 Ministry of Foreign Trade to maintain frequent contact with areas outside
 of Communist China through permanent representatives in both Sino-Soviet
 Bloc countries and non-Communist nations, a brief resume of the Ministry
 and the organization built to foster and conduct foreign trade follows.
 Because the foreign trade of Communist China is a state-controlled
 monopoly, those traveling outside the China mainland for that purpose,
 those serving as commercial or trade counsellors of diplomatic installa-
 tions abroad, and those who are part of established trade representatives'
 offices, are acting officially for the Chinese Communist Government.  A
 large number of the trade representatives of the CPG who are stationed
 abroad or travel outside Communist China have been identified in this
 section and in Part VI.
 It appears that, in general, transfer of funds and credits with Sino-
 Soviet Bloc nations in connection with their trade relations is handled
 direct from Peking through the People's Bank of China, while funding of
 trade with Southeast Asia and non-Communist countries is effected at least
 in part through the branches of the Bank of China outside of Communist
 China, particularly the branches in Hong Kong and London.  The Bank of
 China's activities abroad are covered in Part III of this paper.
 Channels for trade relations are available through trade and commer-
 cial counsellors of Chinese Communist diplomatic installations and through
 permanent trade representatives who have set up offices in a number of
 non-Communist countries including East Germany, Italy, Egypt, India, Leb-
 anon, and Syria.  Virtually all the trade between Communist China and the
 Sino-Soviet Bloc countries is carried out on a government-to-government
 basis, under annual trade agreements negotiated by the Ministers of Foreign
 Trade of the respective countries.
 In addition, trade agreements have been negotiated with some of the
 non-Communist countries with which Communist China maintains diplomatic
 relations.  Among those with which such trade treaties have been arranged
 are:  the USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Albania, Yugoslavia,
 Burma, North Korea, Mongolian People's Republic, India, Pakistan, Afghan-
 istan, Indonesia, Ceylon, Cambodia, Egypt, and Syria.   The Chinese Commu-
 nists send observers to the meetings of the Soviet Bloc Council of Eco-
 nomic Mutual Assistance (CEMA).

 Only the highlights of the Chinese Communist trade activities abroad
 are included in this section, and, although many other persons connected
 with each installation or organization are known, for example the large
 trade missions in Egypt, East Germany, Cambodia and elsewhere, only the

 The Ministry of Foreign Trade is one of 39 ministries and commissions
 under the State Council of the Chinese People's Government (CPG).  YEH
 Chi-chuang is Minister.  There are 8 Vice Ministers and 4 Assistants to
 the Minister.  Under the Ministry there are at least 14 bureaus .and de-
 partments including a Bureau of Import, Bureau of Export, and a Protocol
 Department.  Under the direction of the Ministry of Foreign Trade there
 are a number of "national" (state-owned) import and export corporations
 broken down by general types of raw materials and commodities imported
 and exported by Communist China.  The principal national corporations,
 head offices of which in each instance are in Peking with branches of
 most of them in Shanghai, Tientsin, Tsingtao, and Canton, are included
 herein along with their key officials.
 As is the case in all Communist-controlled countries, the bulk of the
 foreign trade of Communist China is centrally controlled by government
 organs, and major transactions with customers and suppliers are handled
 through government channels.
 Radio Peking claimed that by the end of 1956 Communist China had es-
 tablished trade relations with 68 countries and had concluded trade agree-
 ments with the governments of 21 nations other than those of the Sino-
 Soviet Bloc.

 CHINA NATIONAL CORPORATIONS
 An office of the China National Import and Export Corporation (CNIEC)
 was established in East Berlin several years ago to deal with non-Commu-
 nist countries in Europe prior to inauguration of exchanges of trade dele-
 gations.                             CNIEC acted as sole importer of goods from these countries.  The
 Berlin office was reported by the East German press to have closed on 14
 October 1956.   It was to be reopened in Bern, Switzerland; it is possible
 this office may have been discontinued, or the commercial counsellor of
 the embassy in Bern may have assumed the responsibility for purchasing in
 Europe.      Transactions are now often handled by trade delegations directly
 representing the various national corporations.   This may result in a
 change in the over-all role of the CNIEC.

 CHINA RESOURCES COMPANY (HUA JUN COMPANY) (CREC), HONG KONG
 A substantial portion of the sale and purchase of commodities of and
 for Communist China is handled through the China Resources Company (CREC).
 Located in Hong Kong, this is an official CPG organization, and a part of
 the national corporation structure under direction of the Ministry of
 Foreign Trade.  The CREC's principal activities have been in trade with
 Southeast Asia, but it has also consummated transactions with private
 business firms in the Near East, Europe, Japan, and Africa, and has at
 least conducted negotiations with firms in the Western Hemisphere.  As
 originally set up, the CREC activities seemed to have been controlled by
 the Ministry of Foreign Trade through the China National Import and Export
 Corporation, acting on behalf of the various other national corporations.
 Now that the national corporations have been sending their representatives
 to non-Communist countries to deal directly with private suppliers and
 buyers, the role of the CREC seems to have been somewhat reduced.  There
 are, of course, numerous private firms in Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore,
 and throughout Southeast Asia, which are owned by Chinese Communists or
 sympathizers, and these have been favored in dealing with the China Re-
 sources Company.  No attempt will be made to enumerate these private
 firms, many of which have close connections with the Bank of China branches
 in their areas, or with the trade and commercial counsellors of the Chinese
 ,Communist diplomatic installations.  Representatives of CREC have made
 trips to Europe, Latin America, and the Near East.
 CREC, through the foreign trade organizations, apparently also assists
 persons from non-Communist countries to obtain permits for travel to the
 China mainland, and deals with the Hong Kong authorities in obtaining per-
 mits to export various goods to Communist China.
 From what is known of the CREC's activities, it appears to act as
 agent for certain products of the several national corporations in Com-
 munist China.  Acting as principals, the national corporations deal through
 agents other than CREC for certain products.  While agents other than CREC

 handle certain products in Hong Kong and the Southeast Asia market, the
 agency for the same products in other areas may be the CREC.  Agency ar-
 rangements seem to be made directly between the national corporations and
 firms in Singapore, Malaya, Bangkok, and other places in Southeast Asia,
 without going through the CREC.

 CHINA COMMITTEE FOR THE PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE (CCPIT)
 The China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade is a
 front organ employed to invite non-Communist businessmen to the mainland
 and to organize trade delegations and representations for international
 fairs and exhibits in non-Communist countries.   This "unofficial" organ
 is described in one Chinese Communist publication as the "agency of the
 China national corporations in Hong Kong" and has sent representatives
 abroad to Europe and Latin America.  The CCPIT and its representatives
 appear to act to stimulate and encourage trade, but actual transactions
 usually are consummated by officials of the CPG either subsequent to CCPIT
 preparations or as members of the CCPIT-sponsored delegations.  As in the
 case of other Chinese Communist delegations, those sponsored by the CCPIT
 have been known to provide a vehicle for political and propaganda activi-
 ties in the countries visited.
 Trade delegations from non-Communist countries are almost always
 handled under the sponsorship of the CCPIT jointly with the All China
 Federation of Industry and Commerce Associations, and include tending to
 itineraries, planning meetings, visiting factories, and other points of
 interest; arranging talks with government officials, as appropriate; and
 providing entertainment and gifts.   Upon completion of their visits trade
 delegations frequently issue joint declarations with the CCPIT calling
 for further exchange of delegations, widening of trade between the two
 countries, and propounding the propaganda line concerning the growth of
 Communist China's industry and resources.
 Officials of the CCPIT are:
 Chairman                             NAN Han-ch'en
 Vice Chairmen                           CHI Chao-ting

 The term "official" as used in regard to the Bank of China, New
 China News Agency, and Civil Aviation Bureau can be interpreted literally
 in the sense that these organizations are special agencies under the CPG
 State Council. The close affiliation of the Bank of Communications, other
 banks in Hong Kong named herein, the China Insurance Company, Min An In-
 surance Company, and China Travel Service, with the Bank of China, and the
 fact that the head offices of these concerns are in Communist China, lead
 to the logical assumption that, although they ostensibly are private busi-
 ness firms, their activities conform to Chinese Communist direction and
 policy, and can thus be said for all intents and purposes to be official.
 In addition to the organizations covered in this section, there is a
 still larger group of Chinese Communist state-owned or semi-state-owned
 business firms acting as official agencies on behalf of the Chinese Com-
 munist government within their several spheres of activity.  Examples of
 such enterprises in Hong Kong are the Andar Corporation, the China Mer-
 chants Steam Navigation Company and the Apollo Bookshop and Publishing
 Company.  There are, in addition, many ostensibly privately-owned, small
 business firms in Hong Kong, Macao, and throughout Southeast Asia owned
 by Chinese who do business with Communist China, and whose facilities are
 available not only for legitimate business transactions but also are used
 for political propaganda and other activities.
 The purpose of this compilation is to illustrate the breadth of of-
 ficial Chinese Communist contacts with non-Communist as well as Communist
 nations and not to explore each organization in depth.  Thus only the
 highlights of the activities of each organization are included and, even
 though many other persons connected with each organization are known, only
 the leaders, where identified, are shown.
 This is the chief overseas organ of the People's Bank of China, which
 is one of the agencies under the State Council.   It comes under the gen-
 eral cognizance of the Ministry of Finance of the government, and the
 Fifth Staff Office (Finance and Trade) of the State Council.  LI Hsien-
 nien concurrently holds the office of Minister of Finance and director of
 the Fifth Staff Office of the State Council.  TSOU Chu-ju is president of
 the People's Bank of China; the general manager is KUNG Yin-ping.  Under
 the People's Bank of China there is a Foreign Operations Administration
 of which CH'IAO P'ei-hsin is director and CHIN Yen is deputy.  CH'IAO
 P'ei-hsin is general manager of the Bank of China.  CHI Ch'ao-ting has
 been referred to as assistant general manager of the Bank of China and is

 a member of the CCPIT.  NAN Han-ch'en is"chairman of the board.  HSIANG
 K'o-fang is superintendent of foreign branches.  CHAN Wu is also an as-
 sistant manager of the Bank of China in Peking.
 There are branches of the Chinese Communist Bank of China in London,
 Hong Kong, Karachi, Rangoon, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Chittagong,
 Calcutta, Bombay, Djakarta, Medan, and Surabaya.
 Branches of the Chinese Nationalist Bank of China are located in the
 Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Cuba, and in several other areas which
 maintain relations with Nationalist China and are not to be confused with
 the Chinese Communist-controlled banks.   In Hong Kong and Macao there are
 a number of banks controlled by the Chinese Communists which appear to be
 under some form of joint administration under the overall direction of
 personnel assigned to Hong Kong by the Chinese Communists and attached to
 the Bank of China branch in that city.
 In addition to maintaining close relations with and handling funds
 for the Chinese Communist diplomatic installations wherever they are es-
 tablished, the Communist Bank of China branches handle remittances from
 Chinese overseas being sent to the China mainland, and provide foreign
 exchange and finance foreign trade transactions, as well as making loans
 to local Chinese business firms.  All banking business with most areas
 other than Southeast Asia is probably supervised through the branch in
 Hong Kong.  The branch in Singapore appears to handle matters concern-
 ing Singapore, Malaya, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and elsewhere in
 Southeast Asia, and to have over-all supervision over other branches
 of the Bank of China in these areas.  Where no diplomatic installations
 exist, the Bank of China branches appear to look after the interests
 of the Chinese Communist government in general.  The Economic Research
 Departments of the various branches probably are concerned with the
 collection and transmittal to Peking of overt economic information, as-
 sisting in promotion of foreign trade and conducting trade exhibits.
 Certain branches of the Communist Bank of China also arrange for the
 travel of Overseas Chinese to China, organize trade and other delega-
 tions going to China, and handle arrangements for shipments of goods.

 OTHER CHINESE COMMUNIST BANKS OUTSIDE CHINA
 In addition to the branches of the Bank of China there are a number
 of other banks outside of the China mainland which are controlled by the
 Chinese Communists and which perform certain functions, under supervision
 of persons who are sent there for the purpose by the Chinese Communist
 Government.   In some cases the control is probably through diplomatic per-
 sonnel in the embassies or consulates of the CPG.   In other cases it may
 be through persons officially attached to the Bank of China branches.   In
 some instances it may be through persons assigned under other auspices in
 the community.
 The principal among these other banks is the Bank of Communications,
 whose branches were formerly controlled by the Chinese Nationalist Govern-
 ment.  Its main branches under Chinese Communist control are shown below,
 but there is not a great deal of information which would justify its ex-
 istence in addition to the Bank of China branches.   In Hong Kong, its
 operations are under some form of joint administration which controls all
 the Chinese Communist-controlled banks and whose personnel appear to be
 connected with the Bank of China branch in that city.  Branches of the
 Bank of Communications are known to be located in Hong Kong and Rangoon.
 There may also be branches in Singapore and Indonesia.   In Hong Kong, the
 manager is CH'ENG Mu-hao (aka CHIN Meng-hao, M.H. CHENG, CHENG Moo Hou),
 and among the assistant managers is KO Shih-liang.
 In Rangoon, the Bank of Communications is located in the same build-
 ing with the Bank of China, and KUNG Ch'ing-lin (aka C.L. KYONG and KUNG
 Him-lian) is manager.  Assistant manager is LU Feng-ao (aka LOH Fong-
 ngaw and James LOK).
 Besides the Bank of China and Bank of Communications, there are many
 other banks in Hong Kong under Chinese Communist control.  The largest of
 these are included among the following:

 NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (HSIN HUA NEWS AGENCY) (NCNA)
 This news agency is an official organ of the People's Republic of
 China; administratively it is under the State Council, with headquarters
 in Peking.  It was under the government News Administration from 1949
 until that administration was abolished in August 1952.   It bears the
 same relationship to the Chinese Communist Government that the Tass News
 Agency does to the USSR, and is also probably used for the other activi-
 ties in addition to its Qbvious overt functions.  A conference of news
 agencies' representatives from Communist nations was reported to have been
 held in Peking, in September 1956, ?with the NCNA as host.  The NCNA dates
 back at least to the Yenan days of the Communist Party and has grown into
 the principal source of the Communist world's information on Asian affairs,
 with correspondents throughout the Far East and all principal cities of
 Europe and Asia.  Thus far no representatives are known to be in the West-
 ern Hemisphere on permanent assignment, although some have traveled there
 with various delegations.
 Besides daily broadcasts of NCNA news dispatches via Radio Peking to
 the local press throughout Communist China, much of the NCNA daily file
 is beamed to Southeast Asia via Radio Peking, is monitored there, and is
 distributed in the larger communities in Southeast Asia, not only to the
 Chinese Communist controlled press, but also to such local Chinese lan-
 guage and vernacular papers as make use of the material, slanted and la-
 den with propaganda as it is.   It is also probable that the NCNA offices
 and representatives review the non-Communist publications in the larger
 communities in Southeast Asia and translate news items and editorials of
 interest to Communist China.
 Although party and government lines of command have not been an-
 nounced, it would be logical that the Propaganda Department of the CCP
 and the Second Staff Office (Culture and Education) of the State Council

 would exercise policy direction of the NCNA activities.  Director of the
 NCNA since 1952 has been WU Leng-hsi, who is a member of the board of
 directors of the ACRFC, vice chairman of the ACFJ, and a director of the
 PIFA, and who was a member of the Chinese Communist delegation to the
 April 1954 Geneva Conference.  WU was deputy director of NCNA from 1950
 to 1952 under CH'EN K'o-han, who is now a Vice Minister of Cultural Af-
 fairs.   Deputy directors of the NCNA are:   CHU Mu-chih, MOU Hai-lu (MIAO
 Hai-leng), and TENG Kang.
 While this section is principally concerned with NCNA representatives
 stationed outside the China mainland, there is merit in listing the fol-
 lowing persons, some of whom are connected with the ACRFC and thus may be
 traveling abroad with delegations.  All of them either are editors, are

 CHINA TRAVEL SERVICE {CTS)
 This company was founded in Shanghai in 1924.  Half of its original
 shares were owned by the Chinese Nationalist Government.   It had a branch
 in Hong Kong prior to World War II.
 Little is known of the organizational structure of the CTS or of its
 direction from Peking.  Whether there is an agengy in Peking which exer-
 cises control and supervision of the CTS is not clear.   It appears cer-
 tain that there is such an organization, that it is under Chinese Com-
 munist control, and that it works through representatives or agents in
 various locations throughout Southeast Asia.  The CTS has offices in ports
 of entry to and exit from Communist China (including Canton, Shanghai,
 Amoy, Swatow, Lingshan, and Shench'uan, on the border with Macao and pos-
 sibly in other ports along the coast of China to the north).   It has close
 relations with the Bank of China where there are branches of this bank and
 with offices of the New China News Agency in Southeast Asia. It handles
 matters in connection with entry permits to Communist China and handles
 shipment of freight for travelers as well as shipments and documents in
 connection with Communist China's foreign trade.  It serves the Associa-
 tion for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries (ACRFC) and other Com-
 munist front organizations in facilitating travel to China of persons
 from non-Communist countries.   It works with and through other travel
 agents (Communist and non-Communist) in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Macao,
 and Japan to facilitate travel.   It seems likely that the CTS bears some
 close relationship to the Commission for Overseas Chinese Affairs (COCA),
 and works closely with the COCA office in Canton.   It is possible that
 there are travel agencies in some places in Southeast Asia using the title
 China Travel Service which are only agents of the Chinese Communist organ-
 ization or may be completely independent of CTS control.  For example,
 there is a China Travel Service in Macao managed by FANG Pao-ch'ing, which
 is apparently connected with the China Navigation Company, but there is
 nothing to indicate it is connected with the China Travel Service (Hong
 Kong) Ltd.  The CTS may also perform "liaison" services in connection
 with persons and goods moving via Hong Kong and Macao for transshipment
 to and from the China mainland.
 Prior to 1949, China Travel Service in Hong Kong was operated and
 controlled by the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank.  By 1951, the.
 Chinese Communists had taken over control of the China Travel Service but
 claimed it was a private enterprise and not connected with the China
 National Travel Service.  In 1954, the CTS was reorganized in Hong Kong
 as China Travel Service (Hong Kong) Ltd.  The CTS appears to be closely
 connected with the Chinese Communist controlled banks in Hong Kong.  SHEN
 Yung, head of the General Affairs Department of the Bank of China, Hong
 Kong, is active in the affairs of CTS.

 It is possible the China Travel Service may be connected in some way
 with the Chinese International Travel Agency, mentioned in a Peking broad-
 cast in January 1957.  This broadcast stated a protocol had been signed
 between the Chinese International Travel Agency (China International
 Tourist Service), and the Soviet International Travel Agency (possibly
 INTOURIST) calling for the Chinese agency to handle 1,000 private Soviet
 tourists, 25 at a time, during 1957.  The Soviet Agency would, in turn,
 handle an unspecified number of Chinese private tourists numbering more
 than 15 at a time.
 Key personnel of the branch offices of the China Travel Service are
 probably assigned through some central Chinese Communist organ, but most
 of the staff of employees are probably recruited locally.   It appears
 that some of the agencies or independent travel services through which
 the CTS works specialize in handling Chinese traveling to and from spe-
 cific geographical areas of the China mainland.  The CTS branch offices
 may deal with the Public Security Bureaus on the China mainland in obtain-
 ing entry and exit permits.  The extent to which the CTS deals with il-
 legal travelers is not known, nor is there a clear relationship between
 the CTS and persons or groups engaged in smuggling such travelers into and
 out of China. It is probable that the CTS either operates or has close
 connection with hotels in Canton, Hong Kong, and Macao for billeting of
 travelers with whom they are dealing.

 MIN AN INSURANCE COMPANY
 This is a Chinese Communist owned concern with offices in the Bank
 of China Building in Hong Kong.  The home office is believed to be locat-
 ed on the mainland in Shanghai.                      It provides all-risk marine insurance
 coverage for cargoes destined to or from Communist China.   It is closely
 associated with the Bank of China, other Chinese Communist controlled
 banks and export/import firms in Hong Kong.  The company was founded in
 1947, by CH'EN Jih-ch'ang and came under control of the Chinese Communists
 in 1949.  Ultimate direction is believed to come from the CPG Ministry of
 Finance, perhaps through the Bank of China.
 In September 1949, the company was registered with the Hong Kong
 government by the following persons:   SHIH Ching-yen (K.Y. ZAH), formerly
 of the Universal Development Company, CHANG Hsi-jung (S.W. CHEUNG), mana-
 ger of the Pao Sheng Native Bank in Hong Kong, and LIANG Wan-ch'eng.
 Shareholders in addition to these three men were:  FU Nai-tong; CHANG
 Yun-hsiao (Y.S. CHANG), manager of Universal Development Company in 1951;
 and LIANG Tzu-yu.
 In addition to CHANG Hsi-jung and LIANG Wen-ch'eng, as of 1954, the
 following were members of the Min An Insurance Company board of directors:
 CHENG T'ieh-ju, manager of the Bank of China, Hong Kong branch; CHEENG
 Mu-hao, manager of the Bank of Communications, Hong Kong branch; HUANG

 insurance other than marine all-risk coverage, which is handled by the
 Min An Insurance Company.   It occupies offices in the Bank of China Build-
 ing in Hong Kong and has branches in other locations in Southeast Asian
 countries.  This company is affiliated with the Bank of China and closely

 WANG Feng-wu, LI Ping, and CH'EN Jui-kuang.  For some time there has
 been international air service between China and the USSR, North Korea
 and the Mongolian People's Republic, but names of the CAB representatives
 in these countries are not known although there has been mention of such
 an office in the USSR and North Korea.   Interest in these personnel with-

 tives in areas outside of Sino-Soviet control.
 Under the Air Transport Agreement signed in November 1955, between
 Communist China and Burma, an office of the CAB representative was set up

 in Rangoon, by July 1956.  Although service is maintained from Communist
 China to Mandalay, Burma, no CAB office is known to have been set up
 there as yet.
 Officials of CAB stationed in Burma are:
 WANG Ming-chen--Manager,
 CH'EN Kuo-hsun--Assistant Manager; aka SHEN Kuo-hsun.
 HSU Hsiung--Assistant Manager.
 LIU Tung-ao--Assistant Manager; aka LIU Tung-cao.
 WANG Chien-kung--Apparently set up office in Rangoon and returned
 to China.   Person by same name was reported Deputy Chief of
 the Civil Affairs Office, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
 People's Council.
 Agreements with India and Nepal provided for an exchange of aviation
 rights between China and these countries.  Exploratory flights of Chinese
 Communist planes to these countries from Lhasa, Tibet, were being under-
 taken in October 1956, and, when routes are established, offices of CAB
 with permanent staffs will probably be set up in each of these countries.
 Negotiations for Air Ceylon International to fly from Colombo to
 Canton, Communist China, have been reported to have been concluded.  Since
 Ceylon has established diplomatic relations with Communist China, this
 could result in extension of Chinese Communist air service to Colombo and
 establishment of an office of CAB in Ceylon.

 CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTICIPATION IN WORLD COMMUNIST
 ORGANIZATIONS
 GENERAL
 Chinese Communist mass organizations have long been represented in
 international mass front organizations and at their meetings, but, since
 1949, this participation has greatly increased.
 In some of these organizations Communist China has representation
 on the permanent (full-time) secretariat staffs and among the translators
 and interpreters.   These names are followed by the designator "(P)" in
 the groupings which follow.   In other instances Chinese Communists are
 prominent among the elected officers and council members.
 Listed below are those known to fall in these two categories, but
 the list is not believed to be complete.   In headings below are shown
 first the international Communist organization, followed by the Chinese
 Communist federation or group which is the national affiliate of the
 international organization.  From these national groups personnel are
 drawn to serve as executives of the international groups and to attend the
 various congresses, usually held annually, festivals which are held less
 frequently, and the special conferences called from time to time to serve
 as sounding boards for international Communist propaganda campaigns.
 Listings of persons attending various meetings of these international
 Communist fronts are as announced in Chinese Communist radio broadcasts
 or publications and should not be presumed to include all of the delega-
 tions or delegates but only illustrative examples.   In most cases only
 the name of the leader of the delegation is given, and there are usually
 many members of each group.

 INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE. FOR THE PROMOTION OF TRADE (IC PT)
 China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT)
 The ICPT was founded following the Moscow Economic Conference in
 1952 as the Committee for the Promotion of International Trade to fur-
 ther and coordinate the efforts of the various national committees or-
 ganized to foster trade between the West, with its private enterprise,
 and the bloc, with its government-controlled, centrally-planned econom-
 ic system.   One of its primary objectives was to try to overcome the
 effects of the COCOM and CIIINCOM embargoes.
 In October 1956, decision was taken to disband the ICPT and the ICPT
 press organ, International Trade, announced its discontinuation in the
 July-August 1956 issue.   In announcing dissolution of the ICPT, it was
 stated that National Committees of this organization are "now sufficient-
 ly experienced and in contact with each other to be able to dispense with
 an international liaison organization."  The decision was reportedly made
 by delegates from the French, Soviet, and Communist Chinese National Com-
 mittees.   It is reported the Vienna headquarters of the ICPT was closed
 in the latter part of 1956.

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S CULTURAL OFFENSIVE AND FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATIONS
 In conducting Communist China's cultural offensive against the free
 world the CCP's United Front tactics are carried out through numerous of-
 ficial and unofficial channels.                Government organs available to it for
 this purpose include the Ministry of Culture, the Commission of Overseas
 Chinese Affairs, the cultural and trade sections of diplomatic installa-
 tions abroad, the Second Staff Office (Culture and Education) of the State
 Council, the New China News Agency, the Broadcasting Administration Bu-
 reau, and the Liaison Bureau for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
 Among the "unofficial" organizations which have been formed or adapted by
 the United Front Department in order to meet the requirements of the cul-
 tural offensive are the propaganda organs of the satellite parties, the
 international liaison departments of the larger people's and front organ-
 izations, and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with
 Foreign Countries (ACRFC).
 The ACRFC is treated separately because of its distinctive role in
 the cultural offensive.  Behind the front which it provides, the CCP,
 through its United Front and Propaganda Departments, maintains an active
 relationship with China friendship societies throughout the free world.
 CHINESE PEOPLE'S ASSOCIATION FOR CULTURAL RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES
 (ACRFC)
 The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign
 Countries was founded on 3 May 1954, in Peking, at a meeting presided
 over by KUO Mo-jo.  According to the New China News Agency, its purpose
 is "to develop still further the friendly relations between the Chinese
 people and the people of various other countries and to promote cultural
 exchange between them."
 Orginally the association was sponsored by 10 "people's organizations"
 representing various cultural and professional fields.  These organiza-
 tions were:  (1) China Peace Committee; (2) All China Federation of Litera-
 ture and Arts Circles; (3) All China Federation of Scientific Societies;
 (4) All China Federation of Trade Unions; (5) All China Federation of-Dem-
 ocratic Women; (6) All China Federation of Democratic Youth; (7) All China
 Students' Federation; (8) China-India Friendship Association; (9) China-
 Burma Friendship Association; and (10) the Chinese People's Institute of

 In terms of political affiliation, the board of directors of ACRFC
 appears to be about evenly divided among Communist, and minority party

 leaders and "nonpartisans."  Among the 50 members whose political affili-
 ation is definitely known or fairly certain, 30 are Communist Party mem-
 bers while approximately the same number belong to the China Democratic
 League, the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, and other minority par-
 ties.  Among the other 122 board members there are probably some other
 Communist Party members, but most of them are probably what the Chinese
 Communists call "democratic nonpartisans."  A large number of the ACRFC
 officials are active members of one or another of the friendship associa-
 tions in Communist China.
 The ACRFC must not be confused with the Liaison Bureau for Cultural
 Relations with Foreign Countries, a government organ under the State Coun-
 cil, nor with the Government Ministry of Culture, both of which deal di-
 rectly, on a government-to-government basis, with counterpart organs of
 the USSR and Sino-Soviet bloc countries (usually under formal cultural
 cooperation agreements) in handling exchanges of cultural delegations
 between these countries and Communist China.   It is significant that
 CH'EN Chung-thing, secretary general of the ACRFC, is also acting head
 of the Liaison Bureau for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.

 CHINA FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATIONS IN NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES
 China (Communist) friendship organizations are known to exist in at
 least the 25 countries covered individually in subsequent pages.   In 19
 other countries friendship groups have been reported, but little or no
 data on members are available.  In some countries they are known by other
 titles, as, for example, the Center of Cultural and Economic Relations
 between China and Italy, located in Rome, and the Chilean-China Cultural
 Institute, with headquarters in Santiago.  The words "friendship" and
 "cultural" are used because they are obviously inoffensive and unobtru-
 sive terms behind which the real purposes of these organizations may be
 concealed.

 The typical China friendship society was formed by members of the
 local Communist Party, and CP front groups with help from the Chinese
 Communist embassy, where one exists, some local representative group of
 Chinese, and citizens of the country concerned who have lived in or vis-
 ited China.  An attempt is made to conceal Communist sponsorship and con-
 trol, usually by placing popular non-Communist political leaders, legis-
 lators, businessmen, educators, scientists, and other professional fig-
 ures in prominent friendship society positions.  Actual control is exer-
 cised by Communist Party or fellow traveler members who hold less con-
 spicuous posts in the organization.
 The primary function of each of the China friendship societies is to
 pressure the local government to relax its internal security measures and
 to obtain diplomatic recognition for the Peking government.  Where recog-
 nition has already been extended, the friendship society campaigns for
 closer cultural and economic ties with Communist China.
 In countries which have not recognized the Peking government, the
 friendship society often performs some embassy-type functions on behalf
 of the Chinese Communists.  This responsibility was stressed by a member
 of the Chilean-China Cultural Institute who returned in 1955 from a visit
 to China.  During his visit he had met with CHOU En-lai and other high-
 ranking officials who had praised the work of the Institute and empha-
 sized its importance as a link between China and "progressive forces"
 not only in Chile, but throughout Latin America.
 In their efforts to promote the interests of the Peking government
 and to undermine local resistance to Communism, these friendship socie-
 ties sponsor a variety of overt activities.  Among these are included:
 a.
 Public exhibits of Chinese handicraft, arts, and
 drama.
 b.
 c.
 d.
 e.
 Lecture tours by persons returning from visits to
 Motion pictures filmed in China.
 Construction of China friendship auditoriums.

 h.
 Receptions for visiting Chinese delegations.
 i.
 Radio programs.

 k.
 Celebrations of Chinese Communist national holidays.
 THE ACRFC AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATIONS
 The ACRFC was formed in May 1954, its stated purpose being to pro-
 mote cultural exchanges between China and other countries.  Like all other
 fronts, it is firmly under CCP control.  The presence on its executive
 committee of senior CCP propaganda specialists suggests joint subordina-
 tion to the CCP's United Front and Propaganda Departments.

 A survey of its overt activities since January 1955 reveals that the
 ACRFC works very closely with all the China friendship societies.  Rela-
 tions with China friendship societies such as those in India, Burma, Egypt,
 Japan, Nepal, Indonesia, and Pakistan are handled through counterpart
 friendship associations which have been set up in China.
 Since it was established in May 1954, ACRFC has, among its activi-
 a.                            Invited and received delegations of scholars, scientists, cul-
 tural figures, etc., from Japan, India, Indonesia, Norway, Sweden, Den-
 mark, France, Italy, Tunisia, Great Britain, New Zealand, Finland, Ice-
 land, Egypt, Australia, and many other non-Communist nations.   (May 1954-
 July 1956)
 b.  Held exhibits of Chinese arts and crafts in Pakistan, India,
 and Indonesia.   (January-April 1955)
 c.  Sent a talented Chinese opera troupe to perform in the major
 European cities.   (June 1955-May 1956)
 d.  Sent a four-man delegation to visit Chile and Argentina.   (July-
 August 1954)
 e.  Signed an agreement in November 1955 with the National League
 for the Protection of the Constitution in Japan providing for the es-
 tablishment in Tokyo of a liaison organization to keep in close touch
 with the ACRFC, distribute propaganda material, and accelerate cultural
 exchanges between the two countries.  This Japanese organization began to
 function in March 1956, and now serves as the clearing house for exchanges
 of delegations between Japan and Communist China.
 f.  Sent a Chinese opera group to perform in Japan (mid-1956).
 g.  Sent an opera troupe to Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay,
 in late 1956, under the leadership of CH'U T'u-nan, chairman of the ACRFC.
 The performances were sponsored in Chile by the Chilean-China Cultural
 Institute (ICCC), particularly by Senator Salvador ALLENDE Gossens, who
 had seen the opera company perform during his trip to the USSR and China.
 The Chilean Communist Party made maximum propaganda use of this visit.
 Gifts were presented to Chilean officials, and they were invited to visit
 Peking.  Whether the deficit resulting from the opera's performances was
 made up from Communist Chinese funds or partly from funds raised by the
 Chilean Communist Party and the ICCC is not known.
 The above constitute the majority of the ACRFC's publicized activi-
 ties during 1955-1956.  All were conducted in conjunction with China
 friendship societies in the countries listed.  For example, the reception
 and local arrangements for the ACRFC delegation which visited Argentina

 Approved For Rel                 0915R000800120001-9
 and Chile, in 1954, were handled by the Argentine Association of Chinese
 Culture and the Chilean-China Cultural Institute; the delegations from
 Japan, France, Norway, etc., were selected and accompanied by officials of
 China friendship societies in these countries; the tour of the Chinese
 opera troupe in Europe was co-sponsored and entertained by China friend-
 ship societies in the countries visited; representatives from the Japan-
 China Friendship Society were among those signing the agreement with the
 ACRFC on cultural exchange, and the Japan-China Friendship Society co-
 sponsored, along with the ACRFC, the visit of the MEI Lan-fang opera group
 to Japan.   In most cases the delegations were headed by officers or mem-
 bers of the board of directors of the ACRFC.
 The fact that its publicized activities are conducted in conjunction
 with China friendship societies in non-Communist countries reflects the
 very close relationship between the ACRFC and the friendship societies.
 While the exact nature of this relationship is not immediately apparent,
 the scope and timing of the various joint undertakings listed and the
 precision with which they are executed indicate that the relationship is
 more than one of close coordination.  Furthermore, the expense of the
 operations conducted by the various China friendship societies, when meas-
 ured against the critical financial status of these organizations and
 their parent Communist Parties, suggests the likelihood they are financed
 or at least supported from Peking.  Thus, on the basis of an analysis of
 the overt activities of the ACRFC and the friendship societies, there are
 strong reasons to believe that China friendship societies in non-Communist
 countries are supported by, and to a considerable extent directed, by the
 ACRFC, an ancillary of the CCP United Front and Propaganda Departments.
 USE OF FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATIONS FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES
 The following New China News Agency dispatch illustrates the propa-
 ganda usage of the friendship associations and the delegations they spon-
 sor:
 "Jakarta, August 15, 1956--Soong Ch'ing-ling, vice chairman of
 the standing committee of the Chinese National People's Congress,
 this morning received leaders of the Indonesia-China Friendship As-
 sociation at the State palace.  Present were chairman of the associ-
 ation, Professor Prijono, and Mrs. Prijono, all the leaders of the
 association, wife of air chief of staff, Mrs. Suriadarma, wife of
 second deputy speaker of the Parliament, Mrs. Arundji Kartawinata,
 leaders of women's organizations in Jakarta, women's representatives
 of the All-Indonesia People's Congress, secretary general of the All-
 Indonesia People's Congress Hanafi, chairman of the Association for
 Indonesia-Soviet Cultural Exchange Werdojo, and others.
 "Also present were the Chinese Ambassador and Mrs. Huang Chen,
 deputy secretary general of the standing committee of the Chinese
 National People's Congress, Chang Sun, and leader of the Peking acro-
 batic troupe, Hua Chia.

 "Professor Prijono said in his welcoming speech that it was
 impossible to describe how happy the Indonesian people were when
 they knew of the arrival of Soong Ching-ling.  The Indonesian people,
 inspired by the spirit of the Bandung conference, were willing to be
 friendly with other peoples and march side by side with them toward
 lasting world peace.  He said that the Indonesia-China Friendship
 Association under his leadership had become an inalienable part of
 the rank of Indonesian people marching ahead.  It had been well-de-
 veloped in good cooperation with the China-Indonesia Friendship
 Association in Peking.  He believed that the visit of SOONG Ching-
 ling, together with the arrival of the Chinese friendship delegation
 headed by Sheikh Nur Mohammed TA Pu-sheng and the Peking acrobatic
 troupe led by HUA Chia, would be helpful for the work of the Indo-
 nesia-China Friendship Association, and work for better mutual under-
 standing and closer friendship between the two peoples."
 INDIVIDUAL CHINA FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATIONS
 Very little has been reported on the organization, functioning and
 personnel of some of the China friendship associations, particularly those
 in the Sino-Soviet bloc.   In North Vietnam and North Korea friendship
 groups are known to exist but little is known about them.   In May 1957 a
 Polish Communist leader told of plans to form a Poland-China Friendship
 Association.  A Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, for which a membership
 of over 50,000,000 is presently claimed, was founded in Communist China in
 1950.  However, no Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association was.formalized
 until October 1957, when it was launched with much fanfare.  Ivan A. ANDRE-
 YEV, member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, was named
 president; and vice-presidents include A. S. PEREVERTALLO, N. S. TIKHONOV,
 and P. A. SATUKOV.  Aleksandr PANYUSHKIN, former Ambassador to Nationalist
 China (1939-191+5), to the United States (1947-1952), and to Communist China
 (1952-1953), was among those elected to the executive board.  POPOVA, head
 of the All-Union (USSR) Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Coun-
 tries, took a prominent part in launching this new association.  Its func-
 tions will probably be similar to those of the SSFA, a mass organization
 used to sell the USSR and Communist bloc solidarity to the Chinese people.
 A Sino-Albanian Friendship Association has been reported with CH'IEN Chun-
 jui as secretary general.
 While a number of other China friendship or cultural groups in non-
 Communist countries have been mentioned in the press and in broadcasts,
 few or no identifying data as to their membership or activities are avail-
 able.                  The following are some of those mentioned, but the degree to which
 they have been formalized and the extent of their activites is not known:

 In this country the front organization is known as the Argentine As-

 its secretary is Serafina WARSCHAVER DE GIUDICE.  Juan C. CASTIGNINO is
 reported to be one of the vice presidents of the association.  This as-
 sociation published a magazine, Cultura China, but planned to discontinue
 it and replace it with a monthly or bi-monthly bulletin, Informativo Chino.
 The association received magazines from Communist China for sale in Argen-
 tina.  The association has sections for economics, newspapers, and litera-
 ture, art, the theater, and youth.
 A medical delegation headed by ARGONZ was in Communist China in May
 1956, on invitation of the China Medical Association.  A cultural delega-
 tion headed by Americo NUNZIATA was there at the same time, having been
 invited by the ACRFC.   Both delegations left for Moscow, 29 May 1956.
 M. Carlos GUASTAVINO, Argentine composer and pianist, was in Shanghai,
 in June 1952, on invitation of the ACRFC.
 The association sponsored an exhibit in Buenos Aires, in May 1956, of
 the paintings of Jose VENTURELLI, a Communist who had spent 2 years in
 Communist China.
 Informativo Chino, an official bulletin of the Association, announced
 that Lino Eneas SPILIMBERGO, Argentine painter and member of the Argentine
 Communist peace front organization, had been invited to visit China, in
 1956, by HUA Chun-wu, secretary of the Association of Chinese Fine Arts.

 There have been references to an Australia-China Friendship Society.
 Michael LINDSAY is reported as secretary and a Reverend Anderson, chair-
 man of the Sydney Peace Assembly, was on a welcoming committee for a the-

 The ACRFC sponsored and financed the trip of an 11-man cultural dele-
 gation to Communist China, in May 1956, headed by C.P. Fitzgerald, presi-
 dent of the Australia-China Society and professor of Far East history at
 the Australian National University.
 A trade union delegation headed by Frank PURSE spent a month in April-
 May 1956, in China, as guests of the All China Federation of Trade Unions.
 Another member of this delegation was Stan MORAN, treasurer of the Water-
 side Workers' Federation of Australia, Sydney branch.
 A trade delegation from Australia visited Peking for the 1956 May
 Day celebrations.  In statements made by delegation members, "friend-
 ship and unity" with Communist China was stressed.
 A delegation of Chinese Communist journalists was in Australia, in
 November 1956.
 A 1--man Chinese trade union delegation headed by CHAO Kuo-chiang,
 chief of the Chinese Heavy Industry Workers Trade Union, toured Australia,
 in April-May 1956.  Peking Radio stated, "On May 6 the Chinese delegation,
 as well as the Soviet trade unionists, were cheered by May Day paraders
 marching along Sydney streets shouting slogans for peace and establishment
 of normal relations with China and the Soviet Union."  The welcome for
 this delegation was sponsored by the Australia-China Society.

 had been organized in Solo, Bandung, Jogjakarta, Semarang, Surabaya,

 North Sumatra alone, with 200 Indonesian and 100 Chinese members.  The
 regional branches are organized into a national association which held a
 conference in Djakarta, in January 1956.   The national association spon-
 sored Indonesia-China Friendship Week in October 1955.   It has sponsored
 many delegations to and from Communist China.  The Chinese Communist am-

 There are two organizations in Italy which may be the vehicles used
 in developing the China friendship campaign.  These are the Institute for
 Promoting Cultural and. Economic Relations with China, of which Professor
 Feruccio PARRI is president, and the Institute of Oriental Studies in
 Rome, of which Professor TUCCI is dean.  Both of these organizations and
 their leaders have banqueted Chinese delegations and expressed desire for
 furthering friendship between China and Italy, deploring the lack of for-
 mal diplomatic relations.  Labor, women's, trade, Socialist Party., and
 peace delegations from Italy have visited Communist China.  An organiza-
 tion called the Italy-People's China Association had also been named, but
 no data are available concerning it.
 A Chinese Communist women's cultural delegation, headed by LI Te-
 ch'uan, was in Italy in March 1956, to promote "mutual understanding and
 friendship."
 A delegation of Chinese architects, of which bridge-builder MAO I-
 sheng (aka MAO, Eason) was a member, toured Italy, in May 1956.  Among
 those honoring the delegation was Professor TUCCI, dean of the Institute
 of Oriental Studies, in Rome.   Professor Feruccio PARRI, president of the
 Italian Institute for Promoting Cultural and Economic Relations with China,
 entertained a cultural delegation in April 1956, headed by HOU Te-pang,
 with CHI Chao-ting as deputy chief.    An Italian cultural delegation of
 14 members, headed by Piero CALAMANDREI, was in China in October 1955.

 two countries.  These have resulted in many contacts by the Chinese dele-
 gates with leaders in Italy's academic, cultural, parliamentary, govern-
 mental, and trade circles.

 with funds donated by KUO Po, in honor of his father, KUO Mo-jo.  One of
 the promoters of this center was OGURA Masatune, former Finance Minister
 of Japan.  Radio Peking stated 400 representatives of JCFA chapters met

 This section is concerned with exchange of delegations between Com-
 munist China and the non-Communist-controlled nations in what the Tokyo
 Central News calls "invitational diplomacy."  While there had been some
 exchange of delegations with nations outside the Sino-Soviet bloc prior
 to 1954, most of this intercourse was with those non-Communist countries
 which had theretofore established diplomatic relations with Communist
 China.   There have, of course, been frequent interchanges of delegations
 with the Soviet-Satellite nations, generally arranged for through official
 government organs or by the respective Communist parties, with which this
 section is not concerned.  Nor is the dispatch of delegates of the Com-
 munist parties of the non-Communist countries to various meetings or for
 travel in Communist China a subject to be covered in this section.  While
 many of the delegations described herein as traveling to China undoubtedly
 included many Communists and sympathizers, their participation in such del-
 egations has usually been concealed or at least the fact that they are
 Communists usually has not been mentioned in propaganda concerning the
 visits.  The obvious purpose is to create the impression that these are
 free interchanges of non-Communist controlled groups with Communist China.
 The delegations from China make most of their overt contacts with and re-
 ceive most of their entertainment from non-Communists prominent in their
 respective fields and from the China friendship groups set up in the host
 countries.
 The exchange of cultural, good will, art, drama, trade, scientific,
 sports, military, parliamentary, agricultural p trade union, religious,
 and other types of delegations categorized herein with nations which are
 non-Communist, particularly in Europe, the Middle East, Near East, North
 Africa, and Southeast Asia, began in earnest in 1954-1955, while the first
 known Chinese Communist delegation went to Latin America in mid-1956.
 Numerous groups and individuals from Latin America were invited to China,
 in 1955-1956.
 In general, the Chinese Communist delegations include specialists
 within the field of competence indicated by the designation given them
 (i.e., scientific, agricultural, trade union, journalists, trade, etc.),
 Communist party members who make contacts with the Communist party of the
 countries visited, interpreter/translators, press representatives from
 New China News Agency, and others who may have been assigned special tasks
 under the auspices of the delegation.  Over-all responsibility for arrang-
 ing for delegations going out from Communist China seems to be assigned
 jointly to the Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries
 (ACRFC), to the mass organization within Communist China to which the
 specialists belong, and to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  All of these

 Approved For R               78-00915R000800120001-9
 organizations possibly perform this task under the general cognizance of
 the Third Division of the First Bureau of the CCP United Front Department
 (external liaison).  There should be no misconception that the delegations
 from Communist China are spontaneous or nonofficial such as they would
 be in free nations.  They are carefully selected and screened before be-
 ing allowed to go abroad and should be considered only as official dele-
 gations making the visit to carry out policies firmly laid down by the
 CCP.
 This campaign of sending good will delegations abroad is a carefully
 conceived and executed campaign designed to build people-to-people rapport
 which can be used to support pressure from pro-Communist China groups for
 official relations with Peking and alignment with Chinese Communist ob-
 jectives.  A studied effort is made to avoid giving the appearance that
 these delegations have direct government sponsorship, and expenses in-
 volved seems to be of no regard in this promotion of "people's diplomacy."
 It is to be noted that arrangements for delegations going to Com-
 munist-controlled countries are not made by the ACRFC but are handled by
 the government Ministry of Culture and the Liaison Bureau for Cultural
 Relations with Foreign Countries under the State Council.  The ACRFC is
 covered in some detail in Part V of this compilation.
 Delegations to Communist China are invited by the-mass organization
 or front in China corresponding to the special area of competence of the
 visiting group.  Itineraries and entertainment are arranged by these mass
 organizations or fronts along with the ACRFC and friendship associations.
 Propaganda resulting from visits to China of delegations is slanted to
 give the appearance that friendship between the people of China and the
 nation concerned is strengthened by the exchanges; that closer cultural,
 economic, and diplomatic ties are desirable; and that Communist China is
 deserving of a full role in international affairs.
 People's Daily, official Chinese Communist publication, in February
 1956, stated "some 4,760 people from 63 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa,
 America, and Australia visited China last year (1955), which is 64% more
 than in 1954.  In the same period, 5,833 Chinese visited 33 other countries,
 which, compared with 1954, is two-thirds more."
 In 1955 alone, the ACRFC and other appropriate mass and front or-
 ganizations announced sponsorship of delegations from non-Communist coun-
 tries as follows:
 Western Europe
 61
 Free Far East
 73
 Near East, South Asia, and Africa

 An NCNA dispatch from Peking, 21 January 1957, said:  "Over 5,200
 persons from 75 countries visited China, in 1956.   In the same period
 more than 5,400 Chinese visited 49 countries.  Last year, some 3,500
 people took part in mutual visits between China and countries in Asia and
 Africa.  Of these, some 1,200 came to China from Japan.  Friendly exchange
 between China and countries in Latin America showed a marked increase in
 1956.  Visitors to China included government leaders, members of parlia-
 ment, scientists, writers, artists, doctors, educators, industrialists,
 businessmen, religious leaders, leaders of trade unions, women's and
 youth organizations, and other public leaders."
 A New China News Agency dispatch from Peking quoted a report of the
 Japan-China Friendship Association as stating about 1,243 persons repre-
 senting 60 Japanese organizations visited Communist China, while 142 per-
 sons representing 7 organizations representing Communist China visited
 Japan, in 1956.
 The foregoing figures are based on Chinese Communist propaganda and
 therefore must be considered as approximate rather than exact.
 The following represents a tabulation of a number of the important
 delegations within the various categories which were sent abroad from
 Communist China, between January 1955, and the date of this report.  Where
 members of the delegations are known, their names are included.  By far
 the largest number of exchanges of delegations has been with Japan, In-
 donesia, and India, in that order.
 Since January 1955, the ACFTU has been host to labor leaders from
 Japan, Indonesia, India, Burma, Pakistan, Ceylon, Iran, Lebanon, Syria,
 Jordan, Tunisia, the Sudan, France, Italy, Great Britain, Egypt, the Ara-
 bian Federation of Trade Unions, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore,
 Brazil, and Chile.  A group of trade unionists from the Middle East, Near
 East, Africa, Latin America, and Europe were visiting Communist China, in
 1956.
 Five hundred ninety trade unionists from 43 countries visited China,
 in 1956, according to the Peking Daily Worker; 247 delegates were from
 Japan and 124 from the Soviet Union.  An Arab workers delegation, one of

 the larger ones, was composed of delegates from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon,
 Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait, Iraq; Jordan, and Libya.  Trade unionists
 came from Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, West Africa, Sudan,
 Morocco, and Tunisia.   In 1956, Chinese trade unions sent 135 delegates
 to 13 countries, including Japan, India, France, Britain, Italy, Austra-
 lia, and New Zealand.

 During 1955 and early 1956, the China Peace Committee (CPC) invited
 and acted as host to a number of visiting cultural figures, so-called
 "peace partisans," and journalists from India, Japan, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon,
 Jordan, the Sudan, Brazil, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Great Britain,
 Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, France, Spain, Egypt, and Italy.
 Besides the CPC, other Chinese Communist organizations actively spon-
 soring these peace delegations included the PIFA, Ministry of Foreign Af-
 fairs, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
 D. Hewlett Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, has visited Communist China
 3 times since 1949, the last time in August-September 1956 on invitation
 from the CPC.
 Chinese Communist delegates attended the first World Conference for
 Prohibiting Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Tokyo, in August 1955.  This
 delegation was headed by LIU Ning-i and members included CHENG Fang-wu
 and HSIEH Ping-hsin.  The Japan-China Friendship Association was active
 in entertaining the delegation and arranging its activities.  Another
 delegation, headed by HSU Kuang-ping, attended the second World Conference
 for Prohibiting Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Tokyo and Nagasaki, in
 August 1956.  Among the delegates were:  ANG Yung-ho, a trade union leader;
 WANG YOn-sheng; TS'AO Yu, a writer; and K'ANG Yung-ho.  KUO Mo-jo headed
 a 14-man delegation to a WPC meeting in Colombo, Ceylon, in June 1957.
 Extensive contacts with non-Communist countries have been made through
 visits of groups of Moslems, under sponsorship of the China Islamic Asso-
 ciation and the friendship associations, to countries of Asia and the Near
 East which have large Moslem populations.  The most important of these
 delegations was the Chinese Communist Haj Mission to Mecca, headed by PAO
 Erh-han (Burhan), with Jamal-a-din LI Shu as deputy and at least 22 mem-
 bers, in August-September 1956.  Another group made a pilgrimage to Mecca,
 during the same months in 1955, headed by TA P'u-sheng (Shiekh Nur Mohammed)
 visiting many countries en route, including Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
 Indonesia, and India.  Moslem delegations have on a number of occasions
 visited China from Indonesia, and several groups of Chinese Moslems have
 paid return visits.  Similar exchanges of visits with groups from India,
 Afghanistan, and Pakistan have been made.
 Use of the Chinese Buddhist Association for contacts with Buddhists
 in non-Communist countries such as Burma, Japan, Thailand, and Nepal has
 been promoted as a part of the development of relations with these coun-
 tries.  Some of the groups are described as "peace" delegations.  Two of
 the leaders of many of these delegations representing Communist China have
 been HU Pa-meng and Shirob Galtso (Hsi-jao-Chia-ts'o).

 Approved For Rel                00915R000800120001-9
 Examples of the extension of these tactics to others than Moslems
 and Buddhists are:
 Visit of Dr. RAJAH MANIKAM, Bishop of the Lutheran Church of India,
 on invitation of the China-India Friendship, Association, in March
 1956.
 Three visits of D. Hewlett Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, to Communist
 China, since 1949, under the auspices of the China Peace Committee.
 Visit of Rev. J.S. WILLIAMS, Secretary General of the All-India Fed-
 eration of National Churches, to Peking, in September 1956, at the
 invitation of WU Yao-tsung, Chairman of the National Committee of
 the Churches in China for the Realization of Self-Administration.
 Niphon Saba, head of the Lebanese delegation to the 1955 World As-
 sembly for Peace at Helsinki and Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church
 of Lebanon, was invited to Communist China, in June 1956, by the China
 Peace Committee, and was entertained by the China Islamic Association and
 China Buddhist Association, as well as by LIU En-hou, of the Greek Ortho-
 dox Church in Communist China.
 Bishop TING Kuang-hsun (TING Kuei-t'ang) and his wife, KUO Hsiu-mei,
 attended the Lambeth Convocation in London, in July 1956.
 Parliamentary groups from a number of non-Communist countries visited
 Communist China in 1955-56.  Clear lines of distinction cannot be drawn
 as to which Chinese Communist front organizations issued the invitations
 for such visits.  Invitations to important government leaders of those
 countries with which Communist China was then negotiating diplomatic re-
 lations have been made in the name of LIU Shao-ch'i, chairman of the
 Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and vice chairman
 of the Chinese Communist Party.  These groups have included members or
 heads of governments of India, Britain, Indonesia, Finland, Pakistan,
 Cambodia, Burma, and Laos.  Some of these parliamentary group visits were
 also sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as in the cases of
 foreign ministers and other high officials.   In the cases of members of
 parliament of countries with which Communist China has not established
 diplomatic relations and persons of lesser stature in countries with which
 relations do exist (i.e. governors and mayors), although they are given
 the "red carpet" treatment while in China, they are usually invited by
 the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (PIFA), whose leaders
 handle the visitors' tours and entertainment.  Such visits have included
 members of parliament from Belgium, Great Britain, India, Indonesia,
 Egypt, West Germany, Brazil, Japan, Malaya, Syria, Sweden, and Burma, and
 governors, mayors, and lesser government officials of Afghanistan, Burma,
 Ceylon, Nepal, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, and Egypt, among others.
 CHANG Hsi-jo, president of the PIFA, and P'ENG Chen, mayor of Peking, are
 usually in the forefront in welcoming the latter type of group.

 Among others, Communist China sent a 3-man delegation of the PIFA,
 headed by CHOU Keng-sheng, vice president of PIFA, for a week's visit to
 Britain, in September 1956, on invitation of the British United Nations
 Association.  The PIFA and Ministry of Foreign Affairs co-sponsored
 another delegation which was sent to the coronation in Nepal, in April
 1956.
 A Chinese Communist delegation to the 44th Conference of the Inter-
 Parliamentary Union in Finland, August 1955, was headed by P'ENG Chen.
 Other members of the group were LEI Chieh-ch'iung (f), LIAO Ch'eng-chih,
 NAN Han-ch'en, CHIANG Nan-hsiang, and CH'IEN Tuan-sheng.
 CHANG Chih-hsiang attended the Congress of Mayors of World Capitals
 in Florence, Italy, in October 1955.  CHANG headed a Chinese theater
 group attending the International Theater Festival in Paris, in June 1955,
 also paying visits to the Netherlands, Belgium, England, Switzerland,
 Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, en route.
 There were many exchanges of delegations in the cultural/educational
 field between Communist China and a number of non-Communist countries.
 Some of the countries to which delegations travelled in 1955-56 were:
 Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia-New Zealand, Austria, Burma, Canada,
 Egypt, Ceylon, Finland, France, Greece, Great Britain, Ethiopia, Iceland,
 India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Nepal, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Yugoslavia,
 Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Pakistan, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzer-
 land, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.  In turn, delegations from all these
 countries, plus Ireland, paid visits to China, under the general sponsor-
 ship of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with
 Foreign Countries and, where such exists, the friendship association
 created in the name of China and the country concerned.  Delegations were
 made up of varied groups and sometimes were mixed between the cultural
 educational and other fields, such as journalists,  "peace fighters," those
 concerned with stimulating trade, scientists, women's groups, etc.
 Under the classification cultural/educational were included:  Artists,
 song and dance ensembles, Chinese classical theater groups, opera compa-
 nies (particularly the National Opera of Peking), art exhibits, exhibits
 of native crafts, acrobatic troupes, athletic performers, educators,
 scholars, archeologists, actors, film producers and workers., motion pic-
 ture exhibitions, and the like.  Among the delegations to Communist China
 were included many members of and sympathizers with the Communist parties
 in the various countries but a large portion were non-Communists and
 publicity on activities of the delegations was designed to conceal any
 Communist involvement.

 Contacts of delegations from China to the countries named were gen-
 erally with non-Communist leaders in the respective fields so far as
 publicity was concerned, but there were undoubtedly also contacts with
 the local Communist parties by some designated members of the delegations.
 While in those countries where China friendship associations or comparable
 organizations have been established, much of the entertaining of the
 Chinese Communist delegates was handled by members of these associations.
 The following are a few of those who have been leaders of various
 cultural/educational delegations sent abroad by Communist China:

 There have been some delegations to and from Communist China which
 are designated only as "good will" missions.  An example is the delega-
 tion sent to China, by Tunisia, in September-October 1955, which was in-
 vited by the China Peace Committee, the Association for Cultural Relations
 with Foreign Countries and the China Islamic Association.

 Red Cross delegations were exchanged with Japan and Great Britain,
 in 1955 and 1956.  Public health delegations were also exchanged between
 these two countries and Communist China.  Professor YEN Ching-ching headed
 such a delegation to Britain, in April 1956, representing the China Medi-
 cal Association.              LI Te-ch'uan headed Red Cross delegations to England,
 in June 1955; Japan, in October 1954; Geneva, in 1953; Canada, in 1952;
 Geneva, in 1951; and Monaco, in 1950.
 Agricultural delegations from Communist China were sent to India,
 in September 1956, and to Indonesia, in July, of the same year.  Agri-
 cultural delegations were entertained in China: from Yugoslavia, in Sep-
 tember 1956, and from Italy, in October 1956.  These are among a number
 of similar agricultural and cooperatives delegations exchanged.  LIU Jui-
 lung headed an agricultural delegation to Burma, in March 1955, and CHIN
 Chao-yeh led a similar delegation, also to Burma, in September 1956.
 Among exchanges of military missions have been those from India, in
 September and November 1956; from Indonesia, in September-October 1956
 and May 1957; and from Sweden, in June 1956.  A group of 30 former Japanese
 officers were invited on a good-will mission to China, in October 1956.
 The invitation, according to the Tokyo press, came from CHANG Hsi-jo, head
 of the "Council of People's Diplomacy of Communist China."  Since CHANG
 is head of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (PIFA), these
 are believed to be identical.  Peking offered to pay all expenses of the
 trip.   This was not strictly a military mission since it did not include
 any officers of Japan's present military forces.  Military missions have
 been invited by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the
 Ministry of National Defense and entertained by military and government
 leaders while in China.  A Yugoslav military mission arrived in Peking,
 4 October 1956, and a Chinese Communist military delegation left for Bel-
 grade, two days later.                           Marshal YEH Chien-ying headed a military good-
 will delegation to Burma, in January 1957.
