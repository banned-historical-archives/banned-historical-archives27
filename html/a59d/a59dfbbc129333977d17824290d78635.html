 Khrushchev's speech on 8 July and the Soviet Aviation
 Day air show on the following day underscored Moscow's
 current dual line which combines readiness to negotiate
 on Berlin and Germany with measures to impress the West
 with Soviet military power.  His announcement of a sus-
 pension of force reductions planned for 1961 and an in-
 crease of over three billion rubles in defense alloca-
 tions--following publicity concerning proposed US mili-
 tary budget increases of $3.5 billion--was intended as a
 warning that the US5R will not be deterred from carry-
 ing out its declared ini:e~itions bn Berlin by any mili-
 tary measures the Western powers may take.  Khrushchev
 sought to maintain the political initiative in the
 maneuvering on Berlin by renewing his call for a nego-
 tiated settlement which would protect West Berlin's
 freedom and communications. :These moves are designed
 to make it difficult for the. Western powers to main-
 tain a common front and to induce them to consent to
 negotiations under terms favorable to the USSR.

 Communist bloc deleg~ltes at Geneva continue to press
 for a discussion of neutrality drafts andyto charge the
 West with seek~.ng to break up the confe~'ence with demands
 for prior consideration of control mechanisms.  While

 De Gaulle is determined to relieve France of its
 Algerian burden without delay--preferably through negotia-
 tions but by a complete political withdrawal from Algeria
 if necessary--and is stressing the need to prepare for
 the approaching Berlin crisis to underline his urgency.
 While his 12 July speech re-emphasized the disadvantages
 for both the provisional A1ge~Cian government (PAG) and
 France if negotiations fail, there are indications that
 the French will have a more flexible position, particu-
 larly on the Sahara issue, when negotiations are re-
 sumed.  The PAG is concentrating its efforts on muster-
 ing African support for its claims that the Sahara is
 an integral part of Algeria, while reiterating that it
 is prepared to make political and economic concessions
 if the French recognize this.

 Baghdad`s news coverage of the Kuwaiti issue has
 largely been supplanted by press attention to the cele-
 brations of the 14 July Iraqi revolution.  Press stories
 that British employees of the Iraq Petroleum Company will
 be replaced by Italians have been formally denied by'Iraqi
 authorities.  The British now are trying to find an
 alternative means of guaranteeing the independence of
 Kuwait which would permit early withdrawal of their
 troops.  At the 12 July Arab League Council meeting the
 UAR pressed for the replacement of British troops in
 Kuwait by those-from Arab countries not borderin   r  1,
 thus excluding the UAR.

 Negotiations concerning the composition of a new

 Tshombd?s apparent intention to boycott the forthcoming

 man has expressed the fear that "army elements" may at-

 Pro-Castro extremists in the Dominican Republic are

 ally themselves,  The mob violence sparked by the
 extremists on 7 July has raised another obstacle to the
 cautious moves of President Balaguer to create a more
 democratic, climate; pressure within the regime for a
 return to past repressive tactics against all opposi-
 tion elements has probably increased.  On 5 July
 Balaguer named a new cabinet replacing the one in-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 13 July 1961
 SOVIET INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION LAGS  Page  15
 Problems of industrial construction have evidently
 become serious enough in at least three major areas to
 require the direct intervention of one of Moscow's top
 economic trouble shooters,  A. N. Kosygin.  Kosygin's
 trip last month to construction sites and factories
 in Kuybyshev, Saratov, and Kemerovo oblasts was prob-
 ably intended to give him a chance to investigate at
 first hand the inefficiencies and shortages of building
 materials and equipment which have plagued the construc-
 tion program at various locations throughout the country.
 PARTY JOURNAL CLARIFIES SOVIET AGRICULTURAL POLICY Page  17
 The authoritative party journal Kommunist has set
 forth what appears to be the official line in the high-
 level controversy over the future development of the
 Soviet farm system.  It has come out against the whole-
 sale conversion of collective farms into state farms.
 Those who argue that the time has come to speed up
 conversions, eliminate the private plots of collective
 farmers, and transfer all collective farms to the sys-
 tem of guaranteed monthly cash wages are branded "deep-
 ly incorrect."  The high rate of conversions in 1960
 will probably slow down, and pressures to tailor the
 collective farm more closely to the state farm pat-
 tern may decrease.
 EAST GERMAN MOVES TO COUNTER EVANGELICAL CHURCH CONGRESS Page  18
 The East German regime is maneuvering to reduce
 attendance by East and West Germans at the Evangelical
 Church's all-German congress scheduled to meet in West
 Berlin from 19 to 23 July.  The Communists appear
 reluctant, however, to attempt coercive measures against
 Western attendance.  East Berlin authorities have banned
 congress sessions in the Soviet sector but have not
 revealed whether they will forbid religious services
 as well or what steps they would take to prevent West
 Germans and West Berliners from attending such services.
 The regime is pressin  East German church members to
 boycott the meeting.
 SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY IN ASIA  page  19
 Heightened activity by Moscow and Peiping in rela-
 tion to the Asian Communist parties during the past few
 months reflects the continued strain in Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions, now expressed in increased political and economic
 rivalry rather than in the doctrinal debates which char-
 acterized the peak of the dispute last year.  Moscow,
 with the example of Albania fresh in mind, has apparently
 turned its attention to the task of consolidating its
 position with the important Communist parties of Asia.

 fluence in the areao  While both countries' are inter-
 ested in sauntering Western speculations of competi-
 tion, their protestations of "unity" cannot submer e

 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMUNIST CHINA . Page  22
 Serious difficulties still grip both  industry and
 agriculture,  Production stoppages at individual plants,
 arising from various causes, have been numerous; there
 appears to have been a. significant slowdown in industry
 as a whole in order to rebuild stockpiles of fuel and
 raw materials and to overhaul equipment,  Problems
 with raw materials, parts, and labor productivity con-
 tinue.  Industrial output in 1961 will probably fall
 TURKEY'S CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM . Page  23
 Approval of the new Turkish constitution in the
 national referendum on 9 July was a major step toward
 a return to representative government, General Gursel
 has renewed his promise to hold parliamentary elections
 by mid-Octobero  However, the vote in favor of the new
 constitution was far below the ovex"whelming endorse-
 ment desired by the military regimen  The results re-
 flect both general voter apathy and, apparently, con-
 siderable disillusipnment with the handling of govern-
 ment affairs during the past year by the CNU,  The
 substantial negative vote also indicates continued
 opposition to the Republican People's party and its
 anticipated xeturn to power following the elections.
 POLITICAL STRIKE LIKELY IN NORTHERN RHODESIA . Page  2~
 African nationalists in Northern Rhodesia have called
 for "immediate` positive action" to protest recent British
 proposals for a constitution for the protectorate,  If
 these proposals were put into effect, the main African
 political group--the United National Independence
 party (UNIP)--would probably run a poor second to the
 principal European party in any early election.  Through
 strikes and associated agitation, the UNIP probably
 could disrupt much of the Northern Rhodesian economy
 for a short  eriod
 Brit-
 ain nevertheless will probab y try to impose     a revised
 constitution in the face of African o  osition.
 THE COMMON MARKED AND AI'RICA . . Page  25
 Considerable progress has been made in recent weeks
 toward. establishing  a basis  for reyn~gotfation of  the `1'957
 convention which associates the former French, Belgian,
 and Italian territories in Africa with the Common Market
 (EEC).  Provided their independence is fully respected,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 13 July 1961
 most of these countries appear willing to accept close
 institutional and economic ties with the EEC after the
 present convention expires next year.  Negotiation of
 this partnership will be complicated, however, by un-
 certainty over Britain's future relationship to the EEC.
 Moreover, continuation of African-EEC tariff preferences
 will hurt producers of tropical products elsewhere, no-
 tably in Latin America.
 BRITAIN TO CUT OVERSEAS  SPENDING  Page  26
 The Macmillan government is planning to trim spend-
 ing abroad as a consequence of its balance-of -payments
 difficulties.  This will revive London's efforts to se-
 cure West German payments to defray the foreign exchange
 costs of the British Army of the Phine--the principal
 drain on Britain's nonsterling military spending.  The
 growth of Britain's economic aid to underdevelo ed coun-
 tries  is  also  threatened.

 Peiping's economic setbacks have resulted in a gen-
 eral erosion of public confidence in the regime.  Working-
 level Communist officials, on whom the party depends for
 the execution of its programs, have been confused by
 shifts in policy.  In addition, there is widespread in-
 difference to appeals for greater work efforts.  The
 party leadership has made limited concessions in an
 effort to increase incentives.  The regime  appears
 irresolute, however, and to be making only makeshift

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE j'VEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Khrushchev's  speech ors  8
 July and the Soviet Aviation
 Day air show on the following
 day underscored Moscow's cur-
 rent dual line which combines
 a show of reasonableness and
 readiness to negotiate on Ber-
 lin and Germany with measures
 to impress the West with Soviet
 military power.  His announce-
 ment of a suspension of force.
 reductions planned for 1961 anti
 an increase of over three bil-
 lion rubles in defense alloca-
 tions was intended as a warning
 that the USSR will not be de-.
 terred from carrying out ~,~$
 declared  intentions ~'t~n $er;li:n
 by any military measu~es;`'~he
 Western  powers may oaks  ~odemon-
 strate their firmness on this
 issue.
 Khrushchev sought.tp-wain-
 tain the politicalntiati~e
 in the present maneuvering on
 Berlin by renewing his call for
 a negotiated settlement which
 would protect West Berlin's
 freedom and communications.
 These  political  and;,nil~ta.ry
 moves  are  designed, to rr~ake  it
 difficult for the ~'e~te~rn powers
 to agree on measures to strength-
 en their bargaining position
 and to induce them  o'cansent
 to negotiations under terms
 favorable  to  the USSR,,
 In  his  speech''~'~KYar~ushdl~w'' ,
 again  stated,  on  the on,+~~ ha~t~
 that  the  Soviet  Umtan 'has no
 desire  to  interfere ~n i~he~ i.n-
 ternal affairs of West,$~rl-ink
 to obstruct  Weste~h` a~cets~,  d
 to damage the prestige of the
 US, Britain, and France.  He
 expressed  agreement?'~iirla, : Prey,=~ ,., .'.
 ident  Kennedy's  rec.er~~`'~'~at+e-,
 went that West Berl~ne~s must''
 have the right of an.inde-~  ,
 pendent choice as a free pepple
 and claimed  that  Sovi:~t7 prpp~Qs-,>?
 als, "fully meet this demand."
 Khrushchev appealed to Pres-
 ident Kennedy and De Gaulle and
 Prime Minister Macmillan to
 "display wisdom" in settling
 the German problem and to agree
 to negotiations along with "other
 peace-loving states" to conclude
 a ,peace treaty.  This formula-
 tion stops short of an explicit
 bid for a four-power summit
 meeting and apparently was in-
 tended as a restatement of the
 proposal in the 4 June aide-
 memoire Khrushchev gave the
 President at Vienna calling for
 a peace conference "without de-
 lay."
 Khrushchev's efforts to
 .appear flexible and constructive,
 on the other hand, were coupled
 with criticism of the "threat-
 ening notes" in recent speeches
 by x'estern leaders and by a re-
 newal of previous warnings that
 the USSR cannot allow the Ber-
 lin question to "drag on for
 years."  He attempted to increase
 the West's incentive to agree
 to early negotiations by warn-
 ing that the present Western
 attitude does not contribute
 f'o a "businesslike atmosphere
 for negotiations"  and that,
 under these circumstances, the
 conclusion of a separate treaty
 with, East Germany "may prove to
 be the only way out of the pres-
 ent' situation."

 Italian ambassador informed
 the US Embassy that Foreign
 Minister Gromyko was "alarming-
 ly complacent" on Berlin in a
 recent conversation.  Gromyko
 disagreed with the ambassador''s
 remark that Soviet policy is
 bound to stir up Western reac-
 tion and that the situation
 could become dangerous;  on
 the contrary, he said there would
 be no important reaction., and
 that, if there are no negotia-
 tions, the USSR would simply
 sign a separate treaty which
 would end Allied rights in
 Berlin.
 Military Budget
 Khrushchev made it clear
 in his speech that the increase
 in the Soviet military budget
 and the suspension of force
 reductions were designed to
 counter measures by the US and
 its NAT? allies to build up
 their forces.  He noted that
 President Kennedy had proposed
 a $3.5~billion increase in US
 military expenditures and prob-
 ably  anticipated that his fig-
 ure of a 3,144,000,000 ruble
 increase in Soviet military
 allocations would be reported
 in the Western press as equiva-
 lent--as indeed it is according
 Rio the official rate.
 Khrushchev's announcement
 conveys       the impression that  the
 increase is to be a net addition.
 It is unlikely, however, that
 such a large increase in mili-
 tary spending, equal to ~5 per-
 cent of the original 1961 total,
 could actually be used over the
 next six months.  The real dollar
 equivalent to the claimed ruble
 increase depends heavily on
 which specific military goods
 or services the Soviets might
 procure, but could be well in
 excess of _the valuation at
 the official rate.
 The additional funds need-
 ed to pay military forces now
 to be kept on active duty,
 rather than demobilized, is
 about half a billion rubles.
 The remaining: 2.6 billion
 would represent about a 60-per-
 cent addition to Soviet outlays
 for military procurement and
 construction as estimated for
 all of 1961.
 A long lead time is need-
 ed for the sharp expansion of
 sophisticated weapons systems,
 such as the ICBM, and Khrushchev
 was referring to the additional
 expenditures in the context of
 a cash outlay, i:e., money to
 be spent during the budget peri-
 od~d.  Khrushchev could, of course,
 step up the procurement of con-
 ventional weapons, such as tanks
 and fighter aircraft, currently 25X1
 being produced in Soviet muni-
 tions plants operating far below
 capacity.
 23
 Ify as seems likely, the
 announcement wad made primarily
 for political effect, certain
 budget items would be reclassi-
 fied as "military," a relatively
 simple matter. For example, most
 spending for military research
 and development now is concealed
 in other parts of the budget,
 and by itself amounts to about
 ~.8 billion rub7.cs.
 New military expenditures
 in 1961 on the order reported
 by Khrushchev would have a
 significant impact on invest-
 ment and/or consumption goals.

 If the impact were to fall on
 investment, the over-all rate
 of Soviet economic growth would
 decline sharply, thereby push-
 ing off into the future Khru-
 shchev's much-vaunted program
 of catching up with the US.
 birth rate was evident in the
 slow growth of the working-age
 population.  Since last year,.
 however, the number of persons
 reaching working age is .again
 rising and the relative impor-
 tance of demobilization as a
 source of civilian labor is
 diminishing.
 Suspension of Force. Reduction
 Khrushchev?s statement
 merely publicizes a step prob-
 ably taken several months ago.
 There have been several public
 hints that the program to re-
 duce Soviet armed manpower from
 3,623,000 to 2,423,000 in 1960
 and 1961 might have to be cur-
 tailed.  It is believed that
 the reductions a~e~about half
 completed and that Soviet armed
 manpower, excluding internal
 security forces, now totals
 about 3,000,000?
 Suspension of demobiliza-
 tion, which could reduce the
 expected net additions to the
 civilian Labor force this -year
 by one fifth, will probably re-
 quire Moscow to find alternative
 sources of labor.  Planned ex-
 pansion of high school enroll-
 ment may be delayed to make
 more teen-e.gers available for
 work, and further steps may be
 takento induce a greater per-
 centage of women to enter the
 labor force.
 Probably the most direct
 and immediate effect of the
 suspension will be felt in the
 frontier areas of the USSR
 where labor shortages are a
 perennial problem,  It was to
 these areas t~ia~t  last  year's
 demobilized soldiers were
 strongly  urged  to  go.
 Aviation Day Air Shgw
 During the Aviation Day
 air show of 9 July, the first
 significant air show since 1956,
 a number of aircraft were pub-
 licly displayed for the first
 time, as well as air-to-air
 missiles (AAgs) and air-to-sur-
 face-missiles (ASMs).  Despite
 Khrushchev's disparaging remarks
 about aircraft in recent years,
 Marshal of Aviation Sergey
 Rudenko, deputy .commander in
 chief of the Soviet Air Force,
 said the main ob~sct of the
 display was to "demonstrate the
 might of Soviet aviation;."
 Similar saeasures, to-
 gether with reductions ~n the
 armed forces, since. 1955 have
 enabled civilian employment to

 East German tittitudes
 In a speech to the East
 German People's. Chamber on 6
 July, Walter Ulbricht echoed
 Khrushchev's emphasis on the
 possibility of a negotiated
 settlement of the German and
 Berlin issues.  He did not pre-
 clude, however, "Certain tem-
 porary sacrifices" by the East
 Germans in the event that a
 separate treaty is signed--a
 reference to the threat of
 WestA?~ierman  economic  counter-
 measures.
 Apparently anticipating
 a summer of heightened tension,
 -the regime reportedly has is-
 sued an order canceling summer
 leave plans of party function-
 ar ms in East Berlin through
 August on grounds that the
 present political situation
 requires that all officials
 remain at their posts in the
 next weeks.- Concurrently the
 regime instituted harsher poli-
 cies to deter East Berliners
 from working in West Berlin by
 threatening them with severe
 economic sanctions, and took
 steps to reduce attendance by
 East Germans at the forthcoming
 Evangelical Church congress in
 West Berlin.
 West German Views
 Mayor Brandt's suggestion
 on 7 July that the West con-
 . Sider calling a peace confer-
 ence of the 52 "anti-Hitler
 coalition'" nations has evoked
 sharp criticism by Chancellor
 Adenauer.  Addressing a politi-
 'i cal rally in Munich on 9 July,
 Adenauer scoffed at Brandt's
 support of a "super conference"
 with the comment:  "For heavens
 sake, what would come of that?"
 The chancellor stated that men-
 tion of an "arm-free" zone in
 central Europe recalled the
 Rapacki Plan, "which we have
 discussed and which does not
 provide security for anyone
 and only makes us a second-rate
 nation."

 Adenauer also rejected
 Khrushchev?s statement that con-
 clusion of a peace treaty with
 both parts of Germany is the
 most important problem, and
 asserted once again that con-
 trolled disarmament should come
 first.  Using much stronger
 language, Defense Minister
 Strauss on 8 July scornfully
 dismissed all plans, ideas,
 and concepts for a solution of
 the German problem as "hacus-
 pocus" and asserted that con-
 ferences with the Soviets had
 proved detrimental or worthless,
 Brandt believes that a
 large-scale conference could
 be one way for the West to
 seize the initiative from Khru-
 shchev and confront the USSR
 with the self-determination
 issue,  He also favors prepara-
 tion of a peace treaty draft
 to be presented as a positive
 alternative to the Soviet pro-
 posals and suggests that the
 questions of armament reduction
 and an atom-free zone are nego-
 tiable if accepted by both sides
 and not injurious to the securi-
 ty of either.
 Brandt also endorses the
 statement of Bundestag Presix~ent
 Eugene Gerstenmaier favoring
 any negotiations which: might
 lead to a peace treaty on the
 basis of German self-determx-
 nation.  Gerstenmaier presented
 a formal bipartisan declaration
 of the Bundestag on 30 June
 which, while flatly rejecting
 Moscow?s proposal for direct
 talks between best and East
 Germany, celled for peace
 treaty negotiations which would
 predetermine the military and
 political status of a reunited
 Germany.  The statement also
 pledged West German readiness
 to give any reasonable guaran-
 tee that a reunified Germany
 would be "a reliable partner
 of all their neighbors."
 Adenauer disapproved the
 Gerstenmaier statement, espe~
 cially the inplication that
 it represented a common foreign
 policy between the Christian
 Democratic Union (CDU) and the
 Socialists.  Subsequently, the
 CDU executive committee adopted
 a formal proposal advocating "a
 reunited Germany with a free
 democratic constitution, inte-
 grated in the European commu-
 nity.,'
 Although Brandt has fre-
 quently expressed privately his
 desire that the West seize the
 initiative  by making its own
 proposals rather than merely
 concentrating exclusively on re-
 butting Soviet arguments, his
 proposals are probably partly
 motivated by  a  desire  to  embar-
 rass Adenauer--his opponent in
 the September national elections
 --who continues to take a pessi-
 mistic view of new negotiations
 on Berlin,  Meanwhile, in a
 reply to the 1? February Soviet
 note on Berlin, Bonn declared
 on 12 July that a German peace
 treaty must depend on the readi-
 ness of  the  USSR to  allow free
 elections in East Germany, and
 asserted that a separate Soviet
 treaty with East Germany "would
 violate the right of self-
 determination of peoples."  The
 note stated that a peace treaty
 with a single German government
 resulting from free elections
 would settle problems concerning
 Germany, including Berlin and
 the German frontier  uestions

 Communist bloc delegates to
 the Geneva conference on Laos
 continue to press for a discus-
 sion of neutrality drafts and to
 denounce as "a device~to break
 up the conference" Western de-
 mands for prior consideration of
 control mechanisms.
 Soviet delegate Pushkin was
 adamant on this point during an
 S July meeting with the chief
 British representative, who had
 proposed that "neutrality" and
 "controls" be discussed on al-
 ternate days.  Rejecting this
 compromise, Pushkin launched in-
 to an hour-long tirade against
 Western-backed proposals for
 strengthening the International
 Control Commission (ICC) and
 gave no indication that he would
 accept even an Indian proposal
 which would incorporate in one
 document a declaration on neu-
 trality and articles on control.
 Political developments in.
 Laos continue to await  agree-
 ment on the site and timing of
 coalition talks between the
 three princes.  In reply to Vien-
 tiane's invitation to Souvanna
 and ~ouphannouvong to resume
 talks in Luang Prabang, Souphan-
 nouvong has suggested that the
 three leaders assemble in Namone;
 Vientiane is expected to propose
 that the meetings be held in
 Phnom Penh,
 General Phoumi has been
 gradually pushing his program
 designed to influence the forma-
 tion of a new government.  His
 address to the National Assembly
 on 11 July outlining the govern-
 ment's position was the first
 step in a plan by which he hopes
 the assembly will endorse a
 turnover of full powers to the
 King, avoiding a formal disso-
 lution of the assembly which
 would require early elections.
 The Communists seem deter-
 mined to drag out the conference
 deliberations on this procedural
 issue, while Souvanna Phouma and
 the Pathet Lao continue to
 strengthen their political posi-
 tion preparatory to the next
 round of talks between the three
 princes in Laos.
 In a conversation with Am-
 bassador Harriman in Rome prior
 to his return to Phnom Penh,
 Cambodian Premier Sihanouk ap-
 peared discouraged over events
 in Geneva and Zurich and offended
 that his draft compromise on the
 ICC had been turned down by both
 sides at Geneva.  Commenting
 that he could "no longer be of
 value, "  Sihanouk  expressed the
 opinion that the Pathet Lao
 vrould never accept a subordinate
 position in a Laotian government
 or agree to integrate their
 forces.  He said that Chinese
 Communist Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi had stated that under no cir-
 cumstances would the Chinese
 agree to a control commission
 with real authority, even if the
 Laotians themselves accepted
 such controls.
 Both Phoumi and Premier
 Boon Oum have implied publicly
 that Souvanna would be unac-
 ceptable as head of a new gov-
 ernment, but it is doubtful that
 Phoumi has persuaded the King to
 assume this role himself.  Phoumi
 this week is touring southern
 Laos and later will go to Luang
 Prabang to build up support for
 his plan.
 mince his return from Eu-
 rope, Premier Boun Oum's mood
 has been described as one of
 discouragement over his en-
 counters with Souvanna and 5ou-
 phannouvong.  He too is in
 southern Laos--on personal mat-
 ters--and may be absent from
 Vientiane for an extended period.
 A top Vientiane official told
 Ambassador Brown that Boun Oum
 seemed to be washing his hands
 of state affairs and to want no
 part in a future government.
 According to Indian Ambas-
 sador Ratnam, Boun Oum recently

 FRANCE-ALGERIA
 De Gaulle's 12 July address
 added little detail to his pre-
 vious statements on Algeria.
 His intent seemed to be to im-
 press the PAG and world opinion.
 as well as the French public
 with the urgency he attaches to
 an early termination of France's
 commitments there, by one means
 or another, in light of the dan-
 ger for the free world as the
 Berlin crisis intensifies.
 There are other indications,
 however, that the French negoti-
 ating position will be somewhat
 more flexible whenever talks
 with the PAG are resumed at Evian.
 De Gaulle and other French of-
 ficials have pointedly avoided
 the word "partition" in their re-
 cent references to last-resort
 solutions.  His 12 July defini-
 tion of "regroupment" bears out
 earlier references to concentra-
 tion of Europeans pending evac-
 uation of all who care to leave.
 "France's chief negotiator,
 Minister of State for Algerian
 Affairs Louis Joxe, told an
 American Embassy official in
 Paris on 6 July that negotiations
 would be renewed "shortly," and
 reportedly was positive in his
 view that most of the issues on
 which the Evian talks appeared
 stalled were in fact negotiable.
 He suggested that a private con-
 versation with the top PAG ne-
 gotiator, Belkacem Krim, might
 be a means of breaking the ice.
 Joxe's statement that he
 would first take up the .~ahara
 issue and that he felt the rebels
 were more interested in a
 "moral victory" on this point in
 the form of political sovereignty
 rather than in the "material"
 side suggests that the French
 are preparing to discuss the
 PAG's Saharan claims as a means
 of getting negotiations under way
 again.  He considered that ar-
 rangements are possible which
 would not deprive France of oil
 and gas revenues.
 Joxe made no reference, how-
 ever, to the difficulties which
 would arise over the Sahara if--
 as press and political observers
 speculate--he insists on retain-
 ing the French missile test range
 at Colomb-Bechar and perhaps
 other facilities including nuclear
 weapons test sites.  Joxe also
 said the PAG is prepared to work
 out means for French retention
 of the naval base at Mers-el-
 Kebir.  In view of the PAG's
 declared intention of adopting
 a "non-alignment" foreign policy
 once independenoeis achieved,
 Joxe's optimism as to prospects
 for base negotiations seems
 premature.:
 PAG leaders, though dis-
 appointed that De Gaulle in his
 12 July speech failed to signal
 any French concessions, will
 nevertheless persist in their
 opposition to a settlement on
 the basis of present French pro-
 posals.  Despite De Gaulle's re-
 peated threat to regroup the
 Algerian population failing an
 agreement on Algerian associa-
 tion with France, the rebels will
 continue to insist that France
 reverse its position enunciated
 at Evian that the disposition of
 the Sahara is a question apart
 from an Algerian settlement.
 They will also continue their
 efforts to undercut the French
 position by mustering North
 African and other African support
 for PAG demands.
 PAG leaders at the same
 time have continued to emphasize
 that once talks are resumed the
 PAG is prepared to make conces-
 sions on the issues of guarantees
 for the European settler community,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 French retention of military
 bases, and preferential economdc
 cooperation with France, in re-
 turn for French recognition of
 Algerian territorial integrity
 and sower       inclu  n  the
 25X1   Sahara.
 ope    o ma a proposa s
 on these issues "sufficiently
 concrete and attractive" to en-
 able France to recognize Algeri-
 ~.n sovereignty over the Sahara.
 llhile voicing adamant op-
 position to partition of Algeria
 and amputation of the Sahara,
 PAG Deputy Premier Belkacem
 Krim said twice publicly in Libya
 that the PAG was. prepared to
 grant  the French community in
 Algeria "full rights in accord=
 ante with the sovereignty and
 dignity of the Algerian. people."
 PAG leaders continue to insist
 that once the Sahara problem is
 solved, they see no other major
 obstacles to a rapid settlement.
 The PAG, is an effort to
 continue pressure on the French,
 has reportedly called a full-
 scale meeting of the 62-member
 National Council of the Algerian
 Revolution for some time in Au-
 gust.  They say the meeting will
 probably result in a new and
 tougher PAG leadership.  While
 such a meeting is certain in the
 event of a breakdown of negotia-
 tions, the -~ebels have indicated
 the meeting  can be deferred if
 talks resume.
 Strained PAG-Tunisian rela-
 tions were apparently at the root
 o~ several reports that the PAG
 intended to move its headq~~arters
 from Tunis to Rabat.  PAG Min-
 ister of Information Yazid pub-
 licly characterized these reports
 as "ridiculous," saying that the
 PAG was not going to move any-
 where but into Algeria.
 In contrast to the apparently
 unproductive talks the PAG held
 with Tunisian leaders on 1 July
 regarding Tunis' Saharan claims,
 a delegation headed by PAG Pre-
 mier Ferhat Abbas worked out at
 least a tactical arrangement
 with Morocco.  The PAG-Moroccan
 communique of 7 July noted Moroc-
 co's "unconditional" support for
 PAG efforts to maintain the
 integrity of Algerian territory,
 its opposition to any attempts
 to "partition or amputate"
 Algeria, and--skirting the is-
 sue of Morocco's claims to
 Saharan areas--declared tha t
 boundary problems were the con-
 cern of the two states alone.

 cials in Rabat expressed
 the
 ing  in general terms Morocco's
 25X1
 v~Yew to US officials that
 Hassan II had extracted a
 King
 secret
 claims to the Sahara and some
 support of Morocco's claims to
 Mauritania.
 The Arab League Council
 meeting in Cairo on 12 July
 reached a temporary impasse on
 Kuwait's membership in the
 League.  Kuwait's insistence
 that its independence be guaran-
 teed by the League may be re-
 solved by the stationing of Arab
 troops-excluding those  of  the
 UAR and Iraq--in Kuwait in place
 of British forces now there.
 However, Iraq has charged this
 would be tantamount to occupa-
 tion of part of Iraq by Arab
 forces.
 Publicity on the Kuwait
 issue has been largely supplanted
 on Baghdad x adio by details of
 the preparations for the cele-
 brations on 14 July of the third
 anniversary of the Iraqi Revolu-
 tion.  While maintaining its
 claim to Kuwait as Iraqi terri-
 tory, the Baghdad regime has re-
 iterated that recovery of the
 "lost province" will be carried
 out by peaceful means.  Press
 stories that British technical
 employees of,the Iraq. Petroleum
 Company (IPC) will be replaced
 by Italians have been formally
 denied by the Iraqi oil min-
 ister.  It is improbable that

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 CONGO
 Negotiations centering an
 the composition of a new govern-
 ment are continuing between rep-
 resentatives of the Leopoldville
 government and the Stanleyville
 regime.  Recent actions by the
 central government, however,
 indicate that it is attempting
 to accommodate Gizenga where
 possible.  On 7 July,the cen-
 tral government acceded to one
 of his long-standing demands by
 returning to Stanleyville seven
 pro-Gizenga deputies who had
 been under detention in Leopold-
 ville.
 The current pace of nego-
 tiations makes it unlikely that
 parliament will open on 1? July,
 the date for which the Chamber
 of Deputies has been called into
 session by its presiding officer.
 Army chief Mobutu has re-
 iterated his support for a meet-
 ing of parliament, and has
 stated that he desires to keep
 the army out of politics.  Mem-
 ories of ~Cobutu's 1960 coup--
 which was prompted by annoyance
 with the inability of Congolese
 politicians to establish a stable
 government--nevertheless have
 inspired some uneasiness in Leo-
 poldville.  One pro-Gizenga
 spokesman has expressed the fear
 that "army elements" might at-
 tempt a coup should parliament
 approve a government not accept-~
 able to them.  Tshomb~'s ap-
 parent intent to boycott parlia-
 ment poses the threat that pro-
 Gizenga forces will be able to
 control parliament.
 Mobutu appears to have been
 balked in his campaign to re-
 unite the Congolese Army under
 his own authority. Kasavubu on
 6 July repeated Mobutu's assur-
 ances of amnesty for pro-Gizenga
 forces in return for their rec-
 ognition of the authority of the
 central government; however,
 General Lundula in Stanleyville
 in a statement of 11 July said
 merely that he would place his
 forces at the disposal of what-
 ever government emerges from the
 forthcoming session  of parlia-
 ment.
 In Elisabethville, Tshomb~
 used the occasion of Katanga's
 11 July "Independence Day" to
 qualify his recent attacks on
 the Leopoldville government.
 He stated that Katanga favored
 "association" with the Congo,
 but implied that future "cooper-
 ation" did not extend to Katanga's
 subsidizing the Congo treasury.
 On 9 July, he told a UN official
 that he would not send a dele-
 gation to parliament without
 first attending a "summit"
 meeting of Congolese politicans,
 to be held outside the country.
 Such remarks suggest that he is
 returning to the delaying tactics
 with which he sought to neutral-
 ize moves  toward utlity prior to
 his incarceration in  Leopold-
 ville.

 The Castro-controlled
 press and radio are increasing
 their build-up of the 26 July
 celebrations.  Foreign guests
 coming to Havana for the festiv-
 ities will include government
 officials and prominent personal-
 ities from Sino-Soviet bloc
 countries, Latin American nations,
 and other areas.
 Soviet space man Yuri
 Gagarin, who is scheduled to
 arrive in Cuba on 24 July, is
 the most widely publicized guest
 to be invited.  He is expected
 to play a prominent part in the
 proceedings.  Many leftists
 and Communists  froAi other Latin
 American countries are expected
 to receive expenses-paid trips
 to Cuba.  Some of those invited
 probably will remain in Cuba
 for several weeks or months for
 training in subversion, as has
 been the case with many previous
 visitors.
 An AFP dispatch from Havana
 on 3 July alluded to the recent
 creation of an interim revolu-
 tionary political organization
 composed of the Popular Socialist
 (Communist) party and the rem-
 nants of Fidel Castro's 26th
 of July movement.  Described
 as an organ to hasten the transi-
 tion to a single "party of the
 revolution," the new body is
 referred to as the "Integrated
 .evolutionary  Organizations"
 (OBI) and is alleged to be in
 charge of the preparations for
 the 26 July celebrations.  The
 report further suggested that
 the establishment of ORI secre-
 tariats, sections, and "revo-
 lutionary nuclei" was already
 an "accomplished fact."
 Such a development would
 constitute an important step
 in formalizing the dominant
 role of the Communist apparatus
 in the Castro regime.  Castro
 and other regime leaders have
 frequently stated that such a
 union is necessary for  the
 "building of socialism" in Cuba.
 Latin American Communist
 leaders reportedly plan to hold
 a meeting of labor leaders in
 Havana at the time of the 26
 July celebrations in an attempt
 to prepare an organizational con-
 gress for a new hemisphere labor
 confederation.  Communist leaders
 are scheduled to meet separately
 in  Havana but will also devote
 their attention to planning
 the new labor body.  The meet-
 ings reflect a two-year Communist
 drive to promote a new regional
 labor organization which would
 replace the ineffective CTAL,re -
 gional affiliate of the Communist
 WFTU and which would exclude the
 participation of US labor rep-
 resentatives.
 The prospects for the
 success of the Communist pro-
 posal appear poorer now than
 in 1959, partly because of in-
 creased awareness of Castro's
 ties with the bloc and the de-
 cline of his prestige among or-
 ganized labor groups since that

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Mobs incited b the pro-
 Castro Dominican Popular Move-
 ment (MPD) staged violent dem-
 onstrations in Ciudad Trujillo
 on 7 July in the first signifi-
 cant political action since the
 Trujillo assassination.  The
 mobs, provided with incendiary
 materials, sacked and burned
 the studios of Radio Caribe,
 which prior to its recent re-
 organization had been closely
 identif iec~ with the most  f anat-
 ical element backing the late
 dictator.
 Although  the B~iPD  is  prob-
 ably still small iri membership,
 its aggressive agitation last
 week--as well as during a brief
 period of activity permitted it
 by the late dictator last summer
 --undoubtedly appeals to Domini-
 cans anxious for the immediate
 elimination of all traces of
 Trujilloism and impatient with
 the extreme caution thus far
 shown by other opposition groups.
 A Dominican student is reported
 to have said last month that
 students are so anxious for the
 overthrow of the regime that
 they would support a Castro-
 sponsared invasion if they had
 a chance and would "worry about
 the consec~uenees later."
 Also, by taking the lead in
 anti-Tr~illo  opposi.tiah and by
 exhibitYng a potential for mob
 action, the Mp1'has strengthened
 its  bargaining position  for  sig-
 nificant influence in any coali-
 tion of apposition groups.  It
 is already seeming to ally it-
 self with the clandestine "14th
 of June Movement," a. group b
 undetermined  pt~litical orienta-
 tion with at least some member-
 ~hip in the middle class.
 The ? July violence com-
 pletely overshadowed the initial
 efforts by three leaders of the
 Dominican Revolutionary party
 (PRA) to form an brganizatiori
 within the Dominican Republic.
 The P1tD,  a party  of  Dominican
 exiles with branches in the
 United states, Venezuela, and
 elsewhere in the Caribbean area,
 has close ties with such reform-
 ist Latin American leaders as
 V;,~neztxelan President  Betancourt
 and  former  Costa ~tican President
 Figueres.
 The three le~.de~s returned,
 after decades in exile, on 5
 July after secu~^ing guarantees
 from Balaguer  th~.t  they d-ould be
 permitted tb campaign freely fcr
 the promised electit5ris next day.
 Public gatherings addressed by
 the PRD leaders were org~,rized
 by the MPD,  which t~uick~.y stole
 the  Show .          A 'radio program from
 Cuba-~-the  f fret  of  # series  ens
 titled  "Patria Libre' sCl~eduled
 to be broadcast three times a
 week--strongly attacked the $RD
 leaders, and described them as
 "notorious agents" of the US
 M ate Department and the FBI.
 The potentially strong,
 basically moderate,,dpposition
 elements among the nbnliriican
 middle class--the principal
 victims of past '~rujillo terror
 --will remain 'wary of playing
 an active political role as long
 as the police state structure
 remains intact.
 The American consul, however,
 was informed on 10 July "in the
 strictest confidence," that a
 ~rou> of moderate professional
 and busif~es~ people plans Shortly
 L-o form a "Civic Front for ~a~

 stressed that he intended to
 act "within the law" and that
 the responsible opposition, in
 which he specifically incYuded
 the ~RD, would "enjoy coristitu-
 tional rights."
 In attempting to deal with
 the MPD threat w~.thout reversing
 his cautious efforts to create
 a more democratic climate in the
 country, Balaguer faces a deli-
 cafe task.  Undoubtedly, the ?
 July riots increased pressure
 within the regime for a return
 to past repressive tactics
 against ali opposition. The
 violent reprisals on 7 and 8
 July against the Mpb by the po-
 lice and by mobs organized by
 the government-GOntrolled Do-
 minican party were reminiscent
 of tactics employed by the late
 dictator and revealed that the
 old police mechanism remains
 basically unchanged.
 The American consul noted
 on 3 July that the steps taken
 by the regime. up to that point
 to reform the Trujillo system
 were. "encouraging," but he
 warned that their .net effect.
 should 'not be exaggerated. The
 most important reforms have been
 in the economic fie id and a~pe$r
 to~ reflect  at  .east  a  temporary
 reversal of -the late dictator's
 concerted effort during the last
 year of his life to destroy the
 economic base of the riiddle
 class.. Trujillo family monopo-
 lies in coffee., and cocoa exports
 have been broken up.  Price's
 have been cut on certain food-
 stuffs and utilities,"and con-
 aumers are commenting that the
 reductions are by the same
 amounts that formerly went to
 Trujillo.
 Until the violence of 7
 July,no new polit~ioal arrests
 or tortures had been reported
 for two weeks and activities by
 the secret police had been much
 less evident.  General Arturo
 ,Espaillat, one of the most brutal
 and corrupt Trujillo henchmen,
 has been stripped of all mili-
 tary and government posts.
 The new cabinet appointed
 by Balaguer on 5 Juiy replaced
 the one installed by the late
 dictator and appears to be made
 up of men of Balaguer's choice.
 None of the new appointees ex-
 cept the armed forces secretary
 is believed intimately linked
 t o the Trujillo  family .  The  ne~v
 foreign minister, Ambrosio
 Alvarez, is a lawyer and former
 member of the Dominican UN dele-
 gation who has had many years
 of experience in the Foreign
 Ministry. American officials have
 found. him friendly and coopera-
 tive in the past. The appointees
 include no leading anti-Trujillo
 figures, but at least two of
 them are close relatives of dis-
 sidents implicated in opposition
 plotting last year.
 Although President-Balaguer
 has assured American officials
 that he intends to be President
 in fact as well as in name, it
 is still unknown  how much lib-

 was probably intended to give
 him a chance to investigate at
 first hand the inefficiencies
 and shortages of building ma-
 terials and equipment which have
 plagued the construction pro-
 gram at various locations
 throughout the country.
 One objective of Kosygin's
 trip may have been to head off
 the possibility of a disturb-
 ance similar to that which oc-
 curred in Karaganda in 1959 when
 military action was required to
 end a strike over poor working
 and living conditions.  This is
 suggested by a letter published
 on 16 June in an official So-
 viet construction newspaper.
 The letter, signed by 19
 construction workers and offi-
 cials, spoke bitterly of "mad-
 house" conditions at Kuybyshev
 construction sites.  It com-
 plained about shortcomings in
 planning work schedules, about
 supply failures whidh caused
 illegal requisitioning, and
 about lack of coordination be-
 tween local and national organ-
 izations.  It blamed primarily
 the local construction directo-
 rate and asked whether there
 were such conditions elsewhere.
 Kosygin's stay in Kemerovo
 was accompanied by a press ar-
 ticle reporting nonfulfillment
 of the 1960 coristructiori plan
 in that area and lags in the
 42 "especially important proj-
 ects" them.  Poor working and
 living conditions were suggested
 by the statement that last year,
 in one construction trust in
 Stalinsk, 3,348 workers were
 hired but 1,91$ quit.
 There have alsb been spe-
 cific reports of lagging con-
 struction in Saratov Oblast.
 All three areas are undergoing
 rapid industrial expansion, and
 each has several installations
 with substantial military as-
 signments.
 While Kosygin visited sev-
 eral types of industrial con-
 struction sites in each area, he
 seemed to concentrate on the
 chemical industry, in which con-
 struction difficulties have been
 pronounced.  Just prior to
 Kosygin's trip the chairman of
 the State Committee of Chemistry
 warned that only ten of 68 proj-
 ects  slated for top-priority
 effort this year were on sched-
 ule at the end of April.
 Large investments in the
 chemical industry in the first
 two years of the Seven-Year Plan
 have resulted in significant
 production increases, but these
 are still short of the 15-16 per-
 cent rate of increase needed an-
 nually to meet the plan.  The in-
 dustry has been harassed by a
 continual lag in development of
 new technological processes,
 sporadic shortages of skilled
 labor and electric power, short-
 comings in planning, and short-
 ages of chemical equipment.
 An early repercussion of
 Kosygin's trip was the firing of
 a secretary of the party committee
 for the city of Kuybyshev for
 allowing his brother to build a
 personal dacha with state build-
 ing materials and labor.  Before
 it has run its course, the purge
 there will probably involve
 party and government leaders of
 both the city and oblast, in-
 cluding the sovnarkhoz and the
 police.  Similar purges will
 probably take  p

 CURRENT  INTELLIGENCE ; NEEKL`Y" ~'~J'1~fARY
 The  late  play  issue  of  the
 authoritative  party journal Kom-
 munist came out against the
 wholesale conversion of collec-
 tive farms into state farms, ap-
 parently setting the official
 line in the high-level contro-
 versy over the development of
 the Soviet farm system.  As a
 result, the pace of conversions
 --except possibly in the crucial
 New Lands and in areas around
 large cities--will probably slow
 down .from the high rate reported
 fan 1960.  Pressures to tailor
 the collective farm (kolkhoz)
 more closely to the state farm
 (sovkhoz) pattern may also les-
 sen for the time being.
 Communist ideology has us-
 ually maintained that state farms
 are more efficient than collec-
 tive farms and closer to the
 ideal "aIl-national" property.
 come economists have been arguing
 that because the USSR has en-
 tered the "transition to commu-
 nism," it is time to speed the
 rate of conversions to the "high-
 er" state farm model, and that
 this will solve the chronic prob-
 lem of unprosperous 1{olkhozes.
 come officials began pushing con-
 versions,with the result that the
 number of state farms jumped from
 6,500 to ?,400 in 1960.  Fir.st-
 quarter reports for 1961 indi-
 cate that conversions in the New
 Lands have continued at a high
 rate.
 Dmitry Polyansky, party
 presidium member and premier of
 the RaFSR, attacked mass conver-
 sions in his speech to the cen-
 tral committee plenum in January,
 but the issue apparently was not
 resolved at that time. Other high
 officials have recently condemned
 the practice of converting weak
 kolkhozes into state farms in
 order to shift to the state the
 burden of improving their economy.
 Pre~:~:~  articles  are  again  pointing
 out the comparatively high costs
 and low yields of state farms in?
 important agricultural areas.
 In May, :communist threw its
 weight to the side of those offi-
 cials and economists who support
 vigox?ous development of collec-
 tive farms--along with the state
 farms--for  some:  time  to  come.
 Kommunist declared the tend-
 ency  toward "indiscriminate"
 conversions to be "deeply in-
 correct"  and  ax?gued  that  its
 proponents ignore the great
 potentialities which the kolkhoz
 system still has for increasing
 agriculture output.  These
 people also were said to ignore
 "the h;_gh state expenditures
 necessary fox? such a reoganiza-
 tion."  The journal cited Khru-
 shchev's speech to the 21st
 party congress to the effect
 that collective and state farms
 would  eventually be merged by
 gradually transforming the col-
 lective  fax?ms  into  a  new,  still
 undefined, organizational form
 through interkolkhoz coopera-
 tion and larger allocations of
 farm income to capital invest-
 ments.
 Kommunist even argued that
 the time  or eliminating kolkhoz
 private plots--a definite Commu-
 nist goal--"has not yet come and
 will not come as soon as some
 people imagine."  At present,
 when many kolkhozes cannot guar-
 antee theif~ farmers sufficient-
 ly high incomes from the communal
 sector and when many towns still
 depend on private plots for food
 supplies, some overly zealous
 officials have added to agri-
 cultural difficulties by ar-
 bitrarily cixtting back private
 farming.
 Kommunist, along with Party
 Life, has also rejected as pre-
 mature the drive--which gained
 momentum in 1959--to make
 ko1L-:~ozes resemble sovkhozes
 by paying collective farmers
 the guaranteed monthly cash
 wages of state farm workers.
 Kommunist attacked the "incor-
 rect view" that the distribution
 of collective farm income on
 the basis of "labor days" im-
 pedes growth and that high
 monthly cash payments--as yet
 accomplished on only relatively
 few farms--are a universal cure.
 It argued that the introduction
 of monthly cash wages has led
 to losses on weak kolkhozes
 which lack steady cash reserves.
 Many of these farms have had
 to return to the "labor-day"
 system.        (Con-

 EAST GERMAN MOVES TO COUNTER EVANGELICAL CHURCH CONGRESS
 East Germany is stepping
 up its moves against the Evan-

 to 23 July.  In an effort to~

 aim of weakening the ties be-

 East and West Germany, the re-

 induce them to boycott the con-

 "militaristic" West German cler-
 gymen.  It has also refused
 to run special trains for West
 German participants; no measures
 barring bus or air travel have
 been announced to date.  However,
 West Berlin officials are making
 tentative plans for some 50
 special flights to Berlin in the
 event East Germany stops buses
 chartered for Kirchentag dele-
 gates.
 On 8 July, the East Berlin
 police president formally banned
 sessions of the Kirchentag in
 the Soviet sector--a move de-
 signed to silence claims of
 church members that no East Ger-
 man law forbids them to attend.
 The new measure does not, how-
 ever, indicate whether the re-
 gime will forbid religious serv-
 ices in the Evangelical cathedral
 in East Berlin, a step it has
 been reluctant to take.  Church
 officials have canceled all but
 religious services in East Berlin.
 On 11 July, apparently pur-
 suant to the new order, East Ger-
 man police in Rostock District
 halted Bishop Friedrich Krum-
 macher of Greifswald and seized
 his identity card, on grounds
 that he was en route to Berlin
 to attend a pre-Kirchentag meet-
 ing, which was prohibited.  Krum-
 macher was actually going to a
 meeting of the East German bish-
 ops' conference, of which he is
 chairman,
 Instead of intimidating the
 East German clergy, the move may
 have had the opposite effect:
 Bishop Moritz Mitzenheim, gen-
 erally considered pro-regime,
 reportedly sent a letter to
 Premier Grotewohl, "in the name
 of all the representatives of
 the church" in East Germany,
 protesting against "this meas-
 ure restricting a bishop in his
 duty, .even though the measure
 has meantime been withdrawn"--
 presumably by returning his
 identity card.  Nevertheless,
 the authorities will probably
 attempt to confiscate laymen's
 identity documents to keep them
 from traveling to Berlin.
 In its efforts to undercut
 the congress, the regime is
 handicapped by a desire to pre-
 sent an image of tolerance and
 reasonableness in support of
 the Soviet campaign for a nego-
 tiated settlement on West Berlin.
 There is even a possibility that
 the reversal of the police
 measures against Krummacher
 stemmed from Soviet action.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25X1
 Pastors are said to have com-
 plained to Soviet Embassy of-
 ficials investigating worker
 unrest at the Hennigsdorf plant
 near Berlin that the campaign
 against the Kirchentag was con-
 tributing to unrest.  The Soviet
 diplomats reportedly said
 Hennigsdorf woxkers would not
 be molested if they attended the
 Kirchentag.
 Under other circumstances,
 the East German government prob-
 ably would use the congress as
 an occasion for a showdown with
 the Evangelical Church--the only
 significant remaining all-German
 institution. In the absence of
 specific Soviet assent to harsher
 measures, however, the regime
 may limit its harassments to co-
 ercion of its own population,
 barring selected nest Germans
 from traveling by road or rail
 to West Berlin, and imposing
 stronger controls at the Berlin
 sectors borders to reduce at-
 tendance at Kirchentag meetings.
 SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY IN ASIA
 Heightened activity by
 Moscow and Peiping in relation
 to the Asian Communist parties
 during the past few months re-
 flects the continued strain in
 Sino-Soviet relations, now ex-
 pressed in increased political
 and economic rivalry rather than
 in the doctrinal debates which
 characterized the peak of the
 dispute last year. Both powers
 apparently recognized the dan-
 gers to the international Com-
 munist movement inherent in the
 intemperate and open exchanges
 of last year and seem to have
 agreed at the Moscow conference
 in November to keep direct at-
 tacks at a minimum. Since then
 the two countries have carried
 their difference forward by vy-
 ing for support from individual
 Communist parties and regimes.
 While the Chinese were not
 able to move the larger Eastern
 European Communist parties away
 from close support for the So-
 viet Union-, they can consider
 Albania`s opposition to Khru-
 shchev?s general policiea a
 signal success.  In addition,
 China has significantly increased
 its influence over the past few
 years among the Asian satellites.
 Now Moscow, with the example of
 Albania fresh in mind, has ap-
 parently turned its attention
 to the task of consolidating
 its position with the important
 Communist parties of Asia.
 The current attendance by
 party presidium member M. A.
 Suslov at the Mongolian Com-
 munist party's 14th party con-
 gress and the 40th anniversary
 of the Mongolian People's Re-
 public is merely the .latest
 in a series of bilateral visits
 between the Soviet party and

 Japanese Communist party congress  patty and support.  The conclu-
 at the end of this month.        ~ sion of the mutual defense treaty
 Suslov was the only im-
 portant foreign Communist to
 attend the Indian party con-
 gress, and he apparently played
 an important role.  Moderate
 elements backed by Moscow made
 important gains, which they con-
 solidated in the elections to
 the party's two top committees
 later in June.  The results of
 the congress and the make-up
 of the new leading bodies could
 hardly be looked upon with favor
 by Peiping.
 Moscow next turned its at-
 tention to North Korea, and the
 rapid .exchange of high-level
 delegations resulted in the an-
 nouncement on 6 July of a mutual
 defense treaty formally commit-
 ting the USSR to defend North
 Korea in the event of attack.
 Pyongyang has long desired a
 stronger Soviet commitment than
 Moscow has heretofore seemed -:.
 willing to give.  During his
 visit to North Korea, Kosygin
 had set the new tone by empha-
 sizing Moscow's unwavering
 support for North Korea's re-
 unification programo
 Kim-Il-lung's earlier dis-
 satisfaction with Moscow was
 possibly reflected in his fail-
 ure to attend the Moscow con-
 ference last November.  During
 the public Sino-Soviet dispute
 preceding the conference, North
 Korean editorial comment ap-
 peared sympathetic to the Chi-
 nese Communist viewpoint on  a
 variety of issues, and at the
 conference the North Korean
 delegate reportedly provided
 valuable support for China on
 these issues.
 Peiping's extension of a
 $105,000,000 loan to Pyongyang
 in early October was still fur-
 ther evidence of its intention
 to stimulate North Korean sym-
 between the USSR and North Korea
 clearly reflects Moscow's de-
 sire to counter Peiping's influ-
 ence there as well as Moscow's
 intention to appear responsive
 to Pyongyang's desire for great-
 er Soviet support.
 The formal treaty, which
 included a pledge to consult on
 all important international
 questions and to refrain from
 "participating in any coalitions
 or actin ns or measures directed"
 against the other party, also
 agreed to "develop and strengthen"
 economic ties between the two
 countries.  On his trip to North
 Korea, Kosygin was accompanied by
 Moscow's top negotiator for long-
 term economic programs with bloc
 countries, and recent announce-
 ments have indicated that an
 agreement has been concluded on
 the granting of new Soviet cred-
 its to North Korea,.
 Currently Moscow is de-
 voting much attention to the
 40th anniversary of the Mongo-
 lien People's Republic.  Not
 only is Suslov lending his
 prestige to the occasion but
 Poland's Gomulka, a stanch sup-
 porter of the Soviet Union, is
 also in attendance.  The material
 being presented by Moscow on the
 celebration stands in sharp con-
 trast to the paucity of its
 coverage of the recent 40th an-
 niversary of the Chinese party,
 and the message of the Soviet
 party to the Mongolian central
 committee. provides an equally
 sharp contrast to the carefully
 phrased, formal message to the
 Chinese party.
 An analysis of the messages

 nese party on its 40th anniver-
 sary gives an accurate index of
 their positions in the dispute,

 of the proper program the Jap-

 its congress later this month.
 The Chinese are reportedly plan-
 ning to send the highest ranking.
 delegation Peiping has ever sent
 to a Communist gathering outside
 the bloc.
 Earlier Peiping went to
 considerable lengths to impress
 the leader of the Indonesian
 party, Aidit, who had just
 visited Moscow.  Like the Japa--~
 nese, Aidit was honored with an
 audience with Mao Tse-tung, and
 the Chinese did not even scruple
 at displaying Aidit prominently
 at functions in Peiping honor-
 ing Sukarno.  According to cane
 report, the Chinese treated the
 Indonesian Communist leader as
 through he ranked just below
 Sukarno.
 The most dramatic Chinese
 move was the quick reaction to
 the 6 July Soviet - North Korean
 ,,.
 mutual defense pact.  Chinese
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi was
 in Moscow en route home from
 the Geneva conference when the
 Soviet-Korean treaty was an-
 nounced.  He conferred with Kim
 I1-sung the day of the signing
 and, on the following day, it
 was announced that Kim would
 pay a visit to Peiping, al-
 though that capital was not on
 his original intinerary.  When
 Kim arrived in Peiping on 10
 July, the Chinese turned out
 all their top leaders except
 Mao to give him a warm welcome,
 and half a million flag-waving
 Chinese cheered him on his way
 from the airport to the city.
 On 11 July the Chinese signed
 a mutual defense pact with~North
 Korea which is virtually identi-
 cal with the one Kim had just
 signed in Moscow.
 Like the Soviet pact, the
 Chinese treaty ,with North Korea
 mentions economic assistance,
 and it is possible that the
 Chinese, despite acute economic
 problems at home, may try to
 match the new aid Kim got in
 Moscow.  Soviet aid to North
 Korea has amounted to at least
 $700,000,000, mostly for eco-
 nomic construd~tion.  Chinese
 economic aid has totaled about
 $400,000,000, including the
 $1O5,000,000 credit extenlSed
 last fall.
 Whicle both the Chinese and
 the Soviets seem to be at pains
 to counter Western speculations
 of Sino-Soviet competition in
 this area, no protestations of
 "unity" can submerge the clear
 signs of their rivalry.  A set-

 issue or the content of the new

 The official silence sur-
 rounding economic developments
 in Communist China since last
 year continues to obscure the
 serious difficulties that grip
 both industry and agriculture.
 The regime apparently is still
 taking stock of industry, ad-
 justing  to its changed  economic
 relationship with the USSR,
 and awaiting the results of
 the  1961  harvest  before moving on
 to plans for further develop-
 ment.
 In industry, indications
 are that recovery from the ex-
 cesses of the "leap foward"
 period is not proving easy. Re-
 ports of production slowdowns
 and stoppages at individual
 plants began to appear in 1960
 and have been more numerous in
 1961.  Official statements con-
 tinue to reflect problems with
 raw material shortages, labor,
 and equipment.  Production at
 the Tangshan cement plant,
 China's largest, is reported
 to have dropped in 1961 to  a
 "small proportion" of normal.
 Machinery breakdowns and raw
 material shortages reportedly
 caused the closing of two large
 paper mills, and several rayon
 plants and tine factories ear-
 lier this year.  Numerous pro-
 duction stoppages,  sometimes  of
 extensive duration, have been
 reported from the textile cen-
 ter of Shanghai.
 There is little information
 on the situation in heavy in-
 dustry, but statements from Pei-
 ping concerning a "large-scale"
 campaign to overhaul equipment
 in the iron and steel industry,
 together with a switch to empha-
 sis on quality rather than quanti-
 ty, are interpreted to mean that
 steel production is down compared
 with the same period in 1960.
 Peiping has also complained of a
 lag in the extractive industries,
 especially for coal and iron ore,
 and warned of the possibility   25X1
 that these industries might fall
 "further behind" the demands of
 nrocessin~ industries-
 Peiping has also curtailed
 new construction in industry.
 Imports of machinery from the
 bloc--usually an important source
 of capital equipment--probably
 will fall more than 50 percent
 below the 1959 level in 1961.
 The current retrenchment
 program in industry--beyond an
 outright suspension of production
 at certain plants--probably en-
 tails significant slowdowns through-
 out industry in order to rebuild
 stockpiles of fuel and raw ma-
 terials and make major equipment
 overhauls.  This program and the
 continuing shortages of raw materi
 als,  parts, and manpower--includ-
 ing the depressive effect of food
 shortages on labor productivity--
 appear to characterize the sit-
 uationin industry so far in 1961.
 Peiping has not yet announced its
 industrial goals for this year,
 but there will probably be little
 or no  increase in heavy indus-
 trial production and significant
 declines in light industrial out-
 put, with total industrial output
 in 1961 probabl  below that in 1960.

 Approval of the new Turk-
 ish constitution in a national
 referendum on 9 July is a major
 step toward an eventual return
 to representative government.
 General Gursel--Chief of State
 and leader of the ruling mili-
 tary junta, the Committee of
 National Union (CNU), since
 last year's military coup--
 again promised parliamentary
 elections by mid-October in a
 statement issued on 7 July,
 According to present plans, the
 government will revert to civil-
 ian control immediately follow-
 ing elections.
 According to nearly complete
 official returns, approximately
 80 percent of the eligible voters
 went to the polls, and the con-
 stitution was approved by about
 60 percent of the votes cast--
 far below the percentage desired
 by the CNU, which had hoped to
 use the referendum as a vote of
 confidence.  Reports immediately
 prior to the referendum, however,
 indicated concern within the
 government about getting approv-
 al by even a bare majority.
 The CNU and most political
 parties had made an intensive
 effort to secure a large affirma-
 tive vote.  CNU members visited
 various parts of the country
 speaking in support of the new
 constitution.  The largest po~-
 litical party, the Republican
 People's Party (RPP), organized
 public meetings to acquaint the
 people with provisions of the
 constitution, and its leaders
 called  for  an  overt~vhelming "yes"
 vote.  Leaders of several smaller
 parties which will participate
 in the forthcoming elections
 also called for approval by
 the electorate.
 Only the new Justice party
 (JP) gave less than full support to
 the constitution;  its leaders
 charged that the document con-
 tained faults but emphasized
 that the final decision was
 up to the people.  However,
 the party's General Adminis-
 trative Board announced that it
 favored acceptance.
 The results of the refer-
 endum reflect both general voter
 apathy and, apparently, consid-
 erable disillusionment with the
 handling of government affairs
 during the past year by the
 CNU.  They can also be taken
 as indicating continued opposi-
 tion to the RPP and its antic-
 ipated  return to power following
 the elections.  The RPP was the
 ruling party after the Turkish
 revolution until 1950.
 Many of those opposed to
 both the CNU and the RPP are
 former supporters of the
 Democratic party (DP) of Adnah
 Menderes and Celal Bayar,
 ousted by the military coup in
 1960,  The largest number of
 negative votes in the referen-
 dum--in 11  of Turkey's 67
 districts a majority of the
 vote--came from former DP strong-
 holds.  The DP was outlawed
 following the coup  and many of
 its supporters are believed to
 have joined the Justice Party.
 Trials of the DP leaders
 continue but it now appears
 probable that they will end
 within a .few weeks.  Death
 sentences for many of the former
 leaders have been anticipated,
 and there is a continuing
 possibility of serious disorders
 if executions are carried out.

 POLITICAL STRIFE LIKELY IN NORTHERN RHODESIA
 African nationalists in
 Northern Rhodesia have called
 for a program of "immediate
 positive action" to protest
 recent British proposals. for a
 constitution for the protector-
 ate.  The program is likely to
 involve strikes and boycotts.
 Kenneth Kaunda, leader of the
 United National Independence
 party (UNIP), and his associates
 have urged their followers to
 refrain from violence.  However,
 influential extremists within
 the party, although they have
 subordinated ther~~selves to
 Hondura's program in public,
 continue to press in private for
 a more active campaign.
 Kaunda, moreover, is in-
 censed at his recent detention

 Africans whose following among

 Since the protectorate's
 other white-led parties have
 shown little vote-getting abl-

 faces a strong challenge within

 the UNIP is faced with the

 The British constitutional
 proposals envisage an extremely
 complicated electoral system--
 a Labor party spokesman termed
 it a "dog's breakfast"--which
 is designed to paper over racial
 differences and to give the
 balance of power to moderates
 of both races.  The implications
 of these proposals hinge on
 several unknowns, notably the
 final delimination of constit-
 uencies.  However, it appears
 that, while the constitution
 as originally outlined gave a
 slight edge to the UNIP and to
 Africans sympathizing with it,
 the revisions are shaded in
 favor of Sir Roy Welensky's
 American officials estima-
 ted that the UNIP has between
 300,000 and 400,000 dues-paying
 members and that nearly a million
 additional Africans would follow
 its lead.  It has extended its
 influence deep into the rich
 copperbelt area and dominates
 the African mine workers' union.
 It probably could disrupt much
 of the Northern Rhodesian econ-
 omy for a short period, par-
 ticularly if it can mobilize
 the mine workers behind its
 political aims.  Nevertheless,
 Britain probably will try to
 impose the revised constitution,
 even if the arrangements cannot
 last lon  without African support.

 THE COMMON MARKET AND AFRICA
 Considerable progress has
 been made in the last few weeks
 in preparation for the renegotia-

 links the former French, Italian,
 and Belgian territories of Af-
 rica with the European Common
 Market (EEC).  Sixteen of these
 seventeen countries--all of
 which have acquired full inde-
 pendence in the last four years--
 seem interested in extending
 their ties with the EEC after
 the present convention expires
 next year.  They are, however,
 demanding full political equal-
 ity with their EEC partners, and
 they may insist on continued
 preferential access to the EEC,
 despite the major disadvantages
 this may involve for competitors,

 to UT O.REP,~
 Of the various recent EEC-
 African contacts looking toward
 formal talks later this year,
 the most significant appears
 to have been the joint parlia-
 mentary meeting in Strasbourg
 late last month.  It was attended
 by representatives of the EEC
 assembly and by more than 100
 members of African parliaments,
 and was characterized by unusual
 unity among the Africans in
 presenting their demands and by
 eagerness on the part of the
 Europeans to satisfy them.  As
 a result, a five-point resolution
 was unanimously approved ca11-
 ing for negotiation of a series
 of new associative conventions,
 creation of new EEC-African
 institutions, and intensification
 of economic, technical, and
 cultural cooperation.
 Most observers consider
 this a hopeful outcome, but it
 was achieved at least in part
 by skipping rather lightly over
 some problems.  The Africans
 endorsed the idea, for example,
 that the association should be
 open to all African states, but
 --possibly with French coaching--
 added the proviso that no asso=
 ciate could also belong to
 another economic grouping having
 "incompatible objectives."  In
 effect, this would permit Ethio-
 pia or Liberia to seek EEC asso-
 ciation, but would exclude Ni-
 geria as long as it is a member
 of the Commonwealth,  It is
 apparently still assumed that,
 in the event Britain joins the
 Common Market, EEC and Common-
 wealth preferences enjoyed by
 the Africans will somehow be
 merged.
 Moreover, the conference
 left vague how deeply committed
 to retention of tariff prefer-
 ences the Africans themselves
 may feel.  Although the final
 resolution declared that the
 "principle of preferential tar-
 iffs cannot be placed in ques--
 tion," it also urged that eco-
 nomic  cooperation be promoted
 through stabilization of prices
 of tropical products and estab-

 market guarantees--which might
 be alternatives to the prefer-

 The  Africans,  therefore, may
 not be as wedded to .preferences
 as the French have claimed, but

 sition,  Lorr3on  is  planning  to
 trim spending overseas at the
 risk of jeopardizing established
 military and economic aid pol-
 icies.  In the first quarter of
 1961 the estimated balance-of-
 payments deficit reached an an-
 nual rate of  $'750, 000, 000 and in
 the year's first half--normally
 a favorable time--Britain's
 gold and dollar reserves fell.
 by $50,000,000.
 The Macmillan government
 has been no more successful than
 its predecessors in stimulating
 the slow-growing British econ-
 omy. It has apparently concluded
 that entry into the Common Mar-
 I~et would help. As an immediate
 palliative, new measures to re-
 strict domestic consumer demand
 will probably be introduced this
 month.  Chancellor of the Ex-
 chequer Lloyd in late June called
 for reducing government spend-
 ing overseas, especially mili-
 tart' spending in areas where for-
 eign exchange problems are in-
 volved.
 That  half  of  Britain's
 overseas forces stationed in
 Germany accounts for almost all
 of  the $220, 000, 000 'spent  an-
 nu~.lly for military ~ zieeds out-
 side the sterling area. The
 Ang1o-German arms purchase agree-
 rient concluded in late May ap-
 parently has done little to re-
 duce the urgency London attaches
 to the problem; Bonn's announce-
 ment on 5 July that it would
 spend $7,500,000 annually for
 five years on a European space
 project based on Britain'v Blue
 I Streak missile will not fully
 satisfy London's needs.
 The Macmillan government
 may be expected to press new re-
 quests for Bonn to offset the
 costs of maintaining the British
 Army of the Rhine; it will warn,
 despite agreement in principle
 on the desirability of building
 up NATO's conventional forces,
 that it may withdraw some of
 its 55,000 men if such aid is
 not forthcoming.
 Britain's intention to pro-
 vide increasing amounts  of
 ,economic aid to underdeveloped
 countries, especially in the
 Commonwealth, is also threatened.
 A British discussion with OECD
 experts in Paris  on  3 July
 brought general agreement that
 London should slow down the in-
 crease in aid.  Although  in
 his April budget speech Lloyd
 anticipated an increase in the
 $420,000,000 provided in grants
 and loans for underdeveloped
 areas last year-, it now is
 evident that new aid proposals
 will come under extremely close
 scrutiny.
 The US Embassy in London
 notes, however, that the British
 payments picture changes quick-
 ly  and that British  policy
 could  be altered  by evidence
 of  higher  productivity as a
 result of  recent  investment,
 by  better prices  for sterling
 area commodities, and by im-
 proved markets  in  the  United
 States  and  Euro e.

 MORALE IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Peiping's economic set-
 backs of the past two years
 have resulted in a general
 erosion of public confidence
 in the regime.  The promises
 made in 1958 for a better fu-
 ture after "three years of
 bitter struggle" are unful-
 filled.  The food shortages
 of the past year have made the
 people realize that living
 standards are falling, not
 rising.  The constant shifts
 in policy--although officially
 justified as the "dialectic"
 in action--confuse minor offi-
 cials.  The armed forces re-
 ceive preferential treatment
 in the form of better rations
 and are almost certainly de-
 pendable,but there have been
 several reports of sympathy
 shown by soldiers for the
 plight of civilians.
 discouraged by unrelenting pres-
 sure to put forth exhausting
 efforts which produced no real
 gains, and a general apathy and
 sullenness pervaded the coun-
 tryside.
 The food situation deteri-
 orated to such a point by early
 1961 that many peasants--as well
 as many urban dwellers--were re-
 duced to rations insufficient to
 maintain health.  At this point
 discipline in rural areas appar-
 ently began to break down. Many
 refugees reported a sharp rise
 in the incidence of petty theft--
 mainly of food--as well as sit-
 down and go-slow strikes.  There   25X1
 was much open grumbling and gen-
 eral defiance of the local author-
 ities.
 The Peasantry
 Despite the regime's at-
 tempt to put the whole blame
 for the food shortages on "na-
 tural calamities," it is obvi-
 ous to the peasant that much
 of the difficulty stems from
 official mismanagement.  The
 communes were bureaucratically
 top-heavy, agricultural labor
 was diverted to pretentious
 but economically unsound proj-
 ects, and farmers were given
 little authority or incentive.
 There are many reports that the
 implementation of Mao Tse-tung's
 "eight-point charter" for agri-
 culture--which called for such
 labor-intensive practices as
 deeper plowing and closer
 planting--decreased crop yields
 in many localities despite the
 additional work required of the
 farmers.  The farmers became
 Peiping's present inclina-
 tion is to take a conciliatory
 attitude toward the peasants,
 realizing that persistence of
 their present attitudes would
 defeat all measures to improve
 the food situation.  Last Sep-
 tember a 12-point directive was
 issued which ordered ''readjust-
 ments" in the commune system.
 The reforms include prohibitions
 against the use of force by of-
 ficials, insistence that the
 peasants be allowed eight hours
 of sleep a night, compensation
 for property confiscated when
 the communes were established,
 and permission to cultivate pri-
 vate plots.  The peasants wel-

 skeptical of whether they will
 actually be implemented in light
 of previous experience with
 fluctuations in the party line.
 Intelligentsia and Students
 In 1956-57, during the
 b.ri.ef  period- of. liberalization
 --under the slogan "let a
 hundred flowers bloom, let a~
 hundred schools of thought con-
 tend"--criticism of the regime
 and party was condoned.  The
 slogan let loose a deluge of
 antiregime commentary which
 appalled the leadership.  The
 result was an abrupt halt. to
 liberalization in the summer
 of 1957 and a ruthless "anti-
 rightist" repression during
 which many intellectuals were
 imprisoned.
 Since then Chinese Intel-
 lectuals have been careful to
 conceal their antiz~egime senti~
 menu. The regime, for its part,
 retains a certain wariness of
 the intellectuals for not hav-
 ing "surrendered their hearts
 to the party."  The National
 Congress of Writers and Artists
 held last August emphasized the
 urgent need to eliminate rem
 nants of bourgeois influence
 among the intelligentsia and
 in general to promote strict
 conformity with official views.
 Peiping's current policy
 is to ease restraints slightly
 but to guide debate carefully.
 The 1 March issue of Red Flag
 revealed that the party was
 reviving its ill-fated "hun-
 dred flowers" slogan.  Con-
 scious of the cynicism which
 attaches to that slogan, how-
 ever, Peiping, has added a
 new catch-phrase--the "meeting
 of immortals."
 Leading academic figures
 are invited to informal sem-
 inars of several days' duration
 designed to bring out a general
 endorsement of "correct" stand-
 ; points in the arts and sciences.
 i To this end the meetings are
 presided over by trusted party
 officials who are enjoined to
 avoid coercive techniques and
 rather to allow an atmosphere
 ~ of "gentle breeze and mild
 rain."  Peiping claims that
 much fruitful work has been ac-
 complished in this manner. The
 indications, nevertheless, are
 that the intelligentsia remains
 ~ suspect and circumspect.
 There is only scattered
 evidence on the attitude of the
 students.  Compared with the
 population as a whole, students
 are in a favored position and
 receive better rations
 tent.  here was apparen  y wi e-
 spread antipathy among students
 to the slogan "let politics take
 command," which discounted pro-
 fessional aptitude and learning
 in favor of political reliabil-
 ity.  Partly for this reason
 and partly to conserve the stu-
 dents' strength while rations
 were exceptionally short, the
 authorities dropped after-hours
 political indoctrination courses
 from the curriculum last winter,
 In one of several known in-
 stances of antiregime activity
 on the part of students, a slo-
 gan was found posted on the wall

 It compared Mao Tse-tung to
 Emperor Chin, who unified the
 country for the first time un-
 der a tyranny that ruthlessly
 redistributed the population,
 opened up virgin lands, burned
 books, and executed scholars.
 Party and Security Forces
 Important as are attitudes
 in the country at large, morale
 in the party and army is the
 crucial factor in any assess-
 ment of the stability of pres-
 ent leadership.  The basic com-
 mitment of these two key groups
 to the regime still appears
 strong, but there is some evi-
 dence of declining elan among
 enlisted men and members of
 party cadres, many of whom are
 sympathetic to the plight of the
 population.
 Members of both the army
 and party cadres receive higher
 food rations than the ordinary
 citizen.  Nonetheless both
 groups had their rations re-
 duced last winter, and in some
 areas cadres were asked to set
 an example to the citizenry in
 volunteering to "save" grain.
 This move was probably predicated
 as much on the official desire
 to curb popular resentment as
 on the need to save food, but
 to a certain degree it back-
 fired by stirring up discon-
 tent within the army and party.
 Public security personnel
 in Canton reportedly complained
 of inability to do their work
 well after ration cuts, and mil-
 itary guards stationed near the
 Hong Kong border on occasion
 professed to be too tired and
 too hungry to chase villagers
 trying to escape to the Crown
 Colony.  There are numerous
 reports that low-level offi-
 cials looked the other way when
 cases of petty theft came to
 their attention.
 Such officials have al-
 ways occupied an uncomfort-
 able seat within the power
 structure.  In case of trou-
 ble, they are blamed for "de-
 viating" from the party line;
 when things are going well,
 Peiping takes the credit.  Peri-
 odically the party launches
 rectification campaigns to "pu-
 rify?' its organization and make
 certain that policy is being
 correctly implemented.
 Such a rectification pro-
 gram has been carried out dur-
 ing the last six months, aimed
 principally at those "well-
 intentioned" cadre members who
 had implemented directives in
 an overly zealous fashion--i.e.,
 deviated to the "left."  Inves-
 tigation and objectivity have
 been the keynotes of the cam-
 paign.  As a May issue of a
 Peiping newspaper says in ad-
 vising the '"cadre"--i.e., a
 reliable dynamic activist ele-
 ment in the party's program--
 he must "neither fabricate
 facts nor conceal them...in
 the process of reporting on
 the situation he must avoid
 taking imagination for truth,
 possibility for reality, parts
 for the whole, trees for the
 forest.  Reporting false con-
 ditions...will certainly mis-
 lead the leadership and make
 it impossible to arrive at a
 correct judgment."
 This line is difficult to
 reconcile with the pressure to
 falsify reports and statistics

 during the "great leap forward"
 in 1958 and 1959.  Anyone, who
 reported actual conditions then
 and did not "take possibility
 for reality," would have risked
 condemnation for deviating to
 the  "right . "
 The Leadership
 Peiping's shift toward
 pragmatic policies has been
 reluctant.  The decision to
 retrench was apparently made
 at an unannounced high-level
 meeting last July. An article
 by the regime's leading eco-
 nomic planner, Li Fu-chun, in
 the 15 August issue o.f Red Flag
 promulgated the new conserva-
 five line. "Readjustments" in
 the communes began shortly aft-
 erward, but the hard decision
 to import grain from the Nest
 was presumably not male until
 November, when the fall har-
 vest was in.
 The delay in official
 recognition of realities may
 reflect in part some diver-
 gencies among the top Chinese
 leaders, but the evidence is
 inferential or speculative.
 received the general impres-
 sion that the leaders are "all
 greatly worried by current
 problems and are beginning to
 get on each other's nerves."
 Teng Tzu-hui, head of the
 party's rural affairs com-
 mittee, may also have been
 implying difficulty in get-
 ting agreement in top coun-
 cils when he told a journal-
 ist last fall that the regime
 had had to scrap its agricul-
 tural plan and would operate
 on an ad hoc basis until 1962.
 The postponement of the
 National People's Congress un-
 til fall also suggests that the
 leaders have not yet been able
 to work out longer range plans.
 The Congress--Communist China's
 legislature--has served as the
 regime's annual public forum for
 announcing new programs.
 There  are  ot}ier  intima-
 tions of disagreements in the
 party in an ideological debate
 running through the theoretical
 journals during the past year
 between the pragmatists and the
 radicals.  Couched in Communist
 jargon on the nature and role
 of  "subjective  activity, "  the
 controversy in essence is over
 recent propensities of the re-
 gime to disregard material lim-
 itations in its efforts to trans-
 form the Chinese economy. In the
 course of the debate the pendu-
 lum has swung back and .f.orth
 several times; in the spring a
 temporary compromise was reached
 under the slogan "combine rev-
 olutionary zeal and the scien-
 tific spirit," but the most re-
 cent articles on the subject give
 the edge to the conservatives.
 Whatever the differences
 among them, the debate sug-
 gests that the Chinese Com-
 munist leaders have been af-
 fected by the mood of the coun-
 try, realize the population
 can be pushed no further for
 the moment, and are advancing
 a theoretical justification
 for the concessions they deem
 necessary.
