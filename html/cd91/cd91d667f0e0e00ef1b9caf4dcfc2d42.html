 Aggression Is Hanoi's Goal
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 24, 1966
 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, it is al-
 most incredible that after 25 years of
 watching Communist strategy, that any-
 one can say that the North Vietnamese
 are only seeking independence from
 -Vietnam and that we are frustrating
 that goal. Is there anyone who seriously
 doubts what would happen if we allowed
 the Vietcong and their Hanoi masters to
 take over South Vietnam?  There is no
 question in my mind that the people in
 south Vietnam would immediately find
 themselves in the same nationwide pris-
 on camp presently holding the people of
 North Vietnam and China.
 The following article by Seymour
 Freidin from the February 19, 1966, edi-
 tion of the New York Herald Tribune
 tells the story of Hanoi's aggression
 against the south:
 AGGRESSION,  NOT  INDEPENDENCE,  IS  HANOI'S
 GOAL
 (By Seymour Freidin)
 SAIGON.-Only a frayed street sign welcom-
 ing Vice President HUMPHREY hangs limply as
 a reminder of the boisterous jet-borne cara-
 van that whizzed around southeast Asia to
 proclaim the American intention to hang on
 in Vietnam. But a new sense of urgency has
 been gathered from the vapor trails.
 A test of American stamina and North
 Vietnamese intentions opens a fresh phase in
 this ferocious war.  It involves.a presidential
 behest to get results fast and the Commu-
 nist expansionist appetite.
 It seems more tangibly apparent now that
 the regime of He Chi Minh is embarked on
 a vastly ambitious project.  The Northern
 regime sees all southeast Asia as its own real
 estate in the foreseeable future.
 This can be implemented only by armed
 force and by withdrawal of a confused and
 uneasy United States.  The initiative comes
 from  the  north  without  any  meaningful
 pushes by Red China.
 It may come as a shock to many to learn
 that wispybearded, benevolent-looking Ho is
 by no means senile.    He is the take-charge
 commander of a policy long ago examined
 for loopholes, plugged and now being exe-
 cuted.
 His political and military entourage may
 differ occasionally on tactics.  But there is
 unanimity on the strategic goal:  shotgun
 amalgamation  of all Vietnam and then,
 southeast Asda.  That explains the contemp-
 tuous treatment of all peace initiatives and
 anguished pleas of sympathizers with the
 north.
 Thus,  the  speculation  that  the  Red
 Chinese will intervene if we augment both
 our armed strength and economic contribu-
 tion appears unfounded.
 Red China never had to compel North Viet-
 namese to build and expand their guerrilla
 infrastructure in the south.  The Chinese
 had little whatever to do with the buildup
 of the Vietcong and it political arm.  The
 north, Its cadres blooded in battle and vic-
 tory against the French, worked out its own
 plans and timetable for chopping up the
 south.
 This blatant aggressiveness has been to-
 tally overlooked by those, many in so-called
 uncommitted countries, who hail He as an
 Asian Tito.  Their proclamation of Commu-
 nist-supported  independence  runs  into  a
 dead end on the He Chi Minh trail.
 Tito, remember, made a working peace with
 the West when he was pitted against Sta-
 lin.                                                                         He has, with ups and downs, made of it
 enduring coexistence. There was never a
 serious Titoist adventure in expansionism
 once he decided to impose his image on
 Yugoslavia.
 It's a far different story with North Viet-
 nain.  Hanoi, flushed with the mystique of
 Dien Bien Phu, is actively engaged in im-
 posing its will on its neighbors.  Laos and
 Thailand are prima facie cases along with
 the carefully contrived mass subversion in
 South Vietnam.
 Only the southerners and the United States
 stand in the way of this vast and arrogant
 ambition, which has been checked but still
 far from shackled.  In a present regrouping
 period,  He  has  unleashed  mass  terrorism
 against civilians to prove to the south at
 large that fearful penalties can be exacted if
 acquiescence cannot be extorted.
 Last week pressure mines, powerful enough
 to blast our tanks, blew up a couple of buses.
 The death toll was 49 civilians and children.
 It happened on a dusty route never used by
 the military.
 This cold-blooded act of terrorism has been
 duplicated in work gangs, blown to pieces
 because they tried to earn a living repairing
 some  port  facilities.  A  pattern  of  wide-
 spread, calculated terror, directed by North
 Vietnam, is beginning to stretch fearsome
 fingers across this torn-up country.
 To counteract a cynical indifference to hu-
 man dignity and even survival-which critics
 of our role here display no less than Ho him-
 self--the  process of pacification requires
 time, trial, and patience.  Unfortunately, po-
 litical ballyhoo may prevent us from achiev-
 ing our objective: security on which Viet-
 namese can build hope.
 If the administration -anticipates shining
 results by mid-year elections, then the mas-
 sive effort that will be applied to this pro-
 gram may ring as hollowly as any other polit-
 ilacal stunt.  Too much is at stake for im-
 patience and electioneering.  The other side
 desperately wants to husband time and so
 should we.
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM H. HARSHA
 of OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 23, 1966
 Mr. HARSHA. Mr. Speaker, with pro-
 found sorrow I join my colleagues in ex-
 pressing our grief over the loss of our
 Chaplain, Dr. Bernard Braskamp.
 He was a great force for good in our
 midst and all of us are better for having
 known him. He was full of sympathetic
 and generous impulses toward us, and all
 mankind, and he will not be forgotten by
 any of us who served here with him.
 We mourn his passing as a cherished
 member of our family circle, and I wish
 to join my friends and colleagues in ex-
 pressing my great esteem for our friend
 and spiritual leader.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. BOB CASEY
 OS' TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. CASEY. Mr. Speaker, the mission
 of Vice President HUMPHREY is hailed by
 the Houston Post, which asserted that the
 purpose of his trip was "to reassure the
 leaders and people of the nations that re-
 main free in that part of the world that
 the United States is not going to run out
 on them or renege on its promises to
 help them keep their freedom and inde-
 pendence."
 According to the Post, the Vice Presi-
 dent's trip was designed "to counter the
 harm done by noisy critics of this coun-
 try's Vietnam policies and actions, Com-
 munist propaganda which pictures the
 American people on the point of revolt
 and demanding the withdrawal of this
 country's military forces from Vietnam,
 and possible misunderstandings over the
 fact that the United States is waging a
 peace offensive simultaneously with its
 military operations to aid the Govern-
 ment of South Vietnam."
 The newspaper believes the Vice Presi-
 dent Is communicating, and while it is
 important and desirable that everybody
 understand our views, policies, plans, and
 intentions, "it is vital that they be un-
 derstood by the people who are directly
 involved and who stand within the
 shadow of Communist aggression."
 I offer this forthright comment in its
 entirety for the RECORD, convinced that
 others will want to study its contents.
 [From the Houston Post, Feb. 15, 1966]
 HUMPHREY MISSION VITAL
 If there ever was any question about the
 purpose of Vice President HUBERT H. HUM-
 PHnEY's Asian mission, it is clear now that it
 is to reassure the leaders and people of the
 nations that remain free in that part of the
 world that the United States is not going to
 run out on them or renege on its promises to
 help them keep their freedom and inde-
 pendence.
 He is seeking to counter the harm done by
 noisy  critics  of  this  country's  Vietnam
 policies and actions, Communist propaganda
 which pictures the American people on the
 point of revolt and demanding the with-
 drawal of this country's military forces from
 Vietnam,  and   possible  misunderstandings
 over the fact that the United States is wag-
 ing a peace offensive simultaneously with its
 military operations to aid the Government of
 South Vietnam.
 Because of his ebullient personality and
 infectious enthusiasm, the Vice President is

 February     1966      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 )1+ ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday!, February 28, 1966
 Mr. RUMSFELD. Mr. Speaker, a re-
 cent column written for the Chicago
 Daily News by Mr. John M. Johnston
 places into perspective the problem of the
 U.S. Government purchasing  products
 from foreign firms which have pirated
 U.S. patents or production techniques.
 Mr. Johnston's fcolumn follows:
 1 From the Chicago (Ill.) Daily Newsi
 A NEW BID To SINK. THE DRUG PIRATES
 (By.Iohn M. Johnston)
 Back in 1960, when the late Senator Estes
 Refauver was trying to get the drug industry
 to hold still while he fitted it for a pillory, he
 sternly forbade any nasty cracks about Ital-
 ian                    pharmaceutical  manufacturers  at  the
 hearings.  Lyman Duncan, general manager
 of  American  Cvanamide's Lederle Labora-
 tories, had referred to some Italian competi-
 tors as "a nest of pirates."
 Any  such  conclusions  would    have  run
 counter to Senator Kefauver's thesis, which
 was that unjustified prices by American drug-
 makers were robbing the people, whose friend
 and  protector he was and hoped ever to
 remain.
 The Senator's position is still shared In
 other  Government  circles, which  consider
 foreign drugs a bargain.  Senator HARRISON A.
 WILLIAMS, Democrat, of New Jersey, is trying
 to block such purchases by a law that would
 prohibit the Government from buying drugs
 made in violation of patents.
 The total of such Government purchases
 has been placed at upwards of $27 million,
 although as far back as 1962, Dr. Edward
 Annis, president of the American Medical
 Association, was complaining of Defense De-
 partment purchases of tetracycline in Italy
 after it was known that the cultures from
 which this antibiotic was made were stolen
 In the United States.
 Well, time and events grind on, and a
 few days ago, a U.S. court in New York handed
 out prison sentences to six men involved
 In the  multimillion-dollar  conspiracy  by
 which  trusted  employees  of Lederle  sold
 manufacturing secrets and "wonder drug"
 cultures to Italian firms.
 f.ederle asserted that it spent more than
 $30 million in the  development of tetra-
 cycline and other antibiotics.                   It cost addi-
 tional millions to design and perfect the pro-
 duction facilities.  It is not astonishing that
 a manufacturer who could buy all this know-
 how from thieves for $100,000 could and did
 undersell American manufacturers and earn
 the praise of Senator Kefauver.
 'i'sle Defense Department is free of blame
 for  its purchases of foreign drugs.   It is
 bound by a 1958 ruling of the Comptroller
 General  that drugs for the military  and
 veterans hospitals must be bought for the
 lowest possible price, patent pirating being
 none of its business.
 The "wonder drugs" involved were Aureo-
 Inyc:in, Achromycin, and Declomycin-all of
 the  tetracycline  family-and Aristocort, a
 steroid used to treat arthritis.  The tetra-
 cyclines are used against bacterial diseases-
 pneumonia, typhus, meningitis, gonorrhea,
 and are said to be the most widely prescribed
 drugs in the world.
 The present Congress will see another at-
 tempt to pass Senator WILIIAMS' bill to for
 bid Government purchase of products made
 from  pirated  Lf.s.  patents  or  production
 techniques.   Representative R.  L.  RouDE-
 BUSH, Republican, of Indiana, points out that
 such thefts have caused lpsses in the tens of
 millions to U.S. pharmaceutical companies,
 in addition to lost wages and lost taxes to
 State and Federal Governments.
 Efforts have been made, particularly since
 formation of the Common Market, to per-
 suade the Italians to join In the patent pro-
 tfection generally afforded for such discov-
 eries.   Self-interest  has  kept them aloof,
 although some Italian concerns, having some
 developments of their own, have indicated
 that they might like protection.
 Until there  is international respect, for
 such property rights, it is clear that U.S.
 self-interest lies in the direction of the Har-
 rison-Roudebush bill.
 investment in Federal Reclamation Is
 Sound
 EXTENSION OF :REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN E. MOSS
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE: HOLfSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 23, 1966
 Mr. MOSS.  Mr. Speaker, a  recent
 editorial in the Sacramento Bee cites the
 progress of Federal reclamation projects
 in the Western States and rightfully calls
 them sound investments.
 The editorial points out that nearly
 I90 percent of the total Federal invest-
 ment in reclamation projects in 17 West-
 ern States will eventually be returned to
 the  Federal  Treasury  from  revenues
 received for electric power and water.
 I commend this editorial to the atten-
 tion of my colleagues:
 [From the Sacramento (Calif.) Bee,
 F'eb. 21, 19661
 INVESTMENT IN FEDERAL RECLAMATION
 Is SOUND
 The  significant  role  large  multipurpose
 Federal water projects have played in build-
 ing the West was illustrated by a recent an-
 nouncement by Secretary                                                                                     of  the  Interior
 Stewart L. Udall.   He pointed out the con-
 tracts under which water and power users
 repay the Government for their share of
 construction costs have passed the $1.5 bil-
 lion mark.
 The good faith of the beneficiaries of these
 projects has been demonstrated clearly be-
 cr.use the delinquency rate under the con-
 tracts is less than one-half of 1 percent.  The
 contracts are with water user districts, in-
 dtividual farmers, cities and industries; and
 they number more than 2,000.
 The range from the largest single water
 contract with the Westlands Water District
 in California--where the $157 million cost
 of building an entire irrigation system will
 bo repaid--to a small farmer in Oregon who
 is paying off $428 as his share of the bu;lciing
 c.:f the Klamath project.
 Federal investment In reclamation proj-
 ects in 17 Western States has reached $5.1
 billion.  Nearly 90 percent of the total even.-
 tually will be returned to the Federal Treas-
 ury from revenues received for electric power
 and water.  The facilities for municipal and
 Industrial water will be repaid in full with
 interest.
 Electric power, mostly distributed by pub-
 lie power systems, has been a paying part-
 ner of irrigation (luring the 60-year history
 of the Federal reclamation program.  Alex
 Radin of the American Public Power Asso-
 ciation in, a recent speech in Kansas City,
 A1025
 Mo., reminded listeners that Federal reclama-
 tion investment represents a two-way street
 with benefits traveling both ways.
 Another  observer,  Reclamation Commis-
 sioner Floyd E. Dominy, commenting on the
 fact that 90 cents out of every dollar in-
 vested is returned, had this to say: "No other
 resource development agency can show such
 a cash-on-the-barrelhead return."
 These facts must be kept in mind as debate
 continues over proposals to build more Fed-
 eral water projects.  The economic well-being
 which westerners enjoy can be attributed
 directly to the existence of the great water
 and power developments pioneered by the
 Federal Reclamation Bureau.
 As the West continues to expand, future
 projects will play an equally important part
 in maintaining a vigorous and stable eco-
 nomic growth.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ANDREW JACOBS, JR.
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. JACOBS.                                          Mr. Speaker, one of
 my constituents, the Honorable Richard
 0.   Creedon, member of the Indiana
 House of Representatives, has taken ex-
 ception to a recent tax distribution plan
 for education.
 Mr. Creedon, in a letter to me, notes
 quite properly that the plan is a scheme
 to milk the large cities.
 Because of the light which Mr. Cree-
 don's letter sheds on the real effect of
 this tax distribution plan, I insert it in
 the CONGRESSIONAL RzcORD:
 Hon. ANDREW JACOBS, Jr.,
 Representative, 11th District, Indiana,
 Cannon Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: On the 29th of January I asked
 you for a copy of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
 of January 24, 1966, containing the tax dis-
 tribution plan for education as propoed by
 Representative HALL, Republican, of Missouri.
 My comment at that time is on the bottom
 of the photocopy of the article that I sent
 to you where I said I was sure that this was
 a scheme to milk the large cities.  It :is.
 His whole plan is set out on page 853 of the
 January 24, 1966, issue of the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD and I decided to do some arithmetic.
 In the first year table, page 853, column 1,
 the State figures are divided by 12.07 to arrive
 at the number of students.
 On page 856 chart No. 2 shows gross per-
 sonal income and estimated expenditures for
 public elementary and secondary education
 as well as per capita personal income for the
 particular States.
 Using the table for the first year on page
 853, I compared Indiana and Mississippi and
 arrived at the number of students for the
 respective  States.  My  arithmetic:  is  that
 Indiana has 1.9 times as many students or
 190 percent the number of students that
 Mississippi has.
 Mississippi (chart 2)  spends 5.34 percent
 of personal income for elementary and sec-
 ondary education  as                                                                                                                                   prepared  to  Indiana
 figure of 4.87, which means that Indiana on
 a  percentage  of  income basis spends 8.5
 percent less.
 However, our per capita income is 1.8 times
 as much  as    the per capita  income   of
 Mississippi.
 On a dollar basis, Indiana spends $540.40
 per student as compared to $383.70 or 40

 unusually well qualified for this assignment.
 It remains to be seen how effective he will be
 as reassurer and morale reinforcer, but it is
 doubtful if President Johnson. could have
 dispatched a better man for this particular
 job.  Because the Vice President speaks with
 the authority of the President, it is hoped
 that his words will be convincing.
 His assignment is most interesting, how-
 ever, in that it shows the extent to which
 the office of Vice President has undergone
 a radical change within a very few years.
 Within the memory of most people, the Vice
 President of the United States was simply
 the man who presided over the Senate and
 succeeded to the presidency when and if a
 vacancy should occur.
 The trend toward making him an active
 member of the administration in office by
 expanding his duties and responsibilities was
 started by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
 President John F. Kennedy continued the
 policy.  In neither case were the special as-
 signments given the Vice President limited
 to the area of domestic affairs.  Vice Presi-
 dent Richard M. Nixon was sent on missions
 abroad, acting as special emissary and repre-
 sentative of the President, and so was Presi-
 dent Johnson when he was Vice President.
 In fact, President Johnson made a trip to
 southeast Asia comparable to that of Vice
 President HUMPHREY, in 1961, and when the
 spirits of West Berliners showed signs of sag-
 ging following construction of the wall by
 the Communists through the heart of their
 city, he was sent there to reassure the free
 German people.
 Even if these foreign missions served no
 other purpose, they would be desirable as
 part of the  educational  process for  Vice
 Presidents, to prepare them better for the
 duties of the Presidency if they should ever
 be called upon to assume them and to assure
 continuity of policies.
 The Humphrey mission therefore would be
 desirable and worthwhile, even if there was
 no  problem  of  morale  and  confidence.
 From all acounts the Vice President is doing
 an able job.  At least he is communicating,
 and in view of all the clouds of confusion
 swirling over the world at this time, this is
 of great importance. It is important and
 desirable   that  everybody  understand  the
 views, policies, plans and intentions of the
 Government    in  Washington,  with  respect
 to Asia and to southeast Asia in particular,
 but it is vital that they be understood by the
 people who are directly involved and who
 stand  within  the  shadow. of     Communist
 aggression.

 OF
 HON. JOHN D. DINGELL
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, pursuant
 to permission granted, I insert in the
 RECORD a resolution adopted by the dy-
 namic and forward-looking 16th District
 Democratic Organization of Michigan
 urging full implementation of the one-
 man, one-vote principle:
 RESOLUTION  MADE  AT  THE  16TH  CONGRES-
 SIONAL DISTRICT DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION
 Whereas there are unwise attempts being
 made to alter the principle of one man, one
 vote,.as stated by the U.S. Supreme Court;
 and
 Whereas the one-man, one-vote principle
 is basic to the American concept of democ-
 racy; and
 Whereas the vote of one person should be
 equal to the vote of any citizen; and
 Whereas any constitutional amendment
 diluting the equality of the vote of some
 citizens is an attack upon the principle that
 "all men are created equal," as stated in the
 Declaration of Independence: Now, therefore,
 be it
 Resolved, That the Michigan 16th Congres-
 sional District Democratic Organization go
 on record in favor of the full implementation
 of the one-man, one-vote concept, and op-
 posed to any action which might alter this
 fundamental democratic principle.

 Your Opinion, Please
 HON. WILLIAM G. BRAY
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. BRAY.                                               Mr. Speaker, for several
 years it has been my custom to take
 samplings of public opinion in my con-
 gressional district.
 For each Member of this body, the job
 of keeping. aware of the thoughts and
 beliefs of his constituents is one of his
 foremost duties.  Yet it is not easy to
 keep in touch with the opinions of 400,-
 000 people in the average congressional
 district.
 In addition to the thousands of letters,
 telegrams, and telephone calls I receive,
 I appreciate the opportunity for personal
 contact with the voters.  Obviously, we
 cannot contact them all as frequently as
 we would like, and the opinion poll is a
 useful supplement.
 I have found such questionnaires to
 be helpful to me in measuring public
 interest and attitudes on important mat-
 ters before the Congress.  This practice
 has  also  stimulated  discussion  and
 thought among my constituents on the
 major problems we face as a nation.
 This year I am again asking for "Your
 Opinion, Please."  The list of questions
 is necessarily brief, but I believe they
 touch upon the most important Issues
 before us.
 The war in Vietnam is obviously of
 paramount interest to us all.  Of grow-
 ing significance are the various domestic
 programs of the Great Society, and the
 level at which they should be pursued.
 An imminent threat is also posed by in-
 creasing inflationary pressures which
 may be felt in every segment of the econ-
 omy in the coming months.
 It is always difficult to select just the
 right questions and to phrase them in a
 way which is easily understandable and
 yet will elicit a meaningful answer.  I
 have reviewed the questions asked by a
 score of my colleagues in an attempt to
 get the best possible.
 Each of the replies to these questions
 will be tabulated and the results will be
 placed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
 Here are the questions I am putting to
 my constituents:
 What course should the United
 States follow in Vietnam?
 Maintain present level of in-
 volvement _______.__________
 Suspend  bombing  of  North
 Vietnam _________._______--_
 Withdraw our Armed Forces
 Intensify military action_____
 Do you favor changing the term
 of the House of Representatives
 from 2 to 4 years? ________
 Should the Federal Government
 pay  a  portion  of  the  home
 rentals for some families, as
 proposed  by the     administra-
 tion?-------------------------
 Should additional tax credits or
 deductions be allowed parents
 of college students?_________
 The  administration   has  asked
 $1.6 billion for the war on pov-
 erty-an increase of $400 mil-
 lion over the first year.  Do you
 approve? ---------------------
 Do you believe there currently is
 a threat of serious inflation?-

 HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. TEAGUE of Texas.                  Mr. Speaker,
 my position on the House Committee on
 Science and Astronautics has brought
 me in close touch with many learned
 scientists and experts in the field of
 rocketry.  I know of no man whom I en-
 joy as much, nor for whom I have gained
 as much respect for than Kurt Debus,
 director of the Kennedy Space Center in
 Florida.
 I was pleased to see that the Sunday
 Star  honored  Dr.  Debus  this  past
 weekend as their headline personality,
 and under leave to extend my remarks
 in the RECORD, I include this article:
 [From the Washington, (D.C.) Sunday Star,
 Feb.27,1966]
 HEADLINE   PERSONALTY-DEBUS   CUT   HIS
 TEETH AT GERMAN V-2 BASE
 CAPE KENNEDY, FLA.-The man who saved
 the day for Project Apollo yesterday is a
 saber-scarred engineer who has fired more
 big rockets than most people have seen.
 As a result of his long experience with
 these temperamental "birds," Kurt H. Debus
 has long since learned never to flap, even
 when things appear most unpromising.
 Yesterday while others here and at Hous-
 ton,  Tex.,  were  making  a  decision  to
 "scrub" the launching of a big Apollo-Saturn
 superrocket because of a cranky gas-pres-
 sure system, Debus was communing with
 himself at his desk in launch control here.
 Even after the decision was made-and an-
 nounced-the mild-mannered rocket engi-
 neer did not give up.
 WORKED WITII VON BRAUN
 As a result of his thoughtful persistence,
 the unthinkable happened: A scrub was "de-
 scrubbed," and Apollo-Saturn 201 went on
 to a resoundingly successful flight that al-
 ready has secured a place in the space record
 books.

 testing  base  of Peenenmende,  where  he
 worked closely with another German engi
 neer. Dr. Vernher von Braun.
 Debus and Von Braun came to the United.
 States under the same postwar sponsored-
 immigration program and have since won
 high places in the U.S. space effort.
 Debus is Director of the Kennedy Space
 Ceonter here, a job parallel to Von Braun's
 position  at  the  Marshall  Space  Flight
 C enter, Huntsville, Ala.  When men go to
 the moon about 1970, the last bit of earth
 their feet will touch before liftoff currently
 "belongs" to Debus.
 IN  EFFICIENCY
 Graying and scholarly, Debus runs a cen..
 to  here,  worth roughly a  billion dollars,
 which is Spartan in its efficiency.  He is one
 of the few space officials who has taken on a.
 major project and carried out on time and
 within cost elements.
 Debus      and  his  principal associates  are
 quick to dii;olaim the role of wonderwork-
 crs.                  They explain that their job has been
 construction of ground facilities, not rock-
 ets, modestly leaving unmentioned the fact
 that their works border on the fantastic.
 On an average sunny Florida day, Debus
 can sit in his top-floor office in the KSC
 headquarters building on nearby Merritt Is..
 Land. and look a few miles north to the
 world's largest structure-a 525-foot vertical
 assembly building in which the first copy of
 the world's largest rocket, Saturn V, is be--
 ginning to take shape.
 Y'D  WITHIN  GAVE
 Shifting his gaze a few miles to the east,
 he can make out the low-lying pad where
 the first flight-model of Saturn V will blast
 off sometime early next year.  And like as
 not as he watches, a structure tall as a 40-
 story building will lumber slowly across the
 scene--a mobile  launcher  on  a  test  run
 from the vertical assembly building to the
 pad.
 Debus has been directly responsible for
 every  manned   launching  that  has  taken
 place here, and for most of the big unmanned
 ones conducted by the space agency.
 Rocket firings are his life--a far cry from
 the quiet academic days at Darmstadt Unt-?
 versity in Germany, or even from Peene--
 niunde.
 No one could have foreseen 55 years ago in
 Frankfurt, G;.erma.ny, that the infant son of
 Heinrich and Melly Debus would be where
 and. who he is today.  The "where" transi-
 tion sometimes surprises even Debus him-
 self,
 This drastic change of circumstances from
 pre-World  War  I  Germany  to  space-age
 America has given Debus an accent that can
 only be described as "German cracker." He
 learned English as a second conversational
 language while working for  the Army at
 Huntsville, in northern Alabama, and his
 way of speech reveals this.
 "It's lucky anyone can understand me,"
 be sometimes comments.   Actually, Debus'
 English is fluent, idiomatic and not severely
 affected by mingling the tones of Darmstadt;
 and Huntsville.
 Every inch the suave, continental gentle-
 man, Debus bears on the lower left side of
 his face "marks of honor" received in duel-
 ing encounters in his undergraduate days
 a la "The Student Prince."   Many people
 assume the scars are sabrewounds but then
 unbelievingly shrug off the idea. No mistake,
 however: They are the real thing, right out
 of pre-Hitler Rhineland college capers.
 A self-effacing man among extroverts, De-?

 Gerald Yee Writes Winning Hawaii Entry
 in National VFW Essay Contest
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. SPARK M. MATSUNAGA
 OF HAWAII
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, February 24, 1966
 Mr. MATSUNAGA.  Mr. Speaker, one
 of the many worthwhile projects of the
 Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United
 States is their annual Voice of Democracy
 Essay Contest for high school students.
 The contest not only stimulates discus-
 sions in classrooms on the meaning of
 democracy, but it also provides an oppor-
 tunity for the students to compete for
 educational scholarships ranging from
 $1,000 to $5,000.  More than 300.000 stu-
 dents participated in the contest this
 year, and the winner from each State
 has been invited to our Nation's Capital
 for the final judging on March 8, 1966.
 Representing the State of Hawaii is
 Gerald   Yee   of   Honolulu,   Hawaii.
 Gerald's winning essay, entitled ' Democ-
 racy--What It Means to Me," reflects
 mature understanding and appreciation
 of his role in the democratic processes by
 which our country is governed. His essay
 is a tribute to the democratic environ-
 ment that Hawaii has always provided to
 nurture its young citizens.
 It is with great pride, therefore, that
 I submit for inclusion in the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD, Gerald Yee's outstanding
 essay:
 .DEMOCRACY: WHAT IT MEANS Til ME
 (By Gerald Yee)
 I'i ene : 18:35.
 Place: The United States, with dhe great
 French  philosopher  Alexis  de  Tocqueville
 making his historic visit to study the work-
 ings of democracy.
 On a restful night, De Tocqueville sat down
 and began writing.   He captured the essence
 of democracy when he scribbled: "Whenever
 the political laws of the United States are to
 be discussed, it is with the supreme author-
 ity of the people that we must begin."
 Forty-six years before, in 1789, the fathers
 of our country hopefully made plans for the
 American ship of state, a new vessel to sail
 on treacherous uncharted seas amidst the
 darkest storms of autocracy and tradition.
 These men. hoping fora land where they
 could be free, carefully laid out the blue-
 prints                                                                                                                                         for   this   masterful undertaking,
 George Washington was elected captain, and
 the ship was run by a rare element--democ-
 racy.                                                                                                                                         Kings   and  parliaments   laughed,
 sneered, and literally spit upon this ship of
 state.  Never before had they heard of a gov-
 ernment  where                                                                                                                                          a    man  without  property
 could elect his leaders, or where the most
 ragged  pauper  was  being  guaranteed  the
 same rights as the gold-studded noble. How-
 ever, in time these kings vanished from the
 face of the earth while the U.S. ship of state
 sailed on.
 We are all part of the crew of this ship of
 state, which sails by the exercise of democ-
 racy on board.  We students are delegated as
 many responsibilities as the rich man, poor
 man, and the worker, who each has his share
 in maintaining operation of democracy.
 Now let us have a closer examination of
 democracy.   We  define  democracy  as  (I I
 faith of the people to govern themselves, and
 (2) the belief that common men alone have
 the ability to unite the ship of state, bound
 by common interest and common goals to
 protect the freedoms and welfare of all.  As
 a democratic: nation, we believe that God
 himself gave us the natural right and en-
 couragement to decide for ourselves what is
 proper.  This is proven when the founders
 of this great country wrote the laws of the
 land with the highest regard for the rights
 which God so earnestly gave us.
 Accordingly, the common man alone has
 the ability to band together with his fellow
 beings to form a democratic state, whereby
 each man is entitled to his share of freedom.
 This state, formed by wealth, workmen, and
 teenagers, must possess sufficient energy and
 kinship to weather the onslaught of external
 forces and the changing of times.
 As high school students in America, we
 must not be led to believe that our role in
 preserving our democratic way of he is lim-
 ited to just voting and watching television
 forums.   On the  contrary,  preserving  our
 democratic  Way  of  life  consumes all  the
 energy we can supply.  Our role is to keep our
 ears, our eyes, and our minds open for several
 sides of an issue, including those of extremist
 groups,  and to  constantly  safeguard   our
 sacred rights.
 For instance, the  other day my friends
 were discussing the pros and cons of the Viet-
 nam  war.                                                                                                                                       Several  fellows decided,    with
 great spirit, that they must show their feel-
 ings toward the war on a larger scale.                                                                                                                                        They
 brushed several slogans on cardboard signs
 and demonstrated in full view of the public.
 Certainly, their privilege to protest or to pro-
 mote a cause is an inherent and vital organ
 of democratic society.
 As high school students, attending school
 is obviously one of the major methods in
 which our democratic way of life is already
 being preserved.  A close examination of to-
 day's high schools show that students are
 being prepared to become active  citizens.
 High school students are doing their part; to
 keep democracy alive and working by taking
 advantage    of  citizenship  courses, while
 classes in U.S. Government and American
 history open doors to the rich meaning of
 democracy.   Other school activities allow the
 student  to  exercise  his  leadership skills,
 which   are  vital  to the  preservation of
 democracy.
 By exercising the fundamentals in school,
 we students practice democracy by listening,
 watching, and doing.   For example, we can
 follow the course of an election campaign
 and wind up with a student mock election
 concerning identical issues.
 As students, we must always be on the
 guard for infringements on democracy and
 strive for a more democratic society.   We
 can start first at home and in the community
 by informing other citizens of their rights
 and obligations in a democracy.  Apathy in

 Alaska's National Guardsmen
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RALPH J. RIVERS
 OF ALASKA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, February 2, 1966
 Mr. RIVERS of Alaska.  Mr. Speaker,
 I would like to call the attention of the
 Members of the House of Representatives
 to a recent article by Mr. Bill Fox, a staff
 writer for the Anchorage Times, Anchor-
 age, Alaska, entitled "Famed Alaska
 Scouts Protect 49th State Full Time on
 Part-Time Pay." In the concluding par-
 agraph of his story, Mr. Fox states:
 The scouts are in a class of their own and
 none of the regular guardsmen or servicemen
 in other branches of the Armed Forces will
 dispute it.
 I am sure that anyone who reads the
 following article will agree with his con-
 elusion:
 FAMED ALASKA SCOUTS PROTECT 49TH STATE
 FULL TIME ON PART-TIME PAY
 (By Bill Fox)
 About 1,200 of Alaska's proudest National
 Guardsmen are currently attending their an-
 nual 2-week field training session at Camp
 Denali at Fort Richardson.
 The 1st and 2d Scout Battalions of the
 National Guard, composed almost entirely of
 Indians and Eskimos from remote areas of
 the State, arrived at Fort Richardson Sunday
 and will remain there for 15 days of rigorous
 training exercises.
 Members of the scout battalions are unique
 in  that they  perform  nearly  a  full-time
 job on part-time pay.   This, however, is not
 the only characteristic which sets this group
 aside from all other National Guard units
 across the lower 49 States.
 Unlike  other  States,  the  guardsmen    in
 Alaska convene for their annual tour of ac-
 tive duty in midwinter.  The scout battal-
 ions are trained for combat In arctic and
 subarctic temperatures and thus their train-
 ing is conducted in a period which properly
 prepares them for emergencies which might
 arise in their own villages.
 The 1st Battalion, commanded by Maj. Bill
 Caldwell,  has  headquarters in  Nome  and
 covers an area stretching from Barter Island
 in the northeast to Stebbins and St. Michael
 along Norton Sound.  In addition, the 1st
 Battalion maintains outposts on Little Dio-
 mede and St. Lawrence Island.
 The 2d Battalion has its headquarters at
 Bethel and is commanded by Maj. Joe Pike,
 an American Cree Indian.   This battalion
 maintains 29 units in towns and villages from
 Kotlik on Norton Sound to Dillingham on
 the shores of Bristol Bay.  The 2d Battalion,
 mostly made up of Athabascan Indians, has
 a unit at Mekoryuk on Nunivak Island, as
 well.
 Although men in both battalions are re-
 quired to meet in their own units just 48
 times in a year, many convene as many as 90
 or more times.  Being a member of a scout
 battalion carries as much status as being a
 member of the village council in some Eski-
 mo communities.                       The scouts are extremely
 proud  of their uniforms  and  the money
 which they receive for attending training
 sessions is an important factor in the eco-
 nomic growth of their home villages.
 The scout battalions are trained to main-
 tain a constant surveillance over an assigned
 geographical area, its adjacent waters, and
 offshore islands.  The battalions can report
 any information which they obtain by way of
 radio and in most cases a native Eskimo
 J"  400030( pe'6 uary 28, 1966
 dialect is much more effective for transmit-
 ting secret information than any standard
 type of voice code.
 Each battalion contains slightly over 600
 men, but is broken down by units within a
 village.  The heaviest concentration of scouts
 exist in Point Barrow where there are about
 90.
 Although many of the scouts can under-
 stand and speak English, they are often re-
 luctant to discuss their roles as scouts.  One
 platoon sergeant from a small village on the
 northern coast of Alaska said most of his
 winters were spent hunting and most of his
 summers devoted  to fishing.   He said he
 maintained a dog team and added that it
 took about 800 pounds of fish to feed his
 dogs each year.
 Most of the scout officers have attended
 training school outside of Alaska.
 Many of the scouts prefer to wear their
 own mukluks while they are snowshoeing,
 rather than the regular Army-issued boots.
 One Eskimo said the Army boots were too
 stiff and made his feet sore.
 The enthusiasm and pride of these scouts
 is so great that they carry their work far
 beyond the call of duty in many instances.
 Some of the units in the far Northwest have
 been  responsible for  recovering  Soviet
 weather balloons which have enabled U.S.
 officials  to  determine  just  how advanced
 the Russians have become in their weather-
 probing operations.
 Other units have made heroic rescues and
 still  others  have successfully  guided  un-
 familiar units through the arctic wilds of
 northern Alaska.
 The cost of conducting an annual encamp-
 ment to bring battalions together is expen-
 sive, but worth while.  Operation of Camp
 Denali for the 15-day period runs in the
 vicinity of $3,500.  Rations for the more than
 1,200 men are about $25,000.  Transportation
 is $95,000 and payrolls amount to $165,000.
 In addition, $1,500 worth of petroleum, oil
 and lubricants is consumed and clothing and
 field supplies for   each  scout  amounts to
 about $350.
 Often, the process of bringing a scout from
 his home village to Camp Denali is a major
 operation and in some cases it is never com-
 pleted.  Last year 80 men were left waiting
 in their villages for 9 days before they were
 finally notified that the weather was too
 poor to permit air flights into their territory.
 Their active tour of duty was canceled.
 This year about 40 men, who became rest-
 less and tired of waiting for a bush plane to
 fly them out to one of the key pickup points,
 boarded five snow vehicles and a dozen dog
 teams and traveled into Bethel from Kweth-
 luk and Akiachiak.
 One colonel suggested that perhaps the
 extra enthusiasm displayed by Eskimo Scouts
 was a symbol of their gratitude for being
 given the opportunity to learn their work
 as guardsmen and to travel around the State
 and into the southern 49 States.
 In any case, the Scouts are truly in a class
 of their and none of the regular guardsmen
 or servicemen In other branches of the Armed
 Forces will dispute it.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. ODIN LANGEN
 OF MINNESOTA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. LANGEN. Mr. Speaker, I am
 happy to report that one of my constitu-
 ents Is throwing welcome light on what
 is happening in Vietnam by writing a
 series of in-depth articles for Aviation
 Week and Space Technology, the aero-
 space journal.  He is C. M. "Tony"
 Plattner, of Walker, Minn., son of Mr.
 and Mrs. Clemens A. Plattner, the hus-
 band and wife team who edit and pub-
 lish three newspapers in our State-
 the Walker Pilot, the Cass County In-
 dependent, and the Crow Wing County
 Review.
 Tony flew fighter planes while a pilot
 in the Marine Corps from 1952 to 1956
 after graduating as a mathematics major
 from Carleton College in Northfield,
 Minn.  He attended the University of
 Minnesota School of Journalism after
 serving in the Marines, and then worked
 as an associate engineer for the Mar-
 quardt Corp.
 Combining his practical flying experi-
 ence with his technical training, Tony
 joined Aviation Week as a reporter spe-
 cializing in aircraft engineering stories.
 He recently went to Vietnam for 2
 months to report the air war there first-
 hand, flying missions ranging from B-52
 bombing raids to light-plane spotter mis-
 sions in a Bird Dog aircraft.  His series
 on U.S. air tactics in Vietnam set a new
 high watermark in the reporting on that
 confusing war.
 If there is no objection, I would like to
 insert an editorial from the January 3,
 issue of Aviation Week about how Tony
 is covering the Vietnam war.
 THE LONG WAR
 The Vietnam war is now in another pause
 that hopefully might  lead to meaningful
 negotiations but more  likely is  simply  a
 prelude to a greater escalation of that con-
 flict.  In addition to increasing in intensity
 and fury in Vietnam, the next phase of the
 struggle for a favorable balance of power in
 Asia is likely to spread into other areas of
 the southeastern peninsula, such as Laos
 and Thailand.
 Main reason that the current pause Is un-
 likely to produce significant negotiations is
 that the United States has not yet changed
 the basic strategic balance in Vietnam, de-
 spite an air bombing campaign against North
 Vietnam and a major increase in ground and
 air strength in South Vietnam.  Notwith-
 standing the major increases in land, air,
 and sea forces in southeast Asia during the
 past 6 months, the strategy with which they
 have been employed has failed to achieve the
 desired U.S. goals.  In the air, the limited
 and sporadic campaign of interdiction against
 Communist supply lines feeding the Viet-
 cong in South Vietnam has proved ineffective
 because of the nature of the terrain involved
 and the limited scale of the air effort em-
 ployed.  On the ground the "sweep and
 clear" tactics" have produced some bloody
 battles, but the Vietcong usually reoccupy
 the areas after the fighting ends.
 The Communist forces in South Vietnam
 are now more numerous, aggressive, and
 better supplied than they were last spring
 before the U.S. ground force buildup and air
 interdiction  campaigns  accelerated.  It  is
 clear that not only will additional military
 forces be required in southeast Asia, but also
 that a radically different strategy for their
 use will be necessary to achieve a relatively
 swift and enduring decision.
 The scale of the war in southeast Asia has
 been  escalating  steadily  since  President
 Johnson's inaugural 1 year ago this month.
 It is now reaching the stage where it will re-
 quire major changes in American life if it
 continues much longer on a further escalated
 scale. The American people and the aero-
 space industry could be faced with the pros-

 IXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 110N. WILLIAM T. MURPHY
 (11? Il?f.INOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. MURPHY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
 it, was a profound shock to learn of the
 oudden death at  Tashkent of India's
 Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.
 All. the world joins the people of India
 in mourning the passing of this great
 statesman.
 Because of its relevance, I include in
 the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  an editorial
 that appeared in the Gazette of India
 nP xtraordinary on January 14, 1966.  The
 editorial follows :
 The sudden demise at Tashkent of Lai
 Bahadur Shastri In the early hours of Tues-
 day, January 11, 1966, has plunged the nation
 into deep distress and grief.  Lal Bahadur
 Shastri went to Tashkent in the cause of
 peace and it is a great tragedy that just
 when his persistent efforts towards settle-
 ment for an honorable and enduring peace in
 this subcontinent achieved fruition, fate de-
 livered a cruel blow and removed him from
 our midst.
 Born  in  1904  at Mugha]sarai  in Uttar
 Pradesh, Lal. Bahadur Shastri lost his father
 while he was still an infant.  How this in-
 fant, born in a modest environment, rose to
 the highest political office in this country,
 is an inspiring saga of noble endeavor, un-
 wavering sincerity of purpose and a high
 sense of patriotism and integrity in public
 life.
 Lal Bahadur Shastri was only 17 years old
 when the call came from Mahatma Gandhi
 and without hesitation he plunged himself
 in the freedom struggle.  He was imprisoned.
 On release, he entered Kashi Vidyapeeth at
 Varanasi and came under the influence of
 the savant, Dr. Bhagwan Dass.  He took the
 Shastri degree from the Vidyapeeth (Uni-
 versity) and reentered active politics.
 At the age of 23, Shastri was married. to
 Shrimati Lalita Devi, who has always stood
 by him as a steadfast companion, to  the
 very end of his life of sacrifice and devotion
 to the nation.
 Lai Bahadur Shastri had participated in
 all mass movements launched during India's
 fight for freedom and was imprisoned  as
 many as seven times.  In 1946, he was elected
 to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 and was appointed Parliamentary Secretary
 to the Chief Minister.  Subsequently, he was
 appointed Minister for Police and Transport.
 This portfolio he held for nearly 5 years.
 In. 1952, when the first general elections
 were held in India after attainment of in-
 dependence, Lal Bahadur Shastri was en-
 trusted by the Congress Party with the task
 of organizing the election  campaign;  the
 great success which the party secured at the
 polls  in  those  elections was in no small
 measure due to his organizing capacity.
 Lal Bahadur Shastri became a member
 of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of Parlia-
 melnt) in the first, session of Parliament.                                                                     He
 was appointed the Union Minister for Trans-
 port and Railways in 1952.  Four years later,
 lie resigned his ministership because he felt
 he was constitutionally responsible for a rail-
 way accident in which many lives had been
 lost.  This was symbolic of his stanch faith
 in and sincere endeavor to live up to the
 highest traditions of parliamentary democ-
 racy.                                                                         Expressing his deep appreciation of
 ibis step in Parliament, late Prime Mini,_aer
 Nehru described Lal Bahadur Shastri as a
 man, of the highest integrity with devotion
 to high ideals.
 The call to assume responsibility of high
 public office came to Lal Bahadur Shastri
 again in 1957 when he was elected to the
 Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) and
 was assigned the portfolio of Transport and
 Communications in the Union Cabinet.  In
 March 1958, he became Minister for Com-
 merce and industry.  Later, on the death of
 Gobind Ballabh Pant in April 1961. the im-
 portant portfolio of Home Affairs was en-
 trusted to him.
 A: Minister for Home Affairs, Lai Bahadur
 Shastri brought into play his gifts as an
 able administrator and he handled a num-
 ber of complex and intricate political and
 administrative problems with sagacity and
 skill.  He had a great capacity for resolving
 differences  and  brought  to  bear,  on  dis-
 putes and discords, the healing tough of his
 great personal charm, gentle persuasion and
 deep understanding.   One of the difficult
 problems which he solved soon after his as-
 surnption of the office of Home Minister was
 the language issue in Assam.  Amongst im-
 portant matters which received his special
 attention during his tenure as Home Minister
 was a promotion of emotional integration
 amongst the people of India, a matter which
 always remained uppermost in his mind.
 In August 1963, Lal Bahadur Shastri re-
 signed from the office of Home Minister to
 devote himself to the task of revitalization
 of the Congress Organization.  Soon after,
 he was called upon to join the Union Cabinet
 as Minister without portfolio.  In that capac-
 ity, he lightened the burden of the heavy
 responsibilities of the late Prime Minis er
 and on passing away of Jawaharlal Nehru,
 the mantle of the great leader fell on Lal
 Bahadur Shastri.
 . The smoothness with which the change-
 over took place was a measure of the nation's
 confidence In Lal :Bahadur Shastri's capac-
 ity to direct the affairs of the country.  And
 the nation was soon to find that its trust in
 him was fully justified.  Onerous responsi-
 bilities of the high office unfolded his great
 qualities of leadership.  In terms of time,
 the tenure of Lal Bahadur Shastri was a
 short one.
 However, during the span of the 19 months
 that Lal Bahadur Shastri was Prime Minis-
 ter, the country passed through a period of
 such severe stress and strain as would test
 the mettle of the highest leadership.  Dur-
 ing a crucial phase of our history, bristling
 with  serious internal  as  well  as external
 problems, he guided the destinies of the na-
 tion with strength, determination, wisdom
 and farsighted statesmanship.     A man  of
 genuine humbleness of spirit and of unfail-
 ing courtesy, Lal Bahadur Shastri was essen-
 tially a man of peace.  He sought peace in
 the country, peace with her neighbors and
 peace throughout the world.       His concept
 of peace, however, was one of peace with
 honor and, behind his modesty and gentle
 exterior, lay a firmness of purpose and a reso-
 lute will.
 When,  therefore,  challenge   came  a few
 months ago, it found Lal Bahadur Shastri
 the firm sentinel of the country's honor,
 freedom and territorial integrity.     In this
 hour of crisis, he provided the nation with
 determined and inspiring leadership under
 which the entire nation rose as one man to
 meet  effectively  the threat of aggression.
 These hostilities, which were not of India's
 seeking, however, did not deflect Lal Bahadur
 Shastri from his quest for peace and good
 neighborliness: The Tashkent agreement was
 his finest hour and. a measure of his sincere
 effort in the direction of peace.
 Lal Bahadur Shastri was a man of the peo-
 ple.  Both as an individual and as a leader,
 he endeared himself to the people.  His life
 was one of complete dedication to the service
 of the nation.  Even in frail health, lie did
 not permit himself rest or respite.  His tragic
 end, which came in the wake of his vigorous
 pursuit of the Tashkent talks in complete
 disregard of mental and physical strain, was
 characteristic of his devotion to service of
 the country and to the cause of peace.
 The country has lost Lal Bahadur Shastri
 when it had great need for his services and
 the people had discovered, in true measure,
 his great qualities of character and leader-
 ship.  It is for the people of this country to
 prove worthy of the legacy which Lal Baha-
 dur Shastri has left behind and to strive
 wholeheartedly and unitedly for fulfillment
 of the great tasks to which he addressed him-
 self and for which he lived and died.
 On the eve of his death, he said to the De-
 fense Minister:   We have now to fight for
 peace with the same courage and determina-
 tion as we fought against aggression."  The
 nation can never forget these words which
 sum tip his message to India and to the
 world.

 pact of a long, bloody, and fruitless war that
 would make Korea fade into a minor skir-
 mish by comparison.
 Against this background Aviation Week &
 Space Technology again brings its readers a
 series (the third since 1964)  of special re-
 ports from the combat zones of southeast
 Asia, written by a specially qualified staff
 member.  The series that begins in this issue
 on page 16 is the result of 2 months of
 travel in southeast Asia by C. M. "Tony"
 Plattner, a member of this magazine's Los
 Angeles bureau who has an unusual set of
 qualifications for this task.
 "Tony"  Plattner  served  4  years'  active
 duty as a Marine Corps fighter pilot flying
 Vought F4U Corsairs and Grumman F9F-5's
 and is now a captain in the Marine Air Re-
 serve flying Douglas A-4E jet attack aircraft.
 His 2,000 hours of flying time also include
 many pilot report assignments for A.W. & S.T.
 in a wide variety of aircraft.  His latest be-
 fore leaving for Vietnam last fall was a
 chock-to-chock exercise in the lefthand seat
 of the Douglas DC-9 (A.W. & S.T. Nov. 1, p.
 37).  He was educated as a mathematician
 and worked as an engineer in the aerospace
 industry and as a newspaper reporter before
 joining the staff of this magazine 3 years
 ago.
 During his 2 months in southeast Asia he
 covered every form of air operations from
 the Strategic Air Command Boeing B-52
 strikes based on Guam to the Cessna O-1E
 light plane spotter missions.  He traveled
 over 1,600 miles in the combat theater visit-
 ing USAF, Army, and Marine air squadrons
 and flew combat missions as an observer in
 three types of McDonnell Phantom 2 strike
 fighters, a Bell UH-1D helicopter, a North
 Amerioan F-100F, and a Grumman OV-1A
 Mohawk Army reconnaissance aircraft.  He
 also went on board Navy carriers operating
 off the Vietnam coast to report on their
 operations.
 His series will provide A.W. & S.T. readers
 the same type of accurate detailed technical
 information on the aerospace equipment de-
 ployed in southeast Asia, its operational ef-
 fectiveness and its future requirements, as
 did the 17-part series written by National
 Editor Cecil Brownlow after a similar assign-
 ment in Vietnam last spring.
 The urgent need for this type of informa-
 tion was amply demonstrated by over 8,000
 requests for reprints of the Brownlow Viet-
 nam series received from industry and mili-
 tary organizations all over the world.
 Editorial- coverage from combat zones is
 both dangerous and costly.  But the aero-
 space industry has  pome to -depend  on
 Aviation Week & Space Technology to pro=
 vide it with this type of information that it
 so vitally needs.  We will  not shirk this
 responsibility in Vietnam or any other por-
 tion of this troubled globe.-ROBERT HoTZ.

 Under Fire
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. DANIEL J. FLOOD
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr.  FLOOD.            Mr.  Speaker,  under
 leave to extend my remarks in the
 RECORD, I include the following:
 MRS. ROBERT MCNAMARA: WIFE OF A MAN
 UNDER FIRE
 (By Lloyd Shearer)
 Ladies of America.  How would you like
 to pick up your newspaper.each morning
 and read that your husband was cold, aloof,
 distant,  unfeeling,  and  withdrawn * * *
 arrogant, austere, and strict * * * prudish,
 precise,  and straitlaced * * * stiff, stern,
 rigid,  and humorless * * * a walking en-
 cyclopedia * * * a man whose bloodgtream
 consists of computers instead of cells * * *
 an inflexible automaton, stubborn and un-
 yielding in the face of error * * * the second
 most powerful man in the Nation responsible
 for the war in Vietnam, the confusion in U.S.
 foreign policy, the Selective Service Act, the
 black market in Saigon, and the fate of this
 country?  Also  a  lot  of  other  downright
 distortions.
 How would you like each day to have your
 husband sniped at by the press, the public,
 and the prima donnas of Congress?
 How would you like to have him criticized,
 insulted,  accused,  condemned,  disparaged,
 vilified,  and  lampooned?  Especially  when
 you knew from 25 years of marriage with this
 able, brilliant, dedicated, versatile man that
 practically all the criticism was incorrect.
 This, in large measure, is the position
 Margaret McNamara, wife of Defense Secre-
 tary Robert McNamara, has found herself
 in these past 5 years.
 A  lovely,  gracious,  blue-eyed,  shapely,
 petite brunette (5 feet 3, 116 pounds), a one-
 time California high school teacher (biology
 and physical  education at Alameda and
 Sausalito), intelligent, well read, au courant
 with the latest events, Margaret McNamara
 comes well equipped to refute the criticism
 leveled at her husband.  But she has never
 succumbed to the temptation.
 I HAVE TO STRIKE BACK
 "The only time I really get angry," she
 admits, "is when they accuse Robert of being
 dishonest.  He may commit an occasional
 error in judgment-which one of us does
 not?-but dishonesty is so foreign to his
 character that I just have to strike back.
 Usually I write a nasty letter, get rid of my
 resentment that way, then tear the letter up.
 "When someone you love has become the
 national sitting duck," she explains, "the
 constant target of criticim, it's only natural
 for his wife to become defensive.  But over
 the years I've learned not to let it affect me
 too much.  The antidote to falsehood, fre-
 quently born of jealousy, power struggles,
 superficial first impressions but rarely of
 knowledge, is truth.  When you know what
 the truth 1s about your husband, the deep,
 verified-by-living-with-him truth, then when
 something isn't true, you don't let it bother
 you.
 "'I'm sure the wives of Senators and Con-
 gressmen and other in Government service-
 someone like the President's wife, Mrs. John-
 son, who's an old Washington hand-have
 learned the art of living with criticism-but
 it does take time, patience, and frequently
 great understanding.
 "You see," Margaret McNamara adds, the
 voice soft, sincere, and friendly feminine,
 "there's always the problem of children.  Our
 three are young, sensitive, easily hurt, and
 when their hard-working father gets 'blasted'
 as they put it, they wonder why.  It seems
 so unfair to them.
 "Take Margy, our eldest, 24 (a graduate
 student in anthropology at Washington Uni-
 versity in St. Louis).  Some of the boys she's
 dated have been classified IA, and I'm sure
 they've let her know that they think her
 dad responsible, which of course, he's not.
 Before we left Ann Arbor for Washington,
 before  Bob  accepted  President  Kennedy's
 offer to join his Cabinet we'd all read Ken-
 nedy's                                                                              book,  'Profiles  in  Courage:   We
 learned that the experiences of many people
 in Government aren't particularly easy.  If
 a man believes he's right, if he's running
 against the tide, if he's breaking down old
 and established customs, Government service
 is no bed of roses.  And when someone like
 Robert, for what he considers the benefit
 of the entire country, cancels contracts and
 shuts down unneeded installations after the
 most careful and thorough research, well, the
 hue and cry from the local level can become
 a deafening roar.
 "But like us, the children have learned to
 roll with the punches, to understand what
 personal participation in Government entails.
 As President Truman said, 'If you can't stand
 the heat, get out of the kitchen.'  I guess
 we've learned to take It."
 Before Robert Strange McNamara moved
 his family to Washington in early 1961, he
 worked his way up in less than 15 years at
 the Ford Motor Co. from administrative
 executive to controller (1949) to vice presi-
 dent in charge of all cars and trucks (1957)
 to president (1960).  In 1959 his salary and
 bonuses came to $410,833.  Had he remained
 as president in 1961 instead of resigning to
 accept the Defense position in Kennedy's
 Cabinet at $25,000 per year, his annual com-
 pensation would have topped the $500,000
 mark.  In addition he would have been able
 to exercise options on 60,000 shares of Ford
 stock, half at $23.71, half at $33 in a bull
 market which zoomed the stock to $117 a
 share.
 When Henry Ford was asked recently what
 it cost Bob McNamara to leave Ford for
 Washington, he said, "We figure about $500,-
 000 a year in salary and supplemental com-
 pensation plus about $31/2 million in stock."
 When McNamara worked for Ford he lived
 a peaceful life with free weekends in the
 college town of Ann Arbor, Mich.  He at-
 tended the First Presbyterian Church, took
 a leading role with his wife in civic enter-
 prises-they were among the first residents
 to sign a covenant designed to end racial dis-
 crimination in the sale of local real estate-
 and contributed independently to candidates
 of both political parties.  He rose early,
 about 6, worked long and hard, frequently
 putting in 12-hour days, but he went skiing
 with his family in winter, climbed mountains
 with them in summer, lived the good and
 modest life devoid of status symbols.  (The
 McNamaras still own and drive a 1960 Ford,
 a 19$1 Falcon, buy their clothes off the rack.)
 In a materialistic society where money is
 equated with power and success, it seems in-
 credible, but the truth is-and this is funda-
 mental to any true understanding of their
 philosophy-the   McNamaras   give   scant
 though to the financial sacrifice or prestige
 involved in Government service.
 "When Sargent Shriver came out to see my
 husband in 1960;" Mrs. McNamara explains,
 "and  told  him  that  President  Kennedy
 wanted him to serve in his Cabinet either
 as Secretary of Defense or Secretary of the
 Treasury, Bob was truly surprised. He'd only
 just been promoted to president at Ford the
 previous. month, and his first reaction was
 to question his own qualifications for such
 high Government office.  He quickly turned
 down the Treasury job because he said he
 hadn't had enough banking and fiscal ex-
 perience.
 "Later when he spoke to President Ken-
 nedy directly, he told him that his experi-
 ence in defense was very limited.  Bob had
 served as an officer in the Air Force during
 World War rl but that was a good 15 years
 back.  He recommended several other men
 and told the President in all honesty that
 he wasn't the man for the job. He just
 didn't have enough experience.
 "The President said he wasn't aware that
 .any training school existed either for Presi-
 dents or Cabinet members.  And I think it
 was after that remark, perhaps a little later,
 that Bob  asked President Kennedy if he
 himself  had  really  written  "Profiles  in
 Courage." The President said yes, and Bob
 was most pleased, but he kept insisting that
 Kennedy was making a mistake in offering
 him a Cabinet membership.
 "I can honestly say," Margaret McNamara
 declares, "that we never really thought about
 or discussed the difference in salary levels
 between Government and private employ-

 went.  We had always thought---Bob had al-
 ways thought, that at some time he'd like
 to give his time and effort to the Govern-
 merit when asked, never realizing that he
 would be asked as soon as he was.  But when
 you're asked, you don't say no, not at least
 when you feel as strongly as he does, I guess
 as we all do in our family, about making
 some contribution to good government."
 MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS
 Where and how the McNamaras developed
 their dedication to public service and their
 high quotient of idealism is difficult to deter-
 mine.  Neither comes from a family with
 any considerable history of government serv-
 ice.                Both spring from the heart of the white
 collar American middle class.
 Margaret  McKinstry  Craig   (Mrs.  Mc-
 Namara's maiden name)                          was born in the
 1 tate of Washington in 1915. Her family
 moved to California when she was a child,
 and she was raised in Alameda across the bay
 from San  Francisco  where  her  dad sold
 insurance.
 Robert Strange McNamara (Strange is his
 mother's family name) was also raised with
 a sister, Peggy, in the San Francisco Bay
 area,  They were children of a wholesale shoe
 company executive.   The elder McNamara
 was 25 years older than his wife, and people
 who knew him describe the gentleman as
 a still', dignified, businesslike man."  It is
 entirely possible Robert: McNamara inherited
 his devotion to hard work, his power of great
 concentration,  his  proven  organizational
 genius, and his reserved manner from his
 lather.
 SWEET NOT SACCHARINE
 Margaret Craig of Alameda High School
 and Robert McNamara      of Piedmont High
 both attended the University of California
 at Berkeley, class of 1937.  She was in Alpha
 Phi, pretty, vivacious, bright, naturally at
 case with people.  "If you ask me for one ad-
 jective to describe Margy," says a friend of
 long  standing,  "I  would  use  the  word
 'sweet'--not in the cloying, saccharine sense,
 but in the sense of her being thoughtful and
 unselfish, the very feminine qualities you
 find in a well-bred young girl.  She is still the
 sweetest, most considerate woman I know."
 McNamara was a Phi Gamma Delta, popu-
 lar, serious, brilliant, industrious.  He made
 Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year, was a big
 reran on campus.  Both attended many of the
 same classes, but they never dated. In those
 years McNamara saw a great deal of Annie
 Lee Whitmore, an attractive coed at Stan-
 ford.
 It was only after he'd returned from 2
 years at Harvard Business School and worked
 as an accountant for Price Waterhouse & Co.
 that he  and Margy began dating.      Their
 courtship was relatively short and to the
 point.  "We started going around together,"
 Mrs. McNamara recalls, "in May 1940.  About
 4  months  later we  were  married  in  the
 Episcopal Church in Alameda. It was on
 August  13.   ':['hat same  day we held our
 wedding reception on the docks.   Then we
 caught a boat which took us through the
 Fanama Canal to New York.  That boat trip
 was our honeymoon."
 When she examines her marriage, now in
 its 26th year. Margaret McNamara finds it
 full, exciting, constantly growing.  "I'm so
 glad I married Bob," she confessed to a col-
 lege classmate not long ago.  "If I'd mar-
 ried someone else I'd probably be a happy
 bay area housewife today, living in a typical
 suburban world.  But being the kind of man
 he is, interested in everything--art, music,
 literature, science, nature--Bob has made a
 wonderful life for his family.  He's taught
 us all so much."
 Subsequently a reporter asked Mrs. McNa-
 mara If living with a former college profes-
 sor and corporation president, an expert on
 budgets, statistical controls, and quantita-
 tive analyses, hadn't given her an inferiority
 complex.  "Your  husband,"   he  declared,
 "supervises a budget of more than $50 billion
 in the Defense Department.  Who makes the
 budget; in your household?  Who makes the
 family decisions?"
 Margaret McNamara quickly laughed.                                                                            She
 likes to laugh, likes to smile. "I don't suf-
 fer from any inferiority complex," she said.
 "At least I don't think I do.  Family de-
 cisions with us have always been a ;joint ef-
 fort.  Over the years I've become a little bet-
 ter organized, but I've also learned that some-
 times :Bob enjoys a little family disorganiza-
 tion.  Then he straightens things out.
 "As for the budget, we set that out to-
 gether.  Then  I  try  to  keep  it.  But  it
 doesn't always work.  I have a sliding rule
 I call accrual.  That's my expansion pro-
 gram beyond the set budget."
 What she has learned most from her hus-
 band, she believes, is the important tech-
 nique of decisionmaking, of first realizing
 what is most important, then setting a goal,
 then implementing the method of achieving
 that goal.  "Decisiveness," she admits, "was
 not one of my outstanding qualities when I
 first got married.  But I've learned over the
 long  pull to ,make  decisions  after giving
 them the best possible thought, the best pos-
 sible care, and then not to worry about them
 but to go on to the next goal."
 If    admittedly her husband    has  taught
 her   much, what has Margaret McNamara
 contributed to the marriage?  In addition to
 three bright, well-raised children, Margy 24,
 Kathleen 21, a student at Chatham College
 in Pittsburgh, and Craig 15, at St. Paul's
 School in New Hampshire---she has contrib-
 uted a well-run household, and atmosphere
 of love, loyalty,  and livability,  an always
 available companionship, a calm, friendly,
 supporting disposition, and what a doctor
 friend aptly terms "the contagion of con-
 sideration."  She makes relatively few de-
 mands of her husband.
 Secretary of Defense is a mankilling job.
 It drove James Forrestal to suicide years
 ago, and it is amazing that Robert McNa-
 mara can maintain the pace he does, 12- to
 18-hour days, 6 days per week, flights to
 Europe, Texas, Vietnam, periodic appearances
 before congressional committees, constantly
 spouting impressive quantities of knowledge,
 constantly replenishing the source of energy
 which drives him inexhaustibly on.
 One reason he's able to continue this furi-
 ous regimen, and still maintain good humor,
 unharried manner, excellent physical condi-
 tion, and admirable emotional balance is that
 his wife is cheerfully willing to go along
 with the almost superhuman goals he sets
 for himself.
 KEEPS BOB AT EASE
 In her scheme of marriage, she is primarily
 a wife and mother, in that order,  "What I
 try to do," she says, "is keep Bob at ease.
 He generally gets up at 6. and so do I.  I
 make him his breakfast about 6:30, and he
 leaves for the Pentagon about 6:50.   This
 gives me a chance to read two newspapers
 (the Washington Post and the New York
 Times).  Since the children have all gone
 off to school I've taken on some local com-
 munity action projects in Washington, be-
 cause I feel very strongly about home rule.
 Citizen participation at the local  level is
 terribly needed in the city of Washington.
 I also spend time on the poverty program,
 visiting, Women's Job Corps, and I'm also
 interested in the nationwide beautification
 program.  That's why when the President's
 wife asked me recently to represent; her at
 the Governor's conference on beautification
 in California, which I consider my home
 State, I couldn't turn her clown."
 Another reason the McNamaras accomplish
 a great deal is that they are not particularly
 social creatures.  They seem too inner-di-
 rected for that-she less than he- so that
 very rarely do they ride the Washington, D.C.,
 cocktail circuit.  A certain amount of social-
 izing especially with other Cabinet members
 is necessary, but their idea of an evening
 well spent is to retire after dinner and read
 in bed.  A few weeks ago the following read-
 ing matter lay beside their bed: "Report to
 Greco" by Nikos Kazantzakis, the Kennedy
 books by Schlesinger and Sorensen, "History
 of the Sierra Nevada" by Francis Farquhar
 (the McNamaras and their children have
 climbed the Sierras for years), issues of the
 New Yorker magazine containing the seriali-
 zation of Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood."
 Except for an occasional high-level meet-
 ing                                                                                                                                      and  weekend  interruptions  Secretary
 McNamara    does  no work at home.        "He
 leaves everything packaged right on his office
 desk," Mrs. McNamara reveals.  "He doesn't
 want to rehash or re-do it or go through it
 all again.  Home to him is a place where
 he can relax and recharge his batteries. And
 I try to keep it that way.  We have a cook
 and a woman who comes in to clean a few
 days per week.  And that's about all.  Bob
 returns home: from work anywhere from 7
 p.m. to 9, earlier on Saturdays, and I always
 wait to eat with him.  He's a man. who enjoys
 overworking himself, and I don't mind the
 long hours he puts in.  It's just that the
 pressures  keep  mounting.   That's  what
 brings on fatigue, and that's what worries
 me."
 By nature, however, Margy McNamara is
 no worrywart.  She is one of those delight-
 fully optimistic women who soar through
 life giving strength by giving love and un-
 derstanding.                                                                                                                                              Of  the  oftrepeated  charge
 leveled against her husband that he is "a
 human I.B.M. machine," she says: "Ask the
 people who've met and talked with him.
 They'll tell you he's got a marvelous sense
 of humor.  It's true that he suffers fools
 badly especially if they impede his work,
 but he's a friendly, polite, decent human be-
 ing, a marvelous father who smiles with and
 at his children, who helps them with their
 homework,  especially  math-really  he's  a
 good man.
 "I think this image of his being distant
 and interested only in computerized judg-
 ments springs from many factors.  To be-
 gin with he's easy to caricature especially
 by cartoonists.  He wears glasses. He's tall.
 He parts his hair neatly and cleanly a little
 to the left of center:  There is very little
 that's humorous about the problems he faces
 or the decisions he must make.  They don't
 lend themselves to the emotional approach
 but their effect on people is very emotional
 and very serious.  So those who don't know
 him regard him as forbidding.   But ask the
 people who've hiked and skiied with him.
 He's a man who enjoys much more than
 work."
 In discussing his life with the man she
 calls "Kip," Margaret McNamara makes her
 marriage sound like a carefree, memorable
 picnic from its very inception.  She glosses
 over the early years of World War II when
 her husband, rejected for service by the Navy
 because of his eyes, went to England, was
 there commissioned a captain in the Air
 Force.  She says relatively little of her duty
 tour as a GI bride, of moving 13 times with
 an infant during the course of the war, of
 living in a basement in Salina, Kans., of con-
 tracting infantile paralysis along with her
 husband and of being hospitalized  for 9
 months.  She says nothing about the months
 of  waiting  when  McNamara  was  shipped
 overseas to Calcutta and she found herself
 traveling from Boston to Alameda to Kansas
 City to Washington.
 LTCKIER THAN MOST
 "Compared to most young brides with hus-
 bands in the service," she declares, "I was
 lucky."
 Reporters who've covered McNamara since
 he arrived in Washington more than 5 years
 ago, say he's much more diplomatic now in
 handling people, particularly low I.Q. Con-

 of independence in Lithuania. The fol-
 lowing  resolution  was  unanimously
 adopted, which was duly signed by Albert
 G. Vinick, president, 4227 Euclid Avenue,
 East Chicago, Ind., and Peter Indreika,
 secretary, 3946 Parrish Avenue, East
 Chicago, Ind.:
 Whereas the United States of America has
 been in the forefront of the United Nations'
 activities ending foreign colonialism in nu-
 merous Asiatic, African, and European coun-
 try's; and
 Whereas the Soviet Union has been and
 still is striving in many devious ways to
 win official recognition by the free world of
 its rapacious and illegal occupation of Lith-
 uania, and the other two Baltic States of
 Latvia and Estonia; and
 Whereas despite the fact that many former
 colonial territories have been liberated and
 admitted into the United Nations as sover-
 eign states in the last 20  ears, the Soviiet
 Union, while speaking out strongly for the
 abolition of all colonialism, has in actuality
 made Lithuania, Latvia, a d Estonia into
 the newest colonies in the Soviet Russian
 empire: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved, That we again express our grati-
 tude to our Government for the firm and
 unwavering policy of nonrecognition o?f. the
 illegal Soviet occupation of Lithuania and
 the other two Baltic States, and request our
 Government  to  use  every  opportunity  to
 raise the question of the liberation of these
 nations; and
 That our Government refuse to ratify the
 Counsular Convention with the U.S.S.R.,
 which would only be the means for the So-
 viet Communists to establish more espionage
 centers for subversive activities in our coun-
 try; and
 That this resolution be esnt to the Presi-
 dent of the United States, to the Secretary
 of State, to the Senators, and Members of
 Congress from our States, and to the press.
 These are familiar points.  To them Mr.
 Johnson added another.  In answer to those
 who debate whether the Communists should
 have a share of the Government of South
 Vietnam he said, "We stand for self-deter-
 mination-for free elections-and we will
 honor their results."
 No free elections can be held in South Viet-
 nam so long as the Communist terror tactics
 of brutal torture and wholesale assassina-
 tion of village leaders hold much of the
 countryside in thrall.   Safety, enforced by
 military means, and hope, in the form of
 agricultural and industrial aid and educa-
 tion, must be brought to those who have
 suffered through more than 20 years of war.
 That is the reason for and the objective of
 the U.S. course in Vietnam, and the reitera-
 tion of those aims should be sufficient to end
 serve the kind of world we want to live in-
 a world in which each nation is free to de-
 velop in its own way, unmolested by its
 neighbors, free of armed attack from the
 more powerful nations."
 Today, the Communist-controlled govern-
 ment in North Vietnam doesn't want to talk
 peace.  When negotiations are mentioned, it
 is insisted that the Vietcong-the Commu-
 nist                                                                                                                                 faction  in South Vietnam-must  be
 recognized as the sole representative of the
 South Vietnamese people.
 President Johnson's role has been exceed-
 ingly difficult as well as delicate.  It would
 be safer for his planning tactics if he didn't
 have to make any public statements about
 the future course of the war. The enemy
 should be left guessing.  But the President
 understandably finds it necessary, in order

 Mr. YOUNGER.  Mr. Speaker, it is

 David Lawrence should point out to the
 American people his views on "The
 Greatest Danger on Vietnam." His col-

 Star on February 25, and follows:
 THE GREATEST DANGER ON VIETNAM
 (By David Lawrence)
 "This is it"-few people are making such
 a comment out loud about Vietnam, but
 many are thinking it to themselves.   For
 more and more it is beginning to be realized
 that the United States is passing through
 its biggest crisis since World War H. The
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN A. RACE
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. RACE.  Mr. Speaker, there is an
 apparent, and I might add, unfortunate,
 lack of understanding of U.S. objectives
 in Vietnam.
 Once again, our President enunciated
 these objectives in clear, unmistakable
 language last week in New York.  In
 commenting on this speech, the Chicago
 Sun-Times said the President's reitera-
 tion of our aims "should be sufficient to
 end the current debate" over U.S. policy
 in Vietnam.
 I commend this editorial and insert it
 in the RECORD:
 THE  PRESIDENT'S  ANSWER
 President Johnson has answered the criti-
 cism                raised             against  the administration's
 Vietnam policy in the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee hearings.
 The President explained, again, that the
 U.S. course of conflict in Vietnam is limited
 in its objective to stopping Communist ag-
 gression.  The U.S. purpose, he said, is "not
 conquest; it is not empire; it is not foreign
 bases; it is not domination."  He said that
 the United States does not threaten Red
 Chi"
 conflict in Vietnam is no small or isolated
 affair.  It has become worldwide in its signif-
 icance, and it could turn into a larger war
 if the American people are misled into think-
 ing that "peace at any price" is worth-
 while.
 The greatest danger is not in Vietnam but
 in this country, where well-meaning but con-
 fused and uninformed persons are unwit-
 tingly engaged in helping to bring on the very
 calamity they profess to be against-a major
 war.
 The fallacies being spread are numerous.
 It is being assumed, for instance, that the
 President alone is making the policies.  Ac-
 tually, he is surrounded by advisers of the
 highest rank in civilian and military posi-
 tions.  They are not partisan in their think-
 ing-they are  conscientious and                                                                                 patriotic
 Americans anxious to assure the safety of
 this country. Republican leaders, too, are
 openly supporting the policies of the Gov-
 ernment.
 Nobody, of course, wishes to see a large
 war precipitated, but this is certain to hap-
 pen if the enemy begins to take seriously
 the demonstrations and speeches inside the
 United States which give an impression of
 cravenness and weakness.  Secretary of De-
 fense Robert S. McNamara, in his report to
 Congress this week, said:
 "If we and our free world allies fail to meet
 the Chinese Communists' challenge in south-
 east Asia, we will inevitably have to confront
 it later under even more disadvantageous
 conditions.  The road ahead will be difficult
 and sacrifices will be required of our people,
 both in money and in lives.  But we have no
 other reasonable alternative if we are to pre-
 ,
 namese Armies.   The President said in a
 speech this week:
 "If. the aggressor persists in Vietnam, the
 struggle may be long.  Our men in battle
 know and accept this hard fact.  We who are
 at home can do as much.  There's no com-
 puter that can tell the hour and day of
 peace, but we do know that it will come only
 to the steadfast-never to the weak in heart."
 Johnson was first accused of not wanting
 to negotiate peace, but he has sent many
 ambassadors  and  recently  Vice  President
 HUBERT HUMPHREY around the world to make
 it clear to all countries that America wishes
 peace.  This, hdwever, has been construed
 abroad as a sign of weakness, and Johnson is
 finding it desirable to repeat frequently that
 American policy is not weakening.
 Actually, as the President has just said,
 the tide of battle has turned.  There is evi-
 dence of a desire throughout the world to
 reinforce  the  American  military  effort  in
 Vietnam.   South Korea, Australia, and New
 Zealand    have already  sent   forces  there.
 Other nations are giving more and more
 indications of their support.
 The Vietnam war, indeed, has taken on a
 worldwide meaning and is clearly being de-
 fined as a struggle between the free world
 and the Communist revolutionaries who seek
 to  impose their  will on helpless  peoples.
 There's really only one way to shorten the
 war, and that is to bring about a united
 America and to put in proper perspective
 the utterances of the misguided persons in
 public and private life who don't seem to
 understand the kind of enemy the United
 States is figlit4ng in Vietnam.

 Mr. BYRNES                                           of  Wisconsin.  Mr.
 Speaker, under leave to extend my re-
 marks, I include the partial text of a
 speech I delivered at the Lincoln Day
 dinner of the Republican . Party                                     of
 Brown County, Wis., in Green Bay on
 February 22, 1966:
 Lincoln has many messages for modern-day
 Americans.  He spoke eternal truths which
 will long serve to guide us in our affairs.
 There is  one message  he  addressed  par-
 ticularly to Republicans.  He said:
 "It is exceedingly desirable that all parts
 of this great Confederacy shall be at peace,

 and in hartnony one with another. Let us
 Itepubllcans do our part to have it so. Even
 though much provoked, let us do nothing
 through passion and ill temper."
 I think this is wise party policy for Repub-
 licans at any time but particularly now when
 our Nation faces such critical problems, both
 at home and abroad.
 We must reserve our ourselves the right to
 dissent; no tree nation can long remain free
 without it.  But we know that the right of
 dissent, like every other right, carriers with
 it a responsibility.  That responsibility is to
 make sure that our dissent is not frivolous,
 self--serving, or, at worst, harmful to the na-
 tional security.   It should not spring, as
 Lincoln advised, from "passion or ill temper."
 It ought to be considered and constructive.
 Tire Republican Party has met this test
 with flying  colors  during  the  continuing
 crisis in Vic'nam.
 We are nut- as are some members of his
 own party, stabbing the Commander in Chief
 in the back with criticisms which impugn.
 the motives of our country and give aid and
 comfort to the enemy.  We have criticized,
 certainly.  But I think the record is clear
 that our criticism, because it is aimed at the
 support of the American effort, has given no
 ammunition to the Communist propaganda
 machines.
 Republican criticism stems from a deep
 concern.  It is a concern for the future of
 this Republic.
 We are concerned that the sacrifices being
 made in Vietnam shall not be made in vain--
 that we do not lose what our troops are
 fighting so valiantly to preserve. We fear
 that, if we make the wrong choices, freedom
 throughout  the  world  will  be  gravely
 endangered.
 It so happens that I strongly agree with the
 bipartisan policy which finds us fighting on
 the side of the Vietnamese in order to pre-
 vent  their                       enslavement   by  communism
 through  the  use  of  force  and  terrorism.
 Freedom in this world is a lost cause, it
 seems to mc, unless someone is willing to
 stand up and light to prevent its permanent
 disappearance.   if  we deny  freedom     its
 chance in Vietnam, freedom is in danger
 throughout the world.  If successful in Viet-
 nam, the so-called Communist wars of lib-
 eration-the modern method of aggression--
 will  continue.                        Eventually  and   inevitably
 this Nation will be forced to take a stand
 at another place.  The costs then-in lives
 and treasure---could make the Vietnam war
 look like a minor skirmish.
 I fervently hope this Nation has not for-
 gotten the  essons of two world wars.  The
 iirst lesson we learned is that the aggressor--
 whether he be Kaiser Wilhelm or Adolph
 flitter, or Mao Tse-tung-will continue his
 aggression ;just as long as it remains profit--
 able.  The second lesson is that the United
 States, if it wants to save itself, must act to
 stop the aggression sooner or later.  And the
 third lesson is that the longer we wait, and
 the more courage and power we allow the
 aggressor to achieve, the bloodier and more
 costly is the final struggle, with the outcome
 more and more in doubt.
 Ti Communist aggression in the Far East
 continues to be profitable, if it is allowed to
 succeed at little cost, that aggression will
 continue.  ']'hose who want its to get out of
 Vietnam owe it to us, I believe, to tell us
 where they believe we should make the next
 stand.  If they say that the success of Com-
 munist aggression in Vietnam means the end
 of Communist aggression in south Asia, then
 I must say that every logic and every lesson
 of history is dead against them.
 I do not believe Americans will accept that
 kind of advice.  On the contrary, I believe
 Americans generally are in strong agreement
 with the policy which finds us in Vietnam--
 the policy that says the United States, in its
 own  self-interest,  cannot allow piecemeal
 Communist aggression to succeed and be-
 come profitable.
 Yet, one can feel across the land an un-
 easiness among our people over our position
 in Vietnam.  I submit, however, it is not the
 basic policy which concerns Americans.  It
 is the conduct of that policy.
 This uneasiness over the conduct of our
 policy in Vietnam strengthens the position
 of those who advocate, either directly or in-
 directly, abandonment of south Asia to the
 tender mercies of the Communists.  It would
 be a great tragedy if they prevail. It is for
 that reason that Republicans feel a deep
 obligation to point out the errors of omis-
 sion and commission which are threatening
 a policy essential to the preservation of free-
 dom and our own security.
 I suggest that we greatly need two things
 from the President and his administration.
 The first is candor and facts.  The second is
 a clear-cut decision.  The President is re-
 puted to be a great politician, but I think he
 underestimates the capacity of the American
 people to support difficult decisions once they
 are given possession of the critical facts.  It
 is high time that we started getting the
 unvarnished truth about Vietnam.  The ads
 ministration's record of playing square with
 the American people on Vietnam is an ex-
 tremely poor one.
 The President misled the people in the
 1964 campaign.  He gave the country, as we
 Republicans well remember, the impression
 that there would be no enlargement of our
 military activities there.  The American peo-
 ple were not told, in 1964, the seriousness
 of the situation in Vietnam. We now know
 that the Communists were close to winning
 the war in the 1964 and early 1965 period.
 We have been consistently misled by ad-
 ministration  officials.                                                                                         Secretary  of  State
 Rusk told us in April 1963, that the corner
 had been turned. In October of that year,
 Secretary  of Defense McNamara predicted
 that, by the end of 1965, the major part of
 the American military aid program          could
 be ended.   Yet only a short time ago, he
 would only go so far as to say "we have
 stopped losing the war."
 Very  often,  in addition,  the President's
 actions in regard to Vietnam seem more to
 confuse  than to enlighten;  they give the
 impression of an administration either thor-
 oughly  uncertain  about  its  objective  or
 more interested in creating some kind of
 effect upon public opinion than in actual
 results.
 Thus, we have the hastily arranged Hon-
 olulu conference with its  emphasis upon
 economic progress in Vietnam; we have the
 hastily arranged Humphrey visit promising
 new programs and more American gold at
 every stop;  we have the sudden presenta-
 tion of the Vietnam issue to the U.N. Secu-
 rity Council, a matter in which we have
 apparently since lost interest.
 It is no wonder that Washington is talk-
 ing                                                                         about,       and  Americans  are  feeling,  a
 "crisis of credibility." That is what Ambas-
 sador Goldberg calls it, and really. it's just
 a fancy way of saying that people are getting
 in the habit of not believing their Govern-
 ment is telling the whole truth.
 The first thing we need, then, is some old-
 fashioned candor from the administration.
 We ought not to have to guess the factual
 situation in Vietnam and the Far East; we
 ought to be kept fully advised.  We ought
 not be kept in the dark ,as to what our real
 objective is  in Vietnam:  we ought to be
 told. and Hanoi should be told.  We ought
 not be flimflammed as to the kind of sacri-
 fices that will be required to reach our ob-
 jective; we ought to be informed.                                                                                 Above all,
 recognizing that for security's sake, we can-
 not be told everything, we ought not to be
 misled by either false optimism or pessimism
 as to the true situation.
 When  the  people  have  been given  the
 facts,  this  administration needs to make
 a national decision.  It has to decide wheth-
 er it is fighting a war in Vietnam or whether
 it is not.  I do not say this facetiously; I
 say it in all seriousness, and I say it again,
 and underline my words.
 We are engaged in a war In Vietnam but
 this nation has not yet made a decision that
 it will fight  a war in Vietnam.   On  the
 contrary,  the  administration  has avoided
 that decision.  Instead it has been trying
 to find a consensus rather than to create a
 consensus.
 War is a serious business which ought not.
 be undertaken without having success as a
 goal.  Successful war requires knowing what.
 one is fighting for in specific terms, in mili-
 tary terms, if you will.  It requires a will-
 ingness to commit power to achieve those
 objectives.  it requires sacrifices and it re-
 quires, if public support is to be kept as it
 must be kept, that those sacrifices be shared
 as  equally  as possible. War requires re-
 sources and, unless it is a very small war in-
 deed, it requires a nation to pass up tem-
 porarily its less urgent needs in order to fill
 the immediate critical ones.  War requires
 dedication and concentration of effort.
 We are committing hundreds of thousands
 of men and billions of dollars to armed con-
 flict in Vietnam without fulfilling any of
 these requirements.  The people do not know
 what our military objectives are in Vietnam..
 We have not been willing to commit the
 power needed to achieve whatever those ob-
 jectives are;  we are instead holding back
 power.  We are not cutting back domestic
 programs to pay for the war; we are, in fact,
 adding new ones and enlarging others.  We
 are not concentrating our efforts on the war;
 we are simultaneously engaged in every kind
 of activity under  the sun,  including the
 greatest  roadbuilding  program,  the  most,
 costly exploration program and the most ex-
 pensive foreign aid program in the history of
 the world.
 We are, in short, engaged in war in Vlet-
 narn with all that means in terms of death
 and privation for our fighting men, without
 having decided to fight a war, with all that
 means in terms of hardship, sacrifice and
 risk for the people back home.
 I, for one, do not believe this situation
 can long prevail.  The first kind of war can-
 not be successful without the second.  The
 American people will, I believe, either be
 summoned to join in a national decision that
 we mean business in Vietnam, or the Amer-
 ican people will one day reject the mounting
 costs and casualties of a half-hearted war
 being fought by a nation that can't make
 up its mind what it's fighting for.  If that
 happens, if this Nation sneaks out of Viet-
 nam in abandonment of both principle and
 the friendship and trust of a free people,
 then I fear indeed that we will have set the
 stage for an eventual vast world conflict we
 are all trying so desperately to avoid.
 How can we as a people, how can our
 fightingmen, how can Hanoi or Peiping be
 convinced we have really determined to fight
 this war when they see some of the things
 going on here at home-on the domestic
 front?
 Look at the budget-the financial plan of
 this Nation--which has been presented to
 us by the President.
 In a time of war, particularly one which
 comes when the economy is booming, when
 shortages are appearing, when the demand
 for manpower is intensifying, a nation needs
 to adopt a budget of restraint.  It needs to
 adopt a budget which says, "Let's proceed
 with  caution;  there  is  possible  trouble
 ahead."  It should shun like the plague an
 expansionary budget in an already greatly
 expanded economy, lest it supply those last
 few breaths of air which cause the balloon
 finally to burst.
 Yet, how would you characterize a budget
 which proposes that this Nation not only

 February 28, iI ,provede8 ft%4ffiaRA5p%ibgb-RDPPq7 I      000400030001-4    A1015
 undertake all its normal expenditures while
 paying the heavy costs of the war, but pro-
 poses to increase domestic spending for new
 programs just enacted and, on top of every-
 thing else, proposes new programs which will
 cost still more money?
 This is not a war budget: it is the kind of
 budget you would propose if you wanted to
 stimulate a depressed economy in peacetime.
 It is potentially a very dangerous budget: it
 can bring on economic dislocations, miser-
 able in themselves, but exceedingly harmful
 to any war effort.
 This is a budget which proposes to spend
 the fantastic amount of $112.8 billion in 1
 year-more than this Nation has ever spent
 in any other year, including the World War
 II  years.  But  that  amount  understates
 actual spending;   $6 billion from the sale
 of assets has been used to reduce the spend-
 ing estimate;                 actual expenditures will be
 almost $119 billion and will be kept that
 low if, and it's a big if, Congress is able and
 willing to go along with a great number of
 phony cuts in the budget.
 There has been a $37 billion a year increase
 in the level of spending since 1961 and don't
 think this has been all because of the war.
 Only a third of that increase can be attrib-
 uted to Vietnam.
 While the administration was trying last
 year to convince Hanoi of our seriousness in
 Vietnam, the administration was prodding
 the last session of Congress to turn out the
 largest program of domestic spending this
 Nation has ever seen.  It is difficult to blame
 anyone for thinking that this Nation was
 more concerned with its domestic affairs than
 with fighting a serious war.
 As a result of that program enacted last
 year, as the result of continuing large-scale
 appropriations for new programs, look at
 what our people, our fighting men, and our
 enemy can read in the newspapers.  Here are
 three items I came across within the last few
 days.
 Remember we are a nation at war-an ex-
 tremely costly war.
 Item No. 1.  From the Washington Evening
 Star.    "Washington is receiving a Federal
 beautification grant  of $483,000 for land-
 scaping around buildings.  Other cities who
 are receiving grants are Pittsburgh which
 will get about $465,000 and New Haven, about
 $325,000."
 Item No. 2.  From the newsletter of the
 National Education Association.  "The U.S.
 Office of Education is concerned lest some of
 the nearly $1 billion Congress made available
 under title I of the (education) act go down
 the  drain   because  local  school  districts
 haven't yet figured out how to use it prop-
 erly."
 Item No.  3. From the Washington Daily
 News.           "The Baltimore Health Department
 has requested a Federal grant of $300,000 to
 conduct an antismoking campaign-in the
 fifth grade of the city's public schools."
 Does this sound like  an administration
 which has decided to make the hard decisions
 required by the kind of war in which the
 Nation is engaged?
 We did not act like a nation at war in
 1964, nor in 1965, nor are we doing so today
 and as a consequence, the war drags on.  We
 apparently will not act like a nation seriously
 at war during fiscal 1967-if we are to enjoy
 all of the luxuries which we will lavish on
 ourselves under the President's budget.
 What  about  the  period  beyond   that?
 After all, we are told we will be heavily en-
 gaged for a long time in Vietnam-some high
 officials even  talk  about a generation of
 conflict.
 But, Hanoi and Peiping, if they look at the
 budget closely, will conclude that we must
 be planning to get out, because we will be in
 a frightful fiscal situation if the heavy costs
 of the war continue into the  next fiscal
 period.  That is so because this budget is
 being financed with future revenues.  We are
 selling assets; we are taking advantage of
 windfalls; we are speeding up tax collections
 to reduce this year's deficit.  There will come
 a time, and soon, when those wells will run
 dry, and then we will either have colossal
 deficits, or colossal tax increases, or both,
 plus Federal controls, if the war continues.
 A nation which has made a decision to fight
 a bitter war to a successful conclusion would
 not dare take such a grave risk.
 Abraham Lincoln, to preserve the Union,
 and in defense of freedom, summoned up the
 entire energies of the Nation to fight a brutal
 war, brother against brother.  "The man," he
 said, "does not live who is more devoted to
 peace than I am, none who would do more
 to preserve it, but it may be necessary to put
 the foot down firmly."
 I think America is now waiting for the foot
 to be put down firmly.  It is waiting for the
 national decision which sooner or later must
 be made.  It is waiting for a decision, not to
 prolong a bitter war, but to shorten and end
 it; it is waiting for a decision which, in the
 long run, will enable us to prevent a major
 war which would set the world aflame.

 JAMES FARLEY RINGS THE BELL
 (By Patrick F. Scanlan)
 We have read many articles and speeches
 and have witnessed considerable debates and
 lectures on the situation in Vietnam, but no
 speaker has said as much as James A Farley
 in an address he delivered in Dubuque, Iowa,
 last week.  Mr. Farley speaking:
 "President Johnson did not adopt a war
 policy.  He had war thrust upon him.  Our
 position in South Vietnam is not like a
 Normandy beachhead.   It  is  more like a
 Dunkirk.  The President is in the same posi-
 tion as Winston Churchill in 1940.  He is
 a receiver in bankruptcy of the policy of
 appeasement. Appeasement has brought our
 affairs in Asia to this sad state. Continued
 appeasement will not only lose Vietnam, it
 will lose us our Asiatic allies and greatly im-
 pair our Atlantic Alliance.
 "The President, like Churchill, can only
 offer us blood, sweat and tears;      but if we
 attempt to run away, the pressure will in-
 crease every time.  The fact is that had the
 policy of the President been adopted in 1946,
 instead of 1966, there would be peace in the
 Pacific right now."
 [From the Bridgeport (Conn.) Post,
 Feb. 14, 1966]
 POLICY OF APPEASEMENT
 Former Postmaster General James A. Far-
 ley has voiced an interesting view on the war
 in Vietnam.  Speaking at a dinner in Du-
 buque, Iowa, the onetime National Demo-
 cratic chairman said:
 "President Johnson did not adopt a war
 policy.  He had war thrust upon him.  Our
 position in South Vietnam is not like a Nor-
 mandy beachhead.  It is more like a Dunkirk.
 The President is in the same position as
 Winston Churchill in 1940.  He is a receiver
 in bankruptcy of the policy of appeasement.
 Appeasement has brought our affairs in Asia
 to this sad state.  Continued appeasement
 will not only lose Vietnam, it will lose us our
 Asiatic allies and greatly impair our Atlantic
 Alliance.
 "The President, like Churchill, can only
 offer us blood, sweat, and tears; but if we
 attempt to run away the pressure will in-
 crease every time.  The fact is that had the
 policy of the President been adopted in 1946,
 instead of 1966, there would be peace in the
 Pacific right now."
 Statements like this are making the late
 Gen. Douglas MacArthur a greater man all
 the time.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. CONTE.                                                                             Mr. Speaker,  I was
 pleased to note in a recent issue of the
 Washington Post, an editorial devoted to
 the late Newcomb Mott, of Sheffield,
 Mass., and to the events and circum-
 stances of his tragic and shocking death
 in Soviet Russia.
 The editorial stresses a point I have
 made consistently throughout the now
 famous Mott case. It was a point I made
 at the time of his trial and sentencing
 last fall, and again when the news of
 his death came as such a blow to the
 free world.
 That point is, of course, that we must
 take every step in an effort to prevent
 such a thing ever happening again.  I
 made the point, and I continue to be-
 lieve, that an improved consular treaty
 with, the Soviets would provide both na-
 tions with the means to avoid an irre-
 vocable action, to expedite notification
 procedures, and to permit certain steps
 to be taken on behalf of the individual
 involved before the inexorable machin-
 ery of the Soviet Government is set in
 motion.
 I have speculated in the past that
 Newcomb Mott might be alive and free
 today if such a treaty had been in force
 last summer when young Mott was ar-
 rested for illegally crossing the Red
 border.  I happen to believe this very
 strongly, although it is hardly construc-
 tive to be able to say, "I told you so."
 What is constructive, however, and
 what is vitally more important is that
 we take steps to prevent another Mott
 tragedy. We must take the initiative in
 providing  safeguards  for  Americans
 traveling not only in Russia but any-
 where behind the Iron Curtain where
 the fingers of the secret police can reach
 with impunity.
 We who have been closest to the Mott
 case, the Massachusetts congressional
 delegation, have repeatedly called for a
 full and complete investigation of the
 circumstances of young Mott's death.
 Since this implies full cooperation of the
 Soviets, however, it is unlikely that we
 will ever really know the truth.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD --APPENDIX      February 28,, 1966
 Nevertheless, we have insisted that the
 State Department exploit every possible
 means to learn the truth.   We have
 called upon the administration to act in
 this regard.
 The consular treaty is quite another
 matter, of course, and, as .I have said, it
 is a, far more important matter.  Here
 the burden of action is upon us, upon
 the legislative branch rather than the
 executive.  More specifically, it is upon
 the Senate.
 The proposed Soviet-American Con-
 sular 'T'reaty would hold the Soviet Union
 to reasonable standards in notifying the
 American Embassy of a U.S. citizen's
 detention.  It would also permit access
 to him during the initial period of his
 detention, rather than only at the time
 of his trial as in the Mott case.
 In spite of these and other important
 provisions which would work to the ob-
 vious advantage of all U.S. travelers in
 Russia or elsewhere in the Soviet orbit,
 the treaty has been bottled up in the Sen-
 ate Foreign Relations Committee. It has
 been the victim of opposition from those
 who fear what the Soviets might have to
 gain, rather than optimism for what the
 United States might gain.  It has been
 opposed by those who would safeguard
 American security by raising the Iron
 Curtain a little higher and making it
 more opaque.  It has been opposed by
 those who would prefer to risk further
 sacrifice of men like Newcomb Mott than
 to concede that protection for Americans
 abroad can best be achieved through bi-
 lateral agreements.  Their solution is to
 advise Americans to stay out of Soviet
 countries.
 Ii; is my hope that the Members of the
 other body will soon see the error in their
 judgment and will take action on this
 vitally important instrument.  I would
 remind them that by turning their backs.
 on this treaty they are serving only the
 forces of hatred, prejudice, and interna-
 tional  tension and misunderstanding
 which, more than anything else, were the
 direct causes of Newcomb Mott's ordeal.
 Mr. Speaker, the editorial which I have
 already mentioned contains these and.
 other points which I feel are worthy of
 attention by the Congress. I have unani-
 mous consent that the editorial appear
 at this point in the RECORD:
 EDITORIAI. FROM WASHINGTON POST
 The erratic performance of the Soviet Gov-
 ernment, in the Mot]; case and others, gives
 the State Department no choice but to warn
 American tourists of the hazards they may
 encounter :in Russia.  Ordinarily the Depart..
 ment would have no business intervening in
 it  citizen's  plans to visit a country with
 which diplomatic relations are maintained.
 It would be derelict, however, not to warn
 that tourists who inadvertently run afoul
 of Russian laws may be treated with undue
 harshness for political reasons.
 11 the warning costs Moscow some Ameri-
 can  tourist dollars, then the Russians are
 hltxy because they have it entirely within
 their  power  to  resume  fair  treatment of
 tourists and render the warning obsolete.
 Doubtless this will be a matter for intense
 private discussion between Intourist, the oili-
 cial travel agency, and the KGB, the secret;
 police.   Almost certainly the Mott case and
 others like it are the work of the KGB.
 Lest one forget, an effective partial re-
 course Is available in the Soviet-American
 consular treaty, which has yet to be ratified.
 It would hold Soviet authorities to reason-
 able standards in notifying the American
 Embassy of an American's detention and in
 permitting access to him.  It would thereby
 remove much of the arbitrariness from the
 Soviet handling of American prisoners and
 much of the grounds for apprehension. from
 Americans contemplating travel in Russia.
 The consular treaty remains lodged in the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee largely
 because its opponents conjured up the spec-
 ter of a threat to American security.  The
 tragic death of Newcomb Mott, while a So-
 viet prisoner, should make clear the advan-
 tages of protection to Americans which the
 treaty would provide.

 STAY  IN  AND  WIN-TEN  EDITORS  AGREE  ON
 VIET ISSUE
 (By Donna Logan)
 Ten Colorado newspapermen interviewed
 Friday  by  the Denver  Post  unanimously
 agreed the United States shouldn't get out
 of Vietnam.
 The editors and publishers declared to the
 last man that America was in the fight to
 win, and shouldn't pull out.
 They were questioned at the Brown Pal-
 ace Hotel where newspaper executives from
 throughout the State are attending the 88th
 annual convention of the Colorado Press As-
 sociation.
 The  editors  were  asked:  "Should  the
 United States get out of Vietnam?" Their
 answers:
 Fred Pottorf, editor and publisher, Holly
 Chieftain, Holly, Colo.: "No. We ought to
 strengthen our position in southe:;st Asia as
 well as strengthen the Southeast Asia Treaty
 Organization (SEATO).  We should stay over
 there and destroy their supply routes and
 win the war."
 Dick  Hilker,  editor, Jefferson  Sentinel,
 Lakewood: "No, I don't think we :should get
 out.  We might as well light there as some-
 place else, even though Vietnam may not be
 the easiest place to del'crrd.  We've made a
 commitment there and we might as well keep
 it.,,
 R. W. Cook, Meeker Herald, Meeker, Colo.:
 "I'd say riot.   I think the Government is
 pursuing the correct course and they have
 all the facts and know what they're doing.
 I think it's the right thing."
 Dewey Brown, publisher, Montezuma Val-
 ley Journal  and  Cortez  Sentinel,  Cortez,
 Colo: "No, I don't think so.  A year ago I
 thought  the  United  States  was playing
 footsie in Vietnam, but I don't; think so now
 and I think we should continue our effort:;
 there.  It isn't just a matter of saving face.
 We're too far committed to get out now."
 Preston Walker,  editor,  Grand Junction
 Daily Sentinel, Grand Junction, Colo.: "No,
 I agree with the President's position and I
 think if we get into a fight we ought to stay
 in it until we win.  The pacifists and dem-?
 onstrators here are weakening our position.
 I'm with the President in supporting our
 policy there."
 Fred Betz, Jr., copublisher, Tri-State Daily
 News, Lamar, Colo.:  "No.  I think we are
 committed there.  We should push for in-
 vestigation and discussion of the war in the
 United Nations-that's the best answer.    But;
 until then I think a harder effort on our part
 is needed.   I'm sorry the issue didn't get;

 Allegiance Day
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROBERT T. ASHMORE,
 OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. ASHMORE.  Mr. Speaker, Feb-
 ruary 22 was Allegiance Day in my home
 State, South Carolina.  I am advised
 that the people of my State responded
 in tremendous numbers to the Allegiance
 Day  celebrations  conducted  in  every
 county seat in South   Carolina.  I be-
 lieve this date was chosen appropriately,
 since on that date we also observe the
 birthday of our first President, George
 Washington.
 In stressing this occasion in South
 Carolina we wish to publicly proclaim
 our feeling of confidence in the policy of
 the administration to assist Vietnam, or
 any other Communist-threatened  na-?
 tion.  The ultimate question to be re-
 solved is whether or not the                                                                                                                        United
 States will deter Communist aggression,
 infiltration, and domination of Vietnam,
 or possibly, the entire area of southeast
 Asia.  I believe the United States has
 chosen wisely in its determination to

 the  commissioned  officers  of  the  armed
 services.
 The Senate agrees, for the Senate has
 passed a bill to the.effect but the matter has
 been stalled in the House and is bottled up
 in .the House Judiciary Committee.
 That bill should be called out of commit-
 tee, taken to the floor of the House and ap-
 proved.
 It is conceivable that some future Attor-
 ney General could appoint-as Director of
 the FBI-a man who might not share Edgar
 Hoover's concern about communism.
 If that should happen, and the FBI should
 fall heir to the same, careless kind of security
 that has marked the State Department, then,
 indeed, the security of this Nation would be
 in peril.
 Think about it.
 Criticism of British Shipping to
 North Vietnam

 having mentioned the giant Russian planes
 delivering supplies to the North Vietnam
 Government.  Such British shipping as goes
 into Haiphong does not carry strategic ma-
 terials."
 Sharman quoted a statement by Secretary
 of State Dean Rusk saying he was not aware
 of any munitions supplied by the British by
 ship to the Vietcong and citing drastic re-
 ductions in free world shipping to North
 Vietnam.
 ONLY $500,000
 Exports and imports together between the
 United Kingdom and North Vietnam last
 year came to only half a million dollars, the
 Atlanta-based consul general added.
 CALLAWAY said he stood by his speech.
 Speaking to newsmen on other topics, CAL-
 LAWAY predicted a 2-percent increase in cor-
 porate taxes and an increase in personal in-
 come taxes from the administration.
 Mr. THOMAS SHARMAN,
 Consul General, the British Consulate,
 Atlanta, Ga.
 DEAR  MR.  SHARMAN:  I  sincerely regret
 that your abrupt departure on Monday at
 the Atlanta Rotary prevented our discuss-
 ing further the matter of allied shipping to
 North Vietnam.
 From what you said to me, and your fol-
 lowup statement to the press, I understand
 your position to be that British shipping to
 North Vietnam is nonstrategic; that it has
 been substantially reduced; and, that my
 criticism of British shipping without men-
 tioning Russian aircraft deliveries gave an
 unfair impression of the situation.
 Mr. Sharman, I find your position utterly
 indefensible,  for the obvious reason  that
 any nation-and especially a nation at war-
 expects more from its allies than it does
 from its enemies.  I am totally at a loss
 to understand why Britain, as a long-stand-
 ing friend, would insist that its actions be
 judged identically to the actions of a long-
 standing and present enemy.  To do so, I
 feel, would insult our friendship, and there-
 fore, I choose not to make such a compari-
 son.  Instead, my colleagues and I ask Brit-
 ain to let its actions stand on their own
 merits ar demerits, and to answer to them
 in that light.
 Certainly we  feel that British shipping
 to North Vietnam is entirely unjustified, if
 for no other reason than that free world
 shipping of nonstrategic goods frees Com-
 munist shippers to carry the instruments
 of war.   But    more  important  than  this
 is the principle involved: that as long as
 our enemy is engaged in a war effort against
 America and American men, we cannot con-
 done our friends supplying even so much
 as a spool of thread to that effort.  I do not
 find our position unreasonable, but I would
 never have believed that we would have to
 express it to a friend of such long standing,
 and worse, that it would be rebuffed.
 My colleagues in the Congress and I have
 and shall continue to press for a cessation
 of free world shipping to our enemy, and
 I can promise you that our exchange has
 only added to my determination that this
 be done.
 Sincerely,
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker, I
 have spoken many times about the free
 world ships entering the port of Hai-
 phong. I have placed in the RECORD the
 statistics on this shipping.
 My good friend, BO CALLAWAY, in a
 speech before the Atlanta Rotary Club,
 quoted these figures and "incurred the
 wrath" of the British Consul General.
 I place in the RECORD an article from
 the February 15, 1966, Atlanta Constitu-
 tion and a copy of a letter Congressman
 CALLAWAY wrote the Consul General.  I
 agree wholeheartedly with Bo CALLAWAY.
 The material follows:
 BRITISH CONSUL CRITICIZES CALLAWAY'S
 TRADE BLAST
 Criticism of British shipping to North
 Vietnam  by Representative  HOWARD  (Bo)
 CALLAWAY touched off an exchange between
 the Congressman and British Consul General
 Thomas Sharman Monday.
 In a speech before the Atlanta Rotary Club,
 CALLAWAY said the United States must block-
 ade the port of Haiphong to end the war and
 criticized Washington's refusal to ask our
 allies to stop commercial shipping to North
 Vietnam.
 Then he said most of the ships entering
 Haiphong are British and added, "We're not
 even getting our British allies to stop ship-
 ping.  How can we back our troops?"
 After his talk, Consul Sharman was among
 members  of  the  audience who  gathered
 around to talk to CALLAWAY.   When the two
 came together, Sharman began gesturing and
 seemed to speak in angry tones.
 He ended the conversation with a brisk,
 "Good day, sir," and walked quickly from the
 room.
 Later he said in a prepared statement that
 he had told Representative CALLAWAY that he
 thought his comments had given an "unfair
 and unbalanced impression" of the actual
 situation in Vietnam shipping.
 CALLAWAY had said "that in 1964, some 400
 free ships, mostly British, entered the Hai-
 phong port, and in 1965 there were. 200,
 again mostly British."
 In his statement, Sharman said;
 "I told Mr. CALLAWAY at the end of the
 meeting that I thought he had given an un-
 fair and unbalanced impression in.speaking
 only of free world shipping, mainly British,
 carrying materials into Haiphong and in not

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX      February 28, 1966
 and the Vietnam war rebels in his own party.
 lie sent highly respected Gen. Maxwell D.
 Taylor to the witness stand of the Senate
 Foreign  Relations Committee  to  tell  the
 rebels that the purpose, the means, and the
 weapons in the war are all strictly "limited."
 At the end of 61/2 hours of ordeal for the
 general, the Senate rebels were not convinced
 that the gap was not closed.
 ,.IMITS QUESTIONED
 '['hen it was Dean Rusk's turn.   As the
 Johnson administration's chief foreign-policy
 spokesman, the Secretary of State pointed
 out that American policy in Vietnam has
 been repeatedly reaffirmed by Presidents and
 by Congress.  He also referred to the solemn
 obligations  of  the  Southeast  Asia  Treaty
 Organization treaty as the legal basis for the
 U.S, commitment in Vietnam.
 Mr. Rusk then invited Congress to vote
 again on Vietnam war policy "if there is any
 doubt about it," and contended that the
 whole structure of world peace was at stake
 in Vietnam.  These two statements drew fire
 respectively  from  Senator  WAYNE MORSE,
 Democrat, of Oregon and Senator J. W. FUL-
 piuouT, Democrat, of Arkansas, the commit-
 tee chairman.  Senator FULBRIGHT contended
 the Vietnam conflict does not involve the
 vital  interests of the  United  States  but
 alight nonetheless  become   "a  trigger for
 world war."
 The rebellion in the President's party is
 precisely over tile issue of how limited the
 Vietnam war is intended to be.   Among his
 critics, the suspicion is lively that the Ameri-
 can involvement is "open ended" and could
 eventually "escalate" into a major war with
 Communist China and conceivably even a
 world. war involving the Soviet Union.
 General Taylor's assignment had been to
 end the rebellion by satisfying the desire for
 reassurance about the plans. and purposes of
 the White House.  According to the general,
 the strategic purpose is limited because it
 consists solely of applying just enough mili-
 tary force to North Vietnam to cause it to
 desist from its aggression in South Vietnam.
 taut he was unable to be precise about the
 amount of force which would be necessary
 to achieve this purpose.  Would it be 600,000
 men against the present 200,000?  The gen-
 eral agreed that there probably would be
 some increase in the number of American
 troops sent to Vietnam, but could not say
 what the limit might be.
 CONGRESS NOT SATISFIED
 `['he weapons used are limited, according
 to the general, because of U.S. unwillingness
 in employ nuclear weapons.
 The geographic area of the war is limited
 because bombing outside of South Vietnam
 is  confined  to strictly military targets in
 North Vietnam.
 13ut all this failed to quench the rebellion
 because   it  identifies  limits  presently  put
 upon the policy but fails to provide assur-
 ance against the lifiting of limits to higher
 ones at another time.
 'the Congress is left at the end of the
 second week of the hearings still unhappy
 about the course of the Vietnam war and in
 c. state of unsettled friction with the White
 House.
 The President is left in the position of
 many a general in the past who found him-
 self reluctantly involved in a battle at a time
 and place not of his own choosing.
 PERSONAL ISSUE AT BASE?
 How it all started is a matter for some
 suture historian to sort out in detail.  Exist-
 ing information would suggest, at least su-
 perficially, that a simple personal issue be-
 tween the President and Senator J. W. FuL-
 IRIGHT provided the original spark.
 The Senator wrote a report on the inter-
 vention in the Dominican Republic which
 was nighly critical of the administration.
 The President countered by cutting the Sen-
 ator off the White House guest list.  The
 feud was on.
 Everything since has seemed to make it
 worse.  Slighting remarks the President is
 alleged. to have made about the Senator, and
 others, in private conversations have been
 reported back.  The Honolulu trip may or
 may not have been intended to take head-
 lines away from the Senate hearings, but
 Senator  FILBRIGHT  and his colleagues be-
 lieved that it did.
 DEPRESSION   CLIMATE  RECALLED
 It has become one of those issues which
 will go dawn in history.  It has altered the
 President's  relations  with  the   Congress
 sharply, and perhaps permanently.        The air
 in  Washington  is  different.  For veterans
 with long memories there is a similarity to
 the mood of Washington in the days just
 after  the great depression of  1929  broke.
 Herbert Hoover  the  great  engineer,   sud-
 denly became a highly vulnerable political
 target.
 Today, as in the last part of the Hoover
 administration, many a member of the Pres-
 ident's party is wondering whether the Viet-
 nam war may not turn out to be as bad for
 Democrats in 1966, and conceivably 1968, as
 the depression was had for Republicans from
 1932 down to World War If.
 As for the outside world, it is left in a
 state of necessary uncertainty about the fu-
 ture course of American policy.  The Presi-
 dent has made one concession to his critics.
 He has had General Taylor declare that policy
 and purpose are all strictly "limited."  But
 there is still no official proof that. today's
 limits will not he raised tomorrow, or the
 day after.
 Democracy-What It Means to Me
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. STANLEY R. TUPPER
 OF MAINE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. TUPPER.        Mr. Speaker, the win-
 ner of the VFW Voice of Democracy
 contest from the State of Maine is a
 constituent of mine, Miss Diane Louise
 LeBlond, a student at St. Joseph High
 School in Biddeford, Maine.  Her essay
 "Democracy-What It Means to Me," is
 a moving statement from a concerned
 young American and I make her remarks
 a part of the RECORD so that my col-
 leagues may have an opportunity to read
 them :
 "DEMOCRACY-WHAT IT MEANS TO ME"
 (By Diane Louise LeBlond, St. Joseph High
 School, Biddeford, Maine.)
 "To some generations, much is given; of
 some generations, much is expected."  These
 words             were  uttered  by  Franklin Delano
 Roosevelt at the 1936 National Democratic
 Convention.             But where do we, the teenage
 population of America 1965 fit in?    What is
 our role in the march of democracy today?
 Certainly no other generation has been
 blessed. with the same opportunities we have.
 A greater percentage of young people is at-
 tending college now than ever before and
 the number is Increasing steadily every year.
 New and interesting careers are being opened
 to our generation because of the immense
 strides the United States has made in scien-
 tific  fields  lit recent  years.  We hold  the
 rights our forebears struggled for so many
 years to assure us.  Above all, we live in a
 democracy-the  most powerful, respected
 democracy on the face of the earth,  All of
 this has been handed to us on a silver plat-
 ter, and, consequently, we too often take
 these gifts for granted.
 We are very quick to claim all of these
 privileges and very voluble indeed in our
 protests whenever we feel our rights are be-
 ing encroached upon.  But I fear that too
 many among us would be very surprised and
 even offended if told that our rights are
 accompanied by duties and that unless these
 duties are discharged, we have no rights at
 all.
 What, then, is expected of us as the civic,
 social, and moral leaders of a tomorrow that
 looms large and near?  These great expec-
 tations can be summed up In two words--
 education and involvement.
 We owe it to ourselves and to our country's
 future to obtain the finest and most earn -
 plete education we possibly can.  To be a
 completely  educated  individual mesas  to
 be a moral, tolerant human being.  One is
 not tolerant who refuses to share a lunch
 counter, or a bus, or even a drinking foun-
 tain with a person whose skin color merely
 happens to differ from his own. One is not
 moral who would allow a fellow human be-
 ing to be harmed, even killed in his presence
 without even taking the trouble to call the
 police.  One cannot  call himself educated
 who does not develop an interest in current
 events, who does not bother to form sound
 opinions concerning  current  issues.  And
 one is not educated who is a follower of the
 crowd,   unconvinced of  its  principles but
 never daring to be different, never attempt-
 ing to stand up and be counted according to
 his real beliefs.
 Once we are well educated concerning the
 facts and the issues, we are ready for the
 second step-:involvement.  We are ready to
 act as teenagers all over the country are
 acting,  crusading  for  worthwhile  causes.
 Teenagers  are  crusading  for  civil rights.
 They are supporting their chosen political
 parties, joining Teenage Republicans, Teen
 Dems,   organizing  get-out-the-vote drives,
 alerting their elders to the issues. to the
 candidates and  to the importance    of  in-
 formed, intelligent voting.  They are doing
 volunteer work with orphans, with dropouts,
 with retarded children.  All over the country,
 teens are our strongest Peace Corps boosters,
 Our most militant war-on-poverty workers.
 They  are  today's responsible,  dedicated
 teenage generation laying a solid foundation,
 striving to become tomorrow's better edu-
 cated, moral, tolerant, and democratic so-
 ciety.                                                                                                                                    They  are realizing that with every
 right comes a  duty. Moreover,   they  are
 coming to see that the satisfaction derived
 from performing these duties is so great as
 to be its own reward.  They are summoning
 each and every one of us to carry the torch
 that has been passed to a new generation-
 our generation.  And it is only when we be-
 come illuminated with this fire of devotion
 to our country and to our fellow man that
 we will come to know the true meaning of
 democracy.

 "Puget Sound: What It Is," who ana-
 lyzes this great area where I come from.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 PUGET  SOUND:  WHAT  IT  IS
 (By Don Page)
 We're back on the beat after a month or
 more with the savants and titans of the un-
 derwater  world,  finding                          out  about  Puget.
 Sound's impressive stake in oceanography.
 We hope you're reading the series that re-
 sulted.  The writing may not be any great
 shucks, but the things we talk about there
 are exciting.
 One thing you won't read in the oceanog-
 raphy series but one that impressed us is a
 general summary of Puget Sound.  It's taken
 from a UW survey of more than a decade
 ago.  The language is technical in places, but
 the information is solid.
 We got it from Dr. Richard Fleming, of
 the UW Oceanographic Department.  We're
 passing excerpts of it along to you here. It's
 basic information.  We think you'll find it
 interesting.  Here it is:
 "Puget Sound includes the inland water-
 ways extending southward  into the State
 of Washington from the eastern end of the
 Strait of Juan de Fuca. These channels,
 sounds, and melts are long and narrow and
 occupy a basin roughly 90 miles north and
 south, 40 miles east and west.  Mountain
 ranges surround three-quarters of the area,
 The water area at mean higher high water is
 767 square nautical miles."
 Going on to more technical descriptions
 of shapes and bottoms, the summary tells
 how glaciers formed the Puget Sound Basin:
 "Glacier-borne sedimentary materials de-
 posited in a basin between the Olympic
 Mountains and the Cascade Mountains dur-
 ing the early part of the Pleistocene epoch
 were  deeply  entrenched  by  stream  and
 glacial  action  in  the latter part  of the
 Pleistocene.    The resulting steep-sided val-
 leys, one of which had not been subsequently
 filled with sedimentary debris,  now forms
 Puget Sound.
 "The mainland and island coastlines are
 irregular and backed by cliffs.  The beaches
 are narrow and confined to embayments, ex-
 cept for tidal flats on the river deltas.
 "Submerged shallow shelves are extremely
 narrow or entirely lacking, and in most areas
 the sea bottom slopes steeply to depths of
 300 to 600 feet.
 "The greatest depth of 930 feet is located
 just north of Seattle.  Puget Sound con-
 tains several elongated basins that are par-
 tially separated from the Strait of Juan de
 Fuca and from each other by shallow ridges
 or sills, such as those located in Admiralty
 Inlet, Tacoma Narrows, and the entrance to
 Hood Canal, where the depths range from
 150 to 200 feet.
 "Material on the sea floor varies from rock
 outcrops through boulders and cobbles in
 areas of strong tidal currents, to sand and
 mud on the slopes.  In some areas firm clay
 and compact glacia till are exposed on the
 slopes.  The bottoms of the deeper portions
 of the basins are covered with soft mud.
 "The tides in Puget Sound are of the mixed
 type showing a large daily inequality between
 the heights of succeeding low tides.  The
 average daily range at Seattle is 11.3 feet.
 "The maximum range of spring tides rarely
 exceeds 16 feet.  There is a general increase
 in range as the tide progresses from the Strait
 of Juan de Fuca to the heads of the inlets,
 with a delay in time of high water of about
 1 hour.
 "Due   to   the   large   area   of  Puget
 Sound and its narrow entrances, tidal cur-
 rents have exceptionally strong tropic veloci-
 ties, attaining 4.7 knots in Admiralty Inlet,
 5.1 knots in Tacoma Narrows and 7.2 knots
 in Deception Pass.   Elsewhere in Puget
 Sound the tidal currents are generally less
 than 1 knot.
 "Water temperatures in Puget Sound are
 relatively  uniform  throughout  the  year.
 Because of the mixing produced by the tidal
 currents, surface temperatures rarely fall be-
 low 44 degrees even in winter, except in the
 headwaters of Puget Sound where the ac-
 cumulation of cold river waters and relatively
 quiet conditions will permit the formation of
 ice during extreme cold weather.
 "The same mixing processes tend to main-
 tain relatively low surface temperatures dur-
 ing the summer, and except in shallow and
 isolated areas surface temperatures above
 60 degrees are rare."
 The summary goes on to tell how such
 streams as  the Skagit, Stillaquamish and
 Snohomish spill an average of 40,000 cubic
 feet of fresh water per second into the sound.
 The spillage varies from  14,000 to  37,000
 cubic feet per second according to the season.
 But its  busy tides and .current keep the
 sound's salinity level relatively high.
 That's Puget Sound as it looks to the
 scientists.  We hope you enjoyed this profile
 of an old friend and either learned a few new
 facts about it or were reminded of some
 you'd forgotten.

 Is Confusion a U.S. Secret Weapon?
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. YOUNGER.  Mr. Speaker, it is
 most interesting that Carl T. Rowan,
 formerly on the White House staff under
 President Johnson, should now write a
 column stbout the confusion existing in
 the policies of this administration.  In
 his column, published in the Washington
 Star on Friday, February 25, he asks the
 question "Is Confusion a U.S. Secret
 Weapon?"  Certainly no writer has a
 more intimate knowledge of the White
 House policymaking machinery than has
 Mr. Rowan. His column follows:
 IS CONFUSION A U.S. SECRET WEAPON?
 (By Carl T. Rowan)
 In 1928, the Italian dictator, Benito Mus-
 solini,  made this caustic comment about
 American Government:
 "Democracy is talking itself to death.  The
 people do not know what they want; they do
 not know what is best for them.  There is
 too much foolishness, too much lost motion.
 I have stopped the talk and the nonsense. I
 am a man of action.  Democracy is beautiful
 in theory; in practice it is a fallacy. You in
 America will see that some day."
 Dictator Mussolini is dead and American
 democracy probably never was more alive-
 yet the dictator's warning seems particularly
 pertinent these days.
 The country may not be talking itself to
 death insofar as the Vietnam war is con-
 cerned but it sure has talked up so much
 confusion that the American people do not
 know what they want or what is best for
 them.
 I left government 5 months ago think-
 ing I knew what U.S. policy in Vietnam was.
 Today I haven't the remotest idea.
 Lt. Gen. James Gavin went before a con-
 gressional committee to urge an "enclave"
 theory that administration spokesmen al-
 ready had assailed for days.
 The President then was quoted as saying
 that Gavin was more or less in agreement
 with his policies.
 ROBERT F. KENNEDY, in what almost every-
 one interpreted as a major break with the
 administration, urged that the Communist
 Vietcong be offered a share in a coalition
 government in South Vietnam.
 The displeasure of the Johnson adminis-
 tration seems emphasized by the speed with
 which the Kennedy proposal was denounced
 by Vice President HUBERT HUMPHREY, Under
 Secretary of State George Ball and McGeorge
 Bundy, the President's special assistant for
 national security affairs.
 Then up pops a story quoting Gen. Maxwell
 Taylor as saying that KENNEDY's views are
 "very, very close" to his own and to those
 of the administration.
 Taylor is former Ambassador to Saigon,
 presently a key adviser to the President and
 the man Johnson counted on to defend the
 administration against attacks from Senator
 J. WILLIAM FULBRIGHT and other members of
 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
 During the committee hearings, Taylor and
 FULBRIGHT seemed to have diametrically op-
 posed views on Vietnam.  Well, wonder of
 wonders.  The New York Times of February
 22 has a page 1 headline saying  "FULBRIGHT
 Backs  KENNEDY on Role for the Vietcong"
 and the New York Herald Tribune has a
 page 1 headline saying, "Taylor Siding With
 KENNEDY on Viet Plan."
 A White House spokesman first told me
 that Taylor's remarks had been misconstrued.
 Newsmen later quoted Taylor as saying that
 KENNEDY's remarks had been misconstrued.
 So KENNEDY's staff and White House offi-
 cials spent the better part of the day explain-
 ing that KENNEDY didn't mean exactly what
 he originally said; and if he didn't advocate
 what the White House thought he advocated,
 well, KENNEDY wasn't in as big a quarrel with
 the White House as anybody thought.
 But this is only a fraction of the confusion,
 the contradictions, the ambivalence that per-
 meates the American scene.
 The President launches a high-powered
 "peace offensive."  His emissaries roam the
 world and his Secretary of State says he
 would "be in Geneva tomorrow if I thought
 there would be anyone there to talk to."
 But a few days later a militant President
 speaks scornfully of "special pleaders who
 counsel retreat in Vietnam," calling them "a
 group that has always been blind to experi-
 ence and deaf to hope."
 The Vice President is sent abroad on a
 moment's notice, purportedly to light a fire
 under those engaged In the civilian side of
 the struggle, those trying to build a "great
 society" in southeast Asia.  But the journey
 draws to a close with talk of more troops
 from Korea, of fighting men from the Philip-
 pines and remarks giving the impression that
 we expect to fight our way out of our Asian.
 dilemma.
 Maybe all this doesn't add up to the "fool-
 ishness," the "lost motion," that Mussolini
 spoke  of.   Maybe  it's  supposed  to  be
 confusing.
 Maybe time will prove that it's all a new
 dimension of psychological warfare in which
 we get Hanoi, Peiping, the Soviet Union, and
 our allies so confused that everybody gives
 up.

 VUEEDOM LEADERSHIP MEDAL AWARDED
 1J!i. JAMES TURI'IN
 Dr. James W. Turpin, a native of Ashland,
 today was awarded the "Freedom Leadership
 Medal" by the Freedoms Foundation at Val-
 ley Forge, Pa.
 The award was one of seven special awards
 made to six individuals and one city.
 The U.S. Armed Forces and Department of
 Defense  were  given  the  coveted  "George
 Washington Award," the foundation's high-
 est.
 Dr. Turpin, of Coronado, Calif., won the
 award for his work in establishing, through
 Project Concern. Inc., the medical mission
 clinics in South Vietnam.
 The citation read:
 "For  his  courageous  and  compassionate
 answer to the challenges of the time through
 'Project Concern,' a voluntary medical mis-
 sion to the people of Vietnam.
 "For his Indefatigable personal efforts in
 creating hospitals, clinics, and intensive self-
 help medical training programs in the jun-
 gLes and vilkcges, and his resourcefulness in
 the face of Communist aggression.
 "For correlating the teaching of the ideas
 of freedom to the physical healing activities
 in the clinics.
 "For his personification of America's spirit
 of concern for others through personal ini-
 tiative, individual enterprise, and self-reli-
 ance."
 Dr. Kenneth D. Wells, president of Free-
 doms Foundation, released a list of more
 than 1,200 awards to American organizations,
 schools, and individuals from all walks of
 life throughout the Nation who are being
 honored in tiie foundation's 17th annual na-
 tional and school awards program for their
 contributions toward a better understanding
 and a greater appreciation of the American
 way of life.
 Another "Freedom Leadership Medal" went
 to Army Capt. Roger H. C.  Donlon, Fort.
 Ilrapgg, N.C., a Medal of Honor winner whose:
 inspiration was the sight of the American.
 flag flying on U.S. ships during daily trips
 to the beaches of South Vietnam-Old Glory
 cannot be flown in that nation.
 Joseph A. Brunton, Jr., New Brunswick,
 N.J., chief executive of the Boy Scouts of
 America, received  the  "American  Patriots
 Medal."
 Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., New York City, won
 the "Free Enterprise Exemplar Medal"; he is
 a corporation executive.
 The other four honors were "National Rec-
 ognition Awards."  Recipients were:
 Marie Davis Hunt, Worcester, Mass., for
 leadership in the establishment of "The Isaac
 Davis Trail" as national memorial and the
 role she played in the observance of "Patriots
 Day" each April 19, to commemorate the first
 shot in the Revoluntionary War in 1775.

 For Dr. Turpin, son of Mr. and Mrs. J. W.
 Turpin of 2419 S. Belmont Street, who are
 in Valley Forge with their son, it was the
 second time in 2 years he had been honored
 nationally.   The  U.S. Jaycees named him
 one of the Nation's 10 outstanding young
 men.
 Three years ago, Dr. Turpin left Coronado
 and a lucrative medical practice with his
 wife, four children, $6,000 and a dream.
 The 38-year-old made his dream a reality
 by establishing Project Concern, a nonprofit
 organization incorporated in California.
 lie went to Hong Kong where he estab-
 lished a floating clinic to which thousands
 of harbor dwellers who live on sampans and
 junks flocked.  More than 40,000 Chinese are
 superstitious that ill fate awaits them if they
 ever leave their floating homes.
 About 500 are treated daily and 1,000 chil-
 dren are given subsistence rations to ward off
 disease and sickness.  For most, it is their
 only meal.
 Later, Dr. Turpin moved to Vietnam, set
 up  an  18-bed  hospital  in  the  village  of
 DaMpao in the Montagnard County 150 miles
 northeast of Saigon, and worked only a short
 distance from the Ho Chi Minh trail known
 as a Vietcong artery for moving men and
 supplies southward.
 More than 100 doctors, nurses, and village
 medical officers trained by Dr. Turpin and
 his staff serve the Hong King and Vietnam
 clinics.
 The dream is still alive and eager as the
 "need to be needed" continues.  Dr. Turpin's
 next  goals are  clinics in  the Vietnamese
 province  of  Phubo:n  and  into  northern
 Thailand.
 Twelve other individuals and groups from
 Kentucky were selected for  1965 Freedom

 HON. JAMES H. (JIMMY) QUILLEN
 OF TENNESSEE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 28, 1966
 Mr. QUILLEN.                                      Mr. Speaker, the fol-

 Within a few years, John Edgar Hoover will
 retire from active service with the Federal
 Bureau of Investigation.
 A successor will have to be named and
 that-we suggest-is a matter of extreme im-

 No appointment will be of greater impor-
 tance than that of a Director for the FBI -
 the only Federal  agency the  Communists
 have been unable to penetrate.
 Yet, the choice of a Director is up to the
 Attorney  General alone.   The advice  and
 consent of the Senate is not required.
 It should be for the Director of the FBI has

 "I thought she was going to cry," a woman
 said, after Mrs. Thomas went inside.
 "Not on your life," her husband answered
 softly.  "She wouldn't let that happend."
 Now, the big cars began to arrive in a
 quick, sleek stream.  The riders were Con-
 gressmen, Senators, military men, and other
 officials from Washington, D.C.
 They arrived so quickly, the spectators on
 Clay Street were unable to recognize many
 faces.  Hardly anyone saw Gov. John Con-
 nally go in, but the onlookers didn't miss
 Senators RALPH YARBOROUGH and JOHN TOWER
 riding together.
 "How about that," an old man in a cowboy
 hat loudly exclaimed.    "Never thought I'd
 see those two being so friendly."
 No one replied to him, but some disap-
 proving looks told him he was off base.
 Finally, the word spread that the funeral
 service was underway, but the crowd outside
 stayed on.  The sidewalk on Clay between
 Main and Travis was packed solid.
 There was a lot of talk about Congressman
 Thomas, about how powerful he was in Wash-
 ington, about how his office door was always
 open and about how he never failed to reply
 quickly to any man's letter.
 One man told how Congressman Thomas
 always came to the Houston Post Office em-
 ployees' annual picnics.
 "And it didn't make any difference if he
 was running for office," he added.  "He was
 always our friend,  He never got so big he
 didn't  want  to rub  elbows  with working
 people."
 Then, just before the service ended, and
 the long drive to the     cemetery began,  a
 bum-or maybe just a poor man-hobbled
 up on a crutch, surveyed the crowd and lines
 of limousines.
 He let out a low, amazed whistle.
 "Criminy, would you look at those cars.
 What's going on here, anyway?"
 "Sshh," a lady in a red suit said, "You can
 see it's a funeral."
 "Who died?" he asked, whispering quietly
 this time,
 "Didn't you know?  It's the Congressman-
 Albert Thomas."

 MRS.  THOMAS  URGED  TO  SEEK  HUSBAND'S
 SEAT
 A move is afoot to get Mrs. Albert Thomas
 to fill her husband's seat in Congress.
 John    McClelland, candidate  for  State
 representative, position 4 In the 22d legisla-
 tive district,  is a leader of the effort to
 petition Mrs. Thomas to run for the interim
 congressional term of her husband.
 Thomas died  Tuesday  and  was buried
 Friday.
 "We hope to encourage and get Mrs.
 Thomas to run and get elected for the in-
 terim term ending January 1, 1967," Mc-
 Clelland said.
 He said it was possible that Thomas' name
 on the May 7 Democratic primary ballot for
 a new term would receive a majority of the
 votes.
 This would then make it possible for the
 county Democratic executive committee to
 select  Mrs.  Thomas  as  the  Democratic
 nominee in the November general election,
 McClelland said.
 Baytown chemist E. A. (Woody)  Rose is
 the only person to file for the Republican
 nomination.
 State Representative  Bob Eckhardt and
 Larry McKaskle, a former aid to Mayor Louie
 Welch, filed for the Democratic nomination
 in the May Democratic primary along with
 Thomas.
 Despite his death Thomas' name will be on
 the primary ballot since he had paid the full
 $3,000 filing fee.
 Mrs. Thomas has made no comment con-
 cerning the move to get her to fill the va-
 cancy caused by her husband's death.
 McClelland said that "because of her 30
 years in Washington with her husband she
 could pick up much more easily than any-
 one else the programs he initiated and was
 working on at the time of his death.
 "This committee intends to not only work
 actively, along with other volunteers, in get-
 ting petitions signed, but also to campaign
 on Mrs. Thomas' behalf to get her elected
 if she heeds the desire of those who want
 her to run," McClelland said.
 Governor Connally left for Laredo Friday
 with no indication he would call the special
 election to fill Thomas'  unexpired  2-year
 term over the weekend.
 Eckhardt  and  McKaskle  have  indicated
 they would be candidates in the special elec-
 tion.  Others may also pay the $500 filing fee.
 However, it was reported that McKaskle
 might change his mind and support Mrs.
 Thomas.
 Asked about the report, McKaskle said,
 "I have no comment to make until I first
 talk with her.
 "Mr. Thomas was a very good friend of
 mine.  So is Mrs. Thomas."
 Eckhardt declined comment on the possible
 candidacy of Mrs. Thomas and his own pol-
 itical plans in connection with the congres-
 sional vacancy.
 There have been reports that one Texas
 Congressman has tried to get Eckhardt to
 pull out in favor of Mrs. Thomas.
 "I have taken the position there ought to
 be at least a short political moratorium un-
 til after the (Thomas) funeral, and I don't
 think it appropriate to discuss the situation
 at this time," Eckhardt said.

 A TRIBUTE

 There have been so many splendid tributes
 to our late and beloved Congressman Albert
 Thomas, and our typewriter feels inadequate

 .print, too.
 "He was a friend of many"-this has been

 HARRIS POLL SHOWS AMERICAN
 PEOPLE SUPPORT DOMESTIC PRO-
 GRAMS AND DO NOT THINK A
 WAR  IN             VIETNAM  JUSTIFIED
 REDUCTION
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr. President,
 there has been much talk among many
 people that the American economy can-
 not continue to support our domestic
 programs in the face of our Vietnam ex-
 penditures and that there would have
 to be drastic cuts.
 In his state of the Union message,
 President Lyndon B. Johnson stated:
 I believe we can continue the Great Society
 while we fight in Vietnam.
 When I returned to Congress this ses-
 sion I pledged to the people of Texas that
 I would support legislation that would
 insure that the great programs passed
 during the first session of the 89th Con-
 gress would be run effectively.  I also
 expressed my faith in America's great-
 ness that these programs could be imple-
 mented without having to cut them back.
 To illustrate the opinion of the Ameri-
 can people that the domestic programs
 should be continued, I ask unanimous
 consent that the Harris poll in the Wash-
 ington Post of Monday, February 7, 1966,
 indicating that 72 percent of the public
 are convinced that the domestic program
 should not be reduced, and that educa-
 tion programs be supported first of all, be
 printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE HARRIS SURVEY-PUBLIC GENERALLY SEES
 No REASON YET To CHOOSE BETWEEN GUNS
 AND BUTTER
 (By Louis Harris)
 Although the American people tend  to
 think Congress should slow down from its
 1965 pace, 72 'percent of the public is equally
 convinced that President Johnson's domestic
 program should not be reduced in the face
 of mounting commitments in Vietnam.                         The
 popular conviction seems to be that 'a Na-
 tion so rich and prosperous need not yet
 choose between guns and butter.
 Conservatives who backed Barry Goldwater
 in 1964, southerners who have consistently
 resented Federal incursions into their way
 of life, even high-income groups who sus-
 pect recent tax cuts may be short lived are
 included among the solid majority opposed
 to reducing expenditures for key programs
 of the Great Society.
 When pressed to name those Government
 programs which in case of necessity ought
 to  be  cut  first,  two  prime  candidates
 emerged; the space program and aid to cities.
 The untouchables, in the judgment of most,
 would be aid to college education and health
 assistance.
 A cross section of the public was asked:
 "In general, because of Vietnam, do you
 think President Johnson should reduce the
 size of his programs at home, such as edu-
 cation, poverty, and health, or do you feel
 these programs should not be reduced?"

 AWARD TO SENATOR ROBERTSON,
 OF V:[RGINIA, OF THE GOOD CITI-
 ZENSHIP  MEDAL  OF  THE  NA-
 TIONAL SOCIETY OF THE SONS
 OF T(lil AMERICAN REVOLUTION
 Mr. HILL. Mr. President, a few days
 ago our distinguished colleague, the sen-
 ior Senator from Virginia, was given an
 award he richly deserves.
 Senator   ROBERTSON   was  presented
 with the Good Citizenship Medal of the
 National. Society  of  the  Sons of the
 American Revolution, which is its high-
 est award.                      The presentation was made
 through the Virginia branch, of which
 the Senator is a member.
 The certificate accompanying the gold
 medal points out:
 The society is dedicated to the patriotic
 purpose of perpetuating and inspiring the
 active practice and demonstration of those
 high ideals and principles which influenced
 and strengthened the founders of this Re-
 public and upon which the future of our
 Nation depends.
 Mr.  President,  the  great  Woodrow
 Wilson, proud of the fact that he was
 born in Virginia, once said :
 9 man's rootage is more important than
 Ms fruitage.
 The  rootage  of  Senator  ROBERTSON
 roes back to the first permanent set-
 tlement of Jamestown, Dr. John Wood-
 son,  who                            came  to  Jamestown with
 Governor      Yardley in  1619. Senator
 ROBERTSON     is a member of the James-
 town Society, made up of those whose
 ancestors lived in the Jamestown area
 prior to 1700.  He belongs to the Virginia
 chapter of the Society of the Cincinnati,
 limited to those who had an ancestor
 serving for 3 years in the Revolutionary
 War.  He holds membership in the Sons
 of the American Revolution, which is a
 much larger organization of descendants
 of Revolutionary ancestors, and of the
 Sons of the Confederacy, being a grand-
 :on of a Confederate officer who was
 killed in the Civil War.
 in fact, Senator ROBERTSON'S ancestors
 were in  every war this country  ever
 lought, and he served in the Army in
 World War I.
 With this "rootage" it is not surprising
 that he alas been a champion of patriotic
 citizenship, and student and defender of
 the ideals and principles upon which our
 Republic  was founded.  He  is indeed
 worthy of the tremendous heritage which
 is his as Senator from the State which
 PROPOSED     ACQUISITION     OF
 SPRINGFIELD,    THE    FORMER
 HOME  OF PRESIDENT ZACHARY
 TAYLOR
 Mr.  COOPER.    Mr.  President, on
 February 16, 1966, the Kentacky House
 of Representatives passed a resolution
 memorializing the Congress to consider
 appropriate legislation to acquire Spring-
 field, the former home of Gen. Zachary
 Taylor, the 12th President of the United
 States, and to acquire additional acreage
 for the expansion of the Zachary Taylor
 National Cemetery, both of w'rich are lo-
 cated in my State of Kentucky.
 The Honorable Troy B. Sturgill, chief
 clerk of the house of representatives, has
 forwarded. me a copy of this, resolution,
 and I ask unanimous consent that House
 Resolution No. '79, adopted by the Ken-
 tucky  House  of  Representatives  on
 February 16,  1966, be printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the resolu-
 tion was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 HOUSE RESOLUTION   9
 Resolution memorializing Gear. Zachary
 Taylor
 Whereas the remains of Gen. zachary Tay-
 lor, the 12th President. of the United States,
 and his beloved wife, Margaret, lie entombed
 in a  beautiful  marble mausoleum in the
 Zachary Taylor National Cemetery on the
 outskirts of Louisville, Jefferson County, Ky.,
 aurrounded by the graves of veterans from
 the Spanish American War to the wars of
 the present era; and
 Whereas a small group of patriotic Ken-
 tuckians under the leadership of Mrs. C. D.
 Greer,  of Louisville,  as  chairman  of  the
 Zachary Taylor Memorial Committee of the
 Outdoor Art League of Louisville, in 1921,
 undertook the task of beautifyi.ig the Zach-
 ary Taylor burial grounds, and to make of
 them a fitting resting place for this beloved
 soldier in the fall of 1922.  The first step to-
 ward the development of the pr ,ject was un-
 dertaken by the planting of pin oaks, and on
 March 10, 1924, the Kentucky legislature en-
 acted a bill which was signed by Gov. William
 J. Fields, requiring the State of Kentucky
 io deed to Jefferson County that part of the
 Zachary  Taylor  burial  grounds  and  road
 which had been deeded to the l1tate in 1881
 by Mr. George McCurdey, and on April 22,
 1924, Jefferson County appropriated $10,000
 for the building of a roadway leading to the
 burial grounds.  In June of 1924, the Honor-
 able Maurice Thatcher, Member of Congress
 from Louisville and Jefferson County, intro-
 duced a bill in the Congress calling for an
 annual appropriation for the maintenance
 of the grounds, the bill was enacted by the
 Congress and signed  by  President  Calvin
 Coolidge on February 24, 1925.
 Thus was established the Zachary Taylor
 National Shrine, and in 1926, the Kentucky
 Legislature enacted a bill which was signed
 by  Gov.  William  J.  Fields,  appropriating
 funds for the purchase of 15 acres of ground
 surrounding   the  Zachary      Taylor   burial
 grounds, which was promptly purchased and
 deeded to the U.S. Government for the estab-
 lishment of                                                                                                                                                the  Zachary  Taylor     National
 Cemetery, and was so dedicated on May 31,
 1928.  The dedicatory address was delivered
 by the Honorable Maurice Thatcher, Mem-
 ber of Congress from the Third Congressional
 District of Kentucky, who began his address
 with these glowing words:
 "We are here today to dedicate this lovely
 mausoleum which shall hole[ through the in-
 definite future, all that remains of the sacred
 dust of that splendid Kentuckian, that great
 American, that splendid soldier and citizen,
 Zachary Taylor, the 12th President (if the
 United States."; and
 Whereas Gen. Zachary Taylor, affection-
 ately called "Old Rough and Ready" by the
 officers and soldiers who served with h1in out
 of respect: for his courageous and energetic
 leadership, was born on November 24, 1784, in
 Montebello, Orange County, Va., and a year
 later migrated with his family to Jefferson
 County, Ky., and thus truly became an ei.rly
 Kentucky pioneer.   In 1806, Gen. Zachary
 Taylor volunteered for the Army which he
 served for 40 years.   When the war with
 England broke out in 1812, Taylor, a major,
 was sent with 50 men to the'defense of Fort
 Harrison on the Wabash River in Indiana,
 where on September 4, 1812, Indians led by
 Tecumseh  furiously  attacked  and  after  7
 hours of hard fighting they were forced to
 flee in disorder.  As a colonel, Taylor, in 1832
 participated in the Black Hawk campaign,
 .and for the defeat of the Seminoles in the
 Battle of Okeechobe in December 11137, he
 was brevetted brigadier general, and in 1.840,
 General Taylor was promoted to cornmand
 the southern division of  the western  de-
 partment of the Army.
 As commander of the Army of the      Rio
 Grande, General Taylor, on March 6  11346,
 was instructed to march to the Rio Grande,
 which was recognized by the United States
 as the southern boundary of Texas, but re-
 jected by Mexico, and his first encounter
 with the Mexicans occurred on May 8, 1846,
 at Palo Alto, followed the next day by the
 battle of Resaca de la Paloma.  General 'Tay-
 lor defeated the Mexicans in this and the
 war with Mexico was begun.
 On  September 21,  1846,  General  I'avlor
 marched on Monterey, the chief :stronghold
 in northern Mexico.  General Ampudia, the
 Mexican commander, proposed surrender and
 terms were agreed on, then late in the au-
 tumn of 1846, General Santa Anna with a
 large army marched against General Taylor,
 who had taken a position near Buena Vista,
 on February 22, 1847.
 General Santa Anna made a demand upon
 General  Taylor  for  surrender,  which  was
 promptly refused  and battle      ensued, and
 just before the battle, General Taylor ad-
 dressed his troops,                                                                                                                                               "Soldiers,  I  intend to
 stand here not only so long as a man re-
 mains, but so long as a piece of a loran is
 left"  By nightfall the Mexicans were flee-
 ing in confusion.                                                                                                                                             With a force one-fourth
 the size of the enemy, General Taylor Sad
 won his greatest victory and won the M,~xi-
 can War.
 In 1848 General Taylor was elected Presi-
 dent of the United States and was inaugu-
 rated on March 5, 1849.  On July 4, 1350,
 President  Taylor, while  attending  a  cere-
 mony connected with the building of the
 George Washington Monument, became ill
 and died July 9, 1850, and shortly thereafter
 he was brought to Kentucky and interred in
 the Taylor family burial    ground, now the
 Zachary Taylor National Cemetery, neglected
 and almost forgotten by the Nation  until

 February 28, 1966       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 bigger States should have more authority if
 it comes to be decided in the House of Repre-
 sentatives, so that we also are fair and equi-
 table to the big States by giving them more
 authority than they have now.  We do not
 attempt to simply take power from one or
 the other but rather to equalize the power
 of both and to recognize that more accident
 of geographical residence should give one
 American citizen more than 14 times as much
 significance, stature, and authority in the
 voting booth as another American citizen,
 v,nd this is what occurs today.
 We believe that the large States should
 have their proportionate power-no one is
 advocating taking away the 43 votes of New
 York-but we do believe that this power
 should be registered in the electoral college
 on the basis in which the people voted it.
 To do otherwise or, in other words, to con-
 tinue the present system of general ticket
 voting,  with  its  cumulative  effect  which
 produces 2d-, 3d-, and even 15th-class voting
 citizens, would be to give some individuals a
 greater voting power than they deserve.
 The fact that this type of a result is clearly
 wrong, no matter how or where it is achieved,
 was pointed out by Chief Justice Warren in
 Reynolds v. Sims when he said:
 "It would appear extraordinary to suggest
 that a State could be constitutionally per-
 mitted to enact a law providing that certain
 of the State's voters could vote 2, 5, or 10
 times for their legislative  representatives,
 while voters living elsewhere could vote only
 once.  And it is inconceivable that a State
 law to the effect that, in counting votes for
 legislators, the votes of citizens in one part of
 the State would be multiplied by 2, 5, or 10,
 while the votes of persons in another area
 would be counted only at face value, could
 be constitutionally sustainable.  Of course,
 the  effect  of  State  legislative districting
 schemes which give the same number of rep-
 resentatives to unequal numbers of constit-
 uents is identical.  Overweighting and over-
 valuation of the votes of those living here
 has the certain effect of dilution and under-
 valuation of the votes of those living there.
 The resulting discrimination against those
 individual voters living in disfavored areas
 is   easily   demonstrable   mathematically.
 Their right to vote is simply not the same
 right to vote as that of those living in a
 favored part of the State.   Two, five, or ten
 of them must vote before the effect of their
 voting is equivalent to that of their favored
 neighbor.  Weighting the votes of citizens
 differently, by any method or means, merely
 because of where they happen to reside,
 hardly seems justifiable.  One must be ever
 aware that the Constitution forbids "sophis-
 ticated as well as simpleminded modes of
 discrimination."
 We are all familiar with the fact that
 Reynolds v. Sims deals with legislative ap-
 portionment on the State level and was an
 attempt to give a more equal share of the
 voting strength to the urban areas but this
 does not detract from the basic premise that
 such weighting is wrong.  It can be the other
 way around.  The Chief Justice mentioned
 this in a footnote to his opinion when he
 pointed out that in the early 19th century
 the cities held the disproportionate repre-
 sentation and in the future the situation
 might be reversed again.  The situation is
 reversed now as far as presidential elections
 are concerned and it should be rectified.  As
 Warren said: "To the extent that a citizen's
 right to vote is debased, he is that much
 less a citizen.  The fact that an individual
 lives here or there is not a legitimate reason
 for overweighting or diluting the efficacy of
 his vote.  The complexions of societies and
 civilizations  change,  often  with  amazing
 rapidity.  A nation once primarily rural in
 character  becomes  predominantly    urban.
 Representation schemes once. fair and equit-
 able become archaic and outdated.                         But the
 baSIC principle of representative government
 remains, and must remain, unchanged-the
 weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to
 depend on where he lives."
 Before closing I would like to mention one
 additional and important point.  Much has
 been said and written about minority Presi-
 dents:  The major factor in such an occur-
 rence is undoubtedly the general ticket-
 unit rules system.  By breaking this up we
 would go a long way in eliminating such a
 possibility.  It will not eliminate it entirely
 because as was pointed out in the memo-
 randum prepared by the staff of the Sub-
 committee                                                                                      on Copstitutional Amendments
 following the hearings in 1961  two other
 factors contribute to such a possibility: (1)
 The minimum of three electoral votes for
 each State, and (2), the allocation of addi-
 tional electors on the basis of population.
 With one exception, no plan proposed in
 the past would eliminate completely the pos-
 sibility of a minority President.  That one
 exception  is a direct national election.  I
 have mentioned this not because I consider
 this a basic flaw in any other plan including
 Senate Joint Resolution 12 but because I
 think it should be made very clear why this
 possibility, so small it is almost infinitesimal
 once the general ticket system is broken up,
 must continue to exist.
 As long as this Nation follows the prin-
 ciple of equality of States-the basis of fed-
 eralism-it must exist.  Under this system
 each State is allocated two electors corre-
 sponding to its Senators and a minimum al-
 lowance of at least one more regardless of the
 population of the State. To quote from the
 memorandum "Obviously, any system which
 preserves the Federal principle and its three-
 vote minimum allows for the possibility that
 a majority of the electoral vote may do to a
 condidate who receives fewer popular votes.
 Indeed, this was the original purpose of the
 electoral vote bonus for smaller States, so
 that the greater populations of the larger
 States could not dictate the selection of the
 President.  It was part of the compromise
 which made the Constitution possible."
 Mr. Chairman, the emphasis here is mine-
 although the quote is from this subcommit-
 tee's memorandum.  I have included this be-
 cause, as I have said, I feel that this is im-
 portant.  We should attempt to reduce the
 possibility of a minority President by doing
 away with that which contributes the most
 to such a possibility and is neither needed
 nor desired to preserve our Federal system
 but we should not become so obsessed with
 the idea of elimination that we destroy the
 principle of statehood imbedded in our Con-
 situation.  To do so we would, as the old say-
 ing goes, throw the baby out with the bath-
 water.
 In summary Mr. Chairman, I would say
 this.  Our system of electing a President has,
 generally speaking, served us well during the
 177 years since our Republic was established.
 It has never failed to give us a President.
 Through no fault of the Founding Fath-
 ers,                                                                        it  has,  however,  become  distorted
 through the use of the general ticket system.
 Most of the framers of the Constitution, it
 should be pointed out, went on record favor-
 ing a district system for choosing electors, as
 the fairest method of expressing the popular
 will.
 Senate Joint Resolution 12, is, in my opin-
 ion and the opinion of the many who sup-
 port it, the only simple method by which
 each voter in every State will have the same
 voting weight in electing a President.  It is
 the only one among the various electoral
 reform proposals which have been offered
 which will bring about a needed reform with-
 out a basic  change in our constitutional
 system.  It alone leaves control of the elec-
 tion  machinery   in  the  States,  where  it
 belongs.
 It will bring about the balance so desper-
 4085
 ately needed in today's inequitable system.
 It was this imbalance that former President
 Truman addressed himself to in 1961 when he
 endorsed the district plan.  At that time he
 said:
 "The electoral college was first devised to
 protect the small States from dominance by
 the larger States, as for example, Delaware
 and Rhode Island from being dominated by
 Virginia and New York.
 "The problem we face today is that of the
 emergence of the big cities into political over-
 balance, with the threat of imposing their
 choices on the rest of the country."
 In the ensuing years since President Tru-
 man made that statement much has hap-
 pened to increase the imbalance.
 If you accept the thesis, which I do not,
 that two wrongs make a right, in 1961, the
 argument could be made that although large
 urban areas possessed a disproportionate in-
 fluence in the selection of the President this
 was offset by a certain disproportionate rep-
 resentation in Congress on the part of rural
 areas.  In effect then there was a counter-
 balance of interests.  As has been previously
 pointed out this is no longer true.  We have
 reformed and equalized the election process
 for the legislative branch.  Now we must do
 likewise for the executive.
 Simply put, in the past a wrong existed and
 logic demanded that it be rectified.  Today
 that same wrong exists and both logic and
 justice demand that it be rectified.

 WEIGHING THE WAR
 The questioning of our posture in south-
 east Asia boils down to the contention that
 we should modify our military efforts there
 in the light of our global commitments.  Un-
 der this theory, all risks of the enlargements
 of the war in Vietnam should be abandoned.
 The  considerations  in  Congress  of  the
 American position will either shape the war
 into this modified, or holding, form, or will
 produce a reaffirmation of the broader offen-
 sive action now in force.

 positions, the fact that Congress is now at-

 holds the chance of error or offers the oppor-
 tanity for wisdom.
 In holding current procedures suspect, Lt.
 fen. James M. Gavin, retired, and ex-diplo-
 anat George F. Keenan have come close to the
 charge that fichting it our militarily is non-
 ;e.nse.  They say the conflict tend:; to weaken,
 militarily, our world position and risks war
 with Iced China.
 Ancther retired officer, Gen, Maxwell Tay-
 lor, supportin:i current policy, says: "I won-
 der if those concerned about war with China
 would say we should simply let the Commu-
 nists take over in South Vietnam."
 That effectively reiterates the position that
 the stand in Asia is, fundamentally and long
 range, one for the containment of commu-
 nlsnt.
 '11h.e raising of the issue In Congress has
 momentously  exposed  varying  views  and
 healthily brought the problem before the
 American people. The differences cannot be
 brushed aside and the issue must now be
 threshed out.
 Widespread desire, in and out of the Gov-
 ernment, to end the war is understandable.
 But opinions coming out of the congressional
 investigation which say, in effect, the whole
 eland we are taking is a mistake could be
 hazardously  misleading  unless  judiciously
 esami tied by Lite people.
 The criticism takes us to the brink of with-
 drawal or at least defensive stagnation in
 southeast Asia,  but nevertheless contains
 points having the ring of what may be a
 seductive logic.
 More than the freedom of the South Viet-
 namese is involved.  World peace may be at
 Stake.  But  she United  States  can  afford
 nothing less than firm adherence to principle
 and the searc.il for the best answer.
 CONTINUATION OF THE PUBLIC LAW
 874 AID       TO IMPACTED SCHOOL
 DISTRICTS PROGRAM
 Mr. PELL.  Mr. President, the 1967
 fiscal year budget proposals contain a
 recommended cutback in the Public
 Law 874, aid to impacted school districts
 program.  This cutback is calculated to
 save the U.S. Treasury some $233 million.
 Many of my Rhode Island constitu-
 ents-parents, teachers, school superin-
 tendents-have written to me urging that
 this program to continued at its present
 level. I  am  certain  my  colleagues
 are also very well aware of the severe
 financial impact the proposed reduction
 Of this fine program will have on the par-
 licipating communities.                          In Rhode Is-
 land alone, the present entitlement of
 :3,015,729 would be cut down to $1,-
 146,501.
 The purpose of the impacted aid pro-
 ;,rani is to provide financial  support
 or educational services in those school
 districts which must accommodate the
 children of Federal employees who live on
 and work on Federal property, and chil-
 dren residing with a parent who is eni-
 ployed on Federal property.
 Now it is obvious that one of two re-
 ::ults must flow from any reduction in the
 Public Law 874 program-school districts
 which receive this support must either
 eliminate some of the educational serv-
 ices they provide our schoolchildren or
 i;he school district must find other means
 i,o raise funds to continue its educational
 t ifors.  I strongly oppose reducing edu-
 cation services, and believe it is wholly
 inconsistent with the recent efforts of
 Congress to expand educational opportu-'
 nities.   I also consider it grossly unfair
 to impose on local communities an in-
 creased tax burden to support needed
 educational efforts, which are imposed as
 a result of Federal requirements.  We
 must remember, and this is my overrid-
 ing consideration, that it is children who
 will suffer the effects of any cutback-
 and I do n6t believe this would b- in our
 national interest;.
 There is little question of our continu-
 ing need to maintain our Federal bases
 and establishments.  In Rhode Island,
 our U.S. naval bases are of gra:at :im-
 portance to the maintenance of our mili-
 tary strength.  Let us not fore cc that
 with the conflict in Vietnam, this need
 is even more apparent, and the number
 of personnel-and schoolchildren-will
 increase.
 We cannot, Mr. President, dike the
 short  range  view.   The  communities
 which must assimilate substantial num-
 bers of Federal employees, need assist-
 ance in providing services to them.  One
 of the most important services, is the
 education of their children,  I see no
 useful purpose that is served by cutting
 back the aid to impacted school districts.
 The financial saving is more than offset

 NDERSTANDING   THE   BACK-
 GROUND OF THE VIETNA1V CON-
 FLICT
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. President, a series
 of articles in. the New. -Journal papers
 of Wilmington. Del., has contributed a
 great deal to an understanding; of the
 background of the Vietnam conflict.
 They are written by William P. Frank,
 Deleware's best known newspaperman,
 and are illustrated by photographs taken
 by Bill Snead, a prize-winning photo-
 journalist who is chief of the Ne% s-Jour-
 nal photo department.
 These two men spent 3 weeks in South
 Vietnam recently, talking to mc:n from
 Delaware in particular but generally get-
 ting an overall impression of conditions
 in the country and the role Americans
 are playing.

 February 28, 1966       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 who really doesn't know why he's there but
 who is not complaining or bitter.
 In the main his aim is to do a good job as
 soon as possible and go home.
 GI Joe knows that, wherever he is in South
 Vietnam-Saigon, in some hamlet, or even
 in the security of a large military installa-
 tion-there is danger.
 He truly believes the Vietcong is a cruel,
 ruthless enemy.   His willingness  to trust
 Vietnamese is complicated by the fact he
 doesn't understand the Vietnamese mind.
 The American flghtng man accepts long
 hours of work and duty without griping.  He
 is not disturbed too much by the antics of
 the  demonstrating  "Vietniks"  back  home.
 He does worry a great deal about the safety
 and welfare of his family and wishes they
 wouldn't worry about him.
 Several soldiers told of narrow escapes they
 had experienced or of having been shot at by
 Vietcong and then added, "But don't men-
 tion that in your stories.  The folks back
 home might get worried."
 In general, the American soldier is careful
 about his life in Vietnam.
 He takes his malaria pills with strict regu-
 larity once a week.  He avoids drinkng water,
 except when he is positive it's safe.
 He prefers American-type cooking to the
 strange dishes of the country.
 While  he, admires  and raves about the
 charm and beauty of the Vietnamese girls, he
 wouldn't want to take them home to meet
 mom or dad.
 He has learned to bargain with street ven-
 dors and quite often beats them at their own
 game.
 He keeps abreast of the news principally
 through the excellent Pacific edition of the
 Stars and Stripes, the Armed Forces Radio,
 and several American news magazines.
 He has learned how to be extremely patient
 in air terminals when he has to spend hours
 waiting for a plane.
 Many of the GI's have caught on to the
 spirit and philosophy of the civic action pro-
 gram of the United States and are willing to
 devote their off-duty hours to teaching Viet-
 namese children English or working in an
 orphanage or rescuing Vietnamese civilians
 in a battle zone.
 But ask the average GI "Why are  you
 here?" and he'll say, as if he had learned it by
 rote: "We're fighting to stop communism."
 If the soldier has had no more than a high
 school education, he will not elaborate on
 that.  If he is a college man, he will discuss
 the possibilities of communism's spreading to
 other parts of the Pacific and getting closer
 to his native country.
 He hasn't too much to say about the Viet-
 namese soldier, first, because the average GI
 can't  communicate with the natives and,
 next, because he doesn't come in contact
 with too many.
 The average GI knows practically nothing
 about the history or ancient culture of Viet-
 nam, except that he does know the French
 were there until recent years.
 He has little or no respect for the Viet-
 namese police in Saigon and he knows that
 these  police  will  not  interfere with him.
 However, the soldier has a healthy respect
 for the U.S. military police who are always
 combing the bar districts in towns.
 Of the several hundred American soldiers
 I've talked with in bars, restaurants, military
 installations,  on  planes  and  in bleak air
 terminals, none wanted to appear as a super-
 patriot.
 The men, drafted or volunteers, don't want
 to wave the American flag and make fancy
 speeches about making South Vietnam safe
 for democracy.
 The morale of the fighting man seems to
 increase the farther he gets from Saigon, the
 seedy,, unkempt capital of South Vietnam.
 In faraway Da Nang or Chu Lai, men have
 told me that they have no hankering to get
 to Saigon.
 The behavior of the American soldier in
 Saigon is not as had as one would expect un-
 der the circumstances.  Americans fill bars
 to capacity and are willing to spend lots of
 money buying "Saigon tea" for bar girls at
 the rate of about $1.25 or $1.30 a shot.  But I
 saw very few American soldiers drunk on the
 streets.
 Not all of these bar girls can be called
 prostitutes and when the curfew hour ap-
 proaches, soldiers. and girls come pouring
 out of the bars.  Many girls are either picked
 up by their husbands or friends; the soldiers
 bunch up to hire taxis or pedicabs and make
 off for their billets.
 Of course, a lot of them go off to parties
 but when the curfew time arrives, the streets
 of Saigon become as dead as Market Street
 in Wilmington at 4 in the morning.
 The GI's have the greatest contempt for
 taxi drivers and pedicabbies who bedevil any
 American on the streets of Saigon. 'The taxi
 drivers and the pedicabbies will always try to
 overcharge and if the soldier knows his way
 around, he will pay what he thinks a trip
 was worth and just walk away from the
 squawking cabbies.
 It is true, however, that some meaningful
 friendships  have  developed  between  the
 Americans and Vietnamese girls.  In the bet-
 ter restaurants and in the officers' open mess
 In Saigon, it is not unusual to see soldiers
 and their Vietnamese dates, who are lovely in
 their native dress.
 Oddly enough, even though prostitution is
 rampant in Saigon, there are very few street-
 walkers.  The streets are loaded with pimps
 approaching Americans to tell them where
 they can obtain "nice young girls."
 When police do raid houses of prostitution,
 the girls are always held for court but "the
 foreigners" are always released.  This is in
 keeping with the practice of the Vietnamese
 police to "interfere" with Americans as little
 as possible.
 Technically, it is illegal for American sol-
 diers to possess U.S. currency or "green"
 money. They get their money either in Viet-
 namese piasters or military currency.
 Military money, which looks like the old
 American shinplasters, is adorned with the
 pictures of bobbed-haired American beauties
 and is used exclusively on military installa-
 tions, at all post exchanges, in the USO, and
 officers' open messes.
 The American soldiers travel around Viet-
 nam chiefly on military planes on the basis
 of first come, first served at military passen-
 ger terminals.
 Newsmen also travel that way and their
 press cards are accepted as "flight orders."
 In Saigon, the Army operates buses to and
 from important points such as the Tan Son
 Nhut Airbase, or the major post exchange
 in Cholon, the Chinese section of Saigon.
 For  American  servicemen  who  do  not
 choose to wait for these buses, there are al-
 ways the taxis and the pedicabs.
 Army trucks and jeeps often will pick up
 servicemen, if there is room.
 It is a common sight In Saigon, as through-
 out Vietnam where American forces are sta-
 tioned, to see soldiers fully armed-rifles,
 submachineguns, revolvers in hip holsters or
 arm holsters.  However, when entering PX's,
 the USO, or air terminals, the men are re-
 quired to remove the clips from their guns.
 The      accommodations  for  the  American
 fighting men range from comfortable billets
 in hotels that have been taken over by the
 United States to pup tents out in the field.
 In the large installations, such as those for
 the marines near Da Nang or An Khe, the
 accommodations will range from tents with
 wooden floors and wooden sides to large tents
 erected right over the bare ground.
 There is the widest variety in how the men
 in the military installations will try to spruce
 up and make the best of their tent cities.
 Some units have taken to planting native
 trees and even cultivated American corn for
 decorative and nostalgic purposes.
 Some have built streets out of scrap lum-
 ber and what  field stone they can  find.
 Others have taken bits of the treads used for
 emergency air strips and used them as bridges
 over deep gutters.
 The marines at a place called Chu Lai, on
 the South China Sea, have revealed a sense
 of humor.  The area there is nothing but
 dark red sand dunes and scrub pines.
 But in front of the small tent air terminal
 at Chu Lai, the sand has been raked clean
 and a sign put there, "Keep off the grass."
 Hundreds of GI's have learned that they
 can buy expensive cameras very cheaply in
 the PX's-cameras that would sell for $350
 back home, going for half that price.
 A lot of them don't know how to use the
 cameras but they've got them.
 At the main PX in Saigon, there's always a
 long waiting line of men trying to get into
 the   camera,   radio   and   tape   recorder
 departments.
 As souvenir buyers, no one can equal the
 American GI.    He likes the Vietnamese doll
 in native attire, all kinds of luggage said to
 be made of elephant, hides, imitation ivory
 chess sets, all kinds of imitation teakwood
 figures,  lacquer  boxes  of many sizes and
 shapes.  Now a few are going in for Viet-
 namese art, including very good oil paintings
 and wash drawings on silk.
 The GI has learned how to evaluate any-
 thing.                                                                                                                                      The best is "No, 1," the worst "No. 10."
 In restaurants, he chiefly goes for Chi-
 nese food but has found the Vietnamese
 chop suey is nothing like it is back home.
 He tries to use chopsticks but gives them
 up when he attempts spaghetti.
 In Saigon, when the GI gets tired of the
 exotic Far East, he finds refuge in the USO.
 There he gets a safe jumbo size milk shake
 for a quarter;  a huge  hamburger for 30
 cents; good vegetable soup, ice cream, and
 free coffee-the best in Vietnam.
 It also is in the USO that he can meet
 friends, read a varity of American newspa-
 pers, watch television, call home through a
 special telephone service of the USO, at the
 cost of $6 for 3 minutes, look at movies, and
 even play bingo.
 The USO is the haven for the GI when he
 is weary of the hustle and bustle of Saigon
 and when he is not loaded with piastres.
 It will take years before Vietnam gets over
 the Impact of the American GI, and a long
 time before the native kids forget some of
 the Anglo-Saxon words they've learned.

 VIETNAMESE  A MYSTERY  TO   RANK-AND-FILE
 GI
 (NOTE.-This is the second of a series in
 which William P. Frank, who returned earlier
 this month from Vietnam, reports his im-
 pressions of that nation and its people.)
 (By William P. Frank)
 GI Joe is ready to die in Vietnam, a coun-
 try he knows little about.
 Joe will go to great lengths to rescue civil-
 ians from combat zones, even at the risk of
 his life.  He will contribute to their welfare
 and even get the folks at home to come across,
 with gifts.
 But he knows practically nothing about
 the 2,000-year history of the country, its
 folklore, customs, music or traditions.
 However, some of the carefully selected
 wearers of the green beret, the elite Special
 Forces, are fully aware of the courage of
 Vietnamese junglefighters.
 Air Force officers, who have trained with
 Vietnamese  pilots,  are  impressed  by  the
 goals and standards of the Asians.
 But  the rank-and-file American      soldier
 doesn't know, for example, that when his
 ancestors were in caves somewhere in Europe.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE        February 28, 1.966
 the  forebears  of present-day  Vietnamese
 were living in a highly developed culture of
 literature, art and even science.
 Nor is (11 Joe aware that the Vietnamese
 have been fighting aggressors for more than
 1,500 years or that the Mongolian cavalry of
 the  great  Kublai  Khan,  whose  empire
 stretched from Vienna to Peiping. was dle-
 leated by Vietnamese guerrilla forces in the
 131.h century.
 American soldiers are in Vietnam to fight
 the Vietcong and the Communists of North
 Vietnam, but the strange thing is that the
 average Of. can't tell a friendly Vietnamese
 from an unfriendly one.  The chances are
 he has never seen a living enemy up close,
 A major problem between the Americans
 and the natives of the country is a lack of
 communication.   The  American soldier  is
 either too busy in his camp or on a mission.
 When he is in town, he is more bent on
 pleasure than information.   Also, not too
 many Vietnamese can speak English beyond
 the jargon of the marketplace or the smoke-
 filled bars.
 if more American servicemen could speak
 French, there would be, perhaps, better corn-
 rnnnication since this is the second language
 for so many Vietnamese, including cabbies
 and hotel boys.  This dates back to the era
 when Vietnam was part of the French co-
 lonial empire.
 t'he American soldier is tremendously irri-
 pressed by the immaculate dress of the Viet-
 namese girls in their  native  costumes  of
 black or white pantaloons, tight bodices with
 high collars and  flowing slit-sided tunics
 called "at dai," pronounced "zow die." It is
 a mystery how these girls can look so lovely,
 clean,  fresh,  and  dignified  even  as they
 emerge from the dark and filthy hovels where
 they live.
 In Saigon, the GI usually encounters the
 sneaky pedicab  driver  or taxi driver who
 pesters him with suggestions of taking him
 to see young girls; crowds of shoeshine kids
 who want cigarettes or money; innumerable
 street  vendors who  start  bargaining  at
 mountain-high prices and eventually come
 down to a reasonable one.
 iince more Americans have arrived, the
 Vietnamese have become adept at the free
 enterprise,  profitmaking  system-so  much
 so that Communists in the north probably
 will never convince the South Vietnamese
 that collectivism is the best thing in. life.
 Never has there been such prosperity in Sai-
 gon and near the large U.S. military installa-
 tions-yet, abject poverty still prevails.
 While the American soldier still may riot
 have a deep admiration for the Vietnamese,
 he does respect the religion and religious
 structures of the people.  It is amazing to
 see small Buddha shrines and burial places
 undesecrat.ed in the midst of huge military
 camps.
 During the many hours of waiting in U.S.
 air terminals, where American and Vietna-
 mese soldiers have been together in a small
 area, for hours, I saw little or no fraterniza-
 tion between the two.  Again the chief stum-
 bling block: lack of communication.
 However, the one major religious folk. cus-
 tom of the  Vietnamese  that  GI Joe  has
 learned about is Tet, the lunar new year ob-
 served late in January amid an enormous
 and fantastic outburst of firecracks that gave
 many an American soldier battle jitters. Tet
 is a 3-day uncontrolled display of firecrackers
 in Saigon.  For example, it left the pave-
 ments strewn with layers of red remnants
 of firecrackers, reminiscent of confetti after
 a big wedding.
 't'he Vietnamese do have a long and notable
 history-dating back 20 centuries.  The tiny
 nation's history is punctuated with innumer-
 able wars for freedom and national identity
 ay,ainst Chinese, French, and Japanese.
 Despite invasions and the domination by
 intruders, the Vietnamese have managed to
 maintain their own identity.  For example,
 they have not used Chinese writing for cen-
 turies but have adopted the Roman letter
 system, or "quoc ngu," given them by French
 and Portugese missionaries.
 The women of all classes still cling to their
 native dress.  This ranges from the wealthy
 women in public life to the humblest street
 vendor.
 The men of the upper classes, however,
 have  adopted western dress, but  peasants
 still wear what Westerners would call pa-
 jamas.
 Vietnamese food, by and large, is tradi-
 tional--plenty of fish and a wid.? variety of
 it; also chicken, duck and pork; lots of rice
 and in more than  recent years, blanched
 spaghetti, which they manipulal.e skillfully
 with chopsticks.  Occasionally, the diet in-
 cludes dried bat, regarded as a delicacy.
 Markets are filled with vegetables, includ-
 ing enormous cucumbers, Chinese  lettuce,
 plenty of watercress and mound:, of sugar-
 cane.  This is sold as if. is, or chopped into
 segments or squeezed into juice.
 Butcher  shops  are  adorned  with  red-
 glazed  roasted  duck,                                                                                   beef, yellow-glazed
 roasted chickens   and  strings O, strangely
 shaped sausage.
 'l'ea is the chief beverage.  It's a good thing
 they don't drink too much water, for most
 homes do not have safe water or, for that
 matter, any kind of interior plumbing sys-
 tem.  People must obtain water at common
 lancets in the street.
 There is little drunkenness apparent any-
 where in Vietnam.  Safi, drinks, particularly
 orange soda, have become extremely popular.
 Because the Vietnamese are a strong family
 people, it is common to see entire families
 squatting on pavements  and/or  in  alleys
 around a common table.  Food is eaten from
 common dishes with the ubiquitous and in-
 credibry nimble chopsticks.
 Restaurants are for the wealthy or the
 more  prosperous Vietnamese.   Streets are
 crowded with women and youngsters who
 prepare and sell food in huge pots on small
 charcoal burners.
 Many Americans believe the ordinary peo-
 ple of Vietnam are unclean, so it. is amazing
 to witness the great lengths to which they
 will go to wash themselves.  In Saigon, the
 levee of the murky,  garbage-filled   Saigon
 River is usually jammed morning and after-
 noon with workers washing themselves.                                                                                   Or,
 it is not unusual to see pedicab drivers, even
 beggars,  crowding  around   street  faucets
 splashing themselves with water.
 Everywhere in Saigon, one sems mothers
 combing and brushing the long hair of their
 daughters,  and  pecking;  around  searching
 for lice.
 The Vietnamese are a small, wiry people.
 The average man isn't more than 5 feet, 4
 inches and weighs about 105 p,nmds.       He
 appears much younger than he really is.
 The women also are diminutive.   A 20-
 year-old woman looks like a girl of 15.                                                                                      It
 is rare to see a corpulent Vietnamese.
 American helicopter pilots have a rule:
 Their aircraft will accommodate five Amer-
 icans, but eight or nine Vietnamese.
 Vietnam  is  really  a  variety  of peoples.
 Those in the lowlands are commonly called
 Vietnamese.  In the highlands are the Mon-
 tagnards, an independent group, distinct in
 habits and customs.     There are also other
 minorities such as the :Khmers who are ac-
 tually Cambodians and the smallest minority
 known as Chains.
 Most of the  Vietnamese  are  Buddhists.
 Other religions are Confucianism, Taoism,
 Caodaism, and Christianity.
 The Christians are mostly Catholic.  The
 Catholic faith was strengthened with the
 coming of French colonialism in  the late
 19th century.  The Catholic cathedral in the
 heart of Saigon is interesting  because its
 architecture is Western and its stained glass
 windows have Western figures, with very little
 evidence ofFar Eastern culture,
 Can Dai is a recent religion, made up of
 Christianity,  Buddhism, and  several  other
 faiths.  Its followers have their own pope and
 a strange  assortment  of  saints, including
 Victor Hugo.   This is a militant religious
 group, almost approaching the status of if
 political party.
 The extent of education among the people
 is not known although many youngsters in
 Saigon say they go to school in the morning
 and work in the afternoon.   Many schools
 are  operated  by  Catholic  nuns.   Wealth y
 Vietnamese send their children abroad  fur
 schooling.
 However.. even the poorest street vendor
 or wizened and toothless cabbie 'is a finan-
 cial wizard when calculating and establish-
 ing a ratio of U.S. money and Vietnamese
 piastres.
 Saigon has far more book stores than cote
 anticipates-chiefly selling paperback books
 in Vietnamese, French, and English.  These
 do not cater exclusively to visitor,; or service-
 men, but also to the people, with the books
 spread out on sidewalks.
 When one gets to know the Vietnamese, lie
 learns that, in the main, they are honet.t.
 Once an agreement has been reached about
 the price of something, they stick to it.
 In  South Vietnam  at least,  the  people
 usually are gentle and speak  in a high-
 pitched  tonal  language,  using  the                                                                                                                                          same
 words for different meanings according to
 the tone of the voice.
 Their folk songs are as sad as most of
 the people are-usually songs of unrequited
 love and longing for peaceful days in gardens
 with beautiful flowers.
 Their festivals are marked with striking
 floral displays and potted trees.  In Saigon,
 nothing is more gorgeous, more vivid in color
 than the flower market, which is patronized
 chiefly by the people.
 The people's arts and crafts are anything
 but primitive.  Several art exhibits in Sai-
 gon revealed a wonderful sensitivity, more
 often in the Western style and abstraction-
 ism than oriental.
 Artists are fond of brush painting on silk,
 using native themes of farmers and boys rid-
 ing water buffaloes.
 In the crafts, nothing surpasses their lac-
 quer boxes and lacquer panels, designed with
 exquisite delicacy.
 The people patronize movies so often that
 most of the theaters have a reserved-seat
 system for French, Chinese, and American
 films.  In Saigon, one can also go to the tra-
 ditional theater, which is reminiscent of the
 Chinese stage, yet slightly different.
 A casual Western observer may think that
 the Vietnamese are lazy because of the her:t,
 the humidity, and the long afternoon siestas.
 He also will see many Vietnamese taking life
 easy as they squat on their haunches en
 curbs or against building walls.
 But nothing is as hectic as the heavy Sai-
 gonese traffic with thousands of taxis, pedi-
 cabs, and the millions of bicycles--so madly
 vehicles belching forth clouds o:1' blue ex-
 haust fumes.  A pedestrian can't help won-
 dering whether he faces asphyxiation during
 an afternoon stroll.

 ILLNESS KILLS MORE SOUTH VIETS
 THAN BATTLES

 which William P. Frank, who returned earlier

 pressions of that nation arid its people
 (By William P. Frank)
 Disease kills more people in South Vietnam
 than the enemy, the ruthless Vietcong.
 The principal aim of the Vietcong is to
 destroy  leaders   of  provinces  or  hamlets,
 schoolteachers, priests, community spokes-
 men-those who can influence the people
 against communism.

 But disease in that sad country of south-
 east Asia is more "democratic."  It lashes out
 at everyone.
 According to the latest reliable figures, cited
 in a recent issue of the American Medical
 Association Journal, a little more than 46
 percent of the deaths in South Vietnam occur
 among children up to 15 years .of age.
 In the United States, comparable statis-
 tics show the death rate for that age group
 is 9 percent.
 The journal also reported that of all the
 children born in 1958-the last year of any
 reliable statistics-half were destined to die
 before their fifth birthday.
 The maternal death rate in Vietnam is
 reported to be 25 times higher than that
 in the United States.  Eight percent of babies
 born  in Vietnamese hospitals  never leave
 them alive.
 According to Dr. John M. Levinson, of Wil-
 mington, now in Vietnam for.his third tour of
 volunteer service among the people, there's
 no reason to believe that the situation has
 improved since 1958.
 "In fact," Levinson said, "the disease prob-
 lem has increased.  Except for what a few
 American doctors have been  able to con-
 tribute on a volunteer basis, the medical
 problem has increased."
 It is also reasonable to conclude that if
 the war is escalated, more civilians will be
 hurt.
 American casualties are cared for in U.S.
 militray hospitals; Vietnamese military per-
 sonnel have facilities, but the hapless civilian
 victims-the adults and chldren-must de-
 pend upon meager first-aid clinics and civil-
 ian hospitals already overcrowded, under-
 staffed, and woefully short of supplies.
 American doctors, not connected with the
 U.S. military effort but who are volunteering
 their skills among the people, have repeated-
 ly told me that American guns may win the
 war, but it'll be up to American medical
 science to win the peace.
 "That may sound like a tired cliche but
 it's  the  gospel  truth,"  said  Dr.  George
 McInnes    of  Augusta,  Ga.,  who  heads  an
 American medical team in a Da Nang civilian
 hospital.  But medical help "is what the peo-
 ple see and understand-American compas-
 sion and concern for them.                       This is what is
 going to give them strength and confidence
 in America."
 In a mountain village near Dalat is a small
 hospital  operated  by  Dr.    James  Turpin.
 This hospital is called Project Concern, and
 is supported by contributions, many of which
 come from Jaycee units in various parts of
 the United States.
 Levinson has been working chiefly in a large
 maternity hospital in Saigon.  One day re-
 cently 12 babies were delivered by midwives in
 one section of the hospital with a lone native
 doctor.in attendance.
 It is rare to see more than one or two Viet-
 namese doctors on duty In a civilian hospital.
 Most of them have been taken into the Viet-
 namese Army.  It is estimated that there
 are not more than 200 Vietnamese civilian
 doctors for a nation with a population of
 15 million.  To make matters worse, most
 Vietnamese are extremely poor and they live
 in remote, rural areas.
 At  present, according to rough guesses,
 there are about 50 American doctors in South
 Vietnam.   They are working in clinics and
 hospitals, treating every kind of imaginable
 case from war wounds to tuberculosis and
 cancer.
 One of the major sources of disease in Viet-
 nam is improper facilities for disposal and
 treatment  of  sewage  and  waste.  Saigon,
 once hailed as the "Pearl of the Orient," has
 mounds of garbage on pavements and streets.
 It is uncollected for days at a time, making
 ideal breeding and nesting places for rats.
 Supervision or control of food markets is
 virtually nonexistent; most restaurants are
 filthy.  Untreated sewage is dumped into riv-
 ers; people live along these bodies of water
 and bathe in them.
 Water  is  drawn from  common  taps  in
 streets, and only the fact that the water is
 boiled for tea or soups, spares the people even
 greater disease.
 Among the common maladies in the coun-
 try are malaria, tuberculosis, various intesti-
 nal diseases, meningitis, typhoid, polio, and
 some leprosy.
 According to one report, trachoma-a dis-
 ease of the eyelids-is so common that at
 least fogr-fifths of the population has been
 infected with it at one time or another.
 Levinson recently reported in an article
 in the American Medical Association Journal
 that it is not uncommon to see a leper sitting
 on the streets of Saigon begging for money
 or food.
 Parasites of all kinds abound,  According
 to Levinson, the peasant must face rein-
 fection with parasitic diseases, since he must
 work barefooted in the flooded rice paddies
 where he is exposed again and again.
 Residents of rural areas believe innumera-
 ble medical superstitions.  These result from
 folklore from China.  Only recently are these
 people beginning to accept Western medi-
 cines.
 Peoples in villages that have been raked
 by the war, are known to carry their wounded
 on crude stretchers for miles to see the "bac
 si my," the American doctor.
 Hospitals are so overcrowded, however, that
 it is meaningless to measure a hospital's
 capacity in  bed  space.   Patients,  small
 though the people are, live two and three in
 a bed.  Sometimes, two cots are put together
 to accommodate four, maybe five patients.
 Hospital  attendants  and    hard-working
 nuns of nearby churches are unable to meet
 the demands of patients; so it is not unusual
 to see relatives of the sick on the wards,
 feeding, washing and given other attention
 to their ailing kin.
 . It is true that in many instances, Amer-
 ican military doctors offer thier services and
 so do other military personnel, but all of
 this is on a when-and-if-time-is-available
 basis.
 The arrival of an American doctor in a
 civilian hospital is quite an event.   Word
 spreads swiftly through the wards.
 Levinson,  for  example,  had  no specific
 hour for arriving on his first day at the
 large maternity hospital.   When he showed
 up at 8, he learned a patient had been readied
 and Levinson was to operate.     The woman
 had been kept under anesthesia for at least
 40 minutes, waiting for the "bac si my."
 . The United States through what 1s now
 known as U.S. Agency for International De-
 velopment does provide some facilities and
 equipment for civilian hospitals but It Is
 the American doctor himself, big as life, al-
 ways smiling, stumbling through basic Viet-
 namese with a sprinkling of French who rep-
 resents to the people the heart of the Amer-
 icans.
 "Giving of one's self is the, key to success
 here," a doctor in Da Nang told me.
 "Assistance from the free world and from
 civilian volunteer agencies offers a challenge
 to American medicine to help defeat com-
 munism in southeast Asia," Levinson adds.
 Mere equipment, stamped with the U.S.
 AID emblem, won't do the job alone.

 OPEN POLLS HAZY IDEA TO SOUTH VIETs
 (NOTE.-This is the fourth in a series in
 which William P. Frank, who returned earlier
 this month from South Vietnam, reports his
 impressions of the nation and its people.)
 (By William P. Frank)
 Nguyen, a floor boy at the Hotel Catinat in
 Saigon, tried to explain his idea of freedom.
 In broken English sprinkled with a few
 French words, it amounted to this:
 "Freedom means I can work where I want
 to work.  I can change my job to make more
 money.    I can live in peace-no bullets-no
 Vietcong."
 . But he couldn't describe the kind of gov-
 ernment now operating in South Vietnam,
 nor did he seem to have any concept of the
 American form of representative government.
 Although he can read and write Vietna-
 mese, the theory that Nguyen could someday
 elect his own representatives in'the nation's
 government was incomprehensible.  It must
 be equally difficult to understand for the illit-
 erate peasants who comprise the bulk of the
 15 million people in that nation today.
 What will the Nguyens, the millions of
 peasants and others in Vietnam do or say
 when a new constitution is offered to them
 this year?  What will their reactions be when
 popular elections are held next year?  It is
 impossible to predict.
 The U.S. Army's "Area Handbook for Viet-
 nam," prepared 4 years ago, makes this ob-
 servation :
 "The vast majority of the people (of South
 Vietnam) have little notion and less experi-
 ence of representative government and demo-
 cratic processes.
 "An educated, Western-influenced urban
 minority, intellectually familiar with con-
 stitutional concepts and influenced by demo-
 cratic ideals, is eager for a larger voice in na-
 tional affairs and impatient with government
 restrictions and controls."
 This was written in the days of Ngo Dinh
 Diem, the first President of South Vietnam,
 who was assassinated during a coup staged
 by the military in November 1963.
 A few months earlier, a 123-member Na-
 tional Assembly was approved in a popular
 election.  Candidates supported by Diem got
 92 percent of the vote.  This would make any
 American arch a quizzical brow.
 It is important for Americans to under-
 stand that his concept of popular democratic
 government is something the average Viet-
 namese reads about in his newspaper or hears
 discussed on radio, but does not grasp.
 Presidents, chiefs of state or Prime Min-
 isters in South Vietnam represent a distant
 authority in Saigon to the majority of the
 people in the villages.  What the majority of
 people in the country knows about govern-
 ment revolves around the province chiefs or
 hamlet leaders.
 This is the way the people have been ruled
 for centuries-first under the mandarins of
 the royal government, then under French
 colonialism, then the Japanese, and down to
 the present day.
 As recently as January 6, the Mansfield
 committees of the U.S. Senate-which in-
 cluded U.S. Senator J. CALEB Boccs, Repub-
 lican, of Delaware-on its return from Viet-
 nam wrote:
 "The  new  leadership  in  (Vietnamese)
 Government which is drawn largely from
 military circles, is young and hopeful but
 with little knowledge of politics."
 The United States has been in and around
 the South Vietnamese Government, ofoially
 and  unofficially,  since  1945.   Sometimes
 Americans openly took part in promoting
 certain men for top office in Vietnam, not-
 ably in the case of Diem, who turned out as
 a failure.  Lyndon B. Johnson, when he was
 Vice President, had acclaimed him as the
 "Winston Churchill of Vietnam."
 American advisers are still active in many
 segments    of the  Vietnamese  Government.
 For example, a former prison official of Mon-
 tana has been chief adviser for the National
 Police of Vietnam for several years.
 A number of high-ranking U.S. Army of?-
 ficers have been assigned for years to Viet-
 nam  to  help  train  its  army,  including
 Gen. John  (Iron Mike)  O'Daniel, formerly
 of Newark, Del., now a resident of San Diego,
 Calif.
 However, American advisers generally in-
 sist that they are just that, advisers, and
 try to keep out of the internal affairs.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ---SENATE       February 28, 1966
 Col.  Edward  G. Lansdale,  an  expert in
 Philippine  affairs, was,  however,  prom-
 inently involved in the administration of
 Diem.
 The great problem in Vietnamese Govern-
 ment today is conceded to be the outlook of
 the villagers--whether they feel the South
 Vietnamese Government and the American
 forces are strong enough to protect them
 from the terrorism of the Vietcong.
 The Mansfield report stated that some ob-
 servers believe that no more than 25 percent
 of the country's villages under South Viet-
 nam control will be free enough from Com-
 munist intimidation to take part openly in
 the election this year.
 The  Army's handbook on  Vietnam  also
 pointed out:
 "It seems clear that the villager wants
 peace and  security  above  all else. Con-
 fronted with the competing armed authority
 of the Government and of the Vietcong, he
 will accept what he must and respond slowly
 and cautionsly to efforts to win his loyalty."
 In effect, South Vietnam now has a mili-
 tary  government  called  the  Congress  of
 Armed Forces.
 But the country actually is run by what is
 known as the National Leadership Council,
 composed of top-ranking officers Maj. Gen.
 Nguyen Van Thieu has the title of Chief of
 State.  Vice Air Marshall Nguyen Can Ky is
 Prime Minister, and there are seven other
 generals on the council.
 Sometimes Thieu speaks for the Govern-
 ment; sometimes Ky.
 Several months ago, a copy of what pastes
 for the present constitution of the nation
 was posted on the bulletin board of the press
 lounge in the Joint U.S. Public Affairs Of-
 fice.                 It was one of the most-ignored items
 there.
 The  document  has many  fine-sounding
 phrases,  such  as this:  "The rear (home-
 front) must be stable so that a solid founda-
 tion could be progressively laid and a tradi-
 tion of liberty and democracy could be de-
 veloped in an atmosphere of struggle                        an
 revolution.
 On .January 14, Ky addressed the Armed
 Forces Congress and admitted shortcomings
 since he became Prime Minister last June.
 Indicating that some of the provisions of
 the "constitution" that had not yet been im-
 plemented, Ky said:
 "We must also recognize that due to pres-
 ent circumstances, the Government still is
 unable to create a favorable political cli-
 ;i113tC."
 lie then proceeded to talk about democ-
 racy suited for Vietnam and not for any other
 country.
 Ile proposed seminars among the people
 in which they will be able to discuss the
 kind of government they want.  He prom-
 ised that a constitution will be proposed next
 October, a referendum held and the docu-
 rnent promulgated in November.
 He also promised that a civil government
 will replace the military government next
 year.
 There is still no indication of what political
 parties will emerge or how much freedom
 they will have.
 Much will depend on whether the religious
 factions will hold their temper, on whether
 the independent-thinking minority groups,.
 such as the strange Montagnards of the high-
 lands, will agree to come into the new Viet-
 nam great society and, of course, on the
 progress of the war.
 To date, there is no evidence of any strong;
 opposition  party  in  Vietnam  except,  of
 course, the National Liberation Front-the
 Communists.  Evers  in  the  provinces, the
 terms of cl-.kefs don't last long; they are
 either captured or killed by the Vietcong or
 are deposed by the Saigon government.
 There are always subrosa stories of province
 chiefs with sticky fingers.
 Only recently, 110 television sets were dis-
 tributed by the United States, in one prov-
 ince, earmarked for the people.
 The idea was that the people would be able
 to learn more about the outside world and
 get the democratic message via television,
 beamed from airplanes.
 Just before the television program, began,
 an American official decided to check to see
 what happened to the sets.
 He discovered that of 110, about 60 were in
 the homes of province officials or in police
 stations.  Obviously, that's that not the use
 for which the television had been intended.
 It is presumed they are now in public areas
 where the peasants can see television.
 What is the future of Ky?
 At present, the Ky government is trying to
 win the loyalty of the people by sending out
 teams into the villages to teach the people
 about  democracy but the teams  are still
 encountering the entrenched interests of the
 village chiefs.
 The other day, in announcing res.huf ing
 of cabinet officials, Ky said in efre< t, "I do
 not choose to run for public office."
 But then other public figures have said
 the same thing and ended up in the: addle.
 Historians and political scientist:  knowl-
 edgeable in Asian affairs are now advising
 caution in evaluating the political situation
 in South Vietnam.  In the past two and a
 quarter years, there have been three coups,
 four attempted coups and at least. 20 re-
 shuffles in the government.
 FURTHER TRIBUTE TO ALl1ERT
 THOMAS
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr. President,
 as a continuation of the tribute to the
 late Congressman Albert Thomas which
 I made on the floor of the Senate Friday,
 February 25, 1966, I would like to insert
 several matters pertaining to the final
 rites of this great Texan, which have
 been received by me subsequent to last
 Friday.
 Although the tributes and descriptions
 of Albert Thomas will continue to call
 our attention to the outstanding; nature
 of this remarkable individual for a long
 time,"[ think an account of the final rites
 should be printed for history in the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  For this reason,
 I ask unanimous consent that the article
 from the Houston Post of Friday, Feb-
 ruary 18, 1966, entitled "Albert Thomas
 Laid. To Rest With Military Ceremonies,"
 the article from the Houston Chronicle
 of Saturday, February 19, 1966, entitled
 "The Saddest Bugle Call, Day is Done
 for  Thomas,"  the  articles  from the
 Houston Post of Saturday, February 19,
 1966, entitled. "Thomas Bade Farewell"
 and "'High Officials Attend Rites," and
 the tribute which appeared in Maurine
 Parkhurst's column in the Thursday,
 February 24, 1966, Houston Chronicle be
 printed at this point in the REcollD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From, the Houston Chronicle, Feb. 13, 1966]
 ALBERT THOMAS LAID To REST WITH MILITARY
 CERsmoNlaa
 U.S. Representative Albert Thomas, 67, was
 buried  today  in  a  military  cemetery  in
 Houston's North Side.
 An eight-gun salute was fired.  A bugler
 blew taps as the coffin was lowered into the
 grave.
 A score of more of his colleagues from the
 House  of  Representatives  in  Washington,
 D.C., attended the military service.
 ALLEN GIVES EULOGY
 Earlier this afternoon, Dr. Charles L. Allen
 eulogized                              Thomas  at  a  service  in  First
 Methodist Church.
 Dr. Allen quoted President Johnson :
 "Of the qualities that made Albert Thomas
 a remarkable man, devotion to the people he
 served and loyalty to his friends stand higher
 than al]
 The church was filled with financiers, labor
 leaders, millionaires, and other friends.
 "COURTEOUS, COURTLY"
 And many followed the hearse to the Vet-
 erans' Administration cemetery on Airline-
 Steuhner Road.
 Albert Thomas has represented Houston
 in Congress for 30 years.
 Dr. Allen summed up Thomas as "cour-
 teous, courtly, polite-he never forget to be
 a gentleman."
 Thomas died  Tuesday of cancer- in his
 Washington, D.C., home.  His body was flown
 here in a Presidential fleet plane Wednesday
 night.
 A steady flow of mourners came to the
 Settegast-Kopf Funeral Home chapel, 3300
 Kirby, where the body of Thomas lay in state
 until the funeral.
 The chapel's Colonial Room was filled with
 wreaths from many individuals and orga-
 nizations.  Thomas,  known  as a  titan  of
 Washington, was also known clown to the
 lowest In the ranks of labor from whence he
 drew much of his Democratic strength.
 His familiar greeting of "podnah" for all
 set him apart from most political leaders.
 His office door was always open to his con-
 stituents.
 There was nothing of snobbery about him.
 He was shrewd, gregarious and yet quiet.
 Thomas carne to Houston in 1930 from
 Nacogdoches, one of the first Anglo-Saxon
 settlements in Texas.  He had been county
 attorney there after graduating from Rice
 University and the University of Texas Law
 School, and attending Harvard Law School.
 He became an assistant U.S. attorney in
 Houston and traveled the southern district
 of the Federal court for 6 years before run-
 ning for Congress and winning in 1936.  He
 took his seat in January 1937, in the 75th
 Congress. He had filed for a seat in the next
 Congress when he died.
 Gov.  John  Connally,  Attorney General
 Waggoner Carr, Secretary of State Crawford
 Martin, and U.S. Judge Homer Thornberry
 were flown here for the funeral.
 They  were  joined  at the  South Main
 Church by a large congressional delegation,
 led by Texas two Senators, RALPH YARROR-
 ouCH and JOHN TOWER, and U.S. Representa-
 tive  GEORGE MAHON  of Lubbock, chairman
 of the House Appropriations Committee, of
 which  Thomas  was  the  second  ranking
 member.

 STEUBEN COUNTY RESOLUTION
 Resolution urging legislation in regard to
 purchase by municipalities of surplus or
 used equipment, upon the recommendation
 of the highway committee and the insur-
 ance and laws committee
 Whereas  counties  and towns frequently
 have need for certain types of machinery and
 equipment, the use of which will be used for
 a limited time and surplus machinery and
 equipment or used machinery and equip-
 ment would be adequate and the ability of
 a county or town to purchase at reduced
 prices would result in considerable savings
 to taxpayers; and
 Whereas, the State finance law permits the
 office of general services to sell surplus, obso-
 lete or used machinery and equipment and it
 has been the experience that much of such
 machinery and equipment is sold to dealers
 who then offer the same items for sale to
 counties and towns at a large increase in
 price; and
 Whereas the Federal Government from
 time to time disposes of surplus machinery
 and equipment and about the only way a
 municipality is permitted to make purchase
 of particular items is through the local office
 of civil defense; and
 Whereas it is the consensus of opinion
 of this board that such surplus, obsolete or
 unused machinery and equipment should be
 made available to counties, towns, cities, and
 villages at a fair price before being sold to
 dealers: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors
 of the County of Steuben hereby urges the
 legislature to amend, the State finance law,
 the general municipal law and other appli-
 cable statutes to require the several depart-
 ments of the State having surplus, obsolete,
 or used machinery and equipment for sale
 to prepare an inventory of the major items,
 such as trucks, power shovels, bulldozers,
 cranes, and other highway equipment, and
 the price established for each item, and that
 copies of such inventories be furnished to
 each county, town, city, and village and that
 such municipalities be given a limited time
 in which to purchase such items at the price
 indicated on the inventory and that any
 items not sold to municipalities then be
 sold at public sale; and be it further
 Resolved, That Congress be urged to enact
 legislation which will permit municipalities
 to purchase surplus, obsolete, or used ma-
 chinery and equipment, at appraised value
 before the same are sold to the public; and
 be it further
 Resolved, That the clerk of this board of
 supervisors is directed to forward certified
 copies of this resolution to Senator William
 T. Smith, to Assemblyman Charles D. Hen-
 derson, to Congressman  CHARLES  GOODELL,
 to Senator JAcoB JAVITS and to Senator RoD-
 ERT KENNEDY.
 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR McNA-
 MARA, OF MICHIGAN
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Mr President, it is
 with deep regret that'  have heard of
 the pending retirement from the Senate
 of Senator PAT MCNAMARA,.Of Michigan,
 on grounds of ill health.
 I have never known a more honorable,
 candid, or forthright man. Senator Mc-
 NAMARA speaks his mind without guile or
 craft and votes his convictions without
 fear or favor.
 He is like the Rock of Gibraltar-a
 tower of integrity.  He is also a brave
 and uncomplaining man. The Senate is
 the better for his service, and so is the
 country..
 We shall miss him, and so will the
 Nation.

 Mr.  GRUENING.  Mr.  President,  a
 source of pride to all Alaskans is the Uni-
 versity of Alaska located at College,
 Alaska, a few miles west of downtown
 Fairbanks.  The university dates from
 1915, when the U.S. Congress set aside
 land for the support of an agricultural
 college and school of mines. This land-
 .grant college opened for instruction in
 1922 under the presidency of Charles E.
 Bunnell, previously a Federal judge.  It
 was a small school, and remained so in

 the University of Alaska is a small but                         sent to place in the RECORD my testimony
 rapidly growing institution.  Apart from
 the main campus, it operates six commu-
 nity colleges in cities throughout the
 State, and in four of those communities,
 it offers the only education programs
 above the high school level.  In terms
 of activities in research and advanced
 study, it is burgeoning-its institute of
 arctic  biology,  its geophysical  insti-
 tute, the arctic research laboratory, are
 making valuable contributions to the ad-
 vancement of knowledge of our planet.
 The 1967 Federal budget, which pur-
 ported to allow both guns and "the high
 priced  spread"  would  sharply  curtail
 these activities. The new budget would
 eliminate $39,276 in the Alaska Agricul-
 ture Experiment Station funds for re-
 search conducted jointly by the Univer-
 sity and the Department of Agriculture.
 This cut, coupled with the budget's fail-
 tire to provide funds for continued agri-
 culture research in Alaska, amounting to
 $400,000 last year, will force the experi-
 ment station in Palmer to close.  This
 station has developed a potato that can
 compete favorably with imported pota-
 Loos-those locally grown had a high
 water content attributed to the exten-
 sive hours of growth under the long day-
 light  of  northern  latitudes.  Also just
 announced  by  the  Palmer  station  is
 a new variety of grass that will be of
 utmost importance to our dairy industry.
 It is vitally important that we in Alaska
 develop other products, for we are almost
 solely dependent upon air freight for the
 greater share of our fresh vegetables.
 Unless these funds are restored-if we
 are forced to close our research station,
 our harvest in many years to come will
 suffer, this is but another of the bitter
 fruits produced by the war in southeast
 Asia and nurtured by the ever-increasing
 escalation of our military efforts there.
 1' qually tragic is the drastic cutback in
 funds for instruction and facilities in
 land grant institutions. Here the Uni-
 versity of Alaska is losing over $230,000.
 This means that if the average salary of
 an instructor in Alaska is $10,000, we will
 lose 23 instructors.  Some programs will
 have to be eliminated.  Others may of
 necessity be cut back or held at their
 present levels.
 In a State that is noted for its richness
 in natural resources.   Yet we consider
 our most, important natural resource an
 educated populace.  If we must sacrifice
 something to bear the burden of the
 wholly unnecessary undeclared war in
 Vietnam let the sacrifice be made in
 other areas that we can more readily af-
 ford-not in the education of our youth.
 They will be sacrificed both at home and
 abroad by the southeast Asian folly.
 These funds should be restored.

 publican, of Vermont to provide for the
 election of presidential electors by the
 district system.
 There being no objection, the testi-
 molly of Senator MUNDT was ordered to
 be printed in the RECORD, as follows:
 Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to appear
 before this subcommittee on the question of
 electoral college reform.   This is an issue
 with which I have been closely associated
 since 1953 when I joined with former Repre-
 sentative Frederic R. Coudert, of New York,
 in introducing legislation which would elect
 presidential electors from districts within a
 State rather than from a State as a whole.
 Such a plan did not originate with us, al-
 though it has been  popularly  called  the
 Mundt-Coudert plan? for it was in fact origi-
 nally advocated by such early and mightier
 statesmen as James Madison, Thomas Jeffer-
 son, and John Quincy Adams.
 I point this out to emphasize that the need
 for such a plan has always existed although
 it  has  never  been  formally  adopted.  At
 least it has never been adopted on a national
 basis which would be the only fair way of
 utilizing such a procedure.  I believe that
 today the need is even greater than it has
 been in the past.
 As the result of Supreme Court decisions
 in. Baker v. Carr, and of particular signifi-
 cance to the question of electoral districts,
 Wesberry v. Sanders, a profound change has
 occurred in our system of representation-a
 change that has provided us with both the
 increased need for equalization within our
 presidential electoral process and the vehicle
 to achieve that equalization.
 Mr. Chairman, at a later point I will go
 into this matter of Wesberry v. Sanders and
 the subsequent redistricting of congressional
 districts so that they will be as equal in
 population as practical in more detail.  I will
 also cover the provisions of Senate Joint Res-
 olution 12; much of what I will say has been
 said before--the last time in 1961 before this
 same subcommittee.  I note, however, that
 very few of the same members are present
 as the certainties of time and the uncertain-
 ties of elections have taken their toll.
 For the present, let me say that I agree
 with James MacGregor Burns who has writ-
 ten:  "Most Americans, regardless of party,
 are agreed on the failings of the electoral
 college. It is unfair, inaccurate, uncertain,
 and undemocratic.  Unfair,  because  the
 presidential candidate losing a State by even
 a close margin forfeits all of that `State's
 electoral votes.  Inaccurate, because in most
 elections the winner's electoral votes are in-
 flated grotesquely out of proportion to his
 popular vote.  Uncertain, because presiden-
 tial electors are not legally bound to vote
 for the candidate who carries the State.  And
 undemocratic, because if no candidate wins
 a majority of the electoral college the verdict
 is rendered in the House of Representatives,
 where each State delegation, no matter how
 large, casts but a single vote in choosing
 among the three top candidates."
 Senate Joint Resolution 12, in my esti-
 mation, is  the  only  plan  proposed which
 would correct these inequities without snak-
 ing basic changes in our constitutional sys-
 tem.                                                                                                                                   It would correct the unfairness by
 eliminating the general ticket system,   It
 would correct the  inaccuracy  because   it
 would bring the electoral vote in line with
 the popular vote.  It would correct the un-
 certainty because it would bind the presi-
 dential electors to the winning candidate.
 ,It would correct the undemocratic factors
 because it provides for a greater voice for
 the larger States should Congress be forced
 to name  the President in  the  event  no
 candidate wins a majority of the electoral
 college.
 I stress this totality of correction for I be-
 lieve  that  the  amending  process                                                                                                                                        of  the
 Constitution should never be used to con-
 firm error; it should only be used to correct
 it and now that we have an opportunity to
 reexamine the electoral process for the Pres-
 ident of the United States we should do a
 thorough job of it and get to the real root
 of the problem which is the general ticket
 system.  This is not to say that I do not
 agree with some of the proposals advanced
 by President Johnson or that none of them
 are  desirable.   On  the  contrary,  Senase
 Joint  Resolution   12   includes  some   of
 them, and could be modified, I believe, to
 include others.   The real problem, however,
 is not the fact that the electors are not
 bound to follow the will of the majority--a
 situation that has occurred only 8 out of a
 possible  14,554 times  since  1820,  or  that
 certain gaps exist should the election be
 thrown into the House of Representatives--
 a Situation that hasn't occurred since 1824
 and has only happened twice in the history
 of our Nation.  The real problem is the in-
 equality of the voting power of the citizens
 of  the  various States-a situation which
 occurs every 4 years.
 This is the main theme of my proposal and
 it can be summed up in one sentence:
 I believe, and I hope you believe, and
 think you believe that every voter in. this
 country as an individual, whether he lives
 in California, Delaware, New York, or South
 Dakota, ought to have equal voting power
 when it comes to electing the President of
 the United States.
 This is the only important respect in which
 our electoral college system, so-called., has
 failed to function  with fairness.   It  has
 stood the practical test of time since our
 country was established.  It has carried us
 through 45 presidential elections, through
 peace and war, from George Washington to
 Lyndon B. Johnson.    It was after the 4th
 presidential election that the 12th amend-
 ment was added to the Constitution to re-
 quire presidential electors to vote specifi-
 cally for President and Vice President, rather
 than, as the original provision provided, for
 two persons for President.  Since then, 40
 presidential elections have been held.  It is
 obvious, therefore, that any system that has
 functioned so well for so long should not be
 changed lightly.  Changes proposed or made
 should be the absolute minimum required
 to bring about the desired and necessary
 results.
 Such minimum and wholly practical and
 necessary changes are proposed in Senate
 Joint Resolution 12, which :I am sponsoring
 together with Senators THURMOND, MoCLRL-
 LAN,   HRUSKA,   MORTON,   DOMINICK,   FOND,
 BOGGS,  STENNIS,  and  PROUTY.   This  is  a

 REDWOOD NATIONAL PARK BILL
 ENDORSED BY STATE GOVERN-
 MENT OF CALIFORNIA AND BY
 PIONEER CONSERVATION GROUP,
 SAVE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, last
 week I introduced a bill to establish a
 Redwood National Park in northern
 California.  I am grateful that a num-
 ber of my colleagues, Republicans and
 Democrats alike, have joined me as co-
 sponsors.  The proposed legislation, has
 the support of the President, the Depart-
 ment of the Interior, the Bureau of the
 Budget, and many other organizations,
 including the government of the State of
 California.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed at this point in the
 RECORD the text of a telegram I have re-
 ceived from the  distinguished chief
 executive of my State, Edmund G.
 Brown, fully endorsing the proposed leg-
 islation and particularly commending
 those features of the bill which provide
 for a smooth and equitable adjustment
 of the areas to be affected in the creation
 of a National Redwood Park.
 There being no objection, the telegram
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SACRAMENTO, CALIF.,
 February 24, 1966.
 Senator THOMAS H. KUCHEL,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.:
 Confirmation of telegram sent yesterday.
 I fully endorse your support and your ac-
 tion today in sponsoring legislation to create
 a National Redwoods Park in northern Cali-
 fornia.
 Since 1879 there have been proposals for
 such a redwood park.  To no avail.  Now
 with.the united efforts of President Johnson,
 Secretary Udall, you and Senator JACKSON,
 and  conservation-minded  people  of the
 Nation, we can fulfill this dream. Any fur-
 ther delay and it will be too late.
 I was particularly pleased to note that the
 legislation includes the elements you and I
 have insisted are essential-economic adjust-
 ment payments to preserve the tax base of
 the area, a greatly speeded up schedule for
 creation of the new park to Insure jobs and
 business development immediately and a pro-
 gram for rounding out and improving exist-
 ing State parks.
 I urge you and Senator JACIcsoN to sched-
 ule early hearings in order that every aspect
 of this proposed legislation can be fully ex-
 plored and perfecting amendments made so
 that the Redwoods National Park legislation
 can be enacted without further delay.
 EDMUND G. BROWN,
 Governor of California.
 Mr. KUCHEL.                                                  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent also to have printed
 in the RECORD a telegram of endorse-
 ment that I have received from Mr.
 Newton B. Drury, secretary of the Save
 the Redwoods League.                                         I value this en-
 dorsement highly.                                                                                                          The Redwood League
 is the pioneer conservation organization
 in this redwood area. In a recent state-
 ment, the Ford Foundation pointed out:
 Since it was founded in 1918, the league
 has defrayed (through private contribution)
 roughly one-half of the total  cost  of the
 State's  (California's)  28 redwood  parks
 whose current value is estimated at over
 $250 million.
 There being no objection, the telegram
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF.
 February 24, 1986.
 Senator THOMAS H. KUCHEL,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.:
 Glad to learn from the press that you sup-
 port the National Park Service plan as rec-
 ommended by the President for a Redwood
 National Park including Mill Creek Water-
 shed, Jedediah Smith and Del Norte coast
 redwoods.  Preservation of this area as an
 ecological unit and representative example
 of outstanding virgin redwood forest has
 been a top priority in the program of the
 save the Redwoods League for over 30 years.
 Our board of, directors on April 9, 1965, took
 action recommending this area as a Red-
 wood National Park for many reasons in-
 cluding outstanding quality administrative
 and protective consideration and feasibility.
 NEWTON B. DRURY,
 Secretary,
 Save the Redwoods League.
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, I Invite
 attention to the league's statement that
 the preservation of a national park in-
 cluding the Mill Creek watershed and
 the State parks in Del Norte County as
 a single ecological unit has been a top
 priority in the league's program for
 more than 30 years.
 I am confident that, as we continue to
 examine this problem, the bill which I
 have introduced will find increasing sup-
 port.
 The purpose of the league's program
 is the same as that of the program of the
 proposed legislation.
 A RECOR1 OF MISJUDGMENT
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 in one of the Nation's great newspapers,
 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, there was
 recently published an editorial regarding
 the statements of Gen. Maxwell Taylor.
 Personally, I lack confidence in his judg-
 ment and in his statements regarding
 Vietnam.
 Last June when he testified before a
 joint meeting of the Senate Committee
 on Foreign Relations and Armed Serv-
 ices, he predicted that the Hanoi gov-
 ernment would not commit its army fully
 to the conflict in South Vietnam.  He
 stated:
 They would not do it because they know
 we would destroy their economy.
 Recently he stated that there are three
 of North Vietnam's eight combat divi-
 sions presently fighting us in South Viet-
 nam.  If this later statement is accurate,
 then his previous prediction is just
 another of his statements proved wrong.
 Furthermore, at this same committee
 hearing when questioned regarding the
 then civilian Prime Minister of the Sai-
 gon government, Quat, he stated he was
 certain this government was stable and
 would not be overthrown by a coup.  Evi-
 dently, General Taylor's guess was fan-
 tastically wrong, or if based on informa-
 tion furnished by our CIA, his intelli-
 gence was bad.  The committee records
 show his answers.  The facts are that
 within the following 48 hours, before
 General Taylor left the United States for
 Vietnam, 10 generals operating one of
 those frequent Saigon coups, overturned
 the civilian Prime Minister and shortly
 thereafter the present Prime Minister,
 Ky, was installed by these generals.
 Incidentally, Ky was born and reared
 near Hanoi.  Some members of his pres-
 ent cabinet were also born and reared in
 North Vietnam.  This is just further evi-
 dence that we are involved in a miser-
 able civil war in Vietnam.
 The chairman in South Vietnam of the
 National Liberation Front, so-called, is
 Nguyen Huu Tho, a Saigon lawyer, who,
 it is stated, is not a Communist.  This
 National Liberation Front was formed
 years ago.  It is said the Vietcong mili-
 tary units come under its direction.
 Also, it has representatives at Hanoi and
 at the capitals of other Asiatic, African,
 and European nations.  Of. course, if

 February 2'8, 1966        CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 In Germany, an interesting series of cargo
 vessels  have   been  recently   built.  The
 Tabora. representative of this group, is a
 1.3,500-ton deadweight vessel powered by a
 0,6(X)-horsepower  MAN  K6Z78/155    direct-
 drive diesel giving a ship service speed of 19
 knots.
 The Clan Ravisall, another high-speed cargo
 liner built for the British and Commonwealth
 Shipping Co. for fast service to South Afri-
 can ports, is an 11,500-deadweight-ton vessel
 powered with a 10,350-horsepower Kincaid-
 Burmeister & Wain diesel.  This ship fea-
 tures advanced automatic control arrange-
 ments for the enginerooan and virtually all
 the total cargo capacity of 527,000 cubic feet
 is refrigerated.  This is the first of a new
 class that will include at least four ships.
 The    12,070-deadweight-ton    Sharistan,
 owned by the Strick Line, Ltd., is another
 new cargo vessel of advanced design.  Bridge
 control  of  the  10,000-horsepower  Doxford
 main diesel propulsion engine is featured
 along with automatic starting and control
 of generator sets and pumps.  This ship has
 a cargo capacity of 676,000 cubic feet and a
 service speed of 1.7 knots.  It is reported to
 be the fastest ship  in     the  Persian  Gulf
 service.
 The brandnew Australia Star, owned by
 the Blue Star Line is powered with a Vickers-
 Sulzer 8-cylinder 8RD90 diesel rated at 17,-
 600  horsepower.                                                                                                                                  She  is  an    11,600-ton-
 deadweight cargo liner with a service speed
 of 20 knots.     Length overall  is 526 feet;
 breadth, molded, is 70 feet; depth, molded, is
 41 feet, 9 inches; and draft, loaded, is 30 feet.
 This vessel will be used in the Europe-Aus-
 tralia run.

 February 28, 1966       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 there are negotiations to bring about
 peace, it would be futile to give in to the
 demands of Air Marshal Ky of the Saigon
 government and bar representatives of
 the Vietcong.  There can be no cease-fire
 or armistice secured at the conference
 table unless representatives of the Viet-
 cong are present as delegates independ-
 ent of the delegates of the Hanoi and Sai-
 gon governments.
 I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
 torial referred to from the St. Louis Post-
 Dispatch entitled "A Long Record of Mis-
 judgment" be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 A LONG RECORD OF MISJUDGMENT
 Victory is just around the corner.  That
 is the message Gen. Maxwell Taylor sought
 to convey to the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee  in  the hearings  on Vietnam
 Thursday.  The general's sincerity is not to
 be doubted, nor is there any doubt that his
 optimistic forecast if believable would be
 most welcome to the American people.  But
 it must be measured against earlier prom-
 ises of imminent success that did not mate-
 rialize,  and  against  conflicting                 forecasts,
 within the past few days, of a long, hard war.
 The unhappy truth is that at every stage
 of this escalating conflict whenever Con-
 gress raised questions about the deepening
 commitment, administration spokesmen have
 painted a rosy picture of imminent victory
 which subsequent events wiped out. General
 Taylor himself, 'along with  Secretary Mc-
 Namara, has repeatedly misjudged the situa-
 tion.             In October 1963, for example, he and
 Secretary McNamara returned from an in-
 spection tour to announce officially "their
 judgment that the major part of the (Ameri-
 can) military task can be completed by the
 end of 1965."
 In 1965 the United States had 15,000 troops
 in Vietnam.  Today there are 205,000 troops
 on the ground and another 100,000 naval
 and air forces are engaged.
 No matter how sincere General Taylor may
 have been in his 1963 estimate, or in his
 present one, the fact is inescapable that he
 has been disastrously and repeatedly wrong
 in the past and his judgment must there-
 fore be questioned today.  The record is
 incontrovertible, it seems to us, that the
 authors of this Vietnam war, who have re-
 peatedly advised the President to escalate
 just once more in the hope of an elusive
 victory, have never really understood what
 they were getting the American people into.
 The time is long past to reject this kind of
 advice.                                     -
 The idea that we have once more turned a
 corner and are now on the way to victory
 is also controverted by testimony before Con-
 gress, released only this week, of Mr. Mc-
 Namara and Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, Chair-
 man of the Joint Chiefs.  They were not be-
 fore television cameras but behind closed
 doors.  In the heavily censored transcript of
 their  evidence  before  the  Senate  Armed
 Services Committee, both indicated the Pen-
 tagon looks forward to a long and difficult
 war lasting many years.  Though they de-
 nied that final decisions have been taken,
 there is no doubt that the Pentagon is think-
 ing in terms of putting at least 600,000 troops
 into Vietnam before the often predicted vic-
 tory is attained.
 And yet that prediction of victory, _like
 others before it, rests upon imponderables
 which can destroy it-in this case, on the
 hunch, guess or hope that another escala-
 tion of such magnitude will not bring China
 with its millions of troops into the war.
 General Taylor plainly revealed, perhaps
 unconsciously,  why  there  is  such  a  dis-
 crepancy between the limited war which the
 administration proclaims and the unlimited
 nature of its objectives.  He spoke as if the
 objective is the modest one of simply "mak-
 ing Hanoi behave."                                                                          It became clear, how-
 ever, that in his mind this phrase means the
 total defeat of the Vietcong and the estab-
 lishment in South Vietnam of an anti-Com-
 munist government-which could only exist,
 as 10 years of experience shows, under a per-
 manent protectorate of American military
 power.
 If the administration shares this view of
 the objective, then it is seriously misleading
 the people in professing a desire for peace
 negotiations.  The only possible basis for ne-
 gotiations would be a willingness on both
 sides to accept a compromise that fell short
 of total victory for either.
 According to reports of Secretary General
 U Thant's peace explorations, Hanoi's terms
 for negotiation may net be so extreme as
 they have been pictured.  They are said to
 include a pause in the bombing, a halt to
 escalation of the ground fighting, and ac-
 ceptance of the Vietcong as a party to ne-
 gotiations.  President de Gaulle, who has
 written Ho Chi Minh expressing willingness
 to participate actively in a settlement at the
 proper time, is said to feel that peace calls
 for a three-stage process-first, a cease-fire,
 then establishment of a broadly represent-
 ative coalition government in South Vietnam,
 and finally a reconvened Geneva Conference
 to guarantee the neutrality of both South
 and North Vietnam.
 There would be nothing dishonorable in a
 settlement along these lines, and American
 policy ought to be firmly pointed in this
 direction as the alternative to an unlimited
 military escalation with increasing risk of
 world war.  Our true national interests can
 be better served by a neutralized southeast
 Asia than by a costly and misguided effort
 to establish a national military outpost on
 Asian soil.
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY
 REFORM
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, in his
 annual report to the U.N. Economic and
 Social Council, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer,
 the Managing Director of the Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund, made several
 comments which should be of great in-
 terest to the Senate.
 He said that the "really important is-
 sue" for the longer term in keeping
 international payments system function-
 ing smoothly was "whether arrange-
 ments can be made to insure that the
 maintenance of a balance in the U.S.
 international accounts will not have
 harmful effects on the world economy."
 He recognized the close relationship
 between the U.S. payments deficit and
 international monetary reform by con-
 cluding that prospects for avoiding any
 harmful effects from achievement of a
 balance in the U.S. payments "will de-
 pend to a considerable extent on appro-
 priate action to deal witfi the problem
 of international liquidity."
 On commenting on the U.S. balance-
 of-payments program, he said that he
 preferred the "voluntary" restraints on
 private U.S. capital outflows to policies
 which would reduce the growth of the
 U.S. economy.  He concluded:
 Nevertheless, continuation over the long
 run of a comprehensive program to restrict
 4075
 the outflow of capital from the United States
 would not only represent a break with U.S.
 tradition, but would also not be in the best
 interests of the international community.
 I hope that the administration will
 not ignore this warning. I hope that my
 colleagues will not dismiss it either. Mr.
 Schweitzer is one of the ablest interna-
 tional monetary experts in the world and
 is a distinguished civil servant.  He is
 giving our country good counsel.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that there be printed at this point
 in the RECORD an article entitled "IMF
 Quota Increase Cleared," , written by
 Edwin L. Dale, Jr., and published in the
 New York Times of Friday, ' February
 25, 1966; and an address by Mr. Pierre-
 Paul Schweitzer, before the Economic
 and Social Council of the United Nations,
 delivered on February 24, 1966.
 There being no objection, the article
 and address were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 19661
 IMF  QUOTA  INCREASE  CLEARED-25-PERCENT
 RISE ACCEPTED BY  59 NATIONS BUT DELAY
 IS   SEEN-FUND'S  CHIEF  VOICES  CONCERN
 ON U.S. PAYMENTS PLAN -
 (By Edwin L. Dale, Jr.)
 WASHINGTON, February 24.-The Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund announced today that
 the increase in members' quotas and draw-
 ing rights of 25 percent aproved in Septem-
 ber 1964, was now in effect.
 The fund went "over the top" as enough
 members, with large enough quotas, made
 their subscriptions.  So far, however, only
 69  of  the  IMF's  103  members  have  ac-
 cepted their larger quotas, with such major
 nations  as   West  Germany,   France,  the
 Netherlands, and Belgium yet to consent.
 No nation's quota can be increased without
 its consent.
 There is no indication here that these
 countries will refuse  to make their sub-
 scriptions.  However, the present deadline
 of March 25 will probably have to be ex-
 tended for another period of 6 months to
 give the members more time to complete in-
 ternal formalities.
 In a related development today, the Man-
 aging  Director  of  the  Monetary  Fund,
 Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, said that "the really
 important issue" for the longer term in keep-
 ing the international payments system func-
 tioning  Smoothly  was  "whether   arrange-
 ments can be made to insure that the main-
 tenance of a balance in the U.S. international
 accounts will not have harmful effects on the
 world economy."
 In giving his annual report on the IMF's
 activities to the United Nations Economic
 and Social Council in New York, Mr. Schweit-
 zer  said  that  prospects for avoiding any
 harmful effects from achievement of a bal-
 ance in U.S. payments "will depend to a
 considerable extent on appropriate action to
 deal  with  the problem  of  international
 liquidity."
 "Liquidity" is the term for the total of the
 nations' official financial reserves  and ac-
 cess to credit, which amounts to the where-
 withal for conducting world commerce.                                                                                                                                    Re-
 serves have been increased in recent years
 chiefly through the existence of the U.S.
 payments deficit.
 Mr. Schweitzer said there was broad agree-
 ment on the need to expand world reserves,
 but he urged that any solution take account
 of the needs of the less-developed countries
 as well as those of the industrial nations.
 Speaking of the U.S, efforts to solve its
 balance-of-payments problem, Mr. Schweit-
 zer said:

 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400030001-4
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE        February 28, 1966
 A.  solution * * * by  restraints  on  the
 outflow of private capital is much to be
 preferred to alternative policies which could
 lead to a contraction of the U.S. economy and
 an ensuing reduction in import demand."
 PERILS OF RESTRAINTS
 "Furthermore, the effort being made b}r
 the U.S.  authorities  to  prevent these re-
 straints from causing injury to the develop..
 ing countries, or other countries in relatively
 weak payments positions, is to be welcomed.
 "Nevertheless, continuation over the longer
 run of a comprehensive program to restrict
 the outflow of capital from the United States
 would not only represent a break with U.S.
 tradition, but would also not be in the best
 interests of the international community."
 When all the members of the fund accept
 the  quota  increase  that  became  effective
 today, the total of all quotas will rise from
 $16 to $21 billion.  Mr. Schweitzer said today
 that "it  should     not be long  before this
 occurs."
 TWO-THIRDS APPROVAL
 The quota increase became effective be-?
 cause 59 members having together 67.8 per.
 cent of total quotas have made their sub-
 scription.                               '['he  needed  amount  was  two-
 thirds of total quotas.
 '[he 59 include 11 of the 16 members that
 were granted increases of more than the 2.5
 percent provided by the  general formula.
 The five not included, all expected to sub-
 scribe  soon,  are  West  Germany,  Canada,
 Greece, Norway, and the Philippines.
 Mr. Schweitzer said that "the last 2 years,
 have been the busiest in the fund's history."
 Outstanding drawings now are at the record
 level of $4.3 billion and last year more coun-
 tries, 23, drew on the fund than ever before.
 ADDRESS BY THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THY;
 INTERNATIONAL    MONETARY    FUND,    MR.
 PIERRE-PAUL SCHWEITZER, BEFORE THE ECO-?
 NOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL OF THE UNITED
 NATIONS, FEBRUARY 24, 1966
 '['leis is the third year in which I have
 addressed the Economic and Social Council,
 and. I should like to say how much I appre-?
 ciate these opportunities to appear before
 you to discuss the many problems that we
 have in common.  Looking back at world
 economic developments in recent years, I
 believe that, we have cause for both dissatis-
 faction and. encouragement.  Acute poverty
 has persisted in many countries, along with
 hunger and even the fear of famine.  The
 gap between rich and poor countries remains
 painfully  wide,  with  the advance  of the
 poorer countries proceeding too slowly, and
 often. suffering grievous setbacks.
 At the same time, there has been an un-
 rivaled growth of world trade, a sustained
 and. high level of economic activity in much
 of the world, and a solid strengthening of
 international  monetary  cooperation.   The:
 continuation of economic growth at a sub-
 stantial rate cannot be regarded as accidero-?
 tal.  It is basically attributable to a set of
 policies and attitudes that have developed
 after World War II.  In all countries high
 rates of employment and economic growth
 have become accepted as high-priority ob-
 jectives.   Their  realization  in  individual
 countries has been facilitated by it refine-
 ment in methods of economic diagnosis and
 management.  It has been helped also by
 intensive cooperation and consultation on
 questions of economic policy in a number of
 bodies under the auspices of the United Na.-
 Boris, in the Fund and the World Bank, and
 iii other international organizations such  LS
 the GATT and the OECD.
 '['he favorable developments have not been
 'i niined  to  the industrial countries.   In-
 steed, growth rates in the developing court"
 tries have on the average about equaled those
 in the developed countries, and have been
 lugh by historical standards.  However, much
 of t he progress made by the developing coun-
 tries in increasing national growth rates has
 been nullified by the rapid increase in their
 populations, and we are all acutely aware
 that hundreds of millions of the world's peo-
 ple still live under deplorable conditions.
 If we are to raise the standard Of living of
 the developing countries to tolerable levels,
 it is an essential condition that an adequate
 growth rate be sustained in the highly in-
 dustrialized areas of the world, and we there-
 fore place great value on the advance made
 by the industrial countries.  Only as this
 progress continues can a rising demand be
 insured for the export products ,f the de-
 veloping countries and the maintenance of
 conditions under which a growing volume of
 development finance can reasonably be ex-
 pected to become available.  We should, at
 the same time, recognize that an adequate
 solution of the problems of the developing
 countries will not flow automatically from
 the  growing affluence  of a relatively few
 rich nations.  This will require a sustained
 effort by all countries, over many decades.
 This is an effort to which international orga-
 nizations must contribute their share, and it
 is one in which the Fund, in its own sphere,
 has been participating sine, its inception.
 During the past year, developments in the
 world economy and international payments
 have been more satisfactory than seemed
 likely when I addressed the Council a year
 ago.  First, in spite of some slowdown in
 several major countries, mainly in the first
 half of the year, high levels of employment
 have  continued.   Aggregate production  in
 the  industrial countries was substantially
 higher in 1965 than in 1964.  Second, the
 decline in the rate of growth of international
 trade during the first; half of the year was
 subsequently reversed.   Third, although a
 weakening in prices for primary products
 reduced the rise in the export receipts of the
 primary producing countries in the first half
 of 1965, thereafter commodity prices became
 steadier and the export earnings of primary
 producing countries improved.  Fourth, the
 sharp  tensions  in  international  payments
 which characterized late 1964 and early 1965
 have eased considerably.
 But I must also note the fact that the
 general  expansionary  trend  in  the  world
 economy  has  increased  the  pressures   on
 prices on a broad front.  The problems of
 how to avoid and how to contain inflationary
 pressures are now again among the major
 challenges facing all industrial countries.
 An acceleration in the pace of the U.S.
 economic advance in the second half of 1965
 was a major factor underlying the greater
 strength shown by the world economy.  For
 the  first time in many years, the rate of
 growth in North America was mari_edly high-
 er than in the other industrial areas.                                                                           Both
 the  United  States and  Canada were able
 to make considerable progress toward solv-
 ing their problems of unemployment.
 In the  industrial  countries  in  'Western
 Europe and in Japan, expansion was much
 less vigorous, and industrial output rose only
 slowly  until  the  fourth   quarter  of  1965.
 There was relative stability in the aggregate
 output of industrial countries outside North
 America in the earlier part of 1905 but this
 overall result  reflected  a  combination    of
 continued expansion in some countries, no-
 tably Germany, with relative slack in others.
 These latter iWluded France, Italy, Japan,
 and the United Kingdom, where measures
 had been taken to combat inflationary pres-
 sures or to redress balance of payments posi-
 tions.  However, in some of the li liter coun-
 tries, mainly France and Italy, output has
 recently  begun  to  expand  more  rapidly.
 Production in the industrial countries as a
 group now appears to be advancing at a more
 rapid rate than a year ago.  This year, their
 output may hopefully be expected to rise
 by a little over 4 percent-about the same
 rate as that recorded from 1964 to 1965.
 The temporary slowdown in the rise in
 world trade in the first half of last year af-
 fected the exports of the primary producing
 countries more than those of the :manufac-
 turing countries, whereas during the 1963--
 64 boom both had increased at about the
 same rate.  The wider fluctuations in the ex-
 port receipts from primary products can only
 partly be ascribed to the changes in demand
 in the industrial countries; supply conditions
 and structural factors appear to have been
 at least as important.
 The fall in prices from 1964 to 1965 only
 slowed but did not halt the growth in the
 export earnings of the primary producing
 countries.  Nevertheless the price movements
 adversely affected their balance-of-payments
 positions.  The primary producing countries
 had been in general surplus in 1963  and
 1964, but in. 1965 the more advanced mem-
 bers of this group ran into aggregate deficit.
 Although the developing countries as a whole
 continued to be in moderate Surplus through
 1965, the true measure of the pressure on
 their payments positions was again masked
 by the maintenance of rigid controls.
 When I addressed the Council a. year ago,
 both of the major reserve currencies were
 under pressure.  During the,past year both
 of these currencies were strengthened.  This
 happened in spite of the fact that two of
 the major industrial countries, France and
 Italy, were in substantial international sur-
 plus as a result of relatively slack domestic
 economies.  An offsetting factor was that the
 balance  of payments  of  Germany,  where
 boom  conditions existed  throughout  the
 year, swung from surplus into deficit. The
 continued expansion in Germany was the
 most important single factor, aside from the
 strong performance of the U.S. economy, in
 preventing the  recessionary tendencies in
 certain countries during 1965 from spread-
 ing to wider areas.  With ample reserves and
 a large volume of international transactions
 in relation to national income, Germany was
 well able to provide this expansionary im-
 pulse to the rest of the world.  Germany's
 imports rose by 20 percent between 1964 and
 1965, but its exports also rose and its deficit
 remained relatively  moderate  and  its  re-
 serve position strong.
 The most serious feature of the balance-
 of-payments problems of the United King-
 dom in 1964-65 was the deficit on current
 account, although at the same time an in-
 crease in the net outflow of long-term cap-
 ital made the position more difficult.  Sev-
 eral corrective measures taken by the United
 Kingdom late in 1964, including a temporary
 surcharge on imports, were supplemented in
 1965 and again more recently by the adop-
 tion of more restrictive financial and mone-
 tary polices and various restraints on the
 outflow of capital.  These measures resulted
 in some improvement in the current balance
 and a reduction in the net outflow of capital
 in the course of 1965.  Toward the end of
 the  year  a  considerable  strengthening  of
 sterling in exchange markets was in evidence.
 The U.S. deficit, unlike that of the United
 Kingdom, has persisted over a number of
 years. It  has   gradually  reduced  U.S. re-
 serves by about $10 billion from the post-
 war high of $26 billion in 1949.  The draw-
 ing down of the U.S. gold stock and tiie
 substantial increase in dollar reserves held
 by other countries have brought into sharp
 focus the need for achieveing a balance. in
 the U.S. payments positions.
 The United States has had a long succes-
 sion of large and, until last year, growing
 surpluses on  current  account.  its  overall
 payments imbalance has been cau-:ed prin-
 cipally by large outflows of public funds and
 increased outflows of private capital, stem-
 ming in part from the dominant position
 that the United States holds in the world's
 capital markets.  These outflows have been
 of great benefit to all the recipient coun-
 tries--especially                                                                                                                                                    to  the  developing  coun-
 tries--and  the                                                                                                                                               need  has  been  to achieve

 SENTIMENT ABOUT VIETNAM AT
 THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI
 Mr.  SYMINGTON.  Mr.  President,
 often news is made by dissenters and
 critics.
 Even though people in agreement often
 represent an overwhelming majority,
 content often appears less appealing
 than discontent.
 Last week, at the University of Mis-
 souri in Columbia, it was announced that
 50 persons were expected to take part
 in protesting our policies in Vietnam. I
 am told, however, that not more than 10
 actually participated at any one time.
 Very properly this news was reported
 and made headlines. Most of these same
 stories, however, failed to mention the
 fact, that shortly before the demonstra-
 tions, a great many more students at
 the university, specifically, 1,125, had
 signed petitions affirming their support
 of the policies of this administration in
 Vietnam.    -
 Those petitions were circulated by both
 the Young Democratic and the Young
 Republican Clubs at the university.
 I ask unanimous consent that the
 wording of the petition be printed at this
 point in the RECORD.  I also ask unani-
 mous consent that the names of all those
 who signed be printed at the point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the petition
 and  signatures were  ordered to be
 printed in the RECORD, as follows:
 VIETNAM PETITION
 Whereas the American commitment in the
 Vietnam war has become a major Issue on
 many college campuses;
 Whereas some of the most striking dis-
 senters to American policy in Vietnam have
 been college students; and
 Whereas these critics seem unrepresenta-
 tive of the majority of the students at the
 University of Missouri at Columbia: There-
 fore
 We the undersigned students of the Uni-
 versity of Missouri at Columbia, after con-
 sideration of the critical complexities of this
 issue, affirm our support of President Lyn-
 don B. Johnson and his administration's pol-
 icy in Vietnam.

 February 28, 1966        CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 'Yes, Mr. President, it is an outrageous
 disgrace that these peddlers of perverted
 pornography can traffic in their tar-
 nished trade in trash with insolent im-
 punity from successful prosecution by
 State or Federal authorities, behind the
 protective cloak of a Supreme Court, the
 majority of which seemingly cannot com-
 prehend the distinction between liberty
 and license.   Their distorted miscon-
 structions of the constitutional guaran-
 tee set forth in the first; amendment have
 virtually nullified our State and Federal
 regulatory statutes and have bound our
 prosecuting attorneys in a legal strait-
 jacket.  Certainly their recent decisions
 call to mind the accusation of John Mil-
 ton, wherein he charged:
 License they mean when they cry liberty.
 As summed up by one religious peri-
 odical :
 With billions  of dollars  at stake, smut
 merchants naturally fight any legal strictures
 on their business, hiding behind the first
 amendment, which guarantees freedom of the
 press.   Unfortunately,  many well-meaning
 jurists, organizations, and individuals who
 Lend  to  confuse  liberty and  license,  join
 these publishers in their cynical misuse of
 the Constitution,
 to the 1957 case of Roth v. United
 States. 354 U.S. 476, the Supreme Court
 upheld convictions under State and Fed-
 eral statutes dealing with the regulation
 of obscene publications.  In a compre-
 hensive decision, the Court set forth what
 many hoped to be an effective test for
 obscene material.  As stated by the
 Court:
 Obscene material is material which deals
 with sex in a manner appealing to prurient
 interests.
 The test to be applied was "whether to
 the average person, applying contempo-
 rary community standards, the dominant
 theme of the material taken as a whole
 appeals to prurient interest."
 However, the hopes of those who found
 encouragement in the Roth decision were
 soon dispelled_
 In 1962 the Court,  in the case of
 Manual Enterprises  v. Day,  370  U.S.
 478, held that in addition to the "pruri-
 ent interest" standard set forth in the
 Roth  decision,  the material must be
 "patently offensive" to fall without the
 protective shield of the first amend-
 ment.                   According to Harlan, this means
 only "hard-core" pornography can "con-
 stitutionally be reached under this or
 similar state obscenity statutes."
 The shocking impact of the Court's
 decision in the Manual Enterprises case
 cannot be fully realized without taking
 notice of the vile and obscene nature of
 the  material  involved  therein.   The
 Court's approval of such salacious trash
 which by its own admission consisted of
 publications "primarily, if not exclu-
 sively, for homosexuals, and have no
 literary, scientific or other merit" and
 which "would appeal to the prurient in-
 terest of such sexual deviates," is an
 outrageous and reprehensible perversion
 of the spirit as well as the letter of the
 first amendment.  As stated in Justice
 Clark's dissenting opinion, the decision,
 "despite the clear congressional man-
 date--requires the post office to be the
 world's largest disseminator of smut and
 the grand informer of the names and
 places where obscene material may be
 obtained."
 The indignation of the American peo-
 ple at these decisions was vividly de-
 scribed by Rev. John J. Regan, dean of
 St. Joseph's University of Liberal Arts
 and Sciences:
 We have come to expect periodic outbursts
 from the American public at the Supreme
 Court's  decisions  dealing  with  obscenity.
 The people are rightly concerned.  Our so-
 ciety is in the middle of an anti-Puritan
 revolution in morals. Any writer who man-
 ages to shock is automatically entitled to
 respect as a worthy rebel.   William Phillips,
 editor of the Partisan Review, has labeled
 the heroes of today's avant-garde as "the
 new immoralists."   He adds: "To embrace
 what is assumed to be beyond the pale is
 taken as a sign of true sophistication.  And
 this is not simply a change in sensibility; it
 amounts to sensibility of chaos."
 In reaction to this revolution, the ordinary
 citizen is developing a neurosis about courts
 and judges.  He sees the flood of pornog-
 raphy Inundating the newsstand and the lo-
 cal movie theater, and flowing steadly into
 the  private home  through the mails.  In
 desperation he is turning to the legislatures
 and ultimately to the courts for protection.
 But he is frustrated by the apparent lack of
 concern in the courts for his problem. He
 sees little of the delicate judicial task of
 balancing the public interest in the moral
 fabric of society with the equally important
 public interest in free speech.
 How Long must the people of America
 be subjected to the outrage of having
 their families and children subjected to
 the public presence of this shocking,
 salacious, obscene literature?
 How long must the public suffer the
 contempuous,  arrogant  disregard  for
 their rights exhibited by a court which
 seems obsessed with its role as the pro-
 tective guardian of those who seek to
 subvert every institution, idea, principle,
 and moral value which our people hold
 dear and upon which this great Nation
 has been established?
 We have taken progressive and effec-
 tive steps to purge the pollution from our
 streams and air; to beautify our public
 highways and national parks; to protect
 the physical and mental health of our
 families.
 When will be taken the necessary steps
 to purge the venomous stain of this ma-
 lignant, infectious, pornographic plague
 from the midst of our society?
 I submit that this responsibility rests
 with the Congress and that the time to
 act is now.

 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. Pre,, ident, I
 noticed in the Baltimore Sun of this
 morning the following headliner: "U.S.
 Paratrooper  Company  Beaten  Deci-
 sively."  Now there are a great many
 young  Americans  in South Vietnam.
 Those I have talked to were glad to be
 there. Perhaps a few were not.  But
 none of them are primarily responsible
 for being there, and I would hope the
 Senate would do everything in its power
 to in turn do its part by sending every-
 thing needed to help these young; Amer-
 icans as they wage this war in South
 Vietnam.
 EXPANSION OF SOCIAL SECURITY
 ACT
 Mr. PROUTY. Mr. President, many
 Members of the Senate have been receiv-
 ing mail from older folks about my bill,
 S. 350, which would blanket in under the
 Social Security Act all persons age 70
 and aver who do not now receive bene-
 fits.
 I arm pleased to announce that when
 the Senate proceeds to consider the ad-
 ministration tax bill, H.R. 12752, 1 shall
 offer the text of S. 350, with on!y minor
 technical changes, as an amendment to
 this measure.
 The amendment will provide that, :first,
 all retired people age 70 and over who do
 not now have insured. status will be eligi-
 ble for social security benefits at the rate
 of. $44 a month; the amount for spouses
 would be $22 per month; second, the
 transitional insured status provisions en-
 acted in 1965 would be repealed effective
 with the coming into force of my pro-
 posed amendment; third, the increased
 payroll taxes enacted in 1965 to cover the
 cost of the transitional insured status
 would  be  retained;  the  additional
 amounts needed to cover the expense of
 my proposal would be paid from general
 revenues;  and,  fourth,  the benefit
 amount for persons electing to retire
 early at reduced benefits would not be af-
 fected at age 70.
 Mr. President, this is indeed a very
 modest proposal. I. have said for a long
 time that the minimum social security
 benefit ought to be at the very least $70.
 One hundred dollars would, of course, be
 a more acceptable figure.  However, a
 majority of my colleagues do not yet
 seem to share this view, so I am attempt-
 ing to blanket in under the Social Se-
 curity Act all persons age 70 and over at
 the minimum rate of $44 per month.
 Included among those not now pro-
 tected by the law are retired farmers,
 retired teachers, and many other de-
 serving persons who never had an op-
 portunity to obtain social security cover-
 age during their working lifetimes.
 Many live in extremely reduced cir-
 cumstances.  They receive little help
 from the antipoverty program and their
 need is for cash.
 My amendment will not answer all
 their problems, but it may put a can of
 coffee, a pound of sugar, or a bag of flour
 on shelves that are rather empty at the
 present time.
 The amendment I shall offer would give
 social security protection to all :persons
 age 70 and over. All who may be inter-
 ested in cosponsoring this amendment
 should contact my office on extension
 2051.
 THE  ORGANIZATION AND  OPERA-
 TION OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
 Mr. PEARSON.  Mr. President, last
 August 16, ]1965, I introduced a bill for
 a commission to study and appraise the
 organization and operation of the ex-
 ecutive branch of the Government. This
 measure would create a new Hoover-
 type Commission which undertook stud-
 ies of Government reorganization in the
 past.
 Let me repeat the essence of the state-
 ment made at that time to the extent
 that I might note again that the Com-
 mission would be bipartisan in member-
 ship and would submit recommendations

 signed to abolish services and functions
 not necessary to the efficient conduct of
 the Government or which may be found
 to be in competition with private enter-
 prise.
 The study proposed would proceed
 with a view of improving Government
 efficiency and effecting economies where-
 ever possible.  We have learned that it
 is not easy to reduce the Federal expend-
 itures.  The proposed budget for fiscal
 year 1967 is ample proof of this thesis.
 But one safe way toward better Govern-
 ment is by reorganizing, merging, elimi-
 nating, consolidating, and standardizing
 those unnecessary and wasteful prac-
 tices which exist in the executive branch
 of the Government.
 The Commission should not, to my
 mind, devote itself only to new recom-

 has in proportion to its population, 360,000
 Americans would have been wiped out in 3
 years.
 That fact explains more than just why the
 Vietcong went to such great lengths Tues-
 day to assassinate the chief of Le My, a show-
 case village in the U.S. marines' pacification
 program.  It also sheds light on why the
 Vietnamese conflict in such a long, hard,
 dirty war.
 It helps explain, for instance, why the
 Vietcong is so tenacious.  In a complex so-
 ciety such as that of the United States where
 no man is indispensable, there can be a
 smooth transition from one administration
 to the next such as the one that took place
 after the assassination of President Ken-
 nedy.                   In a simple society such as Vietnam,
 however, where experienced administrators
 are at a premium and decisionmaking must
 consequently be more centralized, the loss
 of just one public official can be much more
 disruptive.
 It helps explain why U.S. bombing attacks
 haven't been as effective as was hoped, at
 least not so far.  The Vietcong likely feels
 that as long as it can decapitate South Viet-
 nam's social structure by assassinating pub-
 lic officials, it can lose a score of troops for
 every administrator it murders and still be
 ahead of the game.
 It helps explain why the United States has
 refused to include the Vietcong in any peace
 negotiations.  Among other reasons, there is
 an understandable reluctance on the part
 of representatives of a nation with a strict
 code of military conduct to sit at the same
 table with men whose hands are stained with
 the blood of innocent civilians.
 It also helps explain why the United States
 is having so much trouble winning the war.
 To us, life is not cheap and we would never
 think of stooping to assassination just as we
 have refrained from bombing civilian targets
 in North Vietnam.
 Does this mean the United States is fight-
 ing a war it cannot win?
 Not  necessarily.  Atrocities  are  nothing
 new in the history of human conflict, and
 as the Nuremberg trials and the more re-
 cent fate of Adolf Eichmann demonstrate,
 sooner or later there comes a day of reckon-
 ing for war criminals.
 Moreover, during the 1948-80 guerrilla war
 in Malaya, 2,473 civilians were slaughtered
 compared to 1,885 casualties among the se-
 curity forces.  But such tactics did not pre-
 vent the British and Malayans from defeat-
 ing the Communists.
 COMMENDATION OF VICE PRESI-
 DENT HUMPHREY
 (Mr. KING of Utah (at the request of
 Mr. WHITE of Texas) was granted per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include extra-
 neous matter.)
 Mr. KING of Utah.  Mr. Speaker,
 President Lyndon B. Johnson is a most
 unusual man, using the term in its com-
 plimentary sense.  A decision recently
 made by him is particularly worthy of
 commendation, the decision to make Vice
 President HUMPHREY, the Secretary of
 Agriculture, the Director of the AID
 Program, and other high Government of-
 ficials available to the Members of Con-
 gress to give them an in-depth briefing
 on their Vietnamese visits.
 The most unusual feature of this op-
 eration is the fact that the Vice President
 has been so completely available and so
 completely forthright.  Every Congress-
 man who has so desired, has had a
 chance to talk to him.  Every question
 asked has been answered.
 The atmosphere on Capitol Hill during
 the past week has been one of complete
 candor.  I for one feel that this has
 created a most healthy situation. I con-
 gratulate President Johnson on his new-
 est diplomatic tour de force, and reassure
 the Nation that on Capitol Hill no effort
 is being spared to get the facts.

 REPRINTING OF UKRAINIAN DAY

 Mr. FLOOD.  Mr. Speaker, with re-
 spect to the 48th anniversary of Ukrain-
 ian Independence, a private order is be-
 ing submitted for reprint publication of
 all statements and other insertions made
 by House Members prior to, during, and
 after the January 22, 1966, event, which
 was observed in the House on January

 U.S. AIRPOWER SHOULD NOT HAVE
 CLIPPED WINGS
 (Mr. ROGERS of Florida (at the re-
 quest of Mr.  WHITE  of Texas)  was
 granted permission to extend his re-
 marks at this point in the RECORD and
 to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. ROGERS of Florida.  Mr. Speak-
 er, U.S. ground forces in South Vietnam
 are operating under difficult circumstan-
 ces, yet our ground troops are under
 orders to fight to the finish.
 Ironically, where the United States
 has definite superiority, in the air over
 North Vietnam, U.S. airpower has its
 wings  clipped.  American  airmen  are
 subject to careful review of air targets
 prior to bombing missions, and many
 targets are spared even though they may
 have definite military importance to
 North Vietnam.
 If U.S. ground troops are told to fight
 to win, similar standards should be ap-
 plied to the use of U.S. airpower over
 North Vietnam.
 The President has stated that the
 United States will honor its commitment
 to defeat communism in Vietnam.  Let
 our commitment allow no room for sanc-
 tuary in North Vietnam, but be carried
 out with the same resolution in the air
 that our military forces now use on the
 ground.
 PROTECTION TO DESERT LAND
 ENTRIES
 (Mr. TUNNEY (at the request of Mr.
 WHITE of Texas) was granted permis-
 sion to extend his remarks at this point
 in the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. TUNNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I am
 introducing legislation which is designed
 to protect the claims of those who had
 rights to desert land entries before the
 Secretary of Interior ruled last year that
 there was not sufficient water from the
 Colorado River to allow the desert land
 entries to be cultivated.
 Desert land laws permit an individual
 to obtain title to as much as 320 acres
 of publicly owned land if certain condi-
 tions are met.  One important condition
 is that a water supply be available in an
 amount sufficient to make the lands ag-
 riculturally productive.
 Under the law at least $3 per acre must
 be spent on reclamation by the land-
 power within 3 years after the entry is
 filed.  By the end of 4 years at least
 one-eighth of the land must be under
 cultivation.
 Under the Maggie Havens ruling in
 1923 the Department of Interior sus-
 pended the time limits prescribed by des-
 ert land laws on certain lands until wa-
 ter for irrigation becomes available.
 The Secretary of the Interior on De-
 cember 2, 1965, determined that insuf-
 ficiency of water in the Colorado River to
 meet all the demands of the basin users
 required him to take action to terminate
 some 250 desert land entries principally
 in Imperial Valley, Calif.
 Whatever the gravity of the Colorado
 River water supply, I believe the pioneers
 and their descendants who have sought
 to develop these desert land entries since
 the early decade of this century should
 be protected in their opportunity to hold
 their land when water does become avail-
 able.
 As a participant in the Interior Com-
 mittee hearings on the lower Colorado
 River, I am well aware of the needs of
 protecting  and  augmenting  our  very
 valuable water supply.  That is why I
 have urged immediate studies on the pos-
 sibilities of importing water from the
 Northwest to replenish the supply of the
 Colorado River since California's use of
 Colorado River water for agriculture to-
 day approximates the allotment under
 the seven-party agreement.
 The action of the Secretary last De-
 cember has brought home in the starkest
 possible way the grim necessity of en-
 acting Colorado River legislation which
 will augment the Lower Colorado River
 Basin supply.
 In the meantime I am introducing this
 bill to preserve the desert land entry-
 mens right to perfect their entries when
 sufficient water becomes available.

 critics of our policy, both in and out of
 Congress, are saying. A president can be
 right and the entire country disagree with
 him.  Or he may be wrong and still enjoy
 mass approbation.
 We have an obligation to answer these
 arguments.  On one side some advocate at
 worst, complete surrender-that we get out
 right away. At best, they guise this defeat-
 ism in an enclave theory which would effec-
 tively give the bulk of the country over to
 the Communists and leave us isolated.
 Others  advocate  mass  bombing.   They
 want us to take the war to the Chinese main-
 land.   Their intension is honorable.                  The
 result would be devastation, but not victory.
 f nd their proposals might unleash a world
 war.
 Disparate as these critics are in the solu-
 tions they propose, they are similar in their
 eagerness to be relieved of the burdens of
 world leadership.  They both want us to get
 the  whole  thing  over  with.   Both  views
 .unack of the sentiments of Prime Minister
 Chamberlain.  Mr. Chamberlain once spoke
 to the British nation and I quote:     "Of a
 riuarrel in a far-away country between people
 of whom we know nothing--why should we
 get involved?"
 This was appeasement.  The result; was 6
 years of the bloodiest war in the history of
 mankind.   That appeasement would work
 was a myth then--it remains a myth now.
 These critics despair too soon.  We have
 =seen in South Vietnam in force for a scant
 6 months.  Only now is our presence being
 felt.  Six months ago, village after village was
 being surrounded  and  overcome, and the
 government forces had retreated to the town
 squares and to the city of Saigon itself.  To-
 day, many of the villages have been retaken
 and pacified.   More than that, the people
 know that we are there. They know that we
 intend to stay as long as necessary.  The im-
 pact is one of enormous significance.
 Just over a month ago I was in Vietnam.
 :C went there to see for myself.  I saw the
 condition of the country.  I saw the magni-
 tude of the job.  I saw that we were doing
 that job.
 I was impressed by the will of the Vietna-
 mese people.  But I must pause to tell you
 about our magnificent men.  Our forces are
 extremely able, alert, and intelligent.  Most
 of the men in our Armed Forces today are
 high school graduates.  Most of our officers
 are college graduates.  Most of them are
 trained in government, in economics      and
 political systems.  And most of them, thank
 God, understand the philosophical and po-
 litical threat of communism so that they
 know what the war is all about.  The morale
 of our men is tremendous.  Inspiring is the
 only word for it.   They know why we are
 there.  They know what we must do.  And
 they have the ability and will to do it.
 What then are the prospects for immedi-
 ate victory?  Victory in this instance is not
 like that of a conventional war, in that it
 must mean the containment of communism,
 and this will undoubtedly take time and ef-
 fort  and  sacrifice.   But  the  stakes  are
 enormous.
 I. recall as vividly as any experience of my
 life, the days of the Cuban crisis. You may
 remember that Congrrss had just adjourned
 arid President Kennedy summoned all of the
 congressional leaders back to Washington.
 There in the Cabinet Room of the White
 Louse he outlined in detail the Russian mis-
 sile threat to the United States.  For one
 terrible week the Nation looked down the
 nuclear barrel.  On the Monday after the
 Hunday morning that Khrushchev wrote his
 letter to the President indicating withdrawal
 of the missiles, President Kennedy said, at
 his final briefing: "The military threat of
 Russia is receding..  Now the threat will come
 from Communist China as it develops the
 hydrogen bomb."
 Two years later, almost to the day, gathered
 in the same room, with almost the same
 people,  with  the  exception  of  President
 Kennedy, President Johnson briefed us on
 the explosion of the first nuclear device in
 China.   There were many questions dire^,ted
 at Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara.
 One prevailed above all the others      What
 threat does this pose to the free world? The
 answer came back, candid and brief: Very
 little as of now, but a major and dangerous
 one 10 years from now, baring no change in
 the aggresive government now dominant in
 China.
 And as I talked with our leaders in Viet-
 nam and Saigon, these meetings kept recur-
 ring in my mind.
 :3o this is the ultimate challenge of Viet-
 nam.  Whether we turn back the threat now
 or whether we repeat the events of other days
 and ultimately  face  a  China  infinitely
 stronger than it is today and determined to
 conquer the rest of mankind.
 This is the challenge, but what of the
 future?  Our objectives are clear.  We in-
 tend to contain communism in Vietnam.
 We do not believe that the Communists will
 step unless we stand firm.  Thus, we are
 erecting a wall. Not a wall of brick: and stone
 and barbed wire, but a wall of will and
 resolution..
 Yet, at the same time, I want to aszure
 you that President Johnson is doing every-
 thing possible to get the Vietnam conflict to
 the conference table where we can achieve a
 just and honorable settlement.  Our emis-
 saries range the world for peace.  Now we
 take our search for peace into a new forum
 at the United Nations.
 We will stay in Vietnam no longer than is
 necessary.  We seek no territory or bases.
 We support free elections in South Vietnam
 if they can be conducted in peace and without
 Communist intimidation.
 The problem is, as the most recent pro-
 nouncements  from  Hanoi  so  graphically
 reveal, that the Communists do not yet want
 peace.  They still think they can win.
 Our enemies hope that we are a callow
 Nation. They  confuse  our reluctance to
 accept our destiny of world leadership with
 lack of resolve and thus call us a Paper tiger.
 They hope that we will be unwilling to bear
 the weight of world leadership when the
 mantle grows heavy.  They dream that the
 mightiest Nation in the world, with a gross
 national product of nearly three-quarters of
 a trillion dollars, will fall for the spurious
 aternative of guns or butter.  They hope
 that the Democratic Party, fearful of being
 characterized as a war party, will hesitate to
 conduct  our  Vietnam  policy  with  vigor.
 They cling to the vain expectation that our
 national determination will crumble.
 In. conclusion, let me quote from the ad-
 dress made by President Johnson at                                                                             the
 Johns Hopkins University in April 1965:
 "We fight because we must fight if we are
 to live in a world where every country can
 shape its own destiny.  And only in such a
 world will our own freedom be finally secure.
 "The first reality is that North. Vietnam
 iras.  attacked  the  independent  :nation  of
 South Vietnam.  Its object is total conquest.
 "Over this war, and all Asia, is another
 reality: The deepening shadow of Communist
 China.  The rulers in Hanoi are urged on by
 Peiping.   This is a regime which has destroy-
 ed freedom in Tibet, attacked India, and
 been condemned by the United Nations for
 aggression in Korea.  It is a nation which
 is helping the forces of violence in almost
 every continent.
 "Why are we in South Vietnam?
 "We are there because we have a promise
 to keep.  Since 1954 every American Presi-
 dent has offered support to the people of
 South Vietnam.  We have helped to build,
 and we have helped to defend.  Thus, over
 the years, we have made a national pledge
 to help  South Vietnam  defend its inde-
 pendence.                                                                                                                                     And  :1  intend  to  keep  that
 promise.
 "We are also there to strengthen world
 order.  To leave Vietnam to its fate would
 shake the confidence of all these people in
 the  value  of  American  commitment,  the
 value of America's word.  The result would
 be increased unrest and instability, and even
 wider war.
 "We    are  there because there are  great
 stakes in the balance.  Let no one think for
 a moment that retreat from Vietnam would
 bring an end to the conflict.  The battle
 would be renewed in one country and then
 another.  The central lesson of our time is
 that  the appetite  of  aggression is  never
 satisfied.
 "There are those who wonder why we have
 a responsibility there. We have it for the
 same reason we have a responsibility for the
 defense of the freedom of Europe.      World
 War II was fought in both Europe and Asia
 and when it ended, we found ourselves with
 continued responsibility for the defense of
 freedom.
 "Our  objective  is  the  independence    of
 South Vietnam, and its freedom from. attack.
 We want nothing for ourselves, only that the
 people of South Vietnam be allowed to guide
 their own country in their own way.
 "It should also be clear that the only path
 for reasonable men is the path of peaceful
 settlement.
 "Such  peace  demands  an  independent
 South Vietnam securely guaranteed and able
 to shape its own relationships to all others,
 free from outside interference, tied to no
 alliance, a  military  base  for  no  other
 country."

 Mr. KING of Utah.  Mr. Speaker, I
 was greatly impressed by some figures I
 read recently in the Salt Lake City Des-
 eret News. It pointed out:
 If the United States had as many mayors,
 police  chiefs,  and.  other government  ad-
 ministrators assassinated as South Vietnam
 has in proportion to its population, 360,000
 Americans would have been wiped out in
 3 years.
 The paper states that this throws light
 "on why the Vietnamese conflict is such
 a long, hard, dirty war."
 Atrocities are nothing new in the his-
 tory of human conflict, the paper con-
 tinues. It adds:
 Such tactics did not prevent the British
 and Malayans from defeating the Commu-
 nists.
 I suggest that this article is worth
 study, and I include it in the RECORD:

 come principally in the area of schooling.
 The emphasis has been derived largely from
 the almost universal disdain of top officials
 in the Office of Economic Opportunity for
 the present American educational system.
 The antipoverty program's most ambl-
 tious new educational method is the Job
 Corps, which itself amounts to a new and
 experimental,  coexistent  high  school  sys-
 tem.                   It has been discussed in earlier arti-
 cles in this series.
 Outside the Job Corps, the teaching meth-
 ods employed in antipoverty projects have
 not been especially inventive or distinctive,
 least of all in vocational training.  But the
 OEO is putting a premium on innovation in
 considering applications for grants, and some
 new fervor may be seeping into the schools.
 If there has not been much of acclaim in
 past performance, there is considerable fu-
 ture promise.
 The 25 boys in Project Re-Entry in Syra-
 cuse spend S mornings a week in class and
 5 afternoons at make-work jobs.  Their goal
 is to get back into high school or to acquire
 an "equivalency certificate."  Without either,
 their job .chances are dismal.
 These 25 boys are hard-core dropouts.  For
 them, life both in school and out has been a
 "poor scene."  Ralph Mingolelli and William
 Beard, two former schoolteachers who preside
 over Re-Entry, were asked how many of their
 scholars have had brushes with the police.
 Mingolelli. replied,  "Put  the  question the
 other way," and held up one finger.
 Teaching these dropouts is different.  The
 point of departure for morning class dis-
 cussion may well be one student's claims
 about his amours the night before.        The
 teacher's day may end at midnight in the
 police station, rescuing a pupil from whatever
 mess he has gotten into.  Says Mingolelli:
 "When you want to change the action, be-
 come a part of it."
 Since Project Re-Entry began last fall, only
 two have quit the program. Most of the rest
 will learn to read (passably), to do arithme-
 tic (primitively), and to embrace a life of
 work (decently).
 NEW IDEAS FOR OLD
 3. The OEO stakes a great deal on the hope
 that its new techniques and, of course, its
 basic approach will prove massively conta-
 gious; that new ideas will impinge on old in-
 stitutions: the schools, the welfare agencies,
 the hospitals, the community services.  In
 this  area,  the Washington Post inquirers
 brought back a mixed verdict.
 Some reporters saw a real feedback In the
 schools, where a premium was being put on
 original and imaginative programs as a basis
 for future OEO grants.  They noted the
 number of teachers and school administra-
 tors who are as disillusioned with old meth-
 ods as the OEO officials, and who chafe im-
 patiently to introduce changes.
 Others saw remarkable originality and an
 eagerness to shift gears in church groups,
 notably Catholic institutions, which are re-
 shaping themselves and their methods of ex-
 tending service to the poor who surround
 them.
 But  some  reporters  felt that  the old
 guard in schools and welfare services resisted
 change and plodded along as always, inert
 and untouched by the novel, strident sound
 of the voice of the poor.
 Some attitudes change hard, or not at all.
 Annie, a Negro woman in Atlanta who
 works when she can and goes on relief when
 she can't, was convinced by her neighbor-
 hood aid to look into the opportunities at
 her nearby center.
 On arrival, she was greeted by the same
 welfare worker, now employed by the center,
 whom she had dealt with under the old
 system.
 Said the worker:  "Well, Annie, here you
 are back again."
 Annie uttered a terse suggestion, turned
 on her heel and left.
 The reporters believed it likely, however,
 that the drive behind massive participation
 would some day force cities' public services,
 such as the school, health and welfare sys-
 tems, to accept representatives of the poor
 as members of their directing boards.  And
 they noted that once new ideas and methods
 are accepted at the top, they would find their
 way into effective action below, regardless of
 the traditionalist attitudes within the agen-
 cies.
 THE IDEA CATCHES.FIRE
 4. By far the most important innovation
 of the war on poverty is its insistence on
 the involvement of the poor, not merely as
 hired hands but as planners, originators, co-
 administrators and critics of the programs.
 The number of the participating poor is
 still in the  thousands,  but  the  idea has
 caught fire.  The unanimous view of the
 Washington Post's team is that its results
 cannot fail to be enormous: things will never
 be the same.  Their forecast was highly op-
 timistic  and                                                                                    usually  couched  in  excited
 terms.
 They believe that enough people have been
 involved already who will not let go lightly
 of new found hope, a remarkable resurgence
 of dignity and, to be frank, a natural in-
 flation of the ego that comes with being a
 member of this board or an officer of that.
 More tangibly, they saw representatives of
 the poor taking the first timid-and, para-
 doxically,  enormous-steps  at  telling  off
 members of the power structure, at declaim-
 ing their needs, speaking their pieces, and
 discovering, to their own surprise, growing
 confidence in their strength.
 Above all, the reporters were impressed
 with the potential of the neighborhood or
 community action centers organized under
 citywide  "umbrella  agencies"  in  several
 hundred localities.  They forecast that com-
 munity centers may become one of the great
 urban Institutions of the next generation.
 Already they have forced both the poor and
 the powerful to look much harder at the
 services the city and welfare agencies offer,
 They  have  intensified  concern  with  the
 schools in particular.  Although it was not
 anticipated, the centers have focused on
 urban renewal and Inadequate, remote, and
 callous medical services as objects of par-
 ticular  outrage.                                                                                     The  community   action
 centers have been innovative in bringing
 free legal services to the poor.  The programs
 are sensationally popular-and may produce
 sensational changes.
 Community  action programs  have                had
 especially heartening results in the South,
 where involvement of the poor means, in
 practice, involvement of the Negro.  South-
 ern moderates-and others who would now
 like to get off the segregation hook-can
 find in such programs a quiet way to begin
 constructive action, working on specific wel-
 fare projects side by side with Negroes.
 What  direction  the  community  action
 neighborhood centers will take remains to
 be seen. Civil rights groups are believed to
 be lurking in the wings, wondering what their
 role should be. More radical groups must
 be contemplating their potential.
 A new institution has been born-inherent
 with great promise.
 [From the Washington Post, Feb. 13, 1966]
 PROGRESS IN POVERTY
 The administration's well-advertised war
 against poverty is, on its first year's showing,
 a remarkable success.  Its achievements al-
 ready justify a forceful and steady expansion
 of its reach.  The series of articles in this
 newspaper by Alfred Friendly and his col-
 leagues have examined in some detail the
 nature of these achievements. And they also
 have shown the very important conditions
 of success in this enlightened campaign.
 It has not worked equally well in every
 circumstance.  The war on poverty is most
 effective where it involves urban Negroes. It
 is least effectve where it is dealing with white
 populations. The Economic Opportunity Act,
 and all of the reforms that it has set in train,
 are  the  direct  consequence  of  the  long
 struggle over civil rights.  The people who
 best comprehend the war against poverty are
 those who, at least vicariously and emotion-
 ally, took part in the civil rights marches and
 demonstrations.
 But among the 30 million Americans de-
 fined  as  impoverished,  three-quarters  are
 White.  The impact of the Opportunity Act is
 very largely  concentrated  upon  the most
 desperately deprived, embittered, and volatile
 slums.  They happen to be heavily Negro.
 Clearly the Office of Economic Opportunity
 made the right choice. But it is necessary to
 understand that a choice was made.  It was
 a choice forced by the limitations of the
 appropriations and lack of time for organiza-
 tion.  But it was a choice that has excluded
 most of the people termed poor.
 The poverty programs offer very little to
 the elderly, although the elderly comprise
 nearly a third of the' poor families in this
 country.  The great weight of the resources
 have been thrown into the programs  for
 children and young families.  Again, a choice
 was made.
 The poverty programs are fully effective
 only where mayor and school superintendents
 Welcome them.  The cities with big, vigorous
 community action programs  are those  in
 which mayors are urgently attempting to
 work out a new style of city politics. They
 are the cities where the old ward organiza-
 tions are collapsing, and mayors are looking
 for new lines of communication into the
 slums and particularly the Negro slums.
 While the slums want a hearing at city hall,
 it turns out that the more alert city halls
 want to hear from the slums.  In cities like
 Detroit and Pittsburgh, the community ac-
 tion organizations are serving this double
 purpose.  Where mayors are indifferent or
 hostile, as in Chicago or Los Angeles, com-
 munity action is a meager and hobbled af-
 fair.  Philadelphia demonstrates the point
 nicely.  Its city hall neither understands nor
 likes the idea of community action, and Phil-
 adelphia's community action programs are
 hobbled by a lack of leadership and compe-
 tent staff.  But the same city's new school
 board, elected last fall on a tide of votes for
 reform, has seized the Opportunity Act and is
 exploiting It forcefully.
 The Economic Opportunity Act has set
 loose the powerful concept of the participa-
 tion of the popr, as a bloc, in the affairs of
 the community.  The poor used to have at
 least the advantage of numbers, but now
 they are the minority in a hugely middle-
 class nation.  The Opportunity Act has not
 only provided the professional direction and
 staffing that this inarticulate bloc must have.
 It has also set off a great process of soul-
 searching and reorganization among num-
 berless school systems, welfare agencies, col-
 leges, hospitals, government offices, and po-
 litical parties.  In the long run, these Indirect
 effects may be the most telling.
 The war on poverty has generated confi-
 dence and aspiration where there was none.
 To carry it forward will require sturdier sup-
 port than the President's budget offers.  To
 out it back now, in this moment of hope,
 would be a  evere misfortune for the whole
 country,

 portunity's phase of the war on poverty will
 be a ridiculous boutonniere in the lapel of
 disaster, spurs on a jockey whose horse has
 dropped dead.
 But, assuming a continued high level of the
 American economy, a team of 8 Washing-
 ton Post reporters who studied the war on
 poverty over a 3-week period in more than 20
 communities throughout the country is con-
 vinced that it can do what it is supposed
 to do.
 Only here and there can it be measured by
 what it has accomplished so far;  but its
 promise can be measured. It looks enormous.
 "CONTROL" BY POOR?
 If it is to be realized, however, a handful
 of formidable problems must be solved:
 1. A miasma of confusion still lingers over
 the famous command that the program be
 carried out with the "maximum feasible par-
 ticipation" of the poor.  These are the most
 powerful words in the war on poverty; they
 are also the most plaguing.
 TO the extent that they axe rend to mean
 "control" of the programs by the poor, and
 to the extent that the purposes of the phrase
 are conceived of as an end rather than a
 means, to that extent the program will raise
 false hopes and kindle crippling fears.
 In and out of OEO a kind of mystique has
 been built up around the  conception, an
 inflation of a magnificent potential into a
 monster.  The real potential is that with
 "maximum participation" the poor can de-
 fine their needs and spotlight the inequities
 that  beset  them;   by  organizing  their
 strength they  can   help themselves carry
 through remedial projects; by acting politi-
 cally, in the broad sense of the word, they
 can   induce corrective  and helpful action
 from the powers that be.
 DRKAM VERSION
 The dream version-the pipe dream ver-
 eion--is that the poor can. weld themselves
 into  a strident, monolithic political force
 that can hammer city hall and the estab-
 lishment into submission, intimidate them
 by demonstrations, picketing, and more vio-
 lent measures, and mayhap, take them over.
 In a somewhat less extravagant piece of
 fantasy, some of  OEO's  theoreticians and
 many of the poor themselves have taken the
 phrase to mean that the poor must con-
 stitute the majority on the directing boards
 of each locality's antipoverty program.
 The naivete of the first conception, of mas-
 sive political conquest, needs little demon-
 stration.   The evidence is the most solid
 antagonism that the war on poverty first en-
 countered on this score among the Nation's
 mayors.  It now Is happily abated.
 COMMuJ'NrrY LEADERSHIP
 But the practical problems of the second
 conception, inherent even when the poor are
 not in the majority but where their par-
 ticipation is too consuming, are almost as
 fatal.  OEO has still to reckon with them
 effectively.
 An antipoverty program in any community
 cannot be successful unless it is directed by
 the  leadership  forces  in  the  community,
 along with the poor.  Usually this means the
 mayor; it must Include the superintendent
 of schools; it should include other top city
 department  officials, the   leaders  of  the
 dominant religious organizations, and repre-
 sentatives of the Community Chest agencies;
 i.t Is lost without delegates from the estab-
 lishment, i.e., the most influential political
 and nonpolitical personages in town.
 l~ven at lower levels, where individual anti-
 ;'overty projects are being conducted-in the
 schools, the neighborhood centers, the shops,
 and welfare and counseling offices-tile di-
 rection of professionals responsible to the
 citywide agency and the guidance of trained
 technicians on the staff are indispensable.
 2. A second dismaying problem is the pro-
 spective reduction in OEO appropriations,
 and its consequences on the momentum of
 the war on poverty.
 On paper, the requested $1,750 million for
 OEO next year is larger than its current
 $1,500 million.  In rate of spending, how-
 ever, it will almost certainly be considerably
 smaller.
 FUNDS SPREAD OUT
 The  financial  details  are intricate, but
 the essence is that the rate at which OEO
 will be funding projects this sopring if far
 higher  than    the rate it  can.  maintain
 throughout fiscal year 1967.
 If, after all the ballyhoo and glowini  ex-
 pectations,  the  tempo of the  progra a                                                                               is
 reduced, the psychological impact will be
 severe and could be ugly, even disastrous . If
 the muscle is cut, its regeneration Is un-
 likely.
 8. OEO has yet to face up squarely and
 publicly to the curious fact that its pro-
 gram is deplorably fractional  and th,t                                                                         it
 appears to have no plans for making it :'om-
 plete.  Indeed, OEO seems almost indiffer-
 en t to the inequity.
 ONLY SHOWING GOALS
 At best, in a couple of its national pro-
 grams  like  Headstart  and  Neighbor;iood
 Youth Corps, it will serve over a year-rrmnd
 period something like 20 percent of hose
 who stand in need of the program. Other
 ventures, like Job Corps and individual proj-
 ects in the cities' community action pro-
 grams, will touch only from 3 to 10 pe:cent
 of their particular "universes of need."
 In a sense, then, the war on poverty is
 something like  a  demonstration program,
 showing that various goals can be achieved
 but not trying to achieve them in a volume
 even approaching totality.
 It cannot remain indefinitely in that pos-
 ture, which is completely alien to the Ameri-
 can tradition of fairness.  A city, Strapped
 for funds, does not give hot school lunches
 to only half the children that :need them,
 but gives half-adequate lunches to all.
 Where will  the correction  of OEO'e  all
 for 10 percent, none for 90 come from?
 In theory, if a demonstration or 10 percent
 sample  project  proves  itself successful in
 Dubuque, the city fathers of Dubuque will
 take it over, expand it by 10 and serve the
 totality of :its needy.
 But in view of the present state of fins aces
 of the average American city, and its non-
 existent prospects for much mole revenue,
 nothing could be more unlikely.
 FEDERAL FUNDS?
 Must the job then be done by Federal
 funds, expanded 5 to 10 times above the
 present OEO appropriations?   Presumrbly.
 But OEO is silent on even whether it will
 ask: Congress for that kind of money in the
 future.   At  present,  it  obviously ha:. no
 chance.
 So the war on poverty functions only In
 part, like a, hospital where the doctors treat
 only every 10th or 20th patient.
 There are many other faults of the war
 on  poverty-maladministration,  too  hasty
 and too diffuse operations, corruption, delay,
 sonic  silly  projects,  some  excess Madison
 Avenueism.    There have been many failures.
 All of these are the sort that present Ir-
 resistible invitations for roaring (and trans-
 parently gleeful)  complaint by every shrill
 critic from Congress down to the poverty
 wards.   These categories of criticism have
 been highly publicized.
 What is important about them, however,
 is that they are correctable, not inherently
 unsolvable.   Which means they are really
 not important to a total assessment of the
 potential of the war on poverty.

 STRONG WEAPONS IN POVERTY WAR
 (By Alfred Friendly)
 The major claim that the war on poverty
 directors make for their program is that it
 is innovative and that the innovations work.
 If it is not that, it is nothing.
 Its newness and usefulness, they assert,
 lie in its techniques, methods, and general
 philosophic approach.
 A team of Washington Post reporters set
 out to assess the war on poverty in terms of
 those claims.  Their consensus, very largely
 positive, follows.
 POOR HELP THE POOR
 1. The principal new technique that the
 war on poverty set out to demonstrate was
 that the poor themselves could operate many
 of the own welfare projects, thus performing
 a great portion of the tasks necessary to im-
 prove their environment and position.  More
 generally, the concept Is that the poor can
 do a host of jobs hitherto thought to be
 within the competence only of professionals
 or well-trained craftsmen-teachers, organi-
 zers, office workers, technical assistants.
 In Rochester, Herbert M. Greenberg started
 a demonstration project using neighborhood
 women-all of them poor, none with much
 more than grade school education--to teach
 preschoolers.
 The first stage of the project Is now under-
 way in the cheerful basement of a church
 in the Negro area of town.  Doing the work
 are a half dozen of these neighborhood teach-
 ers' aids and only two professionally trained
 child care specialists for 30-soon to be '10.-
 children.
 One  of  the  professionals,  a  singularly
 pretty young woman named      Nancy Lyke,
 bubbles with  enthusiasm.   "It's astonish-
 ing," she says; "it's the most thrilling thing
 I've ever done. These girls  (the teachers'
 aids) can do so much more for the children
 than we could ever do."
 "First of all, they can get to the homes
 and bring the kids in here; second, they can
 get  the  mothers  Involved.   Mainly,  it  is
 they-and not any middle-class person--who
 can put across the truly important idea, the
 project's main purpose going to school is a
 good thing and school isn't merely another
 manifestation of that hostile society that
 the kids' families fear."
 Mrs.  Lyke  referred  to  the  forthcoming
 employment in the preschool center  of a
 cook, a general manager, clerk-typists, health
 workers,  a  bookkeeper,  and  maintenance
 workers--all of them without prior training
 in the skills of their new jobs.
 "The use of neighborhood people is just
 as valuable and feasible in other areas as it
 Is with teacher's aids.  They have warmth
 and understanding, an ease that is utterly
 lacking among the outriders.  They are our
 arms into a community where social workers
 from the red feather agencies failed."
 There is  little  doubt  that the war on
 poverty has proved the point, and it is an
 important one; workers can be recruited from
 the ranks of the poor and quickly made com-
 petent.  In the task ahead-not merely con-
 quering poverty but making the quality of
 life better for all Americans-there are sim-
 ply not enough professionals  and techni-
 cians to go around; "subprofessionals" will
 be needed by the millions.
 However, the Washington Post's team was
 unanimous and emphatic on one caution:
 The poor alone, the subprofessionals, are lost
 in almost every job without the shoulder--to-
 shoulder cooperation of experts.  The ratio
 need not be high, but one or two "pros" are
 indispensable.  A Nancy Lyke is needed at
 the top.

 The President made' a powerful and per-
 suasive defense of his policies in Vietnam in
 his address at the National Freedom Award
 ceremonies in New York Wednesday.
 He disposed of the allegation that our ob-
 jectives are unlimited with a flat "no."  He
 dealt with the repeated expressions of anxi-
 ety about deliberate escalation of the war
 by voicing his own opposition to mindless
 escalation.  He dealt with the hawks who
 have complained that not enough has been
 sent to General Westmoreland. He responded
 to the criticism that we fight alone by cit-
 ing our allies.  He made it plain we will not
 deliberately widen the war.  He again em-
 phasized the pacification program in which
 social and economic aids will parallel mili-
 tary efforts.  He made it clear that we will
 not impose a coalition government-or any
 government on the South Vietnamese.  He
 vigorously defended the peace offensive. He
 wisely put no time limit on American sup-
 port to South Vietnam.  He reviewed again
 the long train of commitments that brought
 us to South Vietnam. He closed with the
 stirring words of President Kennedy: "We
 shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet
 any hardship, support any friend, oppose any
 foe to assure the survival and the success of
 liberty."
 It was time that the President restated
 our ends and reaffirmed our determination.
 It is not to reproach the critics but only to
 state a fact of life to say that the on-going
 debate over policies in South Vietnam has
 created an impression of irresolution and
 indecision.   Whether it has given any aid
 to the enemy Or not, it probably has given
 them some comfort. And it has helped con-
 firm the favorite illusion of the Vietcong-
 that the United States is another broken
 and bankrupt France that can be driven out
 of South Vietnam by the collapse of morale
 at home.
 It will not be sufficient to attack this illu-
 sion with occasional reassertions of purpose.
 By act and word we must make it plain,
 again and again, that we are ready for a long
 and hard struggle to preserve the right of
 the South Vietnamese people to determine
 years ago and eventually became Public
 Law 660 of the 84th Congress.  Since
 that time, the Committee on Public
 Works has made several forward-looking
 changes in the initial legislation and the
 proposal that I am presenting to the Con-
 gress today carries forth the spirit of that
 program.
 It is a tragedy in this day and age to
 see the waste and spoilage of our Na-
 tion's waters. We are all guilty whether
 we be private or public entities or wheth-
 er we be a part of the Federal, State, or
 local governments.
 Last year the Water Quality Act of
 1965, of which I was a cosponsor and
 upon which hearings were held before
 the Committee on Public Works and
 which is now on the statute books of our
 Nation, brought into the program the
 further development of the cooperation
 we hope to create between Federal, State,
 and local governments, industry and pri-
 vate citizens to solve this problem. This
 bill will guide us down that road.
 For the information of the Members,
 there is included a rather brief summary
 of the four major titles of the bill:
 Title I provides a new approach to the
 water pollution problem.   It  is aimed at
 cleaning up entire river basins through the
 development of comprehensive pollution con-
 trol and abatement plans for selected river
 basins, and through grants to assist in fi-
 nancing  the  development                                                          costs  of  waste
 treatment works in accordance with the
 plan.   The plan itself will include water-
 quality standards established under the cri-
 teria of the Water Quality Act of 1965, ade-
 quate provisions for enforcing those stand-
 ards,                                                 a  permanent  local   or  interstate
 organization to carry out the plan, and
 adequate local financial programs to assure
 the maintenance of water quality and future
 expansion of treatment works.
 Title II provides  for an attack on the
 pollution problem on a statewide basis.  It

 ADDRESS OF THEODORE R.  MCKELDIN, MAYOR
 OF BALTIMORE, MARYLAND STATE SUNDAY AT
 VALLEY FORGE, FEBRUARY  13,  1966
 A hundred and eighty-eight years have
 passed since Washington and his Army un-
 derwent the ordeal that has made the name
 of this place famous in American annals.
 It is a long time-a hundred and eighty-
 eight years-but not long enough to dim the
 glory of their achievement; nor has it di-
 minished, but, rather, increased our amaze-
 ment at what they were able to endure.
 For what they exhibited in the highest
 degree is the basic military virtue, the foun-
 dation on which all the others rest.  That
 virtue is endurance.  Without it, the most
 brilliant tactics, the most desperate courage,
 the most furious assault, can never win a
 great war and only partial and transient suc-
 cess in a small one.                                                                                                                                  Valley Forge proved
 that the force commanded by Washington
 had the one quality without which no army
 can become a really great one.
 This place was not the scene of any of the
 brilliant feats of arms that are the subject
 of legend and song.  Not here "the embattled
 farmers stood and fired the shot heard round
 the world."  It was not here that Sergeant
 Jasper leaped over the parapet and retrieved
 the fallen flag.  Not here did Washington
 give the British King the Christmas gift
 of a shattered mercenary army.  Not here
 did Nathaniel Greene, our American Fabius,
 slowly wear out an army too strong for him
 in pitched battle.  Nothing happened here
 except the stoic suffering that proved our
 men had the highest military virtue of all,
 the ability to imagine death, but not defeat.
 It is appropriate, then, that nearly two
 centuries later we are still gathering here to
 celebrate what was demonstrated here, not

 of the Nation In 1778, it means the salvation
 of the world in 1966.  If they had failed, the
 United States of America would never have
 been born,   If we fail, a despairing next
 generation may well believe that it might
 as well not, have been born, since it lacked
 the element of survival and therefore raised
 hopes only to dash them.  So It is not un-
 reasonable to say that failure on our part
 would be worse than if they had failed.
 Prom the physical standpoint, of course,
 there is no comparison of our ordeal with
 theirs.  We are not leaving bloody footprints
 in the snow, our comrades are not dying
 without doctors or medicines, few of us are
 suffering  constant  hunger,  constant  pain.,
 endless  back-breaking  labor.    From  that
 standpoint, we are indeed the fortunate ones.
 Rut if we view it from the mental and
 spiritual, not the physical angle, I am not
 :so sure of our advantage.  The men of 1T78
 knew what they had to do.  They had to
 win that war.  No doubt they knew that in
 time other problems would arise, but until
 the war was won it was useless to think
 about anything else.
 We, too, have a war on our hands, but it
 is a comparatively small war, and there are
 a hundred other problems that will not wait
 for peace.  On only a few of these is there
 any general agreement on what we ought
 to do, while on some there is strong, almost
 violent disagreement  among Americans  of
 equal honesty and Intelligence.  That is to
 say, we suffer from distractions that the men
 of Washington's army escaped.    Our ordeal
 is more mental than physical, but if we can't
 stand it we are certainly as complete failures
 as men who break down under physical tor-
 ture.
 So if we come to Valley Forge filled with
 admiration and gratitude, which we certainly
 ought to do, I submit that we ought also to
 come in a spirit of deep humility.  We are
 better off than the men who suffered here,
 but not as much better off as complacent
 Americans  tend to  believe.   It was  their
 responsibility to deliver the country from
 the tyranny of a foreign prince.  But it is
 ours to deliver it from tyrants far worse, and
 much harder to defeat, than George III.   We
 have to defend it from the tyranny of pre-
 judice, ignorance, hatred, and stupidity; and
 our failure would be more disastrous be-
 cause it would affect not one country only
 but all the world.
 To strengthen our spirits surely we can
 do no better than resort to this shrine of
 patriotism; for from this source, if from any,
 we should be able to draw new resolutior:i
 and stouter courage.  It was here that our
 forefathers met the supreme test of their
 time and passed it to the admiration of the
 world.  So from this place their descendants
 should go out steeled to resist the failures,
 follies, and misfortunes of our time.  If the
 fair  reward  of  political  freedom  was  the
 ideal that nerved them for the ordeal, do
 we lack the promise of an even fairer re-
 ward?
 I think not.      I think, on the contrary,
 that the reward offered us is as much great-.
 or than the one that inspired their cour-
 age and devotion, as the terrestrial globe is,
 greater than the United States.  It is the
 promise that, not by conquest, not by coer-?
 cion of any kind, but simply by a practical.
 demonstration  of the  ancient truth  that
 "righteousness exalteth a nation" we may
 persuade men of diverse races and many,
 tongues to accept, not the institutions, but
 the principles of government that our an-
 cestors  formulated  and  expressed  in  the
 Declaration of American Independence.
 But for the very reason that this is a
 process of moral suasion, not of compulsion,
 it cannot be rapid;  and to be compelled
 to "snake haste slowly" is one of the severest
 tests to which an  American can be put.
 We have always been precipitate.  We rushed
 to the Pacific in just 40 percent of the time
 that Jefferson--himself a fast mover as the
 Louisiana  Purchase  showed-thought  we
 would need.  We built a, gigantic railroad
 system with Incredible speed.  We Invented
 the telegraph and the telephone and the
 aeroplane. It was said of Theodore Roose-
 velt, but it might be said. of I to                                                                            typical
 American that "his natural gait a running
 awa.y."
 Then to call on such a nation to stop
 and. consider, to wait for the auspicious mo-
 ment, to apply pressure slightly, but stead-
 ily and for a long, long time-that puts a
 hasty nation. to a very  hard ti st indeed.
 We want results now, or by next week at
 the latest.   We are  builders, rather than
 cultivators, and to ask us to stand patiently
 while  the    seasons follow  their  leisurely
 round is hard on us.  Consider. for exam-
 ple, the United Nations.                                                                            It is now 21 years
 old and it hasn't reconstructed the world
 yet.  So there are voices constantly demand-
 ing that the thing be abandoned                                                                                   But the
 reconstruction of the world would be won-
 derfully swift if it were done in three gen-
 erations, that is, In a single century.
 This explains why I contend that February
 19Gd, is as definitely "the winter ~,f our dis-
 content" as February 1778, was.  It is differ-
 ent., certainly.  The present ordi'al is psy-
 chological, rather than physical, but never
 doubt that it is an ordeal, and never doubt
 that if we fail the present test the result will
 be as disastrous as failure would have been
 in the 18th century.
 But at Valley Forge the America as did not
 fail---and we, too, are Americans   Part of
 our :Inheritance is the trim determination,
 the dogged refusal even to imacrne defeat
 that brought the men of old at last to York-
 town to accept the surrender of a beaten
 foe.  The British Army band on chat occa-
 sion played a tune called, "The World Turned
 Upside Down," but It was their final bad
 guess. It was in fact the day when; this part
 of the world at last was set rightsic,e up.
 So if we  are now  enduring a spiritual
 Valley Forge, shall we not regard it as the
 prelude to a spiritual Yorktown that is bound
 to come?  We are nto fighting Redcoats now.
 Such military foes as we have may be curi-
 ously described as yellow Reds.  But by far
 the heavier, tougher battle is against the in-
 visible foes I named a few minute= ago.  Nor
 are  they foreign,  for prejuice, ignorance,
 hatred, and stupidity have no nationality;
 they are universal, and their presence among
 us is more to be feared than their invasion
 from abroad.
 By the same token, we may expt?ct victory
 in this war to be longer delayed than it was
 in the 7 years of the Revolution, for the
 issues are greater and more widespread.  Yet
 victory in this struggle will be coven more
 glorious; for while the mean of old won us
 freedom as a nation, if we can mrtch their
 courage, their endurance, and their faith,
 we may emerge, not merely as a free nation,
 but. as a leader of all free nations in the
 search for that wisdom whose "ways are ways
 of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace."
 WATER POLLUTION
 (Mr. SICKLES (at the request of Mr.
 WHITE of Texas) was granted permis-
 sion to extend his remarks at this point
 in the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. SICKLES. Mr. Speaker, when. this
 country was first discovered, the supply
 of clean water seemed unlimited.  The
 great bodies of water were more than
 adequate for fish and wildlife, and they
 were used for irrigation, for the produc-
 tion of power, and as inland highways for
 agriculture and industry.
 But these waterways also were used
 as dumps for waste products without
 thought to the consequences for future
 generations.
 Nationally, the problem of water sup-
 ply has grown into one of major sig-
 nificance.  We are making enormous de-
 mands on our water supplies- and it is
 estimated that at the current rate our
 requirements will greatly exceed supplies
 within the short period of 15 years.  This
 means that we must hasten the cleanup
 of our fouled waters and adapt means to
 reuse water wherever possible.
 This effort will tax our technical skill,,
 our innovating ability, and our capital
 resources, both public and private, and
 at all levels of society.
 On the east coast of the United States,
 the severe drought conditions which have
 plagued some areas, such as New York
 City, are previews of things to come
 for all cf us unless we face the problem
 of managing water resources.
 Because this is a national problem,
 there are naturally a number of legisla-
 tive measures which have been enacted
 by the Congress or which will be voted
 upon in the near future.  The Water
 Quality Act of 1965 was enacted to amend
 the basic Water Pollution Control and
 Abatement Act  of  1961.  The  Water
 Quality Act provided means for addi-
 tional pollution research and develop-
 ment, increased grants for construction
 of municipal sewage treatment works,
 and authorized establishment of water
 quality standards on interstate water-
 ways.
 Over  the  next  10  years,  we  could
 achieve very dramatic gains in the ap-
 pearance and quality of our rivers and
 waterways. It does not take too long
 for streams to cleanse themselves, if
 there is a fast current flow, and if the
 flow of pollution into them steps.  But
 to stop the inflow of pollution is going to
 require a massive investment in order
 to build the great number of sewage
 treatment plants needed.
 The magnitude of the effort is indi-
 cated in a report made recently by the
 Senate Committee on Public Works.
 Although, State, Federal, and local offi-
 cials, as well as representatives of indus-
 try were found to be overwhelmingly in
 favor of the present program of sewage
 treatment construction grants, they all
 agreed that current authorization for
 $150 million annually is entirely inade-
 quate to keep pace with the problem--
 and even this authorization is scheduled
 to expire on June 30 of next year.
 Right now, for example, 367 new sew-
 age treatment centers are needed just iri
 the largest cities of the United States at a
 total cost of over $1,300 million.  'rho
 Federal share of 30 percent of this comes
 to $397 million.
 There is a current need in Baltimore
 for three sewage treatment centers at a
 cost of $6 million, and by 1972 there will

 PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 89th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION
 WASHINGTON, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1966
 House of Representatives
 The House met at 12 o'clock noon.
 The Reverend W. G. Henson Jacobs,
 rector, St. Augustine's Episcopal. Church,
 Brooklyn, N.Y., offered the following
 prayer:
 Create in me a clean heart, 0 God;
 and renew a right spirit within me.
 Let us pray.
 Almighty God, who provideth for Thy
 people by Thy power, and rulest over
 them in love: Me commend to Thy good
 providence, Thy servant, our President,
 and all those who with him take counsel
 for the peace of this Nation, and the
 world. Especially do we commend to the
 guidance of Thy Holy Spirit, the Repre-
 sentatives of Thy people, gathered to-
 gether in this House, under the leader-
 ship of Thy servant, the Speaker.  Let
 Thy wisdom be their guide: Let Thine
 arm strengthen them: let truth and jus-
 tice, holiness and righteousness, peace
 and charity, abound in their days.
 Finally, we commend the soul of Thy
 servant, the' late beloved Chaplain, into
 Thy hands, thanking Thee for his life
 of devoted service, and we seek Thy favor
 in the words which Thou didst Thyself
 teach us to pray saying:   Our Father
 which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy
 name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
 done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us
 this day our daily bread.  And forgive
 its our trespasses, as we forgive those
 svho trespass against us.  And lead us
 sot into temptation, but deliver us from
 evil; for Thine is the kingdom, and the
 cower, and the glory, forever.  Amen.

 The Journal of the proceedings of
 Chursday, February 24, 1966, was read

 MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
 A message in writing from the Presc-
 lent of the United States was communi-
 ;ated to the House by Mr. Geisler, one
 Af his secretaries.'
 MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE
 A message from the Senate, by Mr.
 Arrington, one of its clerks, announced
 that the Senate agrees to the amend-
 ments of the House to bills and a joint
 resolution of the Senate of the following
 titles:
 S. 577. An act for the relief of Mary F.
 Morse;
 S. 851. An act for the relief of M. Sgt. Ber-
 nard L. LaMountain, U.S. Air Force (retired) ;
 S. 1520. An act for the relief of Mr. and
 Mrs. Earl Harwell Hogan; and
 S.J. Res. 9. Joint resolution to cancel any
 unpaid reimbursable construction costs of
 the Wind River Indian irrigation project,
 Wyoming, chargeable against certain non-
 Indian lands.
 The message also announced that the
 Senate insists upon its amendments to
 the bill (H.R. 6845) entitled "An act to
 correct inequities with respect to the
 basic compensation of teachers and
 teaching positions under the Defense De-
 partment Overseas Teachers Pay and
 Personnel Practices Act," disagreed to by
 the House; agrees to the conference
 asked by the House on the disagreeing
 votes of the two Houses thereon, and ap-
 points Mr. MONRONEY, Mr. YARBOROUGH,
 Mr. RANDOLPH, Mr. CARLSON,  and Mr.
 FONG to be the col4ferees on the part of
 THE TIME FOR TALKING IS OVER
 (Mr. SIKES asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1
 minute, to revise and extend his re-
 marks, and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. SIKES.  Mr. Speaker, there con-
 tinues to be probing of our reason for
 being in Vietnam and a search for some
 happy solution to the war itself., Most of
 this is wasted energy.  It is a time for
 united action and a drive for victory. I
 am more and more strongly convinced
 that the uncertainty regarding the Viet-
 namese war which weighs upon the
 American people would in large measure
 be dispersed if the President were to call
 repeatedly for patriotic support for our
 fighting men from all levels on the home
 front. The time for talking is over; it is
 time for action. We are in a war; argu-
 ment and dissension will not win it.
 These provide only comfort to the enemy.
 The American people have always re-
 sponded to crisis and to emergency. Now
 No. 35
 is the time to remind them of this Na-
 tion's great mission and of the essential-
 ity of victory. Regardless of the reason
 we are in Vietnam, we are there and we
 must win.
 JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE OF
 THE COMMITTEE  ON BANKING
 AND CURRENCY
 Mr. PATMAN.  Mr. Speaker, I ask
 unanimous consent that the Joint Eco-
 nomic Committee be granted an exten-
 sion of time from March 1, 1966, to
 March 17, 1966, to file a report of its
 findings and recommendations with re-
 spect to the Economic Report of the Pres-
 ident, as required by section 5(b) (3) of
 Public Law 304, 79th Congress.
 The SPEAKER.  Is there objection to
 the  request of the gentleman from
 Texas?
 There was no objection.
 CAPE LOOKOUT
 Mr. ASPINALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask
 unanimous consent to take from the
 Speaker's desk the bill (S. 251) to provide
 for the establishment of the Cape Look-
 out National Seashore in the State of
 North Carolina, and for other purposes,
 with a Senate amendment to the House
 amendment thereto, and concur in the
 Senate amendment.
 The Clerk read the title of the bill.
 The Clerk read the Senate amendment
 to the House amendment, as follows:
 Page 2, line 23, of the House engrossed
 amendment,  after  "Banks." Insert:  "Land
 donated by the State of North Carolina pur-
 suant to this subsection shall constitute con-
 sideration for the transfer by the United
 States of 1.5 acres of land that is to be used
 as a site for a public health facility in the
 village  of  Hatteras,  Dare  County,  North
 Carolina.."
 The SPEAKER.          Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from Colo-
 rado?
 There was no objection.
 The Senate amendment to the House
 amendment was concurred in.
 A motion to reconsider was laid on the
 table.

 ~RESSIONAL RECORD .-HOUSE        February 28, 1966
 (Mr. ASPINALL asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD.)
 Mr.  ASPINALL.  Mr.  Speaker,  the
 amendment which the Senate has adopt-
 ed to the House amendment to the Cape
 Lookout bill, S. 251, is acceptable to the
 Supporters  of the legislation and the
 members of the House committee. All
 this amendment does is to make clear
 that the transfer of the 16,000 acres of
 land to the United States which the
 State of North Carolina is making will
 stand as consideration for the 11/2 acres
 which the United States last year trans-
 ferred to the State of North Carolina
 under another act of Congress.
 The two figures-16,000 and 11/2-are
 out of all proportion to each other, but
 as long as the State is willing to accept
