C=S7IA:1 SCIENCE :4QNITDR 
2 9 FED 1972 
Mr. Nixon and Taiwan 
President Nixon's political critics were 
bound to look for something to criticize 
in, the communiqu?rom the China trip 
and have correctly seized upon the Tai-
wan part as being the most promising. It 
is the only place where Mr. Nixon prom-
ises to do a specific thing which, at first 
blush, sounds new and different. 
But it is doubtfethit the critics (mostly 
Democrats and right-of-Nixon Republi-
cans) will get much mileage out of Tai-
wan because what Mr. Nixon agreed to 
do in the communiqu?s what he was 
in the process of doing anyway. 
Taiwan has long since ceased to be an 
important American military base. In fact, 
it never was. The total number of Ameri-
can troops there now is given as 9,990 ? 
which isn't very much as such matters go. 
And 5,000 of these belong to the 374 Tac-
tical Airlift Wing which was moved to 
Taiwan at the beginning of the big build-
up in Vietnam and will automatically be 
moved away when the big withdrawal 
from Vietnam is completed. 
The run down from over half a million 
Americans in Vietnam to the residual 
force to be left behind (somewhere around 
30,000 men) should be completed by mid-
summer; certainly well before election 
day in November. By that time the flow 
of men and materiel to Vietnam will be 
down to A normal replenishment basis. It 
could be down to zero if the China trip 
should happen to produce a negotiated 
end to the war (which is possible). 
So by the end of this year the number 
of Americans based on Taiwan would be 
down to 5,000 men even if there had been 
no trip to China; and most of those belong / 
to the American Military Aid Group. 
At one time there was a large CIA es-
tablishment on Taiwan. But that belonged 
to the days when John Foster Dulles was 
talking about "roll back" of the "bamboo 
durtain," and when some Washingtonians 
seriously thought of a return of Chiang 
Kai-shek's armies to the mainland. But all 
of that is long since finished. 
The promise in the communiqu?s to 
, ?reduce American forces and military in-
stallations "as the tension in the area 
diminishes." This is nothing new. 
There is also a declaration of "ultimate 
withdrawal" of all American forces. But 
that, too, has been standard American ppl-
icy for 20 years. It sounds new. It isn't. 
And besides, how long is "ultimate"? 
Henry Kissinger, in his official briefing 
to correspondents, asserted that the Amer-
ican security treaty with Tail,7.1n continues 
in force. So long as it does nothing is 
changed. Washington still guarantees the 
military security of Taiwan. 
The only thing really new in the com-
muniqu?s that Mr. Nixon has reaffirmed 
standing American policy in a joint com-
munique with the Chinese from China. 
Thus the emphasis is changed, a little. 
The overtone is one of more concern for 
Chou En-lai than for Chiang Kai-shek. 
But Mr. Nixon can claim, correctly, that 
he has given away nothing new.

!Suggestion on Taiwan 
Since President Nixon has failed in the Two 
China policy at the UN, I would suggest an 
t alternative. Give generous financial support / 
through the CIA to the Taiwanese who are " 
attempting touverthrow their present govern-
ment, the Republic of China, in order to es-
tablish an independent Republic of Taiwan. 
Since, according to the Pentagon Papers, 
when Diem became useless in Vietnam be-
cause of his wide-spread unpopularity, the 
' overthrow of his regime was easily accom-
plished with covert Washington support, sim-
ilar support in Taiwan might also be success-
ful.

does not have the "good guy" image it

*Any radical parsonage or

is one of the '')s.t unrealis-

..says that Formosa is part of 
her "sacred territory' 
doesn't make it so. Mao,

about some ArnMcans, one,

Self-determination, can-

In the meanwhile, voices have begun to be heard in Congress

in the Congressional Record a long paper entitled "Political Re-

surrender the fate of Formosa to the Chinese... it is clear that 
the most important contribution the U.S. can make is its support 
of the morally right position?self-determination. The people. of 
Taiwan are capable of directing their own affairs." 
On Feb. 2, 1971, a group of 10 influential Congressmen, led 
by Jacob Javits of New York, introduced a resolution in the 
Senate urging the U.S. to drop its opposition to People's China 
admission to the UN. The resolution specified Nationalist China 
should not be expelled from the UN to make room for Peking. 
This is exactly the line the U.S. is following in the UN now. 
However, Sen. Javits also proposed that the people of Taiwan in 
an "internationally supervised plebiscite determine, at a suitable 
time, what they wish to be the permanent status of Taiwan in the 
community of nations." This is what the "Taiwanese Indepen-
dence Movement" has been requesting for years. 
- It seems quite evident that Nixon considers the "one-China-
one-Taiwan" scheme the best solution from the U.S. point of 
view. Just as the U.S. stalled for time at the 1954 Geneva Con-
ference while actively preparing to set up a puppet government in 
South Vietnam, Nixon's forthcoming trip to Peking and the half-
hearted peddling of the two-Chinas policy in the UN may be just 
a smoke screen under which a made-in-U.S.A. "Republic of 
Taiwan" is being manufactured. 
The idea of an "independent" Taiwan at this point in history 
is a charade to cover up continuing U.S. (and to .a large exten,t, 
Japanese) economic domination of the island and to retain 
Taiwan as a U.S.' military base a stone's throw from mainland 
China. The Peking government, of course, has repeatedly warned 
Washington that the "one China, one Taiwan" scheme is just as-
unacceptable as the "two China's" policy and there is little possi-
bility its position will change,

in this region just south of the 
Chinese province with the roman-
tic name of Yunnan, or "Cloudy

Yunnan Anti-Communis.t. and Na-

they are the biggest opium deal-

have been financed and armed

In* Laos. the CIA organized,

as everybody except the ordinary

is headquarters for the CIA's vast 
air operations in Asia. The CIA 
base is at Tainan and is run by. 
a front organization called Air 
Asia, which also has an office in 
downtown Taipeh. Air Asia in 
turn is a subsidiary of Air Ame-
rica, the CIA line which provides 
all supply and transport runs for 
CIA operations in 'Laos, Burma, 
Thailand. Vietnam and Cambodia. 
Air America has its offices in 
Okinawa; it is a Delaware corpo-
ration with about 4,000 employees 
listed on its records as working 
in Asia. - 
The CIA base at Tainan, in 
southwest Taiwan. was the launch-

against the Chinese mainland, in-
cluding parachute drops and re-

well known- to everybody except 
the American people.

areas, and 'neither has the U.S. 
government. The Chinese side has 
been completely silent about.them

Fought, vilified, snubbed during the 22 years it has been sovereign, 
the Peoples Republic of China now takes note of the President's de-
sire to talk and states that he will be ,welcome in Peking. It is a high-
risk journey and those who want peace will wish him well. They will 
also keep their fingers crossed. The .procedural arrangements alone 
are tricky: who cart recall when a head of state visited another state 
that he did .not formally recognize? Protocol covers such small 
but symbolic items as 'whit flags will fly, in what position, and 
where; arrival and departure ceremonies; .press and personnel pri-
vileges; security arrangements; the question of joint or separate 
communiques and the language they entail. Transportation may be. 
thorny. Presumably the head of state has his own plane, and the 
intelligence implications of this are apparent to both parties. This is ? 
true also for communications facilities during the President's visit. 
In short, what is dismissed- casually as -"technical" consumes a great . 
. ?amoura of time and may cause trouble ? if either side at any point 
? chooses to use "procedural" questions for that purpose. 
The main item on the agenda is of course Taiwan. Here the Presi-
dent is in the position of a man wanting to hurdle a fence while *keep-
ing one foot, or at least one toe; in place. He ?would be faithful, in 
his fashion, ? to an Old Friend, while courting the Old Friend's 
enemy. Chiang has doubtless been informed that the United States 
will no longer resist Peking's claim to the Security Council seat in 
the United Nations. But if Chiang insists (and would he not?), the 
US ???ill try io make the expulsion of Nationalist China from the 
General* Assembly an "important question," thereby requiring a . 
two-thirds ASSernbly vote. It is reasonable to assume that an agree-
ment with Peking to disagree on this issue has already been reached, 
and that the trip was deemed sufficiently worthwhile- by both sides 
to warrant separate positions, at least for the coming UN vote. It 
-amounts to Mr. ?Nixon's telling the Chinese what he will do and. the 
-Chinese agreeing that this will not upset the visit, although they op-
pose his doing it. Then comes the hard part. 
Chou En-lai's position has been consistent since the mid-fifties: 
Peking's relations with. Chiang Kai-shek are Peking's business; 
the American presence on Taiwan is an international question on 
objective, at a Minimum, is the removal of all US mili-
tary presence, materiel and personnel from the islands 
under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, including the offshore 
islands. Next in order of importance to Peking is ces-
sation of all clandestine operations directed against the 
mainland from Chinese-Nationalist bases with US as-
sistance, whether mounted in this area or elsewhere. 
Third, less burning, is an end to intelligence collection 
(reconnaissance flights, infiltration teams). Fourth, 
and perhaps not:foreseen by Peking as ach:evable in 
this round of talks, is US renunciation of its mutual 
defense agreement with the Nationalist Chinese. Final-

N4tiona ist Chinese Unease 
Repression in .Taiwan 
Taipei 
.The Nationalist Chinese government, made up for the 
most part of the two million Mainlanders who moved 
here in 1948 and 1949, rides uneasily 'on the backs of 
the ? 12 million native Taiwanese, whose ancestors 
emigrated from the Mainland in the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries. The reassertion of the National-
ists' political authority after 50 years of Japanese 
occupation that ended with World War II was sealed 
with the execution in March 1947, of some 10,000 
Taiwanese business and intellectual leaders by newly 
arrived Mainland troops. Though discussion of it is 
forcibly repressed, the schism remains. 
The Taiwanese uprising of February 28, 1947, 
which inspired the brutal repression, was in protest 
against the heavy-handedness of the occupying Na-
tionalist .forces and the appropriation of jobs and 
property by the newly arrived Mainlanders. Little has 
changed in 22 years. Only death has any significant 
effect on .this gerontocracy. Taiwanese are almost 
completely shut out of jobs in the National govern-
ment; all police chiefs and most officers in the armed 
forces are Mainlanders or their descendants born here; 
40 percent of positions in the provincial and local 
governments are held by Mainlanders, and their 
children are 29 percent of the college and university 
students, though they make up only 13 percent of the 
civilian population. Economic growth has reduced 
this imbalance (Taiwan now enjoys a standard of 
? living second only to Japan's in Asia), but it is a 
rare Taiwanese who has anything good to say about 
the government in private. 
Should the almost unbroken economic improvement 
of. the last 15 years begin to falter, only their mo-
? nopoly of armed power would stand between the Main-
landers and the Taiwanese majority. Always acutely 
conscious of this fact, the government has built a 
large and extensive network of political police and 
informers. Anything remotely connected with political 
dissent that goes beyond nit-picking is suppressed, 
including scenes of a political demonstration in the 
Jack Lemmon comedy, "The Out-of-Towners," 
and the entry for "Mao Tse-tung" in the English-
language dictionaries pirated tie're in great abundance. 
(The government has never signed the -international 
copyright convention.) Reasoning that the "tem-
porary retreat" to Taiwan constitues an emergency, 
the government retains martial law. "Spreading 
rumors" is punishable by a 'term of from seven 
years to life. The controlled newspapers used to pub-
lish news of arrests for "anti-government" activ-
ities, but this practice has ceased; informal channels 
have had to take over. It was estimated late last year 
Approved For Release 2001/03/04 
that there are some 4,000 po Aka prisoners inTai-
wan's jails. The vast majority of these are Taiwanese. 
Writers, teachers, and intellectuals are among the 
? most prominent recent victims of the security forces. 
Po Yang, a leading novelist and essayist, was sen-
tenced in a secret military trial in the fall of 1969' to 
12 years in prison; his crime: attending a Communist 
spy school in 'Manchuria for two days 20 years earlier 
and trying (unsuccessfully) to persuade a friend to 
remain behind on the Mainland rather than flee to 
Taiwan. Last fall several writers' on the .Central Daily 
News, the newspaper of the ruling Nationalist Party 
were rounded up, along with a vice president of the 
leading broadcasting company. In April, another of 
the island's leading writer's, Li Ao, was arrested in 
a sweep that also gathered in Meng Hsiang-ko, a 
translator of Hesse's works into Chinese; Ts-'ai 
Mao-t'ang, a scholar and teacher at the American-run 
Stanford Language Center; and perhaps a dozen 
others. One reliable estimate is that 65 such suspects 
were picked up in February and March alone. 
? The -political prisoner here is held incommunicado 
for months. Nothing appears in the newspapers about 
arrests, charges, or sentences. Chinese officials con-
tend that the torture and beatings used, in the past 
have been abandoned, but in the rare case that is tried 
publicly witnesses are likely to hear the defendant 
repudiate his "confession" on the grbunds that 
it was extracted only after long and uninterrupted 
questioning. The right to cross-examine is denied. Like 
their brothers on the Mainland, the government pro-
vides a kind of thought-reform for its most tractable 
dissidents; officials consider a three-year sentence to 
one of the minimum-security thought-reform prisons 
' a merciful outcome for the defendant, even where the 
offense is negligible. Given the ugly reputation of 
other prisons here, they may be right. 
An American missionary and his wife were expelled 
in March for alleged involvement with the Taiwanese 
Independence Movement, which is active in Japan and 
the United States but rarely surfaces here. Within the 
last few. months the American Armed Forces have 
quietly shipped out several military men at the behest 
of the Chinese authorities, for the same' reason. Tai-
wanese and Mainlander alike believe that the escape 
from hot-Ise arrest here of ..the Taiwanese professor 
.P'eng Ming-min, who is now in Michigan, was engi-
neered by the CIA.cry 
. . 
?  
The government has argued that it is in the interest 
of the US to help suppress the Taiwanese, on the 
theory that an independent Taiwan would be sympa-
thetic to the Mainland. This assertion has found a less 
sympathetic hearing on the US side in recent months, 
especially since the mild flirtation between the US 
and the People's Republic of China. It is conceivable 
that a Taiwanese-run government with 
province or semi-autonomous region of the People's 
Republic might serve the US and the Mainland as a

Chiang Nai-shek at age 83

Chiang fled to Taiwan in

That the two operations were scrubbed 
of course made a considerable differ-
ence to Presidents Chiang and Rhee?
not to mention the course of history. 
But scrubbed on completed, the -principle 
remains the S2,Me.- The Central Intelli-
gence Agency, a secret arm of . the 
American government, had taken on it-
self life and death decisions which in-
volved the integrity of this nation and 
which could have gnerated results 
tonching on war or peace in the world. 
CIA, moreover, had. embarked on ac-
tions which went far-beyond the all-too-
liberal license it had been given by the 
Congress in authorizing the agency. And 
that has been CIA's way in less grisly 
areas of its endeavor. It compromised 
the freedom- of the press in the '50s by 
iring newspapermen as "consultants," 
thereby sealing lips and silencing cri-
ticism. Whether or not this practice has 
continued is anybody's guess, ?

WIRETAPPING IS IS ON THE UPSWING in Asia. 
Taiwan and South Korea have joined Hong Kong and Japan in extensive  
utilization of electronic eavesdropping. 
Most of the bugging is to nab tax evaders, wheeler-dealers, drug 
king-pins. 
But a lot of the snooping is done for political motives. 
Especially in Taiwan. 
Taipei's hallmark used to be simply the regular opening of mail of 
foreigners, or local nationals who corresponded with foreigners. 
That old-fashioned tactic is still used extensively in Indonesia, 
Thailand and Burma. 
Taiwan "graduated" to electronic eavesdropping recently. 
Now .virtuall ever forei ner on the island has his tele hone ta 
DO 
ed! 
Wiretapping evidence was responsible for the recent expulsion of several 
American military and intelligence operatives. 
Japan's snooping is rnay for economic and commercial reasons. 
Several of the largest---and most respected---Japanese firms hire 
private detective agencies to snoop, on foreign competitors operating inside 
Japan. 
Corporate espionage is big business in Japan---snooping on foreigners 
is only slightly more comprehensive than Japanese commercial firms' snooping 
on each other. 
South Korea's Central Intelli ence A enc is the No. 1 b in outfit 
in that country. 
The operations have the tacit approval of new Premier KIM CHONG-PIL. 
Hong Kong has probably used sophisticated wiretapping methods longer 
than any Asia locale. 
The standing joke among Hong Kong police officers is that the reasons 
for entry visa restrictions is that "if we tap one more phone thp bloody 
island will sink into the sea from the sheer weight of all the electronic bugs." 
Lately, Hong Kong authorities have begun to tap the phones of certain

"SECOND BETRAYAL"

?.-0:?eeiV here since February 
teaching in three different uni-
versities, is planning a new 
book which he will call "The 
Second . Betrayal of China." 
On June 15 President Chiang 
Kai-shek said, "During the 
:last five months we have ex-. 
perienced a sequence of ad-
? versity, insult and suffering." 
. All evidence points to a

s-anguinary "People's Repub-

eligible to become a member 
of the "peace-loving" council

W hat these planners are 
trying to accomplish a s a com-

even by resolution, is to ad-
mit the government hove, not 
as the "Republic of China' 
but a s "Taiwan". - 
?CIA FABRICATION 
But since this would mean ? 
the 'admission of a new 
member, it would be vetoable 
by either the Soviet Union or 
the newly admitted Red China. 
In other words,,,."Taiwan's" 
admission would be dependent 
on the consent of the Com-
munists. Already, as if to 
curry Mao's favor for the 
eventuality, the evidence 
points to the CIA fabricating 
an inde.dendent Taiwanese' 
movement on the island. There 
is no such thing here -eicept 
as it is imported from the ' 
United States.

IVashington: Bureau of The Sun 
Washington, June 3.---The Unit-
ed States takes "no position" on 
the question of self-determina-
tion for about 12 million native 
Taiwanese., the predominant 
majority of the population on 
Taiwan, according to a State 
Department spokesman. 
. Mr. Charles Bray, the spokes-
man, explained that this was a 
matter of "internal concern" to 
the government of .the Republic 
of China. 
The question was raised after 
Mr. Bray confirmed that four 
U.S. servicemen had been trans-
ferred because of Chinese com7 
plaints that they had acted syin 
pathetically with Taiwan inde-
pendence "elements" by send-
ing and receiving mail for them. 
Last week, the State Depart-
ment had "no comment" when 
asked to compare the American 
position on self-determination 
for the Taiwanese as opposed to 
the South Vietnamese. 
. Self-determination for South 
Vietnamese is, as President Nix-
on said in his State-of-the-World 
report the "one guiding princi-
ple, one irreducible objective" 
of American goals for the Indo-
china war. "We seek," he said, 
"the opportunity for the South 
Vietnamese people to determine 
their own political future with-
out outside interference." 
Taiwan independence move-
ments, which seek varying de-
grees cir autonomy from the Na-
tionalist government in Taipei 
Or the Chinese Communist gov-
ernment in Peking, have been 
suppressed harshly on Taiwan. 
? They also have been denounced 
? by. the Communists. ? . 
Immigrants' Descendants ? 
. The .Taiwanese are descen-
dants of immigrants from Fu-
kien province several centuries 
ago. They speak a Fukienese 
dialect which differs from Man-
darin, which is spoken by the 1.5 
million "mainlanders" who 
? came to the island after military 
- defeat by the Communists. 
Because of long separation, 
many Taiwanese consider them-
selves a distinct people. Though 
they form a majority en Taiwan 
itself, political control of the. 
government remains in the 
hands of the mainlanders. Effec-
tive power is wielded by the 
Legislative Yuan elected in 
mainland districts in 1947 and 
1949 with Taiwanese representa-
tion restricted to roughly the 
proportion of its population to 
that of all China. 
' Local Issues 
The independence movement 
flourishes outside of Taiwan, in 
student, intellectual and other 
exile circles in the United States 
and Japan. Approximately 90 
per cent of students leaving Tai-
wan never return. 
Inside Taiwan, politics is re-
stricted to local issues and elec-
tions. Taiwanese form a majori-
ty of the. Nationalist Army, 
(though not its officer corps) 
and also have shared in the is-
lands economic prosperity. It is 
conceded that in time, their 
views will have to be taken into 
account en such natienal issues 
as the government's fate. 
Politically conservative, the 
Taiwanese have few leftist ele-
ments. Those who speak out op-
pose rule by "mainlanders," 
whether they be Communist or 
Nationalist. They differ in want-; 
ing either eventual complete in-
dependence or some autono-
mous status with China, perhaps 
in a commonwealth affiliation. 
For the United States, the 
question of Taiwanese aspira-
tions has been 'a difficult and 
sensitive 'question because of its 
alliance with the Nationalists 
who form the government of 
the Republic of China. 
The State Department version 
of the case of the four trans-
ferred American servicemen

pei accounts. The Nationalist

U.S. TRANSFERS 6 
IN TAIWAN UNREST 
Men Said to Be Accused of 
Aidincr Dissidents 
Special to The New York Times 
TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 31 ? 
The United States has trans-
ferred four or more military 
men and a junior officer of the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
from Taiwan in the last month, 
reportedly after Chinese Na-
tionalist officials accused them 
of assisting native Taiwanese in 
'plotting anti-Government activ-
ities. 
The Nationalists, according 
to reliable sources, charged 
that the men had given tech-
nical advice to dissidents on 
the use of explosives and on 
ways to generate international 
publicity favorable to their 
cause. The Americans were also 
said to have used their mili-
tary postal privileges to help the 
Taiwanese communicate with 
colleagues abroad. 
In its protest to United States 
diplomatic and military author-
ities just over a month ago, the 
Ministry of Defense reportedly 
included detailed evidence ac-
cumulated by Chinese security 
agents by close surveillance of 
the men over a long period. 
The tranSferred Americans 
include a physician at the Navy 
Hospital here, an enlisted man 
in a psychological warfare de-
tachment, an officer in the Mil-
itary Assistance Advisory Group 
V" and a civilian official in the 
Army Technical Group, the cov-
er name for the sizable Central 
Intelligence Agency detachment 
here. 
. . . 
Agent Defends Action 
. American sources said the in-
telligence agent had asserted 
:that he was simply trying, with-
out orders, to broaden his con-
pets among the Taiwanese: 
The Chinese security agencies 
'are understood to be investi-
gating several other United 
States military men who left 
;Taiwan some time ago under 
routine reassignment. 
Both the United States and 
.the Chinese Governments are 
said to regard the case as a 
;source of embarrassment that 
they had hoped would not be-
:come a matter of public discus-
sion. 
For that reason, it was said, 
the American authorities ar-
ranged for the quiet transfer of 
The men, who were ordered not 
to discuss the affair with any-
one. The United States Embas-
sy has refused to comment oni 
the case. 
, The embarrassment for thel 
Nationalist Government stems 
largely from its reluctance to 
admit that there are any active 
supporters of the concept of 
"Taiwanese independence" on 
the island. 
The dissidents said to be 
involved in the case are be-
lieved to be proponents of in-
dependence from any govern-
ment of China, either Commu-
nist or Nationalist, on the' 
ground that the 12 million Tai-
wanese have their own inter-
ests and historical identity. 
Organizations advocating inde-
pendence operate abroad among 
Taiwanese students and exiles 
but are outlawed in Taiwan. 
American officials here, who 
have been trying to assure the 
Nationalists that United States 
support for their Government 
will not diminish as a result 
of Washington's efforts to ease 
tensions with Peking, appear to 
be even more upset than the 
Chinese over the case. 
C.I.A. Activity Denied 
They have already had a dif-
ficult time convincing some Na-
tionalists that rumors of finan-
cial backing by the C.I.A. for 
the Taiwan independence move-
ment were unfounded. Reports 
that the American intelligence 
agency arranged the escape 
from Taiwan of Prof. Peng Ming 
Min, an independence leader, 
have also gained wide credence 
here. 
In an effort to prevent 
further such incidents, Vice 
Mm. Walter H. Baumberger, 
head of the United States' 
Taiwan Defense Command, re-
portedly has ordered com-
manders of American units 
here to warn their men to 
steer clear of domestic political 
activity. 
A large number of suspected 
anti-Government activists ? as 
many as 65, according to some 
reports?have been arrested in 
the last three months in what 
may be a reaction by the Gov-
ernment to recent setbacks af-
fecting Taiwan's international 
position. In recent months the 
Government has also expelled 
an American missionary couple 
and arrested several Japanese 
tourists for allegedly having 
aided Taiwanese dissidents.

Americans - 
Transferred 
In Taiwan 
TAIPEI, May 31 (AP)?At 
least five American officials 
and perhaps more have been 
transferred from Taiwan after 
the Nationalist Chinese gov-
ernment charged they were 
aiding the outlawed Taiwan 
independence movement, In-
formed sources said today. 
Newsmen confirmed five 
transfers: two Army men, two 
Navy officers, and a civilian 
employee of the U.S. Army 
Technical Group, and organi-
zation of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. 
Some sources said three 
more persons were trans-
ferred, and others said there 
were even more. 
[Officials at the State De-
partment and Pentagon said 
they had no knowledge of the 
incident.] 
Nationalist officials pro-
vided U.S. diplomatic and mili-
tary representatives with what 
the Nationalists considered 
was proof of antigovernment 
activity, including an attempt 
to visit persons convicted of 
political crimes and providing 
advice in the preparation and 
use of explosives, the sources 
said. 
They said some of those' 
transferred were cooperating 
with each other in these activi-
ties while others were working 
alone. Some of the men admit-
ted that their activities were 
antigovernment; others denied 
any such intention, sources 
said. 
But all reportedly said they 
were acting without any kind 
of official U.S. approval. 
. American '? officials refused 
to discuss the transfers, but it, 
was believed the men faced no 
disciplinary action and U.S. 
military commanders have is--
sued an order to all units in . 
Taiwan prohibiting involve-
ment in local politics, sources 
said. 
Names of the men trans-
ferred were not available, nor 
was it known where they were 
transferred to. Their activities' 
were believed to have been 
uncovered during interroga-
tion of antigovernment .

Air erica: 
Flying the U.S. into L 
had begun in Laos in 1959; moreover, it appears that President 
Eisenhower was not informed and did not know when his 
office and authority were being committed in the Laotian , 
conflict, just as Nixon did not know of the intrigue of Mme. 
Chennault. But that is precisely the point of parapolitics and 
private war enterprise. ? , 
In its evasion of Congressional and even Executive controls . 
over military commitments in Laps and elsewhere, the CIA 
has long relied on the services of General Chennault's "pri-
vate" paramilitary arm, Civil Air Transport or (as it is now 
known) Air America, Inc. 
[How AIR AMERICA WAGES WAR] 
IR AMERICA'S FLEETS OF TRANSPORT planes are readily 
seen in the airports of Laos, South Viet-Nam, Thai-
land and Taiwan. The company is based in Taiwan, 
where a subsidiary firm, Air Asia, with some 8000 
employees, runs one of the world's largest aircraft maintenance 
and repair facilities. While not all of Air America's operations 
are paramilitary or even covert, in Viet-Nam and even more 
in Laos, it is the chief airline serving the CIA in its clandestine 
war activities. 
Until recently the largest of these operations was the supply 
of the fortified hilltop positions of the 45,000 Meo tribesmen ? ? 
? fighting against the Pathet Lao behind their lines in northeast , 
"6 
Laos. Most of these Meo outposts have airstrips that will ?? - ,. ? 
, 
. accommodate special Short Take-off And Landing aircraft, but ? 
? 
because of the danger of enemy fire the American and Na-
tionalist Chinese crews have usually relied on parachute drops 
of guns, mortars, ammunition, rice, even live chickens and , 
pigs. Air America's planes also serve to transport the Meos' 
main cash crop, opium. 
The Mc? units, originally organized and trained by the 
French, have provided a good indigenous army for, the Amer- ? 
41'1. 
jeans in Laos. Together with their CIA and U.S. Special

N THE CLOSING DAYS OF THE 1968 presidential campaign, 
the Democrats made an eleventh-hour bid for the 
presidency through a White House announcement that 
all bombing in North Viet-Nam was being stopped and 
that serious peace negotiations were about to begin. This 
move was apparently torpedoed within 30 hours by President 
Thieu of South Viet-Nam who publicly rejected the coming 
negotiations. Three days later, the Democratic candidate lost 
to Richard Nixon by a narrow margin. 
After the election, it was revealed that a major Nixon fund 
raiser and supporter had engaged in elaborate machinations 
in Saigon (including false assurances that Nixon would not 
enter into such negotiations if elected) to sabotage the Demo-
crats' plan. It was also revealed that, through wire taps, the 
White House and Humphrey knew of these maneuvers before 
the election and that a heated debate had gone on among 
Humphrey strategists as to whether the candidate should 
exploit the discovery in the last moments of the campaign. 
Humphrey declined to seize the opportunity, he said, because 
he was sure that Nixon was unaware of and did not approve 
of the activities of his supporter in Saigon. 
The supporter in question was Madame Anna Chennault, 
and her covert intervention into the highest affairs of state 
was by no means an unprecedented act for her and her associ-
ates. Madame Chennault's husband, General Claire Chennault, 
had fought in China with Chiang Kai-shek; after the war he 
ormed a private airline company. Both husband and wife 
have, through their involvement with the China Lobby and , 
the CIA's complex of private corporations, played a profound 
.role throughout our involvement in Southeast Asia. General 
Chennault's airline was, for example, employed by the U.S. 
government in 1954 to fly in support for the French at Dien 
Bien Phu. It was also a key factor in the new fighting wh'
