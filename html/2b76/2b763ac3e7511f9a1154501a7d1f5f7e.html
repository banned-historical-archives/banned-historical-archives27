 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 November 1957
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS .  .         .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The beginning of Turkish military maneuvers on 11 No-
 vember has resulted in renewed Syrian propaganda charges
 that a Turkish attack is imminent.    The Syrian charges ap-
 pear designed primarily for internal political purposes.
 The Turks are expected to withdraw some of the forces not
 regularly assigned to the Syrian border area on comple-
 tion of the maneuvers, but these probably could be re-
 turned quickly.   In Jordan, the Egyptian and Syrian cam-
 paign against King Hussayn may mark an all-out effort to
 bring down the King and his pro-Western government.
 ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SHAK" NEW FRENCH GOVERNMENT   .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 2
 Rightist opposition to Premier Gaillard's proposed
 tax increases has raised a serious threat to his ten-day-
 old coalition.  Even if he obtains National Assembly ap-
 proval this week end for his request for sweeping econom-
 ic powers, the prospect of labor pressure for wage hikes
 and the revival of basic policy differences within his
 cabinet make its life expectancy doubtful.
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 INDONESIA   .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  .  Page 1
 Djakarta's anti-Dutch drive claiming Netherlands New
 Guinea has had no apparent effect on official Dutch policy.
 The Netherlands not only will refuse to negotiate Indone-
 sia's claim but also appears willing to accept the loss of
 Dutch commercial interests in Indonesia should Djakarta
 seize them.  Meanwhile the Communists have won a substan-
 tial plurality in the 7 November local elections in the
 sultanate of Jogjakarta, thereby continuing their elec-
 toral gains in earlier contests in Java.   Indonesia's
 second national conference, which will make a further
 effort to return the non-Javanese areas to direct Dja-
 karta control, is scheduled to convene on 25 November
 under the joint chairmanship of President Sukarno and
 former Vice President Hatta.

 PART II (continued)
 SITUATION IN LAOS   .  .    .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . . .  Page 1
 Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma hopes to present
 a coalition government for investiture on 16 or 17
 November.  He will propose a cabinet headed by him-
 self in' which his half-brother Prince Souphannouvong,
 the chief Pathet  negotiator, will have charge of im-
 plementing the government's agreement with the Pathet
 Lao.  The transformation of the Pathet Lao into a po-
 litical party and its participation in the government
 will enhance its influence as well as its ability to
 carry on subversive activities throughout the whole
 country.
 PHILIPPINE ELECTIONS .  .  .  .  .  . . .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 2
 Philippine President Carlos Garcia's election on
 12 November, the victory of pro-American vice-presi-
 dential candidate Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal
 party over Jose Laurel,.Jr., and the poor showing of
 ultranationalist Senator Claro Recto indicate that
 anti-American sentiment was not an important con-
 sideration among the voters.  Growing nationalism
 may soon come to the surface, as one of Garcia's
 first major undertakings is expected to be a review
 of US-Philippine relations, including negotiations
 for the "modernization" of the 1947 American mil-
 itary bases agreement.
 SOVIET DISARMAMENT TACTICS .  .
 Page 3
 Soviet tactics in the UN disarmament debates dur-
 ing the past two weeks have concentrated an bringing
 pressure to bear on the Western powers to enlarge the
 present UN disarmament machinery.  Despite its threat
 to boycott future talks of the present commission and
 subcommittee, the USSR will probably participate in
 further disarmament negotiations if the General Assem-
 bly adopts a compromise measure enlarging the disarma-
 ment machinery,
 PLANS FOR NATO SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page 4
 European hopes for progress at the NATO summit
 meeting of 16-18 December are centered on prospects
 for more scientific and technical cooperation, partic-
 ularly the fuller use of West German talents and fa-
 cilities and greater American participation.

 14 November 1957
 PART II (continued)
 WEST GERMAN MISSILE AND ROCKET ACTIVITIES   .  .  .  .  . . . .  Page 5
 Reflecting a growing Western European interest in
 West German participation in joint development of mod-
 ern weapons, Bonn has already requested a revision of
 the WEU treaty to permit production of an antitank mis-
 sile and has set up within the Ministry of Defense a
 research o aanization concentrating on a surface-to-air
 missile.
 KHRUSHCHEV'S ECONOMIC FORECASTS   .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . . . . .  Page 6
 The figures for future production of selected items
 mentioned by Khrushchev in his 6 November speech imply
 a moderation of the headlong pace of Soviet growth dur-
 ing the next 15 years, although he made no forecast of
 total Soviet industrial output for 1972.  The prelimi-
 nary 1957 output data given by Khrushchev seem to have
 made him conservative in his long-range forecasts.
 Khrushchev's statement on consumer goods goals indi-
 cates that pushing rapidly on all fronts simultaneously
 is apparently now an accepted regime policy.
 SOVIET ANNIVERSARY SPEECHES STRESS BLOC UNITY  .  .  .
 In his anniversary speech to the Supreme Soviet,
 Khrushchev attempted to state his policy toward the
 satellites in such a way as to circumvent the prob-
 lem posed for Soviet policy by the principle of "dif-
 ferent roads to socialism."  The views expressed on
 this occasion by party leaders from Communist China,
 Poland, and Yugoslavia on the nature of the USSR's
 relationships with bloc countries and the "different
 roads" concept underscore the difficulties Khru-
 shchev faces in the matter.

 NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA TRADE SHIPPING .  .  . .  .  .  .  . .          Page 8
 Peiping's first regularly scheduled internation-
 al shipping line will begin operations soon, using a
 new Polish-built cargo ship.  This line initially
 will provide service between Canton, Hong Kong, and
 Haiphong and may be expanded to include major South-
 east Asian ports now primarily served by free world
 vessels.  At present more than one third of China's
 trade with the non-Communist world is with South and
 Southeast Asia.  During the past two years, several
 free world nations, Australia most recently, have as-
 signed ships to newly inaugurated regular service to
 the Chinese Communist mainland.

 NEW BRIDGE EASES CHINESE COMMUNIST TRANSPORT BOTTLENECK  .  Page 10
 The two-decked rail and highway bridge over the
 Yangtze River at Wuhan is now open to traffic.  While
 the mile-long structure will not be required to handle
 its planned capacity of 120 trains a day until late in
 the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962), it has already
 served to ease the major bottleneck to north-south
 transportation.   Its completion well ahead of schedule
 was made possible through the use of-an unusual system
 of pier construction.
 PEIPING UNDERSCORES OPPOSITION TO "TWO CHINAS" CONCEPT .  .  Page 12
 Peiping's withdrawal from the International Red
 Cross Conference in New Delhi was designed to under-
 score its adamant opposition to a "two Chinas" solu-
 tion for the Taiwan problem.  Rather than participate
 with the Chinese Nationalists, Peiping has also with-
 drawn from other international events, including the
 International Geophysical Year.  Chou En-lai has
 stated that in the future, Peiping will not establish
 diplomatic relations with nations that-continue dip-
 lomatic ties with Taipei.
 ASIAN SOLIDARITY COMMITTEE PREPARES FOR CAIRO CONFERENCE .  Page 13
 The Communist-dominated, nongovernmental Afro-
 Asian Solidarity Conference, sponsored by the Asian
 Solidarity Committee, is to be held in Cairo from 26
 December to 1 January.  Preparations indicate that
 the Sino-Soviet bloc and Egyptian nationalists will
 try to define a "popular" anti-Western posture for
 Asian-African countries on subjects such as anti-im-
 perialism, national liberation, and racial discrimi-
 nat ion.
 KISHI'S SECOND ASIAN TOUR   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 14
 Japanese Prime Minister Kishi will visit seven
 Asian countries--South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, In-
 donesia, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines--
 between 18 November and 8 December.                           While his second
 tour of Asia is designed in general to promote good
 will and economic cooperation with the area, Kisbi
 will give particular attention to Japan's remaining
 reparations obligations and he will seek reactions to
 a revised scheme for an Asian development fund.

 DIEM'S VISIT TO INDIA        . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . . . . . .  .  Page 14
 South Vietnamese President Diem's visit to India
 in early November was a success in promoting cordial
 relations between the two countries despite their di-
 vergent foreign policies.                            While defending South Viet-
 nam's anti-Communist posture, Diem apparently tried
 to play down the differences between his policies and
 Indian neutralism.
 MOROCCAN PARTY SEEKS GREATER POWER . . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 15
 Morocco's Istiglal party appears to be renewing
 its drive to establish a one-party government.      It ap-
 parently has set its sights on the post of premier
 and wants to replace the King's son as chief of staff
 of the Moroccan royal army.  Heretofore the King, who
 shares his theoretically absolute power with the Isti-
 glal, has opposed a single-party system.

 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NENNI SOCIALIST PARTY  . .  .  . . . . .  Page 16
 Peitro Nenni's Italian Socialist party has de-
 cided to campaign independently in the 1958 national
 elections.  With Socialist reunification ruled out
 at least until after the elections, Nenni's evident
 hope is to hold his own party together and increase
 its popular attraction by alternating appeals to pro-
 and anti-Communist elements both inside and outside
 the party.

 COMMUNISTS EXPANDING LABOR ACTIVITY IN SOUTH AMERICA . .  .  Page 17
 A proposed expansion of activities of the Com-

 includes the establishment of an office in Chile re-
 sponsible for all South America except Venezuela and
 Colombia.  At present only three influential national
 labor confederations--in Brazil, Uruguay, and Ecuador--
 are affiliated with CTAL.  The Chilean Communist par-
 ty has trained leaders capable of giving considerable
 assistance to the confederation.                                         25X1

 MEXICO'S PROBABLE NEXT PRESIDENT . .  . .  . . . .  . .  . . .  Page 17
 Adolfo Lopez Mateos, capable minister of labor,
 is expected  to be nominated as candidate for presi-
 dent of Mexico at the 15 November convention of the
 dominant Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), vir-
 tually assuring his election in July 1958.  His out-
 standing labor mediation record has won the confidence
 of the leftist and nationalist PRI wing led by ex-
 President Cardenas and of the conservative business
 wing whose spokesman is ex-President Aleman.  Lopez
 has also received support from local Marxist groups,
 although he is not known to be sympathetic toward Com-
 munists.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA . . . .  .  Page  1
 Economic cooperation on a multinational basis is
 receiving increased attention as a promising method of
 raising living standards in South and Southeast Asia.
 Although practical achievements to date have been lim-
 ited, impetus for regional development schemes has been
 generated recently by the wide interest shown at the
 meeting in Saigon last month of the Colombo plan powers
 and by the Japanese desire to establish a regional de-
 velopment fund.  The Communist bloc may attempt to rival
 present efforts among the free nations of Asia to achieve
 greater economic cooperation by offering competing proj-
 ects of its own.
 GOMULKA' S PARTY REFORMS  .  .  .  .  . . .  . .  .  . . .  . .  .  .  Page  5
 Poland's Wladyslaw Gomulka--faced with a fragmented
 and discredited party--has launched a campaign to change
 the party's composition.    He wants to cut it down to ap-
 proximately half its size to facilitate the development
 of a united and effective group.  Gomulka believes the
 success of his policies depends on the development of
 what he calls "numanism" in party practice so that the
 party can gain some degree of confidence and loyalty from
 the Polish people.

 FRANCE'S ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS . . . .  . . . . . . . .  Page  8
 France's ability to survive cabinet crises like the
 recent 36-day interregnum between the Bourges-Maunoury
 and Gaillard governments depends largely on a well-trained
 and cohesive bureaucracy.. Continuity is maintained de-
 spite changes in government by permanent administrative
 officials who often exercise considerable influence on
 policy.
 ECONOMY OF TAIWAN  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  Page 10
 Economic conditions were favorable in Taiwan through-
 out the past year, and industry on the island continued
 its steady expansion.  If American aid is continued at
 present levels, the economy should continue to progress
 and the present level of the armed forces can be main-
 tained.  Population growth and limited agricultural re-
 sources, however, will ultimately require development of
 light industry based on export markets if economic via-
 bility is to be achieved.

 15 November, the Turks are ex-

 eight other opposition deputies
 who have fled or are under ar-
 rest.
 Ultimately, the govern-
 ment desires to promulgate a
 new election law which would
 add 15 or 20 seats to the 40-
 man legislature and ensure a
 docile parliament.
 Egyptian discussions during
 the past week with Britain,
 France, and the head of the In-
 ternational Bank reflect prog-
 ress toward settlement of some
 of the financial problems aris-
 ing out of last year's national-
 ization of the Suez Canal.   The
 Egyptians now appear willing to
 make some concessions in order
 to gain a return to normal eco-
 nomic relations.   Talks with
 the French have been resumed in
 Geneva in what has been described
 as a friendly atmosphere, and a
 British official has again ex-
 pressed optimism over the cur-
 rent economic discussions in Rome.
 In a 10 November interview
 between Nasir and IBRD President
 Black, it was agreed that the
 bank would act as a mediator be-
 tween the Egyptian government
 and the shareholders of the f or-
 mer Suez Canal Company.   Nasir
 urged Black to expedite the mat-
 ter, but remained insistent on
 the point that Egypt would deal     25X1
 only with chosen representatives
 of the shareholders and not with
 company officials.
 ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SHAKE NEW FRENCH GOVERNMENT
 Rightist opposition to
 Premier Gaillard's proposed tax
 increases has raised a serious
 threat to his ten-day-old coali-
 tion.   Even if he obtains early
 National Assembly approval of
 his request for sweeping eco-
 nomic powers,  the prospect of
 labor pressure for wage hikes
 and the revival of basic policy
 differences within his cabinet
 make its life expectancy doubt-
 ful.
 The adverse reaction of
 the right wing of Gaillard's
 cabinet to his emergency auster-
 ity program for new taxes, a
 price freeze, and stringent
 disciplinary control over mar-
 keting activities has quickly
 underscored the shaky position
 of the new coalition.   The new
 taxes and special powers of en-
 forcement he wants are anathema
 to many supporters of the Inde-
 pendents and Peasants, who have

 indicated they may abstain in
 the National Assembly vote this
 week end on special powers to
 implement this program.
 Such a move would make it
 increasingly difficult for the
 Socialists to justify  their
 participation in the government.
 Many Socialists  doubted  the
 wisdom of backing Gaillard,and
 their leaders are fearful lest
 austerity include a wage freeze,
 which would alienate their la-
 bor  support  and  thereby
 strengthen the appeal of the
 Communists.
 The need for tight fi-
 nancial policies has received
 wider public recognition--part-
 ly as a result of the pessimis-
 tic OEEC report on French fi-
 nances--and Gaillard's position
 vis-a-vis the deputies may be
 strengthened by this develop-
 ment.   The slump in the value
 of the franc on 14 November to
 507 to the dollar (the legal
 rate is 420) may also increase
 his support in the special-pow-
 ers vote.   Moreover, his re-
 fusal to be rushed into supply-
 ing arms to Tunisia may re-es-
 SECRET
 tablish some of his  credit
 with the right.
 Even if the new government
 survives the immediate threat,
 it faces a series of extremely
 touchy problems over the next
 two months.   New labor agita-
 tion for wage increases seems
 inevitable; prices have in-
 creased again this week and
 are expected to climb further
 as the extension of devaluation
 pushes import costs upward.   In
 addition to the Communist-led
 labor union's call for a "peace-
 in-Algeria strike" on 15 Novem-
 ber, the teachers and postmen
 are going out on 19 November,
 and further widespread demon-
 strations are likely if labor
 demands are not met.
 In any event, latent left-
 right differences will come to
 the surface when pending re-
 form proposals involving the
 constitution, education, elec-
 toral laws, and medical sub-
 sidies emerge from the spe-
 cial study groups where they
 have been temporarily pigeon-
 holed.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 November 1957
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Djakarta's continuing anti-
 Dutch drive supporting its claim
 to Netherlands New Guinea has
 had no apparent effect on offi-
 cial Dutch policy.  The Nether-
 lands' government plans to con-
 tinue its refusal to negotiate
 Indonesia's claim to that area
 and is willing to sacrifice
 Dutch commercial interests in
 Indonesia should Djakarta's re-
 taliation make that necessary.
 President Sukarno has added his
 voice to those calling for the
 severance of trade relations
 with the Netherlands and the
 confiscation of all Dutch prop-
 erty in Indonesia if the area
 is not "returned" to Indonesia.
 Meanwhile, in the sultanate
 of Jogjakarta the Communist
 party has a commanding two-to-
 one lead over its closest oppo-
 nent in the 7 November local
 elections.   The major non-Com-
 munist parties--the National
 party, Masjumi, and Nahdlatul
 Ulama--follow in that order.
 A breakdown of the vote gives
 the Communists 143,000,   the
 Nationalists 72,000, the Mas-
 jumi 50,000, Gerinda--a minor
 party--41,000, and the Nahdlatul
 Ulama 35,000.   The Jogjakarta
 poll is the last of the local
 elections throughout Java, and
 the results continue Communist
 gains in the earlier Java elec-
 tions,  giving the Communist
 party a larger electoral base
 than any other political organ-
 ization in Java.
 Indonesia's second nation-
 al conference is scheduled to
 convene in Djakarta on 25 Novem-
 ber for one week with a possible
 three-day extension.   Joint
 chairmanship by President Sukar-
 no and former Vice President
 Hatta now appears likely despite
 Prime Minister Djuanda's orig-
 inal desire to give Hatta sole
 responsibility for directing
 the meeting.
 Djuanda has announced that
 working papers will be presented
 at the conference on a variety
 of subjects related to economic
 development.  Presumably this
 conference will function much
 as the September one did.  This
 will involve the division of
 the delegates into a number of
 working groups which will ap-
 prove predetermined and vague
 resolutions calling for coop-
 eration,  unity,  and social jus-
 tice.
 In addition to civil and
 military representatives of both
 the Djakarta and the provincial
 governments, the conference will
 also include representatives of
 "functional groups" and polit-
 ical parties, experts in various
 economic matters, and "pioneers
 of Indonesian independence."
 Included in the last group are
 Semaun, a leading "national
 Communist" figure, and Commu-
 nist party Secretary General
 D-. N. Aidit.
 Prime Minister Souvanna
 Phouma is planning to present
 a coalition government for in-
 vestiture on 16 November.  His
 timetable calls for the opening
 of a special session of the
 National Assembly on 15 Novem-

 Lao would formally turn over

 Souvanna in turn will propose
 for investiture a cabinet headed
 by himself in    which  Pathet
 leaders Prince Souphannouvong,
 his half-brother,  and Phoumi
 Vongvichit will head the Minis-
 tries of Reconstruction and Re-
 ligion.   In addition,                     Souphan-
 nouvong may be named minister
 of integration.   This would be
 a major concession by the royal
 government,  since he would have
 charge of implementing the gov-
 ernment's agreement with the
 Pathet Lao,   for which he was
 the chief negotiator.
 Conservative opposition to
 the present accords is rapidly
 crumbling.   Interior Minister
 Katay has on several occasions
 embarrassed Western officials
 publicly in what appears to be
 an effort to belie charges that
 he is a Western "lackey."  The
 other leading conservative poli-
 tician,  Phoui Sananikone,                   also
 seems to be preparing to re-
 treat from a position he con-
 siders politically untenable.
 Souvanna reportedly claims that
 Phoui's Independent party, Laos'
 second largest, has agreed to
 his timetable  calling for in-
 vestiture of a coalition govern-
 ment on 16 November.
 The Pathet Lao appears
 eager for a settlement on the
 present terms.   Its transforma-
 tion into a political party and
 its         participation   in the gov-
 ernment will greatly enhance
 its influence as well as its
 ability to carry on subversive
 activities throughout the whole
 country.   Souphannouvong re-
 portedly signed both the polit-
 ical and military accords on 8
 November, and the Pathets are
 preparing the centers in which
 their troops will be regrouped
 for integration or demobiliza-
 tion.   Pathet Lao soldiers re-
 portedly are surrendering daily
 to the royal government in
 groups of two and three, claim-
 ing they hope this will assure
 them better treatment than if
 they wait for integration.

 The election of Carlos
 Garcia to the Philippine presi-
 dency in the 12 November ballot-
 ing is primarily due to the ad-
 vantages he held as incumbent
 and to the well-entrenched ma-
 chinery of the Nacionalista par-
 ty.   HiE~ comfortable margin of
 victory over his nearest rival,
 Liberal candidate Jose Yulo,
 may also reflect his success in
 identifying himself with the
 foreign and domestic policies
 of his predecessor in office,
 the late Ramon Magsaysay. An-
 other factor may have been the
 election day typhoon which
 struck hardest in  opposition
 strongholds in the northern
 Philippines.
 Garcia apparently will have
 as his vice president the Liber-
 al party's Diosdado Macapagal,
 who is leading Nacionalista
 candidate Jose Laurel,  Jr.   As
 a congressman, Macapagal has
 been regarded as able, pro-
 American, and experienced in
 international affairs.   As vice
 president, however, he could
 have  little voice  in the ad-
 ministration  if denied  the
 customary appointment to a cabi-
 net post.
 In the congressional elec-
 tions, the Nacionalistas will
 retain control of both houses
 of congress.   They apparently
 are winning at least 80 of the
 102 congressional districts
 and six of the eight contested
 senatorial seats, giving them
 control of at least 20 members
 of the 24-man senate.

 fourth-place showing in the
 presidential race of ultrana-
 tionalist Senator Claro Recto
 indicate that anti-American
 sentiment played only a minor
 role in the campaign.   Growing
 nationalist sentiment may again
 be apparent when the Garcia ad-
 ministration undertakes in the
 near future to review US-Philip-
 pine relations and to resume
 negotiations for the "moderniza-
 tion" of the 1947 American mili-
 tary bases agreement.
 An uncertain force in the
 Philippine political future will
 be  the new Progressive party,
 whose standard-bearer, Manuel
 Manahan,   placed  a relative-
 ly close third in the  presi-
 dential contest.                                                                  The Progres-

 their lack  of finances  and
 an established organization
 in attempting to turn Manahan's
 considerable popularity into
 votes.  As  the effectiveness
 of  their claim to being  the
 preservers of the "spirit of
 Magsaysay"  fades, they  may
 throw  in their  lot  with
 the opposition  Liberals.
 SOVIET DISARMAMENT TACTICS
 Soviet tactics in the UN
 disarmament debates during the
 past two weeks have concentrated
 on bringing pressure to bear
 on the Western powers to enlarge
 the present UN disarmament ma-
 chinery.   Despite its threat
 to boycott future talks of the
 present commission and subcom-
 mittee, the USSR will probably
 participate in further disarma-
 ment negotiations if the General
 Assembly adopts a compromise
 measure enlarging the disarma-
 ment machinery.
 On 27 October the USSR pre-
 sented a resolution which would
 replace the present 12-power
 Disarmament Commission and its
 five-nation subcommittee with
 a permanent commission composed
 of all 82 UN member nations.
 Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznets-
 ov on 4 November threatened that
 the USSR would not take part in
 further negotiations in the com-
 mission and subcommittee "with
 their present membership," a
 qualification hinting that a
 limited expansion of the dis-
 armament machinery might be ac-
 ceptable to Moscow.   In comment-
 ing on passage of the Western
 24-nation resolution two days
 later, Kuznetsov did not repeat
 his threat of Soviet nonpartici-
 pation.
 India has consistently
 pressed for enlargement of the
 disarmament machinery, and,
 with Canada, has been active
 in working out an expansion.pro-
 posal acceptable to the West
 and the Soviet Union.  An Indian
 delegate  stated  on   12  No-
 vember that the Soviet delega-
 tion does not favor enlargement
 of the subcommittee "at present,"
 a hint apparently designed to
 help gain Western agreement on
 additions to the Disarmament
 Commission which the USSR would
 accept,  before raising the ques-
 tion of enlarging the subcommit-
 tee.   On 13 November the Soviet
 delegation publicly promised to
 give "serious thought" to such
 a limited expansion plan.

 Efforts by the Soviet UN
 delegation  to  translate the
 effect of Soviet technological
 achievements into political
 gains on the disarmament issue
 have not met with consistent
 success.  There are indications
 that the heavy majority in favor
 of the Western 24-nation reso-
 lution in the Political Commit-
 tee of the General Assembly on
 6 November was facilitated to
 some extent by announcement of
 the launching of asecond Soviet
 earth satellite on 4 November.
 In addition to attempts
 to  create  a sense  of emer-
 gency                                                              and frustration  among
 other delegations,   Soviet dele-
 gates                                                              have  emphasized  the
 desirability  of direct talks
 with  the  United States on
 disarmament.  Kuznetsov pointed
 on  5  November  to  the pros-
 pect                                                             of conducting private
 bilateral  US-Soviet  talks
 under  the aegis  of an en-
 larged                                                               disarmament commission.
 European hopes for prog-
 ress at the NATO summit meeting
 of 16-18 December are centered
 on prospects for more scientific
 and technical cooperation, par-
 ticularly the fuller use  of
 West German talents and facili-
 ties, and greater American par-
 ticipation.
 Speeches during the past
 ten days by Secretary General
 Spaak and Prime Minister Mac-
 millan have contributed to high
 expectations for the meeting.
 Macmillan's reference to the
 "turning point in history" and
 the need to contribute "some
 national sovereignty" reflect
 his government's determination
 that the meetings bring more
 than declaration of good inten-
 tions.
 In seeking an adequate
 response to increased Soviet
 missile capabilities, many Eu-
 ropean governments are more
 open-minded on German missile
 production than ever before.
 British Foreign Secretary Lloyd
 has publicly implied that he
 might favor easing of the WEU
 restrictions on Germany to al-
 low Bonn to participate in a
 joint NATO program for modern
 weapons production.
 While Bonn hopes for a
 relaxation of treaty restric-
 tions; it probably would not
 initiate a request without def-
 inite assurances of support from
 at least the UK and France.
 Foreign Minister Brentano's non-
 committal statements  to  the
 press on 4 November stimulated
 a burst of press speculation
 which the American embassy in
 Bonn suggests may have been in-
 tended to test opinion through-
 out NATO countries.
 A number of the preliminary
 ideas on how to achieve greater
 cooperation reflect continuing
 doubt regarding the extent of
 the United States' willingness

 For reasons of prestige,
 the British appear the most
 anxious that the United States

 Ministry official has told the
 American embassy that the Mac-

 of reliance on the nuclear de-
 terrent would be politically
 more palatable if the United
 States would turn over to vari-
 ous NATO allies the "right" to
 make such weapons as antitank
 missiles or heav  tanks.
 25X1
 WEST GERMAN MISSILE AND ROCKET ACTIVITIES
 Reflecting a growing West-
 ern European interest in West
 German participation in joint
 development of modern weapons,
 Bonn has already requested a
 minor revision of the WEU treaty
 to permit production of an anti-
 tank missile and has set up
 within the Ministry of Defense
 a research organization concen-
 trating primarily on a surface-
 to-air missile.
 Although the Foreign Minis-
 try has denied that Bonn would
 seek any general revision of
 the treaty limitations on modern
 weapons production, there is a
 willingness to participate in
 research and development proj-
 ects within NATO which are per-
 mitted by the WEU treaty.   As
 early as 1955,  the Ministry of
 Defense formed a section to co-
 operate with private industry
 in various phases of missile
 work, and the press reported
 that the defense budget for
 1958 will include about $2,500,-
 000 for missile research.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUI[MART
 In his speech to the Su-
 preme Soviet on 6 November,
 Khrushchev made no forecast of
 total Soviet industrial output
 for 1972, but his figures for
 future production of selected
 items imply a moderation of the
 headlong pace of Soviet growth
 during the next 15 years.
 Energy availability is a
 case in point.  Analysis of the
 projected growth of output of
 fuels suggests an average an-
 nual increase through 1972 of
 about 6.5 percent, as compared
 with an average annual increase
 of some 7.8 percent from 1950
 to 1955.  The importance of
 petroleum, including the mas-
 sive natural gas increases, in
 total fuel supply will perhaps
 double by 1972, while that of
 coal will diminish.   Electric
 power production is to increase
 at an annual rate of about 9.8
 percent.
 Despite the evident modera-
 tion of  industrial                  growth,
 Khrushchev contended that "it
 is a quite real and feasible
 task to outstrip the United
 States in a very short period."
 He drew attention to the "chron-
 ic  crises" of capitalism, the
 depressions that make capital-
 ist economic growth "intermit-
 tent," contrasting this to the
 "uninterrupted development" of
 planned socialist states.  Tak-
 ing into account his relatively
 feasible forecasts  for  the
 USSR in 1972 and an assist from
 a hoped-for Western depression,
 Khrushchev stated, "The level
 of output in the United States
 is no longer inaccessible...
 as it might have seemed to some
 people 25 or 30 years ago."
 Khrushchev forecast 1972
 output for 11 items, covering
 a considerably broader spectrum
 than the four items--coal, pe-
 troleum, pig iron and steel--

 with his statements on housing
 and agriculture confirming the
 existing stepped-up programs,
 served to notify the Soviet
 people that their material well-
 being is not being ignored.
 For the consumer items cited,
 rates of growth are not marked-
 ly lower than those of the cited
 producer items--despite the
 continuing preferential growth
 of heavy industry.
 The preliminary 1957 out-
 put data given by Khrushchev,
 presaging only a slight overful-
 fillment of the mod-
 est  1957 plan for
 total industrial pro-
 duction, seem to have
 made him conservative
 in his long-range
 forecasts.   In agri-
 culture, 1957 was
 disappointing compared
 with 1956, a bumper
 crop year; less fa-
 vorable weather re-
 sulted in a harvest
 much lower than last
 year, and grain pro-
 curement by the state
 is apparently less
 than three quarters
 of last year's record
 take.  Khrushchev of-
 fered no further pan-
 aceas for agriculture, but spoke
 of the possible future expansion
 of the "New Lands" program in
 Siberia and the Far East.
 The course of pushing rap-
 idly on all fronts simultaneously
 is apparently now an accepted re-
 gime policy.   Future growth can-
 nto be maintained without bal-
 anced attention to the various
 interdependent activities of the
 increasingly complex and maturing
 Soviet economy, with increased
 reliance on the "carrot" of in-
 centives rather than the "stick"
 of coercion,                            25X1

 The views expressed on this oc-

 unity, he said, can be main-
 tained only if all socialist
 states recognize and adhere to
 the basic principles of Marx-
 ism-Leninism and proletarian
 internationalism, i.e, recogni-
 tion that the USSR is the most
 powerful of the Communist states
 and that what is good for the
 USSR is also good for them.
 In an apparent effort to re-
 assure the Poles and Yugoslavs,
 Khrushchev'added that "all
 countries of socialism, large
 or small...have fully equal
 rights."
 Yugoslav Vice President
 Kardelj described his country's
 relations with the Soviet Union
 as based on the "great idea of
 proletarian internationalism"
 --defined by the Yugoslavs as
 support for the Kremlin in for-
 eign policy matters--and on
 "equality of independent peo-
 ples."  Polish Party First Sec-
 retary Gomulka, as quoted in
 Pravda on 5 November, listed
 as the conditions of bloc unity:
 national independence and recog-
 nition of national peculiari-
 ties, and the independence of
 Communist parties.
 Mao Tse-tung, while ac-
 cepting as a "sacred interna-
 tional obligation" the need to
 strengthen bloc solidarity under
 Soviet leadership, nonethless
 observed that "we firmly main-
 tain that all nations should
 practice... principles of mutual
 respect for sovereignty .... non-
 interference in each other's
 internal affairs, equality, and
 mutual benefit," the principles
 enunciated in the 30 October
 1956 declaration.
 Gomulka, too in his 6 No-
 vember speech, acknowledged
 that the Soviet Union occupied
 the "first place in the family
 of all socialist countries,"
 which he described, however,
 as having equal rights.   In
 contrast to the restraint ex-
 pressed in the Yugoslav, Polish,
 and Chinese comments, the ortho-
 dox satellites described the hap-
 piness of their peoples under
 Moscow's benevolent guidance.
 The need to combat "dogmat-
 ism and revisionism"--the latter
 designated by Mao as the greater
 danger--was alluded to in the
 majority of the anniversary
 speeches, indicating that the
 threat represented by the devia-
 tions of Djilas and Nagy, spec-
 ifically named by Khrushchev,
 and the Polish liberals is a         25X1
 matter of serious concern among
 bloc leaders.
 Peiping's first regularly
 scheduled international ship-
 ping line will begin operations
 soon, using a new Polish-built
 cargo ship.   This line initially
 will provide service between
 Canton,  Hong Kong, and Haiphong
 and may be expanded to include
 major Southeast Asian ports now
 primarily served by free world
 vessels.
 Peiping for some time has
 indicated an interest in estab-
 lishing its own regular shipping
 service to South and Southeast
 Asia, since more than one third
 of China's total trade with the
 non-Communist world is with
 these areas.   The Chinese also
 probably expect that a shipping
 line will  boost their prestige
 in Southeast Asia.

 NEW BRIDGE EASES CHINESE COMMUNIST TRANSPORT BOTTLENECK
 It now appears that the
 new two-decked rail and highway
 bridge over the Yangtze River
 at the central China metropolis
 of Wuhan, opened to traffic last
 month, will be the only major
 railroad construction project
 to be completed this year.   Com-
 munist China is not diverging
 widely from its plan to lay
 only 334 miles of new track this
 year--as against 1,747 miles
 in 1956--and is concentrating
 instead on increasing the capac-
 Hsiatung, in western Kansu, al-
 most a year after rail-laying
 had reached this point, and a
 program for "rebuilding" the
 Tienshiu-Lanchow line, finished
 in 1952, is now under way.
 The completion of the new
 bridge at Wuhan well ahead of
 schedule is, however, a signif-
 icant achievement.  The bridge
 is 5,446 feet long and has nine
 spans, each 415 feet long.   Its
 superstructure is 52.5  feet
 high and 75 feet wide.
 The upper deck has
 two pedestrian walk-
 ways eight feet wide
 and a six-lane high-
 way.  The lower deck
 carries pedestrian
 walkways and a double-
 track railway, only
 '%,*    one track of which
 has been installed
 ity of overworked older lines
 through a program of double-
 tracking and on improving
 freight-handling'capacity in
 stations and yards.
 In addition, Peiping has
 found it expedient to better
 the standards on some of the
 lines built with such notable
 dispatch  in the immediate past.
 1'or  example, the Trans-Sinkiang
 line has only  recently been
 opened to passenger traffic to
 so far.
 Costing $30-33,-

 Wuhan a major rail
 center.    The entire
 project, which includes
 new stations, track, and marshal-
 ing,yards--as well as the rail
 and highway bridges over the Han
 River completed earlier--is ex-
 pected to be finished in 1958.
 Construction of the bridge
 was greatly speeded through use
 of an unusual: method of pier-

 14 November 1957
 PEIPING UNDERSCORES OPPOSITION TO "TWO CHINAS" CONCEPT
 Communist China is giving
 increasingly wide publicity to
 its unyielding opposition to a
 "two Chinas" solution for the
 Taiwan problem.  On 7 November
 it dramatically walked out of
 the International Red Cross Con-
 ference in New Delhi after the
 conference voted to seat the
 Chinese Nationalist delegation
 as well as the Chinese Commu-
 nists.
 Before their withdrawal,
 the Communists had exerted
 heavy pressure on the Indian
 government to prevent the seat-
 ing of the Nationalist delega-
 tion.   Other participants were
 warned that their support of the
 Nationalists would be construed
 as a "hostile act."  Chinese
 Communist editorial  comment
 since the withdrawal reflects
 Peiping's position that it will
 not compromise on issues of this
 kind even if they impede the re-
 gime's campaign to win broader
 international recognition.   The
 propaganda pictures Peiping as
 "not eager" for American recog-
 nition and describes "two Chinas"
 as an "illusion" indicating an
 impasse in America's China pol-
 icy.
 Anti-American invective
 has accompanied similar with-
 drawals by Peiping in the past
 year from other international
 occasions, such as the Olympic
 games, film  festivals,   and
 scientific and technical events.
 After months of preliminary plan-
 ning for participation, Peiping
 withdrew at the last moment from
 the activities of the  Interna-
 tional Geophysical Year.  The
 visits to Taiwan by Prime Minis-
 ter Kishi of Japan and former
 Premier Pinay of France provided
 occasions for further vociferous
 protests by Peiping against the
 "two Chinas" formulation.
 Peiping charges that Great
 Britain, Japan, and France are
 the countries most guilty of
 following the American lead and
 developing closer ties with Tai-
 wan.  Under no circumstances,
 the regime's leaders say, will
 Peiping enter the UN if the Na-
 tionalists remain.
 The Chinese declare they
 will patiently await admission
 to the UN and that in the mean-
 time the UN will remain stymied
 in its efforts to-solve major
 international problems.
 Communist China's pro-
 fessions on the "two Chinas"
 concept harmonize with its prop-
 aganda campaign to "liberate"
 Taiwan.  Proclaiming that Tai-
 wan is Chinese territory and
 that the Taiwan issue is an in-
 ternal affair, the Communists
 insist that only their regime
 can be represented in interna-
 tional forums.  American "in-
 trigues" are held to be respon-
 sible for continued Nationalist
 accreditation to the UN and
 other international bodies.
 Chou En-lai has stated
 that in the future Peiping
 will not establish diplomatic
 relations with nations that con-
 tinue diplomatic ties with Taipei.
 Apparently Peiping's relations
 with Britain are not to serve
 as a precedent for other coun-
 tries.                                                      In 1954, Peiping recip-
 rocated British recognition--
 which had been extended in 1950
 --without requiring the UK to
 withdraw its consulate on Tai-
 wan.                                                      This consulate, however,'
 is accredited to the Taiwan pro-
 vincial authorities rather than
 to the Nationalist government.

 The Communist-dominated
 nongovernmental Afro-Asian Sol-
 idarity Conference, sponsored
 by the Asian Solidarity Commit-
 tee, is to be held in Cairo from
 26 December to 1 January.   Prep-
 arations indicate that the Sino-
 Soviet bloc and Egyptian nation-
 alists will try to define a
 "popular" anti-Western posture
 for Asian-African countries on
 subjects such as anti-imperial-
 ism, national liberation, and
 racial discrimination.   Sino-
 Soviet bloc delegates will push
 the international Communist
 line in dealing with  such
 agenda issues as the Algerian
 war,  the Syrian question, and
 a ban on testing and use of
 nuclear weapons.
 The agenda also includes
 discussion of "support of eco-
 nomic and technical cooperation
 among the Afro-Asian peoples,"
 and conference propaganda may
 call for an economic aid re-
 lationship which would by def-
 inition exclude the West  but
 include the USSR and Communist
 China.   Conference officials
 expect delegates from 50 na-
 tions.
 Delegates from 21 Asian-
 African countries and the Sino-
 Soviet bloc attended a prepara-
 tory meeting in Cairo in Octo-
 ber.           They included exiles and
 opposition leaders from Jordan,
 Iraq, and Lebanon, and left
 Populist politicians from Syria.
 "Freedom Fighters"--presumably
 leaders of nationalist move-
 ments--attended from the Camer-
 oons  and Algeria.   Foreign
 Ministries in countries where
 no national solidarity commit-
 tees exist were asked to act
 as intermediaries in arranging
 nongovernmental delegations to
 the preparatory meeting.
 President Nasi-' has emphat-
 ically identified himself with
 the conference through press
 interviews and press releases,
 and the preparatory committee
 is headed by one of his close
 personal advisers who also
 heads the Islamic Congress.
 The Egyptian Finance Ministry
 has furnished quarters for the
 preparatory committee and fi-
 nanced it.   This direct sup-
 port by the Egyptian government
 has tended to confuse the non-
 governmental nature of the con-
 ference.
 Communist control of the
 committee has been disguised
 by the slow and discreet organ-
 izational development and a
 policy of delegating responsi-
 bility to non-Communist Asians.
 Its origin can be traced to
 the Communist-front World Peace
 Council which was never success-
 ful in establishing itself in
 Asia.   At an unpublicized meet-
 ing in December 1956,  the com-
 mittee decided to expand its
 activities to include Africa
 and, in connection with the
 preparatory meeting,  a commit-
 tee representative said the
 establishment of new national
 committees in Asia and Africa
 then had priority.   The com-
 mittee's emphasis on nation-
 alism and national independence
 in Asia is reflected in its
 pattern of organization, which
 places primary importance on
 the national solidarity com-
 mittees rather than on the ap-
 parently weak secretariat.
 Fellow-traveling members
 of the committee maintain con-
 nections with other Communist-
 influenced or Communist-front
 movements in Asia.   Committee
 leaders figured prominently in
 the Afro-Asian Lawyers' Confer-
 ence,  the World Peace Council
 meeting in June in Colombo, and
 the Tokyo antinuclear weapons
 meeting in August.                        25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Japanese Prime Minister
 Nobusuke Kishi will make a sec-
 ond tour of Asian countries be-
 tween 18 November and 8 Decem-
 ber, visiting seven nations--
 South Vietnam,  Laos,  Cambodia,
 Indonesia, Australia, New Zea-
 land, and the Philippines--which
 were not included in his tour
 last May.   Kishi views this trip,
 as he did the earlier one,  as
 an opportunity to use high-level,
 personal diplomacy to allay
 latent suspicion of Japan and
 to promote increased economic
 cooperation.   He will give major
 consideration to outstanding
 reparations obligations and he
 will seek reactions to a revised
 scheme for an Asian development
 fund.
 The prime minister expects
 to pave the way for greater ac-
 ceptance of Japan in the Asian
 community and hopes that on
 particular problems he will find
 a sounder basis for cooperation
 than he did in May.   At that
 time Kishi encountered a general
 reluctance to accept his Asian
 development fund idea as well
 as a division of opinion with
 regard to Tokyo's policy toward
 Communist China.
 The Japanese government has
 been unable to reach reparations
 settlements with Indonesia and
 Routh Vietnam prior to Kishi's
 visits to these countries. Since
 Japan recognizes that reparations
 settlements are a major factor
 in its attempt to develop closer
 economic relations with South-
 east Asia, Kishi may be prepared
 to break the deadlocks with new
 offers.
 In addition, Kishi may have
 revised his thinking on the
 Asian development fund.   It has
 been coolly received in Asia,
 particularly with regard to joint
 US-Japanese sponsorship; the
 United States prefers a bilater-
 al,  project-by-project approach;
 and Kishi's own roving ambassa-
 dor in Asia has made recommenda-
 tions which essentially reflect
 the American position.   Although
 no official announcements have
 been made, there are indications
 that Kishi now believes  a lim-
 ited program including so-called
 neutral or all-Asian funds and
 excluding outside assistance
 may have more appeal.  The forth-
 coming trip willgive Kishi an op-
 portunity to test reaction to a
 revised schme of this type.

 While minimizing foreign
 policy differences, Diem de-

 sued on 8 November by Nehru and
 Diem reflected the desire of
 both to find common grounds.
 Specifically, the two leaders
 noted that "the terrible ad-
 vances in the development of
 weapons of mass destruction"
 made most urgent the maintenance
 of world peace.   It also stated
 that "continued and increased
 cooperation" between India and
 South Vietnam was desirable "in
 common pursuit of the economic
 and social advancement of their
 people."
 With an eye to the future,
 Diem apparently intended his
 New Delhi visit to establish
 rapport with India's neutralists.
 He has frequently indicated con-
 cern that South Vietnam is
 threatened with isolation as a
 result of growing neutralism in
 neighboring countries, and prob-
 ably considers that Indian sym-
 pathy may prove an indispensable
 asset in the future.

 Morocco's Istiglal party,
 frustrated last year in its
 initial attempt to obtain a
 monopoly of power when King
 Mohamed V conceded it only ma-
 jority representation in the
 government,  appears to be renew-
 ing its drive to establish a
 one-party government.   With the
 recent nomination of an Istiglal
 leader to head the Ministry of
 Defense,  the party now holds
 11 of 18 cabinet portfolios and
 has set its sights on the post
 of premier, occupied by Si
 Mbarek el Bekkai, a close friend
 of the King, and the position
 of chief of staff of the Moroc-
 can royal army, occupied by
 the King's eldest son,  Crown
 Prince Moulay Hassan.
 Although the King theoret-
 ically remains an absolute mon-
 arch, in practice he shares his
 power with the Istiglal.   Fear-
 ing the prorepublic tendencies
 of one wing of the party,  he
 has encouraged potential oppo-
 sition parties as a counter-
 weight to Istiqlal's efforts to
 eliminate political opposition.
 He is presumed to have at least
 tacitly approved the formation
 in September of the Popular
 Movement, led by Mahjoubi Ahar-
 dane,  then governor of the Prov-
 ince of Rabat, and Minister of
 State Lahcen el Lyoussi, both
 close to the King.   Istiqlal
 succeeded in having the party
 banned on 24 October and sub-
 sequently Ahardane was removed
 from office.   Premier Bekkai's
 alleged association with the new
 group presumably will be the
 basis for the Istiglal campaign
 to force the premier to resign.
 Although the King approved
 the ouster of Ahardane,  Bekkai's

 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NENNI SOCIALIST PARTY
 The sending of a Nenni So-
 cialist delegation to Moscow
 for the 40th anniversary cele-
 brations, almost simultaneously
 with the issuance of Nenni state-
 ments criticizing the Communists
 and the Social Democrats, serves
 to illustrate the problem fac-
 ing the Italian Socialist party
 (PSI) as a result of its an-
 nounced decision to campaign
 independently in the 1958 Ital-
 ian national elections.   With
 Socialist reunification ruled
 out at least until after the
 elections, Nenni's evident hope
 is to hold his own party togeth-
 er and increase its popular at-
 traction by alternating appeals
 to pro- and anti-Communist ele-
 ments both inside and outside
 the party.
 Party delegates sent to
 Moscow included only one from
 the wing favoring independence
 from the,.Communists, three oth--
 ers from this group having
 begged off at the last minute
 on grounds of "illness" and
 "visa delays."  An apparent
 balancing gesture to right-wing
 elements appeared on 7 November
 when the party daily Avanti re-
 iterated earlier sharp criti-
 cisms of the Soviet system and
 said that the popular sovereign-
 ty guaranteed by socialism has
 not yet been achieved in the
 USSR.
 Shortly before, however,
 Nenni had attacked the Democrat-
 ic Socialists for putting the
 "tombstone" on reunification
 when their late October party
 congress made a sharper PSI
 break with the Communists a pre-
 condition for reunion. Avanti
 returned to the other tack on
 10 November with a new call for
 Socialist unity, for friendly
 discussions with the Christian
 Democrats, and for further clari-
 fication of the PSI's relation-
 ship with the Communists.
 A further problem is posed
 by the death on 3 November of
 Giuseppe Di Vittorio, the Com-
 munist chief of the Italian
 General Labor Confederation
 (CGIL), whose secretariat in-
 cludes a number of PSI officials.
 This event raises the tempting
 possibility of replacing Di Vit-
 torio by a Socialist,  but at a
 time when Nenni might prefer
 not to have another point of
 dispute with the Communists and
 with certain elements in his
 own party.

 COMMUNISTS EXPANDING LABOR ACTIVITY IN SOUTH AMERICA
 A proposed expansion of
 the activities of the Commu-
 nist Confederation of Latin
 American Workers (CTAL) in-
 cludes the establishment of an
 office in Chile responsible for
 all South America except Vene-
 zuela and Colombia.
 The establishment of the
 new office is likely to be ac-
 companied by a stepped-up of-
 fensive against US business in-
 terests in Latin America which
 may include mass strikes, pro-
 test demonstrations, and other
 militant actions.   More ef-
 ficient reporting for the WFTU
 on agricultural and other eco-
 nomic subjects is expected to
 be another result of the planned
 expansion.
 Only three influential na-
 tional labor confederations--in
 Brazil, Uruguay, and Ecuador--
 are formally affiliated with
 the CTAL.   In Chile, however,
 CTAL has extremely cordial rela-
 tions with the powerful Commu-
 nist-dominated Single Labor Cen-
 tral of Chile (CUTCH).   Oscar
 Astudillo,  the head of the na-
 tional labor commission of the
 Chilean Communist party and
 member of the CUTCH directorate,
 is a CTAL executive board mem-
 ber.   CUTCH has offered to
 help in setting up the new CTAL
 office,  thus mobilizing support
 for the project among large
 segments of Chile's organized
 labor.
 The new office, which will
 publish the official WFTU pub-
 lication, will include two mem-
 bers of CTAL's present Mexico
 City staff but will be staffed
 primarily by Chileans.   The
 local Communist party is in an
 excellent position to provide
 the center with well-trained
 workers, as has been evidenced
 by the party's participation in
 recent meetings in various
 South American countries and in
 particular by the role some of
 its members have played in the
 labor unrest in southern Peru
 which led to the declaration of
 a state of siege on 5 November.
 The proposed CTAL center
 probably will not be strongly
 opposed by non-Communist Chilean
 political leaders, who are now
 campaigning for the 1958 presi-
 dential elections and will try
 not to offend the labor vote.
 President Ibanez in particular
 is indebted to the extreme left-
 ist parties for their support
 of two of his cabinet ministers
 recently impeached by congress,
 and he may accordingly try to avoid
 any appearance of crackin  down m
 the leftists.                             25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Lopez has already received
 enthusiastic  public support
 from all the diverse components
 of the PRI.   On 7 November,
 President Ruiz Cortines, who
 would like to see the moderate
 policies of his administration
 continued,  told the American
 ambassador that Lopez is his
 personal choice.   The Presi-
 dent's wide powers traditional-
 ly include the choice of a suc-
 cessor, but in practice a candi-
 date must be acceptable to the
 somewhat divergent interests
 represented by two powerful for-
 mer presidents--Lazaro Cardenas
 and Miguel Aleman.
 The popular Cardenas, who
 expropriated foreign oil hold-
 ings during his 1934-40 admin-
 istration,  leads the PRI's left-
 ist wing and represents the na-
 tionalist, neutralist sentiments
 strongly held by many Mexicans
 and sometimes expressed in anti-
 US attitudes.   Cardenas' in-
 fluence over Lopez Mateos, how-
 ever, is unlikely to be any
 greater than it was over Ruiz
 Cortines.
 Aleman, who gave indus-
 trial development first priority
 during his 1946-52 term, speaks
 for the more conservative busi-
 ness interests which have re-
 cently been gaining influence
 in PRI and government circles.
 In order to overcome the pres-
 ent leveling off of Mexico's
 remarkable economic progress
 of the past ten years, this
 group wants a favorable climate
 for private investment and an
 administration responsive to
 its concepts of stability.
 Lopez has pleased labor
 with consistent negotiation of
 SECRET
 wage increases and with his
 emergency program in the un-
 stable period following the 1954
 peso devaluation.   He earned
 the confidence of management by
 avoiding major strikes, thereby
 helping maintain high industrial
 production.   The approval of
 Lopez by usually divergent lo-
 cal Marxist groups may indicate
 they expect even more opportunity
 for action under his presidency
 than Mexico's traditional in-
 dulgence of political leftists
 has previously provided, although
 he is not known to have shown
 sympathy for Communists.
 Now 48, Lopez Mateos was
 a lawyer and teacher before be-
 coming a senator in 1946.  As
 secretary general of the per-
 manent central committee of the
 PRI, he was active in the presi-  25X1
 dential campaign of Ruiz Cortines
 and became minister of labor in

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA
 Economic cooperation on a
 multinational basis is receiving
 increased attention as a promis-
 ing method of raising living
 standards in South and South-
 east Asia.   Although practical
 achievements to date have been
 limited,  impetus for regional
 development schemes has been
 generated recently by the wide
 interest shown at the meeting
 in Saigon last month of the
 Colombo plan powers and by the
 Japanese desire to establish a
 regional development fund. The
 Communist bloc may attempt to
 rival present efforts among the
 free nations of Asia to achieve
 greater economic cooperation
 by offering competing projects
 of its own.
 Obstacles to Cooperation
 Regional economic coopera-
 tion has often been advocated
 as a method of achieving higher
 living standards and greater
 stability in the underdeveloped
 countries in South and South-
 east Asia.      A number of formida-
 ble political and economic ob-
 stacles,  however,  have hereto-
 fore discouraged any move to-
 ward area-wide cooperation.
 Chief among these has been the
 intense nationalism of the newly
 independent countries in the
 area.   This sentiment, developed
 during the period of Western
 colonialism, and the antagonisms
 toward the Japanese growing out
 of World War II have created
 suspicions that there are ul-
 terior motives behind any pro-
 posals for regional development
 emanating from these sources.
 Japan's continuing efforts to
 promote regional economic co-
 operation as one alternative
 to deeper entanglement with Com-
 munist China and the rest of
 the Soviet bloc has been handi-
 capped by these fears.
 Equally important is the
 traditional distrust and con-
 flict of interest among neigh-
 boring South and Southeast
 Asian countries.   As a result,
 these states hesitate to par-
 ticipate in any multilateral
 development scheme which might
 benefit a rival.
 The economies of most of
 the countries in the area,  es-
 pecially in Southeast Asia, are
 competitive rather than comple-
 mentary.   Each state is depend-
 ent on similar exports, such
 as rice, rubber, tin, and lum-
 ber.   Geographically,  trade
 and communications have devel-
 oped in a generally north-south
 pattern following the valleys
 of the main rivers and outward
 to Europe rather than laterally
 across high mountains and Asian
 national boundaries.
 Finally,  there is a cer-
 tain amount of competition as
 well as lack of coordination be-
 tween the various organizations
 interested in promoting regional
 development.    The Colombo plan,
 for instance, has been criti-
 cized for favoring members of
 the Commonwealth, and some spon-
 sors of the plan are reluctant
 to see the development of SEATO
 as a  vehicle for economic aid.
 In addition, various UN agen-
 cies, such as ECAFE,  are back-
 ing regional projects and tend
 to operate independently of
 other organizations.
 Factors for Cooperation
 Despite these obstacles,
 there has been some progress
 toward regional economic coop-
 eration.   The United States in
 fiscal 1957 committed  almost
 $1.126 billion for nonmilitary
 aid to South and Southeast Asia.
 This aid is divided among every
 country in the area, except
 Malaya, and at least indirectly
 promotes regional cooperation.
 An example of this was the Ameri-
 can purchase of Burmese rice to

 of assistance through the Ameri-
 can Asian Development Fund, now
 administered by the President's
 office.
 In addition to the demon-
 strable material benefits to
 be obtained from regional co-
 operation,  there appears to be
 a growing concern  over  the
 threat of Communist China. This
 is probably best illustrated
 by the increasing anxiety of
 the Burmese government over the
 problems of border demarcation
 and Chinese infiltration and
 the Cambodian government's fear
 of Communist subversion of the
 local Chinese.   While this fear
 has not yet been expressed to
 any great extent in many coun-
 tries,  it may well become a
 major factor favorable to the
 growth of regional-mindedness
 in the area.
 Progress to Date
 Practical achievements
 thus far have been modest. ECAFE
 is promoting international ex-
 ploitation and control of the
 Mekong River, which either bor-
 ders on,  or flows through, five
 of the countries in Southeast
 Asia.   The riparian powers are
 represented on a Mekong River
 Commission, which has made sur-
 veys and project proposals pre-
 liminary to an ambitious scheme
 of river valley development.
 "Operation Brotherhood," under
 which Philippine medical teams
 are active in the hinterland
 of Laos and Vietnam, is jointly
 sponsored by the Philippine
 and local Junior Chambers of
 Commerce.   Financed by the In-
 ternational Junior Chambers of
 Commerce, it has been widely
 acclaimed both for its humani-
 tarian aspects and as an out-
 standing example of interregion-
 al cooperation.
 There have been a number
 of recent proposals for the
 future.   The Japanese have in-
 dicated that they are willing
 to take the initiative in set-
 ting up regional centers to
 train various types of techni-
 cians.                                                        The Colombo plan organi-
 zation is studying the possi-
 bility of broadening its stu-
 dent exchange program to give
 greater emphasis to regional
 cooperation.   Burmese officials
 have suggested that annual con-
 sultative meetings of regional
 planners could be useful.   Con-
 sideration is also being given
 to such specific undertakings
 as an interregional telecom-
 munications network and joint
 Thai-Burmese utilization of the
 power to be generated from the
 Yan Hee hydroelectric project
 in northwestern Thailand spon-
 sored by the International Bank
 for Reconstruction and Develop-
 ment.
 Sino-Soviet Bloc Efforts
 Sino-Soviet bloc bilateral
 economic aid programs have
 proved their appeal in the area.
 The bloc, particularly the USSR,
 is now carrying out aid pro-
 grams in India, Afghanistan,
 and Burma.  Communist China
 has an effective aid mission
 at work in Cambodia,  and East
 Germany is setting up a sugar
 mill and Czechoslovakia a tire
 factory in Indonesia.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 November 1957
 Of at least equal signifi-
 cance are the bloc's efforts to
 expand its trade with the area.
 The best known of these efforts
 has been the triangular trade
 involving Ceylonese rubber sent
 to Communist China which is paid
 for,"in part, with rice ob-
 tained from Burma.
 The Soviet Union and its
 European satellites also took
 advantage of the slump in the
 rice market in 1955-56 to make
 barter agreements
 with Burma.   Much of
 this  rice  was di-
 verted to North Viet-
 nam and undoubtedly
 played a  large part
 in averting a major
 economic catastrophe
 there  in 'view of
 the  series of crop
 failures.   Wnile the
 Burmese have been
 largely disillusioned
 with their barter ar-
 rangements and are
 seeking to disengage
 in favor of cash cus-
 tomers, their expe-
 rience reveals the
 vulnerability of the
 countries in the area
 to Communist trade
 offers.
 of their past and present co-
 lonial policies.   In addition,
 the Soviet Union and,. more re-
 cently, Communist China,have
 the advantage of appearing to
 Asians as examples of how back-
 ward countries can make a quick
 transition to become modern
 industrial powers.

 14 NOVEMBER 1957
 The bloc probably will be
 able to continue such deals as
 its industrial capacity increases
 and as long as its need for raw
 materials remains high.   More-
 over, a comparison of the eco-
 nomic and technical assistance
 programs of the free world and
 the Sino-Soviet bloc does not
 necessarily provide an accurate
 gauge of the political impact
 they have on South and South-
 east Asia.
 The Soviet Union has long
 been credited for its support
 of Asian nationalism and oppo-
 sition to imperialism, whereas
 western nations, no matter how
 significant their long-range
 programs may be, bear the burden
 ilar pressures to improve the
 economic conditions of their
 countries at a rate sufficient
 to meet the expectation of their
 peoples, and their tenure of
 office is dependent on their
 effectiveness.   Whether closely
 aligned with the West or neu-
 tralist in character, in most
 cases they speak for the domi-
 nant political factions on the
 national scenes that are least
 influenced by the Sino-Soviet
 bloc.   If they fail to satisfy
 their peoples, the opposition
 parties which are most likely
 to take over from them are of

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 GOMULKA'S PARTY REFORMS
 Poland's Wladyslaw Gomulka
 --faced with a fragmented and
 discredited party--has launched
 a campaign to change the party's
 composition. At the tenth cen-
 tral committee plenum of the
 Polish United Workers' party
 in late October,  he came to
 grips with the fact that the
 party had become a powerless
 instrument in the countryside
 and commands little support or
 respect among industrial work-
 ers.
 Gomulka wants to cut the
 party down to approximately half
 its size to facilitate the de-
 velopment of a united and ef-
 fective group.  A complicating
 factor for Gomulka is that the
 remaining skeleton of the once-
 powerful party is composed of
 full-time functionaries, many
 of whom are Stalinist elements
 COMPOSITION OF POLISH UNM WORKERS' P
 (FIGURES IN PERCENTAGES)
 Gomulka has been hamstrung
 chiefly by the apathy and lack
 of discipline of party workers
 on the local level.   The party's
 prohibition of "administrative
 methods"--i.e,, interference by
 direct orders in the administra-
 tion of government--has im-
 mobilized local leaders.   Many
 of them have not adjusted to
 the new methods of persuasion
 without force.   Since there has
 been no threat of punishment
 for a do-nothing attitude, many
 local functionaries have failed
 to implement new party policies,
 and others have not accommodated
 themselves to the abandonment
 of policies they had come to
 identify with orthodox Communism.
 As a result, the contempt of
 the populace for party official-
 dom has been compounded.
 The party thus faces dif-

 his policies depends on the de-
 velopment of what he calls
 "humanism" in party practices
 so that the party can appeal
 for the confidence and loyal-
 ties of the majority of Poles.
 Weak Party Control
 In his efforts to assert
 his power over the party and
 get his programs implemented,
 ficult problems in
 its control over key
 social and political
 elements in the coun-
 try.  Although "en-
 lightened" methods of
 controlling the Sejm
 have been adopted,
 tight party control
 over Sejm activities
 continues, a situa-
 tion causing growing
 consternation among
 non-Communist deputies.
 The party has relin-
 quished its detailed
 control over politi-
 cal parties and mass
 organizations.   Now it is only
 necessary for these elements
 to "cooperate" with the party,
 with the result that an opposi-
 tion espousing Western ideas has
 infiltrated the most important
 of these groups and is fighting
 for control of them.
 Gomulka's attempts to handle
 youth problems have been almost
 totally unsuccessful.   The Com-

 goal is
 a membership of 800,000.   The
 party has failed to attract
 and keep the majority of work-
 ing-class members.
 Gomulka's attack on cor-
 rupt elements is aimed in part
 at achievement of popular re-
 spect for his discredited party.
 Fully cognizant of the harm
 done by the past excesses of.
 the party, Gomulka wants to in-
 still into party practices a
 new code of ethics which he
 calls "humanism" and thereby
 gain the confidence of the Pol-
 ish populace.  Furthermore, in
 a move apparently designed to
 highlight the changes in the
 party, it has been proposed
 that the organization be re-
 named the Polish Communist party.
 To carry out the necessary
 purges, Gomulka has decided to
 depend on the party control com-
 mission, the composition of
 which has not been altered since
 he took over party leadership.
 Changes in Organization
 Gomulka's plan for organi-
 zational reform is designed to
 achieve a reinvigorated role
 for the party in Polish politi-
 cal life.  Changes have been
 made in the organization of the
 central committee staff in the
 past year which tend to eliminate
 the party's detailed administra-
 tive control of all phases of
 government operations and sub-
 stitute in its place a function
 of policy formulation and con-
 trol over all major political
 decisions.
 In place of the old de-
 partments using large numbers
 of full-time party functionaries,
 commissions are being established
 composed largely of experts
 drawn from government ministries
 and agencies, to meet at speci-
 fied periods to formulate poli-
 cies. Only small secretariats
 of the commissions now appear
 to be in the central committee's
 full-time employ. Implementation
 of policies formulated by the
 party now appears to depend
 largely on commission members
 working in their government
 capacities.
 In the process of this re-
 organization, the party has
 dropped 8,669, or approximately
 half, Of its full-time party
 functionaries this year.  Of
 this number 1,700 were from
 central and provincial commit-
 tees, and 6,950 were from dis-
 trict, urban, and area commit-
 tees.   The trade union paper
 Glos Pracy has complained that
 further cuts must be delayed
 until provision for other em-
 ployment can be made, and /i  25X1
 a
 total reduction of 70 percent
 is envisaged.
 Prospects
 Effective control from the
 center will probably not have
 been re-established by April
 1958, the new date set for the
 third party congress, at which
 Gomulka will endeavor to complete
 his reforms and elect a new cen-
 tral committee.  Nevertheless,
 it is very unlikely that his
 leadership of the party would
 be jeopardized at that time.
 Even with the withdrawal
 or expulsion of those elements
 apathetic and unsympathetic to
 the party, a long time will be
 required to restore to the party
 membership a sense of real value
 which in turn would engender
 greater party discipline.
 The efforts--not.new--to
 eliminate corruption probably
 will not succeed in doing more

 a prominent defector as inher-

 than eliminate all of extremist
 opposition, Gomulka will prob-
 ably attempt to intimidate ele-

 gain control by making examples
 of some of the more infamous
 Stalinists and extreme liberals.
 Neither group, however, could
 be entirely eliminated without
 grave consequences for the par-

 FRANCE'S ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS
 France's ability to sur-
 vive cabinet crises like the
 recent 36-day interregnum be-
 tween the Bourges-Maunoury and
 Gaillard governments depends
 largely on a well-trained and
 cohesive bureaucracy.  Conti-
 nuity is maintained despite
 changes in government by per-
 manent administrative officials
 who often exercise considerable
 influence on policy.
 Various factors are respon-
 sible for the unusual power of
 the top civil servant in France.
 One is a long tradition of high-
 ly centralized administration
 which goes back to Napoleon and
 even the absolute monarchy of
 the 17th century.   In its mod-
 ern form this tradition is famil-
 iarly illustrated in the pro-
 vincial chief executive appoint-
 ed by Paris,  the prefect.   His
 powers in his own domain are
 broad enough, however, to ob-
 struct the policies of the gov-
 ernment of the moment in Paris.
 On the national level, a
 similar situation obtains.   The
 power of the National Assembly
 to determine new policy is un-
 questioned,  but the need for
 continuity of administration
 results in many opportunities
 for permanent officials to in-
 fluence government policy, par-
 ticularly in the case of new
 and short-lived cabinets.   The
 French system is such as to en-
 sure that these top civil serv-
 ants:.. are exceptionally well
 trained.
 The Bureaucratic Elite
 Within the   bureaucracy,
 an. elite of several  hundred
 among the  million-odd civil
 servants holds the  top advisory
 posts in  the key  Ministries
 of  National Defense, Interior,
 Finance,  and Foreign Affairs
 and fills  the personal staffs
 of  the President  of the re-
 public  and the premier.  Made
 up  of individuals who have
 weathered a rigorous system
 of competitive education,   this
 elite maintains  a considerable
 degree of  cohesion  which ex-
 tends  across political, min-
 isterial, and industrial lines.
 A "super-elite" is composed
 of top graduates who have suc-
 cessfully passed a stiff exam-
 ination to become inspectors
 of finance.   This group--which
 includes Premier Felix Gaillard--
 is particularly  influential
 in major public and private
 financial circles.
 The state professional
 schools have an annual enroll-
 ment of approximately 15,000.

 CURRENT' INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 November 1957
 Most of France's top public
 administrators are likely, how-
 ever, to be alumni of a select
 group of graduate schools--in-
 cliding the Polytechnic School,
 $2 percent of whose graduates
 are in the government service,
 the "Graduate Normal School, and
 the National School of Adminis-
 tration.   The last is an in-
 stitution set up in 1954 to
 train specifically for public
 service a rigorously selected
 group of students.
 The influence of the top
 administrative elite is par-
 ticularly important in such key
 assignments as the personal
 staffs of the President of the
 republic and the premier.   The
 two top men serving President
 Coty--Charles Merveilleux du
 Vignaux and Henri Friol--have
 had distinguished careers, in-
 cluding service in the cabinets
 of other French political lead-
 ers.  His military adviser,
 General Ganeval, has figured
 prominently in reports of Coty's
 political contacts with General
 de Gaulle.
 The influence of the grad-
 uates of the specialized schools
 in public administration is
 heightened by the large number
 of their fellows who have built
 up successful political careers.
 Mendes-France's performance in
 the field of finance led direct-
 ly to his political prominence,
 and Gaillard's standing as an
 inspector of finance was an
 obvious asset 4n his investi-
 ture on 5 Noveber.
 A number of former premiers
 and present first-rank polit-
 ical leaders such as Edgar Faure,
 Robert Schuman, Guy Mollet, and
 Bourges-Maunoury are graduates
 of the top professional schools,
 as are Coty and Finance Minister
 Pflimlin.   Strategic diplomatic
 posts are usually filled by
 alumni of these schools.  Herve
 Alphand, ambassador to Washing-
 ton, Jean Chauvel, ambassador to
 London, and Maurice Couve de
 Murville, ambassador to Bonn,
 are examples.
 The frequency of political
 crises because of financial and
 economic issues has given spe-
 cialists in these fields quasi-
 political influence.  Directors
 of the budget, taxes, foreign
 exchange, and the treasury are
 inspectors of finance, as is
 the governor of the Bank of
 France, Wilfrid Baumgartner.
 Since most recent governments
 have felt the pinch of finan-
 cial necessity, Baumgartner has
 had ,a major voice in determining
 whether or not a bank advance
 would be granted.   Public loans
 require the approval of Treasury
 Director Pierre-Paul Schweitzer,
 and Budget Director Gilbert De-
 vaux occupies a strategic posi-
 tion in governments chronically
 in financial difficulties.
 The national importance
 of the bureaucratic elite is
 further enhanced by the number
 of key industrial and business
 firms controlled by members of
 the same educational fraternity.
 Aircraft manufacturer Marcel
 Dassault, whose company makes
 the Mystere, Jean Marie, presi-
 dent of the Companie Generale
 Transatlantique, and automobile
 manufacturers Jean-Pierre
 Peugeot and Pierre Dreyfus of
 the Renault Company all bear the
 "elite" stamp.
 Control Over Government Policy
 With permanent officials
 of this stature, a minister's
 powers within his own ministry
 are limited.   Should he move
 too far or too fast, the career
 staff can usually slow him down
 by strict adherence to regula-
 tions which immobilize him in
 red tape.   This check on'policy
 is strengthened by the tradi-
 tional political complexion
 taken on by individual minis-
 tries despite the merit system.
 The political right, for example,
 is strong in the armed services
 and the Paris Prefecture of

 Police, while the center strong-
 ly influences the Interior and
 Foreign Affairs Ministries.
 Mendes-France, when pre-
 mier, soon ran afoul of a num-
 ber of these limitations on
 his power.   Initially scornful
 of the expertise of the Foreign
 Ministry's career staff, which
 he regarded as too much under
 the influence of the Popular
 Republicans who had controlled
 the ministry for a decade, he
 was forced to follow their guid-
 ance before his tenure vnded.
 Meanwhile, his reshuffling of
 its personnel to,promote those
 who favoredhis policies aroused
 a 'violent campaign  against him
 which shook the confidence of
 his supporters and France's
 allies.
 In the early days of the
 Mollet government, career of-
 ficials in the Quai d'Orsay
 were successful in resisting
 French disarmament delegate
 Jules Moch's tendency to exceed
 his instructions in East-West
 disarmament talks and in toning
 down the repercussions in French
 policy of ideas for increasing
 'East-West. eontae'ts launc.hed `by
 :Foreign Minster Pineau without
 consultation with the ministry.
 French government admin-
 istration, despite its capable
 elite, suffers, however, from
 bureaucratic sluggishness in
 responding to-new requirements.
 A wave of political strikes led
 the Ministry of the Interior
 to create the rank of "super-
 prefect" to ensure unity of
 command in the internal security
 forces under civil authority.
 Reforms of long-range importance
 are now being undertaken by the
 Foreign Ministry, which is still
 organized along outdated lines,
 with more consulates in Italy
 than the United States.   It is
 overloaded with top grades,
 whose incumbents'have the
 privilege of refusing to serve
 in undesirable. posts, and it
 -deceives only a trickle of new
 blood from the National 'School
 of Administration.   Secretary
 General Louis Joxe has begun
 to make changes, -however, and
 an extensive  reorganization
 is  inprospect.
 Agriculture and Industry
 Economic conditions were
 favorable in Taiwan throughout
 the past year, and industry an
 the island continued its steady
 expansion.   The agricultural
 crop year 1956-57 was a record,
 one, and the high price of
 sugar on the world market
 brought the Nationalist govern-
 ment much-needed foreign ex-,
 change.   Two new fertilizer
 plants began production, and
 expansion of the transportation,
 chemical, fertilizer, and min-
 ing industries continued at a
 rate of from 5 to 10. percent
 per year.
 The gross national product
 continued to increase at a more
 rapid rate than the population,
 'now around 10,000,000.   The
 limited amount of available
 arable land will, however, force
 Taiwan--already a net importer
 of grain--to develop in the
 relatively near future light in-
 dustries based on export markets

 Inflation

 Inflation has continued
 despite economic growth, and
 the cost-of-living index--based
 on 1952 levels--rose nearly 10
 percent between October 1956
 and October 1957.  This increase,
 which has been slow and steady,
 has generated considerable pres-
 sure from underpaid military
 and government officials for
 wage raises.   Some relief for
 these individuals will probably
 be forthcoming, but this in it-
 '~wierc
 self will create additional in-
 flationary pressure.
 This creeping inflation
 stems largely from the govern-
 ment's failure to budget re-
 sources realistically and its
 attempt to expand simultaneously
 its military forces, private
 consumption, and investment.
 The budgetary imbalance for fis-
 cal 1957 will be about $25,000,-
 000 if planned expenditures are
 not reduced.   Defense expendi-
 tures will total more that.50
 percent of the national budget.
 Foreign Trade and Investment
 In 1956'the Chinese Nation-
 alist government, with American
 support, began a much-publicized
 campaign to increase foreign
 trade with Southeast Asia and
 to promote foreign investments
 on Taiwan.   It was hoped that
 Nationalist prestige could be
 boosted and export markets ex-
 panded to help reduce the is-
 land's deficit in international
 transactions, which since 1951
 has remained substantially un-
 changed at approximately $75,-
 000,000 per year.   Committees
 were established within the gov-
 ernment and some tentative steps

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 14 November 1957
 were taken to simplify entry
 and exit regulations, but the
 principal motive of the Nation-
 alists was propagandistic rather
 than economic.
 Officials have admitted
 that the measure of Nationalist
 interest in specific trade proj-
 ects is usually the extent to
 which the United States will
 underwrite them.  The National-
 ists have indicated reluctance
 to allocate their own resources
 to the Southeast Asian program
 and permit a diversion of exist-
 ing American aid.   They do not
 accept the American view that
 each project must be economical-
 ly feasible.
 They also have been reluc-
 tant to consider seriously sug-
 gestions to abolish Taiwan's
 complicated system of multiple
 exchange rates, which must be
 altered before extensive trade
 and foreign investment projects
 can begin.  They argue that the
 differential in the rates fur-
 nishes an important segment of
 government revenue, and that
 inflationary pressure would be
 heightened if the artificially
 high rates were reduced to lev-
 els which would make buying and
 selling on international mar-
 kets possible.
 A basic hostility to for-
 eign investment exists among
 some members of the government,
 particularly in the legislature.
 Repeated demands have been made
 to investigate the circumstances
 of a contract leasing the facil-
 ities of the government-owned
 Taiwan Shipbuilding Company to
 an American syndicate to build
 two 36,000-ton supertankers.
 Although the contract appears
 to be sound from a financial
 viewpoint and successful com-
 pletion of the project would
 greatly aid the economy and pres-
 tige of Nationalist China, so
 much xenophobic opposition has
 appeared that it is problemati-
 cal whether the venture can be
 carried out.  Preparation  for
 construction of the tankers
 has already fallen behind sched-
 ule.  Foreign Minister George
 Yeh has stated that the Chinese
 fear exploitation by "rich for-
 eigners" and are reluctant to
 offer "even partial ownership
 of companies to foreign invest-
 ment."
 Future Prospects
 Little progress can thus
 be made in expanding foreign
 trade and increasing foreign
 investments in.the foreseeable
 future.  A basic change in at-
 titude on the part of the gov-
 ernment and Chiang Kai-shek is
 necessary before progress can
 be made in reducing Taiwan's
 balance-of-payments deficit.
 Conversely, the island will con-
 tinue to require American aid
 to make good the imbalance.
 Given present levels of
 American aid, the prospects are
 good for the next few years for
 continued progress and relative
 stability in the Taiwan economy.
 It should be possible to hold
 inflation within bounds and
 maintain the armed forces at
 their present strengths.   In
 the future, however, as the
 population increases, the de-
 velopment of additional export
 industries will be necessary,
 requiring a revision of the
 present attitudes of government
 officials.   Development of an
 economy capable of functioning
 without American aid would be
 virtually impossible unless         25X1
 the size of the armed forces
 were reduced.
