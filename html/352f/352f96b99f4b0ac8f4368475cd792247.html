 LEBANON /-Z"'
 Syrian President Asad this week still
 appeared determined to bring to heel his
 leftist and Palestinian adversaries in
 Lebanon  despite  mounting pressure
 against his policy from Iraq, the Arab
 League, and detractors at home. After
 meeting unexpectedly stiff resistance early
 in the week, Syrian intervention forces
 finally gained control of most of central
 Lebanon and of the major access routes to
 Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon. Damascus
 continued to play along with separate Li-
 byan and Arab. League mediation efforts
 while effectively stalling both initiatives to
 gain time to resupply its forces and con-
 solidate their positions.
 The murder on June 16 of the US am-
 bassador and economic counselor in
 Lebanon will be viewed by Asad as in
 large part an anti-Syrian act and will lead
 him to review carefully his next step in
 Lebanon. Any new Syrian initiatives
 appear unlikely until after the Syrian
 leader returns from a three-day visit to
 France that began on June 17. Asad's
 decision to undertake the scheduled
 trip-he did cut planned stops in Eastern
 Europe-was in part a gesture of con-
 fidence in his domestic position.
 In Lebanon
 Damascus continued to funnel ad-
 ditional troops into Lebanon over the past
 week as the Syrians moved to reinforce
 and improve their positions outside
 Tripoli, Beirut, and Sidon. They also ex-
 tended their control over most of the
 Bekaa Valley. Over 17,000 regular Syrian
 troops have been committed to the
 Lebanon operation since early March.
 About 12,000 troops are in Lebanon, and
 5,000 others are in support or reserve
 25X1
 roles in adjacent border areas.
 Syrian units directly involved include
 virtually an entire armored division, an in-
 fantry brigade, two infantry battalions,
 seven commando battalions, an SA-6 sur-
 face-to-air missile brigade, plus combat
 and service support units. Most of this
 force is concentrated in the central art of
 the country
 After initial heavy clashes with their
 adversaries,  the  Syrians established
 blockades of Sidon, Tripoli, and lef-
 tist-held territory in west Beirut. Syrian
 and Syrian-controlled Saiqa Palestinian
 units  at  Khaldah  dominate  the
 southwestern and eastern approaches to
 the capital-including the Beirut airport.
 Concerned by the heavy losses suffered
 by Syrian troops trying to take Sidon late
 last week, Damascus has since concen-
 trated on sealing off major supply routes
 and establishing its control over the coun-

 tryside. Syrian troops gained ground in
 the north as well as in the Bekaa Valley,
 where they managed to disarm, arrest, or
 co-opt many of their leftist and Palesti-
 nian opponents.
 The Syrians continue to  proceed
 cautiously in areas close to the Israeli
 border. So far they have advanced no
 farther south than Rashayya, where they
 apparently have captured a stronghold of
 the rebel Lebanese Arab Army.
 The Israelis have apparently not been
 unduly alarmed by Syria's action in the
 south and seem to hold to their previous
 25X1    assessment that Israel's security is not
 threatened by the Syrian moves. Israeli
 leaders are watching the situation closely

 of the beleaguered Palestinians and
 probably also over Syria's withdrawal of
 some of its forces along the Golan
 Heights to meet its military requirements
 in Lebanon and along the Iraqi border.
 Major elements from two divisions,
 several independent brigades, and two
 SA-6 missile brigades have been
 withdrawn from the Heights-leaving
 Syrian troop strength there at the lowest
 level since the October 1973 war.
 On the diplomatic front, President
 Asad has managed so far to finesse the in-
 terference of other Arab states with his
 actions. Arab League Secretary General
 Riyad has been shuttling between Beirut
 and Damascus throughout the week try-
 ing to arrange the launching of a joint
 Arab security force, but so far has made
 little progress. Riyad has admitted that no
 action has yet been taken to define even
 the size of the peace-keeping force and
 that it will not be deployed until a cease-
 fire is established and all parties agree on
 the composition of the forces.
 This is tantamount to conceding that
 the Arab League can do nothing without
 Syrian approval,
 no  Libyan,
 Algerian, or Sudanese peace-keeping con-
 tingents have entered Lebanon.
 Libyan Prime Minister Jallud's mission
 has fared only slightly better than
 Riyad's. Only loosely coordinating his ef-
 fort with Riyad, Jallud has been trying to
 arrange terms for a cease-fire that are
 acceptable to the Syrians, Christians, and
 the Palestinian-leftist coalition.

 The Syrians have played along with
 Jallud's mission, hoping to win political
 credit for seeming to be conciliatory.
 They apparently have tentatively agreed
 to his plan for the phased withdrawal of
 Syrian forces, but may have imposed stiff
 conditions on the timing of the pullback.
 The Syrians have probably encouraged
 the Christians-who only this week gave
 their approval for the joint Arab
 force-to impose similarly difficult con-
 ditions. The Christians said they would
 accept the force only if it merely
 cooperates with, rather than replaces,
 Syrian forces, does not include
 Palestinians, and takes on as its principal
 task the enforcement of the 1969 Cairo
 agreement restricting Palestinian ac-
 tivities in Lebanon.
 All of these conditions are opposed
 strenuously by the Palestinians, led by
 Yasir Arafat's Fatah group, and
 Lebanese leftists. Both groups-despair-
 ing of any help from either Jallud or the
 Arab League-appealed directly this
 week to Egypt, Iraq, and several other
 Arab states for assistance.
 Iraqi-Syrian Tensions
 In an attempt to exploit Damascus'
 preoccupation with Lebanon, Baghdad
 President Asad
 25X1
 since the middle of last week has amassed
 sizable new forces in the proximity of the
 Syrian border. The pressure on its eastern
 border has caused Damascus to send a
 substantial force to that area also.
 Syrians have sent three armored brigades
 to the border area in addition to an SA-6
 brigade-a total of some 12,000 men.
 Some Syrian forces probably have been
 sent to the Euphrates Dam and others to
 the Palmyra area in central Syria. These
 are the two most likely avenues of ad-
 vance should Iraqi troops be ordered into
 action.                       25X1
 Jordan has placed its armed forces on
 alert
 The military moves, together with a
 marked increase in the stridency of Iraqi
 public statements against Syria
 significantly raised the level of tension
 between the two rival Baathist regimes.
 Baghdad gave public and private
 assurances, however, that its forces would
 not enter Syria without Damascus' per-
 mission-which almost certainly would
 not be granted. There will continue to be
 some danger that miscalculation by one
 side or the other may lead to a clash
 between the forces opposing each other
 along the border.
 Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn realizes
 that an Iraqi invading force would come
 under immediate Syrian air attack despite
 Syria's heavy involvement in Lebanon.
 Baghdad may also be aware of Jordan's
 commitment to assist Syria in the event of
 an Iraqi attack, a factor that would
 further constrain Iraqi leaders.
 Baghdad, nonetheless, still shows no
 sign that it is ready to return units
 OC1
 deployed in western Iraq to their bases.
 The Iraqis may see advantages in keeping
 these forces in place for some time, hop-
 ing to relieve Syrian military pressure on
 the leftists and Palestinians in Lebanon
 and to encourage Asad's domestic op-
 ponents to move against him. The Iraqis
 make little effort to hide their determina-
 tion to try to topple the Asad regime.
 Asad's Problems
 Syrian President Asad has canceled
 part of his visit to Europe late this week so
 that he can return more quickly to
 Damascus to deal with his pressing
 problems in Lebanon, with Iraq, and at
 home. His first move presumably will be
 to review Syrian policy toward Lebanon
 following the assassination of Am-
 bassador Meloy and Counselor Waring
 on June 16. Asad may be tempted to use
 the killings as an excuse to push harder
 for a military solution to the crisis, par-
 ticularly if he has become convinced that
 Libyan mediators will be unable to secure
 Palestinian agreement to Syria's terms for
 ending their confrontation.
 Iraq's military moves also demand
 close attention by Asad. The Syrians ap-
 parently still believe that Baghdad does
 not intend to attack Syria, but surely are

 War damage in Beirut
 concerned that the necessity to protect    down by critics of Asad's policy in
 against such a contingency has forced      Lebanon. Bombs placed by unknown per-
 them to move several thousand troops to                  sons exploded at two locations in the
 eastern Syria. Similarly, although Asad    capital on June 15.
 shows no signs of being concerned that his25X1 At this time, Palestinian and leftist
 position is being undermined by the Ira-
 qis' propaganda barrage, he almost cer-
 tainly is apprehensive that his domestic
 critics will be encouraged by the possibili-
 ty of more active Iraqi help to increase
 their dissident activities.
 Syrian officials have attempted to seize
 on the external threat from Iraq to elicit
 greater popular support for Asad and his
 policies. They appear to have made little
 progress, however; there continue to be
 signs of dissatisfaction both among
 civilians and within the armed forces. A
 meeting of a Damascus area Baath Party
 unit last week reportedly "broke up in
 chaos" after party leaders were shouted
 claims that a Syrian army unit protesting
 its assignment to Lebanon mutinied on
 June 14 cannot be confirmed
 The
 Syrian army's autonomous Defense Com-
 panies, which are primarily responsible
 for internal security, carried out "annual
 exercises" on June 14 also, but no
 evidence is available that this activity was
 in response to a perceived security threat.
 Soviet Reaction
 The USSR has responded to continued
 Syrian military activity in Lebanon by
 strengthening its ties to the Palestine
 Liberation Organization. It may also be
 trying to put indirect pressure on the
 Syrians to disengage.
 Last Friday the USSR announced that
 the long-awaited permanent represen-
 tative of the PLO had been received in
 Moscow by officials of the Soviet Afro-A-
 sian Solidarity Committee. The establish-
 ment of a PLO office in Moscow had been
 pending for almost two years, and the
 Soviet decision to permit its opening at
 this time seems to be a calculated nod
 toward the Palestinians.
 Although the Soviets continue to avoid
 direct criticism of Damascus, they are
 now siding more openly with the PLO in
 their media coverage of the fighting in
 Lebanon. They have even repeated one
 comment by Libyan leader Qadhafi
 suggesting that the Palestinians are more
 important  than  the  Syrians.        25X1

 FTAI     ~l   /'
 France has reached an agreement with
 the three principal political groups in the
 French Territory of the Afars and Issas
 that Paris-perhaps unrealistically-
 hopes will lead to the formation of
 a government better able to  resist
 Somalia's ambitions to annex the ter-
 ritory when it becomes independent.
 The new arrangements, which provide
 for a government of national unity, vir-
 tually assure that the Issas and other
 Somalia.
 ethnic Somalis-who constitute a majori-
 ty of the population-will dominate the
 next elected government. Until now,
 Afars have held sway because of French
 favoritism and discriminatory laws.
 Ali Aref Bourhan, the Afar president of
 the local assembly, bitterly opposed the
 agreement. He is almost certain to fall
 from power in the next few months.
 Members of Aref's party signed the agree-
 ment against his wishes.
 France's willingness to cut its ties to
 Aref and to give in to Issa demands for a
 greater role in territorial politics will
 probably ease political unrest temporari-
 ly. It is unlikely to ensure a peaceful tran-
 sition to independence, however. Somali
 President Siad will almost certainly con-
 tinue trying to incorporate the territory
 into a "greater Somalia." Any govern-
 ment in Djibouti that is not clearly com-
 mitted to that goal will be the target of a
 campaign of subversion backed by
 Mogadiscio.
 Ethiopia views the new arrangement as
 a threat to its interests. Addis Ababa
 believes that France has paved the way for
 Somalia to gain control of Djibouti, the
 terminus of Ethiopia's principal rail link
 to the sea. The Ethiopians, who have close
 ties to Aref, will probably support Afar
 dissidents in order to try to prevent the
 Issas from turning the territory over to
 ETHIOPIA     J Z
 The ruling military council apparently
 has canceled plans to use armed peasants
 against Eritrean insurgents. Some peasant
 units may already have been withdrawn
 from the southern Eritrean border, where
 they began assembling several weeks ago.
 Others will probably remain in defensive
 positions as one source of pressure on the
 guerrillas to begin negotiations.
 Addis Ababa backed down after en-
 countering a host of practical difficulties
 in organizing the peasant forces and
 because of strong pressure from Arab and

 Western countries to call off the cam-
 paign.
 Many council members reportedly have
 blamed Major Mengistu and Lieutenant
 Colonel Atnafu, the ruling group's two
 vice chairmen, for the failure of the
 peasants' march. Mengistu also has been
 harshly criticized by some council
 members for failing to obtain arms from
 communist countries and for pushing
 policies that have caused food shortages
 and inflation, heightened Arab enmity,
 and alienated some of Ethiopia's
 traditional allies.
 Last week, contact, albeit. indirect, was
 apparently resumed between the govern-
 ment and insurgents for the first time in
 many months. Representatives of the
 military wing of the Popular Liberation
 Forces-one of the two major factions of
 the rebel movement-reportedly met with
 a group of traditional Eritrean leaders
 selected by Addis Ababa to act as in-
 termediaries.

 MAURITANIA 1?,- I0
 Guerrillas of the Polisario Front-the
 Algerian-backed Saharan group seeking
 independence for Western Sahara-at-
 tacked  Nouakchott, the Mauritanian
 capital, twice on June 8, adding to earlier
 indications that the front is stepping up its
 efforts in Mauritania to undermine Presi-
 dent Moktar Ould Daddah's agreement
 with the Moroccans partitioning the
 former Spanish colony.
 The principal target of the guerrillas
 was the presidential compound; it receiv-
 ed several hits but suffered little damage.
 Mauritanian  security forces quickly
 repulsed the main attack and reportedly
 killed or captured most of the raiders in
 skirmishes on June 9 and 10 some 100
 kilometers (60 miles) north of the city.
 The leader, who was among those killed,
 was subsequently identified as the front's
 secretary general, Mohamed el Ouali.
 Mauritanian officials are playing up the
 success of the security forces in an effort
 to offset any psychological gains the
 guerrillas may have won from their daring
 attacks. Both publicly and privately, the
 officials are denouncing Algiers, which
 continues to furnish essential material

 The guerrillas may well attack
 Nouakchott again-although perhaps not
 for a while. The front, whose units have
 been pressed hard by the Moroccans in
 southern  Morocco and northern
 Mauritania as well as in Western Sahara,
 is trying to portray itself as a viable force
 and to create pressure on Ould Daddah to
 consider some accommodation.  The
 front's strategy is probably influenced in
 part by a belief that there is significant la-
 tent support for an independent Sahara
 among elements of Mauritania's popula-
 tion, especially Reguibat tribesmen whose
 kinsmen predominate in Western Sahara
 and within the Polisario Front. Large

 ITALY
 / ~, Z, ~
 Exchanges  between  Italy's political
 parties were increasingly blunt and bitter
 during the final days of the election cam-
 paign that closes officially today. The
 Communists appear to be making a major
 last-minute effort to convince wavering
 voters that the party would not radically
 alter Italian foreign policy.
 The Christian Democrats are hammer-
 ing harder than ever on their basic cam-
 paign theme that Communist accession to
 power would weaken Italy's Western ties
 and its democratic system. In doing so,
 the Christian Democrats have abandoned
 their past tendency to balance these
 charges by noting the Communists'
 "responsible" behavior in some areas of
 domestic policy.
 For their part, the Communists-who
 hope to draw the Christian Democrats
 into some form of collaboration after the
 vote-are stepping up their attacks on the
 Christian Democratic Party, and no
 longer tend to spare the party's left wing,
 which had been receiving gentler treat-
 ment because of its advocacy of a
 "dialogue" with the Communists.
 Communist chief Berlinguer, in an in-

 terference. Berlinguer said he felt "more
 secure" in NATO than he would outside
 the Western alliance and suggested that
 his party would not be able to pursue an
 independent path if Italy were aligned
 with the Soviet bloc.
 The Communists have previously ex-
 plained their acceptance of Italian
 membership in NATO by saying that they
 favor the eventual dissolution of both
 NATO and the Warsaw Pact but do not
 want to upset the European balance of
 power in the meantime by pulling Italy
 out of NATO.
 Berlinguer's decision to emphasize so
 explicitly his differences with Moscow
 appears to signal a concern on his part
 that the Christian Democrats may be
 making headway in their campaign to
 raise fears among Italians about the con-
 sequences of voting Communist.
 Berlinguer's statement is likely, however,
 to draw criticism from militants in his
 own party. (Fuller analysis of the Italian
 election campaign appears on page 11.)
 SPAIN
 Last week the government suffered its
 first setback in pushing its reform
 program through parliament. Rightist op-
 position to a bill amending the penal code
 led to its being sent back to committee for
 redrafting.
 The code must be amended to remove
 penalties for political activities following
 earlier passage of a bill ending the
 37-year-ban on political parties. The
 government is urging quick action so that
 the revisions can be debated in parliament
 by July 1.
 The rightist attack on revisions to the
 penal code was followed by a further show
 of resistance in the National Council-the
 ruling body of the Francoist National
 Movement. The council rejected a sub-
 committee report favorable to the
 government's proposal to establish a
 bicameral legislature-the key to the en-
 tire reform program-because it con-
 tained a recommendation that 40 seats set
 aside for National Council members in
 the proposed new senate be eliminated.
 The government's referendum proposal
 on royal succession was also amended to
 require future monarchs to swear loyalty
 to the principles of the National Move-
 ment.
 The council may ultimately propose
 further changes in the referendum bill that
 would be unacceptable to the government.
 The council's opinion is not binding on the
 government, but a determined stand by
 these Francoist holdovers-who are also
 members of parliament-could seriously
 complicate the reform effort. A high
 government official has said that the
 government will have to resort to heavy
 pressure to get its program approved by
 parliament.
 Rightist intrigue may also be responsi-
 ble for the latest flareup of dissension in
 the cabinet. The reform-minded informa-
 tion minister has threatened to resign if
 the government gives in to demands to
 close down Spain's largest weekly
 newsmagazine, Cambio 16, which has
 criticized the slow pace of reform and
 published stories of alleged police torture
 of prisoners. Some cabinet ministers have
 reportedly recommended a four-month
 suspension of the magazine, ostensibly for
 publishing an unflattering cartoon of King
 Juan Carlos in white tie and tails dancing
 on the skyscrapers of New York.
 MBFR   Z 6, Z
 For the first time in the MBFR
 negotiations, the Soviets last week pro-
 vided data-albeit incomplete-on the
 strength of the Warsaw Pact forces. The
 Soviet action can be expected to help give
 new life to the negotiations, but the
 figures themselves are tailored to support
 the Soviets' long-standing position that
 Warsaw Pact and NATO forces are
 roughly equal and that, therefore, any
 force reductions should be about equal.
 The Soviet figures give the overall
 strength of the Warsaw Pact forces in the
 NATO Guidelines Area-which includes
 East  Germany,  Poland,  and
 Czechoslovakia-as 987,300 men, in-
 cluding 805,000 in the ground forces. This
 figure is 144,000 lower than the NATO
 estimate for Warsaw Pact ground forces.
 The Soviets appear to have excluded cer-
 tain noncombat forces and used
 definitions of forces not accepted by the
 West.
 The Soviets have not yet presented their
 estimate of NATO strength. According to
 NATO estimates, the Warsaw Pact
 ground forces in the NATO Guidelines
 Area outnumber Western troops by about
 160,000. It is expected that the Soviet
 data will show a smaller disparity between
 Warsaw Pact and NATO ground forces
 than do Western figures. The West con-
 tends that, because Warsaw Pact forces in
 the NATO Guidelines Area are larger
 than NATO's, there should be an
 asymmetrical reduction leading to a com-
 mon ceiling of about 700,000 for the
 ground forces of each side.
 Allied discussions of the significance of
 the Soviet move and of future Western
 negotiating strategy are to take place in
 Brussels this week. There is general agree-
 ment that the West should concentrate
 now on probing Eastern methods of count-
 ing their forces. It is expected that this
 approach will provide an avenue for deter-
 mining whether the Soviets now intend to
 begin serious bargaining, since the forces
 included or excluded from the totals for
 each side will determine how much of a
 disparity the two sides have to deal with in
 reaching an agreement.
 Some European representatives will be
 seeking new assurances that the US will
 protect their interests. The Germans in re-
 cent months have been seeking to meet
 with US representatives to ensure that
 Washington remains firm in its opposition
 to an agreement with the East specifying
 the level and composition of West Euro-
 pean armed forces remaining after the
 reductions. A meeting of representatives
 from Bonn, London, and Washington is25X1
 scheduled for early July, but the Soviet
 move means the allies may now raise
 these matters in Brussels.

 POCA       ST GERMANY
 Polish party leader Gierek's successful
 visit to West Germany last week was
 another step toward normalization of
 relations between historic adversaries.
 Gierek did, however, refuse to state, as
 the Germans had urged, that the visit
 symbolized a final and full reconciliation.
 The two sides signed a variety of
 cultural and political agreements, in-
 cluding a joint declaration calling for an-
 nual consultations between the foreign
 ministers. The primary interest, however,
 was in economic matters. An economic
 cooperation agreement and 14 commer-
 cial agreements-valued at $1.2
 billion-were signed. Projects included
 provision of certain raw materials and the
 building  of a coal gasification plant in
 Poland.
 Gierek was genuinely moved at the warm
 reception he received from the German
 people.
 How successful the Gierek visit was will
 become more apparent as the agreements
 are implemented. Bonn has complained in
 the past that Warsaw is more interested in
 signing agreements than in bringing them
 to fruition.

 Army chief Eanes' presidential cam-
 paign in Portugal picked up steam last
 week when he gave a strong performance
 in a televised debate among the four can-
 didates still in the field.
 Eanes, as the front-runner, was the
 center of the debate, and he was a more
 aggressive and articulate adversary than
 the other candidates expected. Prime
 Minister Azevedo, whose poorly financed
 campaign has barely gotten off the
 ground, will suffer the most from Eanes'
 performance. Azevedo was counting on
 the contrast between the two personalities
 to put him on top.
 Eanes still cannot be sure that he will
 win a majority in the first round on June
 27. A poll taken two weeks ago by a
 respected weekly newspaper showed that
 Eanes was favored by 33 percent of the
 respondents, but nearly 40 percent were
 undecided or declined to answer.
 Although Azevedo and far left candidate
 Otelo de Carvalho trailed far behind the
 front-runner, the poll showed they both
 were still slightly better known than
 Eanes.
 Some of Eanes' more conservative sup-
 porters are concerned that his political
 views are being dictated by the Socialists.
 The centrist Popular Democrats-who
 will tacitly support a Socialist minority
 government as long as they are given the
 opportunity to exercise some influence on
 policy-were alarmed by Eanes' recent
 assertion that a minority government
 that the visit will boost I:he prospects of

 CHINA ?C'3 7     4/
 The health of Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 has apparently deteriorated to the point
 where he will no longer see foreign
 visitors. I n an attempt to spread the word
 abroad, a Chinese official told Western
 news agencies of a central committee
 decision to stop arranging audiences with
 Mao because of his advanced age and
 alleged workload. The President of
 Madagascar left China earlier this week
 without seeing the Chairman, the first
 head of state to be denied such a meeting
 in over a year.
 Mao's health has seemed to decline
 rapidly in recent months. His meetings
 with foreigners were limited to about fif-
 teen minutes.
 Mao's condition is probably such that
 he could die before the end of the year,
 and Chinese leaders seem keenly aware of
 this possibility. A member of the central
 committee reportedly said in this connec-
 tion that "anything could happen" at any
 time and remarked in another context
 that there would be a drastic change in the
 Chinese leadership this autumn. It is
 possible that he was linking a major
 leadership change to the Chairman's fail-
 ing health.
 Political maneuvering and infighting
 within the sharply divided leadership seem
 likely to intensify in the coming months,
 especially  if-as could well  be the
 case-Mao himself cannot function in a
 decision-making role. Both sides in the
 current political campaign, which has
 been idling in recent weeks, will probably
 try to claim Mao's support.
 In this competition, physical access to
 the Chairman becomes increasingly im-
 portant. Two women who appeared
 regularly with Mao at his meetings with
 foreigners since early 1972 have been ex-
 cluded from more recent meetings. Their
 place has been taken by a new interpreter
 who lacks party stature and may not en-
 joy the almost unlimited access to Mao
 that his predecessors seemed to possess.
 Access to Mao is already a sensitive issue:
 the new interpreter was not mentioned in
 Chinese accounts of the meetin s he took
 part   in   with   Mao.

 INDIA-USSR         iz-v  17
 Indian Prime Minister Gardhi's state
 visit to the USSR last week seems to have
 been a huge public relations success, but it
 remains to be seen just how much
 progress was made in ironing out some of
 the problems that have recently been
 troubling bilateral relations.
 The Soviets gave Gandhi a reception
 matched only by that accorded former
 President Nixon in 1972; Gandhi's warm
 response about the value of India's ties
 with the USSR must have been especially
 gratifying to leaders still shaken by the
 latest Soviet setbacks in the Middle East.
 In the joint declaration issued at the
 end of the visit, the language echoed re-
 cent Soviet calls for the abolition of
 foreign bases in the Indian Ocean, but on
 the Asian collective security idea, the In-
 dians did not go beyond the position they
 had taken in 1973. There was no specific
 reference in the communique to China or
 Bangladesh, an indication of Moscow's
 displeasure over India's recent gestures
 toward Peking.
 The communique suggests that
 Moscow was at least partially responsive
 to Indian suggestions for reordering
 priorities in bilateral economic coopera-
 tion. The Soviets, for example, apparently
 agreed to export more of the kinds of
 commodities India wants and to explore
 avenues for cooperation in third coun-
 tries.
 Gandhi said during the visit that the dif-
 ficult ruble-rupee exchange problem had
 been left to the experts. This may be true,
 but on the eve of the visit, the two sides
 tried unsuccessfully to iron out their
 differences, and it appeared that only a
 high-level political decision could break
 the impasse.
 We know of no new military aid
 agreements that resulted from the visit,
 but negotiations for a number of items are
 in progress, and it is likely that some new
 contracts will  be signed.            25X1

 URUGUAY The Uruguayan armed forces high
 command is moving quickly to restruc-
 ture the government following President
 Bordaberry's ouster last weekend.
 Interim President Alberto Demichelli,
 an 80-year-old former law professor, has
 announced he will serve only two or three
 months. Then, a newly formed "Council
 of the Nation"-composed of senior
 military officers, cabinet ministers, and
 conservative civilian leaders-will elect a
 new chief executive.
 Front-runners for the post are Foreign
 Minister   Juan  Carlos  Blanco and
 Economy Minister Alejandro Vegh
 Villegas. Both men have done well in their
 cabinet positions and have managed to
 maintain good relations with top military
 leaders.
 The new president, like his predecessors
 Bordaberry and Demichelli, will be a
 figurehead. Armed forces leaders will rule
 by issuing "institutional acts" and will
 restructure the country's political system
 in a step-by-step process over the next
 eight to ten years.
 During this period a new constitution
 will be drafted and a plebis';ite held to
 ratify it. Political parties a:id labor un-
 ions-except  for  Marxist  organiza-
 tions-will  gradually  be  allowed a
 limited role in government.
 The reorganization of the political
 system is an ambitious undertaking, par-
 ticularly for a group of military leaders
 who have not worked well together in the
 past. If the reorganization is to progress
 smoothly,  Demichelli's successor will
 have to accept the fact that he is a
 figurehead  president.  It was  the
 strong-willed Bordaberry's inability to
 play this role-though at times he
 appeared to be trying-that caused his
 constant squabbling with the generals.
 This in turn muddled the lines of executive
 authority and hampered efforts to inject
 new life into the country's long-stagnant
 economy.
 Whoever is selected as chief executive,
 the country's conservative foreign and
 domestic policies will continue in close
 step with those of military governments in
 neighboring countries. Relations with the
 United States will remain good.
 There has been almost no adverse
 public reaction to Bordaberry's ouster
 and the military's plans for a new political
 structure. The system that is evolving runs
 counter to the country's tradition of
 democratic participation, but most
 Uruguayans give higher priority to
 economic growth and domestic tranquili-

 The glamorous "informal conver-

 assembly meeting in Santiago ended on
 Friday on a positive note of friendship and
 cooperation. Now, the permanent council
 ambassadors are attempting to translate
 last week's general expressions of princi-
 pie into workable resolutions and
 proclamations. This phase of the meeting
 will last until sometime next week.
 The Latins' reaction to Secretary
 Kissinger, on balance, has been highly
 favorable. According to the US embassy
 in Santiago, the Secretary's statement on
 human rights took the proper middle
 ground, pleasing most of the delegates
 while not offending the others. The joint
 Panama-US resolution on the Panama
 Canal issue appears to have forestalled
 acrimonious debate over this potentially
 thorny question.
 Among the nettlesome issues likely to
 arise during this phase of the assembly is
 the US Trade Act, which many Latins
 feel violates the OAS charter.
 OAS reform could also be a
 troublesome item.  Most Latins want
 some assurances of Washington's com-
 mitment to cooperation in economic
 development before worrying about in-
 stitutional and structural changes of the
 OAS. The US proposals for reform
 probably will be bypassed for the time be-
 ing and sent to a study group.         25X1

 anti-US rhetoric has been minimal, and

 The national election to be held on June 20 and 21 has
 become essentially a referendum on Communist participation
 in the government. The electorate's answer is not expected to be
 clear-cut, but the Communists are likely to do well enough at
 least to strengthen their claim to some form of indirect govern-
 ment role.
 Italian voters will go to the polls on
 June 20 and 21 for what has become es-
 sentially a referendum on the Communist
 bid for a role in the government. Precise
 prediction of the outcome of this crucial
 election is impossible, but certain trends
 can be identified and a few clues to the
 likely shape of the post-election govern-
 ment can be found by comparing the
 public and private positions of the major
 parties.
 Despite scandals and the critical state
 of the Italian economy, the Christian
 Democrats appear to be holding their
 own. There is little chance, however, that
 they will recover sufficiently to regain the
 political initiative and halt the Com-
 munist advance.
 The Communists could conceivably
 lose some momentum by falling short of
 the 33.4 percent they scored in regional
 elections last year, but they will almost
 certainly exceed the 27.2 percent the party
 garnered in the 1972 parliamentary con-
 test. Whatever the outcome, the Com-
 munists will remain a potent force in
 national politics, with dominant or sub-
 stantial influence in such key sectors as
 labor, education, the media, and local
 governments.
 It was clear long before the Com-
 munists' unprecedented advance last year,
 that the party had close to a veto power
 over many government programs-par-
 ticularly those affecting economic policy.
 Even if a non-Communist government
 Italy Landmark National Election
 can be formed after the election, there will
 be heavy pressure for some kind of ac-
 commodation with the Communist Party.
 Communist restraint will be a prerequisite
 for political stability, and Communist in-
 tervention will be necessary if organized
 labor is to cooperate in an economic
 recovery effort. -
 Prediction Difficult
 Opinion polls provide only a rough
 guide to Italian elections as a result of the
 limited sample and the large percentage of
 respondents who declare themselves un-
 decided or disinterested. Nevertheless,

 Approved For Release 2008/01/31 : CIA-RDP79-00927A011300250001-1
 taken together the polls frequently suggest
 trends. Although some polls have pro-
 jected a major loss for the Christian
 Democrats and a majority for the left,
 most surveys tend to predict results
 similar to the regional elections a year ago
 in which the Christian Democrats-with
 35.3 percent-held a narrow lead over the
 Communists.
 Most expert observers--party officials,
 journalists, and Church leaders-see a
 similar outcome, predicting that the Com-
 munists will drop a percent or two and
 that the Christian Democrats will gain
 one or two percent. There is also a
 widespread belief that the Socialists will
 hold the 12 percent they scored last year
 or improve slightly on it. Among the
 smaller parties, only the fiscally conser-
 vative  Republicans are expected to
 register any gain, with the others losing by
 varying degrees.
 A variety of factors supports the conclu-
 sion suggested by the polls that the Com-
 munists will consolidate most of the gains
 they made a year ago, but that the Chris-
 tian Democrats will retain their narrow
 plurality. The Communists, for example,
 have never lost substantial numbers of
 voters they have won over. The Christian
 Democrats, on the other hand, have
 traditionally done better in national elec-
 tions than in local contests-a factor that
 could help offset any erosion in support
 the party may have suffered during the
 last year. Furthermore, the Christian
 Democrats usually do well in the five
 regions  that  did  not  hold  regional
 elections last year.
 It should be noted, however, that these
 patterns are representative of ordinary
 election years when the question of Com-
 munist entry into the government has
 been hypothetical and remote rather than
 real and immediate. The dominance of the
 Communist question in this campaign
 suggests that the traditional patterns may
 be skewed decisively by the response of
 voters to the so-called "fear factor." The
 Christian  Democrats have waged  a
 vigorous campaign designed to arouse
 fear among voters that the Communists
 would inevitably lead Italy into an
 authoritarian society linked to Moscow.
 The Communists have done everything
 short of announcing a break with the
 Soviets to convince voters otherwise, and
 the outcome will be determined by waver-
 ing voters who must resolve what Com-
 munist chief Berlinguer has called the
 "conflict between the need for change and
 the fear of novelty."
 There is no question that disgust with
 the Christian Democrats has deepened in
 the past year or that the Communists are
 seen as the major force for change, but a
 key  imponderable  is  whether these
 perceptions will be outweighed by the fear
 factor.
 Post-Election Prospects
 Whatever the outcome, the political
 choices that must be made afterward will
 not be as easy as the campaign rhetoric
 suggests.
 The Socialists
 The polarization of the campaign
 around the Christian Democrats and
 Communists has tended to obscure the es-
 sential role the Socialists will play after
 the vote. It is virtually certain that neither
 of the larger parties will receive enough
 support to form a majority without the
 Socialists.
 Seeing themselves in a pivotal position,
 the Socialists have kept nearly all of their
 post-election options open. The Socialists
 say their first preference is for the interim
 emergency government proposed by the
 Communists, in which all parties except
 the neo-fascists would participate. The
 Socialists also claim they would be willing
 to form a government with just the Com-
 munists if the two parties received a ma-
 jority and 1e Christian Democrats re-
 fused to participate. The Socialists have
 left the door open to another coalition
 with the Christian Democrats, but only on
 condition that the latter agree to involve
 the Communists formally in the formula-
 tion of government programs and seek
 Communist support in parliament.
 Despite the Socialists' professed
 preference for an emergency government
 including the Communists, a majority of
 Socialist leaders hope that a way can be
 found to form another government with
 the Christian Democrats. The Com-
 munists would be relegated to an indirect
 role. The Socialists believe this would give
 them maximum influence, while involving
 the Communists sufficiently to make
 them share public responsibility for the
 tough decisions the post-election govern-
 ment will face.
 The Communists
 There is considerable evidence that
 Communist chief Berlinguer is willing to
 settle for less than the full government
 membership he is calling for in the cam-
 paign.
 When asked during the campaign
 whether he would accept something like
 the indirect role proposed by the
 Socialists, Berlinguer did not rule it out,
 saying only that the Communists will not
 be "stooges" for another edition of the
 center-left coalition. There are in-
 dications, moreover, that before propos-
 ing actual Communist membership in an
 emergency government Berlinguer con-
 sidered proposing an indirect Communist

 SECRET
 role in such a government after the elec-
 tion. He was apparently persuaded by
 other party leaders that this would not
 make for an effective campaign.
 Berlinguer hopes to avoid a coalition
 with just the Socialists, although both he
 and Socialist chief De Martino have said
 they would form such a government if no
 other formula could be found. The Com-
 munists reportedly fear that such a
 government would provoke a hostile reac-
 tion abroad and lead to unrealistic expec-
 tations among the Communist rank and
 file. Berlinguer may even think it would
 be more difficult for the party to resist
 pressure from Moscow in such cir-
 cumstances.
 An indirect consultative role, on the
 other hand, would give Berlinguer the best
 of two worlds. It would permit the Com-
 munists a formal say in policy and
 amount to an implicit recognition of their
 potential as a governing party. At the
 same time, the Communists would be in
 the enviable position of being able to dis-
 claim responsibility when things went
 wrong.
 The Christian Democrats
 The  unequivocal  anti-communist
 posture of the Christian Democrats dur-
 ing the campaign makes it unlikely that
 the party could agree to form a govern-
 ment with the Communists immediately
 after the vote. There are signs that a
 debate is already under way among Chris-
 tian Democrats over how far to bend on
 the question of indirect Communist par-
 ticipation.
 Despite the overall anti-Communist
 cast of the Christian Democratic plat-
 form, there is language in it that clearly
 signals a willingness to accept a limited
 accord with the Communists on specific
 government programs. Some Christian
 Democratic spokesmen, such as Budget
 Minister Andreotti, have begun hinting at
 such an arrangement in their campaign
 speeches.
 The Christian Democrats do not like
 the idea of negotiating openly with the
 Communists and prefer to deal with them
 behind the scenes in parliament.
 Nevertheless,  formalized  consultations
 with the Communists might be seen as
 preferable to entering the opposition if
 that is the only alternative.
 In sum, there appears to be a degree of
 willingness in each of the three major par-
 ties to move toward a government based
 on Christian Democratic - Socialist
 collaboration but open to some form of
 indirect participation by the Communists.
 All other formulas on the table have been
 categorically rejected by at least one of
 the parties.
 Obstacles
 Agreement on the indirect participation
 formula would not come easily, however.
 In addition to disagreements between the
 Christian Democrats and Socialists over
 the role to be played by the Communists,
 there are substantial differences within
 each party on the advisability of such an
 agreement.
 The evolution toward such a com-
 promise could also be cut short by a sharp
 swing toward the Communists at the
 polls. If the Communists score a decisive
 plurality, it will be very difficult to deny
 them cabinet status. Berlinguer might
 have to settle for less if his plurality is not
 large enough to deprive the Christian
 Democrats and their traditional allies of a
 parliamentary majority. A plurality for
 the Communists, however, would create
 unprecedented  strains  among the
 traditional governing parties, and defec-
 tions to the Communists are not to be
 ruled out. Recently, for example, the So-
 cial Democrats have appeared to leave
 the door open to collaboration with the
 Communists and Socialists in an emer-
 gency government even if the Christian
 Democrats refused to go along. Thus, a
 Communist plurality might lead to an ex-
 SECRET
 Page  13
 panded leftist coalition that would leave
 the Christian Democrats in the opposi-
 tion.
 If the election fails to give any party a
 marked advantage, a caretaker govern-
 ment might be installed to preside until
 the dust settles and until party leaders
 have had time to digest the results. In that
 event, efforts to form a coalition might be
 postponed until the fall.
 On balance, the election does not seem
 likely to produce the kind of clear-cut
 result that would allow a relatively com-
 patible combination of parties to deal
 decisively with Italy's mounting economic
 and social problems. Unless the parties
 can find a way to resolve the fundamental
 differences that led them to hold the elec-
 tion ahead of schedule, the prospect is for
 continued instability and immobilism.
 For that reason, the current contest may
 well turn out to have been but a prelude to
 another election, fought on the same
 issues, in the not-too-distant future.

 The Arab inhabitants of the West Bank have become more
 openly defiant of Israeli rule.  Periodic anti-Israeli
 demonstrations are likely to become a permanent feature of the
 political landscape there. The Israeli government so far gives
 little sign that it plans major policy changes to deal with the new
 situation on the West Bank.
 Israel., The West Bank
 Relations between the Arab inhabitants
 of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
 Israel are undergoing a major transfor-
 mation as the Arabs have become more
 openly defiant of Israeli rule. Periodic an-
 ti-Israeli demonstrations, any of which
 could bring new violence, appear likely to
 become a permanent feature of the West
 Bank under occupation.
 Despite the misgivings of Israelis over
 the results of the West Bank municipal
 elections in April and the unsettling effect
 of the numerous Arab demonstrations,
 the government does not appear inclined
 to revamp its policy toward the occupied
 territories.
 The new West Bank leaders, for their
 part, see growing support among Arab in-
 habitants for their positions and do not
 believe Israel will he able to hold the
 territory indefinitely. They increasingly,
 sense that time is on their side.
 The growing ferment on the West Bank
 has focused increasing attention in Israel
 on the Palestinian problem. Prime
 Minister  Rabin recently warned that
 Israel would be under great pressure next
 year to show more flexibility on the
 Palestinian issue and particularly on par-
 ticipation by the Palestine Liberation
 Organization in peace talks.
 Rabin specifically cited the outcome of
 the municipal elections as likely to be a
 major factor contributing to such
 pressure. He characterized the election
 results as "the worst defeat Israel has suf-
 fered in the last two years."
 Perspective on the Elections
 The elections brought. into office a
 group of younger, better educated, and
 largely politically inexperienced men. Of
 the 188 elected, 148 are newcomers; 70
 percent are under 50 years old, and 25
 percent have some university training.
 Most of the new leaders are more
 nationalistic than their predecessors, and
 thus more likely to challenge Israeli oc-
 cupation authorities and the old pattern of
 Israeli-Arab relations. They will be more
 inclined to resort to militant rhetoric to
 retain and expand their popular support.
 They are also likely to be more willing
 to consult and coordinate actions with
 each other, despite Israeli restrictions on
 territory-wide political activity and the in-
 ternal divisions that stem from traditional
 clan rivalries and jealously guarded local
 prerogatives.
 From the Israelis' point of view, the
 new West Bank officials will be less
 cooperative than the old ones, but not
 necessarily impossible to deal with. The
 officials do not represent a complete
 break with the conservative, local clan
 structure. The new mayor of Hebron, one
 of the West Bank's largest towns, for in-

 Israeli troops on guard in Nabulus on the
 stance, is a former Israeli government
 agronomist and a successful local
 businessman, as well as a member of one
 of the town's most powerful clans.
 There are also a number of practical
 constraints that will temper the actions, if
 not the rhetoric, of the new leaders. Their
 local constituencies will expect them to
 live up to their campaign promises to im-
 prove municipal services, which they can-
 not do without continued financial help
 from Israel and Jordan.
 Clan ties, local political rivalries, and
 vested business and property interests of
 the officials will also act as a brake on
 tendencies to implement radical policies.
 Finally, of course, the Israelis have the
 military strength to impose their will.
 The Israeli Reaction
 The widespread and often violent an-
 ti-Israeli demonstrations on the West
 Bank since February have gone a long
 way toward destroying the Israeli public's
 perception of the occupation regime as an
 enlightened government at least grudging-
 ly tolerated by the territory's Arab in-
 habitants. There appears to be little
 willingness, however, on the part of either
 the Israeli public or the Rabin govern-
 ment to reconsider the basic elements of
 Israel's West Bank policy.
 The Israelis seem to be more than ever
 convinced of the need to maintain law and
 order in the troubled area. The govern-
 ment believes that better riot control
 techniques-involving tough, well-trained
 border guard units and the use of non-
 lethal ammunition-will help accomplish
 this.
 The Israelis will concentrate on keeping
 the Arab population and local leaders
 preoccupied with parochial,  primarily
 economic, affairs. In meetings with local
 officials, the Israeli government is making
 known its intention to continue with
 business as usual, offering, for example,
 again to provide money to the financially
 strapped municipalities.
 Military government officials have also
 renewed their efforts to have the new
 West Bank administration assume wider
 civil responsibilities. Even the previous,
 more conservative leaders had resisted
 Israeli moves in this direction, arguing
 that this would play into the hands of
 Israeli efforts to undercut PLO claims to
 represent all Palestinians.
 The new West Bank leaders will
 probably soon have to face the problem of
 reconciling public pressures to stand up to
 G #1'\ ti ti &
 the Israelis  with  the necessl'ty of
 cooperating with occupation authorities
 to keep their towns functioning. In
 general, the leftist orientation of many of
 the new leaders and their desire to retain
 public support will make it more difficult
 for the Israelis to maintain order.
 The PLO, too, may come to look upon
 the new leadership with mixed emotions,
 even though it reportedly helped get some
 of its sympathizers elected. Although
 many of the new officials have hailed the
 PLO as the sole spokesman for the
 Palestinians, they may eventually come to
 regard themselves as the spokesmen for
 the 675,000 West Bank Palestinians. The
 West Bankers constitute not only the
 largest single group of Palestinians, but
 they already reside in the area considered
 by the Arabs, including the PLO, to be the
 heart of a future Palestinian state.
 One hint of such a tendency was given
 in a recent remark by a new West Bank
 mayor who claimed that the PLO fulfills
 essentially a wartime role. This suggests
 that at least some West Bank leaders
 probably do not see themselves turning
 over power to PLO emigres in the event of
 an overall Arab-Israeli peace settlement.

 Since President Marcos imposed martial law in September
 1972, he has so concentrated power in his own hands that a
 period of serious instability would almost certainly follow
 should he die or become incapacitated.
 C;?'
 Philippines: Marcos and the Power Structure
 political authority in the Philippines is
 so concentrated in the hands of President
 Ferdinand Marcos that a period of serious
 instability would almost certainly follow
 should he die or be incapacitated. He
 declared martial law in September 1972
 because he had concluded that it was the
 best option available to assure his reten-
 tion of power. His term as president
 would have expired in December, and he
 was not eligible for another.
 Martial Law Policies
 When martial law was declared, Mar-
 cos bid for public support by promising to
 use his new powers to deal with the abuses
 of the old society. He promised to reform
 the corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy,
 make the central government responsive
 to local needs, restore law and order,
 speed economic development, and end
 government by and for the wealthy
 oligarchy. The administration would be
 restructured at all levels.
 Few of the programs announced in the
 first months of martial law have been
 carried out. Despite Marcos' expanded
 powers, he is as limited as were his con-
 stitutional predecessors by the special in-
 terests of his family and of his political
 supporters.
 Marcos' failure to follow through on
 his promises of reform has not aroused
 serious discontent. The population did not
 expect him to keep his more extravagant
 promises, and most concluded that mar-
 tial law was an improvement, in some
 respects at least, over the chaotic political
 system it replaced.
 Although crimes against property con-
 tinue at a high rate, violent crime has been
 sharply reduced. The martial law regime
 also got much of the credit for the
 prosperity of 1973 and 1974, traceable in
 large part to good crops and high export
 prices.
 The Palace
 During the past three and a half years,
 Marcos has used martial law to eliminate
 or restrict most national and local
 political institutions through which rivals
 might exercise power, but he has created
 few new structures. Political influence
 now depends largely on having a personal
 relationship with Marcos or with someone
 close to him.
 Since martial law, the President's ex-
 tended family and that of his wife, Imelda
 Romualdez, have acquired vast economic
 holdings, and both have become deeply in-
 volved in political and - administrative
 matters.
 Imelda's appointment as governor of
 metropolitan Manila in 1975 and her ven-
 tures into diplomacy are the most spec-
 tacular but by no means the only ex-
 amples of familial government under
 martial law. Other members of the two
 families  are scattered prominently
 throughout the government and in com-
 mercial enterprises,  particularly those
 considered politically sensitive, such as
 the media.
 The only political game left of any im-
 portance is to gain access to and influence
 with Marcos. Factions coalesce around
 ambitious personalities who can convince
 others they have influence. These cliques
 rarely represent philosophical differences
 or speak for economic or political interest
 groups. A leader's power and following
 dissipates at the first hint that his in-
 fluence with the President may be waning.
 Even the closest  Marcos followers
 generally interpret their loyalty to Marcos
 as a short-term obligation in return for
 favors. Few have any commitment to his
 martial law program or see Marcos
 himself as the keystone of national well
 being. Marcos is aware of the fragility of
 these bonds and is careful not to test them
 too far.
 Any successor will have to develop his
 own interlocking network of obligations,
 since it will be difficult for Marcos to deed
 the loyalties of his supporters to a
 designated successor, even his wife.
 Imelda Marcos is at present the most
 powerful leader of a palace clique, partly
 because of her obvious access to and in-
 fluence on her husband. Her prominence
 is also a reflection of the decline in in-
 fluence over the last six months of other
 close Marcos associates.
 Imelda's clique differs somewhat from
 others. It has a durable core based on the
 Romualdez family, but beyond this her
 group is no more stable or loyal than any
 of the others. It would quickly dissolve if
 the President gave any sign that her
 opinions no longer carry much weight.
 Imelda and her relatives have tried to
 guarantee her present level of influence by
 persuading Marcos to designate her
 publicly as his successor; thus far he has
 not done so.
 The Oligarchs
 Before martial law, politicians and
 bureaucrats were bought and sold by the
 economic oligarchy, which included rural
 landed families and urban commercial
 clans. The two national political parties
 were controlled by competing federations
 Approved For Release 2008/01/31 : CIA-RDP79-00927A011300250001-1
 Approved For Release 2008/01/31 : CIA-RDP79-00927A011300250001-1
 of oligarch interests with no discernible
 ideological or tactical differences.
 Marcos was not a member of this
 oligarchy by birth, but during his long
 political career he was able to acquire im-
 portant economic interests, and since
 martial law he has become easily the
 country's wealthiest citizen.
 The President has reinforced his new
 political powers by extending personal
 control over all important sectors of the
 economy, either directly by absorbing
 major businesses into the Marcos clan
 portfolio or indirectly through govern-
 ment regulation and supervision. Marcos'
 relatives or confidants sit on the boards of
 directors of all important businesses.
 Marcos moved early under martial law
 to reduce the power of regional warlords,
 outlawing their private armies, imposing
 gun  control,  and  beginning the
 long-delayed process of breaking up large
 landholdings. He established tighter cen-
 tral control over the constabulary and
 local police to prevent alliances with the
 landed oligarchs against the central
 government.
 Nevertheless, most oligarchs have
 benefited from martial law. It has brought
 new security, anti-strike decrees, and
 favorable commercial and financial
 regulations.
 The oligarchs as important political
 powers have not in fact been eliminated.
 Few have surrendered their private
 arsenals, and land reform has slowed after
 a showy start. The important sugar plan-
 tations are specifically excluded from the
 reforms. The landed oligarchs will
 probably be quick to revive their private
 armies and reassert control over local af-
 fairs if the next government appears weak
 or unstable.
 The Military
 Marcos 'has cultivated the military
 since his days as a congressman, when
 most politicians treated soldiers as
 second-class citizens, and he has tried to
 build up the military in the public eye as
 an integral part of his new administration.
 Unlike other Southeast Asian armies,
 the Philippine military has been a relative-
 ly apolitical, highly professional corps,
 which has never developed a sense of itself
 as embodying the nation's interests.
 Even though a number of officers have
 never been comfortable with martial law,
 by and large the military supports it.
 Constabulary officers, in contrast to those
 of the other services, have a long history
 of involvement in local and provincial af-
 fairs, and some have become powerful
 local administrators under martial law.
 This is determined largely by the personal
 relationship of the local civilian ad-
 ministrator with the palace.
 The military has been more interested
 in the economic opportunities afforded by
 its new importance than in political
 aggrandizement. Officers want the per-
 quisites formerly monopolized by the
 civilian elite-sinecures in private and
 public business, elite and foreign educa-
 tion for their children, kickbacks and
 other easy money. The military shows lit-
 tle concern for the direction of national
 policies in non-military affairs.
 A threatened government-wide
 housecleaning last fall provoked a strong
 reaction from top officers who came close
 to being purged, including some who were
 members of the inner circle that had
 planned martial law. They quickly made
 it clear to Marcos that they would
 publicize Marcos' own corruption, and
 the cautious Marcos backed down.
 In the event of Marcos' death or in-
 capacitation, however, the military would
 be propelled into national politics by
 default, since it is virtually the only
 national institution still intact.
 Implications
 Marcos does not appear unduly con-
 cerned about the problem of succession.
 At 58 he is still a relatively young man
 and is reported to be in good health. He
 plans to remain in power for many more
 years and doubtless assumes that he will
 have time to prepare for a transition. In
 Page  17
 order to satisfy domestic and foreign ad-
 visers, however, he claims that he has
 drafted a decree on succession and placed
 it with an unnamed trusted associate for
 safekeeping.
 Imelda and her followers have recently
 increased pressure on Marcos to name her
 his successor. Marcos is aware that his
 wife is unpopular with many powerful
 segments of the country, particularly in
 the military, and he himself does not trust
 her ambitions. Nevertheless, he has found
 it politically convenient to foster the im-
 pression that her political influence may
 be growing.
 The shape of a successor regime will de-
 pend largely on the balance of forces at
 the time of Marcos' death. Even if he
 should succumb to pressure from Imelda
 to name her his successor, most of her
 political influence will vanish once he is
 gone.
 Many military officers and other
 citizens would strongly oppose her acces-
 sion to the presidency. They realize that
 overt opposition to her is dangerous while
 her husband is alive, but some have
 already begun to discuss quietly how to
 stop her if she survives him.
 Imelda can be counted on to wage a
 strong campaign to succeed her husband,
 and her maneuvering will add greatly to
 the political turmoil and instability that
 will follow his departure. Her ac-
 tions-and the reactions of others to
 her-will probably shape the course of the
 succession contest.
 She might even be included in an initial
 post-Marcos junta, but unless she is more
 successful in the future than she has been
 in the past in attracting supporters who
 have political weight, she probably would
 be eased out of power very quickly.
 When Marcos leaves the political scene,
 the old power groups will compete to fill
 the political vacuum. There are few in-
 stitutions that can be counted upon to
 hold the country together while the
 succession is contested, and Marcos'
 successors will probably have to rely on
 unstable coalitions of disparate and
 potentially competitive political and
 economic groups.
