 RUSSIANS GIVING TECHNICAL HELP TO RED CHINA
 Soviet Russian military and technical advisers are being des-
 patched by the hundreds to Red China to help the Chinese Communists
 sovietise their country and assist in its incorporation into the
 Soviet military strategy.
 Soviet advisers are helping to plot the invasion of Taiwan,
 which will be launched in summer of the latest with land, sea and
 air forces- , according to authoritative Communist informants.
 It is estimatted that the Chinese Communists will be able to
 muster at least 100 fighting planes and 30 warships for the inva-
 sion of this last Nationalist stronghold.
 General Chen Yi, mayor of Shanghai, whose Third Field Army
 has been given the task of invading the island, is at present
 marshalling a picked force of 160,000 men for this three-dimension-
 al operation.  This task force is concentrated around: Shanghai
 and along the Chekiang coast, undergoing special amphibious train-
 ing.
 One important part of the training programme is making the
 soldiers into good sailors.  About 30 miles North of Shanghai, the
 Chinese Communists have erected an ingenious device consisting of
 nets supported upon high poles.   Small groups of soldiers climb
 into the nets which are then rocked like a ship in order to ac-
 custom them to the sea motion.
 Soviet instructors are also helping to train Chinese Communist
 pilots and naval crews in Manchuria according to informants.
 These sources said that about 20 Russian shipbuilders arrived
 in Shanghai lust month to work in the Kiangnan Dockyards.  Follow-
 ing the arrival of the Russians, several Americans employed by
 the dockyards, which were formerly operated under the Economic
 Co-operation Administration, were told to hand in their resignations.
 MISSION IN CANTON
 A Russian-language- nur,e:s' training school has been established
 inside Shanghai in order to train Chinese personnel for service
 with the Soviet military missions.
 There are a number of such missions all over China, including
 at least one film unit which is filming strategic areas.  This
 unit is accompanied by specially indoctrinated Chinese officers,
 whose task it is to familiarise the Russians with China's defence
 problems.
 Most of the Soviet officers are at. present stationed in Man-
 churia which has presumably been turned into a laboratory for test-
 ing the introduction of Soviet Communism Into China.  Soviet
 missions are, however, also encountered in Shanghai and as far
 South as Canton.
 Although there has never been any evidence of direct material
 Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists, Manchurian observers believe
 that the Russians have supplied their Chinese allies with Japanese
 arms and replacement parts, made with the Japanese machinery which
 the Russ-i:ans stri,.)ped from Manchurin    d removed to within the
 Soviet border.   An estimated 750,000 tons of Jcp-nese arms have
 been turned over to the Chinese Communists by the Russians.
 BRIDGE BUILDERS
 One high-ranking Chinese "democratic personage"- meaning a
 pro-leftist who is not a Party member - declared that the latest
 technical mission which arrived in Manchuria recently comprises
 about 300 experts.  Another mission of about 70 Soviet railway
 engineers is' attached to the Chinese Communist railway repair corps.
 The nine-arch steel bridge at Pengpu, 50 miles North of Nan-
 king, has been repaired by Soviet eng_neers.  The bridge spans the
 Hwai River.   It is one of China's most spectacular engineering feats,
 and was originally designed and built by British engineers.   It was
 badly damaged by the retreating Nationalist troops In December 1948.

 Chinese engineers who assisted the Soviet team,  said that
 Chinese and Russian engineers were segregated and that liaison
 was conducted through Chinese Communist officials.
 The same source said that Soviet advisers are also attached
 to the Health Ministry in Nanking.
 (Peking radio recently reported that Russian doctors and
 scientists helped to combat the plague epidemic in Chahar pro-
 vince in Manchuria).
 CREATING AN IMPRESSION
 The source said that the Russians are taking special precau-
 tions to create a good impression among the Chinese.   For example,
 in accordance with specific instructions from Stalin, the members
 of the anti-plague corps wore Chinese Communist Army uniforms,
 lived in Chinese barracks, and ate Chinese "Liberation Army"
 rations.
 Informed sources said that Russian engineers also helped to
 refloat the cruiser "Chungking" and the destroyer "Chang Chih,"
 which were sunk by Nationalist bombers after the crews had de-
 fected and sailed the vessels into Communist ports.
 These vessels will presumably participate in the forthcoming
 invasion of Formosa, the sources revealed.
 British-trained  Admiral Teng Chao-hsiang, skipper of the
 "Chungking" when she defected to the Communists in March, - only
 a captain then - has been restored to his command of the cruiser
 with the rank of admiral.
 REDS SEEKING TO EDGE FOREIGIIERS FROM CHINA
 The Chinese Communists' policy towards foreigners appears to
 be to edge them out of China - at least from the interior, writes
 Chang Kuo-sin, United Press staff correspondent who has just
 arrived in Hongkong after an overland trip from Shanghai.
 A number of foreign missionaries, after observing Chinese
 Communist rule during the past few months,  are given to pessimism
 as regards the future.
 One prominent American missionary, who for obvious reasons
 cannot be identified,  told me that the Chinese Communists, al-
 though avowedly guaranteeing freedom of religious belief, are
 out to eliminate freedom of religious action.
 He said that the first blow against the Church has already
 been struck by the Chinese Communists, who closed 80 percent of
 the rural churches in Shantung Province, and over 50 percent in
 Manchuria and Hopei.   Officially,  the Shantung churches were
 sealed because they were "private organisations", which are not
 permitted to exist, while no official reason has been given for
 the closure in Manchuria and Hopei.
 HANDY VJE:PON
 A similar policy scams to be followed as regards foreign
 businessmen despite Mao Tse-tung's assertions that the Reds
 welcome foreign trade.   according to all indications,  the Reds do
 not intend to expel the foreigners officially, but make life so
 lt that they will leave voluntarily.
 diffi
 cu
 One of the handiest weapons are travel restrictions, whereby
 foreigners living in the coastal cities are not permitted to
 tation or make business trips to other cities.  For
 t
 -s
 visit ou
 example, the British manager of a large export firm in Nanking was
 unable to take his home leave because the Communist authorities
 did not allow his colleague in Hankow to travel to Nanking to
 replace him.   They told the latter that he could have a permit to
 leave China but not one permitting transfer from one city to an-
 other.

 COMPELLED TO SELL
 Most foreigners behave that they will in the future be permit-
 ted to continue in business, but only in the larger cities and
 ports where they would do all the buying and selling.   They believe
 that they will not be permited to travel in the interior or main-
 tain branches there after the present staff leaves.   They believe
 that foreign firms with large properties in the interior of China
 - mostly British - will eventually be compelled to sell out to
 Chinese interests.
 Missionary informants said that they have protested to Premier
 Chou En-lai against the closure of churches.  The latter replied
 that the government would investigate, but no official action has
 been taken to reopen the churches.   Some congregations have not
 been interfered with, but others are required to follow various
 regulations.  Religious instruction has been banned in some schools,
 but elsewhere it is allowed to continue as a voluntary course.
 In addition to the closing of churches, the Chinese Communists
 are alsee  restricting the activities of missionaries.   Some mis-
 sionary sources said that this may be designed merely to eliminate
 foreign influence but to permit the indi,.onous clergy to remain.
 NO LEGAL. STANDING
 At the present time, the Church has no legal standing, and
 some. missionaries were told that they will have no legal protection
 as long as foreigners remain on the mission staff.
 Travel restrictions are placed on foreign missionaries as well
 as foreign businessmen.   Some missionaries in Anhwei province were
 not allowed to travel to Nanking even for medical treatment.  How-
 ever, they are being permitter? to leave China altogether.  Mis-
 sionaries in Antung province are not allowed'_ to move at all.
 American missionaries in Nanchang were questioned whether they were
 agents of the American government.
 Apparently a great deal of authority is placed in the hands of
 25X1C   local administrators who administer regulations in a number of
 different ways.
 CHIT_Its EXPERIENCING WORST FAMINE FOR LA'AST FEW DECADES
 Communist China is at present in the midst of a very grave
 famine affecting an estimated 50 million persons.
 The Chinese Communist rovernment officially admitted on Decem-
 ber 22 that 9,000,000 Chinese are "starving or half starving".
 The announcement, which I later found had not been distributed
 abroad, described the famine as "the worst for the last few decades."
 The announcement called on all local  authorities to g_;ive pri-
 ority to relief work.  One of the most important measures was the
 organisation of refugees into farming and handicraft units for pro-
 ductive work.
 Mao Tse-tung recently  called upon Chinese Communist army units
 similarly to form themselves into co-operative units, which offered
 handsome incentives for boosting the production of food.

 Reliable sources estimated that between 30 and 40 per cent of
 Red China's arable land has been damaged by droughts, floods and
 pestilence during the latter half of this year, while undamaged
 areas yielded only half of the normal crop.
 Reports from rural areas North of the Yangtse River said that
 the most fortunate people there were down to two meals of congee
 (rice gruel) daily.
 SHANGHAI INFLUX
 Many starving villagers are flooding the urban areas for food.
 Famine in the rural areas has caused the complete nullification
 of the Red's policy of dispersing "non-productive" residents from
 over-crowded Shanghai.
 The Reds have now abandoned this policy because every man sent
 back to the villages returned to the city with many more.
 One of those returners told me that he was unable to remain in
 his village because he had nothing to eat; he had to bring back
 his relatives because they were likewise starving.
 Qualified sources said that there are about 120,000 foodless
 and homeless refugees in Shanghai alone, with the authorities
 unable to,help.   The number of beggars has risen sharply, and they
 are found in every street and alley begging from pedestrains and
 rickshaw passengers.
 The famine has also caused widespread deterioration of public
 safety, with a sharp rise in the number of hold-ups and robberies.
 Communist trade bureaux have up'to now succeeded in keeping
 the cities supplied with food, but the effects of the famine are
 beginning to creep into the urban areas, causing inflation and
 other dislocations.
 The Chinese Communist New China Nevis Agency admitted that
 famine was the primary cause of the violent price fluctuations
 in October and November wherein the government dumped thousands
 of tons of rice and other commodities on the Shanghai market in
 an attempt to half the runaway price spiral.   (Recent economic
 reports from Shanghai indicated that the Communist currency has
 been inflated between 1,000 and 1,500 per cent within the past
 two months.)
 Famine is considered one of the most serious problems the Reds
 have yet encountered in the consolidation of their political rule,
 and one which - in view of their foreign policy - will have to be
 solved without - outside help.
 Soviet Russia, to which country the Chinese Communists seem
 now definitely conjoined, is not only in no position to help, but
 has aggravated the situation by requiring shipments of Chinese food
 in exchange for Russian machinery under a one-year barter agreement.
 The food Situation in Manchuria appears to be slightly better
 than in China proper.  Communist Press reports said that Man-
 churian rice would soon be shipped to North China to help alleviate
 the famine, although this does not necessarily indicate a Man-
 churian surplus.

 was also required to set up a seven-man editorial committee, con-
 sisting of Communist-trusted persons, to examine the articles
 before they were printed.
 The Shanghai "Tai Kung Pao," which formerly was known as the
 best independent Chinese daily,  is also now under the control of
 the Communists.   One of the changes which the Communists made in
 its traditional editorial policy is to bring editorials of the
 official New China News Agency on the front page.  The old edito-
 rial staff made an attempt to resist this change, but to no avail.
 Only the news service of the New China Agency an  the Soviet
 Tass Agency are made available to the newspapers.  Consequently
 their contents are similar every day.
 STATE MONOPOLY
 Publication of books is now virtually a state monopoly in the
 hands of the Communist new China Book Publishing Company.  There
 are several small privately-owned publishing houses, but like the
 privately-owned newspapers they are controlled by the Communists.
 The New China Company now has 375 branches.  A plan has been mapped
 out to expand the company to the extent of having one branch in
 every hsien (county) in China.
 Education is controlled through the appointment of teachers and
 professors and the alteration of the curriculum.  Political courses
 are included in the curriclum even for primary schools.  In uni-
 versities, Communist leader Mao Tse-tung's New Democracy, the his-
 tory of social development and Marxist dialectics are compulsory
 courses for all, even for engineering students.
 English translation of Mao Tse-tun 's speech on "The people's
 Democratic Dictatorship" on July 1, 19L9, is now the first lesson
 in freshman English.
 Ccmmun1Gt control in this field is so rigidly enforced that in
 ,areas where u:,t.. nated a special area.  This correspon-
 dent has seen a Communist map in which Manchuria was coloured
 differently from the rest of Chino.   Chinese may travel to any
 part of China with relative freedom, but travel to Manchuria is
 strictly controlled.   A special permit h7a to be obtained from
 the local authorities with the approval of the Manchurian Com-
 munists in Shanghai suspended the issue of perms to visit
 Manchuria, t-iving the cold weather there as the reason.
 Dairen and Fort Arthur, which are virtually completely under
 Soviet domination, have been made super-special zones.   Travel
 restrictions to the two ports are even stricter than those
 applying to other parts of Manchuria.   The Changchun Railway,
 which ends at Port Arthur, does not maintain a direct service to
 the two ports.  The train runs only as far as Wuliho, which is
 about 50 miles northwest of Dairen.   The passengers have to alight
 from the train, walk a short distance, show their permits to the
 Chinese Communist and Soviet euerr's and then board another train
 for Dairen.

 Manchuria is now being ruled on the lines of Soviet Communism.
 All private property in the  rural areas has been expropriated.
 Private property is still permitted in the urban districts, but
 it is now being gradually squeezed out by large state monopolies
 and crippling taxes and levies.   No private banks exist there now.
 According to the pro-Communist Hsin Min Pao in Shanghai,  the
 ratio between state and private-owned industries in Manchuria
 now is 46 to 52.   The production ratio this year in terms of
 Keoliang is 10,240,000 tons for the state-owned and 1,000,000
 tons for private-owned industries.

 the farmers toe new low in poverty and that a man possessing one
 ounce of goldis considered a rich man.
 The Comm i.tiist New China A ency reported on December 5 that
 commodity prices in Manchuria have risen only 80 percent during
 the whole of 1949-  If this is true, it would seem that Communist
 rule has at least brought about economic stability in the North-
