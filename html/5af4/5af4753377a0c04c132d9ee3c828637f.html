 ITALIAN COMMUNIST REVIEW OF ECONOMIC
 AND POLITICAL PRCGR1ES IIi CHI{iA
 he following is taken from an article by Giuseppe Regis ap-
 pearing in the July 1953 Rinascita, a Rome monthly periodical ed-
 ited by Palmiro Togliatti ./
 A. Introduction
 The year 1953 will be renembercd in the history of New China as the transi-
 tional year during which the new state passed from the preliminary phase to one
 of organizational development.
 Rinascita has thoroughly examined the problems which confronted the People's
 Republic of China at the time of the .1 October lyI9 proclamation, the most urgent
 tasks of economic and political stabilization during the first year, and the suc-
 cesses attained during the following 2-year reconstruction period.   (See Antonio
 Viale, "The Communists and the Chinese Revolution," Rinascita, November 1949; Velio
 Spano, "One Year of the People's Republic of China," Rinascita, October 1950; and
 Giuseppe Regis, "Economic Development and Structural Reforms in the People's Re-
 public of China," Rinascita, August - September 1952.)
 The general elections and the beginning of the Five-Year Plan are the two
 main events in 1953 responsible for the new phase of economic and political life
 in China.  The general elections mark the change from a temporary political re-
 gime to a stable government; the Five-Year Economic Plan marks the transition
 from an economic policy characterized by the need for stabilization and recon-
 struction to a great national economy.
 What new production methods have been developed during the past 4 years in
 China?  How have the actual productive forces, which are at the base of these
 methods, been changed?  How do the two fundamental laws of 1953 facilitate the
 transition from a capitalist economy to a socialist economy?

 B. Development of Socialist Econom
 During the past 4 years, monopolies and large landed estates have lost con-
 trol of the economic life of China.  Today the economic life of the country is
 controlled by the popular-democratic state with power in the hands of the work-
 ers.                                            The socialist and cooperative sectors of China's economy are continually
 developing.
 At present, the state controls 80 percent of heavy industry, 40 percent of
 light industry, 60 percent of maritime transportation, 100 percent of rail trans-
 portation, 90 percent of the bank;, 90 percent of foreign trade, and 63 w.nlesale domestic trade.  The share of eoverument-owned factories in production has
 increased from 43.8 percent in 1-949 to 67.3 percent in 1952.
 With the breaking of the ::,onopolists's power, landed property has been re-
 duced, with the result that 1.7 million hectares have been redistributed to land-
 less farmers or to those with insufficient iand.   (Documentary material in sec-
 tions B and C is taken from New China's Economic Achievement-, 1949 -1952, pub-
 lished in Peiping at the end of 1952 by the China Committee for the Promotion of
 International Trade.)
 The cooperative movement has affected 10( million members: 32,000 farm co-
 operatives with 95 million members; 3,300 urba:. consumer cooperatives with 11 mil-
 lion members; and 1,000 industrial production cooperatives with 200,000 members.
 More than 30 percent of the domestic retail trade passes through the cooperatives.
 One aspect of the cooperative movement is the mutual aid in rural districts in
 which 40 percent of the farmers participate.
 The capitalist economy, which is essentially artisan in form, that is, con-
 sists of small- and medium-sized plants, has retained only the following: 20 per-
 cent of heavy industry, 55 /ic; state has 40 percent according to statement above]
 pefEE nt.of light industry,     percent of agriculture, 40 percent of maritime trans-
 portation, 10 percent of the banks, 10 percent of foreign trade, and 70 percent
 of domestic retail trade.
 Although the percentages of state control are still rather limited, the sig-
 nificance of the new reform is made more evident by the following considerations.
 The state-owned factories and the cooperatives supply most of the raw materials,
 machinery, and.power to the privately owned plants end are the latter's principal
 consumers.  The state controls credit and limits private profits to 10,30 percent.
 The workers are protected by a strong syndical movement bringing together 10 mil-
 lion workers and by strictly enforced social legislation.
 Another fundamental aspect of the structural reform which has taken place in
 China is.the total elimination of the influence of foreign imperialist capital,
 formerly connected with the nation's monopolies and the termination of the semi= "
 colonial nature of Chinese economic and political life.
 C.    Production Development

 The large structural reforms, made possible by the seizure of power by popu-
 lar and national forces, have in turn favored more ample production development.
 Production in almost all sectors has surpassed the high prewar levels.  However,
 the greatest progress has been made in the industrial fields, especially in heavy
 industry, which determine further structural changes.  The industrial production
 index at the end of i'952 shows a 700-percent increase over 1949.  The following
 is a breakdown of the industrial production increases (in percent):   iron and
 steel, 900; electricity, 100; coal, 80; petroleum, 300; wood, 120; cotton, 130;
 and agricultural products, 40.

 Investment in the field of capital goods has increased from 32.5 percent in
 1949 to 67.5 percent in 1952.  A large quantity of machinery, vehicles, and in-
 dustrial equipment has been manufactured in China for the first time.  Hundreds
 of thousands of unemployed workers have been absorbed by the new and old facto-
 ries, both private and stag-owned.  The development of technical instruction,
 the modernization of equipment, the streamlining of factory organization, the
 "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" competition and campaign movements against waste,
 theft, corruption, and bureaucracy have made possible the increase in production
 percentages, which range from 15 percent to 130 percent according to tae sectors,
 and have greatly reduced costs.
 Isolated rural trade no lorg?vr exists; large-scale trade on the national
 level is continually developing.  The development of transportation networks
 such as roads, rivers, and railways (for the railways alone, 10,000 kilometers
 have been reconstructed and 1,167 kilometers have been newly built), the stabi-
 lization of prices, adjustmec;L of relations between agricultural and industrial
 price, and the steps for public safety havp markedly developed rural-u.ban ex-
 change.        general volume of domestic trade alone has increased 70 percent dur-
 ing 1950-1952.
 Also of decisive importance is the increase in agricultural production;
 this has risen 40 percent from 1949 to 1952 and represents a 9-percent increase
 over the high prewar Level,   In particular, the production of cotton increased
 three times during the 3 years, finally reaching a 50-percent increase over the.
 prewar level.  Livestock has increased 30 percent.  These increases are the re-
 sult of greater initiative and work availability made possible by the land re-
 form, land distribution, work collectives, the introduction of modern technical
 methods in agriculture, and the large drainage and irrigation projects, in
 which 1.7 billion cubic meters of earth have been removed and 42,000 kilometers-
 of dykes have been repaired and constructed.  Three million hectares have been
 irrigated for the first time, 7 million hectares which were flooded in 1949 have
 been reclaimed during 1952, 14 million hectares have been disinfected, and 15
 million hectares have been cultivated with special seeds, increasing the use of
 fertilizes by 30 percent.  These production increases have completed China's
 liberation from foreign imperialism which, in the past, had profited from the
 scarcity of grain,  rice, cotton, and tobacco by imposing its own controls;
 At present, China is not only largely self-sufficient in spite of the in=
 crease in consumption, but also has available quantities of goods which are of
 great importance for increasing her foreign trade pussibiliti~s.
 These production increases, together with the structural reforms, have made
 possible a noteworthy increase in individual incomes, thereby greatly improving
 food, clothing, homes, sanitary conditions, education, and culture.  From 1949 to
 1952, workers' salaries have increased an average of 60-120 percent, whereas prices
 during  the  first  half   ,f 1952 decreased 5 percent as compared with March 1950.
 rsr111er6' iueomcO       u,.,e risen through the increase in production, the abolish-
 ment of property revenues in land-reform acreas (47 million hectares, equivalent
 to 30 million tons of grain), and the adjustment of agricultural prices in re-
 lation to industrial prices.
 During 1952, the number of students in the elementary schools was 50 million,
 or more thaq double the high number at the time of the Nationalists.  The number
 of students in the secondary and upper schools  has _ncreased 70 percent.  At pres-
 ent,  i million workers Lre enrolled in academic courses.
 The extent of such progress is even more important in view of the fact..thata::
 as a result of Americar aggression in Korea, the Chinese government has had to
 spend large sums for about 3 years in military and economic aid to the people

 block-

 talist countries to observe.
 However, these difficulties have been offset by the aid contr+`ited first'
 from the Soviet Union and then from the People's Democracies.  The positive aid
 has consisted of machinery, raw materials, patents, technical advice, and  eco-
 nomic and social, organization.
 D. Elections
 The general elections and the beginning of the Five-Year Plan took place
 in 1953 as a result of the unprecedented reconstruction, production, and consoli-
 dation of power in the hand] of the working classes.  Since this is the first time
 that general elections have been held it China, a general census of the popula-
 tion was taken 30 June 1953.   (Documentary material in section D is taken from
 the text of th- electoral law and the speech by Vice-Prime Minister Teng Hsiao-
 p'ing as published in Supplements No 128 and 129 in the Hsin-hua News Agency,
 19 and 20 March 1953; and from the report by Chou En-lai to the National Com-
 mittee of the China People's Political Consultative Conference, published in the
 Tass supplement of 7 February 1953.)
 The possibility of politically mobilizing almost 350 million electors and
 of technically organizing their vote, even in the most remot- villages of the
 hinterland and the mountains,  is the result not only of reorganizing the nation's
 civic life but also of the intense political activity which has taken place
 lately for the first time among the popular masses in their political and mass
 organizations.
 The Chinese Communist Party consists of 6 million members; the unions, 10
 million; the New Democracy Youth Corps. 6.3 million;  the Federation of Democratic
 Women, 7.6 million; the Federation of Students, 2.2 million; the Cooperative
 Movement, 106 million; and the Sino-Soviet, Friendship Association, 26.5 mil-
 lion.  Moreover, the Partisans of Peace have obtained 350 million signatures
 for the Five-Power Peace Pact; 15.6 million citizens have participated in the
 local provisory administrations; and 250,000 rural communes, 436 counties, 85
 cities, and 19 regions have already elected their popular governments in re-
 cent years.
 Elegibility to vote and to be elected extends to a1 l those citizens over 18
 years of age, regardless of race, sex, religion, profession, education, residence,
 property, or social origin.
 Those nor  eligible  to vote are farmers who have not observed the land're-
 form, condemned counterrevolutionaries, those deprived of political rights, and
 mental defectives.
 All the election expenses are covered by the state,   In addition to the
 Communist Party and other democratic political groups, the varied organizations
 of the people and electors and their representatives not belonging to organiza-
 tions may present candidates separately or Jointly to other political?groups.
 Electoral committees on a wide basis are entrusted with the preparation and-or-
 derly management of the elections.  Since there is still a high degree of illit-
 eracy  !eft by the old regime, the written vote would prevent a large part of
 the population, especially the workers, from voting.  Therefore, in specific in-
 stances, the hand vote is permitted in the electoral assemblies.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/09/14: CIA-RDP80-00809A000700150309-1
 Hand voting is strictly limited to rural communities; small cities, districts,
 and municipalities which are not divided into districts.  The vote is not direct
 in all cases also because of the lack of facilities.  The hand vote is direct for
 lower offices but indirect for the higher offices, that is~for the municipalities
 divided into districts, the counties, the provinces, and the republic.  Candidates
 for higher offices will not be elected directly by the voters but by the success-
 ful candidates for the lower offices.  Those elected at the lower level therefore
 not only elect the people's representatives at the higher levels of government,
 but at the same time they will also be the permanent legislators at the local
 level.
 .Thus the new electoral law assures a democratic formation of the congress and
 a democratic life which differs greatly at the base and in the intermediary offices
 of the nation.  Thus the se^-ul?.r tradition of the maelar`.ns and of their central-
 ized  Lureaucratic power is broken forever and the widest autonomy is joined to
 the organizational unity cf the nation.  The permanent control by the masses over
 the activity of the deoacce which they have elected is then assured not only by
 the political activity cf the people's organizations but also by the right of the
 voters at the yarloua levels to revoke the power of those they have elected.
 Two dangers which mi:,ht have arisen from the elections to hinder the social-
 ist development c'' the People's Democracy of China were the surtression of the
 national minoriti-s and the superior influence of the majo-it9.   Since the view-
 point of the prosperous farmers us a group prevails among the more backward masses,
 the majority of the peop'.e might tend to underestimate the necessity for industrial
 development which is vital to the general eccnomtc progress of the country and of
 its independence.   However, the electoral law hag avoided  these dangers by guar-
 anteeing,repre_sentation to all national minorities in the elective organizations,
 even when their ,^,roups are so scattered and ema11 that they do not warrant a suf-
 ficient electoral quotient, and by guarante--ing to the urban industrial centers
 and electoral quotient lever than that of the rural centers.
 These firs'. general elections in Own will permit the Communist Party arid-
 the democratic front to demonstrate, throughout the cour_try, their experiences
 and political guidance
 E.  Five-Year Flan
 The first Five-Year Plan for the People'.. Republic of China also began in
 1953?  Although i part of the Chinese economy had rot _yet, charge  in structure
 from capitalism ''o socialism or ovlLectivism, the fact that the state controls
 China's fundamental economic means already makes it. possible for the government
 to set forth an organizational program of economic development.  Details of the
 Five-Year Plan, are not yet known since they must first be discussed and approved.
 However, the plan for grain production, which must increase 30 percent, is exempt
 from th[c approval.   (Documentary material in Section E is taken from the fol-
 lowing reports,  the -previously cited report by Chen En-lal of 7 February 1953;
 the report by Chia-T'o-fu, vice-chairman of the Committee of Finance and Econom-
 ics,                                                  to the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions, published by the Hsin-
 aa pe'..< Agencq iii 7naplement No 138, 12 May 1951, the report on the 1953 Budget
 by  Po  1-po,  Minister  ;f Finance, published by the same agency in'Supplement.
 No 121, 11? and 24 February 1953; and an article by Chu Chi-ping in China'Recon
 structs; No 2, 1951)
 The objective of the Five-Year Plan is to Bike China excel in the field of
 industrialization and at the same time considerably to increase the well-being
 and the culture of the people and to reinforce the defense of the nation against
 imperialist aggression.  The first important step is to convert China from a mainly
 agricultural into an agricultural-industrial country, from one that is still only
 10-percent industrial to a 30-percent Industrial country.

 The statistics for the first year of'the plan, published at the time of the
 presentation of the government budget for 1953, already forcefully reveal the
 great progress that will be made.          Government investments in the economy alone
 (in industry, agriculture, transportation, etc.) will increase 41 percent, equal=
 ing 103.5 billion yuan; expenditures for public education and'social welfare will
 increase 56 percent to 34.8 billion yuan.  The 1953 productir   increases in agri="
 cultural products *as compared to 1952 are as follows:   grain, j percent: cotton,
 and tea,'l1 percent; and tobacco, 47-percent.  On the whole, industry in general
 must increase 23 percent and state-owned industries must increase 32 percent.
 Large industrial installations are being constructed.   In the field of met-
 allurgy,  'hree huge plants are being built at An-shan for the production of pipes,
 rolled products, and castings.   Ii, the coal industry, the opening of a new sur-
 face mine at Fou-hsin is expect=d to yield enough coal in 2 years to produce 4.3
 billion kilowatt-hours.   In h,ivy machinery, a large machine-tool plant for power-
 ful machine tools is being constructed at T'ai-yuan.  Eight other factories will
 be constructed and 13 refitted in the metallurgical and chemical sector; 9 new
 factories will be built and 15 enlarged in the mechanic sector of machine tools,
 electrical equipment, motor vehicles, and naval construction; 14 new coal mines
 will be opened in the Northeast alone, and 48,000 meters of land will be test-
 drilled for oil.
 As a result of these measures, of the increase  i::  technical instruction
 (the number of-students in the schools for workers and farmers is expected to
 increase 62 percent), and of the improvement in living and sanitary conditions,
 work productivity should increase 16 percent and cost:, should decrease 7 percent:
 These are the great construction tasks which the Chinese people must under-
 take in 1953?  The successes attained In the part assure the world that these
 tasks will be accomplished, especially because of the consciousness of their own
 limits which the leaders of the great Chim_ae Communist Party have always shown.
 Comrade Chou En-Iai said in the previously cited report:   "We must act in such a
 way that all the workers may understand that we are facing new problems and tasks
 and that we are-able to surmount the difficulties, resolve our problems,'perfddt
 our Work,'and make fewer errors by strongly fighting arrogance and complacency,
 by making every effort to learn in all humility, and by correcting our errors
 and our deficiencies,  We must reinforce our state discipline, fight the spirit
 of bureaucracy and domination, punish transgressor;, and r-gorously guard against
 sabotage and malevolent destruction.
 "It f; our firm opinion that under the just guidance of President Mao Tse-tung
 and the Chinese Ccmmunist Party and with the all of technical progress and the
 USSR experts, the intelligent and diligent workers, the farmers, and intellectuals
 of Chinn will certainly be able to develop their great initiative and creativity
 and-accomplish each task and concrete plan that presents itself."
