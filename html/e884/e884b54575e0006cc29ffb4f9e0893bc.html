 Moroccan and Algerian troops may have clashed again over the weekend in
 Spanish Sahara.
 ,
 Ian estimated regiment-sized Algerian force, supported by armor and artillery
 conducted a hit-and-run attack on Amgala last Saturday, overrunning the Moroccan
 infantry company defending the oasis. I                       the Algerians
 wanted to avenge their defeat last month by Moroccans at Amgala. The Moroccan
 minister of information later told the US ambassador that 32 Moroccan soldiers
 were killed and a number captured by the Algerians.
 Morocco's King Hassan sent a message to Algerian President Boumediene on
 Sunday accusing Boumediene of again breaking promises he had made last summer
 not to use Algerian troops in Sahara to fight the Moroccans. The King, according to
 a Moroccan broadcast, challenged Boumediene to make known his intentions about
 Spanish Sahara by either accepting an internationally guaranteed peace or openly
 declaring war on Morocco.
 The Moroccan version may be accurate, though we cannot confirm that
 Algerian troops conducted the attack.
 An Algerian broadcast has denied the Moroccan charge; it suggested that the
 Polisario Front was responsible. The radio commentary emphasized that Algeria will
 continue to support the Front fully in its struggle for independence for Spanish
 Sahara.
 The Algerian reaction suggests Boumediene still wants to avoid an open clash
 with Morocco but that he will continue to support the Polisario Front's struggle
 against the Moroccan and Mauritanian take-over of the disputed territory.I

 Criticism of Teng Hsiao-ping in wall posters apparently has spread to many
 areas throughout China. The posters are confined mainly to institutes of higher
 learning but have appeared in the streets of Shanghai and apparently one other city
 as well.
 The poster campaign reportedly was endorsed over the weekend by the party's
 official newspaper, which asserted that criticism through posters "terrifies only the
 guilty."
 Teng Hsiao-ping's political status seems still unresolved. Most Chinese officials
 abroad have expressed confidence that he will retain important party and military
 posts-an indication that they have received no official word that Teng is finished. A
 Foreign Ministry official has said Teng is still a vice premier in the government. The
 relatively few public appearances of Chinese leaders in recent weeks suggest that the
 party's ruling Politburo is meeting, perhaps to decide Teng's future among other
 issues.
 A Chinese official reportedly has said that Mao designated Hua Kuo-feng as
 acting premier because the time is not "ripe" for a permanent premier and that there
 is "no appropriate person" for the job. If true, this statement would indicate that
 Mao has indeed withdrawn his previous endorsement of Teng as Chou En-lai's
 successor. Several Chinese officials stationed abroad have said recently that Chou's
 successor may not be chosen for some time.
 The party's leaders would set a dangerous precedent should they decide to send
 Teng back to political obscurity. Teng is the highest ranking of hundreds-perhaps
 thousands-of officials who were purged in the mid-1960s and have since been
 reinstated. These rehabilitated officials occupy positions at almost every level of the
 Chinese hierarchy. Teng's ouster would be an invitation for party leftists to attack
 these officials; the result could be widespread disruption throughout most of China's
 provinces.

 Such attacks may in fact have already begun. The party leader of Hunan
 Province, a rehabilitated official, reportedly is under attack in wall posters that have
 appeared in the streets of the provincial capital.
 Most Chinese officials who have expressed.a view see the balance of power in
 the leadership as clearly in favor of the pragmatists associated with Teng. Although
 they may not have access to inside information and may be basing their judgment on
 Teng's strong showing throughout 1975-and on the fact that many of his
 supporters are now in important posts-it is perhaps significant that they are for the
 most part optimistic about Teng's future and do not expect either foreign or
 domestic policy to swing to the left as a result of the current situation.
 If Teng's future party role is now at issue, as seems the case, and the party
 leadership cannot agree on whether to allow him to remain as de facto number-two
 man in the party-another of Chou En-lai's positions that Teng assumed last year-a
 prudent course might be to demote him slightly.
 A similar situation occurred in 1974, when a party vice chairman was under
 widespread attack in posters throughout the country. His demotion in January 1975
 to that of an ordinary member of the Politburo apparently silenced his critics.
 In any case, Teng's current troubles, which almost certainly are being
 orchestrated by some important party officials in Peking, have probably caused the
 party's leaders to reassess the leadership alignment. Regardless of where Teng comes
 out, there are bound to be some changes in the pecking order, and should Teng
 emerge with his party position intact, his current detractors may find themselves in
 hot water.

 Lagos appears to have returned to normal following last Friday's abortive coup
 attempt, which resulted in the slaying of head of state General Muhammed. Borders
 and airports remain closed to international travel and a dusk-to-dawn curfew
 continues.
 Reports indicate the coup attempt was initiated by a handful of dissident
 soldiers. The willingness and ability of the armed forces to quash the rebellion has
 met with widespread approval, indicating that the coup plotters acted without broad
 support.
 Following a meeting of the ruling Supreme Military Council on Saturday,
 armed forces chief of staff Obasanjo was named head of state. He is the first member
 of the influential Yoruba tribe to hold this position. The former commissioner of
 transport, Lieutenant Colonel Yar'Adua, was promoted to general and will assume
 the portfolio of armed forces chief of staff.
 Obasanjo has vowed to continue Muhammed's policies, which will undoubtedly
 include a strong stance against minority rule in South Africa and support for the
 Soviet-backed Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. In a speech last
 month, Obasanjo bore down hard on Angola and implied that the importance of oil
 as a political weapon should not be ignored.
 Although there are rumors that the US was implicated in the coup attempt, no
 official accusation has been made. Nevertheless, the Nigerian news media, which
 have become increasingly controlled by the government, have hit hard at US
 operations overseas. Last month, the government ordered that the US Foreign
 Broadcast . Information Center at Kaduna be shut down without offering
 justification. The Nigerian press, however, alleged that the center is controlled by
 the CIA.

 Two prominent figures from the Haile Selassie regime were killed over the
 weekend, allegedly while resisting arrest. Numerous others were arrested.
 Addis Ababa radio provided little explanation, announcing only that the
 government had taken action against "opponents of the Ethiopian revolution."
 Those killed and arrested may have been suspected of collaborating with the
 Ethiopian Democratic Union, an organization led by other well-known members of
 Ethiopia's former aristocracy. The Democratic Union has been conducting guerrilla
 operations in western Ethiopia and is believed to have a number of supporters in
 other parts of the country.
 some members of the ruling military
 council have become increasingly concerned that the Democratic Union is gaining
 popularity in the provinces. They believe the Union's advocacy of a return to private
 ownership of land has a strong appeal among a wide variety of people who oppose
 the council's nationalization program.
 The council members are concerned that the Union, by winning over large
 numbers of farmers, will be able to cut the flow of food supplies to Addis Ababa.
 Some farmers have recently protested the council's socialist policies, especially the
 price controls on their products. In some instances they have burned their crops
 rather than sell them at the government price.
 The council members believe the Union does not now pose a military threat to
 the government. Before the arrests and killings were announced, the US embassy
 reported that there was a marked undercurrent of uneasiness and a general
 expectation, of disorder in Addis Ababa. For the first time in months, rumors of a
 possible coup are again circulating. The uneasiness is partly attributable to the
 disappearance of staple foods from the markets.
 Increasing student and worker unrest have added to the malaise. Large numbers
 of deserters from the government's rural work program have returned to Addis
 "Ababa. Students and workers in the capital have staged several demonstrations in
 recent weeks. Buses have been stoned and burned in other towns.
 The growing malaise is also being fed by:
 --The government's continuing difficulties in dealing with insurgencies in
 Eritrea and other provinces,

 --rising tensions on the border with Somalia, Ethiopia's traditional enemy,
 stemming from a recent clash between French and Somali forces on the border
 between Somalia and the French Territory of Afars and Issas.
 The arrests and killings this weekend will further erode public confidence in the
 military council. Most Ethiopians will probably view the events as the be-ginning of
 more repression, which is sure to create more unrest.

 President Maria Estela Peron has taken the offensive against her enemies, calling
 for constitutional reform and temporarily closing a prominent newspaper that has
 become one of her harshest critics.
 Her most recent move was to adjourn congress last night-an obvious bid to
 thwart a renewed attempt at impeachment.
 Late last week, Peron called for a constituent assembly to rewrite the
 constitution before the next national election. Her public statement did not spell
 out the changes she wants, but the move may be related to the controversy over the
 date for the next national election.
 The constitution now provides that the election be held within six months
 prior to inauguration day, May 25, 1977. Major opposition parties have strongly
 protested against the date previously set-next October 17-on the grounds that it is
 an important Peronist holiday; the date, of course, also does not fall within the
 six-month period called for in the constitution.
 Peron has also condemned an amendment enacted in 1972 by the former
 military government, which reduced the president's term from six to four years. She
 may conceivably be seeking to reinstitute the six-year term and, perhaps, even make
 it applicable to her present stay in office.
 President Peron frequently insists that as Juan Peron's chosen successor, she
 intends to finish out her term. Her defiance in the face of growing adversity has
 served to confuse her opponents in the past, but her closure of congress could force
 the military to intervene. Until now, the military has publicly shunned this course
 by insisting that the politicians should remove her by legal means.
 Peron has lost almost all of her former allies, including much of organized
 labor, but the latest protest against her administration, a call for a "strike" by
 business leaders yesterday, was only partially successful.

 The Soviets' unmanned Soyuz-20 spacecraft yesterday separated from the
 Salyut-4 space station and returned to the USSR after 91 days in orbit. We believe
 this mission was a prelude to the launch of a manned spacecraft that will probably
 attempt to establish a new record for manned space flights.
 The Soyuz-20 was launched on November 17 and docked with the space
 station two days later. There is no indication that new systems or operational
 techniques were tested, but Moscow has announced that biological experiments with
 different plants and living organisms were conducted.
 The longest Soviet manned space mission to date was conducted last year when
 the Soyuz-18 crew remained in orbit for 63 days. No major problems developed
 during that flight,
 In view of the apparent success of the Soyuz-20 mission, the Soviets will
 probably attempt to launch a manned spacecraft within the next few months. That
 mission will probably last about 90 days and thus set a new record for manned space
 flights. The US Skylab-3 crew was in orbit for 84 days in 1974.

 The general strike that began in Iceland today is putting additional political
 pressure on Prime Minister Hallgrimsson, who is already concerned that his coalition
 government may break up unless the fishing dispute with the UK is settled soon.
 Union and management negotiators have been meeting with a government
 mediator in marathon sessions for the past two weeks, but the two sides are still far
 apart on the issue of wages. Progress has been hampered by the inability of
 government leaders to take a major part in the talks because of their preoccupation
 with the cod war.
 The main union goal is to tie wages to the cost-of-living index, a link that the
 Hallgrimsson government suspended last year. The annual rate of inflation is
 currently about 60 percent.
 Hallgrimsson might pressure the employers' association to make additional
 concessions. Most union leaders are taking a hard line on the cod war, and the Prime
 Minister's room for maneuver in restarting talks with London would be restricted
 further if he resists union demands for higher wages.
 If the strike call is fully heeded, some 40,000 persons will stay away from their
 jobs. State employees are not involved in the dispute, so essential utility services will
 not be affected. The last general strike in Iceland was two years ago and lasted six
 days.

 EC-ANGOLA: The EC Nine are moving toward diplomatic recognition of the
 Popular Movement as the sole government of Angola. The subject was surely
 discussed at the EC political directors' meeting in Luxembourg that began yesterday.
 Some reports indicate that the political directors are working out final arrangements
 and that the announcement will be made this week. The EC agreed late last year to
 act simultaneously on Angolan recognition. The Nine have apparently decided to act
 at this time because of the Popular Movement's military successes and because most
 members of the Organization of African Unity now recognize the Movement,
 making certain that it will win OAU recognition.

 most of the demands of Lebanon's old-line Muslim leaders, yet they preserve the
 most important prerogatives of the country's Christian minority.
 The reforms do not include the fundamental political changes sought by the
 radical leftists and some Muslim religious leaders, but they may lead to greater leftist
 representation in parliament, and they promise a variety of lesser concessions in the
 form of social and economic measures.
 If the reforms are implemented soon, Lebanon may win a period of peace that
 could last several months or even a few years. If Christian leaders attempt to delay
 implementation of the changes or to introduce qualifications while their promises
 are being translated into laws, the fighting probably will resume. This might prompt
 Syria and the mainline fedayeen groups to withdraw their support for the political
 compromise, and could lead ultimately to still more fundamental changes in
 Lebanon's system of government.
 In his speech outlining the reform package, Franjiyah sought to balance
 concessions for the Muslims with reassurances for the Christians. He promised the
 Muslims that Lebanon's constitution will continue to "evolve by experience" to
 accommodate needed changes in the political system, that the government is
 committed to social justice, and that the country will never abandon its "Arab
 character."
 At the same time, the President assured the Christians that the 1943 national
 covenant will be preserved, that the Palestinians will be expected to adhere to their
 past agreements with the Lebanese government, and that Lebanon will retain its
 "sovereignty."
 The Approved Document
 Franjiyah said that the reforms are outlined in a written document that has
 been approved by the Lebanese cabinet and will soon be presented to parliament.
 There is little chance that parliament will fail to approve a political settlement that
 has been approved by leaders of the country's principal political groups, but there is
 a chance that politicians on both sides will use the time before parliament acts to
 raise new political demands or objections.

 Once it is approved by parliament, the new document, which Franjiyah termed
 "a declaration of a course for national action," apparently will augment rather than
 supplant the unwritten national covenant and the existing constitution as the basis
 of Lebanon's political system.
 As outlined by Franjiyah, the most important points of the reform package
 provide for:
 --Continuing the existing system of distributing the top political posts: the
 president will be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and
 the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim.
 --Providing equal representation to Christians and Muslims in parliament, and
 revising of the election law to provide for the proportional representation of
 sects within each major religion.
 --Electing the prime minister by parliament, instead of his being selected by the
 president.
 --Changing the procedures to be followed by parliament: certain "issues of
 destiny" will require a two-thirds majority. The parliament will continue to
 elect the president, but it will now require 55 percent of the votes if the
 candidate fails to receive a majority on the first ballot.
 --Transferring some power from the president to the prime minister; all decrees
 and bills will be issued jointly.
 --Decentralizing and establishing a merit system in the civil service.
 --Drafting a new defense policy and strengthening the army.
 --Establishing an administrative body. to plan economic development and
 committing the government to "universal social justice" through economic and
 social reform.
 I                                  Ia new cabinet will be formed
 soon, and that a  parties to the political settlement nave agreed that some action to
 implement each of the specific reforms will be taken within one month after a more
 representative government is installed.
 Lebanon's old-line Muslim leaders, including Prime Minister Karami, are in an
 awkward position as a result of the Christians' approval of the reform package. The
 Muslims' political prestige rests on early implementation of the reforms, yet strict
 adherence to the terms of the accord would increase the political power of the
 disadvantaged Muslim and leftist groups that threaten the political positions of the
 old-liners.

 The good will of the traditional Muslim leaders will be tested with the issue
 that must be faced first: reallocation of the seats in parliament. Unless the
 membership of parliament is expanded, the Muslims will gain only five seats. This
 number would be insufficient to satisfy the six or seven Muslim blocs that are
 already in parliament, and would, if the reform provisions are implemented
 equitably, be given primarily to Shia Muslim and leftist groups rather than to the
 already influential Sunni Muslims.
 The Sunni Muslims may decide to endure criticism from their leftist and Shia
 associates by tacitly cooperating with the Christians in delaying reconstitution of the
 parliament or by pushing ahead with the recent plans to extend the life of the
 present parliament and allow it to elect a new president late this summer.
 The old-line Muslims are likely to conclude that the increased representation
 they have won for Muslims in parliament is insignificant. Their major gain is in the
 increased power of the prime minister relative to that of the president. Because the
 Sunnis control the post of prime minister, they will seek to build up the post further
 and probably will not attempt to make parliament significantly more powerful than
 it has been in the past.
 Karami, a Sunni Muslim and a strong prime minister, gains most from the new
 agreement.
 The Lebanese leftists and some radical Muslim religious leaders received no
 satisfaction of their fundamental demands: that the Maronite Christians give up the
 presidency and that the religious basis of Lebanon's government be abandoned.
 Nevertheless, they are not likely to attempt to spark new hostilities until they see
 whether or not the government implements the promised economic and social
 reforms. Some of the leftists will be satisfied with limited measures; others will be
 cowed by the overwhelming military presence in Lebanon of the Syrian-controlled
 Palestine Liberation Army and by the decision of the major fedayeen groups to
 cooperate with the Liberation Army in-enforcing the cease-fire.
 The only leftist who has promoted a coherent set of political demands over the
 past several months has been Socialist leader Kamal Jumblatt. His party platform
 calls for extensive education and social welfare programs, a merit system in the civil
 service, proportional representation in parliament, an independent judiciary, reform
 of the election system, and some reduction in the powers of the president.
 Although Jumblatt probably will complain that the reforms announced by
 Franjiyah promise only part of what he has been recommending, he may
 conclude-if the reforms are actually implemented-that he has won as much as he
 could reasonably expect. If his party, which has the largest leftist militia, is satisfied
 and counsels respect for the cease-fire, the other leftists almost certainly will be
 unable to upset it.

 Leaders of the large Christian political parties presumably decided that they
 could accept the reform package because it perpetuates Christian control of the
 presidency and-theoretically, at least-leaves in force the 30-year-old national
 covenant. In addition, the Christians, even before endorsing the final version of the
 reform package, received a reaffirmation of Syria's commitment to guarantee
 Palestinian respect for past agreements limiting fedayeen activities in Lebanon.
 According to one report, leaders of the right-wing Christian militias are
 confident that the Syrians will withdraw the Palestine Liberation Army from
 Lebanon eventually, and hope that Damascus in the meantime will force the
 fedayeen back into the refugee camps.
 The Christians reportedly believe that even if the political settlement falls apart
 and the fighting resumes after the Syrian-controlled troops leave, they will at least
 have won an opportunity to regroup and rearm.
 If the cease-fire holds and the reforms are implemented, the Christians, in
 theory, will be left with much less power to initiate public policy because the
 president will be forced to share his authority to issue decrees with the prime
 minister. In practice this will not change much; the fragility of Lebanon's political
 system over the past several months has obliged the president to secure approval of
 the prime minister before taking any important step.
 However the reforms are implemented, the Christians will retain a veto since
 the president can withhold approval of proposals backed by the prime minister. This
 is likely to become important as the Christians attempt to restrain the more
 powerful prime ministers, including the assertive Karami, who probably will push for
 extensive government programs in education, health, and housing.
 Several of the provisions in the reform package will work to protect the
 political position of Christian leaders.
 --The provision that parliament must approve important issues by a two-thirds
 vote will ensure that Muslim deputies cannot recruit a small number of
 dissident Christians and pass measures harmful to conservative Christian
 interests.
 --The provision for the election of a president by a 55-percent majority after
 the first ballot makes it unlikely that Muslim members would be able to use a
 similar strategy to elect a president from one of the small Christian liberal
 parties despite right-wing Christian opposition.

 The reforms dealing with the civil service and the army are not designed to
 protect the Christians' position, but they appear unlikely to strengthen the Muslims
 either. Equal representation is guaranteed in the top civil service jobs, and the
 Christians for the foreseeable future will be better able to compete for those
 positions to be covered by a merit system.                4
 To the extent that the administrative offices of the government are
 decentralized, it will only increase the capabilities of the Christians to establish a
 truncated Christian state if they should ever conclude that partition is necessary.
 Christians and Muslims will attempt to interpret the provision providing for a
 new defense policy and a strengthened army to their own advantage. In the past, the
 leftists and some Muslim leaders have favored enlarging the army and arming it in a
 way that it can better defend against Israeli attacks; the Christians have favored
 arming the force so that it can better preserve internal security.
 Because the army is now partially disarmed and wholly demoralized, it is
 unlikely that it will be able to play a forceful role in internal security for several
 months, and it is certain that the army will not provide a deterrent to Israel for
 years, if ever.
 Continued peace in Lebanon, therefore, will depend on the continued
 willingness of Syria and the large Palestinian groups to control the Lebanese and
 fedayeen radicals, and on the willingness of the leaders of Lebanon's private militias
 cooperate in implementing the current political a reement.
