 V I ETNAM  WEEKLY                  REVIEW
 HIGHLIGHTS
 PARIS TALKS:  At the 56th session of the Paris talks PRG delegate Dinh
 Ba Thi, substituting for Mme. Nguyen Thi Binh, echoed Mme. Binh's
 attack last week on alleged U.S. chemical warfare in South Vietnam.
 DRV delegate Nguyen Minh Vy focused on President Nixon's 18 February
 foreign policy message, expanding on earlier critical comment in Hanoi
 media.  Unlike last week's VNA report on the session, the account this
 week fails to mention that Ambassador Habib did not present a formal
 statement.
 LE DUC THO ACTIVITIES:  DRV media have not reported the activities of
 Le Duc Tho, who is still in Paris several weeks after he led the North
 Vietnamese delegation to the French CP congress, held 4-8 February.
 Thus there is no mention of the meeting in Paris between Cyrus Eaton,
 Le Duc 7ho, and Xuan Thuy on 26 February at which, according to Western
 press sources, issues related to the talks and to a political settlement
 were discussed.  DRV reports of Le Duc Tho's return to Paris for the
 congress had not mentioned his position as special adviser to the DRV
 delegation at the Paris talks.
 NGUYEN DUY TRINH INTERVIEW:  On 2 March VNA releases the text of a
 26 February Nguyen Duy Trinh interview, granted to a visiting AP representa-
 tive, in which the DRV foreign minister repeats the standard charge that
 the United States has "no interest" in negotiations and the stock position
 that the "correct" path for settlement lies in the NFLSV 10-point
 solution.  Asked about the DRV's view of a cease-fire in South Vietnam,
 Trinh replies with the vague formulation in the 10-point statement that,
 based on the principles of the 10 points, "the parties shall reach
 understanding to the effect of concluding agreements on the relevant
 questions with a view to bringing the war in South Vietnam to an end
 and contributing to the restoration of peace in Vietnam."
 MOSCOW PROPAGANDA:   Commentators continue to criticize the U.S. Vietnamiza-
 tion plan in the usual terms.  In foreign-language commentaries on
 28 February and 1 March, for example, Aleksey Leontyev says there have
 been no basic changes in American policy in Vietnam.  While some army
 units are being pulled out, he says, others are arriving to replace them,
 and since last December the total number of troops has decreased by only
 500 men.  He charges that the Pentagon intends to retain 200,000 to
 250,000 troops in Vietnam "for many years to come" and that the U.S.
 "aggression" is being escalated.

 CONFIDENTIAL            FBIS TRENDS
 4 MARCH 1970
 SOUTH VIETNAM:  Communist news reports routinely reflect scattered military
 action in South Vietnam.  The allied pacification program continues to be
 discussed, with Hanoi radio on 2 March broadcasting the first of a series
 of articles in the DRV army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN which outlines methods
 to defeat pacification, stressing attacks on support forces and the
 Phoenix program.
 The trial. and arrest of South Vietnamese legislator Tran Ngoc Chau is
 noted by Hanoi and Front media.  A 2 March Liberation Radio commentary
 charges routinely that attempts by the GVN to terrorize its opponents
 only reveal its basic weakness.
 NORTH VIETNAM:  Le Duan's views on domestic issues are publicized in
 Hanoi propaganda, incluu',ng NHAN DAN editorials on 26 and 27 February--
 discussing light industry and handicrafts--which quote from his lengthy
 14 February article,  Propaganda in early February similarly gave
 prominent attention to his 1 February party anniversary speech.
 On 1 March Hanoi's domestic service carries a NHAN DAN summary, published
 in the paper the same day, of a talk delivered by Phan Van Dong at a
 college students' congress in January.  Dong acknowledges problems
 relating to the students' attitudes and to the material conditions of the
 universities.  He urges students to help improve conditions and to study
 to be both "red" and "expert."
 INDOCHINESE PEOPLE'S CONFERENCE ANNIVERSARY:  Hanoi marks the 1 March
 anniversary of the 1965 Indochinese People's Conference with a meeting,
 messages to Sihanouk and Souphanouvong. from Ton Duc Thang as head of
 the FatherLand Front, and radio and press comment including a NHAN DAN
 editorial.  Inexplicably, Front media have not publicized the usual
 South Vietnamese message from Nguyen Huu Tho or a meeting on the
 occasion.  But Front comment routinely hails the conference and pledges
 solidarity with the people of Cambodia and Laos.
 PARIS TALCS:  26 FEBRUARY SESSION
 CHEMICAL     Substituting for Mme, Nguyen 'Phi Binh at the 26 February
 WARFARE       session of the Paris talks, PRG delegate Dinh Ba Thi took up
 where Mme. Binh left off' at the previous session and again
 focused on the "abominable crimes" of the United States against South
 Vietnam, particularly the alleged use of chemical warfare.*  Dinh Ba Thi
 *  Alleged allied use of chemicals in South Vietnam is also decried in an
 article by Pham Van Bach, chcir?man of the DRV War Crimes Commission, broad-
 cast by Hanoi radio on 26 February.  The article deprecates President
 Nixon's 25 November statement renouncing germ warfare and restricting
 chemical weapons, but it does not mention the 14 February White House
 announcement extending the restrictions.  It ridicules the idea that
 Congress will approve the 1925 G.neva agreement on gas and germ warfare.

 has in the past substituted for Mme. Binh during her several absences
 from the meetings.  Most recently, he led the PRG delegation at the
 15 January 1970 session and at the two previous sessions.
 In developing last week's charges, Thi repeated the allegation that the
 United States has been waging chemical warfare in the South since 1961
 and is doing so now under the Nixon Administration "on an ever larger
 scale."  He declared in his statement, which Liberation Radio carries
 in full on the 27th, that "it is precisely because of its desire to
 settle the South Vietnam problem correctly that our delegation
 resolutely exposes the U.S. chemical warfare, as well as the whole
 U.S. policy of war of extermination, and demands that the U.S.
 Government stop these crimes at once and put an end immediately to its
 aggressive war.,"
 The PRG representative also restated the standard proposal that if the
 U.S. side announces a total allied troop withdrawal from South Vietnam
 within a six-month period, the parties would then discuss the timetable
 for the withdrawal as well as the security measures guaranteeing the
 safety of the withdrawing forces.
 NIXON REPORT ON    Acting DRV delegation head Nguyen Minh Vy devoted his
 FOREIGN POLICY       statement to criticism of President Nixon's
 18 February foreign policy report along the lines
 of earlier DRV comment.  VNA notes Vy's charge that the report demonstrated
 that U.S. Vietnam policy remains one of prolonging the war, extending the
 U.S. "occupation," and attempting to achieve "neocolonialism."  VNA also
 reports t:11.: three general conclusionsVy drew from the report:  1)  that
 the Administration is dragging out the war and hopes to achieve a position
 of strength through the Vietnamization program, 2) that the United States
 makes only "deceptive and slanderous contentions" concerning issues
 involved in a settlement and is avoiding the pressing demand of world
 public opinion in not withdrawing troops immediately, totally, and
 unconditionally, and 3) that the Administration continues to downgrade
 the talks with a view to undermining the conference.   Taking note of Vy's
 remarks on Laos, VNA repeats his charge that "another undeniable evidence"
 of American "schemes" in Southeast Asia is the "fact" of U.S. escalation
 in Laos.
 ALLIED SPEECHES     The VNA account of the allied delegates' remarks is
 standard.  It says they again "tried to evade the
 fundamental problems and insolently put the blame" on the DRV-PRG side
 for the deadlock at Paris.   Ambassador Lam is routinely portrayed as
 trying "by all means to ward off the condemnation" by the communist side
 and by world public opinion of the Saigon "clique's crime of high
 treason and its crime of serving as a tool" for the United States.
 VNA adds that Lam rehashed old contentions concerning the removal of all
 non-South Vietnamese forces, free elections, "etc."

 The VNA account, unlike last week's, does not acknowledged that U.S.
 Ambassador Habib did not present a formal statement.       It brushes off
 his remarks in the notation that he "again brought up the prisoners-of-war
 problem which had been rejected many times" by the DRV-PRG delegates.
 U._S, POW ISSUE     DRV media have not carried any report like the 2 March
 TASS item, datelined Hanoi, in which a TASS correspondent
 quotes Le Quang Gui, chief of the Post and Telegraph Department of the
 DRV, as saying that 320 captured American airmen have carried on
 correspondence with their families.  According to TASS, this statement
 was risponnive to unspecified remarks by U.S. Paris delegation spokesman
 Steve Ledogar in his 26 February briefing.  The remark the postal director
 appeared to be rebutting was Ledogar's statement that only 175 families
 have received communications from 368 Americans positively identified to
 be under North Vie t,namese detention.  DRV media, following estpblished
 custom, have not reported any of the U.S. spokesman's remarks.
 ALLIED PACIFICATION. PHOENIX PROGRAMS
 The first in an undated series of QUAN DOI NHAN DAN articles on pacif{.ca-
 tion, broadcast by Hanoi on 2 March, describes the people's struggle against
 pacification as "a comprehensive, fierce, long-term, and persistent one
 to gradually and completely defeat" it.
 The article outlines important tasks for thwarting pacification, including
 the annihilation of pacification and support forces and development of
 political and military proselyting offensives.  Detailing the military
 aspects of the struggle against pacification, the article says the
 communists must accurately hit support forces' command headquarters and
 bivouacs and strike at the support forces as soon as they arrive in
 "liberated areas," before they can "commit crimes."
 The article claims that the people have "foiled pacification at its roots,"
 destroying support forces, wiping out the Phoenix intelligence organization,
 and punishing the "cruel police and psywar agents."  It says the Phoenix
 program is used for collecting intelligence and identifying revolutionary
 cadres in order to assassinate or kidnap them.  The Phoenix agents
 are termed the main forces in control]ing and suppressing the people.
 When these agents are annihilated, the article says, the support forces
 are deprived of "eyes and ears."
 Moving on to the pacification teams, the article explains that they are
 responsible for directly building lc,;al GVN administrations and political
 organizations.  To destroy pacification teams, the paper says, the people
 have attacked them in their training camps and command posts.

 II MARCH 1970
 On 1 March the Front radio claims that in 1969 the PLAT' security force
 "punished" thousands of spies and local GVN authorities and caused the
 "disintegration" of more than 23,300 civil defense and other agents.
 The communists are said to have "ini-~ially" smashed the Phoenix plan,
 thus nontributing to the defeat of pacificat9.on and Vietnamization.
 A Hanoi broadcast on 25 February takes note of reports that the CIA
 actively conducted Phoenix operations and attributes to the New York
 TIMES the report that 19,500 people were "liquidated" in 1969 in
 Phoenix operations.
 GVN TRIAL OF SOUTH VIETNAMESE LEGISLATORS
 The recent arrest and trial of South Vietnamese legislator Than Ngoc
 Chau on charges of collusion with the enemy brings predictable comment
 from the communists branding the GVN "fascist and dictatorial."  A
 2 March Liberation Radio commentary declares that the convictions of
 Chou and fellow legislator Hoang Ho "openly trample on the Saigon
 National Assembly."  This event, the radio says, shows that the GVN
 is so weak that it must resort to terrorizing its opponents.  Liberation
 Radio maintains that Thieu is opposed not only by the people but also
 by assemblymen, ARVN members, and GVN administrators.  It adds that anyone
 could be the next victim of terrorization by Thieu, who is being directed
 in this "comedy" by President Nixon.  Another Front radio commentary on
 2 March, noting that the second trial. of Chau was held that day, describes
 his treatment as an "internal purge."
 Hanoi, in a broadcast on 2 March, recounts the Assembly's protests over
 Chau's arrest and reports the manhandling of journalists at the time of
 the arrest,  This broadcast also cites Senator Fulbright's statement
 criticizing the U.S. Embassy for siding with the GVN and his comment
 that Ch au's arrest and trial had "political motives.'`  A short Hanoi
 broadcast on the 3d, citing Western sources, describes Chau's first
 trial as conducted "in a great hurry, lasting only one-half hour,"
 and reports that Chau was sentenced to absentia to 20 years at hard
 labor and Hoang Ho to death.  A QUAN DOI NHAN DAN commentary on the
 trials, noted in the Hanoi radio press review on 4 March, is not yet
 available,

 On the 27th Liberation Radio reports that the fourth emulation congress
 of the western Nam Bo PLAF, held on 18 December 1969, reviewed area
 military achievements during the past two years.  The congress report
 alleged that the allied "scheme" to encroach on the U Minh area as well

 to the editorial, the primary tasks of revolutionary administration
 include developing guerrilla warfare, opposing pacification, and
 protecting and encouraging production.

 PRAM VAN DONG SPEECH TO DRV COLLEGE STUDENTS
 Pham Van Kong's speech to a January congress of the DRV College Students
 Union, summarized by NHAN DAN and broadcast by Hanoi radio on 1 March,
 calls upon the students to become both "red" and "expert."  Stressing the
 importance of learning good study methods, Dong warns the students not
 to "run after a degree" but rather to seek deep understanding and relate
 their studies to the country's present undertakings.  Declaring that the
 country needs "capable, energetic persons who dare to think," Dong adds
 that the DRV does not need people who can only remember enough to pass
 an examination and obtain a degree in order to become cadres like the
 mandarins of the past,

 Recognizing  North  Vietnamese weaknesses in the realm of science and
 technology, Dong criticizes "some among the comrades who have revered
 the U.S. imperialists' science and technology."  He maintains that "science
 and technology are not difficult" and that others can do what the
 United States has done.
 The impact of the war is acknowledged by Dong, who notes shortages of
 materials, warns against the erosion of good habits during "years of
 evacuation," and calls on the students to be aware of the sacrifices
 made by others.  At one point he tells the students that "in the past
 few years, the party and state have tried to create conditions for you
 to continue your studies while hundreds of thousands of youths of our
 country have gone into battle, many cf Ahom  have . . . laid down their
 lives."  Dong notes that in the congress discussions "many comrades
 referred to the South" and adds that it is "thanks to the South
 Vietnamese people's fighting and valiant sacrifices" that the North
 "can have universities with students who can sit and study in a peaceful
 environment."
 Pham Van Dong says the state and party are concerned about training the
 youth, but "we have not acquired conditions to equip even our universities."
 He urges the students to help themselves through strengthened-"collectives"
 and to contribute to building schools while continuing their studies.  On
 the question of student participation in production, he states that the
 schools must participate in such a way as to enhance academic activity,
 and "we are pondering over, assessing, and discussing this question"
 with school officials.
 DRV PEOPLE'S ARMED SECURITY FORCES ANNIVERSARY
 Hanoi radio on 3 March reports an article by Major General Pham Kiet on the
 occasion of the People's Armed Security Forces' 11th anniversary,
 celebrated that day.  The article appeared, according to the broadcast,
 in the 3 March issues of both NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  Typical
 of propaganda since Ho's death which has extolled Ho's contributions in
 various areas, the article cites Ho's solicitude for the security forces
 and pledges the group's allegiance to his teachings.  It recalls Ho's
 warning that "the anti-U.S. resistance may drag on," and it asserts that
 the present situation is "unfolding in accordance with his words."
 Kiet cautions that although the United States is "losing," it will
 "intensify its war of espionage through forms and maneuvers that are
 even more shrewd and cunning."  And he warns that "the reactionary
 clique at home is also looking for every gap among us in order to sow
 division and to engage in opposition and sabotage."  Concluding that
 "new difficulties will appear on the front of maintaining order and

 COMMUNISTS HAIL PLAIN OF JARS VICTORY, SCORE U,S1 "AGGRESSION"
 In authoritative as well as routine propaganda, communist media applaud
 the military successes of the Luot-ian "patriots" in the Plain of Jars
 and assail continued U.S. "aggression."  The NLHX issues another
 Central Committee statement, and the DRV supports ;:i earlier NLHX state-
 ment with a foreign ministry statement.                      Moscow comments authoritatively
 in a `PASS statement, the first in connection with Laos since December
 1967.   The NLHX statement takes brief note of Souvanna Phouma's
 26 February announcement that he will call for a new Geneva conference;
 Peking reports this passage, but Hanoi and Moscow are not known to have
 mentioned Souvanna's remarks.
 PATHET LAO       An NLHX Central Committee statement dated 28 February,
 PROPAGANDA       carried by the Pathet Lao news agency on 2 March, charges
 the Nixon Administration with "i'itensified and expanded"
 aggression.  It describes the military operations launched last August
 in the Plain of Jars as "the largest and most reckless and cruel nibbling
 attack ever undertaken by the United States since it started its aggressive
 war in Laos 15 years ago," and it adds that the use of B-52's for the
 first time in this area is an "extremely serious act of escalation."
 The successes of the "patriots" in the Plain of Jars-Xieng Khouang area
 nevertheless mark "a new step in the growth of the Laotian Patriotic
 Armed Forces and people" and represent a victory in "defense of the
 liberated zone and the fatherland," the statement declares.  It asserts
 the Laotian people's "right to self-defense" and their determination to
 free zone."  It concludes by calling upon the people to unite around
 the "militant alliance" of the NLHX and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces
 in order to "successfully defend the free zone and their fundamental
 national rights."
 The same stress on "defense" recurs in other propaganda.  A "letter" from
 the NLHX Central Committee dated 24 February, broadcast by Pathet Lao
 radio on the 27th, reiterates that the Plain of Jars, Xieng Khouang, and
 Muong Soui "lie deep in what has been the patriotic forces' free zone
 since 1961."  It calls upon the armed forces and people to be vigilant
 against U.S. schemes to retake the area and to "particularly maintain
 their fighting spirit and self-defense right to defend our sacred Plain
 of Jars and Xieng Khouang to the end."  It urges the "people of all
 strata and nationalities" in the "areas temporarily controlled by the
 United States and its lackeys" to "comps l the U.S. imperialists and
 their henchmen to halt their war."

 Uouphariouvong, addressing an NLIIX rally  hailing the victory, called
 upon the armed forces and people to strengthen their vigilance and
 smash now enemy military adventures "while stepping up the building
 up of the liberated zone," according to the Pathet; Lao news agency on
 3 March,   A review of the battles in the Plain of Jars by the news
 agency on 26 February concludes that the armed forces and people are
 determined to fight; still harder "to defend the liberated zone and the
 life and property of the entire people of Laos.,"
 Souvanna Phouma's 26 February announcement that he will call for a
 reconvening of the Geneva conference is acknowledged briefly in the
 28 February NLIIX Central Committee statement.  It scores the United
 States and its allies for "slandering" the NLIIN and the DRV--though
 it does not explicitly mention charges of the DRV troop presence??-and
 for continuing "peace hoaxes."  It notes that they "clamored for the
 holding of the Geneva conference" while B-52 bombings continued.
 In a 4 March commentary the Pathet Lao news agency denounces Souvanna
 Phouma for "worn-out slanders against the NLHX and the DRV" in an
 attempt to belittle the "patriots"' recent victories and alleges
 that ne "sent a letter to the cochairmen of the Geneva conference and
 begged for consultations among the signatories of the 1962 agreement
 to halt violations of Laos' neutrality."  Expressing approval of the
 "correct attitude" of people in the United States like Senators Fulbright
 and Mansfield, who have expressed concern over U.S, involvement in
 Laos, the commentary reasserts the Laotian people's "legitimate right
 of self-defense" against aggression.
 Concern within the United States over the war in Laos is also noted in
 a 27 February Pathet Lao news agency report of statements by Senators
 Fulbright and Symington which also notes briefly that to "counter"
 these statements, Secretary Laird on 22 February "defended" the U.S.
 policy of war expansion in Laos but "did not reply directly" to
 questions on the use of B-52's.  Phoumi Vongvichit, the NLHX Secretary
 General, sent an "urgent message" to the Vietnam Moratorium Committee
 and the New Mobilization Committee in the United States, according to
 the Pathet Lao news agency on 26 February, calling upon them to demand
 cessation of the war in Laos.
 HANOI      A DRV Foreign Ministry statement, carried by VNA on the 26th,
 declares that the DRV Government, "as a signatory to the
 1962 Geneva agreement on Laos," supports the 20 February NLHX Central
 Committee statement and condemns the Nixon Administration for using
 B-52's against the Plain of Jars-Xieng Khouang area and for "stepping
 up" the war in Laos.  Saying that the bombings are of "exterminating
 character and on an unprecedented scale," the statement cites Senator

 the cuital.r.LL1.on in LILOC ILL LOrnU length and Urt'ued that the Nixon
 Administration thus "has furthcr :increased L Ls threat to i;lic, 131Wu

 but, a shill r explicit, rc'fcr?cricu   to a threat to DRV security appears in
 a ;. i February QUAN DOI NIIAN DAN corrunenLtiry praising PuLhcL Lao victories.
 The DRV army paper mlluges that the United States planned to occupy
 the Plain of' Jars indefinitely and to use it as a "opringboard" 1'or
 deeper attacks against.. liberated areas in Laos, to "threaten the DHV'o
 security," and t,o prolong the war in South Vietnam.
 Hanoi takes Secretary Laird to task for his remarks defending U.S. policy
 in Laos.   At the    February Paris scission, DRV representative Nguyen
 Minh Vy discussed Laos at some length, saying that Laird himself on
 22 February "admitted" U.S. "participation" In the war in Laos when he
 said U.S. "involvement" was Lied in with rho safety and security of
 American forces in Vietnam.  Vy added that this "confirms" U.S. designs
 to drag out, the war in South Vietnam and expand it to other parts of
 .Indochina.
 Ql1AN DOI NIIAN DAN cites Laird as saying on the 22d that "U.S. bombing
 in Laos" is "only aimed at cutting off the route to South Vietnam."
 The }ianoi paper neglects to mention that the "route" is the Ifo Chi Minh
 trail.   It adds that, Laird's remark serves only to expose the United
 States as an aggressor because the Plain of Jars, where the air attacks
 arc "concentrated," is in northern Laos and far from South Vietnam.
 A Itanoi domestic broadcast on the 25th says various U.S. senators'
 remarks on 1i-52 raids and escalation have "unmasked" Laird's 22 February
 "allegations" that 'd-52 lombers are "not allowed to carry out activities
 over the Plain of Jars because of technical reasons,"  'I'lie senators'
 statements, says Hanoi, also give the lie to Souvanna Phouma's
 "td. Legations" that, North Vietnam is escalating the war in Laos.
 Other DHV comment, continues to publicize U.S. expressions of concern
 over the situation in Laos.  QUAN DOI NHAP1 DAN on the 28th refers to
 statements by Senators Fulbright, Mansfield, and Mathias criticizing
 intensification of the war, and a Hanoi broadcast in English that day
 notes Senator Symington's call for the recall of Ambassador Godley to

 Moscow has not mentioned Souvanna Phournu'u call for a reconvening of
 the Geneva conference; In the past Soviet media have taken note of
 ouvanna's 1cLters to the Geneva cochairmen--made public on 30 June 1969,
 19 March 1969, and 16 February 1968--either belatedly in routine-level
 propaganda or riot at, all..
 The 'L'ASS statement supports the NLIIX stand that the Laotian people must
 be allowed to settle their own affairs on the basis of the Geneva
 agreements, but In keeping with Soviet propaganda practice it omits the
 NLIIX formulation that this settlement must also be in accord with
 "current realities" in Laos.  TASS concludes by blaming the United
 States for the escalation of armed intervention in Laos which "only
 makes it more difficult to find ways for the solution of the problems
 of Indochina and leads to further heightening of tensions in Southeast
 Asia.."
 Routine Soviet propaganda continues to charge the United States with
 escalation and intensified bombing in Laos.   Moscow is the only
 communist source known to have mentioned the 26-27 February meeting in
 Saigon of U.S. Ambassadors Godley, Unger, and Bunker with Admiral
 McCain and General Abrams.   Brief reports assert that they discussed
 "widening the aggression" in Laos,   On 2 and 3 March TASS cites the
 Washington POST report that the United States has followed a "scorched
 earth" policy in Laos and the POST editorial which, according to TASS,
 accused  the  Administration of "ignoring" Congress and "deceiving" the
 American public about U.S. intentions in Laos.
 Secretary Laird's comments on U.S. policy in Laos draw Soviet censure.
 Bragin, in PRAVDA's International Review on 1 March, labels as a
 "demagogic formula" his "admission" on 26 February that B-52's bomb
 Laotian territory "on '-he pretext of 'defending American positions in
 Vietnam.'"  A TASS commentary by Kharkhov on 27 February says Laird's
 statement "to the effect that the United States is using its Air
 Force in Laos" to defend American positions in South Vietnam is "perhaps
 the first high-level official recognition that American planes subject
 Laotian territory to massive bombings."

 I nutanec, the c:tunpaign peaked In Ito :recon(T week, 12-18 June, when
 protouL propaganda reprr_ocnLed over LIx percent of total brotLdC!LUL
 comment,  and (1wlndlad out by late July.   The current campaign, begun on
 ;'0 Pcbruary, hrw included obnervanee on 2 March of an International. dray
 of protc:.t ugalnut Israeli "aggression" and of uo11durlty with the
 Arabs, prociriirned by the World Peace Council (Wl'C).  TASS on the 2d
 report;:, the WI'C  as  declaring in a statement that Lhe rest of the week
 will be marked with protect actions, the start of' "world-wide action,
 more vigorous and energetic," condemning the United States for its part
 in the escalation of Israeli "aggression," and calling for Israeli
 withdrawal, support of the Palestinian people, and full implementation
 of the November 196'( Security Council resolution.
 The protest campaign iu continuing as of 4 March, with TASS reporting
 publication in the central press of further statement3 and letters
 emanating from pul,lic meetings throughout the country, and from public
 organizations, groups of intelligentsia and other circles, and Soviet
 citizens.   Along w4th the flood of protests, Moscow is waging a
 campaign dcnouncir:g Zionism both in Israel. and abroad and publicizes
 voliement; re.lectionn by Soviet Jewish citizens of "anti-Soviet slander"
 by Israeli of'1'Tcials, heightened by a statement by prominent Soviet
 Jewish citizens presented tit a foreign ministry press conference on
 4 March.
 While the current outcry continues to stress Israel's 12 February
 bombing o1' the UAR metal works at Abu Zabal, there was no immediate
 concerted Soviet campaign in reaction to that incident, but rather
 a staged response, with several days elapsing between the injection
 of each new element.  'T'hus, the TASS statement pegged to Abu Zabal was
 not issued until the 16th; protest meetings first were reported on

 of Jewish nationality" enter the propaganda picture.
 Total Soviet broadcast material related to the Middle East conflict
 rose to 15 percent last week (23 February-1 March).  This is well
 below the 1967 postwar peak, when for two weeks in June the level
 was sustained at about 1+3 percent of total broadcast comment, and
 thereafter gradually diminished.   Aside from the protest campaign,

 with "brirbaric actions of' the Ilitlerltes and with the destruction of
 Coventry and Lidice," as well as with the American "crime" at Son t1y
 in South Victnrun. IZVLS'i'IYA accuses the Israeli leaders of "fanning
 unbridled Zionist and chauvinistic propaganda by sowing enmity and
 hatred for the Arab peoples," "popularizing racist ideas," and trying
 to colonize the Arab population of the occupied lands.  The resolutions,
 it says, also condemn "U.S. imperialism" for encouraging Israel to
 new military adventures.   The editorial refers to the 1967 Security

 SCNIET JEWS PARTICIPATE THROUGH LETTERS, PRESS CONFERENCE
 T1te inJecLiort of the ;Soviet Jewish element; into the protest campaign
 appears. to have begun on 24 February with Lhc publication of letters
 t'rorn "citizen: of Jewish nationality" in PRAVDA, followed on the
 26th by similar letters in SOVIET RUSSIA, TRUD, find presumably in
 IZVESTIYA's evening edition (letters appeared In the morning edition
 the following clay).   TAUS on the 26Lh reports IZVESTIYA its "continuing"
 to publish such letters, but an examination of IZVEST'IYA morning editions
 since the 2OL}t reveals no communications from Jewish citizens until
 the         although .1ZVESTIYA on the 21st did report that letters were
 being received in the editorial of'f'ice.  THUD on the ',16th carried not
 only letters from Jewish citizens but. also a half-page selection of
 articles under the }reading "Equals Among Equals" dealing with the
 poc,ition of Jews in the Soviet Union and condemning Israeli policy in
 the Middle East.
 The P'11)Qrs also report prominently that a session of the I3irobidzhan
 city soviet of' the Jewish Autonomous Oblast adopted a resolution
 condemning the Israeli "aggression" against the Arabs and denouncing
 "with wrath and indignation that brazen statement" by Israel's prime
 minister that Israel must become the native land of all Jews.  PRAVDA
 and IZVESTIYA on the 28th both headline on page one a resolution of
 the Jewish Autonomous Oblast aktiv on the Middle East which rejects
 "anti-Soviet slander" by Israeli officials about anti-Semitism in the
 Soviet Union.  Moscow synagogue Rabbi Levin, in an interview reported
 by 'L'ASS on the 20th and appearing in IZVESTIYA the next day, makes no
 outright denial of Soviet anti-Semitism brut. asserts that it is
 "flourishing" in the United States.

 that.  the' United Stutcu is rapidly declining curd must change it.s tactics
 to eon-cal. 1La "aggrcaoive and expansionist" goals.   While mockingly
 drawing a picture of diminishing American power as reflected in the
 1'r?euident;'3 a-knowledgrnents of a changing world situation, Poking has
 twoided JubjecLi.ng tiro President to vituperative personal attack.
 ,pip. ;'U February discuuolorr contains Peking's most direct response in
 recent. cornrnent, to U.S. overtures to the PRC, a subject the Chinese have
 c;t.udiously ignored in the stream of propaganda on the United States
 during the period sines tiro Warsaw talks were resumed.   NCNA dismisses
 the I'r osident;' c; principle of negotiation and accuses him of talking
 hypocritically about, his desire to improve relations with the PRC, but
 it mentions only his reaffirmation of the treaty commitment to the
 Nationalist Chinese while passing over his references to the Warsaw talks
 !urd to unilateral measures Laken by the Adriiltjlstrution to normalize
 relations    Peking has acknowledged the Warsaw talks this year only in
 it;-, terse announcements concerning the sessions.
 NCNA views the President's stand on Taiwan as exposing "the aggressive
 nut.ure" of the United States in its "criminal scheme" ',o create two
 Chinau    While the commentary goes on to scorn the President's professed
 desire for peace as reflecting an intent to "forcibly occupy the world"
 and to suppress revolutionary movements, NCNA fails to develop the
 onrc-standard picture of the United States as an aggressive power
 rner:ucing the Asian peoples and seeking to encircle China.  The
 commentary devotes minimal attention to Vietnam, observing that the
 United States intends to intensify the war by means of the Vietnamization
 program.
 'lire absence of the encirclement theme is conspicuous in NCNA's discussion
 of the President's remarks on Soviet-U.S. relations.  While ignoring his
 references to the Sino-Soviet conflict, NCNA says his report indicates
 an intent to intensify Washington's "contention and collusion" with the

 Soviets.   Unlike past Chinese comment which stressed collusive and
 congrucruL Sov:LcL arid American policies, the elements of contention are
 highlighted in the NCNA diecuds i_g.n.
 A sense of pride is reflected in NCNA's observation that the President's
 report acknowledged China's "growing strength and her tremendous
 Influence" in the world and that it expressed "apprehensions" over
 the PRC's development of nuclear weapons.  In keeping with Peking's
 failure to report the President's 30 January announcement of a r.ew
 phase of ABM construction as a defense against a Chinese nuclear
 capability, NCIVAignores _the statements ithe roreign policy report
 relating the ABM system to a PRC nuclear threat.
 Peking's sensitivity to Japan's role in Washington's Asian strategy is
 evident in NCNA's charge that the United States wants to revive Japanese
 militarism so that it will cooperate in an alleged U.S. effort to
 suppress Asian revolutionary movements and carry out "counterrevolutionary
 criminal activities against China."  Such a ch-trge fits with other recent
 signs of Peking's preoccupation with Japan's potential in the Asian power
 arena, particularly in connection with the Taiwan issue.  While the NCNA
 commentary on the President's report fails to mention the liberation
 of Taiwan, recent Chinese comment has taken particular exception to
 Japanese statements regarding Taiwan and has raised the question of
 force in charging that the Japanese threaten to use force to prevent the
 PRC from liberating the island.

 MOSCOW PRESSES POLEMICS AS BORDER CLASH ANNIVERSARY IGNORED
 Moscow and Peking remain silent on the current Sino-Soviet talks as the
 first anniversary of the 2 March 1969 clash on the Ussuri passed without
 notice by either side.  Moscow has sustained its general polemical pressure
 on the Chinese, highlighted by press articles examining the causes and
 effects of the PRC's war preparations campaign.  Following the recent
 pattern, Peking has initiated no commentary devoted to Soviet policies
 since the widely disseminated 21 February NCNA attack on Soviet-Czechoslovak
 vela+iors which responded to Moscow's anti-Chinese polemic? and rebuked
 Brezhnev and Kirilenko by name.  In Peking's sole recent reference to the
 border:, NCNA on 28 February quoted the pro-Peking Australian communist
 paper VANGUARD as charging that "the Soviet revisionist traitors continue
 their aggressive activities on the Chinese border."
 S:),ri.et press comment on Chinese war preparations concentrates on domestic
 motives, though the charge of Chinese expansionism is revived in an
 Andreyev article in the weekly NEW TIMES, No, 9 (26 February) which cites
 as evidence the "intensive construction of airfields, ammunition dumps,
 and main highways to China's border provinces and regions."  The domestic
 effects of the militarization of China are examined in an article by two
 economists writing in LITERARY GAZETTE on 25 February and in a KOMSOMOLSKAYA
 PRAVDA article on the 28th alleging that priority allocation of funds to
 military needs has lowered living standards and exhausted the economy.
 KGMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA observes that Peking's arms buildup, "particularly
 the acceleration of the nuclear, missile program," is diverting the lion's
 share of resources from peaceful economic activities
 Moscow has used the proxy of foreign communists to criticize the Chinese
 in the name of the international communist movement and to express concern
 over the Warsaw talks.  PRAVDA on 26 February cites recent comments by
 Gus Hall which stressed the harm being caused by "the nationalist, anti-
 Soviet, splitting activities of the Mao Tse-tung leadership" and viewed
 mutual anti-Sovietism as the basis for the Sino-U,S. talks.  PRAVDA on
 the 25th summarizes a speech at a theoretical conference in Moscow by a
 French communist r   lling the harm inflicted "on our cause by the CCP
 leaders' break wit._  larxism-Leninism and their deviation toward positions
 of chauvinism and nationalism."
 Soviet broadcasts to China have served as the channel for rebuttals of
 Peking's attacks on Soviet policies regarding Czechoslovakia, the Middle
 East, and Taiwan.  A Radio Peace and Progress commentary in Mandarin on
 27 February turned back Peking's charge of Soviet support for a two-Chinas
 policy by arguing that Peking's "adventurist and great-power chauvinistic"

 line is largely to blame for alienating countries from the PRC and
 causing increasing support for the two-Chinas position.  Other Peace
 and Progress broadcasts to China have probed PRC leadership differences,
 as in a commentary on 25 February linking Red Guard activity with a
 "constantly" changing "balance of power" in Peking.       Another commentary
 on the 25th observed that rises and falls in influence of various groups
 "reflect the ugly power struggle within the ruling clique and show that
 this or that leader is gaining power."  The commentaries do not identify
 the leaders involved.

 USSR  AND  EAST  EUROPE
 REASSERTIONS OF ROMANIAN INDEPENDENCE AROUSE SOVIET IRE
 Ren?twed Soviet propaganda pressurc on Romania iu evident in a 28 February
 PRAVDA article by Gabuniya which sternly iocturao "those" who give
 prL rity ti national obligations at the expenue of international duties
 and underestimate the danger of Western idc,.7lcgical penetration of the
 .icc:i:alic.t countries.  An article in Sofia's NARODNA ARMIYA on 25 February
 has ra uimi:l.ar thrust, calling for further Warsaw Pact "integration" and
 h;tt r1y accusing "functionaries" who advocate Dole reliance on one's
 ,:wn forces :f' otabbing international socialism in the back?
 Both articles seem responsive chiefly to Romanian efforts to publicly
 play down the "imperialist threat" and the need for strengthened pact
 ;ill ' ance:, at a time when the Soviet Union is seeking to build up the
 111"Lan.:e  and to combat ideological attacks from European communist its
 well as noncommunist intellectuals.  Soviet concern over the challenge
 from European intellectuals had been manifested in two lengthy articles
 in the CPSU theoretical journal KOMMUNIST, signed to the press 22 January,
 which attacked increasing "distortions" of Marxist-Leninist theory and
 focused on the "revisionist" views of Yugoslav theoreticians, the French
 CP maverick Roger Garaudy, Austrian dissident Ernst Fisher, and New Left
 ideologue Herbert Marcuse.  KOMMUNIST warned that such "humanist" views
 of socialism could lead to "ideological disarmament of the socialist world"
 and :oncluded that "it would be politically shortsighted to underestimate
 t.his danger."
 PRAVDA      The Gabuniya article in PRAVDA, playing the theme of increased
 ARTICLE     vigilance against "revisionism, opportunism, and nationalism,"
 comes down hard on people--unnamed--who place national above
 international interests and underestimate the "imperialist" danger,
 Arguing that imperialism poses an increasing threat to the socialist
 countries, the article lectures that "it is impossible to remain outside
 the sphere of class struggle, to counterpose proletarian internationalism
 to national sovereignty, and to alienate the interests of the working
 class of one's on country from the international interests of all countries
 without breaking with Marxism-Leninism."
 Gabuniya assails the "untenable" position of "those who declare that in
 our time, when socialism is winning an increasing number of victories,
 bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideology presents no danger to the
 :.~untries which are creating a new society."  In another passage which
 may be related to Romania's efforts to improve ties with the West, it
 declares that "the revisionist concept of coexistence as a policy allegedly
 leading to "gradual 'convergence'" of the opposing systems "has nothing
 in common with Marxism-Leninism."

 particularly its developing relations with the West.  The second one
 ret'1(rcts Bucharest's efl'orts to use the Lenin centenary for its own
 propaganda purposes by advancing a flexible Honianian view of the future
 of Marxism-Leninism and serving notice that Romania will fight its own
 ideological battles.
 According to the AGERPRES account, the second article is based on a speech
 made by Stefan Voicu, the Journal's chief' editor, at a 19-23 January
 meeting in Moscow devoted to "The Increased Role of. Leninism in the
 ConLemporury Epoch and Criticism of Anticommunism."  The meeting was one
 of a series in preparation for the Lenin celebration--the latest was
 held        February--which Moscow has been using as forums to muster
 orthodox opposition to the ideological challenge from European
 intellectuals in the aftermath of the Czechoslovak events.
 The article based on the speech underlines the notion that Marx and
 Lenin "did not and could not gave any answer to all the problems posed
 by the subsequent social evolution and did not leave ready-made solutions
 to their successors in the field of social practice and thinking,
 because they lived in another epoch."   In the "wide confrontation of ideas
 that is now taking place internationally," the Romanian journal argues,
 communist countries should not discredit their case by resorting to
 "invective" against their opponents.   It is also a mistake, the article
 adds, to label other socialist countries "adversaries" because they hold
 different views.  "Nobody," LUPTA DE CLASA declares, "can claim to
 have said the last word on one problem or another," and no one can
 declare another's views to be "non-Marxist or even anticommunist."

 CONCERN OVER ALIENATION EVINCED IN CO4 ENT ON POLISH TRIAL
 Con(?crn over the impact of the Czcchos.Iovak events on youth and
 lntelloct,uala in the socialist countries is conveyed in comment: from
 Moscow and Prague its we LL as from Warsaw on the 9-,111 February trial of
 five young "divers iorlists" in the Polish capital.  Their offenses involved
 uot i vi ty "harmful to the basic interests" of Poland and socialist
 cons t.ru(:tion, consisting of circulation at home and abroad of "anti-Polish
 publicat.Ions" put out. by the "hosti.le" emigre KULTURA Literary Institute
 in Paris.
 Soviet. and East European media normally confine their coverage of trials
 in other bloc countries to news reports on their conclusion.   The GDR
 followed the normal practice this time,  But Moscow's KOMSOMOLSKAYA
 P1AVDA on the 22d, two days before the trial ended, carried a comment
 at.'-ributed to a Polish professor of jurisprudence which highlighted the
 charge that, the accused had smt(ggled provocative materials into both
 Poland and Czechoslovakia and praised the Warsaw court's indictment of
 them,  The Soviet youth paper denounced efforts by "imperialist propaganda
 radio centers" to portray the accused as "simply '-.ntellectuals' whose
 only crime is that they dared to take independent views."  It remarked
 that  the defendants had. chosen the read of "treachery and treason" despite
 the fact that they had "taken full advantage of the opportunities offered
 the young generation by the socialist system."
 Two days after the trial ended, Prague's now hardline RUDE PRAVO seized
 on a statement by the alleged leader of the subversive group, Kozlowski,
 that "Alexander Dubcek had always been his id,)l as regards the
 realization of a policy of 'democratic socialism,' of 'socialism with a
 human face.'"  In this connection RUDE PRAVO recall'd Kozlowski's arrest
 "in Czechoslovakia" in May 1969--shortly after Dubce:,.'s replacement
 by Husak as party First Secretary.  The paper expressed regret that
 "some" of the defense attorneys had failed to mention "to what bitter
 ends Dubcek's policy had led Czechoslovakia and what damage it caused to
 the entire international communist movement,"  It generalized that the

 referred, Ions puinLedly, to the group's alleged instructions "Lo study
 the poosibilit.y of' crcaLi.ng a radio station with diversionary functions
 in one of the socialist countries."
 Warsaw's treatment of the trial departs from post-Stalin practice in
 beating the propaganda drums at its conclusion, rather than carrying only
 a running account of the proceedings.  Thus TI(YBUNA LUDU on the 25th
 declared that the defendants "were administered a just punishment"
 and stressed "the magnanimity of the people's state."  Evidently anxious
 to head off any new eruption of utrect demonstrations, the Warsaw court
 had reduced even further the already mild sentences, ranging from
 3 to 4-and-a-half years, pointing to the applicability of the 21 July 1969
 amnesty and "taking into consideration the penitence of some of the
 accused."  TRYI3UNA LUDU warned "enemies" of the state that.they cannot
 count on leniency in the future.
 A YAP commentary on 1 March identified as one aim of the Paris-bused plot
 an "investigation of the atmosphere in the army, including the Soviet
 troops stationed in Czechoslovakia," and stressed the importance, "not
 only in connection with this trial," of "the milieu from which the
 accused come."   It said the subversive group "attracted young people
 who had acquired university degrees in Poland and either emigrated to
 Israel or refused to return home."  PAP viewed the trial as a "warning
 for all people who enter the slippery road of harming our :ountry and
 the achievements of socialism."

 '1'A''SJ prompt,.ly reported on 2 March that President Nixon apologized to
 I'ornpidou and made cu; "emergency trip" for an "unscheduled meeting" in
 New York with the French president and for the dinner in honor of
 Pompidou which Vice President Agnew was to have attended originally.
 Commentator Vik';or Levin on 26 February described for Soviet domestic
 listeners the "unscrupulous" attitude of the American press, which he
 said had waged an openly anti-French campaign, and the "vociferous
 demonstrations" by "hooligan thugs" and "political gangsters" who
 greeted Pompidou with "unrepeatable" epithets.   While granting that "it
 goes without saying that the U.S. authorities hastened to dissociate
 themselves" from these demonstrations, Levin added:  "The impression
 is created that, judging by everything, this has been done far from
 sincerely."  As evidence he mentioned the refusal of city mayors to
 meet Pompidou and the "demonstrative exit" by "many members" of
 Congress during Pompidou's address.   Levin concluded that Washington
 POST observer Chalmers Roberts was correct in his assessment that the
 Pompidou-Nixon meetings had no impact on the considerable differences
 between Washington and Paris, and that France remains "fully determined
 to proceed along her own way, without being led by Washington."
 TASS reports of 25 and 26 February on the conclusion of the Nixon-
 Pompidou talks stressed that because no official communique was issued,
 "i~, is believed this indicates that the heads of the two states have
 failed" to attain closer agreement o*) 'Lmportant foreign policy matters.
 TASS reportage of the Chicago portion of Pompidou's trip said that the
 "rabid anti-French campaign" was engineered by "Zionist and pro-Israeli
 circles" and that even many American newsmen had noted that police
 treated demonstrators "extremely liberally."  TASS also pointed out that
 after his Chicago visit Pompidou considered breaking off his trip and
 returning to Paris and that he called the "carefully organized"
 demonstrations against him "a stain on the reputation of the United States."

 WEST  GERMANY
 GROKIKO VISIT FAILS TO SOFTEN GDR HARD LINE ON WEST GERMANY
 Continuing hardline, uttALementu by GDH leaders and In East German
 newspaper cdLt;orialu In the wt.,,(,, or ;iov.iet foreign MI.n:Lster Gr.ottyyko'u
 Iebruary vis:Lt to the GDH Indicate that the visit had little
 effect on the GDH'a public posture.  The communique on Gromyko'u visit
 showed come uignu of Sovict-inspired moderation, not sustained in Eaat
 German comment, and alight variations between the Soviet and East
 German versions of the communique could be read au suggestive of
 differences between the two sides.  GDR media have carried only brief
 reports on the first two days of "technical and protocol talks" in
 East Berlin to prepare for a proposed meeting between GDR Premier
 Stoph and Chancellor Brandt.
 COMMUNIQUE ON     The communique on Gromyko'u GDR visit, issued in
 GROMYKO VISIT     oomewhat variant texts by GDR and Soviet media on
 27 February, employs standard terminology in reaffirming
 "complete identity of views" on the international situation, the development
 of GDR-USSR relations, the need for recognition of the postwar territorial
 status quo and of GDR and Polish borders, and the importance of a European
 security conference.
 A direct acknowledgment that West Germany's new "Ostpolitik" was discussed
 appears far down in the communique, as one of the final items.  Noting
 that the GDR and USSR foreign ministers "exchanged information and views
 concerning the contacts maintained with the FRG Government," the communique
 declares that there was "complete identity of views regarding the issues
 raised in these contacts and the relevant steps taken."  It adds the stock
 argument in favor of ,he GDR-proposed draft treaty with the FRG and
 concludes with a mild call for the FRG Government to show "responsibility
 and realism in its policy."
 The East German version of the document highlights first Gromyko's visit
 with Ulbricht, Stoph, and other top leaders and says they had "an
 extensive talk," where the Moscow version--in the domestic service and
 the press--gives pride of place to a statement that GDR Foreign Minister
 Winzer and Gromyko held talks, then adds that Gron{yko was received for
 "a talk" by Ulb richt and others.  In another variation, in a passage on
 the need for European countries to consolidate relations and safeguard
 peace by "recognizing the territorial status quo" in Europe, the GDR
 version cites "especially" the need to recognize the GDR-FRG borders
 and the Oder-Neisse border.  The Moscow version omits "especially."

 of East-We,t German and Polish borders and of the "realities" of postwar
 Europe, he scrupulously avoided even mentioning the GDR draft treaty
 wsnd made no specific references to "international law" as a basis for
 GDR-FRG relations.  His GDR hosts, on the other hand, constantly mentioned
 the draft treaty and international law as a basis for inter-German
 relations.
 Although Gromyko thus failed to give his authoritative endorsement to
 the GDR's requirement for recognition, Moscow radio commt.,r,tators continue
 to argue for i..  For example, for the first time since Brandt took
 office, a Moscow commentary--by Andreyev for German listeners on 3 March--
 attempts a detailed refutation of Brandt's formulation that the two parts
 cf Germany "allegedly are not foreign countries to each other" and that
 their relations therefore must be of a special nature.  Andreyev calls
 this Brandt-Scheel view "not only unduly complicated but also illogical"
 and "counter to international law."  He argues that it constitutes an
 FRG attempt "to impose a lack of equality on the GDR" and achieve a
 "higher status" for the FRG.  He refers repeatedly to international law
 a& the basis for FRG-GDR relations, arguing that "viewed from the premise
 of international law, no special relations are possible between the GDR
 and the FRG since they involve relations between sovereign states,"
 .Andreyev concludes that the Brandt-Scheel viewpoint on GDR relations "is
 too ridiculous to evoke criticism."  Such arguments by Bonn, he adds,
 awe an attempt "to dodge recognition of the obvious fact that two
 sovereign and independent states exist on the territory of the late
 German Reich and that the relations between them can be established only
 and exclusively on the basis of international law,"

 A NEUES DEUTSCIILJIND editorial on 1 March reiterates demands for FRG
 recognition of the GDR and scoffs at any agreement on renunciation of
 force if such recognition is not forthcoming.   The paper says such tin
 agreement "is not worth the paper i'  is written on" if ono side still
 seeks to revioe front;ieru.  Such a6reements can be "valid under
 intern=ational law" only between states recognizing each other under
 that law, NEUES DEUTSCIILAND contends.
