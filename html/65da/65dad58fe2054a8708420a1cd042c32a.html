 SUBJECT                 Discussion Between PRC Representative
 and AIT/Taipei Director
 DISTRIBUTION            Assistant Secretary Wolfowitz, EA (only)
 Mr. Gaston Sigur, NSC (only)
 Introduction:
 I ran into Ji at the Metropolitan Club at breakfast on my
 first day in Washington, D.C., May 25.   He was breakfasting
 with Chris Phillips, NCUSCT.   Ji, whom I have known for years,
 seemed surprised and pleased to run into me.  Coincidentally,
 I had been thinking for sometime of the need for someone from
 Taiwan to give a realities briefing to a PRC official; so,
 later, I suggested to Under Secretary Eagleburger that I see
 Ji.   He approved.   I then cleared it with Assistant Secretary
 Wolfowitz and Gaston Sigur of the NSC.   I also informed the
 Vice President.    All were for it.   The meeting with Ji was  ,
 actually set up by David Laux.  We described it as a private,
 discreet "iinmeeting."   In my view, the meeting was well
 planned and maintained it's confidentiality.   It went off
 without a hitch.   Laux told me that Ji wanted the_meeting and,
 in fact, was clearly anxious for it.  Ji asked my permission
 to brief his Ambassador.   I said I had expected him to. do so
 but that we had informed no one at a level below Assistant
 Secretary Wolfowitz.
 Contents:
 After small talk, Ji initiated a discussion of Taiwan ask-
 ing for my impression of CCK's status and the succession.   I
 told Ji CCK was physically weak but mentally strong.   The
 recent shift downgrading Wang Sheng, and this was a clear
 perception in Taiwan, had strengthened the hand of the -

 technocrats.  The Wang Sheng move had been carefully
 orchestrated with five other military moves carried out
 at the same time.  There was, however, the exquisite dish
 of the extension of CCK's half-brother, Chiang Wei-kuo.
 I commented that the Taiwanese, by and large, supported
 Wei-kuo.  Ji expressed surprise at this.  Ji said it was
 his view that Wang Sheng, after his return from the States,
 was perhaps not actually weakened but was still available
 to assume a powerful role if called on.   I said this was
 an interesting analysis but everything we knew indicated
 his position had been weakened.
 I then said I wanted to show.Ji three symbols which
 might capture for him what was happening in Taiwan:
 -     The first was a tie clasp - a memorial to Chen Wen-
 cheng, the man from Carnegie-Mellon who was killed in
 Taiwan in July, 1981.   I said this represented the passion
 of the Taiwanese and the toughness of the Mainlander-
 controlled security.                           Ji asked me if I had gotten this
 tie clasp publicly and if people knew* what it represented.
 I said it was given to me at a dinner party by oppositionists
 and everyone knew what it meant, but I did not wear it in
 Taiwan.   Ji said he believed that Wang Sheng had been
 behind the murder.  I said, factually speaking, that Wang
 Ching-hsu was the head of the Taiwan Garrison Command at the
 time of Chen's death.
 --    I then showed Ji the brochure of the opening of the
 Johnson and Johnson factory.   I told Ji this represented
 the advancement of Taiwan into techology-intensive industry.
 I believed it was a superb performance of producing consume
 goods at world standards.  I said this was the thrust in
 Taiwan and also the concentration of its most talented
 people.   Ji asked me if the factory was totally owned by
 the U.S.   I said the ownership was shared with the Taiwanese
 but that the U.S. had a controlling interest.
 --    Thirdly, I showed Ji an article in the Asia World,
 printed in Taiwan, showing Fei Xiao-tong gently touching
 hands with the Taiwan representative.   The article depicted
 a recent meeting in Hong Kong which was attended by repre-
 sentatives of both the PRC and Taiwan.   I said this symbolized
 a convergence of Taiwan and the PRC which was publicly
 descried and cartooned in the Taiwan press.   I then pointed
 out to Ji other instances where representatives of the PRC
 and Taiwan had met, including the participation of Chin Hsiao-yi,

 a hard-liner, at a Chicago meeting last year.   I also
 emphasized that the Taiwan decision to include the PRC in
 women's softball in 1982 was made after much agonizing,
 but it was-made at the highest levels.
 Ji then went back to the comment on technology-intensive
 industry and asked if this would create unemployment in
 Taiwan.  I cited the current figure of over 3 percent
 unemployment and said this was high but would probably fall
 as Taiwan came out of the recession of 1982.   I also said a
 certain amount of technological unemployment was inevitable
 but that Taiwan was determined to pursue this course and I
 believed-that in the long-term it was in Taiwan's interest
 to do so.  I then explained to Ji that much of my work involved
 the trademark and patent problem.  A good deal of our time
 was dealing with the specifics of Taiwan's counterfeiting of
 U.S. products.   We tried to direct Taiwan into more construc-.
 tive enterprises, such as using U.S. investment effectively,
 without damaging our own economy.
 I then described to Ji my work to maintain an unofficial
 entity in Taiwan.   I said the three principles of normaliza-
 tion were adhered to -- there were no troops in Taiwan, no
 diplomatic relations and no defense treaty.   We did not fly
 the-U.S. flag, I did not present credentials, I was not con
 firmed by the Senate, my title was "Director," we processed
 but did not issue visas, and we attended no national days.
 I said this was not easy on my staff but we adhered to it.
 I pointed out to Ji that the Taiwanese were always pushing:
 up against this unofficiality but we worked on a daily basis
 to maintain our unofficial. nature.
 I then explained to Ji the constructive forces at work
 in Taiwan for a free trade zone, off-shore banking, a lower
 defense budget -- and all of this had implications for the
 PRC.   I then talked of.the movement in Shanghai to establish
 a regional economic zone and that this also had implications
 for the future; Shanghai's per capita income being much higher
 than the average in China.   I said that earlier, in my days
 with United Technology, we had been obliged. to locate a factory
 in Sichuan when Shanghai made much more economic sense.   Ji
 said that this was all over now with the departure of Hua
 Kuo-feng.
 I then took the conversation back to trends towards
 greater contacts and exchanges between the PRC and Taiwan.

 Although Taiwan could publicly reject the "san tong"
 (three contacts), it's private posture was something else.
 I told Ji that the Taiwanese press had openly criticized
 the K1'IT for its hypocrisy in this respect.  On the one hand
 the KNT was against trade, contact and communications.  On
 the other, it benefitted from huge indirect trade, frequent
 trips to the PRC and kept in regular touch with relatives
 there.  I then talked to Ji of the recent developments in
 agriculture involving the AVRDC in Taiwan and said that I
 was interested that our mutual friend, Han Xu, had been
 involved with Dr.?Tso and Judy Poon in Beijing while I had
 seen them ire Taipei.  This involved contacts between
 agriculturalists in Taiwan and the PRC which included the
 KMT Secretary-General and the Vice Minister of Agriculture
 in the PRC.   I then went into the prospects for indirect
 trade which had quintupled in the-last two years.  Although
 it had recently decreased, this was largely due to economic
 reasons in the PRC.
 I told Ji that Americans who meddled in the process of
 reunification, or who prematurely sought to accelerate it,
 sometimes got burned.  I then referred specifically to
 Ray Cline and Anna Chennault.   Ji was surprised that Ray
 could try to function as an intermediary.   I suggested that
 he talk to his own security people for the background.   I
 pointed out to Ji that although an evolutionary process was
 in motion leading to some convergence between the PRC and
 Taiwan, the situation in Taiwan was fragile.   If it was
 pushed too hard, the Taiwanese, who were naturally suspicious,
 provincial.and pragmatic, could react strongly.   I said a
 quick look at violence in the history of Taiwan would       k   I
 support this, and cited uprisings against the Ching dynasty
 (the Lin Shuang-wen rebellion'), the Japanese, and the Chinese
 Nationalists in 1947.   I then gave Ji a brief rundown of
 Taiwan's history pointing out that the Taiwanese historically
 were pirates and fighters and advanced in the pioneering
 spirit.
 I then talked briefly of the riots in Kaohsiung in
 December, 1979.   Ji contributed his interpretation that it
 was the Taiwan independence types who overplayed their hand
 and gave the KMT an excuse to react strongly.   I did not
 dispute this analysis but pointed out that it was the passion
 and motives of the riots that were disturbing.  I had
 travelled throughout Taiwan and heard many Taiwanese speak
 with passion about their relationship with the Mainlanders.

 This passion was not concerned with reunification but the
 retention of the individuality of the Taiwanese.   Ji then
 told me an anecdote based on his wife's contacts in Taiwan.
 He said that the Taiwan/Mainlander relationship was more
 comfortable now, there was more inter-marriage and mutual
 acceptability.  I said that Wei Yung had researched this
 situation carefully, using polling techniques, and contacted
 over 8,000 people in Taiwan.  His conclusions supported
 those of Ji's wife but I said that some facts were contrary
 to these self-serving findings.   I said our visa applications
 were up, green-card holders were proliferating and in our
 own samplings in Taiwan, the frictions were clearly still
 there.  In this respect I pointed out to Ji that precipitous
 moves could be destabilizing.  On the other hand, I said that
 anyone reading the Taiwan press would see that there had
 been a positive evolution in coverage of the Mainland which
 was .reflected both in the news and in editorials.  I said a
 recent returnee to Taiwan, who is an expert on China, had
 .detected a striking evolution in the outspokenness of the
 Taiwanese and in the media coverage of the Mainland.   (Al-
 though I did not mention his name, I was referring to
 Bill Gleysteen's recent report on Taiwan.)
 Ji then gave me a line which he repeated several times.
 It-was his tape.  He said that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan
 would be disruptive to U.S.-PRC relations.  Ji, himself,
 was for a stable Taiwan and insisted that the PRC was no
 threat to Taiwan.   Fukien, he said, had-been converted to
 commercial objectives so why were U.S. arms sales needed?
 They should be stopped as soon as possible.  I said that Ji
 needed to understand the structure of Taiwan or, in his' '
 terminology, the masses.   I said it was ironic that myself,
 an American, should be lecturing a communist (Ji) on the
 importance of the masses.  I pointed out a careful balance
 existed in Taiwan which could be destroyed by any precipitous
 moves.   The military and security forces were part of the
 balance and they should not be undercut in any drastic way.
 I pointed out that there were always Taiwanese extremists
 who would benefit by drastic change.   Some of these extremists
 were in the U.S. and they should be dealt with carefully.
 I pointed out specifically the case of Hsu Hsin-liang.
 (Comment:  I thought that Ji looked a little bit embarrassed
 at this point.   There are indications that the PRC may be
 trying to reach Hsu.)
 Ji then said that the PRC wanted good relations with
 the U.S., but these would be disrupted by a continuation of

 arms sales to Taiwan.   People on both sides of the Straits
 were Chinese and they could work things out.   China should
 be reunified.   All Chinese had in their hearts the desire
 to return to their homeland to be with their families.  Ji
 then added that I should not get him wrong -- he was an
 optimist.   He was confident that things would work out all
 around.
 I said I was an optimist too but skill and patience
 were required.  Again I said, imagine me, a Westerner,
 counseling a Chinese on the value of patience.   I was also
 optimistic that eventually the.Chinese could work things
 out among themselves.
 I then cited Premier Sun's speech of June 10, 1982 on
 natural convergence, given sufficient time.   Ji said he had
 also noted Sun's speech and that Sun had said unpleasant
 things about the PRC.   I said that in my view the contents
 were relatively mild and quite constructive.   I pointed out
 that later Sun had had to retreat somewhat under pressure
 from the hard-liners, and we all knew about hard-liners.
 I asked Ji if there were an equivalent to Senator Goldwater
 in the PRC.   He commented that perhaps these.existed at the
 medium-level but that high-level types had disappeared with
 the death of Lin Piao in.1971.
 Ji then asked me about Fred Chien, using his Chinese
 name, Chien Fu.   I first said Chien was a Yalie.   Ji commented,
 "we all make mistakes."   (Comment: Earlier I had chided Ji'.on
 going to a Harvard reunion saying that "nobody was perfect."
 I was probably getting a well-deserved rejoinder.)   I s$id
 Chien was bright, aggressive and as far as I knew, had
 played within the ground rules.   Ji asked if Chien had come
 to the States with the idea that he would become Foreign
 Minister eventually.   I said-that one reason Chien had come
 to the States, a reason which Ji would understand as a
 Chinese, was to educate his two children.
 Ji then asked if Americans had "unmeetings" with CCNAA
 types such as the "unmeeting", I was having with him right now.
 I said that seemed logical to me but I deferred to my friends
 in Washington.   Ji then suggested that Chien Fu had directed
 the anti-U.S. riots during the Christopher visit in December,
 1978, after normalization.   I said this sounded like Roger
 Sullivan talk.   I commented that Chien, in my view, was an
 apparatchik and would be an implementer rather than a director.

 Ji speculated when a PRC ambassador could meet with Chien
 and talk with him -- perhaps the Ambassador after the
 current one, Zhang Wenjin.  I said it would be best to
 let nature take its course.  Ji said he, himself, was
 ready to see CCNAA people any time but they usually backed
 off.   I told him it was better not to force these matters.
 My. experience was that when Taiwan was pushed too hard
 openly, it usually backed away.   Contacts were, of course,
 going on but were carried out in a different mode.  I then
 went back to AVRDC as one way to get contacts moving --
 where there was a common interest (agriculture) and where
 there was an appropriate existing mechanism (AVRDC).  I
 commented that KMT Setretary-General, Chiang Yen-shih, a
 good man, was personally involved in this.   Ji seemed un-_
 familiar with this whole case so I gave him a brief explana-
 tion.
 I then talked to Ji about Taiwan history, including the
 short-lived republic in 1895 and the differing views among
 Taiwanese at that time concerning their association with the
 Mainland.   The literati under Liu Yung-fu saw Taiwan linked
 to China but there were others who differed, sometimes
 violently.   I then moved to the current scene and said that
 pragmatism was always evident among Chinese and a. good many
 were getting U.S. green cards, as I had pointed out earlier.
 This included a number of the ruling aristocracy.  There were
 now some brilliant green-card holders who were returning to
 Taiwan and who were doing constructive things for the island.
 This included experienced managers and technicians who had-
 created some of the most successful companies at the Hsen,
 Chu Science and Industrial Park.   Ji said he had heard that
 the percentage of Taiwanese students not returning was very
 high.   I said the estimates I had were as high as 80 percent
 but the statistical base was weak.
 Ji then repeated that arms sales to Taiwan should be
 stopped.   He pointed out the deep feelings of the Chinese in
 the Mainland on Taiwan.   I answered him that I understood
 these PRC feelings well and reminded him that he and I had
 had a long discussion during the Bush visit to China in
 August, 1980, when I had had a first-hand experience of their
 strong feelings from Deng Xiaoping himself.   Ji then referred
 to our long conversation in December, 1980, during the
 transition period.  At that time I had given Ji, Zhang Zai
 and Han Xu a detailed account of the domestic feelings in the
 U.S. about Taiwan.  Ji said that was one of our most construc-
 tive sessions.  I said to him it was one of the best Chinese
 meals I had had.   We then went back into history and .I told

 him of Li Hung-Chang, who ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895
 at Shimonoseki.   The reaction in China, at that time, had
 been very strong against Li and he probably would have been
 hanged if not protected by the crumbling Ching dynasty.
 Ji said that Li was simply a traitor.   I then said that Li,
 in one of his memoirs, had written Formosa off as a good
 riddance because it. was populated by a band of pirates.
 Although Taiwan still had pirates who were currently
 employed in counterfeiting foreign goods, it still had made
 considerable economic progress and that the military support
 was part of its stability and confidence.  I pointed out.
 that constructive moves were underway to reduce military
 expenditures and to look outward economically.   Still,
 Taiwanese did not see the PRC in a benign light.  History
 had told them a good deal about the Mainland.  They were
 cautious and it behooved others to be cautious also.
 I then told Ji of Taiwan's problems in modernization,
 which included a growing crime rate.   Taiwan had to be
 competitive against the other newly-industrialized countries
 like South Korea and Singapore.   My feeling was -- let this
 evolutionary process work.
 Ji then said since there were Taiwanese who wanted to
 cut the military budget and also open Taiwan to the outside
 world, we should then cut off arms sales.  Ji then added
 that a peaceful solution could not be linked to reduced arms
 sales as this was an infringement of Chinese sovereignty.
 I said this was where we differed but differences among
 friends were solvable.  He agreed and said that this was
 also his hope.
 The meeting ended in a flurry of four character phrases
 (chen yu).   Ji said, "In a long night there were many
 dreams" (yeh Chang meng duo), meaning a lot could happen.
 if the delays were too long.   I said my only "dream" phrase
 was "bai tien zuo meng."  Ji said that implied futility --
 one who dreamed in the daytime.   I quickly said my favorite
 was "shou ju dai tu" -- a man should not wait foolishly
 for good things to happen.
 Ji asked when he might see me again.   I said perhaps
 during the next football season.   He said, "in the winter?"
 I said, "the football season is in the fall."
