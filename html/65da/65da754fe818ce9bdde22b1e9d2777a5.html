 [Station contributing commentator's article:  "In Performing Scientific and Technological
 Work, We Should Make the Promotion of Economic Development Our Primary Task"]
 [Text]  The major readjustment of our national economy is designed to gradually rationalize
 our economic structure and find a way to expand the production of society by primarily
 relying on running existing enterprises well, improving production techniques and raising
 economic efficiency.  Recently, the State Scientific and Technological Commission held a
 scientific and technological work conference and studied the policy concerning science
 and technology.  It has been decided that in performing scientific and technological work
 we should make the promotion of economic development our primary task.  We should make
 still more, remarkable contributions to agricultural development, the development of con-
 sumer goods production, the rational technological transformation of existing enterprises
 and the realization of our long-range economic plan.
 Science and technology should be coordinated with economic and social development.  We
 must attach great importance to the factor of science and technology while working out
 such details of economic plans as economic objectives, economic structural changes,
 the rational utilization of resources, the distribution of productive forces, the
 orientation of the technological transformation of enterprises, the employment structure,
 population control, medical care and environmental protection.  When we select the
 priority scientific and technological projects and decide the proportion, scope and speed
 of progress of various research work, we must consider the necessity and feasibility
 in a certain stage of economic and social development.
 We should emphasize technological research and development for production.
 While continuing the necessary research and development.of high-grade, pre-
 cision and advanced science and technology, we should from now on mobilize
 and organize scientific and technological personnel in a more comprehensive
 way in all fields of our country and make great efforts to step up the
 research and development of productive technology.  The research on produc-
 tive technology should be done to promote the development of inexpensive
 good commodities to meet market demand.  We should coordinate scientific
 research, design and production and not stop only at exhibits and samples.

 ;a should step up the technological development of industrial and mining enterprises and
 opularize relevant experiences.  The industrial and mining enterprises should make
 ,echnical innovations in a comprehensive way, actively apply new technology to improve
 ;he quality of products and accelerate the production of new generations of products.
 Oaly in this way can they constantly improve their technology, enhance the competitive
 power of their products, make quick responses to market changes and quickly improve
 economic effects.  This is the only way to modernization.
 oeshould encourage and organize the scientific-and technological personnel of various
 scientific research organizations and institutions of higher education to actively support
 the scientific and technological work of industrial and mining enterprises by popularizing
 scientific and technological achievements, cooperating in research and offering consulta-
 tion.  We should see to it that basic scientific research progresses step by step and on
 sfirm foundation.  We should develop and step up basic scientific research directly
 affecting the economy in a planned'way.  We should learn, absorb and digest foreign
 scientific and technological achievements as an important way to develop our own science
 and technology.  We should not try to do everything from scratch nor attempt to invent
 everything by ourselves.  In learning from foreign countries, we do not have to go after
 the newest and most advanced in everything, but should consider our economic needs and
 our technological foundation.  In learning from foreign countries, we should not weaken
 or slacken our scientific and technological research at home.  When we import foreign
 technology, we will be unable to truly absorb and digest it if we do not have our own
 scientific and technological research to match it.

 [Commentator's article:  "Science and Technology Must Be Developed in Coordination With
 the National Economy in the Course of Readjustment"]
 (Text)  Over the past year, our country's scientific and technological front has made
 fruitful efforts and achieved remarkable successes.   In order to make steady progress,
 in 1981, our scientific and technological work must be carried out in coordination with
 the readjustment of the national economy.
 Our country's national economy must be greatly readjusted this year.  Under the
 circumstances in which our investments in capital construction projects have been reduced.
 readjustment of the national economy mainly depends on giving full play to the roles of
 the existing enterprises which must carry out rational technological transformation and
 reforms in economic structures, cut down the consumption of raw materials, improve the
 quality of products, raise efficiency and strive for beneficial results.  With the basic
 change in the policy on our economic construction, we must rely on science and technology
 in a more effective way, give full play to the role played by science and technology in
 promoting productive forces and use science and technology to achieve better quality of
 products, greater economic benefits and higher speed. [paragraph continues)
 cur scientific and technological work must make still greater contributions to promoting
 *rricultural production, developing the production of our people's articles for daily
 use, promoting technological transformation and progress in our existing enterprises and
 developing the national economy in the days to come. In a word, the tasks for our scientists
 Vid technological front have not become lighter but have become heavier and more pressing.
 njring the period for economic readjustment, there is also a question of readjusting
 scientific and technological undertakings. To achieve a proper readjustment, we must clear
 and overcome the influence of the "left," conscientiously proceed from our national
 conditions and further sum up experiences and lessons. The following are some of our
 problems:  The. problem of blindly striving to catch up with and surpass advanced countries
 and losing contact with Chinese reality; the problem of not paying great attention to the
 agricultural and light industrial science and technology; the problem of not paying great
 attention to the scientific and technological work of enterprises; the problem
 redundant scientific research projects and tasks; the problem of building some redundant
 scientific research organs and making irrational overall plans; the problem of having an
 improper ratio between various types of scientific research work and various types of
 personnel in scientific research organs; the problem of not paying great attention to
 the rational use and training of scientific and technological personnel; and the problems
 of having great shortcomings in our scientific and technological management system and of
 having an urgent need to raise the standard of management. We must face these problems
 squarely, conscientiously carry out proper readjustments and enable our science and
 technology to advance more healthily, sturdily and steadily. For this reason, while trying

 ut evet'v. possible way to strengthen that scientific and technological work which meets
 the needs of the developing economy, we must also readjust all impractical plans, reduce
 the speed and scale of some projects and cancel other projects.  In this sense, the
 scientific and technological front also holds the question of retreat in the course of
 readjustment.
 To properly readjust our scientific and technological workand to properly strengthen and
 cancel some of our scientific and technological projects, we must pay special attention
 to coordinating scientific and technological development with economic and social develop-
 ment, coordinate our scientific and technological readjustment with the readjustment of
 the whole national economy and regard promoting the development of the national economy as
 the most important task. According to the spirit of the recently held national conference
 on scientific and technological work, we should pay attention to the following few questions
 regarding the guiding principle for the development of science and technology:
 First, the development of science and technology must be brought into the orbit of the
 plan for developing the national economy and there should be a unified plan for developing
 science, technology and the national economy. We should attach importance to scientific
 and technological factors when we give consideration to making policy decisions and mapping
 out plans for economic and social development such as deciding  on the targets of economic
 development, transforming economic structures, making changes in consumptive structures,
 making rational use of resources, arranging productive forces, choosing policies on
 technology and economy, deciding on the orientation of enterprise transformation, proving
 the necessity of important construction projects and projects of an earlier stage, creat-
 ing more jobs, controlling population growth and promoting environmental protection,
 public health work, labor safety and educational reform.
 Second, we must attach importance to and strengthen research on production techniques and
 correctly choose from the available techniques and from a rational technological structure.
 In the coming period, qur country cannot carry out many capital-intensive technological
 projects that consume large amounts of energy resources, but should actively develop those
 advanced technological projects that require high-level technical knowhow, are suitable
 for our country and consume smaller amounts of energy resources. In the course of readjust-
 ment, we must achieve the three-in-one unity of advanced technology, productive feasibility
 and rational economy and pay special attention to handling some important problems in our
 economic construction which demand prompt solution.   [paragraph continues]
 These problems include the problem of, energy conservation, the problem of popularizing
 achievements in agricultural scientific research, the problem of developing good and cheap
 articles for people's daily use and building materials, the problem of raising the basic
 technological level of our manufacturing industry and the problem of improving the quality
 and competitive ability of our export, commodities.
 Third, we should attach greater importance to and strengthen the work in popularizing
 achievements in applied science and technology.  There has been very unbalanced economic
 development in various areas of our country.  An important reason for this unbalanced
 development is that there are great differences in the technological levels of various
 areas.   If we popularize the technology of advanced areas and enterprises among backward
 areas and enterprises and popularize the application of many new techniques and technology
 that are available in China according to local conditions, we shall not necessarily spend
 a lot of money on this kind of popularization and we can achieve rather quickly some
 relatively great economic results, thus enabling our country's national economic output
 value and revenue to increase by a big'margin.

 Fourth, we must make full use of the scientific and technological forces of the existing
 factories, mines and enterprises, make full use of the capital and material conditions of
 our enterprises and further strengthen the work in exploiting the technological forces of
 our enterprises.  We must encourage and organize scientific and .technological forces in
 all fields to actively support the technological exploitation and scientific experiments
 carried out by our factories, mines, enterprises and rural areas.  We should energetically
 advocate "circulating knowhow" and strengthen the mutual infiltration and "hybridization"
 among different branches of learning and technology.  We should adopt measures to encourage.
 our scientific and technological personnel to go to the border areas, factories, mines,
 enterprises and rural areas to give assistance to the work there, and we may also encourage
 them to do part-time jobs or consultative work in such places.
 Fifth, within the limits of security regulations, we should try in every possible way
 to introduce achievements in military scientific research, most advanced branches of
 military technology and even some scientific management methods to civilian units.   In
 the course of readjustment, the national defense scientific and technological system should
 use its relatively superior manpower and material resources to make more contributions
 to promoting national economic construction.
 Sixth, we must persist in mastering, assimilating and digesting foreign scientific and
 technological achievements and regard this way of doing things as an important way to
 develop our country's science ano technology.  We must study with an open mind and be
 good at studying.  During the readjustment period, our country will proceed in all cases
 from the needs of the national economy and the conditions of our technological foundations
 and resources and will only selectively import foreign technology and software.  Generally
 speaking, our country will no longer import complete sets of equipment.  In carrying out
 our scientific and technological work, we must pay special attention to linking the import
 of. foreign technology with the work in studying and digesting imported foreign technology
 and in manufacturing complete sets of equipment and also pay special attention to linking
 the import of foreign technology with the work in transforming technology in old enter-
 prises.
 Seventh, we must also ensure that basic research can be gradually developed on a stable
 basis.  Wtih regard to some basic research projects which are of strategic significance
 to the long-term development  of the national economy and to the raising of the people's
 living standard, and with regard to some most advanced branches of science and technology
 which touch upon the modernization of our national defense, we -should rationally readjust
 and concentrate our forces to quicken the pace of carrying out such research in order to,
 'strive for a breakthrough at an early date.
 In the course of the readjustment of the national economy, the retrenchment of national
 financial expenditure will bring about some temporary problems in our scientific and
 technological work.  We think that there is no reason whatsoever for any undertaking to
 use the word "strengthening" or the world "developing" as an excuse for increasing the
 number of organs and personnel and the amount of capital.   [paragraph continues]

 Ye must conscientiously study the ways to spend money rationally and use it where it is
 Deeded most. If we rationally organize our business and raise our management standard,
 can frequently "get more done for less money."  Of course, this does not mean that the
 :evelopment of science and, technology does not need money.  We are trying to say that in
 the face of temporary difficulties, we should try in every possible way to create con-
 ditions and to "open all financial avenues."  For example, from now on, we should
 distribute funds according to scientific research projects, use funds in a concentrated
 dray,  support good projects and support competition.  We should actively popularize the
 'crosswise" and "lengthwise" scientific research contract system.  According to this
 s stem, on the premise of fulfilling state plans and tasks, a scientific research unit
 can increase its income and make up deficiencies caused by insufficient state appropria-
 tions through taking on commission research projects that are not listed in state plans,
 through transferring technology or through offering technological consultative services.
 The funds for the development of and research on technology in factories, mines and
 enterprises should be taken from factories, mines and enterprises.  Such funds should
 either come from their production funds or should be deducted from their profits earned
 due to achievements in the research.  Many areas have already implemented these measures
 vbich are effeictive in practice.  We should also give consideration to emulating the
 ?:trial methods of offering scientific and technological loans" decided by Sichuan Province
 and the Sichuan branch of the People's Bank of China and open up new ways to win
 scientific and technological funds. After the existing three types of scientific and technologi-
 aldevelopment expenses have been renamed scientific and technological funds,  all departments
 and areas may draw a certain amount of money from their renewal and reform funds and other types of
 funds and classify this money as "scientific and technological development funds" which should be
 used for handling the current national economic construction problems demanding prompt solution.
 Achievements in all research tasks that have been fulfilled by certain areas or units should be
 popularized through a compensable tranfer of the possession of achievements in scientific
 research.  We should try in every possible way to avoid carrying out unnecessary and
 repetitive research projects and oppose squandering funds.  In a word, through the reform
 in financial, banking and other administrative systems and the implementation of the
 nethod of integrating administrative orders with economic management, we not only can
 open up new ways to win scientific research funds but can also spend funds thriftily
 and rationally.  It all depends on the human factor and it is well worth doing!
 The current further readjustment of the national economy will affect the situation as
 & whole, produce an impact on every field and bring about a series of new problems in
 scientific and technological work.  Some problems are foreseeable and other problems may
 be expected.  Therefore, the leading comrades of party committees and governments at all
 levels must unite with and lead the masses of cadres and people and be prepared to?use
 their indomitable will and make industrious efforts to successfully carry out a large
 amount of difficult and painstaking ideological, political and organizational work.   In
 particular, they must do well in grasping ideological and political education which is
 the key link.  These problems can surely be solved &tep by step in the course of read-
 justment as long as party organizations at all levels correctly and effectively give
 full play to their organizational roles on the basis of strengthening ideological and
 political work.

 RENMIN RIBAO CALLS FOR SELF-RELIANCE IN MODERNIZATION
 HK260800 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 23 Feb 81 p 2
 [Commentator's article:  "We Must Have Confidence in Our Own Strength"]
 [Text] The Chinese people are industrious and brave.  Since the founding of new China,
 they have, under the leadership of the Communist Party, opened up numerous mines, built
 numerous railway lines and erected numerous bridges all over the land by relying on their
 bare hands and their wisdom.  A number of the large-scale construction and scientific
 projects have 1ad wide repercussions at home and abroad.  They include the Panzhihua Iron
 and Steel Comp ny, the Daqing oilfield, the bridge across the Chang Jiang, atomic and
 hydrogen bomb tests and the test firing of intercontinental missiles.  Today, this paper
 is running a~report on the Gezhouba key water control project on the Chang Jiang.  Work.
 on this project, from design to manufacture of equipment and installation, has been done
 solely by Chinese engineers, technicians, and workers.  Facts prove that under the leader-
 ship of the Communist Party and under the socialist system, the Chinese people are fully
 capable of carrying out large-scale construction by relying on their own strength.  It
 is foreseeable that the Chinese people can achieve the four modernizations by relying on',"
 their own strength.  Depreciating ourselves, not having faith in our own strength, lacking,.
 confidence and not having any aspirations are not to be tolerated.  We must have confidence'
 in our own strength and have revolutionary aspirations at all times.
 Since the Gezhouba key water control project victoriously filled in the gap with its
 cofferdam, the raging Chang Jiang has been stemmed.  A project of such magnitude and
 involving such complicated technology is unprecedented in China.  It is also-rarely seen
 in the world.  It furnishes us with the essential experience we need in building key
 projects on big rivers and in the comprehensive exploitation of our country's rich water
 resources.
 The stemming of the river at Gezhouba saw the great display of the spirit of socialist
 coordination.  Working in close cooperation, cadres and workers from units at central and
 local levels, in the front and in the rear, all contributed toward stemming the river.
 The worksite teemed with people and trucks.  Their tasks were arduous.  The leading cadres
 'studied everything carefully, made rational arrangements and gave elaborate directions.
 The masses of workers observed discipline and stood fast at their posts.   Since every-
 thing was in good order, the river was successfully stemmed at one fell swoop.  This
 fully reveals the leadership level and organizational ability of our working class in
 building large-scale projects.

 The Cezhouha project also displayed thr- e,tergy of our woikers, tschntciaus and cadroiu.
 Under difficult conditions, they ate and :slept at the worksite, worked day in. and day
 out and displayed great tenacity.  They finally won their race against time and accom-
 plished the task of stemming the river before the dry season.  This heralds a new chapter
 in the Chinese people's history of conquering the Chang Jiang.  Facts show that economic
 construction calls for an undaunted spirit of getting on with the job.  With this spirit,
 we will not slacken off in the face of difficulties and will not be discouraged when we
 encounter setbacks.  We are in the middle of a large-scale economic readjustment and are
 faced with many difficulties.  For this reason, we must display a sense of responsibility
 as masters of the country, start with ourselves and strive to be conscientious men of
 action.  Mr Lu Xun said:  "Since ancient times, people who quietly immersed, themselves
 in hard work could be found among us."  We must inherit and carry forward this spirit of
 the Chinese nation.
 The Gezhouba project gave full play- to the role of experts and technicians.  Technicians
 in the fields of surveying, design and construction did a great many calculations and
 hydrographic examinations and verifications.  The engineering bureau and technological
 department responsible for the project convened a number of professional meetings attended
 by relevant colleges and universities and research and design departments all over the
 country.   [paragraph continues]
 At these meetings, they discussed at length proposals concerning river-stemming techniques,
 repeatedly compared the proposals and paid special attention to hearing and drawing on the
 opinions of experts and scholars on water conservancy and hydroelectricity from all parts
 of the country.  Because they pooled the wisdom of the masses and respected the views of
 experts and technicians, work at the Gezhouba project proceeded more smoothly at the latter
 stage. In undertaking every item of production and construction, we must invite experts
 'to take part and leading cadres must consult experts. In this way, we can leave fewer
 loopholes and avoid detours in work.
 We have full confidence in our motherland's future and have unshakable faith in our own
 strength.  We are determined to overcome all difficulties on the road of advance and
 build China into a modern and powerful socialist country and have faith that we can succeed.

 RENNIN RIBAO ON FOREIGN ECONOMIC, TRADE TIES
 OW251401 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0732 GMT 25 Feb 81
 [Text]  Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA)--In an editorial today entitled "Economic and Trade
 Relations With Foreign Countries Must Serve the Readjustment of the National Economy,"
 RENMIN RIBAO says that at present when the policy of readjusting the national economy
 is being carried out throughout the country, the central task in economic and trade rela-
 tions with foreign countries is to make them positively serve the needs of readjustment
 of the national economy.
 The editorial points out: As the root cause of the "left" errors made in economic work over
 the past many years has not been eliminated, imbalances have appeared in various sectors
 of the national economy. The influence of "left" deviationist thinking in our economic and
 trade relations with foreign countries can be seen from the following facts: 1) We failed
 to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the policy of maintaining independence, keeping
 the initiative in our own hands and relying on our own efforts and,   in developing the
 national economy, neglected the important role of promoting economic and technical exchange
 and cooperation with foreign countries.  2) We failed to proceed from reality and, being
 overanxious to get quick results, committed excesses in introducing equipment and tech-
 nology from abroad without considering our own capabilities, thus aggravating the im-
 balances in the national economy.  All this runs counter to the open-door economic policy
 laid down by the party's third plenary session and must be overcome.  We must follow the
 correct guiding principles for the work regarding economic and trade relations with foreign
 countries.
 How can economic and trade relations with foreign countries best serve the readjustment
 of the national economy?  The editorial says:  First, it is necessary to develop produc-
 tion and continue to expand our export trade.                       We must incessantly consolidate and expand
 the established international market.  Though the export volume of certain commodities
 may decline in the, future, the fairly marked development of agriculture and light industry
 during  the period of readjustment is expected to provide a better source of commodities
 for export'.  In view of the fairly good foundations and great export potential of our
 machinery processing industry, we should make our imports serve our export goals. In other
 words, we should import, raw materials and export them as finished products.  Especially
 there is plenty of rood for the development of labor-intensive processing by using imported
 raw materials.  By -improving the quality of export commodities, redesigning the packaging
 and raising efficiency in fulfilling contracts, we will be able to earn more foreign exchange.
 The editorial emphasizes: Efforts should be made to strengthen import and foreign exchange
 controls Foreign exchange is difficult to obtain, and therefore we must use our foreign
 exchange where it is needed most.  Many countries encourage exports but limit imports.  In
 view of our country's deficit in the balance of revenues and expenditures and its im-
 mediate and long-range needs, we must strictly control both import trade and use, of
 foreign exchange, formulate relevant policies and establish rigid methods of control.

 In transmitting the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council's "circular," the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions added an instruction.  The instruction said:  In order to rescue
 a drowning child, Comrades Gao Yuntao and Tian Jiyue honorably sacrificed their precious
 lives.  Their self-sacrificing spirit and lofty moral character reflect the mental outlook
 of China's working class, cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party over a long period of
 time.  The lofty moral character of Comrades Gao Yuntao and Tian Jiyue is in sharp contrast
 with the decadent thinking and behavior of benefitting oneself at the expense of others,
 of pursuing private ends and of "doing everything for money" and is a strong repudiation of
 the ultraindividualist bourgeois outlook on life.  The two comrades' heroic deeds have set
 a brilliant example for the working class in our country.
 The All-China Federation also urged trade union organizations at all levels to publicize
 the glorious deeds of Comrades Gao Yuntao and Tian Jiyue among staffs and workers, to use
 every trade union function to vigorously commend good persons, good things and the advanced,.
 to strengthen ideological and political work among staffs and workers, to conscientiously
 implement the forum's guidelines on grassroot work and to do a good job in mass work so as
 to further mobilize  the enthusiasm of the broad masses of staffs and workers in building
 socialism, making greater contributions to economic readjustment and

 XINHUA INTERVIEWS SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY OFFICIAL
 OW231244 Beijing XINHUA in English 1220 GMT 23 Feb 81
 [Text]  Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) --Speaking to China's scientific and research communities
 today, the vice-minister of the State Scientific and Technological Commission Tong Dalin
 said scientific priorities must be realigned consistentwith China's current economic
 readjustment.
 In an interview with XINHUA, Tong said, "Science and technology are primarily to serve
 economic construction.  This is-the new guideline for the development of China's science
 and technology in the period of readjustment."
 Tong said a five-point guideline had been formulated at a recent national policy-making
 conference on science and technology.  The guideline established:  Science and technology
 will be coordinated with the growth of the economy and social needs, the primary purpose
 being the acceleration of economic development; production technologies and their appropriate
 application should be a primary focus; industrial and mining enterprises should expand tech-
 nological research and popularize the results; basic research should increase steadily and
 gradually; foreign scientific and technological advances should be studied for assimilation
 into China's own research.
 In keeping with the new guidelines, many programs will gear to present development priorities
 such as energy, improvement of agriculture, light industry and the streamlining of already
 extant enterprises.  Some research projects, said Tong, such as construction of telescopes,
 nuclear reactors and linear accelerators will be postponed.  Recalling some of China's past
 research successes in nuclear weaponry, aerospace and genetic engineering, Tong nevertheless
 emphasized the necessity of focusing on production technologies in the slowed economic
 climate.
 "The readjustment is a big change for the scientific and technological work in China," he
 said.  "It is dictated by the needs of the economy and social development.  China is already'
 readjusting its bcience and technology," Tong finished, "We are making an effort to put that' 11
 readjustment on solid ground.
 The party members and the CYL members are advanced elements among the masses.
 They should play an exemplary role in the course of building a civilization imbued
 with the socialist spirit.  The cadres and the party's leading cadres in particular
 should take the lead in following the practice of decorum and courtesy in their
 private lives.   Conductiag activities regarding decorum and courtesy is an
 important step in building a civilization imbued with the socialist spirit.
 Party committees at all Levels and the grassroots-level party organizations
 should adopt practical measures to support the proposal put forward by the nine
 mass organizations.

 RENNIN RIBAO ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY IN PRODUCTION
 EK100512 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 27 Feb 81 p 1
 [Cemunentator's article: "Grasp Science and Technology To Boost Production"]
 [Text) In the course of our economic readjustment, promoting this year's industrial and
 agricultural production is an important matter.  To promote our industrial and agricultur-
 al production, we must give full play to science and technology.  The State Scientific
 and Technological Commission has issued a circular calling on scientific and technolo-
 gical workers throughout the country to suggest ways and means for promoting China's
 economic construction.  Suggesting ways and means for promoting China's economic construc-
 tion is a honorable task of the Chinese scientific and technological workers.  This call
 will certainly be warmly supported and welcomed by the vast numbers pf scientific and tech-
 nological workers and the masses of cadres and people.
 Two of the "leftist" manifestations in economic construction are underestimating the role
 of science and disrespecting economic laws and suggestions made by scientific and tech-
 nological workers.  We must conscientiously correct these deviations.  Our economic
 readjustment does not primarily depend on an increase in capital construction projects
 to develop social productive forces.  In fact, our economic readjustment primarily
 depends on giving full play to the roles played by our existing enterprises.  However,
 if we do not attach importance to science and technology and do not give full play to
 science and technology, it will greatly constrict the giving of full play to the roles
 played by the existing enterprises.  As a matter of fact, with the promotion of the
 national economic readjustment, the objective situation is forcing some comrades to
 abandon their previous practices such as contending for capital construction investment
 funds and is also forcing them to seek scientific and technological help and to strive
 for economic results.  In this sense, the readjustment period should serve as a good
 opportunity for us to greatly promote our scientific and technological work and should
 also serve as a good opportunity for the masses of scientific and technological personnel
 to give full play to their abilities..
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, a series of correct
 rural policies formulated by the party Central Committee have already manifested their
 tremendous strength in our rural areas.  The broad masses of peasants are showing un-
 precedented concern for attaining achievements in their work and for production tech-
 nology.  In 1980 many areas adopted effective measures to spread suitable advanced tech-
 nology which was warmly welcomed by the peasants and also produced marked results.  At
 present rural areas throughout the country one after another are comprehensively carry-
 ing out farm work.  A11 rural cadres must conscientiously heed the opinions of scientific
 and technological workers and adopt all feasible measures to ensure high and stable
 yields and low costs in this year's agricultural production including farming, forestry,
 animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery.

 This Principle also applies to our industrial production.  At present our light, textile
 and heavy industries have the following widespread drawbacks: high consumption, high
 costs, low efficiency and poor quality.  How are we to reduce industrial production costs
 and consumption and increase the output of marketable and fine products at low prices?
 How can we bring the potentials of our existing industrial enterprises into full play?
 Without science and technology, we cannot begin to talk about tapping the potentials
 and carrying out reform and innovation nor can we achieve the best economic results.
 In short, production command posts at all levels, all factories, mines and enter-
 prises and all communes and brigades engaged in agricultural production should
 regard scientific and technological work as an important means for promoting the
 development of production.
 Scientific and technological research requires a certain period of time and it is
 very difficult to get instant results.  However, we should see that due to many
 years' hard work and great efforts   put forth by the masses of scientific and
 technological personnel, we have accumulated a large number of scientific and
 technological achievements.  Our current industrial. and agricultural production
 work can quickly produce the desired results so long as our scientific and tech-
 nological departments and our production departments act in close coordination,
 make joint efforts, adopt necessary measures, actively apply and spread scientific
 and technological achievements and perfect and manufacture some complete sets of
 equipment.
 To grasp science and technology, we must first respect science, promote technologi-
 cal democracy and give full play to the roles played by experts.  The party Central
 Committee recently noted:   In carrying out a project, we must hold group discussions
 on this project.   Group discussions include seeking the opinions of scientists.
 With regard to scientific and technological issues, we must implement the tech-
 nological responsibility system.   Party organizations at all levels must guarantee
 that experts who are responsible for and command scientific and technological work
 can exercise their functions and powers and do their duty.
 To'grasp science and technology, we must also mobilize the masses of workers and
 peasants and give full play to their initiative and creative power for assiduously
 studying science and technology, carrying out technological innovations and
 popularizing new technology.  We should encourage and support our scientific and
 technological personnel to go right to the frontline of production and to assist
 and guide workers and peasants in carrying out scientific and technological
 activities.

 RENMIN RIBAO ON DIGESTING IMPORTED TECHNOLOGY
 HK130521 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 27 Mar 81 p 2
 [Commentator's article:  "Do a Good Job in Digesting Imported Technology"]
 [Text)  Our aim in importing technology from foreign countries is to improve China's
 technological standards and increase her self-reliance capacity.  By doing a good job 1
 digesting imported technology, we can master advanced technology and ensure that it meets
 our needs for producing all kinds of commodities.  We cannot produce good economic results4
 if we just enthusiastically engage in importing technology without paying attention to_,
 digesting it.  This is a problem that has not yet been solved well; it merits our atten-
 tion.
 In digesting and absorbing technology from abroad, we must first produce products that ar,
 up to standard in accordance with foreign technology; we must then go on to achieve mastate
 through a comprehensive study of the subject and learn how to design product series; and*
 finally we must take foreign technology as the starting point for developing and crea
 new things, and catch up with and surpass advanced world standards.  This is work that
 involves grafting one twig onto another.  To ensure that foreign twigs can take root,?bn`
 blossom and bear fruit in China, we must prepare excellent soil and create the necessary"
 conditions of all kinds.  In importing a technology, we must first select the best fac-
 tories for using it, that is, those factories with relatively good production conditions'
 and relatively high standards of technology and organizational management, that have the",
 capacity to digest and absorb advanced technology.  Factories with weak technical forces,'
 low standards of technology and chaotic management, that cannot carry out production in i
 normal way, cannot be designated as units for accepting imported advanced technology.
 Improper choice of factories was a major cause of previous "indigestion" in certain tecb-
 nology imports.   It is essential to have extensive cooperation in order to digest and
 absorb imported technology.  When using foreign technology to create certain products,
 we are required to provide many more new materials and new-style accessory products, and
 to organize departments and factories cooperating in production to develop new products.
 We must also succeed in dovetailing production and keeping the channels open.
 fits is complex organizational work,'and it is necessary to arrange it by bearing in
 kind the interests of all sectors.  At the same time, in. organizing production in accor-
 'dance with imported technology, the factories must put forward new demands regarding the
 ,standards of designers, craftsmen, management personnel, and operatives, and promptly
 promote training and improvement of these personnel.   It is also necessary to have a
 thole set of encouraging policies, and provide material and spiritual awards for those
 }1o have done well in digesting and absorbing imported technology or have made new
 ;developments in it.   In short, given fertile soil and plenty of sun and rain, twigs from
 abroad will grow into beautiful flowers and yield rich fruit.

 f we fail to make efforts to develop imported advanced technology, "aging" will take
 lace with the passage of time, and it will turn into backward technology.  Hence it is
 Knecessary to persistently combine learning with creating new things.  The reasons why
 some countries have been successful in importing technology is not just that they have
 ,paid relatively economic prices for importing technology within a relatively short period;
 !more important, it is that they have not shrunk from using a lot of money and manpower on
 ?digesting and absorbing such technology and on striving to develop it and create new
 things.  Japan spends several times as much on digesting and absorbing imported technology
 .as she does on importing it.  This shows that the Japanese place the stress on digesting
 land absorbing imported technology.  It also shows how much manpower and finance is needed
 ?in stepping up scientific research before such technology can meet a country's require-
 ments and maintain its relatively advanced nature on the international scene for a long
 time.  In importing certain technology in the past, China had her eyes solely fixed on
 current production and attached no importance to research; we only aimed at "drawing a
 gourd according to the model" and made no efforts in development and new creation.  Unless
 this situation is changed, we will get into a vicious circle of depending entirely on
 imported technology.  Apart from consuming and wasting a lot of state capital, it will be
 very difficult to achieve continuous improvement of domestic technological standards, and
 we will end up trailing along behind foreign countries and blindly following suit.
 Catching up with and surpassing advanced world levels will turn out to be empty talk.   We
 must therefore step up scientific research and put development and new creation in imported
 technology in its proper place.  We must seriously organize coordination between units-
 importing technology and the research units, make full use of existing research forces and
 ensure that they play a still greater role in development and new creation.
 Setting up responsibility systems and putting them on a sound basis is the guarantee for
 doing a good job in digestion.   Factories and management departments importing technology
 must take full responsibility for buying technology, producing products, learning design,
 and carrying out development and new creation.  They must grasp this work all the way
 through.  Units importing technology must accept economic responsibility, and institute
 rewards and fines on the basis of clearly defining the responsibilities and work criteria.
 We must change the past situation whereby a lot of money was spent on technology imports
 and then no products were produced for years, without anyone bothering about it.
 Our country has imported a certain amount of technology in the past few years.  This has
 played an important role in improving our production technology standard.  We should also
 realize that we have "suffered indigestion" over quite a lot of imported technology, and
 the economic results have not been good.  There are many reasons for this.  Obviously the
 most important one is the interference and sabotage caused by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing
 counterrevolutionary cliques;' the errors in our work should not be neglected either.  'Due
 to lack of the spirit of doing things according to our capability and seeking truth from
 facts, and our one-sided pursuit of progress, certain items of imported technology are
 not suited to our national condition; we have spent a lot of money on them without being
 able to digest and absorb them.
 In some cases supplies of raw materials, fuel and power are not guaranteed, and we thus
 end up "cooking a meal without rice"; and certain items are not suited to our needs,
 and there is no market for the products turned out.  We must seriously sum up these
 experiences and lessons and firmly commit them to memory.
 We must have the spirit of respecting science, seeking truth from facts and seriously
 taking responsibility, base our efforts on our actual financial and material strength,
 and analyze our existing technological standards; we must study domestic and internatioaAj
 needs, and investigate the state's energy and raw material supply capacity together
 with the time needed for recouping investment.  On this basis we should decide what and tiM
 what not to import; what to import first and what later, and whether to import complete
 or partial technology.  In this way, even if certain problems occur it is easy to recoupf
 them, and no great losses will be caused..
 Placing the emphasis in importing technology on digesting it should become an important
 guiding principle in our technology import work.   In cases of previous "indigestion" in
 technology imports, we should seriously absorb the lessons and strive to recoup the
 losses.  We must do a thoroughly good job in digesting future technology imports.

 RENMIN RIBAO EXPLAINS SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY
 HK201400 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 7 Apr 81 pp 1, 4
 [Editorial: "Further Clarify the Policy for the Development of Science and
 Technology"]
 [Text]  From now on, we should take the road of improving economic results in developing
 the national economy of our country.  This determines that, while readjusting the economic
 structure and carrying out organization and integration in industry, we should rely more
 ;;;+on the strength of science and technology.  Important changes in the policy of economic
 wnstruction require us to further clarify the policy for developing science and technology.
 In more than 30 years since the founding of the PRC,,tremendous progress has been made in
 science and technology in our country.  We have trained a scientific and technological
 contingent of over 5 million people.  The explosion of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs,
 the launching and recovery of manmade satellites and the successful experiments with long-
 range carrier rockets underscore our attainment of a considerable level in some high-grade,
 precision and advanced science and technology.  At the same time, large numbers of new
 achievements in science and technology have been applied to production and construction,
 which bolsters economic development.  Of course, we should also be aware that the role
 played by science and technology as a productive force in promoting the national economy
 is still not enough.  In all departments of the national economy there are a large number
 of technical problems in production which have not been taken seriously and have remained
 solved for a long time; some comparatively ripe fruits of science and technology have
 not been promptly popularized and applied in production.  For example, we have trial pro-
 duced and produced some precision equipment, but many basic elements and basic progresses
 in the engineering industry are not up to standard; we have developed several hundred
 highly sophisticated raw materials, but have been unable to produce some common steel
 products.  Why does such a state of affairs exist.?  There are two reasons.  The main one is
 that, due to guidance by "leftist" ideas, experts were discriminated against and no
 importance was attached to science and technology.   Whenever the development of production
 was put forward, a large staff would be maintained, capital construction would be increased
 and backward technology would be repeatedly employed.  In addition, no competition was
 allowed in the system of economic management and no attention was paid to economic results.
 So the road for the development of technology in production was blocked.  Another reason
 is that the policy for the development of science and technology has never been clear and
 definite.
 Since the third plenary session, we have been criticizing and correcting "leftist" errors
 in economic work step by step.  We now understand better that we suffered too-heavy losses
 in economic construction in the past 30 years or more because science and technology were
 not duly valued.  Not long ago, a national work conference on science and technology was
 held, at which, in accordance with the instructions of the party Central Committee and the
 State Council, the work experiences in science and technology since the founding of our

 r~ t,,r.+?s c,~ue erning the policy toy developing science and technology were discussed.  The
 meeting held that we should pay attention to correcting the tendency of only attaching
 importance to high-grade, precision and advanced science and technology, ignoring production
 technology which is large in quantity and broad in scope, reaching for what is beyond one's
 grasp and of blindly catching up with and surpassing others.  The meeting explicitly put
 forward the policy for the development of our country's science and technology over the
 coming period.        .'
 The main contents are: to develop science and technology in harmony with the economy and
 society, and the most important task of science and technology as the promotion of the
 development of the economy; to lay emphasis on strengthening the study-of technology in
 production, the selection of correct technology and the rational formation of a technolo-
 gical structure; to strengthen the work of technological development and popularization
 in plants, mines. and enterprises; to ensure progressive development in basic studies on a
 steady basis; and to regard mastering, absorbing and digesting achievements in foreign
 science and technology as an important means for developing our country's science and
 technology.  The core of this policy is that science and technology should first and
 foremost promote the development of the national economy.  Once we have clarified this poi
 we will have shaken off "leftist" influence in scientific and technological work.
 First, this policy is based on the basic aim of scientific research.  What is the aim of S71
 scientific research?  Some say that it is to probe the unknown.  Others say that it is to
 catch up with and surpass advanced world levels.  Still others say that it is to achieve gip;
 results and to train competent personnel....  There are grounds for all these sayings.K
 However, what does all this finally boil down to?  To increase the productive forces.
 we deviate from this fundamental aim, it will be difficult to avoid tendencies such as
 scientific research for its own sake, catching up with and surpassing others for the sake-:
 of doing so and achieving good results just for the sake of achieving them, and in the end;`Y=t
 production cannot be benefitted and it will be difficult to develop the economy and get on"
 with scientific research.
 Second, this policy is based on our national conditions.  The basic characteristics of our*,'.
 country's economy and social development are a large population, a poor foundation to start.+
 with and a low level.  A pressing matter of the moment is to push the whole national econos
 forward by means of readjustment so that it will reach the level of a "fairly affluent
 family."  We have a contingent of scientific and technological workers but the number of
 people in this contingent is not enough and its level cannot be regarded as high.  As our
 country is still poor, funds for scientific research are still quite limited.  Our limited
 strength in scientific research can only be used on the most urgently needed spots.  The WIT
 things were put in the past, such as: catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level,,
 in a fairly short space of time; we want everything foreign countries have; set up a
 complete system in scientific research, and so on, can be cited as proud words showing the
 lofty aspirations and great ideas of the Chinese people, but if they are used for guiding
 practical work for a substantial period of time, we shall be making more haste and less spee:
 Third, this policy is based on practical needs in economic construction.  Drawbacks such as;
 high consumption, high cost of living, low efficiency, low quality, and so on, commonly exix
 in our country's economic construction, and in industrial production in particular.  The
 cause of these is a low technological level in production.  The only way out is to exten-
 sively and steadily develop and adopt appropriate advanced science and technology.  In sole
 countries whose economy, science and technology are well developed, a large portion of the
 increase of the total annual output value of the national economy -is the outcome of
 introducing new achievements in science and technology.  In a developing country like ours,
 the potential in this aspect should even be greater.   it will be quite remarkable if science
 and technology can accelerate the increase of the total output value of industrial and
 agricultural production by 1 percent, and this is entirely possible.

 It is very important to be clear about the policy that science and technology
 should first and foremost promote the development of the national economy.  Once
 the policy is clearly understood and everybody has the same understanding, the
 tasks for scientific research of the whole country, different departments and
 different localities can be put forth and technological policies suitable for
 the state of our country can be formulated in accordance with this policy.  Once
 the policy and tasks are clear, reform of the system of scientific research will
 then have a direction.
 The policy that science and technology should first and foremost promote the
 development of the national economy should be fully reflected in plans for
 developing the national economy and science and technology.  Planning departments
 and technological departments at all levels should make concerted efforts to
 organically integrate plans for developing the national economy with plans for
 developing science and technology.
 In determining the aim of economic construction, carrying out reform of the
 economic structure, rationally allocating the productive forces and utilizing
 resources, reforming technology in enterprises, formulating technological
 .economic policies and so on, we should without exception attach importance to
 factors in science and technology.  In the past, when planning departments
 formulated plans for the national economy, they seldom took into consideration
 scientific and technological factors and were not good at listening to special-
 ists' opinions, so it was difficult to make out good economic plans.  Subse-
 quently, no requirements for scientific and technological departments could be
 put forward.  Very often, scientific and technological departments did not know
 much about economic work and could not grasp scientific and technological prob-
 lems in economic construction which urgently required solution.  With a clear
 policy for the development of science and technology, and with concerted efforts,
 planning, economic, scientific and technological departments can change the state
 of each department being isolated from others, and can really achieve harmonious
 development of science and technology, the economy and society.
 In implementing the policy that science and technology should first and foremost promote
 economic development at the present stage, we should especially attach importance to the
 study of scientific and technological problems closely linked with the people's food,
 clothing, shelter and transportation.  All scientific and technological work should'"
 contribute to increasing the agricultural productive forces, developing a diversified
 economy, and reforming technology in existing enterprises.   If readjustment of the national
 economy is to be carried out smoothly, scientific and technological strength is quite
 indispensable.   Science and technology have bright prospects in the readjustment  of the
 national economy.   Just imagine, which of the weak links in our economic construction and
 short supply of products is not caused by backwardness in science and technology, besides
 Causes such as irrational economic structure, insufficient investment and insufficient
 attention paid in the past?  Therefore, in readjusting the national economy, in addition
 to using strong points to offset the weak ones and changing the economic structure,
 appropriate rein must be given to science and technology.

 Emphasizing that science and technology should first and foremost promote economic
 development does not at all mean that basic theory and high-grade, precision and
 advanced science and technology can be discarded.   Even during the readjustment period
 of the national economy and the work of science and technology, basic study should keep on
 developing on a steady basis, and research and development of some high-grade, precision
 and advanced science and technology directly related to economic development and the
 modernization of national defence should be continued.  Science and technology are an
 organic whole.   Only when basic, applied and developed study are developing in an
 appropriate and well coordinated way can they better promote economic construction.
 If we do not carry out certain basic research and research on high-grade, precision and
 advanced science and technology as a reserve, we shall  be in a passive position when
 production technology needs further improvement.  Therefore, we should understand the
 policy for the development of science and technology correctly and comprehensively.  In
 drawing up plans, we should  take into consideration the short term and long term needs
 of the national economy, guard against one-sidedness, and avoid treating-all things
 equally in an oversimplified way.  A national comprehensive center for the study of
 natural science such as  the Chinese Academy of Science should persist in implementing tht
 correct policy of "laying particular emphasis on the foundation, laying particular
 emphasis on advance and serving the national economy and the construction of national
 defense."
 We have been carrying on, construction for over 30 years.  After some twists and turns,
 economic construction has again taken the road of sound development  through readjustment4
 and reform.  At present, we have further clarified the policy-for  the development of
 science and technology.  We believe that under the leadership of party committees and
 government at all levels and with the concerted  efforts made by scientific and techno-
 logical departments and economic departments in implementing this policy, the work of
 science and technology will be even more vigorous and the whole face of economic
 construction will be greatly changed.

 [Text]  Beijing, 18 Apr (XINHUA)--The GUANGMING DAILY, in a front-page editorial today,
 calls for the establishment of official councils on scientific policy research to advise,
 central authorities on China's economic and social development.  Entitled "The Entire
 Communist Party Must Pay Attention to Science," the editorial stresses the recent State
 Council approval of guidelines for science and technology, which call- the fields to pri-
 marily serve China's current economic restructuring.
 The paper says policy decisions must be made on the basis of scientific research and tech-
 nical evaluation while devising a unified approach to the country's scientific, technological,
 economic and social development.  "Positive and cautious steps should be taken to restructure?
 the current systems of economic and scientific management," the editorial says, "and to
 help promote the coordination of scientific research institutions, factories and consumers.
 of technology."
 The editorial also asks an increase in funds for scientific research proportional to the'..-
 state budget on the basis of a re-examination of current investment policy.  "Researchers
 must discover the most pressing scientific and technological problems in fields of top
 priority," says the editorial, "namely agriculture, light and textile industries, energy
 production, transport, machine building, production of industrial materials and electronics.'

 EAST CHINA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CONFERENCE HELD
 Beijing GUANGMING RIBAO in Chinese 3 May 81 p 2
 [Article by Yang Kaimin [2799 7030 3046]]
 [Text]  A conference on environmental protection for six provinces and one city of
 East China took place 7-9 April under the auspices of the Environmental Protection
 Office of the'State Council.  The participants exchanged their experience and
 studied ways to activate in-depth propaganda activities for environmental protection.
 The propaganda activities for environmental' protection envisaged by the conference
 are as follows:  The various provincial and municipal people's governments must
 play a more active role;-sum up the environmental protection work and commend those
 units and individuals for their satisfactory work; join.together the "five emphases,"
 "four beautifications," and the patriotic health drive in order to make the environ-
 mental protection propaganda more extensive and penetrating.  The conference decid-
 ed that the next round of propaganda activities should focus on "The State Council
 Decision on Strengthening Environmental Protection During the Readjustment of the
 National Economy" so as to make the propaganda cover both the State Council decision
 and the environmental protection law.  Special emphasis should be placed on the
 environmental protection policy-during the readjustment of the national economy.
 The essentials are as follows:  Prevent the spread of new sources of pollution and
 stop the construction of all improperly planned industrial projects which waste
 natural resources and energy and.cause uncontrollable environmental pollution; all
 capital constructions must meet the "three concurrent requirements" just as pollu-
 tion control mustbe included in efforts to explore production potentials or the
 innovation and transformation of-an enterprise; all'the cities and industrial
 centers concerned' should investigate and analyze the sources of environmental pollu-
 tion and work-out.plans to control them according to the degree of urgency.  The
 immediate targets are to control pollution by industries and enterprises located in
 residential areas, protected areas of water supply and areas of scenic and tourist
 interest; and publicize effectively the state environmental protection programs and
 guidelines to get the people's governments at all levels to work for effective pol-
 lution control by including the targets, requirements and implementation measures
 of environmental protection in the plans and programs they formulate for the national
 economy and social development.

 JIEFANG RIBAO ON ELIMINATING 'LEFTISM' IN SCIENCE
 HK090211 Shanghai JIEFANG RIBAO in Chinese 2 Jun 81 p 4
 [Article by Xia Yulong [1115 4416 7893] and Liu Ji [0491 0679]:  "It Is Also
 Necessary To Eliminate Erroneous 'Leftist' Influence on the Science and
 Technology Front"]
 [Text]  (Outline)  "Leftist" errors on the science and technology front are mainly
 expressed as failure to truly regard science and technology as a productive force; the
 serious consequences of this are that the subjects and projects for scientific research
 are incompatible with national economic development and thus get out of joint with it.
 In these circumstances, to simply say that science and technology are productive forces
 is not sufficient to arouse the interest of those engaged in actual economic work. Science
 and technology can have ample scope for displaying their abilities and develop in a
 flourishing way only if scientific circles genuinely regard science and technology as a
 productive force and further integrate science and technology with economic development both
 in topics and in systems of research.  [end of outline]
 The Central Committee and State Council have repeatedly emphasized recently that the whole
 party and the whole country must attach importance to science, that it is necessary to
 rely on science and technology to develop the national economy, and that at the same
 time science and technology must serve economic construction.  This is a major strategic
 guiding principle: it is a correct principle.  The moment science and technology are
 closely integrated with the national economy, they will produce tremendous social
 productive force and speed up the modernization drive.
 We should fully affirm that China's science and technology have rapidly revived and
 developed since the "gang of four" were smashed, and played a beneficial role in national
 economic development.  However, we hold that it is essential to seriously eliminate
 erroneous "leftist" influence in order to better implement the central authorities'
 guiding principle. In other words, it is precisely "leftist" error that has laid "two
 strips of skin" between our national economic planning and science and technology
 development planning, and today this error is still the main obstacle to implementing
 the correct policy decision of the Central Committee and State Council.  An outstanding
 expression of "leftist" error on the economic front is a failure to acknowledge that
 science and technology are a productive force; as a result, on the one hand people act
 in a shortsighted way and discriminate against and even ruin basic research, holding
 that "this kind of money thrown into the pond does not even produce bubbles" with the
 result that basic research undergoes large fluctuations and is unable to gradually attain
 steady development; and on the other hand, and perhaps even more serious, people
 misinterpret the slogan "serve production," "devour" the personnel and manpower for

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 applied research and actually eliminate such research.  This state of affairs reached a
 fantastic peak during the 10-year catastrophe.  This "leftist" error is the reflection of
 the narrowmindedness of small production.  It has done a great deal of harm on the science
 and technology front.  There has been a fundamental change in the situation since the
 "gang of four" were smashed, and especially since the 3d plenary session of the 11th
 Central Committee.  The scientific notion that science and technology are a production
 force has been accepted by people.  However, the problem of the extensive and deep nature.,
 of erroneous "leftist" influence has not yet been solved in practice.  We must therefore
 continue to eliminate the influence of the "leftism" that looks down on science, so as
 to ensure the implementation of the central authorities' principle. There is no doubt at
 all about that.
 The current problem is, are there any "leftist" mistakes and influence on the science
 and technology front, which is directly harmed by "leftist" error? If there are, in what
 respects are they expressed?  With regard to this issue, we take the liberty of making an
 initial test probe so as to arouse discussion.
 According to our observations, the chief expression of "leftist" error on the science
 and technology front is a failure to truly regard science and technology as a pro-
 ductive force, with the result that they get out of joint with economic development.
 There are many expressions of this, the main ones being as follows:
 1.  Paying no heed to the national condition, blindly catching up and overtaking, and
 actually engaging in "world science."  For more than 20 years guiding principles and
 ,schemes for science and technology were determined on the basis of striving to catch
 up with and overtake others, and the idea was publicized that "we must have things that
 foreign countries have and also have things that they do not have."  Hence we took aim
 at all advanced levels in world science and technology and attempted to catchup and
 overtake people at all points of the compass.  However there are many categories and
 branches of modern science, in fact there are as many as 2,400 in the field of science
 and technology alone.  We wanted to do so in all of them and to accomplish at one
 stroke achievements that had taken advanced industrial nations 10 generations of effort.
 Of course this was very difficult to achieve.  The history of modern science and
 technology shows that today no nation or state can provide more than 25 percent of world
 scientific knowledge.  In particular it was even more unrealistic and also uneconomic
 to carry out all-round catching up and overtaking in China, with its current actual
 scientific and economic capability.  In the United States, expenditures on research in
 oil, coal and hydrolectr?c power, research in atomic energy, and research in high-energy
 physics are in the ratios of 100:10:1,   and it is not proper for China and its weak
 foundation and minimal funds to spend a lot of money on "big science" and on scientific
 research which cannot play much of a role in the national economy for several decades.
 In short, unless we eliminate the tendency to catch up and overtake others for its own
 sake, in the end production will not benefit, and it will be difficult for the economy
 to develop, while scientific research also cannot be promoted.
 2.  Failing to act according to scientific laws, neglecting the role of experts, and
 actually pursuing "scientific research of the whole people."  Specialization is the
 fundamental characteristic of modern socialized large-scale production, and to pursue
 constant improvement and institute division of labor and cooperation in accordance with
 the various specialities will, as Marx pointed out, produce productive force without
 costing a cent in capital.   Scientific and technological research is presicely a major
 specialization in modern social division of labor.  . Scientific and technological activities
 have their own characteristics in comparison with other human activiites, such as
 creativity, exploration, inheritance and so on.    In engaging in scientific and techno-
 logical activities, people will obviously want to mobilize a certain amount of manpower,
 material and finance to carryout these activities in a planned and organized way
 with division of labor; but to adopt the method of mobilizing the whole people and
 creating a great uproar cannot produce good results, and will create a situation of

 "starting off like a swarm of bees, getting stuck in the middle, and ending with a gust
 of wind." Many of the methods we adopted for more than 20 years ran counter to the
 laws of scientific and technological development.  For example national crazes appeared
 for "supersonics," "radiation," "fluidics," "bittern" and "chicken's blood" and so on.
 The national science congress has played a tremendous role in promoting science and
 developing technology; however, due. to the fact that the "leftist" influence of "the
 whole people engaging in science" has not yet been eliminated, the phenonemon of "all
 levels building research centers and flowers of science blooming everywhere" has
 appeared.  According to our information, the number of scientific research organs
 in 1 province has soared by 153 percent--more than half of them are country-level re-
 search centers--while the number of research personnel has grown by 70 percent; very
 few of them are technicians, and 23 percent of the research centers have fewer than 5
 technicians.  There are over 2,000 farm machinery research centers in the whole
 co?tntry, yet there are only some 20,000 researchers there.  Some research centers are
 dubbed "three no" centers (no research subjects, no funds and no personnel), some
 are known as "three dimunitive" centers (one room, one seal, one empty shelf), while
 others are styled "three machine" centers (one mimeograph, one stapler, and one
 telephone).
 China has been short of researchers, and there are only 310,000, representing 3/10,000
 of the population.   Since there are very few personnel, and they are scattered everywhere,
 the superior features of research capability are sure to be lost, and although research
 work seems lively on the surface, in fact it cannot produce hard results.
 3.  Only bothering about scientific research, failing to stress economic effect, and
 neglecting research in production technology.  Many scientific research departments simply
 regard research reports as the final result and academic level as the sole evaluation
 criterion; this has created the notion of striving for academic standards as the highest
 aim-in research.  Stress is laid neither on cost accounting nor on economic effect.  This
 is even the case in applied research.  This is extremely prominent in the allocation of
 manpower, finance and material.  In foreign countries, experience over that long run has
 shown that the ratio of expenditure in the benefitofa basic research project, its
 translation into applied technological research, and the resulting development. of a
 product is 1:10:100.  Without going into great detail, although the ratios of manpower
 and material allocation are not necessarily the same, they are similar.  However this
 ratio is extremely lopsided in China.  Serious neglect of technological development and
 of popularization of research has caused not only shortages of manpower, finance and
 materials but has sometimes even resulted in the suspension of research.  As a result the
 development of many products stagnates for long periods in the stage of "samples, exhibits,
 and gifts," bringing about a situation in which these three things can be found everywhere
 while no actual products are produced.  According to statistics from the international
 economic cooperation organization, in the United States 80 to 85 percent of the benefits
 of research can be promptly applied in production, and the utilization rate of research
 benefits is 50 to 60 percent in Britain, France and West Germany, while in the Soviet Union
 this rate is 30 to 50 percent.. But the average rate in China is only about 10 percent.
 Even in places where standards of science and technology and management are relatively
 high, the utilization rate is only 30 to 40 percent.   For instance, the five units subor-
 dinate to the Shanghai Municipal Electronic Elements Company achieved 144 research benefits
 from 1970 to 1978, but only 45 -- 31.2 percent -- were put into production.  This was far
 behind the level--in advanced countries.
 Science and technology develop very rapidly in today's world.  The cycle from scientific
 invention to economic benefit is shortening all the time.  According to material from the
 U.S. Senate, this cycle was 30 years before World War I, 16 years between World Wars I and
 II, and 9 years on average since World War II.  At present, the effective lag time before
 the use of new material is 10 years, new techniques 7 years, and new instruments 5 years.
 Hence, in order to ensure that science and technology will effectively stimulate national
 economic development, it is necessary to stress economic effects, step up production tech-
 nology research, raise the utilization rate of science and technology in the field of pro-
 duction, and shorten the cycle.

 4.  Impatience for success, launching projects blindly, and violating scientific research
 order.  The selection of subjects for research is the key order in scientific research.
 A good start is half the battle, and directly determines the economic benefit of the
 benefits of research.  The selection of subjects itself is research work that requires
 great caution, and it is also a major aspect of research management.  In carrying out this
 work we have to conduct technological and economic analysis and exposition based on the
 broadest and most accurate information in order to "be clear about the situation and summon
 up great resolve."  However, many research departments lack sufficient understanding of the
 importance of scientific and technological information.  They not only fail to carry out
 market surveys and forecasts of social needs, but even regard the collection of scientific
 information itself to be second-class work, invest little money in it, and assign people
 to it who are mostly old, weak, ill or crippled.  Information gathered in this fashion
 can only amount to odd bits and pieces, and no systematic analysis can be expected.
 Although they may not have a clear view of the situation, people summon up resolve very
 quickly.  Quite often they make up their minds just on the basis of one official document
 or even just one sentence.  According to a sample survey of 749 new products developed in
 10 years by 35 Shanghai mechanical and electrical machinery plants producting complete
 items of equipment, 82 percent had not been subjected to technological proof and almost
 100 percent were not economically analyzed.
 It is naturally difficult to get good results from such a blind launching of new
 projects, the effort turns into "bearded research subjects," and abandonment halfway is
 a common occurrence.  How could such projects play a stimulating role in the national
 economy?
 The above-mentioned "leftist" mistakes and their influence have caused a whole series of
 grave consequences in scientific research activities.
 For instance, there is vast duplication in-research subjects, and money spent turns out
 to be useless.  According to some estimates, about 40 percent of the research subjects
 undertaken in China are duplicates of. subjects researched abroad which have already
 produced results.  Duplication within China is even more serious.  Nearly 100 units are
 developing yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser crystals; nearly 300 are developing Wankel
 engines; over 20 are developing peripheral equipment magnetic discs for computers; and no
 less than 980 are developing haploid seed breeding.
 Again, the scattering of the already limited manpower, finance and material turns them
 into pepper nnndlaa_  since they are scattered among various military organizations and
 all kinds of research centers and plants.  The results can be imagined.  Duplication of
 large amounts of experimental equipment results not only in a very low utilization rate
 but incomplete sets of equipment in some cases; the equipment thus cannot play its proper
 role.  For instance, the Shanghai scientific research and higher education systems were
 duplicating each other in 28 out of 63 projects introduced in 1978 and 1979, while 24 of
 them were duplicates of the 53 projects introduced in these systems from 1973 to 1974.
 After their introduction, the utilization efficiency of these projects was low.  The
 digestion and further development of these projects after their introduction was even
 poorer.
 However, the gravest consequence is that the science and projects in scientific research
 are incompatible with national economic development and thus get out of joint with it.
 "World science," "scientific research of the whole people" and so on obviously are
 incompatible with the current national condition and demands in China's current economic
 development, and even key science and projects are out of step with the,development of
 the national economic structure because there is no stress on economic effect, projects
 are undertaken in a blind fashion and so on.  This greatly hampers the stimulating role
 of scientific research on national economic development.  Simply saying that science and
 technology are a productive force is not sufficient to arouse the interest of those

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 engaged in actual economic work.  Only if those in scientific and tecynological circles
 truly regard science and technology as a productive force and further ensure that science
 and technology dovetail better with the national economy in research subjects and systems
 can they attract the interest of those engaged in actual economic work, who can then
 regard the economy and science and technology as depending on each other for survival.
 The postwar experiences of Japan in economic and scientific and technological development
 are worth absorbing in this respect.  Japan has consistently considered things from the
 angle of integrating the economy, industry and science in the course of accomplishing
 modernization.  From 1945 to 1950 the Japanese Government decided that the chemical
 fertilizer, coal, iron and steel, and electric power industries should be the main
 industries; from 1950 to 1960 it decided that the electric power, iron and steel, machin-
 ery and petrochemical industries should be the main industries; and from 1960 to 1972 it
 decided that the automobile, automation, environmental equipment, and computers indus-
 tries should be the main industries; and the development of science and technology and
 the selection of key sciences was closely integrated with these industries as appropriate.
 As a result, industrial production rose, while science and technology also had ample scope
 for displaying their abilities and rose along with industry.
 At present our country's economic front is clearing away erroneous "leftist" influence
 and carrying out readjustment and reform.  A modern economic structure of rational and
 steady development is gradually taking shape.  The science and technology front must
 catch up, completely clear away erroneous "leftist" influence on itself, and resolutely
 act to ensure that science and technology are readjusted onto the track of close
 integration with economic development.  That will be a new era of flourishing develop-
 ment of science and technology, and also of  soaring national economy.  Let us work hard
 for that.

 'RENMIN RIBAO' EDITORIAL STRESSES SCIENCE
 OW072325 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 1208 GMT 7 Jun 81
 [Editorial report on p 1 of RENMIN RIBAO, 7 June:  "Vie With Each Other as Warriors
 in Scaling the Heights of Science and Technology"]
 [Text]  Beijing, 7 Jun (XINUUA)--In addition to its front page report on a special-
 class invention award given by the State Scientific and Technological Commission
 and the State Agricultural Commission to a scientific research coordinating group
 for breeding xian-type hybrid rice, today's RENMIN RIBAO also publishes an editorial
 entitled "Vie With Each Other as Warriors in Scaling the Heights of Science and
 Technology."
 The editorial says:   Since the establishment of a system of awards for inventions,
 this is the first special class award ever given.  The successful cultivation of
 hybrid rice of the male sterile line, which.is of tremendous economic value, has
 not only opened a new way to a big increase in rice production but has also broken
 our predecessors' set pattern and enriched the theory and practice of heredity in
 hybrid rice seeds.  Many noted international rice experts acknowledge that our
 country leads the world in research and extension of hybrid rice.
 The editorial says:   Since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CCP Central Committee,
 we have been pursuing an open-door policy in dealing with other countries.  In
 our contacts with other countries, we have learned a lot.  In a failure of analysis,
 however, some people regard everything foreign as good, put blind faith in foreigners
 and improperly belittle themselves.  This successful cultivation of, hybrid rice is
 sound teaching material for those people.
 The editorial says:  Our country has led the world and made brilliant achievements
 in astronomy, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, architecture, medicine,
 agronomy ... and in many other fields for long historical periods.  However, our
 country has lagged behind in modern times because of imperialist aggression and
 oppression and exploitation by the reactionary ruling class at home.  In old China,
 a semicolonial and semifeudal society, the Chinese people were smeared by foreigners
 as "benighted" and were regarded as an inferior nation.  The victory of the Chinese
 people's revolution made a clean sweep of the servility of the reactionary ruling
 class, national nihilism and our national inferiority complex.  The radical change
 of our social system, the development of our economic construction and our scientific
 and technological achievements in, for example, nuclear technology, carrier rocket
 technology, synthetic bovine insulin and the successful launching and recovery of

 manmade satellites has made the world look at us with new eyes,  Through the efforts
 of our scientists and technicians in the first 17 years after the founding of
 the PRC, the gap between China's scientific level and advanced world levels narrowed.
 During the 10 catastrophic years, the Lin Biao and the Jiang Qing counterrevolu-
 tionary cliques disrupted scientific and technological undertakings and persecuted
 scientists and technicians, thus again broadening this gap.  However, with deep
 love for the motherland, with firm faith in our party and with a sense of responsi-
 bility as masters of the country, our scientists and technicians still quietly
 immersed themselves in hard work and persisted in engaging in scientific research
 in those difficult days.  Comrades like Yuan Longping continued their efforts
 without interruption, thus successfully cultivating hybrid rice.  Many countries
 have done research on hybrid rice of the male sterile line but have not yet succeeded.
 But, our country was the first to successfully breed the hybrid and popularize it.
 This once again shows that our scientists and technicians have great intelligence
 as well as high aspirations and creative power.  We have full strength and confidence
 that we can stand on our own feet in the ranks of the nations of the world.
 The editorial says:  Compared with advanced world levels, the scientific and
 technological level of our country is still rather low.  We resolutely oppose
 "looking at the sky from the bottom of a well" and "parochial arrogance."  We should
 practice "the doctrine of taking things from others" advocated by Li Xun and study
 other countries' advanced science and technology suited to the conditions of our
 country in order to make foreign things serve China.  However, we must not improperly
 belittle ourselves and so blindly worship foreign things as to lose our self-
 confidence and become dispirited.
 In the past.30 years, we have trained and tempered millions of scientists and
 technicians to a fair educational level.  This contingent of scientists and
 technicians who are loyal to the motherland and the people and who have firm faith
 in the party and socialism is a force that can be completely relied on.  After
 summing up our experiences and lessons over the past 30 years, we have clearly
 realized the role of science and technology as a productive force.  We are fostering
 an atmosphere of respecting science and scientists throughout the party and society
 and are starting to gradually improve the conditions for the livelihood, work,
 study and advanced study of scientists and technicians.  Although we shall still
 meet with various difficulties as we advance, we have the confidence and strength
 to surmount them and to scale world heights in science and technology in order to
 bring benefit to the people, to-win honor for the country and the nation and to
 make contributions to mankind.
 The editorial points out:  The extension of hybrid rice on large tracts of farmland
 has effectively promoted our country's agricultural development.  This once again
 proves the correctness of the party's policy that it is necessary to rely on .
 policy and science in developing agriculture.  When the question of the system of
 responsi'.-ility in agricultural production is basically solved, it will be more
 necessary to rely on science to develop agricultural production.  Party committees
 and governments at all levels must attach importance to agricultural science, improve
 and strengthen their leadership over agricultural scientific research units and
 agricultural colleges and schools and correct the ideas and practices that 16 more
 agricultural science and education.  It is necessary to concientiously implement
 the policy toward intellectuals, to further arouse the socialist enthusiasm of

 large numbers of agricultural scientific researchers, agricultural technicians,
 experienced old peasants and educated young people in the countryside and to give.
 full play to their role as the mainstay in agricultural economic construction.
 ~In fact, we must rely on policy and science not only to develop agriculture but
 to ddvelop industry as well.  We must rely on science and technology to build a
 .modern, powerful socialist country.  All party comrades and cadres must attach
 great importance to the role of science and pay close attention to bringing
 scientists' power into full play.

 'JINGJI GUANLI' ON LESSONS FROM IMPORTING EQUIPMENT
 HK301356 Beijing JINGJI GUANLI [ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT] in Chinese No 6, 15 Jun 81
 pp 12-14
 [Economic commentary by Lin Senmu [2651 2773 2606]:  "Lessons Drawn From the
 Importation of 22 Complete Sets of Equipment"; passages within slantlines pub-
 lished in boldface]
 [Text]  After the smashing of the "gang of four," the party Central Committee made
 a decision to expedite the pace of our socialist modernization program with the
 utilization of foreign funds and technology.  Practice has fully proven this to be
 entirely correct.  But it must be acknowledged that there cropped up some short-
 comings and mistakes in the process of implementing this correct policy decision.
 The importation of the 22 projects of complete sets of equipment signed in 1978
 was a prominent instance.  This batch of projects was the product of "leftist"
 mistakes, and was a product of not seeking truth from facts, and of subjectivism.
 In the 10'chaotic years, our national economy was brought to the brink of collapse,
 the disproportionate relations of the national economy were very serious, the
 scope of capital construction was overstretched and the orientation of investment
 was irrational.  Normally speaking, after the smashing of the "gang of four," we
 should have carried out readjustment and rectification and let the people rest
 and build strength, instead, we called for "getting going and going all out" and
 building 120 large-scale backbone projects, and the total amount of investment
 within 8 years (from 1979 to 1985) was planned to exceed the total sum of the past
 28 years.  Under the guidance of this "theory of achieving quick results," an
 upsurge of importing complete sets of equipment was started.  In 1979 in a very
 short period of time, large numbers of contracts to import foreign equipment based
 mainly on the 22 projects were signed.  This included the contracts comprising
 about half of the total amount of transactions which were signed within 10 days
 beginning from 20 December 1978 to the end of that year.  Many of them were pro-
 jects outside the state plan.  The Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel General Plant,
 the biggest project ever seen to date, was also a project outside the state plan.
 On the issue of importing these projects, no procedure of construction was fol-
 lowed, neither were any earnest investigation and study nor technical and economic
 deliberation and comparison of various plans made, and also no overall balance was
 made through the planning departments.  Everything in this respect was decided by
 the leading cadres by marking dots and small circles.  Even without the simplest

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 certificates for planned tasks but only based on a scrap of note paper with some
 dots and ring marks, they could sign more than US$2 billion worth of contracts
 with foreign businessmen and decide on construction projects with a total invest-
 ment of 10 billion [presumably yuan].  Therefore, the importation of these 22
 projects was made largely at random and in a blind way.  The large quantity Of
 foreign exchange.used and investment poured into these projects could only help
 make the imbalances of the national economy worse.
 /1)  Making the scope of capital construction become viciously inflated./  The
 long-drawn-out situation in which the scope of our national economy was over-
 stretched, the management was in disorder and the investment effects were poor
 has remained unsolved for a long time.  Although these 22 imported projects were
 small in number, the investment channelled into them was substantial.  This made
 the already overstretched scope of capital construction continue to expand.  It
 will take 7 or 8 years to fulfill the volume of investment needed by the planned
 large and medium-scale projects which have not been completed, calculated on the
 basis of their original level of investment of that year, even without any new
 projects being set up.  The 22 imported projects (excluding the accumulative
 total of fulfilled volume) occupied 34 percent of the total investment needed.
 According to their original plans, the investment in these imported projects will
 reach a climax in 1980 and 1981, each year needing 10 or 20 billion'yuan of
 investment, surpassing the limit of the national financial strength and material
 resources.  In fact, to make this batch of projects form comprehensive productive
 forces requires the building of additional necessary complete sets of projects
 such as railway and power stations, and transforming electrical transmission
 lines, coal cleaning plants and projects for the production of industrial chemi-
 cals, and the corresponding urban construction.  It was estimated that the actual
 scope of the 22 imported projects plus their necessary complete sets of projects
 would be 100 percent greater than the planned scope.  This will greatly surpass
 the actual abilities of our national strength.
 /2)  The orientation of investment is irrational./  In China's distribution of
 investment in capital construction there has existed a tendency in which heavy
 industry is given one-sided stress while light industry does not receive the.
 deserved attention, resulting in a very irrational economic structure.  Because
 of the one-sided priority given to the development of heavy industry and the
 overly low proportion of investment in agriculture and light industry, agricul-
 ture and light industry could not develop in a proper way.  In the inner sectors
 of heavy industry, owing to the practice of "taking steel as the key link," the
 basic structure such as the energy industry and transport and communications have
 become the weak links.  With the backward state of energy and transport and. com-
 munications, only 20 to 30 percent of the industrial productive forces could be
 utilized, and many enterprises stopped production for 3 days and operated for 4
 days, and vice versa.   Therefore, it is necessary to readjust this irrational
 orientation of investment and rationalize the economic structure.  However,
 among the 22 imported projects signed in 1978, the main projects were metallurgi-
 cal and chemical industrial projects comprising 74 percent of the total volume of
 investment in this batch of projects, energy projects constituting only 11 percent
 and light industrial and textile industrial projects occupying only 12 percent.
 As a result, the orientation of investment has become more and more irrational.

 The total volume of investment needed by the unfinished projects of the planned
 large and medium-scale projects which were under construction centered on heavy
 industry, particularly the metallurgical industry comprising 22 percent of the
 total volume of investment needed by the unfinished projects and the chemical
 industrial projects constituting 10.6 percent.
 /3)  Without the conditions for production being practicable, even though the
 items are completed, they still cannot go into operation./  Most of the 22
 imported projects consume large quantities of energy.  After going into opera-
 tion, they will annually consume 10 million tons of crude oil and 20 million tons
 of coal.  In the present situation in which our energy supply is strained, the
 state cannot afford to supply.  Take a copper-producing basic construction
 project for instance.  If its conditions for coal, electricity and transport and
 communications are unpracticable, it will annually consume 1 or 2 million tons
 of coal according to the originally planned scope.  This will affect the newly
 built power plants and the balance between production and demand of coal, and coal
 should be imported from other areas, which in turn will add weight to the over-
 loaded railway transport, thus demanding additional railways to be built or
 rebuilt.  Some chemical industrial projects still do not know where to get crude
 oil from.  In addition, several other projects will encounter the problem of
 energy supply of raw materials after completion.
 In sum, the problems of the construction of the 22 imported projects were rela-
 tively many.  Therefore some of them got stranded before going into operation;
 many projects which have been put into construction had to be cancelled or post-
 poned and still others whose construction plans should be altered and scale
 should be reduced.  In this way, warehouses had to be constructed to store
 the several billion U.S. dollars' worth of equipment, consuming a large amount
 of manpower, materials and finances to preserve and take care of them, resulting
 in several billion [currency unspecified] units of foreign exchange or scores of
 billion renminbi lying,idle over a long period of time.  This was unprecedented
 in terms of politics and economics.
 At present, the primary task for clearing away and ridding ourselves of the
 "left" deviationist ideological shackles in economic work and further imple-
 menting the principle of readjustment of the national economy is the further
 curtailment of capital construction to a proper degree.  In the meantime, it is,
 imperative to earnestly sum up and draw lessons from these 22 imported projects.
 /1.  Borrowing from abroad to buy mechanical equipment depends on the amount of
 national funds necessary to manufacture complete sets of equipment./  Under the
 prerequisite of putting self-reliance first, it is entirely necessary to borrow
 from abroad to import some advanced techniques.  This is conducive to counter-
 acting our weaknesses in construction funds to speedily enlarge the productive
 forces and utilizing advanced technology to transform the national economy.  But
 most of the foreign debts we borrowed 2 years ago were used to buy mechanical
 equipment.  Using foreign debts to buy mechanical equipment does not depend on
 our subjective will but depends on how much investment the state can afford for
 the necessary complete sets of equipment.  The ability to manufacture the neces-
 sary complete sets of equipment should be considered in two ways:  one is the

 national investment, materials for equipment and ability to construct needed by
 the projects to manufacture the necessary complete sets of equipment, and the
 other is the ability to  form complete sets of raw materials, fuel, power and
 transport and communications after the projects have been constructed.
 Some people once argued that it was permissible to separate the carrying out of
 capital construction using equipment bought with foreign debts from the domestic
 planned arrangements, thus allowing it to go its own way, that is to say, it
 could be disconnected with the domestic state plans or finance.  This "theory of
 disconnection" does not hold water.  Take the first phase of the project of the
 Shanghai Petrochemical Industrial General Plant, which has been completed and
 put into operation for example.  This project has 18 sets of equipment in all,
 of which 9 sets were introduced from abroad. and 9 others are Chinese-,made.  The
 public facilities, municipal administrative facilities and nonproductive con-
 struction were all supplied domestically.  Viewed from the angle of the ratio
 of investment, the imported installations comprised 37 percent while the Chinese-
 made ones constituted 63 percent.               If the portion of the 9 Chinese-made installa-
 tions had been imported from abroad, we should have spent more foreign:exchange.
 Meanwhile, the domestic productive capacity of these projects cannot be utilized.
 This is economically irrational.   If we build by means of borrowing from abroad
 the public facilities (heat and power stations, water works, railways, roads and
 docks) and import all power-generating equipment, rail sleepers and locomotives,
 this seems to be disconnected, but where should we get the needed rolled steel,
 timber and cement from?  Apart from the bricks, tiles, lime, sand and stones
 which should be taken from the domestic market, it is almost impossible to rely
 on foreign countries to supply cement, electricity, coal and transport and com-
 munications facilities needed by the construction.  The nonproductive construction
 (housing,. canteens, shops and hospitals) and the construction of water supply,
 sewage, gas, telephone and transport facilities which serve factories also cannot
 be solved by borrowing from abroad.  In addition, taking production into consid-
 eration, even if we borrow from abroad by processing supplied materials, assem-
 bling supplied parts and importing assembly lines, and pay them with products
 exported, we still require domestic replenishment of complementary materials,
 packaging materials, necessary complete sets of equipment and the relevant funds.
 How can the large-scale imported projects be disconnected with the domestic
 appropriate ones?  Needless to say, no matter what means and measures we take in
 borrowing from abroad to undertake construction, it is necessary for agriculture
 and light industry to provide us with the means of livelihood.  Borrowing from
 abroad to undertake production should be based on the substantially increased
 production of agriculture and light industry.  The disconnection of arrangements
 between construction using borrowed foreign funds and production by domestic
 strength, in fact, is to be divorced from the overall balance of the whole
 national economy, starting to build all over again.  This will inevitably lead
 to loss of control over the scope of capital construction and damage the propor-
 tionate relations of the national economy.
 Therefore, in borrowing from abroad to import some projects, it is necessary to
 make an overall plan and link up the interior and the exterior to attain overall
 balance.  As regards all projects using foreign investment, it is essential first
 of all to consider the degree of capability and possibility to cooperate and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 manufacture the necessary complete sets of equipment domestically.  It is not
 permissible to decide in isolation on the scale, schedule and effects of the
 imported projects regardless of the conditions for the construction of projects
 to manufacture necessary complete sets of equipment and the possibility for
 cooperation of building times and conditions for construction.  The imported
 projects and the projects for the necessary complete sets of equipment should
 be arranged well concurrently, otherwise even when.they are completed, they will
 not produce any practical results and on the contrary, they will become a heavy
 burden.
 /2.  It is necessary to proceed from the national condition and increase the
 capability for self-reliance./  The aim of importing technology by using foreign
 investment is to increase our capability for self-reliance.  We should rely on our
 own strength in building the four modernizations and not buy modernization.  In
 using foreign debts, we should not import any projects whatsoever production.
 Particular stress should be laid on introducing advanced technology and trying
 in every possible way to increase the domestic level of designed capacity and
 manufacturing capability.  Everyone should take the overall interests into con-
 sideration and energetically foster the domestic manufacturing industry.  It is
 not permissible to weaken and attack the domestic engineering (manufacturing)
 industry.. Hence the domestic departments concerned should be allowed to undertake
 every design that can be undertaken or mastered through learning at home.  Equip-
 ment that can be manufactured and supplied at home should be supplied as much as
 possible by the departments concerned at home.  As for some equipment that cannot
 be supplied at home for the time being, it is permissible to introduce from
 abroad the blueprints (drawings) and technical data, and engage foreign special-
 ists as instructors.  We should try our best to manufacture them by ourselves.
 In case we are obliged to buy equipment from abroad, we should buy the key
 equipment.
 Furthermore, in importing advanced technology, we should take our own actual
 conditions and the current national ability and resources into consideration.
 Our country has limited funds, insufficient technological force and a large
 population.  Therefore in carrying out modernization, we have to consider what
 is to be modernized first and what later, proceed on the priority principle,
 make rational arrangements, differentiate what is primary from what is secondary
 and distinguish between what should come first and what should come later.  When-
 ever modernization is mentioned, people think that everything can be accomplished
 by "pressing a button."  It is unnecessary and impossible to do things like that.
 In our country, advanced and relatively backward techniques will exist concur-
 rently.  Therefore, it is necessary to spontaneously develop automation, semi-
 automation, mechanization, semimechanization and manual labor of various types.
 /3. 'Decisions on every project should be based on scientific confirmation and
 technological and economic deliberation./  In deciding on every imported project,
 we should act according to the procedure of capital construction and the scien-
 tific laws and correct the unhealthy tendencies of writing instructions. or notes
 arbitrarily and starting projects in an unplanned way.  Without the examination
 of comprehensive departments concerned and approval through collective discussion,
 no one, from secretaries of the people's communes to members of the Standing
 Committee of the CCP has the right to ratify any projects.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100190001-7
 An earnest technical and economic deliberation (feasibility study) should. be made
 before importing a project, including the main problems of the research projects
 such as resources, (?geology), raw materials, fuel, power, communications,
 technological processes, equipment selection, product specifications, varieties,
 quantity and market.  We should conduct technological and economic investigation
 and study of the project, make a comparison of the various plans and calculate
 the technical and economic results after it is completed.  Only after this
 project has been proved to be technically advanced and reliable, economically
 beneficial and profitable, and in addition, we are capable of undertaking it,
 can we begin to carry out trade negotiations and sign contracts for imports.
 Without making any scientific confirmation and without any analysis of techno-
 logical feasibility or economic feasibility with regard to the imported projects,
 we decided on them after making assumptions by marking only a few dots and small
 circles on a piece of paper.  We "did not have a real understanding of how things
 stand but had great determination and lots of measures."  This practice of blindly
 deciding on projects to-be imported will inevitably cause great waste and inflict
 many hidden dangers and insurmountable incurable diseases on production.
 A.  Learn to do business./    Over the past.20 years, blocked by imperialism in
 the first stage and disrupted and sabotaged by Lin Biao and the "gang of four"
 later, it was impossible for us to develop economic.activities with other coun-
 tries on an intensive scale.               As a result, we have a poor understanding of
 international economic activities and little knowledge in many respects.  Owing.
 to lack of experience, the importation of the 22 projects was a bit too hasty,
 hence we suffered some losses.  We must learn to do business and master the knack
 of doing business.
 In negotiating loans to import technology, we have come into contact with many
 foreign capitalists.  We should soberly realize that foreign capitalists are after
 all capitalists, and are "the personification of capital" (quotation from Marx).
 Their motives and aim for doing business are to achieve the biggest profits.
 The.profits they aim to obtain definitely cannot be less than the average inter-
 national profit rate.  If the profits they gain are less than the average profit
 rate, they will not take risks to make investments and they are entirely justi-
 fied in keeping their money in banks to receive interest safely and surely.
 In talking about the role of gold under the socialist system, Lenin pointed out:
 "After winning international victory, I think, we will build some lavatories,
 with gold in the streets of the several biggest cities in the world."  But at
 present, we "must still treasure gold.  If you sell your gold, sell'it at a
 higher price, and if you buy any commodities with gold, buy them at a lower
 price.  If you live with wolves, you should learn to bark like wolves."
 Promptly summing up experience, upholding what is correct and correcting what is
 wrong are our fine traditions and also the main reasons for the progress we have
 made in our work.  We should uphold our fine traditions and do a proper job in
 using foreign investments to import technology.

 FANG YI STRESSES SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR YOUTH
 OW201924 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 1802 GMT 19 Jun 81
 [Text) Beijing, 19 Jun (XINHUA)--Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Chinese association
 of scientific-technological instructors for youngsters, which closed on 19 June, Fang.Yi,
 Song Renqiong and other comrades urged all in society to show concern for and give support
 to young people's activities in the field of science and technology.
 Fang Yi said:  An  iiortant thing in developing science and technology is to train competent
 workers in this field.  We should not only strengthen our present ranks of scientists and
 technicians, but also try to discover talented persons and cultivate them as early as
 possible into a mighty scientific and technological reserve force while continuing to raise
 the scientific and cultural level of the young generation.  Promoting extensive activities
 in the scientific and technological field among young people is an important task toward
 this end.  These activities, he said, can supplement classroom teaching and play a vital
 role in cultivating the young people's aspiration for and interest in science and in raising
 their ability to observe, think and work in a practical way.  These activities are also of
 vital significance to promoting socialist spiritual civilization as they can bring about
 good habits among the young people of behaving decorously, paying attention to morality,
 loving science and studying diligently.   In his speech Fang Yi praised the scientific-
 technological instructors for youngsters as "sowers of the seeds of science and good gardeners
 for cultivating the seedlings of science and technology."
 In his speech Song Renqiong stressed that education in science and technology must start
 with children, teenagers and youth so that the youngsters will have a foundation in science.
 He expressed the hope that the broad masses of scientific-technological instructors for
 youngsters across the country, in particular those working in the countryside, will work
 harder than ever to help with the young people's activities in the field of science and
 technology.  Among those attending the closing ceremony were responsible persons of the
 Chinese Scientific and Technological Association, the Ministry of Education, the State
 Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the CYL Committee, the All-China Women's Federation,
 Beijing Municipality and other departments concerned.
 The inaugural meeting of the Chinese association of scientific-technological instructors
 for youngsters opened on 12 June.  The purpose of this association is to unite and organize
 .on a still wider scale all scientific-technological instructors for youngsters and enthusiasts
 supporting young people's activities in the field of science and technology.  The meeting
 exchanged information on achievements and experiences in carrying out activities related to
 science and technology among young people.   It adopted a "proposal for further developing
 the science-loving campaign among young people."  Wu Zhonghua, an engineer and thermophysicst
 and executive chairman of the presidium of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was elected
 chairman of the. association's board of directors.  Jiang Nanxing, minister of education,
 was given the title of honorary chairman of the association's board of directors.
 At the 19 June closing ceremony, speeches were also made by Jiang Nanxiang and chairman of
 the Chinese Scientific and Technological Association Zhou Peiyuan.  Before the closing
 ceremony, Fang Yi and other comrades met with all the outstanding scientific-technological
 instructors for youngsters attending the meeting.

 RENMIN RIBAO COMMENTARY ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY
 HK190454 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 5 Jul 81 p 3
 (Commentary by Jia Weiwen [6238 5588 2429]:  "Combine the Plans for the Development of
 Science and Technology With the Plans for the Development of the Economy and of Society"]
 (Text]  The combination of the plans for the development of science and technology with
 the plans for the development of the economy and of society will enable the economic
 development of our country to take the road of less investment and accumulation and
 achieve better results.  This is a historical trend in the development of modern society.
 There are at present several ways of combining the overall planning and all-round arrange-
 ments of the above three:  The planning departments should set requirements on science and
 technology, the main task of which is to solve key problems in the development of the
 economy; major capital construction projects, the orientation and policies of economic
 development, which will be included in the plan, should all be checked and approved by
 specialists; major items in economic development should be arranged in a connected
 sequence; the unification of the three should manifest itself in various economic develop-
 ment plans; and strengthen the connection between scientific research and production.  In
 the meantime, we should work out a relatively independent plan for developing science and
 technology.  Planning personnel, science and technology personnel and social science per-
 sonnel should be organized together.
 At present, the outline of the sixth 5-year plan and the outline of a 10-year plan are
 being drafted in various departments and localities.  In the summer of last year, the
 leading comrades of the party Central Committee pointed out that our country's plan
 should include not only plans for developing the economy, but also plans for developing
 science and technology and for developing society.  Recently, a leading' comrade of the
 State Council clearly stated that in working out the plan we are going to carry out, we
 must strive to express the principle of combining the development of science and techno-
 logy with the development of the economy and of society, and overcome the shortcoming of
 separating the three.  But in our actual work, the combination of the three has not. been
 carried out in orderly ways.  A conscientious study and settlement of this problem are an
 important condition for doing a good job in working out the plan.  This is an urgent sub-
 ject which will promote the development of our country's economy and society and the
 progress of science and technology.
 For a long rime,'the plans for the development of science and technology in our country
 hive been divorced from the plans for the development of the economy and of society.
 They have  not been able to merge together organically.  Economic development has seldom
 relied on science and technology.  Science and technology have not played a sufficient
 role in solving major problems in the economic and social development.  This is very
 detrimental to economic development.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 The problem is, in the actual conditton of our country, should economic and social develop-
 ment rely on science and technology?  To what extent should it rely?  How important will
 be the roll. played by science and technology in promoting the development of the economy
 and society?  In the future development of our country's economy, we should probe into and
 take the road of less investment and accumulation and of getting better results.  To take
 this road, we are required to change the stress in the economic development indices from
 just concentrating on output  value, quantity and speed to raising the quality of products,
 increasing their variety, reducing the consumption of energy and raw materials and lowering
 the cost of production.  This requirement should be reflected not only in the contents of
 the plan indices but also in checking methods of production and construction units.
 In order to accomplish targets of economic development and achieve better economic results,
 and especially to achieve better economic results when investment in capital construction
 is reduced, the main thing is to carry out readjustment, reform and technical innovations.
 The economic development of our country in the future cannot mainly rely on the increase of
 equipment or personnel from the original level.  We must not expand production by extending
 production.  We must expand production and raise the level of production mainly in the
 contents of production.  ThiF, all the more requires us to combine economic with technical
 means, that is, to combine readjustment (the structure of economy and products), reorgani-
 zation (specialization and cooperation), reform (management system) and restructuring
 (technology), so as to energetically raise the economic and technical indices and achieve
 better economic results.  Taking this road is more difficult and arduous than taking the
 old road.  But this is a broad road, which will become broader and broader.
 The combination and unification of the plans for developing science and technology with the
 plans for developing the economy and society have become a historical trend in which modern
 society develops.   In particular, during the more than 30 years since World War II, there
 have been many new major breakthroughs in science and technology, which play a more and more
 important role in the development of the economy and society.  According to statistics, at
 the beginning of this century, technical progress accounted as a 5-20 percent factor in
 the economic growth and labor productivity increase in economically-developed. countries.
 In the 1970's, technical progress accounted as a 50-70.percent factor in the economic
 growth of the developed countries.  Because of this, many counries have now determined, from
 the point of the planning and work system, on the combination of the plans for developing
 science and technology with the plans for developing the economy and society.
 Some people think that for a technically backward country like ours, the role of science
 and technology is rather, small.  Therefore it cannot be regarded as an important backing
 for realizing economic growth.  These people only ,see the backward side of our country's
 technology, but fail to see that our country's economy has after all developed to a certain
 scale, though our country's economy and science and technology have suffered many setbacks;
 that our country has a science and technology contingent, of a certain scale and level that
 has achieved, in different degrees, certain results in many fields of scientific research
 and that has accumulated certain reserves; and that we have also imported advanced tech-
 niques from abroad.   By joining all this together, we know that our country's science and
 technology can play a magnificent role in promoting economic development.  We have obtained
 successful experience in this respect.  The problem now is to really bring intq play the
 role of science and technology and make it a great force in raising economic results and
 promoting economic development.
 Several Key Methods of Carrying Out the Combination
 In what ways can we combine the plans for developing science and technology with the plans
 for developing the economy and society, and unify them?  Judging from the present conditions,
 we can at least adopt the following methods:
 First, put the plans for developing science and technology and the plans for developing
 the economy and society under.overall consideration and all-round arrangement.  The plans
 for developing science and technology and the plans for developing the economy and society
 should be component parts of the plan for developing the whole national economy.  Economic
 development sould provide the development of science and technology and the development
 of the society with the necessary conditions.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 Second, the planning departments should set requirements, on the departments of. science
 and technology according to the needs of economic development.  The development of
 science and technology including scienctific research, the import of techniques and the
 digestion and absorption of imported techniques, should meet the maximum need of economic
 development and take the solution of key technical problems in economic development as
 its major task.  In scientific research, we should, through various experiments, obtain
 complete, reliable technical and economic data that can be realized repeatedly.  This
 data should be provided to the production and construction departments.
 Third, major capital construction projects, technical innovations, imported techniques
 and the major problems of orientation and policies in economic development should all be
 checked and approved by specialists in economics and in science and technology.  Without
 checking and approval by specialists, the planning departments cannot list the above-
 mentioned items in the plan.  The departments of science and technology should organize
 this work and make it a system to be established.  When working out a plan, we should go
 by the major technical policies that are jointly made step by step and in a planned way
 for the main undertakings by the departments of science and technology and those of
 economics.
 Fourth, from scientific research, the import of techniques and technological design to
 construction and the operation of production, we should have set arrangements in connected
 sequence for the major subjects and tasks in economic development, so as to change the
 results of scientific research into productive forces as soon as possible.
 Fifth, and most important, the combination of the development plan for the three aspects
 should be reflected in the process of the working out of the various development plans
 for the economy (society).  This is the basic link and the main tie for joining up and
 connecting the development plans for science and technology with the development plans
 for the economy (society).  The economic development plan includes not only a production
 plan and a capital construction plan, but also a technical innovation plan, with the
 enterprises as its foundation and the development plan for products and undertakings as
 its main content.  We should regard technical innovations as the main path for developing
 products and undertakings.  So long as problems can be solved by restructuring the present
 enterprises, we must resolutely avoid carrying out new construction in this respect.
 The technical restructuring plan of enterprises and undertakings includes the renewal of
 products and the adoption of new techniques and technology.   It is in fact the populariza-
 tion and application of the results of scientific research or of imported techniques in
 production and construction.  The economic development plan of various trades and
 undertakings should include plans for developing new products and for adopting new
 techniques and technology.  We should also create conditions for setting the indices
 for net output value resulting from technical progress.  There are two aspects in fully
 relying on the role of technical progress in the economic development plan:  on the one
 hand, absorb and digest the nourishment of science and technology and adopt appropriate
 advanced techniques as far as possible in production and construction and in technical
 innovations; on the other hand, starting from the needs of the development of the economy
 and society, requirements of vari.ous`aspects should be set on science and technology.
 Many items and subjects in the plan for developing science and technology should be
 put forward in this way.
 Giving priority to technical innovations in the existing enterprises does not mean that
 we do not want capital construction.   In the light of the actual condition of our country,
 capital construction should. have a certain proportion in the investment in expanded
 reproduction.   In view of our 30 years' experiences and lessons, we must energetically
 strengthen the work in the early stages of capital construction.  Technical preparation
 is an important component part of such work.  Technical preparation should also include
 the necessary scientific research.  Therefore, in the work in the early stage of capital
 construction, we should make appropriate arrangements for scientific research.

 Sixth, In urder to strengthen the connection between research end production, we should
 build more sample production devices for economic results that need major techniques
 and for popularizing the possible results of scientific research.  Take production lines
 and workshops as an example.  They should carry out small-scale production.  It is
 necessary for the production and construction units to cooperate with the scientific
 research units to realize this plan.  Production enterprises will be responsible for the
 investment needed and the state will be responsible for the investment and loans for major
 and important projects.
 Only when various trades and undertakings take science and technology as an important means
 for developing the economy so as to make the development of science and technology an
 organic component part of the economic development plan and intertwine the economic and
 technical means of achieving economic growth together, can the method of working out
 plans in a mechanical way be changed and the problem of the development of science and
 technology and the development of the economy really be solved.
 When working out the social development plan, we should also combine economic measures
 with the technical measures.  Take the problem of the control of air pollution in the
 urban areas as an example.   If no major and important measures are taken in respect of
 the popularization of the use of gar. in the urban areas, it is difficult for us to achieve
 outstanding results in air pollution control.  And the popularization of the use of gas
 in the urban areas cannot but rely on science and technology.
 In stressing the, combination of the plans for developing science and technology with the
 plans for developing the economy and society and by stressing that the contents of science
 and technology should be taken as an organic component part of the various economic develop-
 ment plans, we do not in the least mean that there is no more need to work out plans for
 developing science and technology.  According to the present actual condition of our
 country, we should concentrate our efforts on solving key technical problems that have
 emerged in the present and recent production and construction, and giving priority to
 the arrangement of projects that can bring about major and important economic results.
 We should also have development in mind.  We should devote certain efforts to the study
 of basic theory and to the study of very advanced techniques.  We should also arrange
 some long-term projects so as to make preparations for the future development of the
 economy and technology.
 The plans for developing science and technology should include major and important
 projects of scientific research (including basic, applied and exploitation research),
 major and important projects for the import, digestion and absorption of techniques,
 projects for capital construction in science and technology (such as experimental
 bases, test centers, research centers and information centers), development plans for
 scientific and technological undertakings, including funds for scientific and technological
 research and material, and training plans for the increase of qualified personnel.   It
 should also include several key undertakings and areas to be opened up and comprehensive
 projects of science and technology.  According to the actual condition of our country's
 science and technology and in light of needs and possibilities, we should do things in
 order of importance and urgency, decide what is to be learned at home and what imported
 from abroad, and carry out comprehensive balance and all-round arrangement.  The projects
 that are to be listed in the plan must have implementation details and guarantees so
 that the plan can have certain strategic aims and be relatively practicable.
 We should also adopt organizational measures to carry out the. combination of the plans
 for developing science and technology with the plans for developing the economy and
 society, and do our best to organize together the planning, science and technology
 and social science personnel.  So long as we can organize well the forces from various
 aspects and conscientiously carry out investigation and study, it is possible for us to
 work out a fairly good plan.

 No 4, 10 Aug 81 pp 4-6
 [Article by Lo Peilin [5012 3099.7207] of the Science & Technology Committee of
 the Fourth Ministry of Machine Building: ."The Role of Technological Sciences in
 the National Economy and Defense Construction in China"]
 [Text.]   I..Delineation of the Major Stages of Contemporary Science
 and Technology
 Activity in contemporary science and technology can basically be con-
 sidered to have four key stages: basic science (i.e., basic research),
 technological science (i.e., applied research), technological develop-
 ment (including what we customarily call prototype manufacture), and
 concrete engineering technology.  The first three stages are clearly
 characterized by'the core goals of discovery, invention, and creativity,
 and in general by what is called "research and development" (often
 denoted abroad by the English abbreviation R&D).  Here, "scientific
 research" includes the two stages of basic and applied research.
 Concrete engineering technology is wide-ranging.  This is using the
 experience of each domain to raise the level of technical guidance,
 or what could be called science and technology for everyday use.  Ex-
 amples include the technology of production engineering in industry;
 planting, plowing, and harvesting technology in agriculture; clinical
 diagnosis and treatment technology in medicine, etc.  Technological
 development, thus, is a stage inextricably linked to technology for
 everyday use.   It is already a common and important source of contem-
 porary technology for everyday use.   It includes aspects from the ini-
 tial design stage to the development and trial-production of articles.
 It also includes the overall development and realization of production
 and operations technology.  The clear goal of technological development
 is to plan on the basis of applied experience.

 Basic scientific research is another of the four stages.   Its mission
 is the discovery and description of the natural world's basic phenomena
 and principles.  The new achievements of contemporary basic science have
 led to many important new technological breakthroughs.  For example, the
 discovery of the Maxwell equations and Hertz' experiments led to the
 development of radio communications; the discovery of nuclear fission
 led to the development of nuclear energy and nuclear weapons.  The theory
 of energy transmission in quantum mechanics made crucial contributions
 to the continuous rise of semiconductor technology.  However, in practice
 if one simply proceeds from these basic achievements, it is often still
 impossible to go directly to technical development or the development
 of technology for everyday use.  At this point, it is necessary to conduct
 a great deal of scientific experimentation and theoretical investigation.
 On the other hand, the accumulation of a great degree of empirical data
 and materials during everyday practice and the development of technology
 requires experimental verification and theoretical summarization in order
 to create rational knowledge possessing even more guiding meaning, even
 to the point of being able from this to enrich the content of basic science.
 All this is the mission of technological science; it is the bond joining
 basic science and the development of technology.  The emergence of a strong
 technological science is a great event in the contemporary development of
 science and technology as well as currently being the direct source of much
 new technology.  On the basis of the contemporary experience of advanced
 countries, the existence of the four stages has already produced a rela-
 tively complete scientific and technological system in which each of the
 four stages is essential.  They depend on, permeate, and complement each
 other.
 II.  Historical Experience on the Development of Science and Technology
 Having an overall understanding of the history of the following developed
 countries' science and technology development and comparing their differ-
 ences and merits could provide important lessons for our'country's develop-
 ment of science and technology.
 Early science has a practical nature.  Since the Industrial Revolution
 many important inventions have come from combining early scientific
 knowledge with experience gained through production.  Later, in Western
 Europe, under the influence of that region 's scholastic tradition, ad-
 vanced basic science was developed.  These basic scientific achievements
 established important conditions for modern science and technology, but
 at the time it emerged, it was not at all intimately related to the devel-
 opment of that region's production.  The development of a technological
 science between basic science and technological development came somewhat
 later.

 American science and technology originally lagged behind that of Western
 Europe and was the historical model of a less advanced country achieving
 virtually complete success in gaining first place.  At an early stage it
 made use of. West European technological development for its own production.
 The rapid development of industry enabled applied technology to advance
 rapidly, leading to a great number of inventions and the flourishing of
 technology.  This began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which
 was also the time of Bell, Edison, and the Wright brothers; from this
 developed the ranks of American technological scientists.  At the time
 of WWII, the development of nuclear energy, radar, and jet technology
 propelled it to new peaks.  With the immense planning for space, the rapid
 expansion of the information industry, the large-scale advancement of nuclear
 testing, and the urgent demands on energy and the environment currently
 being stressed have sufficed to continue its development.  The existence
 of powerful technological science ranks has become the characteristic of
 American science and technology.   It was only after WWII that the US
 energetically developed basic science.  However, since it has such favor-
 able conditions as a highly developed economy and a profound degree of
 applied scientific achievement and engineering technology, it rapidly
 entered the advanced ranks.  During this-period Western Europe also began
 to fill in the thin spots in its own technological science.  It is also
 worth mentioning that the US relied heavily on European talent for the
 development of its basic science and technological science.
 Japan is a model among contemporary states of a backward state which
 has reached the front ranks and attained remarkable development.  After
 hWII, Japan began extensive economic, scientific, and technological
 development.  For this reason it could make full use of the achievements
 of Western European and American science and technology.  First, it trans-
 ferred foreign, especially American, applied engineering and technology,
 vital to the rapid development of the economy and production.  Later,
 along with copying, it paid full attention to developing its own tech-
 nology.                   Because of this they were able thoroughly to master and digest
 imported technology as well as being able to improve it so that many
 facets of it attained the front ranks.  As far as basic science and tech-
 nological science are concerned, Japan repeatedly achieved world class
 results, but did not gain a flourishing level overall.   In recent years
 they have demanded an increase in the rate of technological development
 and, having already realized their technological reserves are weak, they
 have begun to pay attention to strengthening these two stages.
 The historical development of the Soviet Union occurred under different
 circumstances.  Because of court promotion in Tsarist times, a founda-
 tion for basic scientific research was established early.  Building on
 this heritage, the Soviet Union established the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
 developed powerful basic scientific ranks, and became one branch of the
 world's advanced scientific ranks.  Dedicating themselves to sophisticated
 military technological development, they also achieved notable results.
 They concentrated talented scientific and technical specialists and major
 material and financial resources on this arena, thereby weakening various
 aspects of applied engineering technology and technological development.

 This cannot but be an important reason why their national economy incor-
 porates such key sectors as electronics which are characterized by long-
 standing inferiority to other developed countries.  Since high technology
 and applied technology are insufficiently developed and do not make urgent
 demands on technological science, technical science of course cannot
 flourish either.
 III.  Problems Worth Noting in Science and Technology Development
 1.  Longterm scientific research should be properly managed.  The US
 in its early period and Japan are examples of stress on achieving imme-
 diate results; the Soviet Union is an example of concentrating energy
 on the achievement of longterm results.  We cannot follow the old Soviet
 road of longterm development in isolation, nor can we put longterm develop-
 ment into th?e background like the US and Japan.  We should take the overall
 experience of each into consideration.  In passing from a period of isola-
 tion to getting results by "feeling one's way," longterm research has been
 neglected.   In recent years, attention has been paid to basic science, but
 the stress on applied research remains insufficient.  Although applied
 research, i.e., technological science, does not lead directly to products
 or techniques, it provides creative conditions and paves the way for
 technological development.  Numerous key problems currently blocking
 production and technological development often can be solved only through
 emphasis on technological science research.  The US established strong
 technological scientific ranks relatively early.  This was of great utility
 to its attainment of the leading place in production and technology.  The
 great significance of such experience should be fully emphasized.
 2.  Adjustments in the proportion of technological development to engi-
 neering technology in common use are useful to facilitate rapid scientific
 and technological results in social practice.  For example, in industrial
 experience, flatly stressing the development of production during a given
 period not only led to underemphasis on scientific research but caused
 production engineering and the advancement of related technology to be
 severely neglected, as well as leading to the neglect of general techno-
 logical development.  Therein lies the crux of the problem of retarded
 application of many scientific and technological achievements, high
 production costs, and low quality.  Since production engineering and
 development of technological research both require a great deal of work,
 this deficiency necessitates earnest treatment.  The development of pro-
 duiction should he adjusted conscientiously, duplication reduced, quality
 improved, and efficiency raised.  The transfer of a substantial amount
 of energy to production engineering is beneficial to the development of tech-
 nological science.  The lesson to be derived from Soviet experience is that
 underemphasis on the development of engineering technology should be
 avoided.

 3.  One should fully understand and abide by the rules of interdependence
 between the development of science and technology and the development  of
 production. Practice demonstrates that science and technology  develop-
 ment often leads to a rise to a new level of production.  A great amount
 of new technology is currently available abroad which can be of use to
 our production.  Production requires the utmost prior resolution of tech-
 nological problems, only after which can one move freely ahead.  In view
 of these points, scientific and technological work is the precursor  of
 production and daily practice.  But on the other hand, the task of devel-
 oping science and technology must be addressed primarily from the view-
 point of social practice.                Everyday practice has given far more data  and
 source material to the development of science and technology than scien-
 tific experiments have been able to provide.  Many scientific and techno-
 logical achievements reach final realization only after a long period                  of
 practical verification, substantiation, revision,aand development.    The
 scope of science and technology developnent should be adapted to the needs
 and capabilities of the level of economic development.  Viewed in this
 light, science and technology development is the continuation of the devel-
 opment of production and construction.   In the US and Japan, during the course
 of science and technology development, we can see everywherethe great degree
 to.which the development of production and construction has promoted and
 conditioned the development of science and technology.
 4.  Several other important problems must also be managed well for the
 development of science and technology.
 (1)  Theory and Practice:  '1any concrete science and.technology problems
 can only be exposed and resolved through profound, broad social practice.
 In the development of science and technology, theory and experimentation
 are indivisible.   It may be that theoretical work is the key element in
 certain sciences and tasks.  But as far as scientific and technological
 work as a whole is concerned, that by far the greatest part is accounted
 for by experimental work is a fact which must be faced.
 (2)  Scientific Research and Inventions:  Contemporary, systematic
 scientific research and technological development have made unprecedented
 contributions to new, technology.  But after the expansion of social
 practice and the general elevation of the people's comprehension of
 science, the process of inventing, rather than having lost ground, has
 flourished, with practical experience and creative ideas the essential
 factors, and even more has been based on the new level of knowledge.   In
 the same year that nations are celebrating the 100th anniversary of
 Einstein's birth, the US is holding a great celebration of the 100th
 anniversary of Edison's invention of the electric light bulb.  The
 solid ranks of inventors remain a major support for the economic develop-
 ment and technological advancement of today's developed countries.

 (3)   Imported Technology and the Development of Domestic Science and
 Technology: In reality many achievements which we have not yet mas-
 tered exist in the world.   We should make full use of imported tech-
 nology, earnestly and honestly studying and profoundly assimilating
 it.   But through imports we can only learn of other people's exper-
 iences; we cannot learn the rich knowledge accumulated by others
 through long practice nor can we achieve the essential development
 of our own science and technology, modes of thinking, work methods,
 or work style.  Technology importation certainly has its limits.  To
 go the last step toward advanced international standards, one  must
 rely on oneself.  The Japanese studied a great deal of foreign tech-
 nology, thereby saving themselves a great deal of science and tech-
 nology development work, but they applied themselves positively ra-
 ther than relaxing their own technological development.  Because of
 this they were able to surpass the level of overseas technology,
 entering the international front ranks while expending relatively little
 energy of their own.  We should study Japan's experience.
 (4)  New and "Traditional" Disciplines:  The newly developing discipline
 often symbolizes new progress in the level of science and technology
 and should of course be emphasized during the phase of initial acqui-
 sition.  "Traditional" disciplines also have great vitality and are
 often the essential foundation for new disciplines, but they are also
 often the.wealt stages of backward countries.  They also reach new levels
 in the process of going from superficial to profound, from low to high,
 to the point that some are once again transformed into important, brand
 new disciplines.  Therefore, they too'must be fully emphasized.
 In sum, during work on the four scientific and technological stages, one
 should give the proper weight to various relationships.   In the past,
 technological development was stressed, the other three stages being
 slighted.  Our work covers a broad range but is sometimes blocked by
 crucial technology so that protracted effort accomplishes nothing.  To
 overcome these difficulties, it is necessary to strengthen research in
 the technological sciences and accumulate technological reserves.   In
 areas where the responsibilities of scientific institutes, institutions
 of higher education, and industrial departments overlap, applied tech-
 nological scientific research should be allowed to occupy its proper
 place and advance by means of overall planning, full cooperation, and
 the making of contributions.

 [Article by Sun Xiaoliang [1327 2400 5382]:  "How Economic Leadership Depart-
 ments  Can Make Their Macroeconomic Policy Formulation More Scientific"--
 passages enclosed in slantlines printed in boldface]
 [Text]   (I)  An important lesson from the experience of Economic Construction
 Over the past 31 years, our country's total output value has grown very rapidly.
 Except for a few years, the annual growth rate always stayed above 7 percent.
 The accumulation rate was also very high, reaching around 30 percent in the
 majority of these 31 years.  However, we did not achieve the desired economic
 results.  Only 69 percent of the total investment was converted into fixed
 assets.  Only 46 percent of it has genuinely played a role in the. economy.  The
 standard of living of the masses of people has not been improved to the desired
 extent.  Huge amounts of capital funds have been wasted or have been tied up
 because of overstocking.
 There are many reasons for this situation.   An important lesson from our exper-
 ience is that our macroeconomic policy formulation was unscientific.   This was
 reflected, in practice, in the formulation of unrealistic principles and poli-
 cies, the lack of a scientific basis in formulating construction plans, the
 issuing of arbitrary and impracticable directions, and so on.
 Examples of unrealistic principles and policies include the continuous promo-
 tion of production relations to higher levels, causing them to surpass the level
 of development of the productive forces; principles that violated the laws
 governing socialized large-scale production, such as principles requiring each
 province to become a self-contained economic system, requiring each locality
 to produce a balanced assortment of materials and to make available complete
 sets of equipment, and so on; slogans such as putting an end to the situation
 of having to transport coal from the north to the south, and so on; policies
 concerning the use of fuel, such as switching from coal to oil and then later
 inconsistently switching from oil to. coal, and so on; and so forth.
 Examples of the lack of a Scientific basis in formulating construction plans in-
 clude the following:  The 10-year plan stipulating the building of 120 major
 projects was put forth before the possibility of making the funds available was
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100190001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 calculated.   Imports were made on a massive scale before the availability of
 foreign exchange was ensured, so with regard to some imported items, though
 contracts had been signed, their implementation had to be postponed or the
 contracts had to be amended because of a lack of funds.  The project of
 "supplying Sichuan's natural gas to other provinces" was decided upon before
 the natural gas reserve was cearly ascertained, so that the project had to be
 discontinued halfway because of the inadequate reserve.  Numerous major pro-.
 jects were started before raw materials, motive power or complete sets of equip-
 ment were available.  Some completed projects incurred losses right from the
 time they went into operation.
 In our economic life, there have also been numerous instances of issuing arbi-
 trary and impracticable directions.  Sometimes, major economic policies were
 formulated on the basis of some "tendencies" or of some leaders' feelings.
 When the call for developing the iron and steel industry on a massive scale
 was issued, several hundred thousand people were directed into this effort;
 everywhere primitive blast furnaces were set up;  trees were cut down when
 coal was not available; in many regions, highly valuable forestry resources
 were destroyed; and consequently money and manpower were wasted, with the
 losses being greater than the gains.  When the slogan of "do away with the
 dictatorship of rules and regulations" was put forth, all enterprises were put
 under lower administrative levels.   Some enterprises which provided services
 on a nationwide scale were also put under county authorities.  The consequence
 was chaos in economic life over a period of time.  To develop a dozen or more
 daqings was merely casual talk, but this turned out to be the basis for formu-
 lating plans for opening up oilfields.
 These ways of formulating macroeconomic policy, which were unscientific or
 even contrary to science, resulted in losses, some of which are incalculable.
 Therefore, we must make our macroeconomic  policy formulation more scientific;
 that is, we must make it compatible with the objective reality and economic
 laws, and we must have an accurate numerical basis and must perform quantita-
 tive analysis.  If this problem remains unsolved, the national economic propor-
 tional relations will be disrupted again even if they have been readjusted, and
 the economy will not be markedly improved.
 (II)   The Importance of This Problem
 The problem of making macroeconomic policy formulation more scientific is an
 extremely important problem, rather than being an ordinary one.  It affects the
 future and destiny of the planned economy.  It is connected with whether the
 superiority of the socialist system can be brought into play, and whether the
 system of ownership by the whole people will degenerate.
 The founders of scientific socialism clearly stated that the basic contradic-
 tion in the capitalist system is that between the socialization of production
 and the private ownership of the means of production.  The forms of expression
 of this basic contradiction are the class antagonism between the proletariat
 and the bourgeoisie, as well as the anarchic state of social production.  This
 contradiction can be radically resolved through the seizure of public authority
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 by means of the proletarian revolution, and the exercise of this authority to
 make possible the social ownership of the means of production, to free the
 means of production from their subordination to capital, and to acknowledge
 their social nature.  On the basis of public ownership, the anarchic state of
 social production must give way to regulation by planning mechanism, and social
 labor time must be consciously allocated according to proportions among various
 categories of production, so that the development of the productive forces can
 be promoted.  [HK230230]  This is an important manifestation of the superiority
 of the socialist system.  However, the goal of proportionate development can be
 attained only with scientific centralized social planning.  Bitter experiences
 at home and abroad have. proved that unscientific centralized social planning
 will only lead to the artificial disruption of proportional relations.  More-
 over, the consequences of disrupting the proportional relations "in  a planned
 way" are much more serious than those of the spontaneous disruption of the pro-
 portional relations.  Precisely because of this, although we have instituted the
 public ownership of the means of production and have adopted the planned economy,
 the superiority of the socialist system has not been fully brought into play
 because the formulation of many macroeconomic policies has been unscientific.
 To demonstrate the vitality of the planned economy, we must not rely mainly on
 "theoretically explaining" its superiority.  Instead, we must "prove" its
 superiority "through practice."  If our planning is unrealistic, violates eco-
 nomic laws, is marked by the lack of accurate data as its basis, and is effected.
 through the "invention of ideas" by a minority of people, then the reputation of
 the planned economy will certainly be tarnished, and its prestige will certainly
 be damaged.  The First Five-Year Plan was rather satisfactory.  It really effec-
 tively guided our national economic development and enabled people to realize
 the superiority of the planned economy.  However, late on, for one thing, attempts
 were made to continuously widen the scope of planning and increase the contents
 of our plans, so that our work load was divorced from our actual capabilities
 and standards.  For another thing, the setting of high targets and the issuing
 of arbitrary. and impracticable directions gradually became dominant, and criti-
 cisms were continually launched against right conservatism and the passive main-
 tenance of equilibrium; and consequently, our planning became less and less
 scientific.   If things continue like this, the prestige of the planned economy
 among the people of the world will be utterly destroyed, and the planned. economy
 will be deprived of its vitality.
 Unrealistic policy formulation, unscientific planning for construction and issu-
 ing arbitrary and impracticable directions, actually amount to the degeneration
 of the system of ownership by the whole people.   In our country, such ownership
 is realized through the ownership of the means of production by the state in the
 name of the people.  Real life experience tells us that when our state organs
 formulate economic policies, there may be two categories of possible results
 with regard to whether such policies represent the common will and. interests of
 al.l. of the people.  When the economic policies formulated by the state are scien-
 tific, the implementation of such policies inevitably promotes our national eco-
 nomic development.   This amounts to representing the people's common will and
 interests, and the realization of ownership by all of the people.   When the eco-
 nomic policies formulated by the state are unscientific, the implementation of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 such policies inevitably lead to hugh losses and waste.  This is against the
 common will and interests of all the people.  However, the laborers are in-
 capable of doing anything about it.  Therefore, this actually amounts to the
 disintegration of ownership by all of the people.
 Thus, from whichever point of view, we should not consider the problem of mak-
 ing macroeconomic policy formulation more scientific as an ordinary or minor
 problem.
 (III)  How To Make Macroeconomic Policy Formulation More Scientific
 The major requirement is that we must eliminate the influence of "leftist" ide-
 ology in economic work.  An increasingly large number of comrades are. beginning
 to realize this point, and are effectively performing work in this respect.  The
 power of economic policy formulation must be linked to the responsibility for
 the consequences of implementing economic policies.   We must put an end to the
 situation in which the subjectivist issuing of arbitrary and impracticable di-
 rections causes losses to the state amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan,
 and the policymakers shoulder no responsibility for these economic consequences.
 Aside from these two methods, we must, by reforming our economic management sys-
 tems, make our methods of organization and our systems capable of ensuring more
 scientific macroeconomic policy formulation.
 We must not believe that the reform of our economic management system merely
 amounts to expanding the enterprises' decisionmaking power.   When the enter-
 prises' decisionmaking power is expanded and microeconomic activity is promoted,
 there will be an urgent need to strengthen guidance by planning.  The formulation
 of plans must be scientific, and the means of guidance must be powerful, so that
 the conscious and proportionate development of the entire national economy can
 be ensured.  To achieve this, we should include at least the following three..
 elements in the reform of our economic management system.   (1)  The enterprises
 under the ownership of the whole people should "be subjected to ownership by the
 whole people, practice independent accounting, and assume sole responsibility
 for their profits and losses," so that the power to run the enterprises indepen-
 dently, and an internal motive force that promotes continuous improvements in
 management and operations will be available.   (2)  We must reform the functional,
 organizational and personnel structures of government departments in charge of
 economic management, so that macroeconomic policy formulation can be made more
 scientific.   (3)  We must reform and perfect the agencies of economic regulation,
 and flexibly employ various means of regulation, so that a "bridge" can be
 established between the state's macroeconomic policy formulation and the enter-
 prises' microeconomic policy formulation.   [HK230312]   If these three categories
 of reform are carried out, then the enterprises' and the workers' enthusiasm,
 initiative and creativity can be brought into play, and microeconomic results
 will he improved; and moreover, proportionate national economic development can
 he consciously maintained, so that macroeconomic results will be ensured.
 A rather popular view holds that if the enterprises assume sole responsibility
 for their profits and losses, then the government departments at various levels
 responsible for economic management can be combined or abolished.  Actually,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 things are quite far from being so simple.  When the enterprises have been
 assigned greater decisionmaking power, not only must the government depart-
 ments responsible for economic management use a new set of methods to guide
 economic activities so as to ensure the achievement of overall equilibrium,
 but macroeconomic policy making must really become scientific.  This is a very
 arduous task.  Therefore, for the economic management departments of the state,
 reform is not merely a matter of simplification, combination and abolition, but
 amounts to a series of structural reforms.
 /First, the functional structure must be reformed./  At present, our government
 departments responsible for economic management are actually performing two
 categories of functions.  First, they study and formulate principles, policies
 and plans concerning national economic development.  Generally speaking, this
 function lies within the scope of macroeconomic policy formulation.  Second,
 they organize and direct the enterprises' activities in production, supply and
 marketing.  Generally speaking, this belongs to the scope of microeconomic policy
 making.  At present, a large proportion of their time and efforts are actually
 used to organize the enterprises' production, supply and marketing activities.
 The work of studying and formulation principles, policies and development plans
 is done in a very crude manner.  With the assumption of sole responsibility for
 profits and losses by the enterprises and the assigning of microeconomic deci-
 sionmaking power to the'enterprises, this functional structure must undergo a
 major reform.  With the implementation of the reform, the economic management
 departments will inevitably have to do some work in coordinating production,
 supply and marketing, but their main function and key task will be macroeconomic
 policy formulation, to which they must devote the greater proportion of their
 time.
 /Second, we must reform the organizational structure./  At present, our govern-
 ment departments responsible for economic management actually consist of two
 categories of organizations.  The first category are organs of power, which are
 mainly responsible for organizing, directing and controlling production, distrib-
 uting funds and material resources, deciding upon construction projects, and so
 on.  The second category are advisory bodies, which are mainly responsible for
 making investigations about and studying principles and policies, compiling and
 analyzing information, studying development plans, designing schemes for policy
 formulation, and so on.  Judging from present circumstances, specialized advisory
 bodies are too few.  Their work is mostly concurrently performed by organs of
 power, so that it is very difficult to perform such work meticulously and to a
 great depth.  Our past mistakes of various types of macroeconomic policy formula-
 tion were to a great extent due to the underdevelopment of such advisory bodies.
 The formulation of an economic policy generally involves three "subprocesses."
 First, we must compile adequate and accurate data, some of which may be collected
 for a short period of time, but most must be collected on an annual basis.  If we
 do not compile and analyze information in this way, it will be impossible for us
 to'formulate our policies on a scientific basis.  The second stage is to design
 schemes for policy formulation.   On the basis of mastering and analyzing an ade-
 quate amount of information, we must design a number of schemes for policy formu-
 lation, analyze the feasibility of these schemes, and clearly know the advantages
 of each.  This requires a great deal of expert knowledge and a large number of
 qualified specialists.   The last stage is to select the right policy.   The person

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 or group responslbie tor decislonmaking will choose one from a number of
 schemes presented for implementation.  That is, he or they will "have the
 final say."  The first two stages involve a great deal of work which cannot
 be performed by a policymaker or a number of policymakers, but must be done
 by advisory bodies.  Without those bodies which are essential for compiling
 information and designing schemes for policy formulation, the policymakers
 will not have any accurate data, any quantitative analysis findings, or a
 number of schemes to compare and select from, as was the case of "supplying
 Sichuan's natural gas to other provinces."  Under these circumstances, even
 if the policymakers are technical experts, it will be very difficult for them
 to formulate scientific policies, even after repeated group discussions.  The
 reason is very simple.  They lack the requisite basis for scientific policy
 formulation.  Therefore, with the expansion of the enterprises' decisionmaking
 power, the organs of power should be simplified, combined or abolished, while
 the advisory bodies should be increased and strengthened.  We must also estab-
 lish, as quickly as possible, certain bodies which have not been established,
 such as an overall national economic planning department, whose establishment
 has been repeatedly proposed by Comrade Qian Xuesen.
 [HK230340]  /Third, we must reform the personnel structure./  The need for re-
 forming the personnel structure arises from the reform of the functional and
 organizational structures.  On one hand, with the vanishing of the function of
 organizing and directing production, supplying and marketing activities, and
 with the decrease in the number of organizations, the size of the contingent of
 personnel will inevitably be correspondingly greatly reduced.  On the other
 hand, with the rising need for scientific macroeconomic policy formulation, and
 with the strengthening of advisory bodies, there must be a great increase in the
 number of'people needed for the satisfactory formulation of macroeconomic poli-
 cies, such as experts in social engineering and systems engineering, mathemati-
 cians, statisticians, economic management experts, and so on.  Such is the
 reform in the personnel structure of the state's economic management departments.
 Abstract reasoning invariably does not leave such a deep impression as concrete
 facts do.  Because at present, people have not adequately paid attention to
 this issue, it is necessary to introduce here some relevant circumstances in
 Hungary.  Not long ago, some personnel of Hungary's Central Statistical Bureau
 told the comrades of our country's observation group that subsequent to their
 economic reform, the work of their statistical bureau changed greatly and they
 began to pay greater attention to analyzing major problems; for example, analyz-
 ing and studying the effects of various regulatory means on the economy, studying
 how net income can be optimally distributed between the state and the enterprises,
 studying the enterprises' wages funds and their relationship with the accomplish-
 ment of tasks, and so on.   Every year, the bureau conducts a family livelihood
 survey of 2,300'families of various types, such as those of workers, peasants,
 mental workers, retired persons, and so on.   It analyzes facts related to their
 income and consumption, and also changes in their consumption pattern.   A spe-
 cial research office under the statistical bureau is responsible for making fore-
 casts, three times a year.     Once every 2 years, the bureau prepares an input-
 output table providing information about 30 sectors. and once every 3 to 5 years,
 it prepares another such table concerning 100 sectors.  Some 1,000 people of the
 statistical bureau, or approximately 7,000 people if those belonging to local
 statistical departments are included, are' involved in the carrying out of these
 tasks.

 What we have described is just a small part of the work which must bedone to
 do a good job of macroeconomic policy formulation.  However, we can see from
 this that making macroeconomic policy formulation more scientific cannot depend
 on our wish alone; it requires us to do a great deal of arduous and meticulous
 work.  The agencies and personnel of our existing economic management depart-
 ments are incapable of meeting the needs.  Not to mention the issuing or arbi-
 trary and impracticable directions, marked by "great determination with little
 knowledge of the-situation," our government bodies and personnel are probably
 incapable of doing a good job of scientific economic policy formulation.  Last
 year, several mathematicians proposed using the scientific method of input-
 output tables to achieve a satisfactory comprehensive national economic equi-
 librium.   According to our knowledge, some foreign friends have also put forth
 similar ideas.  This is really necessary in the light of the requirements of
 making economic policymaking more scientific.  However, this is not feasible
 in the light of the foundation of our work and other objective conditions.  The
 way out is to reform the functional, organizational and personnel structures of
 our economic management departments, so that conditions will be created for the
 attainment of this goal.

 CO`NO=NTATOR ON APPLICATION OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY
 HK220632 Beijing RENNIN RIBAO in Chinese 13 Aug 81 p 3
 (Commentator's article:  "Scientific and Technological Work Must Be Oriented to 'Applica-
 tion"')
 (Text]  The national conference on scientific and technological work convened at the end
 of last year defined the principle that science and technology must serve the development
 of the national economy.  How are we carrying out this principle in practical work?  The
 technological exchanges organized by the State Scientific and Technological Commission
 and the State Economic Commission concerning the popularization and application of new
 materials such as organic silicon, organic fluorine and so on, have given us an
 important inspiration:  to center our work on "application," and help scientific and
 technological achievements to be applied as soon as possible to industrial and
 agricultural production, so as to push ahead with the development of the national economy.
 To center on "application" in scientific and technological work means in principle to do
 a good job of popularizing and applying those new technologies invented at home and abroad
 which have been proved to fit our country's circumstances, and to push the transfer of
 science and technology from laboratories to plants, from military to civilian use, and
 from abroad to home.  At present, our country possesses over 4,000 independent scientific
 research units and a scientific and technological contingent of several million, who are
 both Red and expert.
 In some advanced and difficult branches of technology, we have considerable capability
 to break down technical harriers.  However, due to irrationality in economic and
 scientific research systems, divorce between scientific and technological work and
 economic work is quite common.  Although we can make tremendous progress in some very
 advanced branches of technology, our technology for producing commodities that are greatly
 needed by the masses is really backward.  Although we have made many individual achievements
 in fields such as large integrated circuits, lasers and so on, we lack the comprehensive
 technological capability to produce items in complete sets.  Quite a number of new results
 and new products come about every year, but only a few of them can really be applied and
 put into mass production.   Some new techniques are still confined to production in military
 industry and have not been popularized quickly in the production of civilian goods.
 Some new techniques introduced from abroad have not yet been well digested and popularized.
 The aim of centering on "application" and carrying out the three transfers is to overcome
 the weakness brought about by the divorce of science and technology from economic construc-
 tion, and to give full play to science and technology so as to improve economic effect and
 push ahead with economic development.

 Thers aro many branchar of netence.and technology.  In research, there are basic, applied,
 and development research.  In order to center on "application," and to enforce the three
 transfers, we have ro handle well the relations between them.  Basic research cannot be
 neglected, and pioneering work has to be continued. But, since science and technology must
 serve the national economy, much effort (including manpower, material resources and
 financial capacity) still have to be devoted to applied and development research.  At
 present, there are many technologies at home and abroad that suit the conditions of our
 country.  If we use these new technologies to transform and replenish the existing
 380,000 enterprises, to solve those problems of the national economy that are of great
 significance in terms of economic effect, and to improve old technologies and to create
 new ones on the basis'of application, then our production capacity will be greatly raised
 and better economic results will be achieved.  The popularization and application of new
 materials such as organic silicon, organic fluorine and so on have set very good examples.
 To orient scientific and technological work to "application" and to carry out the three
 transfers, we are required to consider the economy, science and technology and social
 development together, and to strengthen the close coordination between scientifc research
 units and production units.  As scientific research departments are those which know
 best the characteristics, effects and uses of scientific research results, naturally
 they should take the responsibility for popularization and application.   Scientific
 research departments should promote social service work, and all application research
 institutes should establish close contact with enterprises.  Scientific research units
 must make economic contracts with production units so as to push forward technical services
 and popularization services.  These contracts, concerning production, design, construction
 and advisory services, range from those linking remuneration to work to those compensating
 for transfer of researl:h results.  At present, some regions and departments have already
 broken down the barriers of the "local ownership system" and "departmental ownership system."
 They make contracts with whatever unit which can render good services; some of them
 even organize various forms of integration of scientific research and production.. All
 these practices which enable the services of science and technology for the economy to
 develop to more sophisticated forms.of organization deserve to be promoted.

 ECONOMIC RATIONALITY MUST ACCOMPANY TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENT
 Tianjin KEXUEXUE in Chinese No 2, 20 Aug 80  pp 11-14
 [Article by Lu Taihong [4151 1132 1347]:  "Technical Advancement and Economic
 Rationalization"]
 [Text]  The three elements of economic growth are:  an increase in.labor, an in-
 crease in capital and adoption of new technology.  Adoption of new technology
 occupies a more and more important position among these three elements with the
 rapid development of science and technology.  Take Japan, for example.  The con-
 tribution to its economic growth from the end of the war to 1960 was approximately
 52 percent due to the labor force, 43 percent due to technological development and
 only 5 percent due to increase in capital.  The period 1965-1970 was a period in
 which Japan's economy showed a very rapid growth rate--an average annual rate of
 11.6 percent, of which 4.4 percent was achieved with an aid of science and tech-
 nology.  According to many forecasts, 65 percent of Japan's economic growth during
 the 1980's will be due to the power of science and technology.  According to a study
 made by an American economist, E. F. Denison [phonetic], adoption of advanced tech-
 nology constitutes 44 percent of the weight of various factors contributing toward
 increased production.   In fact, 40 to 60 percent, or even 80 percent, of the economic
 growth achieved by a few advanced nations is due to the adoption of new technology.
 Therefore, a large amount of advanced technology must be employed in order to develop
 the economy.  However, can every concrete technological advance bring about economic
 benefit?  The answer appears to be affirmative, but in fact, it is not.  Here are
 a number of examples attesting to this effect:
 The solar energy hot water heater, distributed by Beijing service enterprises, which
 has been praised as "a new blossom of science and technology" and widely propagan-
 dized by the newspapers and radio star ions, was awarded a national science confer-
 ence aw;ird.   A total of 41 units of this solar energy hot water heater were built,
 as a result of which 700-800 tons of coal could be saved a year and air pollution
 could be eliminated at the same time.  However, since the cost of operating the
 solar energy hot water heater comes to almost twice the cost of heating water with
 a conventional boiler, many units which are in possession of such equipment often
 opt not i:o use it.   A certain unit spent over 10 million foreign exchange units in
 order to import an advanced computer.  But h.ecause of its low rate of utilization,
 a few hears each day at most, the economic profit it earns is not even enough to
 make up its depreciation cost.   Various types of advanced numerically controlled
 lathes and work centers developed and manufactured in China during the 1970's have
 not been popular among the-users in spite of their high degree of automation and

 supcr for capability.  On the other hand, a type of numerically controlled linear
 cutting; lathe which is far simpler in design (so it is not counted as part of the
 numerically controlled lathes nationwide) has become so popular that the supply
 could not meet the demand for a time.
 Many similar phenomena have been observed during the process of our technological
 development.  Which'prompts one of ask:  Why?  Where is the grave illness of the
 problem?  This article will not attempt to provide an overall answer to these
 questions.  It merely intends to start out from a number of important facts related
 to technological development and economic growth and to analyze and discuss one side
 of the problem--technical advancement and economical rationalization--with the
 hope of contributing in a very small way toward establishment of a technological
 policy.
 1.  Three Foundations for the Establishment of Technological Policies
 If the body of science and technology is compared to a tree, then science is the
 root and trunk, while technology is the branches and fruits.  Technology depends on
 science for survival, while science is materialized through technology. The measure
 for science is truthfulness while the measure for technology consists of advancement,
 economy and safety.  Since the end of World War II, science and technology have grown
 into a giant tree with an abundance of branches and leaves reaching into the blue
 sky.  Therefore, it has become more and more difficult to give an overall evaluation
 of the entire body of science and technology or to make an accurate prediction
 about it.  As a result, technology policies which define the direction and guide
 the development of technology were necessary.  The facts concerning the world's
 technological development indicated that a correct technology policy could bring
 about an enormous strategic profit to a nation, while unaccountable losses were
 also brought about as a result of wrong technology policies.  For example, the
 Soviet Union made a mistake on technology policy related to the raw material used
 in the electronics industry.  While the semiconductor industries of the technologi-
 cally advanced nations were quickly converting from germanium to silicon as the
 main raw material for semiconductors, the Soviet Union preferred germanium and con-
 tinued to pursue germanium technology.  Later on, when it too decided to make the
 conversion, it had already lost a considerable amount of time, manpower and material
 power, and a state of backwardness in the electronics industry resulted.  In the
 field of chemical industry, the Soviet Union failed to recognize the importance of
 the petrochemical industry, so not enough effort was made.  As a result, the Soviet
 Union was still dependent on imported technology in the 1970's.  China, during the
 1950's and 1960's, failed to assess the true strategic significance of the electronics
 industry, so, in addition to the "congenital disorder," "malnutrition" at a later
 time created a severely backward state of electronics industry in China today.  How-
 ever, in the field of oil resources, a new view presented by Comrade Li Siguang con-
 cerning the existence of an oil-bearing basin in the depression belt of the New
 Huaxia system in China's northeast area provided a basis for policy-making by the
 central government and thus steered China away from entering the very expensive
 road of synthetic fuels.  The United States is the country in which research into
 machine translation was done the earliest.   It is in possession of enormous power
 for carrying out research.  However, after a white paper was published in 1966
 pointing out the mistaken trend of machine translation, the development of machine
 translation has declined.  In recent years, more and more nations have begun to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 attach greater importance to technological policies and their development.  In the
 United States, a law was enacted in 1972 establishing a mechanism so that all
 important technological policies (such as energy resources) will be decided by the
 president personally.  There are many technology policy problems which are related
 to the realization of the four modernizations in China today.  A leading comrade of
 the Academy of Sciences says:  "Research into technology policy is an important
 undertaking having strategic significance not only for China's science and technology
 but also for the economy."
 What should be the bases for doing research and drafting in order to produce tech-
 nology policies which are as correct as possible?  The following results have been
 obtained from an analysis of a large volume of facts throughout the history of
 development of science and technology:  technological evaluation, economic evaluation
 and damage evaluation are the three indispensable bases for drafting correct tech-
 nology pclicies.  The technological evaluation weighs the advancement of technology;
 economic evaluation weighs the economic advnatages and disadvantages of the tech-
 nology; and the damage evaluation weighs the damages that the technology may bring
 about.  Without evaluating the advancement of technology, technological development
 may produce a large number of repetitions and waste, or introduce obsolete equipment,
 or engage in research into technologies which have -long been solved.  There are
 numerous examples of unnecessary losses incurred as a result of lack of information
 and neglect in evaluating the advancement of technology.  Yang Zhenning once esti-
 mated that "at least 40 percent of China's research topics are subjects which have
 already been solved abroad."  Without evaluating the economic rationality, the
 various probable courses the technology may follow cannot be compared and the best
 course chosen among them; nor is it possible to find out whether the advanced
 technology can enter into a practical application stage, or become popularized and
 widespread; nor is it possible to expose any latent weaknesses that the technology
 may possess.   Is an advanced technology adoptable?  We must find the answer in how
 economically rational the technology is.  This is a commonly known principle under-
 stood by everybody in the course of our own daily lives.  The reasons why nylon
 stockings so quickly replaced silk stockings is not only because nylon stockings
 have appeal and durability (advancement), but also because nylon stockings are
 economically profitable.  Although the airplane is one of the means of transporta-
 tion with a highly advanced technology, many people still prefer to ride on trains
 or steamships.   One of the reasons is that the air fare is too expensive (economically
 irrational).  A pity!   Such a simple yet important principle has never been suffi-
 ciently applied to our technology management in the past.   Scientific research pro-
 ject proposals are often found without an estimation and comparison of economic
 cost and a prediction of the technological and economic effects.   In screening the
 project proposals, little attention has been paid to the economic rationality of  -
 the project.  In evaluating the achievement or popularization of a new technology,
 we lack the figures of competitive economic indexes as a guide for passing judgment.
 A few years ago, there was even a mistaken notion or slogan which ignored the
 economic evaluation completely.  For example:  "It does not matter how much money.
 is spent as long as it can be developed."  Or, some projects which have been comple-
 te-1 domestically are used "to fill the gap in this province (or this district, etc)."
 Using this kind of standard in screening and awarding, many projects which were
 neither advanced technologically nor ration,.:' economically were simply copied.
 Without evaluating the damage that a technology may bring about, no preventive
 measures and warnings against the side effects of a technology can be issued, so in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 the end, the loss may become greater than the gain.  As a result of severe air
 pollution created by the industrialization in and around London, England, in the.
 early 1950's, a tragedy of 4,000 deaths within 4 days was recorded.  The accident
 which took place at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in the United States
 ,in 1979 sent ripples all over the world, causing those nations with nuclear potJer
 plants to reevaluate their technology policies.  A great number of small automobiles
 solved the transportation problem, but at the same time, created a shortage of
 energy resources and air pollution.  Advanced automation technology can significantly
 increase labor productivity, but is also capable of creating employment problems
 in a country like China with a large population. An irrational way of creating
 rice paddies from lakes, hydraulic engineering projects without a bioenvironmental
 concept, and excessive fishing and water pollution can all contribute to a signifi-
 cantly reduced yield of fresh. water fish.
 Moreover, we can also understand how inseparable these three foundations--evaluations
 of technological advancement, economic rationality and possible damage--are from the
 study of a few special phenomena observed during the course of technological
 development.  For example, utilization of solar energy is overwhelmingly superior to
 any other energy resources, and technical feasibility has long been confirmed.  But
 why is not the technology for utilization of solar energy popular all over the
 world?  In contrast, the microprocessor is a technology which appeared only in the
 early 1970's.  Why was it able within the short period of only a few years to enter
 into commercial production and undergo four generations of changes, with production
 reaching 400,000-500,000 units in 1975, an annual growth rate as high as 52-55 per-
 cent (estimated over the period of 1975-1980) and spread over a very broad area with
 surprising speed?  The United States is a country with highly advanced electronic
 computer technology which is in possession of the most advanced technology of the
 fourth-generation computers.  Why then during the late 1960's and early 1970's did
 it develop and manufacture a large number of sequential control devices, which re-
 quire much less advanced technology than the computers, and popularize them?  Among
 the numerically controlled technologies developed by the United States in the early
 1950's, the closed-loop control was an advanced technology.  However, after the
 closed-loop control technology had matured, why did Japan begin research and develop-
 ment of a technologically simpler open-loop control.technology?  And since 1965, why
 did the United States itself also develop a kind of numerical control device with
 a lower degree of control power using the open-loop control as its main feature?
 In the summer of 1970, a gigantic Aswan Dam was built on the upper Nile River, in-
 cr'L-asing Egypt's farm area by 20 percent and producing 8 billion kW of electric
 power a year.  The project was acclaimed as a "great technological" victory at the
 time.  B y why, only 2 years later, was the project judged by the United Nations
 environmental conference as "a failure in hindsight"?
 During the process of drafting technology policy, the weight assigned to the three--
 technoloiical evaluation, economic evaluation, and damage evaluation--may vary
 according to the objectives and emphases.  In certain circumstances, one of these
 three ma) have to be dominant.  For example, military requirement emphasizes
 advancement of technology.  However, the present trend tends to emphasize evalua-
 tion of advancement of technology and neglect evaluation of economic rationaliza-
 tion and damage.   The science and technology management neglects economic evalua-
 tion, while the economic management neglects technological evaluation.  As one of
 leading comrades of the State Science Commission observed: "Generally speaking,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 the comrades who are engaged in economic work lack understanding of science and
 technology matters and so are unable to think deeply about technological advancement
 and possibilities."  We shall put aside the damage evaluation for a while and con-
 centrate on an analysis of the interrelationship between technological evaluation
 and economic evaluation.
 2.  Four types of Technology and Four Stages of Technological Development
 In order to take into consideration both technology and economy, the foreign manage-
 ment field has developed the concepts of "performance-cost ratio" and "performance-
 cost curve."                 These useful concepts are employed to express the different economic
 prices required by the different technologies to achieve the same performance.
 Starting out with this concept, various types of technologies may be grouped into
 four groups.  When wo select technology from an ocean of technologies, we can choose
 from one of these four groups.
 First group:  Backward technology and high economic price.
 Second group: Relatively backward technology with some economic profit.  For
 example, coal as an energy source used in some old equipment and old technology
 engaged in production.
 Third group:  Advanced technology with high economic cost and high price.  For
 example, solar energy utilization equipment developed in the 1970's; the magnetic-
 ally suspended high-speed train; and the direct steel smelting method.
 Fourth group: Advanced technology and low economic cost.  Typical examples include
 the microprocessors and the minicomputers which appeared in the early 1970's.  A
 minicomputer priced at $300 is more advanced in technology than the first large-
 scale computer (ENIAC) built in the world.   It is 20 times faster, several thousand
 times more reliable, 30,000 times smaller in size, and a millionth the price;  A
 history of computer development spanning more than 30 years indicates that approxi-
 mately every 5-8 years the computer speed is.raised 10 times, the size is reduced
 10 times, and the cost is'also reduced 10 times.  The cost of the.storage device,
 among all the computer components, has been reduced most significantly.  The per-
 formance-cost ratio of the dynamic storage onboard the computer dropped from 1
 penny/bit in 1972 to 0.04 penny/bit in 1979.
 Therefore, technological advancement and economic rationality do not always go hand
 in hand.  The most advanced technology is not necessarily also economically rational.
 An ;advanced technology without economic rationality cannot endure.  At a certain
 time and in a certain domain, it will be replaced by a relatively less advanced
 technology which is economically more rational.  For example, Sweden is a country
 in which the electronic communications technology is relatively advanced.  During
 the 1970's, it already grasped the advanced technology of an all-electronic auto-
 matic exchange.  However, it did not mass-produce this device and utilize it im-
 mediately because it learned from the performance-cost curve that, compared with
 the existing old equipment, the new equipment could become economically rational
 only in the 1980's.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 Furthermore, every single new technology has its life cycle, as. is evident from a
 study of the process of technological development itself.  Each life cycle has four
 stages, including the inception stage, the growth stage, the mature stage and the
 decline stage.  Technology in the inception stage has an uncertain future.  An
 advanced technology with important economic profit can emerge if a breakthrough
 can be made and if it can ride out the technological and economic storms (risks).
 For example, controlled thermonuclear reaction, magnetohydrodynamic power generation,
 generic engineering, and intelligence modeling of the 1970's.  Technology in the
 growth stage has life power and is also in possession of a potential economic com-
 petitive power.  For example, applications of optic fiber communications technology
 and the microprocessors of the 1970's.  According to a Japanese analysis, if the
 profit growth rate of a technology at this stage is above a horizontal line, then a
 steady economic profit over a period of time can be obtained.  Technology in the
 mature stage is an established technology, and it may have already been commercializ-
 ed.  Therefore, it is a waste of money to repeat research work on this type of
 technology. It is more profitable economically to import the technology and try
 to expand it horizontally according to a certain specific need.  For example,
 civilian applications of military technology; household applications of electronics
 technology; and importation of a television production line by China.  Both the
 technological advancement and the economic profit can be further increased if a new
 technology can be created on the foundation of the imported technology (such as the
 steel making technology of Japan and the computer software technology of Rumania).
 -Technology in the decline stage is an obsolete technology-which belongs to the first
 group described above.
 3.  Horizontal Expansion and Vertical Penetration of Technology
 In carrying out the technological evaluation, the first group and the fourth group
 described above are relatively easier to deal with, because the technological
 advancement and the economic rationality are.in agreement in these two groups.  The
 second group and the third group are more difficult to evaluate, because the tech-
 nological advancement contradicts the economic rationality in these two groups.  The
 purpose of applications research and development research is, for the most part, an
 effort to transform this pair of contradictions.  If the factors causing the failure
 of an advanced technology to be adopted are called the risk factors, then there are
 two kinds of risk factors.  The first kind is technological risk:  failure is
 brought about by insufficiently verified technology, insufficient technological
 power, and insufficient ability to assimilate the technology.   The second kind is
 economic risk:   failure is brought about by irrational economics. The tasks of
 technology policy in such circumstances are to select a technological objective
 and chart the course to achieve this objective in spite of the risks.  In selecting
 the technological objective, one concept which has become popular in recent years
 involves adoption of "intermediate technology" or "appropriate technology."  Accord-
 ing to this concept, a relatively advanced technology, situated between the most
 advanced technology and the existing traditional technology, which is most appro-
 priate for the existing circumstances should be selected, because this technology
 is more mature and will be able to bring about large economic advantage.
 Large numbers of facts accumulated over the history of development of technology
 and economy have proven that horizontal expansion and vertical penetration of
 technology are the means employed to reconcile the disagreement between technolog-

 ical advancement and economic rationality.  Horizontal expansion of technology
 means application of the same technological invention in different areas.  Hori-
 zontal expansion of large-scale integrated circuit technology has produced electron-
 ic watches, intelligent machines, intelligent robots, household electronic brains
 and.mini,:omputers.  Laser technology has seen a similar expansion.  A very large
 economic advantage can be brought about when new products are manufactured from the
 combination of a number of technologies in the mature stage.  The Japanese call
 this "combination technology," and they consider that this is one of the trends of
 technological development today.  China should especially emphasize this trend in
 its economic management today and exert efforts to develop new products by extend-
 ing the useful economic life of the existing mature technology.  Vertical penetration
 of technology means to dig deeper into the technology and to make it more advanced.
 Economic irrationality can be transformed into rationality through technological
 breakthroughs.  Electronic computers used to be very expensive, but the price came
 down as a result of the breakthrough of the large-scale integrated circuit.  A huge
 economic advantage has been brought about by the appearance of the large-scale
 technology since the 1950's, and large-scaling has become a trend as well.  For
 example, the manufacturing cost per unit of power output of a 6 million kW generator
 unit is 10-20 percent lower than that of a 200,000 kW unit.   A synthetic ammonia
 facility with an annual capacity of 200,000 tons consumes energy amounting to 1,450
 kWh per ton, while a synthetic ammonia facility with an annual capacity of 460,000
 tons consumes only 50 kWh per ton.  A number of breakthroughs made in the petro-
 chemical industry (consisting mainly of direct synthesis technology and new types
 of catalysts) have likewise made the economic index change toward greater rationality.
 For example, a method of manufacturing acetaldehyde from ethylene by means of direct
 oxidation has brought down the cost by 16 percent, increased the profit by 65 per-
 cent, and reduced the equipment cost by 25 percent.  The production of hexanolactam
 using the toluene method has brought down the cost by 25 percent, increased the
 profit by 100 percent and reduced the equipment cost by 33 percent.
 Another approach to transforming the contradiction between technology and economy
 is to Import technology.  As long as the policy for technology import is correct,
 we cannot only gain time and advancement but also obtain economic profit and ratio-
 nality.  Take Japan, for example.  Japan spent $6 billion on the importation and
 popularization of foreign technologies over the period 1945-1970.  As a result,
 a project could be concluded in 2-3 years based on the imported technologies.  On
 the other hand, the research expenditure of the original technologies was as high
 as $180-200 billion with a time period of 12-15 years for a project to be concluded.
 Therefore, the cost for importation of technology is only 1/30 of the original cost
 and th_~ time is also 4/5 shorter.  To further illustrate this point using specific
 products as an example:   Japan's Toyo Rayon Company spent $7 million to buy a license
 for the production of nylon, and earned from the export of nylon $90 million within
 2 years.  The profit amounted to approximately 13 times the cost of licensing the
 patent.  On the other hand, the Du Pont Company spent more than $250 million and
 11 years in order to develop this patented technology.
 it is evident from the above that technological advancement and economic rationality
 do not always go hand in hand.  Whether a certain technology policy is correct, or
 whether a certain manager is really able is measured by whether the policy or the
 manager is capable of grasping the optimum point at which to carry out this trans-
 formation of contradiction, to achieve the maximum economic effect by adopting the
 advanced technology at the optimum time.

 .   A Few Suggestions
 A.  Technological policy should favor the development of technologies belonging to
 the fourth group (advanced technology with economic rationality).  Application
 screening and evaluation of scientific research projects must include economic
 indexes, and a prediction of the economic rationality and the probable damage must'
 be made.
 B.  Technological policy should protect and financially support those technologies
 which are technologically advanced and economically competitive.   These technolo-
 gies, which are in the growth stage, will hopefully bring about relatively large
 economic effect.  The economic measures and price policies which in practice protect
 the backward technologies should be abanoned as soon as possible.
 C.  In selecting scientific research projects, special attention must be paid to
 those key technologies which can create obstacles to economic rationality.  For
 example, the key technology in the utilization of solar energy is the search for
 better materials with higher conversion efficiency and not different types of con-
 verters.
 D.  The fund controlled by the Economic Commission 'for- developmental research and
 the fund controlled by the Science Commission for scientific research must be
 clearly differentiated according to the subjects for funding..  The Economic Com-
 mission fund should be spent mainly on the horizontal expansion of technology
 in accordance with market demand in order to achieve the maximum economic profit
 in a short period of time.  Therefore, its subjects should consist mainly of'tech-
 nologies in the mature stage.  The fund of the Science Commission should be spent
 mainly on the vertical penetration of technology in order to achieve breakthroughs.
 Therefore, its subjects should consist mainly of technologies belonging to the
 third group, or technologies in the growth stage.
 8.  The economic department should strengthen the upgrading and renewal of products.
 As a result of rapid progress in modern science and technology, the period from the
 appearance of a new technology to a product being produced industrially is becoming
 shorter, so is the period for upgrading and renewal of new products, and also the
 period for an equipment or a technology becoming obsolete.  For example, the life of
 a new product in the United States, West Germany and Japan is in general 6-8 years,
 and no more than 2-3 years for certain most advanced technologies (such as the on-
 board storage device).  The life of new materials is approximately 10 years.  The
 life of new technologies is approximately 7 years, and the life of new instruments
 is approximately 5 years.   About one-fourth of the 3,500 products of the 3M Company
 of the United States were unheard of 5 years ago.  In contrast, some products in
 China have been "continuously in production for several decades."  Large economic
 profit cannot be achieved from the use of technologies which are in the decline
 stage.

 NANFANG RIBAO ON PROMOTING SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY
 HK200307 Guangzhou NANFANG RIBAO in Chinese 29 Sep  81 p 1
 [Commentator's article:  "A New Task in Leading Work in the Rural Areas"]
 [Text] While the agricultural production responsibility system is becoming steadily more
 perfect and the initiative of the peasants in learning and making use of science is surging
 to a new high, how should the party and government, in this new situation, strengthen
 their leadership in the field of agricultural science and technology in order to promote the
 overall development of agricultural production with advanced scientific techniques?  This
 is a new task we are facing in our work in the rural areas.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the party committees
 at all levels in this province have devoted their main efforts to ensuring the imple-
 mentation of the rural economic policies as well as putting into practice various forms
 of the production responsibility system.  In this regard, they have achieved very notable
 results.  In many places earnest efforts have been made in implementing policies while at
 the same time stressing science.  As a result, production has developed just like a
 tiger that has grown wings.  Practice has shown us that policy and science are the two
 deciding factors in agricultural production.  By practicing the production responsibility
 systems, the development of production and the peasants' economic benefits have been
 directly linked, and the study and application of science have become matters that are
 of mutual interest to the masses of the peasants.  In the past, agricultural technological
 publications which were distributed free attracted only a few readers.  Now, people rush
 to purchase these publications.  Formerly, when technicians visited the countryside, few
 people took an interest in them.  Now, the peasants knock on their door to seek their
 advice.  In fact, many agricultural research institutions and stations are as crowded
 as a marketplace.  In this new situation, we can clearly see that with the basic imple-
 mentation of the agricultural responsibility systems, the importance and urgency of
 science as deciding factor has become all the more prominent.  Under these circumstances,
 we must be as enthusiastic in dealing with science as we were with policies, and do our
 very best to satisfy the urgent demands of the peasants in learning and making use of
 science.  It must be pointed out that due to the many years of leftist influence, which
 resulted in the neglect of science and technology as well as the limitations caused by
 the inadequate science and cultural training of the cadres, many comrades are not
 conscientious enough in their work in promoting science.   In this regard, a situation does
 exist where the leading cadres lag behind the masses, and we must clearly recognize this.
 Consequently, to strengthen our scientific and technological work, we must first tackle
 this problem in connection with our guiding ideology in order to ensure that cadres at
 all levels will have a deep understanding of the absolute importance of science and
 technology to the enhancement of economic development and thereby increase their efforts
 in promoting science.

 VIM  pdCty  cuuuulttamdud govV.ruu-aAt at all levels must list the strengthening of science
 and technology in the rural areas as an important item on their agenda, and make it a part
 of the national economic development plan.  This will basically assure the development
 of science and technology in the rural areas. We should assign to scientific and tech-
 nological departments research  projects and tasks as well as support and assist them in
 tackling difficult problems.  We should also investigate all possibilities of yearly
 increasing by small amounts those funds designated for scientific research.  We must
 appoint cadres who are devoted to the cause of science and technology, who have leader-
 ship qualities and are well versed in their professional work, to the leading posts of
 the scientific and technological departments.  We must ake good care of the scientific
 and technological personnel, particularly. the middle-aged and young personnel.  It is
 necessary to earnestly implement the policy dealing with the intellectuals in order to
 further promote the initiative of the agricultural scientific and technological personnel,
 the indigenous experts and the intellectual youths of the rural areas as well as to give
 play to their roles.  The scientific and technological departments must actively imple-
 ment the policy of serving economic construction in their research programs, which in the
 past they undertook in isolation and unrelated to local needs.  They must also devote
 their energy to promoting the development of the local economies.
 In order to strengthen the leadership of the scientific and technological work in the
 rural areas, we must also pay attention to the study of new situations and finding
 solutions to new problems.   For example, in the past, the system of organizing scientific
 and technological research work in the rural areas comprised a four-tier network.  With
 the implementation of the production responsibility systems this organization has, in
 many areas, undergone changes.
 The popularization of scientific knowledge is now directly intended for the thousands
 and thousands of ordinary households.  Many new forms.of activities have appeared, such
 as scientific lectures geared toward the masses, evening classes on science and technology,
 centers for holding technological consultations, contracts for spreading techniques of
 combining production and so on.  Which of these forms do the people actually welcome most
 and which produces the best results.  Investigations into these forms must be made to
 arrive at conclusions on how to improve them.
 Let us take another example.  In the process of implementing economic management methods
 and spreading the results of science and technological improvement, in which ways can
 resonable charges be collected?  In which ways can quality be guaranteed?  These problems
 are directly relevant to the immediate benefits to the peasants as well as to maintaining
 the peasants' enthusiasm in learning and making use of science, and are awaiting our
 investigation and solution.  The bulk of scientific and technological work in the rural
 areas consists of popularizing scientific knowledge and spreading the scientific and
 technological improvements which are suitable to local conditions.  To achieve this, we
 must persist in carrying out the guideline of serving localities in light of present
 conditions, suiting things to local condition, and viewing things from actual conditions.
 In all these aspects, we must be practical and realistic and be careful not to commit such
 mistakes as formalism, commanding blindly, or "cutting with one knife."
 Let us rouse ourselves, strengthen our leadership, do our best to enliven. our work in
 science and technology, do a solid job in initiating an upsurge in studying and making
 use of science in the rural areas throughout the province, and thus construct civilized
 and prosperous socialist new villages.

 'JINGJI GUANLI' ON TECHNICAL TRANSFORMATION
 HK190357 Beijing JINGJI GUANLI [ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT] in Chinese No 10, 15 Oct 81
 p 3-6
 [Article by Chen Yi [7115 2496]:  "Overall Technical Transformation of the National
 Economy Must Be Carried Out."]
 [Text]  1.  The Readjustment of the National Economy Should Be Combined With Tech-
 nical Transformation
 During a period of economic readjustment, how to combine this readjustment with
 technical transformation is a question.kthat should be seriously studied.  At present
 our country's industrial situation is that while light industrial products and tex-
 tiles are unable to meet demand, heavy industry, particularly the machine-building
 industry, is operating below capacity.  To increase the light and textile industries'
 productive power by closing, suspending or amalgamating factories or switching them
 to other production is only a temporary measure and is not the best method.  Such
 amalgamation and switching can neither greatly increase the productive power of
 the light and textile industries, nor can it help to accelerate the socialization
 and modernization of production.  The current situation is one of "tearing down the
 eastern wall in order to repair the western wall."  In actual fact, neither of these
 "walls" is newly built, as both have been in a state of disrepair for a good many
 years.  Furthermore, this approach also raises two other questions:  First, when
 most of the heavy industry is operating below capacity, how is the national economy
 to maintain a steady rate of growth; secondly, how should this temporarily-idle
 productive power be employed, readjusted, strengthened and improved?  In the final
 analysis, implementation of the four modernizations must ultimately depend on heavy
 indsutry, and on. the machine-building industry in particular.
 For these reasons we should view readjustment as a positive measure sand not as a
 case of taking down the eastern wall in order to repair the western wall.  By
 combining readjustment with technical transformation, the whole of the national econ-
 omy can be revitalized.
 It was said recently by a leading comrade that, "in the past the emphasis was placed
 on new construction and external growth; now the emphasis is placed on technical
 transformation and internal improvement.  This is a strategic change in our policy
 for construction.  The need to make full.use of our present material and technical
 base and to carry out an overall technical transformation of the national economy
 is an important task which influences the whole economic situation and one which

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 now clearly faces all parts of the industrial sector, especially the machine-
 building industry."  During the period of readjustment the use of the whole country's
 machine-building power to carry out a gradual technical transformation will allow
 dg to.kill two birds with one stone:  as the level of the entire national economy
 is gradually raised and such a transformation is carried out throughout the economy,
 the machine-building industry itself will also be transformed.  The phenomenon of
 lopsided development will then disappear.
 2.  If the Four Modernizations Are To Be Implemented, an Overall Technical Trans-
 formation
 of the National Economy Must Be Carried out in a Planned Manner
 After more than 30 years of construction, our country has already established a            scomplete industrial base.  However, as far as the needs of the four modernizations
 are concerned, this is clearly not sufficient.  If the year 2000 is assumed to be

 implementation of the four modernizations, this
 means we still have 19 years left to go; or if one calculates from 1985, with the
 completion of readjustment, there are 15 years left; either way the period of time
 is not short.  Both West Germany and Japan managed in the space of about 15 years to
 rebuild themselves into powerful industrial nations from the ruins of war.  Further-
 more, compared with them, our base is stronger, and conditions are slightly better.
 However, two other factors should also be taken into account:  First, compared with
 China, Germany and Japan are relatively small countries with small populations..
 They also had some experience on industrial production, their people had a certain
 degree of education and, more important, both countries enjoyed American support.
 Our situation is thus very different from theirs.  Secondly, the distance separating
 us from the advanced nations of the world is too. great; this is true for all sections
 of the national economy.  Examples of this can be drawn from agriculture as well as
 heavy and light industry:  5 percent of the American population live on the land
 and provide enough food for 200 million people, with per-capita grain consumption
 being around 3,000 jin.  In our country, on the other hand, 80 percent of the po-
 pulation live on the land, which means that a force of 300 million strong farm lab-
 orers must support a total population of 1 billion, and the per capita grain con-
 sumption is only around 600 jin.  With over 12 million workers our country is light
 and textile industries make up the largest part of the industrial sector.  However,
 the people's level of consumption is still  very low compared to other countries.
 Taking 1978 as an example, the average per-capita number of cotton goods produced
 in the developed nations was 3-4 times greater than it was in our country.  As for
 chemical fibers and plastic products, the developed nation's per-capita rate of pro-
 duction was 21 times higher than it was in China.  For synthetic detergents the'
 foreign rate of production was 14 times higher and for sugar and paper it was 13 times
 higher.  The productivity of our country's workforce is also less than it is abroad.
 For example in America the spinning of a piece of 20-count yarn requires only 1.5
 man  days, while in our country it takes 6.5 man days.  Our country's steel industry
 has as many workers as the combined workforce of the American, Russian, Japanese
 and West German steel industries.  However, the actual level of production is less
 than 10 percent of the combined production in these 4 countries.  Our country's
 coal industry employs over 3.8 million workers, which is about the same as the total
 number employed in the important coal-producing nations; however, our coal industry
 accounts for only 20 percent of total world production.  While over 80 percent of
 foreign coalmines have been fully mechanized, only 28 percent of our major mines have
 such equipment.  Our country's power generator installed capacity is only 10 percent

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 that of America's and 50 percent of Japan's.  In terms of workers and the number of
 machine tools, our country's machine-building industry is the second largest in the
 world; the value of output, though, is 1/9 of America's and 1/4 to 1/3 of West Ger-
 many's and Japan's.  Labor productivity in the machine-building industry is about
 1/12 to 1/10 bf that in America, West Germany and Japan.  As for the machine-..
 building industry's production of export products, America, West Germany and Japan
 produce 150 to 200 times more than our country does; France and Britain produce 100
 times more; and even several small East Asian nations produce 5 to 7 times more.  Our
 machine-building industry's utilization rate of steel is only 65 percent, while in
 advanced foreign countries it is up to 80 percent.  The floating capital turnover
 in our machine-building industry takes about 221 days, while in America it is 70
 days and in Japan 76.
 For these reasons it can be seen that while our country has a certain industrial
 and technical base, the actual productive power is extremely low.  At present the
 critical question is how to use our present base and promote its improvement and
 development.  There exist two possible solutions:  the first is to make a determined
 effort to liberate productive force by reforming any irrational relations of pro-
 duction which may now exist.  Generally speaking, if improvements are made in this
 area there should be no problem in increasing productive force by 1/3 to 1/2.  The
 alternative solution is to basically use our present technical and economic base as
 the starting-point for a full-scale technical transformation of our national eco-
 nomy, that is, of our current productive power.  This will mean the renewal of
 critical equipment, the upgrading of backward technology, the reorganization of ir-
 -rational productive units and the use of modern managerial techniques and methods
 to strengthen the administration and management of enterprises.  It can be said
 that aside from these two alternatives, there is no other shortcut.
 3.  The Regular and Sustained Introduction of Technical Improvements Into Industry
 Is a Common'Way of Developing Productive Forces
 An overall survey of Western .nations'industrial development shows that while the
 construction of new factories is a continual process, most new factories are built
 during the initial period of industrial development.  In later periods, the intro-
 duction of technical change in old factories is a more common way of achieving a
 higher level of performance.  In the last 10 or so years in particular, the rapid
 development of science and technology, combined with the intensification of competi-
 tion, has resulted in a constant striving for lower prices which, in turn, has
 benefited both technological and economic development.  There are several common
 methods of achieving this:  The use of the existing economic base combined with a
 strengthening of scientific and technological research; the renewal and replacement
 of outdated equipment; the adoption of advanced techniques; and the improvement of
 administration and management.  Such efforts to develop production and maintain.for-
 ward momentum by carrying out continual and sustained transformation of existing
 industry is what we mean by placing the emphasis on technical transformation and
 internal improvement rather than on new construction and external growth.  Why is
 it that many foreign countries have proceeded in this manner?  First, such improve-
 ment is not only cheaper and faster than new construction; it can also allow for a
 more effective use of the existing base; second, because improvement is contin-
 uous and technology accumulates easily; third, because such improvement is meant to
 meet relatively short-term needs, one can keepa clear view of the situation;

 trnrllh i l I ry ntudian ahuuld bo rulati.valy simply and it Should also be easier to
 mai-agt+ the economy in a rational manner; fourth, even though there may be mistakes
 in the plans for improvement, errors can be corrected easily and actual losses
 should be small.  In short, this scientific economic approach derives solely from
 the realities of the situation.
 There are many factual examples:  for the past few years the number of machine tools
 in the advanced industrial nations has not increased greatly, and in some cases
 has even decreased; production, however, has still continually increased.  For
 example, in America before 1960 there existed a steady proportional relationship
 between the growth in the number of machine tools and the increase in production.
 After that date production increased at a rate of 20 percent every 5 years.  In
 1978, however, the number of machine tools had declined by 14 percent compared with
 1973.  At the same time, however, the number of numerically-controlled machine tools
 and processing centers doubled; production lines increased by 20 percent and over-
 all production during this period went up 20 percent. In  Japan the situation was
 very similar.   Between 1967 and 1973 the number of machine tools increased by a
 little over 20 percent, while the actual output value quadrupled. This shows that
 the forces and level of production do not depend on a numerical increase in equip-
 ment and enterprises but rather on qualitative improvement.  Comrades who return
 home after studying this problem abroad all say that in the industrially developed
 nations it is not at all uncommon for old factories to be producing goods which can
 still compete on the international market.  On one occasion a general engineer
 visited a steel-rolling mill in a Western country; the manager pointed to a steel-
 rolling machine and said, this machine dates from the,1950's but it is still more
 efficient than new machines because of continuous technical improvement.  He also
 expressed deep regret over the fact that our factories are only used and never im-
 proved.  In'Japanese industrial circles it is often said that, "the process by which
 an enterprise continually develops and prospers is a process of continual techni-
 cal improvement."  Although Japan's social system is different from our own, this
 statement holds true for our country as well, and deserves serious thought.
 For the past 10 or more years capital construction has been the centre of efforts
 to increase productive forces.  For a number of reasons, the.problem of duplicate
 construction is a very serious one, and the utilization. rate of equipment is very
 low, which results in a wastage of manpower, materials, financial resources. and time.
 In the heavy industrial sector, our country has more heavy machine plants than any
 other country in the world; furthermore, many of these plants rank among the world's
 largest.  However, there are also many factories which even after many years in
 operation have still not reached full capacity.  Take the case of our country's
 hydraulic presses for example:  While we have more such presses than Japan, Western
 nations' orders for forgings of several hundred tons or more are always placed with
 Japanese factories.  What is more, we are often unable to produce forging of over
 10 tons for ourselves, and many of our hydraulic presses lie idle.  If a general
 survey were carried out of the whole country's economic results, people would be
 shocked by the number of examples of such waste.
 Once a capital construction project has been put into operation, why is not it pos-
 sible to quickly bring the productive forces into full play?  The most basic reason
 for this is that while we have a system of capital construction we have no system
 for the transformation of production techniques.  There are numerous financial

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 channels designed to asgistcapital construction projects; however, when it comes to
 the funding of technical improvements, not a single channel exists.  Thereforelta
 newly-built factory is expected to be a sort of "money tree" which only has to be
 shaken to produce and needs neither pruning, weeding, watering, or. fertilizing.
 The result of this is that its effectiveness decreases daily and it gradually withers
 away.  The classic example of this was during the 1960's, when we imported a com-
 plete factory to produce hydraulic equipment from Japan.  The factory was in every
 way the same as factories of the same class in-Japan at that time. After 10 years,
 however, the factories in Japan had increased their output 6 times and were already
 producing the 3d generation of their product.  In our country, on the other hand,
 things were still the same as they were 10 years before, and in some areas produc-
 tion had even deteriorated.
 The introduction of technical improvement into our existing economic base not only
 increases productive forces at a faster rate; it is also cheaper and relatively
 profitable.  Under the present circumstances, it is very common for people to think
 that because capital construction demands large amounts of money, it should be in-
 cluded in our economic plan; technical improvement, on the other hand, is merely a
 question of accounting and cannot be included in the general plan.  Such an approach
 is entirely mistaken.
 The implementation of overall technical transformation of our national economy is,
 of course, a very large project.  An optimistic estimate would be that it will be
 difficult to complete the task in less than 10 to 15 years.  For this reason it
 must be carried out in stages.  We must first of all gain experience by transforming
 those enterprises that produce products very important to the development of the
 national economy.  Such transformation must be based on a scientific foundation and
 should also accord with economic and technical reality.   The results of such a
 transformation should be the development of our country's productive capacity, the
 raising of the technological level, the increasing of the economy's efficiency and
 the creation of greater accumulation for the state.  Products of which there is a
 domestic shortage should certainly be considered as targets for technical improve-
 ment.  We will need to reduce imports and increase exports and also to increase the
 quality of domestically increased products.  For example, the supply of products
 such as bicycles and sewing machines is unable to meet demand.  We should investi-
 gate whether or not it is possible to use the whole country's machine-building
 capacity to carry out technical improvement in these factories (for decades most of
 our nation's industrial investment has been used to increase our productive capacity
 for primary products, and very little investment has been used to increase our pro-
 ductive capacity for secondary products.  As a result there are many light industrial
 factories where not only is the equipment antiquated and techniques backward, but
 even the working environment is substandard.  Technical transformation should cer-
 tainly he carried out in such factories.)  In addition to technical improvement we
 should also implement the system of socialist cooperation and division of labor.
 The organization of several large groups each producing from 5 to 10 million
 bicycles would strengthen the development of each smaller unit.  As for reducing
 imports and increasing exports, the reform of several factories will not only in-
 crease foreign exchange revenue but will simultaneously reduce foreign exchange
 expenditure.  According to statistics, during the last 3 years we have imported
 more than 4 million tons of steel plate at a cost of $2.2 billion. Naturally,
 such imports cannot be continued for a long period of time, and we should make a

 determined effort to use a portion of this expenditure to carry out improvements in
 one of our steel-rolling mills.  Such an approach would certainly-benefit the state.
 The conservation of energy is another area where money can be saved.  Our country
 has many inefficient boilers; but if we were to spend money on reconditioning them
 we,would be able to save 1 ton of coal for every 60 yuan invested.  If, on the other
 hand, we wanted to increase the production capacity of coal by 1 ton, it would
 require an investment of around 200 yuan.  A.comparison of these two cases clearly
 demonstrates how worthwhile technical improvement is.  There are many other such
 examples.  In sum, it can be said that no matter whether we look at technical improve-
 ment from a macroeconomic point of view, from a long-term point of view or from the
 point of view of the cause-and-effect relationship that exists between the economy
 and financial revenue, we can feel equally confident.  Some leading comrades now
 insist that we should study the way in which money is made, accumulated and used.
 In a society there exist numerous sources of funds; financial allocation is not
 necessarily the only way of finding the funds necessary for technical improvements;
 economic methods can also be used and may even yield better results.
 4.  The Role of. the Machine-Building Industry in the Technical Transformation of the
 National Economy
 A leading comrade once said that, "the machine-building industry is the national
 economy's equipment section."  It was said in the past that, "the machine-building
 industry is the heart of industrialization"  No matter which phrase we choose to
 use, both emphasise the crucial role to be played by the machine-building industry in
 the technical transformation of the.national economy.
 There are, at present, two incorrect views of the machine.-building industry.  One of
 these views underestimates both its capacity and level, and seems to suggest that
 since nothing is any good we should even start importing products which we have been
 producing domestically for decades.  In actual fact, in our existing technical and
 economic base over 80 percent of the equipment was domestically produced.  Why is
 it that such things were good enough in the past but now simply won't do?!  Certain-
 ly, domestically-produced equipment has certain shortcomings compared with equip-
 ment produced in the advanced industrial nations:  it does not form complete sets,
 its reliability and durability are sometimes deficient, and the service is often
 poor.  Some of these problems are scientific and technical, others are managerial,
 while others are problems of materials.  All of these problems must be carefully
 solved.  However, there exists another more important problem, which is that. the
 state must have a policy that protects and supports its own industry.   If this is
 not the case it is impossible to talk of self-reliance; and the loss of self-reliance
 would certainly influence the progress of the four modernizations.
 The other view is that the machine-building industry is too big.  Therefore, as
 soon as any mention is made of readjusting this industry, the problem is always
 seen in terms of drastic cuts, closures; suspensions, amalgamations and conversions.
 Such a view pays too much attention to quantity and not enough to quality.   There
 are'also people who say, quite correctly, that our machine-building industry is too
 bloated. With about 3.8 million machine tools, our country ranks second in the
 world in terms of the number of machines.  However, if this is analyzed a little
 more closely it can be seen that of these machine tools over 100,000 date from
 before the revolution; another 100,000 were imported during the 1950's; another
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100190001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 800,000 are machines that were produced before "the great leap forward;" and during
 the great leap forward itself about 1 million machine tools were produced.  Of the
 products dating from the "great leap forward" and the "cultural revolution," many
 were manufactured in a shoddy and slipshod way and their quality is often below
 standard; as a result many such machines, lying idle in factories, have become a
 real burden.  There are probably only about 900,000 relatively standard machine
 tools divided among 170,000 different factories.  Some 100,000 of these machines
 are run by people's communes, and the remainder belong to more than 1,500 small
 and medium enterprises.  It is thought that  key enterprises account for only about
 600 of these enterprises.  This means that there are probably no more than about
 1,000 enterprises that will be able to play a positive role in the future.
 About half of these 900,000 standard machine tools have already exceeded their
 service life.  In one machine-building complex, most of the equipment is already
 more than 20 years old; in another one 70 percent of the equipment  is more than
 20 years old; there is even one enterprise in which 80 percent of the machinetools
 are over 25 years old.  Abroad, the depreciation period for equipment is usually
 about 5  to 10 years; in our country it is 30 years.  For these reasons our machine
 tools need constant repair; some have been overhauled up to 10 times.  It should be
 pointed out that after a machine tool has been overhauled it is only possible to
 restore 96 percent of its original precision; after a. second overhaul another 6 per-
 cent is lost; after a third time another 15 percent is lost, and by the time a ma-
 chine tool has been overhauled fora fourth time, only 60 percent of its original
 precision rating remains.  In actual fact, once a piece of equipment has been.over-
 hauled three times, not only does its level of precision decline, but the amount
 of money spent on repairs begins to exceed its original net value.   The fact that
 our country's equipment  has such a long depreciation period means, in reality,
 that there exists no system for the renewal of equipment, and much of our equipment
 is already-old and inefficient.  If, as well as being unable to produce precision
 products, we continue to use this substandard equipment  to produce generation
 after generation of equipment;,  the standard will certainly get lower and lower.
 Low productivity, high cost and low utilization rate of materials also all flow from
 this same problem. For this reason the machine-building industry itself also has
 a serious problem with technical improvement.
 Should we first transform the machine-building industry, and only when this is ac-
 complished, set about reforming other sectors; or should we adopt a proportional
 approach and try to improve.each industry a little?  Neither of these methods seems
 to be particularly appropriate, for the following reasons:  First, the existing
 productive capacity of the machine-building industry needs to be brought into full
 play; secondly, there needs to be a demand for machine products; thirdly, most of
 the capital needed to carry out technical improvement in the machine-building in-
 dustry should come from that industry itself.  Therefore, the introduction of tech-
 nical improvement into this industry must depend on the-technical transformation of
 other industries; that is to say, the machine-building industry should serve other
 industries in a practical and realistic manner.  Through the process of helping
 other sectors to carry out changes, the machine-building industry itself will also
 naturally achieve a degree of technical improvement.  This is not a before-and-
 after relationship, but a relationship of dialectical development.  In Japan the
 machine-building industry was at the centre of their development plan.  First of
 all, 10 or so products were chosen as targets for technical improvement; the object

 of this wan  to incrrnar oxport  and rrduco imports with A viow to Improving t-ho
 foreign exchange balance.  Our objectives are not entirely the same; and our economic
 relations are also different.  The machine-building industry will act as both the
 equipment section and the technical reform section for the overall technical trans-
 formation of the national economy.  For this reason, only when we have taken the
 transformation of the whole national economy as our starting-point can we then decide
 the order and process of transformation.in the machine-building industry.
 5.  Several Questions That Should Be Answered Before Technical Transformation Is
 Carried Out
 (1) The technical transformation of the national economy is an extremely complicated
 and painstaking task; it will require a unified plan, constant reappraisal and scien-
 tific verification.  The leadership and command system which carried out Japan's
 machine-building industry restoration was more unitary block than our country's.
 Each of our country's industrial sectors has its own sphere of control, and the
 scope of our national economy's technical transformation is far wider than it was in
 Japan; for these reasons the task is much more difficult than it was in Japan.  With-
 out strong and powerful organization and leadership and without a unified plan,
 nothing can be accomplished.   The formulation of a realistic and feasible plan for
 technical transformation will require the participation of a great number of experts.
 Problems such as what should be improved and what should be improved first should
 be subjected to repeated scientific analysis.
 (2) The overall technical transformation of the national economy is a major stra-
 tegic decision.  As with the construction of 156 major projects in the first 5-year
 plan, no effort should be spared.  Moreover, compared with the period of the first
 5-year plan, we have many more methods today.  If the state wants to meet some of
 the problems involved in technical transformation by introducing various items of
 legislation, such measures must first be passed by the permanent organs of the NPC,
 which have absolute authority, and only then will legislation be legally binding.
 In this way a unified understanding can be reached and affairs can be managed
 according to law.
 (3) The phrase "technical transformation" should be understood in a broad sense.
 It refers to both the improvement of material conditions and also the readjustment
 and reform of organization and management.  Because of this, when we carry out tech-
 nical transformation it will be necessary, on the one hand, to. reform any irrational
 parts of the superstructure and, on the other hand, to break away from the limita-
 tions of the different forms of ownership.              The implementation of this plan and
 the carrying out of reorganization should be relatively centralized.  Otherwise,
 we will end up expending a lot of effort for small results because none of the dif-
 ferent channels link up; and this opportunity for reform could end by merely exacer-
 bating the phenomenon of a divided system with numerous large and small independent
 units.
 (4) The state should have a policy of supporting those enterprises in which tech-
 nical transformation is being carried out.  Depending on the particular circum-
 stances of each enterprise, the government should make special provision:- for loans
 and taxation.
 In short, this is a major  undertaking that requires full cooperation in all areas,
 as well as joint study and investigation.

 REPORT  ON FIRST ECONOMIC SCIENCE MEETING
 HK211242 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 15 Oct 81 p 5
 [Academic trend report by Jiang Yingguang [5592 2503 0342]:  "China Federation of Economic
 Science Organizations Holds First Meeting"]
 [Text]  From 3 to 9 September, the China Federation of Economics Organizations held its
 This federation is a mass academic organization made up of economics societies, research
 institutes and associations at the national, provincial, municipal and autonomous regional
 levels.  It was established in March this year and it has 226 member organizations.  The
 main topic for discussion at the meeting was the development of the science of economics
 in order to better serve the socialist modernization.
 Participants at the meeting held:  Much development has been made in the research on the
 science of economics since the founding of the PRC.  Particularly after the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the broad masses of theoretical economic
 workers and economic workers inspired-by the party's spirit of emancipating the mind,
 using the brain and seeking truth from facts, have carried out investigations and studies
 on new situations and new problems in readjusting, restructuring, rectifying and improving
 the national economy.  They have put forth various ideas and suggestions for reforming the
 economic system and readjusting the economic structure, participated in different ways in
 the government's work of making economic decisions and have promoted and developed the
 science of economics.  They have played their part in pushing the socialist modernization
 forward.  During this period, branches of the science of.economics which had a relatively
 better foundation have developed to varying degrees.  Some new branches of the science of
 economics have emcrged.  Various organizations related to the science of economics,
 including research institutes, associations and societies and various kinds of theoretical
 economics periodicals have sprung up like mushrooms.  Academic intercourse with foreign
 countries has also continuously developed.
 The participants held:   At present, the socialist construction has posed many complicated
 problems for the science of economics.  Under these circumstances, comrades in the economics
 circles should rouse themselves, strive to develop the science of economics and. better serve
 the socialist modernization.  The participants also held that the science of economics is
 a science with a wide scope and many branches and it has many problems which need study.
 At present, we should, in the light of the situation of our country's socialist moderniza-
 tion, strengthen the study of those various branches of the science of economics which
 relate to ownership structures and economic management systems at the present stage of
 socialism, strengthen the study of various branches of the science of economics which
 relate to our country's economic development strategy and strengthen the study of various
 branches of the science of economics which relate to management.  We should strengthen not
 only the study of applied economics but also the  study of the current economic situation

 at home and abroad. The participants stressed that comrades in the economic circles should
 enthusiastically make their contributions to the economic construction during the readjust-
 ment period.  To achieve this, we should carry out further studies on problems such as
 economic readjustment, structural reforms, enterprise rectification, enterprise operation,
 planning and management, rationalization of the national economic structure, making economic
 decisions in a scientific way and economic relations with foreign countries.
 The participants also stressed that in studying the science of economics we should uphold
 the correct orientation of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and seriously implement the
 Marxist principles and policies which are conducive to the development of science.  We
 should strengthen our study, increase the force engaged in theoretical economics, train
 more qualified people in this field and develop various undertakings which serve the science
 of economics.  The meeting proposed a "plan for the work of the China Federation of Economics
 Organizations," and decided to run classes for studying the science of economics, publish
 a series of books on basic economic knowledge and a book entitled "General Information on
 China's Socialist Construction," make preparations for publishing ECONOMIC SCIENCE WEEKLY
 and ECONOMICS DIGEST and do a good job in academic exchange, propaganda, popularization
 and improvement of the science of economics.
 Thus, they quickly became well off.  This convincingly shows that both plains and moun-
 tainous areas have broad prospects for developing diversified economies.  This is because:
 first, agricultural production involves seasonal work and since the slack season is rather'
 long in the north, it provides the peasants with enough time to engage in diversified pro-
 duction.  Second, since the implementation of various responsibility systems, the pro-
 ductivity has been raised and more labor has been left idle, thus providing the development'
 of a diversified economy with an important manpower resource.  For example, there are more
 than 30,000 such people in Xinxiang County.  Third, though it is true that on the plains
 there are too many people and limited land, there is great potential.  There are rich
 natural resources on our vast plains, which spread all over the tropical, subtropical,
 temperate and frigid zones, waiting for our exploitation.
 The development of Xinxiang's diversified economy shows that there is no end to the
 exploitation of natural resources.  By constantly tapping new potential's, Xinxiang, which
 was'already advanced in production, has gained the initiative in exploiting and making use
 of'natural resources.

 YU GUANGYUAN ARTICLE ON ECONOMIC SCIENCE
 HK261453 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 15 Oct 81 p 5
 [Article by Yu Guangyuan [0060 0342 66781:  "Develop Economic Science To Better Serve
 Socialist Modernization -- Report Delivered on 3 September at the First Annual Meeting of
 the China Federation of Economic Science Organizations" -- capitalized passages published
 in boldface]
 [Text]  We economists must bestir ourselves and strive to develop economic science to
 better serve socialist modernization.
 FIRST, WE MUST UPHOLD MARXISM-LENINISM-MAO ZEDONG THOUGHT.
 Past experiences and lessons tell us that we must persistently take Marxism-Leninism-Mao
 Zedong Thought as our guide if we want to make our research in economic theory yield results
 in socialist modernization.  The basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought are
 our guide to research in economic science.  We must not only systematically study writings
 by Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong, but must really understand and master them.
 This is especially true with books like "Das Kapital."  Otherwise our study and research
 will go astray.  Insisting on studying their writings does not mean we are not going to
 further develop our economic science.  Comrade Mao Zedong once said something like this:
 Communists and proletarian thinkers of every nation must create new theories, write new
 books and produce their own theorists.  At no time will it be adequate just to rely on old
 things altogether.  Proceeding from reality in doing everything is the living soul of
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  We must put dialectical and historical materialism
 into application, end the state of ossification and semi-ossification of thinking, com-
 pletely and thoroughly emancipate ourselves from the shackles of dogmatism and conscien-
 tiously study the objective course of socialist economic movements and developments.  In
 particular, we must hammer out, from the tortuous course we traversed, specific forms in
 which socialist economic laws operate in our country, and, on the basis of summing up prac-
 tical experiences in China and in other countries, establish a system of socialist economic
 science and better serve socialist modernization.  Bourgeois economics is essentially in
 the service of the capitalist system.  We cannot accept its vulgar and unscientific notions.
 Neither can we accept ideas which do not conform with our system.  Of course, there is no
 denying that it also deals with all kinds of socialized mass production and certain regular
 patterns of the commodity economy., and these deserve proper attention.  We must pay close
 attention to past and present research in economic theories in other countries and criti-
 cally assimilate what is useful in the light of our national condition.
 SECOND, WE MUST CONSCIENTIOUSLY IMPLEMENT THE MARXIST GUIDING PRINCIPLE AND POLICIES ON
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE.
 "Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is the funda-
 mental policy for bringing about a flourishing socialist culture and for promoting the
 development of economic science.

 After taking into account the objective fact that all kinds of contradictions still existed
 in a socialist society and also our country's pressing demand for rapid economic and
 cultural developments, Comrade Mao Zedong put forth the "double hundred" policy in 1956.
 However, this policy was not properly implemented due to interference from the "left" and
 from the right. Since the downfall of the "gang of four," especially since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, a nationwide ideological emancipation movement
 has been going on and a lively situation of "a hundred flowers all blossoming and a hundred
 schools of thought all contending at the same time" has emerged.-This provides a
 favorable atmosphere for the flourishing and development of economic science. In order to
 develop economic science, it is also necessary to intensify the movement to emancipate the
 mind.  Without emancipating the mind, we will not be able to properly analyze the new
 circumstances, study the new questions, voice our opinions, including constructive
 suggestions and criticisms, and work out good solutions.  We should have the necessary
 theories and courage to actively probe into new problems, particularly matters of overall
 importance which have a direct bearing on the fundamental interests of the party and the
 state. Without independent thinking and free discussions, it is impossible to push
 scientific research forward.  The correctness or incorrectness of people's views can only
 be judged through discussion and practice.  The purpose of unfolding criticism and self-
 criticism in the academic field is to carry out truly free discussions so that everyone
 can state their owri views and make criticism and countercriticism. Unfolding truly free
 discussions is altogether different from bourgeois liberalism and it is impermissible
 to speak of them in the same breath.  We must guard against bourgeois liberalism and
 sternly criticize such inclinations.  Bourgeois liberalism and leftist trends of thought
 are obstacles to the unfolding of truly free discussions and must be eliminated. Unfold-
 ing criticism and self-criticism, maintaining close ties with the masses and integrating
 theory with practice are fine work styles of our party.  They are at one with each other.
 Most erroneous ideas originate from our failure to immerse ourselves with the masses, go
 deep into the realities of life and integrate theory with practice.  Therefore, we
 economic theorists must attach importance to theoretical work and conscientiously apply
 ourselves to study.  At the same time, we must pay attention to practice and strengthen
 investigation and study. Only in this way can we represent the interests of the masses,
 proceed from reality in doing everything, uphold the truth and rectify mistakes.  Under
 the erroneous influence of "leftist" ideas, we have always resorted to political movements
 to resolve ideological problems.  This gave some comrades the false impression that it
 was necessary to launch a movement in order to unfold criticism. Criticism means dis-
 cussion; it means analyzing different points of view and debating on them.  We should see
 that after years of tutelage and education by our party, we now have a large number of
 economic theorists.  They are valuable assets for socialist modernization and are a
 force upon which our party relies. In scientific research, differing viewpoints are
 mostly questions of understanding.  The issue is whether or not something conforms with
 objective reality, and this can only be resolved. through social practice. The Resolu-
 tion on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC
 points out: "We must correctly understand that there are diverse social contradictions
 in Chinese society which do not fall within the scope of class struggle and that methods
 other than class struggle must be used for their appropriate resolution." Upholding the
 four fundamental principles is in keeping with "letting a hundred schools of thought
 contend."  In order to "let a hundred schools of thought contend" and ensure the normal
 practice of criticism and self-criticism, we must not handle differing and even
 erroneous viewpoints in academic research in an oversimplified and crude way.  In
 particular, we must oppose the practice of resorting to administrative means to back up
 one academic viewpoint and repudiate another.  This is an important point we have learned
 in implementing the "double hundred" policy over the past two decades and more. Of
 course, words and deeds that would undermine socialist construction are something
 different.  Toward them, we must wage necessary struggles.
 Integrating theory with practice is a fine tradition of our party; it is also a fundamental
 principle for the development of economic. science.  Since the downfall of the "gang of four,"
 especially since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, this principle
 has been upheld by our economists.  This has played a remarkable role both in raising the
 theoretical level and in giving impetus to practice.  However, we should still pay attention
 to rectifying theoretical research which is divorced from reality.   Tasks of economic
 research should originate from practice.  An economic theorist must pay attention to
 investigation, take socialist modernization as his classroon,'be bold in practice,
 constantly study new circumstances and solve new problems, truly adhere to the realistic

 anapractical principle of "believe only in facts, not in what your superiors have told you
 or in books" put forth by Comrade Chen Yun back in the Yanan days and cultivate the scienti-
 fic approach of proceeding from reality in doing everything.  Of course, while paying
 attention to overcoming the tendency for theory to become divorced from reality, we must
 also pay attention to overcoming the tendency to slight theoretical work.  The  Resolution
 on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC points out:
 One  of the  social and historical causes underlying the "Great Cultural Revolution" which
 dragged on for as long as a decade was that our party "was not fully prepared, either
 ideologically or in terms of scientific study, for the swift advent of the newly born
 socialist society and for socialist construction on a national scale."  For this reason,
 the resolution emphasizes that "it is imperative for the whole party to engage in a more
 diligent study of Marxist theories, of the past and present in China and abroad, and of
 the different branches' of the natural and social sciences."  In this regard, it is of
 particularly great significance to strengthen research in economic theory.
 THIRD, WE MUST EXPAND AND RAISE THE STANDARDS OF THE PRESENT CONTINGENT OF ECONOMIC
 SCIENTISTS AND TRAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED ECONOMIC SCIENTISTS IF WE WANT TO
 FURTHER DEVELOP ECONOMIC SCIENCE.
 Our contingent of economic scientists has expanded considerably in recent years.  However,
 it still falls short of the arduous tasks of socialist modernization we have before us.
 This contingent is not only too small in number, but is not up to the mark qualitatively
 speaking.  For example, in terms of the fields of study, most people are engaged in
 theoretical research in general political economics and very few are engaged in other
 disciplines.  Many bourgeoning and frontier branches of learning are in a state of
 blankness and there are gaps to be filled.  Most economic scientists have a limited scope
 of knowledge.  They know very little about Chinese history, Chinese society, various aspects
 of production, practical knowledge such as advanced mathematics, modern science and techno-
 logy and modern economics, even the new progress being made in other countries in research
 in their respective branches of learning. They also have a relatively low level of foreign
 language training.  Therefore, we must strengthen and raise the standards of the present
 contingent of economic scientists in order to meet the demands of socialist modernization.
 This is a very pressing task.  Our federation of economic science organizations should play
 its proper role in this regard. We must make every effort to train and bring up new forces.
 We must tailor the teaching of economics in such a way as to suit the needs of socialist
 modernization.  To this end, it is necessary to reform the pedagogical structure and
 curricular setup of economics and help the economics students broaden their scope of
 knowledge.  In this way, we will be able to provide economics research and teaching and
 also the economic departments with more professional men of a high caliber.
 In conducting research in economic science, it is not only necessary to divide the work
 but also to strengthen the links between various branches of learning. If we all stay in
 our own small world and do not communicate, we will not be able to reach an understanding
 on many questions.  In addition, we must also have an overall idea of and planning for the
 development of economics in the whole country, including planning for each locality.  Our
 federation of economic science organizations can also do something useful in this regard.
 FOURTH, WE MUST DEVELOP VARIOUS ECONOMIC SCIENCE SERVICES.
 The development of the service trades is an outcome of contemporary social development.
 Services in the field of science (economic science included) constitute an important aspect
 of the service trades.  In addition to our own research tasks, we economic scientists should
 also strive to provide good scientific services and serve socialist modernization with
 scientific conclusions, scientific knowledge, scientific information and scientific methods.
 For example, we can help ascertain the effects of economic policies, provide economic
 information, data and counseling, train economic management personnel, put forth plans
 and proposals for rationalization, provide scientific arguments and evidence for various
 technical measures and construction projects, and so on.
 It is one of our important tasks under the new historical conditions to popularize the
 knowledge of economic science in the course of socialist construction.  Only by helping more

 XINHUA ON INTEGRATION OF SCIENCE, PRODUCTION
 OW260255 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0706 GMT 24 Nov 81
 (Commentary by unidentified XINHUA reporter:  "The Integration of Scientific Research and
 Production Is Imperative"]
 [Excerpts)  Beijing, 24 Nov (XINHUA) -- From the State Scientific and Technological
 Commission and'the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the various research institutes, the
 people have recently been enthusiastically discussing a question:  How can science and
 technology be transformed as quickly as possible into productive forces to enable the
 national economy to develop at a greater speed?
 The occurrence and development of science are linked with production right from the start.
 When production develops to a certain stage, it inevitably places new demands on science
 and technology.  Once science and technology make a new breakthrough and apply their
 achievement to production, a leap in production takes place.  It was in this way that the
 history of mankind's development of production was proved.  However, not everyone is
 paying attention to carrying out such an obvious and easy-to-understand truth in practice.
 Therefore, it is necessary to demand that comrades who are leaders in production should
 .attach importance to the application of new achivements in science and technology and ask
 for output and quality from science and technology.  Comrades who are leaders in scientific
 and technological work should attach importance to the popularization of scientific and
 technological achievements in production and ask for scientific research projects from the
 production side.
 Recently, the State Scientific and Technological Commission has collected many practical
 examples eloquently explaining the power of new new scientific and technological achieve -
 ments in promoting the development of production.
 The comrades in economic departments might say that new technology is certainly good but
 it cannot be applied to their production because the channel between scientific research
 and production is now impassable.  The comrades in scientific and technological departments
 maintain that in order to bring a scientific and technological achievement from the labora-
 tory to production, there is a series of technical and economic problems to be solved;
 however, the scientific and technological departments are incapable of solving these
 problems.  A scientific and technological achievement must be taken over by the production
 department for a continuous intermediary test before it can be transferred from the labora-
 tory to the plant, the rural area or the mine, or even to the various production fronts.
 However, for a long time, precisely because of the absence of an intermediary bridge, most
 of the achievements have remained samples, exhibits or presents, and have been buried year
 after year.
 Regarding this problem, the party Central Committee's policy is that except for a small
 amount of basic research, applied scientific research should systematically be more closely
 integrated with production and should gradually break through departmental and regional
 limits.  It is necessary to study the reform of the systems from the angle of the integra-
 tion of scientific research organizations with production.

 To build the bridge of integration between scientific research and production, we must
 depend on the joint efforts of both the scientific research departments and the production
 departments.  If only leading departments at all levels work in accordance with the party
 Central Committee's policy, do away with the ideology of sticking to old ways, positively
 make the channels between scientific research and production passable, study the concrete
 policies and measures of encouraging-the production departments to adopt new technology
 and new achievements and do something in a down-to-earth way, we will be able to gradually
 transfer advanced scientific and technological achievements from the laboratory to the
 plant, the rural area and the various departments in the national economy.  If we act in
 this way, the national eco,...my will develop at a greater speed like a winged tiger,
 enabling an earlier realization of socialist modernization.

 EXCERPTS FROM ZHAO ZIYANG GOVERNMENT WORK REPORT
 OW140138 Beijing XINHUA in English 0103 GMT 14 Dec 81
 [Excerpts]  9.  Raise the scientific and cultural level of all working people,
 and organize strong forces to tackle key scientific research projects.  We must
 train large numbers of specialists of all grades in all lines and.large numbers
 of competent workers for our modernization programme.  This is of paramount
 importance.  China is still. rather backward in education and science, whose
 development thus lags behind that of the various sectors of the economy.  Unless
 we solve this problem, we shall fail in our drive for modernization.
 Our basic policy for scientific and technological development is equally clear-cut.  Science
 and technology, with their numerous brancl':s, should serve all aspects of-human life.
 There  must be no weakening of basic research, but the stress in the development of science
 and technology as a whole should be on serving economic construction and, in particular,
 on the solution of key problems in the, economy involving major economic benefits.  Our
 present task is to employ science and technology more efficiently so that they will be
 a powerful productive force, a great stimulus to economic development.
 To place science and technology fully at the service of the economy, it is now most necessary
 to apply and spread the results we have obtained in scientific and technological research.
 In recent years, we have accomplished much in such research and also imported a good
 deal of advanced technology. Drawing on these assets and making wider use of them can
 yield enormous results if we do it in .time. We should strive to apply the results of
 scientific and technological research in laboratories to production, apply those gained
 in the national defence industry to production for both defence and civilian purposes,
 and apply those gained in the coastal areas to production in the hinterland, as well as
 assimilate foreign experience for use in China.   In the past year or so, several research
 and designing institutions have organized various forms of association with production units,
 and owrked out new methods and systems, such-as the contracting system, compensated transfers
 of technology, technical services, output-related responsibility in agro-technical service,
 and advisory agro-technical contracts.  All this has helped research and designing instiutions
 to be directly oriented towards production; and to cater to the needs of increasing
 production; at the same time, it has provided a motive for the popularization of science
 and technology.  It is thus highly beneficial to the development of the. economy and of
 science and technology themselves.
 Generally speaking, our science and technology are still rather backward, but they are by
 no means backward in every respect.  For in certain fields we have already attained a
 fairly high level and a considerable scale in terms .of size of research staff, experi-
 mental facilities, and.results of research. We should in no case underestimate ourselves.

 To meet the fairly long-term needs of our developing economy, it is now necessary to set
 before all leading scientific and technological departments, all research institutions and
 all scientific and technological personnel the task of tackling key problems in science
 and technology by pooling their efforts and strengthening their cooperation.  After repeated
 studies and confirmation by the departments and specialists concerned, we will select
 ?a number of research projects of major national economic significance and organize the
 efforts of all concerned to effect a breakthrou h.
 These projects include techniques tor increasing tarm yields such as seed and soil
 improvement, water and soil conservation, plant protection and manufacture of new
 varieties of farm chemicals; techniques of foodstuff storage and processing, and of
 keeping it fresh for a long time; finishing techniques for textiles; techniques for the
 conservation and better utilization of energy; techniques for the multi-purpose use
 of coal and petroleum; techniques for the comprehensive exploitation and utilization of
 nonferrous metals; and research on new materials, new technologies, new equipment and
 new products which are of key importance to China's economic growth.  Work on the above
 projects is important and necessary for the accelerated development of our national
 economy.  We hope that all concerned will give it adequate attention.  Our achievements
 in science and technology are already at the point where we can conquer a number of
 difficult scientific problems.  We are convinced that our scientific and technological
 personnel have both the will and the ability to make a breakthrough in these major projects.

 ECONOMIST ON RENEWAL OF EXISTING INDUSTRIES
 HK120250 Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 12 Dec 81 p 1
 [By staff reporter Zhang Ciyun]
 [Text]  China's plans to shift more funds from capital investment to the renewal of
 existing industrial enterprises in the next 10 years is the only way to make the economic
 readjustment and modernization program a success, in the view of Sun Yefang, a noted
 economist and member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
 In an interview with CHINA DAILY, Sun said, "I greatly appreciate the 10 principles for
 economic development outlined in Premier Zhao Ziyang's report to the current. people's
 congress, and I'm particularly happy with the? one which calls for making full use of
 existing enterprises through systematic technical transformation."
 He said renewing old enterprises requires less money and brings prompter results than
 building new ones.
 "I have been advocating this policy for almost 20 years, but some economists disagreed
 with me," he said.
 Sun, 74, published an article in 1963 urging the government to stop emphasizing the con-
 struction of new enterprises in developing agricultural and industrial production.  He
 suggested the government use half of its capital investment to renew existing enterprises.
 "Being a poor and undeveloped country, China cannot afford large-scale capital investment.
 It is ridiculous that mills purchased in the latter half of the 19th century and machinery
 imported before national liberation in 1949 are still expected to compete in the world
 market," Sun observed.
 He pointed out that the depreciation rate in China's enterprises is only four per cent
 15 to 20 percent lower than in industrialized countries.
 If China renews its equipment only every 25 or 30 years, hopes of catching up with the
 advanced countries are "only a fond dream," he said.
 He suggests now that the government raise the depreciation rate to at least 10 per cent
 "although I am well aware that this means a reduction of almost 20 billion yuan from the
 annual state income and the Financial'Ministry won't be happy about it."
 "This is the only right and practical way to complete the current economic readjustment
 and turn China into a modern, prosperous country by the year 2000," he said.

 "If heavy industry can shift its focus to the renewal of the more than 400,000 existing
 enterprises in this country, it could find a vast field for further development and its
 production could be rapidly increased," he asserted.
 Referring to figures cited in Premier Zhao's report, Sun noted that while China's agriculture
 is enjoying more good harvests and light industrial production has increased by more than 10
 percent this year, heavy industrial production has dropped.
 As a result, the nation's total agricultural and industrial production rose only 4 per cent
 this year, well below the average yearly increases of ]8 percent during the first5 year
 plan (1953-58) and 17.9 per cent during the nation's first 3 year economic readjustment
 just before the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-76).
 Sun said that in the last 2 years, many heavy industrial enterprises have been idled;
 the sector is now suffering a depression as the result of the nationwide economic
 readjustment.
 "This does not mean that China has overdeveloped its heavy industry, but reveals the fact
 that heavy industry has been slanted to much to meeting the needs of building new projects
 and enterprises," he said.

 II.  Science Policy--Agriculture
 AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
 Beijing ZHONGGUO BAIKE NIANJIAN in Chinese 1980, pp 361-363
 [Excerpts]  Revival and Development of Agricultural Research
 In old China, agricultural science research work was extremely weak.  Following
 Liberation, six large regional agricultural science institutes were set up in the
 northeast, north China, east China, south China, the northwest, and the southwest.
 Provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) and regions (leagues and
 municipalities) also set up agricultural science institutes or experiment stations.
 In 1.957, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences grew out of the North China
 Institute of Agricultural Sciences.  Subsequent to 1958, some provincial agricul-
 tural sciences institutes were enlarged to become provincial academies of agricul-
 tural sciences.  During the Great Cultural Revolution, as a result of the inter-
 ference and destruction caused by Lin Biao and the "gang of four's" ultra-leftist
 .Line, some of the institutes of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and
 numerous provincial (municipal, autonomous region), and prefectural (league and
 municipal) agricultural science research organizations were abolished or downgraded,
 and research work in agricultural sciences was seriously crippled.
 Following the smashing of the "gang of four," a national science conference was
 convened in 1978; the State Council approved the revival of the Chinese Academy of
 Agricultural Sciences, and research in agricultural sciences was revived and
 developed.  In 1979, the "Decision of the CCP Central Committee on Some Questions
 Concerning the Acceleration of Agricultural Development," which was passed by the
 Fourth Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, placed specific require-
 ments on the development of research work in agricultural work.  The Ministry of
 Agriculture placed strong emphasis on building up the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
 Sciences, requiring that it gradually begin to operate national research centers for
 agriculture and livestock raising.  Also established were such national agricultural
 research organizations as the Chinese Agricultural Engineering Research and Design
 Academy, the Chengdu Methane Gas Institute and the Environmental Protection Scien-
 tific Monitoring Institute.  Each province (municipality and autonomous region)

 revived and established provincial academies of agricultural sciences and prefec-
 tural academies of agricultural sciences.  Some provinces (municipalities and
 autonomous regions), as well as a small number of prefectures also established
 special research units directly subordinate to agricultural' and livestock depart-
 ments.  Some institutions of higher learning also set up laboratories for
 strengthening research work in agricultural sciences.
 By adopting the method of combining specialized teams with the broad masses, research
 work in agricultural sciences launched a wideranging campaign of scientific experi-
 ments in agriculture from which numerous scientific and technical accomplishments
 were derived.  At the National Science Congress in 1978, 243 prizes were awarded for
 major scientific and technical accomplishments in agriculture and livestock raising.
 Thirty of these approached, attained, or exceeded advanced world levels.  For
 example, in the field of agriculture, in 1956 the world's first dwarf superior
 variety of rice, "Aijiao Nante" was bred.  In 1973, an improved xian type hybrid
 rice was grown; and an allooctoploid triticale was propagated using polyploid breed-
 ing methods.  Research in control of saline-alkaline fields brought results that
 laid a scientific foundation for the control of large areas.  Insect pests and
 diseases that cause serious damage to agricultural production such as migratory
 locusts and wheat rust have been substantially brought under control.  In the field
 of animal husbandry, research was launched on improvements in domestic livestock
 and domestic poultry breed, and in artificial insemination techniques using frozen
 semen for domestic livestock.  Research has been successful with numerous safe
 vaccines.  Pernicious epidemic diseases including rinderpest, hog cholera, and
 chicken pest, which were virulent before Liberation have either been brought under
 control or eradicated.   .

 Building an Agricultural Science and Technology Popularization Network
 Agricultural science and technology popularization network is the common way of
 referring to the agricultural science and technology popularization organization.
 It was formed out of the former agricultural technical popularization stations and
 the four level agricultural science experimental network.  It includes all agricul-
 tural science and technology popularization organizations from the central authori-
 ties to the grassroots levels.  At the center, a science and technology populariza-
 tion department has been established within the Science and Technology Bureau of
 the Ministry of Agriculture.  In provincial and prefectural agricultural bureaus,
 agricultural science and technology popularization stations have been established
 or else are administered by appropriate units within agriculturkl bureaus.   In the
 counties, either agricultural science and technology popularization offices or
 agricultural science and technology popularization stations have been established.
 People's communes have agricultural science and technology popularization stations;
 production teams have set up either agricultural science and technology teams or
 agricultural technicians.  Agricultural science and technology popularization
 organizations at all echelons at or above the county are subordinate to the national
 institution.  Some of the commune agricultural science and technology popularization
 stations are subordinate to the national institution, and some are subordinate to
 collective units.  Production brigade and production team agricultural science and
 technology teams are mass scientific and technical organizations.

 The agricultural science and technology popularization network is a link and a
 bridge for the application to agricultural production of agricultural research
 accomplishments and advanced techniques; it is the key link in giving play to the
 productivity role of science and technology.  Its principal tasks are: adaptation
 of general methods to local situations for the popularization of advanced techniques
 in agricultural production, all around implementation of the "Eight-Point-Charter
 for Agriculture", and implementation of scientific farming.  Below the county level,
 it performs experiments and demonstrates, promotes and gives technical training.  It
 firmly follows the direction which serves present and local agricultural production
 and holds to a policy at which popularization is the center.  It upholds all.prin-
 ciples and all model demonstration methods that have undergone testing.  It
 organically combines experimentation, demonstrations, training, and popularization
 work, gains experience through experimentation, derives models through demonstra-
 tions, develops backbone technical cadre through training, and achieves the goal of
 increased output and increased insome through the popularization of applications to
 production.
 In the course of their work, agricultural scientific and technical popularization
 organizations give attention to close coordination with research units, and agri-
 cultural institutions of higher learning, actively promote their scientific and
 technical accomplishments, and request their assistance in the solution of technical
 problems they may encounter in the process of popularization.

 Revival and bevelopment of Agricultural Institutions of Higher Learning
 Following the smashing of the "gang of four," China's agricultural institutions of
 higher learning made an initial  recovery and moved forward.  In 1979, of 15
 institutions including Beijing, Hebei, Yunnan, and Yilin agricultural universities,
 and Nanjing, Shenyang, Anhui, and Northeast agricultural colleges that had been
 moved, 12 returned to their previous addresses.  Simultaneous with the revival of
 the old schools, the state also approved the founding of an additional 10 schools
 of the Beijing and Laiyang Agricultural College, the Tibetan College of Agriculture
 and Animal Husbandry, the Jinyang, Xichang, and western Henan professional schools
 of agriculture, the Sichuan and Qinghai animal husbandry and veterinary medicine
 colleges, the Zhelimu Academy of Animal Husbandry, and the Zhengzhou Professional
 School of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine.  By the end of 1979, there was
 a total. of 43 agricultural institutions of higher learning (not including state farm
 and land reclamation, farm machinery, and forestry institutions) of which 35 offered
 regular college courses, and 8 offered specialized courses.  In terms of curriculum,
 37 were in agriculture and 5 were in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine; one
 was in sericulture.  There were 360 institutions offering 52 different courses on
 agriculture, pomology, vegetables, livestock, veterinary medicine, agricultural
 mechanization, farmland water conservancy, and forestry.  There were more than
 45,000 students enrolled, 477 researchers, and a staff of more than 28,000 at the
 schools.  The state also revived and authorized as key national institutions of
 higher learning seven institutions, namely, Beijing Agricultural University, and
 Nanjing, Southwest, Northwest, Central China, South China, and Shenyang colleges
 of agriculture, and instituted a dual leadership system comprised of the Ministry
 of Agriculture and concerned provinces and municipalities with the Ministry of Agri-
 culture leadership being paramount.   At the same time, it approved the Shanxi
 Agricultural University,'and Jiangxi Communist Labor University as a major national
 institution of higher learning under the leadership of the province.

 Simultaneous with the revival and development of agricultural institutions of
 higher learning, efforts were made to improve the teaching quality.  By 1979, the
 Ministry of Agriculture had already examined, approved and promulgated plans (trial
 drafts) for the Four specialized schools of agronomy, pomology, animal husbandry
 and veterinary science in agricultural institutes of higher learning, and a draft
 plan for instrument and equipment standards for eight agricultural microbiology
 laboratories.  It had also organized teachers from agricultural institutions of
 higher learning throughout the country to write teaching outlines for 71 courses
 in agronomy, pomology, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and teaching
 materials for 160 courses in 12 fields of agronomy and animal husbandry.  The
 Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Edu-
 cation authorized establishment of [sister] school relationships between the Beijing
 Agricultural University and Minnesota University in the United States, Guelph
 University in Canada, and Hohenheim University in West Germany, between South China
 Agricultural College and Pennsylvania State University in the United States, and
 between Shenyang Agricultural College and Iowa littiversity in the United States.
 They began reciprocal exchanges of specialists, teachers who lecture, exchange of
 data, exchange of students engaged in advanced studies, and cooperative research.
 The Ministry of Agriculture selected more than 50 teachers from agricultural insti-
 tutions of higher learning throughout the country as visiting scholars who went to
 the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Yugoslavia, and Romania for
 study, refresher courses and improvement.  They also commissioned experts and
 teachers from pertinent agricultural schools to conduct 27 refresher courses includ-
 ing basic English, basic Japanese, agricultural chemistry, botany, domestic animal
 environmental sanitation, entomological survey, veterinary clinical diagnosis,
 domestic animal dissection, and histoembryology, farming, and animal biochemistry
 so as to train teachers and increase their level of specialized knowledge.
 (Jiao Ji [3542 1323])
 Training Classes for Agriculture Leadership Cadres
 in 1979, the Ministry of Agriculture entrusted seven agricultural institutions of
 higher learning including Beijing, and Zhejiang agricultural universities, and
 Shenyang, Northwest, Southwest, Central China, and South China agricultural colleges
 to conduct training classes for agricultural cadres.  They trained separately the
 directors and deputy directors of agricultural and livestock bureaus in various
 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions who had not previously studied
 agricultural specialities, the chairman and deputy chairman of agricultural
 academies, and the chairmen and deputy chairmen of agricultural institutions of
 higher learning; prefectural secretaries responsible for agriculture, assistant
 directors, officers in charge of agricultural offices, directors,of agricultural
 and livestock bureaus, county (or banner) CCP Committee secretaries, county heads,
 deputy secretaries in charge of agriculture, and cadres above the department level
 in the Ministry of Agriculture.  Training would be twice each year, each period
 lasting from four to four and one-half months.  Every 4 or 5 years, these cadres
 would be rotated once to training.  Content of instruction was agricultural eco-
 nomics, agricultural programs and policies, agronomy (including plant physiology,
 genetic and breeding, crop cultivation, soil fertility, and plant protection),

 animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and agricultural mechanization.  Depending
 on the different needs'of students, each class might set up elective courses.
 Through training and subsequent work experiences, these leading cadres in agricul-
 tural management would gradually change from greenhorns to insiders versed in their
 Own profession.
 During the last half of 1979, seven training classes were each in session for one
 period.  Participating in the training were department level cadres from offices in
 the Ministry of Agriculture and affiliated units, and leading cadre responsible for
 agricultural work from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, 77
 prefectures (or zhous), and 387 counties (or banners), numbering 514 students in
 all.  Forty-two of the students were cadres from 16 national minorities.  Aside
 from six of the students who were unable to complete the course, all others were
 tested and found to meet requirements and were issued certificates of completion
 for the course work.

 Activities of the Chinese Agriculture Society
 'tile Chinese Agriculture Society is an academic'mass organization organized by
 Chi.na's agricultural scientists and technicians.  It was founded in 1917, and known
 before Liberation as the "China Agriculture Society."'
 The present session's council has 145 council members, 43 standing committee coun-
 cil members, 14 deputy directors, and 1 director, all of them elected by a congress
 of the membership.  This session's director is Yang Xiandong [2799 7359 26391.
 The Chinese Agriculture Society is a combined organization that includes the
 Chinese Crop Society,  the Chinese Horticulture Society, the Chinese Plant Protec-
 tion Society, the Chinese Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Society, the
 Chinese Tea Society, the Chinese Serology Society, the Chinese Tropical Crops
 Society, the Chinese Cotton Society, the Chinese Apiary Society, the Chinese Atomic
 Energy Agricultural Society, the Chinese Agro-Economics Society, the Chinese Grass-
 lands Society, the Chinese Agricultural Engineering Society, and the Chinese Agri-
 cultural Modernization Research Society.  Most provinces, municipalities, and
 autonomous regions have also established agricultural societies.
 Centering on the central problem of how to accelerate the modernization of agricul-
 ture, in 1979 the Chinese Agricultural Society organized the broad masses of
 agricultural scientists and technicians for academic discussions and exchanges.
 Examples were the Northeast Region Agricultural Modernization Academic Discussion
 Meeting, and the Tropical Crops Modernization Academic Discussion Meeting,. and the
 Tropical Crops Modernization Academic Discussion Meeting.  The Chinese Agricultural
 Society has also regularly held academic discussion meetings and report-back meet-
 ings of various kinds or on various-subjects.  It has sent delegations abroad on
 inspection trips, to participate in international academic conferences, to exchange
 academic accomplishments, to increase their academic level, and to examine and
 approve as well as recommend effective technical measures.

 This year the Chinese Agricultural Society turned to the 800 million peasants by
 actively launching agricultural. science popularization work.  It began with the
 Publication of a collection of books titled "A Course of Lectures on Modernized
 Agricultural Science."  In conjunction with the Central People's Broadcasting
 Station, it presented "Special Lectures on Agricultural Modernization Science Knowl-
 edge."            It used newspapers and magazines to publish articles pertaining to agricul-
 tural technology.  It showed science education., films; it set up various slide shows
 in special fields.  It operated training classes in various specialties.
 In 1979, the Chinese Agricultural Society edited and published 17 academic publica-
 tions.  They may be generally divided into two major categories, learned journals and
 magazines.  Learned journals include ZUOWU XUEBAO [Acta Agronomica Sinica], YUANYI

 Widening of Foreign Agricultural Technology Exchange
 In 1979, China's technological cooperation and exchange with foreign countries saw
 further development.   According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of
 Agriculture, a total of more than 420 people in 65 delegations and inspection
 groups were sent abroad during the year, and more than 580 people in 120 visiting

 Development of International Cooperative Relationships in Agricultural Technology
 and Economic Cooperation
 In 1.979, China developed long term cooperative relationships in agricultural' tech-
 nology and economics with numerous countries.  In addition to signing agreements
 for technical cooperation with more than 10 countries, it made technical and eco-
 nomic cooperative arrangements with American, Yugoslavian, West German, French,
 Australian, and New Zealand business firms, and it entered into cooperative experi-
 ment.; and technical exchanges on agricultural chemicals, farm machinery, and seeds
 witli.Iapanese,  British, French and Swiss industrial plants and firms.
 Till!; year China introduced eight sets of agricultural machinery from Japan for
 Iii lot projects at Congzhuling in Jilin, Wuxi in Jiangsu,.Chongming in Shanghai,
 .linhua and Wuxing in Zhejiang, Jinxian in Jiangxi, and Dandu in Anhui.   Plastic
 greenhouses introduced from Japan are being used experimentally at the Sijiqing
 People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing.  A modernized greenhouse introduced
 .from Holland is being tested in the suburbs of Harbin.  Modern livestock farm
 equipment and techniques were introduced from Australia and New Zealand.  Through
 the auspices of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, a complete
 range of seed processing equipment was introduced as well as grain drying equipment
 and remote sensing technical instruments and equipment for soil surveys.  Addi-
 tionally, a demonstration farm with modern facilities is planned for construction
 at the Wengniute Banner in the Nei Monggol Autonomous Region.  More than 4700
 varieties of agricultural crop seeds and nursery stock have been introduced from
 38 countries and international organizations.  From New Zealand and Australia have
 been introduced Romney sheep, and from Korea has been introduced eight different
 quail strains.  From the United States has been imported Nigula [phonetic] white-
 feathered turkeys, and from Japan earthworms to further increase China's breed
 resources.
 Additionally, China has presented 858 seed and nursery stock items for various farm
 crops to 18 countries.  Rice hybrids are being tested in the United States, and
 some of them have yields of from 30 to 40 percent higher than local varieties.

 RELY ON POLICY, SCIENCE TO INCREASE GRAIN PRODUCTION
 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 6 Mar 81 p 2
 [Article by Hou Xueyu [0186 1331 3558], Botany Institute, Chinese Academy of
 Sciences.  "How Should the Problem of Increased Food Output Be Looked At?"]
 [Text]  Solution to the problem of increased grain output
 requires, first of all, establishment of an outlook of
 "grain in a larger sense."  The road to increased output
 lies not in emphasis on increase in the rice,  corn, and
 wheat area and the multiple cropping index, but rather in
 increases in pdr unit yields, and close attention to
 intensive farming.  The basic issue is reliance on policies
 and on science.
 Ours is a country with a population of one billion in which solution to the
 problem of getting enough food for everyone to eat requires self-reliant
 increases in grain output.  How can grain output be increased?  This is a problem
 that very much merits discussion.
 Many proposals have been made for increasing grain production.  Some people have
 suggested a need to stabilize the area planted to rice, wheat, and corn, permitting
 no further reductions.  Others have advocated stabilization of the dual crop
 system in South China.  Are these proposals valid?
 I believe that it is necessary, first of all, to learn the reasons why speed of
 growth of grain output in China is slow.  On the basis of my investigations during
 the past several years in north and south China, I would say that one major
 reason has been that peasants everywhere have been eating "out of a large common
 pot."  Beginning from 1956, and more particularly since 1958, the speed of changes
 in production relationships in rural villages has outstripped productivity.  When
 we were out examining the countryside, we frequently observed several oxen
 plowing the fields and 10 or 20 people working together on a plot of land, and a
 very great amount of enforced idleness.  In October 1980 during an inspection trip
 in Anhui Province, I saw heartening changes.  The Yingtou sugar production team in
 Liyuan Commune, Fengyang County had for more than 20 years depended on grain
 resold to them by the state, and.every year, following the. harvest, both adults
 and children would flee famine to beg for food.  In 1977 following the overthrow
 of the "gang of four," though the weather had been normal, grain yields had still

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100190001-7
 only been 66 jin per mu, and 8000 jin of grain returned by the state was consumed.
 In 1979, with large scale contracting with teams for production,. grain yields were
 200 jin per mu.   In 1980, after institution of a system of contracting for
 production with households, grain yields were more than 400 jin per mu.  During
 that year, in addition to grain for consumption and for use as seeds,. more than
 110,000 fin of grain was sold to the state, and more than 10,000 jin of peanuts
 was sold as well.   This situation shows that with the same cultivated land, the
 same workforce, and the same production conditions, eating "out of a large common
 pot" and not eating "out of a large common pot" makes a vast difference.  Once
 the peasants had true autonomy, only then did initiative arise, and only then was
 the most made of the advantages provided by the soil and the workforce.
 Inappropriate production relationships-destroy peasant initiative; and must
 inevitably block growth in grain output.
 Secondly, scant harvests from widely planted areas is also a major reason.  In
 1980, I made an investigation of the Tsaidam Basin in Qinghai Province, which had
 had a record high output of spring wheat.  At many farms there, yields of winter
 wheat from small cultivated areas (15 mu) amounted to 2,000 jin per mu.  One
 production team with 1,500 mu of cultivated land also had average yields of
 1,000 fin per mu.  But on most farms, average yields were only 200 to 300 jin per
 mu.  This was because at that time higher authority required only that each farm
 guarantee a certain area for wheat, making no clear requirements for output.  As
 a result, every farm planted a wide area, but harvested little, and they did not
 pool water, fertilizer, and manpower to do intensive farming.  Another actual
 experience took place at the Muzhuang Production Brigade in Nanpi County, Hebei
 Province, where there are large tracts of salinized soil.  In 1974, 2,650 mu
 of grain was planted, but yields were only 46.8 jin per mu.  In 1978, the grain-
 field area was curtailed to 1,769 mu and water and fertilizer were concentrated
 for intensive farming; yields rose to 211.8 mu per jin.  In 1979, the grainfield
 area was further reduced to 1,229 mu, and yields rose to 336.6 fin per mu.
 During these 2 years, this production brigade afforested sandy areas, grew reeds
 in low-lying areas, and grew hay or rotated hay and grain in saline areas in
 an all-around development of agriculture, forestry, and livestock raising.  This
 shows that the size of grain output depends not only on the size of the area sown
 to grain.  In many places in China, low grain yields are inseparable from the
 guiding mentality of planting large areas and reaping scant harvests.
 Destruction of forests, the clearing of mountain lands for agriculture, and
 reclamation of lakes to make fields is another major reason for droughts, and
 adverse effects on grain production.  Destruction of mountain forests and  the
 clearing of land there not only hurts forestry, livestock raising and diversifica-
 tion, but also has bad consequences for grain production itself.  In Shenxi
 Province, the masses say, "When the mountains are cleared to the peaks, people
 become poor and die out," and "when clearing is done on the mountains above,
 disaster ensues for the people below."  In western Hunan Province, the forests
 on Xuefengshan were felled, and all the cleared mountain slopes, including those
 with a slope of more than 30 degrees, were cleared for the planting of corn,
 which was intercropped with young China fir seedlings.  During a particularly
 heavy downpour of rain in 1979, more than 10,000 mu of ricefields at the foot of
 the mountain in Dongkou County were washed away, and more than 20,000 mu were
 stricken with drought.  In 1958, trees were cut from the Dabieshan in Anhui

 Province to make charcoal for the smelting of iron.  As a result of erosion, flood
 and drought disasters subsequently increased in frequency.  The reclamation of
 lakes to make farmland seemingly increases the amount of cultivated land, but
 because of the decrease in water reserves, floods occur during rainy seasons, and
 water is lacking for irrigation during dry spells.   One example was the Chengxi
 Lake in Huoqiu County, Anhui Province, which stored 700 million cubic meters of
 water before reclamation.  Following reclamation, it held only 0.75 cubic meters.
 When the rainy season came, more than 600 million cubic meters of water
 innundated every place.  Not only were the lake fields that had been reclaimed
 innundated, but all the surrounding fields were drowned as well.  The local people
 said, "Reclaiming the lake was like reclaiming the bottom of a kettle, and the
 water flooded over the sides of the kettle."  Because of waterlogging, more than
 100 million jin of grain was lost in 1980.  Furthermore, as a?result of the
 reclamation of the lake and the building of locks, fish were unable to migrate
 into the lake to spawn, and a great decrease occurred in the production of fish,
 crabs, and shrimps.  This source of animal protein was lost, and there was no
 place for lotus, Gorgon fruit, wild rice, and such food plants to grow.  Baitang
 Lake in Congyang County in Anhui formerly had 180,000 mu of water surface, but
 more than two-thirds of this water surface has now been reclaimed.  Before
 reclamation, the lake produced more than 2 million jin of fish annually. In'1979,
 this dropped to somewhat more than 200,000 jin.  Formerly. catches of wild ducks
 amounted to more than 1 million, but now they are extinct.  In 1980, one-third
 of the dikes surrounding the lowlying fields were breached.  Someone rightly said,
 "When man wanted to go'against the will of heaven and enclose the lake to make
 fields, heaven got rid of the reclamation and made it back into a lake."
 The reckless changes made in the system of farming nationwide from south to north
 is another major reason.  Ever since 1958, in particular, when the double cropping
 of rice was promoted in the south as a "panacea," total grain output in some
 places has declined contrary to expectations.  In the fertile soil areas in the
 mid-reaches of the Yangtze River, for instance, total output from both crops of
 rice is about 1000 jin per mu.  But should lots of rain fall and temperatures drop
 in the fall.reducing output from the late rice crop, only the 700 jin from the.
 early rice crop can be assured.  However, a two crop system of rice and wheat (or
 rape) can bring consistent yields of 1,100 jin per mu.  In 1980, Jiangsu Province
 organized high yield experiments on 100 mu continuous tracts at 26 different
 sites, which proved that a two crop system of rice and wheat can outstrip the
 yields of a triple crop system.  In the case of Tianzhuang Production Brigade in
 Wantou Commune, Hanjiang County, double cropping of wheat and rice produced
 yields of 2,014 jin per mu, while three crops of rice produced only 1,515 jin
 per. mu.  In the area that runs from Taoyuan in Hunan to Taihe in Jiangxi, two
 crops of rice generally yield no more than 600 to 700 jin per mu.  In the
 aforestated places, sunlight and atmospheric temperatures during July and August
 are good, (with sunlight amounting to 30 percent of the year's total).  During
 this time of year, the early season rice is already in its final stage of growth
 when photosynthesis has greatly declined. Meanwhile, the late season rice is
 only in its seedling stage when leaf surfaces are extremely small and unable to
 make fullest use of the sunlight and warmth conditions prevailing during July and
 August.  Winters are fairly cold in this area and the spring season warm, exactly
 the right temperature conditions for the vernalization stage  of wheat and rape
 and able to play a "height of the season" role.  However, since two crops of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 rice mean long term innundation of the soil with water, if green manure is
 intercropped with late season rice, opportunity is lacking for plowing it under
 and sunning the soil in winter, making the soil prone to some secondary gleying.
 Since soil porosity is poor, the plant roots have difficulty breathing, so even
 if greatly fertilized, the rice roots still are unable to fully absorb nut.rieht8l
 The period of irrigation of the fields is long, and some natural enemies of'
 insect pests such as ricefield spiders are drowned, or are unable to survive and
 reproduce, which aggravates the damage done to the late rice crop by diseases
 and insect pests.  When two crops of the same kind are grown in a single year, the
 quantity of fertilizer required and the amount of seeds needed are particularly
 great.  It may be seen that the area of double cropping of rice in South China
 should be curtailed rather than stabilized at its present unreasonable acreage.
 On the northeastern plain, after the "great leap forward," the gaoliang, millet,
 and soybean acreage was reduced and the corn acreage expanded.  More than 90
 percent of the former soybean fields are intercropped with corn, and millet
 fields are also intercropped with corn.  Corn is a warmth loving crop, and this
 is particularly true of medium-late ripening varieties, which if exposed to frost
 during the late growth stage, will have seriously reduced output.  In addition,
 corn is a crop-with large stems, which when intercropped with soybeans, shade
 the soybeans from the sunlight and reduce temperature to some extent.  In the
 northeast, where  the growing season is short, this results in reduced soybean
 output.
 On the North China Plain, historically during years  in which the autumn crop was
 the major one, the land lay fallow in a system of three crops every two years
 whereby gaoliang or corn was grown one year as an autumn crop, soybeans or millet
 was grown one year as a late autumn crop, and wheat was grown one year.  Nowadays
 the farming system on the North China Plain has become a single one with winter
 wheat or corn accounting for about 80 percent of the, acreage.  Since 1958,
 curtailment has taken place in the area planted to millet and gaoliang,. which
 resist drought and tolerate alkaline-saline conditions; and peanuts, which are
 suited to growing in sandy soil; soybeans, which tolerate wetness; and cotton,
 which tolerates slight salinity, have been squeezed out by wheat and corn.  This
 has resulted not only in reduced output of cotton and oil bearing crops, but
 also the continuous planting of wheat and corn year after year has both plundered
 the soil of its fertility and made it lack organic matter.  There is no nitrogen
 fixing bacterial activity from root nodules of pulses; nor is there any bean cake
 or peanut cake for use as fertilier,. so soil fertility declines and grain output
 can never be increased.
 Following analysis of the aforestated reasons, solution to the problem of
 increased grain output requires a certain direction of effort.
 In addition to acting in accordance with economic laws and correcting production
 relationships not in consonance with productivity, it is necessary to establish,
 first of all, an outlook of "grain in a larger sense", and to smash the narrow
 view that grain is limited to paddy rice, wheat, corn, and such grass family'
 foods, which are predominantly starch.  It is necessary to start with human
 health requirements, and in addition to developing starch to calories, it is
 necessary also to develop meats, eggs, milk, and fish, which contain animal

 protein, and to develop goods that contain vegetable protein, and vegetable fat,
 as well as vegetables, fruits, and sugars.  Therefore, when soybeans and suger-
 beets are grown in the northeast, when soybeans and peanuts are grown in North
 China, when rape and peanuts are grown in southern regions, and when sugercane
 i5 grown in South China, they may not be dismissed as not being grain, nor may
 the raising of fish, crabs, shrimp, and wild ducks in lakes, or the growing of
 lotus, water chestnuts, Gorgon fruit, and wild rice on the edges of lakes be
 deemed something other than grain.  Furthermore, further serious attention should
 be devoted to woody oil foods such as tea oil, Chinese chestnuts, walnuts, and
 persimmons.   If one has this outlook of "grain in a larger sense," there will be
 no further stupidities such as the reclamation of lakes to create fields, the
 destruction of forests to clear land for agriculture, or destruction of the
 ecological balance, nor will there by any violation of the laws of planting crops
 in the soils where they grow best.
 Increase in the per unit yields of all kinds of low output fields in the country
 is a major way to solve the problem of increased grain output.  In South China,
 red and yellow soils and dryland slopes account for 180 million mu form which
 yields of grain are less than 200 or 300 jin per mu, and even as low as several
 score jin per mu.  Low yield fields such as this have a strongly acidic reaction,
 so in addition to applications of nitrogenous, potash, and phosphate fertilizers
 as well as green manure, they need powdered limestone to neutralize their acidity.
 This is a key measure,for increasing per unit yields from dryland crops such as
 corn, peanuts, pulses, and sweet potatoes.  Were some small water conservancy
 projects to be built so that drylands could be converted to the growing of wheat
 and rice, and additional fertilizer applied, yields of 800 jin per mu would be
 easily attainable,  Furthermore, in the cold waterlokged fields, the poorly
 drained fields, and the clayey fields in hilly and mountain gulch regions, most of
 which are highly acidic and where the daily period of sunlight is short, yields
 of rice are less than 300 or 400 jin per mu.  In addition to using lime, especially
 needed is the construction around the mountains of flood prevention ditches and
 drainage ditches in a good system of drainage and irrigation so as'-to be able
 to dry out and sun the fields in order to avoid marshy conditions and secondary
 gleying, and a change to the growing of winter wheat, rape, and broad beans,
 and the growing in summer of mid-season rice with yields of 800 jin per mu not
 being difficult.  In the numerous low yield fields with accumulations of water in
 the south where yields are now only 200 to 300 jin per mu, the principle
 contradiction is also with internal waterlogging and drainage problems, but
 yields of 800 jin per mu are also possible there.
 Most of the low yield fields in North China contain salinized soil.  For those
 that receive large amounts of summer rain in-the Huang, Huai, and Hai plains, the
 key lies in solution to the spring seedling problem including the washing away
 of salt, avoidance of salt, tolerance of salt, and resistance to salinity whereby
 yields can be easily increased from 200 jin per mu to 500 jin per mu.  For inland
 dryland areas with salinized low yield fields, field plots should not be
 excessively large; the ground should be leveled, and the irrigation and drainage
 systems should be separate from each other.  Through the use of the advantages'
 there in sunlight, water, and warmth, it is possible to increase yields of spring
 wheat from 200 to 300 jin per mu to 1000 jin per mu.  There are about 500 million
 mu of low yield fields throughout the country.  If intensively farmed, and given

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 just the right amount of material and energy investment to increase yields by an
 average 200 to 300 jin per mu, the annual grain increase would be more than 100
 billion jin.
 Still another major means to increase yields is to encourage farming methods for
 use and nurture of the soil, meaning the reverse cropping or rotational cropping
 of pulse crops and grass grain crops, and dryland crops with paddy rice.  The south
 should curtail its present double rice crop acreage in order to reduce the rotting
 of early rice crop seedlings in the Yangtze River basin and the crop losses or
 only half-filled glumes occassioned by autumn rains and low temperatures.  Even
 in southern Guangxi and southern-Guangdong where atmospheric temperatures are
 sufficiently high, some of the double crops-of rice should be changed to a
 rotational cropping system of dryland-wetland-dryland so as to keep the paddy
 fields from being immersed in water for too long a period of time, thereby
 preventing secondary sleying.  North China should adapt general methods to the
 local situation in an advocacy of a rotational cropping system of wheat, corn
 and soybeans, and peanuts.  The northeast should exploit its advantages for
 growing soybeans and rape.  In the northwest, spring wheat should be rotated with
 peas, broad beans, and rape.  All these are major ways to increase yields.
 In addition, where ecological and environmental conditions permit'in the eastern
 part of the country, woody oil.crops such as walnuts, Chinese chestnuts, persimmons,
 and large dates (as well as semi-tropical tea oil) should be grown, and in the
 south fruits such as citrus, lichees, longans, pineapple, and bananas should be
 developed.  In the north, pears, peaches, apples, and grapes should be developed,
 and all should be regarded as increases in output of foodstuffs.
 In the field of increased output of animal foods, major ways in which the country
 can increase output is to grow beef cattle in the south, yaks on the high plateaus,
 cattle and sheep in the grasslands of the northwest and along the seacoast in
 North China, while rural villages raise poultry and hogs, and rivers, lakes', and
 ponds grow fish.  If the 300 to 400 million mu of water surfaces were used to
 raise fish, with suitable amounts of feed being provided them, figuring catches
 of only 30 jin per mu, 10 billion jin of protein could be provided.
 In summary, solution to the problem of feeding China's 1 billion population
 requires, first of all, an outlook of "grain in a larger sense," and the way to
 increased output lies not in emphasis on expansion of the rice, corn, and wheat
 acreage or on the multiple cropping index but rather in raising per unit yields
 and giving serious attention to intensive farming. A.fundamental problem is
 implementation of correct policies for the development of agriculture, reliance
 on policies, reliance on science, and steady heightening of the initiative of the
 masses to preserve and develop the productivity of agriculture.

 GUANGMING RIBAO ON SCIENCE'S ROLE IN PRODUCTION
 OW241226 Beijing XINHUA in English 1215 GMT 24 Apr 81
 [Text] Beijing, 2 Apr (XINHUA) --Cotton growers in Shandong Province last year earned an
 additional 320 million yuan by using a new variety of cotton seed developed through
 radiation-induced mutation to increase the output of the crop by 50,000 tons, reports
 the GU ANGMING DAILY today.   In contrast, the provincial authorities spent only 3.6
 million yuan on the Research Institute of Cotton under the Shandong Academy of Agricultural.:
 Sciences which developed the new variety, from the founding of the institute in 1959
 to 1980.   The new variety, named "Lumian No 1" is hailed by the GUANGMING DAILY as a   _
 convincing example to show the role science can play in promoting production.
 In a front-page editorial accompanying the news report about the variety, the newspaper
 calls upon the "entire party to pay still greater attention to scientific work."  More
 than 566,000 hectares last year in. Shandong Province and approximately 100,000 hectares
 in Hebei, Henan and other provinces were sown to Lumian No 1.  Resistant to adverse farmija
 conditions, it yielded on the average 25 percent more than traditional varieties in
 Shandong Province.
 Shandong is a major cotton grower in China.  Work began in 1961 to develop a new variety
 to replace the degenerating Daizi 15, which was sown in 80 percent of the area for cotton:
 Thanks to the cooperation of the Institute of the Application of Atomic Energy to'
 Agriculture, another branch of the provincial academy of agricultural sciences, researcher
 of the Cotton Institute succeeded in developing Lumian No 1 in 1976.
 Today's GUANGMING DAILY editorial is the second in a series demanding more attention to
 scientific research.   It calls for more investment for this purpose.

 zHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO CITED ON AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
 01;241041 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 1245 GMT 23 May 81
 (Report on ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO 23 May editorial:   "Be Pioneers in Studying and Popu-
 larizing Agricultural Science and Technology"]
 (Text)  Beijing, 23 May (XINHUA)--Under the headline "Peasants Thirst for Science, Young
 People Take the Lead in Studying Hard," today's ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO front-pages a num-
 ber of reports on the study and application of science by young people in the countryside.
 The reports vividly reflect the encouraging changes in the countryside brought about by
 implementing the policies of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.
 The paper also publishes an editorial entitled "Be Pioneers in Studying and Popularizing
 Agricultural Science and Technology."
 The editorial says:  We must rely on policy and science in developing agricultural produc-
 tion.  Now that the question of the system of responsibility in production has been ba-
 sically solved, development and popularization of agricultural science and technology are
 the key to further agricultural development.  This is also the immediate demand of the
 broad masses of peasants.  Therefore, to be pioneers in studying and popularizing agri-
 cultural. science and technology is a glorious task facing the hundreds of millions of
 young people in the countryside.
 The editorial says:   Science and technology are of great importance to promoting the
 development of agricultural production.  The average per-mu output of the superior
 variety of hybrid rice first successfully bred in our country is generally 100 jin more
 than that of other varieties of rice.  Since the large-scale popularization of this
 variety, grain output has increased more than 20 billion jin in the past 5 years.  The
 fine variety of "Shandong No 1 cotton" has been praised by the masses as "a ready source
 of money."  Since popularizing this variety of cotton in Shandong, the province's ginned
 cotton output increased 2.5 million dan, valued at 320 million yuan, in 1 year alone.
 These are all major developments.  As far as minor developments are concerned, it is pos-
 sible to achieve remarkable results by improving soil, breeding a fine variety of a crop
 and properly applying chemical fertilizer and pesticides.  Particularly in areas where
 output quotas are fixed on a work group basis and individual laborers undertake to ful-
 fill certain quotas in farm work, whether or not scientific measures are taken and how
 much production increases have a direct bearing on the interests of individual commune
 members.  The commune members' personal experiences show that "the more scientific farming
 is carried out, the better."
 The editorial calls on the large numbers of educated young people in the countryside to
 swing into action, conscientiously study agricultural science and technology, vigorously
 conduct agricultural scientific experiments, vigorously popularize agricultural scientific
 and technological achievements and to bring about a mass upsurge in marching toward agri-
 cultural science and technology.

 The editorial points out:  Our common objective is to build a prosperous countryside.  It
 is impossible to build communism in a country full of illiterates.  Likewise, it is im-
 possible rto achieve agricultural modernization in villages that are scientifically and
 technologically backward.  The countryside will become prosperous if all young people there
 conscientously grasp and apply science and technology.  As far as most people are con-
 cerned, "It is better to master skills than to have money in the pocket."                        If we grasp
 science and technology, we will have the skills to contribute to the four modernizations
 and to make more contributions to the party and the people.  Then, our personal livelihood
 will improve step by step.
 The editorial continues:  Some young people think that it takes time and causes delays
 in their work to study science and technology, thus affecting their income.  At the same'
 time, the crying of children and shouting of adults in their households make it impo8sjb
 for them to study.
 The editorial adds:   To study it is necessary to put in time and energy. Young people
 in the countryside have favorable conditions for studying agricultural science and tech=
 nology because they have an intimate knowledge of agricultural production.   So long as
 they study hard, they can grasp agricultural science and technology even in difficult
 circumstances.  Now all comrades from the central level down to the local levels are con-
 cerned about the question of study by young people in the countryside.   Broadcast agricuul-,
 tural schools, correspondence schools, evening te-hnical schools, short-term training
 classes, mobile technical reporting groups and spare-time agrotechnical schools for
 young people have opened broad avenues for the study and popularization of agricultural
 science and technology.  We must study hard and seriously and persist in doing so for
 several years in order to master agricultural science and technology.

 EXPANDING CONTRACT SYSTEM FOR SCIENTIFIC FARMING EMPHASIZED
 Beijing BANYUETAN in Chinese No 14, 25 Jul 81 pp 26-27
 [Article by Zhou Changnian [0719 7022 1628]:  '."Contract System for Scientific
 Farming' That Is Worth Popularizing"]
 [Text]  The Chunwan Commune of Yangchun County in Guangdong Province has an advanced
 model in scientific farming--the Sanjie production team.  For 18 years, the paddy
 rice planted by this team has-always produced high and stable yields and the cost
 has been low.  For example, in 1979 the yield of paddy rice per mu (early and late
 seasons) reached over 1,920 jin, over 1,000 jin more than that of other production
 teams.  The economic income of commune members, was also onefold higher than that
 of other teams.  The local leadership organization summarized their experience of
 planting paddy rice and called it the "sanjie experience" and tried to popularize
 it in all other localities, but they were not able to popularize it.  In 1980,
 however, the scientific association and the county scientific committee of Yangchun
 County signed a "contract for scientific planting" with three production teams to
 popularize the "Sanjie experience" through the commune's science popularization
 association; reduced yields were to be fully compensated for and increased yields
 were to be distributed proportionally.  The three production teams happily accepted.
 After implementation, the paddy rice produced large-scale increases in yield and
 the costs dropped.  At one of the production teams, called "yu ding san," the average
 per mu yield of early rice increased dramatically from the previous year's 627 jin
 to 928 jin, and the late rice increased in yield by 51 percent.  The costs for chem-
 ical fertilizers and farm chemicals dropped, the cost of each dan of rice grains
 dropped 1 yuan.  The per capita average income distributed to commune members in-
 creased from. 92 yuan the previous year to 154 yuan.  Commune members smiled happily.
 In recent years, many localities in our nation have implemented the "contract system
 for scientific farming."  Some achievements and experience in agricultural science
 and technology that could not be popularized for a long time in the past have rapidly  a
 been popularized.   Science and technology have been directly converted into pro-
 ductivity, and the farmers have applauded the increased yields and increased harvests.
 Why is it that the achievements and experience of agricultural techniques that "no-
 body wanted" are now welcomed?  The problem is that in the past it was a habit to
 popularize them by administrative methods, regardless of whether people could use
 them or not and without giving concrete technical guidance, and a more important
 reason was that nobody was responsible for reduced yields.  The farmers rely on
 farming for a living; of course they were not willing to use new techniques about
 which they were uncertain.

 The "contract system for scientific farming" joins the popularization of new tech-
 niques with economic benefits and economic responsibility as stipulated by the con-
 tracts, so the situation is different.  The general methods are:  the scientific and
 technical departments of the county sign contracts with production teams according
 to the agricultural production needs of the production teams and in accordance with
 subjective and objective conditions, and issue the contracts through the commune
 science popularization association (this mass scientific and technical organization
 is organized by the agricultural technical personnel of the commune, experienced
 old farmers and various skilled professionals).  Agricultural technicians are dis-
 patched and stationed with the production teams, technical measures to increase
 yields and increase harvests are established in accordance with the actual situation
 of the production teams, and the technicians teach the production teams to grasp
 and utilize these measures.  If the production team causes a reduction in agricul-
 tural yield by the implementation of these measures, the scientific and technical
 departments pay the compensation.  Reduced yields due to natural disasters which
 could not be resisted are not laid to the account of either side.  If there are in-
 creased yields, the scientific and technical department and the production team share
 the surplus proportionally according to the stipulations of the contract.  The methods
 of dividing the increased yields proportionally vary.  Some methods provide 30 per-
 cent to the scientific. and technical departments and agricultural technicians station-
 ed with the production team, and the production team receives 70 percent.                Some
 methods provide that an increased yield of 5 percent belongs entirely to the.pro-
 duction team, and that any surplus beyond the 5 percent is equally divided between
 the two parties.  In this way, the farmers will be able to boldly accept new tech-
 niques.
 Viewing the situation of recent years, most of the scientific farming contracts,
 have been successfully executed.  The farmers have increased yields and increased
 income, the collective economy has been consolidated.  When the scientific and
 technical departments popularized new techniques, some even realized a surplus from
 the portion that could be retrieved or from total investment, and their enthusiasm
 in work was even higher.  In the farm villages, there is always a group of active
 persons who enthusiastically study agricultural science and technology.  After the
 contract system of scientific farming was implemented, they joined the commune's
 science popularization association and they have been able to utilize their talent
 and develop their skills so their efforts have grown more quickly.
 It'is hoped that the contract system of scientific farming will be popularized at
 even more localities!

 RENMIN RIBAO EMPHASIZES AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
 HK280222 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 21 Jul 81 p 1
 [Editorial: "Strive To Meet the Peasants' New Demands in Studying and Applying
 Science"]
 (Text)  Following the popularization of various systems of responsibility, which pay
 according to output, the masses of peasants have been very enthusiastic about mastering
 and studying science and technology.  This indicates that a great campaign of the
 popularization of science and technology is rising in the rural areas and foretells
 great changes of historical significance in the Chinese countryside.
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought maintains:  Only when people directly feel that a
 new ideology, new theory and new science are inseparable from their livelihood and
 destiny, will they become interested in them, pursue them and regard them as parts of
 their life.  Millions upon millions of Chinese peasants are celebrated for their
 diligence and wisdom.  They use their own hands to create enormous material wealth and
 accumulate precious experience in farming.  However, in old China they were fettered by
 the backward production relations and vicious exploitation system.  They toiled without
 enough to eat and wear.  It was absolutely impossible for them to be educated and to
 study and apply science.  After the founding of new China, the broad masses of peasants
 became the masters of their land, which provided them with rights and conditions for
 receiving education and studying and applying science.  In the 1950's and early 1960's,
 an upsurge of popularizing advanced agrotechnology rose in the Chinese countryside and
 we achieved great success in this respect.  However, due to lack of experience, defects
 of formalism, and the issuing'of confused orders, "doing things in a rigid way regard-
 less of specific conditions" occurred.  Under the influence of leftist deviationist
 errors, agriculture could only develop according to a typical model in China, a very
 big country, during the "Great Cultural Revolution."  This seriously undermined
 agricultural research and education and the popularization of agrotechniq'ues.  Some
 agrotechnicians did achieve limited results in very difficult conditions.   However,
 little in the popularization of agrotechniques was achieved in many areas, despite the
 concerted efforts of the agrotechnicians.  This was because the peasants had no power
 to make their own decisions and egalitarianism in the communes, which were larger in.
 size and had a higher degree of public ownership, dampened the peasants' enthusiasm for
 applying science.  It is different now.  Linking remuneration with production output is
 like linking the peasants' hearts, and anyone who works under the system of linking .
 remuneration with production output has to be concerned.   This is because the system of
 responsibility in agricultural production links up.the peasants' decisionmaking rights,
 responsibilities and interests.  Now the peasants take the initiative in finding ways
 to increase production.  In the course of practice, they have experienced the truth that
 production can be increased by the application of science.  Therefore, they are eager
 to study and apply science.  Some areas have practiced a contract system for
 popularizing agrotechniques.  They do this by directly linking the results of
 popularizing agrotechniques with the-bilateral interests of the agrotechnicians and
 peasant households.  This has promoted the popularization of agrotechniques.  The task
 now facing party committees and people's governments at all levels is that, while they

 must stabilize the series of rural economic policies that have been welcomed by the
 peasants since the 3d plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, they should
 sum up and perfect them.  They must also strive to meet the peasants' new demands in
 studying and applying science.  Only by doing this and by giving full play to the role
 of policies and science can we further consolidate and develop the fine situation in the
 countryside.
 'Comrades in Ningxia were right when they said that when cadres go to rural areas now, they
 must bring along both policies and science.  This shows that the peasants have set higher
 demands on our cadres.  Rural cadres at all levels must clearly recognize this new situation
 and conscientiously acquire agrotechnical  knowledge.   Earlier, comrades in some areas were
 worried that the peasants would not obey directives after the introduction of the system
 of responsibility in production.  It is now very obvious that the peasants welcome the
 method of leading production according to scientific laws and that they will certainly
 refuse to obey directives that  ignore science.  If the directives are issued to them
 arbitrarily, they will on no account welcome some pervasive methods of leadership.  Cadres
 who are welcomed by peasants must have some knowledge of science.  By the end of 1980, some
 agricultural colleges and schools had trained over 16,000 leading cadres above county level.
 Apart from responsible comrades of various departments and provinces, secretaries of pre-
 fectural party committees also attend study classes organized by the State Agricultural
 Commission and the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee.  Various
 departments and bureaus in charge of agricultural affairs and a number of provinces are also
 organizing training classes.  It is an unprecedented good thing that such a great number
 of leading cadres are studying theories, policies and knowledge regarding science and
 technology.  We sincerely wish them greater success in making themselves more educated
 and also hope that more and more cadres at their posts will manage to find time to study
 some scientific knowledge.  By gradually taking off the label of "illiterates in science,"
 leading cadres will not only win the right to speak in leading production,  but will be
 in a better position to rely on and organize agrotechnicians to popularize agrotechniques
 among the peasants.
 It is the duty of agrotechnicians to popularize agrotechnical knowledge among peasants
 and promote practical agrotechniques in light of local conditions.  According to initial
 statistics, county agricultural research institutes, agrotechnical popularization centers,
 seed companies (centers), plant protection centers and. farmyard manure centers throughout
 the country have employed 173,000 cadres who are responsible for the popularization of
 agrotechniques.  In addition  we have about 200,000 part-time agrotechnicians.  Although
 their number is not large enough, they are the backbone force for' popularizing and spreading
 agrotechniques at present and in the near future.  They are welcomed in the rural areas
 because they have acquired certain scientific and technological knowledge.   In the meantime,
 the peasants have realized through their practice over the past few years that these agro-
 technicians are serving the peasants truly and wholeheartedly and that they are dependable
 persons who will make contributions to agricultural modernization.  The fact that these
 comrades are warmly welcomed by the peasants has made them further realize the correctness
 of the party's line, guiding principles and policies, and that they are shouldering a
 heavier task.  They have to do lots of work, such as popularization of scientific knowledge
 and results, the training of personnel, model operation and on-the-spot guidance, and so
 forth.  Following the development of production and the further implementation of policies,
 the peasants will set new technical demands in the field of scientific farming and diversi-
 fied undertakings.  By continuing to carry forward the style of arduous struggle and by
 diligently doing their work well, constantly studying new techniques and raising their
 professional standards, the masses of agrotechnique promoters will certainly make greater
 contributions.  The party Central Committee recently called.on scientists to do their work
 by linking it with reality and by acting as their own masters.  Agricultural scientists and
 agricultural education workers should plunge into the reality of production in the
 countryside to seek topics, and make technical and other key problems in agricultural
 production the important points in their research.  It is absolutely necessary to carry out
 research on the basic theories of agriculture.   It was foolish to drive all agricultural
 scientists to the countryside.   This practice should no longer be carried out.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 However, agricultural scientists should also realize that all research topics, in the
 final analysis, come from practice in production and serve production.  Agricultural
 research and education should not be separated from the practical conditions of our country
 and the actual demands of the peasants.  Why did we succeed in breeding hybrid rice and
 the cotton "Lumian No 1"?  Why  are they welcomed by the peasants?  It is becuase we have
 stuck to a correct orientation of scientific research.  This will be proved by more and
 more facts.
 In order to meet the peasants' demands in science and technology, the system of agricultural
 research must be readjusted and reformed and the forces of agricultural research must be
 strengthened.  There are quite a number of agricultural research organizations throughout
 the country, but the number of people engaged in this research is insufficient.  The quality
 of research is poor.  Besides  they are somewhat scattered, and engaged in duplicate research.
 The network for popularizing agrotechniques is incomplete.  This situation must be changed
 step by step.  We should proceed from the demands of agricultural production in our country
 to organize people who are engaged in research work and arrange research tasks for the
 departments of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and aquatic products industry.  Both
 division of labor and coordination are needed.  We should gradually change the ownership system
 of the departments and localities.  The state and provinces should strengthen the forces
 of research institutes (departments) so that they will become research units specialized in
 certain fields.  The main task of the county agricultural research centers is to conduct
 experiments, demonstrate and popularize new techniques and carry out training for technical
 cadres and the popularization of science.  Apart from doing a good job in the investigation
 of natural resources and differentiating agricultural regions, agricultural departments in
 various localities should effectively carry out the popularization of the results of key
 projects in particular.
 The peasants' desire for science and technology has also set new demands on.propaganda and
 publishing departments.  This newspaper has recently received a large number of letters
 from readers, complaining that the supplies of books on agrotechnology are insufficient
 and that these books are not applicable even if available.  Therefore, publishing departments
 should investigate and organize forces to expediently compile and publish various books
 which meet the peasants'?actual needs.  Newspapers, magazines, broadcasting and television
 services in various areas should take advantage of favorable conditions and introduce more
 agrotechnical knowledge.
 Party organizations at all levels must regard meeting the peasants' new demands in studying
 and applying science as an important part of strengthening the party's leadership over work
 in the countryside.  It is necessary to run rural elementary,, middle and agrotechnical
 schools well, show concern for the livelihood of agrotechnical cadres, support their work and
 truly rely on them in leading agricultural production.  The present agricultural situation in
 our country is excellent.  If we rely on science, the situation in the countryside will
 further improve.  If the situation in the countryside improves, our country's economic
 readjustment will certainly succeed.

 BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH TO MODERNIZE AGRICULTURE EMPHASIZED
 Beijing ZIRAN BIANZHENGFA TONGXUN in Chinese No 4, 10 Aug 81 pp 32-35
 [Article by Guo Xingxian [6665 5281 0341] of the Department of Biology of the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences:  "Biological Research Must Better Serve Agricultural
 Modernization"]
 [Text]  During the course of implementing the academy's guidelines of "emphasizing
 the foundations, emphasizing improvement to serve the national economy and national
 defense buildup" by the biological research units of the Chihese Academy of Sciences,
 there are many problems that require discussion and study.  One of the problems is
 how to better serve agricultural modernization.  Our academy's biological sciences
 department has 26 subordinate research institutes, and in the 1980 research plan
 one-third of the topics was directly or indirectly related to agriculture.  But in
 recent years the topic of serving agriculture has been mentioned less and less.
 At the same time, applications research into topics serving agriculture has tended
 to weaken.  Therefore, in implementing the guideline of "two emphases, two services,"
 serving agricultural modernization better is a question worth noticing..
 A Simple Analysis of the Various Research Achievements
 Through coordination and cooperation with brotherly units outside the academy, a
 series of achievements related to agricultural modernization have been realized in
 recent years and they can be analyzed according to the various categories.
 Basic Research.   Basic research in biology directly and indirectly serving agriculture
 can be divided into two groups.  One is survey and research into biological types,
 distribution, evolution, kinship and natural conditions, i.e., the accumulation and
 compilation of basic data.  Of course, this also includes theoretical research.
 The other is basic theoretical research.  The work of basic data is important'.
 It should be gathered during ordinary times so that it can be brought out when it
 is needed for use, and this work should lead production and construction.  The task
 of basic data research in biology is extensive:  it includes the compilation of
 China's fauna, flora, spore flora, economic entomological record, special books on
 mapping of vegetation on soils, etc.  The basic data can serve agriculture in many
 ways, such as the protection of nature and resources, land utilization, and
 agricultural zoning; primary material for biological breeding, prevention and control
 of diseases of humans and of domesticated animals; prevention and control of plant
 plant diseases and insect pests--they all need related basic data to serve as their
 scientific basis.   For this basic data work, our academy has organized national

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 cooperation to carry out surveys, arranged and compiled data, and published items of
 important systematic data one after the other.  For example, compilation of the
 national flora has progressed rather quickly in recent years:  37 volumes have now
 been published or completed and we are striving to complete 80 volumes by 1985.
 This will provide preliminary clarification of the origin of about 30,000 types of
 higher plants.  In recent ,years, our academy has strengthened the study different
 types of forests and grassland ecology in Jilin, Nei Monggol, Guangdong, Yunnan,
 Qunghai, and Cinjiang; to carry out long-term observations and research; and to
 strengthen the link between theory-and the actual situation,. combine the far and the
 near, and accumulate a systematic scientific record.  In recent years, some major
 national economic construction projects have been the subject of debate in scientific
 and technological circles, such as the question of whether to build a fish passageway
 through the Gezhou Dam spanning the Changjiang in order to protect the aquatic
 resources.  The Marine Biology Institute studied mainly the regional systems of fish
 and individual ecology on the basis of 20 to 30 years of survey and research data.
 The institute suggested that it is not necessary to spend a lot of money to invest
 in the building of a fish passageway, and it proposed measures that can be taken to
 protect fish resources.  This suggestion prompted the government to conduct. further
 .surveys and research so as to avoid a premature decision on the construction of a
 fish passageway.
 Basic theoretical research can make major and profoundly significant contributions to
 agriculture.  For example, the study of photosynthesis, the chemical simulation of
 biological fixing of nitrogen, the utilization of'cell engineering and genetic
 engineering to create agricultural crops with especially large economic value
 (including tree varieties and grass varieties), new types and new varieties of
 domesticated animals and microorganisms are all long-term and highly exploratory
 subjects of basic theoretical research.  If a breakthrough is made in such research,
 we can turn to-applications research, and this will bring about revolutionary changes
 in agricultural production.   Take chemical simulation of biological fixing of
 nitrogen as an example:   starting out from the study of the material basis of the
 function of nitrogen-fixing bacteria--the structure and the function of nitrogen-
 fixing enzymes--we can use the method of chemical simulation to create new types
 of catalysts, i.e., jumping from 'the commonly used synthetic ammonia catalyst that
 requires high temperature and high pressure at present to a catalyst effective under
 temperate conditions and to one effective directly under near normal temperatures
 and normal pressure.  If research in this is successful in the future, its tremendous
 influence can be imagined.  During the past 10 years, our academy has organized
 cooperative efforts together with some universities and research units of the chemical
 industry system and has realized some internationally advanced-level achievements
 in nitrogen-fixing enzymes and simulated chemical compounds.   Again, for example,
 in the study of.the nitrogen-fixing genes of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the Shanghai
 Plant Physiology Institute discovered two new nitrogen-fixing genes and contributed
 to the molecular genetics of nitrogen-fixing.  For this type of basic theoretical
 research which has possibilities for future production, we must be farsighted, we
 must have courage, and we must have the stamina to persist and to continue the
 effort.
 Applied Research.  Applications research can also be divided into two groups.
 Some basic research efforts, when they have progressed to a definite stage,.can be
 linked to actual production, and new applied research can be opened up.  This means
 that basic applied research can open up new ways for new materials, new methods and
 new techniques.  When talking about new techniques of breeding, we have utilized

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 the new methods and new techniques of theories and methods of genetics and cytology
 to develop pollen culture, isolated female propagation, cultivation and detoxification
 using the tips of the potato stems to produce nontoxic stock seeds, transplanting
 the fertilized ovum of domesticated animals using the techniques used in transplanting
 the cell nucleus to cultivate hybrid fish of different genera or subfamilies of
 fish.  Some of these already have established methods and some have already produced
 new varieties.  In hormone research, we have mainly utilized new advances in
 biochemistry and physiology to develop oxytocin, sex hormones for many kinds of
 domesticated animals, insect moulting hormone and juvenile hormone, and information
 hormones for many kinds of insects or sex hormones, all of which have been used
 in production.  For example, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and similar
 substances are widely used in stimulating sexual activity and ovulation of
 domesticated fish; they have more effectively solved the problem of artificial
 cultivation of fish fry of domesticated fish in our nation, and such efforts have
 attracted great international interest. The sexual exogenic hormones of the
 dendrolimus punctatus and the meadow caterpillar have been separated, isolated,
 purified and artificially synthesized.  Similar work has not been reported by foreign
 nations yet.  In virological research, we have established serum diagnostic
 techniques such as coagulation by the principle of conversion and tagging of
 enzymic union, and we have helped many provinces and cities to determine and discover
 many new pathogens.  We have also developed methods of prevention and control in
 diagnosis, prevention and control of the weak plant line of the mosaic viral disease
 of tobacco, preparation of the heliothis nucleopolyhedrosis virus, viral insecticide
 of the mulberry caterpillar, and the polyhedrosis virus of the domesticated
 silkworm.  In addition, a multiple antimycin antibotic has been successfully
 developed.  It possesses a broad spectrum and is effective against many types of
 diseases.  On the basis of physiological and ecological studies and the regional
 systems classification of algae and in combination with the needs of production,
 seven types of nitrogen-fixing blue green algae that propagate quickly, that fix
 a large amount of nitrogen, and that have a.strong adaptability have been selected
 and successfully popularized over large areas in Hubei for many years, and they
 have opened up new sources of fertilizers for the rice fields.  The achievements in
 these field-: of research have mostly been developed and realized first by our
 academy within our nation, and like basic research, they have manifested the unique
 character of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  But we should also realize that
 although a fairly large part of these achievements has joined the ranks of
 internationally advance achievements, these fields of research have mostly been
 created abroad, showing that the level of our nation's biology is still not high,
 basic theoretical study still has to be strengthened.  At the same time, it may
 also be possible that some basic theoretical researchers do not take the initiative
 to connect their own research with actual production, thus burying the research
 fields or topics which could be connected to actual production.  Attention should be
 given to this.
 There is another type of research that specifically aims at problems now existing
 in agricultural production and that it studies and solves concrete production tasks.
 For example, soil fertilizers, agricultural zoning, surveying of wasteland,
 improvement of high-yielding'paddy rice soil, manufacturing pelletizers for ammonium
 bicarbonate, studying trace elements, improving saline and alkaline soil, forestation,
 planting grass, and stabilizing sand have all served a function in production.

 in breeding there are multiple spike corn and soybean disease-resistant varieties.
 In plant protection, an organic phosphorous insecticide phoxin that is highly
 efficient, has low toxicity, and has a broad spectrum been developed, and it has
 produced outstanding results in the prevention and control of lepidoptera and.
 ,coieoptera insect pests.  Through the study of the ecology of harmful rodents in
 grassland, a new and effective method of exterminating the rodents has been proposed.
 The study of high and stable yields of cultured fish in Donghu in Wuchang has
 resulted in the proposal of key measures to increase the yield.  The study of
 fermentation of methane in farm villages has led to the proposal of a series of
 measures to utilize the raw materials and to increase the percentage of production
 of methane gas.  The study of plant resources has led to the successful introduction
 from abroad over the past 10 years of more than 40 varieties of plants, including
 the cyamopsis tetragonoloba which has important economic value, and the survey and
 discovery of many types of domestically produced wild plants that have important
 economic significance.  The simulation experiment of many kinds of tropical plant
 colonies of the rubber-tea multiple strata has been successful and has been
 popularized.  Such applied research has tended to become weaker in recent years and
 we must give it attention.  For example, comprehensive control of drought, waterlogging,
 salinity and alkalinity in the Huanghe, the Huai River and the Hai River; water and
 soil retention in the middle reaches of the Huanghe; the ecology of harmful insect
 pests and comprehensive prevention and control; the physiology of agricultural crops
 and measures to increase yields--all these major achievements were realized before
 the."cultural revolution," but now this type of research is not grasped as tightly
 as before.
 Developmental Work.  Some of the research achievements mentioned have been handed
 over to the agricultural and forestry departments, some can be directly popularized
 and utilized, and some must be coordinated with the local agricultural science
 research units and the people.'s communes so that they can participate in the
 development.   In recent years a lot of developmental work has been done.   For example,
 the propagation of virus-free pedigree potato seeds has won the support of the
 agricultural departments, and a pedigree seed farm has been established with the
 cooperation of such units as the Agricultural Science Institute of the Ulanqab
 League of Nei Monggol and in particular with the localities.  Again for example,
 ammonium bicarbonate easily evaporates and easily cakes, the loss of fertility is
 great, and the application is inconvenient.  The Nanjing Pedology Institute handed
 its research achievement and ideas to the Jintan Farm Tools Plant early and developed
 a pelletizer, making it convenient for deep application and for increasing the
 effectiveness of fertilization.  With the support of the State Planning Commission,
 the institute and the plant joined with the Ministry of Chemical Industry to hold a
 nationwide field conference and ogranized batch production and popularization.
 The development of nitrogen-fixing blue green algae, development of the diagnostic
 method of soil nutrition and the diagnosis box, and the fermentation of methane gas
 were carried out early and well, on the one hand because of the attention paid to
 them by concerned scientific and technical personnel who actively went to the
 frontline of production to work, and on the other hand because of the massive support
 by the concerned departments which undertook the organization and leadership.
 Achievements in scientific research are not easily obtained, it would be a pity if
 they could be applied in production but still were not popularized.  Now, many
 achievements still have not been popularized or are still not fully popularized and
 applied;  this is a widespread problew.

 Related Problems That Require Attention and Solution
 In order that biological research can better serve agricultural modernization, the
 following prcbleMs must he handled well.
 Increase the Understanding of Serving Agriculture.  We must fully understand that
 our nation has 1 billion people, including 800 million farmers, and the national
 foundation is weak.  Biology is a basic science among the agricultural sciences.
 In "the two services," biological research should in particular conscientiously
 implement the guideline of taking agriculture as the foundation.in developing our
 national economy.  The situation in the farm villages at present is good, the
 probler; of the agricultural production responsibility system has basically been
 solved, the productive enthusiasm of the farmers is very high, and the farmers
 urgently need science.  At the same time, our nation's strength in agricultural
 science Is weak and agricultural science is relatively backward.  Therefore,
 biological workers must face this fact and the need, increase the enthusiasm to serve
 agriculture and to contribute appropriately toward the modernization of agriculture.
 This is a glorious task that must not be shunned.
 Correctly Recognize the Proportion and the Relationship Among the Three Types of
 Research.  The guideline of "two emphases, two services" must be treated dialectically.
 Basic research and applied research are mutually connected, mutually promoting, and
 mutually convertible.  For example, the synthesis of oxytocin of domesticated fish,
 the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and similar substances were the results
 of possessing the basic level theoretical research achievements of artificial synthesis
 techniques, and the development toward the new field of applied research of polypeptide
 synthesis and obtaining a series of polypeptide hormones for agricultural and medical
 use.  They have been welcomed by the production departments, and some have even
 attracted great interest internationally.  During the course of broad application of
 the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, some new theoretical problems which
 require solution have also been discovered; for example, the question of the structure
 of LRH in fish and the point of action of LRH in the central nervous system.
 The Academy of Sciences, as the highest academic natural sciences organization in the
 nation, undoubtedly should carry out additional basic research.  Biological workers
 engaged in basic research can dedicate their whole lives to research; at the same time,
 when some basic research efforts develop to the stage where they can be converted
 to applied research, then this conversion should be advocated and encouraged,
 especially those basic research projects which can open up new fields of application.
 Applied research carried out by biological research units constitutes about half of
 all research effort;, and most of it is related to agriculture.  Applied research
 should mainly be based on the needs of agricultural modernization to study and solve
 major scientific and technical problems of a key nature.  In recent years, applied
 research serving agriculture has tended to lessen.   At the same time, among the
 subjects serving agriculture, there are more requiring long periods of exploration
 and  loss which can he applied in the short term.   In addition, there are few major
 comprehensive scientific and technical problems being studied.  This is an important
 problem of the task of readjusting the direction of research.  Whether in basic
 research or in applied research, the Chinese Academy of Sciences must insist on "the
 two emphases" before "two services" can be realized better.  "Two emphases" must take
 the international level as the standard, but we must also start out from the actual
 situation; in our nation; we cannot deviate from the actual situation and condition
 in our nation.

 {:;  }~as.ize Uevrl~-{~men~ril  Work.   In lot of scientific research achievements,' when they
 are moved from the        1,dioratory and expcrimental fields to the large fields or the
 factories, because of different situations and conditions there is frequently a
 progression of research, a process from imperfection to gradual perfection.  This type
 of developmental work frequently requires direct participation by the scientific and
 technical personnel before the research results can be converted to productivity.
 Developmental work is frequently complex and difficult because it involves our
 nation's level of production, economic conditions, coordination between departments
 and regions, the working level of popularization system, the farmer's cultural level
 and various similar factors.  The difficulty of agricultural popularization even
 affects some scientific and technical personnel who are not willing to engage in
 applied research related to agriculture, and of course this also affects their
 enthusiasm in participating in developmental work.  To better serve agriculture, we
 cannot unilaterally emphasize that developmental work pertains only to the agricultural
 departments, we must not retreat in the face of difficulties, we must enthusiastically
 apply research results in production according to need.  We must conscientiously help
 research personnel engaged in developmental work to solve their actual difficulties.
 There are more difficulties in field and farm village work:  scientific and technical
 personnel must increase their conscientiousness and enthusiasm in going into the
 billages and the fields to work.  At the same time, scientific management personnel
 must help solve the actual difficulties, such as working conditions, living conditions,
 family care, operations and foreign-language learning periods.
 Research Results Serving Agriculture Must Be Properly Evaluated.  The research
 achievements. that have possibilities for application cannot be simply evaluated by
 the standard of the papers submitted:  their results in production or. their future
 for application and economic significance must be sufficiently observed.  We must
 also see the hardships of applied research work in agriculture; to truly obtain'
 achievements that have important applicable value is not easy.  In evaluating the
 research grades for promotion of scientific and technical personnel who work in the
 fields or in farm villages for long periods, we must not give too much consideration
 to their foreign-language level.
 In summary, from the standpoint that biology is the basic science of agricultural
 sciences, from the standpoint of implementing the guideline of realizing national
 economic development on the basis of agriculture, from the standpoint that the 800
 million farmers now urgently need science, from the standpoint that our nation's
 agricultural sciences are relatively backward, and from the tendency of recent years
 toward a weakening of biology to serve agriculture at our academy, our academy's
 biological research should strengthen its service to agriculture; this is very
 necessary.   Each scientific discipline must fully develop its special ability,
 develop potential and make more and greater contributions.  'Biological workers must
 divide the work between themselves and agricultural science workers, coordinate with
 them closely, and walk ahead of research in agricultural science.  This is
 predetermined by the nature of the scientific discipline, this is the need for
 division of scientific discipline and coordination; in this way, the advantages can
 be developed- and the shortcomings can be avoided, the superiority can be developed,
 the unique characteristics can be domonstrated, and this can better serve
 agricultural modernization.
 Several general opinions in accordance with the actual situation of the various
 'research efforts are presented below for reference.

 about and study the present problems in agricultural production and the future of
 the development of agricultural production so that they'can present opinions or
 suggestions.
 2.  Ovcr the past several decades, basic theoretical research in biology has
 progressed rapidly internationally at a rate of development that has not been seen
 before.  At the same time, a number of rich and'varied new ways, new methods and
 new techniques with important applicable values in medical sciences and agriculture
 have been opened up by progress in basic theoretical research.  The Biology Institute
 of our academy must continue to strengthen basic theoretical research, and at the
 same time, we must convert the domestic and foreign achievements in basic theoretical
 research, including achievements in the various phases of research, to applied
 research in time in order to open up new fields, fully develop the characteristic of
 biology as the scientific foundation of agriculture and to walk one step ahead to
 contribute what biology should.
 3.  As biology serves agriculture and while implementing the "two emphases," the
 combination of the long term and the short term must also be handled well.
 Specifically, in the actual situation of the various aspects of the nation at present,
 the situation requires that we.correctly handle this problem.  Biological workers must
 care about the problems that exist in agricultural production at present, especially
 the major problems of science and technology of a key nature.  We must develop the
 superiority of our academy of being multidisciplinary, of having many technical arms
 and, being comprehensive.  We must strengthen the topics of applied research that can
 produce short-term results in order to better serve agriculture in time.
 4.  We must strengthen the necessary developmental work and utilize the research
 results in production as early as possible.  We must organize the existing and related
 research results, conduct surveys and research, and propose measures to hasten
 popularization.  Some results must be further researched, some achievements still
 have not been popularized, and some results have been popularized but progress is not
 rapid; this involves many actual problems, and scientific management personnel must
 take the responsibility for opening up the situation together in order to help
 solve the problems and difficulties in popularization work.

 'SHIJIE JINGJI DAOBAO' DISCUSSES AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
 HK150958 Shanghai SHIJIE JINGJI DAOBAO in Chinese No 57, 2 Nov 81 p 2
 [Report from Beijing:  "The Most Important Measures in China's Strategy for
 Agricultural Development"]
 [Text]  "In the past, the erroneous leftist policies of promoting a unitary
 economic element-and an unitary management form were important causes of our
 failure to achieve rapid development of agriculture in China.."  In his
 comprehensive analysis of China's strategy for agricultural development
 made at a recently held large symposium, Zhan Wu, director of the agricultural
 economics institute under the Academy of Social Sciences of China, noted
 that such policies had done great harm.  He also called for establishing
 a structure in which collective ownership holds, the dominant position and
 coexists with various economic elements, management forms and production
 responsibility systems.  This is the most important measires in China's
 strategy for agricultural development.
 At present, our country's academic circles are having lively discussions on
 issues concerning agricultural development strategy.  Zhan Wu has put forward
 his tentative plan to ensure the. realization of the goals in China's strategy
 for agricultural development.
 Respect Proprietary Rights and Self-Management Rights in the Collective Economy.
 Allow Peasants to Voluntarily Choose a Management Form.
 To define the adoption of the collective economy as the principal part of our
 long-term and stable strategy while actively developing state-operated agriculture
 and household sideline production and allowing the existence and development of
 individual. farming in given conditions, is of great importance to the strategy
 for agricultural development.  It is also imperative to respect proprietary
 rights and self-management rights in the collective economy, allow peasants
 to voluntarily choose a management form, allow the crosswise integration of
 different types of economies and allow the coexistence of diverse forms.
 The coexistence of the public economy and household sideline production for a
 long period is inevitable.  Their coexistence means that they can work in
 coordination on a reciprocal basis.  Household sideline production can play
 an important role that cannot be replaced by the public economy.  We should
 increase the proportion of household sideline production in agriculture.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 Referring to foreign economies, than Wu noted:  there are three economic forms
 among the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries; the economic form with
 the state-owned economy as its main part (the Soviet Union); the economic
 form with the collective economy as its main part (Hungary); and the economic
 pattern with the individual economy as its main part (Poland).  Practice has
 proved that the Hungarian economic form with the collective economy as its
 main part has achieved better results.
 Abandon the Predatory Form of Management and Establish a Good Agricultural
 Ecosystem
 We must conscientiously adopt the viewpoint of an ecological balance in
 directing all agriculture (including farming, forestry, animal husbandry and
 fishery) and gradually transform vicious circles into beneficial ones.  From
 a long-term point of view, this approach will be one that is characterized by
 small investments and greater returns.
 We should comprehensively implement the policy on simultaneously developing
 farming, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery.  Farmers
 must completely abandon the predatory form of management, implement the principle
 of paying equal attention to both using the soil and nourishing the soil, and
 properly apply crop rotation and reverse cropping.  Farmers must also attach
 importance to integrating modern science and technology with traditional farming
 and. to the integration of organic farming and inorganic farming.  By doing so,
 our country's agricultural development will be characterized by low consumption,
 low costs and great beneficial results.
 Our country's current percentage of forest cover is 50 percent lower than the
 average world level.  It will take great effort to raise China's current
 12.7 percent of forest cover to 20 or 30 percent by the year 2000.  At present,
 the crux of the matter is that we must put the stress on planting forests to
 be utilized as fuel and fast-growing timber forests so as to meet the peasant
 households' demands for firewood and timber.  This is where we can open a speech
 to terminate vicious ecological cycles.  An effective way to quicken the pace at
 which trees are planted everywhere is to arrange specialized afforestation
 contracts including contracts made with specialized households for afforestation
 and forest protection.  Those barren hills which the state-run or collective
 units are unable to open up should be given to commune members as hills for
 their personal use so as to mobilize every household to engage in afforestation.
 Nearly half of our country's pastures have deteriorated due to exceeding the
 stock capacity and our neglecting the building of pastures.  From now on, we
 must strictly set stock capacity limits, establish a pasture responsibility
 system or assign pastures for the personal use of commune members.
 In our reservoirs, we should develop fish farming and plant water caltrops so
 that aquatic products can feed on one another.

 Our offshore and freshwater fishing resources have suffered astonishing sabotage.
 The way out for our fishery at present and for quite a long time to come lies
 in artificial breeding.  We must implement the principle of integrating breeding
 with fishing, with the emphasis on breeding.  We must stipulate restricted
 fishing times and restricted fishing zones so as to protect our offshore
 fishery.
 Readjust the Unitary Ecological Structure of Agriculture.  Restore Our Rural
 Economy's Organic Relationships
 On the basis of maintaining a stable increase in the total grain output, we must
 gradually increase the proportions of industrial crops, forestry, animal
 husbandry, sideline production, fishery, industry, commerce and transportation
 in the value of output, the area of land utilized and the disposition of labor.
 Thus, we will be able to establish a rural agricultural economic structure in
 which there is a close integration of grain and industrial crops, farming is
 closely integrated with forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and
 fishery, and there is combined development of farming, industry, commerce and
 transportation.
 During the 1979-1980 period, although over 60 million mu of farmland had been
 switched from growing grain to growing industrial crops or planting trees, the
 total grain output during this period reached the highest level in the history
 of the PRC.  This has proved that the above-mentioned guiding principles are
 completely feasible.
 We should make use of farming's reciprocal relationships with forestry, animal
 husbandry, sideline production and fishery in order to quicken the pace of
 developing agriculture and particularly the pace of developing forestry, animal
 husbandry, sideline production, fishery.and other diversified undertakings.
 The unified management of the production, the processing, the sale and the
 transportation of agricultural products is essentially aimed at changing
 disjointed rules and regulations of the irrational management systems and
 restoring the dialectical relationships inherent in these sectors of the rural
 economy.  This is a strategic measure to rationalize our rural economic structure
 and our rural management system.
 Restore Our Socialist Agricultural Commodity Economy and Establish Agricultural
 Products Bases
 At present, our country's net agricultural commodity rate is only 30 percent
 while the average net agricultural commodity rate in developed countries is
 over 90 percent.  Compared with developed countries, we still have a long way
 to' go.
 In order to develop commodity production, first of all, in making overall produc-
 tion arrangements, we must gradually realize regional, specialized and intensive
 management and establish agricultural products bases; secondly, we must devote
 major efforts to developing a diversified economy and agricultural product
 processing industries and support the development of specialized households and
 their integrated units.

 The so-called "chopper-whip policy" for purchasing agricultural products-when
 there are not enough agricultural products, "the whip is used for gathering
 together enough agricultural products"; if there are too many agricultural
 products, "the chopper is used for chopping off surplus agricultural products"--
 has been a great obstacle to the development of a commodity economy.  This shows
 that reforming the circulation system and structure is a-task which brooks no
 delay.
 Attach Importance to Investment in Education and Change the Rural Situation
 in Which Educational and Scientific Levels Are Low and Technological Management
 Is Bad
 To realize the modernization of agriculture, we cannot just pay attention to
 intensifying labor.  What is more important is to pay attention to intensifying
 technology and scientific knowledge.
 Our past neglect of investment in education has had serious consequences.  The
 current educational and scientific levels and the current management standard
 of the broad masses of commune members and cadres at the basic level are very
 low.   Moreover, 30 percent of our rural youngsters and people who are in the
 prime of life [aged between 30 and 50], are illiterate.  These are great
 difficulties in developing our rural technological forces.
 At present, we must do well in eliminating illiteracy, reform our agricultural
 educational structure and system and strengthen secondp.ry technical education
 and the spare-time technical education for peasants.

 COMMENTATOR ON SCIENCE, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
 HK100839 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 8 Dec 81 p 3
 [Commentator's article:  "With Agriculture Relying on Science, the Emphasis Is on
 Popularization"]
 [Text] The development of agriculture relies on policies and science.  This is an important
 policy decision made by the CCP Central Committee and the State Council.  While gradually
 perfecting the various forms of responsibility systems, we must at the same time conscientiously
 settle the question of the reliance of agriculture on science.
 The reliance of agriculture on science involves many fields and there is a lot of work to
 be done.  Departments concerned with agricultural science and farming techniques and
 leadership at various levels in the countryside must at present put the emphasis on
 popularizing the existing achievements of agricultural science and farming techniques.
 As a result of the efforts made by the broad masses of researchers in agricultural science
 over the years, our country has already accumulated some achievements in agricultural
 science and technology.  Many of them have already been popularized and applied, but
 looking at the country as a whole, the work of popularization and application is still
 not very ideal.  According to the statistics of departments concerned, even in those
 areas in which popularization has been properly carried out, only about half of the
 existing achievements have been popularized and applied.  In other areas, generally,
 70 to 80 percent of the achievements have still not been applied in production.  At the
 same time, the masses of peasants have an urgent need for science and technology, and
 they long for the agricultural scientists and technicians to help them in scientific
 farming and in scientific development of a diversified economy.
 The success of the work of popularization will not only satisfy. as quickly as possible,
 the need for the peasants to study science and technology and enable the existing
 scientific and technological achievements to quickly produce economic results, but it
 will also give an impetus to agricultural research.
 Whether or not an achievement can be popularized depends on whether or not it can produce
 good economic results and whether or not it is welcomed by the peasants.  This requires
 the personnel engaged in agricultural research to go deep into production practice, select
 a proper research subject and produce a really mature and f irst-rate achievement.  The
 reasons why the improved strains of "long-grained hybrid rice" and "Shandong cotton
 No 1" can be popularized over an extensive area  within a short time are their out-
 standing economic results and. their keen reception by the peasants.  An important reason
 why many of the scientific and technological achievements cannot be popularized at present
 is that they are divorced from the actual needs of the peasants or because they are not
 first class and cannot be fitted into the system.  Therefore, placing the emphasis on
 popularization will not only be a test for agricultural research, but will also provide
 an impetus to agricultural research.   -

 of them are mainly engaged in t e wor  o  pope ar iing agr:cu tura  techniques.  There
 are also several hundred thousand personnel partly released from productive labor
 engaged in popularizing agricultural techniques and nearly a million peasant technicians.
 In the past, because we had for a long time practiced the policy of "everyone eating
 from the same big pot," the peasants had no enthusiasm for studying and applying science
 and thus the role of these agricultural scientists, technicians and popularizers also
 could not be brought into play.  Now, with the implementation of the production respon-
 sibility system, these people have become much sought after.  However, they still exper-
 ience a great many difficulties in actual work and they still lack scientific organization.
 To make a success of the work of popularizing the achievements of agricultural science
 and technology, we must urge leadership at various levels in the countryside to con-
 scientiously study and solve these problems so that the enthusiasm of the personnel
 engaged in popularizing agricultural techniques can be brought into play and so that
 a scientific system of popularizing agricultural techniques can be gradually set up.
 The work of popularizing is a key link between research and application.  If this work
 is not properly carried out, regardless of how many or how good the achievements may be,
 they cannot be translated into actual production.  We must get rid of the viewpoint
 of despising the work of popularizing and strengthen the ties between the research
 units and the departments in charge of popularizing.   Generally speaking, agricultural
 research units have greater technological capabilities and are more conversant with
 various key measures for increasing production and knotty problems in production.
 Personnel who have been engaged in the work of popularizing agricultural techniques for
 a long time have accumulated a great deal of experience and they understand the local
 conditions of agricultural production and the needs of the people.  They must learn from
 and help each other and work together.  Departments in charge of popularizing should
 consult research departments on their own initiative regarding the new achievements
 and techniques already affirmed and popularized.  Research departments should also
 actively participate in the popularization and dissemination of technology, provide
 technical training and make a success of the work of popularizing techniques together.
 In short, we must resolutely overcome the phenomenon of research and popularization
 splitting up, not communicating with each other and working separately.
 Agriculture relies on science, and the emphasis is on popularization. Once this objective
 has been defined, departments concerned with agricultural science and farming techniques,
 agricultural colleges and schools and the broad masses of agricultural scientists and
 technicians at various levels will be able to work with one heart and fully bring their
 abilities into play, and a new situation will appear in China's agricultural production.

 WAN LI STRESSES AGROTECHNOLOGY POPULARIZATION
 OW050229 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 1257 GMT 4 Jan 82
 [Text]  Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- Comrade Wan Li said today:  A very lovely and
 gratifying situation is now emerging in our rural areas.  Many peasants have realized,
 from production experience, that science and technology is a productive force, and they
 want to study and use science.  Party committees at all levels and scientific and technical
 circles should fully recognize this situation, stay ahead of it, lead the peasants in
 acquiring scientific and technical knowledge and promote an excellent situation.
 Comrade Wan Li made these remarks when he met participants in an experience-exchanging
 meeting on agricultural (including diversified undertakings) and technical contracts
 now being held.  Responsible persons of concerned ministries and commissions of the
 State Council and some agricultural specialists were present.
 Comrade Wan Li said:  I am all for summing up experience in the responsibility system
 of agricultural-technical contracts and I hope that this activity can be continually
 improved and popularized on the basis of experience.  He said among the 10 principles
 for our country's economic construction,, the first is to develop agriculture.. Unless
 agriculture is given first priority and made the foundation, the four modernizations are
 out of the question.  The development of agriculture will rely on correct policies and on
 science.  Policies are also science, that is, social science. In a word, we must rely on
 science to develop agriculture, solve the problems of feeding and clothing 1 billion
 people and of China's economic development.
 Comrade Wan Li said the Chinese peasants have accumulated a wealth of production experiences.
 .Scientists should integrate with peasants, combine our country's traditional agricultural
 technique and experience with modern science and technology and blaze a new trail for
 agricultural modernization suited to China's conditions.
 He said:  Do not look down on technical experts and skilled craftsmen among the peasants.
 They, and specialized scientific and technical personnel graduated from institutions of
 higher learning, plus a considerable number of middle school students, constitute an
 important agrotechnical force.  We should get them organized, in various ways, to
 jointly tackle key scientific and technical problems and put their knowledge to use
 where most needed for agricultural development.  The government should give material
 support.
 Comrade Wan Li especially stressed the importance of popularizing agricultural science
 and technology.  He said now that the peasants' enthusiasm for production has been
 aroused, they also need a scientific approach.   We should adopt different methods to
 energetically popularize agricultural science and technology so that those who exercise
 leadership over agriculture and those actually engaged in agricultural production will
 both have a certain amount of scientific and technical knowledge in agriculture.
 At the meeting,- Comrade.Wan 1.i was briefed by the participants on the development of
 agricultural-technical contract activities.

 [Text]  The Provincial Science and Technology Commission yesterday convened a
 province-wide meeting of the general membership in the Guangdong Hall of Science
 for the issuance of awards for scientific and-technical achievements.  Awards
 were made for 147 outstanding scientific and technical achievements during 1978
 and 1979, and to three advanced research units.  The 325 units that participated
 in this research received certificates of honor, and 867 scientists and technicians
 received certificates of accomplishment and reward money.  This marks the first
 time that province-wide material rewards have been made for scientific and tech-
 nical accomplishments.
 Since the All-China Science Congress, the broad masses of scientists and techni-
 cians in Guangdong Province have liberated their thoughts and applied their wisdom
 and creativeness to contribute to four modernizations construction so that large
 numbers of accomplishments in science and technology have emerged, and the quality
 -f Scientific research has improved markedly.  The categories for which rewards
 were made on this occasion were all of advanced levels for the province for which
 results in application were quite good.  Following recommendations from various
 departments in each prefecture, municipality and the province, plus appraisal by
 others in the same lines of work, the Provincial Science Commission approved
 issuance of the rewards.  Of the total number, 25 were in the field of agriculture,
 102 in industry, and 20 in medicine and health.  Ninety-five percent resulted,
 from applied research, and some have shown remarkable economic benefits.  China
 was first to pioneer some of these achievements, or hold a leading position in
 them.  First prize went to Huang Yaoxiang [7806 5069 4382] and colleagues at the

 SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SYSTEM REFORMED IN SICHUAN
 Beijing GUANGMING RIBAO in Chinese 23 Sep 80 p 1
 [Article:  "Sichuan Province  Decides To Reform Further the Present System of
 Scientific Research"]
 [Text]  Reporter Li Jiajie [2621 1367 26381 reports that scientific research
 units of industrial departments and scientific research units concerned mainly
 with applied research are gradually putting into effect a changeover to an
 enterprise-oriented system of management.  Specialized research institutes
 where techniques are applied and enterprises are forming combined companies,
 enabling the institute to become the company's technical development department.
 This represents a decision made most recently by the Sichuan Provincial CCP
 Committee to change the presently operating system of scientific research--a
 system that is not advantageous for bringing into full play the enthusiasm of
 scientific research units.
 The, reform carried out by the Sichuan Provincial CCP Committee on the system
 of management of scientific research was proposed on the basis of experience
 gained from giving the province's scientific research units as a whole more
 autonomy.  Based on the Central Committee principle that scientific research
 is a necessary precursor to building the economy, and in accordance with the
 specific suggestions of the provincial science committee, the Sichuan Provin-
 cial CCP Committee decided to select scientific research units that have com-
 paratively good conditions and, at the same time as carrying out pilot projects
 in changing over to an enterprise-oriented management, adopted the following
 measures, advanced and promoted the scientific research units' attempt to
 broaden its autonomy, and attained the objective of realizing a reform of the
 system of scientific research as quickly as possible:
 First, research institutes (including research units of the national defense
 industry and institutes of higher learning) themselves have the right to select
 specialized factories suited to the work intended and, following consultations,
 to put into effect combined management under the conditions that have been
 laid down.  The factory is responsible for the tasks of carrying out the inter-
 mediary testing and formally going into production, based on the research results
 obtained by research institutes; the institutes are responsiblP for providing
 the factory with results of the research and with suggestions for new products,
 and for directing the factory in proceeding with the remaking of its technology.

 Second, specialized scientific research institutes can, according to the
 reforms of our economic system, enter into a combined company organized by
 an enterprise in their own field, becoming the company's technical service
 department.
 Third, in matters of scientific research, technical servicing, scientific and
 technological intelligence, and the production of new, or scarce items (the
 reform] will break down the barriers between the people as a whole and the
 collectives, the Central Committee versus the various areas, between military
 and civilian units, between institutes of higher learning and scientific re-
 search units, among scientific research units, and between scientific research
 units and production units or schools.  This will allow the natural advantages
 of each unit to be brought into full play, making use of the best that each has
 to offer and developing coordination among them.
 Fourth, the banks will grant loans to the scientific research units.  The speci-
 fic method is for the banks to give support by providing funds to scientific
 research projects of a developmental nature that are definitely able to go into
 production within a short period of time, that will derive an economic income
 from the production unit, and that can guarantee repayment of the loan on time.
 Fifth, after experience is gained from the pilot projects, scientific and tech-
 nical personnel can be allowed to operate within a specified sphere.  This repre-
 sents a thorough change from the management of scientific and technical personnel
 in the past, in which their duties were very specific, and particularly is a
 change as regards scientific and technical personnel being the common property
 of all.  Thus, if an individual unit does not have need of someone's expertise,
 the unit will be prevented from not making his services available to others.
 During the pilot phase, scientific and technical personnel from the scientific
 research units, engineering and technical personnel from the production units,
 and teaching personnel from the schools will be allowed to work at each other's
 facilities or be employed by each other as advisers.  One might also, without
 changing one's address registration, receive an appointment to take on scien-
 tific research, technical work, or teaching work in an outlying area.

 [Article by Correspondent.Xie Junbao [6200 6511 1032]:  "Reform Management Systems
 for Promotion of the Development of Research.  Ten Shanghai Research Institutes
 Achieve Outstanding Results Through Broadened Autonomy"]
 [Text]  Since last year, a total of 10 institutes in Shanghai, including five
 regional institutes and five institutes under academies of central government
 departments have had broader autonomy over methods of economic management such as
 planning, finances, employee awards, and solicitation of employment applications,
 as well as the institution of a joint system of research.  Within a single year's
 time, outstanding results have been received.
 Fulfillment of scientific research tasks has been promoted.  According to statistics
 from the five regional institutes given increased autonomy, last year's accomplish-
 ments on 103 research items exceeded original plans by 15.7 percent, for an in-
 crease of 90.7 percent over 1979.  During the first half of this year, there was
 a further increase of 54.8 percent over last year.
 Management of scientific research and economic accounting have been enhanced.
 Following the broadening of autonomy, these test units all strengthened their
 management over scientific research, established and perfected research discipline,
 and instituted systems of budgeting for research problems, final accountings, and
 research problem cost accounting.  In the case of the Shanghai Materials Institute,
 an accounting card was used for each issuance of research funds for problems.
 Scientists and technicians used these cards to keep their books, and no matter
 whether expenditures were for materials, for processing, or in connection with
 experiments, all were written down as part of cost accounting.  This effectively
 changed the situation in which currency had been spent casually and materials
 requested at will without regard for economic effectiveness.
 Income has vastly increased from research and production.  According to statistics
 from the five test site institutes, increased income from research and production
 last year amounted to 6.52 million yuan, a 72.8 percent increase over 1978.  During
 the first half of this year, there was another increase of 31 percent over last
 year.  The Shanghai Machine Manufacturing Technology Institute and the Shanghai
 Organic Florine Materials Institute had an income last year that was greater than
 expenditures.  Not only did they require no public funds, but they paid profits
 to higher authorities.

 Further arousal of the enthusiasm of researchers.  As a result of the expansion
 in autonomy and the institution of apportionment of increases in income, the
 institutes have funds for the development of their own research, for their collec-
 tive welfare, and for awards to employees.  All of these units have instituted
 a system of awards for employees.' Some institutes have allocated some of their
 collective welfare funds for the construction of dwellings for their employees,
 and these have enhanced the morale of the scientists and technicians.
 On 25 September, the Shanghai Municipal Science Commission convened a citywide
 conference of leading scientific and technical cadres to summarize the experi-
 ences of these units and to call upon other research units to undertake reforms
 in a planned and measured way, continuing the widening of autonomy and the system
 of reforms in the management of research.

 SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM PUTS PROPOSALS TO GOVERNMENT
 OW091314 Beijing XINHUA in English 1240 GMT 9 Dec 80
 (Text) Hefei, December 9 (XINHUA)-More than 500 delegates to a recent
 national science symposium here have proposed more active participation
 by scientists in the country's planning.
 Among the proposals they put to the government are:
 --That the state and provincial authorities establish advisory centers to
 help with policy and decision making.
 --That a committee of specialists be set up to plan and submit to the
 government projects for China's scientific, technological and social
 development.
 --That scientists and technicians have greater mobility and free choice
 of jobs.
 --That the government give more money for science and education and
 encourage the development of talented people.
 --That the State Scientific and Technological Commission should seek
 advice from specialists on improvements in the administration of the
 country's scientific programs.
 --That academies and other higher learning establishments should train
 people for top administrative posts.
 The eight-day symposium dealt with three scientific disciplines which
 have attracted much attention in China in recent years.
 The subjects are the science of sciences (the study of the laws governing
 science and technology and their relationship to social phenomena--also
 known in the United States as the "sociology of science"), futureology
 and rencaiology (the study of making the best use of people with special
 training).

 The scientists debated how these disciplines are related to social studies,
 economics, management, military affairs, education, medicine and planning
 of China's current drive for modernization.  More than 300 papers were pre-
 sented at the symposium.
 The scientists also discussed the scientific methodology of policy-making,
 future problems likely to confront the Chinese Communist Party, and the
 education of gifted children, and the future composition of the country's
 leadership.

 PRESENT, FUTURE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC DECISIONMAKING
 Beijing GUANGMING RIBAO in Chinese 16 Dec 80 p 3
 [Article by Wang Shouyun [3769 1108 0061]: "Using Science and Technology To Realize
 the 'Scientification' of Policymaking"]
 [Text]  "Scientification of decisionmaking" is a phrase devised to explain the ar-
 gument of the "artistic" method versus the experience method of decisionmaking.  Of
 course, condemnation for issuing willful and confused orders is also implied.
 In 1806, the Prussian military reformist Gerhard Johann David Von Scharnhorst created
 the general staff system, with which he expected to raise military decisionmaking
 from a kind of "art" to a field of science.  The French scientist Andre Marie
 Ampare proposed the need of a science to study the state management in a book he
 published in 1845.   In the past two centuries, many have tried to improve the method
 of making decisions, in an attempt to cause decisionmaking to be less and less a
 matter of "art" and more and more a matter of science.
 Scientific decisionmaking was adopted the earliest in the realm of military command.
 Scientification of military command decisions means a scientific system of informa-
 tion decisionmaking and a system of advisory staff.policy determination, as well as
 the quantification of the method of decisionmaking itself.  The process of scienti-
 fication of military command decisionmaking has had a profound effect on the pro-
 cess of scientification of decisionmaking in the realms of society, economy, and
 political affairs.
 Shortcomings exist in China's current system of making political and economic
 decisions, but if the knowledge means, and organizational methods of national
 defense science and technology, which China has developed and mastered, are fully
 utilized, it will be possible to overcome these shortcomings and an important step
 toward scientification of decisionmaking will have been realized.
 Military information technology should be adopted to serve the scientification of
 civilian decisionmaking as quickly as possible.
 For the purpose of making decisions, it is necessary to use a certain method to
 gather, process, transmit, and utilize information--i.e., to establish a certain
 information system.  The military information system is the earliest to be estab-
 lished and the most efficient.  The oldest system of transmitting intelligence data
 and orders is the fenghuotai [beacon fire] and the message dispatcher.  The command

 headquarters, using telegraph lines, is a system established in the middle of the
 19th century.   Early in the 20th century, the general headquarters system using
 radio telecommunications technology was established.  Toward the end of the 1950's,
 .the modern command control system using electronic computers and a data transmis-
 sion network was developed.  The above is a simple picture of the development of
 the military information system.
 In May 1980, China organized the information system of commanding the launching of
 a carrier rocket in the Pacific Ocean.  This is a type of nationwide information
 system managed through the use of electronic computers.  It uses electronic com-
 puters and multiple data transmission channels, and it proceeds in a timely manner
 with the gathering, coding, transmission, editing, storage, searching, dispatch,
 and display of related information di:-,tributed in information sources all over the
 country to supply the needs of decisionmaking or to store in a central data bank to
 be randomly accessible to the decisionmaking organization.  The efficiency of the
 process between information and decisionmaking is thus greatly improved.
 In developed capitalist countries, this type of information system, managed by com-
 puters, was first developed by the military command department and extended to the
 departments of industry, finance, commerce, trade, and administration at the begin-
 ning of the 1960's.  Similar "command control centers" were established to form the
 information management system for the purpose of supplying information to manage-
 ment.  At present, China remains backward with respect to gathering, transmitting,
 processing, and utilizing management information.  Statistical data are incomplete,
 inaccurate, not very reliable, and slow in transmission and feedback; these short-
 comings often cause erros in management decisionmaking.  The technology of the
 command information system of defense technology experiments which has been mastered
 in China can be extended for civilian use to help establish-an information manage-
 ment system for large enterprises, or even an information system of the entire
 national economic construction, so that a firm material foundation may be laid for
 scientification of decisionmaking.
 Organize and establish a general staff decisionmaking.mechanism with the participa-
 tion of scientists and engineers.
 At the beginning of the 19th century, a relatively perfect general staff system was
 created for Prussian troops, indicating that there was a need at that time for the
 military commanders' decisionmaking process to be supported by the collective wis-
 dom of the staff.  This is the first important development of the staff decision-
 making mechanism.     During World War II,, there was a massive struggle on both sides
 to develop, deploy, and apply advanced military technology.  Scientists and engineers
 were in urgent demand to participate in the decisionmaking process.  At that time,
 there were no fewer than 700 scientists and engineers engaged in the work of stra-
 tegy and policy research in the United States, England, and Canada.  Their work
 had a profound effect on the participation of scientists and engineer in the de-
 cisionmaking service after the war in every country.  Scientists and engineers as
 a'body became part of the decisionmaking process.  This was the second important
 development in the staff decisionmaking mechanism.  In 1948, the U.S. Air Force
 created the Rand Corporation.  In the 1950's, China's departmen.  of defense tech-
 nology established a system engineering general design organization.  These re-
 present two types of effective forms of development. These two forms, as well as
 the ordinary form of general staff, are indispensable for a complete staff de-
 cisionmaking mechanism.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 The Rand Corporation is a research organization set up to provide technical service
 for strategic decisionmaking.  It studies new concepts, new ideas, new theories,
 and new methods for the realization of optimal decisionmaking.  It uses the re-
 sults of its'own research to enrich the wisdom of decisionmaking agencies.  The
 results of its research have had profound effects on the formation and develop-
 ment of U.S. strategic theories and national defense policies.                  The Rand Corporation
 has become an indispensable "think tank" in the decisionmaking chain of U.S. mili-
 tary, political, foreign, and social affairs.
 In the 1950's, when China moved forward her plan of developing sophisticated de-
 fense technology, a new type of staff mechanism--a general design organization of
 system engineering--was established.  It has made important contribution to China's
 success in artificial satellite and guidance missile plans.  This general design
 organization is to provide technical service for strategic decisionmaking.  It
 takes a series of moves required for the realization of a specific planned goal,
 considers them to be systems with strict organizational structures, and proceeds
 with the programming, design, execution, and coordination so as to guarantee that
 in the decisionmaking system, every tactic is technically and economically feasible
 and all tactics are mutually coordinated to the extent that certain standards may
 be used to determine the optimal form to realize the goal being planned.  It de-
 signs the technical route to realize the specific plan, the technical program, and
 the structure of the target system.  Based upon this type of movement strategy,
 the decisionmaking agency makes choices and implements the final decision.  When
 Zhou Enlai was alive, he had hopes of applying the experience of the general design
 organization to important engineering constructions of the national economy.  Most
 recently, Chinese scientists and technicians proposed the establishment of a general
 design organization for the national economy, so as to extend the object of appli-
 cation of the general design organization from individual military engineering pro-
 jects or economic construction engineering planning to the overall planning of the
 national economy.  Natural scientists, social scientists, specialists of engineering
 technologies, and management specialists are to be organically organized into this
 national economy general design organization to jointly design national economic
 construction programs, which are to include industries, agriculture, transportation,
 communication, energy sources, education, science and technology, population,
 national defense, and people's livelihood, for the reference of the leadership
 agencies of the state in their policy decisionmaking process.  This type of program
 has been tested as to feasibility and has been measured and compared.  It is quanti-
 tative.  The experience of China's general design organization for the development
 of its defense science and technology can be applied to establish a general design
 organization for large-scale economic construction engineering and the national
 economy.
 Application of modern science and technology to the quantification of decisionmaking.
 Historically, many scientists, such as Archimedes, Da Vinci, Galileo, [Tadeusz]
 Reichstein, Edison, etc., all attempted to use the method of natural sciences to
 analyze war operations.  The early stage work of war analysis begot the seed's of
 new ideas.  Model methods and simulation experiment methods of natural science and
 engineering technologies are applied for the quantification of decisionmaking.
 During World War TI, large groups of scientists and engineers worked conscientiously
 and in an organized manner to cause these seeds to bloom and bear fruits.  Decision-
 making, a field traditionally dependent upon artistic skill to handle problems, has

 given birth to a science--operational research--to supply quantitative data to be
 used as bases to adopt strategies by leadership agencies regarding affairs and
 activities under their control.  As early as 1956, a group of far-sighted Chinese
 scientists established an operational research organization.  Today, it is being
 used for quantification of decisionmaking in operational research, topology, de-
 cisionmaking theory, mathematical programming, network analysis, optimal control
 theory, graphic analysis, production analysis, and forecast theory.  All of these
 have had considerable development.  In 1979, Qian Xuesen [6929 1331 2773] and Wu
 Jiapei [3527 1367 1014] proposed to apply systems engineering, which has operation-
 al research as its foundation, to the macroeconomic movement of the entire country,
 to establish social engineering in order to realize quantification of decisionmak-
 ing in national economic construction.  Concretely speaking, statistical data are
 timely'supplied to the national economy information system, mathematical models of
 macroeconomy are correctly built, simulation experiments of economic construction
 programs are carried out on electronic computers, choices among plans and programs
 are made on the basis of the result of quantified experiments, and plans and pro-
 grams are adjusted in a timely way according to the changing condition of execu-
 tion of the national economic plan and new developments in politics, economics, and
 science and technology.  This is the general process of realization of the quanti-
 fication of decisions regarding the national economy.

 SCIENTIFIC, TECHNOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION'S TASKS FOR 1981
 [Text]  Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA)--The third session of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
 Scientific and Technological Association was held on 6 and 7 March in Beijing.  The meet-
 ing reviewed the association's work in 1980 and discussed and defined the tasks for 1981
 in the new situation of furthering national economic readjustment.
 Zhou Peiyuan, chairman of the Chinese Scientific and Technological Association, spoke at
 the meeting, which was presided over by Pei Lisheng, vice chairman of the Chinese Scientific
 and Technological Association.  Zhou Peiyuan said:  The important principle put forth by
 the central work conference on furthering economic readjustment and political stability
 is a very correct one.  The Chinese Scientific and Technological Association and workers
 in the scientific and technological field support the central work conference principle
 and are willing to do their part.  He said:  Further readjustment of the national economy
 has placed new demands on the scientific and technological circles; all our scientific
 and technological workers should take positive action and carry out the readjustment of
 the scientific and technplogical association itself by coordinating with the economic
 readjustment.  The association's work must link with production, adapt to actual needs
 and attacfi importance,to research and exchanges of technical experience in agriculture,
 light industry and energy.  We must stress the main points of work and actual results
 and use our limited manpower and resources in the most needed areas; we must advance the
 spirit of building enterprises through arduous efforts.
 Standing Committee members attending the meeting spoke their minds and discussed the
 association's work in the light of actual conditions.  They held that 1980 was a year'of
 transition in the history of development of the association and also a year of action.'
 In 1981 we must carry forward our good points and overcome our shortcomings to make our
 work even better.
 1.  Continue academic and technological exchanges and activities to put forth scientific
 and technological proposals and to provide scientific and technological advice on the
 readjustment of the national economy and the four modernizations;
 2.  Energetically improve education in science and technology, give on-the-job training,
 and help large numbers of scientific and technological workers, party and government
 cadres in enterprises, and workers and peasants to raise their scientific and technological;
 level and efficiency in management and operations;
 3.  Extensively launch activities to disseminate scientific knowledge among the people,,
 and promote innovations and education in this field so as to contribute toward building
 the socialist spiritual civilization;
 4.  Build the association itself well, paying attention to building up scientific and
 technological associations in counties as well as in factories and mining enterprises
 and organs to popularize science in the rural people's communes;
 5.  Strengthen ideological-political work among cadres of scientific and technological
 associations at all levels and among scientific and technological workers.

 ACADEMY OF SCIENCES RESPONSIBLE PERSON INTERVIEWED
 OW301015 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Mandarin 0125 GMT 29 Mar 81
 [Excerpts) Beijing, 29 Mar (XINHUA)--A responsible person of the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences recently granted an interview to XINHUA reporters in connection with the appoint-
 ment of new members to the Scientific Council of the academy.
 The responsible person said:  The Scientific Council was founded in June 1955.  At that
 time the council consisted of four departments:  the Department of Mathematics, Physics
 and Chemistry; the Department of Biology, Geology and Geography; the Department of
 Technical Sciences; and the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences (predecessor
 of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences).  In 1957 the Department of Biology, Geology
 and Geography was divided into the Department of Biology and the Department of Geology
 and Geography.  In 1961 the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences became
 subordinated to the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee.
 At present, the Chinese Academy of Sciences consists of five departments-mathematics and
 physics, chemistry, biology, geology and geography, and technical sciences--plus a
 management science group.
 He said that the establishment of the Scientific Council'was an important measure adopted
 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to place reliance on scientists to take the lead in
 scientific undertakings.  After its establishment, the Scientific Council has implemented
 the principle of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in academic circles and
 played an effective role in bringing into full play the strength of the scientists'
 collective leadership in promoting scientific undertakings.
 The responsible person said:  The Scientific Council was forced to suspend its activities
 during the "Great Cultural Revolution."  In the spring of 1979, the academy decided to
 resume its work.  To do this it was necessary, first of all, to strengthen all the organi-
 zations under the council.  With this goal in mind, the academy started moves to appoint
 new members of the Scientific Council.
 The responsible person said:- The Scientific Council members may be reelected consecu-
 tively.   The council's tasks are:  first,  to exercise academic leadership over all research
 institutes under the academy; second, to unite Chinese scientists, enhance cooperation among
 scientific circles and jointly promote scientific and technical undertakings in China; and
 third, to submit reports and suggestions concerning pertinent principles and policies and
 major scientific and technical problems to be solved in the building of socialist moderni-
 zation in China.  Through discussion at general meetings, Scientific Council members will
 decide the direction of the development of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, examine and
 approve scientific research plans, solve major questions and elect the presidium of the
 academy.  The presidium members will elect the president and vice presidents of the Chinese
 Academy of Sciences.
 The responsible person said:   The Scientific Council members represent a broad spectrum.
 They came from various institutes inside and outside the academy.  He said:  The Scientific
 Council is still inexperienced in its work and''needs to continually sum up experience and
 improve and raise the quality of the work in the future.

 INTENSIFICATION OF PARTY SUPPORT FOR SCIENCE URGED
 Beijing GUANGMING RIBAO in Chinese 18 Apr 81 p 1
 [Article:  "The Entire Party Should Accord the Proper Importance to Science and
 Tehnology"]
 [Text]  The development of modern science and technology is currently an urgent and
 important task of the entire party.  The central link in accomplishing this task is
 improvement of the entire party's awareness of science and technology and bringing
 science and technology's critical role in our country's socialistis modernization
 construction and social development fully into play.
 Are science and technology really important?  What role do they play in national
 economic development?  Consider several facts: In agricultural production, in 1980
 hybrid rice already was planted on more than 80 million mu nationwide and was giving
 an average increase in yield of 100 jin per mu, or a total increase in output of
 7 billion jin nationwide.  Comprehensive research into techniques for increasing output
 and their extensive application have enabled Henan Province to increase it wheat output
 by an average of more than 3.5 billion jin a year for the past several years.  Pri-
 marily owing to effective popularization of the superior variety Lumian No 1, in
 addition to implementation of policy and relatively favorable climatic conditions,
 last year Shandong Province's total cotton output was more than two times larger than
 in 1979.  In industrial production, because the Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company
 adopted the blast furnace technology, which was developed exclusively by this country,
 for refining vanadium-titanium magnetite ore, and utilized its comprehensively, it
 soon turned losses into profits; while in 1977 this enterprise lost more than 11 million
 yuan, by 1980 it was already paying more than 107 million yuan in profits to the higher
 levels.  Light industry and the textile industry are making use of more than 460 scien-
 tific research results and have energetically promoted the production of daily-use
 consumer goods.  Overall, in the last 3 years, and particularly since the 3d Plenum
 of the 11th Central Committee, here have been great changes in our country's science
 and technology scene, and the achievements of scientific research are becoming more
 numerous year after year.  For example, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the center of
 the country's scientific research, had a total of more than 1,300 research results in
 1978, more than 1,400 in 1979, and 1,576 in 1980 (evaluations have indicated that 14
 percent of them are close to or at the world state of the art).  While the national
 defense scientific and technological system has been carrying out its sophisticated
 scientific and technical tasks with flying colors, it has also ii:*Pnsified its scien-
 tific research work for the populace.  In 1980 the 7th Ministry of Machine Building

 and 25 are at or close to the international state of the art.  Innumerable vivid cir-
 cumstances have given people an increasingly clear understanding of the immense role
 of science and technology in developing the national economy and promoting social
 progress, and have further stimulated our vast population's enthusiasm for studying
 and utilizing science and technology.  Historical experience proves that whenever our
 party has laid increased emphasis on science and technology and scientific and technical
 personnel, our socialist cause has progressed more smoothly; and..when it has not done
 so, the result has been setbacks of various degrees of seriousness.  When the party
 Central Committee recently stressed again that the "entire party must lay emphasis on
 science" and pointed out that during the readjustment of the national economy we must
 also readjust the relationship between science and technology and economic development,
 gradually increasing the share of scientific research funds in the budget, and assuring
 that science makes steady progress, it summed up positive and negative historical
 experience and inferred that there is still a greater and lesser degree of failure
 within the party to accord due importance to science and technology.  At present there
 are still many comrades within the party, including some who are in charge of economic
 and party and government leadership, who are insufficiently aware of the importance
 of science and technology and who do not sufficiently support scientific and technical
 work. Many party committees and administrative leadership organs have still failed to
 put scientific and technical work on their agendas, or pay lip service to its impor-
 tance but actually relegate it to a secondary place, so that it loses out when the
 pressure of work increases.  Some comrades even consider that science and technology
 stand in the same relationship to production and the economy as the cock-crow at the
 dawn, i.e that "dawn comes whether the cock crows or. not," and that it makes no
 difference whether science and technology are pursued or not.
 't'here are many reasons for this failure to accord due importance to science and
 technology.  The small producer's narrow ideology and ingrained habit are an important
 social cause.  Some comrades look at science and technology and at education with the
 small producer's eyes, and will not admit that they are extremely important for the
 cause of socialist construction and that socialist construction is impossible without
 them.  To root out these influences, it is necessary to take a worldwide view.  In the
 capitalist countries, science and technology are not only a new means by which the
 capitalists squeeze out excess value, but also a basic factor in the development of
 modern large-scale production in capitalist society.  At present in some developed
 capitalist countries rates of growth of the national economies exceeding 60 percent
 are based on scientific and technical progress, and many new production sectors have
 been entirely brought into being by science and technology.  Science and technology
 are now advancing at a startling pace.  In 10-odd years in the 1960's and 1970's, the
 number of new discoveries and new inventions in science and technology exceeded the
 total for the previous 2,000 years; every year basic engineering and technical know-
 ledge and specialized knowledge increase by 5 and 20 percent respectively; in the past
 10 years 30 percent of industrial knowledge has become outdated, and 50 percent of
 electronics technology has become outdated.  Only if socialism creates a higher labor
 productivity than capitalism can it ultimately defeat capitalism.  In this light,
 science and technology are a life-and-death matter for the two differing social
 systems of socialism and capitalism.
 An important ideological source of the failure to accord due importance to science and
 technology is the many years' influence of "left" ideology.  In theoretical terms,
 this influence is expressed as some comrades  continued failure to recognize that
 science and technology are a productive force and that scientific research must precede

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 production, and their failure to recognize that modern tools of production are embodied
 science and technology and that the person who constitutes the greatest productive
 force is the one armed with scientific and technical knowledge.  In their thinking
 regarding the guidance of economic construction, some comrades cannot correctly handle
 the'relationship between economic development and science and technology, and will not
 admit that science and technology have a critical role in economic constrution.  They
 do not accord importance to science and technology and do not rely upon them in econo-
 mic construction; when they grasp production they fail to grasp science and technology;
 and when they embark on capital construction they do not make an effort at techno-
 logical reform of existing enterprises; the result is that many of our country's
 scientific and technical achievements cannot be put into use and disseminated in
 timely fashion, many old enterprises' technologies, processes and equipment cannot
 be renovated and modernized., and they remain for a long time in a backward condition
 of high waste, low quality, and production of the same products year after year.
 Many years of this state of affairs in economic work have not only hindered the develop-
 ment of science and technology in our country but have harmed the country's socialist
 construction.  In their policy on intellectuals, some comrades still discriminate
 against or even repress scientific and technical personnel and refuse to admit that
 the vast majority of the intellectuals, including 5 million scientific and technical
 personnel, belong to the working class, and are a force upon which the party relies.
 They have long suffered from a phobia about.rightism and a belief that "better 'left'
 than right," and in the process of cadre reorganization they have rejected scientific
 and technical personnel with their specialized capabilities and organizational ability
 and have prevented them from participating in leadership groups at all levels, or
 have given them posts but failed to make use of them, so that they are little more
 than furniture.
 To summarize, the habits of the small producer and the effect of "left" ideology have,
 to a.greater or lesser degree, and in both visible and invisible ways, hindered the
 development of science and technology.  As a result, if the entire party, starting
 with leadership comrades in party committees at all levels, is to truly make an effort
 to give due importance to science and technology, then it must take care to guard
 against and overcome the effects of the small-producer habit of mind and must conscien-
 tiously root out the "left" ideology.              The aim of rooting out this ideology is to sum
 up experience and to raise consciousness in the implementation of the party's scienti-
 fic and technical policy and its policy on intellectuals.  The methods for rooting
 it out must be suitable, must be based on the actual situation in each department,
 locality and unit, must seek the truth from the actual situation, and must conscientiously
 solve the problems that exist.
 In developing science and technology we must not stop with general slogans.  We must
 also'adopt correct policies, and organize all parties concerned for a joint effort
 to carry out a successful reorganization relative to science and technology. Recently
 the party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers approved the policy guidelines
 proposed by the party organization of the State Committee on Science and Technology
 regarding nationwide scientific and technological development in the immediate future.
 The main content of these guidelines is as follows:  1.  Science and technology and
 the economy and society should develop in coordination with each other, and promotion
 of economic development should be made the primary task.  2.  Stress should be laid
 on strengthening the study of production technologies, and technologies should-be
 correctly selected and formed into a .rational technological. structure.  3.  Technical

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 development and dissemination of technology in factory and mining enterprises must
 he intensified. 4.  Basic research must be maintained on a stable basis and gradually
 expanded. 5.  Learning from and assimilating foreign science and technology should
 be treated as an important means of developing this country's science and technology.
 This is a relatively comprehensive set of guidelines which seek the truth in the
 actual situation, which were drawn up following preliminary rooting out of pernicious
 "left" influences, and which are beneficial to the entire readjustment of the national
 economy.
 on the basis of these guidelines, the readjustment of scientific and technical work,
 and particularly the readjustment of its relationship to economic development, should
 take account of both the overall situation and of scientific research work itself.
 In terms of the overall situation, the readjustment should have the effect of making
 economic work able to rely better on science and technology and to bring their role
 thoroughly into play.  To this end, first, it is necessary to base major policy
 decisions in economic and social development on scientific research and thorough
 technical substantiation.  Policy research and consultat{ve organizations should be
 setup at the national level as quickly as possible.  Second, an energetic effort
 should be made to implement uniform planning for scientific-technical, economic and
 social development.  Third, a comprehensive review of our country's investment policy
 should be undertaken, and the share of funds for scientific research in the state
 budget gradually increased on this basis.  Fourth, in order to improve economic'effec-
 tiveness, rationalization and reorganization of the broad economic structure should
 be coordinated with technical renovation of older enterprises.  If a reorganization
 of the economic structure is not undertaken, scientific and technical reform will
 result in a good deal of blind action; and if ...he reorganization of the economic
 structure is not combined with technical renovation, its results will have many
 limitations and will not be lasting.  Fifth, we should actively and prudently reform
 the economic and scientific and technical management system, reasonably readjust the
 structure of science and technology and of the ranks of scientific and technical
 personnel, promote and organize from the top down the unification and coordination
 of the five front armies on the scientific and technical front, promote and organize
 unification and cooperation among, scientific research, production and applications
 organizations and their attack on key technical problems, and conscientiously solve
 the problem of large amounts of unnecessary duplication in construction and research.
 Scientific and technical work itself should make a greater and more effective
 contribution to promoting economic development.  First, in a number of urgent near-
 term areas such as agriculture, light industry and textiles, energy, communications,
 machine building, materials, and electronics technology, it should select a few.
 topics and solve certain scientific and technical problems which are of major impor-
 tance for national economic and social development.  The key is to select the right
 problems, in accordance with local conditions and the nature of the organizations,
 and to grasp correctly the principles of selecting research topics.  At the same time,
 we should establish and fill out our country's own scientific and technical reserve
 for'the long-term needs of economic and social development.  Those who do not plan
 for the long term have difficulties in the short term.  We cannot focus solely on
 immediate benefits.  We must make allowances for long-term needs and energetically
 "take account of both the near term and the long term" and "coordinate near-term
 and long-term measures."  The key in this endeavor is effective basic development of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 research.  For an individual' production department or a research system with a
 certain degree of integration, the basic development of research should include:
 a clear and stable direction of research and a properly regulated sequence of work;
 a politically firm party leadership group, an ideologically unprejudiced research
 collective, and effective administrative and management bodies; a reationally organ-
 ized, high-quality, intellectually upright scientific and technical contingent; a
 .precise and flexible information system (including information gathering, library
 materials and file work); and a good working and living-environment which gradually
 creates the conditions for socialization of research support and technical services.
 It should also include:. development of a practicable subject development policy and
 relevant technical-economic policy; and systematic, energetic education and training
 in rotation of scientific and technical management personnel, intensified develop-
 ment of legal institutions, regulations and systems for management of science and
 technology, and promotion of the specialization of research management and its
 development into a science.
 Strengthening the party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee that our country's
 science and technology will advance unceasingly. The party Central Committee has
 great concern for and accords full importance to scientific and technical work.  The
 Central Committee Secretariat regularly requests scientists to make reports, and
 recently it has heard many reports by the party organizations of the State Committee
 on'Science and Technology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences as well as reports
 on scientific and technical cadre work from the CCP Central Organization Department,
 and the State Council's Office of Scientific and Technical Cadres and Office of
 Personnel Matters, and has issued many important directives and set a model for
 party and government leadership comrades at all levels.  Strengthening the leadership
 of science and technology is the glorious task which the age has assigned to our.
 party.  If the entire party accords due importance to science and technology and
 painstakingly acquires scientific and technical knowledge and masters the management
 of science, the party's leadership of science will be strengthened.

 (Excerpts] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA)--The fourth session of the Scientific Council of
 the Chinese Academy of Sciences opened here this morning.  The Scientific Council, composed
 of 400 scientists, is the leading academic body of the academy.  The current session
 is the first ever in 21 years since the third session held in Shanghai in April of
 1960.
 In his opening speech, Yan  Jici, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and
 one of the academy's founders, described the session as having "great importance" in the
 annals of theldevelopment of China's sciences.
 81-year-old Yan Jici said, in his youthhood, many scientists had the ambition to devote
 to science for the sake of China's independence and prosperity.  However, this proved
 8dream in the semi-feudal and.semi-colonial China.  The birth of new China and the
 regeneration of the country, especially the third session of the 11th Central Committee
 of the Chinese Communist Party and China's grand modernization program,,have opened
 UP even broader vistas for development of China's science and technology and Chinese
 scientists.
 He called on scientists to work more closely with the administrators, technologists
 and the staff members of the academy in the interests of the motherland.
 The program of the session includes:  to hear and examine a report on the work of the
 academy, discuss the draft constitution of the academy, hear and discuss reports by the
 various departments of the council, elect a presidium of the academy which in turn
 elects president and vice-presidents of the academy.  Each department will elect a
 Standing Committee which elects director and deputy directors of the department.  During
 the session, each department will hold meetings to discuss its own work and carry out
 academic exchange.
 Academy sources told XINHUA that 283 new members were added to the council last month to
 bring the number to 400.  The council members come from 24 provinces, municipalities
 and autonomous regions.  They work in 27 ministries and departments, 43 universities and
 colleges and 114 research institutes.  The current council is larger than any time in
 the past and is more broadly represented.  There are 79 physicists and mathematicians,
 67 chemists, 89 biologists, 75 geoscientists and 90 technical scientists on the council.`.

 [Text]  Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA)--Fang Yi, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,,.;,
 today proposed that a scientist be elected to the presidency of the academy.  He proposed
 that future presidents be elected by the academy instead of being appointed as he had
 been in 1979 at the second session of the Fifth National People's Congress.
 In his work report to the fourth session of the academy's Scientific Council here this
 afternoon, Fang Yi said he had offered to resign on a number of occasions with the
 council taking up the role of policy-making organ of the academy.  The present session
 will elect a presidium to choose the new president and vice-presidents.
 Fang Yi, who is also minister in charge of the State Scientific and Technological
 Commission, said he took charge of the academy under particular circumstances after the
 downfall of the "gang of four."  He was of the opinion that a scientist should take over
 the job, and the present system of giving leaders life-long tenure should be changed.

 After submitting his resignation,. Fang Yi said he would continue to support the work of.,
 the academy. He will remain to be China's highest leader on scientific affairs, both
 within the Communist Party and the government.  The vice-premier told the scientists;
 "In my cooperation with scientists in these years I have come into intimate acquaintance
 With many and learned a great deal from you.  We will carry on our friendship, I think
 I'll continue to be an enthusiast for science,"

 OW111617 Beijing XINHUA in English 1603 GMT 11 May 81
 (Text)  Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA)--The fourth session of the Scientific Council of the
 Chinese Academy of?Sciences which opened today marked an important progress in China's
 effort to reform the system by which scientific development is managed.  Fang Yi,
 president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, stressed this point in his report on the
 opening day of the session.
 ,be Scientific Council, composed of 400 noted- scientists, will become the highest policy-
 wking body of the academy from a body of advisory nature.  The current session will elect
 a Presidium of the academy, which in turn will elect the academy's president and vice-
 ;residents.  A total of 283 members have been recently added to the council through serious
 examination and voting by the original members.  This has brought the total number to 400.
 The Scientific Council has thus become more representative and authoritative, said Pang Yi.
 The appraisal of a scientific result should be left to the scientists, he said.   He advised
 the administrators not to give improper conclusions about academic matters.  Nor should a
 comment from any leader be substituted for an academic appraisal which, he added, should be
 made only by the scientists themselves.
 Fang Yi said that the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the country's highest academic organi-
 zation in the field of natural sciences and a comprehensive. research center.                  He hoped that
 the Scientific Council will play an active part in promoting the integration of science and
 technology with the  socioeconomic development.  He stated that the Central Committee of the
 Communist Party and the State Council expect the academy to serve as an advisory body to the
 party and state in scientific and technological matters.
 ,In the more than four years following the downfall of the gang of four, Fang Yi said, the
 ;Chinese Academy of Sciences devoted its attention to restoring its work to the former days.
 The academy has made new advances and improved its standards.   Summing up shortcomings in
 work, Fang Yi said that owing to the influence of the leftist ideology, the academy had for
 .a time placed too high targets for development, hence the need for readjustment in the plan.
 At present, the Chinese academy embraces 117 research institutions with a total staff of 75,000.
 36,000 of them are engaged in research projects.  2,000 are senior members.  Fang Yi said
 that the academy has kept up a steady progress in its research work and achieved certain
 results of high academic standard and practical value.  Fang Yi expected the country's
 scientists to develop the fine tradition of patriotism, hard study and hard work, and persist
 in an honest academic spirit.                                                -
 Fang Yi paid high respect to the old generation of Chinese scientists and wished the younger
 generation to take upon themselves the responsibility of bringing into reality China's
 modernisation, be diligent in research and courageous in creation.

 [Newsletter by XINHUA reporters Zhang Jimin, Gu Mainan and Zhou Changnian: "Place Great
 Hope in Young and Middle-Aged Scientists"--sidelights on the fourth session of the
 Scientific Council of the Chinese Academy of Sciences]
 [Excerpts] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -Young and middle-aged scientists account for one-
 tenth of the 400 newly elected members of the Scientific Council of the Chinese Academy
 of Sciences [CAS], and the average age of the council members has thus been reduced by
 11 years.  They are the new blood of the council.  Though small in number they symbolize
 the bright future of the council.  What a delightful event it is for the revolutionaries
 and scientists of the older generation!
 Party and state leaders gladly met all council members attending the fourth session of
 the CAS Scientific Council cn the morning of 11 May and they had cordial talks with the
 members of the presidium of the session.  At approximately 0930, party and state leaders
 one after another joined the council members.  Vice President Li Chang introduced Yang
 Le, a middle-aged mathematician, to Comrade Peng Zhen.  Smiling and tightly holding
 Comrade Yang Le's hands, Comrade Peng Zhen asked Yang Le to sit beside him.  Then, he
 had a cordial talk with him on how to bring into full play the role of middle-aged.
 council members.  He also asked with great concern about the living conditions of middle-
 aged scientific and technological personnel.
 Comrade Deng Xiaoping arrived a little later.   On his arrival, he asked: "How many of
 the council members are under 50?"  Vice President Hu Keshi answered: "There are 40
 council members who are under 55."  Comrade Deng Xiaoping then asked: "Is there not any-
 one under 40?"  Comrade Hu Keshi said: "Yang Le is the youngest.   He is 41."
 As the meeting began, a middle-aged council member was seen pondering over something
 with fixed attention.   He was none other than Guan Weiyan, a 53-year-old expert in
 cryophysics and currently deputy director of the CAS  Physics Institute.   After the down-
 fall of the "gang of four," the leadership of the academy and the masses of the institute
 chose him to take up a leading post and let him share the heavy responsibility of leading
 the scientific research work at the institute.  During the past few years, he has made
 achievements in leading the academic work at the institute and in carrying out scientific
 research work.
 Among the female council members attending the current session was 54-year-old Ye Shuhua,
 deputy director of the Shanghai astronomical observatory under the CAS.

 [Text] Beijing, 14 May (XINHUA) -Installation of equipment to produce multi-channel laser
 beams of ten.to the eleventh power watts to study the physics  of plasma is one of 500
 major scientific achievements made by the Chinese Academy of Sciences from 1977 to 1980.
 This was announced by Fang Yi, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, at the
 current session of the Scientific Council, the highest policy-making body of the academy.
 Fang Yi, in his work report to the session on Monday,? said that the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences has deployed scientists to work in the most advanced branches of science and some
 major scientific and technological tasks concerning national construction. In an effort to
 serve the national economy and construction, Fang Yi said, the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences has allocated great'amount of manpower and material resources to carry on research
 in the fields of agriculture, energy, materials science, environmental protection, and
 alleviation of natural disasters. Some progress has been made.
 He cited as examples the wilderness survey in Heilongjiang Province, research on the trans-
 formation of marshes by well irrigation and drainage on the SanjiangPlain in northeast
 China, a comprehensive survey of national agricultural resources and research on the geology
 and rock mechanics of some gigantic engineering projects.
 Fang Yi in his report also mentioned the scientific work and achievements of the academy in
 the area of national defence.
 On technology, he said that progress has been made on computers, semi-conductors, lasers,
 remote sensing and superconductivity. Fang Yi said academy researchers had put into trial
 operation a computer capable of ten million calculations per  second. Several types of
 large-scale integrated circuits, including an MOS having 4096 bits of storage capacity,
 and a 16 K large-scale integrated circuit have been successfully manufactured. These are
 the highest quality level so far produced in China.
 The basic sciences have begun to develop after years of sabotage, President Fang said.
 He mentioned in particular the synthesis of the 3'-half molecule of the yeast alanine TRNA,
 the structural models of the active center of nitrogenase, the fault block tectonics, the
 theory of bio-environmental control and the provinciality of floras and faunas in geological
 time.
 Report on Technical Development
 0W142027  Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 1214 GMT 14 May 81         -
 [Text]' Beijing, 14 May (XINHUA)--In a work report delivered at the fourth session of the
 Scientific Council of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, [CAS], Li Xun,  permanent member of
 the technical science department,  emphasized that energetically developing technical
 science is an urgent task in order to accomplish China's socialist modernization program
 at the earliest possible date.
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100190001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100190001-7
 With regard to natural science, Li Xun said, basic science is aimed at probing the secret
 of natural phenomena and discovering the laws of nature, while the purpose of technical
 science is to study the processes for man to transform nature and the rules that govern
 these processes. He said: From the 17th to the 19th century, most developments made in
 natural science were in the field of basic science, whereas little was accomplished in
 studying the fundamental rules of engineering and technology. During that period the work
 of engineering and technology  still depended on experience to a great extent.  In the late
 19th and  the early 20th century, people began to realize more and more that they could not
 resolve the question of strength encountered in the use of materials by merely depending on
 Newtonian mechanics,,nor was it possible to work out the most efficient electric power
 system by relying solely on the theory of electromagnetism.  Similarly, they came to know
 that Lavoisier's oxidation-reduction theory alone could not give guidance for improving the
 steel-making process. They felt that betweentasic scientific theory and practical production
 technology there should be an intermediary link, and that is technical science. Under such
 circumstances, material mechanics, metallurgical physical chemistry, mechanical engineering,
 electrical engineering and other technical science disciplines came into being one after
 another.
 During the past decades, with the progress in basic science and because of the needs of
 economic development, further advancement has been noted in technical science.  A host
 of new technical science disciplines have been established and are being daily improved.
 Examples are atomic energy, semiconductors, automation, computers, laser beams, space
 technology and remote sensing.
 Li Xun continued:   Technical science is very closely concerned with the national economy
 and defense construction, and its importance is increasingly prominent.   It is generally
 understood that energy, materials and information, all closely related to technical
 science, are three pillars of modern civilization.  He also mentioned the major achievements
 China has made in technical science during the last two decades or so..  Only by developing
 our own technical science, he said, can we really absorb and assimilate foreign scientific
 and technological achievements and develop our economy, as well as our science and
 technology,,in a genuinely independent and self-reliant way.
 Li Xun's report stated several points-that merit particular attention in energetically
 developing technical science:
 1. Continued efforts should be made to strengthen those disciplines closely concerned
 with traditional industries, such as mining, metallurgy, mechanical engineering, electrical
 engineering, engineering thermophysics, civil engineering, hydraulic engineering, architecture,
 applied mechanics, applied optics and radio electronics.
 2.  To.accelerate the development of such new technology as semiconductors, computers,
 laser beams,  superconductivity, space technology and remote sensing, it is necessary to
 formulate and implement development plans with emphasis on specific points.   Certain pertinent
 research units should be strengthened on the principle of supporting the outstanding ones.
 Units in related fields should be organized to work cooperatively and to solve key problems
 through their joint efforts.   They should not be satisfied merely with their success in the
 trial-production of some products, but rather they should establish a sound technological
 foundation, study and understand the laws and make scientific discoveries.   Take semiconductors,
 for example. Not only is it necessary to make large-scale integrated circuits of reliable
 quality and to achieve a high rate of qualified products in the manufacture of such circuits,
 but, what is more, work should be done to develop the science of semiconductors.
 3.  Efforts should be made to study and solve the key questions of science and technology
 in connection with the national economy and defense construction.  At present the emphasis
 should be on agriculture, light industry, energy supply, communications and transport,
 machine building, materials industry and national defense.

 LI Xun called for attention to problems of acomprehensive nature involving more than one
 department and one trade, as well as to problems of universal importance.  Examples are
 control of environmental pollution, 'standard weights and measures, survey and testing
 techniques, instruments and meters, metal corrosion and its control, systems engineering
 and technological economics.
 Referring to future work, Li Xun suggested that the state set aside special funds to
 establish a science  foundation to support those research projects that are relatively
 advanced and that are really deeded.  He expressed the hope that all members of the
 Scientific Council would unite as one and work strenuously to make still greater contribu-
 tions to the development of China's technical science.

 Scientific Gains Noted
 OW170554 Beijing XINHj1A Domestic Service in Chinese 1317 GMT 15 May 81
 [Excerpts]  Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA)--The policy of neglecting basic research work is a
 shortsighted one.  Basic research is the treasure house for developing one's thinking and
 creating new technology in the field of science.
 This is Hua Luogeng's point of view emphasized in his report on the work of the department
 of physics and the department of mathematics to the fourth Scientific Council under the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS].
 Hua Luogeng, vice chairman of the council, points out in this report which lasts more than :x
 1 hour, that as far as scientific research work in the whole country is concerned, major
 efforts should be made in the study of applied science.  However, he believes that basic
 research remains indispensable according to the law for the development of science and
 technology, because theoretical breakthroughs often pioneer the technical revolution.  He
 hopes that in the course of readjustment, the state will maintain stability and continuity
 of scientific research.  He says:  The development of some major scientific research pro-
 jects and facilities can be slowed down and carried out on a smaller scale.   However, we
 should not rashly discard them.  He believes:  Mathematics, physics (including acoustics),
 dynamics and astronomy form the important foundation for the incessant development of
 science and technology.  Many aspects of the work are applicable.  For example, solid state
 physics is able to serve material science.   Dynamics and applied mathematics are able to
 serve the national economy and national defense.  There are also numerous applications of
 nuclear physics and nuclear technology.  In the field of astronomy, polar shifts in time
 measurement and the forecast of solar activities, the tracking of satellites and geodesy
 are indispensable in the development of the national economy and national defense.
 Hua Luogeng says:  In view of the fact that the state is in a stage of readjustment, it is
 unrealistic to carry out basic research work in all fields on a large-scale.  Therefore, we''
 can only support the major fields.  He believes:  Major support should be given to the study
 of the state of aggregation physics and the application of nuclear technology, the work of
 practical measurement in astronomy, the study of pneumatics and explosion in dynamics and
 the study of properties in the field of the strength of materials so as to attain even
 better results.
 He says:  During the past 4 years, we have already scored 150 significant achievements in
 scientific research.  Thirty-five of them are of high standard and great value in actual
 application.  In the realm of the national economy, the application and promotion of over-
 all quality control, the mathematical models and methods of computation in modern communica-
 tions, the study of microwave absorption material, technology in seeking, the best plan in
 oil conservation, the method of making overall plans in facilitating transport of the rail-
 way system and the basic research on and control of jet noises have made remarkable contri-
 butions to the economic results of factories and transport departments and to environmental
 protection.  Remarkable achievements have been made in the field of national defense such

 as longwave and shortwave time transmission and its application in launching the long-range
 carrier rocket, the highly spontaneous digital sounder, the experiments in installing four
 high-voltage pulse X-ray machines in synchronous photography and the study of heat--preven-
 tion problems for ICBM warheads.
 Hua Luogeng believes:  Some of the scores of achievements made by this Scientific Council
 in the past years have already reached or approached the international level.

 'BEIJING RADIO' ON SCIENTIFIC LEADERSHIP
 OW201107 Beijing Domestic Service in Mandarin 1200 GMT 19 May 81
 [Station commentary:  "Rely on Scientists To Improve the Party's Leadership Over
 Scientific Undertakings"]
 [Text]  The fourth meeting of the Scientific Council of the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences (CAS) is in session in Beijing.  Outstanding representatives of scientists
 from the whole country are discussing CAS work.  The meeting passed the provisional
 CAS charter on 18 May and elected members of its presidium on 19 May.  The presi-
 dium has elected the CAS president and vice presidents.  This signals the grand
 unity of Chinese scientists and the prospering of scientific undertakings in our
 country.
 All scientists are united in promoting our scientific development and revitalizing
 China--this is the call of the times, the aspiration of the people and the tremen-
 dous historical mission of scientific circles.  We wish full success to the fourth
 meeting of the CAS Scientific Council.
 Economic and social development is closely linked with scientific and technologi-
 cal development.  To build a strong socialist country, it is necessary to rely on
 science and technology, on scientists who possess a variety of special knowledge and
 on all scientific workers.  Our scientists and large number of scientific workers
 have the tradition of patriotism, diligence in pursuing study and hard work.  For
 many years, they have achieved much through painstaking study and selfless work under
 difficult conditions and made contributions to our modernization campaign.
 However, as many people failed to fully understand the role of science and tech-
 nology and as left ideas and practices interfered with practical scientific work,
 the role of scientists and scientific workers did not receive the attention it*de-
 served.  We have suffered enough in the past in ignoring science and technology.
 Without changing this situation, it will be impossible for us to succeed in social-
 'ist modernization.
 To bring into full play the role of scientists and fully rely on them to success-
 fully run scientific undertakings, the fourth CAS Scientific Council meeting intro-
 duced a reform to the CAS' leadership system, changing the system of appointing
 members of the Scientific Council to the system of election. The 283 additional
 members of the Scientific Council attending this meeting were all democratically
 elected by the CAS.  The status of the Scientific Council meeting also has been
 :hanged from a consultative body to the supreme decision-making body of the CAS.

 The Scientific Council meeting is to determine CAS development orientation, ratify
 research programs, decide on major issues and elect the presidium, which in turn
 elects the CAS president and vice. presidents.
 Now a scientist has become the CAS president.  This is a major reform of the CAS
 leadership system. It is a concrete manifestation of, and an organizational
 guarantee for, reliance on scientists to improve the party's leadership over China's
 scientific undertakings.  Replacing the past system of largely administrative
 leadership, the new system is conducive to doing things according to scientific laws.
 It is our belief that with China's outstanding scientific representatives taking
 part in CAS leadership and policy making, the CAS will be run still better, effec-
 tively promoting China's scientific development and making still greater contributions
 to the state.
 The significant CAS reform aimed at relying on scientists to lead China's academic
 development is a first in our country.  We should foster a social atmosphere of
 respecting science and scientists and attaching importance to, and making use of,
 scientists' ability.  All departments and industries should give full scope to the
 consultative and advisory role of scientific and technical workers.  Moral and
 talented people with scientific and technological knowledge should be placed in the
 leading body or councils of specialists and advisors should be established to
 capitalize on science and technology promoting social and economic development.

 [ZIIONGGUO XINWAN SHE reporter's feature:   "Hu Yaobang Meets Scientists"]
 [Text]  With a red invitation card issued by the General Office of the CCP Central
 Committee in hand, scientists attending the fourth session of the Scientific Coun-
 cil of the Chinese Academy of Sciences camer`.this morning to a symposium at the Huairen
 Hall  in Zhongnanhai, which was personally presided over by Hu Yaobang, general
 secretary of the CCP Central Committee.
 In front of the curtain in Huairen Hall were displayed fresh flowers and evergreen
 pinetrees.  This solemn rectangular hall is a place where the CCP Central Committee
 and the State Council hold important meetings.  Today, mount taishans and big dip-
 pers of the Chinese scientific circles came here as guests of the CCP Central Com-
 mittee's secretariat to meet cordially with leading members of the secretariat.
 At 1000 hours leading members;of the secretariat and chief responsible members of
 the Chinese Academy of Sciences began to take their seats while chatting with each
 other.  On the rostrum were seated from left to right Yao Yilin, Song Renqiong, Wu
 Zhonghua, Fang Yi, Yan Jici, Hu Yaobang, Lu Jiaxi, Wan Li, Li Chang, Gu Mu and
 Peng Chong.  Of the 12 members of the Central Committee's Secretariat, only 5 were
 not present at the symposium because they had something else to attend to.
 Hu Yaobang, general secretary of the CCP Central Committee, delivered a warm, sin-
 cere and rather important speech at the symposium.  He warmly congratulated the
 participants on the complete success of the session and hoped that the scientists
 would go deep into the realities of life, solve important problems in the national
 economy and assume the attitude of masters in their work.  He called on them to break
 through brambles-and thorns and scale the summit  of science with full confidence.
 His speech won repeated applause which lasted for some time.
 Wan Li, Song Rengiong andLYao Yilin also addressed the symposium.  They encouraged
 the scientists to contribute their intelligence and wisdom to the four modernizations.
 Yan Jici, acting chairman of the presidium of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke
 at the symposium.  He said that the speeches of leaders of the CCP Central Commit-
 tee's Secretariat were unforgettable and a great encouragement to scientific work-
 ers.  He asked everybody to grasp seriously the essence of the speeches and imple-
 ment them in practical work.

 FANG YI SPEAKS AT CAS SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL MEETING
 OW300658 Beijing Domestic Service in Mandarin 0900 GMT 29 May 81
 [Excerpts of the work report delivered by Fang Yi at the fourth session of the
 Scientific Council of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on 11 May 1981]
 [Text] The report says:  In the past 4 years and more since the smashing of the
 gang of four, the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS], working under the leader-
 ship of the party Central Committee and-the State Council, has strived to imple-
 ment the correct political, ideological and organizational lines of the party
 Central Committee. It has radically changed the situation of disorder and solved
 many questions left over from an earlier period.  It has restored order in sci-
 entific work and made progress in all fields.
 1.  It has brought order out of chaos, implemented-the party's policies and
 shifted the focus of the academy's work onto the path of scientific research.
 After the-national science conference, especially since the 3d session of the
 11th CCP Central Committee, great efforts have been made to shift the focus of
 the academy's work to scientific research and to put progress in scientific
 research ahead of production and construction.  Meanwhile, acting on Comrade
 Deng Xiaoping's pithy analysis of Chinese intellectuals as part of the working
 class, we have firmly relied on our own scientists and technicians.  We have
 restored the functions and powers to various institute and office directors,
 restored the academic committees of various institutes and restored technical
 job titles.  We have promoted a large number of outstanding middle-aged and young
 scientific and technical cadres.  We have reiterated the necessity to devote at
 least 5/6 of our working hours to research.  We have restored enrollment of grad-
 uate students, reformed political work organizations and increased the proportion
 of scientists. and technicians in the composition of the party committees of
 scientific research organizations.  In the last 2 years, we have emphatically
 studied the guiding policy of the academy and questions concerning the strength-
 ening of leadership over academic work.
 2.  We have restored and consolidated scientific research organizations and made
 initial reforms.  In 1965, before the great cultural revolution, the Chinese
 Academy of Sciences for the first time became a comprehensive research center
 of natural sciences with all necessary branches of learning.  It suffered severe
 damage during the 10 years of disorder.  In the past 4 years, the. academy re-
 covered, restored and built a number of research institutes and branch institutes.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 The academy now boasts 117 research institutions with a total work force of more
 than 75,000, of which more than 36,000 are research technicians and 2,000 are
 higher research technicians.  We have initially substantiated the technological
 system, which is indispensable to scientific research.  We have drawn in more per-
 sonnel who are specialized in designing, production, maintenance and repair of
 scientific instruments and equipment.  We have built and improved spublic labora-
 tories and technical service organizations.  We have equipped laboratories with a
 number of new instruments we have made.  We have-completed a number of laboratory
 buildings and put a number of large equipment to laboratory use.
 3.  We have made steady progress in scientific research and achieved a number of
 results whicfimeetcertain academic standards and are of practical value.  We have
 also stepped up the training of cadres.  We formulated an 8-.year plan in 1977.  The
 academy scored about 500 important achievements 1977-80.  In order to expand acade-
 mic exchanges, we have actively organized and participated in various academic
 activities at home and stepped up the publication of books and journals.  We pres-
 ently publish 400 kinds of scientific and technological books and some 70 scientific
 and technological periodicals annually.  For the purpose of training cadres, we are
 determined to run well the Chinese University of Sciences and Technology and its
 graduate schools.  In recent years, the academy has taken in more than 1,800 grad-
 uate students.  Having received on-the-job training and participated in various
 study classes, present scientists and technicians, as well as college graduates in
 recent years, have improved their understanding of basic theories, experimental
 techniques and foreign language skills.  We have made it possible for more than
 1,000 people to attend schools, pursue advanced studies or participate in research
 work in foreign countries.  We have set up colleges for cadres to pursue advanced
 studies and organized the cadres to gain scientific and management knowledge in
 order to improve the management ability of present party and government cadres.
 4.  We have strengthened international academic exchanges and developed scientific
 cooperation with foreign countries.  The CAS has signed agreements and memoranda on
 scientific and technological cooperation and exchanges and established cooperative
 relationships with the scientific organizations of many countries.  There has been a
 fairly big increase in the number of personnel sent abroad and invited to China.
 Several international academic symposiums have been held in China in addition to
 the participation of many Chinese scientists and technicians in international aca-
 demic conferences abroad.
 The report says:  As an academic institution, the CAS should take into account the
 unique features of academic institutions when it adopts the system and methods of
 leadership.  The CAS departments set up in 1955 were specifically meant to strength-
 en academic leadership by relying on scientists.  Since their establishment, the CAS
 departments have done much work'and played their roles well.  After 1957, academic
 leadership was weakened somewhat under the influence of "leftist" mistakes.  Dur-
 ing the decade of turmoil, CAS department activities were banned.  All this ham-
 pered the CAS from functioning normally.  In the spring of 1979, with the consent
 of the party Central Committee and the State Council, we began to restore and re-
 build the CAS departments and appoint new members to them.  Thanks to the . support
 of all departments and localities and the earnest examination and democratic elec-
 tions by the original CAS department members, 283 new CAS department members have
 been appointed.  Together with the original members, the total CAS department

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100190001-7
 membership now stands at 400.  Formerly CAS departments were primarily  consulta-
 tive bodies.                  Now the scientific council is the highest policymaking organ of the
 CAS.  This is an important change.
 Recently, the central authorities clearly reaffirmed that the CAS is the nation!e
 highest academic institution in natural science and a comprehensive research cen-
 ter.             The CAS should do a good job in building the research institutes under'its
 jurisdiction and, through the higher-level research work of these institutes, serve
 the nation's four modernizations program.  At the same time, the CAS has an import-
 ant responsibility to develop science and technology in the whole country.
 The report offers some opinions regarding the future work of the CAS departments.
 The report says:  Science and technology are productive forces.  Scientific re-
 search should advance ahead of production and construction.  Economically backward
 countries like China are especially in need of scientific. and technical forces to
 improve the nation's outlook.
 The CAS departments and their members should play positive roles in integrating
 science and technology with social and economic development in the following
 aspects:
 First, it is necessary to make our scientific research'1 yield more fruitful results
 and make greater contributions to the nation's economic and national defense con-
 struction.  Second, the party Central Committee and the State Council want the CAS
 to play the role of staff to the party and the state in scientific and technological
 matters and to offer valuable opinions or suggestions on important matters related
 to the four modernizations program.  Third, it 'is hoped that in integrating science
 and technology'with society and the economy, CAS department members will publicize
 the important role of science and technology among the large numbers of cadres and
 masses, publicize the significance of :propagating scientific research findings
 and disseminate scientific and technical knowledge so that everyone will study,
 make use of and support science and technology.  Science and technology should
 serve the nation's economic construction.
 The central authorities have clearly laid out the principle for operating the CAS--
 "placing particular emphasis on the basics and on raising the standards and serving
 the national economy and national defense construction"--and have pointed out that
 the CAS should strive to achieve higher academic standards and better meet the
 needs of the nation's economic and national defense construction.  It is necessary
 to make scientific research match China's present situation and modern scientific
 developments.  At the same-time, it is necessary to fully consider the needs of
 future development.  According to this principle, the CAS is mainly responsible for
 doing research in pure science and some branches of technical science.  It is neces-
 sary to quickly train outstanding researchers in pure science and gradually increase
 the ratio of basic research by gradually readjusting research projects, actively
 training postgraduates and sending personnel abroad for further studies.  It is
 necessary to raise the standards of research in practical application and devote
 greater efforts to applying the findings from basic research and exploring new
 domains.  It is necessary to take our own -apabilities into account when engaging
 in the work of expansion, which constitutes a large proportion of our present work.

 In reporting on his tL-month tour at the tMited Vtat:oa, Comrade ttua Luogetig oa ht
 that appl.tcntioa cannot he successful without a broad and strong theoretical
 foundation.  Summing up the practical scientific experience of the biochemistry
 institute in 30 years, Comrade Cao Tianqin also vividly explained the relation-
 ship between fundamentals and application.  He maintained that research in pure
 science can facilitate production and that research in practical application can
 also generate new theories.  Some research in pure science may yield practical re-
 sults if we pay attention to relating it to reality.  Research in practical appli-
 cation is linked to production and to raising scientific standards.  It may also
 turn up subjects for basic research.
 The CAS should also pay great attention to contributing its share to the nation's
 economic construction.  We have also done a great deal of work in this aspect.
 However, we have dampened the enthusiasm of some scientists and technicians be-
 cause of drawbacks in our system and work and because the paths were not cleared
 for publicizing scientific achievements.  In the wake of national economic read-
 justment and economic structual reform, economic. departments are feeling an in-
 creasing need for science and technology.  This opens broader prospects for science
 and technology to play their part in production.  Scientific research, including
 the work of pure science research units and many basic research projects, can also
 promote economic construction.  We should pay attention to the ideological aspects
 of this matter, select the major fields of application and coordinate our efforts.
 Since they hail from various departments and localities, CAS department members are
 more qualified to promote contacts and cooperation among the various departments.
 In future, CAS departments will examine the direction, tasks and plans of research
 'institutes under the CAS which fall within the scopes of their respective discip-
 lines.  They will examine important projects and review the work of research insti-
 tutes.  They should try to prevent needless duplication of research projects among
 the various departments and institutes of higher learning.  This will facilitate
 mutual understanding.
 The report says:  Our society as a whole works to achieve a civilization with
 socialist spirit.  Scientists and technicians are builders of material as well as
 spiritual civilization.  As an academic institution, the CAS is charged with the
 basic task of fostering a fine study style.  It is necessary to foster among sci-
 entists and technicians a fine study style--of emancipating the mind, seeking truth
 from facts, daring to make explorations and setting rigorous and tough demands.
 Our party and government cadres should avoid making conclusive statements on right
 and wrong in specific academic issues. They should also not regard any leaders'
 instructions as a yardstick for making academic appraisals.  Academic issues can
 be appraised only by academic circles.
 Scientific research is a highly creative and extremely arduous mental labor.  A
 major scientific breakthrough or an embryonic scientific assumption can be made
 only after scientists have devoted successive years or decades or even their
 entire lives to research.  Sometiies the efforts of several generations are needed
 to accomplish it.  Leading comrades of research institutes of the CAS should fully
 vinderstand and pay attention to the unique features of scientific research, act
 according to objective laws and prevent scientific research from being interfered
 with or disrupted.  We hope that the old and middle-aged scientists will help young
 scientists and technicians foster an indomitable spirit so that they will not rest
 content with having a smattering knowledge of a subject, retreat at the first sign
 of hardship or look up against long years of experiments, surveys, observations
 and investigations.

 A. extremely important matter note is to fully bring out the potential and functions
 of middle-aged and young scientists and technicians.  Scientists who are relatively
 advanced in age have many strong points, but they lack the stamina and have limited
 time to continue their work, a fact dictated by the laws of nature.  We should
 enable them to devote this limited time to discovering, selecting, promoting and
 training talented people and to use their experience to make up for their inade-
 quacies.  We should let them shoulder more important tasks and give them more
 chance to demonstrate their talents in academic leadership, academic activities,
 international exchanges and organizational and administrative work.  The leadership
 should show warm concern for their difficulties and problems and solve them step by
 step.  We hope that the older scientists will display tireless zeal in teaching
 people and continue to guide the middle-aged and young scientists and technicians
 in academic thinking and methods of academic pursuit.
 An important characteristic of science and technology is the constant and endless
 breakthroughs in the attained levels.  Changes occur daily in modern scientific
 and technological development.  Therefore, old, middle-aged and young scientists
 should constantly study and improve themselves. They should familiarize themselves
 with the latest developments in science and technology throughout the world, study
 new problems, accept new ideas, explore new domains, furnish new results and make
 fresh contributions.
 The historical lesson obtained from the revolution and construction in China shows
 that a correct CCP leadership is indispensable.  Scientific and technological de-
 velopment since the founding of new China also shows that a correct CCP leadership
 is indispensable.  Our party has put forth the principles in doing cadres'. work--
 to have revolutionary,  more educated, professional and younger cadres.  Cadres
 doing political, administrative or logistic work in scientific research institutions
 should set higher demands in order to be more revolutionary.  They should constantly
 raise their ideological and  theoretical levels and improve their understanding of
 the policies by studying political theories and party policies and constantly sum-
 ming up their work experience.  They should uphold the four basic principles and
 foster the lofty ideas of serving scientific research and scientists and technicians,
 They should pay attention to studying new situations and problems, improving their
 methods of work, gaining new experience and constantly raising the level of ideo-
 logical and political work and other administrative work.  They should unite all
 scientists and technicians and help them make constant progress in poltiical aware-
 ness and allay livelihood worries that distract them from their work.  Party member-
 cadres should all the more observe the guiding principles for inner-party life and
 play an exemplary and vanguard role in all work.

 FANG YI,  OTHER LEADERS ATTEND SCIENCE CONFERENCE
 OW061330 Beijing XINHUA in English 1301 GMT 6 Jun 81
 (Text]  Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA)--A hybridrice strain which produces extremely high yields
 and holds great promise for agriculture worldwide was given a special class award by the
 State Council here today.
 In the view of the awarding and examining committee under the State Scientific and Techno-
 logical commission, the development of this strain--called Xian type hybrid rice of the
 male sterile line--has great value academically, technically and economically.
 The successful cultivation of this hybrid has enriched the theory and practice of heredity
 in hybrid rice seeds, and opened a new way for the big increase of rice production in
 China and in the rest of the world.
 The special class award, the first of its kind, consists of certificate of merit, a medal
 and (RMB) 100,000 yuan.  The certificate and medal were handed over to agronomist Yuan
 Longping, representing the inventors, by Fang Yi, vice-premier and minister in charge of
 the State Scientific and Technological Commission, at an awards ceremony today.
 From 1976 to 1980, China sowed Xian-type hybrid rice on a total of 16.7 million hectares
 of paddy fields, and yields totalled 13 million tons more than with conventional strains.
 Average per hectare yield was 750 kilogrammes higher than that of other fine rice strains.
 The new hybrid rice has proved to have extensive fibrous roots, a high tillering rate, thick
 stems and big ears containing more than the usual numbers of grains.  It is also adaptable
 to different farming conditions and resistant to adverse conditions, and yields grain of
 good quality.
 Yuan Longping, an agronomist at the Agricultural Insititute of Hunan Province, and research
 workers  in other parts of the country, began in 1964 to. experiment with hybrid rice of the
 male sterile line.  They succeeded in cultivating the world's first hybrid rice seed of
 this line in 1973.  Subsequently, they developed seed-breeding and cultivation methods, thus
 created conditions for popularization of the strain.
 Leaders of the state and the Communist Party Wang Zhen and Wan Li attended the ceremony and
 congratulated the inventors on their scientific achievement.  A message of greetings from
 the State Council was read at the ceremony by Wu Heng, vice-minister of the State Scientific
 and Technological Commission.
 Yuan Longping in his address attributed the success of the cultivation of the hybrid rice
 to the coordination of the country's agronomists in this research work.
 Also awarded today were the inventors  of a new high-yield cotton seed, called Lumian No
 One.  They received a first class award from the State Scientific and Technological Com-
 mission.

 'Text' of Fang Yi's Speech
 OW070922 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 1620 GMT 6 Jun 81
 ("Text" of speech by Fang Yi, vice premier of the State Council and minister of the State
 Scientific and Technological Commission, at the 6 June meeting to present a special class
 award to those who invented Xian-type hybrid rice)
 (Text]  Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA)--Comrades:  First of all, I am happy to warmly congratulate
 those who have won the special class award for inventing the Xian-type hybrid paddy rice
 and those who have won the first class award for inventing the new cotton seed called Lumian
 No 1.
 With your hard work and creative achievements, you have made remarkable contributions
 to increasing grain and cotton yields in China.  Today the state and the people bestow
 upon you high honor and due awards.  This is a memorable day.  I hope that you comrades
 will maintain your honor, work ceaselessly and unremittingly, and create even more and
 better achievements for the development of agriculture and the country.
 Success in breeding the Xian-type hybrid rice has enriched the theory and practice of
 heredity in hybrid rice seeds, marks a good lead in this field internationally, and has
 won great honor for the nation.  Scientists in the United States, Japan, India, Italy,
 the Soviet Union and other countries have, for more than a decade, been studying hybrid
 rice.  However, they are still in an experimental stage.  We are way ahead.
 How is it possible for China to take the lead in this field?  I believe that such a lead
 is'by no means accidental.  There are good reasons.  The Xian-type hybrid rice is an
 achievement scored by combining modern science and technology with China's traditional
 experience in agricultural production.  China is an ancient farming country.  The Chinese
 nation is one of the earliest in the world to engage in agriculture.  It has made
 indelible contributions to the progress of mankind and to the development of productive
 forces.  In the practice of production over a long period, the broad masses of peasants
 in China have accumulated extremely rich experience.  They have their own originality in
 breeding and invigorating seeds of fine strains, carrying out meticulous farming, maintain-
 ing soil fertility and combating and preventing insect pests and plant diseases.  Once
 such valuable traditional experience in production is integrated with modern science and
 technology, it will bear rich fruit.
 Our party has always advocated that agricultura. scientists and technicians must maintain
 close touch with reality in production and identify with the peasant masses.  They have
 already accumulated a wealth of good experience. and scored outstanding achievements in
 research.  The success in rapidly breeding and propagating hybrid rice is a striking
 example.
 The integration of rice strains of three different lines, the development of the seed
 strain and the techniques in seed cultivation have been achieved by assimilating and
 summing up the experience of the masses.  For example, hybrid rice is evolved from cross-
 breeding rice of the sterile line with fine strain rice with short stems.  Its resultant
 strain not only has the fine features of a hybrid strain, but also maintains the fine
 features of being short-stemmed and lodging-resistant.  In growing rice seedlings the
 experience in cultivating and invigorating conventional rice seedlings has been assimi-
 lated, and hybrid rice seedlings have been propagated by the use of tillering, thus
 greatly reducing the amount of seeds needed.  In seed-breeding the experience of the
 masses in "controlling growth with dryness and promoting it by the use of water" has been
 summed up and applied in solving the problem of infertility in the stage of anthesis.
 Practice proves that to link agricultural scientists and technicians with the peasant
 masses and combine modern science and technology with China's traditional experience in
 .agricultural production is the correct path in scoring more achievements and attaining
 quicker results.

 The present situation in China's agricultural production is fine.  The party's correct
 policy in agriculture has already demonstrated its tremendous power and is continuously
 playing its gigantic role.  The enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for production
 has been brought into full play.  They have never felt the pressing need of science and
 technology and such a strong demand in relying upon science and technology to develop
 production as they do today.  All this has put forward before agriculture scientists and
 technicians a glorious task and even higher requirements.  It is hoped that all agricul-
 tural scientists and technicians will bring into full play their wisdom and talents and
 unflinchingly and triumphantly march along this road.
 Success in developing Xian-type hybrid rice is a victory for mass socialist coordination.
 Comrade Yuan Longping began his study on hybrid rice in 1964.  After he and other comrades
 worked hard and discovered the  wild-growing paddy rice of the male sterile line in the
 winter of 1970, they started to coordinate with more than a dozen units in'fraternal
 provinces and municipalities.
 Giving no thought to personal. gain or fame, they offered their hard-earned achievements
 to the cause of science of the motherland.  They propagated technology and provided the
 above-mentioned units with reference material.  Within a short period of 3 years and
 thanks to the joint efforts of the units concerned, some strains of the maintenance line
 (bao chi xi 0202 2170 47621 and the restoration line [hui fu xi 1863 1788 4762] were
 successfully evolved in various localities in 1973, and the task of developing a fine
 strain by combining rice strains of the three different lines was fulfilled, creating
 conditions for the use of hybrid rice in production.  Experimental sowing began in 1974,
 and the acreage of land sown to this improved strain was expanded each year after.  The
 area of land sown to this improved strain totaled more than 80 million mu in 1980.
 Organized by the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Hunan Provincial Academy
 of Agricultural Sciences, more than 100 units in more than a dozen provinces, municipali-
 ties and autonomous regions, along with thousands of scientists and technicians, coordinated
 with one another in carrying out the research project.
 It is exactly because of this mass socialist, coordination that we are able to attain rapid
 development in scientific research work, in propagating the achievements and in making
 agricultural science and technology serve agricultural production.  This major invention
 and its success manifest the superiority of the socialist system; reflect the fine style
 of study of the agricultural scientists and technicians, as well as their lofty moral
 character; and demonstrate their tremendous strength in unity and coordination.  This is
 the kind of socialist morals and ethics and spiritual civilization that we like to promote.
 We must vigorously give full play to the fine style of work to coordinate with one another
 for developing science, raising production and enhancing national strength.
 China is a major agricultural country with 800 million peasapts.  To develop agricultural
 production is of great significance in creating the political situation of stability and
 unity and in improving the people's living standards.  In developing agricultural produc-
 tion, we must first rely on policy and second depend upon science.  The-two major
 inventions to win awards at today's meeting--the hybrid rice seed and Lumian No 1 cotton
 seed--have yielded tremendous economic results since being popularized and put into use.
 During the 5-year period 1976-1980, Xian-type hybrid rice was sown on a total of 250
 million mu of paddy fields, and yields totaled 26 billion jin more than with conventional
 strains.  Average per mu yield was over 100 jin higher than that of other fine rice strains.
 In 1980 China sowed Lumian No 1 cotton seeds on more than 10 million mu of cotton fields,
 and yields of ginned cotton were increased by nearly a million dan. This has fully shown
 the significant role of science and technology in the development of production.  Success
 in quickly developing the hybrid rice and the Lumian No 1 cotton seed and putting them to
 use on a large scale is inseparable from the full attention and support given by the
 leading comrades concerned.  These comrades promptly discovered that the work was promis-
 ing, firmly carried out their work in leading and organizing the units and people
 concerned,and gave those units and people moral encouragement and the necessary material

 support.  Here I would like to express my appreciation to those comrades.  I also hope
 that the party organizations and governments at'a11 levels will strengthen their leader-
 ship over science and technology work and regard it as a major topic on their daily agenda.
 It is necessary to further develop research work in agricultural science and effectively
 popularize and apply the achievements in agro-science and technolgoy.  At the same time,
 efforts must be made to strengthen education on agriculture, vigorously train scientists
 and technicians in agronomy and disseminate general knowledge in agricultural science so
 as to develop China's agriculture persistently and rapidly.
 Comrades:  Today's meeting is the first of its kind since the founding of the nation to
 present a special class award for an invention.  The first special award in China has
 been given to an invention in agriculture.  This shows that China has a solid foundation
 in agricultural science and technology, and that it has made outstanding contributions in
 this field.  This also shows that there is plenty of room for development in promoting
 agricultural science and technology.
 The Chinese people are diligent and wise.   In the past the Chinese people contributed
 significantly to the development of science and technology.  Now we are lagging behind.
 As compared with the advanced world level, we are still far behind.  Nevertheless, we
 are full of confidence.  After the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee,
 science and technology will definitely flourish with marked progress in the course of
 national resurgence.  I hope that after this award meeting, the broad masses-of scientists
 and technicians will further give full play to their enthusiasm, creativeness and spirit
 for coordination; identify themselves with the masses and cadres; and make even greater
 contributions to the four socialist modernizations of the motherland.  I hope that you
 comrades will continue your efforts and score even greater victories.

 RENMIN RIBAO EDITORIAL ON SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL
 HK120144 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 19 May 81 pp 1, 4
 (Editorial:  "A Major Reform in the Leadership System in Science"]
 [Text]  The fourth session of the Scientific Council of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
 is another landmark meeting of our scientific circle following the downfall of the "gang
 of four."  Due to the concern of the party Central Committee and the State Council,
 representatives of outstanding scientists across the country came together to discuss and
 decide upon major issues of the academy and elected its leading group.  The victorious
 opening of this session represents an important development in the reform of the scien-
 tific leadership system.
 The  Scientific Council had held three sessions since its establishment in 1955 which
 positively influenced the development of our scientific efforts.  The fourth session was
 even more successful than the previous three sessions.  Its achievements included:
 First, an additional 283 scientists joined the Scientific Council, bringing its total
 membership to 400.  These scientists are working in 27 departments, 44 institutions of
 higher learning and 114 research institutes in the 24 provinces, municipalities and
 autonomous regions across the country and in most of the branches of natural sciences.
 What is more important is that these new members were elected by the current members
 after conscientious investigations and in a democratic way.  In this way, the Scientific
 Council now has a wider and authoritative representation.
 Second, the Scientific Council has become the supreme decisionmaking body of the academy
 instead of a consultative body.  The session elected. the presidium of the academy as well
 as the president and vice presidents from among the members of the presidium.  The members
 of the presidium and the president and vice presidents have a set term of office.
 These changes represent an important reform of the leadership body of the academy.
 Whether viewed from past experiences and lessons or from the needs of the developing
 situation, such changes are necessary.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences has, since its
 establishment 31 years ago, made many achievements and trained many talented people.  The
 academy has thus made important contributions to devleoping our science and technology and
 promoting the development of the national economy and national defense construction and
 accumulated valuable experiences in leading and managing our scientific endeavors.  One
 of the successful experiences is the setting up of the Scientific Council to step up
 academic leadership by relying on scientists.  Yet it was regretful that during a certain
 period in the past that the Scientific Council was not in a'position to fully display its
 role and during the 10 turbulent years it was compelled to suspend activities.  In the
 recent past, the academy was regarded as an administrative body and it had an administra-
 tive management system.  The leading position of scientists was far from complete and this
 situation hindered the development of science.  This time, the reform of the leadership
 system confirms the nature of the academy as the supreme national academic body and
 research center of natural sciences and changes its management system, thus allowing it
 to play its leadership role.

 .Now, scientists will be able to strengthen their leadership over academic matters and
 fully display their leadership role in scientific affairs; this new situation is in the
 interest.of working according to scientific laws and promoting the development of science.
 It is also in the interest of pooling together the wisdom and opinions of scientists in
 various branches so that they will be able to display their role as advisers to the
 party and the government in deciding important matters and to shoulder various heavy
 tasks assigned them by the party and the government.
 The reforming of the academy heralds the carrying out of similar measures throughout the
 country.  It merits the general attention of various sectors to guarantee making use of
 the strength of scientists systematically and organizationally.  Today, science and
 technology have been developing on an unprecedented scale and pace and they have pene-
 trated into various sectors of the economy and social life to become an important and
 indispensable factor for economic and social development. In carrying out the current
 national economic readjustment and restructuring, we face many difficulties in our
 economic and social work and all these problems have to be examined scientifically. In
 fact many problems can be tackled by resorting to science and technology. In principle,
 various party, government, economic, cultural and educational departments must let
 specialists take part in leadership and policymaking.  But all the departments concerned
 must proceed from their own specific conditions and may adopt organizational methods
 that differ from those taken by the academy.  For example, they may invite experts to
 join leading groups with some of them being responsible for practical work and others for
 advisory work; they may also establish advisory groups composed of experts or authorize
 some academic bodies to act as their advisers. It is true that it is impossible for
 the various departments, localities and units to have as many outstanding scientists as
 the academy, but once they are able to solve various problems ideologically, they will
 be in a position to take various measures systematically and organizationally and
 organize the experts from various branches in their departments, regions and units so
 that these experts will be able to fully display their role in leadership and policymaking.
 There is a very big potential in this respect.
 To let experts take part in leadership and policymaking is an important measure in
 strengthening and improving the party's leadership over scientific and economic work. Our
 economy is not strong and our science and technology are comparatively backward..  Our
 scientific and technical personnel account for only 0.5 percent of our population while
 the number of senior specialists is even fewer. Our scientific and technical personnel
 constitute invaluable intellectual wealth for our country and nation. They are the  Red
 and expert rank of the proletariat.  With considerably higher scientific and technical
 level, they have the ability to solve independently scientific and technical problems that
 have cropped up during the modernization construction. In addition, they have a glorious
 revolutionary and patriotic tradition.  The majority of them have been tested in pro-
 tracted struggles and even in the most difficult times during the 10 turbulent years they
 all continued to rally round the party.  Their confidence in the party, the people and
 scientific cause never wavered.  Quite a number of outstanding elements among them have
 joined the party. Of the 400 members of the Scientific Council of the academy, 219 are
 party members.  They comprise more than a half of the total. Letting experts take part
 in leadership and policymaking at various levels no doubt will strengthen the party's
 leadership over modernization construction.  The leadership by laymen over experts was
 stressed in the past because of the influence of "leftist" mistakes. Measures were
 taken to criticize the so-called "the line of relying solely on experts" and "letting
 experts run institutions" and relying on experts was regarded as contradictory to the
 party's leadership.  As a result, our scientific cause and economic work were damaged
 and the party's leadership was weakened. Now more and more party and government leading
 comrades have come to realize that the party's leadership will be strengthened only
 through integration with  experts.  The party and government leading comrades at various
 levels must respect science and scientists.  They must learn from experts, study and apply
 scientific and technical know-how and rely on experts to do a good job in leadership
 and policymaking.

 The experts who take part in leadership and policymaking must not be just given titles
 simply out of courtesy; on the contrary, they must be regarded as the members of the
 same family.  That is to say, we must trust them, unite with and work together with them
 and create opportunities and conditions for them so that they will be able to fully dis-
 play their talents and realize their aspirations.
 Following the reform of its leadership system, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has set a
 new and higher demand on all the members of the Scientific Council.  The party and people
 are grateful for the arduous work and outstanding contributions scientists have made over
 the years and urgently hope that they will make new scientific and research achievements
 in their endeavors to serve the four modernizations and the motherland.  We hope that with
 high sense of responsibility and the enthusiasm of being the masters of the state, they
 will carry out their work boldly, display the spirit of scientists who seek truth from
 facts and express their views without reserve.  It is also necessary to persist in a good
 work style, launch the drive of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, unite the
 scientific and technical personnel across the country and widely absorb the wisdom of the
 masses.  Veteran scientists have an unshirkable duty in educating young people and bringing
 up new and outstanding scientists.  Of the scientists that have been recently admitted into
 the Scientific Council, the average age of 40 of them is below 55.  This is inspiring news
 but this number is still too small.  We hope that more and more middle-aged scientists will
 join the Scientific Council and more experienced and outstanding experts will take part in
 leadership and policymaking at various levels.  We hope that all patriotic scientists and
 the masses of scientific and technical personnel will unite in their efforts to develop
 science so that they will become the vanguard in inspiring the nation.

 RENMIN RIBAO COMMENTATOR ON SCIENTISTS, CONSTRUCTION
 HK250727 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 20 Jun 81 p 5
 (Commentator's article:  "Organize Scientists and Technicians To Serve Economic Construction"]
 [Text]  In recent years, thanks to the efforts of many scientific research organs and
 personnel, there has been a great increase in the recycling rate of rare metals of the
 Jinchuan mineral intergrowth such as nickel and cobalt; and success has been achieved
 in the separation of elements in rare earths of the Baotou mineral intergrowth, while
 the grade of concentrates has soared.  This has created a lot of wealth for the state.
 These facts have again demonstrated the power of science and technology in stimulating
 economic and social development, and also show that so long as we organize the enthusiasm
 of scientists and technicians to serve the economy, the effectiveness of economic
 construction will be greatly enhanced.
 There are very many difficult problems that need solving in our country's industrial
 and agricultural production.  Many products cannot be replaced by new ones, their production
 costs and input consumption are high, output and quality ate low, they lack  competitive
 ability and are also unable to meet the needs of the people's life, while many rich
 resources cannot be fully used.  This is saddening and depressing.  He cannot do without
 relying on the forces of science and technology to change this situation.  There are
 many aspects of science and. technology, and many difficult problems in economic construction
 have to be solved by coordinating various branches of science.  This gives rise to a
 question of strengthening and improving organizational leadership.  The State Scientific
 and Technological Commission organized the forces of many branches of science in order
 to score success in research on the Jinchuan and Baotou mineral intergrowths, thus
 accumulating experience for solving difficult technical problems in economic construction
 and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production, and also
 providing ample scope for scientists and technicians to display their talents.
 We already have a completely trustworthy and reliable force of scientists and technicians.
 They earnestly desire to make more contributions to the party and people and have long
 been unhappy over the systems of "ownership by departments" and "ownership by units" which
 have bound them hand and foot.  Many scientists and technicians say that now on the one
 hand the workers need scientific and technical knowledge, while the peasants want science
 to advance into the countryside, and on the other there are many people working quietly
 and unknown in certain units which are stuffed with talent.  On the one hand the science
 and technology workers, especially the middle-aged and young ones, urgently demand to do
 something while they are full of energy, and on the other hand there are all sorts of
 barriers, they are always being impeded, and are unable to make full use of their-talents.
 In the face of this situation, the party and state are gradually carrying out readjustment
 and reform so as to bring the enthusiasm of the scientists and technicians into fuller
 play.  However the leading comrades of certain scientific and technological departments
 are just waiting for the reform of our country's economic and scientific research systems
 and think very little if at all about what work they could be doing right now.

 Centering on the coordinated effort to succeed in the Jinchuan mineral intergrowth and
 the separation of elements in the Baotou mineral intergrowth, we should make these
 comrades think about this: We cannot wait until after the reforms are carried out before
 bringing into play the enthusiasm of the scientists and technicians; we must actively
 think of ways to promote reform, in order to mobilize their enthusiasm.  One way is to
 advocate that scientists and technicians display the spirit of being masters of the house
 and plunge into the reality of production to find things to do and take the initiative in
 grabbing work; and another practical way is to have the leaders of science and technology
 departments grasp the difficult technical problems in the national economy and organize
 the scientists and technicians concerned to attack them one by one in a coordinated way.
 The State Scientific and Technological Commission and the Chinese Science and Technology
 Association have done a lot in this respect in the past 2 years and scored good results.
 All areas and departments can also proceed from their own acutal conditigns and do a good
 job in this organizational work.  As far'as the leaders are concerned, by carrying out this
 organizational work they can probe and gradually accumulate experience in reforming the
 systems; and as far as the scientists and technicians are concerned, they can broaden
 their vision and increase their talent and ability.  This would really be a good way of
 accomplishing many things at one stroke.
 In order to organize work well in this respect, the leading departments at all levels
 need to do some investigation and study, to get to know the talent resources in their
 areas and departments and the specialities of the scientists and technicians there, and
 also to find out the material resources in their areas and departments and to ascertain
 'what technical problems need solving.  It is not difficult to do this.  The key lies in
 whether one has a good mental outlook and can fully trust and rely on the scientists and
 technicians.

 XINHUA INTERVIEWS LEADING PHYSICIST ZHANG WENYU
 (Text] Beijing, 25 Jun (XINHUA)--"One-third of my life was spent abroad, one-third in old
 China and one-third in the new society.  I think I have a right to say that the Chinese
 Communist Party has made China strong," said high energy physicist Zhang Wenyu, 71, in
 an interview with XINHUA on the eve of the party's 60th anniversary.  He is one of the nine
 senior scientists who joined the party after the overthrow of the gang of four in 1976.
 Humiliated and attacked in the Cultural Revolution, he is today director of the Institute
 of High Energy Physics and among those in charge of organizing the nation's research in
 this field of science.  "The communists' devotion to building the country struck me when
 I returned from the U.S. in 1956.  I applied for party membership in 1965, and applied
 again after the fall of the gang when I felt I was reunited with the party I have faith
 in," he said.
 In the late 1940's, Zhang Wenyu studied the correlation between the subatomic particles,
 the muon and the nucleon and discovered the existence of the mu-mesonic atom.  Between
 1943 and 1956, he worked in the U.S.
 Commenting on new China's advances in physics, he paid tribute to Chinese physicists'
 1965 proposal of a "straton model" on the structure of basic particles and the 1972
 discovery of a heavy particle, whose mass is over ten times that of a proton, at the
 Yunnan cosmic ray observation station.  "Old China, like loose sand, disunited, could
 never do it," he said.
 The veteran physicist was very glad that Beijing University this year will have 128
 graduates majoring in physics.  In 1931, the year he graduated, there were only five.
 His High Energy Institute now has a research staff of 438.  "The future is promising,"
 he remarked.

 ANHUI HOLDS MEETING ON SCIENTIFIC FARMING
 OW080810 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0130 GMT 8 Jul 81
 [Summary) Hefei, 8 Jul (XINHUA)--The Anhui Provincial CCP Committee recently held a Standing
 Committee meeting and especially invited some agricultural experts to jointly disucss how
 to strengthen research work and popularize agricultural science and technology to meet the
 rural areas' requirements under the new situation and the peasants' new demands.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, Anhui Province has widely
 implemented various forms of production responsibility systems in the rural areas.  During
 the implementation of the production responsibility system, peasants have widely felt that
 although it is possible to increase production in 1-3 years by relying on hard work alone,
 sustained increases in production must still depend on science.
 The agricultural experts attending the meeting said excitedly: The production responsibility
 system has aroused the peasants' "enthusiasm for science" and has ushered in a golden age
 for the agricultural experts.  They made many constructive proposals on how to promote and
 popularize scientific and technological agricultural research, how to readjust teaching
 programs in scientific agricultural research.and how to'raise the scientific and technological
 level of leading cadres at all levels.
 After hearing the experts' views, Gu Zhouxin, second secretary of the Anhui Provincial CCP
 Committee, said: The current "enthusiasm for science" in the rural areas is a great change.
 Leaders at all levels must take the initiative in supporting this enthusiasm.
 Gu Zhouxin proposed: The major task of scientific and technological agricultural departments
 at'and below the county level should be the popularization and teaching of agricultural
 science and technology.  Furthermore, a few counties may engage in some research projects,
 management of the county agricultural science institute and the county agricultural technology
 station should be unified; and the provincial agricultural institute and the provincial
 agricultural college must also take part in the research of applied technology.

 [Text]  Beijing, December 23 (XINHUA) -- Zhou Peiyuan, chairman of the China Association
 for Science and Technology, spoke on the state and progress of the nation's scientific
 establishment this week.
 "China's science and technology, in the past 32 years, has made considerable progress,"
 he said.  "We have a complement of experts and technicians and better material conditions
 than ever before."
 Although the level of the nation's science and technology is still lower than that of
 industrialized countries, he said, we have trained many experts in science, engineering,
 agriculture, medicine and social sciences conducive to China's important achievements
 in industrial and agricultural production, medicine and national defence, he said.
 The chairman accredited the progress to the leadership of the Communist Party and the
 unified and clear plans for scientific research.
 To develop science and technology in accordance with the guidelines delineated by
 Premier Zhao Ziyang, the chairman raised the following points:.
 Tap the potential of scientific and technical personnel, organize this force, strengthen
 co-operation among scientists and form key task teams in scientific research and development.
 Create or provide more favorable material conditions for technical personnel in their.
 research work.   The Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to start a scientific research
 fund in 1982.    T.'e fund will be allocated to applicants with a research plan after approval
 by the fund committee.
 Reform the management system in scientific research and try to solve the problems of over-
 lapping institutions, and low efficiency now existing in some scientific research
 departments.
 Promote education by using available talent and training more professional personnel.
 More vocational, spare-time and secondary technical schools, day universities and other
 kinds of educational institutions should be established to increase the number of college
 students and technical personnel.
 Strengthen and raise the level of local scientific research 'to upgrade, as a whole, the
 scientific level of laborers.
 In conclusion Zhou Peiyuan said that the association should do more in organizing socialist
 emulations which will help China catch up to the world level of scientific research and
 development.

 [Text]  Beijing, 29 Dec (XINHUA)--The Chinese Academy of Sciences has brought
 into full play the role of the scientists who are giving greater academic leader-
 ship since the general assembly of the division members of the.Chinese Academy
 of Sciences last May.
 A growing number of professionals have assumed leadership at academy and institute
 levels.  Lu Jiaxi, professor of chemical physics, has taken up the office of
 Presidency of the Academy.  Scientists of nuclear energy, materials, metallurgy,
 bioneurology and atmospheric physics are elected vice-presidents.  The academy's
 institutes are almost all headed by scientists who have achieved outstanding
 results.  Among them are Peng Huanwu, Wu Xuezhou, Wang Yinglai, Yin Zanxun and
 Wang Daheng, working respectively in theoretical physics, chemistry, biology,
 geology and technical sciences.
 Scientists are giving their guidance by going to various institutes to appraise
 research programs.
 A group of 28 technical scientists led by Li Xun, a specialist in metals and
 vice-president of the academy, went to the Institute of Metals in Shenyang in
 August this year.  They studied the feasibility of the institute's research
 projects and commented on its research results in high-temperature metallurgy,
 the metallurgy of alloys, vacuum metallurgy and studies in metal crystallic
 structures.   After a series of panel discussions, the visiting scientists sug-
 gested that the institute affirmed the outstanding contributions the institute
 made in basic research in metal physics, and suggested that it step up its work
 in this field.
 Work of the Institutes of Botany, Applied Chemistry, Optics and Precision Machinery,
 Physics and Geology also have been appraised in the same way.
 At a standing committee meeting of the Division of Biology in September, a 5-year
 plan was made to conduct research in molecular biology, cytobiology, neurobio-
 logy, molecular genetics and biological nitrogen fixation.
 The Division of Earth Sciences held a meeting of scientists in Qingdao in June and
 decided to make marine geology the center of its research.  The scientists also
 decided to strengthen basic studies in the development of oil formations and
 sedimentary basins of oil and natural gas reserves.  The focus of their work will
 be China's Continental Shelf.

 COMPUTER APPLICATION, POPULARIZATION MAKING RAPID PROGRESS
 Wider Application
 Beijing GUANGMING RIBAO in Chinese 3 Jan 81 p 1
 [Article: "China Now Has Three Thousand Computers in Use"]
 [Text] As reported by reporter Wang Xingzhong [3769 5281 0022], in recent years,
 China has achieved fairly rapid progress in the application and popularization of
 electronic computers.  According to related statistics, there are now three thousand
 large, medium and small general-use digital computers throughout the entire country,
 as well as large numbers of analog computers, special computers, microcomputers,
 .and desk computers.  The entire country now has some 500 computer centers (stations);
 major scientific research academies, institutes, schools of higher education and
 large-scale enterprise organizations in various provinces, urban districts and
 autonomous regions as well as large and medium cities are basically equipped with
 electronic computers.
 In the application and popularization of computers, many districts and organizations
 throughout the country are by-passing administrative bounds and pooling their efforts
 in various ways, such as dividing software research and development projects among
 themselves, thus turning computers into a productive force for advancing the four
 modernizations.  For example, in architectural designing, some research academies
 and institutes have jointly developed specialized computer languages and application
 software systems which are powerful, flexible, readable, easy to learn and under-
 stand, and quite well received.  The Shanghai Research Institute of Shipbuilding
 Technology and Hudong Shipyard use Chinese-made 709 and 320 type computers in
 extensive efforts to develop application software; as a result, computers have
 replaced some of the old traditional technological methods in the Shanghai Hudong
 Shipyard, Jiangnan Shipyard and other major enterprise organizations, and become
 their productive force and indispensable component link.  Based on local conditions,
 quite a few provincial and municipal computer centers (stations) are applying
 computer technology in agriculture and have achieved excellent results in helping
 to develop agricultural production.

 Due to the wide application and popularization of electronic computers in various
 sectors of the national economy, many districts, [government] departments and
 organizations across the country attach great importance to training computer
 specialists.  The Ministry of Education also emphasizes the training of computer
 specialists.  Based on the statistics of 37 higher educational schools directly
 under the Ministry of Education, 16 of them have already set up computer disciplines.
 Computer departments have also been established in quite a few other affiliated
 organizations and local colleges and schools.  In recent years, secondary-level
 computer vocational training schools and technical schools have sprung up all over
 the country, turning out multitudes of computer specialists and technical workers
 each year.

 [Text] The Shanghai Jiaotong University and Pennsylvania State University are colla-
 borating on a joint project to train Chinese computer management enterprise
 specialists, and the first graduate student class (preparatory course) in Jiaotong
 University was formally opened on December 8, 1980.
 The graduate student class was established through the positive contributions of
 Mr Zhu Chuanju [2612 0278 2829], an American scholar of Chinese descent who had
 travelled'far and wide, and many times across the ocean to establish the ties, and
 Mr Rong Hongyuan [2837 7703 0337], a well-known personage who had donated one
 million yuan.
 Mr Rong Hongyuan was formerly one of the board directors of the Shanghai Shenxin
 Textile Mill, and a large shareholder as well.  When the mill was converted into a
 joint state-private enterprise, his assets were kept in a domestic bank with fixed
 interest.  As an aluminus of the Shanghai Jiaotong University, Mr Rong wanted to
 contribute part of his dividends to his alma mater.
 Last November, when his son-in-law Mr Zhu Chuanju and daughter Rong Zhizhen [2837
 2535 3791] were invited to Jiaotong University, they learned about the lack of
 material resources and qualified teachers in Jiaotong University's Industrial
 Management Department which also lagged behind the most advanced level in other
 countries.  With the permission of their father-in-law Mr Rong Hongyuan, they
 decided to donate some money to the department.  But Mr and Mrs Zhu Chuanju also
 felt that the donation alone was not sufficient to solve the problem thoroughly.
 So, on their return to the United States, they got in touch with the deans of the
 Computer Sciences School of the Pennsylvania State University, and consulted with
 them about establishing sister school ties between Penn State University and Jiaotorg
 University.  Both sides were to set up funds for the convenience of personnel and
 academic exchanges between both parties.

 In March 1980, Mr Zhu Chuanju, who was over 60 years old, crossed the ocean again
 to discuss specific matters with Shanghai Jiaotong University.  It was decided that
 Shanghai Jiaotong University's funds would be raised from the one million yuan
 which Mr Rong Hongyuan offered to donate out of his personal bank interest, +while
 Pennsylvania State University's funds would be raised through other sources.
 In the respective months of June and October 1980, Penn State University sent Mr
 (Previs), Chairman of the Computer Committee, and Vice President (Rubin) to hold
 consultations with Jiaotong University, and work out specific arrangements for the
 graduate students class.

 PRC PROFESSOR DISCUSSES BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
 OW181231 Beijing XINHUA in English 1220 GMT 18 May 81
 [Text]  Beijing, May 18 (XINHUA)--Scientists in China have successfully separated
 and purified the active center of nitrogenase, the nitrogen fixation enzyme.  This
 is a big step forward in biological research, according to Professor Bei Shizhang,
 acting director of the department of biology of the Scientific Council of the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences.
 Interviewed at the fourth session of the council, now in session, 78-year-old
 Professor Bei said China has made achievements of international importance in
 molecular genetics and genetic engineering, though work in these fields began
 quite late here.
 Scientists of the People's Republic have done much in the study of the structure,
 functions and synthesis of biological macro molecules, Professor Bei said.  For
 instance, the crystalline structure of porcine insulin was determined here between
 1971 and 1973.
 Professor Bei also mentioned that biologists have developed 20 varieties of haploid
 plants from pollen grain cultures, and a male anti-fertility drug from cotton-seed
 oil.
 China has made many practical applications in biological science as well, Professor
 Bei said.  Forty varieties of important economic plants have been introduced in
 the last decade, and a number of wild plants which are of great economic value
 have been identified.  Botanists have successfully imitated multi-layer tropical
 plant communities in Guangdong, Guangxi. and Yunnan.  Now this work is on a large
 scale basis, which will contribute to the development of the study of ecology.
 Another achievement of scientists in China is synthesis of a hormone to facilitate
 breeding of fish and domestic animals, Professor Bei Shizhang said.

 has made new progress.  In recent years, the quality of products, the systematization
 and software and technical services have all visibly improved, the ratio between
 performance and price has improved, and computer applications have also produced
 preliminary results.
 Our nation developed her first computer in 1958.  Over the past 23 years, the efforts
 have developed into a fledgeling industry which includes scientific research and
 design, production and manufacturing and applications services.  The whole nation has
 over 100 development and manufacturing units'.    In recent years, various models of
 series of machines have continued to develop.     Greater improvements have been made
 in the stability of the products, systematization and producing sets of equipment,
 the ratio of performance to price and technical services.  For example, the average
 operating time without downtime of the DJS130 small mainframe computer, which is the
 one widely used nationwide, has been. increased from 50 hours in the past to over
 1,000 hours.  The systems capacity has increased from the past "three old components"
 (photoelectric input, punch card output, teletypewriter) as peripheral equipment to
 over 20 types at present.  The systems software..is.- gradually being perfected, the
 costs and prices have also dropped by a large scale.  To strengthen technical ser-
 vice, last year, the nation established the China Computer Technical Service Company
 and the Series Computers Software Center.  This year,'branch companies have been
 established in related provinces and cities.  Each production factory has also
 widely established applications service agencies, provided training for users, pro-
 vided technical counseling, and equipment maintenance.
 According to incomplete statistics, up to the end of 1980, the number of large, medium
 and small computers installed by every profession and trade throughout the nation
 had reached 3,000.  These computers. have served importantly in the development of
 our nation's science and technology, national defense construction and national
 economy.  Since the beginning of this year, the computer industry has implemented

 Developing Our Nation's Computer Industry"]
 [Text]  Popularization of the application of. computer technology is a question that
 concerns the entire situation of developing our nation's computer industry.  To solve
 this problem well will exert an important influence upon the development of the entire
 national economy, national defense construction and science and culture.  At present,
 under readjustment of the national. economy, the important question of developing our
 nation's computer industry should be to turn from the past practice of centering
 around the research, design and manufacture of computer hardware rapidly towards
 popularization and application as the key, and to use this to lead research and
 development, production and manufacturing, systematization of peripheral equipment,
 development of applications, technical service and sales of products.
 Computer technology is a leading technology.  The computer industry is a new in-
 dustry that serves a leading function.  It is an indispensable means of modernization
 for the technical improvement of the national economy and national. defense construc-
 tion and for the realization of scientific management.  At present, the level of
 computer technology, the scale of production and the.degree of application have be-
 come important signs of the development of modern productivity.  It is a profession
 that has developed the fastest.  It has also rapidly and widely penetrated each field
 and has brought about great changes in production, technology, management-and even ?
 social life.  Data shows that in modern industrially developed nations, there are over
 4,000 processions that commonly utilize computer technology.  Our nation is advancing
 towards the building of the four modernizations.  If we do not realize computerization,
 'modernization cannot be imagined.  In national defense, whether for combat weapons,
 strategic equipment, or technical combat command and control, the computer is in-
 dispensable.                      In economic?buildup, replacement of a massive amount of products must
 realize digitization, integration, intellectualization, and these all require the

 computer.  The design, production, quality control, management reform of products
 all require the computer.  The entire. economic activity such as planning, statistics,
 comprehensive balancing, financial management, capital turnover are all inseparable
 from the computer.  Therefore, in the period of readjustment of the national economy,
 each profession must emphasize the use of computer technology, select and use domes-
 tically produced computer systems and equipment as much as possible so that our
 nation's computer industry can develop. quickly.
 Research and development, manufacturing of products, applications services, training
 of personnel are the four important parts of the computer industry which cannot be
 separated from each other.  Of these- popularization of application and technical
 service are a link that we have not paid much attention to in the past.  We must
 fully recognize this point, and in readjusting the guiding ideology and industrial
 structure, there must be a strategic change.
 According to our nation's actual situation, we should first pay attention to the
 popularization of small computer and microcomputer systems.  Small computer and micro-
 computer systems are low priced, changes in the system are more versatile, they can
 better adapt to the changes in user demands by the users and maintenance personnel
 and technological developments.  Therefore, they are an inexpensive technological
 means in the important path to realize automation in management and control.  There-
 fore, while developing large and medium sized new.series of computers, it seems very
 important to develop small computer and microcomputer systems that have a great de-
 mand and that have broad applications.
 Emphasizing application as the key does not mean that systematization and systems
 functions can be neglected nor does it mean that product quality and reliability
 of the operating system can be neglected, nor does.it mean that the ratio of per-
 formance to price can be neglected.  It is exactly the opposite.  To popularize
 application, we must tightly grasp. the two weak links of software and peripheral
 equipment.  We must develop applications software, develop a processing system for
 Chinese characters, continuously perfect and expand the function of the computer
 system, continuously improve the reliability and stability of the system.  This is
 to establish 'the material foundation for application well.  To improve the competi-.
 tiveness of domestically produced computers and suit the level of the domestic users,
 it is very important to establish a policy to lower the price.
 The goal of developing the computer industry is entirely for application.  Only ap-
 plication can open up the way, and especially by strengthening technical services
 for the users can the sales of products.be opened up.  Sales is an important economic
 and technical activity of enterprises, it is the key upon which the life of the
 enterprise depends.  Sales of computers and technical service are closely related.
 Foreign computer factories and businesses take "user service" as the most important
 guiding ideology of the entire business activity of the.company.  The best technical
 personnel are assigned to sales and technical  services positions.  Technical service
 personnel and product sales personnel constitute about one third of the entire
 personnel of the profession.  Now, application of our nation's computers has gradually
 turned towards the various departments of the national economy.  It has expanded from
 scientific computation to data processing and real time control.  While the strength
 of computer technology of the various sectors of the national economy is still weak
 at present, the technical problems encountered in'data processing and real time con-
 trol are more complicated, strengthening technical service for the users is a forceful

 measure to open up new fields of application.  We must allow about thrity percent of
 the technical force to carry out applications service.  Research institutes, mainframe
 plants, peripheral equipment plants must all place applications service in an impor-
 tant position.           We must also readjust some units that presently duplicate production
 to change them to units specializing in applications service according.;to plan.
 We should mobilize special technical personnel from more enterprises and research
 institutes towards applications service, establish regional and even national sales
 service networks.  Each region should strive towards a three-in-one combination of
 research and development, production, technical service and market sales while es-
 tablishing computer industry companies.  We must open up a road for broad applications
 through technical service to lead research and development and production.  Only in
 this way can there by vitality. -The present stage of technical service cannot be too
 ambitious.  We should start out from the easy and advance towards the difficult and
 from the typical to the universal.  At present, we must grasp tightly the computer
 applications systems which. are technically more mature, which require less investment,
 which can produce quick results, which are worth popularization in the fields of-
 energy, light and textile industries, transportation and management so that visible
 economic gain can be obtained within a short period.
 Popularization of the application of computers is a strong driving force in the
 development of computer technology and industrial development.  As long as the
 leadership pays attention, grasps the situation tightly,...-the computer industry will
 surely enter a new stage of development under readjustment and will serve its function
 in'the development of the national economy.

 COMPUTER INDUSTRY STRIVING TO CATCH UP WITH WEST
 Beijing DIANZI SHIJIE [ELECTRONICS WORLD] in Chinese No 4 1981 p 5
 [Article:  "A Brief History of Chinese Computers"]
 [Text] According to the American J. Bernstein, "By at least 450 BC, the abacus
 was already being used as the first digital calculator."  COMPUTER MONTHLY
 reports, "The earliest predecessor of the computer can be traced back to the
 abacus, which appeared in 600 BC in China and 400 BC in Egypt."  China's
 abacus appeared 200 years earlier than that of Egypt, and so obviously, the
 predecessor of the computer must be traced back to China.  This means that our
 forefathers made a historical contribution to the origin of computers.
 In 1946, the first-generation computer was born.  In 1958, the second-generation
 computer appeared abroad.  Our nation's scientist Wu Jikang [0702 0415 1660]
 designed our nation's first electron tube computer, based on the URAL-2 computer.
 In the same'year, our nation successfully developed the 103 model (DJS-1 model)
 computer.  In 1959, we produced the 104 model (DJS-2 model) computer.  Our nation's
 computers are designated by the heading DJS followed by an Arabic numeral.  DJS
 represents the initial letters of the Chinese spelling of Dian (electronic),
 Ji (calculation), and Shu (numbers)--i.e., the electronic digital computer.
 Through the untiring efforts of the broad scientific and technical workers on
 the computer battlefront, by overcoming various difficulties they finally developed
 and produced a second-generation computer (transistorized computer) in 1964 and
 1965.  Representative products were the 108-B model (DJS-6), and 121 model
 (DJS-21), the X-2 model, and the 441-B model.
 The transision from a first-generation product to a second-generation product
 took 12 years for foreigners, but China borrowing the knowhow from foreign
 products, needed only 7 years.  The relative rate of development was fast, and as
 it continues at this rate, China's development in computers has a bright future.
 However, a movement "unprecedented in history" hindered the development of
 computers.
 In the 1970's, computers were being used on a widespread basis in foreign nations
 when a fourth-generation computer emerged.  However, our nation's third-generation
 computer had only begun to come out in 1971.  Representative products were the

 709 (TQ-16) model, with a computing speed of 200,000 times per second,  In 1972,
 the large 160 computer (DJS-11), with integrated circuits capable of 1 million
 computations per second, was successfully developed.  In 1976, the Computational
 Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully developed the.013
 computer, capable of 2 million computations per second.  In 1978, the Huadong
 Computational Institute successfully developed a large computer capable of 5
 million computations per second.  In small computers, the Fourth Ministry of
 Machine Building organized and led the joint design work for the DJS-100 series.
 In August 1974, the DJS-130 model computer was successfully developed.  That
 computer imitated the NOVA 1200 computer in design.  There are also DJS-180
 series computers and DJS-154 series computers.
 The Changzhou Radio Plant developed the DJS-110 model in 1977; DJS-200 series
 computers came out in 1978; then, various types of products emerged, such as
 the DJS-210 model of Changzhou and Nanjing, the DJS-240 model and DJS-160 model
 of Beijing, the DJS-220 model of Beijing and Shanghai, and the DJS-140 model
 computer successfully developed in May 1979.
 At present, our nation's DJS-100 series computers are widely used.  In this regard,
 more manpower and materials have been invested and greater results achieved.
 Qinghua University and other units already have ALGOL 60, BASIC, and FORTRAN IV
 program languages on DJS-130 computers.  Qinghua University and Wuhan University
 have successfully developed. multiple-user expanded BASIC software without magnetic
 disks.  Thus, 16 users can use the same machine at the same time.  In addition,
 the Shanghai Computer Plant uses BASIC and FORTRAN languages on its DJS-131
 computer.  At the same time, the TQDL 2 model multiplex communications control
 device has been developed as an accessory.  The Shanghai Computer Plant and the
 Nanjing Engineering Academy have developed the MRTOS real-time operating system
 for use on the DJS-131 computer.  Thus the scope of application of the DJS-100
 series has been expanded and. its functions are fuller.
 Our nation now can design and manufacture fourth-generation computers ourselves.
 In 1977, the first microcomputer, the DJS-50, was successfully developed in Beijing
 and Hefei.  In November 1978, the Shangwu No 14 Plant announced the DJS-051
 computer.  In May 1979, the Shanghai Computational Institute, the Shanghai
 Metallurgy Institute, the Shanghai Semiconductor Institute, the Wuxi Jiangnan
 Radio Equipment Plant, and the Changzhou Semiconductor Plant jointly developed
 the N-groove silicon grid MOS large-scale integrated-circuit single-chip
 microprocessor for the DJS-052 model.
 In 1980, the 1932 Institute of the Fourth Ministry of Machine Building developed
 the 905-computer system; this computer is the fastest and has the largest
 capacity in our nation at present.
 In addition, our nation's Taiwan Province also has developed a computer industry.
 According'to reports on the--subject, 307 computers were installed and put into
 use in 1980, including-120 microcomputers, 55 small computers, 75 medium computers,
 and 57 large computers.
 Our nation has also imported large computers, small computers, and microcomputers
 from IBM, DEC, and INTEL.

 The scope of application of computers in our nation has already included
 scientific computation, real-time control, information retrieval, communications,
 postal and telegraph services, medical science, electric power, chemical
 engineering, and textiles.  The DJS-131 computer has been used by the Nanxiang
 Marshaling yards of the Shanghai Railroad Administration, the Wangting Powerplant,
 the Nanjing General Military Hospital, and the Xinanjiang Powerplant.
 In our nation, intelligent machines have been applied in pattern recognition,
 machine proof, and robots.  Some are in a leading position in the world.
 For example, the Acoustics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has a
 computer that can understand human speech.  A small, general-purpose computer, it
 can use verbal commands that directly control it to perform addition, subtraction,
 multiplication, division, and power computations.  This is an application in sound
 recognition and pattern recognition.  It is a leader in the world.  It is said
 that, except for a desktop computer that can listen to verbal commands to solve
 mathematical problems, shown at an exhibition in Tokyo, Japan, there has never
 been a machine like ours.
 An intelligent computer system for Chinese medical, science developed by Li Taihang
 [2621 1132 5300] of the Shanghai Computing Technology Institute can diagnose
 diseases and write prescriptions.  Evaluations by experts indicate that the
 diagnoses and prescriptions are consistent with those of experienced Chinese medical
 doctors.
 Renowned mathematician Professor Wu Wenjun [0702 2429 0193] has used a computer
 to solve the problem of mechanical proofs of certain theorems in plane geometry
 and differential geometry, and he has also discovered new theorems.
 In general, China's computers, whether in the varieties produced, the quantities,
 or their practical applications, have reached a definite level.  Foreigners
 predict:  "Software systems are the decisive factor in determining whether China
 can catch up with the world's advanced levels by the year 2000.1'
