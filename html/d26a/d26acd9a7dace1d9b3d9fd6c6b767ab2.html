 Soviet officials admit publicly that narcotics consumption in the USSR
 has almost doubled since 1984, with 50,000 citizens currently listed as
 addicts.                                   the government has
 distributed a million leaflets cautioning young people against
 experimenting with narcotics. Recent Soviet press accounts include

 Comment: Moscow is anxious to project a more positive international

 social malaise that has contributed to widespread alcoholism in the

 The Central American nations are close to agreement on the
 draft treaty for a re ional parliament, but few believe it will be an

 ,be ieves   ristian Democratic parties will be able to dominate the
 parliament and thereby keep pressure on Nicaragua for democracy,
 while deterring military coups in the other countries. Carpio, who
 has played a key role in Guatemala's campaign to establish the
 parliament, claims the organization will foster political integration by
 choosing government representatives for regional economic
 institutions.                                                        25X1
 The Vice Presidents agreed when they last met three weeks ago that
 the parliament would have 110 members-20 delegates from each
 country as well as the president and vice president of each of the five
 states. Proposals for a smaller body were rejected to ensure
 proportional representation for all ideological positions. Carpio does
 not expect elections to be held for at least a year, allowing for
 ratification by the legislatures, the selection of candidates, and a
 three-month campaign.
 Comment: Guatemala considers the parliament its contribution to
 peace efforts and has been pushing hard to wrap up the negotiations.
 Although there is not a lot on the table to fight about, the other
 democracies are unenthusiastic because they believe the parliament
 will be more a forum for debating vaguely worded, nonbinding
 resolutions than a mechanism for advancing democracy or resolving
 regional disputes. Increasing the size of the parliament probably will
 make it more representative but less responsive to government
 The schedule Carpio outlined does not meet the Central American
 peace accord's specification that elections be held in the first half of
 1988 and thus avoids an early test of Nicaragua's commitment to free
 elections. Moreover, the democracies are not likely to amend
 provisions that allow each country to set its electoral rules. They         25X1

 required by the peace accord-will ensure fair balloting.

 Under the commercial bank accord signed last month, Buenos Aires

 that the international financial community is likely to reject his
 suggestion that the discounted value of debt instruments be used as

 Recently released trade data indicate the USSR recorded a
 $1.2 billion hard currency trade surplus during the first half of this
 year, as contrasted with a $1 billion deficit during the same period last
 year. Hard currency exports climbed 9 percent, to $13 billion, largely
 because of an estimated 25-percent increase in the volume of oil
 exports. Imports dropped 8 percent, to $11.8 billion, because of a
 lower grain import bill and cutbacks in purchases of machinery and
 on imports for the remainder of this year. Confusion and inactivity

 Comment: Improved oil revenues will bring hard currency export
 earnings to their highest level in two years but still below the levels

 years to help offset declining oil revenues. Barring major problems

 Consequences of Leaving the Commonwealth
 Fiji faces possible serious political and economic repercussions in
 withdrawing from the Commonwealth, an issue likely to figure in
 discussions at the Commonwealth heads-of-state summit opening on
 13 October in Canada.
 - Suva could lose as much as $9 million annually in foreign aid
 from Commonwealth members.
 - Markets in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand for sugar, Fiji's
 major foreign exchange earner, may also be at risk.
 - Fiji would lose an experienced judiciary that is part of the
 Commonwealth and the politically neutral advice of the
 Governor General.
 - India would be likely to veto any Fijian petition to return to the
 Commonwealth because of Fiji's racial discrimination against
 ethnic Indians.

 FIJI: Coup Leader Declares Republic
 Coup leader Lieutenant Colonel Rabuka yesterday declared Fiji will
 be a republic, thereby suspending the constitution and effectively
 severing links to the British Commonwealth. Although the Governor
 General Ganilau has refused to resign, Rabuka nonetheless
 reportedly will establish an interim military council that will include
 some prominent civilians. According to press reports, the UK's review
 of the $1.6 million in annual aid it provides Fiji has prompted a Libyan
 offer to make up any shortfall. Australia and New Zealand are also
 cutting off assistance, and their labor unions have promised to do
 what they can to disrupt trade with Fiji.
 Comment: The economic repercussions of withdrawal from the
 Commonwealth are not likely to deter Rabuka from his immediate
 goal of ensuring the political dominance of native Fijians. He and his
 new government are sure to exclude Indians rather than risk losing
 the support of Fiji's traditional Council of Chiefs and the growing
 Taukei Movement, a radical group that claims to represent 97 percent
 of native Fijians.
 PAKISTAN-SAUDI ARABIA: Pakistani Troops May Leave
 x
 Pakistan and Saudi Arabia apparently are preparing for the
 withdrawal of some 8,000 Pakistani combat troops from the Kingdom,
 includin air defense units from the Eastern Province
 that negotiations are also Under way on the
 status o severa tnousand Pakistani military advisers and technicians.
 The Saudis have begun preparations to store the equipment used by
 the Pakistanis and are recruiting additional Saudi troops to soften the
 impact of losing the Kingdom's only fully manned combat brigade.
 Riyadh has concluded agreements with Morocco and Bangladesh to
 send troops if Saudi Arabia is directly threatened.
 Comment: If the troops are withdrawn-probably for financial
 reasons-Saudi Arabia would lose its best armored brigade and a
 significant part of the army's combat strength, as well as experienced
 air defense crews. Riyadh has wanted to replace the Pakistanis since
 at least 1985 but might still decide to extend the contract, especially if
 there is another sharp rise in tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran
 like the one that followed the Mecca riots this summer. Nearly all
 Pakistani troops, however, currently are under orders not to fight the
 Iranians.

 PERU: Bank Nationalization Bill Passes

 Comment: The bank nationalization will improve Lima's ability to
 oversee foreign exchange movements and to finance priority
 economic projects but will probably further reduce investor
 confidence, depressing savings and private investment. The measure
 has already generated fear among businessmen that more
 nationalizations and interventions will occur. In an apparent attempt
 to regain private-sector support, Garcia has named industrialist
 Alberto Vera La Rosa, a ruling-party activist, as Industry Minister, but
 business response has been lukewarm. If Garcia continues to
 antagonize the private sector, reinvestment of profits will fall off, and

 Key Chinese Industrial Reforms
 Enterprise Management
 Status: Beijing is implementing "enterprise responsibility systems" in which factories are
 granted operational autonomy but are held responsible for their own profits and losses. These
 have been established in only about half of the state enterprises. But factories now retain a
 larger share of revenues, have greater discretion over how they are used, and can market
 overquota production at "negotiated" above-plan prices.
 Problems: Debate continues over the role of party secretaries in factories and how to
 prohibit excessive investment and wage hikes.
 Price
 Status: Many prices are little changed from the 1950s. But in the past three years, Beijing has
 decontrolled prices of nonstaples, such as vegetables and meat; some durable goods,
 including bicycles and refrigerators; and minor commodities.
 Problems: Leaders are concerned that price reforms, which have contributed to bouts of
 inflation, may stir popular discontent. They differ over the use of administrative price
 adjustments or relaxation of state controls to affect price reform.
 Labor
 Status: Beijing plans to boost labor productivity by rewarding initiative with higher wages and
 by allowing workers increased say in job placement. Last fall, Beijing established guidelines
 for hiring new workers under fixed-term contracts that, if followed, would end lifetime job
 guarantees for employees in state enterprises. Most managers, however, are still unable to
 fire unproductive workers.
 Problems: Large state enterprises are entirely responsible for housing, education, and
 health needs of their workers. Because local authorities object to bearing these costs if
 workers are laid off, Beijing continues to guarantee full employment.
 Bankruptcy
 Status: Reform leaders want to increase productivity and financial accountability for state
 enterprises. Last December, Beijing approved trial bankruptcy regulations, but the.
 implementation has been blocked by political infighting.
 Problems: Party hardliners believe these reforms are inconsistent with socialism. Others
 argue that managers should not be held accountable for losses as long as the price
 system is irrational and factory decision making is subject to bureaucratic interference.
 Ownership
 Status: Last year, Beijing conducted limited experiments with leasing small factories to
 individuals and allowed a few enterprises to issue shares to their workers.
 Problems: Conservatives strongly oppose allowing state enterprises to issue shares to
 workers and believe that private enterprise should be strictly limited.

 Special Analysis
 Deng Xiaoping and Acting General Secretary Zhao Ziyang have
 publicly asserted that Beijing will quicken the pace of economic
 reforms after China's 13th Party Congress, which convenes on
 25 October. Because of leadership squabbling and
 economy, however, price reform and some key market-oriented
 po -cies are likely to remain stalled. Senior reform-minded
 Chinese officials fear that, unless Beijing can soon settle
 disagreements over reform goals and strategy, economic
 problems w ll,1ntensify and popular support for reforms will
 Disagreement over economic policy has been intense since the ouster
 of Hu Yaobang as party General Secretary in January. The more
 traditionalist party officials have attacked a number of reforms as
 "capitalist," including the reduction of central planning, the
 diminished role of party secretaries in state enterprises, and the
 leasing of small factories to individuals. These more orthodox officials
 have also taken advantage of rising inflation and a growing
 government budget deficit to criticize reformers for economic
 mismanagement-arguing that tighter central controls are required
 Consequences of Uncertain Leadership
 Because of strong inflationary pressure and political opposition,
 reform leaders have had to delay market-oriented policies, including
 price reform and bankruptcy legislation. This, in turn, has frustrated
 efforts to enforce financial accountability by state enterprises, and
 managers can still increase investment spending and wages without
 corresponding increases in productivity, which adds to inflation.
 ministries that oppose market competition.
 As a compromise, reform leaders have chosen a lowest-common-
 denominator policy that forces state enterprises to sign performance
 contracts with upper level economic bureaucracies. Some reformist
 officials, however, fear this may strengthen the heavy industry
 municipal halls.
 Uncertain economic leadership also has hampered reformers from
 using monetary and fiscal policies to ease inflationary pressures.
 Beijing has been unable, for example, to stop spending by local
 governments on low-priority construction projects, such as hotels and

 In addition, branches of China's central bank are ignoring directives
 to limit credit and continue to fund whatever projects local officials
 want; previous reforms gave local governments a greater share of tax
 revenues, making them less dependent on funds from central coffers.
 Leaders who are counting on the support of local officials at the party
 congress have rejected proposals to restrict provincial control over
 ank loans and taxes,,-     gto4 e-  -E-  aeeyW Beijing,
 therefore, has been forced to reimpose price contro s on some
 products and tighten restrictions on how state enterprises can use
 their retained earnings.

 are the children of senior officials.
 Senior Chinese economists nonetheless fear that support will erode
 unless Beijing can check inflation and corruption. Some Chinese
 officials, by exploiting loopholes in reform policies, for example, have
 used their connections to purchase goods at low government-set
 prices and resell them at much higher market prices. Public cynicism
 reportedly has begun to grow because many of the people involved
 risen rapidly over the past few years,
 use of enterprise contracts.
 Despite these problems, Deng, Zhao, and other reform leaders remain
 firmly committed to using market mechanisms to drive China's
 modernization. Recently they have claimed that the party congress
 will approve new guidelines sanctioning market-oriented policies and
 that Beijing will hasten implementation of reforms later this year.
 Despite the upbeat rhetoric, a cautious agenda for next year may
 already have been set. Vice Premier Yao Yilin, a senior spokesman on
 economic policy, argued in a major speech last week that Beijing
 must implement an austerity program for several years and focus
 reform on improving enterprise operations-such as expanding the
 planning.
 Decisions by the party congress thus will do little to reduce the degree
 of contention over economic policy. By treating the symptoms of
 China's economic problems rather than the disease-lack of
 accountability to market forces-Beijing probably has delayed
 reaching the point when it will have adequate monetary and fiscal
 tools to ease inflationary pressures generated by reduced central
