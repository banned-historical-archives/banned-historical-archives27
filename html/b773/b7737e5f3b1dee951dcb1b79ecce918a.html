 THE VIETNAM SITUATION
 General Khanh's removal from power, apparently the in-
 tention of both the coup and countercoup last week, does
 not improve prospects for armed forces unity or political
 stability.  The pace of Viet Cong activity, meanwhile,
 has stepped up considerably, and both China and North
 Vietnam appear to have taken steps last week to bolster
 their defenses.   While neither Peiping nor Hanoi has
 shown any interest so far in making negotiations on
 Vietnam feasible, Moscow is privately urging the US to
 consider some sort of neogitated settlement.

 On the issue of free discussion among artists and writers,

 THE VIETNAM SITUATION
 As a result of the abortive
 coup and the successful counter-
 coup in South Vietnam on 19-20
 February, General Khanh has been
 deposed as military commander in
 chief and sent into temporary
 exile as a "roving ambassador."
 The status of the civilian gov-
 ernment of Phan Huy Quat has not
 been affected.   The removal of
 Khanh, apparently a primary
 goal of both the attempted coup
 and of the generals who quashed
 it, seems unlikely to unify the
 armed forces, or to usher in
 early political stability.
 The appointment of General
 Tran Van "Little" Minh as "act-
 ing commander in chief" looks
 like an interim compromise while
 the more ambitious "young Turk"
 generals, such as I Corps Com-
 mander Thi and air force Chief
 Ky, maneuver to obtain ultimate
 control of the military.)
 The pro-Catholic, anti-Bud-
 dhist, and even pro-Diem over-
 tones of the coup attempt now
 appear to have sharpened reli-
 gious  animosities.   Although
 the Buddhist leaders distrusted
 Khanh, they appear to suspect
 that his ouster may be partly
 aimed against them and that it
 may have had US blessing. They
 give no indication of any inten-
 tion to protest and have limited
 themselves to voicing support
 for the Quat government,  but
 there are growing signs that
 they may be looking toward a ne-
 gotiated settlement to resolve
 South Vietnam's problems. They
 still speak,  however, of a Viet-
 nam divided between a Communist
 North and a non-Communist South.
 The pace of Viet Cong ac-
 tivity meanwhile has stepped
 up considerably.   Although the
 bulk of this activity is still
 harassment and sabotage, armed
 attacks appear on the rise.
 Heavy fighting has occurred for
 several days at a point on the
 east-west road linking the gov-
 ernment's II Corps headquarters
 at Pleiku in the central high-
 lands with its supply depots at
 Qui Nhon on the coast.
 In the central and north-
 ern provinces, the Viet Cong
 have further encroached on areas
 formerly controlled by the gov-
 ernment.   In the coastal prov-
 inces of Quang Ngai and Binh
 Dinh, and increasingly farther
 south in Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa
 provinces, government troops
 have pulled back into the

 immediate vicinity of district
 capitals.   Viet Cong sabotage,
 which has closed the main north-
 south highway in Phu Yen and
 Binh Dinh, and the coastal rail-
 road between the cities of Nha
 Trang and Da Nang, is helping

 The sinking on 17 February
 of a camouflaged vessel off Phu
 Yen Province, and the subsequent
 discovery of an estimated 80-

 support through sea infiltra-

 Both Communist China and
 North Vietnam appear to have

 to bolster their defenses.
 The Chinese Communists
 have taken further steps to im-
 prove air defenses in South
 China.

 second new airfield near the

 consider some sort of negotiated
 settlement.   In the two weeks
 following the flare-up in the
 Vietnam situation, the Soviet
 Union adopted a noncommittal at-
 titude toward the possibility of
 negotiations.   Soviet officials
 informed the French and British
 ambassadors that there could be
 no question of negotiations
 while US bombings continue.
 Moscow's lack of initiative has
 resulted in part from the Soviet
 leaders' desire to avoid an
 open divergence with the Hanoi
 and Peiping regimes.   The USSR
 probably also wishes to play
 for time to assess further de-
 velopments in US policy.
 The Soviet press, however,
 continues to report differences
 between the US and its allies
 and proposals by Western lead-
 ers for convening a conference.
 In line with this course, So-
 viet Ambassador Vinogradov's
 23 February call on President
 de Gaulle seemed aimed at fo-
 cusing attention on the crisis
 and at isolating the US on the
 question of a negotiated set-
 tlement.
 The Chinese Communists
 and North Vietnamese so far
 have showed no interest in
 making it possible to hold ne-
 gotiations on the Vietnam sit-
 uation.   Both Peiping and Hanoi
 continue to call for unilateral
 withdrawal of US forces from
 South Vietnam as the only pos-
 sibly solution.   Chou En-lai,
 for example,  in a message to
 the Indo-Chinese People's Con-
 ference in Phnom Penh on 23
 February, stated that the US
 must withdraw its military
 -forces from Indochina   "com-

 After disposing of essential
 business on a "no-objection" basis,
 and thanks to the US acquiescence
 in a "procedural" vote, the 19th
 UN General Assembly session ad-
 journed on 18 February until 1
 September.   The intervening period
 will permit further negotiations on
 the financial crisis and future
 peacekeeping operations by the big
 powers and by a committee of 30-
 odd members to be appointed by
 President Quaison-Sackey.   However,
 the whole process of vacillation
 and evasion has brought discredit
 to the UN.
 The assembly by a vote  of 97
 to 2, with 13 abstentions,* beat
 back an Albanian maneuver--pre-
 sumably instigated by Peiping--to
 disrupt the consensus procedure
 under which the session had been
 operating since 1 December.   The
 surprise Albanian ploy was designed
 to precipitate a confrontation be-
 tween the US and the USSR at the
 last hour over the arrears ques-
 tion and voting rights.  Most UN
 members believed that since the
 Albanian delegate could not be
 persuaded to desist, the US should
 save the day and the UN by avoid-
 ing the confrontation.   The vote
 was taken on the basis it would
 "not involve or prejudice" the
 question of Article 19.   The as-
 sembly president ruled before the
 vote that it was without prejudice
 to the legal positions of the
 various members.
 In general, UN representa-
 tives reacted very favorably to
 the US handling of the problem.   A
 canvass of Latin American delegates
 revealed that the group as a whole
 was "much relieved" and believed
 that the final vote was favorable
 to the US world posture.   The Latin
 Americans, who usually take a very
 legalistic view of the UN charter,
 also felt that the strictly jurid-
 ical situation involving Article
 19 was saved by the US explanatory
 statement.   However, Soviet Ambas-
 sador Fedorenko contended publicly
 on 24 February that the US has lost
 its fight by agreeing to a roll
 call vote, thus making the penalty
 question a "dead issue."
 Despite general relief that a
 showdown has been averted for the
 time being, the formidable problem
 of negotiating some settlement on
 the arrears question remains.   The
 composition of what promises to be
 a cumbersome committee is still un-
 settled--presumably Nationalist
 China will be excluded in order to
 get Moscow's participation.   The
 fact that for three months most
 assembly members have preferred to
 relinquish their own right to vote
 rather than to deprive financial
 delinquents of theirs will not make
 the secretary general's dues-col-
 lecting any easier.   Above all,  it
 would seem that, despite valiant
 efforts, the General Assembly is
 slated to lose at least those pow-
 ers granted to it by the 1950
 "uniting for peace" resolution
 which made it virtually coequal
 with the Security Council in peace-
 keeping.

 The Soviet leaders appar-
 ently have decided to proceed
 with the Communist meeting
 scheduled for 1 March.
 The Italian, Bulgarian, and
 East German parties have announced
 that they are sending delega-
 tions to Moscow.  Peiping and
 the Chinese-oriented parties--
 the Albanian, Japanese, Indo-
 nesian, North Korean, and North
 Vietnamese--can be expected to
 boycott the meeting.  Rumania,
 in addition, has refused to at-
 tend any meeting unless all the
 invited parties attend.   Moscow,
 therefore, probably can count
 on, at most, 19 of the 26 mem-
 bers of the "editorial commis-
 sion." *
 This meeting probably will
 be represented as merely the
 first of a series of preparatory
 sessions which will discuss prob-
 lems  facing the Communist move-
 ment and measures to promote
 unity.   It is unlikely either
 to endorse an early world Com-
 munist conference or to issue
 pronouncements on substantive
 issues in the Sino-Soviet con-
 flict.                           Any communiqud probably
 will be limited to an anodyne
 reference to the value of regu-
 lar consultations in strengthen-
 ing cohesion and a display of
 solidarity in condemning US
 policy in Vietnam and elsewhere.
 The need for Communist bloc
 unity was the main theme of the
 Warsaw Pact meeting in January,
 oil Kosygin's statements in North
 V:Letnam and North Korea, and of
 Soviet treatment of the recent
 15th anniversary of the Sino-
 Soviet Treaty of Friendship,
 Alliance, and Mutual Assist-
 ance.  The Russians are likely
 to avoid any suggestion of con-
 frontation or showdown with the
 Chinese at the 1 March meeting.
 Peiping has renewed its
 attack on the planned meeting
 by rebroadcasting on 20 Febru-
 ary a statement by a pro-Chinese
 Australian Communist leader de-
 nouncing the gathering as a
 continuation of Khrushchev's
 plan to "impose revisionism"
 on the world movement.   The Chi-
 nese may already have set the
 wheels in motion for a meeting
 of their supporters in Peiping--
 something they indirectly threat-
 ened to do last August.

 A major policy statement by
 Pravda's new editor, Aleksey
 Rumyantsev, has defined the new
 regime's position toward the
 Soviet intelligentsia.   The ar-
 ticle affirms the party's command-
 ing position, but its major in-
 tent is to stress the need for
 the "expert" recommendations of
 scientists and economists, and
 thus to sanction their expanding
 role in decision-making.   The
 line is more conservative, how-
 ever, on the issue of free dis-
 cussion among artists and writers.
 Encouragement of scienti-
 fic participation in policy for-
 mulation is pointed up by a
 critical reference to previous
 "distrust and intolerance" of
 the intelligentsia, when "an
 autocratic 'leader,' sure of his
 own infallibility, considered
 himself the supreme arbiter in
 all spheres of human activity."
 The party, asserts Rumyantsev,
 resolutely opposes the unwill-
 ingness of "certain leaders" to
 consider scientific recommenda-
 tions and will not deny the
 exploration of new avenues in
 scientific research because they
 do not yield immediate results.
 Khrushchev is the obvious cul-
 prit here,  and since his ouster,
 scientists have argued for the-
 oretical research unhampered by
 demands for its immediate appli-
 cation.
 Rumyantsev in effect pro-
 vides a theoretical basis for
 some of the trends that have
 developed since Khrushchev's
 ouster.   He cites precedents
 from Lenin for the enlistment
 of academicians and economists
 in elaborating the basic features
 of the economic plan for 1966-
 70 and for the use of experts to
 provide new solutions for manag-
 ing the economy.   The Rumyantsev
 line seems to follow Kosygin's
 pragmatic approach to economic
 administration.
 The article is also compat-
 ible with recent reminders by
 military and party spokesmen
 that military doctrine is formu-
 lated by the party on the "sci-
 entific" recommendations of mil-
 itary professionals.   It further
 suggests that the new leaders
 will continue to encourage open
 discussion of controversial sub-
 jects as they have done with
 Lysenko and Liberman.
 Rumyantsev's comments on
 the artistic intelligentsia con-
 tinued the carefully moderate
 line set in recent editorials
 on cultural policy, criticizing
 past "excesses" but making no
 major concessions to liberal in-
 tellectual interests.   He con-
 demned the injection of personal
 tastes into artistic questions
 by certain "leaders" as well as
 attempts to solve such problems
 by "administrative methods."
 He also appeared to sanction the
 recent defeat of several Stalin-
 ist hold-?overs in cultural and
 scientific organizations with a
 reference to those who had re-
 ceived "undeserved support in
 the not too distant past."  How-
 ever, he reaffirmed the party's
 demand for ideological confor-
 mity in the content of art and
 warned that the struggle against
 "bourgeois ideology" must continue.

 Rumyantsev's call for care-
 ful deliberation in deciding
 whether a given idea is ideolog-
 ically acceptable suggests that
 the regime is not anxious to
 raise the problems of ideologi-
 cal purity in art at this time.
 Although opening the door to
 somewhat greater stylistic ex-
 perimentation, he warned that
 the party cannot tolerate "a
 swamp of ideological emptiness,
 decadence and naked formalism."
 Peiping is becoming increas-
 ingly concerned over dissident
 party members and intellectuals
 and has launched yet another
 drive to discipline them.
 In an unusually frank ad-
 mission in his year-end report
 on the state of the nation,
 Premier Chou En-lai had warned
 that the "sinister winds of capi-
 talism" were still blowing into
 China.   As a result, subversive
 elements were being "ceaselessly
 generated... in party and govern-
 ment organs," invariably trying
 to "find protectors and agents
 in the higher leading organiza-
 tions."  Although claiming that
 only 5 percent of the population
 really opposes the party, Chou
 conceded that some of the re-
 mainder "may follow our lead
 somewhat hesitantly."  To count-
 eract these hostile forces, Chou
 promised an even tougher appli-
 cation of the socialist educa-
 tion campaign then in full swing.
 The party leadership is
 especially disturbed over intel-
 lectuals, regarding some as

 For the first time since
 the Great Leap Forward, criti-
 cism of intellectuals is being
 broadened to include scientists
 and technicians.   From 1961 to
 1964 Peiping consciously tried
 to protect this group from ex-
 cessive political interference,
 but last month the party journal
 Red Flag, once again stressing
 aat it was more important to be
 "Red" than "expert," warned that
 the state could make only limited
 use of the knowledge of natural
 scientists who have faulty polit-
 ical beliefs.
 This harder line probably
 reflects Mao Tse-tung's personal
 position.   Last fall Mao com-
 plained to foreign visitors that
 science students, as well as
 those in other fields,  lacked
 ideological conviction and would
 have to be "steeled" with heavy
 doses of manual labor and indoc-
 trination.   It is not clear how
 far the regime intends to go in
 intruding politics into science,
 but a continuation of the present
 trend will almost certainly im-
 pede the progress of training
 and research programs.

 PEIPING PREPARES FOR AFRO-ASIAN CONFERENCE
 Recent Chinese Communist
 moves in Africa suggest that
 Peiping is stepping up its ef-
 forts to lay the groundwork for
 the second Afro-Asian conference,
 now scheduled to be held in Al-
 giers next June.   During the
 past two weeks the Chinese have
 been concentrating their atten-
 tion on the UAR and Algeria.
 A delegation of high-level
 Chinese foreign policy officials
 arrived in Cairo on 15 February
 for extended talks with the
 Egyptians.  This group includes
 two vice ministers of foreign
 affairs and the head of the For-
 eign Ministry department deal-
 ing with North African and Near
 Eastern affairs.
 The subjects under discus-
 sion have not been announced,
 but plans for joint action in
 Africa and the Middle East are
 probably important items on the
 agenda.  The Chinese may be en-
 gaged in working out preliminary
 arrangements for a visit by Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai.   According to
 a story in the authoritative
 Cairo newspaper Al Ahram last
 December, Chou wars scheduled for
 a swing through the Middle East
 and Africa in March.
 :these visits may since have
 been postponed, however, in view
 of the fact that they apparently
 had been planned to coincide
 with the Afro-Asian conference
 before it was put off from March
 until June.
 Another Chinese delegation
 is in Algiers, taking part in
 the Afro-Asian economic seminar
 sponsored by the Afro-Asian Peo-
 ple's Solidarity Organization
 (AAPSO).   Meetings began on 22
 February and were scheduled to
 last for five days.  This will
 provide an opportunity for im-
 proving the already close rela-
 tions between China and Algeria.
 Shortly before the delegation
 arrived, the Chinese had agreed
 to supply equipment for the mili-
 tia. forces of Algeria's National
 Liberation Front.   Preliminary
 negotiations for this accord
 probably took place last December
 during' a two-week visit to China.
 by high-ranking Algerian mili-
 tia officers.
 While the seminar was going
 on, a 13,000-ton Chinese dry-
 cargo freighter was turned over
 to the Algerian Government on
 24 February.  This gift points
 up the importance Peiping attaches
 to developing closer ties with
 Algiers.  The vessel, purchased
 from Norway in 1964 for $1.5 mil-
 lion, was one of the 15 ships
 assigned to China's international
 shipping fleet.

 EAST GERMANS EXCAVATING DITCHES AROUND WEST BERLIN
 The East Germans have be-
 gun to excavate a series of
 ditches at a number of points
 along the sector and zonal bor-
 ders around West Berlin.  Else-
 where, they are erecting elec-
 trified fences which appear to
 be of a temporary nature.
 The ditches, which are 16
 feet wide and 9 feet deep, ap-
 pear designed to supplement
 existing border fortifications.
 In time, they may replace the
 combination of barbed wire,
 cleared strips, and barricades
 which ring the Western sectors
 adjacent to East Germany, though
 not all the Wall runnin  throw h
 the center of Berlin.
 "cla.im the Ulbricht
 regime p ans to "modernize" the
 sector/zonal borders by 1970,
 replacing the barriers erected
 since August 1961 with a ditch
 backed by a high wire fence and
 a paved concrete or macadam
 strip suitable for vehicular
 patrols.
 The East Germans have
 massed approximately 140 bull-
 dozers at Busendorf, a, military
 training area just outside the
 city, apparently as a, prelude
 to an all-out effort to complete
 the ditchdigging.   With this
 equipment they could do so this
 year and--with additional equip-
 ment, especially heavy-duty
 ea.rthmovers--probably by Sep-
 tember, at a minimum cost of
 $2 million.   About 40,000 tons
 of concrete would be required
 to line the entire excavation
 at a, cost of an additional $9
 million--to prevent washout.
 Such an expenditure is within
 the regime's capability and
 would not unduly strain the econ-
 omy.
 One 1,600-ya.rd ditch now
 has been dug, and work is under
 way ,at five other sites oppo-
 site the British and French sec-
 tors.
 The expense and effort re-
 quired to ring the city are
 hardly warranted by the refugee
 flow---fewer than 600 escapes in
 the Berlin area. in 1964.  Rather
 it would appear that the system
 of ditches is designed to soften
 the more objectionable features
 of the existing fortifications
 and to highlight West Berlin's
 physical separation from the
 surrounding territory.   In time,
 the ditches may permit some re-
 duction in the number of border
 guards patrolling the sector/
 zonal borders.. Poor border
 guard morale is a chronic prob-
 lem   for the Ulbricht regime.
 The equivalent of three guard
 companies have fled into West
 Berlin since August 1961.

 The threat of a Communist

 sharply reduced by the conflict be-

 the two factions together have long

 NEW TURMOIL IN THE BRAZZAVILLE CONGO
 Tension and confusion have
 been running high for two weeks
 in Congo (Brazzaville) amid
 signs that the continuing power
 struggle between the leftist
 regime's extremist and more
 pragmatic elements has entered
 another active phase.   The most
 clearly discernible effect so
 far has been an acceleration of
 the country's steady slide to-
 ward anarchy.
 The new crisis began on
 12 February with a radio speech
 by Premier Lissouba,  a pragmatic
 leftist, alleging an elaborate
 plot to overthrow his government
 and partition both Congos for
 the benefit of "imperialists."
 Characteristically he implicated
 Tshombd,  who he said was conniv-
 ing with a variety of Western
 interests--mostly European.  Lis-
 souba advised his listeners not
 to be "astonished" by any "sport-
 ing events" they might soon see.
 Five days later,  with ten-
 sion and rumors mounting, Braz-
 zaville radio announced that
 three prominent civil servants
 had been abducted on the night
 of 15-16 February and that the
 bodies of two of them had been
 recovered.   It blamed "unknown
 commandos" sent by the plotters
 from Leopoldville to sow unrest
 in Brazzaville's civil adminis-
 tration.
 That same day,  however,  Lis-
 souba told the US ambassador,
 while insinuating a US role in
 the alleged conspiracy,  that the
 three victims were themselves
 in on the plot and had been dis-
 posed of either by local "Portu-
 ;guese nationals" who feared ex-
 posure or by freewheeling extrem-
 ists of the Brazzaville regime's
 youth organization (JMNR).
 The US Embassy is convinced
 that the three officials, all
 known as moderates who disap-
 proved of the regime,  were in
 fact murdered by JMNR militants
 acting on instructions from ex-
 tremists bent on consolidating
 their power position. Youth
 leaders are closely associated
 with the ruling party's most
 extreme leftist elements, nota-
 bly politburo secretaries Bou-
 kambou and Noumazalay. The em-
 bassy's conviction is supported
 by a spate of recent arrests,
 including at least one moderate
 cabinet minister, and by the
 thrust and timing of regime
 propaganda and news releases.
 On 19 February it was announced
 that a committee had been created
 to help "accomplish the work of
 the government," with membership
 drawn from party institutions
 dominated by extremists.
 Many aspects of the Brazza-
 ville power struggle remain ob-
 scure,  including the position
 of Lissouba, who is probably the
 extremists' main target.   Simi-
 larly,  little has been heard
 lately of enigmatic President
 Massamba-Debat, who is not him-
 self an ideological leftist

 UGANDA STILL EMBROILED IN LEOPOLDVILLE CONGO REBELLION
 Events this week threaten
 to cause further serious diffi-
 culties between Uganda and the
 Congo.   Incidents along their
 border continue, the latest re-
 ported to have occurred on 22
 February when aircraft bombed
 a missionary school four miles
 inside Uganda., injuring some
 children  and  damasxinrr  hiiildino
 The Uga.nda.n forces--appar-
 ently two companies--which en-
 tered the Congo on 14-17 Feb-
 ruary have reportedly now with-
 drawn to their own territory.
 They made no significant gains
 and suffered moderate losses.
 Leopoldville claims to have
 recaptured Ka.sindi, one of the
 points where the Ugandans crossed
 the border.  Rebel forces, how-
 ever, are still in control at
 Mahagi, where the second incur-
 sion occurred.
 Although Obote has
 long supported the rebels, his
 emotional state and his long-
 standing fears of an invasion
 ,of Uganda by mercenaries sug-
 gest that his moves were an ir-
 rational response to the bomb-
 ing of an Ugandan customs post
 on 13 February.
 This week end, the OAU
 foreign ministers meet in Nai--
 robi.  Tshombd reportedly plans
 to attend, although some radi-
 cal states may attempt to block
 his participation.   At this
 gathering, the African mod-
 erates, reinforced by the  re-
 cent Nouakchott meeting  of
 French-speaking  states, may
 take a. stronger stand in support
 of the Congolese premier.

 FRANCE'S POLICY OBJECTIVES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 French Foreign Minister
 Couve de Murville's fervent ad-
 vocacy of a negotiated Vietnam
 settlement during his mid-Feb-
 ruary Washington visit implies
 a stepped-up diplomatic offen-
 sive for a peaceful solution.
 Paris has maintained that peace
 and stability in Southeast Asia
 can be achieved only through
 neutralization of the entire
 area, and that only neutraliza-
 tion will avert an escalation
 of the present conflict or a
 humiliating Western withdrawal.
 France is now pressing for an
 international conference to
 reach a settlement.
 In an official statement
 on 10 February, French Informa-
 tion Minister Peyrefitte reaf-
 firmed his government's belief
 that solution of the problems
 of Southeast Asia must come
 through an international agree-
 ment conforming to the princi-
 ples expounded at the 1954
 Geneva Conference.   De Gaulle
 sounded the same theme last
 week in an exchange of views
 with Cambodian Prince Sihanouk.
 Paris press reports that France
 would not support the US in a
 war with Communist China prob-
 ably reflect an official atti-
 tude in view of the French con-
 tention that a Western military
 victory in Vietnam is impossible.
 The 1954 Geneva formula con-
 tains three principal ingredients:
 a negotiated cease-fire, with-
 drawal of foreign forces, and
 the eventual reunification of
 North and South Vietnam.   De
 Gaulle would not regard as
 disastrous the possibility that
 a unified Vietnam might profess
 a formal commitment to Commu-
 nism, since he believes in the
 inevitable preponderance of
 national over ideological con-
 siderations.   He would expect
 the eventual emergence of a
 "nationalist Communist" regime
 ready to play off the USSR
 against Communist China.
 Paris thinks it has an
 "honest-broker" role in a dis-
 cussion of a Southeast Asian
 settlement not only because of
 its past interest and influence
 there but also because of its
 diplomatic access to all inter-
 ested parties.
 De Gaulle of course is
 motivated also by his drive to
 establish France's claim to big-
 power status.   He would expect
 France's prestige to be improved
 as a result of its contribution
 to solution of a problem involv-
 ing the major powers.   He also
 expects France to regain a posi-
 t:Lon of some influence, albeit
 admittedly secondary to China's,
 in an area with traditional
 French ties.

 Soviet-Cuban trade will
 register a significant increase
 this year, considerably beyond
 the previous peaks of about
 $635 million set in 1962 and
 1964.  This increase is made
 possible in part by Soviet will-
 ingness to finance another sub-
 stantial imbalance in trade.
 Moscow has agreed to pro-
 vide $170 million worth of goods
 on credit this year--raising its
 cumulative balance-of-payments
 support for Cuba to over $750
 million.   For its part, Cuba is
 to increase 1965 exports to the
 USSR by about $70 million--
 shipping 2.1 million tons of
 sugar, 500,000 tons more than
 in 1964.   Neither the five-year
 trade pact nor the 1965 proto-
 col just signed indicates whether
 the USSR will continue the prac-
 tice of paying $20 million in
 hard currencies for 20 percent
 of the first million tons of
 sugar it buys.   Under its long-
 term sugar purchase contract,
 however,  it is committed to pay
 six cents per pound which, in
 view of current low sugar prices,
 represents sizable nonreimbur-
 sable aid to Cuba.
 It is estimated that So-
 viet imports from Cuba will
 reach about $300 million and
 that over $450 million worth of
 Soviet goods may be delivered
 this year.   The USSR will con-
 tinue to meet Cuba's requirements
 for essential fuels, foodstuffs,
 raw materials, and equipment.
 Moscow recently paid $40 million
 in hard currency for 500,000 tons
 of Canadian wheat and flour for
 shipment to Cuba.   It also con-
 tinues deliveries under its $325
 million development credits, and
 is expected to continue to main-
 tain some 2,000 economic techni-
 cians in Cuba.
 By contrast, Cuba's pur-
 chases from the West will be
 smaller this year than last be-
 cause it has used most of its
 Western credits and the foreign
 exchange it earned while sugar
 prices were high.
 This squandering of wind-
 fall revenues, and other aspects
 of Cuba's economic mismanage-
 ment, presumably came in for
 Soviet criticism during the re-
 cent lengthy trade negotiations
 with Cuban ministers of economy,
 industry, and agriculture, as
 we:Ll as foreign trade.   Moscow,
 however, is fully backing the
 Cuban drive to restore and im-
 prove agricultural production.
 Unprecedented deliveries of So-
 viet agricultural equipment are
 expected to play an important
 role in increasing sugar produc-
 tion this year--by at least ten
 percent.

 Cuba's satisfaction with
 its long-term, guaranteed-price
 sugar contract with the USSR
 has encouraged it to attempt
 similar arrangements with major
 free world purchasers.   Spain
 has been the most amenable to
 date, and Cuban negotiators
 have had limited success with
 Morocco and Japan.
 Cuba has signe  a
 five-year agreement under which
 Spain will pay 6.71 cents per
 pound for an annual minimum of
 120,000 tons of sugar.   The
 Spanish will gradually increase
 purchases through 1970, with the
 option of buying up to 200,000
 tons annually.
 Spain's willingness to pay a
 premium price may also have
 been increased by Cuba's hints
 that it was considering indem-
 nification for Spanish proper-
 ties nationalized in Cuba.
 Havana announced on 20 Feb-
 ruary a commercial agreement un-
 der which Morocco will buy 565,-
 000 tons of Cuban sugar in
 1966-67.   Morocco will pay 3.15
 cents per pound and payments in
 convertible currency will fall
 from 35 percent in 1966 to 25
 percent in 1967.
 Cuban officials seem con-
 vinced that this type of longer
 term agreement provides the
 soundest basis for Cuban eco-
 nomic and financial planning.
 They can be expected to continue
 efforts to arrange similar ac-
 cords with other free world coun-
 tries.   Nevertheless, despite
 these longer term agreements and
 the expected increase in the
 1965 sugar crop,  the drop in
 sugar prices in the last 12
 months will seriously reduce Ha-
 vana's 1965 buying power in the
 West .,

 CONSERVATIVE LEADER ATTACKS BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT POLICIES
 Guanabara Governor Carlos
 Lacerda is sharpening his opposi-
 tion to Brazilian President
 Castello Branco's policies.   He
 delivered his strongest public
 attack on the government thus far
 in a 12 February radio speech in
 which he condemned the adminis-
 tration for allegedly betraying
 the revolution that overthrew the
 Goulart regime last year.   As
 leader of a key state and spokes-
 man for influential conservatives,
 Lacerda's attitude toward the gov-
 ernment is crucial.
 Lacerda focused his attack on
 the issue of free elections, ap-
 parently in reaction to reports
 that Castello Branco is consider-
 ing deferment of gubernatorial
 elections now scheduled for Octo-
 ber in half of Brazil's 22 states.
 The governor is naturally alarmed
 by any action that encourages
 "hard-liners" to continue press-
 ing for cancellation of next
 year's presidential election in
 which he will be a leading con-
 tender.
 Lacerda alleged that corrup-
 tion is still tolerated and that
 self-interested politicians con-
 tinue to dominate official poli-
 cies.                  He called the presidential
 advisers "intriguers" and "grave-
 diggers" of the revolution.   The
 criticism directed at the Presi-
 dent himself was relatively mild,
 limited to charges of political
 ineptness and indecisiveness.
 While the speech probably
 does not represent a full break
 with the administration,  it does
 widen the division between the
 governor and Castello Branco.
 Lacerda may be attempting to
 drive a wedge between Castello
 Branco and his supporters, par-
 ticularly those who are pushing
 for a more complete cleanup of
 politics,  in hopes of gaining
 their backing in the 1966 cam-
 paign.   He has had some hope of
 being the "candidate of the rev-
 olution" but now apparently be-
 lieves that the regime is work-
 ing against his candidacy.   The
 US Embassy suggests that he may
 even be thinking of preparing
 for a possible future coup at-
 tempt if his chances of election
 should appear slim.
 The speech may have grave
 implications for stability in
 Brazil.   Should Lacerda continue
 to pursue a line of acrimony and
 demagoguery, he would encourage
 interparty rivalries and fric-
 tion which have remained rela-
 tively temperate under the pres-
 ent  regime.   These tactics
 would also greatly reduce the
 government's prospects for gain-
 ing public acceptance of the
 all-important austerity program.

 PROSPECTS IN CHILE'S MARCH CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION
 Chile will hold national
 congressional elections on 7
 March. In contention are all
 seats in the 147-member Chamber
 of Deputies, and 20 of the 45
 desks in the Senate.   Whereas
 last September's presidential
 race ultimately amounted to a
 contest between two coalitions,
 the legislative contest will
 find the seven significant po-
 litical parties individually
 struggling for position.  Three
 lesser parties also hope to gain
 admittance to the Congress, and
 one could conceivably elect a
 senator.   In some districts cer-
 tain parties are cooperating be-
 hind one or another candidate.
 The outlook is for a con-
 tinuation of the momentum with
 which Eduardo Frei's Christian
 Democrats (PDC) won him the
 presidency, albeit with a de-
 cided decline in vote percentage
 as their nominal Conservative
 and Liberal allies of September
 run for themselves.   Further-
 more, the Communists (PCCh) can
 be expected to hold their own
 or even to gain in seats, and
 to register a strong percentage
 increase in their electoral sup-
 port.   Other parties are unlikely
 to improve upon their numerical
 strength in the present Congress.
 In popular vote, the Popu-
 lar Revolutionary Action Front
 (FRAP)--made up of Socialists,
 Communists, and National Demo-
 crats--may draw about 35 percent,
 with the PCCh attracting about
 half of that.  The PDC should
 run slightly stronger than FRAP
 as it moves toward becoming a
 national majority party, while
 the three traditional parties--
 Radicals, Liberals, Conserva-
 tivESs--will divide the remainder
 of the ballots.
 Indications are that the
 PDC may pick up 5 senators, the
 Communists 2, and National Demo-
 crats I at the expense of the
 Liberals (-3), Socialists (-2)
 and Radicals (-2), and an In-
 dependent.   In the Chamber,
 the PDC probably will more than
 double its present 28 deputies,
 at the expense of the Radicals
 (_1.0), Liberals (-10), Conserva-
 tives (-5), Socialists (-4),
 and National Democrats (-3).
 The Communists may gain a seat
 for a total of 17 in the new
 Conngress.
 The ruling Christian Demo-
 crats will almost certainly
 thus be left well short of a
 majority, although with more
 than the third needed in the
 Chamber to sustain a presiden-
 tial veto.  They therefore
 will find it necessary to at-
 tract the support of other leg-
 islators either through coopera-
 tion with another party, which
 is improbable, or by achieving
 agreements with individual con-
 gressmen.
