 Soviet Foreign Policy Since Sinai II--An Overview
 (NOTE:   The following article is the text of a paper
 presented on 20 October at a conference on the Middle
 East sponsored by the Office of Regional and Political
 Analysis.   Comments on the personal judgments expressed
 are solicited.)
 Over the next half hour,  I will set the stage for
 our discussions of the next two days by placing Soviet
 interests in the Middle East into the total evolving
 world context as I think the Soviets see it.   And to this
 end,   I suggest that we try to reconstruct an overview of
 the most notable trends of the last two years--since
 Sinai II--as a well-positioned, well-informed, and rela-
 tively coolheaded Soviet specialist might see them.
 Let us suppose that Kapitsa of the Foreign Ministry,
 or Zagladin of the International Department of the Cen-
 tral Committee, or best of all Aleksandrov-Agentov of
 Brezhnev's personal staff was asked to compose for the
 Politburo a memorandum listing and weighing--as objective-
 ly as possible--the favorable and unfavorable aspects of
 what has happened to Soviet interests in the world since
 the fall of 1975.   If such a person could afford to be
 brutally frank  (which is of course certainly open to ques-
 tion), what would he say?
 Looking first at the positive side of the ledger,
 I suggest he might find that there have been five main
 developments broadly favorable to Soviet interests in the
 last two years.
 First--and this is basic--would be the deep Soviet
 satisfaction over their continued progress in the strategic
 arms matchup with the United States.   This has involved
 the deployment of new ballistic missile-firing submarines
 and the scheduled replacement of third generation ICBMs
 by fourth generation ones with greater site hardness,
 greater accuracy,  and a MIRV payload.  The net effect has

 been to maintain the Soviet lead over the United States
 in certain quantitative measures of strategic power
 while reducing the US lead on the qualitative side.   The
 ultimate scope of the political rewards anticipated by
 the USSR from this buildup is still ambiguous.   But the
 Soviets almost certainly expect, at a minimum, to reduce
 US leverage and improve their own in any future confron-
 tations such as the one which occurred late in the Octo-
 ber 1973 war.
 Secondly,  a Soviet official reviewing key events
 since 1975 would recall that the war in Indochina had
 ended only five months before Sinai II, and did so in a
 manner that was surprisingly abrupt and imposed a humilia-
 tion upon the United States which the Soviets found most
 gratifying.   As a result,  the US was forced to take a
 step back in Asia.   The Soviet Union, on the other hand,
 not only could claim credit for the help it had given
 the winning side, but has since been able to consolidate
 its position as the outside power with the greatest de-
 gree of influence in Vietnam and Laos.   This does not
 mean, of course,  that the USSR can expect to dominate the
 Vietnamese--no one can do that--but rather that the end
 of the war has allowed both the Vietnamese and Chinese
 to remove some of the veils from their profound mutual
 antagonism.   With the Americans gone,  this has left the
 Soviet Union with a considerable local advantage, since
 it is the only large power which has at least fair ideolog-
 ical relations with Hanoi, which is sufficiently distant
 to be nonthreatening,  and which also has the capability
 and inclination to render economic aid.
 Beyond this,  the Soviets have had reason to hope
 that the highly undignified American departure from Saigon
 would be seen all over the world as symbolic and sympto-
 matic of a generally receding tide of US presence and
 influence, while the Soviet Union would be seen all the
 more as the advancing tide.
 A Soviet memorandum-writer might at this juncture
 cite a third recent trend which could be portrayed as
 further evidence for this notion of the advancing and
 the receding tide.   After 15 years of frustration and
 fluctuating fortunes,  the Soviet Union since 1975 has
 at last made a breakthrough in Africa sufficient to

 establish the USSR permanently as a major influence there.
 The Soviet presence had been gradually improving in a
 smaller way for some time previously, of course--notably
 in dealings with the Marxist regime in Somalia, which
 had granted the USSR use of an Indian Ocean base at
 Berbera.   But the major advances have come rather dramat-
 ically as a consequence of the liquidation of the Por-
 tuguese colonial empire in East and West Africa--and par-
 ticularly, of course, as a result of the events in Angola.
 The circumstances surrounding the triumph of the Soviet-
 supported faction in Angola in late 1975 and early 1976
 have indeed appeared to make the event a historical land-
 mark.   Never before had the Soviet Union sought to as-
 sert so long a reach--to bring significant military power
 to bear for a specific political end over such long dis-
 tances, so far from areas of vital Soviet interest.
 While the forces thus deployed were,  to be sure, largely
 proxies--Cubans--the weapons and much of the transport
 used were Soviet.   Indeed,  the Angolan intervention sym-
 bolized, as much as anything,  the coming of age of the
 Soviet air transport capability previously used abroad
 mainly in periodically resupplying freshly defeated Arab
 armies over relatively short distances.   Thus this episode
 demonstrated the most striking Soviet departure to date
 from Stalin's conservative reluctance to become committed
 to military adventures beyond the range of contiguous
 land-based artillery.   At the same time, coming as they
 did within a year after the American debacle in Vietnam,
 the Angolan events were widely interpreted as another
 defeat for US policy by the Soviet Union, and one which
 was somehow a continuation and confirmation of a trend
 seen as implicit in the fall of Vietnam.   A Soviet writer
 could well profess to see both a historical link and
 a gratifying contrast--on the one hand, the spectacular
 use of American helicopters to extricate defeated person-
 nel from Saigon out of the battle, and on the other hand
 the equally spectacular use of Soviet air transport to
 bring equipment and men to Luanda into the battle.
 By picking his facts carefully and selectively, a
 Soviet official could also cite many grounds for optimism
 in the trends in Africa since the apparent final triumph
 of the Angolan MPLA.   These would include the Soviet
 friendship treaties signed with Angola and Mozambique,
 the aircraft reconnaissance base rights which the USSR

 may anticipate in Angola, the development of a legitimized
 Soviet role, however circumscribed,  in support of the
 black nationalist campaign against Rhodesia,  the rise of
 the Namibia issue,  the growing presence of small groups
 of Cuban military experts in various parts of Africa, and
 the long-term implications of the rise to power of a
 radical military group in Ethiopia--the largest East
 African state, which is ideologically predisposed to favor
 the USSR and to be hostile to the US.
 Leaving Africa for the time being, a Soviet official
 seeking to isolate phenomena fovorable to Soviet interests
 could of course refer to the various ongoing difficulties
 of Western Europe and the Western alliance.   This would
 include, in the first place,  the continued political
 volatility and precariousness of NATO's whole southern
 flank along the Mediterranean--because of the conflicting
 interests of Greece and Turkey, because of the growing
 role of the Communist Party of Italy and the implications
 this has had for the future security of NATO planning,
 and because of the continued fragility of the two new
 regimes on the Iberian Peninsula.   Beyond this, a Soviet
 writer could refer to the ongoing economic problems of
 much of Western Europe,  involving unemployment,  inflation,
 continued vulnerability to high energy costs, and the
 prospect of continued reduction of growth rates.   All this
 has sponsored a general malaise conducive to the growth
 of leftist sentiment and ultimately--so the Soviet Union
 might hope--suggesting the likelihood of increased West
 European economic and political friction with the United
 States and reduced responsiveness to American influence.
 While the Soviet Union has had only marginal ability to
 affect any of these trends,  a Soviet writer might cite
 them as phenomena favorable to Soviet net interests and
 worthy of applause.   I shall return in a few minutes to
 the question of whether this is really the case and
 whether most Soviets now think so.
 Finally, of course,  a Soviet memorandum-writer cast-
 ing about for favorable events of the last couple of
 years would probably feel obliged to cite the 1975 con-
 vening of the European Security Conference and the signing
 of the Helsinki Declaration.   This event did, after all,
 mean the successful culmination of years of Soviet cam-
 paigning for a conference which would put a final, author-
 itative seal upon the postwar borders of Europe and

 legitimize Soviet World War II territorial gains.   In
 this sense, the Helsinki conference is probably still
 regarded as a solid achievement of Soviet policy.
 Nevertheless,  if the hypothetical memorandum stopped
 there, it would be likely to cause some raised eyebrows
 and head-scratching among its Politburo readers.   Despite
 the important elements of truth in each of the points
 made so far,  it is symptomatic of the gravity of Soviet
 problems that none of the Soviet leaders is likely to
 consider the foregoing optimistic discussion an adequate
 picture of the.main trends facing the Soviet Union.   We
 can therefore imagine the memorandum-writer taking a
 deep breath and beginning again with the word "odnako"--
 "however."   In all Soviet reports, the heart of the matter
 generally follows the "odnako."
 In the first place, he would be obliged to note
 flatly that the Soviet Union's relative position in the
 overarching Sino-Soviet-US world triangle unfortunately
 continues to be unfavorable, and has in fact deteriorated
 slightly further in the last couple of years.   On the
 Chinese side of the equation,  it has turned out that the
 death of Mao Tse-tung a year ago has not had the moderat-
 ing affect upon Peking's attitude toward the USSR for
 which the Soviets had so long been hoping.   On the con-
 trary,  the supposedly moderate, pragmatic figures now
 in control in Peking continue to display toward the Soviet
 Union an implacable hostility which is far more intense
 than that toward the United States and which now appears
 to be firmly rooted in a nonideological view of Chinese
 national interest.   The Chinese therefore continue to
 wage vehement geopolitical warfare against the USSR on
 every front around the world and,  in particular, do their
 utmost to persuade the major capitalist countries to
 abandon all dealings with the Soviet Union.   Although
 Chinese capabilities in this regard,  fortunately for Mos-
 cow, are still limited,  the Soviet Union continues to be
 concerned over the potential effect of Chinese exhorta-
 tions about the Soviet danger, particularly upon conserva-
 tive forces in the West.   The Soviet Union has also be-
 come increasingly exercised this year over what is seen
 as a growing possibility that the United States and
 other Western states may soon expand the sale of military
 technology to the Chinese.   It is in this particular key

 respect that the already bad situation in the triangle
 is growing worse for the USSR rather than better--and
 this despite the fact that Sino-US relations are them-
 selves stalemated over Taiwan.
 Because of the Soviet desire to minimize these prob-
 lems--and even more,  to minimize the potential leverage
 upon Moscow which Washington may hope to obtain from this
 situation--the USSR would very much like to improve its
 relations with Peking.   But the Soviets are willing to
 do this only if it can be done without sacrificing what
 are regarded as essential national interests.   Unfortu-
 nately for the USSR, the Chinese are obviously determined
 for their own reasons to keep the relationship frozen.
 To this end they rigidly adhere to certain Maoist nego-
 tiating demands in the Sino-Soviet border dispute which,
 as they well realize, no Soviet Government can or will
 ever consider.   The upshot is that while Soviet experts
 continue to hope for some eventual modification of the
 Chinese position,  they cannot encourage the Soviet leader-
 ship to expect this in the next few years.   They cannot
 encourage any aged Politburo member in questionable
 health--such as Brezhnev--to believe he will live long
 enough to shake hands with a Chinese leader, and they
 cannot nominate a time when it will become safe to stop
 pouring concrete for pillboxes around Khabarovsk.
 Secondly,  it is against this background that we note
 that the Soviet relationship with the other member of the
 triangle--the United States--has been continuously eroding
 from the end of 1974 until a few weeks ago.   It is now
 evident that a turning point in the detente relationship
 occurred late in 1974, when the Vladivostok understandings
 were reached and the Stevenson Amendment was passed to the
 Export-Import Bank bill.   Consolidation of the Vladivostok
 understanding in a new draft treaty was to prove impossi-
 ble for nearly three years, partly because of growing con-
 cern in the United States over Soviet strategic intentions,
 and partly for a number of other reasons,  including dis-
 content in the US over the way in which detente was being
 defined as well as anger over Soviet behavior in Angola.
 At the same time,  the declining state of the relationship
 has also been reflected in the Soviet inability to secure
 revision of the obnoxious US trade legislation of Decem-
 ber 1974 whose passage precipitated Soviet rejection of
 the Trade Agreement the following month.

 Meanwhile, the internal processes of the United
 States have evolved in a fashion which has given the
 Soviet Union new cause for concern.   Soviet satisfaction
 with the rate of Soviet strategic deployment has been
 tempered by a healthy respect for US technological capa-
 bility, and by gradually increasing anxiety over the
 advent of new US weapon systems not yet matched in the
 Soviet Union.   Similarly, Soviet self-satisfaction be-
 cause of the US discomfiture over Vietnam has this year
 been replaced by anxiety over the emergence of a new US
 leadership which has taken the political offensive on
 several fronts against the USSR.
 Thirdly,  the advance of Soviet fortunes in Africa
 has proved a much more complex and difficult task in
 1977 than it had appeared in 1975 or 1976.   In Angola,
 for example,  the MPLA has found itself unable to assert
 its authority over a considerable portion of the national
 territory in the face of a prolonged insurgency, at the
 same time that Neto's personal attitude toward the Soviet
 Union has cooled considerably.   Meanwhile, the Soviet
 effort to court the radical Mengistu government of
 Ethiopia has involved the USSR in a dilemma because of
 the Somali attempt to conquer Ethiopia's Ogaden region.
 The Soviet decision to supply arms to Ethiopia and to
 put pressure on the USSR's older client, Somalia,  to
 desist has thus far not rescued the Ethiopians--much to
 Mengistu's chagrin.   On the other hand,  the Soviet tilt
 toward Ethiopia has placed in jeopardy the Soviet posi-
 tion in Somalia and the continued Soviet use of their
 base at Berbera.   There is some fragmentary and inconclu-
 sive evidence to raise the possibility that this painful
 dilemma could eventually lead the USSR to rediscover the
 virtue of seeking limited local cooperation with the
 United States with a view to finding a way to end the
 conflict.
 Fourthly,  in Europe,  the Soviets have once again
 discovered the two-edged, equivocal nature of several
 trends that might at first glance have seemed favorable
 to Soviet interests.
 One such problem has, as we know, accompanied the
 rise in Communist influence in parts of Western Europe.
 While hoping for a decrease in US influence and a loosen-
 ing of NATO ties as the end-product of this trend, many

 Soviet officials seem by no means sure that this goal
 will be worth the cost they are already paying in dimin-
 ished Soviet influence over the key Communist parties.
 In combating the rise of Eurocommunism,  the Soviets are
 struggling against the apparently very strong temptation
 for Eurocommunist leaders to strengthen their position
 in their own societies by distancing themselves from
 the Soviet Union and attacking Soviet practices.   More-
 over, the Soviets view the heresies and challenges to
 CPSU legitimacy voiced by West European Communists as
 particularly dangerous because of their potential sub-
 versive effect upon Eastern Europe.   There is consider-
 able evidence to suggest that in the last few years the
 weighing of the plusses and minuses of these trends has
 evoked as much uncertainty and controversy in Moscow as
 in the West.
 An associated, particularly unpleasant dilemma for
 the Soviets has arisen in Europe in 1976 and 1977 in
 connection with the unforeseen aftermath of the European
 Security Conference.   Even before the new US administra-
 tion publicly espoused the human rights issue,  the effect
 of the adoption of Basket III at Helsinki was to stimulate
 challenges to Communist authority and practice in East
 Europe and the Soviet Union.   While these could be easily
 contained in the USSR,  they are viewed as much more ser-
 ious in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland, where
 the situation is uniquely fragile because of the endemic
 weakness of the Polish economy and the proven readiness
 of the Polish proletariat to rebel.   Beyond this security
 issue, the Soviet leaders have seen the human rights
 movement spawned by Helsinki as placing them on the politi-
 cal defensive throughout the world, and they believe that
 the issue has been deliberately used this year for that
 purpose by the new US administration.   At the same time
 the Soviets have also come to fear discussion of the human
 rights question as feeding the Eurocommunist impetus to-
 ward autonomy.
 Yet another set of dilemmas arises from the Soviet
 economic relationship with the West.    The Soviets have
 learned that inflation and other factors that distress
 the economies of Western Europe and thus cheer the hearts
 of ideologues in Moscow also raise the price of the for-
 eign technology the USSR wishes to purchase.   At the same

 time, any such difficulties in the large capitalist states
 render even more improbable the huge capital investments
 in the exploitation of Soviet raw materials which the
 USSR has been seeking from the capitalist world, with
 minimal success,  since detente began.   Meanwhile,  some
 Soviets may have begun to wonder whether the windfall
 benefits in hard currency earnings they have obtained in
 the West from the leap in the world price of oil will
 outweigh, over the long run,  the growing economic burdens
 that high oil prices are bringing to Eastern Europe.
 These are burdens which the Soviet Union in the last
 analysis will have to share rather than accept the politi-
 cal consequences.   This issue is likely to come to a head
 within the next few years if,  as anticipated, Soviet oil
 available for export both to succor Eastern Europe and to
 earn hard currency in the West begins to diminish rapidly
 and the Soviets are forced to choose.   Recently aired
 Western predictions of such a reduction of Soviet oil
 exports may well have multiplied Soviet anxieties about
 the future of their technology imports from the West,  if
 their hard currency earnings to finance such imports do
 plummet as forecast.
 This brings us,  finally,  to the Middle East, where
 the political losses the Soviets have suffered in recent
 years are also closely intertwined with Soviet economic
 weaknesses.   In the last two years the already poor So-
 viet position in the area has endured further major set-
 backs,  the two most significant being Sadat's abrogation
 of the Soviet-Egyptian friendship treaty and expulsion
 of the Soviet fleet from Alexandria, together with Asad's
 humiliating demonstration of Soviet impotence to prevent
 him from breaking the power of the PLO in Lebanon.   In the
 face of this steady erosion of Soviet influence, Soviet
 hopes to begin a comeback have remained centered on the
 possibility of reconvening a Geneva Conference at which
 the USSR would be seen in a coequal role with the United
 States.
 More fundamentally, the Soviet overall position in
 the Middle East continues to be squeezed between three
 converging pressures:   first, the enormous influence of
 the conservative oil-producing states working against
 Soviet interests;  secondly,  the enticement of the Arabs
 by the United States with hopes that the US could deliver
 significant Israeli concessions;  and thirdly,  the in-
 creasing orientation of the economies of even radical Arab

 states toward the capitalist industrial states because
 of the fundamental inferiority of most Soviet and East
 European civilian technology to that of the West.   The
 last factor has already increased the East European bur-
 den on the USSR by defeating East European attempts to
 secure significant quantities of oil from the Middle East
 without the expenditure of hard currency.   It is true
 that Soviet weapons are competitive in quality with those
 of the West,  that the USSR can earn hard currency or the
 oil equivalent through weapon sales to states possessing
 oil, and that the Soviet Union has earned sizable amounts
 in this way through sales to Libya and Iraq.   It therefore
 seems likely, as a recent OER paper notes, that if the
 anticipated Soviet hard currency difficulties materialize
 in the next few years,  the economic motive for seeking
 such arms sales will increasingly supplant the political
 motive in Soviet eyes.   Nevertheless,  it does not seem
 probable that customers will be found to make such pur-
 chases on a scale commensurate with Soviet problems.
 Finally, what can we conclude from this survey of
 recent Soviet adventures and misadventures?
 First, that the Soviets continue to take for granted
 that their relationship with the US must necessarily be
 a mixture of cooperative and competitive elements.   But
 more than this, they have made it apparent that in many,
 although not all places, they regard their interests as
 inherently incompatible with those of the US.   Their
 policy in Angola and in much of the rest of Africa has
 appeared to be grounded on this assumption.   At the
 same time, they also appear to take for granted that the
 US has often acted under the same assumption, particularly
 in view of the successful US efforts to constrict Soviet
 influence in the Middle East since 1973.   As a consequence,
 it is clear that the Soviets have never taken seriously nor
 expected the US to take seriously the 1972 joint Soviet-US
 pledge to avoid transgressing on each other's interests.
 Secondly,  it also seems likely that the Soviet view
 of how far to allow cooperation to dilute their competi-
 tive instincts has varied over time.   One key factor has
 been their changing perception of what they have to lose--
 that is, what they are obtaining from their bilateral re-
 lationship with the United States at each point in time.
 It is also obvious that other matters being equal,  the

 Soviets have been less inclined toward cooperation at
 moments and places where they regard themselves as having
 the upper hand over the United States  (as in the middle
 East prior to 1967 and Angola in early 1976)  and rela-
 tively more inclined to do so when and where they see
 themselves in difficulties  (as in the Middle East in
 recent years and perhaps the Horn of Africa today).
 Thirdly, in this competition the Soviets have made
 certain undeniably solid gains in recent years.   This is
 particularly so in the strategic relationship, as well
 as in Africa, where despite the recent problems to which
 I have alluded the Soviets have achieved a political
 base from which they are unlikely to be totally dislodged,
 and which they will use for many years in an ongoing
 struggle against US influence.
 Fourth and lastly,  despite these gains, it is my
 judgment that the overall foreign political balance
 sheet for the Soviet Union has been negative over the
 last couple of years and will probably become more so.
 Of all the issues I have mentioned, two towering prob-
 lems--that of China and that of Soviet economic vulner-
 abilities--appear to me to overshadow all else, and both
 are likely to prove intractable.

 Foreign Policy Implications of Soviet Economic Problems:
 Some Further Speculations*
 The continuing decline in economic growth is sharp-
 ening the dilemmas of Soviet foreign policy.  If,  in addi-
 tion, the Soviets are forced to reduce, and perhaps
 eliminate, oil exports to the West--exports which now
 account for over half of their hard currency export
 earnings--a major Soviet reexamination of economic rela-
 tions with the West will become necessary.   Moreover,
 Eastern Europe's economic ties to the West and perhaps
 Soviet economic relations with Eastern Europe will also
 have to be reexamined.   The expansion of the entire bloc's
 economic relationship with the West has been an integral
 part of the Soviet concept of detente, and Eastern Europe's
 need for an increased share of the USSR's exportable oil
 surplus has restrained and now threatens Soviet oil ex-
 ports to the West.
 Contradictions Emerge
 The concept of detente, as ratified at the 24th
 Party "Peace"  Congress in 1971, appears to have been
 premised on a growing recognition of the USSR as a super-
 power and on a continuing favorable shift in the "correla-
 tion of forces."   The USSR was becoming the military,  if
 not the economic, equal of the US and was capable of
 simultaneously taking steps to address the unsettled
 postwar issues in central Europe,  integrate Eastern
 Europe into an inviolable "socialist commonwealth," and
 face comparison, engagement, and negotiations with the
 West on a broad range of issues.   Until recently, events
 tended to bear out these Soviet assumptions.   The growing
 recognition of Soviet military parity with the US and the
 impact of the international energy crisis on the West ap-
 peared to affirm that in the crucial arenas of military
 and economic competition the balance was continuing to
 shift toward the USSR.

 nomic problems, particularly for domestic issues,  see

 The assumptions about future East-West economic and
 military trends, however, have become questionable.   As
 relations with the US have deteriorated, the threat has in-
 creased of a new, qualitatively oriented spurt in the
 arms race, during which the Soviets could have difficulty
 maintaining the pace.   At the same time, the West has
 partially recovered from the energy crisis, and future
 bloc gains from expanding East-West economic relations
 have been jeopardized by the serious problems of debt,
 credit, exports, and cooperation.   If Soviet economic
 performance deteriorates further and particularly if
 economic relations with the West decline abruptly be-
 cause of a lack of exportable oil, improvements in the
 East-West "correlation of forces" will become increas-
 ingly difficult to sustain.
 If the Soviets perceive the political, social, and
 ideological consequences of bloc economic problems as
 serious threats, retrenchment in relations with the
 West, rather than significant change at home, appears
 to be the more likely course for the present leadership,
 at least initially.   There are already signs that imports
 from the West are being cut back, albeit reluctantly,  and
 that East European economic needs, including oil, will
 receive priority, even though the USSR is incapable of
 meeting them fully.   Although such policies will have a
 long-range cumulative effect on Soviet domestic resource
 allocations, this emerging situation threatens to have
 a more immediate impact on a fundamental premise of
 detente--the assumption that internal bloc economic ties
 with the West would be complements,  rather than alterna-
 tives.   (CEMA integration was, on the one hand, to be
 fostered by imports of advanced Western technology and
 equipment and, on the other hand, to generate improved
 products capable of export to the West.)   Declining
 Soviet economic prospects thus undercut the economic
 pillar of detente and pose growing difficulties for
 Soviet foreign policy.
 The Dialectic at Work
 As always, however, the primary question for Soviet
 leaders is not what provides the basis for improved ties
 with the West, but what provides the basis for improved
 competition with the West.   Military detente, which has
 largely superseded economic detente as the driving force

 behind the Soviet "peace offensive" in the past few years,
 may be valued in part for fostering economic and polit-
 ical benefits.   But the primary virtue of continuing
 to strive to reduce tensions with the West must lie in
 the impact on the overall East-West balance--on the
 trend in the "correlation of forces"--of which such
 benefits are but a part and in which the military ele-
 ment looms large.   The dilemma for the Soviets lies in
 mitigating the burden of the arms race, yet continuing
 to find grounds for claiming--and projecting--further
 gains vis-a-vis the West in the overall balance.
 As long-term economic prospects dim, these two
 goals will become increasingly difficult to reconcile.
 Since the beginning of the detente era, the continuing
 Soviet military buildup has posed a latent danger--the
 prospect that the West might react by embarking upon major
 new military programs that would place greater strains on
 the faltering Soviet economy as it is called upon to re-
 spond with greater military production.   Now, while the
 economic and technological benefits available from East-
 West ties may be declining, the potential gains from any
 slowing of the arms race are increasing as the reduced
 increment to Soviet economic growth becomes more diffi-
 cult to allocate-among competing claimants.
 Nevertheless,  there are reasons why the Soviets may
 believe the risks inherent in heightened military compe-
 tition are well worth taking.   First, such competition
 may be viewed as compensation for the increased frustra-
 tion experienced in trying to overtake the West economi-
 cally,                       frustration that may bring with it an erosion of
 Soviet political and ideological authority at home and
 abroad.    Secondly, Soviet military power represents a
 major commitment of resources,  and there may be increased
 temptation to try to draw foreign policy dividends from
 these past investments.   As the economy slows, the rela-
 tive attractiveness for Soviet leaders of arms sales and
 military support for client regimes or insurgent forces
 in the Third World is likely to grow as export earnings
 and the resources available for economic aid become more
 difficult to generate.    Moreover,  should economic dis-
 location and Social unrest within the bloc become serious
 threats because of oil shortages, such policies could
 increasingly be directed toward the securing of foreign
 oil supplies.

 A Hopeful Synthesis?
 Yet resorting to a more assertive use of military
 power for immediate economic or political objectives
 would jeopardize the Soviets'  remaining economic ties
 with the West and the Third World, thereby forcing an
 even more rapid retreat towards autarky.   It would also
 probably trigger a costly boost in the arms race.   Clearly
 a more far-sighted policy for Soviet leaders, in the
 face of the prospect of the USSR or the bloc becoming
 a net oil importer, would be to seek stability in the
 Middle East and a concerted East-West effort to assure
 fulfillment of the oil requirements of both sides.   The
 feasibility of such a policy may be enhanced by the ex-
 pectation that the West will also become increasingly
 dependent upon Arab oil by the 1980s and by a declining
 Soviet interest in higher oil prices as exports to the
 West fall.
 But the cooperative route would also pose difficult
 problems for Soviet leaders.   Having only recently been
 widely recognized as a military equal of the US, and
 still clearly feeling economically and technologically
 inferior in any great power or East-West comparison, the
 Soviets naturally see themselves as disadvantaged in the
 economic arena.   Although Brezhnev clearly senses--as
 Khrushchev did--that expanded international economic ties
 and a gradual institutional involvement offer the basic
 long-term answer,  a myriad of inhibitions arise in the
 short term.   As economic  performance slows, and particu-
 larly if the prospect of serious oil shortage looms, the
 feeling of economic inferiority will become more diffi-
 cult to overcome.
 If compounded by a more limited prospect for eco-
 nomic benefits from East-West ties because of increasing
 Western resistance to the expansion of credit and co-
 operation, the autarkic pressures already enhanced in
 the bloc by the energy crisis could then spread more
 rapidly beyond the fuel and raw material sphere to that
 of more technology-intensive industries.   This would
 further reduce the Soviet economic incentive for detente
 and hence whatever incentive now exists for responding
 favorably to Western political pressures.   This could,
 in turn,  facilitate a return to greater orthodoxy at home
 and perhaps to a more belligerent posture abroad.

 Whether the Soviets see greater competition or
 greater cooperation with the West as the primary answer
 to their mounting economic problems will depend not only
 on the nature and  severity  of these problems--and of
 course on leadership inclinations--but also on how the
 West is believed likely to respond.   Western reactions
 to Soviet military involvement in Africa over the past
 couple of years may have provided them with some indica-
 tion of how a competitive/aggressive policy would fare.
 On the other hand, two recent trends serve to test the
 prospects for a more cooperative approach; Soviet efforts
 to diversify their oil supplies by reaching beyond the
 radical clients favored in the past to include Iran, and
 Brezhnev's repeated calls for an East-West energy con-
 ference.   For this second, cooperative approach to win
 final Soviet acceptance, however,  the Soviet leaders
 would have to be willing to accept the likelihood of a
 relatively long stand-down in their drive to overtake
 the West until economic cooperation, perhaps accompanied
 by more effective arms control, has laid the groundwork
 for the future triumphs of "socialism." F77      I

 USSR:   Changes in Education Policy Reflect Soviet Concern
 for Labor Quality
 The specter of a sharp slowdown in labor force growth
 in the 1980s has prompted Soviet leaders to revamp the
 vocational-technical education system in an effort to
 increase the quality of training for new entrants.   Train-
 ing workers on the job has proved to be unsatisfactory,
 and an effort is being made to formalize and extend voca-
 tional training and,  at the same time, provide a greater
 proportion of new entrants into the labor force with a
 complete secondary education.
 A resolution was adopted by the Central Committee
 and the Council of Ministers in September calling for
 further improvement and expansion of vocational and tech-
 nical school training, particularly at the secondary
 level.   The resolution stipulates that vocational-tech-
 nical schools will be the major vehicle for training future
 workers.   Compared with a current course of one to two
 years, the legislation provides for a three-year course
 of study for eighth-grade graduates in which students would
 be trained for an occupation and receive a secondary
 education as well.   Also, one- to two-year vocational
 training courses for graduates of secondary schools  (tenth
 grade) who will enter the labor force are to be established.
 Apparently, the regime is gambling that additional tech-
 nical training will raise the productivity of new workers
 sufficiently to offset the decline in production the de-
 lay in their entering the labor force might cause.
 During the current five-year-plan period, the Soviets
 are planning to train 11 million young workers in voca-
 tional-technical schools.   In 1980, more than 80 percent
 of the future workers  (compared to 28 percent in 1976)
 will be trained at secondary vocational-technical schools,
 according to A. Bulgakov, Chairman of the State Committee
 for Vocational and Technical Education.   The new legisla-
 tion also calls for the construction of schools,  revision
 of curricula, training of more qualified teachers, and
 overhauling the certification procedures.

 Vocational-technical schools have long been the
 poor relative of the Soviet school system.   These
 schools were attached to particular enterprises and min-
 istries to train workers in occupations specifically for
 their parent enterprise.   The Soviet press has reported
 regularly on the poor utilization of funds for vocational-
 technical school construction, outdated training equip-
 ment, inadequate educational and technical background of
 the teachers, lack of interest on the part of the sponsor-
 ing organizations,  and low prestige in the eyes of the
 students.   A further flaw in the vocational network has
 been the lack of participation by females.   In 1966 women
 composed 50 percent of workers and employees in the econ-
 omy and 18 percent of students in vocational schools.
 By 1977 the proportions had increased to 51 percent of
 workers and employees and 30 percent of enrollment.
 Currently,  females are trained for only 580 of 1,200 pro-
 fessions in the vocational-technical system and 280 of
 530 at the secondary-vocational level.
