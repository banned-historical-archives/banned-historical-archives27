The New York Times Magazine/September 12, 1976 
Not all its covert actions have succeeded, but the 
agency did manage to outfox Congressional investigators. 
217 'YawIlen. E3EME2(gi'a 
There have been enough revelations about the Central Intelligence 
Agency over the past two years to keep diplomats, prosecutors, reporters and 
philosophers busy for entire careers. Three separate investigations not only 
stretched the imagination with show-biz material about cobra venom and 
deadly skindiving suits but twisted the lens on the American self-image in 
foreign affairs. The investigations rewrote history�the history, for example, 
. of the relationship between the United States and the Castro Government 
in Cuba. They showed that the C.I.A., in some 900 foreign interventions 
over the past two decades, has run secret wars around the globe and has 
clandestinely dominated foreign governments so thoroughly as to make 
them virtual client states. In contrast to Watergate, the C.I.A. investiga-
tions proved that abuses of power have not been limited to one particular 
Administration or one political party. They also established facts that few 
people were prepared to believe�such as that distinguished gentlemen 
from the C.I.A. hatched assassination plots with Mafia gangsters. 
� With all these surprises percolating, the most interesting surprise has 
been largely ignored. And that is how the C.I.A. investigations ceased. The 
topic faded away so quickly as to make the whole episode look like a fad. 
Unlike the F.B.I. issue, which has moved to the prosecutors' offices and 
stayed on the front page, the vaunted trial of the C.I.A. has already become 
a memory. And the agency itself has survived the scandals .with its covert 
operations intact, if not strengthened. 
The collapse of the C.I.A. investigations has been due largely to in-
eptitude, poor judgment and lack of will on the part of the Congressional 
committees. But the agency also played a role. Its strategy was flawless. 
"Those guys really knew what they were doing," says a staff member of 
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence chaired by Frank Church. "I 
think they defended themselves just like any other agency would, except 
they're better. They had a whole office set up to deal with us, and I some-
tunas had the feeling that they ran operations against us like they run them 
against foreign governments. It was like the C.I.A.' station for the Congress 
instead of for Greece or Vietnam." The story of how they came out ahead of 
their investigators says a great deal about both the Congress and the agency, 
and about the problem of reconciling the demands of the superspy with the 
democracy he is supposed to protect. 
In the spring -of 1975, the Church committee had been spinning its , 
wheels for several months without much success. Charged with the task of 
investigating more than a dozen intelligence 
agencies, any one of which was an enormous 
challenge, the Senators became ensnarled in 
debate over how to proceed. The agencies 
were stalling, hoping to deflect attention else-
where. Then the committee got a break. 
The Presidential commissdon set up 
Tayfor.BronclApproved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
under Vice President Rockefeller that January, to inquire into charges of 
illegal domestic spying by the C.I.A., announced that it had received 
evidence of. C.I.A. involvement in attempts to kill foreign leaders. The news 
created an instant sensation. Rockefeller said his commission, which was 
completing its work, had neither the time nor the mandate to pursue 
the matter, and he turned the evidence over to President Ford, who quickly 
passed it along to the Church committee. Suddenly, the Senators found 
themselves with a large batch of classified documents and with responsi-
bility for the hottest issue since Watergate. 
For five months last year, the Church committee focused its energy 
on assassinations. Other investigations lapsed. Staff members were pulled 
from other projects. While it is no mean feat in the Senate to obtain sus-
tained, personal effort from Senators on any single subject, the members of 
the Church committee went to C.I.A. briefings day after day to be intro-
duced to the agency's arcane methods. In November 1975, �the committee 
published an interim report on this one aspect, and Senators and staff alike 
were proud of it. As an exploration of the Machiavellian underside of 
American foreign policy, it was, in fact, a tour de force. Yet it failed to 
build public support for investigating or controlling the C.I.A. 
Press and TV coverage was intense but shortlived, focusing on certain 
salacious details: the gangster plots, the titillating reports of an affair 
between President Kennedy and the mistress of one of the gangsters, and 
a few exotic spy plans worthy of a television serial. In this last category, 
the report featured a C.I.A. plan to treat Prime Minister Fidel Castro's boots 
with a chemical that would make his beard fall out and thereby destroy his 
charisma. The rest of the material was extremely complicated, conclusions 
were tentative, and the assassination plans fell short of the dramatic expec-
tations that had grown up. 
The committee did not claim to have found a "smoking gun," in the 
form of a kill order ringing down from the Oval Office, through the C.I.A. 
chain of command and out to some mysterious trigger man in a foreign 
capital. Quite the contrary. Where the American efforts to kill were most 
direct and persistent�in the case of Castro�they were unsuccessful. And 
where the foreign leaders were actually killed�Lumumba in the Congo, Tru-
jillo in the Dominican Republic, Diem in South Vietnam, Schneider in Chile 
�there was no hard proof that C.I.A. operatives actually took part in the 
murders. In some cases, the agency seemed to withdraw at the last moment. 
In other cases, someone else got there first. Of the Diem assassination the 
-committee could only say that the C.I.A. had sanctioned and encouraged a 
. coup against his Government when there was a reasonable chance the plot-
ters would kill him. But no direct _orders to assassinate. Everything was a 
� little blurred. Even the moit�direct written 
communications, as in the Lurnumba case, 
were couched in opaque C.I.A. language:-
"Hunting good here when lights right." 
Smoking guns are considered thoroughly 
unprofessional in clandestine operations, 
where secrecy is paramount and it is a mark 
� of skill to channel existing forces subtly. The 
assassination report, on the other hand, was ' 
publicly judged by 
standards built for palpable 
and exotic murders. Because 
no foreign leaders were 
killed outright by American, 
initiative, planning and ex-
ecution, the C.I.A. benefited. 
from a general impression 
that it came out of the 
assassination inquiry with 
clean hands. This impression 
is false. 
Certainly many thousands 
of people have died as a result 
of secret C.I.A. paramilitary 
interventions in countries 
ranging from Laos to Cuba to 
the Congo. (The Church com-
mittee obtained some casualty 
figures but did not publish 
them at the agency's request.) 
And, in the case of selected 
killings detailed in the report, 
the line between involvement 
and actual murder is often 
shadowy. For example, the 
Church committee reported 
extensively on the maneuver-
ing that preceded the assassi-
nation of Rafael Trujillo in 
1961. It showed �low Ameri-
can policy turned against the 
Dominican strongman, how' 
the agency provided assur-
ances of support to those who 
plotted against him, how 
C.I.A. officials smuggled 
weapons into the country and 
exchanged cryptic messages 
� on the likelihood of a success-
ful assassination. In keeping 
with its courtroom definition 
� of assassination, however, the 
committee exonerated the 
agency of Trujillo's murder on 
the ground that the weapons 
it smuggled in were probably 
not the ones used in the kill-
ing. 
"By the time we finished 
the assassination report," re-
calls the leader of one of the 
committee's task forces, "we 
had lost three things�the 
public's attention, much of 
our own energy and will 
power, and our leadership. 
Quite candidly, we had lost 
Frank Church," The Senator, 
according to this investigator, 
had given up hope of achiev-
ing major reforms in the pre-
'Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 
terest was down. Assassina-
tions proved peripheral to the 
main business of C.I.A. covert 
action, and the investigation 
of that unknown realm had 
scarcely begun. With in-
vestigations of the other intel-
ligence agencies, including the 
F.B.I., still ahead of them, five 
crucial months had been lost 
�along with much of the 
committee's momentum. The 
Senate's February 1976 dead-
line for the completion of all 
work loomed large. And 
Church wanted to wrap up 
his investigative chores in. 
order to begin his own Presi-
dential campaign. 
The Church committee had 
gambled heavily on the assas-
sination report. And lost. 
ccording to Mitchell 
Rogovin, the C.I.A.'s 
special counsel dur-
ing the investiga-
tion, the crux of the inquiry 
from the agency's point of view 
was ,covert abtion�secret in-
terventions abroad by means 
of propaganda, bribes, manip-
ulation of foreign agents and, 
in some cases, paramilitary 
force � as distinct from gath-
ering and analyzing intelli-
gence. The promotion system 
for C.I.A. case officers has 
been built around operations, 
and C.I.A. leadership has been 
drawn from the operators�
Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, 
William Colby�instead of in-
telligence analysts. Veteran 
agency operatives often say 
that without covert action the 
C.I.A. would be nothing but 
a collection of sophisticated 
professors with mounds of in-
telligence, and the agency it-
self would be only a more spe-
cialized version of the State 
Department. 
The C.I.A. approached the 
Congressional investigations 
.2with one central objective: to. 
protect the means and prac-
tice of covert action. It was 
in line with this strategy that 
Colby and Rogovin gave 
ground on the marginal issue 
of assassination, cooperating 
with the Church committee, 
turning over more informa-
tion than the committee could 
digest, helping the committee 
use itself up. Then, when the 
assassination report was com-
pleted, Rogovin became tough, 
about information to be grant-
ed for the 'remainder of the 
investigation � especially in 
regard to covert action. The 
committee was floundering; 
Rogovin pressed his advan-
tage. "We agreed with the 
committee that they could 
have access to information for 
six case studies in covert ac-
tion," he says, "provided they 
would go public with only one 
of them. They swore all kinds 
CO2623720 
of secrecy oaths that they 
would not even let the names 
of the other five countries 
leak." The case study he chose 
was Chile�a selection favora-
ble to the agency, since a lot 
of material on the C.I.A.'s in-
tervention in Chile had al-
ready leaked to the press; 
"It was a bad deal," says 
F.A.O. Schwarz, the commit-
tee's chief counsel. Many of 
the principal staff members 
opposed the settlement. What 
little they had learned about 
covert action in the course of 
the assassination investiga-
tion had made them realize it 
was one of the hardest but 
also one of the most important 
issues to deal with. "That is 
why we went so heavily into 
Mongoose in the assassina-
tion report," Schwarz ex-
plains. 
Operation Mongoose was a 
covert action designed to 
weaken and destroy the Cas-
tro regime through an orches-
trated program of economic 
sabotage, commando raids 
and paramilitary harassment.. 
It was the heart of the agen-
cy's effort to overthrow Cas-
tro; simultaneous assassina-
tion attempts complemented 
Mongoose rather than vice 
versa, Although the campaign 
failed, it was kept so secret 
that the American public was 
left with a fundamentally dis-
torted view- of United States-
Cuba relations for more than 
a decade. 
Before the committee's re-
port, it was generally accepted 
that the Kennedy Administra-
tion ceased hostilities against 
Castro after the Bay of Pigs, 
until forced to act defensively 
by the unprovoked introduc-
tion of Russian missiles on 
Cuban soil. The Church corn-
' mittee revealed that not only 
were there repeated attempts 
on Castro's life before and 
after the missile crisis but 
covert Mongoose raids were 
being intensified throughout 
the period. The assassination 
report quotes the minutes of 
high-level meetings, less than 
two weeks before the missile 
crisis, at which Attorney 
General Robert Kennedy 
spurred the C.I.A. on to hit 
Castro harder. 
The assassination report, 
outside sources generally 
agree, was the high point of 
the committee's investigation. 
After that, the staff divided 
into two groups, one known 
informally as "the lawyers"�. 
a group of attorneys drawn 
together largely by Schwarz 
�and the other as "the 
professors," who were gener-
ally foreign - policy experts 
with academic roots or Capi-
tol Hill experience. Under 
task - force leader William 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Bader, the "professors" be-
came responsible for the C.I.A. 
investigation, while the "law-
yers" went off after, the 
F.B.I. Frictions developed be-
tween the two groups, the 
Bader group tending to criti-
cize the lawyers as too 
prosecutorial and "Watergate-
minded," and the Schwarz 
team hinting that the Bader 
group was too soft in its 
handling of the C.I.A.'s pros. 
In any event, discouraged by 
the covert-action compromise, 
the "professors" never recov-
ered the initiative. 
n the House, the Select 
Committee on Intelli-
gence chaired by Otis 
Pike�the counterpart 
of the Church committee�
pursued an arduous and in-
dependent course. Created 
only after a long internecine 
squabble over its leadership, 
its mandate weakened by con-
tinuing- feuds in the House, 
the committee struggled 
through the summer of 1975 
to breathe life into itself�
seeking, on one occasion, to 
justify US existence- by leak-
ing the sensational but un-
verified story that Nixon aide 
Alexander Butterfield had 
been a C.I.A. "plant" in thea 
White House. The story was 
refuted, leaving the committee 
with less credibility than ever. 
By fall, the traditional jealousy 
between the House and the 
Senate had flared up behind 
the scenes, and Mitchell Ro-
govin, negotiating with .both 
committees, was finding them 
competitive. "Church," says 
Rogovin, "held his 'toxin hear-
ings' because he was afraid 
Pike would do it if he didn't." 
By December, the House and 
,Senate committees were set on 
opposite courses. Pike wanted 
to impale the C.I.A. for its 
abuses. Church wanted to 
show that a Senate committee 
could handle national secrets 
responsibly. The Ford Admini-
stration played the commit-
tees against each other. When 
Pike demanded information 
and denounced "delaying tac-
tics," Administration spokes-
men would point to the ex. 
emplary behavior of the Church 
committee and appeal for a 
more cooperative spirit. When 
the Church committee cooper-. 
ated, the Administration tended 
to see it as a sign of weakness 
and feel freer to hold back 
on information. Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger and 
C.I.A. director William E. 
Colby simply boycotted all 
the covert-action hearings, 
and the committee accepted 
the rebuff instead of subpoe-
naing them. � 
"The object of the exercise," 
says a Church committee staff 
trionther, "was to prove that 
we were not Pike. We were 
not going to move the Con-
gress or the public by more 
expos�What was going to 
'carry us was the kind of edi-
torial we finally got in The 
Washington Post: 'An Intelli-
gent Approach to Intelli-
gence.' The committee evi-
denced an increasing aware-
ness of its public image, of 
its ability to keep secrets. 
avoid leaks and work in some 
semblance of public harmony 
� with the C.I.A. Many on the 
committee staff endorsed this 
approach as the path toward 
"establishing a relationship" 
that would serve the Congres-
sional committee that was to 
be set up to exercise over-
sight�supervision of the in-
telligence agencies. Some of 
these investigators have, in 
fact, moved on to jobs with 
the oversight committee, now 
in business. Their attitude was 
infectious: Even today, many 
former Church committee 
staff members are more reti-
cent in discussing C.I.A. mat-
ters than C.I.A. officials them-
selves. 
n Dec. 24, a band of 
unknown terrorists 
'iiassassinated Rich-
ard Welch, the C.I.A. 
chief of . station in. Greece. 
Welch had been identified as 
a C.I.A. official by a small 
.anti-C.I.A. magazine, and a 
furor immediately arose over 
whether the revelation had 
� anything to do with his death. 
The -Senators on the Church 
committee received a flood of 
letters denouncing its work on 
�the grounds that exposure of 
C.I.A. secrets is an invitation 
to the killing of C.I.A. offi-
cials. 
Sources on both sides of the 
C.I.A. investigation now agree 
that neither the magazine nor 
the Church committee is 
.likely to have 'caused Welch's 
death. He was a relatively 
well-known figure in Athens, 
certainly to the kind of organ-
ized political groups likely to 
have killed him. These proba-
bilities were overwhelmed, 
however, by the emotional 
power of the tragedy, and the 
C.I.A. encouraged the idea 
that C.1-4,. critics might have 
contributed indirectly to the 
murder, Rogovin would only 
tell the Church committee 
that its own investigations' 
were not "directly" responsi-
ble. Colby lashed out in public' 
at those who revealed C.I.A. 
secrets as being more sinister 
than the secrets themselves. 
Ford made public statements 
to the effect that inquiries 
into C.I.A. methods were 
unpatriotic. 
No single event did more to 
turn public opinion against 
the investigations than the 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Welch affair. As 1975 ended, 
the press was shying away 
from the C.I.A. issue, and hos.. 
tility toward the inquiry was 
building up.in Congress itself. 
As to the C.I.A.'s private 
thoughts on whether naming 
� senior officials makes them 
more vulnerable to "the other 
. side," a move that escaped 
public attention may provide 
some insight: Welch was re-
placed in Athens by a man 
who had been identified as a 
C.I.A. official ,by Greek news-
papers and an American 
,magazine. 
On Jan. 29, 1976, Represent-
ative John Young, Democrat 
of Texas, offered a motion on 
the House floor to suppress 
the final report of the Pike 
committee. The ensuing de-
bate was not distinguished. 
Some speakers argued that 
the report�which they admit-
ted they had not read --
would endanger national . se-
. . 
curtty and align the House 
with the murderers of Richard 
Welch. Others, like Wayne 
.Hays, argued for suppression 
on the grounds that the report 
would be boring: "I suspect 
. that when this report 
comes opt it is going to be 
the biggest nonevent since 
Brigitte Barclot, after 40 years 
and four husbands and numer-
ous lovers, held a press con-
ference to arrnounce that she 
was no longer a virgin." 
Views like these prevailed, 
and the House,, by a vote of 
246 to 124, ordered its own 
report to be locked away in 
the clerk's safe. 
The document did not re-
main suppressed very long. It 
was leaked to CBS corres-
pondent Daniel Schorr, who in 
turn leaked it to The Vilage 
Voice through a series of inter-
mediaries. When The Voice 
published the report in two 
special supplements under ban-
ner headlines, it became the 
most spectacular leak of the 
C.I.A. investigations. 
Pike developed two themat-
ic criticisms of the C.I.A. 
First, he amassed evidence of 
� repeated intelligence failures, 
showing how the agency -had 
failed to anticipate such major 
world events as the 1968 Tet 
offensive in Vietnam, the Rus-
sian invasion of Czechoslova-
kia the same year, and the 
1973 Yom Kippur war in the 
Middle East. Citing various 
bureaucratic entanglements 
and preoccupations as the 
cause of poor performance, 
Pike took the agency to task 
for bungling the one function 
� gathering intolligence � 
against which there is no nu 
clihle dissent. Pike's second 
line of cnticisni was more 
substantive: ffe attackcd cov-
ert ac:tion hy. revealing a few 
of the more startling case 
studies. His most poignant ex-
ample involved the Kurdish 
minority in Iraq. 
Like many of the world's 
mountain peoples�the Tibe-
tans, the Meo in Laos, the 
.Montagnards of Vietnam, the 
Indians of South America�
the Kurds have always 
seemed destined for a hard 
time. They have been strug-
gling against the Iraqi Gov-
ernment for years. For years 
they have been losing. In 
1972, when the Kurdish cam-
paign for autonomy was in a 
brief period of dormancy, the. 
Shah of Iran asked the United 
States to help him in one of 
his perpetual feuds with 
neighboring Iraq. This time it 
was a border dispute. The 
Shah wanted the United 
States to channel clandestine 
military aid to the Kurds, rea-
soning that American support 
would inspire the Kurds for 
another military offensive 
against the Iraqi Government, 
thus weakening Iraq and aid-
ing the Shah. 
Secretary of' the Treasury 
John- Connally, acting on be-
half of Henry Kissinger and 
President Nixon, informed the 
Shah that the United States 
would go along. A $16 million 
covert- action project went 
into effect. According to 
Pike's documents, the deal 
was made in a convivial spirit 
�a favor to the Shah as one 
of the fellows. (He himself 
had been returned to power 
� �by the C.I.A. in a 1953 coup.) 
Even the C.I.A. opposed the 
scheme, but was overruled. 
The agency funneled arms 
and money to the Kurds for 
more than two years, and the 
Kurds once again rose up in 
rebellion. Their leader was so 
moved by American support 
for the Kurdish cause that he 
sent Kissinger a gold and 
pearl necklace for his new 
bride. He ;also sent word, to 
Kissinger that the Kurds were 
.ready "to become the 51st 
state" after achieving libera-
tion. 
In March 1975, the bloodied 
Iraqi Government came to 
terms with the Shah. The Very 
next day, Iran and he United 
States cut off all aid to , the 
Kurds, and the Iraqi Army 
mounted a full-scale offensive 
against them. The Kurdish 
leader, who could not bring 
himself to believe the United 
States had reversed itself so 
cynically, wrote desperate, 
pitiful appeals for help to 
Kissinger. Kissinger did not 
reply. 
An estimated 5,000 Kurdish 
refugees died fleeing the Iraqi 
crisiaught. The Shah, prag-
matic to tho last, forcibly 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
repatriated 40,000 Kurdish 
refugees to Iraq, where their 
fate, while unknown, has 
presumably been sad. The 
United States declined to pro-
vide any relief assistance to 
the remaining refugees and 
refused to accept a single 
Kurdish application for asy-
lum. 
This covert action remained 
secret, of course, until the 
Pike committee learned about 
it and leaked it to the press. 
To say the very least, the dis-
closure raised large questions 
about the compatibility of 
such covert actions with 
principles of any kind, as well 
as questions about how such 
decisions should be made. Yet 
no public debate arose, and 
except for a one-man crusade 
by The New York Times's 
columnist William Safire, -the 
Kurdish undertaking was 
widely ignored in the press.. 
The reason is Simple: The sub-
stance of the Pike report was 
completely overshadowed by 
the controversy over how it 
was leaked. 
Daniel Schorr first denied, 
and then admitted, being the 
intermediary source. His 
behavior helped draw atten-
tion to his own conduct and 
away from the conduct of �the 
C.I.A. Leaks became the issue. 
President Ford pledged the 
full resources of the executive 
branch to the search for the 
culprit on the Pike committee. 
The House of Representatives 
rose up mightily against the 
leak and authorized a 
$150,000 investigation by its 
ethics committee. A team of 
investigators began grilling 
the Pike committee staff, 
many of whose members left 
Washington in Mar. Schorr, 
three other journalists and 18 
committee staff members 
have been subpoenaed to ap-
pear before the ethics commit-
tee this Wednesday.

As the Pike committee sput-
tered to disaster, the Church 
committee released its report 
on Chile�the one case study 
on covert action it was, per-
mitted to make public ender 
the terms of its deal with the - 
C.I.A." "We negotiated with 
the agency people on the 
wording of that report, line 
by line." says one of, the Prin-
cipal authors. The agency, for 
instance, permitted publica-
tion of the fact that the I.T.T. 
had funneled $350,000 into 
the 1S70 Chilean. elections, 
but refused to allow identi-
fication of other companies 
that, among them, had fur-
nished art equivalent sum. 
Still, while abstract and in-
complete, the r-eport. is the 
most comprehensive account 
� 
of a C.I.A. covert action yet 
written. 
From 1963 to 1973, the re-
port reveals, the C.I.A. spent 
more than $13 million to � in-
fluence Chilean politics, apart 
from what it spent On gather-
ing intelligence in that coun-
try. It lavished about $3 
lion on the 1964 Chilean elec-
tions alone; on a per capita 
basis, this was twice as much 
as Lyndon Johnson and Barry 
_Goldwater together spent on 
:their Presidential campaigns 
:that year. In 1970, President 
Nixon ordered the C.I.A. to 
encourage the Chilean Mili-
tary to stage a coup rather 
than let President Salvador 
Allende take power, and the 
agency tried unsuccessfully to 
do so through its agents in 
the military. When the com-
mander in chief of the Chilean 
:Army, Ren�chneider, op- . 
posed a coup, C.I.A. officials 
entered into talks with groups 
planning to kill him. 
General Schneider was as-
sassinated by one of these 
; groups, but the elected 
Marxist President took - of-
fice, and during the three 
years of his regime, the 
C.I.A. channelled $7 million in 
covert-action. funds to a vari-
ety of Chilean unions, busi-
ness groups and political 
parties opposed to Allende. It 
also spent $1.5 million sup-
porting El Mercurio, Chile's 
largest newspaper, in its cam-
paign against Allende's poli-
cies. Several of the news-
paper's key employees were 
paid C.I.A. agents, committing 
espionage. The agency ,pro-
duced several national maga-
zines and "a large number of 
books," according to the re-
port. It had agents in most 
of the important sectors Of 
. Chilean -society, including, at 
times, the Chilean Cabinet. 
This covert activity, plus con-
firmed liaison with the mili-
tary, supplemented a slightly 
more overt program of con-
stricting Chile's position in 
the international credit mar-
ket. 
Whether or not this covert 
action "caused" Allende's 
downfall and death�and offi-
cial American spokesmen had 
been denying as late as 1973 
that there had been any 
United States attempts to in-
terfere with the Chilean elec-
tions�the Chile report did not 
make much news, noi spark 
much debate. C.I.A. spokesmen 
studiously avoided comment. 
They had the upper hand, and 
did, not cant to say anything 
that could somehow rekindle 
interest in covert action, That, 
early in 1976, could have 
raisect thc sensitive' question 
of whether the 'United States 
4 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Was, or should be, intervening 
in the Italian election cam-
paign. The issue did not come 
to the fore. Press reports that 
the agency was channeling $6 
million to ;anti - Communist 
parties in Italy died out with-
out resolution amidst the 
Welch and Schorr controver-
sies. 
By the time the Church 
committee drafted its recom-
mendations 'on covert action, 
the political base for referm-
ing the C.I.A. had disintegrat-
ed. The committee itself was 
badly divided on the issue. 
'Accordingly, the Senators 
decided not to take a firm 
position for or against covert 
action, or even to push for 
a national political debate 
over its proper use. In its con-
cluding recommendations, the 
committee declared that coy-
' ert action "must be seen as 
an exceptional act," which 
"must in no case be a vehicle 
for clandestinely undertaking 
'actions incompatible with 
American principles." To 
these vague mandates, the 
committee added some rather 
foamy standards in keeping 
with the professorial tenor of 
the staff approach: "Covert 
operations must be based on 
a careful and systematic anal-
ysis of a given situation, pos-
sible alternative outcomes, 
the threat to American inter-
ests of these possible out-
comes, and, above all, the 
likely consequences of an at-
tempt .to intervene." These 
major conclusions were sup-
plemented by the customary 
demand for more effective 
oversight by the Congress.. 
"We tended to say that most 
of the hard questions should 
be studied," observed a task-
force leader. . 
These recommendations 
amounted to a clear, though 
tortured, endorsement of the 
C.I.A.'s covert-action program. 
Moreover, they gave the agen-
cy enormous bargaining lever-
age in its efforts to keep infor-
mation secret. "The problem 
with the C.I.A.," says F.A.O. � 
Schwarz, "is that once you ac-
cept the kinds of things they 
do, it's hard to argue that 
they shouldn't disguise it bet-
ter." Once the need for some 
form of covert action is con-
ceded, it follows that the nec-
essary apparatus should be 
maintained and exercised. And 
once it is accepted that the ap-
paratus cannot possibly func-
tion solely under the mantle 
of the C.I.A., as Colby argued 
Ir. a recent interview, then 
something else follows: Pri-
vote American institutions 
should be enlisted in the 
cause. 
This chain reasoning 
matches the historical process 
by which the C.I.A. enlarged 
itself over the past three dec-
ades. At its creation in 1947, 
the C.I.A. was strictly an intel-
ligence agency, with no au-
thority or capability for covert 
action. The need for secret 
feats of derring-do and manip-
ulation arose in the cold war, 
and quickly became the vehi-
cle for the agency's spectacu-
lar growth. By the late 1950's, 
security requirements were so 
pressing that the C.I.A. was 
spinning off thousands of 
� front companies at home and 
abroad. Inevitably, this led to 
� a rationale for. intrusion into 
domestic institutions. Even 
though the agency's legal 
charter expressly forbids it 
from engaging in domestic ac-
tivities, the C.I.A. began mak-
ing arrangements for cover 
with American groups, rang-
ing from missionaries to pub-
lishing houses to some of the 
best-known corporations., 
In pressing secrecy on the 
Church committee, C.I.A. offi-
cials developed the argument 
from the basic logic of covert 
acticn, until it applied even to 
justifying continuation of do-
mestic activities. The commit-
tee gave �in on point after 
point. Thus, the C.I.A. escaped 
not only serious challenge to 
the practice of covert action 
but also the� risk of scandal 
from exposure of operations 
attendant to covert actions. No 
one knows just how much ma-
terial remains buried in the 
Church committee files or 
how much the agency held 
back, but a brief investigation 
revealed an impressive list of 
subjects which the committee 
either deleted or consciously 
failed to explore. The numer-
ous sources within the coma 
mittee staff and the C.I.A. 
who described these subjects 
requested anonymity. 
(1) Two draft sections of 
the report �"Techniques of 
Covert Action" and "Covert 
Action Projects: Initiation, Re-
view, and Approval" �remain 
classified. 
(2) So do the five covert-ac-
tion case studies the commit-
'tee agreed to keep secret. Ac-
cording to committee sources, 
the five countries are the 
Congo (now Zaire), Greece, 
Indonesia, Laos and Vietnam. 
The committee report says 
these studies show a pattern 
of covert action and penetra-
tion not unlike the one in 
Chile, In the Congo, covert ac-
tions began before the at-
tempts to assassinate Patrice 
Leanumba and continued 
through the chaotic period 
following independence in 
1960. The agency, according 
to C.T.A. swarms, helped estab-
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
fish Gen. Joseph Mobutu (now 
President Mobutu Sese Seko) 
and has maintained a covert 
relationship with him and 
other key officials ever since. 
The relationship illustrates a 
C.I.A. pattern of developing 
ties to promising foreign poli-
ticians early in their careers 
and then "sponsoring" them. 
In Greece, covert actions 
spanned some of the agency's 
proudest achievements in 
helping to prevent Communist 
domination after World War 
II. Today, the agency's ties to 
the Greek Army and secret 
police remain pervasive � so 
much so that both Colby and 
Rogovin, interviewed sepa-
rately, expressed fears for the 
stability of the present Greek 
Government if those ties were 
revealed. In Indonesia, covert 
action against the regime of 
President Sukarno persisted 
through the 1965 coup, hi 
which more than one million 
civilians died. 
0) The committee's investi-
gation into the use of classical 
espionage�obtaining informa-
tion and using it to influence 
foreign governments�remains 
classified. 
(4) The committee broke no 
new ground on the agency's 
use of American corporations 
for intelligence- work, cover, 
or covert action. Staff direc-
tor William Miller terms this 
a "failure." There was no ex-
ploration, for example, of the 
agency's work with the corpo-
rate interests of the late How-
ard Hughes�in spite of con-
firmed reports of the $300 
Glomar Explorer 
project for raising a sunken 
Soviet submarine. Senator 
Barry Goldwater, a member 
of the Church committee, 
states that corporations "are 
the third most important 
source of foreign intelligence, 
after foreign agents and satel-
lites." Committee sources say 
the agency was particularly 
reticent about corporation's 
because the issue opens the 
door to questions of domestic 
impact. � 
(5) The committee is silent 
on the issue of the C.I.A.'s use 
of American labor unions 
abroad, even though former 
agency employees, such as 
columnist Tom Braden, have 
written on the subject. One 
committee source says "no 
committee in a Democratic 
Congress is going after labor 
unions in an election year." 
Other sources say it was more 
a question of time and re-
sources, or an unwillingness 
to investigate labor after 
deciding not to look into cor-
porations. 
(6) The committee learned 
of, but did not investigate, the 
extensive network of Ameri-
can professionals who have 
secretly assisted the C.I.A. 
Lawyers, for example, per-
form functions ranging from 
liaison work with other Gov-
ernment agencies to legal rep-
resentation of C.I.A. proprie-
taries, or "front" organiza-
tions. One 'of former White 
House counsel John Dean's 
lawyers worked for a C.I.A. 
front, as did the chief counsel 
for Jeb Stuart Magruder. Paul 
O'Brien, attorney for the 1972 
Committee to Re-elect the 
President, was a former C.I.A. 
case officer and, according to 
John Dean, offered the services 
of a C.I.A. front, a law firm in 
Greece, to help launder money 
for the Watergate cover-up. 
These C.I.A. ties to the Water-
gate case alone suggeSt that 
C.I.A. relationships, with all 
their political and profession-
al implications, are not unusual 
among prominent Washington 
lawyers. 
(7) The committee agreed 
to a C.LA. request that it clas-
sify the details of a report on 
the clandestine use of Ameri-
can academic institutions. 
After noting that C.I.A. assets 
are employed by more than 
100 colleges and universities, 
the report states only that its 
purpose is "to alert these in-
stitutions that there is it prob-
lem." 
(8) After the C.I.A. issued 
new, restrictive guidelines for 
the use of American news per-
sonnel, the committee submit-
ted to a request that it classi-
fy the details of a report on 
the question. Moreover, the 
agency refused to supply the 
committee with the titles of 
several hundred books�many 
of them published abroad, in 
English, to be sold in the 
United States � that it has 
subsidized. "We couldi have 
held hearings on the C.I.A.'s 
relationship to the press that 
would have_blown the lid off," 
blurted a task-force leader 
who worked on the media 
study. 
The Church committee's 
C.I.A. reports are impressive 
on the surface�full of bu-
reaucratic history and 
weighty essays on subjects 
like "command and control." 
But the tepid conclusions and 
the omissions cited render the 
work incomplete, if not irre-
sponsible. The contrast with 
the thoroughgoing investiga-
tion of the F.B.I. is striking. 
The main reason for this is 
that F.B.I. wrongdoing in-
volved deviation from gener-
ally accepted standards for 
the bureau, whereas the 
CIA.'s covert actions ore in-
tegral to the agency's prac-
tices. The C.I.A. investigation 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
arias more difficult because it 
cut much closer to the bone. 
"The alternative to covert 
action," declares Senator 
Goldwater, "is war." Argu-
ments about covert action 
resemble arguments about 
war. If the Senator's interpre-
tation is correct, the United 
States has engaged in some 
900 alternatives to war in the 
last generation, and the Con-
gressional committees have 
partially unveiled a much 
harsher international reality 
than most citizens know about. 
The CIA. operates in a 
world that is, in fact, hostile 
and cynical. The agency's 
environment is full of plots, 
betrayals and people who are 
less noble than they seem, and 
the agency is built around the 
notion that it can only operate 
under cover. Secrecy makes 
it more effective against ruth-
less enemies. Secrecy masks 
an element of hypocrisy 
necessary in a Machiavellian 
world. It also protects the 
American people from grisly 
facts at variance with their 
self-image. In this sense, the. 
C.I.A. veterans consider them-
selves a true professional 
elite, capable of immersing 
themselves in a ruthless envi-
ronment without -losing their 
bearings, and of shouldering 
burdens for the American peo-
ple that the people would not 
want to bear or even hear 
about. 
A combination of events 
enabled the C.I.A. to prevent 
a debate on whether covert 
-action�secret wars and se-
cret alternatives to war---is 
justified or necessary. The 
C.I.A. bowled over the Pike 
committee and seduced the 
Church committee. Several 
sources on the Church com-
mittee assert that the out-
come was the result of a 
strategic decision--to duck 
the issue, under the adverse 
political conditions that de-
veloped this year, so as to be 
able to take it up again uns1.,�!r 
the authority of the new over-
sight committee, and perh7n!, 
with the assistance of a new 
Democratic Administra tien. 
There is also the hope in some 
quarters that these last two 
years of investigation and rev-
elation have bad some effect 
on the political climate, once 
so congenial to the unre-
strained use of covert action, 
and even on the way the C.I.A. 
itself thinks of its role. 
The record thus far, how-
ever, is not one to make for 
much optimism. No oversight 
committee is likely to have a 
better opportunity to control 
the C.I.A. than the Church and 
Pike committees, whose rec-
ords speak for themselves, and

WASHINGTON POST 
'1-7 SEP 1976 
Stephen S. Rosenfeld 
Covey Sperati 
In claiming that the CIA's covert op-
erations have survived scandal and in-
vestigation "intact, if not strength-
ened," journalist Taylor Branch, writ-
ing in last Sunday's New York Times 
Magazine, dignifies a -gathering Wash-
ington myth. Citizens worried about 
the official abuse of. secret power 
should know it's not so. The myth, not 
simply his article, needs to be knocked 
down. � , 
Now, it's true that dirty tricks, pre-
viously conducted without statutory or 
explicit legislative sanction, have now 
gotten official congressional license. To 
those who believe that there should be 
no dirty tricks, or that the Congress by 
sanctioning them legitimizes an illegiti-
mate practice, this may be enough to 
damn the whole process. 
It's true, too, that not all the CIA'S 
myriad operations were investigated by 
the Senate or House intelligence com-
mittees and that, of those investigated, 
not all the findings were released or 
leaked. Again, to those who look at this 
matter just in terms of investigation 
and disclosure, there's little more to 
say. 
r I find it inadequate, however, to ac-
cept either of these propositions. 
As authentic and extensive a national 
debate as can be imagined was waged 
On the question of whether the U.S. 
ought to be ready to conduct certain 
operations under certain conditions. 
Plainly, the national answer was yes. 
Congress, which reflects the full spec-
trum of public opinion on this issue, is 
moving to implement that public ver-
dict. It is not by the CIA's self-serving 
manipulations or by the Congress being 
"outfoxed" that this is happening, but 
by popular demand. Personally, I buy 
it. 
� Further, the purposes and limitations 
of investigation and disclosure must be 
understood. These can build care into a 
rampant bureaucracy and a negligent 
executive, and they can fuel a demand 
for reform in the Congress and public. 
But is it necessary or wise to investigate 
or disclose everything? Apart from the 
deference due endangered persons and 
apart from the limits of time and staff; 
there is the real and valid political lim-
it, which the Senate observed and the 
House did not, of acting in a way to 
build a political consensus. 
As Frank Church, chairman of the 
Senate inquiry, puts it, "We did not 
want to end up on the cutting room 
floor. We wanted to keep the confi-
dence of the Senate and write our rec-
ommendations into law." 
the C.I.A. has shown itself to , 
be quite adept at managing 
the political climate. The 
agency began these searching 
Investigations banging on the 
ropes, and clearly emerged the 
winner. Its powers, so unique 
and still largely hidden, re-
main essentially unchallenged. 
- �--
ings 
The Church committee achieved this 
�it forced the President into reforms 
meant to be preemptive, and launched 
the Senate on its own referms. These 
are "institutional" rather than "jour-� 
nalistic," and it is instructive to run 
down the list. 
A permanent intelligence oversight 
committee, of representative member-
ship, was set up in place of the old sys-
tem of informal review by CIA-co-opted 
legislators. Its chairman, Daniel Inouye, 
says he's proceeding with all deliberate 
speed, building staff, and savvy, and 
gaining executive cooperation: "Ii' they. 
lie to us, there'll be hell to pay." 
A charter, or statement of missions 
and prohibitions, is being drafted by 
this panel to cover the whole intelli-
gence community. It will go on top of 
the charter decreed by President Ford 
last February; Previously a broad range 
of secret intelligence activities had no 
legislative sanction and, in some cases, 
not even recorded executive sanction. 
An overall budget for the entire in-
telligence community is being drafted 
(for fiscal 1978) to replace the frag-
mented and concealed agency budgets 
of the past. The budget will be author-
ized line by line for content as well as 
money in the regular fashion, not just 
appropriated without authorization re-
view by a few congressional pals of the 
intelligence agencies. , 
The Ford executive order gave po-
tential substance to the old form of an 
intelligence "community," a concept 
that the Senate is recognizing, too. The 
necessary difficult internal exercise to 
rationalize missions and assets and 
divvy up a single budget pie is said to 
be moving ahead. 
A procedure is being worked out by 
which the Senate accepts no prior re-
straints on what information it can re-
quest from the executive branch or re-
lease to the public, and by which it can 
bargain out differences over the disclo-
re Not the 
sure�even the disclosure of "covert" 
operations. 
The Senate's new requirement that 
the President certify in writing the 
need for each covert operation has 
forced accountability upon the Presi-
dent�no more mumbles in the Rose 
Garden. This assures the Congress of. 
notification early enough to raise 
meaningful objections, Inouye insists. 
The procedure appears to improve 
upon the 1974 Hughes-Ryan amend-
ment under which the executive could. 
wait until late in the day to notify, in a 
cursory way, six congressional commit-
tees, none of them with fixed responsi-
bility or readily available staff. 
One should add that, institutional 
considerations aside, the public climate 
imposes its own restrictions on covert 
operations. Look at how congressional 
and public reaction aborted the admin-
istration's Angola operation, once the 
shape of it became clear. Fear of leaks 
is bound to further slow any adminis-
tration's covert hand. 
My main point, though, lies here: You 
can say that CIA dirty tricks survived 
"intact if not strengthened" only by 
overlooking the institutional innova-
tions�oversight committee, charter, 
budget, intelligence community forma-
tion, information rules, notification of 
operations, presidential accountability, 
plus ' executive reorganization�by 
which covert operations are now guid-
ed. 
These innovations do not make ab-
sorbing reading, as do tales of-the poli-
tics and "bureaucratics" of the intelli-
gence inquiries. But they do seem a lot 
more important. And although no final 
verdict can yet be rendered, they make 
it reasonable for citizens to hope that, 
in so far as the conduct and control of 
covert operations is concerned, things 
have indeed changed.

SUBJECT Full Text 
TOM SNYDER: - Best seat in the house, and not a packed 
house at that in Studio 6 in New York .City. Good morning, every 
body. We're on the air tonight with Mr. George Bush, .who at the 
present time is the Director of the CIA, the Central Intelligence 
Agency, George Bush has done all kinds of things during the past 
five years. He has been the United States Ambassador to the United 
Nations. He has been Chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
He has been the chief representative of the United States to the 
People's Republic of China, and he has been, and is now, the 
Director of the. CIA. And he'll join us here in just a couple of 
seconds. 
SNYDER: But as I say, tonight we have the Director. 
of the CIA, Dr. George -- or Mr. George Bush with us. .And we'll 
begin with Mr. Bush after these announcements, and I hope all Of 
you will stay tuned. 
.SNYDER: And now here is George Bush, the Director of 
the CIA, which I want to talk about tonight. But I would like to 
ask you about the importance of the death of Chairman Mao and the 
effect your think it might have on relations between this country 
and Mainland China, based upon the fact that you were our repre-
sentative there until just recently. 
DIRECTOR GEORGE BUSH,: I would say that nobody is going 
to replace Chairman Mao. You really have Lobe in China for a while 
to see the pervasive nature of his presence and of his impact on 
China. He gave the 'People's Republic -- well, he gave birth to 
the People's Republic of China and he gave China a certain unity 
and destiny, sense.of destiny that it hadn't had in many, many 
decades. And so I think it's fair to say, certainly it's my judg-
ment, and I guess what's more important to your many listeners, 
Tom, the judgment of many in the intelligence community that 
Chairman Mao is so special that we don't look for a single re-
placement to him. And I think it's going to take time to sort 
out what China does in terms of leadership. Hua Kuo-feng, who 
is now the number one man there, is a strong leader, but he lacks 
the following .that the Chairman had. He's kind of moderating be-
tween extremes, or two factions, you might say. And I think that 
China will move forward in terms of kind of a collegial government 
for a while, sort out Its new direction as it goes along. 
I don't see anything in the death of Chairman Mao, who 
indeed, along with President Nixon, made the opening: I don't 
see anything to reverse that. And I don't -- I don't think, and 
it's not my judgment, that China will move precipitously towards 
a rapprochement with the Soviet Union. 
So....

SNYDER: Excuse me.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No, go ahead. 
SNYDER: ...Is there another faction within China which . 
Would sooner have China not become too friendly with the United 
States? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Sure. There're people there that feel 
that way. There're probably some there that would like to see them 
closer to the Soviet Union. But their line has been established, 
and we don't see any radical shifts either towards the Soviet 
Union or away from the United States. 
Now, there're some -- are relationships, the United 
States and China. I don't want to get into policy, because I'm 
in the intelligence business now, although I was involved, as you 
pointed out, in the highest levels of our China policy. 
SNYDER: .And you were the first person that we have sent 
there at that level in some time. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Second. David Bruce.... 
SNYDER: Oh, excuse me 
DIRECTOR BUSH: ...my most illustrious predecessor.... 
SNYDER: Correct. Correct. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: ...opened the thing. And I was just 
honored to follow in his distinguished footsteps. But neverthe-
less, I should stay away from policy considerations in our chatting 
here tonight. 
But I would say that we don't look for anything drastic 
,on all this. And I think that there will be a difficulty before 
the United States can establish full relations with China. But 
we seek to fulfill the Shanghai Communique, which was the basic 
doctrine between our countries. We aspire to that. China, in my 
opinion, aspires to that. 
So the death of Chairman Mao, traumatic, enormously im-
portant, not only in terms of China, but in terms of the world, 
in my view will not adversely affect the relationship between 
the United States and the People's Republic of China. 
SNYDER: You've said twice in the preceding paragraph 
or two that now that you're in the intelligence business, you 
shouldn't talk about policy. Why not? You're a man with some 
political experience.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Sure. 
SNYDER: ...some policy experience, foreign policy as 
DIRECTOR BUSH: 
That's right. 
SNYDER: Ambassador to the United Nations. Why now must 
iyou switch that off? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: I've 'got to not only stay out of policy. 
Now if you say to me, how would you handle whether we ought to 
formalize our relations with China, I'd duck the question. And 
if you said to me, you know, who are you for for President, I'd 
duck that question. Because the Director of Central Intelligence 
must, one,. stay out of partisan politics, clearly. And secondly, 
he must present to the President intelligence, finished intelligence 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 002623720 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
his judgment. Under the law it's my judgment that goes to the 
President, fortunately for the country, tempered and seasoned by 
enormous professional competence. But in the final analysis, under 
the law, it's my judgment. And that judgment has to go forward 
unfettered by policy considerations. 
Sowe . . . . 
SNYDER: But can you not still speculate, based upon your. 
.broad experience;... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, I could.... 
SNYDER: ...as a private citizen? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: I mean I have the liberty of doing it. 
Well, certainly if you turn those red lights off, I'll do it with 
you. But I'm not going to do it because the Director of Central 
Intelligence and the CIA must not get into politics. 
on.. 
SNYDER: Turn the red lights off, but leave the camera 
DIRECTOR BUSH: All of them are on. 
fLaughter.1 
� DIRECTOR BUSH: No, but we -- we've got to -- we've got 
to -- we've got to let the policymakers set policy and let the 
intelligence go forward unfettered by policy constraints. . 
Say there's a policy that says country "a" and country 
we must improve relations with them. And then the President 
embarks on a course of action that says let's go forward and give 
aid and improve it. And then we find certain intelligence that 
indicates that if we do, it'll cost us the support of countries 
"c" and "d.' We shouldn't be saying., whoops, the President's 
committed to this policy that's going to support "a" and "b"; 
therefore don't you people bring me that bad news about "c" and. 
"d." We've got to go forward with the way we see it. Call them 
as you see them, you know. 
And-so if I start speculating about what I would d9 � . 
to formalize relations between China and the United States, that's 
not my job. And I couldn't separate out George Bush from the i-ole 
of the Director of Central Intelligence or the head of the CIA, 
both of which hats I wear, you see. 
SNYDER: Not with the foreign policy for the United 
States. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Yeah, you can't do it. And I sit in 
on the National Security Council meetings. I go to the cabinet 
meetings that are related to :foreign affairs. I have direct ac�
cess to the President. My access should be used to give finished 
intelligence, and let the policymakers, whoever is President, set 
the policy. And that's the way it should be, and that's the way it 
will be as long as I'm Director. 
SNYDER: Can you tell me the difference between the Rind of 
arrangement we now have with the People's Republic and how that differs 
from what will be when we have diplomatic relations   
DIRECTOR BUSH: Formal? 
SNYDER: ...established with them formally? 
*41

Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
DIRECTOR BUSH: You know, that's a tough and very 
fair question, and I will try to answer it. 
Right now we are less than --.I was less than a full 
ambassador. 
SNYDER: Well, okay. That really is the question.' What 
.was the difference between yourself and a full ambassador? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, we didn't go to the airport to 
greet foreign dignitaries. We didn't go to the Great Hall of the 
People on state occasions when a visiting foreign chief of state 
would come. There are certain protocolary differences that made 
our rank, our status something less than full. Until we have 
full diplomatic relations, our trade will not be -- not be en-
hanced. We won't have the best levels of trade, because certain 
problems that could accompany, could go along with full relations, 
such as the claims and assets question -- it could be solved before 
we have full relations; it might not be. But full relations kind 
of imply a solution to tough problems like that, you see. 
. . So we -- but beyond that and beyond the protocol ques-
.tion, there are not too many substantive things. 
SNYDER: Very subtle differences. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: They're subtle differences. And yet 
formal relations -- there're certain consular things that go with 
it. And it would be better. I mean the United States seeks friendly
relations with almost all countries. And certainly we seek friendly 
relations with the People's Republic of China. 
Now you're getting me into policy. But I say this in 
confidence because of our adherence to the Shanghai Communique.' 
But there are certain very difficult problems that remain before 
full relations can be established. 
SNYDER: Without asking you about the policy problems, 
how long a period of time would you estimate, again based upon the 
work that you did there and the work that you did to make more 
peaceful, I guess is the word I'm looking for, or more quiet, the 
entrance of Mainland China into the United Nations when you were 
there? How long would it take for this to come about where we 
would have full, formal relations with the People's Republic? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: I couldn't speculate. I can't, because. 
there are certain major problems that exist that the President 
and the chief of state in China must wrestle with and that the 
secretary of State, in our instance, and the foreign minister; 
in theirs, must wrestle with. And so really speculation -- even 
if you asked me on a pure intelligence basis, not leaving out 
my judgment as the former chief of the U. S. liaison office 
in Peking, any answer I gave you would be pure speculation. 
And I really want to duck that one because I can't give you 
an honest, useful answer. 
SNYDER: I understand that, sir. Now when that time 
comes, though, would we expect the President of the United States 
to make that announcement in concert, probably, with the Chinese 
Premier at that time? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, I think if full diplomatic rela-
tions were established with the country that has a fourth of the 
world's population, you would look for both chefs of states.... 
SNYDER: Major. Major.

Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
DIRECTOR BUSH: That's right, Tom. I mean this would 
be a major step forward. It would be a major thing, and it would 
� be considered -- certainly considered and probably announced at 
the highest level. 
.SNYDER: All right, sir. I must pause for these words 
from our sponsors. We'll continue after these messages. 
a. 
SNYDER: Why do you think it is that Richard Nixon 
was liked so apparently by Chairman Mao, to the point where he 
would invite him to come back even after Mr. Nixon left the White 
House? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: President Nixon went to China, and he 
said, "Look, I'm here in the self-interest of the United States." 
There was no phoniness. The differences that he had articulated 
all his political life were still very much in his mind. He laid 
them right out on the table. Chairman Mao understood that. The 
reason the Chairman wanted to talk to President Nixon, in my view 
is that he felt it was in the national interest of China, just as 
Nixon felt it was in the national interest of the United States. 
And there was a certain directness. There was h certain mutal 
respect. I think Chairman Mao thought President Nixon knew a lot 
about world affairs, and I think -- I know that President Nixon 
felt that Chairman Mao did. And so there was this kind of prag-
matic understanding and self-respect -- mutal respect that gave. 
President Nixon this special standing. 
And when President Nixon went back, there was all this 
kind of hogwash in the United States that the Chinese were trying 
to intervene in the New Hampshire Primary. I don't know if you 
. remember that... 
SNYDER: Surely. Yes, I do. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: And it couldn't have been further from 
,the truth. This was the fourth anniversary of the Shanghai Com-
munique. There was this mutual respect, even though they have 
very vigorous differences. And the Chinese understood that 
:President Nixon had kind of taken a gamble and had opened this 
'relationehip, ad they were honoring him for that, not to inter-
;vene in some primary. 
So I really think that's the reason that the President 
was there and what he said was the national interest of the United 
States -- "I'm here in our own self-interest." And the Chairman 
sat down and said "I'm here in the self-interest of China; now 
let's talk. And they seemed to get along and understand each 
other. 
SNYDER: Do you think that the meetings could have gone 
a different direction in 1972 between Nixon and Mao Tse-tung, that 
it could not have come off as well as it did with the Communique 
of Shanghai at the end? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, I.... 
SNYDER: You know, you label it as a gamble, that Nixon 
and Mao both took a gamble. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Sure. And I think when they -- I think 
obviously Dr. Kissinger and others 7- well, Dr. Kissinger did a 
lot of preliminary work. And I'm sure that they ironed out some 
of the more obvious hurdles, or smoothed those things out before 
11 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
the meeting took place, the meetings � in Peking took place. 
But, yes, I think up till the last minute there were 
some difficult negotiations and some problems that were unre-
solved before our then President went there. And so, yes, there 
was. a gamble involved. 
But I .think once they decided to meet, there, was enough 
at stake on both sides that some kind of agreement was destined to 
be forthcoming. And sure enough, it was. 
SNYDER: Uh-huh. The papers quoted you back in the-
1960s.when you were, I believe, in political life as saying that 
You. felt that the admission of Mainland China to the United" Nations 
would destroy that organization. Yet ironically, you were the United 
,States Ambassador to the United Nations when Mainland China was .coming 
in.. And though you fought long and well for Nationalist China to re-
main with Mainland China, it didn't work out that way. 
What changed your mind? Was it -- was it.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, there were changed circumstances. 
You see, in the early '60s -- and that was a rather accurate 
quote -- there were some demands on the part of the People's 
Republic of China for admission to the U. N. that were unaccep-
table and remained unacceptable, not only to the United States, 
but to the majority. For example, they wanted to go back -- and 
just one of the ones -- go back and say that the U. S. was the 
aggressor in Korea. Now that was a quid pro quo or .a sine qua 
non; without that we won't come to the United Nations. That 
was the early '60s. Now that was unacceptable. To me, politi-
cian or fledgling interested individual in foreign affairs, I 
was saying to myself and to my potential constituents, "Look, I 
don't think that that should bp, that the United States ought to 
go back.... 
SNYDER:-That we ought to take a rap for that. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: 
...and take that kind of rap." And 
we didn't. And so there were changed circumstances. 
And then when I was at the United Nations, why, we 
had the policy of dual representation, because we felt at that 
particglar juncture in history -- and we articulated it as best 
we could, and we fought for it -- that though there's one China, 
there is indeed two governments at this juncture, that each claimed 
to be China. And we didn't feel that the Republic of China, or 
TaiWan, should be thrown out of the United Nations, The United 
Nations voted differently. And I was Ambassador at the time. I 
worked that side of the question. The People's Republic of China 
representatives that I later got to. know very well'in Peking and 
at the V. N. ass well understood this. And we were on opposite 
sides of that. The decision was made. And then I determined,-
as U. S. Ambassador, to work as compatibly as possible with the 
will of the majority. And we did. And I think that's the proper 
way to conduct oneself. And I fought for what I believed, but 
people don't always do it the way the United States wants. 
SNYDER: If we leave aside the glamour names in China, 
Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai and others, can you tell me something 
about the kind of people that are running that country at the 
bureaucratic level, people that might correspond to our cabinet 
officers in this country or to heads of intelligence, such as your-
self? What kind of men nod women are running that country in terms 
of their competence and their understanding of the world and China's 
place? 
12 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Oh, Tom, that's a tough one, because I 
mean it would be like saying what kind of men and women are running 
this country. I mean some people would say dedicated. Others 
would say too bureaucratic. Some would say aggressive, self-
seeking. Others would say lazy and not -- not stimulated by 
their surroundings. 
So I think -- I think it's pretty much the way it 
is the whole world over. But there is a dedication to Maoism. 
There is a central -- with the people in these government posi-
tions, a strong adherence to central doctrine. In fact, there's 
very little deviation, if any, from doctrine, particularly in 
foreign affairs. And I think there's a certain lack of individual 
freedom to move away from a line in foreign affairs. We have it; 
not too much, but we have some of that, of course. 
But really, when you get down to the individuals, charm-
ing, able, well versed in languages.... 
SNYDER: Competent. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: ...competent, good grasp of history. 
Their Foreign Minister, Ch'iao Kuan-hua, educated in Germany, 
philosopher, tremendously capable. If you can get him on your 
show, you'll be doing very well. Now you and he probably would 
come at it from different philosophical points of view. But 
capable. You're saying, "Are they able? �Are they good?" Yes, 
.they're strong. 
SNYDER: The reason I ask that question is that there 
are many people in this country who so abhor all kinds of communist 
governments that they believe that the people running them are 
really wild-eyed revolutionaries who used to be in guerrilla 
armies and now, all of a sudden, are occupying places of power --
well, not all of a sudden any more in the instance of China --
.who really are not competent politically, and who really are not 
competent in terms of administering to a country that has one-
quarter of -the world's population. 
Yet I would just have to think that they must have some 
very bright people. there and some very able people who are more 
than foot soldiers who came out of the mountains in 1949 to govern 
a country. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: If a guy was a foot soldier who came 
out of the mountains in 1949 to govern a country, that doesn't 
mean he's a dumb-dumb.. But they get dumb guys; they get bright 
guys. They get fat ones; they get thin ones. They've got happy 
ones; they've got sour guys. They've got forthcoming people, 
and they've got recalcitrant, withdrawn people. And it's kind of 
like Washington, D. C. or Disneyland East. I mean it's the same 
the whole world over. 
[Laughter.] 
SNYDER: It's no secret that if China wanted to, it 
could reclaim Quemoy, Matsu and Formosa tomorrow *morning, mili-
tarily, if they wished to do that. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Tom, you're going to get me in a lot of 
policy. Go on; what's your question? 
ahead. 
SNYDER: ..No, I'm not. No, it's not going to be.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: That's your statement; not mine. Co 
� SNYDER: I think they could if they wanted to. And I 
17: 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
think that if they wished, for example, in 1999 or whenever the 
treaties on the new territories, the leases run out in Hong Kong, 
they could reclaim those.militarily with absolutely no problem. 
The question is, will they? Now, if that's a policy 
question, then you can duck it. But I just have to think to my-
self that if they really were a vengeful nation bent upon gaining 
revenge for all of the wrongs they believe have been committed 
against them over the last twenty-five or thirty years, they would 
go after Formosa, and they would go after Hong Kong and seize that 
rich port and its economic treasures. But they don't do that. 
� DIRECTOR BUSH: You make a good point. But I would 
only add, because it will get me closer to policy than I want to 
get, they would be contemplating how will others respond. And we 
have a mutual defense treaty at this point in our history with 
the Republic of China. And anybody in Peking making that kind Of 
decision will obviously be thinking about that. Beyond that, I 
don't want to go. But it certainly would be an inhibition to 
adventure. And I think that the people in Peking dnderstand this. 
On the other hand, that doesn't mean -- I'm not trying to predict 
what they will or won't do. 
SNYDER: Yes, sir. We will continue And get into the 
business of how Bush runs the CIA.. That we are allowed to 
talk about, I assume. 
we? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Yes, fully. 
.SNYDER: We can talk about intelligence policy, can't 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Fully. 
SNYDER: Fully. Right after these announcements from 
.our sponsors. 
��� 
SNYDER: What kind of a job is being the Director of 
ithe CIA? Is that. a political. job? You were appointed to that � 
lby the President. You are a Republican. You have run for office. 
;You have worked for the Republican presidency for some time. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No, it's not a political job in the 
isense of partisan. In fact, when -I went into the job,. I properly 
:forswore all partisan political activity. Now when I was nominated 
for the job by President Ford, there was some debate, rather heated 
Aebate. in the United 'States Senate as to whether I should be in. 
�ithe job because I'd been Chairman of,the Republican National Com-
mittee, I'd been a Republican member of the United States Congress. 
I convinced the senators, an overwhelming majority of 
'them, that an American citizen can participate in partisan politics 
with partisanship and with fervor, and when out of that can do a 
nonpartisan job, as I think I did as Ambassador to the United 
-
Nations, as chief of the liaison office in China in nonpartisan 
fashion. 
And so I went down there and said, "Look, I -- I think 
I can do this job. It's an administrative job; it's a coordina-
tive job; it's a job where the Director must have the confidence 
of the President and he must have some confidence in the Congress, 
and I'm not going to be involved in partisan politics. And if I 
did, I ought to be thrown out, because the Central Intelligence 
Agency and the intelligence community must be free of partisanship." 
And I hope I've conducted myself in that manner. And I think I 
have. And certainly I've tried to: And fortunately for me, 
14 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
because I like the job and I am enthralled with the mission and 
I'm impressed with the people I work with in terms of their dedica�
tion and their competence -- fortunately the United States Senate 
agreed and I was confirmed. And there were some doubters, and I 
understand that. 
SNYDER: I was going to ask you, do you think the debate 
over your nomination and your qualifications was a proper debate 
ifor the representatives of the people...? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Of course it was. Of course it was 
!proper. And, you know, I'm human, and I didn't like it, and 
Isome of the senators said things that I wish they hadn't said. 
;But my goal the minute I was confirmed is not to go back and show 
a vendetta, but to try to earn the confidence and the respect of 
those who voted against me for understandable reasons. And only 
history will tell if I can do that. 
SNYDER: .How effective have you been in at least gaining 
some kind of rapprochement with those senadors who did not want 
you to have the job? Did you actively seek them out on a. 'personal 
'basis afterwards or just let your work speak for itself? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No. .I tried to ,say, look, from this 
moment on I'm going to do what I said I'd do; butt out of partisan 
politics, lay aside -- saying to myself, lay aside the debate; 
bury my own strong feelings about "Why wasn't this guy for me 
or not,' and earn his confidence. And I don't know how it's 
working. You should ask some of those senators. 
But you know, I'm kind of goal oriented. And I'm going 
to convince them � through performance, not through a lot of PR, 
that the majority was, correct., But much more important than 
any personal thing is, you know, how is the intelligence community 
running? Good God, these people were. subjected. to some excessive 
abuse. not saying everything was perfect in the past; and 
I'll be glad to discuss that with you.. But there has been a 
piling on.... 
SNYDER: Well, I want, you to know. I might as well 
say this for the benefit of the people who are watching too. I 
don't think the purpose of this hour should be to go over all of 
the charges, proved and disproved, of the last five or ten years 
and try to hold you accountable for you [sic] and say "Now, 
what are you going to do about that?" I think that.... 
-DIRECTOR BUSH: Thank God. 
SNYDER: Well, I think committees of the Congress have 
done their job properly. I think that the reports have all come 
out. The record is there for people to see. And obviously you 
were appointed or chosen by President Ford as Director of the CIA 
to go forward from the bad old days, if that's.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: That's what .1 want todo._ 
SNYDER: Which I'm sure My detractors will say, 
I'm letting you off easy. But I don't think.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, but -- yes, some will say that. 
The sensationalists will say that. But look, intelligence, foreign 
intelligence is Vital to the national security in these troubled 
times. We know what we up against. We don't know all about it, 
but we know enough about it to have just totally convinced me, not 
only when I was a consumer of intelligence in China, in the United 
Nations, but now when we produce it and I'm responsible for this --
to absolutely convince me that an intelligence capability second to

Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
none is vital to legitimate national security. 
So I do want to look ahead. And yet I continually have 
to look over my shoulder. And I'm delighted. You know, if you 
get some flak out of it, too bad, and you probably will, because 
there're people who want to still criticize us. 
SNYDER: Well, we'll refer those people back to about five 
programs we've done on this series with, for example, Mr. Hirsch 
of the New York Times and other reporters and writers and members 
of organizations which are anti-CIA. They've all had their say 
on many occasions, and we've heard it all before. I would like 
to see what's coming tomorrow rather than worry about what's 
going on -- or what went on yesterday. 
But just one question in that area. When � you say you 
yant,an intelligence establiShment second to none, fine. But � 
�there is a feeling I think created by. the investigations and 
..by the probings of Congress that we have far too many people 
working in intelligence in. this country, that almost every other 
person might be a CIA agent or might be an FBI undercover man, 
or might be with the local police department in plain clothes, 
and that we have too many people checking on those of us who 
are not doing any investigating.. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Yes, that's a myth. I'm absolutely 
convinced it's a myth. Our personnel levels are subject to 
Minute scrutiny by the proper oversight committees in the Con-
gress. And if they felt that -- and believe me, they go over 
every budget figure, personnel ceilings that you mention, now, 
with a fine tooth comb. And if they thought there was excessive 
staffing, that would have come out in these Senate -- in the 
Senate report or in the House committee report, or in one of the 
thirty-seven appearances, official appearances before Congress 
that I've made in nine months of being Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency. 
,And so I'm not saying we can't be more efficient. .I'm 
not,saying we can't cUt. back here or .there. But this concept that 
you accurately portray that Americans feel the CIA has excessive 
?people spying is nonsense. It's wrong. 
SNYDER: I had a man on this program who said that there's 
a very good probability that there could be an employee or two some-
where at RCA or NBC. I don't know how many people this company 
employs; too many in some areas. That this man might also be 
working for the CIA. 'Well, now, if I found out that there was 
a co-worker of mine here who was working for your company and was ' 
taking notes on what me and my colleagues did or people who ca-me 
on this show or any other and sent them down to your office in 
Langley, Virginia, I'd be highly upset about that.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Sure you would. 
SNYDER: I don't think your agency has any business in 
this building. 
DIRECTOR SYNDER: And we're not in it. And the very fact 
that he gets credibility by saying that on this show, with no proof, 
not being compelled to come forward with the facts, gets me -- I 
can't use the phrase I used to use in the Navy. I'm upset about 
it, because it's not true. And it's been investigated. 
SNYDER: It starts with "T" and it rhymes with teed-
off. Okay?

DIRECTOR BUSH: .No, it starts -- yes. I've got to be 
careful. I don't want to get people calling in. But no, it's 
1:ot right. And if.it were true, it'd be all over every headline. 
And yet we are living with that kind of myth. Movies come out.. 
Robert Redford and "Seven Days of the Condor," with CIA guys 
gunning down each other in the United States. Nobody ever 
alleged that. The sensationalism, the excesses of the investi�
gation. We're kind of propelled into this kind of nonsense, and 
we have to live with it. But we're professionals. We're patient. 
We know our mission is important. We know we're living within � 
-- properly now within the constitutional constraints, and we're 
determined so to do. We're subjected to proper oversight by the 
President on the executive side, by seven committees of the Congress 
And I am very comfortable, as one who prides himself on some sen�
sitivity for the rights of American citizens, with the way the 
intelligence community is conducting itself. 
SNYDER: And isn't it just too bad that the former 
President really bastardized the CIA throughthe whole Watergate 
thing, or it was alleged that he did that to the CIA? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: There have been allegations against 
several former Presidents. People look back at the Bay of Pigs 
an say, using ninety/ninety hindsight, this was wrong. But my 
v5ew -- and I do appreciate your not dwelling on the past, though 
I'll glad to respond to any question �you ask about it to the best 
of my ability.... 
SNYDER: I believe it. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: But there have been errors, and there 
have been, using 1976 moral judgments, some condemnations of 
things in the past. But Tom, we're in a tough ball game, and 
we better be prepared, we better produce the best intelligence 
we can; we better have the best analysts, Ph. D.s, MAs; we better' 
have the best security for the premises here and aboard; we better 
have dedicated people willing to sacrifice. And .we've got these 
things. 
SNYDER: And still people who have a tittle humaneness, 
a little compassion, a little sensitivity.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: We need that, sure. 
SNYDER: ...and a little romance in their approach to 
DIRECTOR BUSH: That's right. It's not a James Bond life 
that we're in. And yet covert action is a small percentrge....

DIRECTOR BUSH: No. And I've not yet met Fussy Galore

[Laughter.] 
SNYDER: I can help you there.. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: I don't want any ef that. Listen, I've 
got enough problems running the CIA nn4 the intelligence community. 
SNYDER: We will continue with Director Bush after 
these announcements. I hope you'll stay tunel.

SNYDER: ...nonpOlitical'nature of your job for a second 
here. � If somebody from the Committee to Re-Elect President Ford 
were to call and say the President would like you to make a cam-
paign speech, you would say no. � 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Not only would I say no. I'm a former 
Chairman of the Republican National Committee. I didn't go to 
the convention, didn't go near it; stay away from any political 
gathering; feel constrained to not even support the candidate of 
my choice as an American citizen; insist that we -- upon presiden-
tial instruction, but that we fully and properly, as we should, 
brief Governor Carter, the contender, the major contender to the 
President for the presidency. And if you or anyone else point 
to anything that I do that smacks of partisanship, I shouldn't be 
in it. The agency's been under enough fire. And the process --
much more important, the impartiality from politics of the process 
is so'important that a Director ought not to be political. 
Now, I think I can.be a-good Director of CIA. 
SNYDER: If JerryFord called you on the phone tomorrow, 
'which I'm sure he would not do, but if he did and he said "George, 
.�I'd like you to go out to Oswego, Michigan and .make ,a little talk," 
you would say "Mr. President, I'm not going." 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No, I wouldn't, and II1-1 make.... 
SNYDER: .What would you say? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: ...the differentiation for you. I'll make 
the differentiation for you. He's the President. I'm the head of 
one of many executive agencies. I serve at the pleasure of 
the President. Now if he said -- I'd say, "Mr. President, what 
is the purpose, or what do you want me to do in Oswego; Michigan?" 
If he says "I want you to go out and make me look good politically:" 
I'd say "I won't do it." But if he said "There's a group out there 
� that's long been interested in intelligence,..and as the President 
of the United States, they're interested in the executive order 
that's reformed the intelligence community, and each year the 
Director of CIA has done this and I'd like you to do it," I'm 
going to do it. 
SNYDER: Such as at the University of Michigan.. Okay. - 
-I understand. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: And so we've got to draw the line between, 
you know, the concern people have that a President might ell the 
CIA Director to do something iriproper, and the other line is that 
there's one President, and he deserves the loyalty and the best 
judgment of his Director of CIA, just as he does of Interior, 
HUD, Defense, or whatever it is. 
So I don't want to be a free-floating spirit. The CIA 
must be under the control of the President. And the President 
should be able to fire the Director of CIA or tell him what to 
do. But he shouldn't be able to tell him to do something that's 
improper. 
Your question connoted political impropriety, and that 
I woutdn't do and, without injecting a partisan note in it, this 
President wouldn't ask me to do, you see. And so I -- I -- I 
don't think we've got a conflict on this one, Tom. 
� SNYDER: What if Jimmy Carter is elected in November? 
What happens to your job? 
; 
DIRECTOR BUSH: I serve at the pleasure of the President. 
And I would not make it difficult for a new President to get rid 
18 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
of me. And I'll tell you why. I don't believe the agency or the 
Director of CIA, Director of Central Intelligence or the head of 
CIA should be partisan. But I do believe strongly that. whoever 
heads the intelligence community, the Director of Central Intelli-
gence, must have the confidence of the President. He can't serve 
intelligence well if he doesn't. And the President is ill-served 
if he can't have confidence in what the Director is telling him. 
And so there is a certain compatibility separate and 
apart from politics that is in the national interest. And so-what 
happens, I don't know. And I really think it's far less important 
than whether this community stays strong, the intelligence community. 
And so I would say "Mr. President, any time you want to get a new 
man in here-, please proceed so to do." And I don't think that is� 
making partisan a nonpartisan job. It's simply my conception of how 
government ought to operate. 
SNYDER: I don't have historicity in my head as to 
what happens when a President of a different party comes into 
office. Do you remember what happened.,.. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Vis-a-vis CIA? 
- SNYDER: Yes. When Johnson came in, or when Johnson 
left and Nixon came in. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, Dulles -- Dulles was eventually 
replaced by Kennedy. There was a little period of time. I mean 
President Kennedy replaced..,. 
SNYDER:, Replaced Allen Dulles. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: ...Allen Dulles. I can't 7- be 
honest; I haven't looked beck. 
SNYDER: Who was in when -- does anybody in the room 
know when Johnson and Nixon.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, Dick Helms. 
SNYDER: Well, he remained. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: But I don't remember. I thought you 
were talking about turnovers. I.can't.... 
SNYDER: No, I'm just wondering. The minute Kennedy 
took office from a Republican, Eisenhower, did you fire the CIA 
Director? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No, no. 
SNYDER: I don't think so. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No, no, no, no. 
SNYDER: And when Nixon took it from the Democrat, Mr. 
Johnson, did he fire the CIA Director? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No. But in fairness.... 
SNYDER: And I'm not trying to dictate.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: NO, but in fairness, Tom, there has 
never been a Director who has had as active a political past as 
I have. And so just as I understood the debate on my nomination 
before the Senate, I would understand a review of my position, if. 
for no other reason than because I had been actively involved on the 
19

Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
other side of the political spectrum, you know, should your 
hypothesis work out. 
But again I come back, not trying to sound holier than 
thou, but that's inconsequential. What really is essential is 
that the proper relationship be established. And we've-got it . 
now. It's working well. The Director of Central Intelligence' 
is given access to a President that supports the concept of a 
strong foreign intelligence community. And that's what's essen�
tial, whoever is President. And my future, my getting.a job 
really is coincidental. 
SNYDER: We will continue after these announcements,: 
hope you'll stay tuned. 
SNYDER: You mentioned that you feel it's proper that 
,Carter, the Democratic nominee, be briefed on certain,items. 
Who decides how much he will be told? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, in the final analysis, the President. 
The President's instructions to me, as head of the'intelligence com�
munity, is the determining factor. But the Presiaent took a very 
broad view. He said I think that it's most important that the 
�7 that Governor Carter be given intelligence briefings. But then 
I worked out, as the designee of the President, with Governor Carter 
the parameters of the briefings. And we decided that they should 
be on intelligence, that they should stay away from policy and that - 
they should stay away from sources and methods, which is a certain 
code for the things I am to protect under the law. Governor Carter 
recognized that he didn't need to know at this juncture .the sources 
and methods of the intelligence. And so our briefings-have consisted 
of finished intelligence. I've attended the two briefings on intel�
ligence, and fortunately for him with me went some of our very.top 
experts in the areas that he was interested in. And we're not 
holding back. The President has made clear to me he wants Governor 
Carter fully briefed, and this is what we're doing. And the bene�
ficiary is the United States of America. 
SNYDER: Now in the briefings -- and if you can't say, 
you will just say "I can't say." I understand because I'm a neo�
phyte and I don't want to get into areas of great sensitivity. 
But do You brief, the opposition candidate on methodology, per�
sonnel, location, or do you brief him on things that are happening 
currently in countries where we operate intelligence installations? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: It's'the latter. We don't go into thetho�
Sources and methods of intelligence we don't go into.-
SNYDER: Like in country "X," Mr. "A" is doing such and 
such to make sure that political Mr. "B" will not advance. That ' 
kind of thing? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No. We don't go into the source or 
method. What we go into is here's the way one conceives the 
istrength of the Soviet Union, for example, where it's up against 
NATO, you know.' Or, here's what we think that might happen in 
China after Chairman Mao passes on. Or, here's a current intel�
ligence briefing. Here's the status of what might be going on 
in come area, maybe the Middle'East or Africa, or wherever it is. 
SNYDER: I understand. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: We stay out of policy. We give him 
intelligence. We respond to questions. And I hope it's working

to.his satisfaction. The people at the .CIA, the professionals 
with whom I work, feel that the briefings have gone reasonably 
well. 
SNYDER: Will there be more before the election? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: That depends on what Governor Carter 
feels he requires. 
SNYDER: I see. Now what.... 
DIRECTOR BUSH: The President has authorized me to give 
him what he needs in terms of intelligence briefings. 
SNYDER: Has he asked for anything you wouldn't tell him? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Now, Tom, you're getting into.... 
SNYDER: I understand. 
DIRECTOR BUSH: No, I don't think so. I don't think 
he has. No. And I don't think we had any differences with the 
Governor. 
SNYDER: What arrangement is there, though, and I'm cer�
tain there must be some, between the President and Governor Carter 
in terms of using information supplied by yourself and your associates 
as campaign issue or campaign speechmaking source? 
DIRECTOR BUSH: Well, I don't -- I don't -- if there is 
some arrangement that they've discussed, something between them of 
that nature -- certainly I've not been any intermediary on that kind 
of an arrangement. I don't expect that kind of an arrangement exists. 
I think that any recipient of highly classified intelligence in the 
position of Governor and certainly the President recognizes he's 
dealing with sensitive information. And I don't expect there will 
be an abuse of this information. 
But should that have been discussed, it hasn't been dis�
cussed with me, nor should it be. That would be an arrangement, a 
policy kind of a thing that would be worked out elsewhere. But I 
don't believe there's such an arrangement.

iiigPL,ne 
By Laurence 'Stern 
Washingioti Post Staff Writer 
Leo Cherne, one of President Ford's 
chief intelligence advisers, .is a cen-
tral figure in a Justice Department 
national security investigation that NI 
,being described by federal officials as 
"the green book affair." � 
The green book is a. government 
Mite pad in :which a staff aide to - 
Cherne recorded briefings with diplo-
matic and intelligence officers during 
a trip to Europe in March, 1975. 
Cherne is chairman of the Presi-
dent's Foreign Intelligence Advisory 
Board and a member of the newly 
;formed three-member Intelligence' 
'Oversight Board.- � 
The notebook, officially described 
�.as having contained "classified infor-
mation. . . injurious � to. the national 
security of the United States," disap-
peared immediately after Cherne and 
his aide, Cmdr. Lionel H: Olmer, re-
turned from the European trip. 
Here the plot thickens. �liner, an 
intelligence officer during his entire 
'19-Year naval ;career, says he has no 
idea how the little green notebook got 
� out of his pessession. He 'is described 
by associates as an extremely meticu-
lous professional experienced in the 
'�handling of classified material. 
-Within several hours after his ar-
rival at his Rockville,: Md.. home; he 
called.Wheaton.Byers, executive see-
'retary,of the Foreign ,Intelligence Ad-
visory Board and advised. him .of the 
notebook's disapPearance,�he said yes-
terday. � An. investigation. was con-
dueted and the notebook waspre-
sumed lost when � the aircraft cabin 
was cleaned. � 
:The mystery was solved�to' the 
greater consternation of :Cherne and. 
Olmer�on July 24, 1975, when the in-
'telligence adviser received a tele-
phone call from Michael James Casey 
of Los Angeles. 
"He said, 'I have your notebook,'_" 
.Cherne recounted yesterday in de-
scribing what he called a "14-month 
ordeal." � 
� It was during this and subsequent 
telephone conversations that Cherne 
learned. that Casey had served two 
years at �Soledad Prison near San � 
Francisco., Casey. further . explained 
that he had recovered the notebook' 
from sympathizers of Patricia Hearst, 
who was then at large. 
Casey contended that the finders of 
the notebook had hoped that It "might 
be 'exchanged for considerations in 
their behalf and I -told him that I 
wouldn't do it even if I could," 
Cherne said. 
Casey, in a relephont int erview 
'from Omaha, wil:ire he was acquitted 
yesterday of a "felonious entry" 
charge, insisted: "I was,not trying to 
burn Chernc.1 told him hoW ;1 got the. 
Iniok and the interest of the people 
who had found it." 
Casey is a �32.year-old Californian 
who prides himself on his work in re-
setlhIneni. of Vietnamese l'eljigees, 
who sought to appear as a witness in 
behalf of Hearst at her trial on 
Li Qer 
-charges of. bank robbery, and who 
wound up, in an ironic turn of the 
story, working briefly for the Interna-
kional Rescue Committee of which 
'-Cherne was chairman of the board. 
es ..Early last year Casey persuaded the 
:Los Angeles Times to send him and 
:two staff reporters to Hong Kong at a 
� reported cost Of $15,000 for a prom-
ised rendezvous with Hearst. The 
newspaper subsequently described the 
episode as a hoax. Casey- acknowl-
edged that ,the Hearst trip "bummed 
out." 
� Casey's career also encompassed a 
Ifine-month period as director of spe-
':;eial projects for Boys Town, the Ne-
hraska community started by Father. 
�-Flanigan, from which he was fired in. 
a dispute with the administration over. 
; the alleged theft of 31 files for an 
MGM television production. ("One of 
my jobs," he said, "was to get them 
publicity.") 
When Cherne found out who had 
turned up with his notebook, lie noti-
fied the intelligence staff arid was 
advised "to play it down and not make 
it appear to lie important.", The initial 
judgment was that the loss was not 
of great security significance. 
Cherne maintains . that he first 
learned that Casey was employed in 
, the Los Angeles' office. of the Inter-
national Rescue Committee as a con-
sultant during an Aug. 22, 1975,' phone 
conversation with him. "I said, 'I 
don't think terribly much about your' 
'association with IRC and when 1: �de-
.cide finally, I'll ask. for your. resigna-
ham' " 
The green notebook was returned 
on Aug. 26, 1975, and �Cherne turned 
it over to. the intelligence, staff. Three 
weeks later he called Casey and asked 
for his resignation. "He submitted 
cheerfully, always cheerfully," Cherne 
'reminisced. 
On Sept.. 72 Casey sent a Mailgram 
to the paesiding judge in the Herst 
case, Oliver J. Carter, in the name of 
the IRC. 
"We prayfully requeSt; that Patricia 
Hearst be admitted to bail." the tele-
gram' read. "Please consider that 
Patty Hearst was directly and indi-
rectly esponsible for the safe eVaella-
ti on oi' 390 mon, women and childran 
wit hat4 regard to lice own safety (lul--
ing last. week 1975,- at 
Seieon, South Vietnam." 
Ttic telegram was immediately re-
Imitafed by the MC on Cherne's in-
structiona. ; 
In Echeuary of this year Cherne 
was appointed to the Intelligence 
-,Oversi Board by' 'President. Ford 
and also named chairman of the For-
eign Intelligence Advisory Board, of 
which he was a member at the time of 
' his European trip. His offices here

Of CA" 
; The notebook, according to in-
formed saurces, contained notes on 
briefings with embassy and Central 
Intelligence Agency officials about a 
number of issues, including reactions 
'to news steries about the CIA, the im-
pact of the massive flow of petrodol-
lars .`roin th.e. West. to the Arab states, 
as well as "unprecedented unemploy-
meet and. catastrophic inflation" in 
' European countries.. . . 
; There was an-early reference-in the 
notebook, both Cherne and Casey. ac-
knowledge, to New York Times re-
porter Terry Robards. Casey located 
'Bollards in New York, he said, and it 
was the Times reporter who specu-
lated that the initials "L.C." in the 
; notebook must have referred to 
Cherne. This, said Casey, IS: how he 
� concluded that the notebook belonged

FU Inquiry 
n Leftist 
Party ahed 
Long Probe Finds 
'�No Wrongdoing by 
Socialist Workers 
By John M. Goshko 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
The Justice Department reveal-
ed yesterday that it has ordered 
the FBI to halt its 38-year investi-
gation of the . Socialist Workers. 
Party�a small left-wing political 
group whose counterattack helped , 
to plunge the FBI into crisis: � ! 
The bureau had been pursuing the 
SWP � since 1938 without producing 
any evidence of wrongdoing by the 
party or its members. 
The FBI's activities caused the SWP � 
In 1973 to file what has become a $40 
Million lawsuit against the bureau and 
other federal law enforcement agenc-
ies, charging them With illegal harass-
ment and intimidation. 
lAs a result of evidence uncovered 
by the lawsuit, the Justice Department 
has been conducting a seven-month 
Investigation into allegations that the 
FBI carried out widespread illegal 
burglaries against suspected "extrem-
ists" during the past five years. 
Justice Department spokesmen con-
firmed that the FBI had been ordered 
to stop investigating the SWP after it 
was learned yesterday that the depart-
ment had sent letters to the SWP and 
to judge Thomas P. Griesa, who is 
hearing the suit in U.S. District Court 
�in New York, notifying them of the 
action. 
The spokesmen said Attorney Gen- . 
eral Edward H. Levi had issued the 
order following a "systematic review". 
. of how recently issued guidelines cov-
ering domestic security investigations 
apply to the SWP and its youth affili-
ate, the Young Socialist Alliance. 
The spokesmen insisted that Levi's 
decision came in the course of review-
ing the cases of all political groups 
under investigation by the FBI and 
had no connection with the still pend-
ing lawsuit. � ./ 
Levi's guidelines stipulate that' the� 
FBI can investigate an organization or 
individual only if it has evidence that 
they have been engaged in some spe-
cific Illegal act. The guidelines bar the 
FBI from maintaining surveillance of 
a group solely for the purposes of 
gathering intelligence or because it 
suspects that the members might do 
something illegal. 
TBI Director Clarence M. Kelley 
also released a statement last night, 
saying that the bureau had partici-
pated with Levi in the review. Kelley 
added. "We ;agree it is now neceL;sary 
to discontinue such investigations." 
. In New York, Cathy Perkus. ' a 
spokeswoman for the Political Rip.hts 
Defense Pend, which is financing the 
SWP suit, said: 
"We don't believe that this was 
dii.'n';` routinely. It's 'no Coincidence 
that they picked the one organization 
that has been laying bare all the FBI's 
'abuses and illegalities. We think they 
did it in hopes that we would end our 
lawsuit and put a stop to the revela-
tions about what the FBI has done." 
.Perkus said the SWP plans to con-
tinue prosecuting its suit. She added 
that the SWP will ask Judge Griesa to 
issue a permanent injunction barring 
any further FBI activity against the 
SWP and to order the bureau to turn 
over immediately the names of all-
present and past informers infiltrated 
into the party. 
The SWP, whose national member-
ship is believed net to exceed 2,000, 
has its ideological roots in Trotsky-
ism, a revisionist Marxist ideology 
based on the theory that permanent, 
worldwide revolution is needed to 
maintain economic systems beneficial 
to the working classes. 
The party has insisted for years 
that it has no connection with the 
Communist Party or movement and 
does not advocate violence as a means 
of overthrowing the U. S. capitalist 
system. 
' In its suit, which originally asked 
damages of $37 million, the SWP 
charged that its pursuit of legitimate ' 
political activities had been seriously 
undermined by an FBI "dirty tricks" 
campaign. The FBI activities included 
the use Of paid informers, wiretap-
ping, interception and opening of mail 
and burglaries of SWP offices and the 
homes of its'members, the party al-
leged. 
' Also named as defendants in the 
suit ;were other federal agencies, in-
cluding the Central Intelligence 
Agency, the National Security Agency 
and the Internal Revenue Service. 
The suit is still a long way from res-
olution. But it already has triggered'a 
number-of sensational disclosures that. 
Include: " 
� An unprecedented admission by 
an FBI agent, George P. Baxtrum Jr., 
that, prior to 1965, he participated in 
at least 50 burglaries of SWP offices 
in New York at the direction of his sti-
.periors.

Ex-chief Colby 
defends CIA's 
worth to nation 
by DAVID ZIELENZIGER 
Speaking dispassionately and almost as 
if he had never been fired as director of 
the Central Intelligence Agency 10 months 
ago, William E. Colby last night defended 
the intelligence community's ability to 
cope with threats to national security in 
the future. 
While he spent most of his 35-minute 
lecture at Towson State University de-
scribing the rationale for intelligence op-
erations, Mr. Colby also admitted "we did 
do things wrong in the past, but now we 
have corrected them." 
The former CIA executive refused to. 
comment, however, on the merits of a 
. , 
tioned about � his knowledge . of 'bur-
glaries against the SWP. 
.� Disclosure that an FBI informer, 
Timothy J. Redfearn, committed three 
burglaries against the SWP � .the 
most recent in July � and turned doc-
uments taken in these break:ins over 
to the bureau's Denver field office. 
" .� A charge by a Portland. Oreg., 
man, Alan 11._Selling, that the FBI 
had paid him to join the SWP and act 
as an informer against the party. Sell-
ing' also contended that he was 'in-
duced by FBI officials to commit an 
illegal burglary, but he said that was 
.directed against an organization not 
.connected with the SW?. 
� � Revelation that the bureau, over 
'the years, had used approximately 1,4 
600 persons as informers against the 
.SWP and still retains 66 informers 
posing as members of the party. 
The lawsuit also has had repercus-
� .�sions that go far beyond the FBI's in 
, eolvement with the SW?. Earlier this 
year, Judge Griesa nrdered the bu-
reau to search the files in all its of-
:flees and turn over to the SWP all 
documents relating to the party. 
: The resulting documents search 
turned up a previously secret file in 
the New York field .office indicating 
that the FBI had committed bqrglar-
ies in the course of domestic security 
investigations during 1972 and 1973. 
.Previously, the bureau had said it . 
ceased such so-called !`black bag jobs" 
in 1966. 
- This information prompted tire Jus-
Ake Department to launch an investi-
igation, that has spread across the 
;country .to a number of cities. It has 
:resulted in the empaneling of a fed-
eral grand .iiiry .cew York to.probe 
ithe break-ins there '-and consider 
'whether the FBI officials involved-
should be indicted on criminal 
:charges. � 
. Sources familiar with this investiga-
tion said yesterday that the grand 
jury should complete the first phase 
of its inquiry by the end of.this week 
or early next week. 
In this initial Wiese, the sources 
added, Justice Department lawyers 
have concentrated on presenting to

tion from FBI agents who, during 1972 
and 1973, were assigned to the New 
�York field office's squad investigating 
the radical Weather Underground. 
gal ease initiated by the Socialist Workers' 
party over government spying on domes-
tic dissidents and insisted, in the face of a 
hostile questioner, "The em. does not train 
people to torture." 
Mr. Colby, under whose direction the 
intelligence community made public 
many of its past controversial activities, 
insisted that under new presidential direc-
tives and with adeouate congressional 
oversight previous abuses will not have a 
chance to be repeated. 
"It may be again necessary for the CIA 
to assist decent local people suffering un-
der a racist despot," Mr. Colby said, "but 
from our mistakes in Vietnam we have 
learned that we don't use military assist-
ance. to solve a political problem." 
"One doesn't discuss disbanding the ar-
my or the police because of mistakes that 
were made in handling a case," asserted 
the 56-year-old attorney, "and that same 
lesson must be applied to intelligence." 
About 500 persons attended the lecture.

K Ass 
sinati in: Curiosity in 
.. An inquisitive American learns many things on a 
visit to Cuba. One of the most surprising is that high 
officials in Havana seem genuinely hopeful that the 
investigation of the Kennedy assassination will be re-
opened. They are convinced that there was a Cuban 
�factor in the murder. 
� Conversations with senior officials of the Cuban 
government, including Deputy Prime Minister Carlos 
Rafael Rodriguez, make clear that they have followed 
closely the disclosures by the Senate Intelligence 
Committee casting doubt upon the Warren Commis-
sion investigation The Cubans are well aware that the 
doubts center on the failure of the CIA and the FBI to 
inform the Warren Commission of the several plots 
mounted by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro. Knowledge 
of these plots appears to have been withheld even 
from the FBI and CIA officials who were responsible 
for investigating the President's murder and for sup-
porting the work of the Warren Commission. As a re-
sult, there was no special effort to explore the possi-
ble Involvement of either the Cuban government or. 
Cuban exiles in the assassination. Evidence developed 
by. the Senate committee makes both hypotheses plau-
sible�and a new inquiry imperative.

adequate prop for their predilections. The commis-
sion did not know that on Nov. 22, 1963, at. about the 
very hour Oswald struck in Dallas, an agent of the 
Central Intelligence Agency was meeting with a rank-
ing Cuban official (code-named AMLASH and re-
cently identified as Rolando Cubela) to plan the mur-
der -of Castro. Simultaneously. in Cuba, a French re-
porter. Jean Daniel� was spending the day with Cas-
�trt2, conveying to the ,Cuban leader views expressed 
by Presidentits.7.4,-:nedy in a brief interview at the 
White House-nn Oct. 'V.:, persuading Castro that Ken-
nedy wanted to explore ways to normalize relations. 
Thus, .at the. moment. the President was killed, U.S. 
policy toward Cuba appeared to be moving not only 
On two tracks but in opposite directions, and ?novo-
ment oneithertrack could have provoked violent re-
sponse by one or another Cuban faction. - 
Perceptions inside the Cpban government re-
sponded to 'both tendencies. in U.S. policy. There is 
good reason to suspect that the AMLASH operation 
involved a double agent, or at least a singularly inept 
one. Castro almost certainly knew of it. The CIA even-
' � tually concluded that the AMLASH activity was "inse-
cure" and terminated it. Among other discoveries, 
within two days of the assassination it was known (but 
not, to the Warren Commission) that AMLASH had 
been in contact, with Soviet personnel in Mexico City, 
where Oswald had gone in September 1963 to visit 
both the Cliban atid Soviet consolatos. Whether these 
facts are significaLt or merely coincidental, one can-
not tell. In retrospect, Cuban authorities � note with 
some relief that Oswald was denied permission to visit 
Cuba, implying that, had his request been granted, 
the finger of suspicion would surely have pointed at 
Havana. 
Perhaps more suggestive of a direct leak from AM-
LASH to Castro was the sequence of events on Sept. 7, 
1983, when the CIA re-established contact with the Cu-
ban conspirator for the first time since the preceding 
year. Late that evening, Prime Minister Castro called 
in Associated Press reporter Daniel Harker for an un-
expected interview. Only three Western reporters 
were based in Havana at the time and their contact 
with Castro was quite limited. Evidently, the Cuban 
leader had a message he wished to get on the record 
through Harker. He charged that the United States 
was aiding terrorist plots in Cuba and warned U.S. 
leaders that "if they are aiding terrorist plans to elimi-
nate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be safe." 
This threat of reprisals seems less inflammatory 
and more understandable now that we know what 
Castro knew at the time, namely, that the United 
States was in fact stepping up its covert operations 
against Cuba during the summer and fall of 1963. Yet 
it seems an exception to the main lines of Cuban pol-
icy as it was then evolving. 
For months afer the missile crisis of 1962, Castro 
had been displeased with the Soviets, and there are 
signs that he" was interested in an opening to Wash-
ington. On Sept. 5, the Cubans quietly proposed talks 
with the Americans at the United Nations, and Ken-
nedy soon responded with interest. Also, in early Sep-
tember the Time magazine bureau chief in Buenos 
Aires, Gavin Scott, travelling on a Canadian passport, 
spent two weeks in, Cuba. Although key U.S. officials 
have no recollection of consulting with Scott on that 
occasion, the Cubans recall his questions and com-
ments as hinting of American interest in a possible ac-
commodation, much as they were later to interpret. 
the discussions between Jean Daniel and Castro. 
Then and now the Cubans' attitude toward Ken-
nedy has been a compound of political antipathy and. 
personaladmiration. While critical of Kennedy's role 
in various counter-revolutionary efforts, Castro and, 
his associates voice a warm, almost affectionate re-
gard for the President's courage and realism. They 
profess to have seen his death as a grave setback to 
more hopeful relations between the two countries. 
The John Kennedy of 1963 was not, in their judgment, 
the same man who was inaugurated in 1961, but a 
more mature, poised and forward-looking leader with. 
whom they could have done business. 
With this frame of reference, Cuban officials specu-
late that the real origin of the assassination lies in an-
ti-Castro circles, with which Oswald also was in touch.' 
They emphasize that assassination is incompatible 
with their own revolutionary doctrine and that they 
never contemplated it even against Batista, the pre-
vious Cuban ruler. And they volunteer the suspicion 
that the recent murders of Sam Giancana and Johnny 
Rosselli, the Mafia figures who consorted with the 
CIA to kill Castro, surely have some connection with 
Cuban exile politics and the Kennedy murder. 
Castro has said publicly that he has no proof "count-, 
er-revolutionary elements" planned the assassination, 
but that is clearly the consensus in Havana. Further 
investigation may still be inconclusive, but, far from 
seeing it as an impediment to Cuban-American rela-
tions. the Castro regime welcomes such an inquiry. 
Their curiosity seems greater than their complicity.

By Henry S. Bradsher 
Washington Star Staff Writer 
The Ford administration has be-
come concerned about the extensive 
Soviet program for civil defense and 
� the lack of any comparable effort to 
protect the American people in case 
of intercontinental nuclear war. 
The first comprehensive official 
study of the large Soviet civil defense 
program to be made in many years 
is now under way at the CIA and 
elsewhere around town. A National 
Security Study Memorandum is 
being coordinated at the Pentagon 
� examining U.S. civil defense needs. 
The NSSM pulling together differ-
ent agencies" views in order to arrive 
at a top-level recommendation to the 
President, is due to be completed by 
� Sept. 30. It will provide the basis for 
a presidential decision whether to fit 
' an expansion of civil defense work 
into the 1978 fiscal year budget. 
But so far the interagency materi-
al focused on CIA work has not pro-
' duced a clear picture of the Soviet 
program. There is disagreement on 
: whether the preparations to protect 
the Soviet people from nuclear war 
by shelters or evacuation to the 
countryside which are described in 
Russian manuals are being carried 
out. 
THE SOVIET PROGRAM and U.S. 
� needs are connected by apprehen-
sions of some American military 
� analysts that an imbalance in civil 
defense programs would make this 
, country vulnerable. In a crisis situa-
tion, the Kremlin could threaten the 
American people with destruction 
� while sheltering its own people, thus 
reducing the U.S. ability to negotiate 
from equal strength, these analysts 
, warn. 
, But this contention that the mutual 
' deterrence "balance of terror" has 
been eroded is questioned by other 
analysts on two grounds. 
One is that a protected population 
could not long survive if its cities 
were destroyed and its air-and crops 
poisoned by fallout, so that protection 
from nuclear explosions might be 
meaningless in the medium or long 
term. The other involves whether the 
Soviet Union really can, or on the 
basis of present intentions will be-
come able to, protect its people from 
nuclear attack. 
U.S. policy during the 1950s was to 
try to protect cities against bomber 
attack, and the advent of interconti-
nental missiles led to the backyard 
air raid shelter boom in the early 
1960s. But by the middle '60s official 
doctrine switched under Secretary of 
' Defense Robert S. McNamara to an 
assumption that cities were indefen-
sible in the missile era, and therefore 
the best defense was the assured 
ability to retaliate. , 
THIS ADOPTION -of the mutual 
deterrence doctrine led to the 1972 
Soviet-American treaty banning 
antiballistic missile systems for the 
defense of cities. Populations were to 
be left exposed, hostages to the other 
side's retaliatory power. � 
Although the treaty permits re-
search, the United States has cut 
back on ABM efforts. There are indi-
cations that the Soviet Union is con-
tinuing an extensive, expensive re-
search program seeking a technical 
breakthrough to a reliable ABM sys-
tem. This causes worries in some 
official quarters here that the Krem-
lin might some day suddenly face 
this country with an ability to shield 
Soviet cities from missile attack 
which the United States could not 
quickly match. 
"If that happens, they can pick up - 
all the marbles and go home, be-
cause we would be at their mercy," 
one defense expert commented. 
The more immediate concern, 
which the administration has come to, 
feel might be more real, however, is 
over civil defense. The United States 
has virtually abandoned any effort. 
But since the 1972 ABM treaty the 
Soviets have vastly expanded theirs 
� on paper, definitely, and possibly 
in shelters, evacuation schemes and 
training, too. 
A LEADING AMERICAN EX- . 
PERT on the Soviet "war-survival 
program," Dr. Leon Goure of the 
University of Miami, says that "the 
Soviet leadership has come to view 
civil defense as a critical 'strategic 
factor' which, in a large measure, 
can determine the course and out-
,come of a nuclear war." Goure sees 
in recent years "a new sense of ur-
gency and of realism" in the Soviet 
program, as well as an awareness of 
U.S. vulnerability to attack. 
A special panel of the House 
Armed Services Committee held 
hearings in February and March on 
the two superpowers' civil defense 
efforts. Goure and other specialists 
described a very real Soviet pro-
gram. The hearings resulted in a 
token increase in money for the 
standby .Defense Civil Preparedness 
Agency in the Pentagon. 
The evidence that Goure and 
others have amassed of Soviet 
preparations has contributed to 
warnings of a dangerous imbalance. 
One, administration critic, Paul H. 
Nitze, a former deputy secretary of 
defense, thinks these preparations 
have had the same destabilizing ef-
fects as ABMs would have. 
BUT SOME ANALYSTS QUES-
TION the findings of people like 
Goure on which such warnings are 
based. A recent study by John M. 
Collins of the Library of Congress's 
Congressional Research Service said 
Soviet plans "are impressive on 
paper (but) how practical they would 
be in practice is problematical." Col-
lins thought "no U.S. authority as yet 
has satisfactorily answered hard 
questions" about the Soviet program. 
One senior administration official 
handling arms control negotiations 
says U. S. Embassy personnel in the 
Soviet Union and travelers have fail-
ed to see the kind of evidence that 
would be expectable if the paper pro-
gram really existed as workable civil 
defense protection. A government 
expert on Soviet affairs reports a 
widespread suspicion that little more 
has been done than earmark re-
sources. 
The main realization which had de-
veloped in the administration by last 
spring as a result of publicity like the 
House hearings was that not enough 
was known about Soviet civil defense 
efforts. The CIA had not taken a seri-
ous look at the subject for more than 
five years � since before the post-
ABM treaty program expansion that 
Goure detected. 
SO A MULTIAGENCY STUDY 
was commissioned. It should have 
been finished two months ago. In-
'stead, each draft report had pro-
duced new doubts about the reliabil-
ity of available material. 
."The basic problem is that we just 
haven't been putting enough re-
sources on this," an informed 
observer commented. "It should be 
possible for the U.S. intelligence 
community to determine whether. 
Soviet shelters and evacuation plant 
and all that really do exist, but the 
subject hav't been getting enough 
attention so Tar." 
The National Security Study 
Memorandum was ordered by the 
White House after the study of Soviet 
efforts had begun. It is being coordi-
nated in the office of Donald R. Cot-
ter, an assistant to Secretary of De-
fense Donald Rumsfeld for atomic 
energy affairs. 
An administration official said the 
NSSM was the result of accumulat-
ing concern about the U.S. civil 
defense posture rather than any 
specific alarm over what the Soviets 
might be doing. 
But even if a gap is found and a 
threatening imbalance discerned, the 
chances of organizing an effective 
civil defense program in this country 
in anything less than an all-out war 
situation are considered small by 
some informed officials. Therefore, 
the realistic options open to Cotter's 
study team stop somewhere short of 
the kind of program which Soviet lit-
erature describes.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, MONLiAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1976' 
The United States, contrary to pop-
ular mythology, has never been an 
isolationist country. Almost as soon as 
� we became a nation we became inter-
ventionist. 
The United States used its armed 
forces abroad 159 times between 1798 
and 1945; of these, 73 were initiated 
under prior legislative authority, 
without a declaration of war. Even 
between World Wars I and II�said 
to be the heyday of isolationism�we 
engaged in 19 military actions outside 
the Western Hemisphere. Since World 
War II we have used military forces 
in Korea, Indochina, Lebanon, the 
Dominican Republic and the Congo. 
What all this ledicates is that since 
-its inception the United States has 
been unafraid to exercise power in 
world affairs. 
There is every reason to believe that 
military intervention will continue, 
-and, indeed, that it may even intensify. 
�There are a number of indications that 
'we may find ourselves committed to 
policies that go beyond the diplomatic, 
�economic or covert forms of interven-
tion we have practiced in the distant 
and near past. One indicator is a poll 
recently taken by Potomac Associates 
that points to a growing tendency for 
Americans to think in unilateral terms. 
The very fact that United States con-
trol the Panama Canal should have 
been a major issue in the Presidential 
primaries this year demonstrates that 
' nationalistic impulses have by no 
-:means been quelled. Thus, if there is 
a disposition to intervene, the reasons 
are not likely to be those we are most 
'familiar with, such as a desire to con-
tain the expansion of Communism on 
a global scale. In this respect, Vietnam 
may well have proved an end game-:-
the cold war is already history. Our 
responses will be different because the 
international system is different. What 
we appear to be entering is a period of 
relative disorder, with a greater degree 
_ of interdependence among nations; 
s this could lead to greater tensions and 
more, rather than less, interference by 
one nation into the affairs of another. 
From an American perspective, mili-
tary intervention might be most readily 
occasioned by our fears of resource 
, scarcity. As regards our dependence 
on foreign oil, for example, in 1975

States were 36 percent of its total 
consumption. In 1970 they were 22 
percent and by 1980, according to esti-
mates of the United States Bureau of 
Mines, the United States will probably 
be buying up to 41 percent of its petro-
leum abroad. In a situation of per-
ceived resource scarcity, intervention 
could easily become a demand by the 
Congress rather than an assertion of 
executive will. 
- Another reason for intervention 
could be to preserve America's sphere 
of influence in the Caribbean. Cuba 
remains resistant to United States 
dominance, as was most recently evi-
dent in the Cuban military presence in 
Angola directed against� the United 
States-backed liberation movements. 
Mexico has already demonstrated its 
solidarity with third-world blocs un-
sympathetic to United States policy. 
Panama will not be satisfied with the 
status quo. In the Caribbean and 
Central America � deemed by most 
Americans as essential to United 
States security � the possibiilty of 
intervention is never far from mind. 
A third reason for American inter-
vention would be to affect regional 
balances of power. In Northeast Asia, 
for example, an embryonic regional 
balance comprising Japan, China, the 
Soviet Union, the two Koreas and the 
United States is already in place. The 
very concept of regional balances of 
power also demands a willingness of 
the great powers to intervene to pre-
vent the balance from being upset. It 
is for this reason among others that 
any outbreak in hostilities between the 
two Koreas is threatening. There are 
also at least hints of a balance in South 
Asia. Unwilling to put itself in the 
position of being a Soviet client, India 
wants recognition as a power in its 
own right. Moscow and Peking seem 
disposed to grant India its wish. And 
the United States, far from abandoning 
the region, is planning an increased 
naval presence in the Indian Ocean. 
In other areas no such balances as 
yet exist. 'However, nations such as 
Brazil and Iran have already shown a 
drive for dominance in their regions. 
Should such nations embark on an 
aggressive course, the very fabric of 
interdependencies being created both 
in the region and globally could be 
ripped apart. In sueh a situation, the 
United States might find intervention 
�either alone or in concert with 
others--desirable in order to tame the 
dangerously expanding power. 
� Finally, there is often a felt need for 
great powers to demonstrate their 
global concerns. For the United States, 
these would probably include a con-
cern for human rights and the espousal 
of liberal, pluralistic democracies. 
Realizing that the United States is a 
worldwide power with social, eco-
nomic and ideological interests, Ameri-
cans may accept intervention in the 
manner of other great powers of the 
past by -pursuing activist policies. The 
evidence is on the side of the activists. 
A recent Harris poll showed that 
� support for an activist foreign policy 
has hardly changed since 1947. 
Does global power, then, lead to 
intervention? History suggests that it 
does. An anarchic world with shifting 
coalitions and overlapping alliances 
certainly does not diminish the likeli-
hood. And if wars of attrition and 
massive nuclear exchanges are im-
probable, the so-called decisive stroke 
of intervention could seem most ap-
pealing. Such interventionism will 
often be wrong and almost always will 
be dangerous. Yet there seems to be a 
certain inevitability to it. The 17th-
century philosopher Thomas Hobbes 
was -right when he perceived as "a 
generall inclination of all mankind, a 
perpetuall and restless desire of Power 
after power that ceaseth only in 
death."

By B. BRUCE�BRIGGS 
The charge that America has imperi� 
allstic ambitions is hard to believe these 
days, but the truth of the matter is that the 
U.S. does have a colonial problem, and not 
just in Panama and Puerto Rico either. ' 
We don't like to think of ourselves as a 
colonial power and since we led the way by 
granting independence to the Philippines in 
(1946 we have actively promoted decoloni-
zation. But as the tide of European empire 
has receded, the American empire has re-
mained intact. With the exception of the 
ending of U.S. occupation of the Japanese 
Ryukyu and Bonin Islands, the Stars and 
Stripes are planted as widely now as they 
were lin years ago. 
Most of the inhabitants of our overseas 
s Col ial 
possessions share our dislike for the term 
"colony,' so the official designation is 
"outlying territory." But euphemism can-
not modify the fact that three million peo-
ple live on 5.000 square miles of American 
territory, governed by U.S. laws and with 
no say in the making of these laws either 
through voting for the President or mem-
bers of Congress. What to do with these 
people Is a continuing annoyance both to 
Congress and the Executive Branch. 
Not that the colonies want to be free. 
Far from it, Most of then, wish to retain 
the status and rights of American national-
ity, hot to mention the protection of the 
U.S. military. They want U.S. government 
programs but don't want to pay U.S. taxes. 
In short, they share the great American

ches 
dream of something for nothing. 
Take our largest and most important 
colony -Puerto Rico, the only one which 
could conceivably be a real independent 
country. It has a minuscule independent 
movement, so lacking In popular support 
that it must resort to terrorism to be no-
ticed. The principal issue on the island is 
whether to join the union or to continue the 
"Free Associated State" status evolved 
over the years. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citi-
zens, the island is internally self-governing 
(by an act of the U.S. Congress), islanders 
pay no U.S. income taxes )"no taxation 
without representation") but are subject to 
U.S. laws. 
The U.S. denies that Puerto Rico is a 
colony and refuses to let the United Na-
tions Select Committee on Decolonization 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
meddle in its affairs. But it is continually 
harassed on the issue by Cuba, backed by 
� the socialist dictatorships of Syria, Iraq, 
Mali and Congo (Brazzaville). Several 
times Puerto Rico has voted overwhelm-
ingly in plebiscites to continue the existing 
status. Presidents and Congressmen have 
indicated American willingness to let the 
island go any time it so desires, yet techni-
cally the Cubans are right: Puerto Rico is 
not a self-governing nation. 
The Economic Benefits 
Not that the Puerto Ricans particularly 
care. The recent Ad Hoc Advisory Group 
on the Status of Puerto Rico slighted con-
stitutional issues and decided to concen-
trate on preparing a menu of economic 
benefits for approval by the U.S. Congress. 
Two of the status revisions �changing the 
nominal designation an Spanish) of Puerto 
Rico from a "Commonwealth" to a "Free 
Associated State" and the admission of a 
non-voting resident commissioner to the 
U.S.�  Senate �seem reasonable, but the 
suggestion that federal courts use the 
Spanish language is impFactical. Puerto 
Rico's desire to have some say in control-
ling immigration�to keep out those ag-
gressive, successful Cuban refugees, for 
one thing�hasn't a chance of approval by 
Congress. And even Puerto Rico's staun-
chest friends are appalled by the recom-
mendations that the island be exempt from 
U.S. minimum wage and labor relations 
laws, not to mention the idea that the is-
land government have the right to decide 
which federal legislation will apply to 
Puerto Rico. 
Of course, the Puerto Ricans want full 
I, federal welfare benefits. Although the 
commonwealth is one of the richest coun-
tries in the Western Hemisphere, its per, 
capita income is less than half that of the 
mainland, so federal eligibility standards 
entitle much of the population to benefits. 
Fifty-five percent are on food stamps. 
. Guam, Samoa and the Virgin Islands 
are held by the U.S. to be "non self-govern-
ing territories" liable to supervision by the 
UN. Each is evolving in the Puerto Rican 
direction, but not without considerable 
pother. Guam and the Virgins have re-
cently obtained the privilege of electing' 
� their governors and non-voting delegates to 
the House. Samoa also was apparently 
pressured by the Interior Department into 
electing its own governor. Bills are before 
Congress to allow Guam and the Virgins to 
have conventions to write territorial consti-
tutions. Because of the collapse of Virgin 
Islands tourism, its only major business, 
during the recent recession, that territory 
" is asking for an outright grant of $8.5 mil-
lion and the pledge of the "full faith and 
credit" of the U.S. in support of a $60 mil-
lion bond issue. 
Apart from the tourism in Puerto Rico 
and the Virgin Islands, none of the above 
colonies is of much economic benefit to the 
U.S. But the Panama Canal Zone is an-
other matter. The economic value of the 
canal, especially with a toll schedule un-
changed since 1914, is enormous. But we 
are more accustomed to think of the canal 
in military terms. 
Even though it cannot handle super-car-
riers, the strategic utility of the canal con-
tinues to be so immense that the United 
States is understandably loath to knuckle 
under to demands by the Panamanian Re-
public for the liquidation of the Canal Zone 
and eventual transfer of the U.S. govern-
ment-owned Panama Canal Co. to Pana-
manian ownership. The Hay-Varilla Treaty 
0( 11103 provided that the U.S. shall hold "in 
perpetuity the use, occupancy and control" 
of the 'zone "as if it were sovereign," The 
U.S. is not sovereign, but how its rights dif-
fer from sovereignty is a matter perhaps 
better lett to theologians. 
As the tide of European 
empire has receded, the 
American ern* has re-
mained intact. But not 
without a continuous stream 
of problems. 
The present Panamanian regime Is rela-
tively responsible and pro-American by 
Central American standards, but given the 
vagaries of Caribbean politics, we would 
be foolish to take continued stability and 
friendship for granted. The Panama Canal 
is precious and we have every right in law 
to possess it forever, so what's the prob-
lem? First, continued occupation of the 
zone hurts our relations with Latin Ameri-
can nations who see it as evidence of Yan-
kee imperialism. For example, the presi-
dent of Venezuela took the occasion of an 
otherwise affectionate Bicentennial mes-
sage to knock our "colonial enclave." 
Complaints by Latin American coun-
tries we can easily bear, but advocates of 
substantial concessions to Panarna have an 
uglier scenario in mind --that the present 
Panamanian regime will be replacsd with 
one that will tolerate or promote terrorism 
or guerrilla warfare against the zone. So 
the Panama issue boils down to these ques-
tions: Is continued possession of the zone 
worth the risk of "another Vietnam"? Can 
the U.S. stand up to such a threat? The 
reader is as qualified to answer as any-
body. 
Our other colonial enclave in the Carib-
bean is quiet. The Naval base at Cuba's 
Guantanamo Bay is nice to have, but 
hardly necessary to national defense. But 
giving-it up would be seen as knuckling un-
der to Castro. Fortunately, Cuba is making 
no effort to pressure us out, perhaps be-
cause of the rumored secret treaty which 
ended the missile crisis of 1962. 
No foreign nations are meddling with 
our Pacific possessions. Our oldest colonies 
are a miscellaneous collection of islands 
gathered in consequence of the Guano Act 
of 1856; the miners scooped up the guano 
faster than the birds could lay it down and 
now these islands are unoccupied and 
worthless. Midway and Wake are military 
bases with no indigenous population and 
are no problem. Guam is also primarily a 
military base and its inhabitants are 
firmly connected to the U.S. But there is 
turmoil elsewhere in the Central Pacific, 
The U.S. controls something called "Micro-
nesia," the last remaining United Nations 
trust territory. Its 100,000 inhabitants are 
'not U.S. nationals and are subject to direct 
U.S. rule, supervised by the UN. 
We have been trying to develop Micro-
nesia as a unit, but the natives who live on 
100 islands scattered over an expanse of 
ocean larger than the United States have 
nothing in common save a history of being 
ruled successively by Spain, Germany, 
Japan and the U.S. Micronesia is coming 
apart. The Northern Marianhs have al-
ready indicated their intention of becoming 
a "commonwealth." with U.S. citizenship. 
but separatist movements against contin-
ued membership in Micronesia are afoot in 
other island groups. For the U.S. it's 
hardly worth the bother. We have a missile 
station at Kwajalein; Japanese interests 
are Investigating possibilities of an oil port 
at Palau, and there is a little copra produc-
tion and fishing -and that's all. 
The Pentagon's Attitude 
Obviously, very few Americans are, 
aware of the extent of our possessions. The 
Pentagon is concerned with those few spots 
that are of strategic importance, taking the 
position that the interests of the indigenous 
peoples are to be subordinated. to the mili-
tary requirements of the U.S. Where the 
military rules directly �as on Wake, Mid-
way, Guantanamo and the Canal Zone �the 
milieu is that of a military base, benign 
but total control. The cavalier attitude to-
ward the natives is .best 'exemplified by 
Guam where the Navy grabbed'up much of 
the best land on the eve of the granting of 
U.S. citizenship and rights to the islanders. 
This is a continuing, grievance to the 
Guamians. 
Surprisingly. the major civilian players 
in the colonial game are a tiny band of old-
style liberals. Micronesia has been repre-
sented by Clark Clifford's law firm and for-
mer Supreme Court Justice- Abe Fortas 
has a continuing involvement with Puerto 
Rico. The maritime lobby is also active. 
Its principal interest is maintenance of the 
Jones Act, requiring that shipping between 
U.S. ports be in U.S. registry bottoms. This 
is very costly for our overseas possessions, 
especially Guam, which has one of the high-
est costs of living in the world. 
' Also on the scene is a tiny band of anti-' 
colonialists whose views are shaped by the 
"new politics" of the 1960s, They dislike the 
military and strategic arguments mean 
nothing to them. In every overseas com-
mitment they see another potential Viet-
nam. And they are hostile, to the indigenous 
peoples who wish to be Americans, charac-
terizing them as suckers or tools of U.S. in-
terests. Apparently this small group of re-
searchers, politicians and editorial writers 
is unable to comprehend what a precious 
boon U.S. citizenship is to the ordinary peo-
ple of the world. 
Should the rest of us care about our col-
onies?. Excepting the Panama Canal, they 
are of little economic value and require a 
continual drain on the U.S. Treasury to 
provide them with government services.. 
But the shuffle of history has dealt these 
poor and weak peoples into our hands. We 
are responsible for them. The optimum 
policy probably should be to accede to any 
reasonable demand they make on us. 
If they wish to be independent, god-
:speed. If Puerto Rico desires statehood, 
welcome. For the rest, we will have to con-
tinue to work toward some intermediate 
status of internal self-government under 
U.S. national law that unfriendly critics 
will always be able to label "colonialism."

Taiwan's A-bomb..,. 
�, The American intelligence report that Taiwan clan-
destinely has built a reprocessing facility that is ex-
Iracting weapons-grade plutonium explosive from spent 
nuclear reactor fuel rods demands immediate investiga-
tion by the appropriate Congressional committees. Tai-
wan's denials have not impressed Washington insiders. 
If the Chinese Nationalists have set out to make 
atomic bombs in the first known violation of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)�and have succeeded in 
deceiving the inspection system of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency�a profound reappraisal will be 
needed for Washington's China policy, its nonprolifera-
tion strategy and its nuclear export controls. 
. Under the 100-nation NPT, Taiwan and other non-
nuclear weapons states renounced atomic explosives and 
committed themselves to place all their nuclear facilities 
and materials under I.A.E.A. "safeguards"---a system of 
international inspection. The main supplier countries, 
in addition, later agreed that the export of fissionable 
materials or key nuclear facility components would be 
indicated to the I.A.E.A. to trigger safeguards. 
If this system has been circumvented by Taiwan or 
.ignOred by some supplier countries, may not other NPT 
parties �be evading controls as well? Speedy action to 
beef up �and improve I.A.E.A. inspection and supplier 
controls clearly is vital. 
The effort to avoid nuclear spread has focused recently 
on tightened up export controls by the main supplier 
countries, but the United States has failed in the most 
important task: to obtain the agreement of West Ger-
many and France to an embargo on export of reprocess-
ing plants in the wake of their sales of such plants to 
Brazil and Pakistan last year, claiming that I.A.E.A. safe-
guards make such sales "safe." 
The Taiwan fiasco blows up that French-German 
thesis. It reinforces Congressional arguments for legis-
lation that would call on the President to deny American 
nuclear materials ultimately to supplier as well as re-
cipient nations that could not be prevailed upon to coop-
erate in halting the spread of plutonium reprocessing. 
That vital legislation is currently bogged down in the 
Joint Atomic Energy Committee. A belated White House 
study Of the problem, due for release this week, will be 
an exercise in futility unless it helps break this log-jam.

Administration, after refusing since 1969 to sell Taiwan 
a reprocessing plant, did not react more vigorously 
against Taiwan's open importation and assembly of the 
components for a "hot cell" for small-scale plutonium 
reprocessing. That so-called "laboratory project," which 
Taipei put under I.A.E.A. inspection, may simply have 
been a cover for the assembly of a clandestine facility. 
. American Guarantee 
Taiwan's presumed nuclear violation brings into ques-
tion the American security guarantee. That guarantee, as 
in the case of Japan and South Korea, is designed to 
provide an American nuclear umbrella in place of na-
tional acquisition of atomic weapons. 
' The United States unfortunately has undermined its 
security guarantee by talk in Washington and among 
, China experts of "normalization" of relations with 
, Peking�without first solving the problem of the secur-
ity of Taiwan. Normalization, Peking insists, requires the 
United States to terminate its security treaty as well as 
its diplomatic relations with Taiwan. 
But normalization of relations with Peking is incon-
ceivable without stabilization of the Taiwan situation by, 
at the least, a replacement of the mutual security treaty 
with a unilateral American guarantee of Taiwan's auton-
omy and continued supply of arms for Taiwan's defense 
forces. Renunciation of nuclear weapons is the irreduc-
ible condition for that guarantee. 
This Taiwan-American transaction is in Peking's in-
terest. Although Communist China has denounced the 
Nonproliferation Treaty as an imperialist device, Peking's 
interest in a nonnuclear Taiwan is great. 
Taiwan has continued to remain a legal party to the 
� Nonproliferation Treaty and to accept I.A.E.A. inspection, 
despite its unfortunate expulsion by third world ven-
detta from the I.A.E.A. in 1972. That expulsion does not 
justify Taiwan's clandestine evasion of its commitments 
�to the I.A.E.A., to the United States and to 98 other 
NPT countries�to refrain from nuclear explosives. But 
the partial responsibility of Peking and the third world 
for the present situation should give Washington some 
moral leverage in working out a reasonable solution, one 
that makes the security of an autonomous non-nuclear

relations with Peking.

U.S. Vi lated Poky 
For Cro San Terrorists 
By Henry S. Bradsher 
"t) Washington Star Staff Writer 
In the aftermath of last week's Croatian nation-
alist hijacking, the State Department has reiterat-
ed administration policy of not making any con-
cessions to terrorists but conceded that the FBI 
: violated that policy. 
The State Department has in turn been identi-
� fled by another agency involved in the weekend 
:drama, the Federal' Aviation Administration, as 
'having been involved in making concessions. 
The FBI urged some American newspapers to 
satisfy the five terrorists' demands for publicity 
for their cause. The five, who sought independence 
of Croatia from Yugoslavia, released their 92 hos-
tages and surrendered in Paris and are now 
. awaiting trial in New York. 
� The FAA played a role in the dropping of terror-
ists' leaflets from an American plane on London 
and Paris to publicize the Croatian cause. It also 
:cleared a flight to drop leaflets over Chicago in 
� They were not *asking the release off lel-
-low terrorists in Israeli and in other jails. 
What then can officialdom, here and 
7 abroad, learn from the latest episode in 
the complex, constantly changing, and 
too frequently tragic history of aerial hi-
jacking? 
�The dominant view among aviation ex., 
pests at the moment is that there is noth-
ing wrong in an officially proclaimed and 
normally implemented policy of tough-
ness with hijackers. Anything less would 
only encourage other criminals. 
But it is counterproductive to adopt 
too rigid a stand, many believe. A rigid 
"we will not negotiate" stand can be 
misinterpreted by middle-level officials to 
mean "we will not talk." Even a policy 
of "we will not make concessions" should 
not be absolute�how do you define "con-
cessions"? Is the dropping of leaflets the 
kind of concession that warrants risking 
dozens of lives? 
Each on Own Merits 
In short, the majority view is that the 
government should talk and usually act 
though but, at the same time, should treat 
each case on its own merits at the time. 
That is the way, in the final analysis, 
that the weekend T.W.A. hijacking was 
handled. Even while a strict reading of 
Secretary of State Kissinger's "we will 
not negitiate" posture was slowing steps 
overseas -to gain the release of the 
plane's passengers and crew, other 
branches of the government were experi-
encing no such rigidities. 
Both the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion and the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, for instance, were urging news-
papers to comply with the hijackers' de-; 
mands for printing the text of their mani-
festo for Croatian Independence from 
Yugoslavia. 
The policy favoring toughness with 
flexibility was endorsed by a spokesman 
for the West German United Nations 
delegation, which plans to propose new 
measures against taking hostages when 
the General Assembly meets later this 
month. 
"In general, you should take a hard 
line," he said. "But don't say 'never.' You

By Eric Bourne 
Special correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Vienna 
Yugoslav relations with the United 
States have taken a nosedive as a result 
of the hijack of an American airliner by 
Croatian extremists. 
It is difficult to recall any time since 
the early 1950s when official Yugoslav 
� attitudes have adopted so harsh a line-
against the U.S. 
� There have been periodic mutual up-
sets since Belgrade's break with Stalin 
opened the door to increasingly friendly 
relations with the U.S. and the West in 
general, but these were rarely long-last-
ing, and they did not approach the level 
of the current sharp reaction. 
Now Yugoslavia has gone so far as to 
accuse the U.S. of tacit support for the 
1. hijackers, a charge that a U.S. Embassy 
spokesman in Belgrade rejected as to-
tally without foundation. 
Surpise voiced 
Western diplomats who have sympa-
thized with Yugoslav feelings about the 
' apparently unrestricted activities of ex-
treme emigre groups in Western coun-
tries, were surprised by the� uncompro-
mising nature of Belgrade's protest. 
It is not .the first time the Yugoslav 
Government has accused "influential re-
actionary circles" in America of hostil-
ity to Yugoslavia because ol its nonalign-
ment.

Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Moscow 
A new setback for detente between Moscow 
'.and � Washington ... the worst diplomatic clash 
between Moscow and Tokyo for years ... and 
an indication of how deeply the Soviets have 
been upset by three highly publicized defec.' 
tions in recent months. 
This is how Western analysts in Moscow sum 
up the Soviet Union's long, angry blast of criti-
cism at both Tokyo and Washington over the 
supersecret MIG-25 jet fighter-bomber still in 
Japanese hands: 
The criticism intensified Sept. 15. A Tass 
commentator, noting reports from Tokyo that 
the MIG-25 was to be flown by a C-5 Galaxy 
transport aircraft to a military base where it is 
to be "carefully studied," said that Japan's po-
sition continued to be "unfriendly" toward the 
Soviet Union. 
This attitude, commentator Viktor Zatsepin 
said, was "clearly undertaken with the in-
stigation and support of a third side," and 
showed that Japan was disregarding inter-
national law and worsening Soviet-Japanese re-
lations. 
(This follows on the heels of a Sept. 14 warn-
Six weeks ago, President Tito com-
plaining of outside "pressures,"' named 
U.S. Ambassador in Belgrade Laurence 
H. Silberman as the "initiator" of an 
anti-Yugoslav campaign. The charge 
arose from the imprisonment of an 
American citizen and the Embassy's 
successful efforts to secure his release. 
Escalation 
In this atmosphere, angry Yugoslav 
reactions to the Croat hijack were pre-
dictable. The present protest, however, 
goes well beyond the Yugoslav leader's 
criticisms of an ambassador involved in 
a single individual case. 
The indictment leveled at the U.S. in-
cluded a scarcely veiled threat that 
"normal relations" are incompatible 
with the circumstances surrounding the 
Sept. 16 hijacking. 
But, before judgment is passed on the 
affair and positions harden, the Yugos-
lav reaction needs to be seen against the 
current political background in that 
country. 
Yugoslav leaders and people generally 
are only too well aware that the end of 
an era of assured stability is nearing. 
Rivalries ease 
The leaders who will take over when 
President Tito is no longer at the helm 
express confidence that the transition 
has been secured by establishment of a 
collective presidency. 
30 
ver Uaddng 
Talks this correspondent had in all the 
Yugoslav republics this summer, with lo-
cal leaders as well as ordinary folk, re-
vealed that -the rivalries and tensions 
that flared between various national 
groups in the early 1970s have abated. 
Republican equality has become a sub-
stantive thing. 
Nonetheless, anxiety for the post-Tito 
future helps to make Belgrade doubly 
sensitive to anything smacking of "inter-
ference" or hostility, or tolerance of its. 
extreme adversaries abroad. 
Extremist activity 
Extremist Croatian emigre groups 
have, in recent years: 
� Infiltrated a band of' 19 terrorists 
into Yugoslavia. They killed 13 security 
troops before being slain or captured 
themselves. 
� Murdered Yugoslav diplomats in 
West Germany and Sweden. 
- Bombed a Yugoslav train. 
� Blew up a Yugoslav airliner over 
Czechoslovakia. 
� Made a bomb attempt against Pres-
ident Tito only a few months-ago. 
These groups are largely remnants, or 
sons, of the notorious Ustasha who 
headed a Croat puppet regime under 
Nazi occupation in World War II and 
carried out widespread massacres of the 
Serb minority there. 
In the Yugoslav view they are not or-
dinary political dissidents and should not 
be regarded as such. 
ing to Japan that if Tokyo 'pursued its claim to 
four Soviet-held Pacific islands it could only 
"poison the spirit of good-neighborliness" be-
tween the two countries. 
(Soviet authorities seized a Japanese fishing 
boat with a crew of six Sept. 12 just a few 
hours before then Japanese Foreign Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa made an inspection trip of the 
four islands from a patrol boat.) 
Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko flew the jet, said 
-.to be the fastest of its type in the world, to 
_Hakodate in northern Japan Sept. 6. The Japa-
nese press reported that he told authorities he 
had wanted to fly directly to the United States, 
but lacked the fuel. President Ford decided 
that the pilot could have political asylum in the 
U.S. if he wanted. Lieutenant Belenko asked 
for it and is now thought to be in California. 
Moscow does not want its prize aircraft on 
Japanese soil a moment longer. It knows that 
U.S. and other Western military intelligence 
experts have long wanted to take a close look 
at it � a point raised by Tass. Analysts here 
say tnat Moscow's. latest harsh criticism is in-
tended to hector Tokyo into giving the jet back 
before this Can happen. 
Judging by the reaction of the Japanese For-
eign Ministry in Tokyo, the Soviet gambit 
might fail. A ministry spokesman said Lieuten-
ant Belenko sought asylum of his own free will. 
Previously Japanese officials had said that Ja-
pan would return the jet, but only after it had 
made an inspection to determine if Leutenant 
Belenko had broken any laws in entering Japa-
nese air space. Privately, Japanese officials 
reject the Soviet version.

The Soviets have been using strong language 
in private exchanges since the plane landed. 
On the night of Sept. 14 Tass distributed a 
lengthy statement that gave the Soviet version 
of the affair, said the plane had become lost, 
condemned Japan for allowing the U.S. to en-

DIM'S PENETR6ATION 
WORRYING TO JAPAN 
Ability of Soviet Aircraft to Fly 
- Under Radar Is Said to Show 
Country's Weak Defenses 
By DREW MIDDLETON . 
� The undetected final approach of the 
vagrant Soviet MIG-25 to Japan has 
brought home to Government circles in 
Tokyo the loopholes in the country's air 
'defense, according to United States de-
:tense sources. 
The first analysis on the high-speed, 
high-altitude aircraft, known to the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization as the Fox-
hal; has heightened Western concern over 
the regular reconnaissance flights by 
other MIG-25's over West Germany, 
France, the Netherlands, Belgium and 
Norway. According to NATO intelligence 
reports, there are 45 Foxbats in East Ger-
many and Poland employed on such pa-
trols. 
The landing of the MIG-25 at the corn-
mer airport of Hakodate, on Hokkaido 
Island on Sept. 6, supported the American 
�argument, hitherto rejected by the Japa-
nese, that their radar system was obso-
lete. 
The detection of hostile aircraft ap-
proaching the Japanese islands rests on 
28 warning and control units of a base 
defense system. Successive Japanese Gov-
ernments have considered modernization 
of the system in view of regular Soviet 
'reconnaissance flights over the archipela-
go by MIG-25s and other aircraft. 
� Jets Ordered to Intercept I 
Air defense radars picked up the Saviet 
'aircraft short! after 1 P M  j 
July 27. In each case Moscow has reacted in 
strong statements, and with each defection its 
irritation has grown. 
The MIG-25 statement says Lieutenant Be-
lenko lost his bearings and landed in Japan be-
cause�he lacked the fuel to get home.. Tokyo 
then isolated hiM, "which gives grounds for be-
lieving that various methods were used to in-
fluence him." 
The Soviets say Tokyo refused permission 
for Soviet officials to see the flyer for almost 
four days. The Japanese spokesman in Tokyo 
said Japanese officials had, in fact, persuaded. 
Lieutenant Belenko to see Soviet officials al-

time and �two Japanese Air Force F-4's 
were ordered to intercept. The Foxbat, 
flown by Lieut. Victor I. Belenko, did net 
'answer 'Japanese requests for identifica-
tion. 
Shortly aftet the MIG-25 entered Japa-
;nese air space it dropped from 13,000 
.feet to a low altitude and -disappeared 
from Japanese radar screens.. In conse-
quence, the ground control stations were 
unable to direct the two F-4's toward 
their target. 
Hakodate was Lieutenant Belenko's 
second choice. His first was the Japanese 
Air Force base at Chitose, which was cov-
eted by clouds. He, then flew to Hakodate. 
According to Japanese information 
reaching this country, Soviet aircraft ap-
peared in the area of Hakodate five hours 
after the MIG-25 had touched down. Since 
then, the Soviet Union's Far East air force 
has maintained regular patrols in the 
area. And Soviet -diplomats in Tokyo have 
demanded the immediate return of the 
aircraft. 
'Lieutenant Belenko left the Soviet air 
base at Sakharovka in Siberia on the 
morning Of Sept. 6 in a flight of three 
MIG-25. Shortly after takeoff he broke 
away from the squadron and dropped to 
about 150 feet to escape Soviet radar. 
After he was out Of the rauge of the 
Soviet radar, Lieutenant Belenko took his 
plane up to 18,000 feet. and headed for 
'Japan. � ; 
It was a near thing. The MIG-25 landed
with about 95 percent of its fuel exhaust-
ed. The plane, according to British intelli-
gence cources, has a normal range of 
about 610 nautical miles but this can be 
increased by reducing use of Tumansky.

: The initial analysis of the MIG-25 by 
Japanese and United States experts con-
centrated on the avionics system, the 
lookdown radar and the metals used to 
sheath the high-speed aircraft. American, 
aeronautical sources believe that either 
titanium or boron are used for the fuse-
lage and wings. 
It is not now known whether the air-, 
craft carried electronic countermeasures.

� TOKYO (UPI).� Japan will ask American mili-
tary experts to help dismantle and examine a 
Soviet MIG25 fighter plane flown here by a defect-
log Russian pilot a week ago, according to Michita 
Sakata, defense administrator. 
Sakata, director-general of the defense agency, 
I told reporters yesterday it would be difficult for 
'- Japanese experts alone to make a thorough study 
of the plane, one of the world's most advanced air-
craft. 
Technical assistance from the United States is 
necessary to dismantle the MIG25 and examine 
,secret equipment on board, Sakata said. 
Defense agency officials added, however, that 
U.S. help would be sought on an "unofficial basis" 
, to avoid further straining of relations between 
Japan and the Soviet Union. 
THE PLANE, REGARDED by Western military 
� experts as an intelligence windfall, was flown to 
Japan last Monday by Soviet Air Force Lt. Viktor 
Belenko. Belenko, 29, who said he wanted to defect 
to the United States, was flown to California last 
Thursday after the U.S. government granted him 
asylum. 
The high-flying fighter � known by the NATO 
code name of Foxbat � was described in 1973 by 
� then U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Robert Sea-
mans as "probably the best interceptor in produc-
tion in the world today."

Moscow (AP) � A Soviet journal ac-
cused "Canadian intelligence" yesterday 
of engineering the defection in Montreal 
of Sergei Nemtsanov, the 17-year-old di-
ver who left his Olympic team during the 
'Summer Games. 
In linking a Canadian government 
agency with the case, Literary Gazette 
thus expanded earlier Soviet accusations 
,that the young diver was forced against 
his will to defect July 29. 
Nemtsanov later announced he wanted 
to return to his homeland, and was sent 
-back to the Soviet Union. According to a 
�newspaper article here last week, he had 
-resumed training in Kazakhstan. and is-
sued a statement saying he had never 
twanted to defect. 
Literary Gazette, the weekly organ of 
the Soviet Writer's Union, said Skip Phoe-
.;, 
nix, the Canadian diver who befriended 
the young Soviet, "participated at the 
Montreal Olympics not only in the capaci-
ty of a sportsman but also as an agent for 
Canadian intelligence, being paid 'per 
soul' for each he recruited." 
Phoenix has denied he helped engineer 
the defection. 
The latest article on the case portrayed 
Nemtsanov as a total captive of Canadian 
officials, and said the diver was suffering 
from "brain paralyzing drugs" when he 
first met with Soviet officials in Montreal. 
In his remarks published last week, Nem-
tsanov claimed he was in asonstant "fog" 
during the affair.

asked for asylum, but reconsidered be-
cause of concern,over his grandmother's

. Terrorist groups are shifting their focus from 
the U.S. government to American companies in 
this country as well as overseas, according to our 
sources in private security organizations, who 
have become increasingly worried about the devel-
opment.. , . . . 
Security at government installations has been 
tightened, and as a result, our sources say, terror-
ists are looking for easier targets. The murder of 
three North American Rockwell technicians in 
Iran last month confirmed. their fears that U.S. 
businesses and their employes are becoming sym-
bolic stand-ins for the U.S. government :World-
wide, 40 percent of all terrorist attacks have been 
alined at Americans. . . � 
ALTHOUGH Americans overseas still are more 
vulnerable than those at home.� and those in 
arms-related indestries run the greatest risk � the 
experts tell us the danger is spreading to the U.S. 
The fire bombs recently placed in New York de-
partment stores underline the vulnerability of 
ordinary business establishments � and ordinary 
citizens �to terrorist activity. . , 
Security officials also fear that parts of the huge 
� ransom payments received by Latin American ter-
rorists holding kidnapped businessmen may make 
their way to U.S. terrorist groups, enabling them 
to step up their activities in this country. A report 
� on' terrorism by the Central Intelligence Agency 
which has received only limited distribution says it 
is likely that terrorist activity "will be more sharp- , 
ly felt in the U.S.*in the years just ahead." The CIA 
also raises the possibility of "growing contact and 
cooperation" between foreign and U.S.. terrorist 
organizations. 
The threat of terrorism is so real to American , 
companies that representatives of several dozen of 
them are meeting in New York this week with sen-
ior officials from. the State Department. CIA. FBI 
.. 
1. and other agencies at a private seminar organized:. 
: 
under tight security. . . . . 
. BENJAMIN WEINER, a former foreign service.. 
officer who heads the meeting, says the attacks on. 
I� defense-related technicians are a first step in the 
shift of terrorism away from/U.S. military and 
diplomatic personnel. "Such an attack," he says,',I 
.. .. 
"is symbolically equivalent to an attack on the 
government itself." 
CIA officials are also worried about the Security-
of such major installations as offshore drilling. 
rigs,- nuclear reactor sites, the computer that runs 
the Bay, Area Rapid Transit system in San Frame 
cisco. and pipelines (including the Alaska pipe*, 
line). They fear that as terrorist incidents multie 
ply, headline-hunting groups � such as the. 
Croation nationalists who hijacked a TWA jet last - 
weekend � will resort to more spectacular acts of 
terrorism to give them the publicity they crave. 
� Concern is further heightened by the fact theta! 
for the most partaAmericans don't take precau-
tions � and, in fact, often play into the hands of: 
would-be attackers. One offical tells of an eeecuai 
tive of a multinational corporation who, on moving 
to a new location in the U.S., was interviewed by-
his local newspaper. The gory told of his practice: - 
of jogging every morning and gave the exact time 
he left his house,- when he returned (at least partly'e. 
fatigued), where he parked his car. at the railroad.. 
station, and other details that would make him an': 
easy target of an aspiring kidnapper or assassin. t 
For_good measure, he also described, the club his. 
children regularly visited. .� � :a' � 
UP.TO NOW, the federal government hasn't-
made any strong efforts to alert the public to the'a 
dangers of terrorism at home. Therefore, the ex**-: 
perts say, it's pretty much Up to you to watch out. 
for yourself, and they pass along some tips. � 
Weiner .says that business executives shou'tda 
keep a low profile and not draw any unnecessary.. 
attention to themselves or their families. For 
example, he asks, why drive a car with a distinc-
tive license plate that makes you easy to spot? 
It's also advisable to vary personal schedules, 
instead of strictly adhering to the same routine- � 
day after day. Advice along these lines that the.

of the Swedish armed forces, was or-
dered into action today to field hostile 
questions from Swedish reporters. 
At this press conference, the gen-
eral referred only to the purchase of 
"electronic material for the gathering 
of intelligence." He and other military 
men maintained a discreet silence on 
precisely what the device was used 
for, nor was anything said at the press 
conference about the target area. 
It is; he said of the deal, "a per-
fectly legitimate business transaction, 
a payment for delivered goods, and 
not, as has been insinuated, payment 
for services." 
"Deliveries are still going on," the 
general said. "And we use the 
same method of payment. . . no mat-
ter what you write today." 
The secret payments were disclosed 
In Folket i Bild, a Maoist fortnightly 
magazine that � has cracked intelli-
gence secrets here before. The maga-
zine detailed four payments of more 
than $250,000 from 1970 to 1973. They 
were made by Sweden's then-defense 
minister, Sven Andersson, now for-
eign minister, through commercial 
banks, with the biggest slice going. to 
Maj. Gen. Rockly Triantafellu, then 
chief of U.S. Air Force intelligence. 
The technique bypassed Sweden's 
Defense Material Administration, 
which normally does the purchasing. 
Gen. Synnergren readily acknowl-
edged that the money came from se-
cret Defense Ministry funds. 
Because the payments from Sweden 
went to Air Force intelligence, the 
U.S. producer of the electronic device 
was kept in the dark about his ulti-
mate customer. He would know only 
that he received an order from the 
Pentagon, not Sweden, an arrange-
ment that apparently suited both 
Washington and Stockholm. 
Sidestepping the Defense Material 
Administration kept the Swedish Par-
liament and public in the dark,' a dis-
closure that may also hurt the govern-
ment party at the polls. 
The reasons for all this secrecy, it 
was explained here, were these:

matters is short-lived, there is an im-
Portant diplomatic difference between

* Public disclosure of the deal 
would have offended many in Sweden. 
As early .as 1968, Washington's rela-
tions with Stockholm were already 
strained. Olof Palme, who became 
prime minister a year later, had 
marched in an antiwar parade ,had
the North Vietnamese ambassador 
and, in time, Washington recalled its 
envoy. The government here would 
have had trouble explaining how it 
could deal with the Pentagon for a 
sensitive device and damn the United 
States at the same time. 
� AS part of an arrangement of this 
sort, almost inevitably the using coun-
try passes on to \ its supplier some of 
the fruits of its labors. To give a 
NATO leader military information 
about the Soviets appears to be an ob-
vious violation of Sweden's neutrality. 
The story has been a bombshell for 
the media here, headlined on front 
pages in three of .the four big dailies 
and dominating radio and television 
, newscasts. But its political fallout is 
: uncertain. 
Palme is fighting a come-from-be-

.year-old rule of Social Democrats. Pol-. 
Iticians in all camps agree that Sun-

extremely close, much like the one

'e'ATHENS�The long-simmering dis-
pute between Greece and Turkey over 
the Aegean Sea now runs the risk of 
worsening already shaky Greek-Amer-
ican relations as negotiations on U.S. 
bases here enter their final phase. 
Ranking diplomatic sources here 
say that some Greek officials are pri-
vately blaming the United States for 
the lack of resolution to conflicting 
Greek and Turkish claims on the po-
tentially oil-rich seabed of .the Ae-
gean: , 
Since referring the seven-month dis-
pute to the U.N. Security Council in 
August, Greece has suffered a number 
of diplomatic defeats and Turkey and 
Greece, nominally 'partners as NATO--
allies, are still at loggerheads. 
"Omission is as deadly as commis-
ion," said a source close to Premier 
Constantine Karamanlis. "Though the 
Americans finally came around and 
gave us an assist in the Security 
Council, they have refused to exert 
their maximum diplomatic leverage 
on Turkey to date. On both a long-
and a short-term basis, this could 
prove a catastrophic mistake." 
Athens is disgruntled by a compro-
mise resolution 'Ai the council, which 
neither chastized Turkey nor urged it 
to discontinue exploration in the dis-
puted sea. 
"Turkish policy appears mere and 
more to be that of expanding their 
own territory," a ranking Cabinet offi-
cial said in an interview. -The Ameri-
cans have got to make it: very clear 
that this would be catastrophic for 
NATO." 
American sources here feel that the 
Greek criticism is no and 
II ey say that: Washington's influence 
is limited. 
Despite the growing tension, how-
ever, the last leg of the protracted 
Greek-American base negotiations be-
gan last. week. The Karamanlis. gov-
ernment has already agreed in princi-
ple to a four-year accord governing 
the six major U.S. military installa-
tions in exchange for $700 million in 
aid. 
Athens denies that it is using the 
negotiations on U.S. bases as a bar-
gaining lever with Washington for 
stepped-up support on the Aegean 
. Sea. 
"We heSitate to use cards which 
would be construed as blackmail," 
said a government source. "We think. 
it unnecessary to engage in such prac-
tices with an ally, as we firmly believe 
in the logic, legality and morality of 
our case." 
But the Americans, he continued, 
"must realize that we cannot be 
brought to our knees by a dilemma: a 
dilemma of humiliation or war." 
An American observer here de-
scribes the whole sphere of Greek-
Turkish relations as "Kissinger's most 
glaring foreign policy failure to date. 
"It endangers the position of the 
Karmanlis government. if Karamanlis 
becomes the victim of the crisis, 
America will have Lost her only hope 
for a Greece totally 'Western-oriented, 
and the strongest foundation for her 
policy in the eastern Mediterranean," 
he said. 
, If Greece is lost to the Western alli-
ance, he continued, the position of 
Turkey might become greater, but it 
would no longer be linked to Europe, 
which he said would make it impotent 
in the eastern 'Mediterranean. 
'Thus, by hesitating, vacillating 
neglecting to act, washingt on is fiiir

as formal charges were about to 
be brought against two former 
Defence Ministers, and just. as � . 
the then Foreign Minister, Mr � 
Mariano Rumor, was coming 
under increasing suspicion. 
It could all turn out to 
be true, in which case the 
conspiracy .theiry is part of 
a major whitewash attempt. 
Things have never been simple 
in Italian politics, perhaps 
never less simple than now.

Anti-Americanism in Greece hos 
subsided markedly on the surface dur-
ing the past two. years, but there re-
mains a latent feeling of bitterness to-
ward the United States. 
Bitter that the continuing dispute 
with Turkey has. damaged � the econ-
omy, impeded social and economic 
programs, and drained much of the 
government's time, Karmanlis is re-
portedly willing to compromise with 
Turkey, even at the risk of diminish-
ing his own domestic popularity and 
prestige. 
"But," said one of his ranking aides, 
"he cermet negotiate and make com-
promises from a position of weakness. 
it's got to be from a position of 
strength. 
"If the Americans permit the crisis 
to deteriorate to the point of hostility, 
if the Turks become unreasonable in 
their demands, even -Karmanalis will 
not have the force on prestige to im, 
pose a solution." 
A ranking Western diplA at how-
ever, dismissed such criticism as 
naive. "The Greeks just expect too 
much from the Americans." There is 
vi it oal chasm between Athens and 
�Vashington on how Turkey should be 
handled. In essence, the Greek posi-
tion is that Washington's got to get 
tough . to resort to very 'forceful 
measures ranging from military and 
economic embagoes. to threatening a 
lith Fleet intervention in the Aegean 
to give the Greeks iron-clad goat-an-
tees. You might say Greek-American 
relations have gone through a number

some of Libya's limitless desert into 
an oasis.. Qaddafi has put his country-
men on a seemingly endless escalator 
toward a -bigger, better and richer fu-
ture, and they love him for it. 
Perhaps because Qaddafi lives rela-
tively austerely himself and sets, the 
tone, Libyan society Seems- almost 
� classless. It is also humane; since the, 
bloodless coup in 1969, no one has 
been executed. - 
The real puzzle about Libya today 
is how to equate this good-natured, _be-
nevolent regime with the undoubted 
evidence of its machinations abroad, or 
with Qaddafi's political messianism. 
He thinks he is a man of destiny, the 
trustee of three essential values for 
the future of the Arab community at 
-large: unity, Islam as the regulatory 
principle of society, and the military 
defeat of Zionism. As such he is a po-
litical fundamentalist if not a fanatic. 
The trouble is that these ideas, to 
which Arabs often pay lip service, are 
somewhat � unfashionable.. Individual 
state-building has displaced the search 
for unity of-the 1950s and 1960s, secu-
larism in public life has made' sweep-
ing gains, and most Arab leaders have 
come to believe that the Arab-Israeli 
� conflict should be-,settled by political 
negotiation... 
, . 
Some argue that the moral and ma-
terial support that .Qadelafi gives to 
his cherished causes around the world 
is no more than proverbial bedouin 
hospitality run riot. It is said that 
someone with the right ideological 
coloring has only to seek his help to 
be �directed to the jihad (holy war) 
fund, a sort of vast petty-cash box un-
der religious control. 
Libya's population is little' more 
than 2 million and the country is far 
from the heartlands of the Middle 
East, but Qaddafi's ideas, underpin-
ned by an annual oil revenue of 
around $8 billion, have made him the . 
main pole of opposition to Secretary 
of State Henry Kissinger's Pax Amer-
ica. 
Qaddafris out te destroy, by every

leaving Sadat dangerously exposed.. 
Moreover; Egypt has not received the 
vast financial .aid she needs and 
the fires of social unrest burning , 
there ,could well be fanned by .Libyan 
propaganda and subversion. � 
The open support for Qaddafi 
� against Sadat expressed - in Pravda

as a valuable anti-American instru-

Qaddafi is,. no puppet of the Soviet .

openly expressed. But the Soviet Un-

'Modern arsenal of more than 2,000. 
tanks, Migs, surface-to-air missiles, 
and � even the dreaded SCUD�a.

an intermediary to � arm the.

found their way via Libya to Lebanon, 
and they may also he reaching the

For Qaddafi, 'however, the mere

One of the storied traits of tyrants is that, no 
matter how impregnable they might seem to be, 
they never feel safe. Is this one of the explana-
tions for Indira Gandhi's current bid to bury In-
dian democracy under further layers of parlia-
mentary and constitutional assent to her one-
woman rule? 
Otherwise, the Gandhi government's demand 
for substantial new powers would seem to he un-
necessary. Under the "emergency" authority 
she already claims to have, Mrs. Gandhi over 
the last 14 months has proven herself completely 
capable of jailing thousands of opponents, in-
cluding three dozen legislators, imposing a 
sweeping censorship that suppresses news even 
of parliamentary debate and cowing a once 
proudly independent judiciary. With her major 
critics locked up, resistance to her dictatorial 
course has been pathetically weak, and the 
world's most populous democracy lies dormant. 
And since Mrs. Gandhi's Congress party enjoys 
commanding parliamentary control, there is no 
. question about the government getting whatever 
legislative backing it wants � including support 
for changing the constitution. 
It is by the constitutional amendment route 
that Mrs. Gandhi seeks new legal embellish-
ament of her bosshood as prime minister. Powers 
of the judiciary to review legislation and en-
force civil liberties would be curtailed. Parlia-
ment would be permitted to ban "anti-national 
activities and associations." And the prime 
minister, acting through the figurehead presi-
dent, could simply order further changes in the

ern�erer-ey 
constitution without even the need for a parlia-
mentary rubber stamp. 
Some members of the parliamentary opposi-
tion still at large were scathing in their 
denunciations of the Gandhi regime's constitu-
tional proposals. "All the pillars of 
parliamentary democracy are being converted 
into pliant tools of an all-powerful executive," 
said H.M. Patel. "The main thrust of the bill is 
to establish a totalitarian rule of one-party 
dictatorship," said a Marxist member. Mr. 
Patel and his supporters walked out in a boycott 
of the parliamentary proceeding to avoid giving 
"a semblance of constitutional legitimacy to the 
move to throttle democracy and impose authori-
tarian rule." 
� The parliamentary give-and-take seems to 
have a democratic ring until you realize that 
only foreigners like us can read about it, and 
even our correspondents are hampered. Censor-
ship prevents the Indian people from learning 
the substance of the criticism voiced against the 
Gandhi program. The opposition also accuses 
the government of going back on a promise to 
permit public debate of the changes. 
As for editorial critiques Of the constitutional 
plan by India's once-lively press, we regret to 
report virtually nothing along that line. The 
nearest an editorialist came to questioning the 
proposals was with reference to the plan for 
executive amendment of the constitution. An 
editorial in The Statesman called this "extraor-
dinary indeed." That may be the most pregnant 
"indeed" ever written. 
In blunt, blistering language, Saudi 
..�Arabian officials have accused the. 
United States of building up the shah - 
of Iran for an armed invasion of Ara-
bian oil fields. : 
The respected Saudi oil minister, 
'Ahmed Zaki Yamani, warned that the 
shah was "highly unstable mentally." 
if the U.S. authorities failed to recog-
nize this, added Yamani, they must be 
losing their "powers of observation." 
The Saudis confided their fears last 
year to James E. Aldus, then the U. S. � 
ambassador, who relayed the message 
to Washington in startling secret let-
ters and memos. 
� One "memorandum for the file" 
dated Aug. al, 1975, describes the ex-
plosive conversation with Yamani. The 
� oil minister, according to the secret 
memo, said "the conclusion the Saudis 
were reaching was that we had an 
agreement with Iran to let it take over 
the entire Arabian littoral of the Per-
sian Gulf." 
Yemeni believed he United States 
"had urged the shah to make peace 
with Iraq," Aldus added, "so Iran 
would have a freer hand in the lower 
Gulf." 
The Saudi oil minister was con-
vinced that the United States was de-
liberately bolstering the shah's mili-
tary power and that "Iran's extraordi-
nary military buildup was quite 
clearly aimed at occupying the Arab 
states across the gulf, the emirates, 
Qatar, Bahrain,. Kuwait and even Saudi 
Ar able itself." 
The Saudis had become persuaded, 
Akins noted, that "in the next Arab-Is-
raeli war, Israel. . . would be encour-
aged to occupy Tobuk in northern 
Saudi Arabia, and Iran would be told 
to occupy the Arabian littoral." 
If such a situation developed, Ya. 
maul warned Akins: "Iraq would be in-
volved immediately and so would he 
the Soviet Union. But if Iran should 
succeed in occupying part of the Ara-
bian coast., it would find only smoking 
ruins, and the Western oil consumers 
would face catastrophe." 
Akins responded, according to Ids 
secret memo, that "such a plan would 
be sheer madness." Yaloani agreed 
that Akins "was quite right" but add-
ed: "We think you may have � gone 
mad."

By JOHN DARNTON � 
Following his talks with 
President Julius K. Nyerere 
. News 
yesterday,. two dramatically 
Analyses contrasting news conferences 
. were held. In one, President 
� 
Nyerere, sitting on the back� 
porch of.his state house, passionately ex-
plained his mixed feelings toward the 
American intiative and said, in effect, 
that he was less hopeful than ever. 
In the other, Mr. Kissinger, braced be-
hinda lectern at the Kilimanjaro Hotel, 
suggested that President Nyerere's re-
marks were the kind of thing that accom-
panies negotiations and sought to portray 
himself as nothing more than a cOnduit 
for relaying views between black-ruled 
and white-ruled- countries. 
But the fact remains that so far the 
Kissinger trip has drawn a good deal of 
suspicion and doube from black Africa, 
some obviously for appearance sake but 
much of it real. 
Those who traveled with Mr. Kissinger 
during his Middle East negotiations note 
that gloom is a perfect curtain-raiser for 
his style of diplomacy. With it, even a 
relatively. minor advance�in this case, 
an agreement for a constitutional confer-
ence on South-West Africa embracing all 
sides�takes on the appearance of a mira-

Some Call Gloom Justified, 
But those who have followed events 
in Africa feel the gloom justified and 
point out the vast differences between 
the Middle East and southern Africa in 
terms of issues, multiplicity of factions 
and personalities. 
Mr. Kissinger has said privately that 
President Nyerere, whom he greatly re-
spects, is not "another Sadat." The impli-
cation is that unlike the Egyptian Presi-
dent, whom Mr. Kissinger has praised for 
courage in negotiating with, the Israelis 
despite Arab criticism, there is no African 
leader willing to run the risk of appearing 
moderate on the question of "liberation." 
� "The basic underlying obstacle," the 
WASHINGTON POST 
0 SEP '075 
cerned, is not quite valid. The African 
leaders could retort that long before Mr. 
Kissinger entered the scene, at the Victo-
ria Falls conference last year, they tried 
negotiating for majority rule with the 
Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian D. Smith, 
using Prime Minister John Vorster of 
South Africa as an intermediary. The fact 
that the venture failed�because Mr. 
..Vorster was reluctant to apply sufficient 
pressure on Mr. Smith, according to the 
Africans�has left a sense of pessimism 
and even betrayal. 
�The repuations of moderates, such as 
.President Kenneth D. Kanda of Zambia, 
suffered in the growing nationalist fervor 
of Organization of African Community 
gatherings, and they have changed from 
doves to hawks. 
In the Middle East, Mr. Kissinger 
worked for a peace settlement -after the 
fighting had stopped. In southern Africa, 
the fighting is continuing and, indeed, 
growing. 
There is a constituency � among the 
blacks that says the fighting should go 
on. It stems from the conviction that the 
military advantage has swung to the 
blacks and that negotiations undertaken 
later, when territory is actually won, are, 
bound to be more advantageous. That 
conviction is running especially strong 
now that the rainy season, which will 
shift the tactical advantage to the guerril-
las, is about to begin in Rhodesia. To 
negotiate, some feel, wauld be seen as 
a sign of weakness. 
There is also an element of pride and 
a sentiment for winning the war. Of all 
the African nations that have won inde-
pendence, only two, Algeria and Guinea-
Bissau, can honestly sax they have de-
feated colonial forces on the battlefield. 
The slogan of the Zimbabwe People's 
Army, the main fighting force of the Rho-
desian blacks, is We are our own libera-
tors."

Mr. Kissinger is new to Africa, and 
some would say he has yet to acquire 
the necessary feel for the politics and 
special sensibilities. Days before his arri-

reports said that he had been "invited" 
.instead of "welcomed"�a distinction 
promptly corrected by the image-con-
scious Tanzanians. 
Three Conflicts Involved 
The African preSidents say they fear 
that the United States Is acting out of 
self-interest, to contain Soviet influence, 
rather than out of a sincere commitment 
to the concept of majority rule. If this 
is the � case, they say, then America will 
drift into an alliance with South Africa, 
which claims to be fighting communism, 
if the negotiations fail. 
But there is also a strong. moral tone 
to c�their position. They say they want 
someone on their side because it is right, 
and not because of fear of another super-
power. The level of idealism clashes 
somewhat with Mr. Kissinger's brand of 
realpolitik. � 
In the Middle East, the Secretary of 
State could identify the conflict and the 
parties involved. In southern Africa, there 
is not one conflict but three�over Rhode-

Southern

By Murrey Marder 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
Deep distrust of Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger's African shuttle 
diplomacy was expressed 'yesterday by 
black representatives of the Rhode-
sian and Namibian (Southwest Africa) 
liberation movements. 
A conference of African specialists, 
held in the Senate Caucus Room; re-
verberated with suspicion that the ul-
terior motive of Kissinger and the 
Ford administration is to protect 
white interests and American invest-
ments in southern Africa. 
Kissinger's attempt to launch new 
negotiations for peaceful settlement 
of the guerrilla warfare in Rhodesia 
and Namibia was assailed as out-of-
date, ill-advised, a serious subversion 
of African aspirations and even a 
strategy of racism. 
Warfare alone, even if protracted 
warfare, is the only solution now for 
'Rhodesia, liberation spokesmen said. 
The criticisms graphically illustrate 
the obstacles confronting Kissinger's 
new round of African diplomacy, 
which the State Department is ex-
pected to confirm officially today. 
Kissinger is planning a press con-
ference Saturday to explain his new 
venture, scheduled to be launched 
Monday and starting in black Africa. 
Sen. Dick Clark (D-Iowa), a co-spon-
sor with Rep. �Charles C. Diggs Jr. (D--
Mich.) of the African panel discussion 
yesterday, told the group at a luncheon 
in the Senate Office Building that "I 
think the chances are one in 25, or 
�one in 30," that Kissinger's diplomatic 
mission will succeed. 
, "But I think it is worth making the 
effort," Clark said. 
However, while concentrating on 
the racial struggle in Rhodesia and 
Namibia, Clark said, "I hope we never 
forget that the most repressive regime 
in southern Africa is the regime in 
South Africa." 
The Senate Foreign Relations Sub-
committee on Africa, which Clark 
heads, is conducting intensive hear: 
lags on South Africa. In South Africa, 
Clark said, "total U.S. investment is 
estimated at greater than $1.7 billion," 
representing "40 per cent of the total 
U.S. investment in Africa." 
Several hundred spectators at-- 
tended the Caucus Room discussion, 
which was sponsored by the Fund for 
New Priorities in America and the 
Women's .Division of the United Meth-
odist Church. 
To the disappointment: of some of 
the white sperialists on Africa, the lib-
eration spokestmni Inc Rhodesia re-
LA/trust ossm 
fused to consider any alternative to 
expanding guerrilla war. 
Callistus Ndlovu, representing the 
relatively more moderate wing of the 
Zimbabwe (Rhodesian) African Na-
tional Council, led by Joshua Nkomo, 
who tried to negotiate with Rhodesian 
Prime Minister Ian D. Smith, said: 
"We do not see how the talks can be 
Presumed ... We therefore believe that 
any attempt to resume these talks is 
bound to fail." 
Eddison Zvobgo, a representative of 
the more militant wing of the Rhode-
sian liberation movement, led by 
Bishop Abel Muzorewa, said that 
"every time the U.S. raises the ques-
tion of negotiations" it is because a 
liberation struggle is "about to tri-
umph" somewhere in the world. 
"The conference stage is over," 
Zvobgo said. "Negotiations are being 
carried out where they belong�on the 
battlefield. We should resist any Kis-
singer seduction." 
,One white panelist, Alex Boraine, 
from Harvard University's Center for 
International Affairs, a former mem-
ber of the South African Parliament 
for the Progressive Reform Party, 
asked the liberation spokesmen if 
they saw no course "complementary 
to the armed struggle." He asked , if 
there is no way to reduce "the length 
of the struggle" in Rhodesia, and the 
casualties. 
Only "by politicizing our people," 
and "by rallying as many interna-
tional forces as possible," replied El-
ton Razemba, another member of the 
Bishop Muzorewa faction of the Afri-
can National Council. "Destruction 
will be there," he said. "What is war 
about? Zimbabwe will be a better soci-
ety" in the end. 
Zvobgo, his colleague, interjected: 
"The only way of shortening the 
[Rhodesian] war or limiting the num-
ber of people killed or injured is to 
get the war over as quickly as possi-
ble. It is a kind of 'quick kill' theory, 
to put it bluntly." 
The Rhodesian liberation spokes-
men insisted that what is going on in 
Rhodesia in the conflict between 
about 270,000 whites and about 6 mil-
lion blacks is not a racial. war. "We 
are not ' just fighting to replace a 
white government with black faces," 
Ndlovu said. "We are fighting to bring 
about fundamental change." 
American-British plans to organize 
an international guarantee fund of up 
to $1.5 billion to $2 billion to compen-
sate Rhodesia's white settlers for 
their property and other assets, said 
Ndlovu, represents "guarantees of 
40 
em 
privilege" which the blacks will nere? 
tolerate. 
This idea "is predicated on the no-
tion that it is impossible for blacks 
and whites to live together peace-
fully," he said, and Zvobgo charged, 
"This really is racism." 
However,, Nigeria's, ambassador to 
the United Nations, Leslie 0. Harri-
man, while criticizing much of Kis-
singer's strategy, said, "I believe that 
the option of buying off the whites is 
realistic." 
Harriman said afterward, "We have 
done it in our own country [Nigeria] 
for independence." But he also said 
that, *basically, "the military struggle 
is the only option left" for Rhodesian 
independence. 
Kissinger's diplomacy for Namibia 
equally "is bound to fail," said O.T. 
Emvula, deputy chief of the South 
West Africa People's Organization 
(SWAPO) mission to the United Na-
tions. 
He labeled Kissinger's approach to 
Namibia "a serious subversion" of 
commitments made by the United Na-
tions for the independence of that ter-
ritory. 
Kissinger, Emvula said,'Aleliberate-
ly complicates" matters by meeting 
with Prime Minister John Vorster of 
South Africa, which rules Namibia 
under a mandate that the United Na-
tions has ruled is illegal. 
If there "will be a negotiation," said 
Emvula, expressing a more moderate 
position than his Rhodesian col-
leagues, "only South Africa and 
SWAPO shall be the parties." 
However, SWAPO, he said, will not 
enter any talks with South Africa un-
til South Africa withdraws its military 
forces from Namibia and releases all 
political prisoners. 
� Panelist Boraine said, "I think Vor-
ster will do a great deal to get Nami-
bia ... off his back."

Flabby Government Bureaucracy Fails to Contain Insurgents 
13Y GEORGE Ild'eARTITUR 
Times Stall Writer � : 
I3ANCKOK�Por eight years the 
government of Thailand has entrust-
ed its campaign against Communist 
insurgents to a semi-clandestine, 
rank-heavy bureaucracy known as � 
ISOC�the Internal Security Opera-
tions Command. � 
And while ISOC grew progressive-
Ay flabbier, the insurgency grew 
from a serious nuisance into a hard 
jungle army of about 9,000 guerrillas 
In the estimate of an American ex-
pert, the Communist organization be-
came "a .quality product, well-
trained, well-armed and largely self-
sufficient." It has, the expert said, 
perhaps 85,000 active workers within 
the country's political woodwork. 
Given the intrigues of the Thai mih 
itary structure�where some 6067 
generals and admirals vie for power 
and its rewards�it would be unfair 
. to blame Communist growth entirely � 
; on ISOC's failure. � � 
The government's regular � armed , 
forces -are made up of more than 
� 200,000 men, plus a paramilitary de- . 
� fense� corps of. 49,000 and a border 
police force of � 14,000. Their effe6-
tiveness is a matter of debate. 
' � Gen. Saiyud Kerdphol, the ISOC 
� commander, warned i� recntly: "My 
- estimate �is: that we have about three 
years to put our house. ift order. If. 
� not, the eambinatioWof internal and 
, external pressures will nialce�the fu-
;ture� of this country ..'very uncertain 
sindeed.". : �. 
An; Anierican. military adviser feels 
s'the test will come sooner: 
. expects 'that Within. the. next 
two dry seasons4�a span of about IS 
months�the insurgency will grow to 
. niobile warfare and . battalion-sized 
attacks against the ill-organized Thai 
military and government structure. 
� "They have the troops to do it 
now," he said. "They could overrun 
any military or police , post in the 
� countryside if they wanted to." 
The old-school politicians and gen-
erals who run things in Bangkok are 
. 'debating what to do. There are belat-
ed plans to reorganize the army, buy-, 
more planes and enlarge "pacifica-
tion" programs in the countryside. 
But sources with first-hand knowl-
edge of the Thai counterguerrilla 
. program say .that despite decades of . 
-experience, the government fre-
quently lacks the most basic knowl- � 
edge of Communist activity. . 
"Intelligence -in the past has not-
been too accurate," admitted Air 
Marshal Siddhi Savetsila, secretary 
general of the National Security 
Council. "We have good hindsight on 
what has happened, but we know 
nothing about what is about to ham' 
pen or what the insurgents are going 
to do the next day. But the Commu-
..riists know our movements." 
For years of military rule, and dur-
ing the fragile period of democracy 
since 1973, the rulers in Bangkok in-
directly have supported the domino 
theory by contending that the Com-
munist Party of Thailand was almost 
totally dependent on outside help.. 
Aging Prime Minister Seni Pramol, 
ill-suited to control the traditional 
turbulence of Thai politics, has tried 
to play it both ways. Until June he 
contended that foreign aid was mak-
ing the insurgency more serious than 
ever. Last month he admitted before 
the parliament that he had little 
proof of direct aid from Peking, Han-
oi or Moscow for Thailand's Commu-
nists. 
Then he basked in the "diplomatic 
victory" when Foreign Minister Pi-
chai Rattakul returned from Hanoi, 
where the two countries agreed to 
exchange ambassadors, and reported 
a pledge froni North Vietnamese Pre-
mier Pham Van Dong not to inter-
fere in Thailand's domestic affairs. 
(The Chinese had. made a similar . 
pledge earlier). . 
� But Seni knows better. The flow of 
aid from Hanoi and Peking is a fact 
of life along the border. 
More important is the dismal fact 
that� during the decade of heavy 
American involvement in Vietnam, 
while the Thais largely wasted $1.7 . 
billion in aid, the Cofnmunists were 
building a force heeding little outside 
help. 
A diplomatic source cited the 
government's record recently in the _ 
distant southern provinces, which 
the least important of three major in-
surgency areas. In little-noted 
clashes, insurgents there have cap- ' 
tured more than 300 weapons in. six, 
months. 
The government is planning a $600 
million military budget this year. A 
Western expert figured abstractly 
that the Insurgents could fight for 
roughly 130 years on that. amount. It 
lakes only 75 cents a day to feed and 
clothe a Communist soldier and keep 
him in the field. In time, the insur-
gents doubtlessly will need more am-
munition and guns, but they need lit-
tle right now. 
"This is not tho classic domino__ 
theory. This is the Communist Party 
of Thailand at work," a Western clip.' 
lomat said. 
Still,. the outside help is available 
now. There are three fairly well de-
fined supply routes through Laos 
from Vietnam, organized and 
manned by North Vietnamese. The 
Chinese send supplies on an all-
weather road extended through Laos 
to Pak I3eng, just across the northern , 
Thai borfier. 
The level of this aid is indicated by 
the light traffic on the Chinese road. 
In one recent month, an official ado 
'milled, only two Chinese trucks 
came down with material for the in-
� surgents: 
The Thai army has done little to � 
seriously disturb the Communists in 
their growing "liberated zones." 
While the generals make pro-
nouncements and schedule "suppres-
sion" drives, the actual strategy has : 
been one of "containment." The Corn, 
Inimist bases are largely centered 
� around tribal peoples in-jungles- and 
mountains, but there are relatively 
few government soldiers in a position 
to bar the insurgents from moving 
into more populated�and. ethnic 
Thai�districts. . � 
Government offensives are rare. 
The only major battle of the year 
came about by accident. It started 
June 11 when the jet pilot son of a 
Maj. Gen. Yuthasorn ICarsornstik 
� crashed his F-5 in the rugged moun-
tains of Petchabun province, about 
300 miles north of Bangkok and mid-
way between the insurgent areas in i 
the north and the northeast. 
An immediate operation was 
launched to find the plane. A pare-

By RoaritT L. BARTLEY 
PEKING�The doors to the Great Hall 
�of the People stood open, and after 15 min-
' utes waiting in the pleasant autumn sun, 
the force of the air conditioning struck the 
face like a cold breeze. It was a fitting sen-
sation as one came into the presence of the 
remains of Mao .Tse-tung, one of the most 
, historic figures of our century. 
James Schlesinger, formerly U.S. Sec-
retary of Defense and now in Peking as a 
guest of the Chinese government, led the 
party of 12 Americans into the antecham-
ber where they signed official registers, 
and into the receiving line of nine of the 
fop officials of the People's Republic of 
China �headed by Premier Hua Kuo-feng, 
and Politburo standing committee mem-
bers Wang Hung-wen and Chang Ch'un-
.ch'ia.o. 
Slowly walking 80 steps beyond the re-
ceiving line, the party spread into a re-
spectful line before the glass coffin holding 
the remains. Motion pictures were taken 
under shining light, and the party passed 
alongside the bier, three feet from the late 
chairman. Mao's face was somehow more 
square, more gray, and more . wrinkled 
than one would expect from photographs. 
But eyes closed /111(1 expression peaceful, it 
radiated a sense of serenity and power. 
The procession passed behind one row 
oi wreaths as the next group of foreign vis-
itors canie through the receiving line, then 
down the steps past a separate line of blue 
and green clad Chinese workers, and fi-
nally hack to Its proceselon of autos/rwen-
ty-tive minutes after the party had left its 
hotel, the solemn :Mil dignified ceremony 
Wert over. The former American Defense 
gocrotary had paid his last respects to the 
-Vhatever the makeup of the corn4 
mittee� analysts say it is totally 
Maoist. The Party radio station oper-
ating from Kunming in south China 
never varies from Peking's lil, al-
though it steers clear of comment on 
international Communist squabbles. 
The domination of the Thai party's 
_ideology by Maoists may have come , 
as a slight shock to Hanoi in the eu-
phoria that followed the fall of Sal-
gon in April, 1975. Some analysts feel 
that Hanoi's leaders attempted at 
that time to enlarge their influence 
in the party. 
"The old party hands in Thailand 
are not going to let the Vietnamese 
run their 'revolution' for them," said 
a European diplomat whose Asian 
experience dates back many years. 
"Vietnam gave them a tremendous 
lift but the CPT has been building to-
ward the same goal for.years. They 
are following good Maoist principles 
in preparing to encircle the cities 
from the countryside, and that con-
tinues to be their strategy." 
Another Western expert feels that 
the Thai party will alter the strategy 
somewhat to take advantage of the 
political weaknesses in Bangkok. 
"What they are after here is a col-
lapse from within," he said. 'Those 
guerrillas are not going to come 
marching into Bangkok like the 
North Vietnamese marched into Sai-
gon. The way they figure it, they 
won't have to." 
*ficance to .a China 
_ 
leader and saint of the People's Republic 
and the Chinese Communist Party, 
Mr. Schlesinger, and for that matter the 
other 11 Americans present, had certainly 
not come to China with the idea of passing 
by Mao's .bier, but for a spectacular 5,000-
mile tour of the nation's most remote and 
fabled regions. Upon the chairman's death 
the trip was cancelled. The wreath-laying 
was something of a symbolic substitute, for 
clearly the. invitation was intended as a 
great honor for Mr. Schlesinger. Now the 
rest of the trip has suddenly been rein-
stated as well, an intriguing commentary 
on the post-Mao regime and Chinese priori-
ties in foreign policy. 
An 'Exceptional Regard' 
Obviously the Chinese government has 
what one of its spokesmen calls "excep-
tional regard" for Mr. Schlesinger., who 
since his dismissal as Defense Secretary 
by President Ford has been at the Johns 
Hopkins University Washington Center of 
Foreign Policy Pesearch. During the 
mourning period, when, Peking's Museums 
were officially closed, he and his party 
were escorted to the Great Wall, the Ming 
tombs am! the fantastie Summer Palace, 
Members of his party were told that the 
original invitation for the visit came at the 
personal direction of Mat), and that the 
dying chairman knew Mr. Schlesinger was 
In Peking. 
The trip's itinerary was from the first 
the Moat. SpeetttcUlar ever accorded a for-
eign visitor. Mr. iiehlesinger and those of 
party who have iniastsi the Chinese 
health exams for a 12,a00-foot idtitude will 
visit th'e Dahl! 1.,:t11)1CS ottl capital of 1,11icla 
In TibtA, lifter pending the balance of the 
mourning Willa quietly in China's scenic 
4.2 
rip 
Jewel of Kueilin. They will also visit the 
Central Asian region of Sinkiang, another 
fabled land which also has a sensitive bor-
der with the Soviet Union, and the almost 
as remote Inner Mongolia. Any one of 
these stops might be the highlight of a nor-
mal China tour. 
Why should the People's Republic of 
China pay such attention to a former offi-
Mr.' Schlesinger had cer-
tainly not come to China 
with the idea .of passing 4 
Mao's bier. Now the rest of 
his trip ,has Suddenly been 
reinstated, an 14 itriguing 
commentary on the post-
Mao regime and Chinese 
pr-
orities in foreign policy. 
� 
dal who is now an academic? It is true 
that China did entertain former President 
Nixon and former Walsh Prinne Minister 
Edward He with' high lienors after they 
left office. But when pressed for a reason 
for the "exceptional regard" for Mr. 
Schlesinger, an official says, "His views�
it is no secret.''

plomacy for some time now. Their propa-
,. geode. refers to new Munichs," particu-
" !arty applied to the Helsinki agreement. 
, One China-watcher back in the United 
States viewed the thete:inmending Schlesin-
ger trip as an attempt to "inject anti-de-
tente, anti-Soviet themes into the American 
political campaign." The trip had in fact 
been originally scheduled for June, but Mr.: 
' Schlesinger postponed it until after the Re-
publican Convention to minimize the impli-
cations for domestic politics. The same 
. China-watcher remarks that since 1974 the 
Chinese have been trying to build up Mr. 
Schlesinger at the expense of Secretary of 
State. Henry Kissinger, and in.: the last* 
e three or four months have started to erne- . 
� cize Secretary Kissinger by name in their 
press outlets in Hong Kong. 
- The trip will do little to dampen that 
particular tendency. Those who listened to' 
the toasts at the going-away party for non-
journalists held at the Chinese liaison of-
fice in Washington report that Chief of Of-
flee Huang Chen stressed that the invita-
tion for Mr. Schlesinger to visit China had 
been first extended two years ago, while he 
was still Defense Secretary. Mr. Schlesin-
ger is reported to have replied that he 
never received the invitation, apparently 
because there were "filters within the U.S. 
government." 
The Chinese Dilemma . 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
The Chinese expectations' of an ariti-Scie 
viet posture from Mr. Schlesinger were not 
disappointed, for he expressed the theme 
in such events as the public toast at a ban-' 
quet with Foreign Minister Chian Kuan-
hua, with whem he held five hours of pri-
vate conversations prior to Mao's death. 
But at other points, the ex,:11;tiges caught 
the dilemma of Chinese relations with the 
U.S. 
In particular, there was an exchange 
with Chen Shien-ta, political commissioner 
of the Chinese army's Third Garrison Divi-
sion. visited bv, the group. Mr. Olen gave a 
long history of the division that included 
the elimination of 10,000 "enemy troops" 
while fighting "American imperialism" in 
Korea. Mr. Schlesinger replied that the ref-
erence to Korea "strained the historical 
record and the rules of hospitality." 
Other American representatives visiting 
Chinese military units have suffered simi-
lar and even harsher lectures about Korea 
without responding. The problem for the 
Chinese is that an American who takes a 
tough line with the Russians is not likely to 
take a soft line with China's own claims. In 
choosing which Americans to encourage, 
the People's Republic has to sort out its 
priorities. And one thing the Schlesinget 
visit suggests is that it has sorted'them out 
pretty well. 
. . 
By now the visit, and particuhu.;y its 
reinstatement after Mao's death, may have 
taken on. a new .significance. Even before 
WASHINGTON POST 
8 SEP 1G:3 
Rowland. Evans and Robert Novak  
the chairman's death, the.nation WEIS buf-
feted by the passing of Premier Chou En-
lid. It has also suffered major earthquakes 
in three regions, and a huge meteor fell in 
a fourth �regarded in Chinese superstition 
as marking the loss of "the mandate of 
heaven" and the passing of a dynasty. 
There have been indications, including a 
heavy emphasis on law and order in the 
Chinese press, of a decline in social disci-
pline. 
In these circumstances, the elaborate' 
trip for Mr. Schlesinger can be seen as a 
sign ,of continuity. It suggests business as 
usual. The decision to reinstate Mr. Schles-
inger's trip, at a time when foreign digni-
taries are explicitly not invited to China, 
would seem rather nicely to demonstrate 
that someone in the hierarchy of the 
People's Republic has the power and will 
- to make decisions that are, if not exactly 
bold, at least unconventional. 
And of course, if the trip's reinstate-
ment suggests there will be a continuity of 
the regime after Mao, it also suggests con-
tinuity in its implicit foreign policy priori� - 
ties. So it is perhaps well to remember that 
Mr. Schlesinger was invited to China to 
make the point that what Peking wants 
most from the U.S. is a military balance 
against the Soviet Union.

e Korean incident: An Orchestrated 
Contrary to hints from the State De-
partment that Moscow and Peking se-
cretly helped avert a new Korean war, 
non-political government experts be-
lieve the recent crisis was a ploy or-
chestrated by North Korea with limited 
. political goals in mind. 
There is no hard intelligence of any 
Intervention by either the Soviet Union 
Or Communist China that prompted the 
North Korean expressions of regrets 
for the murder, of two U.S. army offi-
cers. Rather, there is a strong feeling 
among Pyongyang-watchets here that 
North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung 
never wanted the provocation of Aug. 
18 to escalate into warfare but intended 
it for political effects, both in Korea 
and the U.S. � 
Thus, instead of triumphantly dem-
onstrating the value of detente, the 
events in Korea were part of continued 
Communist pressure on one of the 
world's most dangerous flashpoints. 
The reaction on Capitol Hill, conthined 
with the overall political climate here, 
should encourage North Korea to keep 
up that pressure. 
The most obvious goal of the Aug. 18 
Incident was to draw attention to Korea 
at the recently completed non-aligned 
nations confercuee in Colombo, Sri 
Lanka, and the forthcoming United Na-
tions General Assembly session. For the 
longer range, however, K iat's targets 
were political opinion, at home and 
among his enemies. 
Troubled by grave economic prob-
lems in North Km-ca, Kiln is believed 
by experts to have fomented a criais to 
firm up national morale. 
At age 04, the Korean despot is in 
questionable health, troubled by a vlst-
ble growth on his neck which is getting 
alarmingly large. The designation of 
his eldest son, 36-year-old Chong Il 
Sung, as heir apparent has not proved 
popular with the party apparatus; the 
succession is now in doubt. According-
ly, the time-tested device for diverting . 
attention from domestic discord is to 
generate a unifying foreign threat. 
In the hermit state of North Korea, 
there is no quick way to determine 
whether Kim's bloody ploy fulfilled its 
domestic goals. It is clear, however, 
that it largely achieved its foreign pur-
pose: to raise new doubts among Ameri-
cans about their seemingly endless Ko-
rean commitment. 
Beneath public expressions of out-
rage over Pyongyang's latest atrocity 
were private complaints on Capitol Hill 
that American blood was too precious 
to spill for Park Chung Bee's authori-
tarian South Korean regime. Indeed, 
events following the Aug. 18 incident 
Indicate development of an anti-South 
Korea congressional bloc on the model 
of the old anti-South Vietnam )loc. 
Just as the House international af-
fairs committee was about to -adopt a 
resolution condemning North Korean 
actions, Rep. Don Fraser of Minnesota 
proposed an additional paragraph con-
demning South Korea's sentencing of 
political prisoners. Amazingly, the com-
mittee adopted it. Fraser, who has be-
come the scourge of Seoul, on Sept. 1 
won committee approval to subpoena 
South Korean diplomats and their doc-
uments. 
That same day this question was 
raised by Rep. Robert Drinan of Massa-
chusetts in a House floor statement at.
the sentencing: "Should the 
United States that gives massive eco-
nomic and military assistance to South 
Ploy? 
Korea confess that it has no sanction 
for this type of indefensible cot duct?" 
While the Erasers and Drinans propose 
ending all aid as a sanction, Jimmy 
Carter talks of a staged withdrawal of 
all US. ground forces from Korea 
(though lately he has promised to first 
consult Japan). 
Enjoying this favorable political cli-
mate, Pyongyang-watchers believe Kim 
.never had any intention of escalating 
the murder of the Americans into a 
war for the entire peninsula. Besides, 
his notions of attempting a lightning 
seizure of Seoul last year following the 
fall of Saigon were vetoed by both 
Cornmunist superpowers. 
� Nevertheless, some close students of 
the Korean scene deduce that Kim, au-
thor of so much bloody mischief in East 
Asia for a generation, would never is-
sue his first apology for anything with-
out pressure from the Russians or 
Chinese. That deduction, however, is 
not backed up by facts. Officials at the 
highest level say there is simply no in-
telligence of any such intervention. 
In his declining. years, Kim Il Sung 
may have moved from sheer brute 
force to a mixture of brute force and 
political maneuver. Experts here be-
lieve his immediate goal; will be to en-
courage sentiment, ieside the U.S. ao ye-
eating a Korean pullout while seeking 
bilateral U.S.-North fantasia neetala-
tions, leaviog out the South Kok 
That may prove more difficult for U.S. 
politicians to refast than a naked mili-
tary threat.

THE ECONOMIST AUGUST 28, r978 
Left right right right... 
.Bad days for Latin American radicals. 
.Every to CO 20 years the continent's 
left wing attempts to find a new way 
of �bridging the extremities of wealth 
and poverty that bedevil most Latin 
American countries.. In the 194os and 
19505 democratically elected dema-
gogues had their day in. several of 
the larger states: , most of . them 
disappeared .. Juicier the. treads of 
right-wing tanks. .In the 196os insur-
� rectionary guerrilla armies attempted 
to imitate Mr Fidel Castro's Victory in 
Cuba; but efforts to export Cuba's 
.-revolution came to nothing and the 
guerrillas, or many of them, were 
.hunted down by the military 
governments they had helped to pro-
voke into seizing power. Next came 
left-wing military governments; but 
, these too are sputtering out. The left 
is ..fading�and so, too, is democracy. 
In Peru, General Velasco Alvarado, 
who followed the radical-soldier tradi-
tion of Ataturk and Nasser, was 
dropped last year, and his left-wing 
prime minister, General Jorge Fer-
nandez Maldonado, was sacked last 
*month. The more timidly reformist 
president of Ecuador, General Rod-
riguez Lara, lost his job in January. 
The only avowed soldier-radicals still 
around are the flamboyant' ruler of 
Panama, General Omar Torrijos, and 
a clique of quarrelling colonels in Hon-
duras led by Colonel Melgar Castro. 
Never upset a landowner 
But General Tnrrijos's left-wing bark 
has always been fiercer than his bite. 
Panama's liberal banking laws, for 
example, have made it a haven for 
'foreign capital. And land reform, 
touted . by the general as his main 
achievement, has been moving along 
, on a tiny annual budget of kim. The. 
Honduran government took office last 
� year in the wake of charges that the 
previous president had been bribed by 
an American banana company. It is 
�already cutting back on its land re-
form programme for fear of upsetting 
� the nearly independent power of the 
country's big landowners. The left-
wing head of the country's agrarian 
reform institute was fired in October, 
'and the it seems to have lost control 
of large areas where scores of people 
have beer) killed in 'clashes between 
peasants and landowners. � 
Neither in Peru nor in Ecuador was 
the reform experiment a complete 
failure. About 20M acres of land in 
Peru were expropriated, and a start was 
made towards a crude distribution of 
wealth through profit-sharing schemes. 
The Peruvians also nationalised their 
fisheries, banks, mining and oil indus-
.tries, although some of these are now 
being given back to private industry. 
They were careful not to frighten 
away foreign investment, which stayed 
at a high level until the economy 
began to get into trouble last year. 
:But the expectations aroused by the 
reforms in Peru -were largely disap-
pointed. Government � overspending 
pushed inflation � up to an annual rate 
of ao%, provoking riots 'and strikes. 
The agencies supervising the -reform 
programmes were all too often corrupt 
and inefficient. And only about a third 
of Peru's people were actually affected 
by the changes. Three quarters of the 
government's budget this year con-
tinues to flow into metropolitan Lima, 
which contains only a fifth of the 
cbuntry's population. More than tm 
peasants�most of them the mountain 
Indians whose plight had fired General 
Velasco's revolutionary ardour when 
he did a tour of duty away from Lima 
as a young man�remain landless. 
Ecuador's 'more timid reforms hardly 
got off the ground. They were largely 
financed by the country's oil revenues, 
which are not very big. Nearly half the 
country's population is still unem; 
ployed or underemployed; half the 
land is still owned by 2%; of the people. 
Peru's and Ecuador's new rulers 
seem to have accepted the blunt fact 
that it is hard to have a social revolu-
tion without making money first. They 
are also beginning to talk about hand-
ing power back to the civilians. 
Ecuador's leader, Admiral Poveda, has 
promised to hold elections by t 977. 
President Morales Bermudez of Peru 
has taken civilians into his cabinet, and 
was starting to ease restrictions on the 
press until he was checked by a bout 
of rioting in July. In Honduras, the 
,government says it will hand over 
power by 1979. 
The South American map would 
Approved for Release: 2018/10/05 CO2623720 
be enlivened by some patches of demo-
cratic colour. Buried in the political 
graveyard are long-established Latin 
American democracies such as Chile 
and Uruguay, as well as the countries 
that have ricocheted between demo-
cratic and authoritarian rule, such 
as Argentina and Bolivia. The drive 
by left-wing guerrillas helped to 
impel South America's lurch towards 
.right-wing army rulers. Few democratic 
governments could enforce the authori-
tarianism needed tostampout guerrillas. 
Economic instability, however, was 
the prime cause of Latin America's 
drift to dictatorship. Radical govern-
ments followed each other to the 
scaffold, as programmes multiplying 
workers' wages, nationalising indus-
tries and expandinpublic spending 
generated massive -rates of inflation. 
Brazil started the ball rolling after the 
short and disastrous presidency of Joao 
Goulart in the earlyi196os. His efforts 
sent inflation up to t00% and brought 
in the generals in 1964. In Bolivia the 
radical military government of General' 
.Torres sank into economic Chaos and. 
was overthrown by 'the ,right-wing 
General Banzer in 1971... In Uruguay, 
government corruption and overspend-
ing brought in the army in 1973. Sal-
vador Allende's Marxist government in 
Chile hit the inflation jackpot. When 
the rate reached about i000% in 
1973, General- Pinochet launched his 
military coup. Chile's inflation records 
were reached, and possibly beaten, this 
year in Argentina when the soldiers 
stepped in to save the country from 
near-anarchy. � . �

Professionals have their use 
Western-style democracy is out of 
fashion. Instead the military rulers, of 
Brazil in particular, have been taking 
their cue from Mexico, Latin America's 
most successful one-party state. The 
Mexican Institutional Revolutionary 
party has used professionals to run its 
economy�the most recent of whom, 
the finance minister, Mr Lopez Portillo, 
takes over as president in December. 
� The soldiers running Brazil, Chile, 
Argentina, Bolivia and Uruguay 
handed the job of economic manage-
ment to civilians, all of whom were 
largely foreign-educated and all of 
whom pursue broadly similar policies. 
Most of Brazil's successive economic 
managers spent long periods in the 
United States. Jos�artinez de Hoz, 
Argentina's finance minister, went to 
Eton and Harvard. Bolivia's finance 
minister, Carlos Calvo, was educated in 
Britain. Uruguay's finance minister, 
Vegh Villega, went to Harvard. 
The old school tie has not done 
badly. It helps, naturally, to have 
soldiers in the background to shoot 
anyone who strikes against wages 
policies or price rises. The most recent 
.example of tough confrontation was in 
Bolivia where the regime spent the 
past two months cracking the demands 
of strikers sitting it out in the tin mines. 
At least four miners and several sol-
diers were killed and the government 
cut off electricity and water supplies 
to some of the men underground. 
But the economists have not lived 
by the gun alone. The Brazilians pion-
eered an imaginative mix of. economic 
policies, including the encouragement 
of large-scale foreign investment, in-
dexation of prices, wages and savings 
in line with inflation, big state invest-
ments, and a crawling-peg exchange 
rate. Bolivia's orthodox monetarist 
policies�and its self-sufficiency in oil 
�have brought inflation down to about 
15% this year. Monetarist policies have 
taken longer to work in Chile, but in-
flation has fallen fast over the past six 
months. Uruguay's inflation rate has 
fallen slowly to about 50% a year. 
The most dramatic turnabOut was 
in Argentina. In June, three months 
after the military coup, monthly infla-
tion had dropped from 38% to 2M%.

Wages have been firmly clamped down. 
At the same time the government has 
mobilised Argentina's enormous agri-
cultural resources by raising food 
prices from the unrealistic levels at 
which they were pegged under the 
Peronist governments: a 40% increase 
in the prices paid to producers for 
grain led to an extra 5m acres of wheat 
being planted in July. 
This kind of economic management 
marks the newer military governments 
out from die older, more static and 
impoverished dictatorships. General 
Stroessner has ruled Paraguay as a 
personal fiefdom for 22 almost growth-
free years; the Somoza dynasty has run 
Nicaragua, on and off, for 40 years. 
In other respects the soldiers, old or 
new, use many of the same methods. 
The map, a necessarily sketchy guess at 
political prisoners, gives one very 
rough idea of the levels of repression 
exercised by the different militan; 
governments. And political prisoners 
are only part of the picture of dis-
appearances, torture and killings in 
many Latin American countries. 
Nothing succeeds like success 
Many of the economic ministers and 
officials claim that economic viability 
will pave the way for a return of the 
soldiers to the barracks. On the con-
trary. Their very success seems to 
strengthen the army's resolve to stay 
on in office. Even the most moderate 
of Argentina's present soldier-rulers say 
that the army will have to Stay in office 
indefinitely. The half-hearted promises 
of Brazil's successive presidents over 
the past 14 years to restore democracy 
have never been kept. In Chile, 
General Pinochet's sole concession to 
the scattered forces of the democracy 
that was once the pride of Latin 
America has been to consider allowing 
local elections. The army's grip on 
Uruguay seems, after the dismissal of 
its civilian front man in June, to be 
tightening. Bolivia's military govern-
ment has set a paper deadline for a 
return to civilian rule by ig80. Nobody 
believes it. 
. Nor is there much evidence that the 
generals and the economists working 
for them are trying to resolve the 
social problems that lie at the heart of 
Latin American political. instability. 
Under. President Geisel, thazil has in-
creased its social budget, but up to 
40% of Brazilians remain outside the. 
moneyed economy. Economic recovery 
in Uruwitay, Bolivia and Chile has been 
largely achieved by depressing real 
wages and balancing budgets; low rates 
of taxation leave little room for social 
spending, Mr Carlos Calvo says that

now that Bolivia's economic house is

seldom comes. 
Political soldiers tend atter a period 
in government to become politicians. 
In Brazil the political arguments that 
stopped when the generals came in 
have simply surfaced again in the 
army. So too have other civilian habits, 
including corruption. Argentina's mod-
erate president, General Videla, is 
fighting for control against his more 
extreme colleagues who encourage a 
policy of indiscriminate repression. 
Neither military discipline nor econ-
omic recovery is helped by the fact that 
several Argentine industries are owned 
by the armed forces. Divisions within 
the Chilean junta led to the dismissal 
in January of the relatively moderate 
chief of staff, General Lopez Arellano. 
Bolivia has been plagued by the 
attempted palace coups of left-wing 
army factions.

would be better off if their armies

Too often democratic experiments have 
been stunted because they grew in the 
shadow of armies who Ated as alter-
native governments instead of the final 
guarantors of order and democracy. 
The three exceptions that disprove the 
rule that Latin Americans are inher-
ently incapable of democracy are Vene-

perhaps it is tiny Costa Rica that has 
the safest formula for a centre course 
to democratic survival. It disbanded

last month, were hostilely greeted by crowds 
� at Santiago's Pudahuel Airport, that country's 
Catholic hierarchy accused the government of 
authoring the violent demonstration. It also ex-
communicated four government officials. 
* Earlier in August at the session in the 
Ecuadorian city of Riobamba, 37 churchmen 
from around Latin America were arrested, de-
tained overnight; and then expelled from the 
country for taking part in what the government 
termed "a subversive plot." Ecuador's church 
hierarchy promptly accused the government of 
illegally interfering in church nctivities. 
o Argentina in recent months has been ar-
resting churchmen and young seminarians, in-
cluding one United States priest, on charges of 
subversion and of possessing Marxist-Leninist 
literature. The U.S. clergyman was released, 
but the fate of 11 others is unknown and the 
Argentine hierarchy has issued a series of pro-
:tests. 
o Meanwhile, Brazil's Dom Helder Camara, 
a longtime opponent of the Brazilian Govern-
ment and bishop of Recife and Olinda, issued a 
new criticism of governments in Latin Amer-
ica, saying they "no longer serve the people." 
Behind these and other developments is a 
sharp ideological dispute that has led to the 
most serious deterioration in churchlstate rela-
tions in years. 
Not since Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Cas-
tro tangled with that country's Roman Catholic 
hierarchy has there ,been such a Church-state 
clash. 
In that struggle, which eventually resulted in 
a standoff, the church took a basically conser-
vative approach, Dr. Castro a much more lib-

Prime Candidates for 
Guerrilla Subversion 
�� BY. DAVID P. BELNAP 
Times Staff Writer 
BUENOS AIRES�One of the most 
striking aspects of the war against 
subversion in Argentina is the kind 
of people in the terrorist ranks. 
It has become clear that the shock 
troops of subversion are not the har-
dened guerrillas of the Latin Ameri-
can stereotype, but young people of 
the middle class. They are youths in 
'their 20s recruited by terrorist orga-
nizations while in their teens. 
They come from some of the most 
respected families. Among recent ex-
amples:

The current church-state cleavage in at least 
six nations reverses the positions of church-
men and governments. It is not lost on observ-
ers also that the governments in question are 
all rightist military regimes. 
The Catholic Church in Argentina, _Brazil, 
Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay is on 
the liberal side, the state on the conservative, 
even reactionary side � although the dispute is 
not being stated in such terms. 
Part of the confrontation involves a new 
militancy on the part of the churchmen who 
believe they have the right, even the duty, to 
speak out on national issues, particularly those 
relating to human rights and political liberties. 
This certainly is the case in Chile where the 
Roman Catholic hierarchy is increasingly op-
posed to the hard-line, conservative tactics of 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet Ugarte's military domi-
nated government. 
Chile's influential Raill Cardinal Silva 
Henrfiquez, the Archbishop of Santiago and 
Chile's leading churchman, has frequently tan-
gled with General Pinochet. While he has tried 
to keep the dispute out of _public view, their 
disagreements are becoming common knowl, 
edge. 
Excommunication of four� Chileans, one of 
them a government official, for the airport ha-
rassment of three returning bishops was a 
clear sign of Cardinal -Silva Henrfiquez's atti-
tude. A statement, accompanying the ex-
communication order and issued with the Car-
dinal's approval, warned against he danger of 
abuses under the military regime and of "om-
"nipotent police state" governments across 
Latin America. 
That also seems the preoccupation of Dom 
Helder, the Brazilian bishop Who has long 
chafed under the restraints placed on him by 
The nephew of a .closely guard-
ed, high-ranking navy officer who 
furnished access to his uncle for 
young terrorist friends. They kid-
naped the officer and later killed him. 
�The son of a wealthy provincial 
governor, doing his compulsory 
miii-
tai'y service at an air force staff 
headquarters, who led a terrorist 
, band that ambushed and severely 
wounded the air force chief of per-
sonnel and his chauffeur. 
There has been a great deal of 
parental � anguish, and teen-agers 
have become the subject of a spate of 
I magazine articles, -newspaper series, 
television documentaries and public 
seminars. 
All seek to learn what drives 
young people to get involved with an 
extremist organization of the far 
Left. Neither terrorism nor its appeal 
� to privileged youth is an exclusively 
Argentine phenomenon. But there 
; are few places where the movement

fellow churchmen who did not want to rock the 
boat of church-state relations in Brazil. But 
more and more bishops and archbishops in 
Brazil are protesting repressive measures by 
their country's military-dominated govern-
ment. 
\ This repression, often aimed at leftists, has 
meant large-scale abridegements of civil rights 
in the countries with military governments. 
Churchmen, meeting in Ecuador at the pas-
toral conference in Riobamba, were in fact dis-
cussing this issue � hence, the Ecuadorian 
Government charge that the conferees were 
engaged in subversive activities. 
An Ecuadorian Government source, explain-
ing the arrests and deportations of the foreign 
bishaps, said that "the clergy must abide by 
the laws of the nation and to question govern-
ment actions is a crime." 
This goes along with an Interior Ministry 
statement in Argentina, following the arrests 
in Ecuador: "When priests have been detained, 
it has been for fully justified reasons." 
. But churchmen, while not disagreeing with 
the philosophy that they are subject to arrest, 
argue that repressive military governments do 
not have legitimate cause for many of their ac-
tivities. 
This increasing social and political ori-
entation of the Roman Catholic :clergymen is 
what arouses the ire of governments, particu-
larly military regimes, and the outlook for the 
future is for increasing tension in church-state 
relations. . 
The reason is obvious. As archbishop 
Vicente Faustino Zazpe, of Santa Fe in Ar-
gentina said recently: "we [churchmen] have 
no intention of letting up on our social in-
volvement. 
!3-1,as been marked by such violence. 
Two groups have been operating in 
Arrntina since 1970, the People's 
� Revolutionary Army (called the ERP 
after its initials in Spanish) and the 
Montoneros, named for the bands of 
"patriotic irregulars" that roamed Ar-
gentina's pampa In the mid-19th-cen-
tory. 
The ERP is Marxist-Leninist, for-: 
.3tally allied with the United Secreta-
riat of the Fourth international in 
I Paris. The Montoneros are Peronist 
renegades with Marxist inclinations. 
The ERP, smaller, better organized 
and originally more effective _than 
the Montoneros, suffered a crippling 
setback recently with the death of its 
,top leaders, killed in confrontations 
with the authorities. - 
In fewer than eight months this 
year, the death toll of political vi-
olence has topped 850. 
In the search for motives, investi-
gators haVe traced the steps involved 
in recruiting middle-class teen-agers. 
The process generally follows a pattern like this: 
�Recruiters, including some teachers and student acti-
vists at high schools and universities; attempt to set 
potential .recruits against their parents, their society and 
the system through ideological argument. 
--Recruiters then try to separate the potential recruits 
from then. background, to get them somehow away from 
home. This is not easy in Argentina, where traditionally 
sons and daughters live at boom until marriage, even well 
into adulthood. But it can be done. Guerrilla bands are 
well sul)plisd with loot from kidnapings and robberies and 
can pi O\ idc housing and expense money for remits.

�Recruits are started along the road to commitment = 
through assignments to perform such tasks as handing 
out leaflets on street corners and in other public places. 
This is followed by hanging posters and painting slogans. 
�Promising recruits are then involved in some illegal 
acts�shoplifting, for example, graduating to burglary. 
�Assignment to an armed assault group is the final 
step. Once a recruit has taken part in a shooting incident, 
he or she is considered to have passed the point of no re-
turn. 
Coercion can be a factor, too. A 16-year-old high school 
boy told a reporter: 
"My dad switched me to a private school last year be-
cause there was Montonero indoctrination and training 
ping on (after classes at the public school). If you didn't 
'stay for indoctrination, you got beat up." 
Why the recruiters are able to subvert youngsters is 
another matter. The magazine Gente recently sponsored a 
seminar on the subject, with a broad cross section of mid-
dle-class parents taking part. 
The number, of theories put forth was almost equal to 
the nuMber of participants, but blame was placed gener-
ally on. two factors: some aspect. of home life and too 
.much leisure time and money for teen-agers. 
There was no agreement on just what might be wrong 
in the home: Some thought youngsters should be more 
tightly controlled; others thought controls should be loos-
ened; some thought parents did not make enough effort 
to understand their children; others thought parents were 
trying too hard to be their childrens' "friends." 
Moreover, it became clear that *while everyone was 
deeply concerned and groping for answers, no single an-
swer was likely to satisfy everyone. Some typical re-
sponses: 
Maria Antonieta Ingster, manager of a motion picture 
distribution firm�"I think the phenomenon is caused by 
'It's essential that parents know 
what their children are doing.' 
middle-class teen-agers having absolutely everything they , 
.want., causing them to be bored and wanting to draw at-
tention to themselves."

er of four teen-agers�"I attribute the problem exclusive-
ly to the moral formation within the home, complemented .

1 Regardless of how young Argentines are recruited into 
',.the guerrilla gangs, and regardless of the reasons, there is 
iid question about what they do once committed. The case 
/ of Ricardo Omar Snag could be typical. 
Six years ago Felipe Sapag, the wealthy governor of 
Neuquen. province in the Andean lakes region, told a 
magazine interviewer that one of his sons, Ricardo, then 
17, "is the family hippie who smiles only when he comes 
to me for money." 
Five years later Ricardo was serving as a conscript in a 
secretarial office at air force headquarters in Buenos 
Aires' having elected to do his year of compulsory service 
after college. 
Dec. 10, 1975, Maj. Gen. Aly L. I. Corbat, chief of air 
force personnel, and his 14-year-old son entered the gen-
eral's car in front of their suburban home. The son was 
going to school, the general to his office. ' 
Before the car could get under way it was attacked by 
terrorists, approaching in a station wagon and firing sub-
machine coins. � 
The chauffeur jumped from the general's car to try to 
defend his charges and was struck by the station wagon, 
suffering a shattered leg as well as multiple bullet 
wounds. Corbat was seriously wounded. The general's son 
was not injured although, according to an air force com-
munique, "the attackers threw a grenade against the gen-
eral's car in an effort to eliminate his son." 
The communique identifiedRicardo Omar Sapag as "the 
finger man and leader of the assault." He remains at large.

legislature refused to accept.
