 THE MINORITY-AREA POLICY OF COMMUNIST CHINA IN PERSPECTIVE
 I.  Introduction
 An estimated 35 to 4+0 million persons of China possess charac-
 teristics sufficiently different from the Han Chinese* to be classified
 as minorities.  The largest concentrations of minority peoples occur
 in the frontier areas of northwestern and southwestern China.  Politi-
 cally, the three most important groups are the Mongols, Tibetans, and
 Muslims, of which some have traditionally maintained varying degrees
 of independence from the Central Government.  Numerous aboriginal
 groups also inhabit southwestern China, where many of them have until
 recently lived in isolation and seclusion from the Chinese.  The major
 conflicts between minority groups and the Chinese that have occurred
 in the past were caused chiefly by the encroachment of Chinese
 agriculturists on areas traditionally inhabited by minorities and
 by attempts to secure political control over minority areas by every
 Chinese Government in the past.
 In Communist attempts to secure control of the minority-inhabited
 frontier areas, the most striking feature of the early effort was the
 unprecedented speed with which these areas were brought under the
 *"Han" means Chinese by culture and language.

 domination of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  Thereafter, the
 most striking development has been the effectiveness with which "local
 and regional autonomy for minorities," has been implemented as a
 comprehensive program of administrative control.  Each autonomous
 unit is fitted closely within and subordinated to the Chinese Communist
 administrative system at an appropriate level.  The degree of
 independence allowed an autonomous unit, however, is slight.  It is
 under the jurisdiction of an ordinary people's government (by
 definition a Chinese body), from which it receives "leadership" and
 "guidance."
 Autonomy is not granted merely at the desire of the local
 inhabitants.  Its implementation has always been preceded by a
 preparatory period -- sometimes prolonged -- of intense political
 indoctrination by specially trained cadres (government or party
 functionaries).*  The selection, nurture, and correction of this
 group -- in particular those cadres of non-Ran Chinese origins --
 is of immense importance to the Chinese Communists.  Propaganda
 materials dealing with or directed at this group which have appeared
 in the press provide a little insight into the workings of the
 program, and were the chief source for the analysis that follows.
 *In translations of Chinese Communist press materials, the
 word "cadre" is used in the singular and normally refers to one
 person only.

 II.  Progress Toward the Unified State
 Since 1954, when the last CIA map of "autonomous" administrative
 units in Communist China (Map 13517) was published, the administrative
 structure set up to implement the autonomy concept has moved from
 what might be called a romantic youthful stage, which was designed to
 appeal to local aspirations of non-Han peoples concentrated in various
 parts of China; through a more intense mature stage, in which the
 nationality cadres emerged as an actively participating force in
 local government; into a repressive third stage, which cannot yet be
 fully characterized.
 During the first stage, lasting from 1952 into 1955, the
 rudimentary forms of tzu-chih ch'U (autonomous areas) were in vogue;
 but nationality cadres (government or party functionaries) probably
 played a definitely subordinate part in their administration.  Since
 several useful studies of developments in this stage are readily
 available, only a few selected aspects of the historical background
 are referred to in this article.
 The second or mature phase extended from 1955 to early 1958.
 It was characterized by territorial expansion of many of the previously
 existing units and rise in status of most.  Virtually all of the
 tzu-chih ch'U, as they met the preconditions for formal autonomy
 (land reform, cadre readiness, mass acceptance), were elevated to
 the status of autonomous hsien (counties) or chou (districts).

 The changes in numbers and administrative status of autonomous
 administrative units during the past 6 years are given in Table 1,
 which shows clearly the 1955 break.    The degree of territorial expansion
 of "autonomous" administrative units during the second phase of policy
 development will emerge when Map 26970 (now in preparation) is compared
 with the 1954 map.
 The third phase apparently began in early 1958 after the
 promulgation at the end of 1957 of a harder Party line, which was
 closely geared to the much-publicized Rectification Movement of
 1957-58.  As it was implemented in the minorities problem the new
 line stresses the obligations of minorities to the country and
 deemphasized the significance of national differences.  During this
 third stage, the position of national minorities may decline further
 in political importance as the country becomes more deeply involved
 in communalization.  Certainly, never before have the ultimate
 objectives of the Communist regime been stressed with such consistent
 candor as at present.  This new and harsher phase is based on the
 considerable achievement in constructing an administrative machine
 and in building up reliable local cadres during the past 8 years of
 organizational effort, when softer treatment was the rule.
 The percentages of the minority peoples living under local
 autonomy as of November 1958 are indicated by Table 2.  At that time
 the regime claimed that over 90 percent of the people of 36 minority
 nationalities living in compact communities were living under adminis-

 trative autonomy.  Slightly over 1 percent of the minority population
 had become reliable cadres and party members by early 1958, as com-
 pared with 2 percent for all Communist China.  Party membership is
 further increased by the large numbers of Han cadres posted to minority
 areas.  Thus the political grip of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
 on the minority areas is becoming increasingly firm.
 Tibet remains an exceptional area.  There, preparations for the
 switch from genuine autonomy in the sense of self-determination to
 "autonomy" in the sense of self-administration have been greatly slowed
 by the postponement of the reform of the social system until 1963.
 After a full generation of institution building, during which
 the approach to minorities was worked out, the 38-year-old CCP now
 stands on the eve of its tenth anniversary in power.  It is difficult
 to dismiss its long-standing regional autonomy policy for minorities
 as a simple facade for totalitarian rule.  The concept of adminis-
 trative autonomy is now becoming institutionalized as a mode of
 administrative control.  It provides, within the framework of regional
 autonomy, an orderly and equitable basis for effective administration.*
 *It would go beyond the scope of this article to examine the
 special features of revenue, disbursement, and budgeting procedures
 under local autonomy, or their political significance.  A new set
 of provisional rules for local finance in national autonomous areas
 (State Council, 13 June 1958) decrees a slightly greater degree of
 financial decentralization and self-sufficiency than that decreed
 for other local areas (State Council, 15 November 1957).

 III.  Policy and Practice at the Province Level
 A.         Theory
 Some of the intra-Party discussion of autonomous-area policy
 that was publicized during the early months of 1958 revolved around
 matters of definition and delimitation which merit brief review.  A
 nationality has recently been defined as "a body of people living in
 a common area, historically formed, with a common language, a common
 economic life, and a common psychology."*  Few groups, however, possess
 all of these attributes.
 In the case of the Chinese Moslems (Hui), several of the criteria
 had to be stretched.  For the most part, the Hui are well Sinicized
 but more illiterate than their Han counterparts.  Religion, therefore,
 forms the logical basis for the definition of this group, which requires
 separate treatment for such practical reasons as their uncooperative
 personal and social behavior and their turbulent history as a minority.
 Although the Hui were officially estimated at 5 to 6 million in 1952,
 the 1953 census gave their number as only 3.6 million.
 An example of redefinition of a minority group involves the
 merging of three groups -- known hitherto as Solun, Tungus, and
 Yakut -- under a new label, Evenki (0-wen-k'o).  The Soluns of the
 vicinity of Hailar in northwestern Manchuria are a Tungusic tribe
 speaking a Manchu-related dialect and resembling Mongols.  Historically

 they were a stalwart limb of the Manchu Federation; and, hitherto,
 their name was assigned to a banner (chi) within the Inner Mongolian
 Autonomous Region (IMAR).  In 1958 the 4,900 Soluns were combined
 with 1,205 Tungus and 137 Yakuts to form a new "nationality" banner --
 the O-wen-k'o Autonomous Ch'i.  Meanwhile the Soluns in the Ili Valley
 of Sinkiang have dropped out of sight.  They may have become identified
 with their more numerous racial cousins the Sibos (Hsi-po) in their
 Chapchal Autonomous Hsien, whose number increased from 9,000 two
 decades ago to almost 20,000 in 1958.
 One of the showcase features of autonomy is the encouragement
 given to the use of local languages in areas where the study and use
 of Chinese would present a hardship for cadres and populace and hamper
 achievement of political goals.  By the end of 1958, 1 central and 10
 local nationality publishing houses had been established and were
 publishing books.and other materials in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uighur,
 Miao, I, Chuang, Pu-yi, Korean, Kazakh, Thai, Kawa, Ha-ni, Li, Khalkha
 (Kirghiz), Li-su, La-hu, Ching-po, and Salar.  The CCP organ Red Flag
 is now published in 4 minority languages -- Mongolian, Tibetan, Uighur,
 and Korean -- as well as in Chinese.
 The geographical requisite for the granting of local or regional
 autonomy to a people is its effective settlement and occupation of
 enough territory to form a conspicuous concentration of settlement.
 This elusive concept does not require numerical preponderance, since
 other peoples may be more numerous but more scattered.   In practice,

 a nationality group honored with autonomy is likely to be either
 (1) a majority in its own area, even though the group is much more
 numerous but less concentrated outside or (2) mostly included within
 its own autonomous area but as a minority within the total population.
 The generalizations discussed are illustrated by the current situations
 in the four province-level autonomous regions of Communist China.
 B.  The Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region
 In the former Kwangsi Province, for example (Map 27550), the
 West Kwangsi Autonomous Area (KCAR) was first organized for the Chuang
 people in December 1952, with 34 hsien and 1 municipality.  It was
 enlarged in the following year to 42 hsien and in 1955 became a thou.
 In March 1958 the unit was further enlarged and elevated to provincial
 status as the Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region (KCAR), taking in all
 70 hsien of the former Kwangsi Province, and superseding that province.
 From being a 66 percent majority within the 42-county autonomous chou,
 the Chuang people become a minority of 37 percent within the autonomous
 region; only 5 percent of their total number, however, now remain
 outside the enlarged borders.
 Before the establishment of the KCAR, an ostentatious debate
 over unity versus partition of Kwangsi as a geographic entity was
 publicized and quickly resolved in favor of making the entire province
 the unit of regional autonomy for the Chuang.  Financial administration
 within the province was already difficult because the poorer and more
 sparsely-settled Chuang areas of western Kwangsi needed more supplementary

 funds for administration, education, and capital investment than did
 the better-favored eastern areas occupied by Chinese.  Unity perpetuated
 the maximum degree of economic self-sufficiency for the KCAR as a whole
 and probably served the best interests of the Chuang people themselves.
 C.  The Ningsia Hui Autonomous Region
 The Ningsia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR) illustrates a second
 type of situation and is of especial interest because it was so
 recently established -- on 24+ October 1958.  Its formation, which
 involved greater social and political difficulties, lagged behind
 that of the KCAR by 7 months.  Surprisingly, the NHAR was granted
 province-level status despite its small size, which would seem more
 appropriate to an autonomous thou (Map 27551).  The new region has a
 population of 1,822,000 and an area of 77,800 square kilometers, 11
 percent of which is cultivated.  It has only 3/4 the area of Chekiang,
 previously China's smallest province, only 1/13 its population, and
 is only 1/2 as extensively cultivated.  Of Communist China's autonomous
 chow, however, 8 are comparable in population, and at least 8 are of
 comparable size.
 The Hui, or Chinese Moslem, minority is in a class by itself
 for truculence and dispersion of settlement but has had close ties
 with the CCP for 20 years or more.  During this period, local autonomous
 administrations were established for the Hui in Kansu, old Ningsia,
 and Shantung.  Within the NHAR, anti-Chinese sentiment persists at
 the community level, and mutual contempt and distrust are deeply rooted.

 Two village-scale "uprisings" or riots occurred within the last year --
 one on 1 June 1958, involving two localities in the southeastern
 portions of the new Region, and the other on 4 April in the nearby
 Chang-chia-ch'uan Hui Autonomous Hsien.
 The delimitation of the NHAR was difficult.  To make the new
 region a rational geographic unit, it was given as its core area the
 irrigated agricultural lands of the Yin-ch'uan--Wu-chung Basin and
 the Hui-inhabited highland areas to the southeast, extending to within
 20 kilometers of P'ing-liang Shih, the seat of the special district
 for easternmost Kansu.  Only half of the 1,200,000* Hui in Kansu were
 taken into the jurisdiction of the NHAR; those left out include an
 estimated 80,000 in the adjacent Ping-liang area, 100,000 in the
 nearby Chang-chia-ch'uan Hui Autonomous Hsien and 320,000 in the more
 distant Lin-hsia Hui Autonomous Chou on the south side of the Kansu
 Corridor.  According to the official explanation, P'ing-liang Shih
 and its environs could not be included in the NHAR without depriving
 the P'ing-liang Special District of its "cultural and economic center,"
 nor the Chang-chia-ch'uan Hui Autonomous Hsien without bisecting Kansu.
 Another factor, candidly stated and possibly decisive, was that "more
 time is needed for the complete elimination of the national differences"
 in the P'ing-liang area -- admission that anti-Chinese feeling there
 apparently remains explosively strong.

 D.        The Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region
 A third type of situation in which definition and delineation
 becomes complex is illustrated by the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous
 Region (SUAR).  Within the province as a whole the Uighurs have a
 75 percent population majority.  They have an almost total predominance
 in the southwestern half of the province, and are also found in many
 parts of northern Sinkiang.  In the SUAR the political interests of
 non-Uighurs are formally recognized in 11 autonomous chou and hsien,
 at least 7 of which show the familiar population-proportion anomalies.
 Only the inconspicuous Tajiks in their remote Tashkurghan Tajik
 Autonomous Hsien in the far southwest and the formidable Kazakhs in
 their vast Ili Kazakh Autonomous Chou on the northwestern frontier
 have numerical preponderance and numerical majority of their respective
 nationalities within their autonomous units.
 The Kazakhs have been further recognized by the creation of two
 other autonomous hsien in the eastern part of the SUAR.  No other
 nationality group in Sinkiang has been handled more circumspectly
 than the Kazakhs since the completion of its sanguinary conquest by
 the Peoples Liberation Army in 1952.  The regime's present leniency
 toward the Kazakhs has the earmarks of sound expediency, since the
 subjugation of no other people except the Tibetans has cost the
 Chinese Communists greater effort and since the largely nomadic
 Kazakhs still remain sensitive to developments in the Russian sphere
 of Kazakhstan, where the majority of their people live.  The remaining

 bonds of mutual sympathy with the Kazakhs of the USSR are probably
 both a theoretical help and a practical hazard to Chinese Communist
 administration along the strategic Kazakh segment of the China-USSR
 border, since it complicates the problem of controlling the traditional
 hostility of the Kazakhs toward the Chinese.  Recent indications
 suggest that greater conformity and sterner treatment will be the
 future lot of the Sinkiang Kazakhs.  Several of their leading cadres
 have recently been purged, and the Kazakhs have been publicly reminded
 that their anti-Chinese excesses during the revolutionary regime of
 1944-48 still sully their record.
 E.  The Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region
 Differing from the other three autonomous units at province
 level is the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region (IMAR).  As it is
 currently delimited, the Mongols are outnumbered by the Chinese by
 more than 7 to 1.  The region itself is not a single potential economic
 unit (as it should be in the Communist scheme) but includes three
 economic areas.*   Historic, cultural, physiographic, and strategic
 factors, however, give the IMAR some degree of physical and social
 unity.  The region was founded in 1947 -- 2 years before the PRC
 itself.  It is the catch-all for all the nonagricultural desert and
 semidesert areas of the northwest border from Sinkiang to the Amur,
 and includes those parts of traditional Manchuria that are sparsely

 populated by Tungusic groups.  In the past, nomadic herding and
 hunting at a subsistence level were the normal way of life throughout
 most of this vast region, which insulated China from Outer Mongolia.
 The agricultural areas along the southern margins have always been
 highly vulnerable to the vagaries of climate and to political strife.
 With the introduction of industrialization into the agricultural
 areas, the borders of the IMAR are becoming less relevant and further
 revisions would not be surprising.
 IV.  The Pattern and Objectives of Recent Developments
 The new hard policy toward minorities that came into effect
 after November 1957 represents a definite change of direction, and
 not merely another passing phase.  It is not a question of failure
 of the more indulgent policy of the past; probably, having served
 its purposes, it had simply become. outmoded.  For 8 years, through
 a variety of appeals, the sympathies of minority populations were
 courted, and the Han cadres were under almost continual criticism
 for unsympathetic ("chauvinistic") attitudes.   In the present phase,
 by contrast, the minorities cadres have come under severe attack for
 excessive loyalty to the minority group and its interests ("local
 nationalism") and for related conservative and negative sentiments
 which for purposes of censure have been called "anti-Han" and "anti-Party".
 A.  Thwarted Nationalistic Ambitions
 The attacks on the nationality cadres mesh closely with the
 present overall objective of total participation by minorities in
 Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000300080002-3
 Approved For ReleaseS2       B8T CIA-RDP79-01005A000300080002-3
 the construction of a Communist state, regardless of obstacles.  Any
 effort to mitigate the forcible break-up of old societies in South
 China or to temper the impact of Chinese immigratio$ on the industrially
 backward minority-occupied territories of the north must now meet the
 test of whether or not such effort would hinder China's metamorphosis
 into a socialized, industrial nation.
 Some high-ranking nationalities cadres lingered too long over
 the problems of adapting administrative autonomy to the existing
 patterns of dispersion and intermingling of peoples, and consequently
 were censured as deviationists.  Several types of deviation of which
 these nationality cadres were allegedly guilty were defined.  One was
 attempting to expand autonomous areas and increase their administrative
 powers.  Another was support of the once-encouraged principle of
 more-or-less proportional representation in local government and
 on local committees ("nationalization of cadres").  This principle
 was set aside since, under the guidance of a new generation of local
 leadership by Party members of local origin,* it might become the
 first step toward resurgent self-determination of nationalities.
 *The language of the warnings to nationalities cadres suggests
 strongly that the emphasis was more on thoughts and suppressed aspi-
 rations than on deeds.  The primary target was those people who
 permitted themselves to display "a pessimistic attitude . . . toward
 the Han Chinese cadres and the resettlement of Han Chinese .  .  ., a
 love for the old, backward things and a fear for the new, advanced
 things .  .  . [and a desire] to set up Party organizations according
 to the nationality status .    . and discriminate against the Party
 members from outside, particularly those in charge of leadership."

 Among the Miao, Yi, and Tung of the south, and among the Mongols
 of the north, for example, there were apparently some who proposed
 regroupings and boundary realignments into larger units of higher
 status.  One of these was the vice-governor of Kweichow, who was
 accused in late 1957 of having "plotted to place the provinces of
 Hunan, Szechwan, Kweichow, and Kwangsi under his thumb" within a new
 autonomous region.  Possibly he may merely have wanted to improve
 upon the fragmented pattern of small autonomous units which characterized
 all of South China prior to the establishment of Kwangsi as the KCAR.
 In the IMAR, on the other hand, certain leaders were criticized
 for having proposed a division into Mongolian and Han areas, and the
 resettlement within the strictly Mongolian area of Mongolians from
 the present mixed areas.  Among the grievances of the so-called local
 nationalists in the IMAR is the growing preponderance of the Chinese
 which increased from 3:1 in 1953 to 7:1 by 1957 through immigration
 and boundary extensions, and is expected to reach 10:1 in the foreseeable
 future.  The answer to the local nationalists in the IMAR left them
 with little hope for the future.   China's highest-ranking minority
 cadre, Ulanfu, a Mongol by heritage, told them:   "We Communists hold
 that nationalities .  .  . run their own course of genesis, development,
 decline and death."   Within the next 4 years, all Mongolians in the
 IMAR are scheduled for permanent settlement.  At present only 8,000
 households are still nomadic, and 25,000 seminomadic -- probably 200,000
 individuals out of a total Mongol population in the IMAR of over
 1,100,000.  The threat to the traditional Mongol way of life, however,

 is partly tempered by a recently announced decision to stress intensive
 agriculture, at the expense of extensive, within the IMAR and thus
 release marginal agricultural land for pasture and fodder crops.  This
 decision may help preserve the pastoral areas by rolling back the
 agricultural frontier.
 In the Greater Khingan Mountains area, the Tahur (Daghor) minority
 of 40,000 is divided almost equally between the IMAR and Heilungkiang.
 In Lung-chiang Hsien of Heilungkiang, an autonomous subdistrict was
 established for the Tahur in 1952.  In 1958, their leaders in the IMAR
 were found guilty of "local nationalism" when they requested establish-
 ment of an autonomous chou, whereas the IMAR Party Committee had already
 resolved to limit the Tahur to an autonomous ch'i, at the hsien (county)
 level.  Within the boundaries of the new autonomous ch'i only 14,000
 Tahur are included -- only 22 percent of the total ch'i population of
 64,ooo.
 The complaint of the Manchus is lack of recognition as a
 nationality group by the regime.  Although thoroughly Sinicized,
 the Manchus are historically distinct and in many places continue to
 live in separate communities and think of themselves as Manchus.  Alone
 among the larger minority groups, they are conspicuously lacking in
 autonomous units above the township (hsiang) level, despite their 2.4
 million population.  Manchus number some 640,000 in Heilungkiang alone.

 complained that "the brilliant light of the party's nationalities
 policy has not shone on the Manchu people."  Of 49 nationality hsiang
 established in Heilungkiang prior to February 1957, only 2 were
 Manchu.*
 B.  Rejection of the Pattern Established by the USSR
 The common denominator for most of these examples of thwarted
 nationalistic aspirations appears to be the desire on the part of
 nationalities cadres for further development and expansion of the
 autonomy concept and, in direct opposition, the intent of the CCP
 to hold the line against over-expansion of autonomy.  To hold this line,
 the strongest argument of local nationalists -- the constitutional
 precedent set by the USSR -- had to be refuted.  In order to emphasize
 that the right of national self determination, which is accepted in
 form in the USSR and expressed in a federal state organization, is
 completely unpalatable to the PRC, party spokesmen and apologists
 laid great stress on the unitary state organization of China as the
 basic principle of the constitution of the Peoples Republic of China.
 Thus, in 1957 and 1958, to advocate self-determination for nationalities
 and to hark back to the older Soviet model of "federal republics"
 became deviationist, antiproletarian, and anti-socialistic.**

 The potentially embarrassing differences in viewpoint and polity
 are not surprising when the lesser importance of minority people in
 Chinese national life is recognized.  Of the total Chinese population,
 94 percent is Han Chinese.  The remaining 6 percent (35 to 40 million
 people) belongs to about 49 groups defined as minorities and is spread
 over 55 to 60 percent of China -- in Tibet, the Chang-tuArea, Sinkiang,
 Tsinghai, Inner Mongolia, and large parts of other provinces, including
 Szechwan, Yunnan, Kweichow, Kwangsi, and ICansu.  Some 'of these areas
 contain resources essential to the economic development of the PRC,
 and in some areas the intensive development of these resources has
 begun.  Nevertheless the areas occupied by minorities are generally
 marginal to the economic heartland of China, which is centered in
 Southern Manchuria and in the lowlands of Central and Northern China.
 Only the Chinese Moslems, or Hui, have become widely dispersed within
 this area.  Since the minorities have a low potential for genuinely
 autonomous political existence, it is both understandable and
 strategically desirable for the Chinese Communists to define their
 nation as a unified state, of which the territories of minority
 peoples are inalienable parts.
 The population of the USSR, in contrast, is more heterogeneous.
 The leading group, the Great Russians, constituted only 53 percent of
 the population in 1926.  The three dominant peoples -- Great Russians,
 Ukrainians, and Belorussians -- together constituted only 77 percent
 of the population, and a total of 87 percent of the population belonged

 to no less than 11 nationality groups which were historically associated
 with European Russia.*  The structure of the Soviet Union reflects this
 situation.  It is theoretically a voluntary union of republics -- each
 of which nominally retains the right of secession.  The formal
 legislative function is bicamerally divided between the Soviet of the
 Union and the Soviet of Nationalities.
 Even the original revolutionary leadership reflects the differences
 between the USSR and the PRC.  The top leadership of the CCP is almost
 entirely Han Chinese whereas, among the old Bolsheviks, such homogeneity
 was lacking from the start, with Lenin a Mordvian, Trotsky and others
 Jewish, and Stalin a Georgian.
 It was quite natural for the CCP, once in power, to turn its
 back on the classic Soviet formulas for the government of minority
 nationalities.  From self-determination of nationalities, the watchword
 of the PRC after the takeover became solidarity among nationalities.
 The candid elaboration of this issue is a strong indication that the
 PRC has permanently reversed its nationalities policy.  The case of
 the dissenting comrades was far from weak.  They could cite not only
 the Soviet example in proof of their own orthodoxy but also the
 historic CCP commitments to some form of self-determination for
 minorities, which dated from 1922 to at least 1945, the date of

 Mao Tse-tung's report "On Coalition Government".  Finally, some

 of their own loyalty to the CCP long before victory was assured.*
 V.  Prospects
 From the viewpoint of Western strategists, the minorities of
 Communist China represent a real, albeit diminishing, weakness in the
 organizational framework of the country and a potential source of
 embarrassing doctrinal difference between China and the USSR.  With
 a few exceptions however, notably Tibet, the geographic distribution
 of the minorities and formidable linguistic barriers will make Western
 exploitation of this vulnerability extremely difficult.
 The social sifting that the Chinese people have been enduring
 since the war-induced migrations began more than 2 decades ago is
 reaching a climax in the current phase of communal collectivization.
 The minorities have become increasingly involved in the larger program
 as the regime's nationalities policy has brought them, step by step,
 in the direction of political and social communization.  As long as
 the. central government of the PRC remains strong, it is unlikely that
 the weak and outnumbered minorities of China (excepting the Tibetans)
 can long resist final, crippling overhaul of their original institutions
 *Some Tibetans, Hui, Mongols, and Koreans have served the CCP for
 20 years or more, and Hui autonomous areas at the township level were
 being organized as early as 1942.  See State, Hong Kong, Survey of

 and attitudes.  They are apparently destined to become whatever the
 Chinese people become in the next few years, unless some new resistance
 element enters the picture,
 There is a possibility, however, that nationalities cadres as
 such may be developing an incipient sense of mutual interest among
 themselves that transcends their concern for the specific minority
 groups they represent.  This is suggested by the many recent warnings
 to the larger minorities against the display of anti-Han attitudes
 and by the new trend in the education of nationalities cadres.  In
 early 1958, the deans of the several nationalities colleges, at the
 direction of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, decided to abandon
 the stress on national consciousness ("patriotism" and "nationalities
 solidarity") which had characterized their work of the previous 8
 years.  They decided, instead, to stress proletarianization ("class
 education") and the inevitability of ultimate denationalization
 ("Marxist-Leninist view of nationalities").  This new stand reflects
 the familiar Communist ideal of proletarian assimilation into an
 ultimately classless, homogenized, internationalist society in which
 all nationality loyalties are finally submerged.   It also suggests
 that the institution of local and regional autonomy for minority
 nationalities, as now established in Communist China, is not designed
 to be a permanent structure.  Changes and revisions will undoubtedly
 continue.  The present situation may represent virtually the maximum
 territorial extent of autonomous administrative units.

 Under the assimilative pressures now being imposed upon them,
 probably only a few of some of the larger, more virile, or more
 adaptable minority groups -- such as the Kazakhs, Tibetans, or Hui --
 will be able to retain some intrinsic integrity.  Contacts between
 nationalities cadres, however, will multiply in schools, committees,
 and conferences.  It is these men who are the core of potential
 resistance to total conformity and assimilation. The more capable
 they are, the more hope there is that mutual sympathy may develop
 and perhaps survive, and that a new sense of identity among cadres
 from previously dissimilar peoples may make them a perceptible
 political force within the framework of the PRC itself.   (OFFICIAL

 FINLAND STRADDLES THE IRON CURTAIN
 The strategic importance of Finland lies in its unique position
 geographically, politically,, and economically.  It is a land bridge
 between the Soviet Union and the Scandinavian Peninsula (see Map
 27553).   So far, Finland has survived as a free nation despite its
 adverse strategic location on the periphery of the USSR and is the
 only European state bordering the Soviet Union that is outside the
 Iron Curtain (if the northern tip of Norway is excluded).  The northern
 third of Finland lies beyond the Arctic Circle but Helsinki, on the
 southern coast at approximately 600 north latitude, is closer to
 Moscow than any other non-Communist capital.  Finland's position
 means its probable involvement ii. any conflict in which its neighbors
 might engage, since the country's lifeline can be cut by the closing
 of the Baltic Sea or the blockading of Finnish ports.   It is evident
 that Soviet control of Finland would give the USSR an additional
 foothold on the shores of the Baltic and the Gulf of Finland.   Recent
 Soviet propaganda aimed at the creation of a Baltic "sea of peace"
 has been viewed with alarm by all the Scandinavian countries as an
 attempt by the USSR to make the Baltic a "Russian lake."  The
 recurring tragedy of Finland is that as a frontier state, with a
 790-mile common border with the USSR, it has been subjected to the

 alternate control of Eastern and Western Europe and has been used
 by the Russians as a buffer against the West.
 The land frontier of Finland has been described as "geographically
 demilitarized," its very nature being a deterrent to any large-scale
 conventional military campaign.  The extensive forests, combined
 with the countless lakes and swamps, have played a significant
 defensive role, especially in summer.  They have provided this low-
 lying country with an eastern barrier more effective in some ways
 than a mountain range.
 Since the end of World War II, one of the cornerstones of
 Finnish policy has been to avoid provoking the Soviets.  Such a
 policy has been part of the price of a precarious national survival,
 but it has succeeded largely because it suited Soviet purposes
 to leave Finland free politically but closely linked to the Soviet
 bloc economically.  As an economic unit, Finland had been oriented
 to western markets until the Moscow settlement of 1944 saddled the
 country with heavy reparations, the problem of resettling the entire
 population of the ceded territories (see Map 27553), and the re-
 construction of devastated Lapland.  Finland not only lost about
 12 percent of its prewar territory to the Soviet Union but also some
 of its most valuable economic assets, which were included in this
 territory.   In the southeast, Finland lost the greater part of
 Finnish Karelia, including large tracts of the best forest, fertile
 agricultural land, and nearly one-third of the country's harnessed

 waterpower.  This area also included more than one-tenth of the
 industrial facilities of the country and the vital port of Viipuri
 (Vyborg). In the north, it lost valuable nickel mines -- the largest
 in Europe -- and the ice-free Arctic port of Petsamo (Pechanga).
 Despite this severe blow to its economy, Finland met all of its
 wartime obligations by the end of 1952.*
 At the end of the Winter War of 1939-4+0 the USSR leased the
 winter port of Hanko (Swedish, Hang3) for a 30-year period, thus
 realizing in part the long-standing Soviet desire for ice-free ports
 and naval bases.  Later, as a result of the Finnish defeat in World
 War II, Finland was forced to grant the Soviet Union a 50-year lease
 on the Porkkala Peninsula, to be used as a naval base; but at the
 same time the Soviet Union renounced its lease of the peninsula of
 Hanko.  The fact that Porkkala was also returned to the Finns in
 1956 even though it guarded the sea approaches to the important
 industrial complex of Leningrad, was probably motivated by the Soviet
 premise that in the present nuclear and missile age Porkkala may have
 lost some of its military and strategic value.  As a part of the
 postwar settlement with the Soviet Union the Finns were forced to
 construct the Salla railroad from Kemijarvi to the frontier railhead
 It is estimated that between 194+ and 1952 shipments of timber
 and woodworking products, locomotives, ships, electric-cable products,
 machinery, and other equipment from Finland to the USSR for war repar-
 ations amounted to $226,500,000 computed in U.S. dollars at pre-World
 War II value.

 at Kelloselka.  This single-track line, which has the same broad-gauge
 (5'0") as Soviet lines, connects with the Murmansk railroad south of
 Kandalaksha, in the USSR.  The Salla railroad provides the Soviet
 Union with a continuous route from its own rail net to Tornio on the
 Swedish border, a strategic outlet to the Gulf of Bothnia (see Map
 27553).
 Forest industries, agriculture, and -- since World War II --
 heavy metallurgical industry are all important elements of the Finnish
 economy.  For a long time, however, Finland has depended largely
 upon its forests.  Although wartime negotiations and the Peace Treaty
 of 194+7 deprived Finland of much of its best wooded area, forest
 acreage in Finland still is surpassed in Europe only by acreages in
 the USSR and in Sweden.  Some 71 percent of Finland is covered by
 forests (see Map 27553), the highest percentage of any European
 country.  Pine predominates, providing nearly a half of the total
 timber stand; spruce furnishes about a third, and birch one-fifth.
 Lumbering and logging give winter employment to a large number of small
 farmers and agricultural workers; and the sale of pulpwood, pit props,
 poles, and timber brings in a sizeable income.  Thus, the forest not
 only is the chief natural resource of the country but also is its
 "green gold," the main source of wealth.  Most important of all, the
 output of the wood-processing industries -- pulp, cellulose, plywood,
 wallboard, cardboard, prefabricated houses, and newsprint -- constitutes
 one-third of the total industrial production and provides employment
 for approximately one-quarter of the workers.

 Two-thirds of the Finnish population lives in rural areas, but
 only one-third obtains its livelihood from farming.  The cultivated
 area covers less than 10 percent of the land; and, since the climate
 is best suited to the growing of fodder crops, animal husbandry predomi-
 nates.  Hay and oats are by far the main crops, followed by rye,
 wheat, barley, and potatoes.  Three-fourths of the value of the
 agricultural output is derived from dairy products and pork.  As in
 other Scandinavian countries, most Finnish farms include adjacent
 woods large enough to provide fuel and also timber for building
 needs (see Map 27553).
 Having no coal or oil of its own, Finland, like Norway and
 Sweden, has turned to waterpower.  Even though the Soviet Union
 acquired one-third of Finland's hydroelectric plants through annexation,
 the Finns now produce a great deal more hydroelectric power than
 before World War II -- and only one-third of the potential waterpower
 has been harnessed.  Many factories and some of the steam locomotives,
 however, still burn wood as fuel; and a large part of the total
 cuttings from the forests is consumed in heating homes and buildings.
 Finland imports about 2-1/2 million tons of coal annually, the major
 part of which (about 1,500,000 tons) comes from Poland.   In the past,
 oil imports were supplied by the West, but in recent years the bloc
 countries have provided an increasing share of the expanding re
 quirements; the Soviet Union alone supplied more than 1 million tons
 of petroleum products in 1958.   Since the loss of the nickel mines,

 copper is the only mineral resource of major importance in Finland
 and the Outokumpu copper mine is the most important mining operation
 in the country.  In Europe (excluding Soviet bloc countries) the
 copper production of Finland is surpassed only by that of Yugoslavia.
 Although industries are scattered throughout central and
 northern Finland, their density is greater south of a line drawn
 from the town of Kokkola on the Gulf of Bothnia to Jyvaskyla and
 continuing in a southeasterly direction to Imatra close to the
 Soviet border.  By far the most industrialized part of this southern
 area lies south of a line drawn from Pori through Tampere to the
 Kymi Valley region; and within this area the Helsinki-Turku-Tampere
 triangle forms the most highly industrialized complex in Finland.
 In general, the industries are located adjacent to existing railroads
 mainly on the coast and the shores of rivers and lakes.
 Since the basic economy of Finland is centered on the two chief
 natural resources -- forests and hydroelectric power -- the country,
 before World War II, had been geared to the export of forest products,
 both raw and finished.  One of the worst aspects of the war indemnity
 for the Finns, however, was that they were required to pay so much of
 it not in forest products but in ships and machinery, which had never
 before been included in their major industrial output for export.  In
 order to meet Soviet demands, Finland had to expand manufacturing not
 connected with wood, and to build up an entirely new machine and
 shipbuilding industry (see Map 27553), which it did not need and

 which eventually upset its economy.  The expansion of the newly
 established heavy manufacturing industries has been most significant --
 particularly the expansion of the metal industry, which has become
 the largest in Finland and which in 1952, when the indemnities had
 been paid off, employed about one-third of all industrial workers.
 This growing industry turns out ships, locomotives, railway cars,
 motors, complete woodworking plants, powerplants, electronic gear,
 and hundreds of different kinds of machines.  Altogether the metal
 industry accounts for a little more than a quarter of the total
 industrial production.
 Among Finland's important trading partners, the USSR normally
 ranks below the countries of Western Europe.  In 1953, however, the
 Soviet Union for the first time in history temporarily replaced Great
 Britain as Finland's best customer.  Between 1950 and 1957 the
 proportion of the total trade that was conducted with the Soviet
 bloc rose from 19 to 29 percent.  Finland is therefore extremely
 vulnerable to Soviet economic. pressure.  During the last few months
 of 1958, such pressure mounted considerably as evidenced by the
 cancellation of large orders of wood and metal products from Finnish
 manufacturers.  The largest shipyard in Finland was forced to close
 when the Soviet Union canceled orders for a 22,000-horsepower
 icebreaker, two 8,500-ton freighters, and several small ships that
 had kept the shipyard busy.  Moscow also canceled orders for paper
 and other goods "not yet boxed for delivery."  Negotiations for a

 Finnish-Soviet trade agreement for 1959 were suspended, and Satellite
 trade with Finland was curtailed.  Hungary reportedly issued instructions
 for the diversion of its timber purchases from Finland to Austria.
 East German-Finnish trade talks were delayed, and Communist China
 postponed its annual Finnish trade negotiations.  Finland's troubles
 were further aggravated by a trade surplus with Moscow, which developed
 because of a new payments system for the purchase of ships and because
 of a limited market in Finland for Soviet autos, canned vegetables,
 crab meat, and caviar -- the only items that the USSR will sell to
 the Finns in quantity.  Meanwhile, a Finnish offer to buy more coal,
 oil, and gasoline was rejected.  On 23 January 1959, however, it was
 officially announced from Leningrad that the USSR and Finland would
 resume the trade negotiations broken off in the fall of 1958 and that
 a long-term trade agreement linking Finland's postwar factories with
 the new Soviet Seven-Year Plan probably would be drawn up in the spring.
 Since the Sino-Soviet bloc is the major purchaser of many
 Finnish products, trade with the East is mandatory if Finland is to
 alleviate its critical unemployment problem.  Because of the decrease
 in exports and a slackening in building construction, approximately
 80,000 workers were unemployed at the end of 1958.  This is the
 highest number of jobless workers since the 1930's and the situation
 usually becomes worse in the spring, in part because thawing weather
 affects the lumbering industry and in part because of other seasonal
 factors.  A total of 100,000 unemployed can be expected by March 1959

 unless the recently signed trade agreement helps solve the unemployment
 problem.  It is estimated that 6.3 percent of the male working
 population of Finland is now unemployed and that in part of northern
 Finland, which has been subject to chronic unemployment for some
 years, the ratio is as much as 17.7 percent.
 If the general drift of Finnish trade to the Soviet Union
 continues, there is danger of Finland becoming so economically
 dependent on her eastern neighbor that her political independence
 will be  critically  jeopardized.  Largely because of internal domestic
 problems, especially the increase in unemployment, the Communists
 emerged from the elections of July 1958 as the largest single party
 in the Finnish Parliament.  Gaining 7 seats, they now have a total
 of 50 or exactly a quarter of all the seats in the Chamber.   Of the
 7 parties taking part in the elections the Communist Party polled
 1+20,803 votes or 23.7 percent of the popular ballot, and they
 therefore agitated for a left-wing coalition government.  The complete
 absence of Communists in the newly formed Finnish Government, and the
 Soviet belief that it signified a new orientation in Finnish foreign
 policy, caused the Soviet reappraisal of trade negotiations and
 resultant economic pressure and led to the Finnish cabinet crisis
 of 4 December 1958.  This issue was temporarily resolved by the
 formation on 13 January 1959 of an Agrarian minority cabinet whose
 efforts will be directed toward improving foreign relations with the
 USSR.  Thus Finland has already paid a price for an economic truce.

 Despite the growing web of ties linking Finland to the Soviet
 bloc and the uncertainty of whether their country will ever emerge
 from the Soviet shadow, the Finns feel that their chances of surviving
 as an independent nation are good.  They base their conclusions on
 the fact that the USSR obtains more economic benefits, especially
 in terms of greater productivity, from a "free" Finland than it
 would from a captive country.  Geographically, Finland would be
 difficult to control as a satellite because of the long western
 sea frontier and extensive forests that facilitate guerrilla
 activities.  Strong measures against the Finns would harm the
 Communist cause on the world propaganda front, since it suits
 Moscow's policy to have Finland exist as a showpiece to prove that
 a small capitalist nation with an essentially western outlook can
 live in peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union.  Finally, the
 absorption of Finland by the USSR would jeopardize Swedish neutrality
 and, in all probability, force Sweden to join NATO and the rest of
 Western Europe in creating a stronger defense union.  Soviet treatment
 of Finland, therefore, should be closely watched since changes in the
 Kremlin line toward Finland could foreshadow major changes in Soviet
 policy.  (SECRET)
