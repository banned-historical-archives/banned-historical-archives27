 SCOPE NOTE
 For almost two years the USSR and China have been actively
 probing the possibilities of improving their relations with one another-
 at the very time that the Soviets have continued to develop and
 modernize their already formidable strategic and conventional military
 forces adjacent to China. These negotiating probes are not wholly new;
 they have occurred before. But this time there has been some forward
 movement, at least on secondary issues and political atmospherics. This
 raises several questions for us:
 - In what manner is the relationship between these two powers in
 process of change?
 - How do Soviet consultations with China fit into the USSR's
 broad strategic-military objectives in East Asia?
 - How far are present Sino-Soviet consultations going to carry
 Moscow and Beijing?
 - In addition to probable trends, what alternative outcomes are
 possible and what would be their likelihood?
 - And what will be the significance of the Sino-Soviet future for
 US interests?
 This Estimate addresses these questions, examining both the con-
 straints on and incentives for improvement in the Sino-Soviet relation-
 ship. The Estimate also explores the possible effect of certain variables,
 and proposes indicators by which to measure changes in the relation-
 ship. Except where otherwise indicated, the period of the Estimate is
 the next two to three years.
 Because of the complexity of issues discussed in this Estimate, it is
 being published in two versions: for broad readership, the complete text;
 for senior readers, the Key Judgments.

 KEY JUDGMENTS
 The present consultations between the USSR and China are
 unlikely to produce major concessions on the part of either, and the
 many issues that divide them will largely continue. A change in their re-
 lationship is nonetheless taking place. We believe this process will
 continue during the period-the next two to three years-covered by
 this Estimate.
 As a result largely of Soviet initiative and of an increased Chinese
 responsiveness, Moscow and Beijing have reached numerous agreements
 over the past year or so on relatively minor economic and cultural
 questions. But the change taking place in their relationship does not so
 much involve their basic positions or any "moving closer" to one
 another, as it does a moderating of the intensity of conflict. These two
 powers will almost certainly remain suspicious, wary antagonists,
 continuing to arm against each other and to criticize each other's aims
 and conduct-but within a less hostile climate.
 Many issues will continue to divide China and the USSR-and
 will continue to prevent either from making major concessions to the
 other. The principal such forces:
 - On both sides, historical enmity, suspicions, ideological preten-
 sions, and racist attitudes toward each other.
 - The sensitivity of the Sino-Soviet issue in the inner politics of
 both Beijing and Moscow-with the consequent need for their
 leaders not to become vulnerable to charges of betraying vital
 national interests to the other power.
 - Chinese concerns about Soviet power over the coming decades;
 Soviet concerns about potential Chinese power over the coming
 century.
 - On the part of China, Beijing's continuing belief that the USSR
 retains expansionist ambitions, and that Moscow's long-term
 desire to expand Soviet presence and influence around China's
 periphery is aimed directly at isolating China and diminishing
 its influence in Asia.
 - The desire of China that the USSR make concessions on three
 major issues: that is, that the USSR significantly reduce its

 military power (nuclear and nonnuclear) in the eastern USSR
 and Mongolia, cease its support for Vietnam's occupation of
 Kampuchea, and withdraw its combat troops from Afghanistan.
 - In the absence of any major Soviet concessions on these
 questions, Chinese reluctance to come to terms with Moscow on
 the Sino-Soviet border dispute.
 - Beijing's bitter experience with the high costs of close association
 with Moscow: remembrance of unacceptable past Soviet efforts
 to subvert the politics and armed forces of China and to
 subordinate China's national interests to those of the Soviet
 Union.
 - The fact that China's boss, Deng Xiaoping, was himself one of
 the foremost anti-Soviet officials indentified with the split of
 these two Communist powers, a generation ago, into rival Third
 Romes.
 - On the part of the USSR, a bedrock, absolute refusal on the
 part of Soviet leaders to halt Moscow's continuing buildup of
 military power adjacent to China, or to give up or markedly
 lessen the great military superiority the USSR enjoys over
 China.
 - Moscow's reluctance to yield the geopolitical advantages it
 currently derives from its ties with Vietnam, especially the
 forward deployment of ships and aircraft, and the barrier these
 developments constitute to Chinese influence in Southeast Asia.
 - The fact that the buildup of Soviet military power in Asia serves
 many strategic and political purposes beyond those relating
 directly to China, and is but a portion of the Soviet global
 strategic buildup.
 - Soviet unwillingness to make the major concessions demanded
 by Beijing unless China significantly reduces its relationships
 with the United States or moves to settle the border dispute.
 At the same time, certain other forces will tend to support a
 reduction of the intensity of Sino-Soviet hostility. The principal such
 forces:
 - Overall, the numerous changes in time, situation, and personal-
 ity that have occurred since the Sino-Soviet split of a generation
 ago-which render extreme hostility between Moscow and
 Beijing somewhat of an outmoded phenomenon, the product of
 certain circumstances of the time that now have less relevance.

 - The mere fact of reaching agreement on at least some (second-
 ary) issues in itself creates an environment for momentum and
 the possibility of further agreements.
 - On the Soviet side, as Moscow's leaders perceive increasing
 strategic challenge from more forceful US policies and future
 US weapon systems and deployments, a strong wish on their
 part to lessen the possibility that Sino-Soviet hostilities might
 greatly complicate the USSR's basic security interests or its
 overall strategic objectives.
 - A basic desire to reduce the danger of a two-front war.
 - A strong desire to prevent close cooperation between China and
 the United States (and Japan), and to that end to take advantage
 of known dissatisfactions on the part of Beijing with its Ameri-
 can connection.
 - A desire to enhance the security of the USSR's eastern borders
 by means additional to military power.
 - Concern about what the long-term political implications would
 be for China's economic modernization programs if outside
 assistance to those programs were to come only from the United
 States and the West.
 - A sense in Moscow that the danger of Chinese adventurist
 actions against the Soviet Union-one of the original reasons for
 the beginnings of the Soviet military buildup, years ago, on the
 Sino-Soviet border-has greatly diminished.
 - The opportunity to take advantage of the more businesslike
 attitudes and procedures that have come to mark Chinese
 politics and society since the death of Mao Zedong, in the
 process lessening some of the emotional content that Mao and
 Nikita Khrushchev personally contributed to Sino-Soviet
 estrangement.
 - On the Chinese side, Deng Xiaoping and his associates have
 determined that (a) China's greatest problems are those it faces
 as a vast, poor LDC; (b) the process of national development in
 China will be so difficult that it will need a prolonged period of
 respite from outside pressures; (c) to these ends a reordering of
 China's foreign policies is needed, one that reduces the level of
 tension with the USSR; and (d) such a reordering would not
 seriously risk jeopardizing the continuance either of strong US-
 led opposition to Soviet expansion in the world, or of US and
 Western willingness to continue cooperating economically with
 China.

 - Associated with those decisions, almost certainly low expecta-
 tions on the part of Beijing's leaders that the United States
 would come to Beijing's aid in the event of a Soviet attack on
 China.
 - China's discovery during its invasion of Vietnam in 1979 that it
 faced a formidable military antagonist on its southern border,
 and Beijing's consequent desire to reduce the pressures on China
 resulting from its two-front confrontation with the USSR and
 Vietnam.
 - Views on the part of China's leaders that a modest improvement
 of relations with the USSR serves to increase Beijing's leverage
 on Washington.
 - A desire to diversify further the foreign sources of input into
 China's modernization, and to take advantage of certain bene-
 fits that would derive from expanded economic and technologi-
 cal ties with the USSR.
 - A view on the part of Deng and his fellow pragmatists that less
 hostile relationships with the USSR will also signal that, in
 accepting some US economic and military assistance, Beijing
 does not intend to embrace the United States too closely or
 completely refuse all assistance from the USSR.
 It should be stressed that present Sino-Soviet talks are taking
 place against the background of a continuing substantial augmenta-
 tion of Soviet military strength adjacent to China-which has contin-
 ued during the Sino-Soviet consultations of the past two years. Roughly
 one-fourth of all Soviet ground force personnel are now stationed
 opposite China, together with more than 2,000 Soviet aircraft, over
 100,000 air personnel, greatly enhanced naval strength, a rapidly
 expanding SS-20 force, and considerable additional nuclear weapons
 carriers in the form of Backfire and Badger bombers, SLBMs, and
 ICBMs. The great majority of the USSR's nuclear weapons targeted
 against East Asia will continue to be devoted to Chinese targets. And, a
 principal net result of the buildup will be certain continuing marked
 asymmetries in Soviet and Chinese military forces: the Chinese seriously
 lagging, qualitatively, in modern arms; Soviet ground and air forces
 generally positioned fairly close to China's borders, Chinese forces
 deployed deeply behind those borders.
 Moscow's leaders see their military augmentation as insurance
 against Chinese military provocations along the border, and against the
 prospect of a significantly enhanced Chinese nuclear threat to the USSR
 6

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/03/16: CIA-RDP87TOO126R000800980001-4
 over the long term. They almost certainly also consider that their forces
 will continue to serve meanwhile as a deterrent to China from invading
 Vietnam once again, or from otherwise effectively challenging Soviet
 interests in Indochina. And, these forces will strengthen Moscow's
 negotiating hand vis-a-vis the Chinese.
 This ongoing Soviet augmentation will at the same time continue
 to stem from many causes beyond those directly relating to China and
 will continue to serve many broader Soviet interests. That is, the
 augmentation of forces in the East also reflects the USSR's plans to
 upgrade all of its forces, everywhere; its desire to strengthen its
 capability to fight a two-front war, in Europe and Asia; the felt need to
 compensate for dependence on a very long, vulnerable railroad to
 reinforce and resupply the isolated Soviet Far East; the traditional
 Soviet practice of overinsuring, of massing more military strength than
 outside observers might think necessary; the Soviet effort to use the
 military buildup as an instrument for political intimidation and further
 expansion of influence in East Asia; and a desire to reinforce Soviet se-
 curity against the perspective of much-enhanced Western military
 capabilities in the Pacific.
 It should also be stressed that the Sino-Soviet future is not just a
 bilateral matter, but will develop within the dynamic of triangular
 relationships with the United States. This dynamic will be a crucially
 important factor affecting the behavior of Moscow and Beijing toward
 the other. Each leadership will remain highly sensitive to its perceptions
 of the US relationship with the rival Communist power, and especially
 to any development that either power might consider to represent a
 major discontinuity in US orientation or strategic priorities.
 What developments appear most likely in the Sino-Soviet rela-
 tionship over the next two years or so?
 - Chances favor continuance of the process of markedly increas-
 ing trade relations and reaching agreements on other secondary
 issues of economic and technological ties, cultural interchanges,
 and the like, amidst continuing reflections of a more business-
 like, less intensely hostile overall atmosphere. This may proceed
 to the point of including agreement on certain confidence-
 building measures (CBMs) such as mutual notification of troop
 exercises.
 The two sides will upgrade the level of negotiating representa-
 tion. The Soviets will continue to press for broader ties with
 Beijing, in the belief that agreement on enough small steps will
 lay a path for progress on major issues. The Soviets will also seek

 to institutionalize the negotiating process. The Chinese will
 probably continue to draw the line well short of the most far-
 reaching Soviet proposals in the absence of major Soviet military
 concessions.
 - While continuing to emphasize its maximum demands for large-
 scale Soviet force reductions in the Soviet Far East, Beijing
 would welcome even small concessions from the Soviets in their
 force deployments against China. The Chinese would particu-
 larly welcome Soviet troop withdrawals from Mongolia.
 - For their part, the Soviets will continue their force improve-
 ments in the East. And, the Soviets will probably not make more
 than token gestures to China over the next two to three years.
 - Moscow will almost certainly continue to withhold major
 concessions regarding its forces along China's border and in
 Mongolia until Beijing has made more fundamental concessions
 than it has yet been willing to consider. There is nonetheless a
 modest chance that the Soviets will make a token pullback of
 perhaps a division or so from Mongolia during the next two to
 three years. This would not constitute a material change of
 much consequence, but could represent a symbolic concession
 of some magnitude that might induce the Chinese to reciprocate
 in some way-and thus perhaps encourage Moscow to make
 further concessions.
 - Even if there were a token Soviet military pullback from
 Mongolia, however, we doubt that the Chinese would make
 major concessions on the issues of greatest concern to Moscow-
 particularly the border dispute-until Soviet force withdrawals
 had gone well beyond the token stage.
 - Nor is the USSR likely to give up its control over the regime in
 Afghanistan, to abandon support for Vietnam's war effort in
 Kampuchea, or to surrender its military privileges at Cam Ranh
 Bay in Vietnam-where since late 1983 the Soviets have
 deployed Badger bombers.
 Contingent developments that could upset the above-estimated
 course of Sino-Soviet relations:
 - Major escalation of Vietnamese war efforts in Kampuchea or
 along Thailand's borders.
 - North Korean reversion to incendiary policies.
 - Major Soviet efforts to destabilize Pakistan.

 - Vietnamese clashes with China, either along the border or in the
 South China Sea.
 - The adoption of major new policies on the part of post-Deng or
 post-Chernenko leaderships.
 - A Japanese move toward major rearmament.
 Possible alternative outcomes:
 - There is an off chance that during the period of this Estimate
 the Sino-Soviet relationship could take on a much more hostile
 character than the Estimate holds probable:
 - This could occur because so many variables are present, many
 of them not fully within the control of the present leaderships
 in either Moscow or Beijing: the advent of new policies on the
 part of post-Deng or post-Chernenko leadership, initiatives
 taken by other governments (in Korea or Vietnam, for exam-
 ple), and so on.
 - It does not follow that US interests would necessarily benefit
 from the coming of a much more frigid Sino-Soviet relation-
 ship. The effect on US interests would depend on the nature
 and intensity of the estrangement between Moscow and
 Beijing: up to a point, US interests would clearly benefit from
 probable increases in Chinese cooperation against Soviet poli-
 cies in the world, in Chinese receptiveness to US advice and
 counsel, and-possibly-in willingness to permit expanded
 levels of Western economic and technological presence within
 China. But, if Sino-Soviet relations deteriorated to the point of
 actual or threatened large-scale hostilities, US diplomatic and
 security policymaking could be greatly complicated.
 - Conversely, there is also an outside chance-though less likely
 than the above-that the Sino-Soviet relationship could become
 a much closer one during the period of this Estimate than we
 now judge likely:
 - This might come to pass if no great disruptive contingencies
 should occur; if the Chinese should back away in practice-
 though not in principle-from certain of their key "de-
 mands"; if agreements reached on a number of secondary
 issues should begin to create a somewhat greater momentum
 toward Sino-Soviet rapprochement; or if for some reason
 Beijing's leaders should come to depreciate the value of
 China's relationships with the United States.

 - The coming of significantly closer relations between the USSR
 and China could seriously harm US interests; the warmer the
 Sino-Soviet relationship, the more damaging to US geopolitical
 concerns, defense policies, targeting, and alliance systems, to
 the role of Japan, and to numerous other key US interests.
 - Although the possibility cannot be excluded that alternative
 outcomes such as the above could occur in the Sino-Soviet
 relationship, we stress that the most likely outcome, by far, is
 that which this NIE has postulated: namely, that the level of
 hostility between Moscow and Beijing will decrease, that some
 additional agreements on secondary matters or possibly CBMs
 will be reached, that at most the USSR may make a token
 withdrawal of perhaps a division or so from Mongolia, and that
 continuing basic differences between Moscow and Beijing will
 not permit any significantly greater degree of rapprochement
 between them to develop over the next two to three years.
