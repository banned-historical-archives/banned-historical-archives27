 Soviet Commercial Visitors for 1976--an Overview
 Soviet commercial contacts in the US in 1976 held
 steady at about the 1975 level.   The number of VIP
 business visitors  (deputy minister level or higher),
 however,  rose from 14 in 1975 to 24 in 1976.   Approxi-
 mately 1,150 bureaucrats,  scientists,  technicians,                             and
 skilled workers visited US companies and institutions
 for commercial purposes during the year.   Representatives
 of the Soviet automotive industry were again the most
 numerous with the petroleum and petrochemical industries
 moving up to second place.   Two important facilities still
 under construction in the Soviet Union--the Kama Motor
 Vehicle Plant and the International Trade Center spon-
 sored by the Occidental Petroleum Corporation--accounted
 for many of the visits in these categories.
 An analysis of bilateral commercial contacts during
 the last three years suggests that there is a pattern
 to them.   Once a problem has been identified by Soviet
 bureaucrats  (e.g., an area where technology or equipment
 is substandard),  high level officials in the appropriate
 industry  (deputy ministers, plant directors,  institute
 heads)  come to the US to see what solution their American
 counterparts have found for it.   If a recommendation is
 made that funds be committed to a particular purchase,
 the number of such visitors decreases,  and an upswing
 in American visits to the USSR ensues to complete the
 negotiations.   When agreement is reached,  the third
 phase begins--the dispatch to the US of lower ranking
 personnel to obtain equipment and training on how to
 use it.
 The establishment in the US of Soviet economic
 agencies,  such as Morflot and the Kama Purchasing Com-
 mission, might have been expected to reduce the number
 of business visitors on the theory that negotiations
 would increasingly be carried out by these organizations.
 But their existence does not seem to have lessened the
 need for American businessmen to meet with the end-users

 of the technology or equipment in question or for the
 end-users actually to see the product before a purchase
 is agreed upon.
 Some Trends
 The figures presented in the table below together
 with other information suggest a number of trends:
 --Direct Soviet attempts to acquire sensitive
 US technology seemed less persistent in 1976
 than in the preceding year.   Licensing arrange-
 ments involving third countries as well as
 the Soviet and US participants, however,
 became increasingly common.
 --i'iost 1976 Soviet business visits were made
 in connection with relatively routine Soviet
 projects,  suggesting that financing is not
 available to undertake more sophisticated
 ones.   This assumption is supported by the
 arrival last year of several Soviet bankers
 seeking credit.
 --Many commercial delegations were again ac-
 companied by representatives of the party
 apparatus who identified themselves as "em-
 ployees," "senior experts," or "consultants"
 of various ministries.   In some cases these
 party "apparatchiks" outranked the nominal
 head of the delegations they came with.
 --The upswing in delegations concerned with
 mining and construction under extreme
 climatic conditions suggests a renewed
 Soviet interest in involving the US in
 developing resources in Siberia and the
 Far East.
 --The continuing decrease in visits con-
 cerned with aviation reflected the uncertain
 state of US-Soviet relations in the field.
 Some negotiations have bogged down due to
 questions of Soviet intent and unwilling-
 ness to grant US industry access to plants
 to observe quality control procedures.

 --Continuing problems with Soviet pipelines
 and other petroleum-related equipment
 appeared to contribute to the consistently
 high number of petroleum industry visitors
 to this country.
 --Expansion of Soviet shipping activities
 in North America continued into 1976 with
 the establishment in New Jersey of Morflot
 America,  Inc.   Because the Soviets are
 under constraints by the US to reduce
 their official presence in the US, Morflot
 may represent a way of avoiding direct US
 control over Soviet personnel.
 --Preparations for the 1980 Olympics in
 Moscow may have generated the interest
 in selected consumer goods areas  (fast
 food equipment, prefabricated housing,
 etc.)
 --The Kama Purchasing Commission, which
 was established in 1972 to purchase equip-
 ment for the Kama Motor Vehicle Plant,
 continued to expand beyond its original
 charter by negotiating in areas unrelated
 to the automotive industry.   For example,
 the Kama Purchasing Commission has been
 given permission to purchase for the
 Irkutsk natural gas project.
 The chart shows a tally of commercial visitors in
 selected categories over the past three years,  along
 with the ranking of each category from year to year.
 We recognize that numbers of visitors alone cannot
 accurately reflect Soviet priorities in the acquisition
 of technology and equipment.   Often they reflect the
 status of a particular undertaking or identify topics
 of interest during various negotiating stages.

 Moscow,  Berlin,  and East-West Detente

 East German actions in Berlin since the turn of the
 year have given rise to a wave of rumors and speculation
 and have raised the specter of another East-West con-
 frontation over the divided city.   The two key questions
 are why the Soviet Union, which retains veto power over
 GDR actions, has chosen to permit the East Germans to
 act at this time,  and whether the Soviets will permit
 further steps of a kind that could precipitate an East-
 West c.,llision.
 Background:   The East German Actions
 Over the course of the last two months, the Soviets
 have permitted the East Germans to accelerate their
 long-standing effort to assert their sovereignty over
 the eastern sector of the divided city.   The East Germans
 removed border control points between East Berlin and
 East Germany on the weekend of January 1-2, and, as
 finally confirmed by party boss Honecker on February 17,
 gave notice of the discontinuation of a legal gazette,
 the Verordnungsblatt, which had served as a vehicle for
 applying East German legislation to East Berlin.   (The
 publication actually appears to have been discontinued
 in September,  some three months after steps had been
 taken to erase some of the remaining distinctions be-
 tween East Berlin and East German delegates in the East
 German legislature.)   The purpose of these changes was
 to eliminate some of the last visible reminders of East
 Berlin's status as an area formally under Four-Power
 occupation.
 In addition, there are now reports that the East
 Germans intend to create a new district in East Berlin,
 and that, rumors say, it will include some territory
 from the neighboring Frankfurt District.   This boundary
 alteration would reinforce East Germany's claim to
 sovereignty over East Berlin, but it would be a direct
 violation of the original Four Power occupation agree-
 ment of 1944, which barred any changes in the borders
 of Greater Berlin.

 All these actions gain in significance because they
 coincide with efforts to restrict foreign and West German
 travel into East Berlin.   In a move apparently intended
 to choke off the heavy flow of pleasure- and bargain-
 seeking foreign laborers going from West Berlin into
 East Berlin, the GDR in January imposed visa requireme;-,ts
 on foreign (non-German and non-Allied) visitors to East
 Berlin.   At the same time, the East Germans have begun
 quietly to deny entry to selected West Berlin visitors,
 apparently focusing on former East Germans whose per-
 sonal examples might inspire imitators.
 Most importantly, in December and January, the East
 Germans attempted to go beyond symbolic actions to deal
 directly with their most pressing problem, the mounting
 wave of interest in legal emigration.   First they moni-
 tored and harassed East German visitors to the West
 German mission in East Berlin (beginning in December),
 then they barred entry to the mission  (on January 11),
 and then, abandoning this tactic, assigned plainclothes-
 men to patrol the area and make spot-checks of visitors
 leaving the mission.   These steps were more directly rel-
 evant than anything else the GDR has done to the central
 East German problem of controlling their restive popula-
 tion.   They were in direct violation, however, of inner-
 German agreements linked to the Quadripartite Agreement
 of 1971, as well as the Helsinki accord.
 The East Germans have long wished to take some of
 these actions, but evidently acted only after they had
 obtained the support and approval of the Soviets.
 The East German motives in promoting such actions
 are easy to assess.   The GDR remains in many ways an
 artificial creation.   The loyalties of many of its cit-
 izens are questionable, and the recent wave of emigra-
 tion has evidently alarmed the regime.   Any actions that

 might widen the gulf between East Germany and West Ger-
 many, bolster GDR claims to legitimacy, and slow down
 East German emigration, are obviously to the GDR's ad-
 vantage.
 Moscow's motives are more complex.   On the one hand,
 the Soviets not only share the GDR's nervousness over
 its vulnerability to ideological "subversion" from the
 West, but also see the rise of intellectual dissidence
 and popular unrest in East Germany as part of a general
 phenomenon that threatens to weaken their position
 throughout Eastern Europe.   Moreover, Moscow is con-
 cerned about the latent appeal of German nationalism in
 the GDR.   These multiple concerns were undoubtedly
 behind the Soviet decision to support the East Germans
 in their most recent efforts to buttress their position
 in Berlin and to restrict the flow of travel across their
 borders.
 On the other hand, the Soviets also have a political
 and economic stake in the preservation of good relations
 with the West.   It is not likely that the Soviet leaders
 have forgotten how central the Berlin agreement was to
 the other achievements of Moscow's detente diplomacy.
 Moscow's interest in supporting the East Germans in their
 current efforts is therefore likely to be balanced by
 a comparable interest in avoiding any direct confronta-
 tion with the West over Berlin.
 In fact, the latest East German initiatives appear
 to have been launched with an eye to avoiding a direct
 conflict with the Western Allies.   In contrast to past
 flare-ups over Berlin, this time there has been no ef-
 fort to interfere with land or air access to the city,
 or with Allied  (as distinct from West German)  rights
 there.   The actions initiated by the East German regime,
 presumably under Soviet guidance, have instead probed
 at the gray areas of the existing agreements and made
 only changes that do not directly involve the Western
 Allies.   The Soviets themselves have done their best to
 play down the significance of the East German moves,
 treating them and Allied protests of them as "technical"
 questions, and passing assurances that they have no in-
 terest in a dispute over Berlin.

 There are other signs of caution in the East German
 approach, which again presumably reflect the guiding hand
 of the Soviets.   The East Germans in some cases like the
 Verordnungsblatt carefully left themselves a line of re-
 treat.                     In other instances they have not followed up on
 provocative actions, notably the blockade of the West
 German mission.   It would appear that this move in
 particular provoked second thoughts in East Berlin or--
 more likely--Moscow, because of the attention it drew
 in the West.   Indeed, one Soviet diplomat in East Berlin
 claimed tnaL the Soviets had been "surprised" by the
 blockade of the mission.
 The Soviets, meanwhile, have stayed discreetly in
 the background, although they have staunchly defended
 East Germany's claims to sovereignty over East Berlin.
 Their most authoritative public pronouncement appeared
 in a lei article in Pravda on February 12, in which
 they backed East German steps to defend their "legiti-
 mate" rights.   This, of course,  is a position of long
 standing--one the Soviets maintained throughout the nego-
 tiations on the Quadripartite Agreement--and it would be
 surprising indeed if they were to give it up now.
 Insofar as the Soviets themselves have played an
 active role in Berlin,  it has been to oppose West
 German efforts to strengthen their ties with West Ber-
 lin.   Thus, the Soviets have protested virtually all
 visible West German activities in the city, including
 Bundestag committee meetings, the establishment of
 Federal German offices, and visits by West German govern-
 ment officials.   In November, they also protested plans
 to permit West Berlin to participate in elections to
 the European Parliament on the grounds that this would
 be a violation of Berlin's special Four-Power status.
 These protests have been coupled with a persistent ef-
 fort to assert a larger role for themselves in West Ber-
 lin, both through legalistic arguments and through quiet
 efforts to expand the overall level of Soviet activity
 in West Berlin.
 Prospects
 The apparent care the Soviets have taken to control
 the East Germans and to bar dramatic or unduly provoca-
 tive actions suggests that it is unlikely that there will

 be any sharp escalation of East German actions in and
 around Berlin.   Certainly the prospect of military ac-
 tion directed against West Berlin or the access routes
 to it is remote under the present circumstances.   The
 Soviets today want to achieve a new SALT agreement with
 the US,  and to maintain and expand Soviet access to the
 technology and goods of the West.   A major crisis over
 Berlin would threaten both objectives, and could bring
 about other untoward results, such as the strengthening
 of West European interest in the NATO alliance.
 For the same reasons, we are not likely to see any
 open challenge soon to Allied prerogatives in Berlin,
 despite suggestions made by Soviet Ambassador Abrasimov
 in East Berlin on January 19 that Allied military patrols
 in East Berlin were provocative and should be scaled
 25X1           down.   The relatively tough tone taken b
 Abrasimov
 may reflec
 apparatchik with a well-deserved reputation as a hard
 liner--and. a desire to probe for differences in the re-
 solve of the Western Allies.   In responding to Allied
 protests against East German actions on January 11,
 Soviet officials in Moscow took a notably tougher line
 with the British and French than they did with the
 Americans.   To the former they asserted that Greater
 Berlin was no longer in existence, a claim they did
 not advance to US diplomats.   But while there is no
 reason to doubt that the Soviets would be delighted
 if they could bluff the Allies, or some of them, into
 scaling down their activity in East Berlin, this is
 very different from an attempt to bar entry to military
 patrols.

 Another reason to doubt that the Soviets would
 deliberately choose to precipitate a major crisis over
 Berlin is at least modest success of the "nibbling"
 tactics they have permitted the East Germans to under-
 take.                      In the absence of an Allied decision to make
 a major issue out of the East German moves, we are
 likely to see further such nibbling.   A likely move in
 the near future would be a unilateral revision of the
 borders of East Berlin.   Like the other small steps so
 far taken, this would not directly impinge on Allied
 rights and the Soviets might see it as an acceptably
 low-risk gamble.   This year the Soviets have made no

 effort to deny that such a move is in the offing, in
 contrast to their posture two years ago when rumors of
 similar possible action first surfaced.
 The Continuing Problem
 Despite Moscow's caution and evident unwillingness
 to risk a major crisis, the Berlin situation is still
 potentially explosive.   This is because the relatively
 low-risk actions Moscow has been willing to approve of
 do little to solve the real problem in East Germany--
 the lack of legitimacy of the East German state and the
 failure of the regime to make its citizens more Communist
 than German.   If the present discontent in East Germany
 should continue to grow--and with it the pressure for
 East German emigration--the possibility cannot be ex-
 cluded that the Soviets would eventually support an
 East German move drastically to reduce contact with the
 West, despite the fact that such actions would violate
 existing agreements.   They might, for example, reimpose
 their blockade of the West German missions.   In an ex-
 tremity, they might even seal off the border to all East-
 West travel.   If the East German regime were to appear
 seriously threatened,  it is almost certain that the
 Soviets would support such action, as they did in 1961,
 when they endorsed the building of the Berlin Wall.
 Similarly, if serious disturbances should erupt else-
 where in Eastern Europe, the Soviets might conclude that
 they had no alternative but to take preventive actions
 in East Germany.

 Moscow's Initial Probe for Changes in Post-Mao Attitudes
 Is Foundering
 The first major Soviet probe for any change in Pe-
 king's attitude toward the USSR since Mao's death appears
 to be drawing to a close with very little to show for the
 effort.   Cracks are beginning to appear in the propaganda
 standdown Moscow has maintained since Mao's death over
 five months ago, Soviet diplomats are beginning to leak
 word to their associates of the "reasonable" proposals
 spurned by the Chinese at the current round of border
 talks in Peking, and Soviet media are again citing earlier
 Soviet proposals on non-use of force and nonaggression
 that Peking turned down in the past.   The Soviets, in
 short, seem to be preparing for the cessation of this
 round of border talks.
 It is unlikely that Moscow expected any quick change
 in Chinese attitudes after Mao and, indeed, most Soviet
 officials indicated just that.   Nevertheless, the Soviets
 were clearly ped to take some new initiatives after
 Mao departed . rear
 The quick action o
 the new    inese   ea ers ip again    the "gang of four,"
 whom the Soviets clearly believed to be Mao's spiritual
 heirs, apparently encouraged the Soviets to begin to
 probe for changes.   Their initiative to start the new
 round of border talks probably should be seen in this
 light.   With no Chinese ambassador in Moscow  (since
 March 1976)  and with the Soviet embassy in Peking en-
 joying little access to Chinese officials, the border
 talks conducted at the deputy foreign minister level pro-
 vided the highest possible direct level of contact.   After
 Deputy Foreign Minister Ilichev arrived in Peking on
 November 30 to reconvene the talks, various Soviet of-
 ficials expressed optimism, claiming that the Chinese
 did not seem as intransigent as before.   The Chinese
 for their part have sought to discredit this line, viewing
 it as a Soviet effort to worry the US.   They apparently
 have not yielded an inch in their basic positions.

 The first break in the Soviet propaganda standdown
 came about two weeks after Ilichev was received by For-
 eign Minister Huang Hua on January 22,  indicating that
 the meeting only confirmed China's unwillingness to move
 ahead.   In a domestic broadcast on February 4, Izvestia
 commentator Bovin, who is known to have ties with General
 Secretary Brezhnev, accused the new Chinese leadership of
 carrying on "the old anti-Soviet line," even though he
 commended it for changing Mao's domestic policies.
 The Ilichev - Huang Hua meeting took place without
 publicity or official announcements, apparently at Chi-
 nese insistence because of concern over the propaganda
 use Moscow would make of it.   By February 7, however,
 the Soviets began leaking the word in Peking that the
 meeting had taken place,
 The highest level Soviet polemical statement to
 date was a Pravda "Observer" article on February 10.
 In addition to criticizing "anti-Soviet attacks" on China,
 it recounted Soviet non-use-of-force and non-agression
 proposals of 1971 and 1973, and Soviet proposals for
 high-level or summit meetings made in 1969,  1970, and
 1973.   It also cited an unspecified "initiative to im-
 prove relations" advanced in recent months.                          This "ini-
 tiative" has also been mentioned in subsequent Soviet
 propaganda,
 ternative y,  the Soviets may
 simply be re erring to t eir initiative to reconvene the
 border talks, or to the gestures they have made since Mao's
 death,  including the propaganda standdown.
 The timing of the "Observer" article could have
 been determined by an interview which Ilichev's counter-
 part, Vice Foreign Minister Yu Chan, gave to the manag-
 ing editor of the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun on February
 5.   Among other things, Yu Chan termed the recent Soviet
 approach to China a fraud intended to deceive interna-
 tional opinion.   Concerning the situation at the border
 talks, he accused Moscow of continuing to talk "nonsense"
 while taking "practically no measures whatsoever."   It
 is likely that Moscow, which has had to endure a stream

 of Chinese polemics during the standdown,  felt that this
 sort of public attack by the chief Chinese negotiator
 merited a riposte, and that there was little risk in
 giving it.   However,  these scattered Soviet criticisms
 of China still fall far short of a full-scale resumption
 of Soviet polemics, and serve primarily as indicators
 that Moscow has not been satisfied with the results of
 its gestures to Peking.

 Chinese Refuse To Back Off  "Unjust Treaties"  Issue
 At the same time, the Soviets have claimed that the
 Chinese continue to insist that Moscow admit the "injus-
 tice" of the early treaties on which the Sino-Soviet
 border is based before formal negotiations can begin.

 The Soviets claim that the negotiations stalled on this
 point before they ever got started.   An article in the
 PRC-controlled Hong Kong press rebutting the Pravda
 "Observer" article has also indicated that the Chinese
 continue to demand this admission.  This demand was one
 of the difficulties on which the abortive border discus-
 sions of 1964 foundered.  Although the Chinese had never
 explicitly renounced it., they apparently had placed much
 less stress on it in recent years.  If they are indeed
 holding firm, it would seem that Soviet pessimism is
 well-founded, particularly in light of the two other
 tough Chinese proposals which have been raised at this
 round--calling for Soviet withdrawal from Mon olia and
 reduction of border forces to the 1964 level
 If peking saw it in its interest to keep the talks
 alive, it could presumably do so with very little effort.
 Moscow is not anxious to concede to the world that re-
 lations are at the same old impasse, and some modest
 gesture by Peking would probably keep Ilichev there.
 At the moment, however,  the main impression is that of
 two sides preparing their positions publicly and pri-
 vately for Ilichev's return.

 The Ustinov-Ryabov Conundrum
 The responsibilities as party secretary of the CPSU
 Central Committee assumed by Yakov Ryabov last October
 are still not clearly discernible, despite several in-
 triguing official appearances on his part.   The ambig-
 uities surrounding his role and that of Minister of
 Defense Ustinov raise questions for which we have no
 good answers.
 At their center is the unknown of Kirilenko's cur-
 rent stance in the leadership--loyal deputy to Brezhnev
 or increasingly impatient "heir."   Brezhnev and Kirilenko
 have different personal styles and,  to the extent that
 these styles are reflected in policy areas, their rela-
 tive political strengths are and will continue to be
 significant.   At the Central Committee plenum last
 October,  the fortunes of their respective clients pre-
 sented a striking contrast.                                   Kirilenko succeeded in
 getting his protege, Ryabov,         seated on the Secretariat.
 Brezhnev failed to get his client--First Deputy Premier
 Tikhonov--seated on the Politburo.   Since then, however,
 Ryabov's responsibilities as secretary and Kirilenko's
 access through him to additional sectors of party work
 have remained murky.
 A "vacancy" on the Secretariat was created last
 April when then party secretary Ustinov became minister
 of defense.   Ustinov has not been referred to in the
 Soviet media as party secretary since that time.   The
 job is as demanding and time-consuming as that of minister
 of defense, and few Western observers believe that he can
 handle both positions indefinitely.   Thus, it was widely
 expected that Ustinov would be formally released from his
 Secretariat duties at the Central Committee plenum in
 October.   The promotion of Ryabov to the Secretariat at
 that time suggested that he might be slated as Ustinov's
 replacement.   In the event, however, the plenum failed
 to announce Ustinov's release from the Secretariat.

 Defense Industry in the Secretariat
 As party secretary, Ustinov's major responsibility
 was the coordination of defense industry, a package that
 seems to have been designed to match his special expertise.
 There is no overriding precedent for a separate portfolio
 in the Secretariat, and defense industries in the past
 have been handled by the secretary for industry--one of
 Kirilenko's current responsibilities.   Since Ustinov's
 appointment as minister of defense there have been only
 infrequent reports of contacts between him and defense
 industry principals, and we lack sufficient details con-
 cerning these contacts to discern whether they were of
 the type to be expected between defense industries and
 their primary customer--the minister of defense--or
 whether Ustinov has tailored his new job to fit his own
 particular strengths and has taken coordination of de-
 fense industry with him to his new assignment.

 Obituary signatures, sometimes useful in defining
 responsibilities within the Secretariat, have also been
 inconclusive.   Ustinov, but not Ryabov, signed the obit-
 uary in November of a retired defense industry official.
 Obituary signature protocol is based in part on actual
 official contacts, however, and since the deceased was
 retired, Ryabov may have been too newly installed to
 have had any contact with him.   Both Ustinov and Ryabov
 signed the obituary of a worker at the Baltic shipbuild-
 ing plant in Leningrad, but the other signatories were
 neither military nor defense industry,  leaving the rea-
 son for Ryabov's signature ambiguous.                         He attended the
 funeral of an aircraft designer this month, but so did
 Moscow party boss Grishin and Kirilenko, as well as
 Ustinov and L. V. Smirnov,  chairman of the Military-
 Industrial Commission.
 The Administrative Organs Function
 If access through his protege to defense industry
 decisions is important to Kirilenko, so is access to
 another,  less clearly defined responsibility of Ustinov's.
 There is fragmentary evidence that as party secretary,
 he had achieved some supervisory responsibility for the
 Central Committee's Administrative Organs Department
 which checks on the armed forces,  the KGB, and the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs  (the uniformed police).
 In 1972, he addressed a seminar o
 regiona  Administrative Organs officials convened to
 discuss strengthening socialist legality,  law and order,
 and mass defense work.   In 1974,          accompanied by the head
 of the Administrative Organs Department, who was making
 a rare public appearance, he received the deputy chair-
 man of the Hungarian Council of Ministers responsible for
 the military and security police           (but not defense in-
 dustry).   This is not to suggest that he had replaced
 Brezhnev as  "most responsible" secretary in this field,
 or even that he had blocked the activities of other
 secretaries, but that he seemed to be playing an ex-
 panded role.

 Control of the Administrative Organs Department is
 an important political lever for a Soviet leader.   It is
 a measure of the sensitivity of this department that when
 its head--a Brezhnev client--was killed in a plane crash
 shortly after Khrushchev's ouster,  it took the leader-
 ship four years to agree on a replacement.   During this
 period Brezhnev moved quickly to retrieve his loss and
 by 1966 was exercising effective control over the head-
 less department.   In the end,  the leadership's solution
 was as nearly apolitical as it could manage; the first
 deputy head, a career apparatchik, was finally promoted
 to head.
 In his first solo public appearance following his
 promotion to the Secretariat, Ryabov was the ranking
 political figure to attend the Militia Day ceremonies
 in November.   Kapitonov alone in 1970 and with Polyansky
 in 1971, Kirilenko and Shelest in 1972, Mazurov in 1973,
 and Ustinov and Tikhonov in 1974 had successively repre-
 sented the leadership on this occasion.   In 1975, no
 major leaders were listed as attending. Ryabov's sudden
 emergence into the spotlight on Militia Day hinted at a
 possible link with the Administrative Organs Department.
 This hint was slightly strengthened in January when
 Ryabov represented the leadership at the All-Union DOSAAF
 Congress.   At the last congress in 1971, the head of the
 Administrative Organs Department had performed this
 function.
 Questions but No Answers
 We are left, then, with some troubling questions.
 Has Ustinov been left on the Secretariat at least in part
 to block Kirilenko from further successes and to maintain
 the balance among the seniors on the Secretariat?   Or is
 Ryabov simply too junior and too inexperienced at the
 national level to allow him to do more than understudy
 the overburdened Ustinov?   How real is Kirilenko's access
 through his protege to the sensitive areas of the defense
 industry and the Administrative Organs Department?
 Finally--to return to first causes--what sort of trade-
 off was involved in Ryabov's promotion in the first place?
