 THE SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE
 INTER-PARTY DEVELOPI?NTS AT AND AFTER THE
 RUMANIAN WORKERS PARTY CONGRESS--BUCHAREST, 20-25 JUNE 1960
 The background of thd*-dispute (1957-1960)
 1. The present dispute between the Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union (CPSU) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) has its origins in
 differences                            which date back at least three years,.r
 that is, to                     1957.  On the Chinese side, antecedent
 resentments may date as far back as the formative period of the CPC in
 the twenties, when Stalin' s,tialliance olic  with the Kuomintang drove the
 CPC to disaster, as well as to the war and early post-war period, when
 Soviet support for the Chinese Communist cause was minimal and did not
 inhibit the stripping of Manchuria.    If--          mingle cause for the
 current dispute
 -netowa.      Rather, it would appear, was an
 accumulation of Chinese policies and actions         increasingly displeased.
 and challenged Khrushchev and, presumably, a majority of the Soviet leadership.
 In the field of domestic policy, it is now known that Mao's "Let a hundred
 flowers bloom" program aroused Soviet doubts about its usefulness.  The
 program for the "great leap forward"hand the ccinmunesr adopted by the CPC
 4rert
 in May 1958,      readily recognizable as a considerable irritant in Sino-
 Soviet relations by the silent treatment which irCJreceived in the Soviet
 Union.
 2.  Disagreement over foreign policy manifested itself in August 1958
 when Khrushchev, after four days discussion with Mao Tse-tung, rejected,
 on 5 August, Western proposals for a summit meeting within the U. N. Security

 ' W
 Council on the crisis in the Middle East - proposals which he had accepted
 in July.  Nevertheless, on 23 August the Chinese began shelling of the
 off-shore islands.  On 23 May 19580 the Commander of the Chinese Air Force
 predicted that China would make atomic bombs "in the not too distant future"
 and the Chinese press ceased to refer to Khrushchev's earlier plan for an
 atom-free zone in Asia.  Khrushchev revived his concept of an atom-free
 zone for "the Far East and the entire Pacific Basin" at the 21st CPSU Congress
 in February 1959.  Chinese reactions were not enthusiastic, and, from April
 1959, on, references to the plan disappeared altogether.  In the light
 of these and other indications, it can be fairly assumed that Soviet
 unwillingness to deliver atomic weapons to Chinese contro]j had become a
 serious issue.  It is now known that the Soviets cited as the reason for
 their reluctance their apprehension over Chinese policiesgin the external
 field which were in conflict with Khrushchev's "peaceful coexistence"
 tactics, A affirmed that global or limited war need not be avoided and objected
 to Khrushchev's aid programs for "bourgeois" regimes in underdeveloped
 countries on the grounds that they would delay revolution.  Chinese objectlions
 to peaceful coexistence tactics manifested themselves  i-~rbt 1957 .w
 in the deliberations of the International Communist Front organizations,
 especially within the World Peace Council and the International Union of
 Students--two organizations which were most directly and intensely engaged
 in building their appeal on the unity campaign so typical of the peaceful
 coexistence periods  they desired to involve bourgeois and nationalist

 groups in mass action and therefore advocated informal conversations, -
 negotiations]                 ~iaw_    concessions to such groups.
 The Chinese refused to "sit around the table" with them except in formal
 meetings ubft designated representatives and  Q~4 uaftwd to broaden the scope of
 concessions on program and organization questions.  Chinese spposi4ian
 was particularly manifest after the Soviet decision of June 1959 concerning
 Khrushchev's visit to the United States.
 3. In August 1959, the Chinese overran the Indian border post at
 Longju and reopened the border dispute with India, after eight years of
 quiet.  The Soviet position on this dispute significantly failed to give
 full endorsement to the Chinese claims, although pseeg Chinese repressive
 actions in Tibet had been promptly supported as just and as an "internal
 affair."  Khrushchev, as was known later, did not interpret the reopening
 of the dispute as a mere attempt to register opposition to his trip to the
 c"United States, but as an un-Marxist blunder which needlessly undermined
 Indian neutralist attitudes and potential value in the peace and disarmament
 campaign and impaired the appeal of CP India.  When Khrushchev visited Peiping,
 after his trip to the United States, for the October anniversary celebrations
 in 1959, the Sino-Indian dispute was one topic of discussion and it is
 virtually certain that Khrushchev presented his views on improving USSR-U.S.
 relations.  Sino-Soviet discussions were,( however, unsatisfactory and no
 communique was published.  According to three widely separated and reliable
 sources, in October 1959 the CPSU sent a letter to at least the bloc parties,
 holding fast to Khrushchev's views on USSR-U.S. relations.  In November 1959,

 of CPSU, published an article in Problems
 tlw
 of Peace and Socialism that justified the policy of peaceful coexistence
 as "class struggle on the international plane" and significantly noted
 Lenin's criticism of "Left Communists."  It is known that the Chinese have
 since been accused of criticizing the November 1959 joint program of the
 european parties, which is clearly based upon the same premises as the
 article.  In December 1959, Khrushchev warned the Chinese in stating at
 the Hungarian Party Congress that "we must all synchronize our watches."
 the
 L.       In January 1960, the Chinese positions hardened.  At/Rome meeting
 of the Presidential Committee of the World Peace Council in January 1960 it
 transpired that the Chinese had charged the USSR with seeking to isolate
 China in the interest of achieving a modus vivendi with the U. S.  A
 ? /reliable source states that the USSR in January 1960 informally broached ~to j
 the idea that the Sino-Soviet differences required discussion, only to be
 told by the Chinese that the differences were between the parties and shpul
 not be mentioned.  The CPC appears to have reached important decisions during
 January'thich had a major effect on the dispute.  On 21 January the Standing
 Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a resolution concerning
 disarmament which specified that China would
 bound,,by treaties it
 takes part in framing; and in February 1960, at the meeting of the foreign
 ministers of the Warsaw Pact countries, the Chinese observer, Mang Shengo
 incorporated the statement in his speech, broadening it to include "all
 international agreements."  The contrast between the descriptions of the
 world situation in K'ang Sheng's speech and those given by the European bloc
 speakers was striking.

 5.  It is at this point that the 1957 Moscow declaration first began
 to be quoted to support the conflicting positions, when the People's Daily
 of 6 February 1960 asserted that "the development of the international
 situation has borne out the correctness of the declaration."  It appears
 likely, therefore, that the Chinese decided in late January to take the
 initiative in broadening the debate.  But also on 6 February a verbal message
 from the Central Committee of the CPSU was reportedly delivered in Peiping,,
 0-4
 sking the CPC to attend a meeting to discuss outstanding,pro_b7,   ;
 6.  In mid-April 1960 the Chinese took advantage of the 90th anniversary
 of Lenin's birth to make their most serious public attack on the theoretical
 innovations developed by the CPSU at and after the XXth Party Congress in
 January 1956.  Using oblique but unmistakable arguments, the Chinese challenged
 the premises underlying Soviet foreign policy and by implication disparaged
 Khrushchev's stature as,a Communist theorist.  The Chinese attack comprised
 three major statements:  two articles in the party's theoretical monthly
 Red Flag (issues no. 7 and 8, 1 and 16 April), the first entitled "On
 Imperialism as the Source of War in Modern Times" and the second entitled
 Ltio- U
 "Long Live Leninism," axid-an editorial on 22 April in the authoritative
 newspaper ,the People's Daily.
 7.  The Soviets replied in the speech delivered in Moscow on 22 April
 by Otto Kuusinen of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretariat.  A very
 strong defense of current Soviet foreign policy and of the general lines
 endorsed at the XXth and XXIth CPSU Congresses, his speech confined its
 critical comments to general statements condemning "dogmatic positions

 Sanitized - Approved For RqJaaj"1A-RDP78-00915R001
 as backtiard positions."  On the same day a Chinese Politburo alternate,
 Lu Ting-i, gave a speech in Peiping which incorporated many of the arguments
 of the "Long Live Leninism" article.  The divergences between the two speeches
 were so great that when one Communist party seriously affected by the dispute,
 the Indian party, published both speeches side by side in the 8 May issue of
 its newspaper New Age, without comments, its action aroused considerable
 comment and created confusion among party members.
 8.  The Chinese then began to carry their case to the other parties.
 "Long Live Leninism," the Lu Ting-i speech, and the People's Daily editorial
 of 22 April were translated and published in the widely circulated English
 language Peking Review of 26 April.  At the same time, the first edition of
 a book containing the three articles was produced by the Foreign Languages
 Press in Peiping in many languages for distribution abroad.  Two further editions
 of this book were produced, one in May and the other, after the Bucharest
 confrontations, in August.  The book is known to exist in English, Spanish,
 French, the Eastern European languages (including Russian), and Vietnamese.
 It has been distributed in India and in certain countries at least of Latin
 America and Western Europe.  It appears that the Chinese later attempted to
 circulate the articles in the USSR in one of their two Russian language
 publications, Bruzhba, an action which the Soviets protested.  The magazine
 was in fact suspended from circulation in the USSR after the publication of
 the June issue.  Earlier instances of Soviet refusals to circulate Chinese
 doctrinal writings in the USSR have recently been reported by reliable sources,
 who heard the details during party discussions of the Sino-Soviet differences.

 9.  After the Kuusinen rebuttal of Chinese charges, the CPSU took
 advantage of the 40th anniversary of the publication of Lenin's book
 Leftwing Communism, an Infantile Disorder (10 June 1960)to carry the public
 ideological debate with the Chinese to new heights, including the use of
 the charge of "deviation."  Two Soviet articles published on 10 June, one
 by D. Shevlyagin in the newspaper Soviet Russia and one by N. Matkovsky in
 the party newspaper Pravda, expressed this criticism by attacking "contemporary
 left-wing deviationism" in terms which referred to the positions held by the
 Chinese party.  Both articles highlighted the significance of the 12 Party
 Declaration of November 1957.  Matkovsky characterized it as a "programmatic
 document of the international Communist movement," and as a validation of
 the general line expressed by the CPSU.  Shevlyagin, on the other hand,
 referred particularly to the declaration as authorizing and requiring a struggle
 against "leftist opportunism" as well as against "rightist opportunism" such
 as that of the Yugoslavs.  In discussing manifestations of left opportunism he
 made the significant point that "not only groups of Communists but the leader-
 ship of individual parties have veered into leftist deviationism."  Neither of
 the articles explicitly identified the Chinese as the target of criticism,
 but their relevance to the dispute was unmistakable.
 10.  The timing of this intensification of the Soviet attack on the
 Chinese views coincides with a C1'SU letter on the Summit Conference which
 was circulated, shortly after Khrushchev's return home following the collapse
 of the conference, to the Communist parties of the bloc and those of France
 and Italy.  Although the text of this letter is not available, it seem4ikely

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240024-6
 to have been unacceptable to the Chinese, who emphasized from mid-May on
 that the course of events before and at Paris proved the validity of the
 Chinese arguments concerning imperialism and the illusory and fruitless
 character of negotiation.  Perhaps the worst offense of the Chinese, in Soviet
 eyes, was their argument that the only value of Communist participation in
 such puce negotiations was the purely tactical advantage that came out of
 their eventual exposure of the true character and intentions of the enemy.
 This observation was precisely the kind of statement which the CPSU was most
 eager to avert.
 11.  It is likely too that the CPSU decided at this time to send a
 sharp letter of criticism to the CPC.  One prominent Free world Communist
 who visited Moscow in late May stated that he learned from a member of the
 CPSU Secretariat that a "sharp" letter wa~-:~ being sent to the CPC.    CPSU

 It is also worth noting that the CPC leaders went into closed conference in
 Shanghai on 8 June, a move which may well have been prompted by the receipt
 of the CPSU letters. They were in fact still meeting when the Chinese delegation
 left for the Bucharest party congress.
 12.  The Chinese too made a major move in the now rapidly developing
 dispute.  They did this in early June at the XIth General Council meeting
 of the t?wworld Federation of Trade Unions in Peiping.  On 2 June they presented
 an ultimatum on the official THTU reporttID  the chief Soviet representative,
 who rejected it,  The Chinese claimed that the report contained

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01200240024-6
 attacks on the communes.  At this meeting, which opened on 5 June after a
 five-day delay, in the presence of both WFTU affiliates and representatives
 of some twenty-five unaffiliated national trade union federations, the leading
 Chinese figures Chou En-lai, Liu Shao-ch'i, Liu Ning-i, Teng Hsiao-ping,
 and Liu Chang-sheng publicized the Chinese views on the peace struggle, the
 threat of imperialism, and the "illusions" aroused by the campaigns for
 peaceful coexistence and by programs for giving substantial economic aid to
 bourgeois-led underdeveloped countries.  Using a tactic they had employed
 earlier in April, the Chinese leaders accompanie
 these criticisms with
 fulsome expressions of approval of the Soviet posture towards the U.S. at the
 time of the collapse of the Summit Conference.  This approval of the Soviet
 actions was accompanied by expressions of solidarity with the USSR in its
 stand against U.S. acts of aggression.  It was learned that the CPSU was
 particularly stung by the speeches of Liu Ning-i and Liu Chang-sheng.
 13.  When the Chinese convened a private meeting of Communist party
 members among the delegates to hear a statement of the Chinese criticisms
 of CPSU doctrines, representatives of the CPSU promptly opposed the continuation
 of the talks and made the ominous charge that the Chinese action was a violation
 of the terms of the 12 Party Declaration of November 1957.  This Soviet appeal
 to the authority of the Moscow declaration paralleled the similar appeal
 in the Shevlyagin article published in Moscow, and the charge has since
 figured prominently in the CPSU's presentation of its case.  According to
 credible reports, during the WFTU session Teng Hsiao-ping, general secretary
 of the CPC, accused the CPSU in turn of "throwing the Moscow declaration
 overboard."

 representatives in Peiping not only criticized the Chinese actions in
 personal discussions with foreign Communist representative s but by 9 June
 took concrete steps to enlist the support of other CP's against the Chinese.
 The representative of one Free 'World CP was told, by a representative of the
 Soviet All Union Central Council of Trade Unions, that the Soviet embassy in
 Peiping was interested in knowing if he could stop over in Moscow after the
 end of the conference.
 15.  When a group of European and African delegates to the WFTU
 meeting arrived in Moscow on 13 June, a number of CPSU officials conferred
 with members of this group.  One of the delegates in the group is known to
 have talked privately with a top official, V, Tereshkin, of the CPSU Foreign
 Section, concerning the Sino-Soviet dispute.  The delegate was informed of
 the interpretation the CPSU placed on recent Chinese actions, and Tereshkin
 asked that he have a plenum of his party's central committee convened after
 his return home to discuss the Chinese actions at Peiping and to condemn them
 as violations of the Moscow declaration.  A second person, tentatively
 identified as L. I. Brezhnev, chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,
 was also reported present at this meeting.  According to a statement broadcast
 while the Bucharest congress was in session, representatives of the French
 and Spanish Communist parties held a meeting on 1  and 15 June, at which they
 reaffirmed their adherence to the 12 Party Declaration.  Si:-as the leadership
 of both    these parties was represented in the group of WFTU delegates in
 Moscow at this time, it appears possible that the meeting in question took

 place there and that the reaffirmation was a reaction to the Peiping events.
 16. In contrast to these cryptic endorsements of the Moscow declaration,
 on 19 June 1960 a statement by Agostino Novella, a leading Italian Communist
 and president of the WFTU, was published in the Italian Party newspaper
 Unita.  In this statement, which was also broadcast in Italian from Czechoslovakia
 on 20 June, Novella described the Chinese criticism of the resolutions
 proposed at the WFTU Council meeting in Peiping and, like the 10 June Soviet
 articles, characterized the Chinese views as "deviations."  So far as can be
 determined, this was the first instance in which a Free World Communist party
 publicized this charge against the Chinese.  The appearance of the statement
 coincided with the opening of the 3rd Con,7ress of the Rumanian Workers Party
 in Bucharest, where the next phase of the dispute developed.

 a letter from the CPC which limited its powers to.rO agreeing on a date
 for a party conference to discuss Sino-Soviet differences and.-exchanging
 views, without however, adopting any formal resolution.  The CPSU
 representatives were not successful in obtaining an admission from the
 Chinese delegation of the errors of the CPC.  The Chinese, however,
 reportedly expressed a willingness to correct their positions if in an
 exchange of views with the delegates at Bucharest a majority should prove
 them wrong.  The CPSU~ justifying its action by invoking the November 1957

 stopped in Moscow for an exchange of views on 17 June.  It presented

 The Bucharest debates (20-27 June 1960)
 17.  The Chinese determination to press at Bucharest for Soviet
 adoption of a militant line is suggested by an article in the 16 June issue
 of Red Flag, which, in an obvious reference to the CPSU's earlier
 justification of its views on peace and peaceful coexistence, observed that
 "one cannot separate onQelf from the revisionists merely by stating
 that the forces of socialism predominate over the forces of imperialism."
 Peace Manifesto (not the 12 Party Declaration adopted at the same time),
 insisted that the views of all the Communist parties should eventually be
 0    ascertained before attempting a meeting to reach a final solution.  In this
 context, the Bucharest session should presumably have involved nothing
 but an exchange of views.  The Chinese stated at Bucharest that in Moscow
 the LYbU had first made the proposal that other parties be brought into
 Ryer?"         the debate, but had wished to confine the group to delegates from the bloc
 parties only.  The Chinese said that they had rejected this proposal.  It
 would appear, then, that the Chinese adherence to their instruction forced
 the Soviet!4)hand.

 reached as a result of the Chinese stand on 17 June.  Virtually none of
 the major Free World parties sent top-level delegates to the congress.
 The fact that Khrushchev was to lead the Soviet delegation was announced
 only on June 18, the day of his departure.  All the European satellite
 delegations except Albania were led by persons of national stature equal
 to that of Khrushchev, but the late arrival of Gomulka of Poland and the
 early departure of Novotny of Czechoslovakia suggest that this top-level
 representation was organized on short notice.  The leader of the Chinese
 delegation, Pteng Chen, was clearly outranked by this group.  Fifty--
 parties were represented at the congress.  Twenty-five of the thirty-five
 non-bloc fraternal delegations identified as present were composed of
 second and third echelon party leaders and none of the more significant
 Free World parties, except Chile and Syria, were represented by their
 leaders.
 19.  The Soviet delegation to Bucharest included B. Ponomarev and
 Y. A. Ai4 opov, the heads of the two Central Committee sections for
 relations with the non-bloc parties-"respectively,  During the first days
 of the congress they and their colleagues concentrated on briefing fraternal
 25X1A6c_       (delegates.   It is known that a group of English-speaking delegates and a
 second group comprising those who spoke Spanish were called together
 25X1A6c
 separately and briefed from a long letter which the CPSU intended to issue
 to all parties.  The letter had apparently been either completed or revised
 at the last moment, for it contained the Soviet account of the Moscow
 exchanges of 17 June and explained the Soviet view of how the inter-party
 discussion should be handled.  The inclusion of Wu Hsiu-chtuan, the deputy
 director of the CPC's International Liaison Department, as one of the
 four Chinese delegates suggests that the Chinese too planned to exploit
 their supporters and acquaintances among the delegates.

 the Sino-Soviet dispute is in some respects contradictory.  The following
 probable chronology, however, emerges from an analysis of the available
 information.
