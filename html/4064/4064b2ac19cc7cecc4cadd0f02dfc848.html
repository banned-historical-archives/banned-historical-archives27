 Political, sociological, and economic data, including monetary
 conversion rates, generally reflect information through mid-April
 1973, except for population estimates, which have been projected to
 1 July 1973. Military manpower estimates are as of 1 July 1973
 except for average number of males reaching military age, which
 are projected averages for the 5-year period 1973-77. Military and
 communications data are as of 1 April 1973 unless otherwise indicated.
 Most of the land utilization estimates are rough approximations,
 and most of the statistical data are rounded (thousands and millions).
 Figures for "arable" may reflect only the area actually under crops
 rather than the potential cultivable. Fishing limits are included
 only when they differ from the territorial limits.
 For some countries GDP, rather than GNP, is shown. The difference
 between the two is in the addition or subtraction of the value of
 return on foreign investment. GDP equals GNP plus income earned
 in the country but sent abroad, minus income earned abroad but
 sent into the country. GDP thus tends to exceed GNP in debtor
 countries, and the reverse is true in creditor countries.
 Major ports are the largest maritime ports of the country,
 relative to other ports of the same country, on the basis of
 estimated port capacity, alongside berthing accommodations, and
 commercial or naval importance. Minor ports are the remaining ports
 of a country which have, relative to the major ports, significantly
 lower estimated port capacity, fewer alongside berthing accommodations,
 are of less commercial or naval importance. Major transport aircraft
 are those weighing over 20,000 pounds. Military budgets are in U.S.
 dollar equivalents. The dollar sign refers to U.S. dollars unless
 otherwise stated. The abbreviation FY stands for U.S. fiscal year;
 all years are calendar years unless otherwise indicated.

 port serves also as important supply depot for fuel, water, and ships' wares.
 Recently built dockyards and machine shops provide maintenance and repair
 services to 3,500-4,000 vessels that call at Gibraltar each year.
 U.K. military establishments and civil government employ nearly half the insured
 labor force. Local industry is confined to manufacture of tobacco, roasted
 coffee, ice, mineral waters, candy, and canned fish. Some factories for
 manufacture of clothing are being developed. A small segment of local
 population makes its livelihood by fishing. In recent years tourism has
 increased in importance.

 ECONOMY:
 Principal economic activities of San Marino are farming, livestock raising, light
 manufacturing, and tourism; the government's total budget for FY71 is about
 $12 million, with the largest share of revenue derived from the sale of
 postage stamps throughout the world and from payments by the Italian
 government in exchange for Italy's monopoly in retailing tobacco, gasoline,
 and a few other goods; main problem is finding an additional $3 million to
 finance badly needed water and electric power systems expansions
 Agriculture: principal crops are wheat (average annual output about 4,400 metric
 tons/year) and grapes (average annual output about 700 metric tons/year);
 other grains, fruits, vegetables, and animal feedstuffs are also grown;
 livestock population numbers roughly 6,000 cows, oxen, and sheep; cheese
 and hides are most important livestock products
 Electric power: obtained from Italy
 Manufacturing: consists mainly of cotton textile production at Serravalle, brick
 and tile production at Dogane, cement production at Acquaviva, Dogane, and
 Fiorentino, and pottery production at Boy-go Maggiore; some tanned hides,
 paper, candy, baked goods, Moscato wine, and gold and silver souvenirs are
 also produced
 Foreign transactions: dominated by tourism; in summer months 20,000 to 30,000
 foreigners visit San Marino every day; a number of hotels and restaurants
 have been built in recent years to accommodate them; remittances from
 Sanmarinese abroad also represent an important net foreign inflow; commodity
 trade consists primarily of exchanging building stone, lime, wood, chestnuts,
 wheat, wine, baked goods, hides, and ceramics for a wide variety of consumer
 manufactures

 Highways: about 65 mi.
