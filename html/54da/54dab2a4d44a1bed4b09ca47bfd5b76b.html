 Speech by General Walters to the
 International Affairs Institute at
 Fort Meade, Md. on 16 Sep 74
 DDCI Speech
 16 September 1974
 MODERATOR:         On behalf of the officers and members of the.
 IAI, I'd like to welcome you to this first in the 1974-75
 lecture series.           And before I forget, I should mention that one
 of the traditional rules of the IAI, for today's speaker as well
 as subsequent speakers, is non-attribution.  Everything's off
 the record.
 When the newly elected officers of the IAI met
 for the first time a few weeks ago to come up with our slate of
 speakers for this year, we resolved that we would do our very
 best to ensure that the first speaker in particular was the best,,
 and so we were delighted when Lt. General Vernon Walters accepted
 our invitation to meet with us today.  I think some of you know
 General Walters personally.   I think probably everyone knows him
 through achievement and reputation.
 It's virtually impossible to identify General.
 Walters with any particular professional label.  He is a man of
 many parts.   I think he personally would prefer to be thought of
 primarily as an Army man, a military officer.  And he has had a
 distinguished military career.   It began in May of 1941 when

 Private Walters enlisted in the Army Field Artillery.  About a
 year later 2nd Lt. Walters, U.S. Army Infantry, was a leader of
 a, reconnaissance and intelligence platoon.   In November of '42
 he participated in the assault landing in Morocco, for which he
 was awarded the Legion of Merit.  From there it was Algeria,.
 Tunisia and, eventually, Italy, where first he served as aide to
 General Mark Clark and later on as the combat liaison officer to
 the First Brazilian Infantry Division, and so on, through to the'-
 present, a truly distinguished military career, including service
 in Vietnam in 1967.
 In addition to being a military officer, he is
 an Attache.  As a matter of fact, in the view of many he is'
 been Army Attache in Rio de Janeiro and Rome.
 11V.  WVt1u.   r1G   laa~
 He was Attache at
 large under Ambassador Harriman, with duty station-in Paris, and,
 eventually, Defense Attache in France, a post he held until May
 of 1972.
 He is a linguist -- and that's probably the
 understatement of the century -- expert linguist (standing all)
 at his truly remarkable feats and accomplishments inihe linguistic _
 field.
 When I first laid eyes on him it was several years
 ago.   He was standing on the podium on the White House lawn

 flanked on the one side by the President of the United States
 and on the other side by the President of France, translating
 for both of them over international radio and television.  He's
 done the same thing countless times whether the language was
 Portuguese, Italian, French, German, or what have you.
 He is a diplomat.  He has, among other things,
 served as assistant to the President of the Geneva Conference in
 1953.   He has been, variously, aide, staff assistant, special
 assistant, to people such as George C. Marshall, then Secretary
 of State; President Truman; President Eisenhower and President
 Nixon.   He has accompanied Vice Presidents and Presidents on
 countless round-the-world historic missions, including for
 example the meeting between President Truman and General MacArthur
 on Wake Island.
 It goes without saying that he is one of the
 foremost intelligence officers in the United States.  His career
 in the intelligence field was capped in May of 1972 when he was
 sworn in as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, the post he
 now holds.
 He has (been) all these things, and more.  And
 the reason he comes to meet with us today is the fact that he,
 for the last 25 years, has. been an extraordinary statesman for
 the United States.   People that we here know of as legendary names

 he knows as intimate friends.   World leaders over these past 25
 years have come to seek his advice and counsel on countless
 occasions.  And so we are proud to have him here today.  And it
 is a great pleasure for me, and privilege, to inroduce to you
 truly a man for all seasons, Lt. General (Dick) Walters.
 [Applause.]
 DDCI: After an introduction like that, I don't know where
 I can go except down.   Jerry was kind enough to say that I was
 a diplomat, but I have it on higher authority that I am not.
 [Laughter.]   One day I was standing in a parade in Brazil along-
 side the Soviet Ambassador, and he spoke very good English.   He
 had been in the States for six years.  And he said to me: "The
 trouble with you Americans is you never bother to learn anybody
 else's language.  Always you demand that people speak English to
 you."  And I thought, he hasn't read my biography like I've read
 his.   I said:   "That isn't true any more.   It may have been true
 20 years ago, but it's not true any more."  Then he said, "Oh, yes.
 And besides us people you do not have gift for languages like we
 (Slavs)."  So I said to him --        I hope there are no Russian-.
 speaking ladies in the audience.   I said to h'm, ,[T   F a ~"+ --
 which I would loosely translate as garbage in English except that
 isn't the literal meaning of it in Russian.   [Laughter.]   "And I
 am astounded that an intelligent man like you, who's lived outside

 the Soviet Union, continues to believe these fairy tales of
 Communist propaganda."  So that shook him.   [Laughter.]   And I
 stepped in for the kill, and that's where disaster struck.   I
 said to him in Russian, "Mr. Ambassador, would you like to try
 Portuguese?" knowing that I spoke it much better than he did.
 And he looked at me and he said, "Walters, you may be good
 soldier; diplomat you are not."   [Laughter.]   So I have it on,
 you know, fairly high authority.
 I might add that one of the first things I did when
 I came into my present job was to ask, "Where is Andrey
 that's one thing for sure."   [Laughter.]
 Andreyevich Fomin?" And they said he's Ambassador to Bangladesh.
 [Laughter.]   And I said, "Well, he's not going up the ladder,
 You have very good speakers out here all the time
 with whom I couldn't possibly compete.   But I thought I would
 talk a little bit about people, people that the various oddities
 of my jobs have run me into from time to time, because I think
 sometimes we tend to get fascinated with the technological aspects
 of intelligence and forget a little bit the human aspects.  And
 I think this is particularly true in dealing with foreigners.
 You know, Americans are very organized -- we have disclosure
 policies and policies for this and policies for that.  Well, my
 experience is that relatively few other countries have policies --

 if they like you, they'll tell you and if they don't, they won't.
 And the human aspect plays perhaps the more important part inthe
 intelligence business with other people.
 I know when I was Attache to France --      I'll tell
 you one amusing story (that) the Head of the French Intelligence,
 Military Intelligence Service, told me after he retired and he
 was asking me to help him get a job.   I went to France in 1967
 just about the time we got thrown out of the bases and so forth
 there, and he said to me --     This is, (well), many years after-
 wards.  He said:  "You know, when you came here, under those
 circumstances, with a long French background and knowledge of
 France and the French language, we were sure that the Americans
 had sent you here to stir up the Army for NATO.and against
 De Gaulle."  And he said:   "The fact that you were a bachelor
 opened the possibility of two handles we might get on to you,
 so-we watched you closely.   And finally when neither of them
 worked out, we came to the conclusion that you were like the
 traditional Bishop -- never in your own diocese."   [Laughter.
 Applause.]
 It's not often that the Head of the other side tells
 you something like this.   But one of the things the French said
 to me:   You never ask awkward questions when you visit a military
 unit.    Why not?  Well, I said, I figure France is a sophisticated

 country, and when I go somewhere, you send a note to the commander
 of the unit and tell him what he can tell me; and if he doesn't
 tell me, it's because he's not authorized to.  And why should I ask
 a question that will embarrass the guy when he has to tell me he
 can't answer and embarrass-me when he tells me he can't answer.
 I am more interested in projecting a favorable image of my country
 and the service I represent, because I have found that if you do
 this successfully you get a great deal.  And in fact, when I
 arrived in France in 1967, it was a pretty hostile and a pretty
 cool environment.   Before I left,.I'd been into the French missile
 silos and into the submarine ().   I did ask for that, however,
 but I had to connive.
 The French Chairman was coming to the United States
 and they asked me what he wanted to see, and I already was thinking
 ahead.   I said he undoubtedly wants to see Minuteman silos.  And
 the Americans wrung their hands and said, "Oh, that's very difficult."
 And I said, "I know, but he wants to see them," and we showed him
 Minuteman silos.  A couple of years later General Wheeler was
 coming to France and the French said to me, "What does General
 Wheeler want to see?"   I said he wants to see silos.  And they said,
 u rave
 "Oh, that's very difficult."   I said, "Oh no.   General Fo
 saw our American silos."  So we got into the French silos  [Laughter]  -
 which shows that you need a little advance planning in some of these
 things.

 Well, what I thought I would do is talk about the
 human dimension and some of the people (in) some of the ways:
 .they reacted to various things, obviously drawing on my own
 memory and experience with them for various things, and by
 watching these people you learn a lot about, you know, how to
 deal with people.   I was very young at the time of some of these.
 I remember I went to the Bermuda conference in 1953,
 and Sir Winston Churchill was there, and the French were asking
 for help in Vietnam.  And at the meeting Churchill kind of put
 them down rather harshly and suddenly he realized what he was
 doing and he decided that he was going to pay a tribute to the
 Frenchman, who was        [sp?], who had been the President of
 the National Council of Resistance inside German-occupied France
 during the war since the Prime Minister got sick.  And he said -
 in (tlies4) marvelous Churchillian tones he said:   "If I say what
 I say, it is because for 40 years I have stood alongside our
 French comrades as they sought to preserve themselves from the
 mortal peril that threatened them.  But let us never forget that
 g IDpaV%
 Mr. B.e.edo here sitting with us living during the whole long night
 of the occupation of those four dreadful years in mortal peril
 of his life for every hour (of) every minute (in) every day, and
 in so doing --"     No.   "And then when we reached Paris he was
 there waiting for us under the Arch of Triumph, and in so doing

 he earned the undying gratitude of the entire free world."  By
 this time there wasn't a dry eye in the conference hall.
 :{Laughter.]    Churchill was sobbing, Eisenhower was sobbing,
 the Frenchman had his face buried.in his hands, and I was so
 strangled with sobs I couldn't translate for a few minutes. And
 then Mr. Eden spoiled everything.  He said, "George, after a
 bouquet like that you've got to do something" --.  [Laughter]  --
 which really let it down.
 But anyway, that Frenchman - Churchill had said no
 to him all morning but he didn't go away from that conference
 with the impression that he had been told no, or if he did, it
 was much more mitigated than if he'd been told nothing.     Which
 leads me to another observation I make about these things, which
 is that anybody who says "flattery will get you nowhere" has
 never had any.   [Laughter.]   Throughout a long career I have seen
 used with extreme skill.     I would say the greatest form of
 flattery I know is to quote a man to himself.
 Recently I went to Portugal to see General Spinola.
 And I went on the night train -- not secretly, but it was a little
 more discrete than coming in at the main Lisbon airport     and I
 AAD
 spent all night reading "Portugal       the Future" by General
 Spinola.   I gout out of the train at 10 o'clock and at 11 o'clock
 I was in Spinola's office and at regular 10-minute intervals I.

 Approved For Release 2002/10/30 : CIA-RDP80R01731R002000090001-4
 would drop a quote from "Portugal in the Future."  We had a
 great time.   [Laughter.]
 I must say that while T was talking to him I was
 bothered by one thing.  I had heard a Brazilian story -- and the
 Brazilian stories are always a little bit hostile to the
 Portuguese in their way but you can,'t join in, but they always
 sort of portray the Portuguese as hayseeds -- and while I was
 talking to Spinola I kept looking at the monocle and remembering
 what the Brazilian said, that the monocle was the Portuguese
 version of the contact lens.   [Laughter.]   But I must say, he
 was rather impressive and he wasn't at all the sort of dramatic
 type that you might expect from that.
 During the war I remember that Mr. Churchill came
 to see the Brazilian division I was with, and they had not yet
 fired a shot.     Oh, Mr. Churchill got up there, Sir Winston got
 up there, and he said to them, "Brazilian and American comrades  =
 in arms."  Well, once he'd said that, it didn't matter what else
 he said-.  The fact that they had been called "comrades in arms"
 by Churchill before they fired a shot was all that was required
 to put them in a very happy frame of mind.  And he was a most
 extraordinary man.
 Once I was talking to a Frenchman, and he came up,
 and I withdrew discr e ely because I thought he could speak French
 10

 (he)
 (and) would talk to him, and I stepped off at some distance.
 And finally he said a few words and then he beckoned me back
 'and he said:   "Until I was 70 I could speak French; now it is
 more difficult.   Come back here."   [Laughter.]
 One of the other people with whom these things
 (were) very important was De Gaulle.   I first met General
 De Gaulle in 1942 when I took him a message from North Africa.
 I saw him on and off at various times during the war.   Once I
 was in (Fifth) Army, and he came, and they'd told me to be
 sure and be there because he didn't speak English.  And when
 I protested that he.must have because he had been living in
 London for four years, they showed me a newpaper article that
 said he didn't.  And in those days I was young and naive and
 I generally believed what I read in the newspapers.   [Laughter.]
 So I went up into the van with General Clark with him, and they
 were discussing the withdrawal of the four French divisions in
 Italy to go into the south of France.  And it was soon pretty
 clear to me that he didn't-speak English, because General Clark
 would say no, and General De Gaulle would say  [.n  Fyenrh]~  and I
 would say [ Imo=--~= T] ,   [Laughter.]
 So I was a little emboldened by this and I began to
 add some comments in English, such as:   General De Gaulle says"yes

 think if you push him a little harder he'll give.   [Laughter.]
 And at the end of the meeting he stood up and he turned to
 General Clark and he said, "General Clark, we have had a very
 interesting conversation."   [Laughter.]    "I am sure the next
 time we meet it will be on the liberated soil of France."
 When I stepped aside to let him out of the van -- and it's a
 metal wall in the van, but I'm sure the print of my body, which
 was much thinner in those days, is still imprinted on the van --
 he tapped me on the shoulder and he said, "Walters, you did a
 very good job."  That was the last time I have ever dabbled with
 anything I was translating.   [Laughter.]
 When I went back to Paris in 1967, I saw him at a
 lunch and he said, "Oh, I see you're back in Paris.",  "Yes."
 He said, "How long?"  And I almost said, "Well, it was on that
 biographical slip, the (DST), put on your desk earlier before
 lunch."  But I thought it was better not to, so I told him.  And
 he said:   "Let me see.   The last time I saw you was in Italy in
 General Clark's van in Ift a village named, ah, ah -- well, I can't
 remember, but it was in General Clark's van, wasn't it?"  And I
 said, "Yes, General, it was."  And I could see for a minute he
 thought, and he said, "The village's name was (   J ub,&4 '^ a) ,
 wasn't it?"  And that was`l'yearslater.   He named the village,
 and I don't think that any of the French Services could have given
 him that particular fact.

 But he was an interesting man to talk to, and I
 participated in a number of interesting conversations between
 ==him and General Eisenhower.  One night at (Rambouillet) Castle
 they both put on their bathrobes and sat in front of the fire
 and talked about -`ghat about during the war; why didn't you
 tell me; did you know; yes, I did, but Roosevelt wouldn't let
 me, and so forth and so on.  And (he) got on to French atomic
 policy, and I think this is something that has been greatly
 reflected in whatever the French have been doiri.g.since then.
 General Eisenhower was assuring him that he didn't need nuclear
 weapons, that the American umbrella would take care of everybody,
 and he said, "Yes, it will-now --"      We're in. 1960.  He said:
 "It will now because you still have what essentially amounts to
 a monopoly.   But as the Soviets develop the ability to strike the
 cities of North America, you're not going to war - one of your
 successors is not going to war, nuclear war, for anything short
 of a strike against North America.   And when that happens and
 the Russians attack with-2.00 divisions in Europe, I need the
 means of turning what your successor may want to be a conventional
 war into a nuclear war."  He said:   "Understand. me clearly.   I
 don't intend to compete with SAC or the long-range  air army)
 I simply want to have the means of forcing them to do something
 they don't want to do.  And you must understand that the addition

 of new centers of decision for the use of nuclear weapons will
 multiply the problem (and) the uncertainty of the Soviet planner."
 ,.He said:       "You tell me I don't need these things, but if you
 don't have them, you don't count in the world."  And he said:
 "I cannot accept that it is dangerous for me to have'something
 that a thousand Soviet corporals already know when you know I

 didn't do this.  The socialists decided titis                e
 said -- and this is very interesting because he hadn't announced
 the withdrawal from Algeria yet -- he said:  "I'm going to with-
 draw that French Army from Algeria as we've already withdrawn
 it from Indochina.  And if I don't give those armed forces a
 sense of having a mission in the second half of the 20th century,
 I'm not going to have armed forces on my hands; I'm going to have
 600,000 armed malcontents.   French democracy won't last."
 And he told General Eisenhower in September 1959,
 in my presence, that he would detonate his first nuclear weapon
 on the-13th of February 1960.   And 'on the 13th of February 1960
 he detonated his first nuclear weapon.  He had said what kilo-
 tonnage it would be, and it was that kilotonnage. But in that
 conversation he had'given away the intelligence, which with
 General Eisenhower's permission I passed on to a very restricted
 group of people in the U.S. intelligence community,  Bait he did

 tell (him) the exact date on which he would set off (a) weapon.
 Now, obviously, weather helped him, and everything else, and
 'everything worked out favorably.   But he had set the 13th of
 February as the target date for it L,,4, OIr       "? t  J
 Another interesting thing occurred at the conference
 of the U-2.   I was there as the American-French translator.  And
 we got there, and De Gaulle had seen Khrushchev, who had read a
 long statement in which he demanded that Eisenhower apologize.
 And De Gaulle said, "That's silly.  He's not going to be able to
 do that."   And Khrushchev said that he must, he must, he must.
 So the day of the conference came, and De Gaulle was
 running the conference in the (Elysee), and we went in to the
 conference room, and the Russians were all over in the corner
 and, unlike, you      , at most of these things (when) everybody
 a, r,44
 shakes hands                    w t-he. stayed bunched up, and the
 British, French and Americans talked to one another anddwe sat
 down.   General De Gaulle opened the conference and he said that
 General Eisenhower is the only member who is here, besides myself,
 of course - De Gaulle - who is also a Chief of State, so I propose
 to let him talk first.  And Khrushchev said, "No.   I want to talk
 first."  So after some shilly-shallying around, he let Khrushchev
 talk first.  And Khrushchev stood up, and his hands were trembling,
 and he read the statement which he had read to De Gaulle the

 previous day, and De Gaulle was obviously very bored with
 1
 hearing it a second timed  m*NWP as Khrushchev read 9V
 I was told not to wear a uniform because this was
 a peace conference, but I was at the extreme right of the U.S.
 Delegation and immediately adjacent, to me was Marshal of the
 Soviet Union, Rodion Malino,/sky [\], wearing 54 medals,
 including the U.S. Legion of Merit.   [Laughter.]    I know
 because I counted them.. JCO Khrushchev became more and more
 indignant about being overflown, and finally he raised his
 voice, and De Gaulle interrupted and turned to the Russian
 interpreter and he said:  "Will you please tell the Chairman
 that the acoustics in this room are excellent.. Everyone can
 hear him clearly, and there is no need for him to raise his
 ~o
 voice."  Well, the Russian interpreter turned  ale [Laughter]
 fre -
 with this.  And I saw De Gaulle watching his Russian interpretert.St?b u6.
 checking the translation of the Ran interpreter to see
 whether he was really translating it.
 Khrushchev looked kind of nonpluled, sviauZ' he
 went on.' And he said, "And I was overflown."  De Gaulle said,
 "So was I.  Today."  And Khrushchev said, "By your American
 allies?"  De Gaulle said, "No!   By you."  Khrushchev said,
 "What do you mean?"  And General De Gaulle said:   "Well, that
 satellite you launched to impress all of us, the day before

 you left Moscow, overflew France 18 times yesterday without my
 permission.   How do I know that you did not have cameras in it?"
 Khrushchev raised his hands to heaven and he said - [In Russian] --
 "God sees me.   My hands are clean. You don't think I would do a
 thing like that."   [Laughter.]  And General De Gaulle said,
 "Well, what about those pictures of the far side of the moon
 that you showed us with such pride?"  And Khrushchev said, "Oh.
 Well, in that one I had a camera."  And De Gaulle said, "Oh, in
 that one you had a camera.   Proceed."   [Laughter.]
 So he went on, raving to the end. And then he said
 that unless Eisenhower apologized he would not go on with the
 work of the conference.  And I could see Eisenhower --      I've
 heard all about General Eisenhower's temper but, frankly,  (in the)
 many years of working for him I never saw it burst out.   But
 there was a red flush that came up from the neck and over the face,
 and when you saw that, you knew that the wisest thing was to break
 off whatever subject you were discussing., In fact, by looking in
 v ti e V\~ I - testa,,
 the morning I could tell you lc.o ,-       s not the day to take up
 serious business on some particular subject.
 T64 Khrushchev sat down.  And De Gaulle said:  "Well,
 when the U-2 was shot down I sent my Ambassador to Moscow to see
 you and ask you whether this conference should be held.  And you
 said, yes, it should; it would be fruitful.  And you knew then

 everything you know now.  You have now made demands that the
 President of the United States clearly can't accept, and that
 this conference, if you persist in this, is doomed to failure.
 And for this reason you have brought Mr. McMillian [sp?] here
 from London; you have brought General Eisenhower here from the
 United States; and, what is more, you have put me to grave
 personal inconvenience" --  [Laughter]  --which was clearly the `^4\o_
 -'6A eM
 .serious offense of the three.   [Laughter.] He said, "This is
 an affair of minor espionage           Chiefs of ~ State shlt
 r,CC tit I K4
 And Khrushchev said, "What devil has put
 the Americans up to this?"  And De Gaulle said:  "The same
 devils that have put you up to all sorts of other different
 things --  [Laughter]  -- but this conference should be above
 devils."   And he said, "I propose we meet tomorrow afternoon at"-
 whatever the time was.  Khrushchev said, "I won'-Lt go!" and
 stomped out of the room.  And General De Gaulle took General
 Eisenhower by the arm and me with the other arm, and he took us
 out on,the stairway and he said:  "I don't know what's going to
 happen or what Khrushchev is going to do.   But whatever happens
 and whatever he does, I want you to know we are with you to the
 end."  And Eisenhower was, obviously, very moved by this.
 When I came back to France seven years later, after
 we'd been ordered out of these bases, I wondered what had led us

 Approved For Release 2002/10/30 : CIA-RDP80R01731R002000090001-4
 from that to the ordering out of the bases.  And I had a lot of
 friends in old General De Gaulle's entourage --      I never
 talked to him really directly about this, except after he'd left
 (power).  And I came to the following conclusion, and IGNommAt --
 This is my own personal conclusion, and I can't prove it by two
 and two or anything else.   But it's my conclusion that at the
 time of the Cuban crisis when President Kennedy sent Dean Acheson
 and Sherman Kent over to see De Gaulle and tell him that we
 might have to do something to Cuba, De Gaulle, unlike most of
 the other people, said, "Well, if you feel it's necessary, go
 ac~tt rS ~'~
 right ahead."  When we didn't, he said to his:   "If they're
 not going to fight for Cuba 95 miles away, why should we believe
 -eve--rP
 they'll f
 ight for Europe 3500 miles away?  An& I must draw the

 `-befor.e,,,This is when he became convinced he'd have to have his
 own trigger.    He did say, right up to the end, when I saw him
 privately, that - you know,. he disapproved of many of the things
 that we were doing, but in case of a general war he would fight
 for the West, since he had no other possibility of a course.  He
 did not really believe that he could remain neutral in such a
 circumstance.

 He was a complex man.   And as I say, he seriously
 meant at this conference that the really bad offense was not
 bringing Eisenhower from the United States but having him,General
 De Gaulle, set up this conference which wasn't going to work.
 He once said to Mr. Murphy, Ambassador Murphy, that
 the trouble with Mr. Murphy was that he didn't understand France
 and the French.  And Ambassador Murphy said that he'd lived in
 France and he thought he did understand France and the French
 since he'd lived there for 17 years;.  And De Gaulle said,
 "Seventeen years.   I've lived here for 2000," and (you) really
 believed it.   [Laughter.]
 One of the other odd people I had to deal with at
 one time was Mr. Mossadegh, who was the Prime Minister of Iran.
 I went there with Mr. Harriman.  He was sent by President Truman
 to try and mediate the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, and this was
 really a lesson in some of the things, you know, that were mind-
 boggling to an American, who thinks of policy as being something
 carefully worked out and everything else,  because at one time
 Mossadegh was demanding more money per barrel than oil was selling
 for in the Persian Gulf.  And Mr. Harriman in exasperation said,
 "Dr. Mossadegh, if we're going to talk about these things seriously,
 we must have agreement about certain fundamental principles."
 And Mossadegh said, "Such as what?"  And Mr. Harriman said:   "Such
 20

 Approved For Release 2002/10/30 : CIA-RDP80R01731R002000090001-4
 as nothing can be larger than the sum of its parts.  We can't
 give you more per barrel than oil is selling for, and they'll
 buy it in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia."  Mossadegh said, "That's
 false."  Mr. Harriman said, "False?"  Did he say false?"  I said,
 "Yes, he said false."   [Laughter.] He said, "Explain yourself."
 "Well," said Mossadegh, "consider the fox.   His tail is often
 much longer than he is."  And that made a reasonable argument to
 him as to why you could get more than the sum of the thing.
 [Laughter.]
 Another one,  (when) Mr. Harriman would point out that
 something that he was doing would cause frightful trouble to Iran
 this was all done in French because he didn't want any Persian
 interpreters to know what he was offering -z:s--     All of
 these discussions were held in French.  And one of his favorite
 phrases when you'd point something bad out to him, fte'd say -
 -- which I translate4loosely as "To hell with us.
 Down the drain we go."  And that seemed a perfectly acceptable
 option:
 And then I got involved in translating for the British
 and him.   And at one point the British negotiator was a rich - a

 with Mossadegh -- and again this was going on in French and I was
 translating it -- and Mossadegh said:               "The trouble with you is

 that you're a Catholic; that's why we can't come to an agree-
 ment."  And Stokes said, "What has that got to do with this?"
 And Mossadegh said:   "Well, you see, in your religion you don't
 have any divorce, but in ours all you've got to do is say three
 times to your wife 'I divorce thee' and she's divorced.  And you
 don't understand that we have divorced the Anglo-Iranian Oil
 Company."   [Laughter.]    And Stokes' was equal to the occasion.
 He said, "Dr. Mossadegh, quite true.   But remember, you still
 have to pay her alimony until she remarries."  [Laughter.]
 You know, these things sound crazy but they're the
 basis on which some of these decisions and some of these things
 are done, and it sounds absolutely outlandish and mind-boggling
 to us but a lot of these people reason 4t6(,J    -  I mean, there is
 a sense of humor in all this and everything.     B ut the point I'm
 trying to get is that all of their decisions are not made--'on the
 basis of cold, calm, quiet study of something; there is a much
 higher emotional content than is normally the case with us, and

 the atmospherics of these things               .
 When Mossadegh came here --
 Mossadegh was deaf
 in one ear and I had great trouble hearing him, and he'd always
 receive Mr. Harriman sitting in bed with a Mao-type camel hair
 tunic buttoned up to this.  And when you went into the room he'd
 greet you with a flutter like this and you could tell what kind

 of a day you were going to have.   If you got a real cheery
 flutter, it was going to be all right.   If you got sort of a
 =languid one, you were in for trouble.
 And Mossadegh had defeated Lenin.   Lenin once said
 you've got to take a step backward in order to take two forward.
 But Mossadegh had perfected the art of taking a step forward in
 order to take two backwards.   [Laughtar.]   You would negotiate
 all day with him to get him from B to C, and when you came in
 the next day, he wasn't at C, he wasn't even at B, he was back
 at A.  And this was a very exasperating business.
 I remember he came over here and I was assigned to
 him, and everybody went through a phase of "I can settle the
 Iranian oil problem" -- the State Department, the White  House,
 the Defense Department -- everybody.  And I was talking with
 Mossadegh with Ambassador McGhee          who was the head of
 Greek-Turkish-Iranian Affairs in the Department of State, in the
 Waldorf Astoria.   But in order to maintain his thing of a simple
 underdeveloped country he had a camp bed moved into a luxury
 suite in the Waldorf Astoria so (he) could be photographed in this
 camp bed, showing that he was living a very proletarian existence
 in the rich, prosperous United States.   So Mr. McGhee had to go
 back to Washington, and - I might as well tell you his name -
 Ambassador Ernie Gross          who was American Ambassador to the

 United Nations, decided that he could solve the Iranian oil
 problem.   So he came to me and he said, "Colonel Walters, I
 want you to make an appointment for Dr. Mossadegh this afternoon."
 Well, I knew that the State Department didn't want anybody else
 dabbling in, but he was an Ambassador and what could I .do?  So
 I made the appointment.  And by this time Mossadegh was convinced
 he'd come (to) the United Nations, that the United Nations was
 a tool of British imperialism which was going to tell him to give
 back this oil, and he was very upset with the United Nations.
 So I went in with Ambassador Gross, and we got a
 very, very poor flutter [Laughter],and he said, "Dr. Mossadegh,
 I'm your friend.   I want to help you," and "I'm Ambassador Ernie
 Gross."  And Mossadegh looked at him over this enormous nose
 that made Jimmy Durante's look like an amputee [Laughter] and he
 said, "Ambassador?  What are you Ambassador to?"  And Gross said,
 "Oh, I'm Ambassador to the United Nations."  With that, Mossadegh
 let out a shriek as though he had been stabbed with a butcher
 knife and went into a convulsive fit of weeping, repeating over
 and over"The United Nations.   Oh! my God, the United Nations."
 $L   ankly, I'd seen a lot of quiet crocodile tears but I'd never
 seen this violent outburst before.   So I said to Ambassador Gross,
 "I think we'd bette  leave."  Well, he was horrified by what he'd

 outside in the corridor he looked at me and he said, "Does he
 do this often?"   [Laughter.]    And I told him the truth.   I said,
 "I've seen lots of quiet crocodile tears but I            seen a
 convulsive outburst like this."  He said, "You haven't?  Then you
 must never tell anybody he did it for me."   [Laughter.]

 things.

 I said, "If it's only on the cheeks and nothing else is involved,
 go right ahead."   [Laughter.]   So I said to him, "Don't you

 of expectations of hope with nothing to sell?"  He looked at me

 you realize how much safer I am going back with nothing to sell?"
 (Well) in the middle of all this there was foxy thinking going on.
 .;But as I say, you know, we tend to think of all these political
 decisions as being made somewhat.the way we make them, but they
 are not.         And when we read and we listen and we hear what people
 are saying and we have other technical indications, these are not
 always the only basis on. which these things are operated.
 Not long ago I went to
 see General Franco, about
 a month before he got sick, and he was very feeble and he was
 shaky from Parkinson's disease, but the questions he asked were
 very clear and very.lucid ones and at (a) high level. And I said
 to the Prime Minister afterwards, "Does he keep abreast of every-
 thing?"  He said, "No.   He just wants to be the master in the big
 things."  And he looked at me and he said, "And in the big things,
 he still is."
 General Eisenhower once asked him what he thought of
 the Communist world, and Ttmosn, he gave a most dispassionate and,
 detached accounts
 Another time I was sent to see him and talk to him
 about what would happen when he died.  And if you can think of

 and I have appointed him without becoming a lame duck, and when
 the time arrives all of this will operate smoothly."  It remains
 to be seen whether it will or not.
 But I must say, he impressed me as being a most

 any immediate plans for leaving.
 Not all of these things have gone off as well as

 Shortly after I arrived in Paris as the Military Attache in 1967,
 I got a call from an old British friend of mine who had been at
 SHAPE with me in the early 'SOs.  And since he wore a monocle and
 a Iplacatch kilt he was a little more conspicuous than most of
 the other British officers.there.   [Laughter.] So he called me
 up and he said, "What's happened to you, old boy?"  So I told him
 about all my triumphs and campaigns and promotions, and I wound
 up by saying:   "And I am now the new American Military Attache to
 Paris.   I am now a Brigadier General.   But just between us, I'm
 on the list for Major General."  And I said to him with some

 condescension, "What's happened to you, old boy?"  He said,
 "Old boy, I am the Governor General of New Zealand."   [Laughter.]
 And as I paused for breath he said', "And I knighted my Prime
 Minister before I left.."   [Laughter.]   I said, "Bernard, I will
 never play one-upmanship with you again.  [Laughter.]
 Not long ago I went to see Peron, and I saw him
 alone for an hour and 45 minutes.  I'd known him many years
 before.  And I'd talked to a lot of medical people about his
 conditions and I was told what to look for.  And I saw none of
 the swollen ankles, and the dilated blood vessels, and the loss
 of thread of what he: was talking about, and so forth and so on.
 And I came back and reported that, you know, he was (in) splendid

 But I had an interesting conversation ?since within
 CIA I had had a considerable discussion with some/~of our people
 who had drawn up an estimate in which they said they felt that
 Peron would be forced by circumstances to move very far left, to
 a position extremely hostile to us.  And I said I didn't think
 this would be the case for a number of reasons.  First of all,
 when he came back he chose to be inaugurated in uniform (cam) aS a%_
 Lt. General, and that was an indication.   Then, when they had the
 attack on that army post, he went on television to denounce it, t  Uv\

 in uniform.   Then he fired the commander-in-chief of the army,
 who had given us a great deal of trouble at the conference of
 the American armies.  And I felt that all of these meant that
 what they said was a distinct possibility but it wasn't - and
 they used the word "inevitable."  So I disagreed with (it).
 And when I was talking to Peron, he said:   "I have
 never been a man to kill people, but now I must kill people.
 If I do not kill these terrorists, they will kill Argentina.   I
 will exterminate them to the last man, since I have no choice.
 If I don't, they will kill Argentina."  A month later he died,

 I must add that the great disappointment of this
 trip was that I did not get to see her.   I saw a very large car
 outside (of a special body) and I said, "Is that his?"  And they
 said, "No.      That's hers."  My own impression is that she'll be
 there for quite a while.      She bears the magic name, she is the
 Constitutional President, there are no acceptable alternatives.
 And in'a machismo country like Argentina the fact that she's a
 woman will convince all the power groups that she will be more
 easy to influence than any man would be in that job, and I think
 they're wrong -- she won't.
 Peron was a very remarkable man.   I was astounded
 at what apparent good health he was in when I saw him.   He talked

 for an hour and 45 minutes, he never got up and left the room,
 he never lost the thread of what he was saying, and he was very,
 =very lucid.  He was talking about the Cubans and he was wondering

 why we didn't be nicer to the Cubans.  And he said:  "P-eron [sic]
 is a barking dog.   Why don't you throw him a bone?" And I said,
 "Well, he's the kind of a dog that bites the hands that throw him
 bones."  He said, "No. You should try and separate him from the
 Russians."  I said, "What makes you think that's easy?"                                    He said:
 "Well, I recently saw the Cuban Ambassador to Argentina, and he's
 a great theoretician of the Cuban Communist Party and he (has)
 just come back from-the Soviet Union.   And I said to him,  'Did
 you see the Soviet leaders?'  He said yes.  And I, Peron, said
 to him, 'What did you think of them?"'  And again I hope the
 ladies will excuse me.   He answered in Spanish,  [In Spanish]  --

 Government was a little bit confused as to what to do with him.
 Nobody had invited him.   But he was the Prime Minister of Cuba,
 .so they decided that he'd see Vice President Nixon and Secretary
 of State Herter.  And they reached around for somebody speaking
 Spanish, and guess who it was, to excort him around for three
 days.   And he went in to see Mr. Nixon and he said, "Why am I
 criticized for shooting war criminals?"  Mr. Nixon said:   "You
 know, any time you arrest anybody at eleven, try him at twelve
 and shoot him at one in the national stadium in front of the
 televisions cameras, you're likely to be criticized.   [Laughter.]
 And Fidel said,"Yes,., but public opinion approves of it." And
 Mr. Nixon said, "Well, German public opinion approved what Hitler
 was doing until quite late, but that still didn't make it right."
 And there we lost Fidel.  To him the criterion was what public
 opinion approved, and this is what condition(s) his decisions
 rather than any abstract philosophy, even of Communism.
 And I must say, he appeared to me to be under
 tremendous stress all the time.  He twitched and moved constantly
 in his chair.  And when he came back from the television program
 he said, "I made a bad impression."  Well, he really had.   He had
 not done well at all.   Besides, maybe the best thing was not to
 say anything at all.

 One of the other people that was of some interest
 was Pompidou, whom I had some dealings with.  During the time
 that I was Military Attache in Paris, quite early, in '69, I
 was used by Dr. Kissinger as an intermediary with the North
 Vietnamese in the secret negotiations which ultimately led to
 what passes for a cease-fire.  But this was a very complicated
 thing.  He said to me, "Can we do this without the French
 knowing?"  And I said:   "No.   France is a sophisticated country.
 They watch the North Vietnamese, they watch us, they watch every-
 body.             You can't do it.   You've got to let them know."  "Well,"
 he said,  "how can I do this, because if it becomes public they'll
 break off."  I said:  "The answer is, you go to Mr. Pompidou and
 you ask Mr. Pompidou to keep it in the upper levels (of) the
 French intelligence community so that it doesn't seep down, and
 only a few people know it." So we did, and this was effectively
 done.

 who's a member of Hanoi's Politburo, and he wasn't there and
 1 ul
 instead the North Vietnamese Ambassador ,;;fie, Xuan      [sp?J,
 was there.     C Dr. Kissinger came in, he looked around the room
 and he said, "Where is Le Duc Tho?"  And he said, "He's not here."
 And Kissinger said: "I'm the Special Adviser to the President of
 the United States and a very busy man, and I've come 3500 miles
 to see you people and I expect some one of your Politburo here."
 Then Xuan 'tea. said, "I am the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plen-

 this story comes under the heading of "Don't underestimate the
 Local Service," and this is the fruit of two experiences of mine.
 When I went to Italy as Military Attache in 1960, I
 was briefed both in the Pentagon and at CIA, and everybody said:
 Well, the Italians have got a good little shop, but they don't
 have much money, you know, and it really isn't, you know, one of
 those tremendous things, and I mean they do what they can, but
 it's - all right.   Fine.
 So I arrived in Italy, and my first call was going
 to be on the Third Corps in Milan.   So I made arrangements with
 the Chief of Service, General De fie. Lorenzo [sp?], whom some of
 you may have known, who wore a monocle and looked morllike the
 chief of spies than anybody Hollywood or James Bond ever cast in
 the role.      And it was all set up, and I took off from Rome,
 driving my own car, and I spent the night at the U.S. base at
 Leghorn, and then --      That was before the autostrada was open.
 And the normal way to Milan would have been up the coast to Genoa
 and then up.
 But I suddenly, the next morning, remembered a great
 restaurant in Florence that had the ''best green lasagne I could
 remember.     Then I thought, (I may be) two hours late in Milan,
 but nothing scheduled.   So I turned off and I went up-to Florence.
 And usually, as an Attache when I drove, I kept my eye on the rear

 vision mirror to see whether I saw the same face behind the
 same or other wheels, or other wheels with different faces, and
 I, didn't see anything.  And I drove into Florence and I parked
 the car in the square in front of the station.
 Now, Florence is a city of 750,000 people.   It's a
 big city.   And I walked two or three blocks to this restaurant,
 and I went in and I ordered the green lasagne.  And while I
 was sitting there, a man walked up to me and said:   "(Senor
 `o~o~n211 n
 Ge  ello.), I am carabinieri warrant officer so-and-so, and
 there have been several changes in your program in Milan and
 the Chief of Service wanted to make sure you got them before
 you got to Milan."  So I understood that what I was getting was
 a demonstration that he could find me in a city of 750,000 people
 with no difficulty.
 And a couple of weeks later I saw him in Rome and I
 asked him whether he knew - in a different connection, whether
 he knew what the Bulgarians and the Poles and the Rumanians were
 doing, and he said, "Walters, do you remember the Othello [
 restaurant in Florence?"   I said yes.   He said, "Well, if we do
 that for our friends, try and imagine what we're doing for the
 STATINT
 others."   [Laughter.]

 in Rome, I complet(A my business on Friday evening, I ~ due in
 Paris Monday morning; I thought I'll hire a car, I'll drive to
 Florence, go look at my old World War II battlefields above
 Florence, take the night train from Florence, be in Paris Monday
 morning for my meeting.  So, accompanied by three people, I drove
 to Florence.  And we got checked in at the hotel and wit
 settled; then we went for a walk.  And it was about one o'clock
 and I found myself in front of the station, and this brought back
 memory of great green lasagne and I said let's go to Othello
 for lunch.   So we went to Othello'sfor lunch, and we hadit,The
 green lasagne was as,.good as ever but four times as expensive.
 And at the end I called the waiter and I said, "May
 Sc rJor
 I have the bill?"  And he said, "te1.[e  (I was in civilian
 clothes'.  He said, "(S     General),, there is no bill."   I said,
 "What do you mean there is no bill?,"  A young man ut the next table
 ...                                                                 M ev~~ct~el(,

 In order that you may know that in 12 years the Service has not
 lost it"s skill [Laughter] once again you are the guest of the Chief
 of Service."   [Laughter.  Applause.]
 The great lesson of that -- and it was confirmed by a
 story I told earlier at lunch -- at the age of eight I was arrested
 in France for riding a bicycle without a license plate.   Forty
 years later they reminded me of it.   So the only point I'm trying

 to make by those twoAis, don't underestimate the local service.
 [Laughter.]       I think if one does not, one is less apt to fall
 into either temptation or mistakes.
 A lot of this has been personal reminiscence about
 people.   But really one of the things that has impressed me is
 how relatively few people work out these things on the basis on
 which we work them out, and sometimes when we try to analyze
 what people are doing and we have hard material factor'A,B,C
 and D, sometimes that human factor, E, may be not an additive
 but a multiplies that affects the whole equation, and that is
 one of the harder ones to predict.   This is why I have always
 harped on the importance of biographical information, since it
 is really a tremendous adjunct to any other form, of intelligence
 if you know how the man is going to react.
 When I was an Attache, biographical information was
 one of my prime concerns.  As a matter of fact, when I came to
 CIA they put in front of me, as I went down to our Reference
 Section,, a biography of a Brazilian General written in 1960
 saying:   This man will probably become the President of the
 Republic.   And it was General Emilio Medici,  and it was written
 by me.      And I thought this was a pretty good selection, and I also
 thought it showed excellent judgment because I'd said this of at

 least four other people and they did not put that in front of
 me.   [Laughter.]
 But these human factors are of tremendous importance.
 There isn't any hard, definite point I'm trying to make, except
 that there is a mixture of things that go to make up the way that
 people behave and of which we should never lose sight and think
 that we can calculate these things with simply mathematical
 precision.    There is precision involved if you know enough about
 the man to know his reactions and how he may react under certain
 circumstances.   That will help you to arrive at a more exact
 final calculation as to what he is going to do.
 And finally, since I happen to be here and I happen
 to occupy the job I do now, I just cant to tell you how much
 everybody in the Central Intelligence Agency appreciates the
 incredible job you are doing for the United States and the
 incredible input you put into arriving at the decisions that
 govern our policies into which many of us Americans don't like
 to believe there's a human input, but my experience has been
 there's more than we sometimes like to accept.
 Now this has been a very confused, very disorderly,
 very unorganized presentation, very (nonconducive) to questions.
 But if you have any questions you'd like to ask me and if there
 is any time left --     I'm not sure where I am in relation to my

 time.   You can ask me about questions from anything from Watergate
 to the texture of the green lasagne.   [Laughter.]
 Pause]
 I guess they figure that I told them everything I
 knew.   [Laughter.]
 Yes?
 Q:           (I don't know if this will be of interest -- maybe
 it might).      Back in (1965) we had an Iranian - the oil problem,
 ..... suddenly became (Assistant Secretary or Deputy)  .....
 He wasn't a diplomat, but within six weeks he had the problem
 solved.   (Do you know how he did it?)
 DDCI:    Well, there had been a change in the government in
 Iran [Laughter] which was not unhelpful.
 But you know the old story of the difference between
 diplomats and ladies, I'm sure, that when a lady says no, she
 means maybe; when she says maybe, she means yes; and if she says
 yes, she's no lady.   [Laughter.]  And when the diplomat says yes,
 he means maybe; and when he says maybe, he means maybe; and when
 he says no, he's no diplomat.   [Laughter.]
 A number of factors contributed.   The Iranians had
 been trying to sell (this) oil, and, really, the cartel of the
 world oil companies was still working in those days and people
 just wouldn't pay them.   I had a little experience of this.

 Mossadegh went to the World Court at The Hague, and I was sent
 there to work on (it).  And I checked in at the Hotel (De Zaim),
 .which was a nice old hotel in The Hague, and I had no trouble
 getting a room.  And I said, "What room is Dr.  --"      It was,
 at that time, the hotel in The Hague.  And I said, "What room
 is Dr. Mossadegh in?"  They said, "Dr. Mossadegh is not in this
 hotel; there's no room for him."   I said:.  "There's.no room for
 him?  But I arrived a few minutes ago without any reservation;
 there was room for me."  He said to me, "(Mineer), this hotel
 belongs to the Royal Dutch (Shell Company)." [Laughter]  "There
 is no room for Dr. Mossadegh in this hotel."   [Laughter.]
 I think it was a combination of a change of govern-
 ment and the fact the Iranians could not sell the oil simply because

 according tothe importance of the man you're dealing with.
 Q:       [Inaudible.]
 DDCI:    Well, I think it's changing.   My Director, Mr. Colby,
 speaks Italian, French and Swedish.   So it isn't necessarily a
 hindrance in the organization (where) I work.  The new Deputy
 Director for the intelligence community, Sam Wilson, Major.Sam
 Wilson, soon to be Lt. General Sam Wilson, is a fluent linguist.
 One of the things that concerns me very much in our
 Organization, I'm sure must be a little bit of a. problem here,
 is the whole question of language.   Until now we've been able to
 rely on the children of the immigrants.   But the children of the
 immigrants are now retiring, and the grandchildren of the immi-
 grants don't speak the old language.                      And I see rather serious
 problems coming up on providing really good linguists -- because,
 you know, you're trying to, let me say for instance, listen to a
 conversation in which you are not participating; it's about twice
 as hard'and requires twice as much knowledge of the language as
 talking directly to someone where you see the facial expression
 and the gestures and so forth that accompany (them).  And this is
 going to be, I think --

 You'll probably have   ilittle) difficulty in getting
 people to learn Chinese and Russian, because they're big world
 languages.     But one of the problems I see down the line is getting
 people to learn languages that are spoken in relatively restricted
 areas.      First of all, in our particular business the people will
 say:          "Oh well, I'll always go to 'Cambodia, or anywhere else for
 that matter."  And I think this is going to be quite a serious
 problem.      And many people oppose proficiency pay for language,
 but I think we're going to have to come to it sooner or later if
 we're going to have the kind of qualified l-aigaa*es we need.   This
 may be totally contrary to the policy of this Organization --
 [Laughter]                              -- it may be totally contrary to the policy of CIA, but
 in my opinion that's where we're going to have to go eventually.
 Now don't all line up to see General Allen as you
 leave.   [Laughter.]   I can't commit him.
 w~f1~'                   K~Po~
 But I think there'* less and less of this4difficulty
 and more and more recognition of this.  I don't think language
 by itself is enough; you've got to have other things as well.
 It's like the old story of the man who went to Bismarck
 and insisted that Bismarck see his young son.  And Bismarck said:
 "Well, I'm a busy man.   I'm the Chancellor of Germany.  Why do I
 have to see your young son?"  And he said, "He's going to have a
 fantastic future."  Bismarck said, "What makes you so sure he's

 going to have a fantastic future?"  He said, "Well, he speaks
 seven languages." And Bismarck said:   "That's great.   He's
 going to make a wonderful concierge for some hotel or head
 waiter for some restaurant."   [Laughter.]
 So you've got to have more than that.  The language
 knowledge is not enough.   But on the other hand, I think people
 (don't sufficiently) understand that knowledge of (a) language
 is not enough.  You must understand what you're talking about.
 I was once asked to give a missile briefing for the
 United States, to translate it, and I said, "I can't do it."
 And they said, "Well, we thought you spoke French."  I said:   "I
 do, but I cannot translate what I don't understand.  If you want
 me to do this you have to send me to guided missile school."   STATINT

 I think one of the great temptations that we all have
 to guard against is, we get fascinated with some particular facet
 of intelligence; no one facet will give you the real story --
 you've got to have all of them, or as many as you can get.   The
 more you get, the better relief, the better color, the better tone,
 you get.   If you're operating on just one, you get one thing.   But
 if you can complete it with other indications --    And I mean, I
 know that you people probably furnish an overwhelming percentage
 of the total amount of input that there is, but it's rounded out
 and put into (a sense) of perspective and depth by the other things.
 None of them can do the job by itself.  And this building and the
 people in it are a monument ID the American people's belief in the
 importance of what you're doing here.
 Yes?
 Stop me if I'm running out of my time.
 Q:         [Inaudible.]
 DDCI:      He never talks down to'foreigners. I repeat, to
 foreigners.   [Laughter.  Applause.]  He always uses self-
 deprecation, but would be outraged if they believed it.   [Laughter.]
 And he is very, very smart and (add a fourth) very, very patient.
 He understand things.
 The other day I went to a WSAG at the White House on
 the environment.   (Dr.) Kissinger knew more about the paper under

 Approved For Release 2002/10/30 : CIA-RDP80R01731R002000090001-4
 discussion than the environmental specialists who were sitting
 there.   How he retains this, I don't know.   He obviously has
 superb retrieval of information, and the input has to be only
 slight but it's engraved.
 I would say that he never talks down to foreigners,
 he deprecates himself constantly with foreigners -- none of them
 have shown any signs of believing him, fortunately (for) the
 negotiations -- and he's very smart and very patient.  Those talks
 in Paris went on for three years.   The talks with the Chinese went
 on for two.
 But the human element.   When I first contacted the
 Chinese in Paris, nobody - we had to talk (as Americans and)
 Chinese for years.   They asked me questions like this: what does
 the State Governor do?  can he belong to a party different from
 the President?  So I finally gave them the World Almanac, and I'm
 sure they got 500 intelligence reports out of it.   [Laughter.]
 Now, you know, maybe that was available somewhere in Peking, but
 it wasn't available in the embassy in Paris.   And Dr. Kissinger
 was
 To give you an idea why I think he doesn't like them
 to take this deprecation seriously.   When I would go there, the
 Chinese    I would be met at the outer gate by a junior official;
 he would walk me across the yard, the garden, to the main gate,

 where I would - the door of the building, where I would be met
 by a higher ranking person.  I would then be led into what I
 called the Fu Manchu Room, because it was hung with red velvet
 and it looked exactly like the scenario of a Fu Manchu meeting,
 and I would sit there and at 90 seconds exactly the Ambassador
 would appear in the door with a (ne how).  And when I took
 Dr. Kissinger there the first time, the scenario was somewhat
 different.   The two lower ranking people met us at the outside
 door of the garden, and when we got to the entrance to the
 building the Ambassador was waiting there.  And after we left
 this place, Henry said to me, "When they receive you, is it
 exactly the same?"  And I said no, and I described what happened.
 And I said, "And besides, I never get either music or incense."
 [Laughter.]  And I could see the smile of relief.that at least
 the Chinese had some respect for hierarchy even in the (Yalutarian)
 society.   [Laughter.]
