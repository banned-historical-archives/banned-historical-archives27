 Vladivostok  (the name means "ruler of the east")  is the
 largest and most important port city in the Soviet Far East.
 It is located on Golden Horn Bay at the southern tip of the
 hilly, wooded Murav'yev-Amurskiy Peninsula which extends into
 the Sea of Japan.   Direct access to the Pacific Ocean is
 denied by Sakhalin and the Japanese Islands.
 The city is only 70 nautical miles northeast of the USSR --
 China -- North Korean border junction.   For this reason, as
 well as its strategic role, the city has been closed to non-
 communist foreign visitors for a number of years.   Vladivostok
 is the headquarters of the Soviet Pacific Fleet,  and subordinate
 headquarters and naval facilities are located here and
 in adjacent bay areas.   The city is also a major commercial port.
 Vladivostok's location on a sheltered bay,  its terraced
 residential sectors,  and its general orientation to the sea
 have moved some to call it the "San Francisco" of the Soviet
 Far East.   Uniforms and sailors'  garb are a common street
 sight.
 A 1959 Moscow directive launched a major physical transfor-
 mation of Vladivostok that is still going on.   Former open areas
 are filling up and apartment blocks are replacing sections
 formerly occupied by old single-family cottages.   Construction
 also includes highways,  cultural and educational facilities,
 hotels, and light industries.    A major development is the
 establishment of the Far Eastern Scientific Center in the
 northern coastal suburbs about 15 kilometers from the town
 center. It includes the headquarters of the Far East Branch
 of the Siberian section of the USSR Academy of Sciences.   Other
 institutes now housed in the city, such as that for oceano-
 graphic research, will be moved to the Science Center as
 facilities become available.

 Shipbuilding and repair are major industries.   Enterprises
 servicing the navy and commercial and fishing fleets also are
 significant employers.   Other industries, such as metal working
 enterprises, support local requirements for precast construction
 materials plants and consumer goods enterprises.
 Founded in 1860 as a military outpost, Vladivostok rapidly
 developed into a significant commercial port as well, and in
 1935 became the capital of Primorskiy Kray.   The city has a
 population of half a million, mostly Great Russians.
 In 1880 the arrival of a steamship from Odessa inaugurated
 scheduled service between Vladivostok and the Black Sea.   Pas-
 senger and freight service has since expanded to Pacific and
 Arctic coastal cities.   Construction of the eastern end of
 the Trans-Siberian railroad began in 1891, but an all-Russian
 route was not completed until 1914.  Vladivostok was the
 only port open for shipping allied material to European
 Russia during World War I, and in World War II it again played
 a major transshipment role for war material and foodstuffs
 destined for Soviet military forces.   .
 Associations With the US
 Vladivostok was occupied by allied forces during the
 "intervention period" of the Bolshevik Revolution,  1918-1922.
 The United States landed about 7,000 troops in August 1918;
 these were withdrawn by April 1920.   Their role was primarily
 to protect and maintain lines of communication -- the Trans-
 Siberian railroad.   The Japanese intervention was more serious;
 Japanese troops were in the city from April 1918 until late
 1922 and used it as the base for penetrations deep into Siberia.
 Under the Lend-Lease master agreement, more than 940
 Soviet and Soviet-leased ships cleared American west coast
 ports for Vladivostok.   Between July 1943 and September 1945,
 about 7 million tons of critical military items, industrial
 goods, and foodstuffs were funnelled through the harbor, some
 destined for Soviet troops in Manchuria fighting the Japanese.

 The "Cold War" period left its imprint.  A monument in
 Zharikovsk Garden on Lenin Street marks the common grave of
 15 passengers and 6 crewmen of a Soviet aircraft allegedly
 shot down on 27 July 1953 by US aircraft.
 Weather
 Relatively pleasant, although cold, weather is highly
 probable during late November.  Clear skies and light northerly
 winds generally prevail.   Topcoast temperatures are characteristic,
 with daytime highs about 40? F and nightime lows about 25? F.
 Landfast ice formation is probable in protected bays.   Gale
 force winds are the exception at this time of year, and any pre-
 cipitation is likely to be a brief rain shower.                            Visibility is      25X1
 generally good as fogs are rare and industrial smoke is light.

 Large-scale investment in Siberia is a major element
 in the Soviet 15-year plan (1975-1990) now on the drawing
 board.   Much of Soviet hopes for future economic growth
 rest on the exploitation of Siberia's abundant resources,
 and Brezhnev takes a particular interest in the program.
 The Siberian projects also have major foreign trade impli-
 cations,  in terms of meeting Soviet export commitments
 to Eastern Europe and generating output that can be sold
 to hard-currency countries.
 Siberian projects already approved--a few with work
 actually under way--involve about $3.5 billion in foreign
 investment, almost all Japanese or West'German.   Moscow is
 also actively seeking foreign investment over the next five
 to ten years in projects still under discussion whose value
 could exceed $10 billion.   The US share might be two-thirds.
 This is a level of capital and high-quality capital goods
 for which Moscow actively seeks foreign assistance.   Foreign
 investment on this scale represents a significant policy
 departure from traditional Soviet autarky.    Additional
 challenges, for which foreign technology is important, are
 posed by the location of many of the richest Siberian de-
 posits in remote areas and severe climate.   (Other,  sizeable,
 non-Siberian foreign investment projects are also under
 negotiation, of course.)
 A.    Energy Projects
 1.   Yakutsk Natural Gas
 In 1973 the USSR signed a general agreement with
 US and Japanese firms to develop natural gas deposits in
 the Yakutsk region in eastern Siberia.   El Paso Natural
 Gas and Tokyo Gas have agreed on joint participation in
 the exploratory phase.
 Approved For Release'YUO 1Ji79'MA=RDP80B01495R000600040006-9
 Approved For IeeejsO*SlMT11P80B0149500600040006-9
 The project entails the construction of a 1,200-
 mile pipeline from Vilyuysk to Nakhodka on the Pacific
 Coast, where facilities to liquefy and export the gas
 would be built.   Japan and the United States would each
 receive 1 billion cubic feet per day (cf/d) of liquefied
 natural gas  (LNG)--less than 2% of US consumption--over
 a 20-year period beginning about 1985.  Roughly $3 billion
 in Western plant and equipment would be supplied by the
 US and-Japan and financed by long-term credits.
 It is not clear that Yakutsk's reserves are
 sufficient to justify such a large investment; three to
 five years of exploration will be needed to verify the
 reserves claimed by the USSR.   The Soviets are asking
 for $200 million in US and Japanese credits to support
 this exploration.   The Japanese have agreed to finance
 half this amount, contingent on the availability of a
 matching amount from the US Eximbank.
 2.   North Star LNG Project
 A consortium of three US companies--Tenneco,
 Texas Eastern, and Brown and Root--is considering a
 cooperative venture with the USSR to import 2 billion
 cf/d of LNG over a 25-year period for US east coast markets.
 The gas would come from the large Urengoy deposit in Western
 Siberia via a pipeline to an export terminal near Murmansk.
 Difficulties over the pricing of the gas and the availability
 of Western financing have hindered the negotiations.   The
 project depends on Eximbank credits and guarantees to cover
 Soviet purchases of up to $2.5 billion in Western equipment.
 Even if an agreement is reached soon, deliveries would not
 begin until the early 1980s.
 3.   Natural Gas to Western Europe
 In recent years the USSR has contracted to deliver
 natural gas to Western Europe.  By 1980 the volume will
 reach 2 billion cf/d.  Although the gas is now being piped

 Approved For Rei'ea"(ItAr-IfE80B014900600040006-9
 from Central Asian and Ukrainian gas fields, future deliveries
 may come from the Urengoy fields---the intended source of the
 North Star deliveries.  An existing pipeline system probably
 will be extended eastward to Urengoy as additional gas de-
 posits are developed and, in the west, tied into the gas
 pipeline network now connecting Eastern and Western Europe.
 Western Europe has supplied much of the line pipe
 and related equipment for this and other natural gas pipe-
 lines, with repayments to come in future gas deliveries. To
 date the USSR, has contracted for $2 billion in pipe and pipe-
 line equipment from the West.   By 1980, annual Soviet earnings
 from natural gas sold in Western Europe should exceed $8 billion.
 4.   Sakhalin Offshore Exploration
 The Soviets are nearing final agreement with a Gulf
 Oil-Japanese consortium to explore offshore oil and natural
 gas deposts on the Sakhalin continental shelf.  Because the
 other parties regard Gulf's expertise as crucial to the pro-
 ject, progress has been stalled by Gulf's refusal to join in
 what it regarded as an unprofitable operation.  Gulf sub-
 sequently decided to participate in return for Soviet assurances
 that the company would be given sole rights to explore other
 offshore areas surrounding Sakhalin under a more lucrative
 arrangement.   Total offshore reserves on the Sakhalin conti-
 nental shelf could equal those claimed for Alaska's Prudhoe
 Bay.   Western investment required to explore and develop
 one or two major offshore fields might well exceed $1 billion.
 5.   Tyumen Oil Project
 For several years the USSR and Japan have been dis-
 cussing construction of a 4,200 mile pipeline from the Tyumen
 oil fields in West Siberia to Nakhodka.   In return for fi-
 nancing $1 billion in Soviet imports of large diameter pipe
 and pipeline equipment, Japan was to receive up to 800,000
 barrels per day (b/d) of oil over a 20-year period.   In April
 1974, however, the Soviets told the Japanese that they had

 Approved For F ieaget?p80B01495'Rtf00600040006-9
 scrapped plans to build a pipeline in favor of a second
 trans-Siberian rail line, that they could only supply the
 Japanese a maximum of 500,000 b/d, and that they wanted $3
 billion in long-term credits for equipment to be used in
 building the railroad.  The Japanese refused because of
 economic reasons (smaller deliveries, larger investment,
 and a longer construction period)  and fears that China
 would oppose Japanese participation in building a strategic
 railroad in the Far East.   Some Japanese officials profess
 to believe, on the basis of very recent developments, that
 Moscow may tender a revised proposal.   Rail transport of
 oil out of Tyumen is so unrealistically expensive, however,
 that it seems clear the Soviets want the railroad far more
 than the oil.
 6.   Chul'man Coal Deposits
 Last June the USSR signed an agreement with a
 Japanese consortium to develop coking coal deposits near
 Chul'man.  Japan's Eximbank will put up $450 million in
 long-term credits to finance Soviet purchases of coal
 mining equipment, railway equipment, and consumer goods.  In
 return, the USSR will supply the Japanese with 104 million
 tons of coal during 1979-99, about 5% of projected Japanese
 needs.   If coal prices stay up,  Soviet earnings from the
 project could exceed the cost of foreign credits by several
 billion dollars.   US firms may be asked to supply some of
 the advanced equipment.
 1.        Baykal-Amur Railroad
 Moscow has decided to build a second trans-
 Siberian railroad running 100 to 500 miles north of the
 existing line.   Some segments at the eastern and western ends
 of the planned Baykal-Amur Magistral (BAM) already have gone
 into operation.   The BAM, running through difficult terrain,
 will provide access to important Siberian mineral deposits--
 Approved For Release' 005X&R-' % l
 Approved For R1ase       fI'll)r,"A810B01495F0600040006-9
 including coal, copper, iron ore, and gold--and open up
 new lands for development.          It will be less vulnerable than
 the existing trans-Siberian line, which at some locations
 is within ten miles of the Chinese border.   To help in
 building the new line, the USSR last month ordered $400
 million in trucks from West Germany and $100 million in
 crawler tractors from International Harvester.   The latter
 order was  the largest in that company's history.
 2.   Port Development Protect
 In late 1970 the USSR signed an agreement with a
 consortium of Japanese firms to jointly develop port
 facilities at Vostochnyy, on Vrangel Bay 65 miles east of
 Vladivostok.   The Japanese are providing $80 million in
 engineering services and equipment.   Soviet purchases are
 being financed by long-term Japanese Eximbank credits.
 When completed--possibly by 1975--the port will be the
 largest in the Soviet Far East.   The coal and wood chip
 handling facilities under construction at the port should
 be fully employed in handling exports resulting from
 Soviet-Japanese resource projects.  A large modern container
 facility also has been built to support the recently in-
 augurated Siberian "land-bridge" for Japanese-European
 container traffic.
 1.   Aluminum Processing Facilities
 Because Siberia's energy resources are plentiful,
 the USSR wants to locate energy-intensive industries there--
 and to attract foreign cooperation.

 2.   Other Metals
 The USSR has negotiated for nearly a decade
 with Western firms over the development of the rich Udokan
 copper deposits east of Lake Baykal.  Western investment
 has been deterred in part by the lack of railroads and
 other supporting facilities, but construction of the new
 Trans-Siberian railroad should spur renewed interest in
 Udokan copper.   Soviet officials have announced that other
 mineral deposits being readied for development include
 copper and nickel deposits at Nizhneangarsk and polymetalic
 deposits elsewhere.  The new railroad will also provide
 access to large iron ore deposits in East Siberia.
 D.    Forestry Projects
 1.   Timber Projects
 The first Siberian project involving foreign
 participation, begun in 1968, exploited timber resources
 along the Amur River in the Soviet Far East.   It was
 successfully completed, and last July the USSR concluded
 a much larger contract with the same Japanese companies.

 Approved For RpWasqCRI9]EPMOB014959P00600040006-9
 The USSR in 1975-78 will import, on Japanese Eximbank
 credits,  $550 million in timber cutting and processing
 equipment,  ships, and consumer goods.   Soviet earnings
 from saw logs and other timber products could be double
 the value of the Japanese credits.   The two countries are
 also cooperating in the building of a wood-chip plant
 in the Soviet Far East, but progress has been slow.
 2.   Pulp/Paper Plants
 The USSR is building a major wood processing
 center at Ust'  Ilimsk on the Angara River.  The center will
 process wood pulp and lumber, and factories to produce chip
 boards will also be built.   It is a Bloc-wide project;
 Romania, Poland, and East Germany are providing large amounts
 of equipment in return for long-term deliveries of wood pulp.
 The Soviets and Japanese are negotiating over the
 construction of another pulp/paper plant on the Yenisey
 River, west of Lake Baykal.   Although US and West German
 firms have shown an interest, Japanese officials say they
 prefer a bilateral arrangement.   The Japanese seem to be more
 interested in very recent Soviet proposals for two other
 plants on the Amur River in the Soviet Far East, which would
 require $1 billion in Japanese investment.

 China is Brezhnev's most intractable problem, and will
 be very much on his mind during the Vladivostok Summit, even
 though he may not speak of China directly.  The Sino-Soviet
 dispute today colors the thinking of the Soviet leaders on
 virtually all foreign policy issues, not the least that of
 relations with the United States.
 What the Quarrel is About
 For two decades the Soviets have seen their quarrel with
 China steadily expand, despite periodic efforts to find ground
 for reconciliation.
 --Originally, this was mainly a dispute over
 which of the two Communist great powers
 should dominate the Communist world.
 --This became transformed into a struggle
 over whether the policies of what was
 then the Sino-Soviet alliance should be
 shaped to serve Chinese or Soviet
 national interests.
 --As grievances accumulated, the rivalry
 became charged more and more with personal,
 racial, and national animosity,  leading
 to a gradual precautionary buildup of
 strong Soviet forces along the border, and
 then to military clashes.
 --At the same time, the political rivalry
 between the two powers has gradually
 broadened into competition for influence
 in every world arena.

 Today, wherever the Soviets turn--in dealing with Japan,
 the US, Western Europe, or the Third World, in the UN or the
 Indian Ocean--they find the Chinese leadership attempting to
 obstruct Soviet policy.   In practice, China is not strong
 enough to organize serious opposition to Soviet policy in
 areas outside Asia.   The Soviets realize this, but neverthe-
 less emphasize that the present Chinese regime is their most
 fanatical, single-minded adversary.  The decisive fact for
 Soviet policymakers is that, while Washington under several
 Presidents has shown willingness to improve relations with
 Moscow, Peking under Mao Tse-tung has adamantly refused to
 do so.
 The Core Problem:   The Border
 The most sensitive issue of the protracted Sino-Soviet
 impasse is their 4,000-mile border.
 --Only about 250 miles north of the Vladivostok
 summit meeting place is the island of Damansky
 (Chen Pao)  in the Ussuri river,   the eastern
 frontier between Chinese Manchuria and the
 Soviet Far East.
 --In March 1969, this island was the scene of
 two bloody firefights between Chinese and
 Soviet border guards, launching six months
 of similar incidents elsewhere along the
 frontier and mounting tension in both countries.
 --Alarmed over their inability to read Chinese
 intentions, and worried that Peking might try
 to convert the border into a continual "running
 sore," the Soviets that summer floated threats
 of drastic punitive military action.   This
 evidently impressed the Chinese, and they ceased
 aggressive border patrolling and opened border
 negotiations with Moscow in the fall of 1969.
 --But in five years of intermittent talks since
 then, the Soviets have met only frustration
 and stalemate.

 Approved For Release 82W&Yff: CIA-RDP80BO1495WO600040006-9
 The heart of the Soviet negotiating dilemma has been
 Peking's insistence that thousands of square kilometers long
 held by Moscow are "in dispute," and Chinas unwavering de-
 mand that the USSR pull its forces out of all this territory
 before a final border settlement can be reached.
 --The Soviets have no intention of making such
 a pullback.
 --They may be willing to make some limited
 concessions as part of a general settlement,
 but there are some Chinese claims to which
 Moscow will never yield.
 --Chimnaya Island (Hei-hsia-tzu), at the
 junction of the Amur and Ussuri, is the
 most essential to Soviet national interests.
 The large city and military center of
 Khabarovsk lies just across the river, and
 the vital Trans-Siberian railroad runs
 through Khabarovsk.
 Soviet Conclusions
 The Soviets are convinced that Mao knows all this,
 but that he maintains Chinese demands unaltered in order
 to preserve the impasse--and ensure continued Sino-Soviet
 hostility.     The Chinese expelled certain Soviet diplomats
 in Peking last January, and refused to release the crew
 of a military helicopter which strayed across the border
 in March.
 The Chinese recently published for the first time the
 unaltered demand they have been insisting upon privately in
 five years of border talks--a mutual non-aggression pledge
 linked to the total Soviet troop pullback Peking has wanted.
 The Soviets will regard this as a ploy intended to create
 an impression of Chinese reasonableness.  The Soviets ex-
 pect no real improvement while Mao lives.
 The US-Soviet-Chinese Triangle
 This Chinese conundrum has been a constant worry for
 the Soviet leaders in their calculations about dealing
 with the United States.

 curing a breakthrough in their own relations with Peking.

 consent to a major improvement in economic relations, and
 have repeatedly attempted to obtain a Sino-Soviet summit
 meeting.     The Chinese under Mao have rejected all these
 Soviet requests, but after Mao's death Moscow is likely to
 offer such a package again to his heirs.
 Above all, the Soviets hope that a post-Mao leader-
 ship will be willing to moderate Chinese terms for a border
 settlement.   Although Brezhnev recently told an East European
 leader that he felt confident that Mao's successors would
 show an improved attitude toward the USSR, a recently acquired
 Soviet document indicates that Moscow simply does not know
 whether Mao's passing will actually move China in this direction.
 In the meantime,  for tactical purposes Moscow has instructed
 all Soviets abroad to create the impression, in talks with
 Western representatives, that the USSR expects such a post-
 Mao improvement.

 Soviet interest in the Korean peninsula stems from:

 and the Soviet Union;
 --and historical circumstances that have
 made North Korea an arena for Soviet-
 Chinese rivalry.
 Moscow's efforts to strengthen its influence in North Korea
 at China's expense have not been particularly successful,
 however, because:

 anxious that the Korean question in the UN
 not seriously complicate their relationship

 THE SOVIET PROPOSAL FOR ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY
 During the course of the summit, Brezhnev may conceivably
 raise his proposal to create an Asian collective security
 system.
 The Soviets have touted this idea for five years, but
 have remained purposely vague about exactly what it means.
 Among the "principles" they have cited for inclusion are
 non-use of force, non-interference in the internal affairs of
 other states, and the inviolability of frontiers.   Their aims
 in pushing this scheme are:
 --to embarrass and contain China;
 --to sanction a Soviet role in the settlement
 of Asian disputes;
 --to promote the atmosphere of detente.
 The Asian states are aware of these objectives and
 chary of lending themselves to Soviet purposes.   A number
 of them with unresolved border problems also find difficulty
 with the principle of "inviolability of frontiers."   This is
 particularly unacceptable to China and Japan, which have
 territorial disputes with the USSR.
 The Soviets have no illusions that their collective
 security idea will become a reality soon.   So far they have
 picked up only a few endorsements,  from Mongolia,  Iran and
 Afghanistan.   But they find it useful to keep this proposal
 alive as a symbol of their benign intentions and a reminder
 that they are a   force to be reckoned with in Asia.

 The Soviet military establishment is quite a different
 animal from its US counterpart, and it fits into the larger
 society in a different way as well.
 In the first place, Soviet society is much more free
 of conflicts between military and civilian viewpoints
 than is American society.   Given Russia's long history of
 invasions and enormous civilian suffering, the population
 accepts with little question the need for a strong defense.
 The notion of an external threat is persuasive,with the
 Chinese filling any vacuum left by the warming of relations
 with the West.   Patriotism remains a widely honored value
 in this society, which accepts without demur such practices
 as substantial pre-military training in high school and
 the draft.
 In the second place, the Soviet military is in
 important respects a much more self-contained institution
 than other armed forces.   Short of issues important
 enough to engage the Politburo, civilians do not share in
 the running of the defense establishment.   In-the Soviet
 equivalent of the Pentagon, practically everyone is a uni-
 formed member of the armed forces.   This creates a formidable
 continuity, with all its virtues and vices.   One of these
 vices--resistance to change--provoked Khrushchev into re-
 peated forays into the field of doctrine and weapons se-
 lection.   The results were mixed, and the Brezhnev regime
 has not repeated the effort.   There is some reason to believe
 that, when the Minister of Defense died in 1967, the
 Politburo did initially consider breaking precedent by
 appointing a civilian successor, but finally decided to
 avoid bad feeling in the high command.  At any rate, the
 job went to Marshal Grechko, who in the American system
 would have become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs but,  in the
 Soviet system,  is Secretary Schlesinger's opposite number.

 The Military and the Politicians
 This strong acceptance of the principle of professionalism,
 compounded by the Soviet practice-of long tours in key posi-
 tions, creates a real danger that the military will become
 a separate and even dominant force in the political arena.
 The Communist party is acutely aware of this and has devised
 pervasive control mechanisms.   The three most prominent ones
 are:
 --a separate network of political officers who,
 while members of the armed forces, are re-
 sponsible for insuring loyalty and morale
 throughout the forces; they have their own
 chain of command leading into the Central
 Committee of the Party.
 --a directorate of the KGB devoted to the same
 tasks.
 --the requirement that any officer who wishes
 to advance must join  and be active in the
 party; practically all officers do join.
 While these systems work effectively, the conspiratorial
 traditions of Soviet politics are so strong that the Party
 has remained highly nervous about Bonapartist tendencies
 in the military.  As a case in point, Khrushchev in 1957
 used Marshal Zhukov to defeat his political rivals, bringing
 him into the Politburo as part of the deal, but four months
 later Zhukov was fired.
 It is important to note that these control mechanisms
 are designed to insure political loyalty, not to join in
 or second-guess military judgments on professional matters.
 Of course,  the Ministry of Defense does not have a free
 hand in setting its own budget or determining its own force
 structure.   But, in contrast to the American military estab-
 lishment, it has a virtual monopoly on the development of a

 strategic doctrine and on military data and on the expertise
 needed to analyze it.            It does not have to contend with a
 Congress, or with competing bureaucracies--such as State,
 ACDA, and CIA--or analytic centers--such as RAND--or private
 strategic analysts, all of them demanding that the profes-
 sional military prove its case, offering rival analyses,
 criticizing official doctrine, and in general assuring an
 unending debate over national defense policy.   Such inde-
 pendent bodies do not exist in the USSR, with sufficient
 power or facts to work effectively.
 To be sure, this somewhat overstates the case.   The
 Politburo itself pays a good deal of attention to military
 matters, and Brezhnev and other political leaders saw a
 good deal of combat, albeit as political officers, in the
 Second World War.   The industrial administrators who oversee
 defense production have acquired strategic expertise in the
 course of their work.  Both these elites are represented at
 the Defense Council, which is a sort of Politburo sub-
 committee charged with integrating Soviet policy in. the
 fields of defense, economics, foreign policy, and more
 recently arms control.  But in comparison to the US mili-
 tary, the Soviet military has almost no institutional
 competition in presenting to the political leadership its
 version of the Soviet-US strategic balance.  As to overall
 policy, it can only recommend, but its recommendations
 carry a weight of professionalism which others cannot match.
 In these circumstances, it is natural to expect that
 the military analysis which Brezhnev and his colleagues
 receive stresses worst-case possibilities, emphasizes US
 strengths, and serves to support military desires for con-
 tinued high levels of funding.   The military briefing on
 the strategic balance which the Soviets presented to former
 President Nixon last July bore this stamp.  Perhaps Brezhnev
 is not entirely happy with this heavy dependence upon mili-
 tary analysis, but there is no evidence that he has estab-
 lished any alternative unit and provided it with the necessary
 highly classified data.

 Indeed, there is Litt e

 interests.        Back in 1964, when Brezhnev and his colleagues

 conservatism, and forcinq unwanted innovations down
 their throats.   The military nudget has grown, slowly
 but without interruption, and all services have shared
 about equally in the benefits.   The detente line pursued
 since about 1969 has not hurt the military, --it has
 been accompanied,  for instance, by major new weapons
 programs.   The military, which participates fully in
 SALT policymaking, professes itself satisfied with the
 1972 arms accords.   The military shares, for its own
 particular reasons,  the Soviet interest in stimulating
 a greater flow of advanced technology into the USSR from
 the West.   But it seems certain that on security matters--
 and particularly the negotiations for a SALT II accord--
 the military influence is both strong and on the con-
 servative side.
 The Soviet Military-Industrial Complex
 Soviet military budgeteers have much different
 problems, and generally easier ones, than their American
 counterparts.   There is no equivalent of the Congressional
 scrutiny to which the US Department of Defense must submit.
 There is, of course, the equivalent of executive scrutiny,
 at a general level in the Defense Council and in a more
 detailed fashion in the Military-Industrial Commission
 and in Gosplan.   This commission brings together the
 heads of several ministries responsible for defense
 production and the planners of the Defense Ministry.   It
 is chaired by L. V. Smirnov, who conducted the final nego-
 tiations on the SALT I accords at the 1972 summit.
 These men are not indifferent to questions of cost
 and efficiency.   They know that their betters in the
 Politburo are genuinely concerned to devote more re-
 sources to raising Soviet living standards.   But they also
 know that the Politburo regards armed forces as much more
 than just an unwelcome necessity--that it attaches a high
 political value to a strong military posture.   And the
 budgetary cost of total manpower is low--it takes only

 31 percent of Soviet defense spending.  The result is
 a stable bureaucratic environment in which defense spend-
 ing grows steadily, at a somewhat slower pace than the
 economy as a whole, but free of the swings which
 characterize the military budgets of democratic countries.
 Soviet weapons designers are a breed apart.   In
 the leaders' eyes, the heads of the major design teams
 are the repository of Soviet hopes for overcoming the
 US lead under which the USSR has so long labored.  These
 chief designers are given a great deal of latitude and
 have enjoyed personal access to the leaders, first to
 Khruschev and then probably to Brezhnev.  Frequently they
 are allowed to purse competing programs, and in some
 cases the military will buy and deploy the product of
 both contestants--thus reinforcing other tendencies in
 favor of quantity in Soviet military policy.  Their bureaus
 are permanent government units, not private companies which
 can lose funds, personnel and expertise when contracts
 are completed.   These establishments obviously have strong
 NrPsted interes+-G in developing new weapons technology.
 The Ministry of Defense is set up in a different way
 from the US Department of Defense.  The dominant element
 is the General Staff.  Many of its officers are graduates
 of the General Staff's own Academy.  The Soviet tradition
 resembles the old German General Staff, i.e., a unified organ
 rather than a joint representation of the several services.
 Its officers spend long years in specialized positions, in
 contrast to the US system of periodic rotation between
 line and staff responsibilities.  Among Soviet military
 institutions, the General Staff alone has the access to
 both information on Soviet forces and foreign intelligence.
 It is the source of military staff work on arms control.

 Instead of four combat services, the Soviet military
 establishment has five.   The Soviet Navy contains a small
 element which is a counterpart to the US Marines.   The
 Ground Forces' responsibilities are comparable to those
 of the US Army, except that it has no air defense or
 missile defense role.   These are handled by the National
 Air Defense Force, which also controls interceptor air-
 craft.   The Soviet Air Force provides tactical air and
 transport support to the Ground Forces and a bomber force,
 but has no strategic missiles.   These are controlled by
 the Strategic Rocket Forces--except for SLBMs which, as
 in the US, are the Navy's.
 There is considerable evidence of the normal kinds
 of interservice conflict and rivalry within the Soviet
 military.   The Ground Forces have traditionally enjoyed
 preeminence, and although they are now yielding to the
 Strategic Rocket Forces, they continue to provide the
 greatest share of the top military leadership.  Whereas
 Khrushchev exploited interservice competition to press
 his own military policies, the Brezhnev regime has tended
 to provide satisfaction to all important claimants under
 the rubric of "balanced forces."

 The Soviet economy has grown since
 1950
 from about
 one-third to about one-half the size of
 the
 US economy.
 The USSR's basic strategy has been:
 --to invest at high rates in heavy industry,
 fuels and power, and construction; at lower
 rates in consumer goods and agriculture;
 --to emphasize modern, capital-intensive
 technology in the favored sectors while
 using old-fashioned, labor-intensive
 methods in the low priority sectors;
 --to spend heavily on education and science
 in order to raise the technical skills of
 the population;
 --to import advanced Western technology and
 equipment in exchange for raw materials.
 Making and Implementing Economic Policy
 This is a "command economy."  Basic economic decisions
 are made by central administrative fiat rather than in the
 market place:
 --The Politburo of the Communist Party makes
 the big economic decisions.   In practice,
 because the system is so centralized,  it
 ends up making a lot of little ones too.
 --Given these guidelines, a huge bureaucracy--
 headed by the Council of Ministers--sets output
 goals, allocates manpower and materials, fixes
 wages and prices, and regulates incentives.

 --Lower down,  state-owned industrial facilities
 and collective farms struggle to translate
 the economic plans into action.
 The Politburo--the highest Soviet policy-making body--
 acts much like the board of directors of an enormous con-
 glomerate.                                As chairman of the board, Brezhnev presides
 over Politburo weekly meetings where periodic decisions on
 general economic priorities are reached by consensus.  The
 Politburo decides--basically annually--on the division of
 resources between military and civilian use and the distri-
 bution of investment between industry and agriculture.
 The Council of Ministers--the government's highest
 body--can be likened to a senior management team of the
 conglomerate.   Kosygin, as Chairman of the Council, has
 final responsibility for setting the output of all major
 commodities, distributing resources, and ensuring that plans
 are fulfilled.    The organization under the Council includes
 the State Planning Commission (Gosplan), more than 50
 functional economic ministries  (such as ferrous metallurgy,
 foreign trade, and agriculture), and a host of state
 committees and main administrations concerned with finance,
 prices,  supply, and the like.  The State Planning Commission
 is now working on an annual plan for 1975, the Tenth Five-
 Year Plan for 1976-80, and a new 15-year plan for 1976-90.
 Each ministry oversees production by the plants and
 laboratories under its control.  Most ministers and their
 deputies are senior executives, not policymakers.  A
 minister's main job is to see that plans are fulfilled.   He
 also deals with production and staffing, allocates funds
 for investment and R&D, and decides matters that would come
 before the department head of a giant Western corporation.
 Each plant and laboratory has its own production,
 technical,  and financial plans.   The manager's main "success
 indicator" is whether or not he meets the production target.

 a wealth of natural resources, a sturdy labor force half
 again as large as that of the United States, rapidly growing
 industrial facilities, and a tough, hard-driving leadership.
 Growth has been maintained by the brute force method of
 allocating 30 percent of output to investment  (compared with
 18 percent in the United States)  and by extracting as large
 a work force as possible out of the populace.   The result
 has been a rapid increase in the output of machinery and
 materials, the maintenance of a formidable defense estab-
 lishment, and even some gains in the long-neglected con-
 sumer sector.
 These strengths of the Soviet "command economy" have
 made it largely immune to some major problems now plaguing
 the market economies of the West--double-digit inflation,
 international monetary crises, and the energy crunch.
 --Because of tight central control, prices and
 wages are stable.   Retail prices, with the
 exception of a few luxury items, have not
 risen since 1950.   Wages have risen gradually
 as increased output permits gains in living
 standards.
 --The Soviet drive for self-sufficiency has
 largely insulated the economy from disruptions
 in world trade and finance.   Imports are equal
 to 3 percent of GNP, and only one-third of
 foreign trade is conducted with non-communist
 countries.  Moreover, recent world trade prob-
 lems have worked to the advantage of the Soviet
 Union.   The rapid rise in world prices for
 major Soviet raw material exports and gold will
 turn the USSR's hard currency balance from
 deficit to a healthy surplus in 1974 and 1975.
 --The USSR's vast reserves of mineral fuels are
 adequate to meet current needs and to support
 economic growth for many years.

 Weaknesses
 The Soviet leadership is aware of persistent problem
 areas threatening economic growth.
 --Low productivity and the declining efficiency
 of investment.  Despite a volume of investment
 per worker nearly equal to US levels in recent
 years, labor productivity in Soviet industry
 is only about half the US level.   This is
 particularly serious since additions of men
 and equipment on the scale of the 1950s are
 no longer possible, and productivity gains
 must be the future source of growth.  An added
 difficulty is the gradual exhaustion of easily
 accessible natural resources and the rising
 cost of exploiting new resources, many located
 in remote and frozen areas of Siberia.
 --Technology gap.  Although the latest technology
 is employed in some areas--particularly in the
 defense and space industries--technology in the
 civilian economy generally lags far behind that
 of the West.   The Soviet system is particularly
 ineffective in moving new ideas and products
 from the research and development stage into
 full assembly-line production.   Moreover,
 Western equipment frequently is not as pro-
 ductive in a Soviet setting as it is on native
 ground.   Even as the USSR is struggling to
 catch up, the United States, Western Europe,
 and Japan are forging ahead with still newer
 technology.
 --Rising consumer expectations.   Though well fed
 and clothed compared with past generations,
 Soviet consumers are increasingly aware of the
 disparity between Soviet and Western living
 standards.   In 1973 the average Soviet citizen
 consumed only about one-third the goods and
 services of a US consumer.   Consumer grievances
 are especially acute as to housing, long queues,
 the poor quality of durables, and the indifferent
 quality of repair and other services.

 --Inefficient agriculture.   Nearly a third of the
 labor force is still employed on the farm; equip-
 ment is badly operated and maintained; and the
 cost of producing grain and meat is far above
 world market prices.   Agricultural labor is only
 about 10 percent as productive in the USSR as in
 the United States despite a decade of much larger
 investments in Soviet agriculture.
 Most of these problems seem rooted in the Soviet economic
 system itself, which is too centralized and clumsy for the
 increasingly complex economy.   Central planning,  for example,
 becomes more difficult as the number of links between pro-
 ducers, consumers, and suppliers multiplies.
 The Soviet incentive system is also ill-equipped to
 deal with today's problems.   Although it has been effective
 in maximizing physical output,  it has created bottlenecks
 and idle capacity,  sacrificed product quality, and dis-
 couraged innovation in production and management techniques.
 Thus far the leadership has been unwilling to act on
 the fact that fundamental change in the economic system is
 needed.   It has taken a few timid steps to reform the R&D
 sector and to reorganize industry.   At a Central Committee
 meeting last. December Brezhnev paid lip service to the need
 for improved economic management and planning but offered
 no specific proposals.   He realizes that a truly effective
 reform would decentralize decision-making and thereby diminish
 Party control over the economy.   In lieu of a direct attack
 on the problem,  the leadership apparently believes that it
 can take a shortcut to technological progress and accelerated
 growth by importing Western machinery and technology.   Some
 Soviet economists believe that,  if they set up a vast com-
 puter network,                        they can exert efficient central control over
 the rapidly expanding number of price and output decisions.
 Soviet experience with the computer to date shows these
 economists are almost certainly wrong.
