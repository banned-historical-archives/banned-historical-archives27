MEMORANDUM FOR: Bureau Chiefs 
SUBJECT: Letter of Information 
GERNERAL 
1. Chinese Developments: FBIS has continued to devote a major effort 
to coverage of the developing situation in Communist China, Okinawa Bureau 
resources were mobilized early in January with the first signs of serious 
disorder in the CPR, and other bureaus including West Coast and Tokyo have 
cohtributed extensively to the flow of information on China to the intelligence 
community. The Okinawa Bureau reports that its initial efforts were deVoted 
to known trouble spots of Nanking, Shanghai, and nearby municipal centers, 
with open speaker watches extensively employed. By mid-January, as more 
and more regional radios broke from the pattern of relaying the Peking 
central radio, the cruising unit became a focal point for coverage planning. 
Cruising scan charts, maintained throughout each broadcast day and covering 
all provincial and selected city radios audible, provided an up-to-the-minute 
record of radio behavior, The Acting Director, FBIS, commended the Okinawa 
Bureau for its eXtraordinary effort. 
The Wire Service, in addition to handling an expended volume of 
items on China, carried a number of special reports by RPD on "Developments 
in CPR Radio Propaganda," including 13 during the 19 January-10 February 
period alone. Several reports rounded up material filed by the Okinawa 
Bureau and the BBC's Hong Kong unit; others discussed highlights of the 
propaganda with relevant background; and special tables were prepared by RPD 
and MOS based .on Okinawa Bureau reporting showing the behavior pattern of 
the regional and local radios. The special Wire reports were also filed to 
interested Organization and military components in the Far East. 
Editorial Division began publishing two Far East daily reports on 
6 February to meet demands within the 9ommunity for information on 
Communist China to be contained in a single publication and to provide 
greater flexibility in page allocation. The first publication is called, 
"Far East I -- Communist China," the second "Far East II -- Asia and Pacific." 
Some five to fifteen additional pages daily have been devoted to Communist 
China since the split of the Far East book. 
Technical evaluation of North China regional material recently 
monitored in a reception survey at the Boikaido Bureau and processed by 
West Coast Bureau monitors indicated that provincial coverage could be

improved and numerous municipal radios not monitorable at Okinawa could be 
exploited at Hokkaido. A consumer evaluation of the material sampled at 
Hokkaido endorsed the value of the additional North China coverage, WCB 
Staff monitor Willie Wong was detailed to the Hokkaido Bureau in February 
to provide immediate augmentation of coverage; Hokkaido was also authorized 
to discontinue TABS Domestic (Cyrillic) Russian coverage to permit 
reallocation of limited Chinese capability to the Chinese effort, 
The Tokyo Bureau was authorized to employ contract personnel to 
increase reporting on China from the Japanese press. (SECRET) 
2. African Bureau Material: An evaluation of material filed by the 
African Bureau, conducted at the request of higher authority, has reaffirmed 
the importance of the bureau's mission. Consumer reaction to the material 
supplied by the bureau was highly favorable. OCI, State, and USIA 
considered the Kaduna output indispensable, with OCI citing it as "one of 
the major and most valued sources" of information on the area. Consumers 
pointed to the timeliness of the bureau's information, noting that it is 
frequently the first and best sourde; the uniqueness, with many events 
covered less thoroughly and belatedly by other sources; and the value of 
the textual material, such as major pronouncements by African leaders. 
Another study, conducted to determine whether the bureau's file might be 
duplicated by Western press agencies and The New York Times; indicated that 
the intelligence community cannot rely on such alternate sources for regular 
and routine coverage, and that an interruption or reduction of the African 
Bureau's reporting would deprive the community of a major source. (SECRET) 
3.rattion: Tension in Cyprus over the importation by the 
Cypriot Government of Czech arms and the government's announced intention 
of distributing them to the police forces continued to simmer during 
January. The Mediterranean Bureau made detailed plans to cope with the 
situation if a Greek-Turkish clash ensues over the arms issue. (SECRET) 
4. Saigon Bureau Activities: The Saigon Bureau has begun providing 
all Radio Hanoi and "Liberation Radio" program summaries to the 3-2 of the 
Military Assistance Command, Vietnam.. The summaries are analyzed' for 
indications of vulnerabilities and changes in military themes: In addition, 
MACV has assigned an intelligence officer to visit the bureau for a half-day 
twice weekly to analyze current materials. The results of the analysis, 
according to MACV, are incorporated in a weekly briefing for General 
Westmoreland and used in support of tactical operations as appropriate.

filed selected material on Vietnam and Communist China to Secretary of 
State Rusk while he was in Buenos Aires for a series of conferences to last 
through 22 February. 
An Organization component requested a recording of Mao Tse-Tung's 
voice. A tape was supplied by the West Coast Bureau from a speech to the 
Party Congress in 1956, the most recent recording of a Mao speech. 
An Agency component requested a sampling of material being broadcast 
by Chinese radios to USSR minorities inasmuch as the Soviet Union has charged 
that incitement material was being broadcast. Mediterranean Bureau sent 
Headquarters tapes of Urumchi in Kazakh and forwarded to London for 
processing-Urumchi in Uighur. Okinawa, Tokyo, and Hokkaido bureaus have been 
supplying Peking, Urumchi, and Huhehot broadcasts in Mongolian. 
On 7 February the Key West Bureau monitored from Havana television 
a radiophoto of a U.S. pilot who, according to Havana, had been downed in 
North Vietnam less than 46 hours before. The bureau is now forwarding to 
Headquarters expeditiously all monitored television material on U.S. POW's, 
downed aircraft, etc., carried by Havana from North Vietnam. 
The Okinawa Bureau responded to a special request from the 327th Air 
Division, Taipei, for information concerning a 13 January air engagement in 
the Formosa Straits. 
In response to.an urgent State Department request, FBIS provided 
Secretary Rusk with, the text of Soviet Premier Kosygin's 9 February London 
press conference prior to Mr. Rusk's own press conference the same day.

Chi Minh's 13 February reply to Pope Paul to Secretary Rusk in Buenos Aires. 
MOS fulfilled requests for reports on Chicom broadcasting requested 
by DIA, State, USIA, and the Special Operations Center of JOIC. The Census 
Bureau's Special International Survey Unit sought information on Cuban 
broadcast history for NIS purposes. (SECRET) 
7. Research and Analysis; The current debate concerning antimissile 
defense stimulated a number,of requests to RPD for Soviet leaders' statements 
on the question. Consumers were supplied with materials from the War Theigs 
file, as well as three past Radio Propaganda Reports on antimissile 
development and related topics. A Radio Propaganda Report now in production 
will provide a compilation of Soviet public statements on antimissile defense 
capability from 1956 to date. 
Beginning with the 2 February issue, the RPD Survey began carrying 
articles on individual facets of communist propaganda on Vietnam, replacing 
the biweekly reviews of the total propaganda picture. General reviews of 
propaganda concerning Vietnam in all major aspects will continue to appear 
weekly in the Trends. The first two special articles in the Survey dealt 
with propaganda reflecting tensions in CPR-DRV relations and with Hanoi 
propaganda on paramilitary units. (CONFIDENTIAL) 
43. Uses of FBIS.Material: The OCR CHIVE project, which is a 
computerized effort aimed at improving the flow of information within the 
intelligence community; is now incorporating into a regularly published 
index of material on the CPR references to the contents of the Far East 
Daily Report and the RPD Trends and Surveys. Within a few months the 
E-T-G Abstracts will be included in the index. Ultiffiately the project may 
make it possible to retrieve items from a complete file. (SECRET) 
Department of State cables recently cited several FBIS items on the 
Near East situation, including a reference to the Middle East Roundup of 
it February which reported Amman's rebuttal of UAR charges that Jordan had 
received U.S. arms free of charge. A cable from the Consulate General in 
Hong Kong cited FBIS monitoring of .a Shanghai broadcast of 14 January as 
being among the first reports from official CPR sources indicating disruption 
in rural areas resulting from the cultural revolution. A Department cable 
to the U.S. Embassy in London rioted that Ho Chi Minh's message to the Pope 
on 13 February, reiterating North Vietnam's four conditions for settlement
