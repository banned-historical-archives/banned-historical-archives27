 George Bush
 has been on the
 scene of the biggest
 political scandals of
 the last two decades.
 How does he
 always get
 out alive?
 1
 By Scott Armstrong
 and Jeff Nason
 I
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WERE EVALU-
 ated by bipartisan panels of experts and cho-
 sen for office as they might be admitted to a
 graduate program in international affairs,
 George Bush's national security resume would get him the
 job just as surely as Michael Dukakis's would get him sent
 back for remedial tutoring.
 No other candidate has been exposed to so many facets of
 the national security world. Bush has served as a congress-
 man, ambassador to the United Nations, envoy to China,
 and director of the Central Intelligence Agency. As vice
 president, Bush headed National Security Council groups
 on crisis management, drug interdiction, and terrorism.
 But Bush's record is a double-edged sword. Not just impres-
 sive entries on a resume, it invites closer inspection.
 That record is no distinguishable track of accomplish-
 ments. In fact, Bush's footprints are shallow when they are
 visible at all. For most of his career, Bush has been rele-
 gated to taking instructions rather than giving them, and his
 achievements are largely those of the people and institu-
 tions he served. His failures, too, reflect the failures of
 others.
 As director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1976,
 Bush became a Cabinet-level officer for the first time. For a
 year, Bush called the shots as intelligence czar in the Ford
 administration.
 What happened during that year? And what did Bush do
 at. the CIA's top man?

 - Orlando Bosch,
 an anti-Castro
 terrorist, was
 arrested in Costa
 Rica in 1976 when
 it was learned
 that he was
 planning to kill
 Henry Kissinger.
 According to former aides and
 a current high-ranking CIA
 official. Bush helped restore
 the CIA's damaged morale
 and reestablish ties with for-
 eign intelligence agencies. He
 also effectively sheltered the
 Agency from congressional
 wrutir.y.
 In the process, though,
 Bush "virtually turned the
 store over" to those he was
 supposedly bringing under
 rein. During Bush's tenure,
 the message to the intelligence
 community was clear: Bush
 would look the other way, ig-
 noring improprieties deemed
 necessary to get the job done.
 Covert operators learned that the way to deal with Bush a'
 director was to keep him "out of the loop" for information
 about operations that Congress might challenge. By the time
 he left the CIA in January 1977, Bush had also learned that
 ..out of the loop" was a good place to be-especially if one
 had presidential ambitions.
 Top Spy. If the appointment of George Herbert Walker
 Bush as director of the Central Intelligence Agency was not
 preordained, neither was it entirely accidental. As often
 happens in Washington. Bush's elevation to the post of the
 country's chief spymaster was typical Washington-a prod-
 uct, for the most part, of hardball partisan politics.
 As Gerald Ford prepared to run for president in late 1975,
 he was an incumbent with practically no record facing plenty
 of obstacles. His pardon of Richard Nixon had turned into a
 political tar baby. As if that weren't enough,
 the House and Senate had set up competing
 committees which were revealing, on an al-
 most daily basis. news of abuses by the CIA.
 White House political strategists had
 been counting on a public relations break
 from the sensational exposes swirling
 around the CIA. William Colby, Ford's di-
 rector of central intelligence, had been
 lauded by congressional investigators for his
 cooperation with them. But the result of
 Colby's efforts-like attempts to shovel
 during a snowstorm-turned out to be a
 seemingly endless series of revelations: se-
 cret drug testing, spying on U.S. citizens,
 assassination plots against foreign leaders.
 Even when these horror stories con-
 cerned events that had occurred under Dem-
 ocratic administrations, each revelation
 seemed to taint Ford. Colby-a symbol of
 past abuses-would have to be replaced.
 Ford's aides sorted through a "final" list
 of possible successors to Colby, but they
 were unsure if any of the candidates could
 sufficiently reassure both the public and
 Congress. They approached Edward Bennett Williams. a
 prominent trial lawyer and longtime Democrat, who turned
 down the offer. They then decided to offer the position to
 Elliot Richardson, whose reputation for independence and
 rectitude had been mightily enhanced by his resignation as
 attorney general during the Watergate scandal. Before Rich-
 ardson could be offered the job, however, partisan politics
 intervened.
 Ford needed, after all, to be nominated before he could
 turn his attention to the general election, and Vice President
 Nelson Rockefeller was too liberal to carry a Ford ticket
 through the Republican convention--especially with a
 strong right-wing challenge already promised by Ronald
 Reagan. Clearly Ford needed a conservative running mate,
 but as soon as he settled on Robert Dole his advisers feared
 that George Bush-already miffed at having been passed up
 for the vice presidency when Rockefeller was selected-
 could spoil their strategy.
 Only five months after Bush had arrived as chief of the
 U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing, some of the frequent visitors
 he had hosted there began leaking word that his first year in
 China would probably be his last. He had expressed interest
 in the post of secretary of commerce, but Ford worried that if
 Bush returned in such a domestically prominent role in Janu-
 ary 1976, he would be free to challenge Ford or at least to take
 a shot at the vice presidency.
 The Ford White House was genuinely interested in getting
 a Democrat or an independent Republican as director of
 central intelligence, but that prospect paled before the oppor-
 tunity of removing a partisan Republican from the 1976
 electoral sweepstakes. If they gave Bush the job. he would be
 forced to bow out of the 1976 race; so they decided to pull a
 switch: offer Richardson the top spot at the Department of
 Commerce and Bush the directorship of the CIA.
 On paper, Bush was a reasonable, if political, choice. He

 way a loyal Republican whose impressive dossier included
 membership in Skull and Bones, the prestigious secret soci-
 ety at Yak; a father who was a moderate Republican senator
 from Connecticut during the Eisenhower and Kennedy ad-
 ministrations; two terms in the House of Representatives
 from Texas; an unsuccessful but not embarrassing campaign
 against Lloyd Bentsen for a U. S. Senate seat in 1970; a tour as
 ambassador to the United Nations, in which he encountered
 every imaginable foreign affairs issue; yeoman service as
 chair of the beleaguered Republican National Committee,
 during the darkest hours of Nixon's agonized and gradually
 deteriorating defense; and, following the RNC, the stint in
 Beijing. where he was the visible manifestation of the slow-
 motion U.S.-China courtship.
 Only those who worked closely with Bush knew that in the
 U.N. job he had deferred alternately to the State Department
 and to his own career staff. He loyally obeyed detailed
 instructions from Henry Kissinger as well. Similarly, only a
 few insiders knew how completely irrelevant he had been to
 U.S.-China policy. Every nuance of initiative had belonged
 to Kissinger. Despite Bush's public persona as a world states-
 man, until his job at the CIA he had actually been little more
 than a messenger carrying out orders for the Nixon and Ford
 administrations.
 Kissinger cabled Bush in Beijing with the offer of director
 of central intelligence on November I. 075. Bush consulted
 his wife, Barbara. before quickly accepting the offer.
 Oniy two weeks earlier, Kissinger had been in Beijing to
 arrange for President Ford's December trip to China, but he
 hadn't mentioned the coming offer. During the visit, Bush
 got to accompany Kissinger to a meeting with Chairman
 Mao Zedong, whom he had never met.
 Bush was thrilled when Mao took notice of him. "This
 ambassador is in a plight," Mao said, in apparent reference to
 Kissinger's overshadowing presence. "Why don't you come
 visit?"
 "I would be honored:' Bush replied, "but I'm afraid
 you're very busy."
 "Oh. I'm not busy:" Mao said. "I don't look after internal
 affairs. I only read the international news. You should really
 come visit" Back at the liaison office. Bush asked his staff
 whether they thought Mao was serious, but they told him
 Mao was just being diplomatic. As usual, Bush deferred to
 them and dropped the matter-only to wonder later if he had
 muffed an historic opportunity.
 By the time Bush returned to Washington, key Republi-
 cans from the House and Senate had written asking him to
 withdraw his name from consideration for vice president, to
 prevent any implication of politicizing the CIA. As he pre-
 pared for confirmation hearings in mid-December, he began
 hearing from old friends that he had been "a damned fool to
 say yes" and give up his own political future. His Yale
 classmate and fellow Skull and Bones member Thomas
 Ludlow "Lud" Ashley, a House Democrat at the time, asked
 Bush, "What the fuck do you know about intelligence?"
 "Ask me in six weeks," a confident Bush responded.
 Going Home. In the next few weeks. Bush received a
 crash course. As he waited for confirmation by the Senate,
 the difficulties Colby had been confronting grew even more

 dire. In early 1975, the Justice Department had opened a per-
 jury investigation against former CIA director Richard
 Helms over his sworn statement denying Agency involve-
 ment in the 1973 military coup in Chile. Investigations of
 additional CIA activities and of at least a dozen other officials
 were already under way.
 To counter the continuing congressional scrutiny and go
 on the offensive with the press, the administration unleashed
 Colby, who as outgoing chief had nothing to risk, on the
 Agency's critics, while Bush worked to establish a new, more
 cooperative relationship with Congress. The ammunition for
 Colby's attack on Congress and the press arrived on Decem-
 ber 23, 1975, when Richard Welch, chief of the CIA's Athens
 station, was murdered on his doorstep. Colby immediately
 denounced Counterspy magazine, which he claimed had un-
 masked Welch.
 The Agency's own internal investigation concluded that
 Welch's position and local home address were well known,
 and that he had been targeted in connection with his activities
 in Cyprus and Lebanon. But Colby broadened his complaint
 to include the "sensational and hysterical way the CIA inves-
 tigations had been handled and trumpeted around the
 world"-painting the congressional committees with the
 same brush he had used, inaccurately, to tar Counterspy.
 Moving In. Mean-
 while, at the end of January,
 Bush was confirmed by the
 Senate. As he moved into
 the CIA: Langley, Virginia,
 headquarters, he took con-
 trol of the most inbred bu-
 reaucracy in government.
 Room 7D5607 was an unat-
 tractive, cramped. L-

 square sitting area with a
 column incongruously
 placed in the middle, a
 cramped alcove housing the
 director's desk, and picture
 windows overlooking a pan-

 In his first months on the
 job. Bush turned his energy
 away from the Agency. It
 seemed easier and more
 important, according to
 former aides, to change the
 CIA's relationship with
 Capitol Hill than to alter

 the Agency to satisfy the Hill. Bush's central charge would
 be to keep the House and Senate intelligence committees at
 bay.
 The more hostile of the two, the House committee which
 was chaired by New York Democrat Otis Pike. soon gave
 Bush an unexpected opportunity. On February 11 and 18,
 1976, the Village Win published a copy of the suppressed,
 uncensored Pike committee report, later revealed to have

 from Washington, he now sat at the Cabinet table But what
 he brought to the table was largely what those deputies under
 him recommended or insisted upon. There were few oppor-
 tunities to exercise his own initiative. If Bush had been
 deferential and loyal to his staff in previous jobs, he became
 downright obedient to those he was supposedly overseeing in
 the new job at Langley.
 With the lingering odor of past abuses stifling support for
 new adventures, Bush's year at the CIA was one in which few
 new initiatives were undertaken in the covert operations
 wing of CIA headquarters. "I doubt there were any covert
 operations at all during Bush," one Agency veteran com-
 ments, adding that Bush's tenure was "largely ineffective
 aside from damage control. He didn't seem to have any
 particular interest in intelligence."
 One of the Agency's current ranking officials says Bush
 "had no lead in directing the Agency, especially on the
 operations side." In general. this official added, the director
 is kept insulated from the operations side of Agency activity.
 "The director spends so much time explaining to the people
 that he has little to no time to look at what we, in the
 operations division, are doing." (Bush would make 51 ap-
 pearances on Capitol Hill during his year at the CIA.)
 Some of the problems he'd inherited concerning covert
 operations lingered on. The Senate committee wanted to
 know more, for example, about what was going on in Angola,
 since the Senate had prohibited any financial support to Jonas
 Savimbi's rebel forces there.
 Bush's greatest asset in successfully carrying the Angola
 ball forward turned out to be his delicate balance of knowl-
 edge and ignorance. In the beginning, he was able to honestly
 report that, to his knowledge at least, the Agency was abiding
 by official admonitions against further U.S. covert
 involvement.
 The CIA had narrowly averted an investigation the pre-
 vious December, when Deputy Director for Operations Wil-
 liam Nelson testified to the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee that the Agency was sending arms to Angola,
 which was the opposite of what the CIA had previously
 claimed. Now, with Bush at the helm, the Agency assured
 and reassured Congress that aid had indeed been cut off.
 One continuing problem was the revelation of CIA manip-
 ulation of public opinion in this country. Case officers from
 the Lusaka, Zambia, station had planted false propaganda in
 the U.S. press in late September 1975 that Soviets were in
 Angola advising government forces. In fact, there was no
 evidence for this claim, but the Agency continued planting
 disinformation about Cuban soldiers committing nonexistent
 atrocities. In February 1976, a CIA-sponsored free-lance
 journalist reported falsely in the iihshing:on Pbst that South
 Africans were not assisting Savimbi.
 The CIA continued to deny to congressional committees
 that arms were still being shipped to the Angolan rebels
 when, in fact, they continued to be shipped. through allies in
 the region. As each new detail about illegalities and improper
 aid was revealed, Bush first denied, then admitted the CIA
 wrongdoing, quickly adding that he had just learned the
 news.
 When Bush went to the Hill for closed-door briefings, he
 shared only a portion of the little he had learned about the
 OCTOBER 1988

 come to it through CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr. The
 CIA argued that the report contained information that endan-
 gered U.S. agents and seriously compromised the country's
 intelligence-gathering capability.
 Overnight the political landscape shifted from support for
 investigations of the CIA to questions about the motives of its
 critics. Bush took advantage of the shift.
 As principal Agency liaison to Capitol Hill, Bush initiated
 a friendly relationship with key Democrats and Republicans
 on the Senate Intelligence Committee. According to its staff
 director at the time, William Miller, Bush seemed coopera-
 tive and forthcoming, a respected "member of the club" who
 had regular access to the president. (In fact, according to
 former aides of Bush, although he regularly briefed the presi-
 dent, and had a permanent rotation in Ford's tennis four-
 some, he exercised less influence over President Ford than
 was often assumed on the Hill.)
 On February 18, 1976, the Ford Wl;ite House was able to
 catch the unsuspecting congressional committees by sur-
 prise. By issuing Executive Order 11905, "to establish poli-
 cies to improve the quality of intelligence needed for national
 security (and] to clarify the authority and responsibilities of
 the intelligence departments and agencies;' Ford preempted
 a statute whereby Congress could tell the executive what to
 do. Ironically. although this reorganization of the intelligence
 community would become one of the historic hallmarks of
 his service as the Agency's director, Bush had nearly nothing
 to do with it. The arrangements had been worked out over the
 previous six months by two Ford advisers.
 The Senate Intelligence Committee, sensing that it lacked
 sufficient public support for further extending its inquiry,
 struck a secret arrangement with Bush and the CIA, accord-
 ing to two of the committee's senior staff members. Rather
 than move directly to a new oversight process, there would be
 an interregnum during which the committee would neither
 set specific reporting requirements on the Agency nor pass
 binding legislation. Bush would share information with the
 committee, with both parties understanding that a new, more
 cooperative oversight relationship would evolve over time.
 Moving On, From Bush's point of view it was imperative
 to get the Agency back to business as usual. The most
 pressing priority was to restore the confidence and morale of
 the thousands of agents who felt that anything they did would
 be examined and criticized by Congress and the press.
 Bush "took pride in the morale-building sessions ... he
 considers this one of his real accomplishments. (I find that] a
 little strange," says his friend Lud Ashley, who spoke often
 with Bush about his experience as director of the CIA. It is
 unclear, however, even to his old friend, what else Bush did
 besides cheerkading.
 As he settled into the CIA job, Bush continued his pep
 rally approach to personnel management. Bush's perception
 of his responsibility was to deliver information to the presi-
 dent, but not to implement policy or linger at the table as a
 decision-maker. He considered himself "out of the loop" for
 major foreign policy decisions. For those around Ford, this
 role helped set up Bush as a buffer with the Hill; he was the
 honest broker, not a player calling the shots.
 While Bush had done little before but accept instructions

 Angola situation, and then only in generalities. Here, accord-
 ing to those who mended the briefings, he was at his best-
 sincere and cooperative. When necessary. Bush brought

 look the other way, it would be forced to
 open a Pandora's box of more congressio-
 nal investigation. Hoping to avoid months
 or years of additional inquiry, Bush's clos-
 est aides arranged to keep him as free as
 possible of "irrelevant details," thus maxi-
 mizing his ability to deny there was a prob-
 lem. Reports of Cuban-American activity
 were handled routinely as FYI items within
 the bureaucracy below, and rogue opera-
 tions were seldom reined in. There were,
 however, exceptions to this rule.
 In February 1976, the CIA blew the
 whistle on Orlando Bosch, a Miami pedi-
 atrician and anti-Castro organizer. Bosch
 was detained by Costa Rican police for
 plotting to assassinate Henry Kissinger.
 The plot was reportedly organized because
 Kissinger had been conducting negotia-
 tions to improve relations with Cuba.
 The CIA also intervened when officials
 learned the Chilean Intelligence Service
 (DINA) was planning to use Cuban ex-CIA
 agents to assassinate Chilean exiles in Por-
 tugal and France through a regional coun-
 ter-terrorist organization known as
 Operation Condor. Headed by Chile, Oper-
 ation Condor included agents from Argen-
 tina. Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, and
 Uruguay dedicated wracking down "sub-
 versives" throughout the hemisphere. The
 details of the plot were passed to the CIA's
 intelligence liaisons in Portugal and
 France, and they squelched it.
 In these cases, Bush's CIA proved capable
 of averting attacks planned by its friends.
 Unfortunately for targets of similar plots. the
 Agency did not develop any systematic way
 of dealing with such terrorist threats.
 Assassination Abroad. On June 16,
 1976, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon
 Francis E. Meloy, Jr., his driver, and the
 embassy's economic counselor were assas-
 sinated on their way to a meeting with
 Lebanese president-elect Elias Sarkis.
 President Ford converted an emergency
 meeting in the White House Situation
 Room to focus on the potential danger to
 other Americans in Lebanon.
 the crisis group--Ford. Bush,
 Kissinger. National Security Adviser Brent
 Scowcroft, Deputy Defense Secretary
 William Clements, Jr., and Chairman of
 the Joint Chiefs of Staff George Brown-
 was convened four times in the next four
 days.
 On this rare occasion. Bush moved be-
 yond the role of information-provider, feel-
 ing that the murder meant a "new, more
 dangerous level of terrorist activity in Bei-
 rut." This would warrant ordering Ameri-
 cans to evacuate, a move Kissinger
 opposed. Ford agreed with Bush; a navy
 task force moved in and evacuated 166

 the CIA had less and less to share with its
 counterparts abroad.
 The information Bush wanted could he
 obtained, the CIA's clandestine operators
 assured him, but only if Bush made it clear
 that the CIA would not crack down on "co-
 operative" intelligence Agency acts. ities
 and report their plans or the information
 they shared to the FBI.
 At that point, according to a stiii-acme
 CIA official. Bush made a tactical judg-
 ment, one of the few clear choices of his
 career. He wanted to concentrate on col-
 lecting more information on terrorist act iv-
 ities around the world. But in order to get it.
 the CIA had to cooperate with friendly
 foreign agencies operating in the United
 States. No further pressure would be
 brought to bear on rogue operations of "co-
 operative" intelligence agencies. He would
 try to find ways to help them rather than to
 curtail their activities.
 That was the backdrop when the U.S.
 ambassador to Paraguay, George Landau.
 cabled the CIA on July 28 to say that he had
 just issued special U S. visas to two Chil-
 ean military operatives who had been is-
 sued fake passports by Paraguayan intel-
 ligence officials. The two c rimed th:y
 were heading to Washington to meet with
 CIA Deputy Director Vernon Walters.
 among other things. In a separate courier
 pouch. Landau sent photocopies of the
 passports to Walters. Back from the CIA
 came a "service message" acknowledging
 receipt of his cable and stating that it had
 been "delivered to George Bush, the direc-
 tor of the Central Intelligence Agency ...."
 (In a 1980 interview with one of the au-
 thors. Bush denied that he ever saw this
 memo, claiming he had been on a trip to
 China at the time.)
 On August 4, the CIA forwarded a re-
 sponse on behalf of the recently retired
 Walters to the U.S. ambassador in Para-
 guay, stating "that he was unaware of the
 visit and that his Agency did not desire to
 have any contact with the Chileans." The
 ambassador revoked the visas. Two, d ys
 later the CIA sent the photographs accom-
 panying the visas back to the State
 Department.
 This series of transactions meant little to
 anyone in the CIA except those in the clan-
 destine service who had followed Opera-
 tion Condor, the counterterrorism program
 that the Agency would block later that year
 from assassinating Chilean exiles in Portu-
 gal and France The cooperation hetween
 intelligence operatives of two, member na-
 tions-Paraguay and Chile-meant they
 were probably gearing up for an action in
 the United States.
 The situation became even more omi-
 nous when the CIA learned from a tele-
 phone call in late August that the two
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/05/25: CIA-RDP99-01448R000401580029-0
 Bush was thrilled with his expanded
 role. He went back to the Agency, anxious
 to follow through with more information.
 For the first time in his career he was really
 a center-stage actor on a par with Kissinger.
 Bush wanted to know what the Agency
 could do to react to this new terrorist threat.
 The analytical side of the CIA had little
 that could help Bush. The National Secu-
 rity Agency had soaked up millions of con-
 versations from special listening posts arw;
 satellites around the world, and it was be-
 ginning to process all this material through
 its new Cray advanced computers. But the
 results were largely useless, according to a
 ranking intelligence official at the time,
 because Bush and his predecessors had not
 heeded warnings that the expanded techno-
 logical take of signals intercepted would be
 left unprocessed if the funds for analysis
 were not vastly increased.
 Bush, who had been granted the addi-
 tional responsibility-for the first time in
 CIA history-to control the budgets of all
 intelligence agencies, had deferred this de-
 cision, like so many others. There was vir-
 tually nothing the Agency analysts could
 immediately do to assess, or help combat,
 the terrorists in Lebanon.
 So Bush turned instead to the clandes-
 tine operators who routinely collect human
 intelligence abroad. Within the clandestine
 service side of the Agency, the Meloy assas-
 sination raised serious questions Most in-
 telligence fr,Mi Lebanon came from three
 sources: Mossad. Israel's intelligence ser-
 vice; SAVAK, Iran's intelligence service;
 and a limited group of Lebanese Phalan-
 gists and assorted rightists who had been
 managed out of the Athens CIA station by
 Richard Welch.
 In general, the ability to keep up files on
 opposition parties, dissidents, and expatri-
 ate political factions in any country de-
 pends largely on the cooperation of the host
 government. With Richard Welch's murder
 the previous December, the Agency had
 become more dependent than ever on infor-
 mation from Israel and Iran.
 U.S. intelligence officials felt they
 needed to be able to reciprocate to get ef-
 fective cooperation. The Korean CIA was
 interested in Korean dissidents in the
 United States; SAVAK wanted to know the
 movements of the Shah's opposition;
 Mossad wanted every available piece of in-
 formation on Palestinian political maneu-
 vers in Washington; the Philippines secret
 police needed reports on anti-Marcos
 forces; and so forth.
 As a result of legislation and the intel-
 ligence reforms of the previous year,
 though, the CIA was flatly banned from
 conducting any domestic surveillance, in-
 cluding watching foreign opposition move-
 ments based in the United States, In short.

 agents were in Washington But under the
 guidelines for dealing with "cooperative"
 Intelligence organizations, there was no re-
 porting mechanism to track this informa-
 tion and alert the director
 Ilirect (:IA Invuhenrent. Meanwhile,
 other ominous information was circulating
 in.ide the CIA. On September 7. 1976. a
 former CIA officer named Kevin Mulcahy
 had called Theodore Shackley, the associ-
 ate deputy director of operations. Mulcahy
 reported that another firmer CIA agent,
 h.dwin Wilson, was training Libyan terror-
 fists in explosives and was providing the
 timing devices for detonators. Wilson was
 getting the devices from William Weisen-
 burger, the CIA's technical expert. and
 from an Agency supplier. Scientific Com-
 munications. Wilson and another former
 CIA officer were shipping firearms to Li-
 ht, a. and they were planning to ship Redeye
 missiles. Most significantly. Wilson was
 coordinating his clearly illegal activities
 through Thomas Clines, Shackley's firmer
 ,uhord;natc in several CIA assignments.
 Shackley knew Wilson well and had used
 the intelligence Wilson derived from his
 trips to I.ihya. Shackley filet: w memo with
 his bons. William Wells. describing in flat
 terms what Mulcahy had said. Wells turned
 the matter over to the CIA's inspector gen-
 eral, John Waller, who then dispatched a
 deputy, Thomas Cox. to see Mulcahy.
 Cox was troubled M Wilson's activities
 Active CIA personnel we-t im,olved, and
 former agents were still using their contacts
 in the commission of illegal acts. Mulcahy
 and others believed the activities had been
 authorized or semiofficial "oft-the-books"
 activities (for which the Agency went out-
 side normal channels, using private opera-
 tives who maintained it lower level of
 accountability and increased deniability).
 And Tom Clines, himself suspected of
 wrongdoing. had conducted two interviews
 as part of the investigation. A record of
 serious compromise was building. Clearly
 a larger investigation was called for, but
 Cox was put on hold
 In consultation with Bush's office, the
 inspector general's office made a strategic
 decision. On September 17, they turned
 over the preliminary information uttered by
 Mulcahy and those they had interviewed to
 the FBI.
 Clines, along with other CIA officials,
 knew that Mulcahy had gone to the FBI On
 September 20, Clines reported that a Cu-
 ban-American former CIA agent still used
 from time to time by the Agency, Rafael
 -Chi Chi-' Quintero, had sought Clines out
 the day before. (Quintero would reemerge,

 about :urrent CIA employees and contrac-

 A new round of damaging self-examina-

 He had recently spoken publicly about the
 Agenc%"s success in overcoming its advei-
 sarial relatioiship with Congress. "How
 we can ferret out corruption has given way
 to the more serious question of how we can
 get better intelligence." Bush said on
 ABC's 1.i.sue.s and Answers. Oversight,
 Bush said, was no longer to see if "every-
 body at the CIA is a bunch of crooks:' but
 to improve the quality of the job the intel-
 ligence agencies were doing. Bush dreaded
 the prospect of having to watch the adver-
 sarial relationship reemerge. Any indica-

 books" would surely spawn precisely that
 reaction

 the FBI soon and conduct his own internal
 in%estigation. he ran the risk of earning
 himself a scandal for covering up.
 Two days later, a Cubana Airlines jet en
 route to Kingston exploded shortly after
 takeoff from Barbados's Seawell Airport,
 killing all 73 people aboard, including 24
 members of the Cuban fencing team. Fidel
 Castro immediately blamed the CIA. In
 Miami, a man with a Hispanic accent
 called the Miami Herald saying he repre-
 sented Operation Condor and claiming
 credit for the bombing. A Miami radio sta-
 tion also received a call from a woman who
 claimed the bombing had been carried out
 h~ CORU, the violent Cuban-American
 group bent on overthrowing Castro.
 Within two days. Venezuelan police ar-
 rested two CORD leaders. Orlando Bosch
 and Luis Posada Carries, in connection
 -A iih the bombing. Confessions from two
 other men who admitted planting the
 hornh, in addition to evidence gathered at
 Posada's v]1a, had led to the capture of the
 CORC leaden. (Bosch was the Miami pe-
 diatrician who had been arrested the pre-
 ceding February to squelch a plot to kill
 Henry Kissinger. Posada would reemerge
 in 1985 in a CIA counterterrorism opera-
 turn in El Salvador. That operation would
 he headed by F:lix Rodriguez. who was
 originally recruited for the job through
 Vice President Bush's office.)
 CIA operatives knew, from information
 supplied by several former agents who were
 now members of CORD, that the charges
 Here accurate. But if the CIA conducted a
 lull-scale investigation of CORU. or even
 pulled together all the information it had
 as ai lable. it would certainly lead to another
 sear of hearings about the operation of the
 ,'IA's Miami station-a hubof Agency ac-
 tistts --rot to mention the Wilson and Le-
 tclier matters, both of which appeared to
 have CORU links.
 I.apham followed up quickly with Prop-
 per over the next few days to iron out a
 ooperative agreement with the Justice De-
 partment. The attorney general, having
 found indications in the criminal investiga-
 tion that foreign agents might have been
 involved, requested that the director report
 on an  aspects of the murders that might
 relate to the security of the United States.
 In addition, at the CIA's request the
 agreement stated that if the Agency found
 amthing indicating criminal activity, it
 ssould turn that information over to the Jus-
 tice Department, as required by law. The
 CIA would provide "relevant" informa-
 tion Justice could not use this information
 in court unless it could he independently
 obtained from a second source. If some-
 thing from the CIA was crucial to the Jus-
 tice Department's case, the president
 would decide whether it could be used.
 The provisions of this new agreement
 ensured that the CIA would not investigate
 in the field or pull together information, but
 would, instead, turn over discrete bits of
 information for the FBI to pin down. There
 was, however, no language which required
 that the CIA tell the FBI or Justice Depart-
 ment what the details meant. And the CIA
 knew that the FBI's institutional pride
 would not permit it to ask the Agency to
 explain things very often.
 This seemingly benign addition to the
 agreement appeared to Propper to be a
 minor afterthought. Of course the Justice
 Department should investigate criminal ac-
 tivity: that made sense. What Propper had
 no way of knowing was the extent to which
 this agreement would be treated, inside the
 Agency, as an escape hatch.
 The implication of the suggested lan-
 guage had shifted from a bland dictum that
 the CIA "turn over" indications of criminal
 activity to a more resolute proclamation.
 Now, the CIA would not itself investigate
 matters that might involve criminal activ-
 ity: it would instead hand over its raw data
 about bewilderingly cornplicat"d cases to
 the FBI and the Justice Department.
 The impact of this agreement in the
 wake of the assassination and bombings
 was enormou. By simply turning mate-
 rials over to the FBI and the president's
 Intelligence Oversight Board, the CIA
 could avert an internal inquiry. By ducking
 the responsibility to investigate internally.
 Bush and Lapham assured that the least
 amount of information harmful to the
 Agency could possibly surface. (Lapham
 claims that his only intention was to clear
 the way for CIA cooperation with the attor-
 ney general.)
 The effect of these developments was to
 ensure that investigations slowed to a slug-
 gish pace. In the Letelier murder investiga-
 tion. for example, the CIA lid not tell
 Justice Department investigators anything
 about the Chilean agents, or their stopover
 in Paraguay, for more than two years.
 In his 1987 autobiography, George Bush
 doesn't explain these developments, mak-
 ing only an oblique reference to four Latin
 American nations which he reports ceased
 their cooperation with the Agency when
 stories about the existence of Operation
 Condor first surfaced. There is no reference
 to the harassment, surveillance, and vio-
 lence directed by "friendly" intelligence
 agencies at people living in the United
 States. There is no explanation for the fail-
 ure to control CORU. or for stalling tactics
 in the Wilson case. And there is no justi-
 fication offered for the CIA's refusal, until
 after Bush left office, to significantly assist
 in identifying and capturing those respons-
 ible for the assassination of Orlando
 Letelier.
