 An announcement that South
 Vietnam's government executive
 group will be modified has cli-
 maxed a hectic week
 eminence by careful selection of
 civilian additions, who at the
 same time will probably satisfy
 general aspirations in non-Bud-
 dhist quarters for some kind of  25X1
 "change" in the present regime.
 25X1
 Following two days of ex-
 ploratory talks with both mili-
 tant and moderate Buddhists and
 a temporary cessation of agita-
 tion in Saigon, the government
 announced on 1 June that the
 present ten-man military Direc-
 torate would be enlarged within
 five days to include ten civilian
 representatives of mass organiza-
 tions and political and religious
 groups.  A 150-man "Armed Forces
 - Peoples' Congress," with ad-
 visory responsibilities, will
 also be created by 19 June.
 The decision to effect these
 revisions probably stems from
 a number of assessments by gov-
 ernment leaders.  The military
 leaders will most likely be able
 to ensure their continued pre-
 Buddhist leaders thus far
 have generally voiced no opposi-
 tion to the government's announced
 revision, but are in some dis-
 agreement over whether it re re-
 sents enough of a change.~~

 Vietnamese on 28-29 May..  PAUL
 REVERE is a 60-day sweep opera-
 tion designed to disrupt Commu-
 nist preparations for rainy- ,
 season attacks in the central
 highlands.  Since its initiation
 on 9 May, 357 Viet Cong have. been
 killed and 14 captured.
 Enemy activity was highlighted
 by two battalion-size attacks in
 provinces west of Saigon.  On 26
 May an estimated two Communist
 battalions attacked a post in
 Kien Phong Province, killing 51
 Vietnamese and wounding 63.  Com-
 munist losses- were 20 killed.
 On 27 May an estimated two Viet
 Cong battalions attacked Doc Hue
 in Hau Nghai Province, killing
 eleven persons.  The Communists
 also mortared Vinh Long Airfield
 and harassed commercial-shipping
 in the main channe'1 `leading to
 Saigon. ..Two ships were damaged
 by underwater mines while in  ,
 transit to Saigon, and mines were
 found attached 'to another merchant
 ship in the area.-
 In I Corps during the week,
 the government once again re-
 vamped its leadership, and dissi-
 dent generals Thi and Dinh began
 to waver in their support of the
 struggle movement after-talks with
 government leaders.  However, the
 temporary absence of any respon=
 Bible-local authority in Hue
 created a st-ate of near anarchy
 in which militant students and
 other undisciplined elements
 freely committed random acts of
 violence, including the burning
 of the vacant US Consulate.  Sai-

 PROGRESS TOWARD 1 Na{~NES i ~N-MALAYS I AN SETTLEMENT
 Indonesia and Malaysia have
 apparently reached general agree-

 year-old dispute.
 Indonesian Foreign Minister
 Malik and Malaysian Deputy Prime
 Minister Razak announced at the
 end of their Bangkok talks on
 31 May that agreement, subject
 to ratification by their govern-
 ments, had been reached on "prin-
 ciples upon which practical steps
 to restore friendly relations
 should be based."  The agreement
 reached reportedly provides for
 establishing diplomatic relations,
 some form of determination of
 Sabah`s and 5arawak's desire to
 remain within the Malaysian
 federation, and the "immediate"
 cessation of hostilities.
 a rapprochement, arrangements
 for its implementation have yet
 to be made.  Malik told reporters
 after the talks that diplomatic
 relations would come "in due
 course" but emphasized that
 further talks would have to be
 held.  It appears likely that a
 perhaps extended period of ne-
 gotiation will be necessary be-
 fore the pra:posed settlement can
 be completed..
 On 31 May Manila announced
 its intention to establish full
 diplomatic relations with ~ialay-

 CAMBODIANS INCREASINGLY D1~-SATISFIED WITH SIHANOUK
 There are indications that
 anti-Sihanouk sentiment in Phnom
 Penh may be reaching serious pro-
 portions.
 dissatisfaction with his policies
 has become more pronounced among
 the Phnom Penh elite in recent
 months as the country's fragile
 economic situation continues to
 deteriorate.  Misgivings about
 the wisdom of Sihanouk's economic
 policies have been aggravated by
 indications- that the 1966 rice
 exports, Cambodia's major source
 of income, will be substantially
 below the level of past years ap-
 parently as a result of a poor
 harvest and the government's mis-
 management of traditional market-
 ing procedures.
 There are some indications
 that an illicit outflow of rice
 to the Viet Cong is also having
 an effect on the amount of rice
 available to the government for
 export.  Although the quantity
 of rice which the Communists are
 purchasing from Cambodian sources
 this year--probably between 20,000
 and 30,000 tons--is small in com-
 parison with the 500,000 tons
 which Cambodia normally exports,
 there is a possibility that Chi-
 nese middlemen are withholding
 rice from the government purchas-
 ~ng agency in the expectation of
 making greater profits by future
 sales to the Viet Cong.
 Sihanouk's difficulties with
 the Phnom Penh elite are based on
 more than economic problems, how-
 ever.  There appears to be wide-
 spread sentiment among the royal
 family, high-ranking politicians,
 and military leaders that Siha-
 nouk's arbitrary exercise of
 power, capricious meddling in
 everyday affairs,-and intemperate
 foreign policy statements must
 be curbed.  Their grievances have
 been aggravated in recent months
 by the arrest of several left-
 and right-wing political figures
 and by stepped-up fighting along
 the Thai border, which apparently
 has been a source of increasing
 concern to the military leader-
 ship.
 These groups have long been
 at odds with Sihanouk's policies,
 particularly those associated with
 the renunciation of US aid in late
 1963.  At the same time, they
 have not considered moving against
 him because of their vested in-
 terest in the status quo, their
 lack of leadership, and their
 inability to match Sihanouk's
 power base among the Cambodian
 people.  Sihanouk's decision to
 cancel a long-planned European
 trip--at least partially in re-
 sponse to the signs of restive-
 ness--suggests that this time the
 situation may be different.~l

 LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE IN PEKING
 A shake-up of Mao Tse-

 His grip probably was loosened

 removal would strengthen Teng's
 position and perhaps weaken that
 of Liu Shao-chi, who has been
 nominally second in the party
 since at least 1945.  It is even
 possible that the highly mili-
 tant and vigorous Teng has
 supplanted the colorless Liu
 as Mao's chosen successor.
 probably does not aspire to the
 top slot.
 The reluctance so far to
 name important figures indicates
 that the shake-up is still in
 progress and that more revela-
 tions are due.  A number of key
 officials who have been out of
 public view for many months may
 also have been casualties of the
 struggle.  They include Lu Ting-
 yi,  director  of the propaganda
 department of the central
 committee; Yang Shang-kun, Mao's
 personal link to the secretariat;
 Yang  Yue~g,  commander  of  the  Pe-
 kngbiilitary Command; and Lo
 Jui-thing, army chief of staff
 and a top security official.
 Chou En-lai--China's
 Itlikoyan in terms of flexibility--
 appears thus far to have managed
 to stay aloof from the fray.  He
 is a useful technician and as
 such has a good chance to sur-
 vive regardless of the final out-
 come.  Contrary to Western press
 speculation, Defense Minister
 Lin Piao probably is not a
 contender.  His name -is often
 used to reinforce Mao's author-

 so a campaign has been develop-

 CROP PROSPECTS I N CHINA AND NORTH VIETNAM
 The regimes in both Peking
 and Hanoi seem to be facing poor
 crop prospects again this year.
 As of early May the outlook
 for the harvest of Communist
 China's winter grains was not
 auspicious,  About half of the
 early grain harvest comes from
 the early rice crop, which seems
 to have been planted under fa-
 vorable conditions.  Nevertheless
 the total early grain harvest is
 unlikely to exceed the mediocre
 level  of  1965,
 China's wheat import re-
 quirements in 1966 will, it is
 estimated, be at least 6 million
 tons--4,5 million of which have
 been purchased.  The tight world
 wheat situation may make it dif-
 ficult for China to procure the
 full 6 million, although a good
 Soviet wheat crop (see next
 article) would ease the situation.
 North Vietnam's spring rice
 crop, which normally constitutes
 about a third of its annual rice
 harvest, does not look good as
 of now.  Sown acreage is below
 normal, and drought, insect
 damage, and the added burden of
 the war effort have had an ad-
 verse effect on production. The
 regime has issued instructions
 to plant subsidiary crops and
 vegetables in areas that were
 to have been sown to rice. The
 success of these e~~forts is

 HARVEST OUTLOOK I N USSR AND EASTERN EUROPE
 In contrast to the poor
 crop prospects in China and North
 Vietnam (see preceding article),
 the outlook in the USSR and East-
 ern Europe is favorable.
 Soviet crop development has
 been helped by an early spring
 in the European USSR and abun-
 dant moisture supplies in the
 major winter grain areas.  Rain
 has retarded spring sowing in
 the New Lands, but sowing in the
 European USSR has proceeded at
 a record pace in these early
 weeks.  Current crop prospects
 suggest that the sizable imports
 of grain required in 1963 and
 1J65 will not be necessary this
 year.
 about two thirds.
 In Eastern Europe, winter
 grain prospects-have improved
 substantially since early March,
 and the outlook for spring-
 planted grains, early vegetables,
 and root crops. is also good,
 Here too, early(sprin~ weather
 and good soil moisture have been
 conducive to timely planting
 and growth of spring crops in
 most countries.  East European
 grain import needs, however,
 are likely to remain near the
 1965 level of 9 mil-lion tons,
 with the free world supplying

 BALKAN COUNTRIES I NCREASE COOPERATION
 The Balkan countries, tra-

 marked strides in regional co-

 that they can coexist with their
 non-Communist neighbors.
 This development also re-

 Trade has increased, new
 transportation arrangements have
 been worked out, and a coardi-
 nated approach to tourism devel-
 oped.  Most Balkan countries
 also have relaxed visa require-

 Greece and Albania recently ne-

 agreement, despite the fact that
 they remain technically at war.
 Cultural exchanges also
 have been stepped up sharply
 over the past year.  Bulgaria

 provided sites for Balkan friend-
 ship meetings, conferences of
 Adriatic scholars, a regional
 film festival, and a Balkan stu-

 raised the lever of its mission

 Given the sharp ideological

 SELF-ASSERTIVE BREZHNEV REAFFi PMS PRIC~R1Tl( ~}F AGRICULTURE
 A continuing priority for
 agriculture was affirmed. by the
 CPSU central committee plenum
 which met in Moscow last week.
 The plenum was chiefly exhorta-
 tive, however, and defined only
 a few new concrete measures to
 improve agriculture.  Soviet
 press treatment of the plenum
 served to underscore Brezhnev's
 pre-eminence and together' with
 his speech demonstrated that he,
 like  Khrushchev,  reg3~rds  agr i-
 culture as his special province.
 Brezhnev was far more self-
 assertive in his speech than
 heretofore.  His manner of Sum-
 ming up the debate and comment-
 ing on the various speeches and
 his frequent use of the personal
 pronoun were suggestive of Khru-
 shchev's style.
 This note of self-confidence
 also appeared in his criticism
 of the Azerbaydzhan and Uzbek
 republic party organizati~ans.
 He also criticized a number of
 industrial ministers for remain-
 ing silent instead of asking to
 report on how they planned to
 implement the plenum's decisions.
 Such criticism suggested that
 there may have been some opgosl-
 tion within the regime to the
 emphasis being given to agricul-
 ture.
 An accelerated program for
 irrigation and Land reclamation
 is now planned after 1970. Total
 improved land area in the USSR
 by 1975 is planned to be 91-96
 million acres as opposed. to 37
 million today.   ,
 Ths current five-year plan
 calls for irrigation and drain-
 ing of 21-24 million acres by
 1970.  It will be difficult for
 the USSR to achieve these goals
 despite Brezhnev's description
 of the program as "minimal" and
 "cautious."
 The ten-year program also
 envisages measures to combat
 erosion, laws on allocation. of
 land for industrial, construc-
 tion, and other purposes, and
 laws on land and water utiliza-
 tion.
 The figures given at the
 plenum for supply of equipment
 to agriculture by 1970 and for
 investment in agriculture dur-
 ing this period are consistent
 with those announced by Brezh-
 nev in March of last year--a
 program which the recent plenum
 endorsed.  Fifteen billion rubles
 have been allocated for land rec-
 lamation  and improvement during
 the next five years.
 The responsibility of de-
 fining measures to implement
 the ten-year goals was left to
 the USSR State Planning Commis-
 sion and to the appropriate
 ministries and scientific bodies
 and republic ;governmental organs.
 These bodies are to submit 10-
 to 15-year proposals for fur-
 thering more rational land use

 SOV[ETS RE-.EVALUATING THINKING ONI NUCLEAR U~AR CONSEQUENCES
 A public re-evaluation of
 military doctrine on the conse-
 quences of nuclear war has been
 initiated by influential Soviet
 military figures.  The focus of
 this critical scrutiny is the
 view--which gained acceptance
 .under Khrushchev--that nuclear
 war is in all circumstances an
 undesirable instrument of na-
 t.ional policy.  The proponents
 of a new look appear to believe
 that current positions limit the
 flexibility of_Soviet_ policy and
 .promote an attitude of defeatism.
 The first entry..in the pub-
 ,lic record:was made ,last fall by
 a medium-rank military expert on
 the .interrelation on-war and
 politics.  He denounced the view
 that nuclear war represents an
 unacceptable strategic option
 anal that it-could not serge as
 an instrument of politics,  He
 argued that to deny the possi-
 bility of victory in such a war
 was incorrect theoretically and
 dangerous politically, leading
 to "moral disarmament...fatalism,
 and passivity,"  These views,
 he contended, also ignored the
 possibility of achieving victory
 when circumstances--such as de-
 velopment of counterweapons--
 would reduce the. unfavorable
 consequences of war.
 More recently Marshal Soko-
 lovsky and Major General Chered-
 nichenko, military strategists
 and strong advocates of nuclear
 weaponry, also cited the-need
 for a further study of strategy
 in order to reinforce the USSR's
 defensive capability.  Although
 the authors recognized anew that
 "unprecedented destruction"
 would result from a world: nuclear
 war, they injected the optimis-
 i;ic view that a surprise-.attack
 on the USSR could be prevented.
 This wiew.was given added.

 23rd Party Congress in April by
 C~eneral? Yepishev  (chief  of .the
 political administration-of.the
 armed forces) caa ling for-in-
 tensified study of the problem
 "of war .anal peace as. connected...
 particularly with the nature-of
 a possible thermonuclear war."~_
 Yepshev scored "incorrect and
 confused" opinions which per-
 mined "extremes" in-the, inter-
 pretation of the possible con-
 sequences of the:use of nuclear
 weapons.  He: concluded that the
 Sovietpeopl!eand-military cadres
 required a bei;ter education "in
 a spirit of optimism, a firm
 belief in their own strength
 and in the inevitable defeat of
 a;ny  aggressor . "
 'It is evident; that one of
 tine   "extremes"  Yepishev  had  in
 mind is the -view that nuclear
 w;~.r  is  too  horrible  to contem-
 paate and that he believes that
 doctrines which rest on this
 a:~sumption  weaken  the  fiber  of
 the Soviet population in general
 acid  that  of  the  Soviet  military
 forces in particular.
 The aim of these military
 si7okesmen seems to be a more
 flexible doctrinal position per-
 mitting the-use. of, ar threats
 to use, Soviet military power to
 achieve national objectives.

 PLANS FOR WEST-EAST GERIViAhI CONTACTS MOVE FORWARD
 Further progress has been
 made in arranging for an exchange
 of speakers between the West Ger-
 man Socialists and the East Ger-
 man Communists.  The two sides
 are agreed on dates, locations,
 and press and television coverage
 for these addresses.  The major
 remaining issue to be settled is
 the matter of "safe conduct" for
 East German participants.
 Representatives of the West
 German Social Democratic party
 (SPD) and the East German Commu-
 nist party (SED) last week set
 14 July as the date for the ap-
 pearance of SPD Chairman Brandt
 and his two deputies before an
 audience at the East German city
 of Chemnitz.  The East German
 representatives--not yet named--
 are scheduled to speak in Hanover
 a week later.
 The problem of "safe con-
 duct" arises from West German
 laws which hold East German lead-
 ers accountable for such actions
 as orders to shoot persons at-
 tempting to flee.  The Communists
 are balking at any temporary im-
 munity and are insi-sting on re-
 peal of West German laws which
 "discriminate against East Ger-
 man citizens."
 A further complicating fac-
 tor is an unexpected invitation
 from SED boss Ulbricht to the
 SPD to secret, high-level talks
 on "disarmament and peace" ques-
 tions.  It is unlikely that the
 East Germans expect an acceptance.
 The invitation may have been is-
 sued simply to sow dissension
 among and within the West German
 parties.
 Meanwhile, the West Berlin
 government is trying again to
 interest the East Germans in re-
 placing the West Berlin pass
 agreement which expires on 30
 June with a long-term, liberal-
 ized pact..  City officials will
 propose a one-year agreement
 covering four holiday visiting
 periods of 16 rather than 14 days
 each as at present.  They also
 will seek approval for visits to
 cemeteries within and just beyond
 the limits of East Berlin, and a
 broadening of the categories of
 those eligible for special hard-
 ship passes,
 Still more ambitious is the
 desire of West Berlin leaders to.
 explore prospects for their cit-
 izens to visit East Germany as
 well as East Berlin.  Alt~iough
 this would pose certain legal
 and jurisdictional problems, US
 officials are willing to go
 along with. a West Berlin attempt
 to deal with the East Germans
 on this matter.
 West Berlin authorities
 probably would settle for con-
 siderably less than they will
 ask.  In previous negotiations,
 the East Germans have taken an
 increasingly tough stand in ne-
 gotiating even short-term ar-
 rangements for the passage of
 West Berliners through the Wall.

 FINLAND'S NEW GOVERNMENT
 Finland's new left-of-cen-
 ter government faces an uncer-
 tain future, even with a three-
 fourths majority in  parliament,
 because of the disparate polit-
 ical interests represented in
 the four-party coalition and the
 lack of agreement on basic eco-
 nomic problems. The government,
 formed on 26 May, is composed of
 the Social Democratic Party (SDP),
 which won a plurality in the
 March elections, plus President
 Kekkonen's Center (Agrarian)
 Party, the Communist-front SKDL
 party, and a Social Democratic
 splinter group.
 The parties are in general
 accord on foreign policy, espe-
 cially the need to maintain
 friendly relations with Moscow.
 However, the farmer-oriented
 Center Party and the labor-ori-
 ented Social Democrats and Com-
 munists have widely divergent
 views on domestic economic is-
 sues that are likely to lead to
 contention in the government. In
 addition, there are factions in
 the Center and Social Democratic
 parties bitterly hostile to the
 Communists and unreconciled to
 cabinet cooperation with them
 After almost two months of
 negotiations, presided over by
 Paasio, formation of the so-
 called "big three" government
 was in doubt up to the last min-
 ute.  The visit this week of
 Secretary Rusk and Premier Ko-
 sygin's scheduled arrival in mid-
 June prompted President Kekkonen
 to press for a speedy solution.
 The Communists, excluded
 from the government since 1948,
 scored a major breakthrough by
 gaining cabinet representation.
 Social Democratic leaders mini-
 mize the risk of their participa-
 tion, maintaining that it is nec-
 essary to make the SKDL share
 responsibility for the hard de-
 cisions which Finland's budgetary
 problems will require.  The SKDL's
 awareness that it is in the gov-
 ernment on sufferance, and the
 fact that it was assigned only
 three minor cabinet posts may
 serve, initially at least, to
 inhibit any disruptive tenden-
 c,ies the party may have.
 The SKDL can be expected to
 use its position in the govern-
 ment to oppose any moves to de-
 velop closer relations with the
 We;~t, such as arrangements be-
 tw~een Finland and the EEC.  It
 ca:n also be expected to advocate
 me~~,sures  at  variance  with  the
 in~Cerests of NATO members Norway
 an~~  Denmark .
 The emergence of the Fin-
 ni:~h Communists as partners in
 th~~ new government will command
 the attention of many Western
 Eu~copean socialist parties whose
 le:~ders are faced with increas-
 in?; defections by their left-
 wing elements.  The most imme-
 di~~te impact may be felt in
 SwE>den,  where there is some
 sentiment to follow the Finnish
 example.

 SENATORIAL ELECTIONS I N TURKEY
 Political circles in Al~kara

 portunity for voters to judge the
 performance of the seven-month-
 old Justice Party (JP) government

 The vote will also test public at-
 titudes toward the obstructionist
 tactics o1' the major opposition
 group, the Republican Peaples Party

 The elections involve a third
 of the 150 elective seats in the

 however, can be expected to use
 any such result t-o claim that the

 Demirel regime, and may even call
 for a new coalition to replace the

 the campaign, the RPP, which has
 shifted from a left-of-center to-

 reiterated earlier veiled warnings

 The Smith regime in Rhodesia,

 MO~~UTU F~JILS PL~QT BY CaN~OLESE POLITICIANS
 Congo moved swiftly and harshly
 against the participants in a
 plot which he and his military
 lieutenants broke up on 30 May.
 One of his aims clearly is to dis-
 courage other would-be plotters,
 but some of the impetus behind.
 his moves seems to come from a
 belief that Belgium, his current
 bete noire, was implicated.
 The army's role confirms that
 although there is some grumbling,
 the upper levels of the officer
 corps still consider that their
 power is derived from Mobutu and
 not vice versa.  As long as the
 their power against Mobutu"s, the
 disruptive opportunities for op-
 ponents of the regime will be
 severely limited.
 The government's pronounce-
 ments claimed from the beginning
 that "foreign embassies" had
 been involved with the plotters.
 The principal suspect apparently
 is the Belgian Embassy, whose
 first secretary was ordered out
 of the country vn 3i May. Press
 reports suggest that Mobutu be-
 lieves the plotters also got:.en-
 couragement from the French.
 _                     ~ What-
 ever the degree of actual Belgian
 involvement, Mobutu is likely to
 believe the worst.  His attitude
 may be reflected in a harder
 Congolese line in the current
 economic talks with Belgium, now
 recessed after two weeks of in-
 conclusive negotiations.

 NORTHERN NIGERIANS REACT VIOLENTLY AGAINST UNITY PLAN
 An outbreak of violent dem-
 onstrations in the main towns of
 northern Nigeria has confronted
 General Ironsi's military regime
 with its first major crisis since
 it assumed power last January.
 The demonstrations were in pro-
 test against recently announced
 plans for a unitary national ad-
 ministration and unified civil
 service.  By exacerbating the
 country's basic ethnic and re-
 g~ional divisions, the disturbances
 ax?e certain to leave lasting psy-
 ckiological scars which will impede
 tYie  regime's  efforts  to  forge  a
 t9-ghter union in Africa's most
 populous nation.
 The demonstrators, mainly
 northern Hausa tribesmen, targeted

 persons, homes, and property of
 Ibo southerners.  Even when north-
 erners dominated Nigeria's power
 structure before the January coup,
 the Muslim Hausa feared domina-
 tion by the better educated
 southerners--espccially the .ag-
 gressive Ibas of Eastern Nigeria.
 Following the coup, they became
 increasingly convinced that the
 Ironsi regime represented Ibo
 domination in thin disguise.
 Some demonstrators distrib-
 uted leaflets protesting the
 military government's reforms
 and calling for secession.  The
 fact that the disturbances oc-
 curred in a large number of
 Hausa-inhabited northern local-
 ities within two days--28 and
 29 liay--indicates some degree
 of coordination, presumably
 provided by northern civil serv-
 ants  and dispossessed political
 leaders.  The greatest violence
 occurred in Kano, where over 60
 persons were killed.  Same af-
 fected towns were still experi-
 encing disturbances as of 1
 June.  So far the south has re-
 mained calm, but as the full
 import of the northern events
 become clear there will be an
 increasing danger of retaliatory
 action against Hausa communities
 there.
 Security forces, with rein-
 forced police elements most
 prominent, have so far been able
 to maintain essential control,
 but they probably would be un-
 able to handle more widespread
 disorders.  Despite threats by
 Ironsi to impose martial law,
 he has avoided as much as pos-
 Bible committing the army to an
 active pacification role because
 of concern that discipline, which
 has seemed uncertain since Jan-
 uary, might break dawn completely.
 In addition to its own tribal
 frictions, the army is especially
 troubled by the internal contro-
 versy surrounding the fate of
 still-detained but unprosecuted
 mutinous younger officers--
 mostly Ibas--who sparked the
 January coup.  In the present
 crisis there evidently has been
 fear that northerner troops
 might refuse to obey or might
 even fire upon their predomi-
 nantly southern officers, partic-
 ularly Ibos.  Should the army
 disintegrate under such pressures,
 a large-scale breakdown of law
 and order would seem inevitable.
 The military government
 belatedly has been trying to
 make its reform plans more pal-
 atable to the north and to work
 with traditional authorities in
 damping down the current unrest.
 Northern Military Governor Kat-
 sina is endeavoring to enlist
 broad support from the area's
 still-powerful emirs and chiefs
 at a special meeting which be-
 gan in Kaduna on 1 June.  How-
 ever, the tensions and tribal
 enmities aroused by -the reforms
 and the disorders will undoubt-

 MEETING ON OAS CHAF;TER REVISION
 A special meeting of the In-
 ter-American Economic and Social
 Council at the expert level will
 begin in Washington on 6 June.
 It will try to harmonize Latin
 American and US views on OAS
 charter amendments dealing with
 economic and social standards.
 Differences center around
 the Latins' desire to see incor-
 porated in the charter very
 specific language which would, in
 effect, obligate the US by treaty
 to provide aid and to take cer-
 tain actions to eliminate trade
 barriers.  The US has informed the
 Latins that although it has no de-
 sire to go back on any of the
 ideals of the Alliance for Prog-
 ress it cannot bind itself by
 treaty to specific amounts of aid
 and it must preserve the preroga-
 tives of Congress with regard to
 appropriating funds.
 The meeting, therefore, will
 be attempting to reconcile two
 draft charter amendment packages.
 The one embodying the Latin Ameri-
 can position was developed at the
 February-March charter amendment
 congress held in Panama.  The
 other, in more general language?
 was developed by the US after the
 Panama meeting.
 The US has presented its
 draft to the individual Latin
 American governments and received
 assurances that they understand
 and are sympathetic with the US
 position.  Although the bulk of
 their objections to the US draft
 can be satisfied by minor changes,
 some basic problems exist.  For
 example, nearly all the Latin
 Americans are insisting on removal
 o:f the sentence of the US draft
 which stipulates that ".nothing
 ...shall be construed as a cornmit-
 m~~nt by any member state to sup-
 p:1y any specific .amount of aid
 to any other member-state or
 grouping of member states."
 Furthermore, Chile., probably
 reflecting the feelings of many
 otther Latin American governments,
 has insisted that the concept of
 solidarity and economic coopera-
 t~ion be stipulated in a form simi-
 lar to that drawn up in Panama.
 However, aS a result of
 Lincoln Gordon's May visit to
 Craile, many substantial differ-
 ences with the US position may
 have been overcome and, at the
 Ju~.ne meeting, Chile and the other
 Latins are expected to be less
 intransigent and to seek to came
 up~ with a draft acceptable to the
 US.

 NEW AMBIENCE 4N CUBA
 Fidel Castro's regime has
 shown unusual sensitivity to in-
 ternational and domestic irri-
 tants since the first of the
 year.  His behavior in connec-
 tion with recent events at the
 US Guantanamo Naval Base is the
 latest and most dramatic instance.
 proach to domestic problems.
 Similarly, the attempted hi-
 jacking of a CUBANA airliner on
 27 March .produced a harsh re-
 sponse.  At least 300 to 400
 GUBANA employees reportedly are
 being replaced because of their
 alleged lack of "revolutionary
 integrity."
 On 2 January, by starting
 a public polemic with Communist
 China over its intent to cuir 1966
 rice shipments to Guba, Castro
 brought the year-long deteriora-
 tion in Sino-Cuban relations to
 a head.  In another evidence of
 frustration anti displeasure at
 international trends,. Guba has
 fulminated on behalf of armed
 revolution during and since the
 January Tri-Continent Conference
 with an intensity not seen since
 1963
 In March and April, Gastro
 launched a bitter propaganda at-
 tack against moderate-leftist
 President Frei of Ghile and in
 early May he renewed old charges
 of "softness" against President
 Tito and the "so-called League
 of Yugoslav Communists."  Cas-
 tro's May Day speech was notable
 largely for its thinly veiled
 anti-Russian barbs.
 Castro's campaign against
 regime "dilettantes and playboys"
 inaugurated in mid-March pro-
 vides the most dramatic example
 of his recent heavy-handed ap-
 The reasons for Castro's
 erratic response to these and.
 other irritants are not readily
 apparent.  High on the list,
 however, probably is his per-
 sonal frustration that after
 seven years of effort his inter-
 national and domestic goals are
 still far from attainment.  At
 the same time, he has found him-
 self under increasing Soviet
 proscriptions which have curbed
 his maneuverability.  The Guan-
 tanamo incidents, in which armed
 Cuban soldiers were discovered
 inside the base, may have been
 provocations designed to divert
 popular attention from Cuba's
 economic difficulties.
 Gastro's charisma has begun
 to fade somewhat, but there are
 no reports of antiregime groups
 operating in the Cuban country-
 side or of plotting within the
 regime.  Continuation. of the
 present climate in Cuba, how-
 ever, could lead to further dis-
 enchantment with the regime.

 VELASCQ CONTINUES EFFORT TO REGAI IN ECUADOREAN PRESIDENCY
 The 28 May convention of fol-

 which Velasco is confident he

 Peru.  Velasco in the past has
 fanned the border question as a
 foreign diversion for Ecuadorean
 nationalism and he may do so
 again.
 Although he has asserted
 that he is "non-Communist,"
 Velasco has come out in favor
 of diplomatic and commercial re-

 and retains a close association
 with pro-Castro extremist Manuel

 URUGUAYAN CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
 Three plans -for -constitu-
 tional reform have been approved
 for submission to the voters in
 Uruguay's November general elec-
 tions.  All three--sponsored re-
 spectively by the ruling Blanco
 Party, the opposition Colorado
 Party, and the Uruguayan Commu-
 nist Party--propose to substitute
 a president for the present weak
 and divided nine-man executive.
 In order to become law, a
 proposal for constitutional re-
 form must be approved by a major-
 ity of those voting, who must
 comprise at least 35 percent of
 the registered electorate.  This
 latter condition is not easy to
 fulfill because voter rolls have
 Page 24
 not peen updated far years.  It
 is statistically demonstrable
 that unless one of the two major
 parties wins a landslide victory
 of nearly two to one--which is
 unlikely--no single plan will get
 the required 7?0,000-add votes.
 Some politicians have proposed
 that voters ensure ado-ption of
 reform by voting yes for more
 than one plan; debate over the
 legality of this procedure has at
 least temporarily diverted pres-
 sure for a bipartisan approach.
 The popular will for reform
 is great, and if it should be

 could be jeopardized.  Only a

 able to overcame the obstacles
 and win approval.  The Colorados,
 however, believing that they are
 likely to win in November and
 can then put through their plan,
 may refuse to compromise.
 In addition to its provi-
 sions for a one-man executive,
 the Colorado plan, which gathered
 an impressive number of sponsor-
 ing signatures, would permit
 state expropriation, without pre-
 payment, of land not being pro-
 ductively employed--an idea which
 is anathema to the Blancos and
 the conservative Ruralist League.
 In addition, it would eliminate
 constitutional provisions which
 ensure bipartisan representation
 on the directorates of Uruguay's
 autonomous agencies.  Many en-
 trenched politicians in both ma-
 jor parties do not wish to do
 away with this system which as-
 sures them patronage privileges
 even when they lose elections.
 Although..they pay lip service to
 reform, their behind-the-scenes
 opposition may well help to kill
 it.
 The Communists--who probably
 originally had not expected to
 obtain enough signatures to put
 their scheme on the ballot--are
 elated at their success.  Party
 leaders hope that in addition to
 helping take votes from the
 B:Lanco and Colorado proposals,
 they can convince at least some
 oi' the 225,000 signers to vote
 for a Communist-backed popular
 front slate.. The US Embassy be-
 l~.eves that unless the two tradi-
 tional parties agree on a biparti-
 s~~n  approach  to  reform  before  No-
 vE~mber, potential voter disil-
 lusionment could result in a
 windfall protest .vote for such
 a front.  Uruguayan politicians
 have not tended to take the Com-
 munist reform plan seriously and
 most scoffed at the thought. it
 would appear on the ballot.  Most
 Uruguayan politicians believe that
 i;raditional parties will always
 control the country and tFuis leads
 them. to discount-the threat of
 Communism.  Many observers in-
 cx?easingly believe that the tradi-
 tional leaders have lost touch
 with Uruguayan political reality.
 As elections near, each of
 tYie two major parties will prob-
 ably increasingly attack fea-
 tures of the-other's proposi-
 tion, thus hardening its own
 si;and and reducing opportunities
 for compromise.  In this atmos-
 phere it is hard to conceive of
 significant numbers of voters
 casting votes for the rival
 palrty's  plan--i.f  this  is  indeed
 lE~gal--and  chances  for  reform

 slim.
