 15 December 1985
 Readers on spies: Hang 'em!
 LAST week in this space I advocated
 the death penalty for spies who
 furnish another country with "vi-
 tal secrets that Imperil this nation's
 security." Judging by response from
 readers, the same thought must have
 been on many of your minds too.
 Only one letter writer disagreed with
 me outright. Another - anonymous, of
 course - called me a racist anti-Semite
 for referring to the recently revealed
 Israel espionage against the United
 States but not to other spy scandals.
 Other letters posed a range of thought-
 ful questions. The rest said, in effect,
 "You're right."
 Here's a sampler of thoee_ responses.
 "No doubt the vast majority of your
 readers will agree with your conclusion
 of what to do about traitors." wrote
 Martin Ulan of Lauderdale Lakes. "But
 Is your definition of treason correct?
 "You wrote, 'Of all the forms of
 betrayal, the deliberate betrayal of one's
 country is the most reprehensible.' OK,
 but what about the German army
 officers who  ttempted to assassinate
 Hitler during [World War IIl? Would
 you hang them -Or a Soviet soldier who
 defects to the Afghan rebels, perhaps
 bringing a plan o . battle? Would you
 take his life? Or a Jane Fonda who goes
 to Hanoi to show her opposition to her
 country's war in Vietnam?
 "Is It always 'my country right or
 wrong'? Is one a terrorist - or a
 freedom fighter?"
 Bernard Adelman of Boca Raton
 writes that his heart says yes to my
 suggestion, but his head says no. "The
 death penalty does not deter traitors,"
 he reasons. "The electrocution of the
 Rosenbergs 30-plus years ago had no
 effect on, for example, the, Walkers.
 "Suppose the Sovf. a . catch, try,
 convict, and electrocute, a, Russian spy
 In our service. Are we to be morally
 Indifferent? Do we approve of their
 killing because they have argued that
 such  treasonous behavior could be
 responsible for untold deaths in the
 future? Do we execute sentences based
 on probable or possible harm?
 "If we are to sentence to death spies
 whose acts' results we can't know with
 certainty," Mr. Adelman asks, "what do
 we do with people like Philip Agee, the
 ex-CIA agent whose disclosure of CIA
 names resulted In the murder of some
 agents? And do we try as accessories all
 those In the book world who had read
 the galleys and didn't delete the names
 of CIA agents, even though the book-
 men should have had the brains to
 foresee the consequences of disclosure?"
 For an opposing view of the deter-
 rence question,  I'll  let W.  Donald
 Stewart of Miami Beach reply to Mr.
 Adelman. Mr. Stewart says that he
 spent 14 years chasing spies for the FBI,
 followed by 10 years (ending in 1975) at
 the Pentagon.
 "The death penalty is a decided
 threat which will lead to the coopera-
 tion of a trapped spy," Mr. Stewart
 opines. "Many years ago, shortly after
 Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were exe-
 cuted - she first because the thought
 was that he'd crack after she was gone
 - when a U.S. spy was interviewed,
 the opening line of the interviewers
 might  well  be,  'Do you  want to
 cooperate or take the Rosenberg route?'
 With that fresh potential, cooperation
 was often forthcoming.... "
 In his eight-page letter, Mr. Stewart
 also worries about the vastly differing
 qualifications required by the myriad
 Government agencies that handle classi-
 fied material. FBI agents are closely
 trained and supervised, he notes, and all
 must have at least a bachelor's degree.
 In contrast,  "three years prior to
 leaving the Pentagon, I was the inspec-
 tor general of the Defense Investigative
 Service," which conducted background
 checks required for Defense Depart-
 ment top-secret clearances.
 "Its investigators ranged from corpo-
 ral to major, and, for the most part,
 when the serviceman completed his
 enlistment, he and what little experi-
 ence he accrued left the  military
 service. Also. because of the large
 volume of work, many of the less-edu-
 cated military personnel 'ghost wrote'
 part  of  their reports."  Instead of
 interviewin  the clearance applicant's
 neighbors, for example, Mr. Stewart
 says that it wasn't uncommon for
 Investigators to copy  names  from
 mailboxes and fabricate interviews with
 them. That can put a sizable hole in any
 spy chaser's net.
 From Ken Leasing of Opa-locka
 comes this: "I have disagreed with you
 frequently  on  a. number  of  other
 matters. However, it is hard to see how
 any right-thinking American could dis.
 agree on this one. This country has
 gotten far too soli."
 Miami lawyer J.B. Spence echoes
 that thought. "I served in the military
 for six years, part-time on submarines
 and four years overseas," he writes.
 "Anyone  who would  spy  on  our
 military should be shot In public at noon
 several times."
 Althou his terse letter doesn't my
 Beller, tM.D., of gather
 Sebastian doesn't agree.
 He writes: "To the spy in the fold, now
 out of the cold, a question to your
 question: 'Like the Rosenbergs?"'
 Dan Schmidt III of Jensen Beach
 terms my proposal "right on - right on
 the noses of those Idiot judges and
 lawyers who deliver these stupid and
 disgraceful sentences for those who sell
 our country's secrets and technologies.
 These individuals should be hanged or
 shot - no prison, no plea bargains, no
 smart-lawyer gobbledygook.,...
 "Send copies [of the column] to your
 congressmen," Mr. Schmidt concludes.
 "Maybe they'll take time out from their
 PACs to read it."
 "Probably I would be considered
 barbaric," muses William V. Sherman of
 Miami, "since I feel that public hanging
 would be suitable. As a GI during some
 of the darkest days of World War Ii, I
 appreciate this great land.
 "Yes, Jim, hang them high."

 Reagan took office in 1981. The Presi-
 dent signed the polygraph order secretly,
 and the order itself remains secret.
 White  House  spokesman  Larry
 Speakes says that the order is limited to
 national-security matters. Yet what per-
 sonal protection do Government offi-
 cials, or the public, have that this new
 directive will be used only to weed out

 overzealous official will not use his new

 Stopping the Spies
 A RASH of spy incidents stirs public
 concern. and for good reason: If
 even one well-placed spy can harm
 the nation's interests, then the potential
 for harm in a whole series of such cases
 is truly disturbing.
 The flurry of spying incidents has
 rekindled interest in various proposed
 remedies. Several are sure to spark
 debate in a humane and open democracy.
 Proposals have surfaced. for instance, to
 impose prior restraints on certain publi-
 cations, to widen polygraph testing of
 Government employees, to increase sur-
 veillance of American radicals, and to
 restore the death penalty for espionage.
 In this debate, the calm counsel of FBI
 Director William Webster is especially
 valuable. Speaking from experience in
 the spy-vs.-spy game, he offers two
 suggestions of particular merit.
 First, as Mr. Webster told a Senate
 committee, the United States ought to
 tighten restrictions on the travel of
 Soviet-bloc diplomats in this country.
 Mr. Webster said that 1,000 or so of the
 2,500 envoys from Communist countries
 engage in espionage and that they're
 showing "increased aggressiveness" of
 late. There's no reason to let them roam
 freely; their countries don't let Ameri-
 cans travel freely there.
 Second, in a recent interview Mr.
 Webster said that far too many Govern.
 ment documents are classified or over-
 classified.  Moreover,  far  too  many
 people have access to them. The result,
 he said, is that persons who routinely
 handle   such   documents become
 "numbed" and grow careless.
 This insight is not new. Congressional
 coihmittees have plunged into the mo-
 rass of Government secrecy and conclud-
 ed the same thing. They reason that it
 less material were classified, its custodi-
 ans could protect it better.
 Yet In seeking remedies for overclas-
 sification, Congress has been frustrated
 by the sheer size of the problem.
 Restricting the movement of Soviet-bloc
 diplomats is child's play in comparison
 with battling the blizzard of Govern-
 ment paperwork. Moreover, the "Top
 Secret" stamps are classifying new
 material faster than overseers possibly
 can monitor.
 If Congress is to heed Mr. Webster's
 sensible suggestion, then, it must consid-
 er bold systemic changes that'll greatly
 reduce the amount of classified material.
 It's a logical approach to theft preven-
 tion - like keeping surplus cheese out
 of the vaults at Fort Knox so that the
 sentries are free to guard the gold.

 g
 wisdom of Mr. Reagan's decision to
 further Chinese purchases of U.S. nucle-
 ar technology, their reservations didn't
 approximate the shrieks sure to greet
 any similar pact with the Soviet Union.
 How times change. Just 12 years ago,
 U.S. leaders were loath to acknowledge
 the  existence  of  the  world's  most
 populous nation. In many Americans'
 eyes, the Chinese were scarcely accredit-
 ed members of the human race, and Mao
 Tse-Tung's anti-West hostility seemed
 far more implacable than that of Leonid
 Brezhnev, his Soviet counterpart.
 The sea change in U.S.-Chinese rela-
 tions is neither miraculous nor mysteri.
 ous. It marks the simple triumph of
 understanding over ignorance. It's a
 pragmatic recognition that even nations
 separated by serious disagreements en-
 joy some mutual interests.
 In recent years, Chinese leader Deng
 Xiaoping has weaned his nation steadily
 away  from  Marxist-Leninist  dogma
 while initiating a series of capitalist-
 inspired  economic  moves.  Yet                              Mr.
 Deng's China remains among the world's

 tions that may arise when lea ers
 seeing to  scern eac of er s ntentions
 rely exclusively  on terse   iplomifi'c
 notes and vague intelligence estimates. Sadly, neither the Administration nor
 the public seem inclined to adopt such
 common sense about the approaching
 summit   meeting  between     President
 Reagan  and   Soviet  Leader    Mikhail
 Gorbachev. Already fraught with unreal-
 istic                                                             expectations,  those  talks seem
 destined to be branded a failure if they
 bequeath anything less dramatic than a
 new nuclear-arms agreement.
 It need not be thus. The low-profile
 U.S.-Chinese meeting provides ample
 evidence  that  ideological  adversaries
 have little to lose and much to gain by
 talking regularly. With a little less
 hoopla and a little more realism. U.S.-
 Soviet relations also might escape their
 zero-sum prison.

 Heed Chamorro
 A NY DISCUSSION of the legality -
 or illegality - of American aid to
 the Nicaraguan rebels is confusing
 because what used to be legal has been
 illegal for almost a year but is likely to
 be legal again soon. Even in this context,
 however, there is no excuse for the
 Reagan Administration's helping to or-
 ganize private American military and
 humanitarian assistance to the rebels.
 Congress made it plain in 1984 that it did
 not want the United States providing
 any type of assistance to the Nicaraguan
 insurgents.
 Both the House and the Senate have
 enacted legislation permitting resump-
 tion of humanitarian aid to the guerrillas
 now. Even so. the 1984 prohibition is
 still the  law.  That prohibition  will
 remain in effect until a congressional
 conference committee irons out differ-
 ences in the two bills and the President
 signs the compromise measure.
 The disclosure by former rebel leader
 Edgar Chamorro that  Administration
 officials involved themselves directly in
 coordinating and encouraging the pri-
 vate aid is most disturbing. The pattern
 is a recurring theme in the struggle
 between the President and Congress on
 who has the last word on what can, or
 cannot, be done in Nicaragua.
 Even in its early years,  when the
 On Nicaragua Aid
 Administration  legally  could  provide
 ~rec  an  m irec  assistance      e
 insur ents, Administration      officials
 flouted the limits im ose       on ress.
 In fact, one of the reasons Con ress cut
 off the aid was t o decision by the
 entra  Intelligence A enc       to mine
 Nicaraguan ports and to provide the
 rebels manuals on how to "neutralize"
 San inista o icia s.
 The issue takes on new importance
 now that both the houses of Congress
 have approved nonmilitary aid to the
 rebels. If Administration officials cir-
 cumvented the will of Congress when all
 assistance was prohibited, can anybody
 trust them to maintain the distinction
 between military and nonmilitary aid?
 Congress should carefully review Mr.
 Chamorro's allegations, detail the exact
 nature of the Administration's violations,
 and bring charges against any officials
 implicated. The Administration must be
 shown that it cannot violate Congress's
 mandates with impunity. Otherwise, its
 past transgressions suggest that those
 violations will continue no matter what
 the law says.

 CIA as Benefactor
 RARELY DO Americans get a favor-
 able peek at the Central Intelli-
 gence Agency (CIA). When the
 CIA does its job right, it is supposed to
 go unnoticed. When things go wrong,
 the  resulting  uproar eclipses public
 appreciation for the agency's dual roles
 of intelligence gathering and covert
 activities.
 As the veil lifted over drought-stricken
 Africa this weekend, however, the CIA
 emerged in the unaccustomed role of
 humanitarian.  About  800    Ethiopian
 Jews,  stranded  in  Sudanese  refugee
 camps  and   hostage  to  Arab-Israeli
 enmity, were airlifted by U.S. planes to
 Israel.
 Secrecy was essential because Suda.
 nese President Gaafar al-Nimeiry's na-
 tion maintains an official state of war
 with Israel. His government had stopped
 an earlier Israeli rescue operation that
 saved several thousands of Ethiopian
 Jews. They had made their-way north
 into the Sudan, fleeing starvation in their
 parched homeland. The CIA had to fake
 European destinations for the refugees in
 order to achieve their departure.
 This operation demonstrated American
 principles at  their  best.  Reportedly
 negotiated directly by Vice President
 George Bush, it applied the considerable
 clout of U.S. economic aid to the Sudan
 to press that government into accepting
 the subterfuge. Then it used American
 resources actually to fly the 800 Ethiopi-
 an Jews to refuge in Israel, the only
 nation in the region that welcomes them.
 - Americans should make no secret of
 their justifiable pride in this successful,
 albeit surreptitious, humanitarian effort.

 Get Smart, CIA
 W ITH a sordid twist here and a
 surreal turn there, the tale of the
 CIA's primer on terrorism con-
 tinues to unravel. CIA Director William
 Casey and his subordinates have been at
 pains to explain away the infamous
 manual on guerilla warfare, prepared for
 the edification of U.S.-backed rebels in
 Nicaragua,  ever  since  its  existence
 became public. Their performance so far
 recalls the old Get Smart! routine in
 which Agent 86, asked to account for his
 latest miscue, tests a series of implausi-
 ble excuses ("Would you believe. . ?")
 before offering a credible explanation.
 First  came  the  denials,  then  the
 protests that the manual's prescription
 for "neutralizing" Nicaraguan officials
 had been misinterpreted, then the disin-
 genuous apologies for the excesses of
 overzealous underlings. Would you be-
 lieve Mr. Casey didn't ' know a thing
 about it? The CIA's congressional over-
 seers remained skeptical, as well they
 should.
 Now, in secret testimony before the
 House Select Committee .on Intelligence,
 CIA officials have offered yet another
 version of the guerrilla-warfare manu-
 al's origins. Acknowledging that the
 contras  have  committed  atrocities
 against hundreds of Nicaraguan civil-
 ians, the agency now insists that the
 manual was intended to moderate the
 rebels' behavior.
 In recent weeks senior CIA officials,
 rebel leaders, and private organizations
 that monitor human-rights abuses in
 Nicaragua have described rebel-instigat-
 ed abuses as horrific as those committed
 at My Lai. Their reports have included
 accounts  about  groups  of  civilians,
 including women and children, who
 were raped, burned, dismembered, blind-
 ed, or beheaded. One rebel official
 testified that the Nicaraguan Democratic
 Force, the largest rebel group, has,,
 documented "several hundred cases" of
 rebel atrocities against civilians.
 Most observers perceive all this as
 another CIA public-relations disaster and
 a powerful argument against renewing,
 American aid to the rebels. To the CIA's
 twisted way of tt.inking, however, it's l
 just another demo.zstration of the need
 for continued U.S. support. Think the
 guerrilla-warfare manual's prescription
 for assassinating elected officials, black-
 mailing ordinary citizens, and arranging
 the "martyrdom" of fellow rebels is
 rough stuff? the agency's argument runs.
 Well, wait and see what the rebels do
 when we're not there to moderate their
 behavior!
 What bilge! It may well be, 'as one
 rebel leader candidly has acknowledged,
 that "it is very difficult to control an
 irregular army," and the Sandinistas
 may well have committed acts equally as
 heinous. But it's insane to imagine that
 either side may hope to win the hearts
 and minds of the Nicaraguan people
 through a campaign of terror, however
 well-disciplined.
 The stabilization of Nicaragua can be
 achieved  only  in  negotiations.  The
 United States ought to expend more of
 its energies on that front and less on
 trying to refine murderous thugs into
 disciplined terrorists.

 Md,42'a  .r._ ' D
 10 December 1981.
 Restrain Casey
 O F COURSE the CIA's manual in-
 structing guerrillas how to assassi-
 nate Nicaraguan officials violated
 Congress's ban against U.S. attempts to
 overthrow the Sandinista regime. That
 conclusion, now reached officially by the
 House Intelligence Committee, is only
 slightly gratifying, since it only' states
 the obvious.
 The committee concludes that the CIA
 murder manual was the product of
 "negligence" by senior CIA officials,
 who should have prevented it but were
 unaware of it. CIA Director William
 Casey acknowledged as much. Having
 concluded the obvious, the committee
 now says that the matter is over.
 It is not over, not by a long shot. As far
 as this murder-manual imbroglio goes,
 Mr. Casey should be held accountable; it
 is yet another example of his negligence.
 Last spring Mr. Casey neglected to
 inform the Senate, as law requires, that
 his agents were mining Nicaragua's
 harbor. He got away with that too.
 This murder-manual scandal is loathe-
 some, but attention should not focus
 excessively upon it. To focus on the
 manual is to focus on the flea; attention
 instead should dwell upon the dog - the
 CIA's "covert" guerilla war against
 Nicaragua.
 On  the  same  day  that Congress
 troubled itself with its dismissive report
 about the murder manual, Mr. Casey's_
 guerrillas ambushed a truck in, Nicara-
 gua and killed 22 civilian coffee pickers.
 This is now the favored tactic employed
 by Mr. Casey's thousands of guerrillas in
 their war against the Sandinistas. In an
 effort to cripple Nicaragua's economy
 further, they attack coffee farms and
 trucks carrying humble coffee pickers.
 They hope thereby to cause an uprising
 that will topple the Sandinistas.
 When leftist guerrillas employ such
 economic warfare to try to topple El
 Salvador's government, America con-
 demns the immorality of the violence
 and can't send enough millions to crush
 the insurgents. Yet in Nicaragua the
 CIA's rightist guerrillas do the same
 thing. and Americans evidently are not
 supposed to object.
 Americans - particularly those in
 Congress. = must object. The United
 States is not at war with Nicaragua.
 Congress ordered Mr. Casey not to try to
 overthrow the Sandinista regime, yet his
 contras clearly are trying. Nicaragua
 alleges that 7,000 of its citizens have
 been killed fighting the contras. If true,
 that is a higher proportion of Nicara-
 gua's population than America lost in
 Vietnam.
 If Nicaraguan exiles mount a war,
 that's their business, but for America to
 underwrite it and train their guerrillas is
 immoral. Mr. Casey did that, a fact that
 the manual merely underscores. He must
 be restrained, and if he again breaks his
 leash, Congress should do all in its
 power to persuade the President to
 remove him.
