 COMMUNIST CHINA'S
 INTERNATIONAL POSTURE
 NOTE
 Chinas return to active diplomacy rniscs new (tueslions'bout the
 direction of its foreign policy. After four hears in which the internal
 preoccupations of the Cultural Revolution thoroughly overshadowed
 foreign relations, Peking is note moving to repair its international
 image and to exploit new opportunities. In attemmpting to estimate how
 China will play this new role in international politics over the next year
 or so, this paper will examine Peking's options in terms of those policy
 factors which are 'most likely( to remain constant and those which are
 subject to greater' variations in response to domestic or external events.
 It must be acknowledged at the outset that ice have remarkably
 little information on. the decision-making processes in Peking. Thus,
 estimates of short-run tactical moves are susceptible to considerable
 error. As in the past, sudden twists and turns in Chinese policies will
 probably continue to sun-prise us. But in the broader perspective of
 lone;-range goals and basic capabilities, this paper attempts to set useful
 guidelines on the course that China is likely/ to follow in adapting to
 the outside world.
 CONCLUSIONS
 A.  With the waning of the radical and frenetic phase of the Cul-
 tural Revolution, Peking has substantially recouped its earlier diplo-
 matic position and is moving to compete for influence in new areas.
 Its successes to (late-due in large part to the receptivity of other nations
 to a more normal relationship with the Chinese-have been impressive,
 especially in areas of secondary importance to Peking. In areas of prime
 concern, i.e., the Soviet Union, the US, Southeast Asia and .Japan,
 progress has been marginal and Peking's policy less sure.

 ?                               is
 B.  Many domestic and foreign obstacles stand in the way of achiev-
 ing Peking's basic goals, whether these be China as a great power and
 leader of the world revolution or as a more traditional but highly na-
 tionalistic country concerned primarily with Asian interests.
 C.  On the domestic side, stability and steady growth in basic ele-
 ments of strength-economic, military, political-are far from assured.
 Even in the best of circumstances, China's marginal economy will serve
 to limit its maneuverability in foreign affairs. A great deal of work
 remains to be done to restore effective government administration,
 and to rebuild a communist party. So long as Mao lives, the possibility
 of disruptive campaigns exist and his death could usher in a period
 of leadership uncertainty and intense preoccupation with internal
 affairs.
 D.  Externally, China's aspirations remain blocked directly or in-
 directly by the realities of the international scene including: the vastly
 superior power and hostility of the USSR, its most immediate threat
 as well as rival for ideological leadership in the Communist world;
 the US presence and US commitments around the periphery of China;
 and the growth in economic strength and self-confidence of another
 traditional rival, Japan.
 E.  Even should the Chinese regime wish to alter its basic foreign
 policy approach and use its growing military force aggressively in
 peripheral areas, its options would be limited by the risk of provoking
 one or another of the superpowers. From Peking's point of view, mili-
 tary adventures in Southeast Asia, against Taiwan, in Korea, or in the
 Soviet Far East would be needlessly risky and the potential prize not
 worth the game. Peking does, however, have room, even in present
 circumstances, for some maneuver directly between the two great
 powers as well as around their flanks or under their guard in South-
 east Asia, the Near East, Africa, and even in Eastern Europe.
 F.  At present, the Chinese see the USSR as their major military
 threat. By accepting negotiations with the Soviets, cooling border
 tensions, and improving their diplomatic image, the Chinese apparently
 judge that: they have reduced the risk of hostilities with the Soviets.
 There is little prospect, however, of a genuine rapprochement emerging
 from the present Sino-Soviet talks. But both sides are apparently
 concerned that their dispute not end in a military test. Thus, as long
 as they both continue to exercise the present degree of military caution,

 there is likely to be some improvement in diplomatic and trade rela-
 tions but little movement in border talks. As long as Mao lives there
 is almost no chance of significant compromise on the ideological
 questions.
 G.  With the US, Peking has moved from its previous intransigence
 to a more flexible approach better designed to exploit the Sino-US re-
 lationship for Chinese purposes. The Chinese hope to unsettle the
 Soviets by playing on their fears of a Sino-American rapprochement
 as well as exploit the potential for changes in the balance of forces
 in ]East Asia resulting from the drawdown of the US military presence.
 In pursuing its new flexibility, however, Peking does not expect an
 early major improvement in Sino-US relations and any small improve-
 ments are likely to be limited to marginal issues.
 H.  Japan poses special problems to Peking because it too is an
 Asian power, is outstripping China in economic growth, and is strongly
 resiistent to Maoist subversion or Chinese threats. And the Chinese,
 who remember Japanese imperialism in China during World War II,
 wonder what threat the Japanese may become to their security over
 the long term and fear Tokyo will one day take on the role of pro-
 tector of Taiwan. The Chinese answer so far has been to continue
 with a rather rigid and vituperative propaganda attack on Japan's
 leaders, their policies, and their alleged ambitions in Asia. While this
 may impress the North Koreans and some people in Southeast Asia,
 it does little good for China's cause in Japan itself. Nonetheless, and
 despite the burgeoning growth in Sino-Japanese trade, any basic shift
 in China's approach to Japan seems unlikely in the present ideological
 climate in Peking.
 I.  In Southeast Asia, Peking's earlier fear that the Indochinese war
 might spill over into China seems to have lessened. Indeed, the Chinese
 seem to believe that the US is being forced gradually to withdraw its
 military presence from the region and that this process will eventually
 improve the prospects for Chinese influence. Rather than use overt
 military force to exploit possible developments in this area, Peking's
 more likely course will be to increase its support to subversive and
 insurgent activity. The Chinese will seek to maintain their role as revo-
 lutionary leaders without exposing themselves to undue cost or risk.
 In addition they will rely on conventional diplomacy when this suits
 their needs. There is abundant evidence that Peking feels no need to

 set deadlines and has no schedule to fulfill; it is clearly prepared for
 the long haul.
 J.  In the longer run, if Mao's successors follow a more steady and
 pragmatic course, they are likely to have greater success than Mao
 in expanding China's political influence and acceptance. We cannot
 be sure, of course, how future leaders will see their situation, and it
 is possible that they will be prepared to employ China's developing
 power in a more aggressive manner. We think it more likely, however,
 that they will continue to focus their foreign policy on diplomacy at
 the overt level and on subversion at the covert level. The open use of
 military force will probably be judged needlessly risky.
 K. While we do not doubt that China would fight tenaciously if
 invaded, we see no compelling factors moving Peking toward a policy
 of expansionism, or even a higher level of risk-taking. For all its verbal
 hostility and latent aggressiveness, neither the present nor the probable
 future leadership is likely to see foreign adventures as a solution to
 China's problems.
 DISCUSSION
 1. FOREIGN POLICY: SOME PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES
 A. The Ideological Base
 1. In part, Peking still perceives the outside world in traditional ways. The
 Sino-centric view of the Middle Kingdom has survived the advent of the com-
 munists. The past century has left a residue of bitterness and frustration among
 those Chinese-certainly the vast majority-whose sense of nationalism and
 patriotism has been outraged by what they see as unfair treatment of China
 by foreigners. This basic sense of injustice and frustration has facilitated the
 people's acceptance of enormous sacrifices and has permitted the communists
 to carry out revolutionary programs aimed at reaching grandiose-often un-
 realistic-goals. While popular expectations have been repeatedly disappointed,
 the basic dynamism of Chinese nationalism remains to be exploited again and
 again. Unlike the ideology of Maoism, which may not long survive its creator,
 the traditional sense of China's privileged role in the world will probably remain
 a constant theme in this and any foreseeable Chinese government.
 2. Maoist ideology, which emphasizes the inevitability of class conflict and
 world revolution, adds an ingredient of violence and militance to traditional
 Chinese drives. It attempts to project the revolutionary experience of the Chi-
 nese civil war onto the world stage by advocating the defeat of the affluent
 Western Powers through the mobilization of the poor countries in the world.

 6. Since China's intervention in the Korean War, which Peking considered
 a defensive move, China's military posture has remained basically cautious
 and prudent:. Moreover, after this experience Peking appeared somewhat, more
 restrained in the use of military threats to further its foreign policy objectives.
 The abortive move against the off-shore islands in 1958 and the defensive
 reinforcement along the Formosa Strait in 1962 both reflected Peking's concern
 over another confrontation with the US. Even against the demonstrably weaker
 power of India, Peking was careful in 1962 not to become embroiled in a lengthy
 campaign. Peking was probably satisfied to make the point that, in spite of
 severe internal difficulties, China was still ready and able to defend itself.
 7. For all Peking's militance in the ideological field, the deployment of China's
 military forces remains basically defensive. Maoist military doctrine emphasizes
 defense in depth and the engagement of the entire civilian population to over-
 come an attack. The fear of a US attack has eased, in part because of a lessening
 concern since 1965-1966 that the Southeast Asian war might spill over into
 China, and is probably lower now than at any other time in the past 20 years. The
 Chinese now view the Soviet Union as posing the most immediate military threat
 and over the past year have been conducting an extensive campaign to prepare
 for the possibility of an eventual war. In accordance with this altered threat,
 there are indications that the Chinese are adjusting their military deployments,
 although there has been no wholesale movement of troops to the northern border.
 8. Even though the main approach to the defense of China still emphasizes
 defense in depth-e.g., Mao's "people's war"-there is more to its military pos-
 ture than a readiness to fight a prolonged, defensive war within China. The
 Peking leadership has clearly given a high priority to acquiring the military
 symbols of a great power, especially strategic weapons, but also conventional
 forces as well. Peking probably wants the strategic weapons primarily. as a de-
 terrent against a Soviet or US attack and to increase Chinese bargaining strength
 on international issues. There is no evidence that the achievement of a strategic
 capability will necessarily make the Chinese more aggressive. They will continue
 to be deterred by overwhelmingly superior US and Soviet power both from out-
 right attacks and from engaging in "nuclear blackmail" in East Asia. China
 wants its views to have impact on the international scene and is willing to ex-
 pend scarce resources to achieve this goal, but it can be expected to continue
 to exercise caution in employing its conventional and nuclear strength. Peking
 expects its political influence in Asia to grow, not from the open use of military
 power, but through active diplomacy and the encouragement and support of
 subversive and revolutionary activities, all backed by the looming presence and
 growing power of immemorial China on the Asian scene.
 C. Domestic Constraints Affecting Foreign Initiatives
 9. In addition to the ideological and military preconditions cited above, do-
 mestic factors determine and often severely restrict the range of foreign policy
 tactics and instrumentalities open to Peking. These domestic constraints operate

 0                               ?
 to limit the economic, psychological, and bureaucratic resources available for
 the conduct of foreign relations.
 10. The Chinese economy during the 1960s did not even approach the high
 sustained growth rates of the 1950s. A combination of factors were responsible
 for this failure-the distorted planning and bizarre management of the Great
 Leap Forward at the end of the 1950s; the cessation of Soviet aid; bad agricul-
 tural. conditions in the early years of the decade; and finally, the disruptions
 of the Cultural Revolution. At the same time, the proportion of resources de-
 voted to the military sector increased, adding to China's technological capabilities,
 but further hobbling development of the civilian economy.
 11. This failure to maintain a high rate of growth in the civilian economy
 limits China's capability to use economic leverage for foreign policy goals.
 China's image in the early 1950s as the economic model for Asia has been
 largely destroyed. The fabled potential of the "China market" has lost much
 of its attraction to world traders, thereby reducing the political concessions
 Peking can exact in exchange for trading privileges.
 12. Policy ineptitude also hinders the Chinese. If Peking's intense preoccupa-
 tion with internal politics had paid off in terms of rapid economic, social, and
 political development, the Chinese might now have a sounder domestic base for
 the conduct of foreign affairs. In fact, the major experiments designed to push
 China ahead, including both the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, have been disasters. Although the economy has largely recovered, party
 organization remains disrupted, civil administration has been hampered, and
 lasting tensions have been created within the leadership as a result of the
 Cultural Revolution.
 13. The foreign policy apparatus proved as vulnerable as other bureaucratic
 organs to the impact of the Cultural Revolution. For nearly three years, the
 formulation and execution of foreign policy were paralyzed by political in-
 fighting. Red Guard activities in embassies abroad and within the foreign min-
 istry itself brought constructive activity to a virtual standstill. All ambassadors
 but one were recalled to Peking, embassy staffs were substantially reduced, and
 militant posturing was offered as a substitute for traditional diplomacy.
 14. This is not to say, of course, that China's presence was not felt in the
 outside world during the Cultural Revolution. Trade and aid programs con-
 tinued, as did support for subversion in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. And
 China's potential as a great power was evident to the world as the development
 of nuclear weapons continued despite domestic turmoil. Nonetheless, it was
 not until 1969 that Chinese ambassadors began to trickle back to their posts,
 and the current campaign to retrieve China's international status and influence
 started in earnest. The return to pre-Cultural Revolution diplomacy has been
 slow and uneven, and the balance between radical and more pragmatic influences
 remains delicate and potentially unstable.

 A. Peking's Activist Foreign Policy
 15. With its foreign affairs apparatus largely restored, Peking is moving
 quickly to recoup its pre-Cultural Revolution diplomatic position and to com-
 pete for influence in new areas. This drive has emphasized peaceful coexistence
 and has sought influence through conventional, diplomatic means. Its successes
 to date-due in large part to the receptivity of other nations to a more normal
 relationship with the Chinese-have been impressive, especially when com-
 pared to the almost total isolation at the height of the Cultural Revolution.
 Most of the gains, however, have come in areas of lesser concern to Peking and
 under circumstances which have made improvement in relations easy and rela-
 tively cheap.
 16. In areas of prime interest to the Chinese, Peking's policy has been less
 sure. Uncertainty and cautious experimentation have been characteristic of
 relations with the Soviet Union, the US, Southeast Asia, and Japan. In these
 areas where policy decisions are more difficult, differences within the leader-
 ship apparently come to the fore and strain the entire decision-making process.
 This was especially marked in the fluctuations of Chinese policy toward the
 USSR during 1969 and the continuing holding operation pursued vis-a-vis the
 Soviets in 1970. Peking's handling of the recent turmoil in Cambodia-and its
 effect on Sino-American relations-also betrayed an initial hesitance which
 underscored the regime's difficulties in formulating policies on major foreign
 issues.
 B. Sino-Soviet Relations
 17. Though some of the immediate danger has been removed from the situa-
 tion, the Sino-Soviet dispute remains the single most important bilateral con-
 cern for Peking. At the same time, it conditions and determines many aspects
 of the Chinese posture in dealing with other Communist states, the Third
 World, and the West.
 18. Although relations between Moscow and Peking had been deteriorating
 markedly over the last decade, and the Soviet troop deployments along the
 Sino-Soviet border had been building since the mid-1960s, the Chinese did not
 appear to take the threat of Soviet military action seriously until after the
 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Even then, Peking sought to deter the Soviets by
 adopting a harshly militant posture, combining provocative behavior on the
 border with strident propaganda and an intensive war preparations campaign.
 Soviet pressure continued to grow in 1969, however, and after bloody clashes on
 the Ussuri in March and in Sinkiang during August, Soviet diplomats began to
 drop broad hints about a possible pre-emptive strike against Chinese nuclear
 and strategic weapons facilities. The Chinese, aware now that they might be
 faced with the choice between backing down and risking their nuclear installa-
 tions, finally agreed in September to the border negotiations which opened
 in Peking October 20.

 9                               ?
 19. The experience of that tense summer moved the Chinese to reassess their
 foreign policy tactics. Far from deterring the Soviets, their militant posture had
 not only raised the possibility of broad conflict with the Soviets to an.unaccept-
 able level, but also deepened Chinese diplomatic isolation. After what was ap-
 parently a prolonged debate early in the fall, the leadership decided that border
 talks offered the most viable means of defusing the dangerously tense situation.
 At the same time, the decision was apparently taken to launch a wide-ranging
 diplomatic campaign to restore China's world status and influence, both as a
 deterrent to the Soviets and in support of Chinese objectives outside the bilateral
 Sino-Soviet framework.
 20. Since the opening of the border talks, there has been no evidence of
 progress on any of the basic issues confronting the negotiators. In spite of the
 stalemate, however, there have been no specific reports of new border clashes,
 which argues that the mere existence of the talks has had some stabilizing effect.
 For their part, the Chinese have demonstrated their concern for maintaining
 the talks at the highest possible level by vigorously resisting any move which
 might lead to their downgrading. The Soviets seem to have conceded this
 point, possibly because of their preoccupation with events in Eastern Europe and
 the Middle East, and a consequent unwillingness for now, to trigger new com-
 plications with China.
 21. Despite the soothing effect of the talks, the border situation remains poten-
 tially explosive. The Soviets have continued their force build up along the border.
 Although the Chinese have not significantly beefed up force levels near the
 border, there is some evidence that they have deployed troops north into areas
 close enough to be readily available in an emergency. They are also trying to
 improve the effectiveness of their paramilitary forces. Chinese civil defense
 campaigns to build air raid shelters, disperse population and stockpile food-
 all of which are useful for domestic political reasons as well-remain in effect.
 22. There have been signs of some slow, halting normalization of state rela-
 tions, although the ideological gulf remains as broad as ever and questions of
 principle and substance are no closer to solution than before. After protracted
 haggling an exchange of ambassadors is in the final stages of arrangement, and
 discussions for the 1970 Sino-Soviet trade protocol have been completed.
 23. The prospect of a genuine rapprochement growing out of the Sino-Soviet
 talks now seems remote. As long as Mao lives there is almost no chance of
 significant compromise on the ideological questions. Peking, seeing no prospect
 of a military advantage over the Soviets, appears committed to the long-term
 process of keeping tensions below the flash point while attempting to pile up
 political points in the communist world by embarrassing the Soviets at every
 opportunity. Even with a continuation of the deep national antagonism and the
 ideological schism, both sides are apparently concerned that the dispute not
 end in a military test. Over the last year both sides have had cause to estimate
 the costs of a prolonged military confrontation, presumably a prospect that
 neither finds particularly advantageous.

 C. The Triangular Relationship: US/USSR/China
 24. The Chinese approach to the US has been strongly affected by their polit-
 ical conflict with the USSR. This was apparent earlier this year when Peking
 moved from its previous intransigence against the US to a more flexible approach
 better designed to exploit the Sino-US relationship for Chinese purposes. The
 primary aim was undoubtedly to unsettle the Soviets by playing on their fears
 of a Sino-US rapprochement. By demonstrating their concern over this possibility,
 the Soviets have probably insured that the Chinese will continue to exploit
 the "triangular relationship" wherever and whenever it suits their needs. Even
 though events in Cambodia caused the Chinese to take a harder line against
 the US, they have clearly maintained the option to return to a more o flexible
 posture when it serves their interest.
 25. The potential for changes in the balance of forces in East Asia resulting
 from the drawdown of US military presence is another factor encouraging more
 flexible Chinese tactics toward the US. The Chinese will hope to speed Ameri-
 can troop withdrawals from the area, especially from Taiwan. At the same time,
 they see possibilities for improving their relations with states now forced to rely
 less on American guarantees. Peking may also hope that it can exert its in-
 fluence to exacerbate frictions caused by a reduction in the US posture. The
 Chinese probably see the US-GRC relationship as particularly vulnerable in
 this respect.
 26. There are no indications that Peking expects to bring about an early,
 major improvement in Sino-US relations. The Chinese probably expect no far-
 reaching Uri concessions on Taiwan, which remains the main test for Peking.
 Nor are they likely to give up the US as the prime target in their ideological
 offensives against the capitalist-imperialist enemy. Nonetheless, Peking will wish
 to maintain sufficient flexibility to exploit the triangular relationship and to move
 promptly in whatever direction offers the maximum benefits.
 27. For these reasons any early improvement in Sino-US relations is likely
 to be limited. For example, although recent US trade concessions have been
 studiously ignored by the Chinese in public, they have privately shown some
 interest in how far the US might move in this direction. While likely to reject
 any formal trading relationship, the Chinese seem ready to accept more subtle,
 indirect trading through third parties. Similarly they are likely to show little
 interest in formal diplomatic recognition so long as the US remains committed
 to the GRC. At the same time, however, they will probably retain an interest
 in keeping lines of communication open through contacts such as those at Warsaw.
 The pace of Chinese gestures will probably be slow and erratic, subject to pres-
 sures felt in Peking from changes in Sino-Soviet and Soviet-US relations.
 28. For some years to come, Sino-Soviet relations will be Peking's major con-
 cern in foreign affairs. Peking has already shown an acute sensitivity to the pos-
 sibility that the US and the USSR might find considerable common ground in
 opposing China. In reaction, Peking will attempt to exacerbate the existing

 ?
 suspicions between Moscow and Washington; will increasingly portray itself
 before the world as the innocent victim of "collusion" between the superpowers;
 and will throw out lines to other Western Powers and the Third World in an
 effort to elicit new support. The more direct solution would be for Peking to
 seek a rapprochement with Moscow, but there seems little likelihood that Mao
 could accept the shifts required to move his regime closer toward the Soviets.
 Thus, over the next few years, or until Mao's death, Peking will probably con-
 centrate on keeping the Sino-US-USSR relationship as fluid as possible in order
 to prevent any alliance against China.
 D. China's Regional Aims
 29. Southeast Asia. Peking's early fears that the Indochinese war might spill
 over into China seems to have lessened in recent years. Even though Peking
 has expressed apprehension that US frustration in Vietnam might lead to further
 escalation, the basic judgment of the Chinese seems to be that the US is bogged
 down in an indecisive effort that is more likely to lead to a withdrawal than
 to further expansion of the fighting. Their confidence in this judgment must
 have been shaken temporarily by the US move into Cambodia, but their calcula-
 tion of the ensuing political costs for the US has probably persuaded them that
 it is still valid. Thus, what we believe to be their long-range estimate probably
 remains unchanged; i.e., in a protracted struggle Hanoi's patience will outlast
 that of the US.
 30. As regards the likelihood of the PLA being sent into Southeast Asia for
 offensive action, the evidence of the past 20 years suggests Peking would be
 inclined in this direction only if China's security is seen as threatened, as on
 the Sino-Korean border in 1950, or if China is provoked, as on the Sino-Indian
 border in 1962. Thus, we continue to believe that China would use its military
 forces to prop up North Vietnam if it appeared that there was a real danger
 of that government collapsing. Similarly, China would no doubt react with the
 PLA, to a direct military threat elsewhere along its southern borders.
 3].. Peking's more likely response-and almost certainly its initial response-
 to aggravation in this area would be to increase its support to subversive and
 insurgent activity. The fact that China continues its long-term improvement of
 its logistic capabilities along this border, including the current road building
 in northern Laos, illustrates Peking's desire to have support facilities ready for
 whatever contingencies may develop. The character of the facilities, operational
 considerations, and recent history all suggest that Chinese plans in this area
 relate to the defense of south China and the assistance of nearby insurgencies
 rather than to a massive push by the PLA into Southeast Asia. The objective,
 as before, would be to bring into existence friendly governments responsive to
 Peking's political influence; and, in Peking's view, this could be done better
 by indirection-including diplomatic pressure-than open aggression.
 322. Thailand and Burma are already targets for a subversive effort. Thailand's
 close ties with the US guarantee China's continuing hostility. Thus far, Peking

 has had little opportunity to apply diplomatic pressure on Bangkok and has
 been relying on a long-tern campaign to encourage insurgency against the gov-
 ernment. There is no suggestion that Peking sees this as an easy task or one that
 can be accomplished quickly even if given a high priority. On the contrary,
 Peking is consistent in advocating local self-reliance and has given little mate-
 rial aid to the active insurgents. Should there be a substantial reduction in the
 US presence in Southeast Asia, the Chinese may combine this low-level activity
 with more positive diplomatic blandishments.
 33. In Burma, Chinese propaganda is encouraging revolutionary activity, sup-
 plemented by small amounts of aid in arms and training to dissident ethnic
 minorities. But diplomatic contacts with this neutralist government have been
 damaged rather than broken. Peking's return to moderation in other areas of
 its diplomacy may eventually be extended to include improved relations with
 Rangoon. Indeed, it now appears that both sides are prepared to resume more
 normal relations. Even so, Peking is not likely to abandon its support of Burma's
 insurgents.
 34. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the Chinese are likely to persist in encouraging
 local revolutionaries, but in these relatively remote areas, significant material
 assistance its unlikely to be provided. The Chinese will continue to find it diffi-
 cult to refuse requests for aid from any source that claims an insurgent or revolu-
 tionary capability, but they will continue to urge self-reliance rather than de-
 pendence on outside aid. Thus, the Chinese will maintain their role as revolu-
 tionary leaders but without exposing themselves to undue cost or risk. There
 is abundant evidence that Peking feels no need to set deadlines and has no
 schedule to fulfill; it is clearly prepared for the long haul.
 35. South Asia. China's interest in India has a relatively low rank on Peking's
 scale of priorities. China is concerned with Sino-Indian border issues, with per-
 sistent rivalries with the Soviets over influence in South Asia, and with demon-
 strating that India is incapable of playing the role of a leading Asian power.
 Toward these ends Peking has sought to embarrass and intimidate New Delhi,
 but without becoming deeply involved in the effort. For instance, Peking has
 propagandized and provided limited arms and training to Naga and Mizo tribes-
 men in eastern India without, however, attempting to turn this into a major
 campaign.
 36. On a. larger scale, Peking's military aid to Pakistan-the major non-com-
 munist recipient of such Chinese aid-was born out of common enmity to India.
 In the process the Pakistanis have become major clients of the Chinese and Peking
 will probably seek to preserve and nurture this relationship even if Sino-Indian
 relations should improve somewhat in the coming years. Tentative feelers between
 Peking and. New Delhi suggest both parties may be ready for a return to con-
 ventional diplomacy. While formal ties may be restored, in line with Peking's
 current effort to bolster its diplomatic image, the relationship will undoubtedly
 remain cautious and cool for some time to come.

 37. The Asian Communists. Peking now seems determined to consolidate the
 currently improved ties with both North Vietnam and North Korea. If only
 because of the primacy of the Sino-Soviet conflict, Peking is likely to go to some
 lengths to improve its relations with Pyongyang and Hanoi, preferably at Moscow's
 expense. The error of pushing Pyongyang and Hanoi, whether ideologically or
 politically, now seems to be clear to Peking and is unlikely to be repeated in
 the same gross forms as during the Cultural Revolution.
 38. China's present call for "militant unity" is probably designed, in the first
 instance, to squeeze out the Soviet Union. It also serves to give the impression
 of a more active role in the "anti-imperialist" struggle than China's cautious
 actions warrant. Indeed, it seems likely that China will continue to tailor its role
 toward propaganda and material support of those on the front lines rather than
 expose itself to greater risk. This apparent effort to write itself belatedly into
 any possible settlement in Indochina, together with its sponsorship of Sihanouk,
 will require careful diplomacy if it is not to alienate Hanoi. Having borne the
 burden of the fighting, the Vietnamese are likely to be especially sensitive to
 any Chinese attempt to dictate strategy or tactics. Currently the Chinese are
 moving with finesse but their natural bent toward chauvinism is nearly as likely
 to erupt against the Vietnamese as against Westerners.
 39. Japan represents a special case for Peking. Because of Japan's remarkable
 economic performance and US encouragement for it to assume a more active
 role in Asia, Peking is showing concern over Japan's potential military power,
 and its possible designs on another Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.
 This concern was heightened last fall by the signing of the Nixon-Sato com-
 munique on the reversion of Okinawa. Peking has always been apprehensive
 over Japan's expanding influence in Asia, particularly in Taiwan, and has taken
 the view that the Nixon-Sato communique signaled a more assertive and direct
 role for the Japanese in the area. Peking's reaction has been marked by indigna-
 tion and by an unsettling conviction that as the US disengages from Asia, Japan
 will fill the void both economically and militarily and will assume the lead role
 in countering China. Adding, to Peking's dilemma is the awareness that its
 political assets and leverage in Japan have markedly dwindled and its image
 has suffered from the extremes of the Cultural Revolution.
 40. Despite its limitations-and past failures-Peking seems to have decided
 to continue on a course of limited meddling in Japan's internal affairs. Peking
 has also launched an intensive propaganda campaign which raises the specter
 of a remilitarized, imperialistic Japan, a foreign policy ploy designed to fan
 traditional Asian fears and to undercut Japanese influence. Moreover, the Chinese
 are attempting to build a case against US-USSR-Japanese "collusion," which
 is also intended to strengthen Peking's hand in its competition for influence in
 Asia. So far this approach has been successful in helping improve China's relations
 with North Korea, but has not had a significant impact on Peking's non-com-
 munist neighbors. Furthermore, the campaign has not been allowed to affect

 materially China's burgeoning trade with Japan, which is expected to reach
 record levels again this year.
 41. Taiwan. The continued existence-indeed thriving-of the Nationalist
 Chinese Government in Taiwan remains a central issue in Chinese foreign policy.
 This symbol of the unfinished revolution remains a highly emotional issue even
 after two decades. The Peking leadership faces the general frustration of knowing
 that they cannot take Taiwan by force, that it will not fall to them by default,
 and that the growing strength of the independence-minded Taiwanese could
 weaken Peking's claim to the island and perpetuate the issue indefinitely. The
 continued recognition of the_GRC by many countries in the world and its presence
 in the UN and other international bodies blocks Peking from full international
 participation and remains a major irritant to the Chinese Communist leadership.
 Finally, the Taiwan issue is a complex obstacle to improved relations with both
 the US and Japan, thus severely limiting Peking's freedom to maneuver on
 international issues.
 42. Korea continues to attract Chinese interest because of the strategic role
 of the peninsula, the quadrilateral competition for influence there, and the
 volatile relationship between the north and the south. Peking has worked as-
 siduously to regain its influence in Pyongyang and has succeeded in reviving
 warm displays of friendship. While attempting to limit the role of the US, USSR,
 and Japan, however, Peking will also seek to limit North Korean adventurism.
 The outlook is for tough political support for Kim II-song's propaganda out-
 bursts combined with quiet restraint on his military excesses to avoid drawing
 China into another military confrontation on the peninsula.
 E. China and the World Community
 43. Where Peking's security interests are not directly engaged, Chinese diplo-
 matic activity over the last year has involved far more tactical flexibility than
 has been shown vis-a-vis the US and the USSR. The face shown the world once
 again broadly resembles that displayed prior to the Cultural Revolution, a care-
 fully nurtured image of reasonableness, but entailing little or no change in long-
 term goals. Sino-Soviet considerations are part of the equation in most of this
 diplomatic activity, and in some cases, notably in Eastern Europe, tend to
 dominate the Chinese approach.
 44. Eastern Europe has become an attractive target for Peking because Soviet
 problems there seem to draw Soviet attention away from China. In addition
 to its close ties with Albania, Peking has been actively cultivating the Rumanians,
 and more recently has shown real flexibility in shelving ideology and improving
 long-frigid relations with Yugoslavia. Ambassadors have returned to Hungary,
 Poland, and East Germany. Peking is clearly preparing for long-term competition
 with the Soviet Union and for this reason alone is likely to give greater attention
 to the East Europeans. Much will of course depend on the subtlety and finesse
 of Peking's approach, but at this point the Chinese have apparently assessed the

 40                               ?
 opportunities as worth pursuing. In this effort as in other diplomatic endeavors
 now underway, Peking will likely recover ground lost during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, and, if it can hold to its new pragmatic diplomacy, achieve some forward
 movement.
 45. Elsewhere in the world, Peking is showing revived interest in fostering
 better relations where the cost is cheap and the opportunities tempting. This
 does not rule out support for revolutionary activity, as is evident in the Near
 East. In contrast to the heavy arms aid from the Soviets to the Arab world, the
 Chinese apparently hope to sway the Arabs by concentrating their aid on the
 fedayeen. This will probably be mainly propaganda on "people's war" with
 some training and small-arms aid. This also serves to keep the pot boiling and
 the Soviets distracted. But while denouncing the ceasefire as an American-
 instigated "Munich" and declaring strong support for the fedayeen in the Jor-
 danian crisis, the Chinese have carefully refrained from attacks on the Arab
 governments involved, apparently unwilling to compromise future state relations
 in the area.
 46. In Africa, the Chinese will be concerned to restore diplomatic losses to
 the GRC in recent years. This will require more professional diplomacy and less
 proselytizing. Indeed, China's Foreign Ministry already seems to have accepted
 this retreat from Maoist missionary work. For the most part, aid projects are
 likely to remain modest but with special efforts to make them practical and
 highly visible. The construction of the $400 million Tanzania-Zambia rail line
 appears to be China's prestige project for Africa; the Chinese apparently also
 hope, through the provision of military aid, to convert Tanzania into a major
 beachhead in Africa.
 47. In an effort which may be intended mainly to spotlight Peking's return
 to the world scene, the Chinese have also been displaying unprecedented in-
 terest in UN membership. In earlier years, Peking put preconditions on its mem-
 bership which were clearly unacceptable to the international body. More recently,
 Chinese officials have dropped their extreme demands and have sent out a
 number of cautious feelers for support in the UN. Whereas Chinese diplomats
 formerly spurned such support, now they go out of their way to express appre-
 ciation for it. Despite all of this activity, Peking has not softened its opposition
 to any "two-China" formulation, and has continued to make it clear that the
 GRC must either withdraw or be dismissed before Peking would accept UN
 membership. Widened diplomatic recognition of Peking, such as by Canada and
 Italy, is steadily improving the chances for its admission to the UN; such an
 outcome seems likely within the next few years.
 48. In general, and barring the contingency of military attack by the USSR,
 China's future international posture is likely to depend more on Chinese internal
 developments than on external factors. If domestic political and economic
 problems accumulate, so will the pressure to give them even higher priority,

 with a concomitant lessening in foreign interests. Mao Tse-tung remains the key
 variable. So long as he retains his dominance within the leadership, Mao could
 attempt to reverse the present relatively moderate trends. In the past, his
 impatience has grown as his goals for China have been frustrated by economic
 reality and recalcitrant human nature. His ability to retreat and consolidate is
 still evident, but it is questionable whether his age and health will permit
 another major push toward his visionary aims. In any event, despite his deep
 concern over the ideological conflict with the Soviets, Mao's attention is likely
 to remain primarily on developments within China. Nor is he likely to abandon
 his caution and risk the destruction of China by provocative moves against either
 the US or the USSR.
 49. Mao's death during this period could create succession problems that could
 give Peking reason to project a low posture on the international scene for some
 time. Almost any foreseeable combination of successors-even presumably hard-
 core Maoists like Lin Piao, the designated successor-would probably play for
 time to consolidate their positions and to strengthen China to meet possible
 challenges. In the longer run, as those who follow Mao face up to the needs of
 China, the trend is likely to be away from the ideological excesses of Maoism
 toward a more realistic adjustment to the difficulties-as well as the opportu-
 nities-facing China. Indeed, if the successors persist in the present movement
 toward greater flexibility and pragmatism, they are likely to have greater suc-
 cess than Mao in expanding China's political influence abroad. And for the longer
 run, China's traditional ethnocentrism will continue to fuel an assertive and
 potentially aggressive nationalism.
 50. Presumably they will continue to focus their foreign policy on diplomacy
 at the overt level and on subversion and insurrection at the covert level. This
 could include "war by proxy" as well as efforts to exacerbate US relations with
 its Asian allies and to exploit internal tension within these countries. We can-
 not be sure, of course, how future leaders will see their situation, and it is pos-
 sible that they will be prepared to employ China's developing power in a
 more aggressive manner. It now seems likely, however, that the open and offen-
 sive use of military power will continue to be judged needlessly risky and
 therefore counterproductive. Even the development of an operational strategic
 weapons system may reinforce Chinese caution rather than encourage a more
 reckless policy. While we do not doubt that China would fight tenaciously if
 invaded, or if threatened directly with invasion, we see no compelling factors
 moving Peking toward a policy of expansionism, or even a higher level of risk-
 taking. For all its verbal hostility and latent aggressiveness, neither the present
 nor the probable future leadership is likely to see foreign adventures as a solu-
 tion to China's problems.
