CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN 
18 December 1958 
DAILY BRIEF 
/ 
L THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
*USSR: Khrushchev's denunciation of the "anti-patty" group 
in his 15 December agricultural report to the central com-
mittee, the strongest attack in recent months, is probably in-
tended to insure support on the eve of the party congress by 
Intimidating anyone tempted to question his policies. The 
nature of the attack suggests further action against the "anti-
party group;' possibly exclusion from the party or dismissal 
from present posts. (Page 1) 
*USSR: Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan, long the 
principal adviser in the Kremlin on foreign trade matters and 
probably one of Khrushchev's closest collaborators, has re-
quested a visa to visit the United States. He plans to arrive 
early in January as a "guest" of the Soviet ambassador in 
Washington. Mikoyan's purpose in attempting to come to 
Washington as an "unofficial visitor" at this time--just prior 
to the party congress which opens in Moscow on 29 January--
is probably to explore at first hand US views on the broad is-
sues Ehrushchev has attempted to connect with a settlement 
of the Berlin problem. 
Communist China: Peiping's official communique on 
Mao's decision to OA up his largely ceremonial post as head 
of the Chinese Communist government is a vote of confidence 
in his leadership and intended to refute allegations that he is 
losing power. The communique implies that he will continue 
to dominate the regime and strongly endorses both the com-
mune program and the economic "leap forward." It calls for 
further remarkable production increases next year.

Watch Committee conclusion�Berlin: There is no assur-
ance that the USSR will wait for the full six months' period 
mentioned in the Soviet note of 27 November before transfer-
ring to the East Germans control over Allied traffic to Berlin 
or undertaking harassment of some other sort. Current Soviet 
efforts in the Berlin situation appear directed primarily toward 
forcing counterproposals and negotiations with the West. 
Watch Committee conclusion�Taiwan Strait: The Chinese 
Communists do not appear to intend, in the immediate future, 
to terminate the self-imposed restriction against interference 
with resupply of the offshore islands on alternate days.  
IL ASIA-AFRICA 
Watch Committee conclusion�Middle East: A deliberate 
initiation of large-scale hostilities in the Middle East is un-
likely in the immediate future, although the situation remains 
unstable throughout the area. Increased Communist activity 
in Iraq has kept the situation precarious. While the recently 
planned coup was thwarted, the possibility exists that pro-UAR 
groups or army elements acting independently may at any time 
attempt to overthrow or modify the regime. The Israeli-Syrian 
border situation continues to be tense, and Israeli retaliatory 
raids into Syria will probably occur if there are additional se-
rious border incidents.: 
Iraq: Prime Minister Qasim appeared tense during his 
Interview with Assistant Secretary Rountree on 16 December, 
and harped on the theme that "many Iraqis" believe the United 
States is conspiring against his regime. Although he reiterated 
his desire for friendship with the United States "as with all 
other countries," Qasim gave no indication he intends to make  
any specific move to improve relations with the West.

Nationalist China - Burma: Chinese Nationalist irreg-
ulars in the Thai--Laos-Burmese border area may be prepar-
ing to step up their activities, possibly including attacks on 
Chinese Communist border villages. 
oi 
the irregulars are 
constructing two airfields on Burmese territory. Reports 
persist of periodic supply drops from Taiwan. A resurgence 
of Chinese Nationalist activity would complicate the Ne Win 
regime's relations with Peiping and distract the Burmese 
Army from carrying out its announced intention of suppr 
the Communist insurgents during the present dry season 
(Page 3) 
Lebanon: Strong army action last week against former 
rebel elements in the Biqa Valley, following the killing of an 
army officer and two men, is likely to arouse a storm of Sunni 
Moslem criticism against the government, which tried unsuc-
cessfully to suppress news of the action. Karami, who is 
Defense Minister as well as Prime Minister, may attempt to 
shift the blame to Minister of Interior Edde and President 
Shihab, and Sunni attacks could lead to severe dissension with 
in the cabinet. (Page 4) 
� South Korea: The Rhee administration seems determined 
to enact laws which could drastically reduce South Korea's al-
ready limited political liberties. Despite the unfavorable im-
pact the measures would have externally, Rhee apparently is 
convinced that the opposition must be muzzled to prevent it 
from winning the 1960 presidential election.

In THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Khrushchev Attacks "Anti-Party Group" 
Khrushchev's condemnation of the "anti-party group" in 
his 15 December agricultural report to the central commit-
tee is the strongest attack on the group since the initial re-
action in July 1957. The American Embassy in Moscow 
doubts that Khrushchev is facing actual opposition, but con-
siders it likely that his programs have antagonized a num-
ber of highly placed individuals. His denunciation of the 
anti-party group could be intended to intimidate such oppq-
nents. 
Khrushchev accuses the "despicable" anti-party group 
of having manifested a wrong attitude toward the peasantry 
and of opposing nearly every major agricultural policy 
sponsored by him since Stalin died. He charges Molotov 
and Malenkov, specifically, with mistakes and dishonest 
juggling of figures during the Stalin era. 
The nature of the attack on the anti-party group sug-
gests the possiblity of further action against them. Khru-
shchev's statement that "The tongue refuses to call such 
people 'comrades,' even though they have remained mem-
bers of the party" could be an invitation to the central cwa-
mittee to oust them from the party. They might also be 
dismissed from their present4posts. The Embassy doubts 
that Khrushchev will go solar as a purge trial unless his 
situation is actually precarious;  all present evidence in-
dicates he is firmly in control.

Peiping Communiqu�n Central Committee Plenum 
The communiqu�ssued by Peiping on 17 December on the 
work of the recent central committee plenum at Wuhan formal-
izes Mao Tse-tung's decision to step down as chairman of the 
government and appears designed to refute Chinese Nationalist 
allegations that he is losing power. 
The communiqu�oted that the decision will not affect 
Mao's "continued leading role in the work of the state," and 
pointed out that Mao can be re-elected chairman of the govern-
ment if some "special situation" should arise. 
The session gave a resounding vote of confident to Mao on 
two policies closely associated with him--the communes and the 
"giant leap forward"--over which there have been hints of oppo-
sition. It placed a "very high evaluation" on the communes and 
gave local party units until next April to consolidate them. 
The session gave its stamp of approval to the high produc-
tion claims advanced in connection with the 1958 "giant leap"--
claims which at least in the agricultural field are seldom credited 
outside the bloc. Even greater triumphs are now being promised 
for 1959, with the session urging the nation to "go all out, aim 
high, and defy difficulties." Production increases in certain 
commodities scheduled by the session, while only about half as 
great as those claimed this year, are still highly ambitious. 
The Taiwan situation was played down, with no mention of 
the offshore islands, and only a generalized prophecy that US 
forces will be driven from Taiwan "eventually" when Commu-
nists and Nationalists "unite."

II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Chinese Nationalist Irregular Activity in Burma Border 
Area 
as of 
late November Chinese Nationalist irregulars in Burma 
were building two airfields on Burmese territory which 
were expected to be operational some time in January. 
 4irfield construction could be designed for 
a logistic build-up which would permit the estimated 6,000 
irregulars in the Burma-Laos-Thailand border area to ac-
celerate raids against Chinese Communist villages. Sev-
eral Chinese villages were raided by bands of Chinese Na-
tionalist irregulars last summer, and the raiders' success 
may have encouraged Taipei to urge a more ambitious pro-
gram. 
Chinese Nationalist authorities on Taiwan have shown 
a revived interest in the potentialities of the irregulars dur-
ing the past year and are believed to have flown several sup-
ply missions to the Burma border area during that period.  
last summer's border raids were credited to the 
orders of a Chinese Nationalist colonel who had recently ar-
rived from Taipei, allegedly to take over command of the ir-
regulars. 
Intensified guerrilla activity by Burma-based Chinese 
Nationalist irregulars might complicate Rangoon's uncertain 
relations with Peiping and give the Chinese Communists an 
excuse to put pressure on the Ne Win regime. Preoccupa-
tion with a resurgence of Chinese Nationalist activity might 
also distract the Burmese Army from carrying out its an-
nounced intention of suppressing the Communist insurgents.

'Novi "�Flog. 
Moslem Feuding May Cause Lebanese Cabinet Crisis  
The Lebanese Army's strong action last week end against 
former rebel Sunni Moslem villagers in the Biqa Valley is 
likely to arouse a storm of Sunni Moslem criticism against 
the government. Sunni Moslems killed an army officer seek-
ing to end a fight between Sunni and Shia Moslem villagers. 
The army in reprisal destroyed the Sunni village, causing a 
large number of Sunni casualties. 
News of the attack, which the army tried to keep out of 
the press, stirred violent popular reaction in the Basta quarter 
of Beirut, and large-scale demonstrations on 15 December 
were averted only by pressure from higher Moslem leaders. 
Shia Moslem tribesmen employed in coastal areas left abruptly 
for the Biqa around 12 December on the orders of their leader. 
This move may be connected with the prevailing Shia-Sunni 
tension and could lead to further clashes. 
Apparently, the army action was taken without the knowledge 
of Sunni Moslem Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Karami, 
but with the approval of President Shihab. This action has al-
ready resulted in an attack on the government by former rebel 
leader Abdullah Yafi and adverse press comment. Karami 
may .,attempt to shift the blame toz the Christian minister of 
Interior, Raymond Edde, which could cause serious dissension 
in the cabinet. 
The army action was sterner than any taken during the civil 
war last summer. The fact that Arsal, the village attacked, was 
a stronghold of former rebel sympathizers adds to the politicians' 
difficulty. The surviving inhabitants are said to have fled to Syria.

President _Rhee, Moves To Suppress Opposition  
The South Korean Government is engaged in a major 
struggle with the opposition Democratic party in the Nation-
al Assembly to force passage of revisions of the national 
security law and the local autonomy law. These government-
inspired measures appear to be designed to silence growing 
political opposition by abridging the already limited civil 
liberties and press freedom in order to prevent an adminis-
tration defeat in the 1960 presidential election. 
The Democrats and a wide segment of the press are 
critical of the loose definition of espionage in the revised 
version of the security law and object to the provision for 
penalizing anyone who has "benefited the enemy" by spread-
ing "false facts or distorted news." This latter proviso 
would permit stringent press controls. Proponents of the 
measure claim that its enactment is necessary to combat 
Communist activities and maintain domestic order. 
The planned revision of the local autonomy law would 
provide for governmental appointment rather than election 
of local executives in towns and cities. The Democrats have 
been engaged in a well-organized campaign to win control of 
the cities. 
Rising opposition at home and fear of losing American 
support may induce the government to tone down the most 
offensive parts of the proposed bills before pushing them 
through the assembly. However, in an effort to muffle op-
position, the government already has suspended some rights 
of public assembly in Seoul and has organized an anti-Commu-
nist Fighting Committee to drum up local support for the re-
visions.

III. THE WEST 
West Berlin Mayor Raises Question of a Free City 
For All of Berlin 
West Berlin's Mayor Willy Brandt has again publicly 
raised the possibility of including all of Berlin in a "free city." 
In an interview with a West German paper, Brandt said that 
while he opposed this idea as economically not viable, he 
would view it in a "different light" if Moscow would agree to 
the creation of an extraterritorial corridor between Berlin 
and West Germany. In the same interview he said that a UN-
supervised plebiscite in all parts of Berlin would be an ac-
ceptable way of determining the city's status. Brandt repeated 
the idea of a plebiscite to French reporters on 15 December. 
In an interview with a Munich paper on 5 December, 
Brandt commented that the possibility of making all Berlin 
a "free city" might be acceptable "in principle" in case of 
an "emergency" situation. He followed up this interview 
with a suggestion for a Berlin corridor in statements to a 
Danish paper on 9 December. Neither of the original inter-
views provoked much public reaction in West Germany. 
Since Brandt and Adenauer still differ to some extent 
over whether to seek broad negotiations on Germany, Brandt 
may be seeking to elicit a new proposal from Moscow to in-
clude East Berlin in the free city, which could then be used as 
the basis for high-level East-West talks on Berlin and linked 
to the entire German question. His references to a corridor 
and plebistite3, however, suggest that he may also hope to draw 
a Soviet rejection which could be used to put the USSR on the 
defensive.
