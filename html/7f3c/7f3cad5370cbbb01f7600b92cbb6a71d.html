 Iran renewed its attack in the m
 Al Qurnah yesterdav, and both sid
 arsh east of Al Uzayr and
 es stepped up airstrikes against
 each other's cities.
 The Iraqis are finding it difficult to drive the Iranians out of the
 marsh
 Although Iraqi forces are
 confident they will be successful, they want to defeat the Iranians at
 Al Basrah quick) because they expect a malor a
 ttack near Mandali
 within two days ~

 25X1
 the Iranians are
 15 to 20 kilometers inside Iraq northeast of Al Basrah, but they have
 not been able to take the highway between Al Basrah and Al Amarah.
 Both sides continue to mount air raids on urban populations. On
 Saturday alone, the Iranians claimed they conducted airstrikes on
 eight cities
 Meanwhile, the US destroyer Lawrence yesterday fired warning
 shots at an Iranian frigate, a P-3 reconnaissance aircraft, and a dhow
 in the Strait of Hormuz when they failed to respond to warnings to
 veer off.
 Comment: The Iraqis probably have sufficient forces at Mandali
 to counter an Iranian attack, unless it is far stronger than the assaults
 of recent weeks. Iraq has not yet used its reserve forces and will
 continue to hold them ready for the main Iranian offensive. The
 increasing attacks on urban areas heighten the threat of Iraqi attacks
 on Iranian economic targets in the Persian Gulf.
 The Lawrence sustained no damage. It is unlikely the approaching
 craft intended to inflict any.

 CHINA-US: Leaders Discuss US Policy
 Chinese officials aired their concerns over US foreign policy in
 frank and sometimes heated exchanges with a former senior US
 officer last week.
 The US Embassy in Beijing reports that party leader Deng
 Xiaoping tied China's more independent stance in foreign policy to
 what China views as a shift in US policy after 1980, primarily
 concerning Taiwan and the Third World. Deng accused the US of
 reviving the hardline "Dulles" doctrine and of abusing its power.
 Premier Zhao said, however, that China now believes good
 relations with the US have an "extremely important" strategic
 significance. He added that he looked forward to stable relations but
 complained that the US regards China as a junior partner. Zhao
 expressed frustration that US domestic legal and political
 considerations took precedence in solving problems with China.
 The Premier expressed support for the US effort to "correct the
 balance" in military power against the USSR. Zhao nonetheless called
 for the US to relax tensions with the Soviets in Europe and to
 conclude a disarmament agreement. Deng indicated that China
 believes the Soviets under General Secretary Chernenko will be more
 rigid and less able to make important decisions.
 Comment: These comments reflect the ambivalence of Chinese
 leaders about US policy. Nevertheless, they want to continue the
 recent trend toward better ties as they prepare for President
 Reagan's visit in April.
 .The Chinese regard the US as a strategic counterweight to Soviet
 military power, but they believe that some US policies alienate
 opponents of the Soviets, especially in Europe and the Third World.
 The Chinese also are concerned that what they view as the success of
 the US in redressing the balance of power with the USSR may cause
 the US increasingly to discount China's strategic contribution.
 In addition, the Chinese are emphasizing their extreme sensitivity
 to China's status in US-Chinese relations. They continue to express
 the fundamental importance of the Taiwan issue.

 USSR-WEST GERMANY: Acquisition of Antiaircraft Gun
 A West German Gepard self-Dr o elled antiaircraft gun has been
 identified                        the Soviet artillery test range at
 Donguz. Canvas-covered equipment with the configuration and
 measurements of the Gepard was there as early as April 1982. The
 Gepard has twin 35-mm cannons with a range of up to 4,000 meters
 and advanced search and target-tracking radars. It was fielded in
 1976.
 Comment: The Soviets probably have exploited some of the
 Gepard's features-particularly its advanced radar-for a successor
 to their aging ZSU-23/4 self-propelled antiaircraft gun. An early
 version of the new Soviet gun, reportedly with 30-mm cannons, was in
 developmental testing in 1978. The Soviets may have obtained the
 Gepard from a company involved in the manufacture of the system in
 West Germany or possibly from a third country that may have bought

 SOMALIA: Military Concerns
 President Siad and his senior advisers are increasingly concerned
 about declining morale and discipline in the Army
 The problems-highlighted by the
 recent mutiny o a frontline unit-reportedly stem from inadequate
 logistic support, severe equipment shortages, and the Army's failure
 to rotate troops from frontline positions.
 troop morale is so poor that commanders would be unable to rally
 their units to engage any formidable Ethiopian force. Siad, in a recent
 meeting with the US Ambassador, criticized the current level, of US
 economic and military support and requested additional aid.
 Comment: The current military deficiencies are largely
 attributable to assigning higher priority to obtaining new weapons
 rather than seeking to improve training, maintenance, and logistics.
 Siad will intensify his complaints in order to try to obtain heavy
 weapons from the US. He also may see his recent flirtation with the
 USSR as a way of prodding the US. Moscow's commitment to
 Ethiopia and Soviet antipathy toward Siad, however, leave him little
 room to maneuver

 TAIWAN: Premier's Health Worsens
 The ruling Kuomintang is likely to groom another successor to
 President Chiang following a relapse in the health of Premier Sun
 Yun-hsuan. The Premier, a leading Kuomintang moderate, underwent
 surgery yesterday for cerebral hemorrhage. Sun, 70, suffered a heart
 Comment: Sun's chances for a full recovery are small. Sun has
 not been viewed as a strong leader, and even if he survives and
 returns to work, the Kuomintang probably will seek a potential
 successor with better health and greater political skills to head the
 post-Chiang collective leadership. Vice-presidential nominee Li Teng-

 PANAMA: Opposition Candidate's Conditions
 Defense Forces Commander Noriega apparently has failed to
 reach an accommodation with opposition presidential candidate
 Arias, who used a recent meeting with Noriega to spell out his attitude
 toward the military if he is elected.
 the 82-year-old former President informed
 Noriega that he would be allowed to remain as head of the military.
 Arias indicated he would not seek to remove senior officers on his
 own, but he said police investigatory functions would have to be
 returned to civilian control and the law changed to underscore the
 president's role as commander in chief. Arias also indicated that the
 lavish lifestyles of some senior military officers would not be tolerated.
 Comment: Arias's apparent dictation of terms to Noriega will only
 reinforce the military's desire to prevent Arias from becoming
 president again. Although Noriega ostensibly will move ahead with
 plans to hold the election in May, he also probably will be looking for
 ways either to postpone it or rig the results. If Arias were to win,
 Noriega would be likely to take preemptive measures against him
 before he took office in October.
 COLOMBIA: Drug Control Efforts
 The director of the Colombian National Police recently told US
 Embassy officials that Bogota plans to investigate the effectiveness of
 a herbicide spray campaign against marijuana and coca plants. The
 Embassy believes the effort could start as early as late March. Small-
 scale tests in preparation for actual spraying took place last week in
 an isolated area outside Bogota. In 1983 Colombia produced an
 estimated 13,500 metric tons of marijuana and enough coca to supply
 20 percent of the cocaine consumed in the US.
 Comment: Last fall Colombian officials visited Mexico to study a
 similar eradication program that has been effective against opium
 poppy, and, to a lesser extent, against marijuana. Bogota's
 willingness to pursue such a course suggests a marked departure
 from its earlier ambivalent attitudes toward curbing production of
 marijuana and coca. Implementation of a test program, however,
 would be a controversial step for the government. It probably will not
 be launched until after the midterm departmental and municipal
 elections next month, in order to avoid creating a major campaign

 LEBANON: Palestinians Try for a Comeback
 Top Secret
 Palestinian forces representing most factions are moving back into
 Lebanon and taking part in the fighting against the government. The
 Druze, Shias, and Israelis are trying with some success to constrain
 the ability of the Palestinians to set up an independent operation in
 Lebanon. Nevertheless, the Palestinian presence in Beirut and in the
 Shuf probably will increase, creating frictions with Druze and Shia
 forces in the area.
 A return to Lebanon is a primary objective of both the Syrian-
 backed Palestinian rebels and those who remain loyal to PLO chief
 Arafat. Both groups believe that the chaos in Lebanon eventually will
 permit them to recreate an independent base of operations there.
 Arafat's supporters are eager to reestablish themselves in a state
 bordering Israel, while the rebels believe that having an enclave
 outside Syrian-occupied territory will give them some independence
 from Damascus. All PLO factions want to regain control of the refugee
 camps in Beirut, in order to protect Palestinians in them from possible
 attacks by Christians, Shias, or Druze.
 The Palestinian Presence
 There may be up to several thousand Palestinian fighters in the
 Shuf, the Matn region, and in Beirut. Most of them belong to the pro-
 Syrian rebel factions, but some are still loyal to Arafat.
 An additional 3,000 to 4,000 Palestinian fighters are still around
 Tripoli and in the Bekaa Valley. They will continue to try to infiltrate
 into Beirut and the Shuf.
 Those loyal to Arafat will have the most difficulty because they
 cannot move freely through Syrian-controlled territory. The loyalists
 may be able to augment their numbers, however, by recruiting from
 the largely pro-Arafat Palestinian refugee population in the region. At
 least 50,000 civilian Palestinians evidently reside in Beirut itself.
 Palestinian fighters began returning to the Beirut area and to the
 Shuf during the fighting last September, joining several hundred who
 remained in Beirut after the evacuation of 1982. Other Palestinian
 positions extend from Ad Damur to Al Muruj in the northern Main.
 Organized PLO forces so far have not been detected south of the
 Ad Damur area.

 Top Secret
 A large number of the Palestinian forces belong to the
 Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular
 Front for the Liberation of Palestine-the two PLO organizations that           25X1
 remained essentially neutral during the conflict last year
 The pro-Syrian groups apparently lack a unified leadership and
 are prone to squabbling. They have fought alongside both the Shias
 and the Druze in the Shuf. On the other hand, Arafat's backers who
 have returned to the Beirut area have stayed out of the fighting and
 are trying to rebuild their organizational structure in West Beirut.
 Restraints on the Palestinians
 There is little chance the Palestinians will regain the degree of
 independence they enjoyed during the 1970s. The Druze, the Shias,
 and the Israelis all have an interest in preventing a Palestinian
 resurgence in Lebanon, and they will constrain the Palestinians'
 numbers and activities.
 The Druze and the Shias accept Palestinian assistance in the
 fighting, but they insist on keeping the upper hand in their area of
 control. Druze leader Junblatt and Shia leader Bard have issued
 orders prohibiting further Palestinian infiltration into West Beirut.
 Their efforts have prevented large units from moving in, although
 small groups continue to make their way into the city.
 Israel is determined to block the return of PLO forces south of the
 Damur River. Tel Aviv has made it clear to the Druze that its
 willingness to allow them freedom of action depends on their ability to
 Recent airstrikes in the areas of Hammana, Bhamdun, and
 Ad Damur, where Palestinian forces are located, were intended to
 drive home the message. The Israelis probably would not move into
 Beirut to combat the Palestinians, but they will continue the airstrikes
 and patrols they have been conducting in the Shuf.
 Syria has an interest in allowing some pro-Syrian Palestinians to
 move into the Beirut area. It wants to prevent pro-Arafat Palestinians
 from reestablishing a presence there, as well as to keep the Shia and
 Druze forces from becoming too independent of Syrian control.

 At the same time, Damascus does not want to see the PLO
 groups establish their own area of control outside Syrian-occupied
 territory. It will follow its customary practice of playing off the various
 groups against one another.
 Prospects for Conflict
 If the contradictory goals of the Shia and the Druze eventually
 bring them into conflict, the presence of the PLO groups will make the
 situation even more volatile. The Palestinians may seek to ally
 themselves with West Beirut's Sunni population, which resents Shia

 Special Analysis
 PERSIAN GULF STATES: Air Defense Capabilities
 Iran has announced that, if its oil exports are disrupted, it will
 retaliate against countries on the Arabian Peninsula that are
 supporting Iraq. Now that a major Iranian offensive seems imminent,
 Iraq is more likely to send its aircraft against Iranian oil facilities and
 shipping at Khark Island. If Iran retaliates with airstrikes against its
 neighbors on the Persian Gulf, their air defenses would be unable to
 prevent some strike aircraft from reaching important targets.
 Iran demonstrated an ability to hit targets in the Gulf by attacking
 Iraqi offshore oil-loading terminals in November 1980 and Kuwaiti oil
 facilities in October 1981. Although Tehran's air capabilities have
 diminished since then, Iran still has 85 operational fighter aircraft
 available for limited strikes across the Gulf.
 Oil facilities and water desalination plants in all the Gulf countries
 are highly vulnerable and could be crippled by an airstrike if it were
 well executed. Kuwait's oil export facilities are concentrated and are
 particularly susceptible to disruption. Saudi officials have indicated
 they are most concerned about attacks on desalination plants,
 probably because of the lack of alternative sources of water for
 domestic use.
 Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
 Saudi Arabia has the largest and best-equipped air force of any
 Gulf state, but it could not react to an Iranian attack quickly enough to
 fend it off. Even with warning from US AWACS monitoring the Persian
 Gulf, the Saudis would have no more than 15 minutes to respond to             25X1
 aircraft approaching from Iran.
 The Saudis raised the alert status of some F-15 fighter aircraft at
 Dhahran on 18 February, according to the US defense attache in
 Jidda. Nevertheless, few air defense units are available for immediate
 use. During the day, two F-15 fighter aircraft are on five-minute
 ground alert, two F-5 fighters are on 15-minute alert, and one I-HAWK
 surface-to-air missile battery is on 10-minute alert.
 Iranian aircraft probably could stage a surprise attack with
 minimal losses. Subsequent Iranian airstrikes, however, would be
 likely to suffer much higher losses.

 The Saudis could sustain a high state of readiness for their SAM
 batteries and fighter aircraft for about a week. After that, fatigue of
 personnel and attrition of equipment would begin to decrease their
 effectiveness.
 Kuwait has less capability than Saudi Arabia to defend against an
 Iranian airstrike. Moreover, it is an even more likely target than Saudi
 Arabia. Iran has attacked Kuwait before without provoking much
 international reaction.
 In addition, Kuwait would have less warning of an attack than
 Saudi Arabia. It probably would not be able to scramble its fighters in
 time to intercept, even if they were on alert.
 Even if the Kuwaitis were to have time to engage Iranian aircraft
 with their I-HAWKS, inadequate equipment maintenance as well as
 poorly trained and motivated personnel would seriously hamper the
 effort. The Iranians' airstrike on Kuwait in 1981 demonstrated that
 they can inflict major damage on Kuwaiti oil facilities with little
 interference from air defense forces.
 Other States
 Oman is more distant from Iranian airbases, and its air defenses
 would have more time to react to an approaching attack than would
 those of the other Persian Gulf states. The Omani Air Force, which is
 made up largely of British pilots, probably is the most capable in the
 region.
 The United Arab Emirates does not have the command and
 control capability to respond effectively to a surprise attack. Qatar
 and Bahrain have virtually no air defenses, and they would have to
 rely on the Saudis or US warships in the area.
 Lack of cooperation among the Gulf states hampers coordinated
 air'defense efforts, although the Gulf Cooperation Council is trying to
 encourage such coordination. This winter Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
 held their first combined air exercises, as did Oman and the UAE.
 Nonetheless, the Gulf states have not yet established a combined
 command structure or channels for sharing targeting information that
 could shorten their reaction time in an emergency.
 Implications for the US
 Iranian air attacks probably would cause only a minor disruption
 in oil supplies, such as the loss of 2 million to 3 million barrels per day
 of Saudi and Kuwaiti exports for a few days or weeks. Losses such as
 these easily could be offset by commercial inventories, floating

 storage, and surplus productive capacity. Price increases on the spot
 market caused by a limited disruption probably would be temporary.
 A more substantial disruption, such as a drop in exports from
 Persian Gulf states of 5 million barrels per day over several months,
 would have a more serious impact on prices. Such a disruption could
 occur in the unlikely event that Iranian attacks caused severe damage
 to export facilities in both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
 An Iranian airstrike against one of the Gulf states would produce
 varying reactions, ranging from appeasement of Iran to requests for
 US military intervention, depending on the country and installations
 attacked and the number and intensity of the attacks. Each of the Gulf
 states-with the possible exception of Kuwait-probably would grant
 US forces access to their military installations following a major
 Iranian attack.
 The Saudis might first launch retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian
 installations along the Persian Gulf. During the last few months, the
 Saudi Air Force has been training for such a contingency.
 US civilian contract personnel provide essential equipment
 maintenance for HAWK missile sites in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In
 the event of hostilities, they would be likely to leave the sites.
 US forces in the area include five warships stationed in the
 Persian Gulf, US AWACS and advisers in Saudi Arabia, and a carrier
 battle group in the Arabian Sea. The warships can provide limited
 point air defense and can supplement the radar coverage provided by
 the AWACS.
