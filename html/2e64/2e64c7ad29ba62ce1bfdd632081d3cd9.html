 THE INDIANAPOLIS NEWS
 SATURDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 12, 1977
 2 Flaws:
 New CIA
 Chief
 GREENCASTLE, Ind. (AP) - CIA
 Director Stansfield Turner says he sees
 two potential flaws in the nation's re-
 vamped intelligence policy - timidity
 when risky action is demanded and the
 possibility of security leaks through in-
 creased supervision.
 Nevertheless, he said, he feels the
 nation is on the way to establishing the
 proper balance between checks on the
 CIA and effective intelligence
 gathering.
 "I can't guarantee you this is going
 to work, but I'll tell you that I'm op-
 timistic today," he told an audience at
 DePauw University yesterday. "I think
 in two or three years it will settle down
 into a relationship that is one of good
 supervision, good oversight but still al-
 lowing enough initiative, enough effec-
 tiveness to perform the vital intelli-
 gence missions that our country re-
 quires."
 Addressing a student group for the
 first time since his appointment as head
 of the CIA, Turner said that while
 undercover operations are now used
 only with presidential sanction, "the
 spy . . . remains a vital arrow in the
 quiver of our intelligence capabilities"
 and probably will for years longer.
 Turner conceded there are risks "in
 two directions" in the supervisory proc-
 ess designed to guard against CIA ex-
 cesses, he said.
 "One is what I call timidity .
 (that) we'll only do those things that
 are easy and not risky," he said. "It's
 easy ... to vote `No.' It's more dif-
 ficult to stand up and say, `Yes, that
 risk is worth it - it's important to the
 country.' "
 "And the second danger we face,"
 Turner said, "is one of security leaks -
 the more you proliferate the number of
 people in the oversight process . . . the
 more danger there is of some inadver-
 tent leak which will destroy an intelli-
 gence operation, endanger lives and cost
 information we would obtain for our
 country's benefit."
 Pointing out that most of the infor-
 mation gathered by the CIA is overt
 and academically useful, Turner also
 condemned universities which forbid as-
 sociations between their scholars and
 the intelligence community.
 "(If) a university has a regulation
 that any external contact . . . must be
 reported, clearly that's fine," he said.
 "But there have been cases where they
 have singled out intelligence ... I
 think that's discriminating against the
 individual's right to association and
 right to determine with whom he con-
 ducts his business."
 He later told reporters he was
 pleased with the disposition of charges
 against former CIA director Richard
 Helms, accused of testifying falsely be-
 fore the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee. Helms received a fine and sus-
 pended sentence in a plea bargain ar-
 rangement with the Justice Depart-
 ment.
 "I clearly am reminded . . . that
 none of us in government is abovo
 law or entitled to lie," Tv-

 same would be true regarding the Robert Kennedy case.
 Asked about microwaves the Russians are beaming
 at the American Embassy in Moscow, Turner said he is
 unhappy about the situation and, wants it stopped. He
 added that the beams are below the Russian safety
 standard, which is 100 times as stringent as the
 American standard.
 Turner refused to discuss the foreign policy aspects
 of the Panama Canal treaties. But he said he believes
 that the canal is vulnerable to sabotage or attack.
 He said he has no reason to believe President Carter
 has withheld information about the canal treaties from
 the American public as was charged by retired Adm.

 By PAUL M. DOHERTY
 Greencastle, Ind. - The head of the CIA defended
 the intelligence agency's the policy of working with
 academic persons during a visit here Friday.
 He also displayed a deft hand at publicity gimmicks.
 ADM. STANSFIELD TURNER brought up his con-
 cern about continued work with college faculty and
 other academic people in his formal remarks at the
 DePauw University Performing Arts Center and was
 asked about it by a faculty member during a luncheon
 in the Student Union.
 Turner said the CIA has academic people on its
 payroll, but mentioned that the agency's policy is not to
 have in its pay anyone who works for accredited news
 agencies.
 Some people are taking an unreasonable attitude that
 any such relationship is improper and unhealthy, he
 continued.
 "I hope very much to reverse this trend," he said.
 Turner told of a Brooklyn College professor who
 traded information about Russia with the CIA and
 became a center of controversy. He was denied tenure.
 Such an attitude is "very discouraging and very
 improper," he stated.
 He claimed some in the academic community made
 similar mistakes in the 1960s, when some campuses
 removed reserve military training programs in response
 to student protests. Some scholars who complained of a
 typically narrow, right-wing military mind thus "took
 their hand off the tiller" of influence over future
 officers, he declared.
 TURNER SAID HE is satisfied with the suspended
 prison term given to former CIA director Richard
 Helms in return for pleading guilty to lying to a Senate
 committee. He said a trial might have forced the
 disclosure of important foreign policy secrets.
 In answers to questions from the DePauw audiences
 and from the press, Turner said congressional control
 over his agency is much tighter than in the past. He
 declared he would be remiss if he let the agency's
 ability to conduct covert operations atrophy.  Turner
 stressed that House and Senate special committees get
 regular reports from him and that any covert operation
 would need their approval as well as that of the
 President.
 He stated that "spooks and archeology" go together
 because aerial photography can detect regular contours
 of earth that reveal sites of ancient structures in places
 which might be inaccessible or subject to security
 restrictions.
 IN ANSWER TO a question, Turner said he is not
 familiar with an as-yet unpublished book claiming a CIA
 connection with the assassination of Robert Kennedy.
 Turner added that he has studied the. files on John
 Kennedy's assassination and is sure there was no CIA
 connection with that event. He said he is confident the

 THE COURIER.JOURNAL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1977      B 3
 Turner says
 CIA only spies
 as last resort
 Associated Press
 GREENCASTLE, Ind. - Stansfield
 Turner, CIA director, told a college au-
 dience yesterday that new oversight of
 ,.the-intelligence community is creating
 an American information-gathering ap-
 paratus that balances the nation's securi-
 ty needs with its traditional openness.
 However, he said that while clandes-
 tine operations are now used only as a
 last resort. "the spy - that's been here
 since Biblical days - remains a vital
 arrow in our quiver of intelligence capa-
 bilities."
 Speaking at DePauw University - his
 first college appearance since President
 Carter named him to head the CIA -
 Turner said he is fortunate, because un-

 Question, anyone?
 Stansfield Turner, director of the CIA; answers questions at a press
 conference after his speech to students at DePauw University. Turner
 had changed into athletic clothes after the speech to the students yes-
 terday in preparation for a tennis match after the press conference.
 (Story, Page B 1.)
 like former CIA chief Richard Helms,
 Turner must divulge information to Con.
 press only through the new Senate and
 House oversight committees.
 "I have a buffer, a protection against
 being asked by some other committee a
 question that it would be very difficult
 to apswer in public forthrightly and
 honestly," he said. "So when I'm asked
 about what we're doing and how we're
 doing it, I really only report to those
 two committees."
 Later, Turner told a news conference
 that he was pleased with the disposition
 of charges that Helms gave false testi-
 mony to a Senate committee. After plea
 bargaining with the Justice Department,
 Helens was allowed to plead guilty and
 reeved a fine and suspended sentence.
 "I  clearly  am  reminded . . . that
 none of us in the government are above
 the law or entitled to lie," he said. "Sec-
 ondly, I am pleased for the sake of our
 country that we did not have to go
 through a public trial and the very
 probable release of important informa=
 .tion to conduct that trial."
 Turner told the students that while
 the  new  oversight  arrangements  are
 aimed at making his agency more pub-
 licly accountable, he would be remiss to
 let its covert abilities atrophy.
 "When we start talking about closed
 societies, such as those behind the Iron
 Curtain," he said, "our ability to get ...
 information is severely limited.
 "Would you want us . . . to go ahead
 with the new strategic arms limitation
 (talks)  with  the  Soviet  Union  if  I
 couldn't tell you that I had a reasonable
 probability of knowing something about
 the trends, the attitudes, the construc-
 tion rates . . . in that country in their
 military sphere?"

 Special to The News
 CRAWFORDSVILLE, Ind. - Adm.

 College Nov. 11.
 Turner's lecture will begin at 8:30
 p.m. in Ball Theater of the Humanities
 Center. The speech is free and the
 public is invited.
 Turner was appointed to the CIA
 post in March. Before then, he was
 commander in chief of the Allied
 Forces Southern Europe in Naples,
 Italy, a position he assumed in 1975.
 A Rhodes Scholar from the Naval
 Academy, Turner has served a variety
 of sea assignments, including comman-

 a guided missile frigate. His shore as-
 signments included politico-military di-
 vision in the office of the chief of naval
 ;operations and assistant and naval aide
 to the secretary of the Navy.
 Turner was promoted to rear admir-
 al in 1970 and assumed command of a
 carrier task group of the Sixth Fleet
 while aboard the aircraft carrier USS

 the systems analysis division of the
 office of the chief of naval operations.
 In 1972, Turner became the 36th
 president of the Naval War College in
 Newport, R.I., receiving the rank of
 vice admiral.

 Rick Hohlt, Senator Richard Lugar8s Executive Assistant, informed
 me that you would appreciate some suggestions concerning topics
 college students might interested in learning more about regarding
 the C.I.A.
 College students will, obviously, ask sole questions concerning
 past cases involving alleged C.I.A. abuses of power.  I believe,
 however, that students want to know more about the positive
 programs that they hear are being undertaken to improve the
 effectiveness and integrity of the C.I.A.   Some questions which
 come to mind are as follows: 1) How much C.I.A. information is
 derived from sources available to all citizens---how much is
 gathered through cove  meths ?  2) Where does the U.S. stand
 in relation to other countries in the field of intelligence
 gathering?  3) Is there evidence to show that the reettdttions
 placed on governmental intelligence agencies have endangered
 our security and defense.  I realize that these ques  ons are general,
 yet,  1a answers could clear up some of the misconceptions
 about the role of the C.I.A. in our society.
 A mention of jobotunLta.es within the C.I.A. and requirements
 for employment would probably be of interest to an audience who
 will soon face a tight job market.  Are there any particular
 courses of study which would better prepare one for C.I.A.
 service?
 I hope these suggestions will be useful to Mr. Turner.  It seems
 to me that his scheduled public appearances will enhance the
 image of the C.I.A.  I feel that the best way to clear up the

 "mysticism" surrounding the C.I.A. is to educate the public
 about its purpose---the need for intelligence information---
 the methods used to gather the necessary information. May
 these efforts, particularly the one on November 11, be a
 success.

 Wabash College is a small, independent, liberal arts college for men.
 Although founded in 1832 by Presbyterian ministers, the College has no
 affiliations with any church.   It is also one of the few colleges that neither
 seeks nor accepts money from any governmental agency. V
 In 1973, the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to preserve Wabash as a
 college for men.   This was not a vote against coeducation, but rather a vote
 affirming the importance of men's education as an alternative.in our society.
 The College launched a $32 million campaign for "Continued Independence
 and Excellence" in 1974.  The goal was reached in December of last year and
 the money has been used to endow faculty salaries and scholarships, and to
 renovate campus facilities. -
 Wabash has long been noted for academic standards among the highest in
 the midwest.  Graduates are prominent statesmen, judges, attorneys,-physicians,
 educators, ministers, journalists and industrialists.  Approximately 350 alumni
 are practicing attorneys and 450 are physicians or surgeons.   In 1972, the
 national average for admission to medical schools was 38 -percent.   Wabash's
 average was 65 percent.  Approximately half of the graduating seniors each year
 go on to further their education in post-graduate schools.
 Important figures in the history of Indiana as well as the country
 have been Wabash men.
 Caleb Mills, the first professor at Wabash, was responsible for developing
 public education in Indiana.  Thomas Marshall, a Wabash alumnus, was vice
 president of the United States.  John L. Campbell is recognized as being the
 first person to suggest the international Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia
 to celebrate the centennial.  He was later its permanant secretary.

 On Nov. 12, Wabash and DePauw University will once again renew the
 "Oldest Continuous Football Rivalry West of the Alleghenies."  The prize for
 the victor is the 350-pound Monon Bell, donated to the two institutions by
 the Monon railroad.
 The Bell is currently at Wabash after the Little Giants beat the
 Dannies 14-7 last year.  Wabash plans to keep the Bell in 1977.   So far
 into the season, DePauw, a rest home for sissies, is-1 and 4, while Wabash
 is 4 and 1.
 The rivalry, carries over to other sports as well.   Last year, Wabash
 beat DePauw in every contest but one.   This--year, the .Little Giants have
 been victorious in soccer and cross country.   The-football game is the
 hottest rivalry of all and the first nine games of the season do not
 count when the teams meet on the field.
 As with any game,.training is the most important-aspect.   In the Sept.
 .10, 1973, edition of.Sports Illustrated, an article describes how the DePauw
 coach drives 30 miles from Greencastle to Crawfordsville, drops the
 team off on the Wabash campus and they "run like hell for home."

 I thought it might be in-order to outline our suggested
 schedule for Admiral Turner's visit to Wabash College on Friday,
 November 11, subject to your approval.  Please feel free to
 suggest any changes you wish.
 17:30-18:30 :    cocktail hour with alumni class representatives,
 their wives, and administrative officers of
 the college.
 18:45-20:00 :    dinner with the same group.
 20:30 :   talk in college theater to same group, plus
 students, faculty, and townspeople (theater
 holds about 300 people).
 After talk  :    questions and answers from add&ence.
 As far as the time of arrival is concerned, we will leave
 that to you.   If the Admiral would like to come sooner than 5:30,
 we can provide a guest house on the campus where he can be alone
 and relax.  Or we can do anything else he might like to do, such
 as sightseeing or talking with people.
 I believe you told me that the Admiral has his own plans for
 spending the night Friday.  If he wishes to stay in Crawfordsville,
 we can make adequate arrangements.
 Please le me know if the plans outlined are O.K. or if changes
 should be made.

 give a cocktail party and dinner for them   I have been requested to  injn tp
 his lecture will be built into the cl  s re-presentative  ro ram so there should
 b   about 10           of    em in the audience.  There will also be students and faculty.
 Townspeople are free to attend.               The auditorium seats about 300 people.
 I believe you said the Admiral would finish at DePauw about 2-3:00 P.M.   It is
 a forty-five minute drive to Crawfordsville.  We could arrange some quiet place
 where he and his party could relax for an hour or two before the evening
 schedule begins.

 I'm very sorry that there has been such a mixup
 about Admiral Turner's proposed visit.  I do think,
 however, that Friday night might not have been
 good because of so many possible Wabash-DePauw
 activities and also being a weekend.  I sincerely
 hope the visit can be arranged for Thursday night,
 November 10, or some other time.
 On several occasions when I have talked with
 you I meant to ask if you might know my son.  He
 is Lt. Cdr. Neil B. Thompson who has been public

 A friend of mine from DePauw University tells
 me it is possible that you may visit DePauw on
 November 11.  If you do, would it be possible for you
 also to come to Wabash College?  We are only thirty
 miles from Greencastle.
 I would like to invite you to address our student
 body, faculty, and townspeople on any subject of your
 choice but particularly on some phase of intelligence
 activities that can be discussed.  We have a student
 body of 800 men.  An evening would be preferable but
 we could consider another time of day.
 I hope you can give us a favorable reply.  Thank you.

 Wabash College is a small, independent, undergraduate liberal arts
 college for me.  Founded in 1832 by Presbyterian ministers and laymen,
 the College has from its beginning been independent of both church and-
 state.  Wabash, therefore, remains not only one of the few men's colleges,
 but one of the few colleges and universities in the country that neither
 seeks or accepts federal funds.
 Independence is an article of faith here.  Our policy affirms a belief
 that a community must be self-sufficient, that individual initiative
 remains the mainspring of a free society.
 Independence touches every aspect of life at the College.  Students
 take particular pride in the independent environment in which they
 study and live.  The College has but one rule of conduct.  It is simply
 stated in the College Catalog, "The student is expected to conduct him-
 self at all times, both on and off the campus, as a gentleman and a
 responsible citizen."
 Wabash stands high among colleges of recognized excellence, a position
 derived from rigorous academic standards, dedicated teaching, and a
 coherent curriculum.
 We believe in the Liberal Arts.  The goal of a liberal education, in
 the Wabash view, is not simply knowhow, or even knowledge.  It is,
 rather, the liberally educated man, a man who from his study of science,
 literature, history, and other forms of human inquiry, has come to the
 realization that the problem of man is man, that the question is not
 simply "how?" but "why?"  In the final analysis, Wabash holds, liberal
 education has as its single aim the humane man.
 Today, a liberal arts education is particularly practical as it pre-
 pares men to be adaptable and to respond to the demands of an unknown
 and uncertain future.
 The contributions of Wabash to its region and to the nation have, over
 the years, been impressive.  Our first professor, Caleb Mills, was re-
 sponsible for developing the system of public education in Indiana.
 Professor John Lyle Campbell first suggested the Centennial Exhibition
 of 1876 in Philadelphia and served as its permanent secretary.  Wabash
 alumnus Thomas Riley Marshall was Governor of Indiana and Vice President
 of the United States.

 The Journal of Chemical Education reported, in the fall of 1973, that
 "Wabash ranks tenth in the nation in supplying chemistry faculty to the
 34 'top prestigious universities'."  In another study, published in
 American Scientist at the end of 1972, Wabash ranked eighth in "average
 productivity .of institutions with respect to science graduates awarded
 National Science Foundation Fellowships in 1969, 1970, and 1971."  The
 other seven in this group included Harvard, Yale, M.I.T., and California
 Institute of Technology.
 Wabash has contributed, out of all proportion to its size, to the leader-
 ship of Indiana, the Midwest, and the nation.  It has always counted
 among its alumni prominent statesmen, judges, attorneys, physicians,
 educators, ministers, journalists, and industrialists.  One Wabash man
 is the retired Director of Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian)..
 Another is executive vice president of one of the largest charitable
 foundations in the world.  Wabash graduates have been or are presidents
 and chancellors of great universities including the University of Maryland,
 University of Bridgeport, and Dominican College.  Many are leaders in
 industry and commerce.  Approximately 350 Wabash alumni are practicing
 attorneys, and another 450 are physicians and surgeons.  These 800 pro-
 fessional men alone represent more than ten percent of all living
 alumni, one of whom is the Surgeon General of the United States Navy.
 The current president of Wabash is the eleventh in a line of distin-
 guished leaders.  Among his immediate predecessors were the late Dr.
 Frank H. Sparks, founding father of the Council for Financial Aid to
 Education and the concept of corporate giving to higher education,
 and Dr. Byron K. Trippet, who has continued his service to education
 both as president of the Independent College Funds of America and as
 president of the University of the Americas in Mexico.
 Wabash has a reputation for sound financial management.  This is par-
 ticularly apparent in the notable growth of the endowment from $12,800,000
 (market value) in 1962 to $40,000,000 today.  This $47,000 of endowment
 for each student places Wabash among the top 5-10 colleges or univer-
 sities in the country in this important resource category.
 The physical plant includes 32 buildings on 50 acres.  The plant
 represents an investment outlay of $20,200,000 with a current replace-
 ment value, for insurance purposes, of $33,000,000.
 Athletics are an integral part of our educational program.  At Wabash
 a locker is provided for every student, and 85 percent of the students
 participate in either one of the 10 varsity sports or the wide range
 of intramural athletics.  This year, as in most, 10 percent of the
 850 man student body is out for varsity football.

 The competition has changed from the early 1900's when Wabash played
 Purdue, Notre Dame, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota and won our share.
 The fighting spirit of those days when our teams earned the nickname
 "Little Giants" remains a characteristic of Wabash teams today.
 This indomitable spirit is contrasted with that of arch rival DePauw.
 In the words of John Underwood, Sports Illustrated, September 10, 1973,
 describing the series which now stands 39-37-7 in DePauw's favor,
 "Wabash has been playing DePauw in the privacy of western
 Indiana since 1890, which makes it (orchestra up) 'The Oldest
 Continuous Football Rivalry West of the Alleghenies.'...
 DePauw on the other hand  Underwood continues as he describes
 the typical Wabash opinion of DePauw7, is a rest home for
 sissies.  DePauw men are called 'Dailies' and are a hankie-
 waving bunch.  Nevertheless, they are not particularly keen-
 witted.  A Dannie carries an umbrella when the sun is out
 and puts it down when it starts to rain.  How does a Dannie
 get in shape for the big game?  The coach dumps him off the
 bus at Wabash, and he runs like hell for home."

 Wabash College is a small, independent, liberal arts college for men.
 Although founded in 1832 by Presbyterian ministers, the College has no
 affiliations with any church.   It is also one of the few colleges that neither
 seeks nor accepts money from any governmental agency.
 In 1973, the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to preserve Wabash as a
 college for men.  This was not a vote against coeducation; but rather a vote
 affirming the importance of men's education as an alternative in our society.
 The College launched a $32 million campaign for "Continued independence
 and Excellence" in 1974.  The goal was reached in December of last year and
 the money has been used to endow faculty salaries and scholarships, and to
 renovate campus facilities.
 Wabash has long been noted for academic standards among the highest in
 the midwest.  Graduates are prominent statesmen, judges, attorneys, physicians,
 educators, ministers, journalists and industrialists.  Approximately 350 alumni
 are practicing attorneys and 450 are physicians or surgeons.   In 1972, the
 national average for admission to medical schools was 38 percent.   Wabash's
 average was 65 percent.  Approximately half of the graduating seniors each year
 go on to further their education in post-graduate schools.
 Important figures in the history of Indiana as well as the country
 have been Wabash men.
 Caleb Mills, the first professor at Wabash, was responsible for developing
 public education in Indiana.  Thomas Marshall, a Wabash alumnus, was vice
 president of the United States.  John L. Campbell is recognized as being the
 first person to suggest the international Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia
 to celebrate the centennial.  He was later its permanant secretary.

 On Nov. 12, Wabash and DePauw University will once again renew the
 "Oldest Continuous Football Rivalry West of the Alleghenies."  The prize for
 the victor is the 350-pound Monon Bell, donated to the two institutions by
 the Monon railroad.
 The Bell is currently at Wabash after the Little Giants beat the
 Dannies 14-7 last year.  Wabash plans to keep the Bell in 1977.   So far
 into the season, DePauw, a rest home for sissies, is 1 and 4, while Wabash
 is 4 and 1.
 The rivalry carries over to other sports as well.-  Last year,-Wabash
 beat DePauw in every contest but one..--This year,-the--Little Giants have
 been victorious in soccer and cross country.   The football game is the
 hottest rivalry of all and the first nine games of the season do not
 count when the teams meet on the field.
 As with any game, training is the most important aspect.   In the Sept.
 10, 1973, edition of.Sports Illustrated, an article-describes how the DePauw
 coach drives 30 miles from Greencastle to Crawfordsville, drops the
 team off on the Wabash campus and they "run like hell for home."

 find ways to ensure mistakes/impressions of
 mistakes don't reoccur.  All we do must rest on
 a solid foundation of the ethical/moral values
 B.   Ethics
 - Would like to write a formal code of ethics for
 the IC.   Not an effort to restrict action, instead to
 try to help.   We all have own personal code, but
 organizations must have standards too.   Unexpressed,
 they can only be assumed.   It really isn't fair
 to our employees to expect them to live up to
 standards which have not been made explicit.

 Problems:
 1.  Values hard to pin down; interpretations of
 national ethics change with time and cir-
 cumstance.
 2.  Difficult to test acceptability of secret
 operations through public opinion.   Consequently
 must attempt to judge what the nation wants
 today and will continue to approve tomorrow.
 In doing so, whether or not a formal code of ethics
 can be written, the reassessment of our operations
 and their measurement against today's expressed ethics
 is worthwhile because:
 a.   it sensitizes the whole IC to the
 issues, and
 b.   it encourages public understanding of the
 real problems involved in trying to run
 an intelligence organization. in accordance
 with the Marquis of Queensbury rules.
 We do have some guidelines, however, - for instance on the
 1.   Domestic side that is, activities involving U.S.
 citizens, in U.S.A., have easiest time.
 Most are closely controlled by law, e.g.,
 new wiretap legislation.   I'm sure you feel
 as I do - don't want to go to jail any more
 than any other citizen.

 - Finally, have our own regulations:

 with accredited American media are permitted.

 We don't use them as agents.   However,
 do respect journalists as citizens.   They
 have right to assist the government by
 passing on observations/information if they
 so desire.   Nothing improper.   Injurious
 freedom?  press sharing -
 b.   Clergy/missionaries
 No secret, paid or unpaid, contractual
 relationships permitted.   None exist.
 c.   Academia
 Do have paid relationships - e.g., engage
 professors to write or do research for us.
 Afraid, however, the popular but unreasonable
 view in some areas of academe that any
 relationship between the academic and intell
 communities is improper.   This had led
 to unhealthy reduction in the amount of contact
 I hope to expand those relationships.

 Let me dwell on this a bit as it is
 important, controversial, and not well
 understood.
 I don't want to undermine academia:
 1) By influencing curricula/teaching;
 2) By tarnishing image.
 Thus, we will not enter into paid or unpaid
 relationships which would prejudice teaching
 responsibilities nor will we use academic
 status of one of our associates to conceal
 his identity.
 But within those limits still lots of room
 for association with the IC which need not call
 into doubt the authenticity and credibility of
 our educational institutions.
 The enormous intellectual resources in our universities
 should be free to interact with government at all levels.

 Recently, for instance, I asked an imminent Sovietologist to
 do some work for us.   It would be a shame if he could not because
 of irresponsible pressures within the academic community.  He will
 provide a degree of depth and perspective on the Soviet Union which
 it is difficult to find outside the academic community.   At the same
 time he will become more valuable to his students by improving the
 depth of his understanding of how government actually operates in
 the Soviet Union.   Even if he is not able to relate to his students
 the classified information he might acquire in this kind of exchange,
 unquestionably his insights and improved understanding will make his
 teaching more relevant and enhance his ultimate worth on the campus.
 This raises the question -
 If a relationship exists between an individual on
 campus for example  and the IC, should the IC be
 obliged to reveal that relationship to the administration
 of the school and perhaps even to the public?
 I believe it is the individual professor's right to associate with
 whomever he deems appropriate and I also believe it is his
 prerogative      to reveal his relationships to his institution or not;
 just as you and I, he should be the final arbiter of who knows his
 personal business.   Clearly the professor must have a conscience
 and perhaps the university some rules about what level of outside
 activity constitutes interference with his professional duties, but
 such rules should apply to all extra-teaching activities not just
 those with the CIA or other intelligence organizations.

 Let me also point out that the benefits of.IC and AC
 working together is not a one way street.               For instance in the
 field of archaeology, some parts of the world are inaccessible,
 to archaeologists due to either geography or political climate.
 Aerial photographs can not only provide access to the unaccessible,
 they can reveal features which are either invisible or distorted
 to an observer at ground level.  Ancient cities, fortifications,
 villas, roads, and other structures which have been eroded by
 time, destroyed by war, or in many cases vandalized can be
 revealed to the aerial camera.   The Intelligence Community,
 because of its particular needs, has acquired a massive amount
 of photography useful to the academic community.
 It would be a shame if this knowledge could not be shared
 because universities chose to levy rigid prohibitions on their
 faculty.
 .-So in the United States, intell activity carefully
 circumscribed within a framework of both laws and regulations
 which protect the citizen.
 2.   Overseas and with respect to non-U.S.  citizens, the
 problem of reflecting our nation's values in intelligence
 operations becomes much more of a judgmental question and one
 where the trade-offs must be weighed judiciously.

 - In open societies like ours it is relatively
 easy to keep abreast of trends/attitudes, foreign
 policy initiatives, and to be prepared for future events.
 Intelligence operations are largely a matter of shared
 confidences, reading the newspapers and journals, and
 keeping one's eyes open.
 - In closed societies our need for good information
 about trends, policies, and intentions is just as great,
 while ability to acquire that information openly is
 severely limited.
 Most extreme example, of course, is Soviet
 Russia.   First society in our history with potential
 to literally destroy us.   Need gain access to
 assure national security, e.g., SALT; but info.-
 needed pertains wider sphere than purely military.
 Much more mundane and practical than that - 1972 grain
 deal.
 Yet only access sometimes is through clandestine means.
 Here, the benefits of gaining vital intelligence must
 be weighed against our fundamental preference to deal openly
 and honestly with our neighbors, and be as solicitous of the
 individual rights of foreigners as we are of our own citizens.

 When does the need for good information
 outweigh the desire to reflect American
 values in everything we do.
 Clandestine collection
 and covert action are highly charged issues
 in the eyes of the average American.
 People come to this issue with varied
 backgrounds and prejudicies:   some wonder
 why the U.S. should engage in any
 clandestine action at all; others wonder.
 whether any clandestine action the U.S. takes
 abroad could harm an important American
 interest; still others, outraged at Soviet
 electronic eavesdropping on U.S.  citizens'
 phone calls, or Korean payments to U.S.
 Congressmen, but uncomfortable about the
 basis for their outrage for fear CIA engages
 in equivalent practices in the Soviet Union
 and Korea, are confused.
 Clandestine gathering of information is a
 tool used sparingly.   There is always a
 necessity for ascertaining that. this
 information is not available through overt

 or less risky sources.   I assure you,
 however, that with all the wonderful new
 technical means we have today, clandestine
 spying is still a vital arrow in our
 quiver of intelligence gathering techniques.
 - To what lengths            should
 we go in pursuing information?   To what
 limits should pragmatism override idealism?
 On whose judgment should we depend?  Recall
 operate largely in secret,      public
 scrutiny cannot be our      guide; we
 must find a surrogate process of public

 The Director of Central Intelligence

 Your speech at the North Shore Unitarian Church
 in Deerfield last Sunday night was one of the great
 occasions for the Church, its members and the Deer-
 field, Highland Park communities.
 I would again like to thank you for taking the
 time to visit with us.   I do hope that some years
 from now you will accept another invitation for a
 return engagement, be it as Director of Central in-
 telligence or as Secretary of State.
 Everyone also enjoyed meeting Mrs. Turner.   It
 was kind of her to be present.
 With best wishes.
 Very  incerel  yours,

 Both Clarissa and my secretary showed me clippings from the local
 papers announcing'you as the speaker at the North Shore Unitarian
 Church in Deerfield on November 13th.
 Clarissa and I fully intend to be there as a part of your audience.
 The thought occurs to me that while you are in Chicago you might
 need transportation.   We now have a Cadillac dealership, as you
 may know, and have available a 1978 Cadillac limousine and driver.
 If you have any use for the car and driver I would be happy to
 make them available to you during your stay here.   If you wish, we
 can have the car pick you up at the airport, and you can take it
 from there and make whatever use you wish of it.
 Also,  I know your schedule must be crowded, but if you do have any
 time while you are here, and would like a quiet dinner, Clarissa and
 I would be most happy to have you as our guest.   If you need a con-
 venient place to stay, we have a pretty roomy house in Winnetka,
 where you (and your wife if she is travelling with you) would be
 most welcome to spend a few days.
 Stan, I don't want to intrude, but do want to let you know that if
 we can be of any service to you while you are in the area, we would
 be very happy to do so.

 read of the designation and confirmation of a.  Highland

 and LakeForest,. Illinois:.   The Board has asked. me to in-
 vite you to give a talk at our Church on a subject:in.the
 general area of your new governmental responsibilities.
 In view of the New York. Times description of..you as a man
 "endlessly curious-about philosophy, . theater, opera.,.in-
 ternational politics and military. affairs.  I would be most
 hesitant to limit. you in. the choice of a to.pic,.,although
 of course,.your concepts. of national security and military
 affairs would be of real interest..
 I would schedule your talk on a Sunday evening of your
 choice, and publicize.it in the adjoining suburban communi-
 ties..   Since our Church generally enjoys 'a summer recess
 from, Mid-June to Mid-September, I might suggest that if you
 can accept our invitation that you let me' have.a few possible
 dates between now and early June or from late September

 Integral to architect Ron Dirsmith's imaginative concept of a
 worship area for, the North Shore Unitarian Church was a
 soaring, sculptured white wall punctuated by multicolored
 glass panels. This idea, creatively bold, won enthusiastic re-
 ponse from Bob White, artist in fused glass.
 the r1orzrb 42or  ~r~rta~ziar~ cF~Uwcf~
 Minister, architect, and artist then pooled ideas, hopes, and
 doubts, as the work evolved. No ordinary, stylized theological
 cliches in stained glass would do. This work was to bring vivid
 life to the beauty and honesty of the Unitarian Universalist
 faith!
 Their three-fold effort brought together a rational theology,
 an imposing work of art, and an architectural setting to dis-
 play it worthily. Its exposition of a liberal religious world-
 view is eloquently silent, but expressive in full measure and
 lofty impact.
 Bob White's glass panels are a modern masterpiece in a medium
 wherein he stands virtually alone. Fused glass is more respon-
 sive than stained glass to subtleties in the artist's conception.
 Applying his talent in both the limitations and opportunities
 of this medium, Bob White has created in these 23 panels a
 glorious statement of human dignity and worth, of the majesty
 of human discovery, and of the ineffable beauty of the uni-
 verse we are privileged to inhabit.
 May this book celebrate the achievements of a great artist, and
 the congregation and friends whose vision and generosity made
 this magnificent work possible.

 1                                   Sensitive, intelligent man scans-through the lens of accumulated knowledge
 of his predecessors-to farther, clearer reaches of understanding of his uni-
 verse. He is Man-the-Searcher, ever inquisitive, daring the unknown, correct-
 ing error, revealing new facets of palpable truth. The magnifying lens is
 stamped with a theorem of Copernicus. Man's eye embraces the earth turning
 in its envelope of atmosphere, into the distant infra of open space and the
 Sun-Source, shedding its spectrum range of color from red to violet upon his
 gaze. In his raised hand he balances a tetrahedron, a geometric figure drawn
 from Euclid. His right arm reaches downward to his fellows with,a gift of
 Promethean fire in his hand.
 2  "Chimaera and the Lens": gods anthropomorphic and pantheistic created out
 of man's fears and mystification. Behind primitive searchings grew founda-
 tions of science; analysis, though often grotesquely misguided, was sometimes
 serene, inspired, beautiful. Priest, Poet and Philosopher sought to penetrate
 the dread veils of death, and to stem tides of social misfortune. In so doing,
 they led the way to liberation of human mind from superstition. They
 opened doorways and lenses to closer study of the structure, of life and paths
 of social growth. A microscopic lens cuts through the images of Sphinx,
 Plumed Serpent and a falcon-headed deity of Egypt. A magnified drop of
 water and a grain of salt, the cross-section of a vein, tell of Man seeking
 truth in the minutiae of his natural environment.
 3   The microscopic lens of panel no. 2 continues downward into this section,
 capturing the symmetry and beauty of a single snowflake. Beneath the lens

 4   Man has for centuries used the human eye as a mystical symbol of vision and
 supreme knowledge. It appears in literary and artistic allusion throughout all
 times and cultures into the present. The eye here is the focal center of
 surrounding subject matter, in the central panel of the major group. The eye
 here depicted is not the "All-seeing eye of God", but the "All-searching eye
 of Man", which gathers the rays of light into its crucible and pours them
 forth again in all the colors and patterns of the visible world, and searches
 for truth in all directions, outward and within.
 5   Beneath man's "searching eye" (Panel no. 4), treasures from under the earth
 have come into view, as casual chance and directed search revealed marvels of
 ancient cultures. Here, left to right, are: 1) irridescent beauty in a buried
 Greek vial; 2) prehistoric cave painting of a bison; 3) a stone tablet bearing a
 hieroglyphic text.
 6   Bands of varying rock strata enfold: 1) skeleton of an insect preserved in
 amber. 2) fossil radiolaria; 3) carbonized prehistoric leaf. At the bottom of
 this and two following panels is the red of fiery molten rock magma beneath
 earth's cold crust.
 7   Continuing bands of rock strata show: 1) a 50 million year old bony fish
 fossil; 2) a fossil brachiopod with original pearly lustre. In upper position;
 an under-earth lake of oil.

 8   The structural patterns of earth's mountains continuing beneath the seas, with sands and tides suggested
 above.
 9   Man as creator of his environment has expanded his skills in harmony with his expanding knowledge of
 physics and mathematics. The Golden Age of classic architecture under Pericles is suggested here by a
 corner of the Parthenon, with entablature of the Doric order. Two capitals illustrate Corinthian and
 Ionic order of Greek architecture. The Gothic section to the left typifies the fervor of Christian faith
 following the dark ages, which produced the soaring, upreaching height of cathedrals. From the engineer-
 ing knowledge of. the Romans there developed a new expression, transforming mosaics of opacity into
 art realms of unprecedented transparency in colored light. Design of this section suggests the high vault-
 ed ceilings of Chartres Cathedral, with the noted Jesse Tree stained glass window. The central section of
 Panel no. 9 shows a moon-rocket poised against its launching tower, symbol of man's new-found
 command over his environment: the ability to migrate and be housed in the inimical void beyond earth's
 atmosphere.
 10. Man beneath the scientific lens, showing the autonomic nervous system with its vine-like tentacles
 reporting and commanding the functions of organic life. Upper. right is the Code of Hammurabi, from
 2100 B.C. in Babylonia, one symbol of man's historic struggle to give law and symmetry to his social
 entity. In the lower left are symbols of Greek philosophy, Indian mysticism, and Christian theology -
 forces which have moved Western man, over 20 centuries, toward ethical commitment. This panel poses
 a question: "What shall be the future line of man's search for and affirmation of truth?"
 11  The first"earth-rise" is depicted here: the view witnessed by astronauts on the moon. The theme of
 Panel no. 11 is approximately juxtaposed to no. 1, wherein Copernicus' theory states that the earth and
 a system of planets revolve around a central sun. Through mastery of mathematics, astronomy, physics,
 chemistry, and mechanics, man has reached past the bondage of his native earth, traveled.into outer
 space, and beheld his earth as a whole. In the upper section of the panel we see how atomic fusions of
 the sun explode, sending energy earthward through the infra of space.

 12   This second group of panels treats of the beauty of man's environment,
 beginning with "Splendor of the Skies," first of the group, 12th in the total
 series. It opens with the arch of the rainbow, long-familiar symbol of promise
 and beauty. Within its embrace are clouds-cirrus, cumulus, and stratus-and
 a flare of lightning. A telescopic view of the spiral nebula in Pisces follows.
 13   Titled "Flowers of Water", this panel shows the strange forms and beauty of
 sea plankton, as revealed by the microscope.
 14   "Flowers of Air and Earth Commingling" shows trees reaching branches into
 the air, red bird and cedar tree, fronds of palm. In the lower section, a moth
 hovers above fern; flowering plants and vine crown an outcropping of rock.
 At the far right is the tree beneath the earth, spreading tendrils of a root
 system under ground.

 18   "Microcosm." Lower motif diagrams force-patterns of carbon atoms, arranged geometrically to structure
 the many-sided hardness of a crude diamond, hardness that exceeds that of all other known substances.
 Above this design appear. the nucleolus and chromosomes of a single, general human cell, crowned by the
 centrosome which triggers the cell's self-division. Of the trillion diversified cells in the adult human body,
 we glimpse here only a miniscule fraction of the complex microcosmic structure. These two motifs together
 hint at the presently known structure of inorganic substance and organic life.
 19   "From Micro-Cosmos to Macro-Cosmos." This panel assumes a theoretical mid-point at which man's intel-
 ligence looks outward to the extensions of space, and inward to.the invisible activity of sub-atomic forces.
 Lower motif is the making of matter from energy: a high energy gamma ray is divided into positron and
 electron when fired into liquid hydrogen, leaving distinctive tracery of mysterious fact. Upper motif of this
 panel diagrams the speculative formation of proto-sun and solar system, born from gravitational forces
 working upon planetary dust and inter-spatial gaseous clouds, revolving and evolving.
 20   "Listening to the Stars." Pictorial diagram of advancing development of radio-astronomy, which plumbs the
 depths and character of distant galaxies by radio-wave, and provides new knowledge of the universe of stars,
 sometimes beyond the range of most powerful visual telescopes.
 21   (Artist's descriptive notes lost) The viewer here picks up a foretaste of the next panel, with spiral expansion
 hinted, but not yet developed. Bob White recalls something of earth's magnetosphere and the phenomenon
 of the auroras.
 22   "Cosmology - the expanding Universe." Brief hints of spiralling shapes of galaxies believed to be (relative
 to a fixed position of the earth in the Milky Way) receding from our position at mathematically determined
 speeds illustrated by their spectra. Questions of positive, flat, or negative curvature of the entire cosmos, of
 space itself, to what unknown dimension or to infinite extensions of time, matter,. energy, space, and
 meaning?
 23   Visible at only a few positions in the building: consists of source of light harmonious in color with general
 schema of remaining 22 glass panels. In view of the value of the science of spectroscopy to man's search for
 reality and promise in his world and in the universes beyond, this pattern of spectral light is an appropriate
 conclusion.

 the arztist
 Bob White is the lone master .of the medium of fused glass, a transparent
 prodigality of color and detail that resembles older stained glass methods
 as a bolt of lightning resembles a fluorescent lamp. Through years of experi-
 mentation he developed the skill to liberate stained glass from its leaden
 divisions that limited the scope of the artist to creating jigsaw puzzles in
 glass. The heat of a kiln releases the flow of color into color, the merging of
 patterns within one boundary. Fused glass technique enables the artist to
 transcend the usual limitations, until he seems to paint radiant colors upon a
 transparent canvas!
 In total command of this advanced medium, Bob White's impressive scholar-.
 ship takes over the conception and planning of his work. The "wall of-glass"
 for the North Shore Unitarian Church took shape in the artist's mind and
 heart as he pondered the humanistic emphasis of this rational, noncreedal,
 dogma-free religious faith. His knowledge of history, medicine, astronomy,
 mathematics, and nuclear physics-among other fields of learning-gave variety
 and structure to the total work of art, consisting of 23 individual panels.
 Let Bob White tell how he conceives the work, its form, and its message:
 While all 23 panels of fused glass in the worship area of this church are
 designed as a single artistic composition, it was from the first conceived that
 this total symphonic scheme should be divided into three separate, related
 movements.
 The first, major group of openings '.explores thematically Man's age-long.
 search for 'the truths ' of the universe. The emphasis is upon man and the
 positive factors in his historic, evolution.
 The second, middle group of openings, comprising six panels, is the lyrical,
 or pastoral movement of the composition. It treats of the beauty of the
 natural world surrounding Man, the, flowers of air, earth, water, ' and, fire
 which grace his environment. This passage is intended as a ,kind of song of
 gratitude for the inexhaustible variety of refreshment and inspiration offered
 by Nature to Man's senses.
 Approved For Release 2009/07/15: CIA-RDP05SO062OR000401170001-8
 Approved For Release 2009/07/15: CIA-RDP05SO062OR000401170001-8
 The Third Movement (the final, "upper" cluster of free-form glass openings)
 seeks to express the forward movement of Man's continuing search for the
 truth into the microcosm and macrocosm of reality. Only by the aid of most
 ingenious and complex instrumentation and through the lenses of a new
 "quantum" mathematics has the contemporary searcher been able to pene-
 trate into fields hitherto locked to man's comprehension and investigation.
 It is the exciting theme of man's unquenched thirst for further reaches of
 exploration and knowledge that prompts the design of these last few panels.
 So, in a sense, the composition seeks to indicate pathways toward the un-
 known future of Man's destiny. Obviously, the "Unknown Itself" cannot be
 depicted, and therefore I have chosen to present symbols of steps already
 taken into daring research and speculation, which open out new vistas of the
 future directions of penetration of Man's mind into ever-expanding depths
 of minutiae and flinging distances of magnitude.
 Born the seventh and youngest'child in an Iowa family, Bob knew from the
 age of nine that he wanted to be an artist. At the age of seventeen he enrolled
 in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and later travelled in Europe for
 two years, painting as he went from one country to another.
 It was at the Chartres Cathedral that he made the choice to work in glass.
 He found the light of the windows psychedelic in impact, a pulsating, physical
 thing to the eye, like sound upon the ear drum.
 After many years of work in conventional stained glass, he began to experi-
 ment with fusions, and was pleased with what he found. In 1930 he re-
 ceived a Guggenheim fellowship to pursue studies in the creative arts of glass.
 He has done painting and sculpture, and sometimes combines the forms and
 techniques. But with a major work of art in fused glass completed at the
 North Shore Unitarian Church, Bob White went on to an even larger church
 project in Mason City, Iowa, where there are two hundred and fifteen fusions,
 instead of twenty-three!
 There is satisfaction, and gratitude to the artist, also, in the existence in this
 church of a masterpiece of art. Although its value and greatness may await the
 slow decree of history, we who have participated in the artist's creative
 efforts, watching his work grow, have reached our verdict. We know that we
 have a monumental work, magnificent in conception and execution, to be
 appreciated now, and by ages to come!

 Ron Dirsmith is a native of Chicago,

 graduation from the University of
 Illinois, he received a Prix de Rome
 fellowship, and spent two years in
 Rome, becoming enamored of its an-
 cient ruins and ivy-covered walls. To
 this respect and love for antiquity, he
 brings a freshness of innovative modern
 ideas, and blends the two influences
 into an architectural style as unique as
 his ebullient personality.
 A feeling for space - for the people
 who use it, and ways they can use it -
 is a guiding principle in Ron Dirsmith's
 work. It undergirds his aesthetic sim-
 plicity and boldness. It has made the
 North Shore Unitarian Church a land-
 mark of functional church architecture.
 Architect and glass artist together cre-

 SECRECY AND MORALITY IN INTELLIGENCE
 A.   Past seven months
 looking at/explaining past intel activities
 not exercise in burying/praising past
 value of looking at past:   makes you want to find
 ways to ensure mistakes/impressions of mistakes
 don't reoccur.   All we must do rest  on a solid
 foundation of the ethical/moral values of our nation.
 B.   Ethics
 -   Would like to write a formal code of ethics for the IC.
 Not an effort to restrict action, instead to try to help.
 We all have own personal code, but organizations must
 have standards too.   Unexpressed, they can only be assumed-
 It really isn't fair to our employees to expect them to
 live up to standards which have not been made explicit.

 -   Problems:
 1.   Values hard to pin down; interpretations of
 national ethics change with time and circumstance.
 2.   Difficult to test acceptability of secret operations
 through public opinion.   Consequently, must attempt
 to judge what the nation wants today and will
 continue to approve tomorrow.
 -   In doing so, whether or not a formal code of ethics can
 be written, the reassessment of our operations and their
 measurement against today's expressed ethics is----worthwhile
 because:
 a.   it sensitizes the whole IC to the issues, and
 b.   it encourages public understanding of the
 real problems involved in trying to run
 an intelligence organization in accordance
 with the Marquis of Queensbury.rules.
 We do have some guidelines however - for instance on the
 1.   Domestic side that is, activities involving U.S.
 citizens, in U.S.A., have easiest time.
 - Most are closely controlled by law, e.g.,
 new wiretap legislation.   I'm sure you feel
 as I do - don't want to go to jail any more
 than any other citizen.
 - In other cases we are regulated by Presidential order:
 Assassinations.

 Finally, have our own regulations:
 a.    Media
 Today - no paid contractual relationships
 with accredited American media are'permitted.
 We don't use them as agents.  However, do
 respect journalists as citizens.  They have
 right to assist the government by passing
 on observations/information if they so
 desire.   Nothing improper.   Injurious
 freedom?  press sharing -
 b.   Clergy/missionaries  '
 No secret, paid or unpaid, contractual

 Do have paid relationships - e.g., engage
 professors to write or do research for us.
 Afraid, however, the popular but unreasonable
 view in some areas of academe that any
 relationship between the academic and intel
 communities is improper.   This has led
 to unhealthy reduction in the amount of
 contact.
 I hope to expand those relationships.   Harvard

 The enormous intellectual resources in our
 universities should be free to interact
 with government at all levels.
 So within the United States, intel activity carefully
 circumscribed within a framework of both laws and regulations
 which protect the citizen.
 2.   Overseas and with respect to non-U.S. citizens, the
 problem of reflecting our nation's values in intelligence
 operations becomes much more of a judgmental question and one
 where the trade-offs must be weighed judiciously.
 - In open societies like ours it is relatively easy
 to keep abreast of trends/attitudes, foreign policy initiatives,
 and to be prepared for future events.   Intelligence
 operations are largely a matter of shared confidences,
 reading the newspapers and journals; and keeping
 one's eyes open.
 - In closed societies our need  for good information
 about trends, policies, and intentions is just as great,
 while ability to acquire that information openly is
 severely limited.
 Most extreme example, of course, is Soviet Russia.
 First society in our history with potential to
 literally destory us.   Need gain access to

 needed pertains wider sphere than purely military.
 Much more mundane and practical than that - 1972
 grain deal.
 Yet, only access sometimes is through clandestine
 means.
 Here, the benefits of gaining vital intelligence must
 be weighed against our fundamental preference to deal
 openly and honestly with our neighbors, and be as
 solicitious of the individual rights of foreigners as
 we are of our own citizens.
 When does the need for good information
 outweigh the desire to reflect American
 values in everything we do?
 Clandestine collection and covert
 action are highly charged issues in the
 eyes of the average American.
 People come to this issue with
 varied backgrounds and prejudices:
 some wonder why the U.S. should
 engage in any clandestine action
 at all; others wonder whether any
 clandestine action the U.S. takes
 abroad could harm an important
 American interest; still others,
 outraged at Soviet electronic
 eavesdropping on U.S.  citizens'

 phone calls, or Korean payments to
 U.S.  Congressmen, but uncomfortable
 about the basis for their outrage
 for fear CIA engages in equivalent
 practices in the Soviet Union and
 Korea, are confused.
 Clandestine gathering of information is
 a tool used sparingly.   There is always
 a necessity for ascertaining that this
 information is not available through
 overt or less risky sources.   I assure
 you, however, that with all the wonderful
 new technical means we have today
 clandestine spying is still a vital
 arrow in our quiver of intelligence
 gathering techniques.
 To what lengths, however, should
 we go in pursuing information?  To what
 limits should pragmatism override idealism?
 On whose judgment should we depend?
 Recall - operate largely in secret,
 . public    scrutiny cannot be our
 guide; we must find a surrogate process
 of public oversight.   That has been one
 major result of past several years
 of scrutiny and criticism

 Dear Clark,
 Thanks so much for your note after my visit to Chicago.  It
 was good to see you, even if the time to visit was rather brief
 with all that crowd.
 Pat and I are both sorry we did not get to see Woody.  We will
 look forward to seeing your new place on the Exmoor grounds.    I don't
 know it specifically but I can certainly picture its setting.  I
 would think that was one of the better locations on all of the North
 Shore -- private, quiet and refined.
 I really appreciate your generous remarks on my presentation.
 As you can see from the media, it isn't all easy sailing but I am
 confident we are moving in the right direction.  The support of
 friends like you is most helpful and I am grateful for it.
 Hope we'll be able to get together more in 1978.  Again, thanks
 and all the best.

 Dear Stan,
 It was a real pleasure seeing you and Pat again, and
 I appreciated your kind note advising of your being in town for
 a presentation.  Woody was sorry she didn't get to see you both
 but perhaps we can arrange our getting together on your next
 trip.
 I really didn't have the opportunity to explain that we
 are currently living in Lake Forest but have just purchased an
 older home (1926) on Exmoor, and are in the process of re-
 modeling.                                     It is one of the few "Mediterranean culture" homes
 in the area and, although not large, is an extremely interesting
 structure. It was built by the Hogue family, so perhaps you
 know it.   We hope to move in around the first of the year and
 look forward to showing it to you and Pat.
 Stan, I am sure you have received fine reports on
 your presentation, but I would like to add mine, too.  I have
 talked with several of the attendees and they all are favorably
 impressed.  I am sure that you recognize that, even among
 that group, there were those quite critical of some of the
 organization's past operations (as I am sure you are), yet
 all, I feel, were solidly behind a dynamic intelligence insti-
 tution. ,                        In my opinion your presentation instilled a confidence
 that you (probably of only a limited number of men) are the man
 able to bring that about.
 Kindest regards to you both,

 Thanks for your letter of July 20.
 -It now looks like John and I won't be coming to Washington
 regarding Mercersburg. John's health situation disinclines
 us to want him that far from home because his treatment
 regimen might suffer.  This isn't final until we see how he
 looks when he-returns from-two-weeks in California (working
 at our office there . )
 .We are--delighted to -learn-of-.your November 12-14 visit and
 -we-will be here..  We hope you can stilt with ?s . - we can
 even house a bodyguard-! Furthermore, I 'plan to achieve.
 tennis revenge! If appropriate, we would-like to have some
 of your friends in on Saturday night or Sunday afternoon.  Pat
 and Dorothy can work on that.
 We are having a .great summer here.  Dorothy just returned
 from. Denmark; Laura works at Harza-Chicago and will attend
 University of. Michigan this fall.  I am busy at the office, but
 still play tennis and. read books!

 Dear Cecil,
 How nice to hear from you and find.that you are busily
 and happily settled in Chicagoland.  Pat and I do look for-
 ward to coming your way in November.                    I'm afraid that I will
 not arrive in Chicago until Saturday afternoon, and hence
 will not have an opportunity to talk to your and the Navy's
 recruiters.  I am going to goof off on Saturday and Sunday
 with a long-time and close friend in Winnetka between
 speaking engagements Friday night at Wabash College in
 Indiana, Sunday night at the North Shore Unitarian Church
 in Highland Park, and Monday noon at-the Council on Foreign
 Relations in Chicago.  If there's time to get up to Fort
 Sheridan, we'll certainly give you a call and hope to drop
 by or at least say hello on the phone.
 I was most intrigued with the letter which Susie
 received from Hollins.  Enclosed is an initiative I took
 in response.  I haven't disclosed Susie's connection with
 me, and so I hope she won't be embarrassed.
 Do give my best to                   I enjoyed working
 with him several times in the past.  All the best to you
 and-to Sally. We certainly miss seeing you regularly as.
 in Naples.

 Introduction
 This year marks the 55th anniversary of
 the founding of the Chicago Council on
 Foreign Relations. The past two years
 have been active ones for the Council,
 as both the popular and professional
 programs continue to expand.
 Membership remains high and has now
 averaged 22,000 for the last five years. In
 its professional work, the Council
 continues to devote substantial
 attention to problems related to the
 countries of the Organization for
 Economic Cooperation and Develop-
 ment. We continue our strong interest in
 international economic issues,
 especially in relation to Europe. We
 continue our long-time interest in Japan
 and a Council study group resulted in a
 second book on this subject--Japan and
 the New Asia, published in 1976.
 Another study group on the topic
 "The State in Europe" resulted in a
 book in 1977. The papers presented at
 the 1976 meeting of the Atlantic
 Conference series (which the Council
 administers) resulted in the book
 Detente and the Atlantic Nations, also
 published in 1977.
 Program
 The Council has continued the diversi-
 fication of its large popular program.
 More resources have been devoted
 during the past two years to
 programming in both the Western and
 Northern suburbs, where approximately
 half of the Council's members reside. In
 addition, we have scheduled a series of
 small invitational meetings for members
 to give them,an opportunity for
 intensive discussions with visiting
 experts. Over the past two years, the
 Council has featured appearances by an
 increasing number of major political
 figures. During the Presidential election
 year, Governor Jimmy Carter, President
 Gerald Ford, and Secretary of State
 Henry Kissinger appeared within a brief
 period of time in the spring of 1976. The
 Council's highly successful Forum
 program for younger members continues
 to offer over forty meetings a year for
 discussion of a wide variety of topics.
 The last two years have witnessed
 important changes in the United States
 government regulations governing
 overseas travel and in the travel industry
 generally. The Council has responded by
 strengthening its program to meet
 increased competition and a new set of
 circumstances. In addition to offering
 affinity charters, the Council's Travel
 Department offers a wide variety of non-
 affinity charters and low to medium
 priced programs as well as luxury tours.
 As part of this program, over 4,000
 Council members travel each year and
 participate in the briefings, seminars,
 and lectures that precede and follow
 departures. The Council remains strong
 in the travel field because of a long-
 established record of high quality and
 reliability, because considerable
 resources are devoted to providing
 unusally appealing travel opportunities,
 and because of the outstanding leader-
 ship provided by Travel Director
 Loesken van der Poel.
 Finances
 The Council financial structure is strong,
 reflected in a greatly enlarged program
 and budget. The program budget has
 tripled since the beginning of the
 decade and now regularly totals over $1
 million per year. The continuing high
 level of general membership, the
 successful travel program, substantially
 increased corporate support and grants
 from domestic and foreign foundations
 have enabled the Council to avoid any
 deficits, a position that has been main-
 tained over the last decade. Under the
 leadership of John D. Gray, Chairman of
 the Board, corporate financial support
 has increased substantially.
 In addition to the support the Council
 has received from national foundations
 in the United States and from European
 foundations, we are now turning to local
 foundations for support for the
 community-oriented aspects of our
 work. The Field Foundation of Illinois
 has taken the lead with a substantial
 grant received in the summer of 1977.
 We are also asking assistance from indi-
 viduals capable of higher levels of
 support. With this in mind, we have
 introduced a new category of general
 membership--that of Contributing
 Member--in the hope that a substantial
 percentage of Council members will be
 able to increase their financial support.
 I would like to express my special thanks
 to John D. Gray for his strong support as
 Chairman of the Board, to Augustin S.
 Hart for his continued leadership as
 Chairman of the Board (1974-1975) and
 Chairman of the Advisory Board from
 1976 to the present. I also want to thank
 the members of the Board, Patrons and
 Sponsors and other members who have
 contributed so much to the success of
 the Council's work. Among those whose
 devoted service over the past two years
 warrants special recognition, I would
 like to mention two Board members
 who have left the Chicago area this past
 year. First, Lawrence C. McQuade, who
 served as Vice Chairman and Chairman
 of the Program Committee and did
 immensely valuable work during a
 period of five years in which the
 Council's popular and professional
 programs were strengthened; second,
 Peter T. Jones, who made an
 outstanding contribution as Assistant
 Treasurer, again over a period of five
 years, working closely with the
 Treasurer, David J. Rosso, in maintaining
 the strong financial position of the
 Council.
 I would also like to thank the members
 of the Staff who worked so diligently to
 develop and implement the expanding
 program. During the past year there has
 been a change in program leadership
 with Arthur Cyr succeeding Ian David
 Mellon. After making a major
 contribution to the work of the Council
 over a period of six years, David Mellon
 left the Chicago area to take a position
 overseas. His successor, Dr. Cyr,
 brings to the Council's program a
 distinguished record at Harvard, the
 Ford Foundation, and UCLA and has
 already demonstrated an ability to
 provide the kind of professional leader-
 ship required. I want to thank my
 colleague, Paul Kedrok, who has made a
 substantial contribution to the
 administrative and operational side of
 the Council during the past five years as
 a Program Officer and as the Director of
 Administration and Operations.

 Detente and the
 Atlantic Nations:
 The Atlantic Conference
 The third in the series of biennial
 Atlantic Conferences sponsored by the
 Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
 was held from November 18-21 at Sea
 Island, Georgia. As with earlier meet-
 ings, this gathering provided an oppor-
 tunity for prominent and influential
 leaders from government, politics,
 academia and other professions to
 discuss important international issues
 candidly in a setting removed from
 public attention.
 The papers produced for discussion
 at the November 1976 Atlantic
 Conference were published by the
 Council in the spring of 1977 under
 the title Detente and the Atlantic
 Nations. The publication was
 disseminated both nationally and
 internationally as well as being
 made available to Council members.
 The book resulting from the conference,
 entitled Detente and the Atlantic
 Nations, contains the papers discussed.
 They include: "U.S. Relations with
 Europe and Latin America in an Age of
 Detente," by Robert Hunter, Foreign
 Policy Advisor to Senator Edward
 Kennedy, who now has responsibility for
 Western Europe on the National Security
 Council staff; "The Implications of
 Detente for Latin America: A Latin
 American View." by Mariano Grondona,
 Director of the Carta Politica in Buenos
 Aires, Argentina; "The Political and
 Strategic Implications for Western
 Europe of U.S.-Soviet Accomodation,"
 by Michel Tatu, Foreign Editor of
 Le Monde; and "The Implications of
 Detente for Canadian Foreign Policy,"
 by Albert Legault, Director General of
 the Quebec Center of International
 Relations.
 The overall planning of the conference
 series is handled in cooperation with
 a Steering Committee composed of
 senior leaders from North America, Latin
 America, and Western Europe. The
 Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
 has responsibility for the administration,
 planning and implementation of the
 international series and the Council's
 President serves as the Conference
 Director.
 Senators Adlai Stevenson (D-Illinois) and
 Charles McC. Mathias (R-Maryland)
 currently serve as Co-Chairmen of the
 conference series. Their introduction to
 the conference book provides a useful
 summary of the discussions at Sea Is-
 land:
 "The Atlantic Conference meetings
 bring together.... individuals from the
 three regions to address issues that are
 commonly shared. While there is
 recognition that solutions to many of
 the political and economic problems of
 Western countries can best be found on
 a bilateral basis, the conference permits
 a multilateral approach to discussion of
 those subjects that affect the entire
 Atlantic community. Meetings, there-
 fore, focus on themes of interest to the
 nations of the three regions, rather than
 attempting to deal with issues in more
 isolated terms....
 "By 1976 it had become clear that the
 policy of detente between the United
 States and the Soviet Union had also
 affected the state of affairs between the
 United States and both Western Europe
 and Latin America. Consequently, it was
 decided to devote the 1976 Atlantic
 Conference meeting to this topic. Earlier
 Atlantic Conferences have reflected the
 fact that economic issues have achieved
 increased international political impor-
 tance. The 1976 session illustrated that
 more traditional security and strategic
 considerations still play a significant
 role in relations among the three re-
 gions....
 "Several major conclusions emerged
 from the discussions at the Sea Island
 conference. Perhaps the most significant
 was the strong impression that detente is
 indeed a term that lacks precise
 definition despite the fact that the sub-
 ject has generated a great deal of inter-
 national attention. Although detente is
 frequently construed to apply primarily
 to military and related diplomatic
 agreements between the United States
 and the Soviet Union, it must also be
 understood in a broader context, one
 having serious implications for diverse
 policy areas and relations between the
 United States and individual countries
 of Western Europe and Latin America.
 No matter how significant the specific
 accords between the two superpowers
 may be, the process of private
 negotiation through which they were
 reached has complicated relations
 among the United States and other
 Western nations. In this sense, the term
 detente, in practical usage, encompasses
 both the narrow field of superpower
 strategic accomodation and the related
 broader changes in relationships among
 a number of nations.
 "The discussion, reflecting a major
 theme of the papers, included consider-
 able attention to the changing character
 of the international system. There was
 general agreement that divisions among
 different nations and alliances are
 becoming more complex. Both Western
 European allies and Latin American

 neighbors of the United States have
 been growing more uncertain and
 restive concerning the policies and gen-
 eral reliability of the superpowers...
 "While there was general agreement
 among conference participants that
 detente has been an important develop-
 ment in terms of overall impact on inter-
 national affairs, there were differences
 of opinion about the value of the
 specific agreements that have been
 reached between the United States and
 the Soviet Union. Some of the partici-
 pants felt that the SALT accords
 represent certain achievements that have
 helped to control the arms race and
 bring friendlier relations between the
 United States and the Soviet Union.
 Others argued that these agreements
 have been oversold, that they have not
 restricted the arms race in any signif-
 icant sense, and that the Cold War
 continues to characterize relations
 between the two most powerful
 antagonists in the international system."

 fie' r Policy 0ssues
 and the U.S. Eectuen
 The climax of the United States bi-
 centennial year included national
 elections, which resulted in a new
 President and other new leadership
 entering the senior ranks of the Execu-
 tive branch of government. The
 American Presidential race involved a
 large number of candidates and there
 were many others as well running for
 lesser national offices. After a wrenching
 decade of involvement in Southeast
 Asia, the Watergate scandals at home,
 and the growth in complexity of inter-
 national relations and in the number of
 nations in the international system, the
 electorate was faced with an important
 choice among proponents of new
 policies and defenders of past
 performance.
 The rhetoric of the campaign-including
 promises and predictions-and more
 thorough and dispassionate analysis as
 well, was heard at the Council meetings
 where candidates, foreign policy
 specialists, and others appeared
 regularly to discuss international re-
 lation issues, conflicts, and possible
 solutions. The debate over detente,
 related issues of defense and dis-
 armament, and the continuing unrest
 and instability in the Middle East and
 Africa claimed most attention. Even as
 the "old problems" remained unsolved,
 new ones arose to command attention;
 sovereignty over the Panama Canal,
 majority rule in Rhodesia, Cuban
 involvement in Angola, and the
 emphasis in the U.S. and elsewhere on
 the preservation of basic human rights
 around the world are some examples.
 Council members were exposed to a
 considerable range and diversity of
 points of view. Columbia University
 Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski (now
 President Carter's Special Assistant for
 National Security Affairs) and journalist
 and author William F. Buckley, Jr. were
 featured in a two-part evening series
 held in the northern suburbs in October
 and November 1975. An NBC panel of
 correspondents met at Rosary College in
 west suburban River Forest for "NBC
 News World Report" in January 1976. At
 this meeting over 700 members heard
 Garrick Utley, Tom Brokaw, Carole
 Simpson, Robert Jamieson, Steve
 Delaney, Richard Valariani and
 moderator Jane Pauley put the year 1975
 in perspective.
 Presidential Candidates and Foreign
 Policy Series
 Candidates for the Republican and
 Democratic Presidential nominations
 who appeared on a Council platform
 included President Gerald Ford,
 Governor Jimmy Carter and R. Sargent
 -Shriver.
 Before 2,500 Council Members on
 March 12, 1976, in the Grand Ballroom
 of the Palmer House, President Ford
 defended his defense budget request, his
 attempts to reduce the arms race
 through the Vladivostok agreement, the
 strengthening of foreign intelligence
 operations, and the Sinai Agreement
 concluded in September 1975. He told
 the audience "We stand for strength -
 our national strength that makes both
 peace and freedom secure for ourselves
 and for others - because that kind of
 strength is right and will certainly
 prevail".
 On March 15, 1976, Governor Jimmy
 Carter outlined his four basic principles
 for U.S. foreign policy. He told a noon
 Council audience that first, policies

 Foreign Policy" series.
 should be open, honest, compassionate
 and emerge from public debate and
 Congressional participation; second,
 people of other nations should be
 treated with dignity and respect; third,
 U.S. moral authority should be restored
 in the search for peace, arms control,
 and support of humanitarian aspirations
 of the world's peoples; and fourth,
 policies should aim at building a just
 and peaceful world order. Governor
 Carter in this speech went on record as
 favoring the Trident submarine program
 but was against production of the B-1
 manned bomber.
 Sargent Shriver's speech to the Council
 in February 1976 focused on internation-
 al economics. He proposed that the U.S.
 take the lead in rebuilding a stable inter-
 national economic order, urging "policy
 coordination in energy, raw materials,
 development and finance" and greater
 integration of third world countries into
 the economic system.

 Observations from the Fourth Estate
 Henry Brandon, veteran Washington
 correspondent of the Sunday Times of
 London, in an address before a Lecture
 Forum Series meeting in February 1976,
 blamed a lack of consensus in the U.S.
 on foreign policy for diminished
 American power worldwide. "This
 missing consensus divides the Congress,
 the press, and the nation and causes
 confusion about American foreign
 policy around the world," said Brandon.
 Max Frankel of the New York rimes
 addressed the same series in April and
 claimed that the main theme of the
 presidential candidates regarding
 foreign policy seemed to be criticism of
 Secretary of State Kissinger rather than
 discussion of the issues. On national
 security matters, Frankel criticized the
 notion that nuclear strength was the
 largest factor, saying "Our national
 security has always been our wealth, re-
 sources, trade, talent, and people."
 rime magazine's Editor-in-Chief Hedley
 Donovan addressed the Council's annual
 meeting in June 1976. He singled out
 detente with the Soviets as the most
 complex foreign policy issue of the
 presidential campaign and noted that
 "The hyperbole surrounding detente
 obscures the fact that detente was not a
 whole transformation of our relations
 with the Soviets, but rather a
 worthwhile, modest improvement of
 that relationship which included
 prospects for some further steps toward
 strategic arms limitations and improved
 trade."
 The Secretary of State Speaks
 for Himself
 Henry Kissinger addressed a special
 Council luncheon at the Palmer House
 in July 1976 and warned that American
 foreign policy would be a factor con-
 tributing to world instability if its
 objectives and ideals changed every four
 years as a result of national elections.
 "Whether the process producing policy
 is solitary or done by committee, the
 nation will have to continue to engage
 itself in managing the transition from
 the post-war international order based
 primarily on defense against aggression
 to a new international system which
 adds to security the needs of economic
 cooperation and political consensus on
 a global scale."
 Election Aftermath
 "The Morning After" was assessed by
 Robert Hunter at a north suburban
 luncheon meeting held the day
 following the Presidential elections in
 November 1976. Senator Edward
 Kennedy's foreign policy advisor noted
 that in running U.S. foreign policy the
 "who" changed with the preceding day's
 results but the "what" remained the
 same because the key issues facing the
 new administration would continue to
 be a new arms control agreement with
 the Soviets, the emerging relationship
 with the People's Republic of China and
 stabilizing relations between the have
 and have-not nations in a global
 economy. Ford Foundation President
 McGeorge Bundy addressed the De-
 cember 1976 Lecture Forum audience on
 the dangers on the international scene
 confronting the new Administration. He
 warned of impending confrontation in
 the Middle East, deteriorating economic
 relations between the U.S. and its allies
 Great Britain and Italy and especially,
 "the unchained threat of nuclear
 proliferation."

 The Corporate
 Service Program of the Council
 In recent decades, and especially during
 the last decade, the city of Chicago has
 become increasingly important as a
 center of international trade and
 commerce. Consequently, the business
 community has assumed an expanding
 role in the overall program of the
 Council on Foreign Relations. In 1974 a
 specific Corporate Service Program was
 launched to address the needs
 and interests of business executives and
 firms in the Midwestern region. During
 the past two years the program has
 developed considerable impetus. A
 number of meetings have been held
 under this rubric, and - as indicated
 elsewhere in this report - corporate
 contributions to the Council have risen
 sharply. Among the benefits of
 corporate membership are invitations
 to additional private consultations,
 lunches, and dinners for visiting
 business and government leaders,
 complimentary individual memberships
 in the Council, and a complimentary
 subscription to the journal Foreign
 Policy.
 Meetings held recently indicate the
 range of concerns presently of strong
 interest to the business community and
 to the Corporate Service Program. In
 March 1977 a major half-day conference
 was held on the theme of "Bribery,
 Sensitive Payments, and Federal
 Regulations." Featured speakers
 included Stanley Sporkin, Director of
 Enforcement for the Securities and
 Exchange Commission, and Stanley
 Marcuss, then Counsel to the Senate
 International Finance Subcommittee,
 who has since become Deputy Assistant
 Secretary of Commerce for Domestic
 and International Business.
 Other Corporate Service sessions have
 addressed such topics as the complex
 and controversial trading relationship
 between the United States and Japan,
 the investment climates in Canada and
 Australia, recent economic
 developments in West Europe, and
 credit and related problems in doing
 business with the Soviet Union and
 Eastern Europe. Speakers and other
 featured participants at these meetings
 have included Robert Ingersoll, former
 Ambassador to Japan and a leader of the
 Chicago business and professional
 community; Harald Malmgren, a key
 trade official in the Johnson and Nixon
 Administrations; three senior
 economists from the Japan Economic
 Research Center; John Howard, Minister
 for Business and Consumer Affairs in
 Canada; Peter Such man, Deputy
 Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for
 Tariff Affairs; and Mario Barone,
 Managing Director of the Banco di
 Roma.
 These major meetings have been
 complemented by various private
 consultations for corporate members of
 the Council. Visiting officials who have
 been hosted at such consultations
 include Congressman Albert C. Ullman,
 Chairman of the House Ways and Means
 Committee; Ralph Pfeiffer, Jr., Chairman
 of IBM World Trade Americas/Far East
 Corporation; Senator William Proxmire
 Chairman of the Senate Banking
 Committee; Congressman Henry Reuss,
 Chairman of the House Banking
 Committee; and Congressman Dan
 Rostenkowski of the House Ways and
 Means Committee.
 Stanley Sporkin, Director, Enforcement
 Division of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission, spoke at the March 8, 1977
 conference on "Bribery, Sensitive
 Payments & Federal Regulation."
 A half-day conference sponsored by the
 Council's Corporate Service Program
 considered "United States and Japan:
 Partners or Competitors in International
 Trade?" on November 10, 1976 (above).
 Speakers included Hisao Kanamori of the
 Japan Economic Journal (left) and Harald

 Arms Control
 International Security
 and Detente
 Few issues compete in international
 importance with those concerning war,
 peace; security, and military
 competition. The Chicago Council on
 Foreign Relations has become
 increasingly involved in analysis of this
 subject. Different topics under the arms
 and security rubric have been addressed
 by a number of speakers in the course of
 the last two program years.
 Former Defense Secretary James
 Schlesinger, appearing before a north
 suburban Council dinner meeting in
 March, 1976, warned that detente with
 James Schlesinger, former Secretary of
 Defense, addressing the March 10, 1976
 north suburban dinner meeting on
 "Defense & Detente."
 Paul Wamke, attorney and defense
 specialist addressing a noon meeting
 December 16, 1976 on the topic of U.S.-
 Soviet and U.S.-China affairs.
 the Soviets had not meant any cessation
 of military growth by the Warsaw Pact
 nations and that the U.S. defense budget
 was declining in real dollars as well as
 percentage of GNP while the Soviet
 capabilities were growing. Paul Warnke,
 former Assistant Secretary of Defense for
 International Security Affairs and now
 Director of the Arms Control and Dis-
 armament Agency, addressed a noon
 Council meeting in December 1976.
 Regarding reevaluations of U.S.
 estimates of Soviet military spending,
 Warnke asserted that "The Soviets have
 just about what we always thought they
 had; the surprise is that it is costing
 them twice as much as we had
 surmised."
 Views from the Senate
 A noon Council audience in October
 1976 heard Senator John Culver (D-lowa)
 deplore rapidly escalating arms sales
 worldwide saying "The end result of the
 massive build-up of indiscriminate arms
 sales around the world has definitely not
 increased stability and security, but has
 more often created tension, insecurity,
 and the heating up of traditional hos-
 tilities." He suggested that western
 nations develop forums and procedures
 for cooperation in limiting arms sales
 and the exportation of high-technology
 systems, particularly to developing
 nations.
 Senator John Tower (R-Texas) told the
 February 1977 Lecture Forum meeting
 that he felt liberals were responsible for
 a "new isolationism" in world affairs and
 called Americans "naive" regarding
 Soviet intentions. He advocated in-
 creased military spending by the U.S. to
 maintain superiority, adding that "Not
 only must we maintain our military
 capability, but also maintain the will to
 use it." In the opening lecture of that
 series in September, Senator Frank
 Church (D-Idaho) called for a nuclear
 weapons curb in the face of the energy
 shortage which was causing worldwide
 demands for nuclear reactors. Church
 warned that "Today we confront the
 worst peril yet in the unhappy history of
 man against the bomb ... the lure of
 enormous profits becomes overriding
 and considerations of arms control and
 environmental safety - even the spectre
 of nuclear war itself - give way."
 Detente was discussed by Senator Adlai
 Stevenson I I I (D-Illinois) and Charles
 McC. Mathias (R-Maryland) at an
 October 1976 Council dinner in the
 northern suburbs. Stevenson argued that
 detente as an objective was not arguable
 "but as a method it is a failure" and
 Mathias countered that he himself was
 an "absolute believer" in detente and
 that "without a relaxation of tensions
 the world cannot weather the next 30
 years."
 The Military Perspective
 Exponents of military viewpoints at
 Council meetings included Generals
 Alexander Haig and George Keegan and
 Admirals Gene La Rocque and Elmo
 Zumwalt. General Haig, Supreme Allied
 Commander for Europe, appeared at a
 western suburban dinner meeting in
 December 1976 and noted that "I would
 be less than frank if I didn't
 acknowledge that detente has caused
 problems for NATO members" and he
 stressed the importance of the
 "relentless growth of the Soviet military
 as a clear threat."
 Negotiating Security
 in the Face of Competition
 In November 1976, Fred C. Ikle, Director
 of the Arms Control and Disarmament
 Agency, warned from a Council platform
 that the new administration in
 Washington must learn two important
 lessons from the past 20 years of negoti-
 ating experience: "Agreements for the
 sake of agreements are not likely to
 encourage progress and we should be
 wary of expecting to achieve rapid
 results by substituting unilateral action
 for difficult and protracted negotia-
 tions." Marshall Shulman of Columbia
 University, Special Consultant to
 Secretary of State Vance on Soviet
 Affairs, addressed a north suburban
 dinner meeting in May 1977 and warned
 of U.S. complacency toward Soviet
 military competition and noted that the
 relative instability of new weaponry had
 increased in recent years.
 The Council sponsored a major one-day
 conference in April 1977 entitled "Issues
 in European Security", providing an
 opportunity to bring together specialists
 from the Midwest and beyond. Professor
 Sam C. Sarkesian of Loyola University
 chaired the proceedings and papers
 were presented by Professors Bernard
 Brodie and Roman Kolkowicz of UCLA,
 Professor Morton Kaplan of the
 University of Chicago, and Dr. Steven
 Canby of Washington. Professors Jeremy
 Azrael and Morris Janowitz of the
 University of Chicago served as
 commentators.

 Nearly 30 years have elapsed since the
 creation of the state of Israel and yet
 that nation's relations with its Arab
 neighbors continue to be a source of
 imminent confrontation not only for
 Middle Eastern countries but the world's
 larger powers as well. The last two years
 have witnessed considerable efforts by
 some of the parties involved to convene
 a Geneva Conference designed to
 provide a permanent peaceful
 settlement.
 Issues in the Middle East continue to be
 of priority interest to Council members.
 In October 1975 Senator Joseph Biden
 (D-Del.) addressed the North Suburban
 Luncheon Lecture Series and criticized
 Secretary of State Kissinger's concept of
 the United States as the "watchman of
 the free world" and announced at that
 meeting that the U.S. public should be
 told of the commitments involved in the
 Sinai Accords. As a member of the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
 Biden said he would personally disclose
 the contents of the Accords if the
 Committee refused to do so. On the
 same topic, Newsweek's Paris Bureau
 Chief Arnaud de Borchgrave told the
 Lecture Forum meeting the following
 month that the Sinai Accords were
 "over-simplified and oversold" and
 "bought time at an enormous cost to the
 U.S. Treasury with limited hopes of
 peace." From the same platform in
 December, Senator Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.)
 called for Western European
 governments to get involved in Middle
 East diplomacy and to support
 moderates over extremists, saying "a
 first step might be overt support for the
 Sinai agreement between Israel and
 Egypt."
 Journalist Edward R. F. Sheehan in
 February 1977 urged an immediate
 convening of a Middle East peace
 conference in Geneva. Sheehan's peace
 conference agenda as outlined to the
 North Suburban Luncheon meeting
 included solving the problem of a
 Palestinian homeland, returning Arab
 lands occupied since 1976 by Israel and
 "providing absolute guarantees of
 Israel's sovereignty within recognized
 borders." The following month a

 downtown noon lecture audience heard
 another journalist, Stephen Rosenfeld of
 the Washington Post, declare that "the
 rhythm of wars can be broken in the
 Middle East" and that "time was not on
 the side of the Israelis." Rosenfeld
 warned that delaying a settlement
 allowed Arab military capabilities to
 grow stronger. In April Egypt's
 Ambassador to the U.S., Ashraf Ghorbal,
 spoke at a noon meeting and renounced
 the continuation of a step-by-step
 approach to a Mideast settlement, say-
 ing "a total settlement must now be the

 in the Middle East, we must all be

 included a debate on the United
 Nation's resolution on Zionism and dis-
 cussion meetings focusing on the
 fighting in Lebanon and the future of
 Iran. "OPEC: Case Study of a Cartel" was
 the topic for a March dinner meeting in
 1977 and an evening devoted to
 Egyptian films was held in April of that
 year.
 Invitational dinner meetings focusing on
 the Mideast for Council Sponsors,

 The State
 in Europe
 The State in Europe, published by
 the Council in 1977, resulted from a
 four-part research study group held
 in the spring of the year.
 The Council's program has included
 increasing attention to the range of
 economic, political, social, and military
 issues which make Europe a significant
 region in international relations gener-
 ally and to United States foreign policy
 specifically. In recent years, the
 character of the relationship between
 Europe and the U.S. has grown more
 uncertain as post-World War II
 dependence on American power has
 waned and post-Vietnam War
 questioning of the role of the U.S. in the
 international system has grown. The
 future of such organizations as NATO
 and the European Community inevitably
 leads into a series of important, complex
 questions. Europe remains, both
 historically and currently, an area of
 direct military confrontation between
 the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Detente
 and accommodation between these two
 nations, combined with the Soviet
 military buildup in recent years, mean
 that the security environment in which
 Europe lives has changed in several
 ways.
 European specialists have addressed our
 audiences in both invitational and
 public meetings. A few of the most
 notable have been Piero Bassetti, former
 President of the region of Lombardy in
 Italy; Roy Jenkins, President of the
 Commission of the European
 Community; the Ambassadors to the
 U.S. from France and West Germany;
 Thierry de Montbrial, Chief of the Policy
 Planning Staff at the French Foreign
 Ministry; and Cesare Merlini of the
 Italian Institute for International Affairs
 (IAI). The Council was also pleased to
 host a group of Europeans visiting the
 U.S. under the auspices of the American
 Council for Young Political Leaders.
 Several in-depth substantive projects
 were undertaken during the 1976-77
 program year. A workshop on
 international affairs in the Mediter-
 ranean was cosponsored with the
 Council for European Studies. Presenta-
 tions were made by Professor Steven
 Warnecke of the City University of New
 York and Stefano Silvestri of IAI. A one-
 day conference was held on "Issues in
 European Security." A major four-part
 study seminar was sponsored in the
 spring on "The State in Europe,"
 resulting in a Council publication under
 that title. Chaired by Professor Kenneth
 Dam of the University of Chicago Law
 School, this series provided an oppor-
 tunity to examine the different inter-
 national, supranational, and subnational
 forces which bear on the viability of the
 nation-state in contemporary Western
 Europe. Papers were delivered by Pro-
 fessors James Caporaso and John
 Coverdale of Northwestern University,
 Leon Epstein of the University of
 Wisconsin, Catherine Kelleher of the
 University of Michigan, Frank Tachau of
 the University of Illinois, and Aristide
 Zolberg of the University of Chicago.

 Japan and the
 New Asia
 Japan and the New Asia, published
 by the Council in 1976 resulted from
 a study group held in the winter of
 1975-76.
 Council Board members and guests at the dinner preceding Edwin 0. Reischauer's
 address to the north suburban meeting In Wilmette on September 22, 1976. Reischauer
 (third from left) was formerly U.S. Ambassador to Japan.
 Participants at the second session of the "Japan and the New Asia" study group held
 December 9, 1975 featuring guest speaker Allen S. Whiting (third from right).
 Japan's continuing importance in world
 economic affairs has resulted in partic-
 ular prominence for that country in the
 Council's professional programs. Since
 the early 1970's, the Council has
 organized special study groups, confer-
 ences, and other meetings on Japan's
 international role. During the 1975-76
 program year, the third special study
 seminar on Japan was held. This effort,
 directed by Professor Ikira Iriye of the
 University of Chicago, was entitled
 "Japan and the New Asia." The study
 group addressed in turn Japan's relation-
 ships with China, the Soviet Union, and
 the United States. Essays were written by
 Professors James Morley and Marshall
 Shulman of Columbia University, Profes-
 sor Allen Whiting of the University of
 Michigan, and Yukio Matsuyama, Chief
 of the Washington Bureau of Asahi
 Shimbun.
 Beginning in the fall of 1976, another
 special series of meetings was held on
 Japan's economic situation, especially in
 regard to the United States. The audi-
 ences were composed primarily of
 American and Japanese business
 executives and these gatherings rein-
 forced and were in turn assisted by the
 Council's developing Corporate Service
 Program. Speakers included Noboru
 Hatakeyama of the Japan Trade Center
 in Chicago, Dr. Harald Malmgren, a
 trade policy official in the Johnson and
 Nixon Administrations, Professor Hugh
 Patrick of the Yale Growth Center, Peter
 Suchman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of
 the Treasury, and Ryohei Suzuki, Execu-
 tive Director of the Japan Trade Center
 in New York.
 Asian concerns received broad attention
 in the Council's popular membership
 program as well. Speakers in this vein
 included Professor Edwin Reischauer of
 Harvard University and arms control
 specialist Paul Warnke.

 Looking East
 After Vietnam
 The end of the United States' direct
 involvement in the Vietnam War in
 Southeast Asia brought with it unique
 problems and new questions. How does
 a great power deal with small develop-
 ing nations, often ideologically hostile,
 following a protracted military struggle?
 What policies toward the Asian coun-
 tries, especially a divided Korea and a
 united Vietnam, would be consistent
 with rapprochement with China and a
 continuing special relationship with
 Japan? How should the U.S. maintain its
 presence in the Pacific in the face of a
 complex and changing situation?
 Many Council guests addressed these
 issues in general and specific terms in
 the 1975-77 program years. Council
 President John E. Rielly traveled to
 China as a member of a delegation of
 heads of American foreign policy institu-
 tions and related his observations at a
 noon Council meeting in November
 1975. On China's role in Asia he noted:
 "Now that the U.S. has withdrawn from
 southeast Asia, China's principal
 concern is to prevent the Soviet Union
 from filling the vacuum created by
 American withdrawal."
 Richard Holbrooke, managing editor of
 Foreign Policy quarterly, (and now
 Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia
 and the Pacific), addressed the
 December 1975 north suburban
 Luncheon-Lecture meeting on the topic
 of Post-Vietnam policy in Asia. He
 described the end of the war there as a
 "liberating event for the U.S." and said
 that now the U.S. should provide "lead-
 ership without hegemony in the area."
 In January 1976 "Soviet Interests in the
 Pacific: A Soviet View -A Japanese
 View" was the theme under discussion
 at a noon meeting with Professor David
 Joravsky of Northwestern University and
 Professor Tetsuo Najita, director of the
 University of Chicago's Center for Far
 Eastern Studies. Professor Edwin O.
 Reischauer of Harvard University and
 former ambassador to Japan addressed a
 north suburban dinner meeting in
 September 1976. His talk concerned the
 current mood in in Japan following the
 Lockheed revelations and the aftermath
 of the oil embargo. He noted that
 "Japan's stability depends on the world's
 stability; if there are no wars in other
 parts of the world interfering with
 Japan's supply lines and if there is no
 reduction in trade, Japan will continue
 to flourish." At a luncheon meeting in
 the same suburban area in October,
 author David Halberstam supported the
 entry of Vietnam into the United
 Nations, declaring that "We are bad
 losers; if 800 million Chinese pose no
 threat in the UN balance, what could 30
 million Vietnamese change?"
 Council members heard reports from
 elsewhere in the east when India's
 Foreign Minister Y.B. Chavan defended
 India's "state of emergency" as necessary
 to prevent violence and anarchy and
 accused the foreign press of playing a
 political role as an "opposition party" to
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. One
 month later in November 1975, the
 Council Forum heard political
 anthropologist Ralph Nicholas of the
 University of Chicago discuss "The
 Future of Democracy in India."
 Democracy took its course in India, and
 in January 1977 the Committee on
 Foreign Affairs hosted a dinner at which
 Lloyd and Susanne Rudolph, political
 science professors from the University of
 Chicago, discussed "India After the
 Emergency: The Shape of the New
 Regime."
 Richard Holbrooke,
 Managing Editor, Foreign
 Policy, addressing the
 December 9, 1975 meeting

 Luncheon Lecture Series.
 The Chicago Committee's focus on Asia
 included presentations by Adam Malik,
 Foreign Minister of Indonesia, discussing
 "The Emerging Balance of Power in
 Southeast Asia" and Wall Street Journal
 editorial page editor Robert Bartley
 replying to the query "What does China
 Really Want?", in addition to a two-part
 luncheon series on "China: Policies,
 Perspectives, Projections."
 The Council's annual meeting in June
 1977 brought author Roxane Witke,
 whose interviews with Mao Tse-tung's
 widow were recently published. The
 granting of the interviews by Chiang
 Ch'ing were considered an indiscretion
 in China which, added to other charges,
 brought about the political downfall of
 the woman who was considered the
 most powerful force behind China's
 Cultural Revolution of the 1960's. In the
 summer of 1977, a delegation from the
 People's Republic of China's Foreign
 Affairs Institute visited the Council at a
 special luncheon hosted by Council
 President Reilly.

 Crisis in Africa: Majority Rule
 and Minority Rights
 The last several years have seen world-
 wide attention focused on several
 African nations engaged in internal
 political struggles. Support for various
 factions have ranged from Soviet aid to
 Ethiopian insurgents to the introduction
 of Cuban troops in Angola. In addition,
 the United States and Great Britain have
 engaged in serious efforts to bring about
 a peaceful transition of power from
 minority white to majority black rule in
 Rhodesia and Namibia. Council meet-
 ings have addressed these African issues
 in a variety of meetings and forums.
 The Chicago Tribune's photojournalism
 team of James Yuenger, Clarence Page
 and Ernie Cox, Jr. reported on their two
 months in southern Africa to a noon
 Council audience in September 1976
 and discussed "Africa: Crisis in Black
 and White." Ethiopian anthropologist
 Asmaron Legesse spoke before the
 March 1977 north suburban luncheon
 meeting where he deplored the colonial
 and outdated African educational
 system and the badly managed land
 reform programs, both of which he said
 contributed to the mass of jobless
 peasants and students creating the
 unrest in African cities.

 Chicago Committee heard State
 Department spokesman William E.
 Schaufele, Jr., Assistant Secretary of State
 for African Affairs discuss U.S. foreign
 policy toward Africa in May 1977.
 Former prime minister of Southern
 Rhodesia Garfield Todd spoke before an
 invitational luncheon meeting in June
 1977.
 Chicago Council members were invited
 to participate in the University of
 Chicago Extension Division's 1976 series
 "Africa: Understanding the Issues," an
 eight part lecture-discussion program for
 which Council members' fees were
 discounted.
 Senator Dick Clark (D-lowa) addressed
 the March 1977 Lecture Forum meeting
 on the subject of peace in Africa
 emphasizing that South Africa was the
 key to peaceful transitions of power in
 both Rhodesia and Namibia. "Majority
 rule will come," said Clark, "and U.S.
 policy should be to urge that the
 transition take place in a peaceful way."
 In April 1977, the outspoken U.S. Am-
 bassador to the United Nations Andrew
 Young met with members of the Chicago
 press for a news briefing sponsored by
 the Council.
 The Council Forum's panel discussion
 program in May 1976 "African Leader-

 The Chicago
 Committee
 The Chicago Committee, established in
 1962, is the senior invitational body of
 the Chicago Council on Foreign Rela-
 tions, with a membership including 450
 business, legal, academic, and other
 professional leaders from Chicago and
 the surrounding Middle West. In the last
 two years, the Committee has heard a
 wide range of speakers from this country
 and abroad. Chicago Committee ses-
 sions are off-the-record, which permits
 maximum candor in interchanges be-
 tween our visitors and the audience.
 During the fall of 1975, a special two-
 part luncheon series was held on Great
 Britain. Ambassadors Peter Ramsbotham
 and Elliott Richardson discussed respec-
 tively "Britain, the European Community
 and the U.S.A." and "Transatlantic
 Relations - the United States and Great
 Britain." In early 1976, a special series
 was held on China's role in international

 Committee on
 Foreign Affairs
 The Committee on Foreign Affairs
 undertakes a program series for a mem-
 bership drawn from among the younger
 business and professional leadership of
 the Chicago area. This program is
 designed for individuals with professional
 interest in international affairs and
 foreign policy questions. Through
 monthly off-the-record invitational
 meetings, featuring notable American
 and foreign visitors to the city,
 Committee members receive an
 opportunity to discuss a wide range of
 topics with key decision-makers,
 analysts, and opinion leaders.
 Foreign guest commentators have
 included Adalbert de Segonzac,
 Washington bureau chief of France Soir
 and Philip Windsor of the London
 School of Economics, both of whom
 offered critiques of United States foreign
 policy. Y.B. Chavan, the Foreign
 Minister of India, spoke on the emergen-
 cy measures instituted by the Ghandi
 government.
 Among American political figures, the
 Committee has played host to Senator
 Joseph R. Biden (D.-Del.), Senator
 Edmund Muskie (D.-Maine), Paul C.
 Warnke, just prior to his becoming
 Director of the Arms Control and
 Disarmament Agency, and Richard

 Council
 Forum
 In nearly 100 programs during the. past
 two years, the Council Forum has
 reviewed a broad range of international
 political, economic, and cultural issues.
 Through an evening lecture format,
 designed generally for younger Council
 members, the Forum has sponsored
 weekly evening meetings providing
 opportunities for informal discussions
 with experts from the Chicago area's
 universities and business community, as
 well as knowledgeable visitors from
 outside Chicago. During the 1975-1977
 program period, the Forum addressed
 such global problems as starvation,
 terrorism, human rights, human shelter,
 and the new international economic
 order. Many individual nations and their
 relations with the United States received
 attention in such programs as:
 "Canadian Nationalism," "Japan
 Rearmed," "Democracy in India,"
 "Communist Gains in Italy," "Economic
 and Political Problems in Britain,"
 "African Leadership," and others that
 focused on Turkey, China, Mexico,
 Cuba, Iran, Yugoslavia, Rhodesia, and
 Ireland.
 Ambassador Fernand Spaak, head of the
 delegation to the United States of the
 European Community; Dr. John L.

 Secondary Education
 Program for Teachers
 Council efforts to strengthen awareness
 of and information about international
 affairs include a specific program to
 bolster instruction at the secondary
 school level in the Chicago area.
 A variety of important topics was
 considered in the secondary education
 seminar series during the period 1975-77.
 Robert Oxnam, Program Director of the
 China Council of the Asia Society, led
 off a set of discussions on "The Politics
 and Culture of Modern China." The
 1976-77 program year was a particularly
 active one for the education program,
 with three separate series and one
 special individual meeting held. The
 three seminars, each of which involved
 four dinner meetings, dealt with
 Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and
 Latin America. In addition, a special
 meeting was held on developments in
 Japan in conjunction with the Japan
 Trade Center of Chicago. Featured
 speakers at these sessions, all of which
 were well attended, included Professors
 Philip Foster of the Comparative Educa-
 tion Center and Aristide Zolberg of the
 Political Science Department of the
 University of Chicago, James Yuenger
 and Clarence Page of the Chicago

 Council Travel
 Department
 The educational objective of the
 Chicago Council on Foreign Relations is
 quite naturally augmented by the broad-
 ranging schedule of travel programs
 offered by the Travel Department.
 Overseas travel is an appropriate means
 for providing dramatic first-hand
 exposure to and appreciation of world
 conditions.
 During the period 1975-1977 almost
 8,000 members participated in over 100
 Council trips. In addition to the low-cost
 air-transportation-only charter flights,
 the Travel Department offered members
 a wide choice of other itineraries from
 which to choose. These encompassed
 ocean cruises to intriguing ports-of-call,
 self-drive car tours which provided
 maximum independence upon arrival at
 the destination, deluxe fully-escorted
 travel opportunities designed to meet
 the needs of even the most
 discriminating traveller, and individually
 tailored and planned trips. Council
 travel programs explored important
 regions and fascinating corners of the
 world including Africa, Egypt, India, the
 Orient, Western and Eastern Europe,
 Central and South America, and other
 areas.
 Prior to the departures of many trips,
 participating members had the opportu-
 nity to attend briefings at the Council.
 Films, slides, and guest lectures provide
 a political, cultural, and economic
 overview and preview of the country or
 region to be visited. The meetings also
 give travellers an opportunity to meet
 one another. In certain instances, for
 example, a briefing may include dinner
 at an ethnic restaurant representing
 cuisine indigenous to destination
 countries. All of these pre-trip arrange-
 ments result in well informed travellers
 and encourage a relaxed and friendly
 atmosphere throughout the tour.
 Most often upon arrival, Council tour
 participants are briefed on local politics
 and economic conditions by the U.S.
 Ambassador or a staff member from the
 American embassy in foreign countries.
 Frequently local representatives from
 the government, political, cultural, or
 business sector will provide visitors with
 up-to-date information.
 Fast-paced modern life, with rapid
 scientific and technological changes,
 has greatly increased the already
 complex nature of international affairs.
 The observant traveller abroad is better
 able to comprehend the political envi-
 ronment in which we live. The Chicago
 Council on Foreign Relations, through
 an extensive travel program, continues
 to provide unique means for its
 members to follow the current interna-
 tional situation.
 Travel briefings at the Council precede most travel programs such as this meeting prior
 to the departure of the Council's Archaeological tour of the Greek Islands. At right,

 The
 Chairman's Message
 The Chicago Council on Foreign
 Relations is completing another active
 two-year period. It is a particular
 pleasure to be able to report that the
 Council has maintained a stable
 membership and an ambitious program
 despite the severe economic recession
 that occurred during this period. During
 the past two years considerable progress
 has been made in expanding our work
 and diversifying the ways in which we
 serve the greater Chicago community
 and surrounding Middle West.
 While the Council's national and inter-
 national reach has broadened, we
 remain principally a Chicago institution,
 with the mission of providing
 international affairs education to this
 city and region. The fact that Chicago
 has become an increasingly important
 center of international trade and
 commerce, especially in commodities,
 heavy industrial manufacturing and
 related areas has heightened the
 significance of foreign affairs to the
 business community here. In direct
 Chairman
 John D. Gray

 Mrs. Bernard G. Ziv, Jr.
 The Council is indeed fortunate that so
 many of Chicago's outstanding leaders
 in business, journalism, finance, and
 academia serve as active members of
 the board of directors. Their interest,
 support, and dedication are of inestima-
 ble value.
 As your Chairman, I would like to
 commend the Council's President and
 his associates on an outstanding per-
 formance. John Rielly has now served six
 years as Executive Director and
 President. Under his leadership, the
 Council has gained national and inter-
 national recognition as one of the
 leading private foreign policy organiza-
 tions in the United States. During the
 past six years, the Council's program has
 tripled in size and membership has
 increased substantially. The Council has
 never had a budget deficit.
 We look forward to continuing progress
 during the next two years.

 response to this development, the
 Council has launched a Corporate
 Service Program designed to address
 policy issues bearing on international
 business concerns and problems. In this
 connection, it is gratifying to report that
 corporate contributions have increased
 markedly over the past two years,
 supplementing income from other
 sources. This strong support from the
 business community is deeply appreciat-
 ed.
 The advent of a new national Admini-
 stration in Washington brings a new set
 of officials to government and plans for
 new approaches and departures in
 public policy. At the same time, many
 of the most significant issues confront-
 ing our nation remain the same
 regardless of whether the Executive
 Branch is in the hands of Democrats or
 Republicans. During this period of
 continuity and transition, the Chicago
 Council on Foreign Relations will
 continue the process of program
 expansion and development.

 Council
 Programs
 Mrs. Razie Liebow, North Suburban Committee Chairwoman (1975-76), and Mrs. Nancy
 Loth (right) Committee Chairwoman (1976-77) talk with Dr. Stan Ruby, Argonne
 Laboratories, after a Background Seminar session which preceded the
 December 1975 luncheon.
 The Council holds an annual meeting to
 elect its officers and directors In the spring
 of each year. Arthur E. Rasmussen, Chair-
 man of the Nominating Committee in 1975,
 chairs this annual meeting, introducing
 the new directors.
 In General... General Membership
 Programs for the Council's more than
 22,000 members number nearly 100 per
 year, including downtown, suburban,
 and Council Forum meetings. These
 meetings range from the popular down-
 town Lecture Forum Series and First
 Chicago Center Noon Series to evening
 lecture meetings and smaller dinner
 meetings in the city and suburbs.
 Conferences, seminars, and college
 courses for interested members are also
 co-sponsored by the Council with local
 universities.
 Council Forum programs are organized
 by the Council staff in consultation with
 a volunteer Steering Committee. The
 Council Forum is for younger adult
 members and meets some 40 times a
 year. The Forum sponsors meetings with
 local speakers with expertise on various
 topics as well as cultural programs
 involving foreign films, literature, and
 customs. Forum conferences, seminars,
 and dinner meetings complement the
 regular Council programming designed
 for larger groups.
 The Education Department
 programming is primarily aimed toward
 teachers, who in turn discuss interna-
 tional issues with their students. Other
 programs involve students, teachers, and
 parents.
 Travel Department programming
 includes charter flights and tours world-
 wide, which are preceded by informa-
 tive briefings at the Council. Members
 are made aware of economic, social,
 and political affairs of the foreign
 country to be visited, and Council
 travellers are often hosted by American
 and foreign officials at receptions and
 meetings overseas.
 Publications of the Council include its
 bi-monthly magazine, World Events, and
 a paperback series of books evolving
 from study groups held at the Council.
 The Council cooperates closely with
 Foreign Policy quarterly, particularly in
 seeking articles from Midwest writers.
 The President of the Council serves on
 the editorial board of Foreign Policy.
 The Council also publishes articles and
 reports generated by specific projects on
 an ad hoc basis.
 In Particular ... Corporate Service pro-
 gramming is geared to Midwest corpora-
 tions that support the Council
 financially. These meetings involve
 discussions with leaders in business,
 finance, and economics who have an
 international viewpoint. This program
 involves luncheon meetings as well as
 seminars and conferences.
 Chicago Committee programming
 includes some 30 meetings annually for
 Chicago's senior business, academic,
 and other professionals in off-the-record
 sessions with world leaders.
 Committee on Foreign Affairs program-
 ming involves younger Chicago profes-
 sionals who meet 15 times a year for
 dinner discussions, special seminars,
 and conferences on international issues.

 and their guests at Rosary College
 auditorium in Oakbrook gathered to hear
 an NBC panel give a news wrap-up of

 Sponsors, Patrons
 Contributing Members
 John Connally, former Secretary of the Treasury (left)
 meets with Council Sponsors, Patrons and Contributing
 Members at dinner prior to his lecture on March 24, 1977.
 Sponsors and Patrons of the Council are
 longstanding categories of supporters
 who contribute over and above the
 standard fifteen dollar membership fee.
 Sponsors give one hundred dollars each,
 and Patrons fifty dollars. In return for
 this additional financial support, the
 Council has endeavored to include
 Sponsors and Patrons in a number of
 special invitational programs. Normally
 these sessions are private receptions,
 luncheons and dinners. They provide a
 much more intimate atmosphere than
 the larger public meetings sponsored by
 the Council, and in consequence these
 supporters are afforded opportunities to
 meet with prominent guests on a one-to-
 one, individual basis.
 While the Council continues to
 encourage members to become
 Sponsors and Patrons, a new
 category was recently established.
 Contributing Members are those who
 pay twenty-five dollars per year to help
 An invitational luncheon preceding the NBC program in Oakbrook in 1976 gave Council
 contributing members an opportunity to talk with individual members of the news panel
 such as Tom Brokaw (third from left).
 General Alexander M. Haig (far left) at the dinner-lecture in December, 1976
 where Patrons and Sponsors met with him earlier at a private reception.
 support the work of the Council. Reflect-
 ing the strong interest in the activities of
 the organization on the part of many of
 our citizens, this new category has
 grown very rapidly. By the summer of
 1977, there were over one thousand-two
 hundred Contributing Members and the
 total is continuing to climb. As with
 Patrons and Sponsors, these Council
 supporters are invited to special private
 meetings with visiting speakers.
 Programs for these membership
 categories have included cocktail
 receptions with General Alexander M.
 Haig, Supreme Allied Commander,
 Europe; Senator Charles McC. Mathias,
 Republican of Maryland; Edwin 0.
 Reischauer, Professor at Harvard
 University and former U.S. Ambassador
 to Japan; and Marshall Shulman,
 Professor of Government at Columbia
 University and Special Consultant to the
 Secretary of State on Soviet Affairs.
 Dinners have featured Newsweek
 Magazine's Periscope Panel of corre-
 spondents Arnaud de Borchgrave,
 Malcolm MacPherson and Lloyd
 Norman; John B. Connally, former
 Secretary of the Treasury and Governor
 of Texas; Francisco Sa Carneiro,
 President of the Social Democratic Party
 of Portugal; and Roxane Witke,
 Professor of History at the State
 University of New York and author of
 the bestseller Comrade Chiang Ch'ing.
 In this period of inflation and resulting
 severe cost pressures, the Council is
 particularly pleased and grateful that so
 many members have elected to become
 supporters of the organization at a level
 well above that of regular dues. This sort
 of extra assistance is increasingly
 important to our ability to maintain an
 active and diverse program of public
 education and information on
 significant topics and issues in foreign
 affairs.

 b.  Monday morning -- Will Mrs. Turner come down from

 at the Standard Oil Building at 1200 for the reception.

 If yes, would you prefer t
 system to grow in other ways-  have become a world
 n
 power based on their military might.   L rg
 condition of rough military parity, the value of
 intelligence today is great.   Real advantages can
 accrue from acurately knowin   what your R,otential_
 adversary's stren     is and what he intends to do
 with it.   He seldom tells you this, but he does
 give it away in many small  ways, which, when watched
 over a long period of time, and pieced together-,
 can give you real advantages.   It is the kind of
 leverage that can turn the tide of battle.
 If you look past the military scene, there are
 other similar situations:
 Economics - 30 years ago - economically
 independent - today interdenendn_e  - energy situation
 lose shirt if not smart - power blocks - raw materials/
 trade leverage.
 -Politics - world different - from U.S. domination
 to situation today, even smallest evolving nations

 C.   Next several years critical - I'm confident, but alert
 Need understanding and support of Congress - which
 mtrtrrrs public.   Hence, we are carefully reappraising
 our policies regarding secrecy and openness-, looking
 for ways in which we can be more forthright with
 the public and at the same time ensure adequate
 secrecy to carry out our operations.
 As a first step, we have tried to be more
 accessible to 4he media.
 - Good Morning America - 60 Minutes
 - Interviews
 2.          We are also attempting to make more of
 product accessible to the public.   The publication
 of unclassified studies is one of our most important,
 substantative initiatives.   It stems from a c-onviction
 that the. Intelligence Community is working for the
 American people and that they deserve to share our
 results whenever that is possible.   We intend to
 publish in unclassified form the maximum amount of
 intelligence analysis that we can.

 To date we have published several major studies
 which I believe make an important contribution to
 public
 - World Steel Outlook
 - World Energy Situation
 Soviet/Chinese Energy Prospects
 Buil   'ng on these studies we have been looking at
 other asp cts of the Soviet econom    ike:
 demographic  actors,
 This has led to a recently completed study for the
 Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Soviet Economic
 Problems and Prospects. Let me describe - f avor what can share
 From the mid-1960`s until very recently, CIA
 viewed Soviet economic performance as adequate to allow
 the simultaneous achievement of the Soviet government's
 most important
 objectives - i.e.,
 o to catch up militarily with the US;
 o to provide regular, if unspectacu  r
 improvements in living conditions; and
 o to sustain investment needed for fairly
 rapid economic. growth.

 This study thoroughly re-examines these
 assumptions and comes to the conclusion that Soviet
 prospects are more 4jjA4 than at any time since Stalin
 death.
 1.   Dead end on productivity policy of increasing
 inputs of labor and capital.
 a.   Decreasing rate of growth of
 man owed - what there will be
 from traditionally rural, areas;
 precipitous labor shortage - 1960
 birth rates;
 b.   Rapid depletion of cheap, conveniently
 located mineral reserves:
 c.   Oil shortage caused by policy of increased
 output vice dP    rmpnt.of new sources.

 - Don't believe can do -no sin prod/effic improving

 - Instead difficult pragmatic choices
 1.                                   intense debate over military expenditures -
 manpower and investment
 2.   reduce oil exports to E. Europe, worsening

 Decisions likely - period leadership change
 One of the most important points which comes out of
 all this,  I believe,  is that these policy decisions
 which the Soviets must make in the near future, seem
 on the surface remote to our lies.   Yet, they will

 As we continue to make public more studies, I want to encourage
 future dialogues with both the academic and business communities.
 Same time, let me assure you, however, that we cannot and will
 not open everything up.  An essential ingredient of intelligence
 operations is the ability to preserve secrets.  Some of the
 information behind both the Soviet oil and economic forecasts
 was derived from secret sources which would be jeopardized in the
 future were we to reveal than.
 Thus, we cannot forget that while we move to improve the
 dialogue with the public and build public understanding and
 support for what we do in the defense of our country, we must
 ask and obtain the public's understanding in preserving that
 level of secrecy which is essential to these activities.
 In short, we are working in two directions at once.
 By declassifying information that need not be classified we
 are attempting to promote greater respect for genuinely
 secret information.

 Dear Stan:
 I imagine that you may have seen the article in the "Chronicle of
 Higher Education" already concerning your appearance at DePauw.
 But I thought that I would send along a xerox copy of it in any case.
 As you may know, this is a very important journal--indeed the most
 important journal--in higher education for you to have your views
 appear. I know that your comments will reach a wide and generally
 receptive audience.
 I also am happy to see the exceptionally good rendering of the
 DePauw sweatshirt.
 Sincerely,

 Dear Dick,
 Thanks so very much from both Patricia and
 me for a most enjoyable day on your beautiful
 campus.  The luncheon was delightful and I'm
 thankful for the opportunity to discuss with
 members of the academic community my role and
 the CIA's relationship with the academic com-
 munity.                        It was a step in what I hope will be
 ever improving relations between the intelligence
 community and academia.
 Pat certainly appreciated Donna taking her
 in tow while I went off to play tennis.  And my
 thanks to you for the sweatshirt -- I will wear
 it often on the courts here in Washington.
 Thanks again for such a perfect day.  It
 was good to see you again and that you are so
 comfortable in the new saddle.

 Dear Admiral Turner:

 November 16, 1977
 How can we thank you enough for your visit to the DePauw Uni-
 versity campus on last Friday, November 11?  You gave an excellent address,
 you answered questions not only following your address but also at the time
 of the luncheon and again at a news conference in a very sincere, straight-
 forward, open, and friendly fashion.  Naturally, there were some things that
 you could not easily discuss, and I am sure the audience and the questioners
 recognized the sensitivity of these issues.  Nevertheless, you generated an
 atmosphere of friendliness, openness, reliability, and trust which we were
 very happy, to feel.
 We were very glad that you were willing to have a news confer-
 ence as part of your visit, and I have heard a great deal of favorable comment
 on the impression that you made. there.  (Needless to say, we:-were very proud
 of the fact that you were willing to wear a DePauw sweat shirt during this con-
 ference, and it did show up on the television news.  I hope our friends at
 Wabash College were not too chagrined!)
 In addition, we were very glad to meet your, wife, and we hope
 that she enjoyed the trip here as much as you, apparently, did.  Also, we were
 pleased  to meet the members of your staff, all of whom made an excellent im-
 pression on all the neon1e with whom they dealt.  We are particularly indebted

 Even though you may receive these from other sources, I thought you would be
 interested in getting other copies.
 All in all we were very pleased with your visit and only hope that
 it went as well from your point of view as from ours.  We are honored that this
 is the first college campus that you have visited in your capacity as Director of
 Central Intelligence, and we hope that this will mark the beginning of a number
 of such invitations.  If you and perhaps other members of your staff make appear-
 ances on other college campuses such as you made here, I think that the result
 will be to..help greatly to dispel. the present unfortunate feelings of doubt that
 many Americans have about how intelligence is handled in this country.
 Please thank everyone on your staff who had any connection with
 your visit here.  And, most particularly, we extend to you our heartfelt thanks
 for coming.

 It was a special delight to have you and Pat here last Friday.  I
 know how difficult it is for you to get away for this kind of activity,
 but it is bound to pay off in the long run. We have a new generation
 which represents the possibility of much more responsible and saner
 leadership in the next several decades, and it is vital that they have
 some appreciation for the intelligence function.  I think that you
 argued your case with great skill, and I was genuinely pleased and
 relieved to see how well you were received.
 I saw the TV coverage Friday night and can report that it was well
 edited and given priority placement in local news programs. We did
 not make the national networks, but perhaps you were not interested
 in doing so!

 June 8, 1977
 After we had talked by telephone yesterday I suddenly remembered
 that I had not mentioned to you the fact that I need the title of Admiral Turner's
 address which he will give here on November 11.  I wonder, therefore, if you
 could send it in addition to biographical material and two or three glossy photo-
 graphs.
 It may be that the Admiral may not wish to confine himself to a title
 chosen now when the address will be given in November.  However, we have
 discovered that if we can publish the title of the address that a speaker is
 going to use this will increase attendance at the program; and since I have
 to get all the material to the printer, in about a month, so that the brochure
 can be ready for distribution at the beginning of the fall semester, I am afraid
 that I need something now.  Perhaps the Admiral could select some sort of
 title that would be broad enough that if he wished to change his entire address
 from what he might be thinking of giving now to something different he would
 still be able to use the same title. At any rate, I hope that he can give me
 something that I can print.
 Thank you very much for sending all these items to me and thanks
 again for telephoning me yesterday.

 Dear Professor Shumaker,
 Just a short note to reconfirm that I accept with pleasure
 your invitation for me to present a convocation address at
 DePauw University on 11 November 1977.
 As You mentioned in your correspondence
 I received a letter from
 extending an invitation to stay at their home while in Green-
 castle.  Unfortunately, as I have already told her, I will be
 leaving for Chicago shortly after my remarks and the question
 and answer session.
 In your letter of March 16th you raise the question of
 an honorarium.  Regulations prohibit government officials from
 accepting honoraria so there is no problem there.
 My staff will continue to be in touch with you to coordinate
 the final details.
 Thanks again and I look forward to seeing you in November.

 About two weeks ago my office mate here at DePauw University,~

 would be in touch with us later by letter concerning this date.

 I hope that                understood this message correctly, for we have STAT
 received no letter since that time.  Perhaps one is now on the way.
 At any rate, I would appreciate it very much if you could write us confirm-
 ing this date, for I have reserved it on our convocation calendar and am filling up
 other dates that I think I mentioned to you when we first talked.  We are overjoyed
 that Admiral Turner is coming, and we simply want to be sure that we have under-
 stood the arrangEm-erit correctly.
 If this date is now certain, would you please send us biographical material
 from which I can write up this program for a brochure which we publish at the begin-
 ning of each semester giving details about all our chapel and convocation programs?
 This brochure is then distributed to the members of the administration, faculty, stu-
 dent body, to a number of residents in this area, and to the mass media.  Also, I
 will need two or three glossy photographs of the Admiral, and I would appreciate it
 very much if you could also give me the exact title of his address which I can insert
 in the brochure.  We find that if we give the title of the address there is usually
 more student interest in the speaker.
 Thank you very much for all these kindnesses. I will be glad to attempt to
 answer all the questions that you might have relative to the Admiral's appearance
 here. We will need to know whether he desires housing and if so for what night
 or nights. In addition, as I think I said before, we will give a luncheon in his
 honor immediately after his address, to which we will invite interested members
 of the administration, faculty, and student body; and we would appreciateit very
 much if he would be willing to engage in a brief question and answer period at the
 close of this luncheon.  Furthermore, as the time approaches, we would need to

 Dear Merilyn,
 I'm sorry to be so late in responding to your last letter.
 I am just now finalizing plans for a trip to the Midwest this
 fall.  My staff has been in touch with Professor Shumaker saying
 I do intend to accept and am looking at 7 October or 11 November.
 As the trip is shaping up, I should be responding-to him shortly
 to propose 11 November.  I am certainly looking forward to speak-

 mentioned.
 Thank you for the kind offer for me to stay with you and

 Aide to Admiral Stansfield Turner
 The Central Intelligence Agency
 Langley, Virginia  23365
 Thank you so much for telephoning today in regard to our invitation to Admiral
 Turner to give a convocation address here at DePauw University next fall.  I am
 very sorry that I did not happen to be in the office at the time, for I would have
 liked to have talked with you.
 We appreciate very much your efforts                                     in
 seeing whether Admiral Turner will be able to come to DePauw to give this ad-
 dress.  I presume that you have my letter of invitation written to Admiral Turner
 on March 16.
 According to my secretary, Mrs. Margaret Chase, with whom you talked, you
 are attempting to organize or coordinate various speaking engagements here in
 the midwest for Admiral Turner during the fall, and your-are considering October
 7 as a possible date when he could come to DePauw.  I will hold this date open
 for Admiral Turner,,hoping that it will turn out to be satisfactory.  As I think I
 said in my letter of invitation, our convocations are regularly held from 11 till
 11:50 a.m. on Fridays, which is a class hour cleared particularly for convoca-
 tions.  We hope, therefore, that the Admiral can come either for Friday, October
 7, or for some other Friday.  Nevertheless, since in order to complete our con-
 vocation program it is necessary to schedule other events, I hope that you will
 be able to let us know shortly what he can do.  If October 7 is not satisfactory,
 please suggest some other time, and we will do our best to arrange our schedule
 to fit his convenience. We are very anxious to have him:
 STAT
 I think that the Admiral has received a letter from                           STAT
 here in Greencastle, who was a schoolmate of his many years ago, re- STAT
 peating the invitation that I have given and inviting Admiral Turner to stay at
 her home when he is here to give his address.
 STAT
 The couple have a lovely home just outside Greencastle and would love
 to entertain the Admiral there.  Of course, if he would prefer, we will be happy
 to house him in one of the specially decorated guest rooms of the University.

 Any special arrangements that you would like to make concerning the visit
 of the Admiral here we would be happy to attempt to comply with.
 Again, thank you so much for your efforts in our behalf. I hope that I may
 hear from you shortly.

 March 16, 1977
 Several persons here at DePauw University have suggested your name as a
 possible convocation speaker for the 1977-78 academic year. Also, Mrs.
 who, I believe, was one of your high-school class-          STAT
 mates, has also expressed to me a sincere desire to have you come to the Uni-
 versity for an address.                    Therefore, I would like to extend to you a sincere invi-
 tation to give an address to the faculty and student body of the University along
 with a good many people from Greencastle and from out of town on a date that is
 mutually convenient.                  ays that she is writing a personal note to     STAT
 you for this same reason.
 Since you may not have had occasion to learn much about DePauw University,
 I would like to remark that we are a co-educational institution related to the Meth-
 odist Church, consisting of the College of Liberal Arts, the School of Nursing, and
 the School of Music with the College of Liberal Arts being by far the largest of the
 three colleges.  The University was founded in 1837, and we believe we have al-
 ways maintained a reputation for high academic excellence. We have a well-
 selected student body of approximately 2, 200 and a highly trained faculty of about
 150. We are a residential college situated in an attractive town of about 8, 500
 inhabitants located midway between Indianapolis and Terre Haute, Indiana.
 We attempt to present only the very best in our convocation series; and in the
 past few years we have had the privilege of hearing such people as the Honorable
 Harold Macmillan, former Prime Minister of Great Britain; Mr. Charles Bohlen,
 former Ambassador and former Deputy Undersecretary of State; Her Excellency, Dr.
 Angie Brooks, President of the United Nations Genera l'Assembly, 24th Session;
 Mr. William H. Buckley, author and television personality; the Honorable Henry
 A. Blackmun, Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court; Dr. Russell Kirk, critic, essayist,
 and historian of ideas; Senator Margaret Chase Smith; Mr. David Brinkley, tele-
 vision news commentator; His Excellency, Dr. Miguel; A. Burelli, Ambassador from
 Venezuela to the United States; Senator Sam Irwin; Senators Birch Bayh and Richard
 Lugar; Dr. Vernon Jordan, Executive Director of the National Urban League; and
 many others.

 If you could come, I or someone else would meet you at the Indianapolis
 Airport, which is 35 miles from Greencastle, and drive you to the campus,where
 you would be housed in one of specially decorated guest rooms, and would return
 you to the airport in order to make your return flight. We would be responsible
 for meals and general hospitality,
 Convocations are normally held from 11 to 11:50 a.m. on Fridays. We would
 suggest that you might like to come the Thursday afternoon or evening before,
 stay overnight, address the convocation at 11:00 o'clock, stay for a luncheon
 which we would give in your honor immediately following the convocation and to
 which we would invite interested members of, the faculty, administration, and
 student body, and conclude with a brief question and answer period.  If you would
 rare to hnlri a news conference  at any time while you are hprt- _ wt- ???-1A 1,^ ??^r??
 which is a beautiful house situated on the outskirts of Greencastle, it       STAT
 would be perfectly satisfactory with us.
 Of course, the choice of your subject would be entirely up to you, but we
 presume that you might like to speak about the place of the CIA in the national
 government and in the world today.
 Would you please let us know at your early convenience whether you can come
 and also what honorarium you would desire. As I think I do not need to tell you,
 private colleges have been hard hit financially recently, and DePauw is no* ex-
 ception, although we have always stayed in the black.  We will pay your ex-
 penses, and we will try to give you a suitable honorarium.
 As far as dates are concerned, could we suggest as a starter all Fridays:
 September 16, October 7, or November 11?
 We will be greatly honored if you would find that you can accept our invitation
 to come to the campus.
 Sincerely,

 Monon tradition recalls bell brawl, close call
 By Steve Simpson
 The annual DePauw-Wabash clash has
 always been something more than an inter-
 collegiate football game.
 The rivalry for the Monon Bell has never
 failed to be intense. At times the emotions
 have been enough to empty the stands,
 resulting in a free-for-all.
 The game itself has been most impressive-
 ly marked by Wabash's success in snatching
 defeat from the jaws of victory, according to
 assistant football coach Ted Katula. He is
 able to recount, with uncanny accuracy,
 numerous instances of Wabash's failure in
 the stretch.
 On two occassions in recent years, the
 game has ended on the Wabash six-inch line,
 with a disappointed team going home to
 Crawfordsville, said Katula. DePauw has
 succeeded in bouncing back from pronounced
 halftime deficits, to take command in the last
 four or five minutes.
 The long-time coaching pair of Katula and
 Tom Mont are able to boast a 12-5-1 edge
 over Wabash in 18 years. Katula emphasizes
 that no matter how poorly DePauw per-
 forms, Wabash seems to consistently make a
 series of crucial errors in the very most
 undesirable stages of the game.
 Another characteristic of the Monon Bell
 classic is its unpredictability. Season records
 are discarded, and the contest is normally
 remarkably close. Good DePauw teams have
 lost to mediocre Wabash teams, and shaky
 DePauw line-ups have won against Wabash's
 best.
 It is really almost enough for a football
 coach to beat Wabash to be insured of long-
 evity. Previous losses pale against a win over
 Wabash. The Monon Bell game is widely
 considered to be the single most important
 athletic contest of the year on this campus.
 There are many other activities that
 characterize the build-up toward the contest.
 There are some legitimate ones-such as the
 ever-popular Monon Bell stage (which
 evolves into a DePauw-Wabash roast
 immediately following Happy Hour), and a
 few that are somewhat less legitimate-such
 as campus vandalism.
 Although the legitimacy is questionable,
 the vandalism is pretty much brought about
 by tradition. And the deans are always
 sweating it out.
 e DePauw
 Rush system to see changes
 ED, NOTE: The rush system at DePauw, as it currently exists, was one of the major concerns of President Rosser when he took office, and one of
 the issues he promised to deal with first.
 As a result, the CCC subcommittee on Greek institutions, Panhel, and KTK, have all begun an evaluation process of the current system, and
 possible options. The following stories are reports on what the three groups have discovered, and what recommendations are likely to evolve from
 their deliberations.
 Women ? s
 By Kim Fell
 Following Rosser's suggestion that rush not take
 place during the first three weeks of first semester,
 Panhel has begun to re-evaluate the restructure
 the rush system, said Nelle Barnhart, Panhel
 adviser. "Panhel will be looking into a lot of the
 processes that relate to rush," she added.
 The early rush period has caused concern among
 the administration about "the impact on the
 adjustment of the new student," she said. Panhel
 and the administration have questioned whether it
 is necessary to rush a new student in her first
 weeks on campus and what effect early rush has on
 the student's adjustment to DePauw as an
 academic institution.
 "The concern has lasted longer this year," she
 newly-elected Panhel President Karen Chestnut.
 Panhel has begun evaluating the system with
 particular attention to the upcoming spring rush,
 but Chestnut says these efforts will benefit the fall
 rush program as well.
 The National Panhellenic Council (NPC) offers
 suggested policies for collegiate Panhel groups in
 its "How to Guide for College Panhellenics."
 Although NPC serves only as an advisory board,
 not a central governing body, the handbook says,
 "NPC approves an early rush period."
 According to NPC, this policy is more beneficial
 to both the rushee and the chapter than a deferred
 rush. "Early pledging affords the fraternity
 chapters an opportunity to assist the new student
 in her adjustment to the campus, to make friends
 quickly, to become oriented to college soon after
 matriculation, . . . and encourage suitable activi-
 ties ... in conjunction with her academic work," the
 guide states.
 Increased tension because of anticipation of a
 later rush and problems of lower income for the
 chapter are two of NPC's reasons for rejecting the
 deferred rush policy.
 NPC also suggests a "less-structured rush."
 Although the handbook warns that informal rush
 requires more organization, it states, "The less
 formal program in which enjoyable and relaxed
 association  between  sorority  women  and
 rushees develop is so well planned that it appears
 Men's
 By John Banker
 and Mark Kollar
 Despite the problems caused by the current
 mens' housing situation Dean of Students, William
 McK. Wright says there is considerable concern
 expressed by various segments of the University
 about the effects of rush on incoming freshmen.
 One of the major points that has come under
 criticism is the distraction from the orientation
 program caused by rushing the first week. "Some
 freshmen become more concerned with rush than
 they are with registration or the other events of
 the first week," said Wright.
 The dean added that the University is trying to
 find ways of making rush more informal, and taking
 some of the pressure off the freshmen. "Rush week
 becomes DePauw hysteria," Wright said.
 He also added that the University must find a
 housing solution for the first week, since the
 University would have to house the rushees
 without depending on the Greencastle community.
 While Wright speculated that there might be
 some minor changes in the rush process, he said
 any major overhaul of the current system would
 probably have to wait until the 1979-80 school year.
 Petra Munro, a member of the CCC subcom-
 mittee on Greek Institutions, agreed with Wright
 about rush interference with University functions
 early in the semester, and said the subcommittee is
 not only concerned with effects of rush on
 orientation, but on academics, and the psycho-
 logical effects on the freshmen.
 One of the major problems, according to Munro is
 the emphasis the University inadvertently places
 on rush and Greek life-half of the orientation
 booklet given to incoming students is concerned
 with rush and the fraternities and sororities, she
 said.
 The attitude of the older students toward in-
 dependent life contributes to the social pressures
 the freshmen feel when they first arive.
 "When the freshmen get here they very quickly
 pick up a negative feeling about the dorms from the
 students already here. That makes getting into a
 fraternity or sorority even more imperative,"
 natural ... and results are great!"          Munro added.

 Six students charged $68
 for under-age drinking
 By John Taylor
 Six DePauw students arrested
 during Wednesday night's bar
 raids were each fined $25 plus
 $43 court costs yesterday after
 pleading guilty to charges filed in
 Greencastle criminal court.
 The three 19-year-olds and
 three 20-year-olds charged with
 the "crime of unlawful possession
 of alcoholic beverages by a
 minor" were arraigned in Put-
 nam County Circut Court under
 presiding Judge William Hamil-
 ton.
 Under the Indiana statute, the
 students could have been fined
 up to $50 each and sentenced for
 up to 30 days in the county jail,
 according to Hamilton.
 He added since no fake ID's
 were used by the students, the
 penalty was not as severe as it
 could have been.
 Prosecuting Attorney James
 Note: The next issue,
 The DePoon, is not to
 be taken seriously.
 Houck said, "We have to treat
 DePauw students like any other
 Putnam County resident." He
 said this was the first incident of
 this type involving University
 students this year, although
 there have been a "number of
 alcohol-related cases involving
 non-students of the same age."
 The students, five of whom
 were taken from Charlie Brown's
 and one from Old Topper Tavern,
 said in court that no one had
 checked for identification at
 either establishment.
 Hamilton said there is some
 discrepancy as to who served the
 student at Topper's since the
 student said he could not identify
 that person.
 He added a waitress may be
 charged for serving minors at
 Charlie Brown's.

 Monon traditions
 (Continued from page 1)
 The bell itself has a colorful
 history. Theft of the bell by the
 have-nots is demanded by tradi-
 tion, and the attempts have good
 records of success. Both schools
 have tried to maintain a secure
 hold on the elusive bell, but that
 has not always been enough.
 The bell-when housed by De-
 Pauw-has found itself lodged in
 a warehouse, and several of the
 campus fraternities. (SAE is
 hoping to get a grip on the bell
 Saturday afternoon, with all
 good luck prevailing.)

 thefts have been quite elaborate.
 Upon one notable occasion, a
 former DePauw president was
 hoodwinked by a group of
 Wabash men posing as a Mexican
 ambassador and his entourage.
 The contingent was led to the
 bell, and it was later found
 missing.
 Halftime at the contest used to
 be a signal for the DePauw
 freshmen to meet the Wabash
 freshmen on the fifty-yard line
 for an unfriendly little brawl. But
 things have calmed down some-
 what-at least recently-due
 largely to a  tighter  security
 force. Also conducive to the
 mass hysteria has been Wabash's
 persistence-if not fetish-with
 the theft of the tiger tail.
 It is apparent that the Monon
 Bell classic has a rich and colorful
 history, but it also is able to
 expect a good future. There is
 now a push toward the expansion
 of the Monon Bell activities and
 traditions. But all of the tradi-
 tions, activities, and intensity are
 due to culminate at the opening
 kick-off.

 'Antigone' and Joel;
 two timely events
 By Christopher Portelli
 Two shows will occupy two
 stages in the PAC Friday night, a
 situation that could mean as
 much as a half-hour tone-down of
 piano man Billy Joel's music,
 according to PAC director Ted
 Giatas.
 The DePauw Theater pro-
 duction of "Antigone" is schedul-
 ed to open its four-performance
 run Friday at 8 p.m. in The
 Theatre of the PAC. "An Even-
 ing with Billy Joel," a concert
 sponsored by the UB Boards,
 begins at 9 p.m. in Kresge
 Auditorium. "Antigone" had
 been slated for that time long
 before the concert organizers
 were given the okay to stage Joel
 in Kresge, said Giatas.
 The concurrent performances
 bring up one of many problems
 faced by having all three major
 performing facilities (The Thea.
 ter, Kresge Auditorium and
 Recital Hall) grouped together,
 said Giatas. Although the set-up
 has its advantages, a case like
 this highlights the disadvantages
 he added.
 "Antigone," a production that
 runs for about an hour and a half,
 will still be in performance when
 Joel's first set is scheduled to
 begin. Since the two performing
 Gobin presents
 George Ogle
 George Ogle, visiting pro
 fessor of Christian Mission at the
 Chandler School of Teology of
 Emory University at Atlanta,
 will speak on "The Liberty of the
 Cross" at tomorrow's 10 a.m.
 chapel in Gobin Church.
 Ogle served as United Metho-
 dist missionary to Korea from
 1954 to 1974, working as a
 teacher and consultant in labor
 and industrial relations. Known
 as "the missionary who knew too
 much," Ogle was arrested by the
 Korean CIA because of his active
 support of Korean workers and
 political prisoners. He was de-
 ported from Korea in 1974.
 halls are close together, there
 has been speculation that Joel's
 music would be heard in The
 Theatre.
 However, said Giatas, "every
 measure" will be taken to ensure
 that one show does not interfere
 with the other. A sound test will
 be run before curtain time in the
 Theater. Any sound carryover
 problem that might be found will
 be solved by adjusting the
 decibel level of Joel's audio
 equipment-which is extensive
 enough to require removing rows
 of seats in Kresge to make room
 for it-to accomodate "Antigone"
 until that performance has
 ended.
 "Fortunately for both sides, it
 will only be a matter of 20 to 30
 minutes of concurrent perform-
 ance," said Giatas.

 AN EARTHEN DAM collasped in Toccoa, Georgia, leaving 37
 persons dead, two missing and presumed dead, and 60 injured. The
 wall of water tumbled down on Toccoa Falls Bible College at 2 a.m.,
 catching the small campus asleep.
 First Lady Rosalynn Carter flew to the area Sunday to inspect
 the damage. The dam burst came after two days of torrential rains,
 and three days after the dam had been inspected. Georgia Gov.

 ALSO CONCERNING SOUTH KOREA. The Center for Inter-

 fifth largest army in the world and is capable of defending itself.
 The report says the South Korean regular army outnumbers the
 north Koreans by 140,000, and the reserve army is 900,000 men
 stronger. The report concludes that because the Koreans are able to
 defend themselves, there is no need for the Carter administration to
 make security override human rights in the US dealings with the
 Asiah country.

 Students serve
 as part-time
 bros, sisters
 By Ann Daly
 Big Brothers and Big Sisters
 are not found just in fraternity
 houses, but also in the Green-
 castle community.
 Big Brothers and Big Sisters is
 a group of about 25 DePauw
 students, each paired with a child
 from the community to serve as a
 part-time surrogate sibling.
 Although some plans are made
 for the organization, the DePauw
 student is responsible for plan-
 ning most of the individual activi-
 ties with the youngster.
 Such activities may include
 going to a DePauw football
 game, window-shopping at G.C.
 Murphy, or studying together.
 Even though the Big Brothers
 and Big Sisters are checked
 every so often, emphasis is on
 the individual's responsibility to
 see the child.
 Last  Tuesday,  the  local
 children participating arrived at
 Sigma Chi for a haunted house-
 style Halloween party.
 The organization serves just as
 a means of establishing the pro-
 gram, said Brown. "It's one-to-
 one relationship," she added.
 "It's what you want to make it."

 hest-selling lakes ret urns to alma mater
 --from the podium             across the table
 By Jean Rudolph
 Publishing is a "red hot industry"  that is
 becoming "lukewarm," according to John Jakes,
 noted author of the American Bicentennial series of
 novels, at Friday's 11 a.m. convocation in The
 Theater of the Performing Arts Center.
 Speaking on "Publishing - Last of the Lukewarm
 Rebels," Jakes said the publishing industry has
 long been and still remains a "vigorous medium of
 thought and unpopular opinion" relatively free
 from outside pressure. However, he said the "rebel
 streak" in writing "is in danger of being watered
 down."
 Jakes said that a growing "trend to bigness" in
 publishing could affect what Americans are allowed
 to read and to decide on public issues. The merger,
 acquisition, and control of publishing companies by
 By Sherrie Swan
 John Jakes puts away an average of four pounds
 of peanut butter every week. Admittedly, the
 best-selling author has a wife and daughter at home
 to help him out, but he says, "I think the whole
 human race could survive on beer, peanut butter
 and milk."
 Though he only "smoked Trues with a water-pie
 filter," Jakes, like many who make a living behind a
 typewriter, was formerly victimized by the
 "physical association of writing with tobacco." But
 after being hospitalized last July for the removal of
 a portion of a lung, Jakes, who said "I'd rather be
 alive than have another best-seller," switched to a
 less worrisome vice.
 the conglomerate is beginning to make publishing a major industry
 subject to outside pressure, he said.
 Publishing has always been a force for social change, Jakes said,
 and generally the changes have been positive. But "bigness has
 indeed come to publishing," Jakes said. Large corporations have come
 in and taken up "yet another profitable entity."
 Jakes said it has been estimated that seven mass paperback houses
 account for about 70 percent of the volume in the book industry. He
 said the efforts of the conglomerate structure to increase their profits
 may result in the difficult or controversail book to be left behind -
 either because it's not popular or "on orders from above." This may
 lead to the disappearance of the publishing philosophy that if a book is
 "good" but not expected to sell, it should be published anyway, he
 said.
 Jakes, a 1953 graduate of DePauw, has published approximately
 200 short stories and over 50 books of fiction and non-fiction. He is
 now completing the seventh book in his Bicentennial series, which has
 over 20 million copies in print.
 Jakes, whose historical novel series on the American Bicentennial
 has been the receipt of great critical acclaim and has over 20 million
 volumes in print, told a journalism class Wednesday afternoon that
 "writing started out as a hobby." While still an undergraduate of
 DePauw, he sold his first short story and later his first book.
 After going on to receive his Master's at Ohio State, Jakes went
 into advertising and continued to write, publishing over 200 short
 stories and 50 books. Since being approached by a literary packager
 in 1971 to put together the eight-volume series, Jakes has begun
 writing full-time, putting in between 12-14 hours a day in his
 basement office.
 His only concession to the resulting lack of privacy from the success
 of the series was to have an unlisted phone number installed, though
 he recalled a Sunday morning when "several, dear elderly ladies"
 rang the doorbell, presenting him with copies of his books which he
 duly autographed to the "clicks of an Instamatic."
 Writing is an "endless challenge," says Jakes. "You always hope
 that the next book in your head is the best one. The only satisfied
 author is one that is no longer writing."

 Clinical psychologist Marx
 counsels, provides services
 By Annemarie DeSanto
 After two months of keeping
 office hours next to campus
 security  headquarters, clinical
 psychologist Daniel Marx says he
 spends most of his time counsel-
 ing students.
 Students visited Marx's office
 most frequently during mid-
 terms, he said, when he saw
 approximately 25 to 30 students
 each week. During test time,
 anxiety about exams and concern
 over grades tend to amplify
 normal problems, he said, adding
 that the number of students he
 sees has decreased since fall
 break.
 While test anxiety is one of the
 most frequently-discussed pro-
 blem, Marx says another leader,
 particularly among female stu-
 dents, is concern about eating
 and dieting. In response to sug-
 gestions by Freshman Quad
 RA's, Marx's office organized a
 nutrition and dieting seminar
 that was presented last Wednes-
 day.
 Students also frequently come
 in to discuss social problems, said
 Marx. The fraternity-sorority
 system has both pros and cons,
 he said-while it fosters many
 social activities and provides an
 atmosphere in which to develop
 one's personality, it also creates
 conflicts between houses which
 can cause problems.
 Besides providing counseling
 services, the office has organized
 programs such as the diet and
 nutrition seminar for the benefit
 of students. Another seminar,
 which will deal with contracep-
 tion, will be presented Wednes-
 day, Nov. 30 at 7 p.m. in 318
 Harrison Hall. Marx says he also
 plans a seminar on the mental
 health needs of students, for
 faculty members.
 In his office, Marx has started
 a library consisting of materials
 covering subjects ranging from
 test anxiety to women's rights.
 He said he strongly urges stu-
 dents to feel free to come and
 talk to him or to take advantage
 of the materials in his library.
 While Marx says he is general-
 ly pleased with the campus'
 reaction to his office services, he
 added he thinks there may still
 be a hesitation among some stu-
 dents to come to his office.
 Marx says he encourages sug-
 gestions from students, RA's and
 faculty members about how his
 office may better serve the needs
 of DePauw.

 Grad school is 'go' for students
 By Melissa Young
 DePauw graduates rank above
 the national average in attending
 graduate schools, according to
 John Mohr, director of the
 Career Planning and Placement
 Center. However, he said, the
 number of graduates able to gain
 admittance into "big name" pro-
 fessional schools like Harvard
 and Yale is decreasing.
 This has resulted from an
 overall tightening of graduate
 school admissions caused partial-
 ly by what Mohr calls a "continu-
 ing press for students to get
 advanced training in most pro-
 fessional careers." Besides the
 increasing number of applica-
 tions for graduate school, Mohr
 said many schools are reducing
 the number of students they
 accept because of the tighter job
 market. They want to be sure
 their graduates will be able to
 find employment after they
 complete their studies.
 Mohr said many schools use a
 "formula system" in choosing
 prospective students. This sys-
 tem consists primarily of weight-
 ing test scores and under-
 graduate grade point average in
 varying combinations. The im-
 portance of test scores in admit-
 tance can also vary between
 graduate programs within an
 institution depending on what
 tests are required.
 According to Mohr, the figures
 for the immediate admission of
 DePauw graduates into graduate
 programs has not changed much
 over the last 20 years. The only
 major change has been the near
 doubling of the number of women
 continuing their educations.
 (Refer to table below.) However,
 Mohr said, these figures would
 be higher if they included stu-
 dents who waited several years
 before going to graduate school.
 When asked if there are disad-
 vantages to getting an advanced
 degree, Mohr said there is the
 danger of a person appearing
 "over-educated" for a job. Some
 employers may not want to pay
 the extra money for a person
 with a graduate degree when
 they could hire someone with
 less education for less money.
 But, Mohr said, most good firms
 will hire a person with an
 advanced degree despite this be-
 cause they would be getting a
 "more qualified" employee.

 Dmitri's act: silence was golden
 By Christopher Portelli
 Dimitri, the world's celebrated
 mime,  musician,  comedian,
 clown, entertained a packed
 Kresge auditorium Saturday
 night in a style and quality
 beyond description. Whether
 juggling, singing, yodeling, or
 leaping into space, the master
 entertainer never ceased to
 amaze.
 It's hard to criticize this unique
 form of performance because of
 its rarity. There really is nothing
 to compare with Dimitri's in-
 tricate combination of mime,
 music, and mayhem. A stu-
 dent and co-worker of Marcel
 Marceau, Dimitri has since
 established himself as a form of
 entertainment in his own right.
 In two hours that passed like
 minutes, Dimitri gave a varied
 and colorful program. Full of
 surprises and always original and
 fresh in his "silent" delivery,
 Dimitri kept the audience laugh-
 ing, clapping and falling off their
 seats. "Never a dull moment" is
 too trite a phrase to capture the
 mood of the time spent being
 enthralled by such a performer.
 The stage was never a barrier
 for this clown, as Dimitri proved
 by leaping into the front row of
 seats to "recover" his instru-
 ments or ask the help of a lucky
 member of his audience. But just
 "what" did Dimitri "do?" It can't
 be put into words. To make an
 attempt, he made people laugh.
 In a word, Dimitri is laughter
 personified.
 When it was all over, the
 enthusiastic crowd was soon on
 its feet and brought Dimitri back
 for eight curtain calls. During
 one of the last, the master
 brought back a chair, sat down,
 and applauded his crowd! In the
 words of his teacher and friend
 Marcel Marceau.
 Antigone history:
 long line of conflict
 By Shelley Scott
 DePauw's upcoming produc-
 tion of "Antigone" carries a long
 and interesting history of adapta-
 tions. At a time when conflict
 between the laws of the state and
 the rights of the individual were
 evident in ancient Greece,
 Sophocles wrote the tradegy
 "Antigone."
 During the Nazi occupation of
 France in World War II, French
 playwright Jean Anouilh adapt-
 ed Sophocles' play. In his inter-
 pretation he maintained the con-
 flict between the individual and
 the tyranny of the State present
 in the  original;  however,  he
 directed symbolic references to
 the Nazi regime and the op-
 pressed French people.
 Despite the camouflaged sym-
 bolism that carries with it the
 hope of giving moral support to
 Anouilh's countrymen, the play
 was allowed to be staged.
 The style of performance
 featured minimal use of scenery
 and props, shifting the emphasis
 of the play towards language,
 character and theme rather than
 action.
 In the course of the Amerian
 translation of the play, the
 grounds of tension become those
 of philosophical values rather
 than the political values of the
 French original. The central
 issue is the meaning of life itself
 and the impossibility of holding
 onto one's purity in a world that
 demands and brings about com-
 promise.
 Beverly  Whitaker  Long
 directs the production that
 features Janet Baranko as the
 rebellious Antigone, Carter
 "Dimitri delivers to us his
 heart ... Under the spotlights he
 appears, with his poetic coun-
 tenance, bright as a star."
 After his breathtaking one-
 man-show it was this writer's
 pleasure to shake Dimitri's hand
 and wish him well on his con-
 tinuing America tour.

 College's "Arts'78" series will be
 the "Music for a While" group
 Wednesday, Nov. 9 at 8 p.m. in
 Ball Theater of the Humanities
 Center on the Wabash campus.
 Music for a While performs
 music from the Medieval period.
 Its members are all recognized
 masters of this idiom, several
 being one-time members of New
 York Pro Musica before the
 formation of the present group.
 Music for a While will perform
 "La Fontaine Amoureuse," a
 collection of works by com-
 poser/poet   Guillaume   de
 Machaut. Machaut who died in
 1377, left behind poetry and
 music that makes him an extra-
 ordinary figure in the history of
 both these arts.
 In "La Fontaine Amoureuse,"
 a dramatization of Machaut's life,
 Machaut becomes an allegorical
 figure of the artist, whose self is
 made of many elements. The
 program begins with Machaut
 "unselving" in the prologues,
 until he is himself, a poet and
 musician, in joyful celebration of
 his art. The story then pro-
 gresses chronologically through
 Machaut's life, into his waning
 years.
 Tickets for the performance
 may be obtained at the Humani-
 ties Center box office. Tickets
 are $3 for adults and $2 for
 non-Wabash students.

 womens' rush
 (Continued from page 1)
 DePauw Panhel currently is
 seeking to make rush more
 informal by eliminating unneces-
 sary             rules  while  retaining
 "enough structure to avoid dirty
 rush" said Barnhart.
 Panhel is also attempting to
 find more "creative" ways of
 "deformalizing the parties," said
 Barnhart. "They are trying to
 experiment with something dif-
 ferent for spring rush."
 Panhel is evaluating the quota
 system in each house as well.
 Barnhart said Panhel would like
 to see each house participate in
 spring rush, which would mean
 more accurate estimates of house
 openings would have to be made.
 Panhel is also hoping to devise
 a better bid-matching system
 and a better way of delivering
 these bids. The efficiency of
 these systems would be bene-
 ficial to filling the quota of each
 house as well, states on NPC
 booklet.
 Five Panhel committees are
 currently preparing several new
 proposals as alternatives to all
 these aspects of rush, which will
 be reported to Panhel at its
 Thursday meeting.
 "Panhel is trying to  be
 attentive to the concerns ex-
 pressed by the  people                    on
 campus," said Barnhart. Panhel
 is seeking students' ideas for new
 options, said Chestnut. "It's
 really important that we get
 input  from everybody on
 campus-not just the administra-
 tion, not just the Panhel presi-
 dent-everybody."

 THE DEPAUW
 U. of Utah moves t o
 lower grade inflation
 A new regulation at the Uni-
 versity of Utah may be one of the
 first moves of its kind in the
 country to help "cool off some of
 the high grading practices,"
 according to Pete Gardner, vice
 president for academic affairs for
 the University of Utah.
 Beginning with the current
 quarter, letter grades on student
 transcripts will be followed by
 the average grade all students
 received in the class. It will be a
 numerical equivalent based on a
 four-point scale and will appear
 on both the report card and
 transcript.
 "This is not a mechanism for
 solving the problem, but a step in
 that direction," said Gardner.
 "The grade which prospective
 employers or professional school
 admission committees are seeing
 on a student's transcript is not an
 accurate measure of his achieve-
 ment."
 "The new procedure-recom-
 mended by the  University
 Senate-will better reflect a stu-
 dent's scholastic ability. It will
 allow students to evaluate their
 relative performance realistical-
 ly,  and also will be of value to
 honor societies, seriously con-
 cerned with academic achieve-
 ment."
 Gardner says the real impact
 of the new regulations will be felt
 in the graduate schools where
 entrance requirements are high-
 ly competitive.

 WHEN DO CHEERLEADERS
 SAY BUDWEISER??
 It isn't until the students
 change their opinion of the dorms
 that there can be a de-emphasis
 of rush and Greek life, she said.
 Munro said the subcommittee
 had discussed several options to
 the current system, one being
 to have rush the week before
 orientation, and the other being
 to keep the freshmen in tempor-
 ary housing for another week,
 and rush after the orientation
 week.
 KTK President Craig Hutchin-
 son said he has reservations
 about altering the present sys-
 tem, and fears that some of the
 weaker houses might be jeopar-
 dized by tampering with the
 current system. Hutchinson says
 rush as it is now run does not
 distract students too much from
 orientation. Freshmen have
 enough free time during the
 week, and to delay rush until
 school started would be a
 "fiasco," he said.
 The KTK president said he
 opposes the idea of a lottery to
 place freshmen randomly in the
 houses until rush started on the
 grounds that it would run into
 contractual problems with the
 houses, and undermine the
 meaning of "fraternity."
 Hutchinson said the major
 problem isn't that the Greeks are
 so strong or over-emphasized,
 but that the alternatives are too
 weak. "I am wholeheartedly
 against de-emphasizing rush or
 the Greeks," he added.

 Rush evaluation needed
 The evaluation, and possible overhauling of the rush
 system is one of the toughest and most important decisions
 facing the University this year, and it looks like there is an
 honest effort being put forth to have the best interests of in-
 coming students protected.
 The most salient of these should be allowing the
 freshmen enough time to make the decision of where they
 want to live on fact and not hearsay, and to allow them the
 easiest transition to college life possible.
 And throwing rush at them in the opening weeks of the
 first semester seems to be the greatest evil they could be
 dealt.
 For the women, delaying rush isn't that difficult. But
 the proposed delay of just three weeks hardly seems long
 enough to really make any difference, and may serve to
 solidify rather than squelch the rumors that float around.
 For the men, moving rush week forward or backward
 one week doesn't change the central issue. The only solution
 is to adopt the lottery system, and give the freshmen a
 semester to decide where they want to spend the balance of
 their undergraduate career.
 With the lottery, all incoming men would be randomly
 assigned to fraternities for a period of time, and rush would
 be held later in the semester.
 It seems that if the true interests of the freshmen are
 considered, the University would opt to allow the freshman
 men the time to become settled in a new environment, with
 the new demands that are placed on them.
 The adjustment to college life is probably difficult
 enough without the added taxation of pledge programs, and
 everything else that goes with the Greek life.
 And the lottery might be a beginning to breaking down
 the barriers that exist between living units, and take away
 much of the competition that often is more destructive than
 constructive.
 Most universities allow their freshmen the chance to
 find their niche on the campus, and to deny DePauw
 freshmen the same opportunity is unfair.
 Yes, it will change the complexion of the fraternities
 and sororities, but until the University can provide enough
 housing to keep the freshman men in their own "quad," it is
 the only solution.
 The question boils down to one of whether Rosser, and
 the University, are going to be tied to the past by the size
 and control the Greeks have had, or whether the University
 can break from its past and move DePauw in the only sensi-
 ble direction
 Sign prank dangerous
 Editor:
 In the November 4 issue of The
 DePauw was a picture featuring
 a highway bridge weight limit
 sign gracing the front lawn of a
 campus sorority. While I am sure
 this little gambit had no mali-
 cious intent, it did carry with it
 some potnentially tragic over-
 tones,
 Most   DePauw   students
 probably are unaware that just
 three or four weeks ago a large
 truck loaded with crushed stone
 broke through a county bridge
 and fell several feet. The truck
 and bridge were demolished to
 the tune of many thousands of
 dollars, and it was only through
 exceptional good fortune that the
 driver was not killed or seriously
 injured. Investigation confirmed
 that a weight limit sign had been
 illegally taken from that site
 onlya day or so previously.
 Putnam County must spend,
 literally, thousands of dollars for
 appropriate road signs, the vast
 majority of which are required
 by law. It costs a small fortune
 simply to replace those which are
 "pilfered" or destroyed. While
 this is an unneccessary and un-
 fortunate economic cost, more
 important is the serious threat to
 the safety of those who use
 our roads. Most road signs serve
 a legitimate safety purpose, and
 anyone tampering with them can
 be contributing to the develop-
 ment of highway injury and
 death statistics.

 Illiterates-9 Digest
 By Mark Kollar and John Taylor
 The pipe organ in the Episco-
 pal chapel at the University of
 Miami (Florida) campus has been
 hitting quite a few "high notes"
 lately and for good reason. Last
 week 14 pipes valued at $600
 were reported stolen.
 University officials said they
 think a student may be stealing
 the pipes, which range in length
 "from three and one-half feet to
 the size of a cigarette holder," to
 use  as  marijuana  smoking
 "bongs."
 "Some students have told me
 that the pipes could be used as
 bongs," said Rev. Henry Minich.
 He added he was also told that by
 using the pipes for bongs a pot
 smoker "could inhale an extra
 strong dose."
 David Wike, U. of M.'s own
 Grover Vaughan, said that this
 year bongs and other marijuana
 paraphernalia have been out-
 lawed in the University dorms.
 Rumor has it that DePauw's
 NORML chapter will be meeting
 Letter
 at Gobin to discuss reorganiza-
 tion.
 RESEARCH DEPT: Green-
 castle has yet to report any
 missing organ pipes, but in the
 late 60's the perils of pot
 apparently hit the Old Gold.
 "Pot is all over this campus,"
 said former Putnam County
 Sheriff Robert Albright in a 1970
 interview with  The  DePauw.
 "The administration here is
 gutless and they won't get rid of
 the hippies," said Albright.
 "Those hippies are walking
 around pushing pot, and the
 administrators don't do anything
 about it," he added.
 "I believe in good government
 and law and order, and while I'm
 here those damn hippies are not
 going to get away with any-
 thing," he said.
 "Long hair signifies belli-
 terence and hatred of this
 country, and I'm going to fight
 it," said Albright.
 All right put this in your pipe
 and smoke it.
 Debate continues: a three-sided argument?
 Editor:
 In her recent commentary,
 Chris Boeke characterized the
 clash between the S.D.S. and the
 College Republicans as "The
 Great Fiasco," a title more
 appropriate, I think, to her
 editorial than our little exercize
 in rhetoric. While claiming to
 criticize, she has merely carried
 on the debate on behalf of the
 College Republicans, and with it
 the same weakness inherent in
 any argument that would call
 America a completely free soci-
 ety. It is true that O'Donavan
 and Haag were mistaken in
 saying that freedom is all in the
 mind, for indeed it is not.
 However, it is just as mistaken to
 say that freedom is entirely a
 matter of institutions and civil
 rights. It is this approach that
 characterizes  Ms.  Boeke's
 critique.
 The fact is, that so long as
 Americans are conditioned to
 think and act in a highly specific
 manner, exercizes of civil liberty
 are largely meaningless. Free-
 dom involves both the unin-
 hibited creation of alternatives
 as well as choosing among them.
 The primary argument of the
 S.D.S. in the debate was that
 America was not free precisely
 because the system effectively
 limited the creative conscious-
 ness by continually reinforcing
 specific modes of thought that
 can only support oppressive
 economic    and    political
 machinery.
 In  essence,  Ms.    Boeke
 chastises the Republican de-
 baters for not using her argu-
 ment, and ends up indicting the
 entire debate for missing the
 point. Rather, it is her conception
 of freedom that misses it. Her
 myopic approach to the issue, as
 well as the debate, is under-
 standable, if unfortunate, and is
 typical of the American frame of

 Government authorities sized
 approximately one ton of mari-
 juana from his pick-up truck
 which had just returned from
 sunny Mexico, and this bust
 obviously caused a new "low" to
 his relatively "high" business.
 Holt figured he'd deduct the

 By John Norris
 DePauw has many traditions
 that provide excitement for the
 students. This year's Monon Bell
 looks to be more exciting because
 of a new event called Mini Monon
 Bell.
 The football game is a regular
 IM game and will be refereed by
 paid professionals. The two
 teams are composed of 30
 all-stars from DePauw and 30
 from Wabash with the winner
 receiving a traveling trophy. The
 players will be allowed to wear
 soccor spikes, they can double
 block, run in a two-point con-
 version, and leave their feet to
 tackle.

 add a larger element of excite-

 Tigers, Little Giants
 face-off for 84th time
 Head coach Bob Bergman will
 lead his team into his first Monon
 Bell game Saturday against a
 Wabash team that is riding an 8-1
 season record towards a prob-
 able bowl bid, if they can defeat
 the floundering Tigers.
 "We knew they'll be tough,
 and have everything going for
 them," says Bergman, "but this
 is the kind of game where you
 can throw out the record, and
 that's what we're hoping for."
 Throwing the record out, and
 hoping maybe the Tigers' only
 chance this weekend. After
 coming off a 41-0 demolishing at
 the hands of Butler, they face a
 team that crushed Centre 32-0
 last Saturday, behind one of the
 country's  top  Division  III
 quarterbacks Dan Harvey.
 "He's the one that makes them
 go," says Bergman. But the head
 coach adds that the Little Giants
 will try to establish their running
 game first, and that is what the
 Old Gold will be concentrating
 their defense upon, as they enter
 the game.
 If the Tigers' run defense is up
 to form this week, the secondary
 will be spending a  long day
 attempting  to  track  down
 Harvey's missles, and stopping
 any number of good Giant
 running backs, after various 15
 yard gains.
 As for the Tigers' offensive
 plans, Bergman says the Tigers
 will not be doing anything
 different this week than they
 have in the past. The head coach
 did say the team would be
 working on its passing game this
 week, and while there might be a
 rotation at quarterback at some
 time during the game, it will not
 be the same as last week's
 musical QB.
 As for coaching in his first
 Monon Bell Classic, Berman says,
 "I'm not sure anyone can antici-
 pate what coaching a Monon
 game is until you do it, so we'll
 just have to wait and see."
 Soccer hems for NCAA Regionals
 By John Faulkner
 Despite a 2-1 overtime loss at
 the hands of MacMurray College
 on Saturday, Page Cotton's Tiger
 squad will be traveling to
 Wooster, Ohio to face the Fight-
 ing Scots in the first round of the
 NCAA Division III Midwest
 Regional.
 If the Tigers can get past the
 Scots, they may have a chance
 for revenge against MacMurray,
 as DePauw would face the
 winner of the MacMurray-Whea-
 ton game the next weekend.
 Cotton said the MacMurray
 game was a "disappointing loss,"
 but "finding out we're going to
 the tournament deadens the
 blow."
 The Black and Gold jumped
 out in front 15 minutes into the
 game when Dick Whitney found
 that net from 20 yards out for an
 unassisted goal. The score was
 the first this season by an
 Illinois-Indiana Soccer Con-
 ference team against MacMur-
 ray.
 The Tigers were playing "real
 well," according to Cotton, until
 Dick Larson was sidelined by a
 twisted ankle five minutes after
 DePauw's initial score. "After
 that we lost control of the
 midfield, and our momentum,"
 said Cotton.
 The score was still 1-0 at the
 half, but the Tigers had missed
 two golden opportunities, when
 one shot hit the post, but
 bounced out. Craig Nelson was
 thwarted on a breakaway at-
 tempt by a stellar save by the
 MacMurray netminder.  That
 was what probably won the game
 for them," said the Tiger coach.
 Halfway through the second
 half, Rich Mufuka knotted the
 score on a goal Cotton called,
 "not a clean score, just one of
 those that bounced around and
 went in." Regulation ended with
 the score still tied at one apiece.
 Five minutes into the first of
 two ten minute overtimes, Mac-
 Murray struck for the game
 winner. The next 15 minutes saw
 the Tigers scramble in futile
 pursuit of a score against the
 league leaders, who continued to
 play their patented strong de-
 fensive game.
 The Old Gold's appearance in a
 post-season tourney marks the
 first time that Cotton has led a
 team in pursuit of a national
 championship. "Our situation is
 like the baseball team last
 spring. It's great for the guys to
 get into competition on the
 national level, and get some
 national  recognition,"  says
 Cotton.
 Butler bowls Tigers 41-0
 By John Banker
 Saturday's humiliation at the
 Butler Bowl was enough to make
 anyone a believer in euthanasia,
 as the Tigers rolled over and
 played dead while the Butler
 Bulldogs streaked past them for
 a 41-0 football victory.
 The weak Tiger offense be-
 came non-existent in the second
 half, and the game of musical
 quarterbacks proved to be no
 more successful than sticking to
 one. Rich Boling, Tim Werner
 and Steve Hinding were able to
 complete only four of 22 passes,
 Field hockey ends season with 'good game'
 By Jane Brazes
 DePauw's field hockey team
 wrapped up a 3-12 season at
 Taylor last weekend, playing
 their best games of the year,
 according to coach Judy Jenkins,
 even though they lost both of
 their State Tournament contests.
 In the first game, the Tigers
 went down 3-0 to the Franklin
 team that went on to semi-finals
 to lose there against Indiana
 State, the group that eventually
 finished at the top of the pile.
 DePauw's second game pitted
 the Tigers against a powerful
 Indiana University squad and
 finished with a hard-fought 3-0
 tally on the Hoosiers' side of the
 score sheet. Indiana went to the
 final round of play, finishing
 second to ISU by a 1-0 decision in
 the tiebreaker. "IU was probably
 the best team there," said De-
 Pauw co-captain Louisa Witten.
 "We all played really well."
 DePauw was "playing up to the
 caliber  of Indiana,"  added
 Jenkins, which contributed to
 the effort that made the offense
 look the best it has been all year.
 Indiana's goals all came on hard-
 driven, well-placed shots.
 It was the end of the season for
 the team that started as a group
 of mostly rookie players. In
 addition to the four seniors-
 Nancy Brown, Peggy Ferguson,
 Sue Hays and Sheryl Roberts-
 the team will also lose sophomore
 nursing student Becky Russell
 next  year.  However,  said
 Jenkins:"It's an enthusiastic
 team, so I expect the rest of them
 to be back next year.
 "Even though we didn't have a
 winning season, the dedication,
 effort and spirit made this the
 Women
 and the Tiger offense only
 generated a measly 161 total
 yards.
 Meanwhile, the Bulldogs, to
 the glee of the Dads' Day crowd,
 were piling up 422 yards, passing
 and running for six touchdowns,
 totaling 198 yards through the
 airlanes and 224 yards on the
 turf.
 The same problems that have
 plagued the ballclub all year
 were the reasons for the second
 worst defeat in the DePauw-
 Butler series history. Penalties,
 best team I've coached since I've
 been at DePauw," she added.
 Recruiting letters and phone
 calls have already been going out
 to prospective high  school
 seniors, said Jenkins, even
 though no formal committments
 have been made.
 Jenkins said she is also en-
 couraging team members to
 participate in summer hockey
 camps to develop their playing
 skills.
 spikers win two, lose one
 The proverbial home court
 advantage worked for two out of
 three games for DePauw's
 women's volleyball team in a
 four-team contest Saturday
 morning in Bowman gym.
 Playing quick-thinking, hustl-
 ing games, DePauw downed a
 tough Butler squad in two
 games, 15-9 and 16-14. The
 Tigers dealt the same blow to
 Anderson in the second match,
 beating them 15-3 and 15-11.
 However, the Tiger spikers
 "We were moving better and
 faster in the first game than in
 slowed down in the third set
 against the lost 15-11, 15-11.
 the last two weeks of play," said
 DePauw coach Barbara Feder-
 man. "We were playing well, but
 then we fell apart in the third
 match."
 Tonight, DePauw hosts Vin-
 cennes, the Indiana State "B"
 team and St. Mary of the Woods
 in a four-team series beginning at
 6:30.
 Thursday the team travels to
 Huntington for the first round of
 State Tournament play. DePauw
 meets Earlham at 9:30 a.m. and
 Valparaiso at 11 a.m. Thursday.
 The top two teams of the three
 will move into single-elimination
 tournament play beginning at
 3:30 p.m. Friday. Finals will be
 Saturday.
 turnovers, sloppy blocking and
 tackling, and the inability to
 move the ball through the air
 sent the Tigers back to Green-
 castle with their third shutout of
 the season, all of them coming on
 the road.
 Butler jumped into the lead in
 the first quarter on a 22-yard
 pass with 7:04 left in the first
 period, after the Bulldogs re-
 covered a Randy Veatch fumble.
 The two second-quarter scores
 were also set up by Tiger
 mistakes. With 11 minutes to go
 in the half, Werner coughed up
 the ball on the Tiger 8-yard line,
 setting up Butler's second tally of
 the afternoon two plays later
 when Bulldog quarterback and
 the game's leading rusher, Ed
 Thompson, got six of his 144
 yards for the score.
 Boling s6t up the final touch-
 down of the half when he
 fumbled on the DePauw 20, and
 Butler's Bruce Scifes took the
 ball over on the next play to give
 the Bulldogs a 21-0 halftime lead.
 The Tiger offense was com-
 pletely shut down  by  the
 Bulldogs in the second half, as
 they were only able to manage
 one first down in the final 30
 minutes.
 In desperation, the Tigers took
 to the air, but were unable to get
 anything rolling, with three of
 their last nine possessions ending
 in turnovers. The Tigers never
 posed a scoring threat, with their
 deepest penetration of the day
 and the half being to the Butler
 32.
 While DePauw was trying to
 decide whether it was coming or
 going, the Big Blue rolled on for
 240 yards and 20 points in the
 final half, boosting their record
 to 4-5.
 The Tigers close out the
 season this weekend in the
 annual frolic with Wabash for the
 Monon Bell. Gametime at Black-
 stock is 1:30.

 ABC Sports to televise game
 By John Banker
 Well folks, if your friends back home
 ever tell you DePauw isn't the big times,
 all you have to do is ask them how many
 schools have ABC Sports televising their
 games.
 That's right, believe it or not, ABC
 Sports in New York selected the annual
 grudge match between DePauw and
 Wabash to be one of their games to be
 shot across the air waves.
 Some first impressions might be that
 Wabash has pulled the wool over a very
 naive DePauw, or that the television crew
 got lost on their way to Lafayette, or
 South Bend.
 But the facts are that through the
 contractual agreement between the
 NCAA and ABC Sports, the home of
 Howard Cosell is required to televise two
 Division III games a year.
 The first game was earlier in the
 season, as the voice of college football
 covered the Baldwin Wallace-Wittenberg
 game in Ohio.
 Wednesday, ABC notified DePauw they
 had the dubious honor of taking their 1-8
 record against Wabash on regional tele-
 vision.
 Tom Mont, athletic director, said the
 opportunity was "great" and will be good
 exposure for DePauw. Mont, who was a
 member of the NCAA's Division III
 football committee, said he had written
 ABC two years ago about the possibility of
 televising the game, but he got no
 response from the network.
 Mont speculates that ABC picked the
 game because "they know it is a big game
 in the Midwest."
 The play-by-play will be handled by Jim
 Lampley, who in past seasons has spent
 time patrolling the sidelines for the
 nationally televised game. The color
 commentator will be Ric Forzano; the
 technical crew from New York.
 The game is being televised by Channel
 13 in Indianapolis, and then will be sent to
 interested affiliates from there.
 So that all the frozen Monon Bell
 spectators and disinterested TV viewers
 can catch the big football clash of the day
 (the battle for the Big 8 crown between
 Oklahoma and Colorado in Boulder), the
 DePauw game has been moved up from a
 1:30 kick-off time to 12:40.
 Air time on WGRE with the pre-game
 show is 12:10.

 Deadline Dec. 1
 DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana            Friday, November 11, 1977
 Second semester OIT available
 The Dean of Students' office
 has released a statement on the
 procedure for applying for out-in-
 town (OIT) status fof Winter
 Term and second semester.
 Juniors and seniors who wish to
 request OIT status should follow
 the procedure below, according
 to Pat Domeier, chairman of the
 OIT committee.
 ? Obtain, fill out, and return a
 request form available in the
 Dean of Students' office. Dead-
 line for filing a request is Dec. 1.
 ? When the form is returned
 to the Dean of Students' office,
 seniors will participate in the
 senior lottery, juniors will parti-
 cipate in the junior lottery.
 Numbers will be drawn at the
 time the request form is re-
 turned to the Office. Numbers
 may be drawn by proxy.
 ? Seniors must have obtained
 senior status (23 courses com-
 pleted) by the first day of
 classes this fall. Juniors must
 have obtained junior status (15
 courses completed) by the first
 day of class this fall.
 ? Those who draw the lowest
 numbers will be granted permis-
 sion with the four percent guide-
 line established by the Board of
 Trustees. Any participating
 senior will be granted permission
 before any number drawn by a
 junior will be considered.
 Because ABC is
 televising the game
 Saturday,
 kick-off will be at
 12:40 PM, not 1:30
 ? If additional spaces are
 available after the Dec. 1 dead-
 line, the same lottery priority
 will be utilized. Any junior or
 senior submitting a request after
 Dec. 1 will be granted permission
 on a first come/first serve basis
 until the four percent quota is
 filled.
 All OIT permissions will be
 granted only for the remainder of
 the academic year.
 Any student granted OIT
 permission is subject to all Uni-
 versity rules and regulations as
 stated on the request form, in the
 University Bulletin, in the Stu-
 dent Handbook, or in any com-
 munications established by the
 Office of the Dean of Students.

 University to employ
 students as tattletales
 'y Jane Brazes
 Students employed by the Uni-
 versity on the federally sup-
 ported work-study program have
 been assigned to positions as
 undercover excise agents at
 Topper's, Charlie Brown's and
 713 bars. Word of the move was
 leaked yesterday by a high-
 ranking administrative source,
 who added, "Yes, this is a plot.
 We figure, if we can't get'em for
 on-campus drinking, we'll get'em
 at the bars."
 Under the program, 21-year-
 old students on work-study
 grants will be strategically
 positioned at each bar for six-
 hour shifts. Although they will
 "probably not" be working the
 beat every day of the week, they
 will be there often enough to tip
 off a few surprise raids each
 month, according to the source.
 For every under-age student
 convicted as a result of their
 efforts, the University will
 reward the work-study agents
 their choice of one pitcher of beer
 or two shots. "We know they'll
 have to catch a lot of kids, if they
 want to keep drinking," said the
 source. "Six hours is a long time
 to sit there if you have to spend
 your own money."
 The idea to pose the "excise"
 agents came from the Uni-
 versity, the source reported.
 "We're still marveling over the
 brilliance of the whole set-up.
 After all, who knows the under-
 age students better than the 21-
 year-olds?" The University had
 no trouble finding "agents," he
 added: "What DePauw student
 wouldn't do anything for a free
 beer?"
 Bar owners Charlie Brown and
 Tony Harmless were incensed
 when told of the University
 action, and threatened to refuse
 to serve anyone suspected of
 being an agent.
 "We've already got quite a few
 leads," said Harmless. "We've
 been watching the regulars-
 especially the ones who show up
 for Monday night football and
 don't leave til closing Sunday
 morning."
 demonstrators harrass AAUP profs
 By Chris Boeke
 While the American Associa-
 tion of University Professors
 (AAUP) was holding its meeting
 in the Duck last night,  non-
 members demonstrated outside
 chanting and carrying placards
 reading "Down with the AAUP"
 and "Elitists  don't unionize-
 we're not factory members."
 According to one professor,
 who wished to remain anony-
 mous, the AAUP is "just a bunch
 of Commie union organizers.
 When things get out of hand like
 this, you never know what will
 happen next. Maybe the admini-
 stration will start the American
 Association of University Ad-
 ministrators, or worse yet, the
 students may get ideas!"
 A nationwide organization
 with local chapters on various
 campuses, AAUP gives pro-
 fessors an opportunity to meet
 and discuss topics of concern to
 the faculty.
 Approximately 30 DePauw
 professors belong. to AAUP.
 Membership is voluntary.
 The AAUP discussed a slate of
 topics for this year's meetings
 and according to Fred Silander,
 AAUP president, decided to plan
 a faculty talent show.
 The show will be performed
 senior week, "because it will take
 us that long to get the thing
 together," said Silander. He
 added it also gave AAUP some-
 thing to talk about this year.
 Alan Pankratz, AAUP mem-
 ber and chairman of the talent
 show, said  non-AAUP  faculty
 members would be allowed to
 participate in the show.
 "We don't hold any grudges,"
 said Pankratz. "Anyway, we all
 know that the faculty, by its very
 nature, is divisible."
 Small talk
 on life, death
 convinces few
 By Chris Boeke and
 Sherrie Swan
 Billed as "A Little Small Talk,"
 Thursday night's debate at the
 Goose on "Resolved: There is
 Death after Life" drew a throng
 of over 315 students to hear
 Mark Small pitted against F. Lee
 Bailey, Billy Graham, Jeanne
 Dixon, William F. Buckley and
 Madelene Murray O'Hare. Oui G.
 Bord moderated the event which
 was sponsored by the Chaplain's
 Living Unit Council (CLUC).
 Small said he really didn't
 mind taking on this illustrious
 assemblage all single-handedly
 since a single hand was all that
 he had at the time anyway.
 "Now we're all familiar with
 people who will bite your head
 off, but you'll never believe what
 happened  to  me.  A rabid
 Republican incensed by one or
 some of my remarks from the
 last debate, took a good nip at my
 knuckle. It'll be out of commis-
 sion for quite a while," said
 Small, brandishing a plastered
 fist.
 Parliamentary procedure
 reigned while each debater
 delivered an eight-minute speech
 to establish his/her position. The
 two-hour free-for-all directly fol-
 lowing these remarks found both
 speakers and audience express-
 ing their opinions and unpenting
 their hostilities.
 O'Hare opened the debate by
 advocating that Congress outlaw
 death entirely. "It violates my
 rights, it's unconstitutional, and
 furthermore, it's against my
 religion!" she said.
 Graham cited passages from
 his best-selling book on angels.
 At the conclusion of his remarks,

 W.T. projects offered;
 Florida, Dad are top slots
 By Dave Mull
 Four new Winter Term pro-
 jects have been announced by
 the University for January of '78.
 They are the following:
 ? Florida Studies: This project
 deals with the varied scientific
 and  sociological aspects of
 Florida. Independent projects
 include: the effect of ultra-violet
 radiation on PABA-treated skin,
 the sociological and physiological
 effects of frequenting establish-
 ments which serve alcoholic
 beverages, and the physiological
 effect of THC on the brain.
 ? Working for Dad: This pro-
 ject concerns the ease with which
 students can avoid the problems
 of nepotism and gain employ-
 ment in their rich industrialist
 fathers' factories during the
 month of January. The societal
 effect of putting a poor blue-
 collar worker on unemployment
 is ignored.
 ? Theory of Shoveling Snow:
 This on-campus project is de-
 signed to teach students how to
 coerce little townies into moving
 enormous amounts of snow for
 small change. It is shown that
 this theory can be applied to
 other seasonal manual labor such
 as raking leaves. Other impli-
 cations of being a member of the
 "power elite" are also explored.
 ? Wine tasting:  This is an
 independent, on-campus project
 that people dumb enough to stay
 on-campus for Winter Term don't
 even have to sign up for. Various
 brands of wine will be sampled,
 sampled and sampled again for
 flavor, bouquet and drinkability.
 Drinkability will be judged by
 how long it takes to drink an
 entire bottle.

 Senate okays
 NORML
 Student Senate yesterday an-
 nounced that it would recognize
 NORML (Northern Ohioans for
 the Restoration of Morality in
 Libraries)  as an on-campus
 organization. The group's pur-
 pose, as stated in its constitution,
 is  to  remove  all  "lewd,
 suggestive  and   otherwise
 Communist-inspired propaganda
 from our libraries."
 Although Senate does not
 necessarily concur with the
 organization's aims, said Chair-
 man Mike McCracken,  "sanc-
 tioning of this organization
 proves that Student Senate is
 doing its best to encourage
 diversity in campus organiza-
 tions while at the same time
 promoting the values that should
 be upheld by a staunch Metho-
 dist school like DePauw." Mc-
 Cracken added that any books
 removed from Roy 0. West
 Library by NORML will be sold
 through the Student Senate
 Book Co-op.
 In other action, Senate voted
 to draft a formal letter to be sent
 to the Board of Trustees re-
 questing immediate action in
 setting up special-interest hous-
 ing. One suggestion is to put
 Romance languages majors on
 third floor Longden, German &
 Russian majors on second floor
 and Greek language majors on
 first floor. "Since DePauw is a
 microcosm of the world, we hope
 this will promote, in our own
 little way, international under-
 standing and harmoney," reads
 the conclusion of the rough draft.
 Senate welcomed its former
 chief Rob Lukemeyer, now
 relegated  to serving only  as
 Student Body President, with a
 hearty round of applause as he
 conducted an honorary adjourn-
 ment. "Well, I guess that's about
 it," he said, as the crowd rose to
 its feet approvingly.

 Academic Council (AC), a stu-

 oversees what the other councils
 of the school are doing, meets
 regularly Sunday nights under
 the leadership of chairman
 Nancy Woodhouse. Once again
 this week it appears that there is

 great regret that Queen Eliza-

 invitation. However, AC reports
 that Idi Amin Dadda, Miss Lillian
 Carter, Jimmy Hoffa and Robert
 Calvert will be present at one of
 the booths to speak on "the
 perfect political personality."
 AC has submitted a formal
 request to "Playboy" for equal
 time for DePauw in a layout
 similar to the "Girls of the Big
 Ten" feature. "I know we have
 girls who are bigger than size

 Woody needs assistant
 Bergman on the way?
 Word from the placement    "I have no plans to move on at
 office is that football coach Bob
 Bergman has been attending
 Dean Mohr's resume and inter-
 viewing classes. When asked
 why, Bergman said,  You never
 know when the big moment may
 come-and you've got to be
 ready for it."
 When asked if he was con-
 cerned about his job being in
 jeopardy,  the coach  retorted,
 "No but the offensive unit should
 be."
 -There is life
 (Continued from page 2)
 this point, right now I'm only
 concerned with building a pro-
 gram that  can  compete  with
 Greencastle High, and won't get
 the hell kicked out of us," he
 added.
 When asked about next fall's
 recruiting program, Bergman
 said, "Lou Fontaine found us
 some good  prospects over in
 Europe, particularly one soccer-
 style kicker," Bergman con-
 cluded.
 after death
 he invited members of the
 audience to "Come on down, and
 I will tell you about the Biggest
 Deal of your life."
 "Before this matter can be
 discussed with any semblance of
 rationality," said Buckley, "we
 must define our terms. Actually,
 the mode of one's existence can
 be either life-or death-like, de-
 pending upon one's conception of
 these words."
 Small, who maintained all
 along that he could have debated
 either side of the question con-
 vincingly, said, "Since I've never
 known anyone who's personally
 experienced death after life, I
 must  disagree  with  the  said
 resolution."
 "If no one can really say that
 he's dead and back it up with a
 substantial amount of evidence,
 then it follows that there   is
 obviously life after life, I mean,
 nobody has ever rung my door-
 bell to say 'Man, there's death
 after life, 'cause I've been there
 and I know."'
 "I would just like to sum up
 this whole ball of wax by saying
 that. this quality of existence is
 totally anarchistic and has more
 to recommend it than life around
 here. Being alive after life, after
 all, will hopefully not include ads
 for Wilkinson razors."
 THE  I)EP00N
 Marx gets thin;
 Roof gives drugs
 "Our 'psych' is sick," an
 nounced Dr. Roger Roofs office
 today, commenting on the ad-
 mittance of Dan Marx, clinical
 psychologist, to DePauw's health
 clinic.
 Roof said it was an extreme
 case of malnutrition coupled with
 an undetermined psychosomatic
 illness-very typical of someone
 in his position.
 STAFF NEEDS BACK-RUB
 By Rudy
 The DePauw student news-
 paper is now interviewing for the
 position of staff masseuse.
 "We need a full-time back-
 rubber over here," said editor
 John Banker, "especially on
 Sundays."
 The new staff member will get
 paid as much as an assistant
 news editor, but will be expected
 to be at the Pub Building giving
 back massages constantly.
 "The masseuse will have to
 work hard or be fired," said the
 editor. "Everyone around here
 can be replaced, but me."
 Fascists grabbing for power
 By Chris Boeke
 DePauw's College Fascist Club
 resolved to boycott all political
 science classes except those
 taught by Frank Darling at the
 College   Fascist    meeting
 Wednesday night.
 "We're sick of being exposed
 to those liberal, democratic
 views all the time," said CF veep
 John Taylor. "We know what's
 right, so we don't want to be
 confused by the facts."
 Tim Casaday, president of the
 College Fascists, said that not
 only did he advocate boycotting
 most of the poli-sci classes, but
 has suggested infiltrating the
 newly-formed Political Science
 Club.
 "There's no reason why people
 can't belong to more than one
 organization on campus, and
 anyway, we want to be sure
 they're not planning any moves
 to overthrow our organization,"
 Casaday commented.
 Sources close to the president
 have informed The DePauw that
 the CF has set up an intricate
 (bugging, wiretapping and black-
 mail) espionage system and has a
 special  slush  fund  to finance
 these covert activities.
 "C,F is paranoid about losing
 its  power  base    here  on  the
 DePauw campus," said the uni-
 dentified source. The source
 explained the CF saw the Poli-
 Sci Club as an effort to under-
 mine its influence on young
 minds.
 The College Fascists also dis-
 cussed scheduling another de-
 bate. Some of the topics men-
 tioned  were "How  Free  is
 America, part II" and "Resolved:
 The Left is Never Right."
 Guest speakers for the year
 included Liz Ray  on "Oppor-
 tunity Costs" and Generalissimo
 Franco. "But," said Casiady, "the
 last thing we heard on him is that,
 he's still dead." Another sug
 gestion was Earl Butz speaking
 on "Some of My Best Friends are
 Colored People."
 "Since I didn't know what else
 to do, I put him on antibiotics,"
 said Roof.
 Marx said the pressure of con-
 forming to the DePauw com-
 munity had been too much for
 him. "Being an outsider is really
 tough," he explained. "Students
 and faculty are nice, but you
 never can tell what they're really
 thinking."
 Marx said when he had gotten
 depressed, he decided to run an
 experiment to boost his spirits.
 "It usually works, ask any psych
 major," he said.
 Marx said he was trying to
 simulate some of the conditions
 felt by his patients and then
 realized that maybe he was
 overweight. "I figured that it
 might be the reason I wasn't
 being accepted  around  here,"
 Marx said.
 Marx admitted     that  it had
 gotten a little out of hand, and
 planned some group therapy
 sessions for when he returns to
 work. "I thought we could meet
 in the Hut) for lunch."
 Marx will return to his office
 Monday morning, he said. Any
 emergencies should contact the
 DePauw security right next door
 to Marx's office. "Grover likes to
 listen to students' problems, and
 his office  is  in  a  convenient
 location," Marx said.

 I was so shocked to learn that ABC is com-
 ing this weekend, and will be sharing the
 pressbox with me, I am speechless. - J B B
 Illiterates' Digest
 By John Taylor and Mark Kollar
 ED. NOTE: These selections
 were taken from the following
 bestsellers in Roy 0. West:
 "They Hop and Crawl," "A Guide
 to Textiles," and Encyclopedia
 Americana.
 SELECTED SHORTS ... It is
 highly  desirable  that  the
 :'iaterials used for underwear
 p, )ssess certain  characteristics
 such as: washability; colors '
 are fast to washing and perspira-
 tion;  yarns strong enough to
 withstand considerable strain,
 particularly in men's and boy's
 wear;  a  thread count  high
 enough to prevent slippage at
 seams;  small percentage of
 shrinkage; the ability to absorb
 perspiration and to allow it to
 evaporate quickly; the ability to
 keep the body either cool or
 warm as  needed in different
 climates and seasons of the year.
 This might now be a good place
 to say a few words in defense of
 the much maligned reptile, the
 milk snake. The annual loss in
 this country from the depreda-
 tions of rodents has been con-
 servatively  placed  at  five
 hundred million dollars. We have
 long recognized the value of our
 wild birds in combatting these
 enemies, and in most cases have
 given them ample protection
 both by law and public senti-
 ment, but many of us lose sight of
 the fact that our snakes are daily
 doing the same sort of work, and
 in some cases more thoroughly
 than most other animals.
 AND NOW A WORD FROM
 OUR MASTER MOSQUITO
 MATING EXPERT: It may take
 place between isolated pairs of
 auults, or it may occur within a
 group composed of an extremely
 large number of males. Such
 swarms are usually formed over
 small prominences in the land-
 sca )e such as bushes, fence
 post, or even over the heads of
 sitting ., .,a?ding people. Each
 male flies about in this cloud in
 an apparently aimless,  zigzag
 fashion. Females of small num-
 bers are attracted to the squad of
 the swarm, fly into it, are seized,
 and drop from the swarm with
 their male companions. Next
 time you swat a mosquito think
 twice.
 On the serious side, for this
 weekend's activities, try this.
 DRINK OF THE WEEK: To
 make a Bell Ringer mix six shots
 of Yukon Jack with six shots of
 tequilla. Down before the game
 and smile pretty for the ABC
 camera.

 Dear Editor:
 I want to make it perfectly
 clear that I'm just another one of
 the kids. I really identify with all
 of you, and feel as much a part of
 this campus as anybody else.
 Just because my Dad is presi-
 dent, don't think I get any easy
 breaks. Longden Hall is a long,
 long way from Carnegie.

 Dear Editor:
 I hope you'll all smile real big
 for ABC tomorrow. This could
 look good for my next Designs-
 it's good to remind the alumni
 that we're still around. I regret
 that I will not be able to see it on
 my own television set, but the
 broadcast won't make it out to
 Hyannis Port.

 Dear Editor:
 Where have you been all my

 Champs Alpha Chi ready
 for a repeat in p-puff
 Alpha Chi Omega, this year's
 powder puff champion is already
 tuning up for next season. "I
 have the girls on an extensive
 weight training program, pump-
 ing iron three days of the week,"
 says head coach Mark Boling.
 The other days of the week,
 the girls can be found down on
 the Blackstock practice field
 scrimmaging Bob Bergman's
 Fighting Tigers without pads.
 "The girls really like to stick it to
 the guys, and I can tell you that
 it's certainly reciprocal on the
 guys part also," says Bergman.
 "If you thought that we were
 manhandlers this year, just wait
 until you see what we do to the
 opposition next year," says
 Boling.
 The Alpha chapter will imple-
 ment their seven man "crush"
 offense next year, according to
 Boling. "I've had them hitting the
 sled, and they really make that
 baby scoot," he said.
 As for the defense, they're on a
 strict training diet of raw meat
 and eggs,    ording to Lucia
 Bolt, the girls. usemother. "I'm
 just trying to ket -1 my girls lean
 and mean," she sa, I
 Pledges are also u;cluded in
 the new training regime, as they
 join their older sisters for their
 daily workouts, and head over to
 the House for highlight and
 inspiration films.
 The Baby Bruisers say they
 may win all their games by
 forfeit next season, as they will
 strike terror in the hearts of
 their opponents. "I think we'll
 just blow everyone off    ",?I(.'
 said iloiing.

 Coaches seek foreign
 By John Faulkner
 Following in the international
 footsteps of the renowned re-
 cruiter Lou Fontaine, the athletic
 department as well as various
 campus groups are expanding
 their recruiting sights beyond
 the cornfields of Indiana.
 "The way we figure it, we've
 done this well using mostly Mid-
 westerners who didn't know
 what a soccer ball was until
 junior high," said Page Cotton,
 head soccer coach, "so, I'm going
 to jet down to Rio de Janiero to
 scout out some real feet."
 Over at SNu, the loss of Jon
 Beasley may be felt this Little
 Five, but some fast planning for a
 trip to France to recruit future
 star bike riders should head off
 any long-term drought in the
 winner's circle.
 Back at Bowman, football
 coach Bob Bergman has decided
 to take Fontaine's European lead
 also, and will head off for
 England immediately following
 tomorrow's season finale to scout
 out and recruit the American
 rugby crop living in England.
 "I've heard that rugby builds
 character and good athletes.
 Well, I keep saying that we have
 character, but I'll be darned if I
 could call them good athletes,"
 said Bergman.

 Bergman said the tab for the
 trip will come from part of the
 TV revenue  from  tomorrow's
 Monon Bell game, as well as the
 cut back of the normal recruiting
 schedule in southern Indiana, an
 area which has not been any "Old
 Gold" mine for the Tigers in
 recent years.
 "The way I've got it figured,
 three backs and a pulling guard
 will pay for the trip, and all the
 rest is dirty jocks," said the
 paedotribe.
 As for the women's basketball
 team, which won't be seeing
 hardwood for the second con-
 secutive season this fall, Bar-
 bara Federman, pseudo-women's
 basketball coach said, "We sure
 haven't been able to get any
 female roundballers here in the
 talent
 PAGE 7
 Midwest, so we'll he   going to
 Russia to pick up a few players
 there, I hear they have nice long
 legs. And they call this basket-
 ball country."
 All in all it will be a busy
 recruiting season for all of the
 slumping DePauw teams, or
 those  that  are  hoping  ^or
 improvement. But only time and
 mileage will tell how successful
 the coaches will be.
