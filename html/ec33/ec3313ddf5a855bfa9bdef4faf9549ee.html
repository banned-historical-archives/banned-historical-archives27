Senator Stennis. The committee will come to order, 
please. Let's see if we can't have a working arrangement 
here with our photographers this morning. You know that is 
one of the things that I have changed my mind on considerably 
since coming to the Senate. 
I realize that the photographers really serve a major 
part in transmitting the news and operations of our govern-
ment to the American people. It is a part of the free press, 
without which I am sure that our form of government could not 
last very long without a free press and all of its elements. 
So I am willing to swap time with the photographers but don't 
want to have it where you are really interfering with the 
committee, and I am sure you don't want to. But in the enthu-
siasm sometimes you detract from the witness or from the man 
who is trying to question the witness. 
So after out 5 minutes, if you can settle down below the 
witness and the Senators, I hope you can do that without being 
reminded again, and also after the Senate is in session, why 
these chairs up here are reserved for the Senators. 
By working together / believe we can better serve the 
cause, and that will be the purpose of the chair and / am sure it 
is yours. 
I have a short statement, Members of the Committee and 
General Twining. Today the Preparedness Investigating Subcommit-
tee and the Space Committee will hear General athan F. Twining,

bmd 4 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Following General 
Twining, we expect to hear from Secretary of Defense Thomas 
Gates. Because it is the responsibility of Congress to 
provide the essential enabling legislation for America's 
security, we have asked the nation's senior military officials 
to advise us. 
The head of each military service and each member of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff have already appeared. Today 
General Twining, we are asking your advice in your capacity as 
the country's military official, as former chief of staff 
of the Air Force and as a distinguished citizen. 
History proves that nations who do not look to their 
common defense do not remain long as principal actors on the 
stage of world affairs. 
America today is strong. We must continue to be strong. 
We must be certain that our defenses are based on sound mili-
tary requirements, and I think that that is the major question 
before the world, as General Eisenhower goes to the summit 
conference. Are we really in actuality strong enough for him 
to be in a position of strength rather than having a major 
part of the thoughts of the world thinking, whether we are or 
not, thinking that we might be secondary. 
I believe that that is what the question comes down to. 
General Twining, it is the custom of swearing all 
witnesses. Will you please stand and be sworn?

Do you solemnly swear that your testimony at this 
hearing will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but 
the truth, so help you God? 
General Twining I do. 
Senator Stennis. Have a seat. Ig the members 
of the comaittee are ready, we will proceed. Perhaps it will 
be better if we can to let the General make his statement, 
which I understand is brief, make it without interruption. 
General, proceed.

bd6 TESTIMONY OF GENERAL NATHAN F. TWINING 
CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF 
General Twining. Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Commit-
() tee, I would like to have permission to make a few opening 
remarks. 
I believe I can be of service to the committee in setting 
forth as clearly as I can my personal views on some of the vital 
iesues that are involved in the current hearing. I realize 
that there are some honest and sincere nen who will not hold 
the same views that I do. I respect their views, even though I 
my not agree with them. I have the responsibility as chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to advise the Secretary of 
(:) Defense, the National Security Council and the President of my 
own view. 
These are views formed after careful consideration of 
all the facts involved in the complex matters which led to the 
design of our defense posture. In analyzing our posture versus 
that of an enemy, we utilize the national intelligence of 
the highest degree of sensitivity. Moreover, to conduct the 
analysis we undertake war games. 
Senator Stennis. Pardon me just a minute. Do you have 
copies of your statement so we may follow you more closely? 
General Twining. No, I'm sorry I dont, This is very 
short. 
In these efforts we established assumptions, crank in

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
510 
bd7 national intelligence and then engage in the most complex 
(:) calculations known to professional analysts and strategists. 
Some of these efforts require months of work on the part of 
(:) the best brains that this country can muster. I believe in our 
national intelligence estimates. I am briefed nearly every 
day of the year regarding the developing intelligence picture 
worldwide. This daily briefing is standard practice for 
key officials and officers of the department. We do not wait 
until the end of the year for one final intelligence briefing 
and then relate al/ of our plans and programs to it. 
Our planning porcess is continuous as is our intelligence 
process. I believe that I know that the military professional 
(:) is never satisfied with the forces at his command. 
Each of us all over the world in all nations would like 
to have just a little bit more regardless of how much is at 
hand. I believe that we have enough military strength today 
to carry out our assigned missions, and I believe that our 
combined American leadership will see to it that we continue 
to have enough. 
On the basis of all the information available to me, and 
In view of the mission and locations of our retaliatory weapons 
(:) systems: I just do not believe that any nation possesses the 
ability today or in the foreseeable future to attack us or 
(:) destroy us without receiving unacceptable damage in return. 
So long as our armed forces are maintained strong and ready 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6

bd8 and so long as the national will and courage remains vigorous 
(:) and hardy, we have no reason to fear any human system or 
threat. 
(:) I am not complacent. Yet I am not fearful of the Soviet 
capability. Thank you. 
Senator Stennis. All right, Members of the Committee, 
we will follow the usual pattern today of calling on counsel 
and then each Senator for 10 minutes so as to give everyone 
a chance to ask any questions. On the second time around we 
will extend the time on the request of any Senator I think. 
Mr. Weisl, you may proceed. 
Mr. Weisl. General Twining, General Power stated to this 
(:) committee last week that in March 1959 he sent a request to 
the joint Chiefs of Staff stating his urgent requirements 
for airborne alert, and I quote his answers to my question 
hciefly: 
"Were the Joint Chiefs of Staff asked to approve and fund 
an airborne alert for SAC? 
"General Power. They were. 
"Mr. Weisl. When was the request submitted to the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff? 
"It was submitted in March of 1959, I believe around the 
(:) 6th of March. 
"Mr. Weisl. That was almost 10 months no. 
(:) "General Power. Yes, sir. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
512 
"Mr. Weisl. Did you receive any reply? 
"General Power I have not received a reply from the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff." 
How is it possible, General Twining, in these critical 
times that a request of such urgency has not been replied to 
for 10 months by the Joint Chiefs who are in command of General 
Power? 
General Twining. His request would naturally go into the 
normal budget cycle because it requires a considerable amount 
of money, so it was held until we went through the normal budget 
cycle and had the discussion with the Chiefs. 
That is why the delay. A decision on this whole matter 
was not made until late this fall. 
Mr. Weisl. Wasn't the major --
General Twining. I might say though that of course 
General Power though he did not get a direct communication 
from the Joint Chiefs: he knew exactly the status of what was 
going on all this time through his own Chief of Staff. 
Mr. Weisl. Did he learn that through the grapevine 
or directly from the people who command him ? 
General Twining. He probably got it through the Chief 
of Staff of the Aix Force, but he was not informed by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. You are right. 
Mr. Weisl. Don't the Joint Chiefs have the responsibility 
of telling the Commander of SAC who serves under the Joint

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
513 
bd10 Chiefs? 
General Twining. They had not made the decision. 
Mr. Weisl. Wasn't the major change in the National 
Security Act amendment of 1959 removing the secretaries 
in the Department from the chain of command so there would be 
Oirect chain of command between the unified and specified 
commander and the Joint Chiefs. 
General Twining. That is correct, and the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff would be the proper people to inform him. 
Mr. Wei 1. Since this was supposed to streamline the 
operations, why does it take more than /0 months to answer a 
letter of such urgency to a Commander of 90%; of the free world's 
retaliatory power. 
General Twining. / would like to check the record on it 
and see what he was told and was not told. 
I do not kn)w. 
Mr. Weisl. Very well. Will you supply it for the record? 
General Twining. I will. 
Mr. Weisl. Genera/ Taylor says there's no machinery avail?
able for the Joint Chiefs to make hard decision, and I quote 
him briefly: "Nowhere in the machinery of the Government 
is there a procedure for checking military capability against 
political commitments or our forces in being against the 
requirements growing out of the basic national security policy." 
Do you agree with that?

bdll 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
514 
General Twining. No, I do not agree with that entirely, 
no. That has been taken up before with the Chiefs when 
General Taylor was have, and there was no real merit to his 
proposal. 
Mr. Weisl. / quote him further: The aoint Chiefs of 
Staff have failed to agree on the forces needed to support 
the agreed strategic concept, and hence have not produced the 
military guidance needed by the military services. The 
Secretary of Defense has interjected fiscal considerations 
into midrange strategic planning, and has thus deprived it 
of much of its potential value." 
Do you agree with that? 
General Twining. He is right on the forces, 
and the JSOP, and there has also been a difference of opinion. 
Otherwise we know what we call the *MOP has always been 
agreed by the Chief with the exception of the 
41111.040 
Mr. Weisl. Has there ever been a decision made on that 
subject? 
General Twining. No, not on the aSOP. We now have the 
'MOP fox this next go-around in the Office of the Secretary 
of Defense. 
Mr. Weisl. General Twining, could you tell us, do you 
feel there is a future need for manned bombers? 
General Twining. Ilm sorry, sir, I missed that. 
Mr. Weisl. Do you feel there is a future need for manned

515 
bd12 boMbers? 
General Twining. Yes, I do. 
Mr. Weisl. On the 3-70 General White testified that 
he felt there was an urgent requirement for the development 
of the 3-70 as a weapons system. Can you tell us whether 
the Joint Chiefs as a corporate body made any decision or 
recommendations on this? 
General Twining. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have discussed 
this at great length, and the Secretary of Defense knows 
the opinions the Joint Chiefs of Staff hold in this matter. 
Mx. Weisl. Can you tell what those opinions axe? 
General Twining. No, I donet think I should tell what 
they are. 
Mr. Weisl. Have they made any decision or recommendations? 
General Twining. The recommendations were made and they have 
gone all the way up to the President himself, also through the 
Defense Department on the way. 
Mr. Weisl. Were those decisions unanimous or split? 
General Twining. Those decisions were not unanimous. 
Mr. Weisl. There has been considerable open testimony, 
General Twining, about the fact that the development of the 
B-70 has been downgraded. Do you care to comment on that? 
General Twining. Well, yes. I believe that is probably 
true. It was originally designed as a complete bomber weapons 
system, and now in this budget, as you know, the B-70 will

coatinue as more or less a development project for the air-
plane and the engines and not as a bomber system. 
Mr. Weis'. Perhaps I might quote some of the testimony 
taken on the B-70, if you haven't already read it. 
General Twining. I have read quite a bit of it, sir, but 
I will be glad to hear it. 
Mr. Weisl. Senator Cannon asked this question: "Tow 
in connection with the 3-70 program, was the B-70 scheduled 
to come into the inventory at the time the B-52 became 
Obsolescent? 
"General Power. Yes, it was timed. Whether this was 
by design or accident, but it was timed to come in just about 
the time of the first B-52 becoming obsolescent. 
"Senator Cannon. And if the B-70 program is delayed as 
it is now proposed, will the 2-52 in the inventory be comparably 
as obsolescent as the B-47s are today? 
"General Power. Yes, to the same extent. There is a rule 
of thumb in bombardment, and I think it still holds, that 
7 years you approach Obsolescence, 10 years Obsolete." 
Do you agree with that? 
General Twining. I think that is correct, yes. I agree 
with that. 
Mr. Weisl. Then under the present plan will the B-70 
possibly be in operation when the 13-52 becomes obsolescent? 
General Twining. Well, if we proceeded on the 3-70

program full speed ahead we wouldn'tget it I would say until 
about '67. 
Mr. Weisl. Then by that time the B-52 will be obsolete. 
General Twining. It will be on the way out2 that is 
right, six. 
Mx. Weisl. What are your personal views as the principal 
advisor to the Secretary of Defense on the B-70? 
General Twining. Well, I think if you go back a little 
bit on the whole bomber, I think that we areriPt quite sure how 
much the ICBMs will take over the role from the bomber. We 
certainly know that the bombers will go down in nuMbers as 
the ICBMs become perfected. But how much and to what 
numerical numbers the ICBM will replace the bombers we don't 
knew for sure. 
But I am convinced that we will have bombers all the 
way through this period we are talking, '67, '68 and maybe beyond, 
and the bomber will still be a useful weapons system in the inven-
tory, regardless of how good the ICBMs may get. 
Mr. Weisl. Doesn't that depend on how quickly or at 
what time a potential enemy will decide to make war on us? 
General Twining. That would have some bearing on it, 
and I certainly believe that at that period, '67 and ?68 
if the bomber is still a useful weapons system, we would be 
much better off with a more advanced bomber like the B-70. 
Mr. Weisl. What bombers will we have?

General Twining. None. 
Mr. Weisl. If we don't have the B-70. 
General Twining. The B-70 is the only one. 
Mr Weisl. What are your personal views on airborne 
ale:ct, General Twining? 
General Twining. My personal views are that the airborne 
alert capability is what we must go for. 
I think that what is in the budget this year will take 
care of it. I do not advocate an allout airborne alert but 
I do think we should have this capability and use it when we 
wan:.: it and when we think we need it, and Change it from 
day to day and time to time so the enemy knows we have this 
capability. 
He doesn't know when we are using it, and I think it is 
just about as much of a threat to him then in his planning, 
it makes it difficult for him as if we used it 100% in 
every 24 hours a day: which I do not believe in. 
Mr. Weisl. But General Twining, in order to have it when 
we teed it, we have to do certain things now, don't we? 
General Twining. Yes: sir. 
Mr. Weisl. And are we doing those things now in order 
to have it in the force that General Power and General White 
recommend? 
(:) General Twining. I think we are doing, pushing for 
what we need to get the airborne capability, not the airborne

Mx. Weisl. Or that General White wants. 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Mr. Weisl. Did you make your views known to the General, 
to General White? 
General Twining. Yes, on many occasions. 
Mr. Weisl. Did you advise General White that you agreed 
with his views but that the budget didn't provide for the money 
that he wanted and if he wanted to put his views on airborne 
alert into effect, he would have to take it out of his Air 
Force budget? 
General Twining. I don't recall that. That might be 
the way that it would happen though. 
Mr. Weisl. May we ask What did you advise General White? 
General Twining. I advised General White that I thought 
that the airborne alert capability was essential and 
was sufficient s not the whole airborne alert operation as 
General Power wanted it. 
Mx. Weis].. Or that General White wanted. 
General Twining. Thaes right. I am not just sure what 
General White does want. / didn't see his testimony.

that was in closed session. 
General Twining0 I certainly never recommended that to 
Mr. Weisl. Did the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a corporate 
body make any decisions or recommendations on General Power's 
urgent request for airborne alert? 
General Twining. Yes. 
Mr. Weisl. What was their decision? 
General Twining. There was a difference of view there 
again r but none of them I can say went along wholeheartedly 
with General Power's recommendation. 
Mr. Weisl. What were the differences? I mean you under-
stand General Twining, anything you feel you shouldn't answer--
General Twining. 1 feel that those Generals 
testifying should say how they feel. I can tell you what 
recommendPd and I have told you, and they didn't agree with 
General Power, but I don't think I want to say any more on that 
because they smight have said something up here since I have 
seen them that I don't know about. I don't know, but I think 
you ought to get it from them, sit. 
Mr. Weisl. Then really there was no decision made. 
General Twining. There was certainly a recommendation 
to the Secretary of Defense. He knew exactly how the Chiefs 
felt about it.

Mr. Weisl. And what were those recommendations? 
General Twining. I think you ought to get those from 
the Chiefs. I gave them mine. I gave you mine, I mean. 
Mr. Weisl. Does the budget incorporate your recommenda-
tions? 
General Twining. Yes. 
Mr. Weisl. Does the budget incorporate -- that 
incorporates your recommendation. 
General Twining. I think the budget does. If the 
figures are correct there they have got enough money for what 
I feel they should do, the on the shelf capability is what 
they call it: / think that is a very good plan and very 
essential and badly needed. 
Mr. Weisl. General Twining, if you are concerned that 
we will need the Th-70s to replace the 13-52 when it becomes 
obsolete, why did you advocate delay in the development of the 
3-70 as a weapons system? 
General Twining. I made the recommendations on the 3-70 
and General White made them and our recommendations were con-
sidered at the proper sourced and the decision was made to do 
otherwise as was specified in the budget. 
I certainly go along with that. I would like to see 
possibly a little bit more: but I do go along with this. 
The project is still alive and we can look at it this year. 
It is a very d very expensive project as you know. There are

road this year we can find out more about it and make a more 
careful analysis and judgment later. 
Mr. Weis'. Were your recommendations overruled? 
General Twining. They were not al/ considered, no. 
Mr. Weisl. Your recommendations were not all considered? 
General Twining. No. 
Mr. Weisl. What do you mean by that? 
General Twining. They were listened to. / had the 
chance to make my speech and I made it and the result was 
what you see in the budget today. 
Mr. Weisl. To whom did you make your speech?

I would rather not do that. 
Mr. Weisl. You would rather do that in closed session? 
General Twining. That is right. 
Mx. Weisl. May I call your attention to General White's 
testimony on that question, and X quote: 
"At some point in the proceedings as Chief of Staff 
of the Air Force I entered a paper into the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff requesting that an airborne alert of the magnitude 
requested by General Power be implemented." 
Do you recall that? 
General Twining. He never told me he was going to do 
that but that is fine. That is his recommendation. 
Mr. Weisl. He said he entered a paper into the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff requesting that an airborne alert of the 
magnitude requested by General Power be implemented. 
Genera/ Twining. I would like to see which one that is 
six, which airborne alert he is talking about. We have had 
quite a lot of discussion. 
Mr. Weisl. He said of the magnitude requested by 
General Power. 
General Twining. I am reminded that was General Power's 
full &borne alert, one-quarter of the force on 24 hour alerty 
and General White did back that. 
Mr. Weisl. What was the action taken on that paper

sVomitted to the Joint Chiefs by General White backing up 
General Power? 
General Twining. It was considered by the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. There was quite a little discussion about it, and 
as I said, the Secretary of Defense was informed of the Chief's 
views on airborne alert. He knew how they all stood on it. 
Mr. Weisl. And you don't care to tell us how they stood on 
any one? 
General Twining. No, sir. And this was studied a great 
deal by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was a pretty serious 
study. 
Mr. Weisl. Now may I ask you, General Twining, did the 
Joint Chiefs as a corporate body make any decisions or recommenda-
tions of what should be done about the Nike-Zeus program in the 
1981 budget? 
General Twining. Yes. We did make a recommendation on Nike-
Mr. Weisl. What was that recommendation? 
General Twining. The overall recommendation, and there 
was a difference of opinion again. 
Mr. Weisl. What? 
Genera/ Twining. A difference of opinion, one dissenter, 
was not to go Into production this year with the Nike-Zeus, 
to carry it on as a high priority, top priority research 
program, and do as much as they could on it, but not to go into

bd22 productions not to authorize any pre-production of it. 
think there was one dissenter of the Chiefs in this 
vote. 
525 
Mr. Weisl. There was one dissenter. 
General Twining. Yes. 
Mr. Weisl. And that was the dissent I tak it of 
those who had the responsibility of using the Nike-Zeus. 
General Twining. ThaWs right. 
Mr. Weisl. There was appropriated by the Congress 
137 million for the development of pre-production parts for 
the Nike-Zeus system in the event there was a breakthrough. 
That appropriation was never used and has not been used 
to this day. Has that issue come up before the Joint Chiefs? 
General Twining. No, sir. We have not gone into that 
issue at all. That would be a matter for the 
Secretary of Defenses and I think for Secretary Brucker to 
work out how to handle it. I think the Secretary of Defense 
is prepared to talk about that. 
Mr. Weisl. Wasn't that an important matter for the Joint 
Chiefs to consider? 
General Twining. Not necessarily. 
Mr. Weisl. Why not? 
General Twining. Because they did not go into the produc-
tion fund and it is up to the Army then to handle that 
themselves with the Secretary of Defense.

526 
Mr. Weisl. Where does the Secretary get his military 
advice as to whether a certain fund appropriated by the 
Congress should or should not be used to make a military 
weapons system? 
General Twining. We recommended no preproduction from the 
Chiefs as the majority view, no preproduction, and the money 
that Congress voted, and that is up to the Secretary of 
Defense I guess in the bid get what to do with that money. 
We have nothing to do with holding up the money or spending 
it. It is up to the Secretary of Defense, because he gives 
it to the services, not to the Chiefs. 
Mx. Weisl. In other words, then the majority view 
was that it should be released if it referred to preproduction 
use. 
General Twining. No. Referring to preproduction funds 
the majority view was not to go into the preproduction. 
Mr. Weisl. What was the majority view? I thought the 
majority view was to go into research and development. 
General Twining. Research and development, that is 
correct. 
Mr. Veisl. Which involves preproduction, doesn't it? 
General Twining. No, no, no, sir. 
Mr. Wtia. Don't you develop a program before you go 
into production? 
General Twining. Well, the way we looked at it, and it was

a z I 
thoroughly understood that we would not set up advance 
procurement items to prepare for production, but to go ahead 
purely on an R&D program, sir. 
Mr. Weisl. Suppose that a breakthrough took place 
where the Hike-Zeus team was ready for production, and the 
$137 million that the Congress appropriated for components to 
be ready in the event production was ready, what would happen 
then? 
General Twining. Well, I think they ought to go ahead 
and use it right away. That is what the Secretary has said. 
I would like to bring that up right now. I have been here with 
him for two straight years now before the committees, and he 
has said that all these programs like Hike-Zeus, Polaris, 
Minuteman, that the minute that we make any breakthroughs 
and see a chance to spend more money intelligently we are 
going to come right over to the Congress regardless of what 
time of the year it is and ask you for the money, and he has 
said that repeatedly, and that would apply to this money you are 
talking about. 
Mx. Weisl. But in this respect you did not have to go 
to Congress to ask for the money. The Congress already 
appropriated the money, and the purpose of it was to be 
ready in case there was a breakthrough not to have any year 
or more delay in the production of the weapon system, and that 
money was not used.

528 
bd25 General Twining. That's right, because it had not 
(:) gone far enough to use. They had nt made the proper advance 
to warrant spending the money. 
(:) Mr. Weisl. Why do you suppose Congress was requested to 
appropriate that money if they didn't need it? Didn't the De-
partment of Defense urge Congress to make the $137 million 
available last year? 
General Twining. I don't think the Department of Defense 
did. I am not sure about that, sir. 
The Army probably asked for it, 1 don't know. 
Mr. Weis'. The Secretary of Defense sent a letter to the 
Senate requesting that this $/37 million be appropriated, that 
there was a need for it, and the Congress appropriated it, and 
the question I am asking you, why that money wasn't used, 
in view of the recommendation of the Secretary that it was 
needed, and that was the reason it was appropriated. 
General Twining. Sir, I am not prepared to answer that. 
You will have to ask Secretary Gates about that. 
? 
Mr. Weisl. Did the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a corporate 
body make any decision or recommendation on accelerating the 
Polaris program in the fiscal year 1961? 
General Twining. The Chiefs of Staff did not make that 
recommendation. 1 think that came from the Secretary of 
Defense.

bd26 great stress on the importance of the Polaris program as 
(:) a retaliatory force. Don't you think that a matter of 
529 
that kind should have some use from the Joint Chiefs of Staff? 
General Twining. Well, here again, sir, the Joint 
(:) 
Chiefs of Staff have gone into the Polaris on many occasions, 
but this particular recommendation, they agreed with the size 
of this program, the Chiefs did. But it didn't instigate in 
the Chiefs of Staff as I recall. That is a program that came 
from the Navy through the Secretary of Defense. The Chiefs 
were asked about it and they went along with this program 
that was given by the Secretary. 
Mr. Weisl. What I am asking you is whether the Joint 
(:) Chiefs made any decision on the acceleration of the Polaris 
program as recommended and appropriated for by the Congress? 
General Twining. Those are Secretary of Defense matters. 
Mr. Weisl. Who advises the Secretary since he is a civilian? 
General Twining. We advise him. 
Mx. Weisl. What did you advise him on the accelera-
tin of the Polaris program? 
General Twining. On what is in the budget now? 
Mr. Weisl. No, the acceleration provided for by the 
Congress. The Congress appropriated more money for the acceler-
ation and for the production of more nuclear submarines than 
the program provides for.

General Twining. We were not, the Chiefs as a grpup were

Secretary of Defense what they do with those funds. 
Mr. Weisl. Did you make any recommendation on that sub-
ject? 
General Twining. No. 
Mr. Weis/. Isn't that one of our at least it was 
testified to as being one of our chief retaliatory forces, 
and yet you say the Joint Chiefs of Staff; who are the only 
military advisers that the Secretary of Defense has, made 
no recommendation on that. 
General Twining. The Chiefs of Staff were satisfied with 
the program as submitted, and wsnt along with it, not the 
accelerated program that you are talking about. 
Mr. Weisl. Then the Joint Chiefs opposed the acceleration 
ol the program; is that correct? 
General Twining. Well; they certainly did not recommend 
to go ahead with it.

Mr. Weisl. Did you have any personal view that you gave? 
General Twining. Yes, I did. I thought it was about the 
right program, 3 submarines a year as / recall. 
Mr. Weisl. In other words, you disagreed with the recommen-
dation of the Congress and the appropriation of the money for an 
accelerated Polaris program? 
General Twining. I was never asked that question. 
Mr. Weisl. Wells what are your personal views on that?

along just about like we are, until we find out more about 
Polaris. I think it is a good program? 
Mr. Weisl. Wont it be too late when you find out -About 
Polaris? Isn't there a lead time involved? Doesn't it 
take a year or two years of pre-planning in order to get a 
submarine? 
General Twining. What do you mean? I don't understand 
what you mean by being too late.

by not making preparations for the production of more

had one project some time ago of putting other weapons 
systems on surface ships, and I think the Chiefs did not go along 
with that project at the time. 
Mr. Weis/. Then the joint Chiefs were opposed to the 
project of incorporating the Polaris on surface ships. 
General Twining. Yes, I recall that is correct.

General Twining. That is right. 
Mr. Weisl. Do you agree with that decision? 
General Twining. I still do, right as of the moment, very

decision is made now, that there will be a considerable delay 
in bringing that decision into fruition if at a later time 
the Joint Chiefs change their mind. Do you agree with that? 
General Twining. I do, I agree with it, yes, sir. 
Mr. Weis. Admiral Burke testified yesterday that the 
Navy never had an opportunity to present its military 
requirements to the Secretary of Defense because the Navy 
had to stay within the established budget guidelines. What 
function do the Joint Chiefs perform if military requirements 
are not considered when the budget is determined?

bd31 General Twining. Well, I dont see why if Admiral Burke 
(:) had a set of requirements he could not present them to the 
Secretary of Defense. He certainly presents them to his own 
Secretary. 
Mr. Weisl. He testified that because the guidelines 
limited him as to the amount that he could ask for, and since 
his minimum requirements were more than the guidelines provided, 
he was in no position to ask for those military requirements. 
General Twining. The Secretary of Defense had what he 
called reclama meetings with the service secretaries and 
the service chiefs of staff and they could present any problem 
to him they wanted to present at that time, requirements or 
anything else, and / think Mr. Weisl there is another thing 
that you should ask the Secretary. 
Mr. Weisl. May I ask this question, General Twining. 
What good is it to present requirements when the guidelines 
prevent those requirements from being acted upon? 
General Twining. You can still present the requirements. 
If you have got a strong enough case I think the guidelines 
would have to give. 
Mr. Weisl. May I read to you the testimony given by 
Admiral Burke briefly: 
Weisle, You have given us several examples in which 
the Navy did not ask for the funds it required because of budgetary 
guidelines. Did you ever submit to the Secretary of Defense

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
535 
bd32 your military requirements for 1961? 
(:)"Admiral Burke. As I explained before, .a had a direc-
tive to submit our budgetary request for '61 in two amounts. 
(:) One was the basic budget and one was the basic and 
add-on, and we followed our directive. 
"Mr. Weisl. Then you did not submit your requirements? 
"Admiral Burke. Not as it had been conceived heretofore: 
no sir." 
General Twining. Well: I think what Admiral Burke 
said was correct, but still that doesn't mean to say that he 
was not listened to or his Secretary was not listened to: if 
they had requirements other than were listed in that program. 
Mx. Weisl. I understand that the Secretary and al/ of 
(:) 
you have freedom of speech in this country, but since the 
guideline or the budget says you cannot ask for more than 
this amount, it doesn't do any good to present a requirement 
exceeding that amount no matter how urgently the man in charge 
of that responsibility needs it is that correct? 
General Twining. That is right. Of course, / do want 
to make clear that the Secretary of Defense is fully aware 
of the requirements of all the services, that he is not in 
ignorance on this. He knows. Re is the one that has to 
judge, and he knows what the service requirements are. There 
O is no mystery about that.

? Senator Stennis. All right, Senator Case. 
Senator Case. If Mr. Weisl might not get from the Chief 
of Staff the definition of add-on. 
Mr. Weisl. Will you give us the definition of add-on? 
General Twining. I think this is purely a matter of 
the Secretary of Defense, and I wouldiet mind defining it, 
but if I define it, I am getting into his sphere, the way 
this budget was handled, and I personally was absent du?ing 
this period when this was going on, and I understand just how it 
was done and all that, but it was a way of managing this 
budget. 
They were given objectives, and I think it would be 
much better, Mr. Weisi, if you would let Mr. Gates explain 
that to you. 
It is really in his ballpark. 
Mr. Weisl. Were you represented at that time? 
General Twining. Oh, yes, sir. 
Mr. Weld. By whom? 
General Twining. Probably Admiral Burke. He was the 
senior. 
Mx. Weld. You were represented by Admiral Burke? 
General Twining. Admiral Radford came in. I was absent 
for several months. 
Weisl. In connection with the formulation -- may I 
say, Senator Case, we will try to get you that information,

bd34 what add on means in connection with the formulation of the 
?1961 budget: did the joint Chiefs make any determination of 
e:zactly how much and what types of strategic deterrent and 
...retaliatory forces we need now and for the next several 
years? 
General Twining. The Joint Chiefs of Staff do not get 
down to snecifics on that. This is a matter that is discussed 
all the time with the Chiefs, all, these force levels , 
intermittently through the year are discussed. It isnct just 
budget time, like carrier programs, 3-52 programa, they 
come out all the time for discussion. They see the programs, 
they know exactly what each service has in the way of programs. 
They know exactly what SAC consists of, which is the 
basic retaliatory organization, and they don't want to change, 
? they might think it is a little big but they have not recommen-
? ded we cut it down. 
Mr. Weisl, General Taylor testified and I think you are 
familiar with his views, that no one determines what the over-
al/ need is. 
He says that a certain budget is fixed, and then the Army 
gets a certain part, the Navy gets a certain part, the Air 
Force gets a certain part, the Marines get a certain part, 
Vat there is no determination of how much is enough for the 
overall defense of the United States. 
General Twining. That is one of the very difficult

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
538 
bd35 problems. People have very strong opinions about forces, 
(:) hew big they should be and what should comprise them, what type 
they should be. 
(:) That is one of the most difficult things we have to contend 
with in the military. 
Mr. Weisl. I know it is. 
General Twining. Very difficult. 
Mr. Weisl. Don't you believe that someone should make a 
decision of what overall forces we need before we decide how 
much the Navy should get, how much the Army should get and 
how much the Air Force? 
Dont weapons systems, in other words, today in modern 
(:) warfare cross service lines? 
General Twining. That is right. 
Mr. Weisi. So that someone ought to make a decision 
what overall requirements there are before deciding? 
General Twining. I think the Secretary of Defense will 
explain to you when he comes up here, and I don't want to be 
taking words out of his mouth on this, but this year I think 
really for the first time we concentrated in this budget 
more on programs without worrying about the ultimate end cost 
C.) of the budget or the service budget, but worked =programs, 
what programs were necessary, weapons systems were necessary 
C.) for the defense of this country, and we stayed with this 
weapons system discussion for days over there, regardless of

539 
bd36 costs ox anything else, to find out which ones we must 
(:) have: which ones should go on to research and so forth. 
Mr. Weisl. But the Joint Chiefs were decided on all 
(:) of those subjects. 
Genera/ Twining. No, they aren't divided on all, but 
they have their strong opinions. They naturally want their 
own weapons systems in: and that is the thing, that is the great 
debate of course. 
Mr. Weisl. There was no firm recommendation: no unanimity 
on the Polaris, on the 3-70, on airborne alert. 
General Twining. Well, when the final thing was decided 
on what amount of money would be spent on Polaris in this 
(:) year, how big the program would be, everybody went along with 
it. 
There is no objection by the Chiefs on it. I think 
Admire/ Burke would like to have had a few more but he went 
along with the three submarines plus the lead time for more out 
in the distance. 
Mr. Weisl. He had to go along, didn't he? Be had no 
choice. 
General Twining. He presented his case and / think it 
Was a pretty good decision myself. 
Mr. Weisl. Well, now, if he presents his case, and the Joint 
Chiefs don't make a decision, what good is the presentation of 
the case?

bd37 General Twining. He presented his case but the Joint 
Chiefs didn't agree with him. Another one of those split 
decisions. The Secretary gets this for advice. Sometimes 
it isn't too formalized,but he calls us in and says "What do 
you think about this", we are al/ there and we state our views 
and he has got them. That is the kind of advice we give the 
Secretary of Defense. We do that quite frequently and we don't 
make a formal paper lots of times on these things. 
Mr. Weisl. You agree that up to this year there has been 
no overall planning. 
General Twining. X wouldn't say there hasn't been overall 
planning but I say it can be improved and it is the toughest 
problem we have, Mx. Weisl. 
It can be improved. 
Mr. Wets 1, Thank you. Did you want to say anything 
further? 
General Twining. He brought up a point about the Chiefs 
and our split decision. I will explain now what it means. / 
can tell you that since I have been Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, we have passed on over 2300 papers, and of 
those 2300, over 2300 papers we passed on, 34 were split 
decisions, that that is about a 1.5% roughly and I think 
that is pretty good business. 
Mx. Weis'. Well, yes. 
General Twining. Of course those were major decisions, I

541 
b438 must say. 
(:) Mr. Weis/. Yes, but the 2300 things that you passed on 
didn't concern the vital questions like the B-70, the airborne 
(:) alert, the Polaris program: the acceleration of the Atlas 
program and so forth. Thosewere the important things, weren't 
they? 
General Twining. They were quite basic. 
Mr. Weisl. And that is where the splits were. 
General Twining. Some of them were basic, that is right. 
Those are the ones. 
Mr. Weisl. The modernization of the Army, the moderniza-
tion of the Navy. That is Where the splits occurred. 
General Twining. I don't think it is a split on moderni-
zation of the Army. It is just a question of priority of funds, 
getting the money for it. I think we all realize that the 
Army should be modernized. 
Mr. Weisl. The recommendation as to the speed of the 
modernization was denied to the Army, the recommendation of 
the Chief of Staff of both General Taylor and General Lemnitzer 
as to the requirements for speed of modernization was denied. 
General Twining. Well, the speed: the rate may be. 
Mr. Weisl. The rate? 
General Twining. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Weisl. Now may we go to another subject, General 
Twining?

bd39 Secretary Gates testified before the Subcommittee of 
(:) the committee 
Senator Stennis. Pardon me just a minute, Mr. Counsel, 
yo l are running overtime but I think this has been very, very 
illuminating testimony. 
I will yield to you five minutes of my time if you will 
proceed now and you can round off your questioning in five 
minutes, please. 
Mr. Weisl. Secretary Gates testified, and I quote: 
"There was a significant matter brought up by Mx. Dulles, 
and it was brought out by General Twining. Heretofore we have 
been giving you intelligence figures that dealt with the 
theoretical Soviet capability. This is the first time that we 
have had an intelligence estimate that says This is what the 
Soviet Union probably will dou. 
Therefore the great divergence based on figures that have 
ben testified to in years past narrows because we talked before 
about a different set of comparisons, ones that were based 
on Soviet capabilities. The present one is an intelligence 
estimate on what we believe he probably will do, not what he is 
capable of doing. 
3Mr. Mahon. That is what you are doing this year? 
"Secretary Gates, Yes, it is a very significant 
charge. 
Now then, on the same subject within a few days you stated

543 
bd40 as follows: 
On the basis of my own personal knowledge of the 
national intelligence estimate for this yeax I can inform 
this committee that there was nothing new introduced in 
the principles followed." 
How do you reconcile these two statements? 
Secretary Gates saying there was a significant 
change and you are saying that on your personal knowledge of 
the national intelligence estimate, "1 can inform this 
committee there was nothing new introduced in the principles 
followed"? 
General Twining. I don't want to confuse these problems 
any more than they, but what I would like to say is that he 
was re:cox:ring to a specific item, and what I was saying was 
intelligence has not been changed, the way we put out 
intelligence, make it up and distribute it has not been 
changed. 
How what happened? Every single good intelligence man 
wants to give the military planner the most accurate information 
he can About the enemy: so he gives him the best he can, and 
that degree of help is how much input he has into his intelli-
gence. 
Now we had very little information on the ICEMprogram 
of the Russians, for example. 
I dont want to get into security, but I want to say this:

bd41 The intelligence thing has not been changed at al/. 
(:) This year we had more evidence, more specific evidence in which 
C 
we can refine our judgment on what the Russians have. 
Last year we didn't have that much information, that is 
all. We have more specific evidence this year. We formed 
a deduction on how many missiles he is going to have or express 
a judgment, a course of action he might take, that is the 
point. 
Mr. Weisl. -,Cf that statement is correct, has the 
kett,uwA,4 
intelligence-sto,Qmaimpt narrowed the difference without going 
into numbers? 
Let us be specific; what did you say? I didn't hear 
your answer. 
General Twining. I think that is a question we ought to 
thrash it out and I don't want to start it here if we can't 
finish it. 
Mr. Weisl. The statement was made in public by the 
Secretary. 
Genera/ Twining. I agree with his statement. That is 
as much as I will say here. I will agree with his statement. 
Mr. Weisl. That the number was narrowed. 
General Twining. I agree with his statement. 
Mr. Weis'. And I quote the statement made by the Secretary: 
This new intelligence estimate has narrowed the 
differences." Do you agree with that?

Mr.Weisl. Let us be specific without going into nuMbers. 
Let us compare the current estimates without going into nuMbers

mid-60?

year.

General Twining. / have got to get them. 
Mr. Weisl. Would you say under oath that it is narrowed? 
General Twining. Yes. 
Mx. Weisl. You say that under oath? 
General Twining. From the intelligence we have. Now you 
may have some special intelligence that I don?t know about. 
/ am stating this compared to the intelligence we had last 
year and that I personally gave these committees and the 
intelligence we have this year that I personally gave the 
committees, it has been narrowed. 
Mr. Weisl. For missiles on launchers. 
General Twining. For ICBMs. 
Mr. Weisl. ICBMs for missiles on launchers. 
General Twining. As I said before, last year we did not 
list missiles on launchers in my intelligence.

(:) Mr. Weisl. We did have them last year and we had them 
this year, unless you get different briefings from the CIA

General Twining. I have my charts of last year. I have 
then all, and I gave no figures on launchers last year, and 
I had one set of figures, and this year we have the same. 
Mr. Weisl. You say the save thing about '61, that it 
is narrowed? 
General Twining. As I said, I am getting in a bad spot 
hero because you can't air this out without putting charts 
out and the whole business. 
(2) Mr. Weis/. Yes, I know. 
General Twining. And I don't like to discuss it. 
Mr. Weisl. The Secretary has testified publicly that  it

will show you when he comes up here in executive session,

are. 
You can show what you have got and let's straighten this

C/A in closed session. I am not asking you to give numbers: 
but I an asking you whether there has been any intelligence 
estimate that indicates that the relative position of missiles 
on launchers by the Soviet Union and ourselves has narrowed 
from last year. 
General Twining. We didn't have an estimate on launchers 
/ast year, and it is just very difficult to explain it without 
getting into security problem. I would like to straighten it 
out I assure you. 
Mr. Weisl. You would like to straighten it out? 
General Twining. Yes, but not here. The Secretaty is also 
prepared to do this. 
Mr. Weisl. I can tell you that we did get those figures 
last year and this year. 
Senator Symington. Mr. Chairman, will counsel yield 
for a question? 
Mr. Weisl. Certainly. 
Senator Symington. Did you see before you came before 
this committee on the 19th of January that you know of the new 
Central Intelligence Agency estimates of what the soviets 
had on launchers?

Senator Symington. On the 19th of January. Are you 
saying that on the 29th of January that the Director of the 
Central Intelligence Agency did not estimate that they had

548 
more of these missiles on launchers this year than last year 
for mid-1960, mid-1961 and mid-1962? This could be answered 
by your assistant because he sat here When Mr. Dulles gave 
us the testimony. 
General Twining. Last year there was no CIA estimate 
of on-launcher. 
Senator Symington. I didn't say that. I said when you 
came before the Committee on January 19, 1960, did you know 
the Central Intelligence estimates of what was on launchers 
last year and now what was on launchers this year? 
General Twining. I didn't know what was on launcher last 
year, no. 
Senator Symington. That was the evidence that was 
presented to us by the Director of Central Intelligence this 
year, on January 29. 
General Twining. We have never had that in the Defense 
Del?artment, 
Senator Symington. You mean the information that the 
Director of the CIA gave this committee has never been in 
the Defense Department? 
General Twining. I know the chart you refer to, Senator, 
but we didn t have it until this thing broke. We didn't know 
about it. 
Senator Symington. I just want to be sure in your interest 
that what you are stating is then that the information that was

549 
given us on the 29th of January as to what were on launchers 
estimated for last year that you did not know about in the 
Department of Defense; is that correct? 
General Twining. As to on launcher last year, the answer 
is nos I did not know. 
Senator Symington. Do you have a representative on the 
national intelligence agency board? 
General Twining. Yes, 
Senator Symington. Thank, you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator Stennis. Ail right, this is a special situation. 
You have used up the chair's time too: which is all right. 
There is one more question. 
General Twining. I think it is very important that this be 
straightened out and we can't straighten it out here. That 
is my point. That is all I have got to say. 
Mr. Weisl. I don't want to ask a question. I just want 
Captain Gray to look at his own handwriting showing hie 
attendance at the session when Mr. Dulles briefed this Com-
mittee and then advise General Twining. 
Captain Gray. With the Chair's permission I will do this. 
Senator Stennis. All righto we will proceed in the regular 
order, gentlemen. We will come back to that, gentlemen; as I 
say, counsel was permitted to go over considerably in his 
time but it was an important matter. 
Senator Saltonstall? 
Senator Saltonstall, Mr. Chairman, I have just come in

550 
and I prefer to hold my questions until latex. I simply want 
to make this observation, that I think that some of this secret 
information that was given to us in the most secret sections has 
been leaked to the newspapers and questions have been asked, 
I have just heard questions asked of General Twining, who 
said that he did not want to answer them in open session, and 
then there was persistence. I think that is very wrong. I 
hope that General Twining in open session will stand on his 
rights and not give away any military secrets or make any state-
ment that he thinks is derogatory to the security of the 
United States. 
I will support him and I am confident every member of 
this committee will support him, and in executive session he 
can make what statements he believes. 
But I resent tremendously the security that has been 
leaked to the newspapers in recent weeks, and which I think is 
dangerous to our country, and is derogatory to our military 
officials. 
Senator Stennis. The Chair was following those questions 
very closely indeed, and it is very clear to the Chair that 
Counsel was not trying to require the witness to disclose 
(:) figures. In fact, counsel insisted that he was not calling 
for figures all the time. I think General Twining -- may I 
have your attention, gentlemen? 
I don't know how far this is going. I think the General 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
bd48 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
551 
had a good point too, being careful that he not disclose 
these figures, and he handled himself very well indeed. 
At the same time it is of concern to the committee about whether 
or not the Chiefs of Staff have the! full figures before them and 
Whether or not the correct figures have been given here. The 
acting chairman has no sympathy whatsoever with disclosing figures 
anywhere near the borderline of security and he thinks we overdo 
it. 
I don't know where those figures come from. I used to 
think that maybe some members of the committee or the staff might 
gve them out, but I have changed my mind. I don't believe 
they come from those sources. I mean I never did accuse any 
individual, but we come in here and have these briefings, and 
then a few days later what purports to be the figures show up 
in the paper and I can't understand it. I don't know where it 
comes from but I think the General has made his points well, and 
at the same time it is my impression that counsel was certainly 
w;:thin the limits of the examination. 
If the committee wants to go into executive session, why 
I will be certainly glad to. 
Senator Saltonstall. I appreciate that. 
Senator Stennis. The Chair will not rule that he has 
to disclose anything that he doesn't want to in open session. 
Senator Symington. 
Senator Symington. Mx. Chairman, I too regret very much

bvd 49 as the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts does 
that figures have been given to the newspaper, and I would 
hope -- I am sure that everybody else. regrets that very 
much. 
I have seen four lists of figures by four different 
people. All those Uses were wrong, as against what is given 
this committee. In general they underrate the Soviet capacity, 
those lists and they overrate our own. I too am very sorry 
that they have been given. 
General Twining I have here a statement. General well 
D. Taylor, retired Chief of Staff of the Army: told the Senate 
hearing this week that the Chiefs of Staff instead of being 
able to consider free world needs, have been frozen in their 
thinking by fixed budget percentages of the defense dollar 
made avaiLeble to each of the Services. 
Do you agree to that? 
General Twining. Hot entirely. The budgets have been, 
as we all know, they have been fairly rigid percentagewise 
to the various services because of the missions the services 
had, the expense of equipment andell that. But I don't think 
it is complete/v stereotyped. He may have a point, sure, yes. 
Senator Symington. Another statement has been made. 
In the past two or three years the Service Chiefs have 
been authorized to include a list of what they consider most 
essential for their weapons, at a cost not to exceed half a 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
553 
bd50 billion dollars as a possible addition. This has given them 
(:) a chance to list projects they consider essential that cannot 
be undertaken within the present budgetary limitations. 
(:) Is that correct? 
General Twining. We had one exercise where something 
like that was done, yes. 
Senator Symington. These presentations have been ineffec-
tive in the main, is that correct? 
General Twining. I wouldn't say that, no, six. 
Senator Symington. Then the statement continues: 
"The speed up of the Atlas Intercontinental program during 
the past two years was denied, although production could have 
been doubled." 
(:) 
Is that correct? 
General Twining. Production could have been greater than 
it was, there is no question about that, yes. 
Senator Symington. This would have lessened the Soviet 
advantage in the missile gap during the critical next few 
years." 
General Twining. We could have had more missiles. 
Senator Symington. Thank you, General. The statement 
then is made: "The reasons were budgetary, a desire to wait 
(:) fox the as yet undeveloped and much cheaper solid propellant 
Minuteman Intercontinental Missile. 
(2) "Today it is claimed that since the lead time on the Atlas 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
554 
bd51 not for missiles but for preparation of sites and training 
of crews is 2 years and the Minuteman should be available 
by mid-1963 there is no need now to increase Atlas production. 
This evades the fact that the Minuteman is yet to be per-
fected and that the expected date of readiness is only a hope." 
Is that correct? 
General Twining. I think that is true. T think Genera/ 
Schriever testified to that. 
Senator Symington. Now last May 20th, "Asked about his 
recommendations on the 3-70 bomber it was stated We 
questioned the use of a new bomber when we and presumably our en-
emy would have converted to principally a missile capability. 
We questioned whether by the time the B-70 could be developed, 
we would be preparing for the kind of warfare that it would be 
capable of carrying on.'" 
Inasmuch as that statement was made by the Director of the 
Bureau of the Budget last May 20, doesn't that imply that 
the decision was a budgetary decision on the 3-70? 
General Twining. No, sir, I don't think so because we 
were discussin te 3-70 right up to the close of budget time. 
Senator Symington. Then the statement is made: "From 
the Air Force point of view, the United States may never know 
where all the targets for strategic attack axe, and missiles 
(:) cannot be shot at those targets that are not known. But 
a bomber capable of evading hostile defenses can find hidden

555 
targets such as missile launching sites and destroy them. 
The Air Force is convinced of the continued need therefore 
/br a small number of bombers, but for bombers of much greater 
performance than the present subsonic craft that can penetrate 
the formidable modern air defenses." 
Would you agree with that? 
General Twining. I think that statement has a lot of 
merit. 
Senator Symington. Then it is stated: The Air Force 
tried to keep the B-70 program alive first by reducing the 
amount spent on the B-58 program and then by eliminating entire-
ly the F-1081 the new supersonic long-range fighter, but these 
savings failed to save the B-70." 
Would you agree with that? 
General Twining. Well, I agree with the first part, and 
still dont think the 2-70 is lost. 
Senator Symington. You said that it took until 1967 
to get it if we went full speed ahead? 
General Twining, I think that is pretty close. 
Senator Symington. And previous testimony is 1965. 
Which do you think is the right one? 
General Twining. I hope 1965, but my experience has been 
it generally takes a little longer than you think. 
Senator Symington. That is pretty much true for all these 
weapons, isn't it? 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6

bd53 General Twining. That is right. 
Senator Symington. And if we delay now further, why then 
it will be just that much farther probably based on the cycle 
just that much more obsolete, will it not? 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Senator Symington . Or Obsolescent. 
General Twining. I do want you to understand that all these 
points were presented strongly by the Aix Force, and they had 
a good hearing1 and the people had a lot of problems besides 
purely defense, and the Air Force business felt maybe we should 
go a little slower, I just want you to understand that. 
senator Symington. Was that the reason that you opposed 
General White's position? 
General Twining. On the 13-70? 
Senator Symington. Yes, sir. 
General Twining. I never opposed his position on the 
0-70. 
Senator Symington. Captain, will you come here please, 
Captain Gray? 
Senator Jackson asked a question. 
General Twining. Well, it depends at what stage of the 
(:) proceedings you anatalking here now. Initially of course, I 
would be for it 100%, but when all things came out --
Senator Symington. Were you for it for military reasons? 
General Twining. Yes.

d54 Senator Symington. Then you supported it? It is not 
going ahead. You couldn't have had any other reason but budget-
ary reasons, could you? 
General Twining. It is a very expensive weapons system. 
There are a lot of unknowns in it. I hate to see the delay in 
it certainly, but I think it is probably pretty good to take a 
look at it this year. 
Senator Symington. Can we say then that you did feel 
because of its cost after it was turned down that you had to 
differ with General White, and therefore oppose it as Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs? Isn t that a fair statement? 
Genera/ Twining. I think that is a fair statement. 
Senator Symington. Mr. Chairman, I want to put out that 
on high authority, I am going to present a statement to the 
committee on very high authority: the statement has been made 
that the B-70, the cancellation of the B-70 was not on the 
basis of budgetary considerations. My time is up. I have 
some more questions. I will wait my turn. I would like to ask 
just one more. 
Senator Stennis. All right, proceed. 
Senator Symington. It is true, is it not, that as of today 
in the United States Air Force there is not a single plane: 
fighter or bomber, under research and development? 
General Twining. I think that is right, sir: 
except the B-70, this airplane is still going ahead on a

Senator Symington. My final question adding to it --

Senator Symington. That any advantages in breaking the heat 
barrier on the 8-70 could be immediately interpreted into all 
other airplanes for the Air Force, for the Naval Air, for commer-
cial air, could they not? 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Senator Symington. Thank you, General. 
Senator Stennis. Senator Wiley, you have 10 minutes. 
Senator Wiley. General Twining, I am not a military man. 
/ am not a man versed in aircraft or in ships, but I was 
interested in a statement that you made, and I think we Should 
spend a little time, because you intimated that the military 
p,:ofessional, and that means one in each of these classes, is 
never satisfied with the forces at his command. You repeat 
that, do you? 
General Twining. Yes. I think that is around the world. 
Senator Wiley. You also made the statement that you 
believe that we have enough military strength today, and / 
stress today, to carry out our assigned missions, and I believe 
that our combined American leadership will see to it that we 
continue to have enough. You have faith in that state? 
General Twining. Very much faith. 
Senator Wiley. Now then, when we talk about a threat of war, 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 559 
bd56 we axe all thinking in terms of the Kremlin, are we not? 
(:) We are not talking so much about limited war. 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Senator Wiley. As wa axe about the overall war? 
(:) 
General Twining. That's right, general war. 
Senator Wiley. I think Admiral Burke made a very profound 
statement. He said that we had in his judgment at present 
adequate military deterrence, but he said the other deterrents 
are more significant than the military. Do you agree with 
that? 
General Twining. 1 do. 
Senator Wiley. Can you enumerate these other deterrents, 
why the Kremlin would not let the balloon go up? gust why 
wouldnit it and what are the deterrents outside of the so-
called military deterrents? 
General Twining. Well, I think the Kremlin feels that 
they are doing a pretty good job without the military operations. 
They are moving around the world pretty freely doing about 
What they want in accomplishing programs. 
think that is one area that Admiral Burke was talking 
about. 
Senator Wiley. would a world war Mean the destruc-
tion of both the contending forces or nations? 
General Twining. I certainly think that Russia, the people 
of Russia have been through wars. They have had their country

bd57 completely ruined, like just recently in the last war. 
(:) think the last thing they want, even less than we do, 
is to have their beautiful country hit again with bombs and 
(:) terrible weapons of destruction. 
Senator Wiley. You are talking about the 200 million 
Russian people, aren't you? 
General Twining. That is right. 
Senator Wiley. The common people of Russia? 
General Twining. That is right. They are very proud of 
their country and they are building it up at a great rate as 
me all know. I was there in 1956 and / was greatly impressed 
with what they showed us, and they axe so eager to show us 
(:) what they were building, what they were doing. 
For instance, Stalingrad, we thought when we went down 
there we were going to hear about the battle of Stalingrad: 
all about what went on there. We heard practically nothing 
about that, but we certainly heard plenty about the master 
plan for the rebuilding of the city and they took us all over 
and showed it to us. 
They dont act like they are ready to jump on the United 
States. 
(:) Senator Wiley. Well, what do you say about the captive 
nations? Do you think that that is a deterrent force? In 
(:) other words, that the Kremlin or the men in the Kremlin

bd58 Wiley: and that is a little over my head: but I certainly think 
their captive nations would be a questiondble thing in the 
case of a showdown. Their loyalty might be quite questionable. 
Senator Wiley. In other words, we are talking about Poland: 
Czechoslovakia: Bulgaria, the Baltic States and so forth, 
is that right? 
General Twining. That's correct. 
Senator Wiley. Well, do you suppose that our allies 
crnstitute a deterrent? 
General Twining. Our allies constitute a great deterrent. 
This collective security-is what-we base our military posture 
on, and that is part of the deterrent definitely. 
Senator Wiley. Have you been reading lately about the 
difference between Mao Tse-Tung and Khrushchev over Khrushchev's 
visit to Inida? 
General Twining. I have been reading some of it, yes, 
sir. 
Senator Wiley. Well, do you think that 650 million, it 
will soon be a billion Chinese on the south of Siberia is also 
a matter that Khrushchev would have to consider? 
General Twining. He might some day, yes. 
Senator Wiley. What is that? 
General Twining. He might, yes, sir. 
Senator Wiley. Now would you mind briefly in the few 
minutes that I have left telling us what our military deterrent

562 
d59 consists of, because we had yesterday an enumeration of a 
great nuMber of airplanes and also our Navy and so forth. 
would like to get that briefed so that today at least we 
can have a little answer to what we have had so far, because 
heretofore we have had evidence in cross-examination to the 
efect that there has been a lack in the men who are supposed 
to handle the job. 
Let's put it this way. What is the percentage that the 
Navy gets, the Army gets and the Air Force gets of the budget? 
Have you got that? 
General Twining. The Air Force is now getting the highest 
percentage. I haven't got the exact figures with me, but 
(:) it is about 18 billion roughly to about 11 to out nine, Air 
Force, Navy, Army. That Is roughly the percentage, the $41 
bfalion budget. 
Senator Wiley. When the general military group like 
yourself get together, and you take, for instance, the billions 
that each one of these forces get, then it is up to that 
particular force to determine how they are going to use those 
bills1 or is it up to the Secretary or what? 
General Twining. The money is created during the budget 
cycle according to the needs of the services, the weapons 
systems they have to buy and the people they have to provide 
for and all of that, and the money comes out at the end to 
provide for, for instance -- for instance the Army's carrying

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
563 
bd60 out their mission. Then within that once the budget is set 
O: course the Army bas to live within that budget for that 
yaar. 
If it has some new requirements they have to come back 
in the way of supplemental as you know to get more money. 
Senator Wiley. You said "I have the responsibility as 
Caairman of the Chief of Staff to advise the Secretary of 
Defense, the National Security Council and the President of my 
oan views." 
General Twining. That is correct, sir, and I do. 
Senator Wiley. So it isn't just a Chief of Staff. It is 
the Secretary of Defense, the President and the National 
Security Council, all of which consider the disposition of the 
funds that Congress votes. 
General Twining. That is correct, and I attend the Security 
Council as advisor to the Secretary of Defense when the Security 
Council meets, and I am free there to voice an opinion. 
Senator Wiley. I think that Is all. 
Senator Stennis. The Acting Chairman read in the morning 
papers that the Senator from Massachusetts was going to have 
to be in conference at the White House advising the President, and 
the Chair therefore knows for that sole reason the Senator was 
a little late. 
Senator Saltonstall. That is correct. 
Senator Stennis. So the Chair takes the liberty with the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6

bd61 permission of the committee to recognize the Senator from 
(:) Massachusetts out of order. 
Senator Saltonstall. I thank the Acting Chairman. He is 
(:) as courteous and always polite and always thoughtful. 
General Twining, while 1 missed much of your preliminary 
stiinents I have a general knowledge of your position from 
other hearings. I would like to ask just one question, and 
/ appreciate the courtesy of the Chair. You stated that the 
B-70 research was going forward but not as fast as recommended 
by the Air Force or that the Aix Force would like? 
General Twining. That is right, sir. 
Senator Saltonstall. That is a fair statement, is it not? 
General Twining. The Air Force would like to have a whole 
weapons system developed with all the components, which is 
quite different from what it has. 
Senator Saltonstall. Isn?t it true there is research going 
forward on a number of projects of intense value to our 
security if they are perfected, and the problem is in the over-
all Joint Chiefs of Staff and in the Defense Department, is to 
decide whether to make a selection, and then proceed with that 
more fully as in the weapons system of the B-70, and if that 
was done, it would mean the elimination of some of the other 
research projects, or to decide to go forward with more of the 
research projects in their preliminary stages, and then make 
a decision to drop some and concentrate on the ones that they 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
565 
bd62 may decide on? 
Genera/ Twining. That is right. 
Senator Saltonstall. Like the B-70. 
General Twining. That is right, to keep taking a new look 
at these things as you go along. 
Senator Saltonstall. Isn't that the problem and isn't 
that the fundamental reason why the decision was made to keep 
the B-70 going forward with these other projects, with the 
money available, and with the men available and the space and 
the research facilities: rather than to make a selection at this 
time of the B-70, and drop some of the other projects, and 
concentrate on them? 
General Twining. That is correct, Senator. 
Senator Saltons tall. And that was one of the fundamental 
bases of the decision, was it not? 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Senator Stennis. I thank the Senator. Without going back 
into the subject unless someone wishes to / think the following 
quotation from the public record will clear up the situation. 
A few minutes ago when Mr. Weisl was questioning General 
Twining, the Chair thought the counsel's questions were proper 
even in open session, as long as the General did not go into 
figures based upon the following consideration. 
In open hearings or at least in testimony that has been 
cleared and has been printed in the public record, the

566 
bd63 Subcommittee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, 
Secretary Gates testifying in this year at page 24: referring 
to these intelligence estimates makes this statement: 
(:) "This new intelligence estimate has narrowed the differ-
ences." 
Then later Secretary Gates sent in the following state-
ment: 
"It has been stated on previous occasions that the Soviet 
superiority in ICBMs could be in the order of 3 to 1 in the 
period of 1960 to '63. This statement was based upon the 
estimate of what the USSR could produce in numbers of missiles 
and was not an affirmative statement of the fact that the USSR 
would produce the number of missiles required to attain this 
superiority." 
Senator Symington. Mr. Chairman, what is this? 
Senator Stennis. This is from Secretary Gates testimony 
before the House Committee on Appropriations of the approximate 
date of aanuary 1960. The rest of that sentence quoting from 
the Secretary: 
"On the basis of our current intelligence estimate, which 
has been presented to the committee by the Director of Central 
(:) Intelligence Agency, we do not now believe that the Soviet 
superiority in ICBMs will be as great as that previously 
estimated." 
Now that being a pUblic statement was why the Chair thought 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
567 
bd64 that the Counsel was within his rights in examining the 
General as long as this committee did not require the General 
to give any figures, and that was the matter we had up a while 
ago and I thought that had a place in the record at this 
time: 
May we proceed now in regular order? Senator Cannon? 
Senator Symington. Mr. Chairman, I am interested in this 
subject. May I make one observation? 
Senator Stennis. Certainly. 
Senator Symington. I am very glad the Chair read that 
statement because based on the testimony given us by Mr. Dulles, 
the Soviet launching capability willbe greater than what he 
said he estimated it was last year. 
That is why this situation has got into the condition 
that it is in now. 
Senator Stennis. Unless there is further comment from 
the members we will return to the regular order. Senator 
Cannon, you have 10 minutes. 
Senator Cannon. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Generals yesterday Admiral Burke stated that in his 
opinion the greatest threat in the next 4 or 5 years was the 
prospect of limited wars. Do you share that view? 
General Twining. I think it is pretty hard to say that; 
limited wars are certainly a real threat like the thing we 
are talking dbout. I think it is hard to say which is more 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
568 
b465 likely to happen but in general I think he is right, yes. 
(:) Senator Cannon. In general you think the greatest threat 
would come from limited wars. Now are we making as adequate 
(:) preparations for limited type wars as we are for a general 
all out war? 
General Twining. I think our preparations fox limited 
war are adequate, yes. 
Senator Cannon. You say you think they axe adequate? 
General Twining. Yes. 
Senator Cannon. I wonder then if you would take 
issue with this statement from General Lemnitser: "The 
Defense Department is woefully andhopelessly unprepared for 
(:) the type of emergency airlift it might require." 
General Twining. I think he has exaggerated that a little 
bit. Certainly we donut have all the airlift that the Army 
would like to have and all the airlift we would like to 
have. 
We would like to have the airlift more modern too. We 
do have lots of airlift and I think we can handle the situa-
tion. 
Senator Cannon. Is it your view that we have adequate 
airlift for the type of emergency situations in limited wars 
that we might conceivably foresee within the next 3 or 4 
years? 
General Twining. We have, as our studies show, we have

bd66 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
569 
adequate airlift for the general war situation. 
In the limited wax situation we do have some problem 
areas, and I recall one not long ago of a limited war in 
Korea while we were mobilizing at the same time at home. There 
was an indication that the first 20 days we were going to 
be short in some of our lift. We can take some administrative 
action, getting the craft in sooner and relieve it somewhat, 
but of course it all depends on what the requirement is. 
Now we couldn't move all the Army divisions at one time 
of course. We couldn't move 3 Army divisions at one time but 
we could move some of the advanced echelons. 
Senator Cannon. You did show you would be short in the 
first 20 days, is that right? 
General Twining. That is right. 
Senator Cannon. And the first 20 days of course would 
very likely be the critical period? 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Senator Cannon. I am wondering then if you agree with 
Mr. Mahon who made the statement that lack of an adequate 
airlift is one of the weakest links in our defense chain? 
General Twining. NO, I don't go that far. 
Senator Cannon. You don't believe that that is our weakest 
link. What do you believe is our weakest link then? 
Genera/ Twining. I don't think we have a real weak link. 
We have a lot of things we would like to have certainly, and

bd67 this airlift has been one of the problems that has vexed us 
for years and I think and / hope that we will get some improved 
airlift, modernize the fleet more than we have done, and we 
should do it. 
Senator Cannon. Do you think that more should be done in 
that direction than is being done at the present moment? 
General Twining. I do c yes. 
Senator Cannon. You do agree that more should be done 
toward modernizing the fleet? 
General Twining. That?s right. 
Senator Cannon. And providing additional airlift. 
General Twining. The fleet is getting kind of old now as 
you know. 
Senator Cannon. Now getting back to this all out war 
proposition and this so-called air alert, General, does the 
money in the budget for the on the shelf air alert capability 
provide for a 24 hour continuous air alert capability at 
some future time? 
General Twining. I cangt give the number but not for a 
fourth but for a limited number of aircraft, yes. 
Senator Cannon. Be sure you understand my question 
there. Does it provide for a continuous 24 hour alert capabil-
ity at some future time for a portion of the SAC forces? 
General Twining. For one year, yes, for a very limited 
portion though, not anything like General Power wants.

571 
bd68 Senator Cannon. I think that General Power stated if 
I remember correctly in open session, he testified to about 
one-eighth, but this is simply to get it in a position to go 
on an air alert and not to actually carry out that capability 
for any continuous period of time. Do you agree with that? 
General Twining. That's right, an air alert I feel should 
be something that you have a capability of doing and you use 
it when you want to do it. 
Senator Cannon. I think that Genera/ Power stated in open 
session that he estimated it would take about 600 million to 
get SAC in a condition to carry out a continuous air alert 
with the requirements that he foresaw. 
Now as I understand the budget, there is 20 million 
this year and 90 million next year for this so-called on the 
shelf capability, is that correct? 
General Twining. I think it is a little bit more than 
that. I think this year the '61 budget is some 91 million and 
I believe in '60 they have about the equivalent of pretty close 
to 100 million. We can get those figures, but it is more 
than you have stated. 
The whole bill is about $200 million. 
Senator Cannon. Over a 2 year period. 
General Twining. That is right, '60-61. 
Senator Cannon. / see, and that would provide for the on 
the shelf capability?

bd69 General Twining. The on the shelf capability, yes, 
sir. 
572 
Senator Cannon. General Power also stated that he believed 
this danger would be the greatest within the next few years. 
That is the necessity for the air alert while our additional 
missile capability was coming into being. Do you share that 
view? 
General Twining. That looks Like you could take that 
point, but I still think with our forces and the way they are 
deployed and set up, that we are not going to have that 
deterrent gap in there. 
There is a time of relative difference in numbers of 
ICBMs between the two countries I would say, yes. 
Senator Cannon. Would you say it is the time of the lowest 
position insofar as our deterrent capability is concerned, 
the next 3 or 4 years? 
General Twining. Well, it might be. 
Senator Cannon. Do you think it would be? 
General Twining. It could be, yes. 
Senator Cannon. I think that was the testimony of a 
number of people. 
General Twining. Yes. 
Senator Cannon. Who have appeared before us. As a 
matter of facto General Power said that he foresaw the 
maximum period of need for an air alert to extend perhaps fox 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6

573 
bd70 five years. As I recall, General Taylor said -- General 
(:) White rather said he thought the maximum need would go through 
possibly 1963. Now do you agree that General Power's theory 
(:) of an air alert would cost approximately 600 million this 
year, and one billion a year thereafter for such time as we 
needed to keep it in effect? 
General Twining. I think that is pretty close. 
Senator Cannon. Now if General White was correct in his 
analysis that we would need it in his opinion through 1963: 
then we would be talking here about figures of 600 million for 
the '61 budget and a billion for the '62 and a billion for 
the '63, is that correct, a total of a little less than $3 
billion? 
General, donut you believe that that is a pretty good 
life insurance policy for this country for that amount of 
money? 
General Twining. Sure it is a good life insurance policy, 
but I think the other, the on the shelf capability is just about 
as effective, and if I was in need of the cash I would put 
that money in some other programs than a full airborne alert, I 
think something else of high priority. 
Senator Cannon. What programs would you put it in? 
General Twining. I would put it in an offensive weapons 
system of some kind. 
Senator Cannon. Well, what kind?

bd71 General Twining. More missiles. 
Senator Cannon. You would put it in more missiles? 
General Twining. Yes. As I say: you don't need it but if 
/ had to spend it that would not be my first priority. 
Senator Cannon. You said you would put it in more 
missiles. I think General Schriever testified if we started 
doing something now we couldnt bring any more missiles into 
the inventory until the end of 062 or early '63. 
General Twining. That is correct, but my point is if I had 
to spend the money / think that would be a better investment 
than going to a full airborne alert, that is all. 
I wouldn't advise the missile business. 
Senator Cannon. When you say the full airborne alert. 
General Twining. That General Power wants. 
Senator Cannon. That is General Power's recommendation. 
General Twining. Yes: sir. 
Senator Cannon. What other areas would you put that 
little less than $3 billion in? 
General Twining. I would like to have it go into Polaris 
or the Minuteman? speed them up. As I say again I don't 
advise it but if I had to spend the money -- in other words, 
we end up with this, we have nothing for this $3 billion 
you are talking about. By my system I don't think we are 
going to get like a lot of people do so I say put this in 
an offensive weapons system so When you end up the period you

bd72 have something for your 3 or 4 or 5 billion dollars. When you 
end up with the air alert you have nothing but some wornout 
airplanes. 
Senator Cannon. But you have some trained crews and 
air alert in the meantime? 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Senator Cannon. Prepared to make a strike if a surprise 
attack is made against us and if a surprise attack is made 
against us and those airplanes are on the ground, they are 
no good to us axe they, General? 
General Twining. That's right. We don't want to get 
caught on the ground. 
Senator Cannon. Now General Taylor made this statement 
before the committee, and I would like to get your views on it: 
General. He said: "Meanwhile the trend of relative military 
strength is against us. Our manned bomber force is a dwindling 
military asset." 
With the present program of the manned bomber force do you 
consider that to be a dwindling military asset? 
General Twining. / certainly don't. It has, it is going 
up through 1963 in numbers. I disagree heartily on that. 
Senator Cannon. General Taylor said "Our long-range 
missile force is limited in size/ uncertain in reliability 
and immobile upon exposed bases." Do you agree with that? 
General Twining. I think part of it is right. We don't

bd73 have the hardening completed, but our plan is to harden these 
miesiles and they will be well protected and as far as reliability 
goes, I think they are proving out very well, much better than 
we hoped for. 
Senator Cannon. There is no question but what it is limited 
in size and immobile upon exposed bases at the present timee 
isn't that true, General? 
General Twining. At this moment, yes. 
Senator Cannon. General Taylor also stated "We have no 
antimissile defense in being or in sight. There is no effec-
tive fall out protection for our civil population." 
Do you agree with that statement? 
General Twining. I do at the moment. 
Senator Cannon. General Taylor also made some recommenda-
tions for immediate measures that we might take, and I will 
read them to you. 
He stated: "We can improve our readiness for limited 
war by better use of our existing resources. We can at least 
partially offset the missile gap by using Jupiter as a mobile 
field weapon as it was intended, by an airborne alert for 
part of SAC, and by the initiation of a simple fall out 
protection program for our civil population." 
Do you agree with those views, General? 
General Twining. No, I don't agree with all of them. 
/ don't think Jupiter by any stretch of the imagination can be

bd74 called a mobile weapon. That is Number one. Ifyou have 
seen them you can see that they are pretty big. In this day 
and age we have to have a weapon of less weight, the Pershing 
is very good. The Army is building Pershing. The other one 
on shelters, I don't think that is really a military problem. 
That is something that we have an organization in the 
Administration to look after that, and they are studying 
that now and there is a lot of thought being put on the 
shelter program, but it is just not that simple to say let's 
build a shelter program and build one. It is going to take a 
lot of thinking. 
Senator Cannon. And you have already answered the one on air-
borne alert so I tak it you don't agree with any part of his 
views then as to What we might do at present. 
Thank you very much, General. 
Genera/ Twining. I don't want to give the opinion that / 
don't think highly of General Taylor. 
I think he is a wonderful officer. I served with him for 
four years on the Joint Staff and he is a most outstanding 
individual. 
But he is very dedicated on these things. He has written 
his book. He thinks highly of them and he had his chance 
in the JCS to expound on them, also the Secretary of Defense 
and the President of the United States he went to with his 
problems and some of the committees of Congress, and they

Senator Stennis. All right, Senator Martin, you have 10 
minutes. 
Senator Martin, General Taylor, in your prepared state-
ment you made the statement: 
81n analyzing our posture versus that of an enemy, 
we utilized national intelligence of the highest degree of 
sensitivity." 
And again later on down in the statement you made 
this statement: 
"Our planning process is continuous as is our intelligence 
process." 
Now from those statements I gather that you have access 
to al/ intelligence reports that are available to other 
members of the Armed Services? 
General Twining. Yes, sir. 
Senator Martin. Doyou have access to all intelligence 
reports that are available to Mr Dulles and his organization? 
General Twining. I think that we have access to every 
single thing that is being done in an intelligence way for 
the security of this country.

make this statement, which I think is very important: 
"1 believe that we have enough military strength today 
to carry out our assigned missions." 
General Twining, Yes, sir. 
Senator Martin. I have considerable confidence in your 
judgment in the matter without trying to pick to pieces the 
various fragments of your thinking and approach to that 
conclusion. 
I also agree very strongly with this statement, and it 
has been my own Observation through my lifetime that the 
military professional is never satisfied with the forces at 
his command. I have tried to bear that in mind during the 
entire hearings we have had here. 
Now these intelligence reports that you rely upon do 
change frequently and quite extensively, do they not? 
General Twining. Yes. 
Senator Martin. And a person can be well primed on 
intelligence reports one month and may be out of date one 
month or six months later, ish2t that true? 
General Twining. It could be, and they do change quite 
frequently, some of them. 
Senator Martin. I hope out of these hearings we do not 
create the impression that Congress is getting away from its 
role for creating and maintaining our forces.

I hope that we do not undertake to Interfere with 
strategic planning and the making of taotica/ decisions. 
That is my own positionc. 
I just want that in the Record at this point. I have 
tremendous confidence in your ability as Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff m and I want to get that on the record right 
now, and I commend you very highly for your statement. 
General Twining. I just want to state I think that is 
the greatest thing we have, and I think it is fine that the 
Congress does take the interest to investigate and find out 
what is going on. It is very Important to the security of 
the country. 
Senator Martin. It is absolutely a good program of 
planning and congressional action, and as long as we do not 
allow it to disturb us too much in strategic planning and 
tactical decisions, it Is all to the good. 
General Twining. That is right. 
Senator Martin, I believe that is the spirit in which 
you are taking this inquiry here today.

General Twining, with the recent publication of hearings 
on the military budget before the House Appropriations 
Committee, it was revealed that there is a vide, even complete 
divergence of opinion between the Air Force and the Army on 
the advisability or even the necessity of placing missiles 
in Alaska. 
Are you familiar, General, with the testimony given on 
the subject before the House committee? 
General Twining, I am sorry I am not, but I am quite 
surprised at that, because we have just recently, as you 
know, gone into this problem, and the chiefs, the Army did 
not present that problem you just brought up at that time. 
Senator Bartlett. In the testimony published that came 
to my attention only yesterday: maybe it was published only 
yesterday, the Army, through Secretary Brucker, urged that 
I1B141s be placed in Alaska, and the Air Force dissented from 
this conclusion, and suggested that Alaska was defensible 
by the use of ICBM,s placed in the interior of the United 
States. 
Now General Twining, has this been a subject for 
discussion and decision by the Joint Chiefs? 
General Twining. Yes, it has. 
Senator Bartlett, And by the Secretary of Defense? 
General Twining, Yes.

this issue within the Joint Chiefs? 
General Twining. No, 
Senator Bartlett, General, I believe that man is or 
could be more familiar with Alaska than you are, because you 
served there as Commander In Chief of the Alaskan Command 
through some critical and constructive years so far as Alaska 
is concerned. 
I should like to ask you if it is not true, General 
Twining, that the present Commander In Chief of the Alaskan 
Command is an Air Force officer? 
General Twining. That is correct, 
Senator Bartlett. And a very distinguished, able out-
standing officer? 
General Twining. Yes, sir. 
Senator Bartlett. Lt. Gen, Frank A. Armstrong. 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Senator Bartlett, Is it not true, General Twining, that 
with General Armstrong, it was General Armstrong himself 
who urged in a very dramatic, unexpected public speech, that 
it is Imperative not so much for the security of Alaska but 
for the security of the whole United States that IBMs be 
placed in the 49th state without delay? 
General Twining, That Is correct, and he made that 
recommendation to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Senator Bartlett. And he made it publicly: did he not?

General Twining. Yes. 
(:) Senator Bartlett. Now I am not going to say here the 
number of bases in Siberia at which the Russians are said 
(:) to have missile sites, although I take it that this no 
special secret. It has been published even if not widely. 
General, in a, statement published by the Air Force in 
the House Appropriations Committee, it was said that the 
Siberian situation should be taken care of by the ICBMs in 
the interior of the United States. I am wondering, and I 
put this to you as a question, if the United States, within 
the foreseeable future, would have a sufficient number of 
ICBMs to take out the Siberian bases much less accomplish 
(:) other military missions, granted the number of bases there? 
General Twining. Yes, sir. We will have to take out 
those bases. Those bases are the closest to the United 
States, and they would be very high on our target priority 
system with ICBMs, or it might be with bombers when the 
time came. 
Senator Bartlett. Are there going to be enough ICBM1s 
to do that? 
General Twining. Yes, there will have to be, because 
that is a very, very high priority target up there. 
Senator Bartlett. I was somewhat interested, very 
interested in fact by the statement presented to the House 
Appropriations Committee by the Air Force on this subject, 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6

because it did say this is a mission for ICBMs, Only a 
few months ago the Air Force said, as I recall, this Is a 
mission for SAC bombers, is that correct? 
General Twining, Well, it might be. They will change 
as these missiles come in, the targets will be changed. 
Of course up to now it has been all bombers because we 
haventt had the long-range missiles, But as the missiles 
come in, some of these targets will be shifted over from 
the bombers to the missiles as the micsiles are ready to take 
0 
0 
over, 
Senator Bartlett. And is it not true, General Twining, 
that in a public declaration General Armstrong said it will 
be too late if we have to rely upon bombers coming from 
Omaha or elsewhere in the interior of the United States, 
because it is a matter of minutes until these missiles can 
hit here, and he said this is a subject of concern not so 
much for Alaska but because if war came, the enemy could then 
come to Alaska and, using those fields, bomb West Coast 
cities and, as I recall, he said Chicago, and then went on 
to declare that at that time the President would have to make 
the hard decision of whether to bomb our former bases in 
Alaska then held by the Russians, or subject all the cities 
in the United States to bomber attack, if the Russians chose 
to unleash a fleet of bombers against us from these great 
bases of ours in Alaska.

Now General Twining, it was stated in the testimony 
(:) before the House Appropriations Committee that General 
Armstrong was at the recent conference at Norfolk, and the 
Oimplication was that he made no complaint against the decision 
reached by the Department of Defense on this matter. 
Is it not true that a military judgment had been imposed 
upon him, and he could go no further with this? ' 
General Twining. I think that is right, and I just want 
to tell you that this question of placing weapons in Alaska, 
intermediate range missiles or something else, is not a 
closed book. I mean this is something we keep looking at 
all the time, 
Senator Bartlett, It is being actively considered? 
(2) 
General Twining. Yes, oh, yes. 
Senator Bartlett, Is it true, General I have read 
this, I do not know whether it is or not --
General Twining. But at the moment the decision was 
made not to, and General Armstrong was notified, that. is 
correct, and he could do nothing more about it. 
Senator Bartlett. Is it true, do you know if you can 
tell us -- I have read this -- that we have sought to station 
some IFIBMIs on the land of some of our allies, and some of

General a distinguished officers seeks them imperatively, 
the decision is not to place them for the immediate protection 
of the whole United States, is that right? 
General Twining. That is correct. 
Senator Bartlett, General Twining, one final question. 
It is often said in situations like this that the Ideal 
Commander always wants more, he always asks for more. 
Do you think this is comparable to that? Isn't it true 
that if missiles were placed there, the Commander in Chief 
of the Alaskan Command* who would not be General Armstrong 
his time there is coming to an end -- would have not more 
and more to boss but less and less? 
You have no doubt, have you, General Twining, that this 
recommendation on General Armstrongs part was that of a 
dedicated officer gravely concerned with the situation he 
confronts across from Siberia. Will you agree with that, 
General? 
General Twining. Yes. 
Senator Bartlett. General, we are aware of the fact, 
are we not, and this has been published, that the Russians 
have made tremendous developments in Siberia In military 
bases, construction of airfields and surrounding sites? 
General Twining. Yes, they have done a great deal of 
work in Siberia.

Obeen steadily reduced? 
General Twining. It has been reduced some, yes, not too

Senator Bartlett. And this tremendous Russian build-up 
has taken place with an accelerated pace right across the 
Bering Straits from Alaska. That is a matter of common 
knowledge and not intelligence, is it not, General Twining?

Obut the Senate has gone into session, and after we have 
concluded the open hearing, we will have an executive session. 
We have the choice here that Mr, Allen Dulles presented 
earlier, and General Twining indicated his testimony should 
not be in open hearing, I think that is correct, and we will 
go into that in a short session. 
Senator Case, you are recognized next. 
Senator Case, Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, 
I wonder if you, counsel and my colleagues and the general 
will stop me from asking any questions that involve security. 
I am just anxious to get as much information and opinion from 
the general based upon the facts. 
Senator Stennis. The Chair leaves that largely to the

general himself. He is a better judge than the Chair is I 
think on those matters. 
Senator Case. This relates to the question largely 
of matters whether they have or have not been discussed 
previously in open or closed sessions, and my memory may 
not be completely accurate about it. 
It is my recollection, just in preparation for the 
question, General, that General Power in open session did 
state the percentage of his force that he wanted on airborne 
alert, I think that is correct. 
Senator Stennis. No, not in open session. 
Senator Case. Not the percentage? 
Senator Stennis. That is what I understand. The Chair 
thought to the contrary. I am advised the only thing he 
said in open session was that he desired twice as much as 
he was given. 
Senator Case, Yes, that was the very question that I 
wanted to ask. Then I think I an right that you did give a 
figure today as to what percentage General Power wanted, 
General Twining. 
General Twining, I don,t recall that. I shouldn,t 
0 have, 
Senator Case. I think you did, but I dont want in 
any way to press you to answer that, because I dont want to 
get into anything,

General Twining. I don't think that ought to be 
discussed in open session. 
Senator Stennis. That is a closed session matter. / 
Othink the Senator tram New Jersey is correct. 
Senator Case. Is it accurate, can we go this far, and 
I dont want to press you to say yes if you think not. Is 
General Power's statement that he got about half what he was 
after a correct statement? 
General Twining. I didn,t get that. 
Senator Case, Is General Power's statement, which the 
Chairman just repeated, that he got about half the air alert 
that he was after a correct statement? 
O General Twining. I think that is about right. 
Senator Case. About right. And it is subject to this 
qualification, isn't it? 
General Twining. Yes, about ha/f. 
Senator Case. Then there is a difference, besides the 
difference in size, there is a difference that what has been 
authorized would provide an on-the-shelf capability both as 
to mechanical parts and men, I take it, to be available as 
I recall it approximately -- was the date given in open 
session? 
Then I won't pursue that. You did maks this statement: 
that your judgment was that the amount of capacity provided 
for under present funding, that is in the two budgets, I6o and

161, was equivalent used on an intermittent basis to as much 
or more than the amount General Power requested, if used only 
on a full 24-hour alert basis. That was in general the 
subject of your testimony. 
General Twining, No, it is less. I said somewhere 
around two hundred million total program in the budget. 
Senator Case. No, this is the question of the value 
of what was provided for in the budget. Used on an intermit-
tent basis, you thought it was almost as great. 
General Twining. Yes, I think so. 
Senator Case. As the 24-hour alert of the amount 
General Power wanted or perhaps even a larger one. 
General Twining. I dont think if General Power had 
the authority and money and equipment to run it 24 hours a 
day around the clock all the time, that he would do it. He 
just wouldnit choose to do it I an sure. 
But I donit think so as a commander. He would kind of 
play it by ear too. He is a pretty smart fellow, and I think 
that is what he would do. He wouldn!t put it up there and 
grind it 24 hours a day all year long. 
Senator Case. You made quite a point of this, General, 
and the fact that it would be used on this intermittent basis 
would make it additionally valuable and useful as a deterrent. 
General Twining. That is right. 
(2) Senator Case, But isnit this true, and perhapsyou have

already taken this into account. 
(7) Assuming you have a period of tension, of strategic war, 
and you decide to put everything you can in the air for an 
airborne alert, that your capacity to keep this there for 
any length of time is 
General Twining. Yes, sir, that is the idea of this. 
Senator Case. Unless you are able to do this for an 
extended period, maybe for months, the situation might go 
against you rather badly. I take it you are taking that 
into account also? 
General Twining. And I think on this on-the-shelf 
capability you have got enough for those periods when 
tension exists, and you want to keep the force up for a 
while. I think we can do that on this concept the budget 
provides for. 
Senator Case. The rest of my questions I think have 
to wait until executive session. 
Senator Stennis,. Very well, Senator Case. Thank you. 
Senator Bush? 
Senator Bush, General Twining, I want to speak of the 
matter of disclosing so much information that we do in these 
hearings and otherwise, 
Yesterday I raised a point with Admiral Burke, and I 
am going to read in a moment from the record, But it seems 
to me that inasmuch as we have been warned by the highest 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
wslIt 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
592 
military officers that we have that we are in a very grave 
and dangerous situation today, and likely to remain in one 
for the next two or three years at least, that a great deal 
of the information that is given to this committee should 
come to it in closed session, and the same way over at the 
House. 
In saying this, I do not single out any Senator or 
Member of the House in a critical way, but I do express very 
grave concern for our country, because I believe we are 
disclosing much too much information to potential enemies of 
this country. 
Not only are we disclosing to them what our own plans 
for the future are respecting development of weapons and so 
forth year by year, and the course thereof, but we are 
disclosing to them our own estimate of their own plans day 
after day. I think this is very dangerous. 
Now I believe that the Congress should be fully advised 
as to what the situation is, but this is a representative 
form of government, and one of the advantages of it is that 
the representatives of the people can. act as representatives 
of the people, and they should, in matters where the national 
security Is involved. 
I recall in World War II we spent enormous sums of money 
on a thing called the Manhattan Project, which later resulted 
in the atomic weapon that brought the war to a sudden end in 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
ws15 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
593 
the summer of 1945, and that project was going on in various 
parts of this country, but nobody knew what it was. 
The people of this country didn't know what it was. 
I don't believe the enemy knew much about it. At any rate, 
it was a very well kept secret for a period of two or three 
years, and a tremendous project into which hundreds of millions 
of dollars went. And the Members of the Congress no doubt 
must have known something about it because they appropriated 
the money, but it wasnit given out in these open sessions. 
So I raised this question yesterday with Admiral Burke, 
and I am just going to read a part of what I said to him, and 
because he mentioned your name, I am going to ask you to 
respond to this question. I said, in view of the statements 
of General Power and General Taylor and others: 
"I just wonder whether it is wise for us to disclose 
so mush information, practically everything about our military 
posture and our intentions and our plans." 
And I might add here our estimates of the Soviet 
capabilities and intentions and plans. 
"Is this something that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have 
ever considered or not? 
"Admiral Burke, Yes, sir. This is one of the most 
serious problems confronting us in this country, and there is 
apparently no way we can keep the information from going out. 
"We have to put out contraots for things, They are all 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
594 
published. We can?t keep anything, any of our own equipment 
secret for very long. Everyone knows the location of what 
we plan on doing, let alone what we have done. It is a very 
serious problem, sir, And I do agree with General Twining 
in his very strong feelings on this, sir." 
Would you tell the committee what your feelings. are 
about this matter? 
General Twining. This is a very difficult problem: 
because I know full well that the Members of the Congress are 
trying to get the facts up here and do a job: and they feel 
much of this information the public should have and are 
entitled to, and I certainly go along with that. The public 
should have some of this information. But where do you draw 
the line? There is the difficult thing, 
Senator Bush. We have got to rely on you to draw the 
line; General, 
General Twining. We mark these things top secret. We 
mark them secret and all that, and we have executive sessions. 
But things just seem to get out that shouldn,t get out, 
and I don,t know how you are going to control it in a 
democracy like ours. 
Senator Bush, Do you think it is a hopeless proposition? 
General Twining, It is not hopeless because we do have 
some secrets that havenft leaked out yet, but they are 
getting fewer every day I would say. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6

Senator Bush. I would suggest that if it is as serious 
a problem as it is apparently thought to be in the Joint 
(2) 
Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Burke certainly didn,t hesitate 
to say that he thought it was a very serious problem --
General Twining. I do too. 
Senator Bush. -- that the representatives of the 
Defense Department from the Secretary on down would demand 
that their testimony on these very sensitive points be held 
in executive session, and I am sure that the Congress would 
be glad to cooperate. 
General Twining. I think you are exactly right, and I 
would like to see it done that way, because I think this can 
(:) be very dangerous to our security. 
It is the little things, not that anyone person does 
anything bad, but when these people add it all up, the 
people on the receiving end add these things all up, they 
really get the whole business. These newspaper people are 
pretty smart. I hope that something can be done about this, 
I really do. 
Senator Bush. Donit blame the newspaper people. 
General Twining. No. 
Senator Bush. For trying to get the information. They 
(2) are all here as our guests. 
General Twining. Not at all. 
Senator Bush. My point is that what you have said here 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6

today will probably be in the papers in Moscow in the morning: 
and all over the world, in Japan, China and every place else, 
General Twining. And this isn,t limited to the Congress 
either. It happens in practically everything we do, every 
group we have, wherever it is around the world, Things just 
seem to get out, and they shouldnIt get out. 
Senator Bush. My suggestion is, General, that you as 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs -- and I am going to make the 
same suggestion to the Secretary when he comes should not 
hesitate to refuse to, answer questions on the basis of 
security, arid 'offerat the same time to: answer them in 
executive session. 
I think we should have a lot more executive sessions 
and a lot less public discussion of these very, very 
sensitive matters. 
General Twining, I certainly go along with,you on that. 
Senator Bush, Thank you very much, 
Senator Stennis. Thank you, Senator. Are there other 
matters now in open session? Mr. Weisel, do, you have some-
thing? 
Mr. Weisel, I just want to make this observation, 
General Twining, 
General, Secretary Gates testified in open session that 
Secretary McElroy over television discussed these figures 
by saying that in his opinion, based on these figures, there

597 
would be in the future a three to one superiority. It was 
not the committee. It was Secretary McElroy who, over 
television, made that statement. 
General Twining, Well, I didn't infer that any of the 
committee had leaked anything. 
Mr. Weisel. Here is the testimony of Secretary Gates: 
"Last week he stated: 'Mr. McElroy made such a state-
ment in his testimony last year. He also made that state-
ment on a television program in December,'" 
Senator Bush. What is the purpose of counsel's reading 
this? I don't quite understand it. 
Mr. Weisel, To show that these things aren't originated 
by the committee. They are originated by the officials of 
the Defense Department, 
Senator Bush. I didn't say they were originated by the 
committee. I didn't point the finger at anybody, but I do 
say that I would regret that Mr. McElroy did exactly what 
he did then, if it involved sensitive information. 
Mr, Weisel. That is right. 
Senator Bush. Counsel seems to be a little sensitive 
on this, but I can assure him, as I did yesterday, that I 
know he is only carrying out the wishes of this committee, 
for which I commend him, because I think he has done it very 
well for several years. 
But that isn't the point that I am talking about at all.

I am talking about the general policy not only of 
this committee but over in the House and in the Defense 
Department too. I think there should be a lot more security 
observed. 
Mr. Weisel. Thank you, Senator. I think also, General 
Twining, you made the public statement as follows, if I 
quote you correctly: 
"I can also inform this committee that the over-all 
military capability of the Soviet Union has not been down-
graded." 
General Twining. That is the over-all military 
capability, yes. 
Mr. Weisel. Thank you.. 
Senator Stennis. All right, gentlemen of the committee. 
.Senator Symington. I have a question I would like to 
ask. 
Senator Stennis. It appears here now that we will have 
an executive session, as the Chair has already indicated. 
It is now 12:15, and there is no way to accurately 
determine how long that session will be. It seems in view 
of all these conditions, that we can hardly get to the 
Secretary this afternoon. 
So suppose, when we complete with the general in 
executive session, that we recess subject to the call of the 
Chair, and we will have the Secretary at some convenient

time. 
599 
(:) Now we will have the further questions in open session, 
and then go into executive session. Senator Symington? 
(:) Senator Symington. Genera/ Twining, yesterday the 
Secretary of State, and I think this is important, because 
I saw it several times on a telecast, was asked this question: 
"Mr. Secretary, last November at a news conference you 
told us that you had thought the Russians had come a very 
long way on Berlin since November of 1958 when they were 
threatening to throw us out. Now in the past two or three 
months Mr. Khrushchev seems to have became a little tougher 
on it I am thinking particularly of his statement that if 
we dont make a peace treaty on his terms, he will sign a 
treaty with East Germany with all the consequences that 
entails. 
"Do you feel that since you talked to us in November 
on that, he has became tougher in his position?" 
The answer given by Secretary Herter was: 
"Yes, I think that is the only way we can interpret the 
statement if it had been made since that time." 
Now later on in the same press conference, and I think 
this is very important from the standpoint of the American 
people, I am not one who has been giving out this information, 
but I think if any information is given out, it should be the 
correct information, and I know you agree with me on that: 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
60o 
"Queation. Mr, Secretary, the Soviet Union apparently 
is leading the United States, according to some critics, in 
a military posture vis-a-vis the United States, First of all, 
sir, do you think this is so? Are the Soviets ahead of us 
in military strength through missiles, and, secondly, if this 
is so, does this account for the stiffening Soviet attitude 
on such questions as Berlin?" 
I want to read this all because I want to be sure not 
to get anything out of context. ,The answer was: 
"Well, in the first place you are asking me to get into 
the current estimate of relative strength, on which I think 
a great deal has been said by much better experts than I am 
in this field. Whoever has done the estimating I think has 
agreed that the Soviets are gaining in strength in the missile 
field." 
May I point out to you that is the statement of the 
Secretary of State yesterday, one of the finest public 
officials, public servants it has ever been, my privilege to 
know. He goes on: 
"It is possible that the Soviets feel that their 
increased strength from a military point of view, not 
necessarily from the point of view of being able to take on 
the offensive, without an unacceptalbe retaliatory strike, 
but from the point of view of their defensive capacity, has 
made them, has given them great assurance in what they are 
npriassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/12/03: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601190001-6 
ws23 601 
saying in the international field.. But there again that is 
only speculation, and I think that sometimes it is unfruitful 
to get into speculation of that sortO . 
"Question. Mr. Secretary, in that same vein, sir, do 
you think that the United States ought to make a greater 
effort to close the gap then if this is creating a sense of 
increased strength on the part of the Soviets in their dealings 
with us and the rest of the free world? 
"Answer" -- and this is what I was getting at -- "Now 
you are getting into a very technical field, the question of 
the closing of the gap. This is a matter that has, of course, 
been given a great deal of very serious consideration by 
people in the administration, by people up on the Hill: and 
(:) there are some conflicting views in our military on the 
subject. 
"In so far as I aa concerned, I have heard a number 
of discussions on this matter, and have faith in the 
Presidents and the Joint Chiefs and Mr. Gates, evaluation 
that we are taking steps to close that gap as effectively 
and as soon as we can, and that there will not be a disparity 
In strength in the coming years which would, in itself 
tempt the Russians to make a sudden attack upon us." 
Now I have here the figures that were given us. If we 
are talking about the missile gap: letls not get into the 
question of what we all know, that their ICBMs are estimated

to be far more powerful than ours, because of the amount 
of payload in the third stage of the lunar thrust, and so 
forth. I am not interested in this bottom part. 
But with the premise that a missile in a cave that 
can't be launched doesnit mean anything, that what is able 
to be launched against this country is what counts, show 
me any evidences if you will, on what was given us by the 
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Captain Gray, 
will you take this piece of paper please? 
Captain Gray. Do you want M2 to show it to the 
general, Senator? 
Senator Symington. Yes, I would like to see if there 
is anything there that justifies the American people in 
believing that any missile gap is being closed -- you have a 
representative of the Joint Chiefs on the National Intelligence 
Board, each service has, There are the figures. 
General Twining. There is no way to answer this in
