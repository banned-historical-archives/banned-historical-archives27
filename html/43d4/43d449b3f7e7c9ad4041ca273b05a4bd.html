 STATOTHR
 29 April 1958
 Dear Mr. Dulles ;
 Your speech before the United States Chamber of
 Commerce was most sobering. Interestingly, it bore out in detail
 the testimony of the many informed persons whom we have had here
 in consultation on the problems of international communism. Some
 months ago, for example, we heard several businessmen who deal in
 the international market. They agreed with economists and professors
 and the conclusions were precisely those which you pointed up in
 your excellent presentation.
 You also hinted at something which I think is vital
 to our national interests, namely, the assumption of the psychological
 offensive in this idealogical contest. The Western or free world
 tendency to play for the headlines has been to communist advantage.
 Much of our counter-propaganda has been clumsily executied, even
 to the point of being responsible for communist recriuitments. It is
 clearly pointless to refute communist claims - such refutation has
 only the effect of repeating the slogans and symbols. We found in
 RIAS that the most successful counterppropaganda was always the
 ati,ack coupled with complete disregard for counter-attack or counter
 claims. We never repeated their charges nor did we try to refute
 them. We let them die in the sterile atmosphere of distain.
 Enclosed herewith is something new, the first
 consultation in a series dealing with communist psychological
 warfare. You may find it of interest.
 Perhaps the massive evidence which you presented
 to the Chamber of Commerce will have some effect on our industrial
 community. It seems to me that less trunk space in the 1960 auto
 might be a small contribution to our preservation. There are a
 lot of unanswered questions raised in your speech, the number one
 being "what the hell are we going to do about it?" I hope that
 some serious thinking is done as a result.
 Warm Regards

 SYNOPSIS
 Communist psychological warfare is now winning such extensive
 victories; n the United States that the Red bloc will not need to employ
 direct military force against us in order to win the total war which
 they are waging, with this country the principal target, Edward
 Hunter, American expert on Communist brainwashing, warned in a
 consultation with the staff of the Committee on Un-American Activi-
 ties.
 Mr. Hunter, whose career as a foreign correspondent, author, editor,
 world traveler, and specialist in propaganda warfare, qualifies him as
 an authority on Communist propaganda techniques, stated:
 "I spent 30 years, a little bit more perhaps, in countries under
 various forms of Communist pressure and attack.  What I am wit-
 nessing in America is no different from what I saw in those other
 countries.  I am often referred to as someone who has made phe-
 nomenal predictions that proved correct on things to come.  Actually,
 I have never made a prediction as such in my life. I have only pre-
 dicted in the manner that one predicts the total of 4 after seeing the
 figures 2 plus 2.
 "I have been watching developments under communism in other
 parts of the world, and now I see exactly the same developments
 here in America."
 These developments, he continued, "include, first of all, the pene-
 tration of our leadership circles by a softening up and creating a
 defeatist state of mind.  This includes penetration of our educational
 circles by a similar state of mind, in addition to one other thing-the
 long-range perspective of the professor who is above anything that is
 happening here and now, and considers himself as an objective specta-
 tor in a long, long vista of history.
 "I see, primarily, as part of this softening up process in America, the
 liquidation of our attitudes on what we used to recognize as right and
 wrong, what we used to accept as absolute moral standards.  We
 now confuse moral standards with the sophistication of dialectical
 materialism, with a Communist crackpot theology which teaches that
 everything changes, and that what is right or wrong, good or bad,
 changes as well.  So nothing they say is really good or bad. There is
 no such thing as truth or a lie; and any belief we actually held was
 simply our being unsophisticated.  They don't say this in so many,
 words, except to those who are already indoctrinated in communism.
 What they do say to the rest of us is to be objective; and then they
 twist that word `objective' into meaning what they mean by dialectical
 materialism."
 "War has changed its form," Mr. Hunter declared.  "The Com-
 munists have discovered that a man killed by a bullet is useless.
 He can dig no coal.  They have discovered that a demolished city is
 useless.  Its mills produce no cloth.  The objective of Communist
 warfare is to capture intact the minds of the people and their posses-

 sions, so they can be put to use. This is the modern conception of
 slavery, that puts all others in the kindergarten age.
 "The United States is the main battlefield in this Red war.  I mean
 specificially the people and the soil and the resources of the United
 States.
 "It should be obvious to anyone who has observed the so-called
 cold war that the United States is its principal target. We need only
 read what the Communists themselves say, but we refuse to do so,
 exactly as we could not believe that Hitler meant what he said in
 Mein Kampf."
 "The first battles in this total war have already been won by the
 forces of international communism in the United States. These
 victories are identical to those they have won in every country which
 they have ultimately taken over.  They have succeeded in softening
 up a large element of the American population, particularly among
 those to whom we look for guidance, our so-called intellectuals and
 our so-called liberal circles.  They have succeeded in making the
 United States think and talk of a coexistence period as if that were
 an end in itself; while in other parts of the world, as in India, the Reds
 frankly explain that this coexistence is merely intended to give the
 Americans an easy way to choose their road toward communism.
 "This is strategy.  The Kremlin is merely giving the United States
 a choice of surrendering by voluntary change of attitude, to avoid
 more destructive ways of surrender.  Unfortunately, in the United
 States, large elements, mainly among our non-Communist population,
 have been softened up into believing that if we can just stall on this
 situation, it will take care of itself. The Reds have succeeded in
 inducing business communities to look to Soviet trade as a means of
 restoring prosperity.  Large business elements, with all their financial
 and other resources, are now being used to help the Communist
 objective of softening up America for recognition and acceptance of
 Red China, for instance."
 The Communists are being abetted in their brainwashing program
 in the United States, Mr. Hunter declared, by the collapse of tradi-
 tional American ideals of self-reliance and individual integrity.
 "The Communists have been operating for a full generation, taking
 strategic advantage of the American principles, exploiting the best
 sides in our characters as vulnerabilities, and succeeding for a genera-
 tion in changing the characteristics of Americans.  I remember when
 I was a young man, every personnel department was looking for
 leadership qualities.  What was sought was a man's capacity as an
 individual to achieve new things.  Today that is not even considered
 by personnel departments in their employment policies.  They ask,
 instead, if the man 'gets along' with everybody. They do not ask
 what is his individuality; they ask how he conforms.  When we raise
 a young man to believe that at all costs he must get on with everyone,
 we have put him into a state of mind that almost guarantees, if he
 falls into the hands of an enemy such as the Communists, that he will
 react as he had been raised, to try `to get on,' because he must not be
 `antisocial.'  Being `antisocial' has become the cardinal sin in our
 society.  We have to again go back to characteristics of ours which
 made us, as individuals, say that what is right is right, and whether
 or not it is antisocial, makes no difference.  The young man who
 broadcast for the Red Chinese was simply `getting along' as he had
 been taught to do by our educators."

 BRAINWASHING                               3
 As an example of the success the Communists are achieving,
 Mr. Hunter cited statistics on American prisoners of war in Korea.
 "Never before in history had so many captured Americans gone to
 the aid of the enemy.
 "For 2 years the services studied the records of the prisoners.
 What they found was not pretty.
 "A total of 7,190 Americans were captured.  Of these, 6,656 were
 Army troops, 263 were airmen, 231 Marines, 40 Navy men.
 "In every war in American history some men have managed to
 escape.  Korea was the exception.
 "Roughly 1 of every 3 American prisoners collaborated with the
 Communists in some way, either as informers or as propagandists.
 "In the 20 prison camps, 2,730 of the 7,190 Americans died, the
 highest mortality rate among prisoners in United States history.
 Many of them died unnecessarily.  They either did not know how
 to take care of themselves or they just lay down and quit.  Some sick
 or wounded died of malnutrition abandoned by their comrades.
 "Discipline among Americans was almost nonexistent.         It was a
 case of dog eat dog for food, cigarettes, blankets, clothes.
 "For the first time in history Americans-21 of them-swallowed
 the enemy's propaganda line and declined to return to their own
 people."
 Mr. Hunter declared that in the struggle with the Soviet Union,
 "we are losing so fast that unless we put a very drastic end to it,
 the question of who is winning will be academic in a decade."
 "People at lectures and elsewhere," he declared, "frequently ask that
 of me, as if begging me to say that we are winning.  I wish I could,
 but one only has to think of the position of the United States at the
 end of the war and compare it to now.  We only have to look at the
 map of the world as it was when we signed the peace on the battleship
 Missouri and compare it to the map now. Great areas with enormous
 populations have fallen into the hands of the Reds, not through any
 approximation to the democratic process, but through sheer power
 pressures, by psychological warfare."
 Even an ultimate superiority in military weapons may not be suffi-
 cient to guarantee the survival of the United States, Mr. Hunter
 cautioned.
 "In Korea, we bad atomic weapons, but lost the war and were unable
 to use those weapons because of a political and psychological climate
 created by the Communists.  The Kremlin today is fighting total war,
 and this means total, not with weapons of physical destruction alone,
 but mental destruction, too. The new weapons are for conquest
 intact, of peoples and cities. The future Pearl Harbor sputnik will
 be used if the situation demands it.  But not unless the Kremlin has
 first succeeded in conquering the character and minds of a large enough
 element of the American people so that it will be fitting itself into the
 desires and needs of the Communist apparatus, no matter whether
 they think of themselves as Red or anti-Communist."
 Mr. Hunter continued: "The most deadly misconception of all,
 that requires a softening up in our thinking before we can make it,
 is the idea that there are different kinds of communism, and that
 besides international communism there is something called national
 communism, which fundamentally differs.  There is nothing of the
 sort.  We are again interpreting, on the basis of wishful thinking,

 what the Communists themselves are plainly saying.  We base this
 national communism conception on Titoism.  Tito at no time dis-
 owned or expressed doubt in any of the fundamental tenets of com-
 munism, and he is today expending all the time he can in trying to
 tell the world that lie believes in communism, intends Communist
 objectives to win out in the long run all over the world. Communism
 in this, too, has been able, as always, to get the help it needs from the
 non-Communist and principally the anti-Communist world.
 "Each time there has been a crisis in Soviet Russia, it could depend
 on the outside world for help.  Today, under the theory that there
 are different forms of communism, and some Communist forms are
 not really Communist, or are less Communist than others, we are
 giving through aid programs and such propaganda assists as so-called
 exchange scholarships, the help and sustenance that these Communist
 countries require to survive.  I have heard that under certain tech-
 nical requirements of the law, completely fantastic statements have
 come from the White House and the State Department that commu-
 nism in Yugoslavia really isn't communism any more, and that
 communism in Poland is not real communism.  I thought we had
 learned our lesson in China.   We said that the communism of China,
 the communism of Mao Tse-tung was not really communism.  We
 said it was not the communism of Moscow.  Mao Tse-tung was saying
 it was the same communism, exactly as Tito says that the Communist
 ideology is basically the same everywhere, and that the objective for
 a Communist world is identical."

 COMMUNIST PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
 (BRAINWASHING)
 THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 1958
 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES,
 Washington, D. C.
 CONSULTATION
 The following consultation with Edward Hunter, author and
 foreign correspondent, was held at 10 a. in., March 13, 1958, in room
 226, Old House Office Building, Washington, D. C., pursuant to the
 authorization of the Committee on Un-American Activities com-
 posed of:
 MORGAN Al. MOULDER, Missouri                BERNARD W. KEARNEY, New York
 CLYDE DOYLE, California                     DONALD L. JACKSON, California
 EDWIN E. WILLIS, Louisiana                  GORDON H. SCHERER, Ohio
 WILLIAM M. TUCK, Virginia                   ROBERT J. McINTOSH, Michigan
 Staff members present: Richard Arens, staff director, and William
 F. Heimlich, consultant.
 Mr. ARENS. The session today is the first in a series of consulta-
 tions on the subject of the Communist psychological warfare which
 the Committee on Un-American Activities has inaugurated.
 We are pleased to welcome to the consultation today Mr. Edward
 Hunter, whose distinguished career as foreign correspondent, author,
 editor, world traveler, and specialist in psychological warfare emi-
 nently qualifies him to speak authoritatively on the subject at hand.
 STATEMENT OF EDWARD HUNTER
 l'vir. ARENS. Mr. Hunter, may I ask you if you would kindly give
 us for the purpose of this record a thumbnail sketch of your own
 personal history?
 Mr. HUNTER. I am a journalist whose career began on a newspaper
 in New Jersey, the Newark Ledger, where I became news editor, then
 went to Europe and joined the Chicago Tribune in Paris.  After an
 interlude on newspapers in America, I went to Japan to join the Japan
 Advertiser, becoming its news editor.
 A year later, I went to China and took over the Hankow Herald
 from the Communists.  The Reds had just left, and shopkeepers still
 were talking of boxes of American dollars brought in by Moscow.
 Colonel HEIMLICH. What year was that, Mr. Hunter?
 Mr. HUNTER. Between 1926 and 1928.  I remember events well,
 but not their years.
 Next I went to Peking to become managing editor of the Peking
 Leader.  I joined the Hearst newspaper syndicates in 1931, when the
 "Manchuria Incident" began. I witnessed the creation of the puppet
 state of Manchukuo.  I accompanied the League of Nations mission
 of inquiry in Manchuria and saw the coronation of Emperor Pu-yi,
 now a prisoner of the Reds.

 Hearst's International News Service then sent me to Europe abou-
 the time of the Reichstag fire and its fake trial.  I covered the con-
 quest of Ethiopia by the Italian Fascists, which took modern psycho-
 logical warfare one step beyond Manchukuo:  I also saw two civil
 wars in Spain, the outbreak in the Basque territory and the big fight,
 which was a rehearsal for World War II.
 Back to Europe, I witnessed the intrigue in the various foreign offices
 preceding the outbreak of hostilities.  I saw the Nazis take back the
 Rhineland, and how the Germany Army expected the French Govern-
 ment under Premier Flandin to exhibit determination and show up Hit-
 ler as a failure. Instead, it provided Hitler with a new demonstration
 of seemingly inevitable victory, and World War II, of course, followed.
 I returned to America just before World War II, joining the foreign
 news desk of the New York Post.  The Newspaper Guild then was
 Communist-dominated.  I set up a national committee to coordinate
 the efforts of the various anti-Communist factions.  For the first time
 in the history of trade unionism in America, the entire executive
 committee of a union was voted out, although all I did was simply
 communicate with these anti-Communist units and let them know
 they were not alone.  This election restored the Newspaper Guild
 to American instead of Moscow-orientated newspapermen.
 Colonel HEIMLICH. When the war came along, Mr. Hunter, you
 went into OSS, I understand.
 Mr. HUNTER. Yes; as a propaganda specialist.  I call that my
 sabbatical year-really 2 years-away from journalism.
 Colonel HEIMLICH. You covered a very broad area of Asia during
 the war years, didn't you?
 Mr. HUNTER. I was in what is generally known as the CBI theater:
 China, Burma, and India.
 Colonel HEIMLICH. Do you find a measurable difference between
 the attitudes of the people during that period and the present?
 Mr. HUNTER. During that period, America still had its old meaning
 to the peoples of Asia as a symbol of hope that could be relied on to
 help on a realistic basis.
 Back on the New York Post after the war, I found myself in the
 midst of a little cold war that perfectly reflected the big one.  The
 Post helped Wallace for President, and I got up a petition which almost
 everybody on the staff signed, pointing out that this did not represent
 our true feelings.  The result was a thunderbolt to the lady who
 owned the newspaper.  She fired the executives and divorced her hus-
 band, the publisher.  He went out and started the pro-Red Compass.
 I stayed on a while as foreign news editor, then returned to Asia
 as roving correspondent for the Cox newspapers.  I interviewed
 Chinese who had escaped from the Red holocaust, witnessed the jungle
 warfare in Malaya, and the war by terror in Indochina.  I traveled
 between Japan, Indonesia, and Burma.  Recently I returned after a
 year in Afghanistan.
 Mr. ARENS. Mr. Hunter, how would you characterize the struggle
 between the East and the West?
 Mr. HUNTER. We do not have a war between the East and West,
 Certainly the Filipinos are not in the West. They are mostly Asians.
 like the peoples of Thailand, Iran, and Japan.
 This expression, "the war between the East and the West," has
 become a part of our thinking processes, an example of how a phrase

 Approved For Release 2002/07/29: CIA-RDP80BO1676R0p  00080064-5
 can put great masses of people in a camp where they do not belong.
 What we really have is a total war in which a pattern for conquest by
 the Communist hierarchy is set up against the peoples of all countries
 outside the Red orbit-no matter whether they call themselves anti-
 Comniunist or neutralists.
 Mr. ARENS.  Who are the antagonists in this total war?
 Mr. HUNTER. They are the Communists on the one side and all the
 other peoples of the world on the other.  The Reds have a very prac-
 tical setup.  The antagonists, in their view, are the two strongest ele-
 ments: on the one side the Kremlin, on the other side the United States.
 Mr. ARENS. When you say there is a total war, what do you mean?
 It is obvious that there is very little shooting going on in the world
 today.  What are the devices of this total war?
 Mr. HUNTER. War has changed its form.  The Communists have
 discovered that a man killed by a bullet is useless.  He can dig no
 coal.  They have discovered that a demolished city is useless.  Its
 mills produce no cloth.  The objective of Communist warfare is to
 capture intact the minds of the people and their possessions, so they
 can be put to use.  This is the modern conception of slavery, that
 puts all others in the kindergarten age.
 Mr. ARENS. Where is this war being waged?  Where are the battle-
 fields?  What are its geographical locations?
 Mr. HUNTER. The battlefield is wherever there is no Red "peace."
 Peace, in the Communist vocabulary, is the period when all have
 accepted, in a so-called voluntary manner, the inevitability of a'
 Communist world.  The battlefields are all the countries which have
 not yet fallen into this Red orbit.  The weapons used in this war are
 adjusted to the practical situation in each of those countries.
 Mr. ARENS. What are those weapons?
 Mr. HUNTER. They range from a smile and a "discussion meeting"
 to a leaflet and a bullet.
 Mr. ARENS. Is the United States part of this battlefield?.
 Mr. HUNTER. The United States is the main battlefield in this
 Red war.  I mean specifically the people and the soil and the resources
 of the United States.
 It should be obvious to anyone who has observed the so-called cold
 war that the United States is its principal target.. We need only read
 what the Communists themselves say, but we refuse to do so, exactly
 as we could not believe that Hitler meant what he said in Mein Kampf.
 Mr. ARENS. Does this mean that the principal objective is to con-
 vert the people of the United States to communism?  Is their objec-
 tive conversion, or subversion and conquest?
 Mr. HUNTER. Since Hungary, the world should know that com-
 munism is not an ideology except as a weapon for conquest.  The
 Red objective against the United States is not the conversion of the
 American people to communism any more than it was to make true
 Communists out of the American prisoners of war in Korea. The
 Communist system is a power system, just as was that of Genghis
 Khan.  We now have the same invading armies, given a new, pious
 political phraseology, making them hypocritical in a manner that the
 original hordes never were.  The objective of all Communist conquest
 is simply use for power.  They seek to conquer the -United States in a
 manner so that it "voluntarily" falls into the Red orbit.  If we have to
 be conquered by destructive nuclear-age weapons, it will be considered

 a setback by the Kremlin.  Their objective is to make the same use of
 the American people as they make of the Czechs in the uranium
 mines in Czechoslovakia, and as they make of the Chinese in the mills
 of China.  We are to become subjects of a "New World Order" for the
 benefit of a mad little knot of despots in the Kremlin.
 Mr. ARENS. On the basis of yourbackground and experience, and as an
 intimate observer of this total war, Mr. Hunter, please express to us now
 your best appraisal of who is winning and who is losing this total war?
 Mr. HUNTER. I am always surprised to hear that question.  People
 at lectures and elsewhere frequently ask that of me, as if begging me to
 say that we are winning.  I wish I could, but one only has to think
 of the position of the United States at the end of the war and compare
 it to now.  We only have to look at the map of the world as it was
 when we signed the peace on the battleship Missouri and compare it
 to the map now.  Great areas with enormous populations have fallen
 into the hands of the Reds, not through any approximation to the
 democratic process, but through slicer power pressures, by psycho-
 logical warfare.                                                     We are losing so fast that unless we put a very
 drastic end to it, the question of who is winning will be academic in a
 decade.  People today also like to say, "This is a hundred-year war."
 Human beings cannot remain in that sort of tenseness for a hundred
 years, and the Soviet Russia regime knows it.  We are being lulled into
 feeling that although we are losing, we don't have to do anything about
 it because by the time the situation reaches a climax we will be dead.
 We may be dead, but it won't be the result of a natural death.  I try
 to avoid phrases such as "the clock is nearly striking 12," but there
 are times when they are the best descriptions of a reality, and this is
 one such time.
 Mr. ARENS. Some may ask how can you say that, Mr. Hunter,
 when we here in the United States are separated by thousands of miles
 of ocean from any potential military aggressor, when we have such
 military might and such apparent alertness to the potential threat of
 an attack by guided missiles?
 Mr. HUNTER. I wish we had alertness.  We have everything except
 alertness to the way the Kremlin is fighting this war.  We are being
 tremendously alert to the ways it is not fighting this war.
 Mr. ARENS. What do you mean by that?
 Mr. HUNTER. In Korea, we had atomic weapons, but lost the war
 and were unable to use those weapons because of a political and psycho-
 logical climate created by the Communists.  The Kremlin today is
 fighting total war, and this means total, not with weapons of physical
 destruction alone, but mental destruction, too.  The new weapons
 are for conquest intact, of peoples and cities. The future Pearl Harbor
 sputnik will be used if the situation demands it. But not unless the
 Kremlin has first succeeded in conquering the character and minds of
 a large enough element of the American people so that it will be fitting
 itself into the desires and needs of the Communist apparatus, no
 matter whether they think of themselves as Red or anti-Communist.
 Mr. ARENS. What is the nature of the victories which are being
 won by the international Communist apparatus in the United States?
 Mr. HUNTER. The first battles in this total war have already been
 won by the forces of international communism in the United States.
 These victories are identical to those they have won in every country
 which they have ultimately taken over. They have succeeded in soft

 Approved For Release 2002/07/29: CIA-RDP80B01676R
 ening up a large element of the American population, particularly
 among those to whom we look for guidance, our so-called intellectuals
 and our so-called liberal circles.  They have succeeded in making the
 United States think and talk of a coexistence period as if that were
 an end in itself; while in other parts of the world, as in India, the
 Reds frankly explain that this coexistence is merely intended to give
 the Americans an easy way to choose them road toward communism.
 This is strategy.  The Kremlin is merely giving the United States
 a choice of surrendering by voluntary change of attitude, to avoid
 more destructive ways of surrender. Unfortunately, in the United
 States, large elements, mainly among our non-Communist population,
 have been softened up into believing that if we can just stall on this
 situation, it will take care of itself.  The Reds have succeeded in
 inducing business communities to look to Soviet trade as a means of
 restoring prosperity. Large business elements, with all their financial
 and other resources, are now being used to help the Communist objec-
 tive of softening up America for recognition and acceptance of Red
 China, for instance.
 This Communist offensive has a double objective. One is the sof-
 tening up, first stage of this total war. The other is to convince the
 peoples in their own Red-dominated countries that there is no hope.
 Since the Hungarian revolt, nobody in a Communist country thinks
 any longer of a Red ideology, but only of Red power.  The over-
 whelming mass of people are against communism in each Red country,
 including Red China and Red Russia.  The only me'ins by which
 these people can be discouraged from overthrowing their despots is
 by convincing them that they stand all alone; that the free world has
 accepted communism as inevitable.
 American students, professors, and businessmen who wander
 through Red countries, in the eyes of the people there, confirm the
 Communist propaganda line that there is no hope; that the free world,
 especially America, the symbol of the free world, has given in to the
 Reds.  That was the Communist purpose at the much-publicized
 Bandung Conference, when the Asian and African countries met. The
 broadcasts to the people of China by the Peking regime stressed that
 all this proved that the outside world had recognized that Red China is
 here to stay. Any time an American student walks down a street in
 Red China, he is conveying one message to the silenced people who
 see him, and that is, "Don't look to the outside world, don't look to
 America, for help in your hour of need. We have let you down.  We are
 betraying you." There is no hate so fierce as the hate of a friend who
 feels he has been betrayed, and that is the theme of the whole world
 Communist propaganda program today; to convince the people inside
 communism, who hate it, that we have betrayed them, while convinc-
 ing the people outside of the Communist world, principally in America,
 that there is a future for what they call, in their doubletalk, coexistence.
 Mr. ARENS. What is your reaction to the suggestions which we now
 hear from many quarters that the United States of America through
 its leaders sit down at a conference table with Kruschchev and his
 associates and work out an agreement or agreements of some kind
 to solve this impasse?
 Mr. HUNTER. You can always sit down around a green table with
 the Communists and negotiate anything you wish, so long as it does
 not require actual concessions by the Communist world, but requires

 Approved For Release 2002/07/29 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R003800080064-5
 only such concessions by ourselves. That has been the uninterrupted
 record of such negotiations with the Reds.
 Mr. ARENS. What, in your judgment, would be the result of another
 summit meeting?
 Mr. HUNTER. The same as all such meetings in the past, only on
 an aggravated scale.  We had a Geneva Conference.  The results
 were broadcast throughout Asia as a stunning defeat for the free
 world.  The results in actual conquest, the taking over of non-Com-
 munist areas by the Communists, were visible to anyone who compared
 maps. The Geneva Conference was a surrender. Its "spirit of Ge-
 neva," which Prime Minister Nehru holds forth as the pattern to be
 followed by us in the future, meant no more than piecemeal surrender.
 The Reds will always give up something that is a paper promise, no
 matter what, in exchange for something tangible.  We still accept
 paper promises as equivalent to what is tangible. So long as we con-
 tinue in that delusion, such conferences serve only the purpose of
 continued chiseling away of parts of the free world.
 Mr. ARENS. Let us return to what you have characterized as the
 battleground in the United States in this total war, Mr. Hunter. It is
 quite obvious that there is no shooting going on in the United States.
 What is going on here that you can characterize or describe?
 Mr. HUNTER. I spent 30 years, a little bit more perhaps, in countries
 under various forms of Communist pressure and attack. What I am
 witnessing in America is no different from what I saw in those other
 countries. I am often referred to as someone who has made phenom-
 enal predictions that proved correct on things to come.  Actually;
 I have never made a prediction as such in my life.   I have only
 predicted in the manner that one predicts the total of 4 after seeing
 the figures 2 plus 2.
 I have been watching developments under communism in other
 parts of the world, and now I see exactly the same developments
 here in America.
 Mr. ARENS. What are those developments?
 Mr. HUNTER. They include, first of all, the penetration of our
 leadership circles by a softening up and creating a defeatist state of
 mind.  This includes penetration of our educational circles by a
 similar state of mind, in addition to one other thing-the long-range
 perspective of the professor who is above anything that is happening
 here and now, and considers himself as an objective spectator in a long,
 long vista of history. I see primarily, as part of this softening up
 process in America, the liquidation of our attitudes on what we used to
 recognize as right and wrong, what we used to accept as absolute moral
 standards. We now confuse moral standards with the sophistication
 of dialectical materialism, with a Communist crackpot theology which
 teaches that everything changes, and that what is right or wrong,
 good or bad, changes as well.  So nothing they say ?is really good or
 bad. There is no such thing as truth or a lie; and any belief we actually
 held was simply our being unsophisticated. They don't say this in
 so many words, except to those who are already indoctrinated in
 communism.  What they do say to the rest of us is to be objective;
 and then they twist that word "objective" into meaning what they
 mean by dialectical materialism.
 Mr. ARENS. Is this weakening in America coincidental with the
 Communist drive, or in your opinion, is it concocted and deliberate?

 \lr. I; UNTER. Even the most naive among us can no longer believe
 that Communist international policy is set up for all the world except
 the United States.  We have ample evidence in every country that
 has fallen under communism or which is under attack by communism,
 such as Malaya today, that the stages in this softening up process,
 which is part of their total war, did not just happen.  They were
 planned by a political and military strategy board.  They have their
 same strategy, with the same planning, in the United States as they
 had in China, and as they are doing in Malaya, and as they have done
 everywhere they have conquered.
 Mr. ARENS. What is the mechanism in the United States?
 Mr. HUNTER. We are again talking of the obvious, except that it is
 obvious on so bold and broad a scale that we "just can't believe it."
 How often I hear that soporific phrase.  The mechanism in the
 United States operates in exactly the same way as elsewhere.
 In Korea, we persisted in talking of just a Korean war.  The
 Communists never talked of just a Korean war; they talked of an
 all-Asia war.  The advantage they derived from this was decisive.
 Whereas the British were dealing simply with a Malaya war, and the
 French with an Indochina war, and the Americans with a Korean
 war, the Communists were dealing with one front and one war, and
 moved their propaganda and fighting forces around according to the
 need.  The United States has a Communist Party, and those who say
 that this is a weak party simply because it doesn't have millions of
 members are deceiving themselves.  This committee has produced
 volumes and volumes which prove the existence of fifteen or twenty
 thousand hardshell Communists in the United States, with a knot of
 hard-core Communist leaders.  A huge, bulky party , would not
 achieve the results they can.  A small, powerfully knit element that
 can manipulate the non-Communist elements in the population is
 located in our nerve centers, where they can first paralyze us, and
 then defeat us.
 Mr. ARENS. How would you characterize the Communist Party in
 the United States?
 Mr. HUNTER.  It is superficially a joke; but behind the facade are
 the real Communist operators.  They know exactly what they are
 doing, and they adapt exactly what they are doing to the require-
 ments and strategy of world communism.  The Communist Party of
 America is simply one of the fingers on the two hands of world com-
 munism, and operates just as obediently to the mind of communism.
 We are again engaging in doublet.alk when we talk of the Communist
 "Party."  There is no such thing as a Communist Party, if by party
 we mean what our dictionaries call a party. It is a Communist con-
 spiracy, a Communist psychological warfare organization.  The Com-
 munists derive their strength in America from their unity with world
 communism, and from their ability both in clandestine and overt
 circles to pull the strings for the non-Communists, and even for the
 anti-Communists.  I am not afraid of Communists alone.  Com-
 munists have never been able to achieve anything without a front.
 The communism that wins is always the communism that makes the
 non-Communist its ally; by non-Communist I don't necessarily mean
 fellow travelers.  I mean non-Communists who allow themselves to
 be trapped by Communist strate,-N-.  We see that operating today in
 official and business circles, which are essentially anti-Communist.

 The business circles that do so, have the false hope that there will be
 tremendous trade available, that the entire automobile industry of
 America will find great new markets in Red China, and that two fami-
 lies of nations, Communist and non-Communist, can work together.
 That is merely a restoration under different terminology of what was so
 disastrous to us at the end of World War II, when we were told that
 Mao Tse-tung and the Communists of China were not really Com-
 munists, but only agrarian reformers, sort of Chinese New Dealers,
 who thought and reacted the same as we.
 Mr. ARENS. On the basis of your background and experience, please
 tell us what part of this total warfare is psychological?
 Mr. HUNTER. Since man began, he has tried to influence other men
 or women to his way of thinking.  There have always been these
 forms of pressure to change attitudes.  Atrocities were the simplest
 channel through which people were forced in the old days to change
 their minds.  Often they didn't change their minds, but acted as if
 they did, which had the same result, and, as time went on, the new
 thoughts often actually came to be believed.  There has been a re-
 markable difference developing in the last 30 years or so, which makes
 this as different from modern psychological warfare as the airplane is
 from a cannon.  I have heard it said that the airplane is the same as
 the cannon; it merely brings a shell a longer distance before dropping
 it somewhere.   That is sheer sophism.  The moment we discovered
 how to rise and remain above the earth, we had achieved something
 fundamentally new.  It was no longer a cannon.  It was an airplane.
 The same is true with modern psychological warfare.  We discovered
 in the past 30 years a technique to influence, by clinical, hospital
 procedures, the thinking processes of human beings.
 The basis for modern psychological warfare, which makes it different
 from whatever was done in the past, are the findings of the Russian
 physiologist, Pavlov.  He was not a Communist.  He had completed
 his most important discoveries before the Communists took power.
 His first discovery was the effectiveness of using a living animal in
 experiments, rather than a dead animal.  His second great discovery
 was that the instincts of an animal, that we call reflexes, were of two
 kinds. One was the reflexes which the animal was born with, its uncon-
 ditioned reflexes. The other was its conditioned reflexes, which man
 can train into the animal.  Most of us have heard of Pavlov's experi-
 ments with dogs and lights.                                                He first provided a bowl of food and
 turned on a light of a certain color, then an empty bowl and turned
 on a different colored light. After he had done this a number of times,
 he turned on the light that accompanied the food, but presented an
 empty bowl to the animal, and the dog deposited just as much saliva
 as when the bowl was full.  When he presented a bowlful of food with
 the wrong light, the animal did not eat.  After he switched the lights
 and the bowls of food, the animal became neurotic, barked, was driven
 into a state which among human beings we call insanity.
 When the Communist hierarchy in Moscow discovered that it was
 unable to persuade people willingly to follow communism, when they
 found that they could not create what they wanted, the "new Soviet
 man" in which human nature would be changed, they turned to
 Pavlov and his experiments.  They considered people the same
 as animals anyway, and refused to recognize. the role of reason or
 divinity in a human being.  They took over the Pavlovian experiments

 on animals and extended them to people.  They did so' with the
 objective of changing human nature and creating a "new Soviet
 man."  People, they anticipated, would react voluntarily under
 Pavlovian pressures, in the way the dog does, to Communist orders,
 exactly as ants do in their collectivized society.
 Mr. AREns. What were the results of their application of these
 techniques to people?
 Mr. HUNTER. We have been witnessing the results without knowing
 how they came about for 30 years and more.  We saw the first results
 in the Moscow trials, when the Old Bolsheviks, who had dedicated
 their lives to Communist ideology and had successfully captured
 the Russian Revolution away from the democratic elements, appeared
 in open court and beat their breasts and pleaded for execution as
 traitors to the Bolshevism they had set up. We heard confessions
 that came from the mouths of these people, but which made no
 sense to us because they fit into no logical framework that we could
 recognize as true.  We saw such developments go on, not only with
 a small group of people picked for trial, but in a curiously similar
 fashion with large parts of the population in Communist areas, in their
 schools and in their villages.  We saw the fine brain of Cardinal
 Mindrizenty cracked in open court, and heard him brand himself
 everything we all knew the cardinal was not.
 Against all this background that I had obtained as a foreign cor-
 respondent abroad, when I returned to Asia after World War II, I
 began to observe an unmistakable pattern in these strange, Communist
 psyychological victories.  These successes were being obtained not
 only with individuals, but, in a very peculiar fashion, with masses of
 people.  I came upon the pattern itself as a result of the use of this
 strategy in a careless manner by the Chinese Communist Government
 against the conquered people of China.  I later saw it used in similarly
 crude fashion a ainst American prisoners of war in Korea.
 Mr. ARENS. Would you then kindly give us the benefit of your,
 observations, first, in the use of this technique by the Chinese Com-
 munist Government against its people; and then, secondly, in the use
 against the American prisoners of war?
 Mr. HUNTER. I am very glad you asked me first to talk about what.
 I saw being done to the people of China, because that puts it in its
 proper context.  While I was in Hong Kong, soon after the fall of the
 mainland, I interviewed Chinese who had fled from the mainland, all
 of whom expressed themselves in a strange but very similar fashion.
 I was stunned to hear them telling me things I had heard before.  I
 had that weird feeling once, while interviewing a schoolteacher who
 had fled from the interior of China, after welcoming the Red Army
 into his city and facilitating its capture of the city.  He had found
 out in time how different the Reds are to how they picture themselves,
 and he had escaped.  As I was taking notes, I felt that I had written
 all this before, and yet how could I have done so?  I had only recently
 returned to Hong Kong.  Then it suddenly struck me.  Some years
 before, I had interviewed one of the heads of the faculty of Leningrad
 University, who had escaped from Russia.  This schoolteacher from
 the interior of China was telling me exactly what I had heard from the,
 Russian professor of a different culture, many tens of thousands of
 miles away.. I had that same eerie feeling often during that period,'
 of different stories being related in some strange manner.  In the

 jungles of Malaya, I came across the diaries taken from the bodies of
 slain Chinese guerrilla fighters.  I had a number translated.  To my
 amazement, I read exactly what I had heard from these people who
 had fled from China.  The same "discussion meetings" that were
 held in the schools and factories of Red China, I now read about in
 these diaries as being held beneath a knot of tall trees inside the jungle.
 In Indochina, I covered the trials of some of the terrorists who had
 engaged in such propaganda warfare pressures as rolling a hand
 grenade down the aisle of a children's cinema when a Walt Disney
 movie was being shown.  Those on trial spoke the same language,
 with the same expressions and the same explanations as I had heard
 from Red China, and had read in the diaries kept by the guerrillas in
 Malaya.  A set of Soviet Chinese textbooks were smuggled out of
 China for me.  They were being used in every school from Dairen in
 Manchuria to Canton in the south.  I came across the same teachings
 as I heard in the interviews, read in the diaries and listened to at the
 trials. One day I interviewed secretly a young man who had come
 out of Red China on a mission.  I had known his family.  During the
 interview, he used the phrase "hsi nao" or "wash brain." I immedi-
 ately stopped him, asking what he meant.  He laughed and said,
 "Oh, that's nothing; it's only something we say when close relatives
 or friends get together."  When somebody said something the Peiping
 Government wouldn't like, a relative or friend was liable to say to him,
 "Watch out, you'll get your brains washed." That was the first time I
 heard the word "brainwashing."  I was the first to use the word in
 writing in any language, and the first to use it in speech in any language
 except for that small group of Chinese.  That word and its connota-
 tion, against this background that I had been weaving ever since I
 started in journalism, especially during the years since the civil war in
 China became acute, was like a streak of lightning, clarifying the
 pattern of which I had already discerned its shadows.  Brainwashing
 was the new procedure, built up out of all earlier processes of persua-
 sion, using the Pavlovian approach to make people react in a way
 determined by a central authority, exactly as bees in a hive.
 Mr. ARENS. And now will you kindly recount your experiences and
 observations of brainwashing in Korea?
 Mr. HUNTER. The Korean war began after my discovery of brain-
 washing.  That is very significant.  Before I went ' to Korea, I had
 engaged in intensive research directly related to this word "brain-
 washing," because I wanted to know exactly the content of the word.
 I found it was a strategy for the conquest of the world by communism,
 that it was not merely another tactic, but was the framework for the
 entire activity of the Communist hierarchy.  I was so impressed
 with the importance of this discovery that I wrote a book on it called
 Brain-Washing in Red China, in which I made no effort to do any
 special interpreting, but merely outlined as plainly as I could the
 various elements that went into brainwashing.  For the first time,
 our side now had the pattern through which the international Com-
 munist movement had made its advance throughout the world.  I
 wrote about brainwashing in newspaper articles and for a magazine
 before I did the book.  Then I went to Korea, where' I found that
 the same pattern that I had seen everywhere else was being followed
 by the Communists.  I heard of American captured personnel broad-
 casting denunciations of their own country and confessing to a non-

 existent germ warfare in a manner and in a language that fit exactly
 into the brainwashing pattern that I had found in China and the rest
 of Asia.
 Mr. ARENS. Exactly what is this brainwashing?
 Mr. HUNTER. A more exact term in the military lexicon would be
 "mind attack."  We are accustomed to such terms as infantry attack,
 naval attack, air attack.  Mind attack simply recognizes a new
 dimension to the kinds of war used against armies on the field or
 against peaceful populations.
 Brainwashing consists of two processes, a softening up and an
 indoctrination process.  Each of these is formed out of a set of different
 elements.  I listed them in my second book, Brainwashing: The
 Story of Men Who Defied It-
 as hunger, fatigue, tenseness, threats, violence, and in more intense cases where the
 Reds have specialists available on their brainwashing panels, drugs, and hypnotism.
 No one of these elements alone can be regarded as brainwashing, any
 more than an apple can be called an apple pie.  Other ingredients
 have to be added, and a cooking process gone through.  So it is in
 brainwashing with indoctrination or atrocities, or any other single
 ingredient.
 The moment we think of brainwashing as only one of the elements
 of which it is composed, we no longer have brainwashing, any more
 than we have a pumpkin pie from pumpkin alone.
 Mr. ARENS. Now, specifically what happened to the American
 prisoners in Korea?
 Mr. HUNTER. Let me quote from a newspaper dispatch from the
 New York Times of January 6, 1957, sent out from Washington by
 the Associated Press 2 days before.  The subject was our new troop
 indoctrination program, based on the Code of Honor that President
 Eisenhower proclaimed on August 17, 1955.  The figures were taken
 from official accounts.
 Here is what the article says:
 Never before in history had so many captured Americns gone to the aid of the enemy.
 For 2 years the services studied the records of the prisoners.  What they found
 was not pretty.
 A total of 7,190 Americans were captured.  Of these, 6,656 were Army troops,
 263 were airmen, 231 Marines, 40 Navy men.
 In every war in American history some men have managed to escape.  Korea
 was the exception.
 Roughly 1 of every 3 American prisoners collaborated with the Communists in
 some way, either as informers or as propagandists.
 In the 20 prison camps, 2,730 of the 7,190 Americans died, the highest mortality
 rate among prisoners in United States history.  Many of them died unncessarily.
 They either did not know how to take care of themselves or they just lay down
 and quit.  Some sick or wounded died of malnutrition, abandoned by their
 comrades.
 Discipline among Americans was almost nonexistent.  It was a case of dog eat
 dog for food, cigarettes, blankets, clothes.
 For the first time in history Americans-21 of them-swallowed the enemy's
 propaganda line and declined to return to their own people.
 This is only part of the picture.  A glimpse.
 Mr. ARENS. What were the techniques used?
 Mr. HUNTER. The Communist inquisitors in the POW camps de-
 pended first of all on a screening process to provide them With the
 men most likely to succumb to brainwashing.  They picked the ones
 they figured would be most useful to them from among these. Cunning
 was all that was needed, along with a complete disregard for ethics; no.

 special intelligence.  This should be stressed.  They have based their
 technique primarily on the complete abandonment of morality.  That
 is their contribution to world thought.
 There can be no doubt that they had Communist underground
 guidance in this work in the United States, through the party and Red
 agents.  They were well prepared ahead for all phases of the Korean
 war, while we allowed ourselves to be caught unawares, as if by intent.
 They sized up each prisoner's character to find out whether he
 carried a grudge against his superiors, his neighbors, or society in
 general, or whether he made an intellectual fetish out of objectivity,
 indoctrinated by his own side in concentrating on the good points on
 every side, so he could "get along" with everybody and not be "anti-
 social."  The most effective trick in the Communist indoctrination
 process was to exploit this quack liberal and make-believe tolerant
 approach by equating what was the exception on the one side with
 what was typical on the other, and reaching the conclusion from that
 basis that both were alike.  If the prisoner was the quite usual type
 we had been developing, who had been brought up just to ask, "What's
 in it for me?" he was considered particularly a fine prospect.
 The Communist interrogators, as the brainwashers called them-
 selves, sought to remove a man's trust in his own side, and to convince
 him that he was being let down and even betrayed by his own country
 and relatives, especially by his wife or girl friend.  The Reds sought
 to deprive him of all hope.  Once they could accomplish this, they
 presented themselves to him as his new friends, as "Big Brother,"
 who would always stand by him through thick and thin, who would
 always love him.  The cruelties they had perpetrated on him they
 now interpreted as the discipline of a kindly father.
 They took sly advantage of our shocking failure even to make an
 attempt to communicate with our captured men, or to try to free any
 of them.  Even a failure would have been better for morale than utter
 silence which, under the circumstances, looked as if we didn't care.
 The Red indoctrinators built up this impression and fit it into their
 pattern of selfish, imperialist America led by bloated Wall Street
 financiers who were using our people as cannon fodder.
 They had a Roman holiday over our failure even to tell our men
 why they were being sent to Korea to fight.  When I was in Korea
 as a foreign correspondent, a high Army officer once came to me and
 pleaded with me to tell him what he was doing in Korea.  He knew
 that the Red propagandists were spreading their reasons for him to
 be there, even among his own men, .and he had no answers to their
 questions.  "Nobody tells me anything," he said.  This man had a
 heroic fighting record in the Normandy landings and was a career
 officer.  There was no question of his sincerity and patriotism.  Yet
 how could he have been expected to stand up against brainwashing?
 He was typical of those who were captured, who had not been told
 why they were fighting in Korea, or anything about the nature of
 communism.  The Red inquisitors filled the gap for these men, as
 possibly their most effective work.
 The Reds presented their version of why the Americans had come
 and in default of any other information it upset many of the men.
 Even when they kept quiet, they couldn't stop worrying over what the
 Reds said.  Half-truths and even entire lies sounded convincing to men
 who had no knowledge of the situation at all.  The inquisitors gave our

 Approved For Release 2002/07/29 : CIA-RDP80B01676Rg03800080064-5
 men nothing to think of except communism.  How were our boys to
 know that this was one of the Red techniques to break them down?
 The Reds selected Americans who had fine intelligence quotients,
 but with poor education.  Their heads were like a good, solid but
 empty bucket, only waiting to be filled.  The Reds did so with their
 own slanted material.  They deprived all these men of reading matter
 except what was pro-Red, and gave them plenty of that, and lots of
 time in which to read it.  They especially fed the boys the writings of
 pro-Communist Americans.    One of the most corrosive publications
 was a magazine called The China ' Zonthly Review, published by
 American pro-Communists at Shanghai.  The nien couldn't get over
 the shock of an American-edited magazine being put out in Red
 China.  They read it out of indignation or curiosity, and because
 they had nothing else to do.  The smoothly written poisons caught
 them by utter surprise, leaving a deep impression on their minds.  In
 a number of cases, it was the decisive factor in their softening up.
 The enemy didn't neglect the indoctrination process, but used it
 simultaneously.  The one thing the prisoners least expected was to
 come into a classroom atmosphere.  Yet this was what the Commu-
 nists endeavored to create. Americans respect learning and have been
 taught to gather it everywhere they can, and also to see all sides of
 every question.  Unfortunately, they have been taught this objec-
 tivity in a salesmanship context in which the principal axiom is, "The
 customer is always right."  They were first seduced into accepting
 something superficial about communism with which they agreed,
 which they would admit was good.  They had no way of checking up.
 The indoctrinators depended on their one-sided control of information
 and their doctrinal skill in subterfuge i nd doubletalk to soon have
 these men admitting that white was black, and war was peace, in the
 semantics of the Newspeak language described with such genius by
 George Orwell in his book, 1984.
 Perhaps the best illustration of the pressures put on our troops was
 given to me by an Air Force officer named Capt. Zach W. Dean. - He
 was taken on a "death march" and put in a Korean hut and left to
 hunger and freeze while the Reds harassed him with threats and pro-
 paganda and what they called "learning," until he became so weak
 and sick that he felt he was going to die.  At once the Communists
 changed their tactic, providing him with vitamin tablets and injections,
 good enough food, and kindiv words, until they saved his life.  A few
 weeks passed and the cat-and-mouse game switched back once more.
 He was again put under the brainwashing pressures.  He became sick
 again, catching pneumonia on top of another case of freezing.  De-
 prived of all attention, he was positive lie was going to die this time.
 Then once more they switched moods, and lie was given the best
 available of everything, and again his life was saved.  Zach knew
 what a deep study I had made of all this. I can never forget the look
 he gave me when lie told me about it, saying, ".Mr. Hunter, I don't
 believe you'll be able to understand what I'm going to tell you now.
 After the Reds do that to you a few times, you are grateful to them
 for saving your life.  You forget that they are the people who almost
 killed you."
 That is the Red technique used on all occasions under every sort
 of circumstance, from a POW camp to a United Nations session or a
 Geneva conference.

 No man has ever been brainwashed whose mind has not first been
 put into a fog.  That is the objective of all the Red pressures from
 group hunger to a "study group."  The patient first has to be deprived
 of his bearings, to be shaken loose from whatever belief and convictions
 he formerly held, until he loses faith in them entirely.  We contributed
 to the enemy's success by bringing up our young men and''women
 without real convictions except to "get ahead."  The obvious way to
 "get ahead" in POW camp was to play along with the Communists.
 Hungry, tired, sick, worried, and hopeless, the prisoner's mind could
 not be expected to work well.  He was caught off guard.  The Reds
 first lured the individual into believing the Red tenet in the pseudo-
 scientific Marxian philosophy which teaches constant change, even in
 such basic conceptions as truth and falsity, good and bad. The Reds
 were helped in putting this across by comparing it to our tolerance
 and liberalism.  Where convictions were already worn thin by their
 upbringing, the line became blurred until these noble traits were
 twisted out of shape by becoming tolerance for evil and the inability
 to distinguish between a college huddle back home and a brainwashing
 session in a POW camp.
 Note that I use the word "patient" in referring to the prisoner.  I do
 so deliberately, because brainwashing can only be properly understood
 from the clinical viewpoint; it is a treatment, as evil as a black mass.
 Brain-Washing in Red China had been published in sufficient time to
 warn our troops about this procedure.  It was recommended for the-
 book kits and approved by all concerned.  Somehow, influences from
 the woodwork prevented it from being distributed to the men.  After
 the release of the POW's, I felt sick at heart to hear them tell me how
 much suffering it could have saved them, and how many could have
 preserved themselves from falling into a treasonable situation, if they
 had only read that book.  "Why wasn't I told?" was their agonizing
 question to me.
 Mr. ARENS. What significance do you attach to the brainwashing
 episodes in Korea?
 Mr. HUNTER. We have been so overwhelmed by the shock of what
 took place in those brainwashing cells in Korea that we forget that
 this was not the first time it was used in a concentrated way.  Remem-
 ber, I had started writing a book about it even before the Korean war
 started.
 The Reds always operate with an immediate as well as a long-range
 objective.  They have a worldwide objective for brainwashing, ust as
 they had a local objective in the POW camps; the same as they have a
 global operation going on all the time in brainwashing, adjusted in
 Communist countries to their own people as in Red China, and in
 non-Communist countries to the non-Communist peoples, as in the
 United States.  In the POW camps, they put their emphasis on the
 softening up process, exactly as they are doing now in America,
 because that was what gave them what they wanted at once for the
 immediate needs of the war.  A great proportion of people in the
 POW camps, as in any Communist country, did not believe the Red
 line, and never did believe it. We should not regard this as proof that
 the Communists failed, which some of us are doing, but as indication
 of the Communist technique.  They never expected the mass of
 soldiers to be Communists. They didn't need them as true believers.
 It wasn't necessary.

 Hungary has shown an example of a population which appeared
 satisfied with the Red control, seeming to believe in its doctrines.  In
 Hungary, we saw overnight the people who acted and talked as if they,
 were Communists reveal themselves as unbelievers, furiously fighting
 to the death with their bare hands against communism.  Yet, such a
 population is pointed out as pro-Red. What is important to the Com-
 munist hierarchy from its power standpoint is that others act and
 talk as pro-Reds.  This is what happened inside the POW camps.
 Very few people in any Communist country are Red.      We should
 never forget this. The Reds believe basically in power, in what indi-
 viduals say and what they do.  So long as people do what they are
 told, and go through the verbalisms and motions attached to belief,
 that is satisfactory to a power faction such as the Kremlin constitutes.
 This is the immediate short-range objective.
 A certain element must become deeply indoctrinated, especially
 those who have thrown their interests irrevocably into the Red camp,
 and these constitute the activists, the hard core of the party. They
 are a small minority, and the constant purges even in their ranks shows
 how untrustworthy even these are.
 In any area under communism, so long as the Reds are able to
 maintain a controlled environment, and are indisputably in power, the
 population comes to talk and act pro-Communist. The people follow
 orders, even to the expression of the Communist point of view. That
 is how it is in any Communist country, and how it was in the POW
 environment.  After all, a nation under communism is a prison state,
 and its people do not live under any essentially different conditions.
 The Communist hierarchy well knows that its brainwashing is only
 skin deep in the overwhelming number of cases, and can be depended
 on only so long as the individual can be kept isolated from outside
 information or influence.  That is the significance of the Iron Curtain,
 as true for a Red satellite as for a POW enclosure.  Once the POW
 reached the fresh air of the free world, of course the poisons usually
 began to leave his system.   So it is with anyone from a Communist
 country, and is why the normal individual is not allowed out of his
 native land except when he leaves his loved ones behind as hostages,
 or his return is otherwise assured.  Indoctrination in the majority of
 cases does not bring about true belief, but only submission.
 We shouldn't allow ourselves to be misled or lured into inaction by
 this, for it makes little difference to the issue at the time whether the
 man who is lecturing on how he dropped germs on a peaceful popula'-.
 tion believes he did or doesn't.     When the desired effect on the
 audience is achieved, the result is the same.  That is what the
 Communists mean by power politics.  By the time the audience
 learns differently, the Reds will have achieved their end.
 If we deal with such Red-dominated populations as our enemy,
 refusing to recognize our secret allies, we will be defeating ourselves,
 making our collapse sure in this sleepy, coexistence era, with or without
 the need for a sputnik Pearl Harbor.
 Mr. ARExs. Is this technique used by the Communists applicable.
 to areas and circumstances other than as between a captor and
 prisoner?
 Mr. HUNTER.. Unfortunately for the Korean POW's, and unhappily
 for civilian foreigners and especially the inhabitants of Red countries,
 knowledge of brainwashing was kept quite secret until near the end of
 Approved For Release 2002/07/29 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R003800080064-5
 Approved For Release 2002/07/29 : CIA-RDP80B01676R003800080064-5
 the Korean war.  Only the determined efforts of the released POW's
 succeeded in breaking through that partly concocted, partly bureau-
 cratic curtain.  Brainwashing was being successfully hushed up the
 same way as information about the tremendous slave labor camps in
 the U. S. S. R.
 This delay in revealing brainwashing left the public with a twisted
 conception of it.  People still think it has something to do only with
 prisoners of war, and possibly foreigners put under arrest.  They still
 don't conceive of it as having to do with the populations of Com-
 munist countries.                                                  I've told that in my two books on brainwashing,
 but try to find them in your bookshops or even in most public libraries.
 They are high up on recommended lists for libraries and schools, as
 has been read into the Congressional Record.         Brainwashing only
 incidentally concerns military prisoners or foreigners.  This strategy
 of mind attack is aimed principally at the inhabitants of Communist
 countries, and has as its objective a forced change in their nature to
 make them over into "new Soviet men."
 This is the true character of mind attack, which the Reds have
 succeeded in hiding.  Those who pretend that American prisoners
 were not submitted to brainwashing either have to deny that the
 people under communism were put under these pressures, or else
 hush up the details.  My original brainwashing findings were based
 on what was happening to civilians on the Chinese mainland.  I wrote
 about the brainwashing of Chinese officials, teachers, and merchants-
 all ordinary folk.                                               What they underwent, the American and British
 troops did later on in Korea.  I will never forget the amazement
 that spread over the faces of released POW's when they first saw this
 book, and the relief it gave many who still felt sick over their expe-
 rience.                                          As the liberal book reviewer, Sterling North, wrote:
 Why * * * do the books revealing these truths get so little notice in the New
 York press and so modest a play in the bookstores?  Terror is terror, no matter
 who perpetrates it. Unless we are to be known as a nation of hypocrites, the time
 has come to drop our blinders.
 He wrote this in 1952, and the hush-hush continues in 1958.  Those
 blinders are still over our eyes.  Persistence in bringing out such
 facts, as this committee is doing, is the main obstacle to the success
 of the Communist psychological warfare techniques.  You are doing
 a work which if left undone would leave our country helpless and
 betrayed before a new nuclear age sneak attack.  The wonder is not
 that you are the butt of a subtle campaign to put you out of existence,
 but that it isn't even more intensified.  Take pride in it.
 We should not lose sight of the significant fact that the pressures
 used between captor and prisoner in the POW camps were identical
 to those utilized in Red China between Communist Party interro-
 gators and the people.  The Chinese population, the Russian popu-
 lace, the Hungarians, and the inhabitants of the other satellite
 countries are all under the same treatment, and are our secret allies.
 The major objective of the Red network is to make us betray them.
 The issue, for instance, is not representation in the U. N. and at
 Washington for 600 million Chinese by Peking, but their misrepre-
 sentation.  That is what is being urged, and the stakes are high;
 either their help in overthrowing our common foe, or their blind fury
 against us for letting them down when they needed us most.
 The similarity between the treatment given to military prisoners
 and to their own people by the Red hierarchy is perhaps the most

 convincing evidence we can find of the callousness and inhumanity
 with which a Communist regime regards its own people.
 The routine in the so-called "learning" classes for the faculty of
 any Chinese Communist school or government bureau, factory or
 business establishment, was identical to that in the POW camps,
 with the identical stages that progressed through the writing of biog-
 raphies and self-criticisms, along with diaries that had to be made
 available to the indoctrinators, to intermittent confessions and the
 ultimate indecent and humiliating disrobing of minds in an enforced
 mental orgy called "thought conclusions."
 These were all the same in essence, the only difference being in the
 greater or less stress put on the various elements that constitute
 brainwashing, according to the needs of the particular environment.
 In a Red community, such pressures as hunger and fatigue, threats
 and violence, are enforced as a way of life, through the manipulation
 of an artificially maintained low standard of living.  Exactly as they
 dare not do away with the conditioned environment, popularly known
 as the Iron Curtain, the Red governments dare not permit their
 people to eat and sleep well, and to have unimpeded leisure, any more
 than in the POW camps.  The people of a Red country are considered
 just as much as enemies by the Communist hierarchy as were the
 American and British POW's in Korea.
 Incalculable tens of millions of Chinese people have been arrested
 by the Mao Tse-tung regime on political charges since the fall of the
 mainland, and a horrible percentage of them killed.  They all had to
 attend "learning" classes the same as the POW's.     All the Chinese,
 people who have not been imprisoned also have had to undergo this
 clinical form of "learning," which is obligatory for every human
 being on the Chinese mainland.
 The word "learning" should be in quotation marks, because it is a
 bizarre example of Red semantics.  The word is written in Chinese
 with a different character than the ordinary word "learning,"
 although pronounced the same, and means only political learning from
 the Communist point of view.  Those who translate the word without
 revealing this are abetting the Communist propaganda intent.
 We're almost trapped into doing it whether we like it or not.  That is
 Red semantics, the most effective of the tools utilized in brainwashing.
 Mr. ARE\s. Do you have a specific illustration of the way in which
 the leadership in our Nation has been duped or brainwashed with
 reference to the international Communist conspiracy?
 )Jr. HUNTER. The most deadly misconception of all, that requires a
 softening up in our thinking before we can make it, is the idea that
 there are different kinds of communism, and that besides international
 communism there is something called national communism, which
 fundamentally differs.  There is nothing of the sort.  We are again
 interpreting, on the basis of wishful thinking, what the Communists
 themselves are plainly saying.  We base this national communism
 conception on Titoism.  Tito at no time disowned or expressed doubt
 in any of the fundamental tenets of communism, and he is today
 expending all the time he can in trying to tell the world that he believes
 in communism, intends Communist objectives to win out in the long
 run all over the world. Communism in this, too, has been able, as
 always, to get the help it needs from the non-Communist and princi-
 pally the anti-Communist world.

 Each time there has been a crisis in Soviet Russia, it could depend
 on the outside world for help.  Today, under the theory that there are
 different forms of communism, and some Communist forms are not
 really Communist, or are less Communist than others, we are giving
 through aid programs and such propaganda assists as so-called ex-
 change scholarships, the help and sustenance that these Communist
 countries require to survive.   I have heard that under certain tech-
 nical requirements of the law, completely fantastic statements have
 come from the White House and the State Department that com-
 munism in Yugoslavia really isn't communism any more, and that
 communism in Poland is not real communism.  I thought we had
 learned our lesson in China.    We said that the communism of China,
 the communism of Mao Tse-tung, was not really communism.  We
 said it was not the communism of Moscow.  Mao Tse-tung was say-
 ing it was the same communism, exactly as Tito says that the Com-
 munist ideology is basically the same everywhere, and that the ob-
 jective for a Communist world is identical.                                                 Yet we insist on saying
 that Tito and Mao Tse-tung, just as Hitler, did not mean what they
 were doing their best to say they did mean.
 Mr. ARENs. What can we do about it?
 Mr. HUNTER. First of all, we have to begin by realizing that we are
 very, very late.  The Communists have been operating for a full gen-
 eration, taking strategic advantage of the American principles, ex-_
 ploiting the best sides in our characters as vulnerabilities, and succeed-
 ing for a generation in changing the characteristics of Americans.
 I remember when I was a young man, every personnel department.
 was looking for leadership qualities.  What was sought was a man's
 capacity as an individual to achieve new things.  Today that is : not
 even considered by personnel departments in their employment poli-'
 cies.  They ask, instead, if the man "gets along" with everybody..
 They do not ask what is his individuality; they ask how he conforms.
 When we raise a young man to believe that at all costs he must get
 on with everyone, we have put him into a state of mind that almost
 guarantees, if he falls into the hands of an enemy such as the Com-
 munists, that he will react as he had been raised, to try "to get on,"
 because he must not be "antisocial."  Being "antisocial" has become
 the cardinal sin in our society.  We have to again go back to charac-
 teristics of ours which made us, as individuals, say that what is right
 is right, and whether or not it is antisocial makes no difference.  The
 young man who broadcast for the Red Chinese was simply "getting.
 along" as he had been taught to do by our educators.
 What we can do in defense against brainwashing is very difficult
 now, because we have lost a generation.  We should begin by scotch-
 ing a type of mentality that is both defeatist and unrealistic and which
 repeats the so-called sophisticated observation, "Every man has' a
 breaking point," with the inference that brainwashing is hence -un-
 beatable and we might as well not do anything about it.  That seems
 to be the preferred conclusion in certain circles.  Anyone who comes
 forth with that finding is welcomed by them, and has no difficulty
 having his writings displayed in the bookshops and learnedly reviewed.
 A psychiatrist would be needed to analyze that masochistic trait in
 some of us.
 Pavlov's experiments do have significance for the human being, so
 we are destined to become ants through the medium of a collectivist

 society, is the blase deduction in these sadistically inclined, fake
 intellectual circles.
 But this is loose thinking.  Of course every man has a breaking
 point, has always had, and will always have.  Even granite can be
 crushed into powder. What does that signify?  The huskiest wrestler
 in the world can stand only a certain amount of weight on his arm
 before it cracks.  The healthiest man in the world can be killed in a
 moment by a bullet that penetrates a vital organ.  So what?  They
 simply avoid such situations wherever normally possible.  They nar-
 row down the times when they can be trapped that way, or they make
 it too costly for the assailant.
 The basic point is that this breaking point varies constantly with
 the same individual.  Exercise, training, determination, and a host of
 other elements all enter into it.  There isn't a single human being so
 weak or so strong, so stupid or so clever, that he cannot be improved.
 His mental resistance can be strengthened just as much as his physical.
 The type of mentality I have been outlining is the result of the
 softening up that has been taking place in our society during the past.
 few decades under Communist encouragement.  Our first task is to
 correct that sloppy way of thinking, especially when coated with a
 veneer of the professorial.
 The world situation has created the need for a conscious extension
 of the sort of training we give Boy Scouts, for example.  They are
 taught what to do when lost in the woods.  Our pilots are taught the
 same survival methods, so they know what berries can poison them or
 keep them alive.  We simply have to extend that nowadays to
 teaching a man what to do when lost in an ideological jungle, giving
 him what I call "mental survival stamina." No longer is it sufficient
 for him to just enjoy the privileges of a free society.  He must learn
 what constitutes freedom, and the pitfalls that destroy it.  We have
 always had camp crafts in the military.  This merely extends them
 farther.  That was the simple basis on which the services presumably
 are adopting a program to resist brainwashing.
 The experiences of those who have undergone brainwashing tell us
 what traits are effective in providing mental survival stamina.  In my
 second book, Brainwashing: The Story of Men Who Defied It, I list
 them the same way as I do the pressures that break a mind.  They
 are given as follows:
 Faith, convictions, clarity of mind, a closed mind, purpose, keeping one's mind
 busy, confidence, deceit, high jinks, adaptability, crusading spirit, group feelings,
 being yourself.
 Some of these are readily understandable, others can be misin-
 terpreted and require explanation, as the closed mind, deceit, and,
 possibly high jinks.  A closed mind does not mean narrowmindedness
 or fanaticism.     What it does mean is that you have already reached
 a conclusion on a specific matter in question and under the circum-
 stances there is no earthly use in discussing it.  One doesn't discuss,
 for instance, whether it isn't all right to slap one's mother in the face, or
 to slap one's country in the face with a propaganda talk while under the
 enemy.  One doesn't have to prove himself objective or fairminded by
 discussing those matters.  There are innumerable others. The differ-
 ence between a closed mind and fanaticism is that one shuts the door
 in the former case, locks it, and puts the key in one's pocket.  You can
 open the door if you wish, but there's no logical reason to do so. The

 fanatic cements the door in place so it never can be opened again.
 A balanced mind reaches conclusions on basic subjects, then passes on
 to others.  He doesn't return to the earlier ones unless some drastic
 reason impels him to.  A POW camp is certainly not the locale, with
 all the dice loaded and in the hands of the brainwashers.
 Anyone who wouldn't use deceit on a crazy man advancing toward
 him with a dagger would be extremely stupid.  A madman is humored,
 and that is another way of saying deceived. The Communist ideology)'
 like the Fascist, has a streak of insanity in it. Stalin had it the same
 as Hitler.  Prisoners of war still are soldiers, and it surely is no more
 wrong to deceive an enemy than to kill him.  Deceit is a recognized
 part of military tactics.  As told me by the Reverend Olin Stockwell,
 an American missionary who was intensively brainwashed by the Reds,
 "I lied like a trooper."   He had sense.  The Reds were at war with
 his church as well as his country, and he would have been silly to
 make believe not.
 The Reds extracted confessions from practically anyone, no matter
 on how trivial a matter, even when they knew it was a fake from
 beginning to end.  This mystified the prisoners, but there was a
 psychological reason.  Confession is a form of submission, and was
 so recognized in early language.  Confession accustoms the individual
 to surrender his integrity as well as his body.
 Quite a bit of controversy has arisen over the way to counteract the
 confession tactic. While some insist on not replying to the Commu-
 nists, giving no answers to their questions, others urge total confessions
 of everything imaginable, except the truth,'by everybody.  There are
 serious drawbacks to both of these as an exclusive approach, but there
 is no reason why we have to choose any single defense tactic. Let us
 use them all, according to the situation and how we're organized at the
 time.  That's adaptability.  We already know the utter falsity of
 Communist-obtained confessions, and that much, at least, should be
 proclaimed to all the world. We seem to feel that we mustn'?t hurt
 the feelings of the Reds by stressing any such ugly trick of theirs.
 We also can acquaint the world at once with this Pavlovian approach
 that equates a man with beasts of the field.  Strangely, we are hush-
 ing up that aspect of it.  I tell in Brainwashing: The Story of Men
 Who Defied It, about a film I saw, made in the U. S. S. R. for train-
 ing purposes, that shows experiments on a human being as if he
 were a dog.  I can imagine no more effective anti-Communist movie,
 and we didn't make it; Moscow did.  The film is available, yet we
 are careful not to offend the Reds by showing it.  I cannot conceive
 of anyone in Hindu India or Moslem Egypt seeing that film and
 retaining anything except disgust for the Reds.
 The most important elements of mental survival stamina are faith and
 convictions. I never expected this to be questioned After all, my in-
 formation came out of the experiences of the brainwashed themselves.
 Yet there has been a most peculiar resentment of that finding.  I be-
 lieve this is the most significant of my discoveries for Americans, for it
 reveals a national vulnerability that has crept into our character, which
 it is the responsibility of every one of our citizens to help remove.
 I had gathered the material for my first book by the old-fashioned
 way of going to news sources for it.  I kept extensive notebooks.  I
 decided to retain that method in all my writing.  I built up Brain-
 Washing in Red China out of the material in my notebooks, giving each

 interview and each experience the way it happened, so the reader would
 obtain each picture as I saw it originally.  Only after I had finished it
 and read it in published form did I realize the full extent of what I had
 brought out.  My faith in the bare truth, in the manner in which I had
 been taught to believe in it as a cub reporter in a generation now past,
 Was completely justified.  The brainwashing secret that the Kremlin
 had been able to keep bottled up in the Lubya.nka and the other dun-
 geons of its secret police had slipped out through its back door in China.
 I made many lasting friendships through my first book.  One was
 with Dr. Leon Freedom, a Baltimore brain specialist and psychiatrist,
 and also his keen-minded wife, Virginia. Before I ever heard of him, he
 was giving talks based on my book. After we met, I began going to him
 after some especially important interview, and we would discuss it for
 hours after his busy day at the clinic.  He would analyze it from the
 medical point of view. He clarified the connection between brainwash-
 ing and Pavlov's conditioning of dogs.               He opened that vista for me.
 One day, I was jotting down notes during an interview with a brain-
 washed man from Eastern Europe, when I recognized once more that
 these words were alike to others I had been recording, told me by per-
 sons who had undergone this mental torture in China.  The subject
 of the particular paragraph was how he had managed to survive to the
 extent he had under those horrible pressures.  The significance of this
 dawned on me.  That night I went over my notebooks and found the
 second pattern, this time for the preservation of a man's mind, not
 merely for its destruction.  Our survival depends on us understanding
 that.
 Each time a man told me how lie had come out of the hands of his
 Red inquisitors, to the extent that he had retained his integrity, be
 had explained bow he had defeated it.  I found these details always
 the same, no matter whether the individual came from Siberia or
 Chula, the Soviet Union or Czechoslovakia, or whether he was
 American or German, Chinese or Japanese, irrespective of his profes-
 sion, whether military or missionary or merchant.  I realized then
 that I had in my notebooks the pattern for the defeat of brainwashing,
 for the preservation of men's minds against the most vicious and sly
 attacks ever made on the human brain, in which all our great contri-
 butions of science and civilization were being focused on the upside-
 down
 task of making healthy minds sick.  When I came upon this
 pattern for what I called mental survival stamina, I now knew I had
 the material for a second book, and the responsibility to write it.
 That was bow Brainwashing: The Story of Men Who Defied it
 came into existence.
 To complete the record, I have written a third book, The Story of
 Mary Liu.  I am told it reads like a novel, although every name and
 detail are true.  There is a illary Liu. The story deals with this
 same human problem of the preservation of man's integrity under
 tremendous odds.    The Story of Mary Liu gives the experience of a
 single individual, and deals primarily with the religious field.  Because
 of her very special condition, she was able to witness from behind the
 scenes what foreigners were not allowed to see in Red China, even
 those who were pro-Communist.
