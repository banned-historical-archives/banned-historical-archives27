 New Task for Mr. Kissinger

 'Ziaff Reporter of Tire \VALT, STREET Joun%-AL
 WASHINGTON-When talk here. turns to the
 "energy crisis," it usually dwells on domestic
 aspects-the price of natural gas in Texas, or
 perhaps a law someday requiring Detroit to
 make smaller auto engines.
 But senior government officials realize In-
 creasingly that there's much more to be reck.
 oned with. They're beginning serious study of
 the energy problem's International implica.
 tions In hopes of fending off grave 'diplomatic,
 military and economic troubles.
 At worst,,eXpcrts fear that political disputes

 eventually sever America's fuel-supply lines.
 Interior Secretary Rogers Morton warns that
 an Interruption of the imported-oil flow for any
 reason "could cause great damage to our na-.
 tional economy and internal and external secu-
 illy."
 More Questions Than Answers
 To date, the policy review involves drafting
 questions more than compiling answers; Henry'
 Kissinger's staff has just started organizing tile,
 paperwork and soon will float it around the
 State Department, Pentagon, Central Intelli-
 gence Agency and other concerned agencies.
 But some of the topics are fairly obvious, and
 deeply worrisonne. They include':
 -Mideast policy. Some ruualysty see a grow.
 Ing contradiction between massi.%a U.S. aid to
 Israel and this country's increased need for
 Arab oil. So far the Arab governments have.
 been tmwilltng or unable to use their fuel ex-
 ports for political blackmail, but there's doubt
 about how long this restraint can last. Rather
 than risk having. supplies cut by another Arab-
 Yarnell  war,  the  study  may  recommend
 stronger U.S. efforts to settle Mideast conflicts
 soon. Pushing terms that the Israelis may not
 like much strikes some officials as wiser than
 letting events drift.
 -Monetary dangers. This year fuel Imports
 will account for $2.5 billion of the U.S. pay-
 ments deficit; experts any the not cost fit 1080
 will he nt bast $10 billion. Tits drain inane
 thrcftetlq the dollar's utabillty,?nntl there in on.
 niter ti't ubleaeme? lwrnslnvrt l+cskles. Midrlrr t
 oil-producin; nations' will accumulate vast
 sums that they can't spend internally. Thrso
 huge cash reserves if transferred erratically,
 could disrupt the international monetary sys-
 tent far more seriously than the 1971 crisis,
 which forcbd the dollar's devaluation.
 -Defense shifts. The need to pay dearly for
 foreign oil could well reduce American ability
 to keep military forces overseas, especially in
 Europe. Though troop cuts are considered de-
 sirable by many officials anyway, U.S. strate.
 gists worry that money shortages may force
 much deeper slashes than they or American al-.
 lies want. In addition, the Navy now claims it
 needs' extra billions for destroyers to protect
 growing tanker fleets. Skeptics say this is
 merely a ploy to justify big Naval budgets and
 fancy sea and shore berths for admirals, but
 the matter is getting serious study.
 -Relations  with  allies.  America's  best
 friends, the Western European nations and
 Japan, need Mideast oil even more than does
 the U.S.; they have no significant deposits of,
 their, own. An era of bitter competition, fraying
 alliances, could ensue as fuel-short industrial
 powers all bid for the same petroleum.
 -Relations with Russia. There's big talk.
 these days about buying fuel from the U.S.S.R.'
 But some officials warn that dependence on So-
 viet sources could give Moscow an upper hand.
 in relations with the West. (Others 'say the
 .sales will create mutual interest in continued
 political stability. So far there is no clear U.S.
 official view.) In addition, the Kremlin is
 trying to extend its Mideast influence, partly
 by purchase of Arab oil for Russia's own use or
 for reexport into hard-currency markets. U.S.
 officials doubt this trend serves either Western
 or Arab interests.
 "Wo Should Worry"
 Because energy problems havcri't seemed
 imminent, the subject has been shoved aside
 regularly by Washington's national security bu-
 reaucracy. Lately, though, growing awareness
 of fuel shortages has fostered new interest in
 'the international complications ahead. Thus
 they stand high on 1Mr. Kissinger's list of things
 to cope with "after Vietnam."
 "Suddenly we've realized we should worry,
 about energy problems," says a Kissinger staf-
 ter who is helping organize the study. "We've
 been pondering which matters to stress over
 the next four years, and this is certainly one."
 In fact, energy will soon be the subject of a
 National Security Council study memorandum.
 This is Mr. Kissinger's device for farming
 problems out' to the bureaucracy for advice
 and information. The responses help form pol-
 icy alternatives that go to Preiident Nixon for
 decision.
 The impetus for action arises from the
 changing rclatiorp hip between petroleum buy.
 era and sellers. Though some analysts claim
 the so-called "energy crisis" is a fraud and in.
 sist that huge oil reserves still exist, their or.
 guments are somewhat irrelevant. Whether
 there's it shortage or it surplus, industrialized
 countries find themselves facing effective do.

 peeled to gain increased control over produc?
 lion and sales policies..
 The U.S., willy-nilly, will contribute. heavily
 to Arab wealth and power. According to James
 Akins, the State Department's senior energy
 c authority, the U.S. has no short-terns alterna-
 i tive to buying more foreign oil; he and others
 agree that new domestic resources-including
 gas manufactured from coal or oil extracted
 from shale-won't conic along fast enough to
 ease the squeeze any time soon. By 1980, Mr.
 Akin: expects, U.S. oil imports may reach 15
 million barrels daily, up from six million this
 year and only 3.2. million in 1970.
 What to Do?
 Concern over the Implications of the trend is
 mounting among private experts as well as
 government strategists. Walter Levy, a noted
 energy consultant, warns that "the U.S., as a
 major world power, simply cannot afford an
 ever-increasing over-dependence for its oil sup.
 plies ' on a handful of foreign 'countries... .
 Otherwise, its security in a narrow sense, as
 well as its prosperity and, its freedom of action
 in foreign-policy formulation, will be in jeop-
 ardy."
 What to do? The presidential energy mes-
 sage that Mr. Akins is drafting and that Mr.
 Nixon Is expected to send Congress next
 month.will stress the need for developing adds-
 tiorial fuel sources. But that process threatens
 to take two'decades or more. In the meantime,
 officials say, other government policies must
 be reexamined and perhaps modified in order
 to avoid the worst dangers:
 High on the list comes Mideast policy.
 Washington doesn't want to face a future
 choice between preserving Israel or pacifying
 Arab oil producers, however unlikely that pros.
 pect now seems. To date, militant Arabs have
 been unable to get oil-exporting governments
 to use their fuel for political pressure. Despite
 -much lofty talk about Arab brotherhood, even

 Staff correspondent of
 The Christian Science Monitor
 Washington
 The U.S. Defense Department is increas.
 ingly concerned about growing American
 dependence on oil imported from the eastern
 hemisphere:                  '
 Two aspects worry the Pentagon - and the
 Navy in particular:
 ? That the U.S. won't be able to transport
 and protect the flow of oil it vitally needs.
 That means defense experts fear a shortage
 of tankers and of escorts to guard them.
 ? That the U.B. will find paying for the
 imported oil an intolerable burden on its
 balance of payments. They see the Iranians
 and the Arabs engaged in leap-frogging
 demands on the Western oil companies, the
 end effect of which is higher cost to the
 consumer.
 neighbors like Syria and Iraq have had a hard
 time agreeing on such things as proper tolls
 fora pipeline that carries oil from Iraq across
 Syria to the Mediterranean.
 But some Arabs' see greater unity as their
 wealth  increases.  Even  conservative  Saudi
 Arabia, which may be pocketing $20 billion an-
 nually by'1980, anticipates both affluence and-
 influence. King Faisal, a devout Moslem, ada-
 mantly opposes Jewish occupation of Islamic
 holy places in Jerusalem and may yet use his
 oil to help got the Israelis out. Warns one White
 House staffer: "The question is: can we still
 import in the 1980s if there is no resolution of
 the Arab-Israeli dispute by then?"
 It's a risk Washington may not choose to'
 run. The present study could advocate new ef-
 forts to settle the area's problems peacefully
 before import needs skyrocket and the U
 S
 a

 p
 pears more Vulnerable.
 Military Issues
 The White House study will also ponder mil.
 itary issues. If oil costs rise too far, Washing.
 ton. may have to call home its troops from Eu.
 rope and 'Asia for purely fiscal reasons, upset-
 ting its foreign friends and eroding alliances.
 Questions  about  reordering  other  military
 priorities are also arising.
 'Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, the Navy boss, al-
 ready sees a budget opening through which he
 hopes to pilot a fleet of shiny new destroyers.
 Claiming the U.S. will need 1,000 large civilian
 tankers by 1980, he concludes "their safe pas.
 sage will depend in large measure on our abil-
 ity. to deter interruption of this flow." Transla.
 tion: more ships and men for his Navy. He also
 argues that new gunboats could. conduct Mid-
 cast diplomacy for his State  Department
 friends.
 "To the citizen of a less technologically ori-
 ented society," he says, "nothing is quite like ashipshape destroyer making a call."
 The U.S. military forces depend on im-
 ported oil for 60 percent of their supplies and
 100 percent of the petroleum products con-
 sumed in Vietnam came from the Persian
 Gulf.
 Dependence now is taken for granted in the
 Defense Department and by the Navy. In a
 little-noticed speech to the Chamber of
 Commerce of Beckley-Raleigh in West Vir-
 ginia last December Adm. Elmo, R. Zumwalt
 laid the facts dramatically on the line:
 "We have roughly enough reserves bf
 natural gas to last 22 years and enough-
 petroleum for 20," he said. "In other words,,
 the wells of natural gas and petroleum are
 going to run dry within our boundaries within
 the life span of some here present and
 certainly within the life span of some of our
 children.
 The admiral explained that only about 50
 percent of demand for petroleum in the U.S.
 would be met by domestic production by the
 year 1985, even if Alaskan oil were brought
 into the picture.
 "That means," he concluded, "that we are
 going to have to import something In the
 order of 12 million barrels of crude oil a day
 - each and every day."
 Admiral Zumwalt went on to state the
 Navy's concern for protecting the oil's move-
 ment, as follows:

 "The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia," a
 controversial new book charging U.S. complicity
 -through the 'CIA-in the drug trade, has been
 acquired as the basis for a new film by Richard
 Brooks for Columbia Pictures.
 The. book, written by a young Yale scholar
 named Alfred W. McCoy and two associates, Cath-
 leen B. Read and Leonard P. Adams II, first came
 to public attention last year when it became
 .known that the CIA tried to dissuade Harper &
 Row from publishing it and 1,han demanded the
 opportunity to read and review the text in galley
 form.
 Despite a long rejoinder from the CIA, Harper &
 Row published the book in September essentially
 ,as written: McCoy's central thesis is that the U.S.
 government, inheriting the vacuum left by the de-
 parting French in Southeast Asia, also reluctantly
 customers to buy Iranian oil. But if they
 wished to save their special position as
 favored customers, they would have to turn i
 over their assets in Iran at an earlier date
 and agree to help Iran immediately to step up
 production from its present level of 4.5
 million barrels a day to a level of 8 million
 barrels a day. The 8-million-barrel goal
 previously had been set for 1980.
 The Shah made no mystery of the fact that
 he had been incited to make these new
 demands by Arab oil companies' completing
 new agreements last December with Western
 oil companies. These agreements give the
 Arabs a 25 percent participation in the
 companies effective this year and , a 51
 percent participation by 1983. .
 Minister called author
 The deal the Shah was talking about was
 worked out by the Saudi-Arabian Minister of
 Oil Ahmed Zaki Yamani representing Ku-
 wait, Qatar, and Abu Dabi as well as Saudi
 Arabia.
 Quietly watching the Iranian-Arab com-
 petition are the Iraqis who have nation-
 alized the Iraq Petroleum Company and are
 having a hard time selling their oil. They will
 have to decide now whether to press on with' their nationalization' and attempts to sell
 their oil to the Soviet Union and the Commu-
 nist bloc or whether to follow the pattern set
 by the Shah or that set by the other Arabs.
 Meanwhile, Lybya is needling all con-
 cerned by demanding a immediate 50 percent.
 share in the companies who have concessions
 on its territory.
 Only one thing is certain about the future of
 the oil supplied by the Arabs and Iranians =
 it will cost more. A barrel of Kuwaiti oil
 which in 1968 cost $1.68 will cost $8 by Jan. 1,.
 1975.
 inherited the politics of poppy-growing' in the
 Golden Triangle of Laos, Thailand and Burma,
 where 70% of the world supply of illicit heroin is
 produced. The revenues enrich local economies
 and greatly enrich very high officials of Asian
 governments supported by the United States in its
 attempts to combat the spread of communism.
 Battle in Opium War
 McCoy's book is a meticulously documented look
 at the heroin trade worldwide, written in news-
 magazine rather than pedantic style and contain-'
 ing a few scenes which could make even "The
 French Connection" seem like a pale footnote.
 Most particularly, McCoy describes a battle in
 the Opium War of 1967 over a caravan of mules
 carrying 16 tons of opium to market. The ship-
 ment was destined for the commander-in-chief'of'
 ,the Laotian army, but two former Kuomintang
 generals who had been controlling the local trade
 routes attacked with several hundred men. Even-
 tually the battle involved seven jet aircraft and a
 company of Laotian paratroopers, who captured
 the booty.
 Brooks, fascinated by these goings-on and by
 the whole curious confrontation of American
 idealism and pragmatism with a ntttghly sordid
 political ronlity, will, enll his movie "ttliwei'm of
 Evil" and plans to shoot entirely on location. Sec
 and unit work on the planting of the poppies will
 begin in a few weeks' time.
 The Truth? 'Tell It'
 "I read an excerpt from the book in Harper's and
 clipped it out," Brooks says. "I read the book and
 was even more interested, but I' couldn't believe.

 "Since all of this oil will be coming over the
 surface of the world oceans, I think you can
 see the Navy's concern. To move this oil is
 going to ,require more than 1,000 tankers
 averaging about 17,000 tons each. Their
 passage will depend on our' ability to deter
 interruption of the flow."
 For this purpose the Navy is seeking a new
 generation of simplified low-cost frigates
 which .would escort the tankers as well as so-
 called "surface effect" ships such'as hydro-
 foils for which prototype money has been
 included in the new budget. ' Admiral Zum-
 walt. also has said that American aircraft
 carriers would be re-equipped to fly anti-
 submarine missions in order to protect the
 movement of oil and that the new nuclear
 submarines would be used for this purpose.
 The concern for rising costs of imported oil
 is summarized by the estimate of Defense

 petroleum products will rise from about $2
 billion in 1972 to about $20 billion in 1985. The

 heads in order to develop a first-strike
 MIRV system able to destroy a large
 fraction of our Minuteman force.
 Another familiar justification for nu- ,
 clear weapons testing has been the
 need to assure the continued reliabil-
 ity of, already developed and stock-
 piled weapons. Although nuclear tests
 have never'been carried out solely to
 check the proper functioning  of a
 stockpiled weapon, it has been argued
 that the ability to test is necessary in
 case deterioration' is found by other
 means and corrective action Is  re-
 quired. This Is not necessary, however,
 since  it would always be possible
 to replace a warhead which had deters-
 orated with one of proven design. Fur-
 thermore, If mutual deterrence is the
 fundamental element In our strategic
 policy, as spelled out by the ADM,
 treaty, then any unknown decrease In
 reliability on both sides can only im-
 prove deterrence. High reliability is
 only necessary for a nation contemplat-
 ing a first strike. No aggressor could
 rely on the uncertain reliability of an-
 other nation's weapons as the means of
 surviving a retaliatory attack.
 Thus, as a result of the Moscow
 agreements, a  strong  case can be
 made that no further nuclear testing
 of strategic weapons Is required. Yet,
 during the past 10 years since the lim-
 ited test ban treaty, more than two-
 thirds of the U.S. tests have been relat- '
 ed to strategic weapons ( systems, and
 indeed the highest-priority tests have
 fallen in this category, The Moscow
 agreements have thus undercut the
 major rationale for continued nuclear
 testing. Even before SALT I, Drs. Carl
 Waiske and John Foster of the De-
 fense Department testified. that they
 favored a comprehensive test ban pro-
 , vided it could be adequately verified.
 This Pentagon position, which Is the
 U.S. position at the Geneva disarma-
 ment talks,. is even further reinforced'
 by the Moscow agreements.

 use deliberate concealment to Impede
 verifications. In addition, a standing
 consultative commission is set up to
 consider questions concerning compli-
 ance with the obligations of the agree-
 ment. Similar provisions, but multi-na-
 tional in scope, attached to a compre-
 hensive. test ban treaty, might satisfac-.
 torlly reconcile the U.S. and the Soviet
 points of view.
 . The primary problem In verifying a
 ban on underground tests has been the
 difficulty in telling apart the seismic
 signals from small earthquakes and ex-
 plosions.. Now, with greatly improved
 seismic methods and sophisticated com-
 puter, processing, it is possible to clas-
 sify 'almost . any  detectable  seismic
 event as an earthquake or an explo-
 sion.
 For those few small events which
 are detected seismically but not ' identi-
 fled, the. United States has In the past
 sought the reassurance of on-site In-
 spections "despite Pentagon testimony
 that the value of such on-site inspec-
 tions Is marginal at best. Today's U.S.
 verification techniques, however, are
 superior to our earlier capabilities,
 even combined with "the on-site inspec-
 tions we were seeking.
 Observation   satellites   are   one
 . agreed method capable of providing In-
 creased assurance. A photographic sat-
 ellite scanning an. area in which an un-
 .Identified seismic event was detected
 could obtain information useful for
 evaluating whether the seismic" signals
 originated from a secret nuclear test.
 Most of the natural earthquake areas
 within the Soviet Union are remote
 from human activity, so that a large
 fraction of these unidentified events

 in origin when evidence of man-made
 disturbances was absent. Whenever a
 satellite obtained evidence of mining
 or drilling operations in the area
 where the seismic signals originated,
 a satisfactory explanation could be
 demanded through an international
 commission on the SALT I model. If
 not satisfied, the United' States could
 resume testing or take whatever other
 action it thought necessary.
 Evasion Techniques .
 SOME EXPERTS have worried that
 an underground test ban could be
 violated by use of sophisticated eva-
 sion techniques, such as a detonation
 In a large cavity. But theoretical stud-.
 lea show that a very large chamber,
 300 feet in diameter and several thou.
 sand feet underground, would be re-
 quired to muffle the seismic signal 'of
 a 5-to-10-kiloton explosion sufficiently
 to make It undetectable. The use of
 such concealment techniques for even
 so small a test would Involve a mam-
 moth construction operation which
 would be easily visible by observation
 satellites.
 Other  exotic  evasion  techniques
 have been proposed: a nuclear explo.
 sion could be conducted in the Immedi-
 ate aftermath of a large earthquake, or
 a series of nuclear explosions could be
 timed to give additive seismic signals
 that more nearly resemble an earth-
 ql%,dce than an explosion. Both of t`hesw
 techniques are vuinv rable to dereraton
 by sophisticated  seismic  measuring

 even if these techniques successfully

 siderable probability that the opera.

 problems. This program, nicknamed
 Plowshare, has always been a road-
 block to a ban on nuclear tests, since it
 could provide an Ideal cover for dis.

 Now the proposed nuclear excavation
 of the sea-level Panama Canal has been'

 the only project being given serious

 been stimulated by U.S. propaganda in

 TEHERAN. From the air, the landscape looks as
 forbidding as the face of the moon. On the ground
 it is worse: a burning summer sun against which
 the tree'ess mountain slopes offer no shelt&r,? or
 winter storms that obliterate the winding trails
 with masses of snow and ice. Spring brings the
 "120-day wind," swirling, hot gusts that fill the
 pores and blind the eyes.with the fine brown sand
 that covers the barren mountainsides.* But the cara-
 vans from Afghanistan inch their way along the
 ridges and through the gorges every day except at
 the depth of winter. They carry tea, and-guns, and
 silks, and cigarettes, and opium. Above all, opium.
 Even if the pack animals-mainly sturdy' little
 horses of a' Mongolian strain-don't carry opium
 in their saddle bags, the brownish black gum which.
 makes men dream happy dreams also makes the
 caravans move. Opium wrapped ? around the bit
 makes the horses go at a prancy gait for days on
 end, without rest and with little food or drink, and
 to eventual death from exhaustion, to speed the
 smugglers' journey.
 The smugglers want the trip to go fast particu-
 larly when the cargo is opium. The faster they
 reach their. destination in Iran, the smaller is the
 risk of detection by the Imperial Iranian Gendar-
 merie. If the gendarmes spot the smugglers, a gun-
 fight will follow. The lucky ones will get away;
 1 the others will die. To be wounded increases the
 risk of capture, and those who are captured are
 tried and, most often, shot by firing squads.
 To escape the gendarmes is not to escape danger.
 { Those who get away had better not lose their
 carg-). To return to Afghanistan without the opium,
 or the money or gold for it, is to face the ven-
 geance of the tribal leader who organised the cara-
 van and is responsible to the khan who owns the
 shipment. The smugglers' wives and 'children have
 remained in the chief's grip, as hostages.
 The risks are immense and the rewards a pit-
 tanec-p: rhaps $13 fdi a trip that may take as
 long as a month. But the poverty of the tribesmen
 of the Afghan border is so great, their ignorance
 and their bondage to their feudal overlords so com-
 plete, that most of Afghanistan's opium, perhaps
 100 tons yearly, Is carried over the mountains to
 Iran, where hundreds of thousands of addicts de-
 pend on It. About 85 tons of. it makes it through
 a border where the guards are on a constant war
 footing.
 11 FEB 1973
 To deal with the problems created by an addict
 population that is among the largest of any coun-
 try, Iran has tried total permissiveness, total pro-
 hibition and - now - limited toleration. Under a
 1969 law, Shah' Mohammed Riza Pahlevi ended
 prohibition, lifted a 14-year-old ban on the cultiva-
 tion of the opium poppy in his country and gave
 some official sanction to addiction by permitting
 110,000card-carrying addicts to buy daily doses
 of opium at designated pharmacies. At the same
 time, the law provided Draconian pun'shment for
 possession or trading of illicit narcotics. Mere pos-
 session of 2-kilograms (4.4 pounds) of iilkcit opium
 or 10 grams (about one-third of an ounce) of
 heroin, morphine or cocaine is enough to merit
 the firing squad, as is trading In any quantity of
 narcctics.
 In the three years of the law's operation, about
 160 smugglers and pushers have been dispatched
 by firing squads after rather summary military-
 court proceedings. Nevertheless, despite the opium-
 dispensing program and the harsh smuggling penal-
 ties, there has been no noticeable drop in either
 addiction or the steady flow of opium that comes
 across the border from Afghanistan to the east.
 While Iran faces some of the same enforcement
 dilemmas as the United States, the similarity just
 about ends thero. Addiction in Iran is not what 'it
 is in the United States, in its nature, causes or its
 effects; but the differences are instructive.  .
 The American problem is heroin, as "hard" a
 drug as there is. The Iranian national narcotic is
 opium, a milder and far less addictive substance
 than heroin, which is the most potent concentrate
 of opium. The "highs" produced by heroin are much
 higher than those of opium, and the "lows" lower.
 The social problems caused by the use of heroin
 are correspondingly more dramatic.
 Iranian opium users fit into their culture, not
 only because they have always been part of it but
 also because opium is in itself less corrosive to
 the social fabric than heroin.' Trafficking in nar-
 cotics and their surreptitious use remain crimes, but
 they do not significantly raise the general level of
 criminality as they do in the United States. Opium
 is, comparatively, a penny habit that can be
 sustained Qeven by the poor, -not something that
 drives addicts to turn to crime to raise money. In
 the United States, the use of heroin leads to street
 crime, because the street provides a meeting place
 between moneyless addicts desperate for a fix and
 ,people with money in their pockets or shops to
 be held up. Most of Iran's opium users live in the
 impoverished countryside, where there are no stores
 and where rich men rarely visit with money in
 their pockets.
 While regular use of opium induces a dependence
 that makes persons irritable and unable to conccn-
 trate when' deprived and lowers general health,
 these  decidedly  negative  effects  are  less
 socially disruptive In an undeveloped country than

 Iran, the Shah braved the dis-
 approval of Western nations,
 particularly the United States,
 and turned the clock back-
 ward. He reintroduced limited
 cultivation of the poppy under
 strict supervision, and along
 with recognizing addiction by
 putting  users'  on   main-
 tenance rations, he provided
 for an expanded voluntary
 treatment program-and for
 the threat of the firing squad
 for trafficking and illegal use.
 Now, an inexorable law of
 markets  and  comparative
 economic development has all
 but solved the problem of
 smuggling from Turkey into
 Iran-but not from Afghanis-
 tan. Almost overnight, the
 passage of the 1969 law re-
 duced the Turkish share of the
 illicit Iranian  market from
 about half to about 5 per cent.
 Turkey never depended on
 Iran as sole market for her
 excellent,  if  illicit,  opium.
 At the ? same time- as ' the
 Iranian market became less
 accessible-because  of  the
 border patrols-another, far
 more prosperous clientele be-
 gan to clamor for all the
 heroin 'it could get. What the
 Turkish smugglers no longer
 dared carry to Iran, they chan-
 neled into the well-established
 -network that buys raw opium
 j from the farmer, refines it to
 morphine  base  at  various
 rustic spots in Turkey before
 secreting :t among less lucra-
 1 tive cargoes heading toward
 France by ship or truck. There
 it is converted to heroin for
 delivery to the United States.
 Beyond this.purely commer-
 cial reason, experts believe
 I there is another justification
 for the ' fact that far fewer
 Turks will  risk the death
 1 penalty than Afghans. While
 the mountains and plains of
 Eastern Anatolia are unlikely
 to remind the traveler of the
 1 American or Western Euro-
 I. pean countryside, they are
 would follow suit. But, ' no
 doubt because of the certainty'
 that Afghanistan cannot stop
 her poppies from making their
 way across the border, Iran
 continues legal production.. In
 any case, enforcement experts
 are convinced that it will be
 some years'before the stocks
 of narcotics hidden in Turkey
 will all have been channeled
 into the United States and the
 effects of the Turkish ban-
 if it is maintained-will be-
 come noticeable on the mar-
 ket. "
 Iran's present opium prob-
 lem is created by two classes
 of victims of underdevelop-
 ment: poor Iranian peasants.
 who use narcotics because
 nothing else has yet come
 along strong enough to break
 a tradition imposed by the
 hardships of their lives, and
 Afghan smugglers who are
 even poorer. These victims
 live in a world dominated by
 their own poverty; wealthy
 Afghan merchants who own
 the supplies; wealthy Iranian
 merchants who handle ' the
 distribution; the Afghan Gov-
 ernment, which is so weak
 that it surrenders to feudal
 chiefs control over its citizens,
 and the Shah's Government
 with its Imperial Gendarmerie,
 courts-martial   and   firing
 squads.

 through a long-standing as-

 merie has a close acquaint-
 ance with Afghan smugglers.
 "They are serfs."

 dahar and Herat, the prin.
 cipal towns, buy opium from
 the growers. through tribal
 middlemen. Eventually, most
 of the 100 tons of Afghan
 opium grown yearly finds its
 way to the Herat region, from
 'where' the caravans set out.--
 Clan leaders put together the
 caravans, from 10 to 20 men
 strong, chosen from among
 those over whom their rule is
 complete. Usually only the
 leader of the caravan is told
 about the delivery arrange-
 ments, whether the Iranian
 contact will meet them at a
 prearranged place or whether
 they are to take their cargo
 across the border, bury it and
 post guards around the spot
 while the leader goes to make
 Contact in a village or town
 to arrange for delivery and
 payment. The caravans some-
 times penetrate as deeply as
 100 miles into Iran, in regions
 where people of the same
 . tribe live on both sides of the-
 border and neither Iran's nor
 Afghanistan's writ runs fully.
 The  Gendarmerie  patrols
 the nearly 500 miles of the
 Afghan border from 55 posts,
 each manned by 6 to 10 men.
 They walk the forbidding ter-
 rain between posts, looking
 for smugglers' tracks. Recent-
 ly the American advisory mis-
 sion, which has worked with
 the gendarmes since 1942,
 persuaded  them  to  buy
 100  Japanese  cross-country
 motorcycles.. This   mechan-
 ization would increase- sur-
 veillance of the border and
 speed the calling of reinforce-
 ments from rear areas when
 a caravan's tracks have been
 spotted.
 The smugglers, facing the
 death penalty if they are
 caught or the vengeance of
 their chiefs if they lose the
 opium, fight back when en-
 gaged during the day, usually
 scrambling for high ground to
 fire down on the gendarmes.
 On occasion, the troops have
 used mortars to dislodge the
 brigands.  At  nightfall,  the
 smugglers break off contact
 and flee, sometimes back to-
 ward Afghanistan, sometimes
 deeper into Iran. Bandits often
 raid Iranian villages, looting
 or seizing hostages for ran-
 som, so that they need not
 return empty-handed to their
 villages.

 Iran has made handsome
 progress in applying some of
 her annual petroleum income
 of approximately $1.3-billion
 to development, and as the
 country advances economical=
 ly, Iranian opium habits will
 become increasingly harmful.
 But much progress will have
 to be made before the lot of
 the impoverished Iranian will
 be seriously worsened because
 he uses opium. He would al-
 ways be better off, physically
 and financially, if he didn't
 use it, but the low standard
 of life in the mud villages is
 not greatly depressed by the
 villagers' opium habit.
 Nevertheless, such men as
 Dr. Saleh and Dr. Azarakhsh
 deplore the smoking of opium
 because as physicians as well
 as patriots it pains them to
 see Persians on a. large scale
 indulge in a habit that is un-
 healthy. "It's like you bring
 up a child until he's 14 years
 old and then you cut his head
 .off," Dr. Saleh said.
 They are unhappy that the
 resumption of opium-growing.
 after 14 years of total ban
 and the official sanction of '
 registered addiction seeming-

 to a habit they hate. In addi-
 tion, even though a number of
 new treatment centers have
 been opened under the Shah's
 program, Dr. Azarakhsh, a
 man given to prudent under-
 statement, says, "As of now,
 the  treatment  of  addicts
 doesn't work too well."
 Perhaps one day Iran will
 reach a level of development
 at which few people will find
 opium  the easiest  escape
 route or a necessary painkiller.

 dition, the United States has rccog-.
 nized the Viet Cong as a'legitimate
 force-one with which Saigon must
 reach an accommodation and enter
 into a "National Council of National
 Reconciliation and Concord," aiming
 for what in effect is a coalition
 government.
 It is one thing for the United
 States to negotiate a peaceful politi-.
 cal settlement for an agonizing and
 brutalizing war, and then withdraw
 from Vietnam. It is quite another
 thing for Saigon to live up complete-
 ly to the negotiated terms. The price
 for the return of American POWs
 and a negotiated cease-fire *as ob-
 viously high when measured against
 initial American objectives of an
 "independent South Vietnam free
 from attack."
 Americans, of course, are more
 than ready to pay the price. But
 what about Saigon?
 Although Saigon has failed to
 uphold its claim as the sole legiti-
 mate government in South Vietnam
 by either securing the necessary'
 'popular support or utilizing Ameri-
 can firepower to punish its enemies,
 the goal has not been abandoned.
 Yet, the agreement signed yesterday

 .If the political stalemate is to be bro-
 ken, then more concessions by Sai-:
 gon seem necessary-ones that are
 almost certain to lead to President
 Thieu's loss of his present position.
 of power..
 Stronger reasons can be cited than
 simply Thieu's desire for personal
 power that make the prospects dim
 for concessions and 'reconciliation.
 There is little precedent in' the Viet-
 namese character-whether north
 or south, Communist or anti-Com-
 munist-for reconciliation. This is
 not because the Vietnamese are in-
 humane but because their traditions
 tell them that the single correct so-
 lution to social organization lies in
 individual ethics and governmental
 order.
 The tradition is often. called "The
 Mandate of Heaven," by which the
 Vietnamese mean that heaven has re-
 vealed a way that family groups can
 live in harmony with its will.
 Reconciliation  and  compromise
 are, by their very nature, anathema
 to the tradition of "The Mandate of,
 Heaven." Such gestures are admis-
 sions not only that one's own con-
 cept of social and political order-
 be it communism, Catholicism, Bud-
 dhism - is not totally correct, but
 that there is no single correct solu-
 tion for the organization of society.
 Amid the carnage and exhaustion
 of Vietnamese society, such tradi-'
 tions as "The Mandate of Heaven",
 may well die away. But if so, its pas-
 sage will not come soon. The past
 decades of Vietnamese life have
 b ien go  h4f443 that egtebli?htad trii=

 only social anchor for the predomi-
 nantly rural-now almost half-refu-

 are alien to traditionalist societies

 like Vietnam that still must deal
 with the "pluralist" challenges of
 modernization and industrialization.
 In "pluralist" societies, par] iamen=
 Lary debates and popular elections
 are useful means of resolving cone
 flicts. But in traditionalist societies
 like Vietnam, elections and debates
 are only rituals glorifying the cor-
 rectness of the particular regime in

 negotiating skills and for the useful-

 not be a mixture of both unless the

 Such a prospect seems remote in-

 .one of America's most experienced
 .scholars on Vietnam revealed the
 results of a field trip throughout the
 countryside. .
 "The cease-fire is unlikely to last
 60 to 90 days beyond the date of
 American withdrawal," he observed.
 "So certain is Saigon over its own

 AGAINST WAR FOES
 Past Critics" of President's
 Policies Are Assailed
 By JOHN HERBERS
 Speelel to The New York Times
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 3-Now
 that a peace agreement in
 Vietnam has been reached,
 members of the Nixon Adminis-
 tration have undertaken 'to
 discredit the critics of the Pres-
 ident's conduct of the war and
 of peace negotiations.
 In the last week, Adminis-
 tration officials have charged
 that the criticism delayed the
 peace agreement, that colum-
 nists and commentators fabri-

 between Mr. Nixon and Henry
 A. Kissinger during the Decem-
 'ber .bombing and. that the
 President has been 'subjected
 to unfair criticism.
 ? The charges were leveled at
 members  of  Congress,  the
 media and officials in the Ken-
 ncdy.and Johnson Administra-

 bombing,  mining  and  other
 activity by the United States.
 Mr. Nixon, at his news con-
 ference last Wednesday, said
 that "the least pleasure out of
 the ;"peace agreement comes
 from those who were the most
 outspoken advocates of peace,
 at any ' price.",.
 Peace Seen Delayed
 ?; On Thursday night, Charles
 W. Colson, special counsel tol
 the President, interviewed byl
 Elizabeth Drew on the Public
 Broadcasting' Service television
 network, said `that the opposi-

 delayed  the  negotiation  of
 peace.
 If-there had been bipartisan

 was doing, he said, "I think thel

 which the fighting flared and spread instead of subsiding,
 has ended more quietly.  But there is no sign so far of
 any of the hopeful factors in the agreements showing
 tender shoots, and plenty,of c opfirmation for the first grim
 forebodings.  The North Vietnamese demonstrated their
 ability to take the initiative. in the new situation' and,
 although they may have -suffered heavier losses than the
 Southe;4n troops, they scored more points. Now they are
 preparing for what could be Round Two in the shape of
 an assaplt on the provincial capital of Quang Tri.
 ,With the South, under the agreements, denied arms
 supplies other than replacements, its only hope of ce tain-
 ing the North Vietnamese forces in their " leopard-spot
 enclaves lies in these also being held fo the mutual
 restrictions. Yet, on the contrary ' supplies and reinforce-

 and the military committees composed of the parties to the
 war, although gradually taking shape, are still bogged down ;
 in procedural, administrative and logistical problems. Not
 that anyone can imagine the Polish and Hungarian
 have compromised' this coun-
 try's  position  in ' Vietnam."
 What those people were advo-
 cating, Mr. Colson said, was
 a -"dishonorable peace."
 He identified four Senators-
 W. ' Fulbright of Arkansas,
 George  McGovern  of  South
 Dakota, Frank  Church    of
 Idaho and Edward M. Kennedy
 of,.Massachusetts-as "part of
 the 'sellout brigade."'
 "I think they would have

 he said. ?   ?
 ..,Mr. Colson used the words
 "sell-out brigade" in an "Op-Ed
 column" in, The New Yorkl
 Times last Tuesday in which he
 charged that reports of differ-
 ences between the President
 and Mr. Kissinger were a "full-
 blown myth born in Wash-
 ington  Georgetown  cocktail
 .circuit that had made Mr. Kis-
 singer's peace efforts more dif-

 ;'Ronald S., Ziegler, the White
 House  press  secretary, . rein-
 forced Mr. Colson's argument
 in a long discourse with report-
 ers, who wanted to know if the
 column had the President's ap-
 proval. He said that Mr. Colson
 was speaking for himself but he
 sought to show that there was
 no evidence for high-level divi-
 sion on the war.
 Flat Stand on Kissinger
 "There was no difference of
 view on the' matter of the bomb.
 ing that took place, in Decem-
 bcr,i' Mr. Ziegler said. "I can
 state flatly that he [Mr.'Kissin-
 ger] did not oppose It." Asked
 if it were possible as widely'be-
 lieved, that Mr. Kissinger had
 been 'the source of the reports,
 Mr, Ziegler said that he could
 not believe anyone who so com-
 pletely agreed with the Presi-
 dent in White House meetings
 could spread reports of division.,
 During the week, Senator
 Barry Goldwater, Republican of.
 Arizona, distributed an unsigned,
 "Vietname white paper" that
 was reported to have originated
 in the Administration. Mr. Gold-
 water, in his accompanying let-,
 ter, endorsed the paper without.
 identifying its source. Several
 thousand copies were distrib-
 uted.    -
 "For four agonizing years.

 Meanwhile Dr  KISSINGER,  for whose " peace with

 visit Hanoi on Friday and Peking next week.  To Hanoi
 he will take those familiar instruments of President NIxoN's
 Vietn-ani policy, the carrot and the stick-now in that
 order. The former is as succulent as a few billion dollars
 can make it.  Dr KISSINGER dwells on Hanoi's need for
 peace aid reconstruction after 20 years of war. 'He may
 be misunderstanding the North Vietnamese Communists if
 he thinks that, with victory suddenly seeming so much
 closer, with no public opinion or democratic qualms of

 aid and friendship. They may be more impressed with the

 Vietnam: ? peace, and conflict
 A ceasefire after a quarter of a century of
 bloody, destructive fighting in Vietnam is some-
 thing the whole world as well as the Vietnamese
 can be relieved at and grateful for.  It Is not
 important that President Nixon called it "peace
 with honour" and Hanoi a "great victory" at
 the same time. The vital and decisive point is
 that the scale of fighting and killing now
 Is  likely  to  be  drastically  reduced  and
 that the Americans should be leaving.     The
 Vietnamese are now left to sort things out for
 themselves after their tensions had been exacer-
 bated by ,the French, the Japanese, the French'.
 again, and then the Americans.
 The ghastliness of the war can be offset only
 In part by President Nixon's statement that the
 US was prepared to make a major effort to
 build a peace of reconciliation." This will not
 bring back to life or heal the, two and a half
 million Vietnamese dead and wounded, ftor can
 It restore homes to the millions of refugees. It
 will not restore trees and crops to the defoliated
 acres, nor will it re-create the cities, villages, and
 countryside turned to rubble under the rain of
 bombs' dropped on Indo-China (mainly on South
 Vietnam) since 1966.' It has been a war of
 wrong tactics used at the wrong time, with
 hideous results for Vietnam, South and North.
 If Dr Kissinger has brought back peace for
 the Americans In their time, has be done the same
 for the Vietnamese ? President Nixon put a
 sturdy face and voice on his ceasefire announce-
 ment. But the vague nature of the agreement-
 after years of fighting, bombing, and negotiating
 -appears In fact to have raised a smokescreen
 behind which the US can disappear with a
 minimum of dignity lost.
 And on the ground In Vietnam ? Unless there
 is an unprecedented demonstration of goodwill
 and resolution by all Vietnamese parties to make
 the published terms work, the long term prospects.
 .must be gloomy. The major concession that the
 US has obtained is that Saigon and the Vietcong
 will try to do their utmost to bring about the
 '..release, . within 90 days of the ceasefire, of
 Vietnamese civilian  personnel  captured and
 .retained, in South Vietnam. It is easy to see how
 President Thieu's best efforts could be insufficient.
 Monday. reb.5.197.4  THE WASHINGTON POST
 U. n n R 11
 As, Use'
 Thieu has issued a stern injunction to suppress
 by shooting, if necessary, any support for the
 Communists. He is keen to postpone as long as!,
 possible any opportunity for the Communists to `;
 rebuild their cadres. There is. no hurry, in his ,
 eyes, to let the prisoners out.
 Nor is he in any hurry to let the refugees,
 If home is in a Vietcong-controlled district, or,
 to desist from using the apparatus of arrest and
 terror to hold his remaining areas in the South..i
 The prescribed 90 days, of course, are too short
 a time in which to relax the tensions and
 establish an :easier way of life.  A beginning
 could be made if the will were there. Perhaps,
 when Vietnamese face Vietnamese on their own,
 it will prove nearer than seems probable. Morel
 than the 90 days will pass before the reality is
 seen.
 The National Council of National Reconcilia-
 tion looks as unpromising as it always has. Both
 Thieu and the Communists are determined to.
 canvass strength by force. Neutrals to make up
 the third party will be hard to find, and unanimity
 within the council even harder. The limited size
 of the ceasefire control commission (always a
 notional force), the continued presence of North'
 Vietnamese troops, and the lack of troop'
 regroupment areas makes more likely-the even-;
 tual renewal of fighting-with the commission'
 just 'making notes.  On a wider scale, the
 prevention of military activity in Laos and Cam-'
 bodia seems fragile. The US appears still to have
 leeway enough to continue bombing the trails
 from Thailand. Will it not be warned by past
 experience to avoid further involvement ?
 The legacy of eight years of deep American
 Involvement in the Vietnamese war will be, fe'lt~
 far beyond Vietnam.  The frustration, loss of
 self-confidence, and fear of foreign involvement)
 among Americans will affect international rela-
 tions for the remainder of this century. President;
 Nixon was putting a gentle gloss on it all when
 he said, in his inaugural address, that America ;
 will no longer make every other nation's conflict
 its own or every other. nation's future Its:
 responsibility. Although Intervention In Vietnam
 was in the end- a disaster, Atfterica's withdrawal
 from world responsibility is' the world's loss.

 James Reston, also of the

 if it was, then he should medi-

 clearly paid off.
 Anthony Lewis, also of the

 would be without effect. As it
 happens, the bombing turned

 No, a sensible reading is
 this: Bombing, unless it is
 done with crushing force over
 a period of time sufficient to
 knock off critically needed
 lubricants of war (See "The
 Memoirs of Albert Speer"),

 One measure of the situa-

 IN A MONTH to be marked by Kis-'

 Asia, the opening of an international,'

 cease-fire agreements, and probably'.
 the 'application of parallel cease-fires
 An Lang and Cambodia, it is timely to?
 consider what role the United States,
 should plan to play in the coming dec
 ade throughout East Asia  and the
 Western Pacific.
 A number ' of  questions come to
 mind. Should the United States en-
 deavor itself to enforce the cease-fire
 agreements in the  three Indochina
 states, or should it leave enforcement
 to the opposing parties in these coun-
 tries, supplemented by international
 machinery which cannot be expected
 to have strong teeth?
 Should the United States maintain
 Intact all of the various alliances, de
 fense pacts, commitments, bases and,
 military deployments which 'we have'
 built up over the past quarter century'
 throughout the area? These include'
 the Southeast Asia Treaty Organiza-
 tion, bilateral. defense treaties with Ja-
 pan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, the
 Anzus Pact with Australia and New.
 Zealand and substantial United States'
 military forces in Korea, Japan and
 Thailand, as well as the Seventh Fleet
 patrolling the coasts of East and South-
 east Asia.
 All this adds up to a still. very large
 American military involvement in a
 part of the world where the rationale
 for such involvement seems to have di-
 minished, if not disappeared,
 The power orginally responsible for,
 our involvement, Japan, is now one of!
 our closest friends. Communist China,'
 which for 20 years we perceived to be,
 first, an instrument of the Soviet Un
 ion and,. second, inveterately expan='
 sionist itself, is now perceived to be"
 neither.
 - While is would be hazardous to pre-
 dict the more distant future, it seems
 reasonably certain that for some yeatrs
 to conic China will be preoccupied
 with its own domestic economic and
 political problems and with. its anxie-
 ties about the Soviet Union.'For that
 time at least it will pose no serious
 threat to its neighbors.
 There is likely to be for some time A
 continuing; zone of instability in South-
 cast Asia, where our prolonged and ex-
 cessive intervention has delayed estab-
 lishment of an equilibrium 'among in-
 digenous forces which alone could be
 durable.
 As a correspondent of The Washing-
 ton Post. Thomas Lippman, wrote from
 Saigon a few days ago, the Indochina
 Nixon responded by promising the So
 viet Union a "role" In shaping the
 post-war structure of power.
 ' Chou En-lai's objections to Russia's'y

 Lice thr.t China does not wish any such....
 American-Soviet deal to be consum-
 mated. This is the kind of complication
 that was to be expected as Mr. Nixon
 began to shape the "balance of power"
 which, he believes, will maintain the
 peace of the world, not just of Indo-
 china, after the Vietnam War.
 Peking and Moscow are as intrigued
 by Mr. Nixon's balance-of-power, for-
 mula as everybody else. By a happy. co-
 incidence, some of the questions raised
 about it in this column last week were,
 promptly answered in Dr. Kissinger's
 TV interview with CBS. The shifting
 alliances which characterized the bale.
 ante of power in the 19th century, he
 explained, were not applicable in the
 nuclear age.                    -
 The Kremlin.will certainly be glad
 to have this reassurance on the eve of
 Dr. Kissinger's trip to Peking. Its '
 own study of Mr. Nixon's "five-polar
 world," in which the United States and"
 the Soviet Union are to be joined as
 .super-powers By China, Europe and Ja-
 pan, has given Moscow cause for con-
 corn. Soviet studies now conclude that'
 the  new  "poles"  are  intended 'to
 "counter-balance"  the  Soviet Union
 and "to ease the burden of imperial-
 ism's struggle against socialism," that
 is, to help the United States to prevail
 over the Soviet Union.'
 They argue that China's, role as the
 "third pole" has been designed by the
 United States "to accord exclusively
 with the interests of capitalism.'! This,
 they believe, explains the "marked ac-
 tivity" of the United States in building
 up China's role.
 The Kremlin evidently does not ac-

 does not want,  to play off.  Russia
 against China. The balance of power
 does not balance-yet. But a balance
 of sorts was achieved by the most bril
 liant diplomatic operation known, to
 history when, Russia and China helped
 the United States to end the war. The
 men who accomplished this-in  all

 And Power Politics.
 DR. KISSINGER will carry to China
 this month the payoff for Peking's
 help in settling the Vietnam war, but
 it looks as if Mao Tse-tung is in for a
 disappointment. The United States has
 made promises both to Peking and to
 Moscow. If it tries to give full satisfac.
 tion to either capital, the other will
 A year ago Mr. Nixon promised that
 Russia as well as China "will play a
 role in shaping a new structure of re-
 gional stability" after the war. The
 United States would no longer provide
 "the principal means of guaranteeing
 Asian security. But as the triangular
 balance proposed by Mr. Nixon began
 to take 'shape, both China and the So-
 viet Union set to work to keep the
 other out of the area.'
 Peking now complains that although
 China and the United States had
 agreed to forgo supremacy in Asia and
 the Pacific, the Soviet Union refused
 to give up "its attempt to dominate the
 area." It was trying to achieve this, said
 Chou En-lai, the Chinese premiere, by
 promoting an Asian "collective secu-
 rity system"  designed to  encircle
 China.          -
 The Russians are not content. with
 Mr. Nixon's promise to share with
 them and with China the influence
 which the United States has exercised
 in the past. Tbcy seem to fear that
 they may be cheated out of what they
 believe is their due.
 The fears which the Kremlin was
 voicing so freely before Mr. Nixon's
 visit to Peking, and which were al-
 layed somewhat by his visit to Moscow,
 are rampant again. "Peking and Wash-
 ington have  agreed  to  divide  the
 sphere of influence in Southeast Asia
 between them," says Moscow radio, "at
 the expense of third countries," that is,
 of Russia. China, it says, wants the
 United States to remain in the area,
 since 'this would make it difficult for
 the countries of Southeast Asia to ac-
 quire "new allies"-such as the Soviet
 Union.
 1 Before Mr. Nixon's trip to China, the
 Kremlin let it be known that it fa-
 vored the post-war "neutralization"
 of the area, which would be "guar-
 anteed," as Pravda put it, by the
 United States, China, and the' Soviet
 Union. This was what the Kremlin
 hoped to get eventually ii exchange for

 When Thicu finally accepted
 the agreement two weeks ago,
 officials here were emphasiz-
 ing the difficulties of the two
 sides being able to agree on
 internal matters and holding
 elections. There seemed to be
 no hurry, since Thieu was left
 in control of the government
 for however long it took.
 But between Thieu's speech
 at the time the cease-fire 10
 days ago and his Lunar New
 Year address to the nation six
 days later (last Saturday), the
 government's attitude seems
 to have changed.
 New Emphasis
 The speech last Saturday
 emphasized for the first time
 the importance of reaching a
 political agreement with the
 Viet Cong quickly, so that the
 way could be cleared for elec-
 tions.
 Thieu said then nb was fa-
 structing his special negotiator
 in Paris, ambassador Pham
 Dang Lam, to begin the pre-
 paratory  consultations with
 the Viet Cong provided for in
 thecease -fireagreement..
 These talks began Monday and
 were continuing today in
 Paris.
 The opening attitude was
 that procedural matters could
 be cleared up speedily. Lam
 told reporters later that the
 Viet Cong foreign minister,
 Mrs. Nguyen Thi Binh, "Can
 come to Saigon when she likes
 to begin her consultations."
 This  reversed an earlier
 feeling here that the potential-
 ly infectious Mrs. Binh and
 her comrades should be kept
 away as long as possible. The
 Saigon. government now sees
 early  elections as possibly;
 being to its benefit, so wants
 to move along.
 What Election?
 This does not mean that ear-
 ly elections will necessarily
 follow. As Lam also said, pro-;
 cedural  matters are going '
 smoothly but "it might be,
 more difficult when fundamen-
 tal problems were reached."
 The most fundamental prob-
 lem is what kind of elections.
 Thieu has advocated a presi-,:
 dential race, with the winner,.:
 to form a cabinet which re-
 flects the percentage of votes
 polled by various factions.
 Thieu is conficent of winning,
 .a view shared by most inde-
 pendent observers at the pres-
 ent time.
 Knowing this, the Commu-
 nists want an election for a
 constituent  assembly which
 would then decide what form
 of government South Vietnam
 should have. Even a relatively
 small Communist bloc in such

 not go their way at first they
 could try to *break up the as-

 That process could go on for
 long enough to cause those

 The Indochina war is in dan-
 ger of? major escalation into a
 new "secret war" which would
 involvethousands of U.S. ad-
 visers under the leadership of
 the Central Intelligence Agen-
 cy, according to a former
 worker among the refugees of
 Laos who has made a, study of
 the "secret war" in that coun-
 try.
 Fred Brantman, a leading
 critic of American involve-
 ment in Indochina who has
 written extensively about the
 covert U.S. bombing of Laos,-
 presented a collection of 32
 reports from major American
 newspapers at a news confer-
 ence yesterday, to back up his
 contention that the U.S. ap-
 pears headed for a major rein-
 vestment of civilian forces and
 paramilitary air, and ground
 units in Vietnam.
 "This is the period when a
 President  could pull out,"
 Branfman said, "but if these
 press clippings turn out to be
 right, then new escalation of
 the air war is likely.
 "I think it's likely to happen
 again... It has happened several
 times before in Indochina."
 The ? news dispatches out-
 lined reports that 10,000 civil-
 ian advisers, double the pres-
 ent number, under Defense
 Department contract will re-
 main. in Vietnam; that the Sai-
 gon government has been re-
 cruiting Air Force technicians
 in American newspaper classi-
 fied ads; that the access of
 American reporters to the
 scenes of incidents and battles
 already has been curtailed
 drastically, and that South Vi-
 etnamese officials and local
 police are blocking the release
 of political prisoners and or-
 deering the shooting of sus-
 pectcd Communists in viola-
 tion of the cease-fire accord.
 (South Vietnamese sources
 said however, that Saigon has,
 released about 20,000 military
 and civilian prisoners in the
 past few days, turning them
 lose on their own despite pro-
 visions in the cease-fire agree-
 ment that they be turned over
 to the North Vietnamese or
 the Viet Cong, the New York
 Times reported Monday.
 Many of the articles were
 written  before  the  peace
 agreement was signed, and
 some referred to plans for a
 continuing American presence
 as only contingency plans.
 "If President Nixon was pre-
 pared to allow the Vietnamese
 to settle their' own affairs, he
 would presumably back away
 from  Vietnam while soft-
 pedalling his public identifica-
 tion with Thieu," Branfman
 said.
 If the President does allow a
 covert war to continue, Branf-
 man said, the 'history of past
 actions in Vietnam suggests
 that eventually the hidden mil-
 itary and paramilitary activi.
 ties will be supplemented by
 new bombing, either openly
 or, as in Laos in the past, in
 secret.
 "The American government
 simply lied about it (the bomb-
 ing) in Laos," Branfman said.
 He predicted that if President
 Nixon "intervenes in a covert
 manner in Vietnam" then the
 likelihood of renewed bombing
 there will be very high.  .
 He said widespread publicity
 of such actions would effec-
 tively stop them, but that both
 the American press and the
 international observers would
 have difficulty seeing such vio-
 lations first hand if the Saigon
 government refuses them ac-
 cess to areas of the country,
 as has happened In Laos.

 WASHINGTON POST
 7 February, 1973
 Tad Szu.Ic
 A Time fog Rebuilding
 PRESIDENT Nixon said at, Ills Jan. 31
 news conference that with the advent
 of the Vietnamese peace agreement
 the United States would now consider
 a postwar "reconstruction program"
 for the two Vietnams along with the
 rest of Indochina. This, he said, would
 he an incentive for the preservation of
 peace. Besides, as we know, postwar
 reconstruction of ravaged territories of
 allied and enemy nations alike has be-
 come in this century an American tra-
 dition.
 But an analysis of political,, military,
 economic and-quite importantly-eco-
 logical realities involved in such a re-
 TYirt writer is, a \ former diplo-
 -n.ntir, and foreign correspondent
 for the Nev tYork Times.
 construction effort raises major ques-
 tions about its feasibility in the forese-
 able future. The result might well be
 that reconstruction pledges (as distinct
 from the U.S. commitment to ? contin-
 ued aifl for' South Vietnam's economic
 survival) will become meaningless and
 lose even their psychological value as
 a possible comprehensive package for
 encouraging peace maintenance.
 Mr. Nixon and others have spoken of
 it possible comprehensive package for
 all  Indochina.  He  has  instructed
 Henry Kissinger, while he is in Hanoi
 this month, to discuss Indochina-wide
 reconstruction with the North Viet-
 namese. Administration officials have,
 even thrown around the figure of $7.5-
 billion as the cost of reconstruction al-
 though nobody here is quite sure what
 it means in terms of projects.
 For the purpose of clarity, It Is nec-
 essary to break. down the overall re-
 construction . concept  Into  realistic
 component parts.
 1. Immediate problems in South Viet-'
 nam.  The . immediate problem is to
 keep the Saigon economy going as
 much for political reasons as anything
 else. President Thieu, who has to main-
 ,tain' his  1,000,000-man army Indefi-
 phase of ' the power contest with the
 National Liberation Front if his artifi-
 cial economy collapses under him.
 Considering the military costs, the
 needs of the Saigon middle class (whom
 Thieu cannot afford to antagonize). and
 the urgency of social programs for an
 estimated 8,000,000 refugees. and other
 war victims, the first priority-Is budget
 support and stabilization. The annual
 tag for these expenditures may exceed
 $750,000,000 in U.S. funds, Witholtt it,
 long-range reconstruction is not 'possi-
 ble.
 2. Reconstruction policies in. South
 Vietnam. Even assuming that the Saigon
 regime acts strongly and responsibly
 (i.e..   eliminates   corruption   and
 favoritism), coherent national postwar
 planning is  virtually Impossible   so
 long as South  Vietnam remains       a
 patchwork of areas controlled here by
 Saigon and there by the Communists.
 But the Paris accords, allowing the
 160,000 North Vietnamese troops to
 stay in the South, may perpetuate this
 mind-boggling mosaic for months If
 not for years. It would be preposterous
 to expect local South Vietnamese and
 Communist commanders to cooperate
 in reconstruction' in contested areas
 under a stand-still ceasefire.
 Vietnam economic specialists believe
 that Thieu's ne*t pressing problem is
 to start moving the masses of refugees
 from the suffocatingly  overcrowded
 Saigon and other cities (only 650,000
 refugees are in camps) back to the
 countryside. Otherwise urban unem-
 ployment could become political dyna-
 mite for Thieu and a boon for the
 Communists. Likewise, the South's ag-
 ricultural economy desperately needs
 manpower.
 3. Reconstruction policy problems. But
 the complications is, specialists say, that
 insecurity in  the  countryside-the
 "leopard spots" situation-is unlikely
 to draw back enough refugees, espe-
 cially the younger people who have
 tasted city life.
 N    Another major problem, generally
 I overlooked' in current discussions, is
 the economic and ecological damage
 inflicted on the countryside by nine
 years of herbicide  and  defoliation
 practiced by the U.S. against Commu-
 nist-held areas in the South In crop-de-
 struction and forest denuding opera-
 tions. Thus far the extent of the eco-
 logical damage Is unknown except that
 it is considerable.
 The National Academy of Sciences,
 working on a $2,000,000 grant from the
 Defense Department, is expected to
 complete on Aug. 1 a detailed study of
 ecological damage in South Vietnam.
 Experts say that until the survey is
 completed, no serious planning for ag-
 ricultural reconstruction can be under-
 taken.
 An earlier study of damage resulting
 from herbicides is contained in the still-
 'secret "Report on the Herbicide Policy
 Review." It was prepared by a U.S.' gov-
 ernment task force under the dirbction
 of Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and is
 dated August 28, 1968-some 18 months
 before the use of these chemicals was
 suspended.
 The report, obtained by this writer,
 states, among other things, that 20 per
 cent of South Vietnam's forests were
 "treated" by herbicides and defoliants
 through. the and of 1967-and . many
 areas were sprayed repeatedly. In t'he
 provinces north and northwest of Saigon,
 70 per cent of the timber has been af-
 fected. This is vital because, as the re-
 port stresses, "the forests of Vietnam
 employment ... Repeated application of
 defoliants in these zones could seriously
 retard regeneration of these forests."
 The wood industry is one of the most
 important in South Vietnam, normally
 employing 80,000 people. By 1968, the ,
 herbicides war led toy the destruction )
 "... post war reconstruc-
 tion of ravaged territories
 has become an
 American tradition .. '
 around Saigon alone of 2,000,000 cubic
 meters of timber which compares to '
 potential national annual production of
 3.5-million cubic meters.
 Bamboo invasion resulting from for-.
 est-canopy defoliation may delay tree
 regeneration  because  seedlings are
 killed. The report estimates that 20
 years will be required to restore man-
 groves destroyed by herbicides. In
 mangroves, ecological balances and the
 food-chain have been upset, affecting
 fish and birds.
 Rice'fields are ecologically Immune
 to herbicide damage, but rubber, fruit
 and beans are highly sensitive. The ex-
 tent of damage to the latter is un-
 known.
 So the gltest.ion is to what would the
 refugees be'returning?
 4. North Vietnam. Only after Kis-
 singer returns from Hanoi will the ad-
 ministration learn whether North Viet,

 would accept any U.S. or multilateral

 ing persists in Laos and Cambodia-
 and it may go on for a long time-such
 grandiose plans as the development of
 the whole Mekong River Valley basin

 efforts to impose its will on
 Indo-China,
 In Bangkok, the effort has
 always been  rationalised  as
 essentially defensive. In prac-
 tice, however, America's use of
 Thailand has been one of con-
 tinuing iniilitarv offence. With-
 out Thai bases, America could
 never have prosecuted its long
 secret war in Laos, used Laos
 to  support  attacks  against
 North Vietnam, or supported
 mercenary bands operating in
 Cambodia.
 From Thailand, the US has
 also mounted Para-military and
 espionage activities into Burma
 rand China. The final; massive
 B-52  raids  on  Hanoi  were
 ;mounted from Thai bases. Over
 the' last eight years, it has, been
 Thailand that has intervened in
 a Vietnam war, not the other
 way around.

 South Vietnam, Thailand now

 'South-east Asia's future now
 hinges on' whether- President
 ?Nixon will use his Thai bases,
 like the ones in Europe,' as a
 defensive deterrent or whether
 he will continue to use Thailand
 as a springboard for continuing

 Nonetheless, Mr. Porter added,
 only ? the Communist party in
 South Vietnam has what he
 termed the "leadership and dis-
 cipline" to match the political
 power of President Thieu.
 United States experts have
 estimated the number of clan-
 destine Communist party mem-
 bers in the South at more than
 100,000. The party structure
 has been described in State De-
 partment documents as closely
 paralleling at each level-from
 region down to village-the
 open political organization of
 the Provisional Revolutionary
 Government.
 The party has Its own politi-

 So far the portents are not
 hopeful. Chou Endai recently
 called on the US to end its mili-
 tary intervention in Laos and
 Cambodia,. Secret peace tanks are
 under way in Laos, and both`
 Cambodian sides are now will-
 ing to  accept a Cambodian
 cease fire, if not to agree to
 negotiated peace.
 On paper, the Paris ceasefire
 constituted an 'unprecedented
 renunciation   of   America's
 Indo-China ambitions. The first
 article  of the Paris accords
 pledges  that  America   will
 respect   " the independence,.
 sovereignty, unity, and terri-
 torial integrity of Vietnam as
 recognised by the 1.954 Geneva
 agreements." It was US refusal
 to  accept  the .1.954  Geneva
 accords, and their provisions
 for  a  peaceful    Vietnamese
 reunification that led to the
 foundation of SEATO, Thai-
 land's conversion into  a US
 beach-head, unremitting Ameri-
 can pressure on Laos and Cam.
 bodia, and the Vietnam war
 itself.
 Military action, however, con-
 tinues to be much more impor-
 tant than diplomatic words. The
 intensive US bombing of Laos
 and Cambodia has continued in
 spite of the Vietnam ceasefire.
 With more than 80,000 military'
 personnel at air bases in Thai-
 land and in naval squadrons off
 the coast of Vietnam, the last
 US  troop  withdrawals * from
 Vietnam    will   not  greatly
 diminish   President   Nixon's
 .ability to Intervene with bombs
 and napalm whenever events In
 Indo-China displease him.
 There is   clear rriegsege in
 the continuing US arms ship,

 truce bombings of Hanoi, his
 statement that the US will con-
 tinue . to recognise only Presi-
 dent ' Thieu, : Vice-President

 sion, and continuing US mili-
 tary activities in Laos and Cam-

 The  Nixon  Administration,
 for the moment, is not so much
 ending the -Indo-China conflict
 as continuing it : by other
 means. 'The easiest targets for
 the President to keep hitting
 are Communist supply routes
 and sanctuaries in Laos and
 Cambodia,  where  the  Paris

 end  its   military operations

 Laos's and Cambodia's prob- '
 lems are the products of tradi-
 tional  Thai-Vietnamese
 rivalries, which  have  been
 greatly deepened by 17 years of
 direct US  intervention. The
 present military  divisions in
 both countries roughly corres-

 WASHINGTON POST
 15 February, 1973
 T he' `Post-Vietnam' Period Begins
 T6 watch the first prisoners arriving at Clark Field gave
 most Americans, we are sure, not only personal joy but
 the best kind of` evidence that for this country at least,
 the war is coming to an end. This is a feeling shared by
 President Nixon, who rather gratuitously chose to take
 the returned men's salute to their commander-in-chief as
 vindication of his goal of. a "peace with honor," and by
 those who realize that most of the returning Americans
 are professional military men whose particular mission,
 the bombing, was among the most controversial of the
 war.
 The evident vigor and cheer of most men in the first
 contingents released by. Hanoi and the Vietcong were
 cause for particular satisfaction, since many Americans
 had probably feared 'Mr. Nixon was right when he said
 in 1971 that the North Vietnamese "without question have
 been the most barbaric in the handling of prisoners of
 any nation in history." Homecoming Is sure to be an ardu-
 ous psychological process. But If the Americans due to be
 freed in forthcoming prisoner exchanges are in the same
 apparently good physical condition, then that will be a
 boon. As the North Vietnamese certainly have calculated,
 'it will also bring them a politically useful measure of
 goodwill. The contrast of the smiling released Americans
 and the grim and gaunt Communist prisoners released by
 Saigon, could not be more sobering.
 The prisoners' return is, of course, only one aspect, an
 especially poignant one, of a range of "post-Vietnam"
 issues likely now to move toward the fore of American
 public life. Among these,are the situation of Vietnam
 ,veterans in general, the place of young men who chose
 to leave the country or otherwise avoid military service-
 or to desert after they were in uniform rather-than serve
 in Vietnam; and the separate but in a sense politically
 equal question of furnishing reconstruction aid to Indo.
 china,. including North and South Vietnam.
 Vietnam veterans, especially the physically and psycho-
 ,logically wounded, w6uld seem to command universal
 sympathy. Too many signs already indicate, however, that
 the same general attitude which led a disproportionate
 number of poor, less educated and black Americans to
 be sent to fight and die in Vietnam is affecting treatment
 of the survivors at home. Incredibly, for instance, even
 .as we prepared to celebrate the return of the POWs, the
 administration was proposing to reduce federal benefits
 for Vietnam amputees., Under congressional pressure,
 that plan has now been recalled by the White House.
 The proposal should be discarded permanently. It is hard
 to Imagine a more damaging and disrespectful gesture,
 toward our Vietnam veterans.
 The amnesty Issue is recognized as compelling by many
 Americans-those who respect the motives of young men
 who in conscience avoided military service and those
 whose prime concern Is to close the domestic divisions
 opened by the war. President Nixon, to be sure, has
 spoken. forcefully for those who believe that a respect for
 authority, and a respect for the men who accepted service
 and risked or lost their lives, rule out a policy of forgive-
 ness. We intend to elaborate our own views on this Issue
 on another occasion. For now, we would merely note that
 this is an issue peculiarly vulnerable to the atmosphere
 in which it is discussed. That atmosphere can hardly fail
 to soften as the cease-fire takes firmer hold and prisoners
 come home and veterans 'receive the care they deserve.
 Those who sympathize for the men who did not fight have
 practical political grounds as well as sound mor 4 com-
 pulsion for helping see to it that the men who did fight
 and return now fare well.
 Reconstruction aid to Indochina may become the most
 tortured issue of them all. The President has promised
 substantial funds but by his failure to ask Congress for
 the money he has called into question his own seriousness
 on the matter and by his general combative posture
 toward Congress he has compromised whatever aid ap-
 peal he might eventually make. Within Congress, if it
 ever gets to the question, a difficult alliance of con-
 venience may be, forced upon legislators whose, main
 Indochina interests are to sustain Saigon and help Hanoi
 respectively. We regard Indochina reconstruction as im-
 perative morally, essential politically for purposes of
 domestic healing, and equally vital diplomatically as a
 means of turning our involvement in Indochina into an
 international responsibility.
 It is scarcely too soon, as the prisoners begin to come
 home, for the President to start developing a balanced,
 fair and comprehensive program to deal with all the
 interrelated problems arising out of our long and costly
 entanglement in the Vietnam conflict.

 lean prisoners, both within a 60-day pe-
 riod,. during which time the four par-
 ticipating parties, as the agreement
 calls them, observe a cease-fire ? in
 place. This is all quite simple and
 straightforward. It is also probably
 achievable, because three of the par-
 ties-the United States, Hanoi, and the
 Vietcong-sincerely wish to  see  it
 achieved,  and  the  fourth, Saigon,
 which is probably less happy about the
 agreement, remains so dependent on
 continuing material support from the
 United States that it apparently has
 felt constrained to go along.
 Even then, it is no simple matter to
 shift suddenly from years of warfare
 to a cease-fire, especially when no
 clear. military boundary separates the
 combatants. The shooting may never
 stop entirely. However, there seems to
 be enough will on both sides to tune
 the fighting down to a tolerable level,
 and mechanisms have been created to
 police the cease-fire, at least for a
 while.  A  four-party  Joint  Military
 Commission, operating only during the
 60-day period, is to supervise the ex-
 ecution of the agreement. An Interna-
 tional Commission of Control and Su-
 pervision, consisting of something over
 1,000 men from. Canada, Hungary, In-

 achieved in a country that has never
 had truly free and democratic elec-

 no experience with or faith in elec-

 tween two military-based regimes that
 have fought each other fanatically for
 years and still so hate each other that
 they refused to sign a version of the
 agreement that,named the other and i
 on a more vaguely worded version in-

 Saigon appears to have some chance
 of surviving, but, if so, it would proba-
 bly remain beleaguered, at least for
 the foreseeable future. A slightly more
 probable outcome might be the under-
 mining of the Saigon regime and its
 eventual takeover by Hanoi. The speed
 of such a development, the degree of
 the South's autonomy, if any, and the
 manner 'of takeover-that is, whether
 it would be primarily through subver-
 sion or through military attack-are
 all quite beyond prediction. Whatever
 the outcome, however a divided or
 unified Vietnam will probably cast a
 heavy shadow across the independence
 of Laos and Cambodia but is likely to
 be so absorbed in its own problems as
 to be little threat to Thailand or other
 countries. Certainly It will not be con-
 trolled by China or any other outside
 power. And the useful American role
 in the whole region will be, as it 'al-
 ways should have been, not military in-
 volvement, but sympathetic concern
 and, where possible, economic and
 technical aid.
 Whether or not the two agreements
 -the one on American military disen-
 gagement and the so-called political
 constitute "peace with honor" is a se-
 mantic question that is not worth argu-
 ing over. The important point is that
 the first agreement is overwhelmingly
 in American and world interests and,
 in my judgment, is fortunately irrever-
 sible. There is not much profit either
 in discussing the historical might-have-
 beens. One cannot but wonder, how-
 ever, if this sort of American disentan-
 glement from our  Vietnam fiasco
 could not have been achieved by sim-
 pler, less Byzantine means a long time
 ago. My own guess is that the essen-
 tials - a  standstill cease-fire  maitr
 tained long enough to permit Ameri-
 can withdrawal and the return of our
 prisoners, together with the safe ac-
 ceptance of such a solution by both the
 American public and the world in gen-
 eral-could have been attained at least
 two years earlier, if we had admitted
 to ourselves the obvious fact that this
 was indeed the only safe and possible'
 outcome. But this is a bit of history,'
 that can never be rerun.
 The crucial question that remains is
 whether we have endangered the wise
 and essential first agreement by wrap-
 ping it up with the unrealistic second
 one. A cease-fire for the limited pur-
 pose of the first agreement would have
 been less susceptible  to disruption
 than the present  more generalized
 cease-fire, ostensibly for the purposes
 of both agreements. The involvement
 of our "honor" in the domestic peace
 of the Indochinese states' may justify'
 in some minds a thoroughly unwise
 continued American military presence
 in Thailand and runs some risk of
 sucking us back into the military quag-
 mire of Indochina. Our advocacy of
 entirely unrealistic plans to. resolve
 old and bitter disputes in Vietnam by
 harmonious unanimity and elections
 and our emphasis on "great power" in-
 ternational conferences in settling the
 affairs of Indochina can only confuse
 the American public about Southeast
 Asian realities and could lead to dan-'
 gerous self-delusions on the part of the
 administration. In short, while the gos-
 samer of the second agreement may
 seem to some a helpful cloak of '.
 "honor," I am afraid that it is more
 likely to prove an embarrassingly in- .
 visible new suit of clothes for the em-
 peror,

 ALSOP LOOKS BACK
 ON CHINA STORIES
 Columnist Sets Accuracy in
 Reporting in 1950's
 By DAVID K. SNIPLER
 Np`cIa1 to The New York Tlmen
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 31-To
 a reader whose memory reach-
 es back a decade or so, it might
 have seemed as if Joseph Alsop
 had done a sudden about-face
 on the subject of Communist
 China.  '
 Writing from Washington in
 1959, the columnist had de-
 scribed  China's, agricultural
 communes with adjectives such
 as "fearful" and "hideous" and
 "ruthless," concluding that In
 pursuing   their   policy   of
 "forced labor," Chinese leaders
 had "chosen to out-Stalin Stal-
 in."
 In December, 1972, beneath
 the dateline "Fei Cheng Com-
 mune, Yunnan Province," Mr.
 Alsop wrote of the "prosper-
 ous affairs" of a commune of
 "comparative wealth." "Amid
 the bougainvillea vines in the
 lovely ct tlrtyard it was all
 strangely sim~Ilar to a husinoas.
 like discussion with the man-
 agement of one of our large
 American industrial farms."
 Which is Alsop's Fable? Nei-
 ther. says the 62-year-old, col-
 umnist. He has not changed;
 China has.
 Everything Changed But People
 ".Everything  in  China  has
 to Secure a Ceasefire in Southeast Asia
 French colonial authorities.
 In 1945, after the Japanese troops
 had beery forced to evacuate Vietnam,
 De Gaulle, then President of France,
 somehow induced the British and U.S.
 governments to have their navies con-
 voy French troops to the Far East to
 restore French colonial rule in Viet-
 nam-an attempt which ended disas-
 trously at Dien Bien Phu. Most former
 colonies gained independence since
 1945 without having to fight wars
 against their rulers- but Vietnam and
 Algeria, France's ,two richest colonies,
 had to battle the colonial power for
 years, at the loss of many tens of thou-
 sands of lives.
 Spanel quotes several- statements by
 Pompidou and Schumann, but omits
 how these and other French leaders re-
 peatedly denounced the U.S. conduct of
 the war in Vietnam, bombing and min-
 ing of the North etc., without criticiz-
 ing a single time the Communists who
 invaded the South with most of their
 regular  army,  crossing  either  the
 "demilitarized" zone or violating the
 neutrality of Laos and Cambodia, thus ',
 provoking U.S. retaliation.
 Even in her modest role as' host to
 the negotiations (a role which a dozen
 ,other places could 'have filled as well,
 probably better) the. French govern-
 ment leaned clearly to the Communist
 side, permitting Communist, anti-U.S.'
 and' anti-Saigon demonstrations, obvi-
 ously designed to exert mob,pressure,,
 on the negotiators.                .
 The role of France concerning Viet-
 nam is therefore far from having con-
 firmed "the deep friendship between.
 the peoples of France and the United,
 States," as Spanel asserts at the end of
 his ad. But it cannot be based on falsi-
 fication of the historic record. Perhaps
 Monsieur Spanel could help to base
 relations between our two countries. on
 the truth, the whole truth and nothing
 but the truth, by inducing the French .
 government to publish all its classi-
 fied documents related to . Vietnam,

 lessly  resilient,  hard-working
 and clever Chinese people. The
 quality of life has changed, vast
 ly ? for the worse for the an-
 cient ruling class but ,for the
 better for everyone else."
 Joseph  Alsop's  month-long
 journey through China last au-
 tumn was a journey of per-
 ceptions, and his flood of col-
 umns from the mainland reflect-
 ed much of the new warmth of
 the revised American image of
 Chint.
 He described 'his trip as "the
 most  significant  reportorial
 work 'I have ever done," and

 Spent 4 Years in China
 Mr. Alsop spent four years
 In China in the nineteen-forties
 ardently backing Gen. Chiang
 Kai-shek against the Commu-
 nists and castigating American
 officials whose support for the
 Generalissimo seemed infirm.
 After  the  Communists  took
 power, Mr. Alsop became known
 as an exponent of the contain-
 ment pulleyy and later an a
 hawk on Vietnam.
 Now, during an interview in
 his Georgetown home, Mr. Al-
 sop speaks of the evolution of
 "a significant,, even a strong,
 community of interests between
 nuclear power, he said, "Given
 the consequences of a successful
 Soviet attack against China]
 I'm convinced that if the danger
 becomes much more serious, we
 ought to do everything in our
 power, which is  limited,  to
 go to China's aid."
 Would he have made such a
 statement 15 years ago? "No,
 because the  situation hadn't
 evolved, the Chinese Govern-
 ment hadn't evolved, and we
 were relatively vastly stronger.
 And the Soviets wouldn't have
 dared to do all the things you
 would have to expect the So-
 viets to do after a 'success in!
 China. I would have said it
 three years ago, four years ago
 -two, certainly. One's always
 a little slow in catching up
 with things."
 And what of his support for
 Chiang? "That was -28 years
 ago, and everybody in those
 days believed that Communism
 was a unitary phenomenon."
 Furthermore, he said: "If the
 other side had won in China, I
 think the chances are that "Chi-'
 na would appear more.prosper-1
 ous than it does today . . . al-
 though wealth would be less ev-
 enly distributed, certainly."
 Despite  Mr,  Alsop's  first-
 hand reporting of the current
 China, he has no doubts about
 the over.-all accuracy of the
 second-hand renor'tinft wd@
 necessary by the absence of
 American journalists in China
 during the nineteen-fifties and
 sixties.
 Only a Few Surprises

 threat began to be serious.'   was surprised by only a few
 things. First, ."that the after-
 -::ath of the second great con-
 vulsion-the Cultural Revolu-
 tion-was so relatively invis-
 ible."               .
 "Then, given one's experience
 of other Communist govern-
 ments, you didn't expect it to
 work quite so well," he said.
 "Finally, there's just the plain
 natural physical surprise. You
 go to a province that literally
 had no industry at all and
 find it bulging with industry."
 ?Mr. Alsop said 'in one column
 that he kept "thinking'nervously
 ,of all the woolly minded West-
 erners who made such fools
 ,of themselves in Russia in the
 cruel thirties," and he said in
 an interview, speaking of the
 Chinese system, "I may think it
 works better than it does work."
 But he added that the Chinese
 did not seem eager to hide any-
 thing. "They seemed awfully
 pleased to show me what they'd
 done."

 By linking these words with the

 'Manila curbs `excess'
 U.S. way calla
 4 slow bungling'
 By THOMAS PEPPER
 Sun Staff Correspondcut.
 Manila-Gen.  Carlos  P.
 Romulo, the Philippine sec-
 retary of foreign affairs and
 a former ambassador to the
 United States and the United
 Nations, said yesterday that
 Western-style democracy is
 not well suited to developing
 countries.
 Defending  his  govern-
 ment's imposition of martial
 law and the decision of Phil-
 ippine political leaders to re-
 place the American-inspired
 Constitution of 1935, General
 il:-,:min said that when West-
 ern-style democracy was im-
 planted in various developing
 societies, "the result was ex-
 cessive freedom."
 This was particularly true
 in the Philippines, he said.
 "While democracy may be
 the best 'form of govern-
 ment,"General Romulo said,
 i "it is slow, bungling and
 inefficient. An advanced so-
 ciety like the U.S. can be
 slow, humbling and ineffi-
 cient, and still continue to
 forge ahead."
 But, he continued, "in this
 day and age, a developing
 society has to develop fast.
 It cannot afford to bungle.
 Among people who never
 know where their next meal
 is coming from, free speech
 is a remote ideal, and cer-
 tainly less important than
 finding a means for bare
 .survival."
 General Romulo, who has
 been called by his military
 rank ever since he served as
 an aide to the late Gen.
 Douglas MacArthur in the
 World War II Philippine-
 American command, said he
 came to this view of democ-
 racy about two years ago,
 largely as a result of trips to I
 South Korea, Malaysia, Sin-
 gapore and Indonesia.
 Those countries, he said,
 have what he called a "mod-
 ified democracy," and each
 of them "is forging ahead
 much farther and faster than
 'we.
 "I felt," he said, "that,
 there was something wrong
 in our trying to make a
 carbon copy of American de;,
 mocracy here."
 General Romulo spoke in
 his somewhat faded office in
 .a classically designed build-
 ing once used by the prewar'
 American colonial ' adminis-
 tration.
 In a reference to the old
 constitution and to the coun- ?
 On the other s!de of the balance,;;
 there is the prospect of none of the
 American aid for reconstruction that the
 North Vietnamese leaders have been
 loudly boasting about. There is also the
 prospect  of  possible  pressure  from
 China, for the Chinese more and more '?
 seem to lean toward insisting that Hanoi
 keep the promises already made. There
 is even the prospect that President Nix.'
 on may once again prove to be cruelly
 unpredictable. So the betting Is even,
 either way.                       .
 try's slam-bang, circus-style,
 politics,  General  Romulo
 said the Philippines "had the
 skeleton of democracy, but
 not its flesh and blood.
 "Politics," he said, 'be-
 came an industry here. The.
 politicians . began to think
 they' were the rulers. They,
 each had bodyguards, and
 we were starting to have, as
 Chhina had, warlords, each
 with an army. This was a
 replica  of  the  American
 West, the frontier days."
 Part of the trend toward
 bodyguards and private ar-
 mies came, he said, from a
 decline in respect. for law
 during the wartime Japanese
 occupation.
 "Our. youth  then were {
 taught to cheat, lie, and kill
 in order. to survive.. It's not
 easy to shake. off this moral
 tone. Those kids then, some
 of them are our leaders
 now."
 A former journalist and
 university president, General
 Romulo was a longtime ad-
 vocate of Westernization for'
 Asia. He was one of the
 original signers of the United
 Nations Charter,' and  the
 first Asian to become presi-
 dent of the U.N. General
 Assembly. In 1947, he was
 chairman of a U.N.-spon-
 sored Conference on Free-
 dom 'of Information and of
 his past record, he said:
 "I have no regrets. I will
 still fight for freedom of
 speech  and civil liberties.
 However,  we must tinder-
 stand there are priorities in
 every country. We [in the
 Philippines] have tried to ig-
 nore the priorities that a
 developing society should im-
 pose on its people."
 "What we have needed

 one covering Cambodia and Laos, from
 which all "foreign troops"-including
 North Vietnamese-are to be with-
 drawn. For the North Vietnamese, that
 means no Cambodian bases; no Laotian
 babes; above all, no enormous, manpow-
 er-consuming supply system in Laos to
 keep the. Ho Chi. Minh Trail' in opera-
 tion. Without these crucial assets, and
 with the VC-NVA only controlling 5
 per cent plus of the South Vietnamese
 population, Hanoi cannot conceivably
 sustain 'a serious struggle In South Viet-

 The Pope, addressing people

 "Enough with war and guer-

 Pope Paul said It was neces-

 111HUNGARIANS HOPE
 TO REGAIN GROWN
 My RAYMOND H. ANDERSON
 Specint to The New York Times
 BUDAPEST, Feb. 9 - More
 '.than 28 years ago, as artillery
 of the advancing Soviet Army
 rumbled in the distance, a spe-
 cial train left Budapest for
 the Austrian border.
 Aboat'd was an. old black
 cask that required three keys
 to open. Inside was the golden
 Crown of St. Stephen, the sym-
 bol of Hungarian sovereignty
 "since it  was  presented  to
 Stephen nearly 1,000 years ago
 by Pope Sylvester H.
 r.  The crown fell into the hands
 of American troops near Salz-
 burg, Austria, in the spring of
 1945,' ahd  ever  since  has
 been an issue of contention
 between  Hungary    and  the
 United States.
 There is expectation In Bud-
 apest that this may be the year
 Hungary recovers the Crown of
 St. Stephen.
 Relations Improve
 The condition  imposed by
 -the United States for return of
 the crown has been a substan-
 tial Improvement in relations,
 and in the last year this ap-
 ppears to have been largely met.
 Last July Secretary of State
 William P. Rogers visited Duda-
 pest and Peter Valyi, .a Hun-
 garian Deputy Premier, is sched-
 uled to visit Washington.
 During the cold war and
 Hungary's imprisonment of Jo-
 zsef Cardinal Mindszenty, return
 of the 'crown was politically
 Inconceivable. it was also be-
 yond discussion when Cardinal
 Mindszenty was in asylum in
 the United States Embassy from
 1956 until 1971.
 The Cardinal has opposed
 any move to return the crown'
 while Hungary is under Com-
 munist rule. He is reported to
 have proposed that it'be sent
 to the Vatican. -  '
 A year. ago President Nixon'
 reportedly sent' a message Jo
 Cardinal  Mindszenty  saying
 that the United States would
 safeguard the crown "for the
 time being." Some European
 diplomats here are convinced
 that the Valyi visit will be fol'.
 lowed by an announcement on
 Its return.
 Hungarian ~ officials,  who
 talked freely before, now re-
 fuse to discuss the crown. Re-
 quests for ineetiugs with For
 eign  Ministry' officials  were
 .turned aside w1tb explanations
 WASHINGTON CLOSE-UP
 For most of the 1960s, the
 Russians appeared to be play-
 ing a game of catch-up with
 the United States in the field
 of strategic nuclear weapons.
 And where they were not ob-
 viously trying to match Amer-
 ican weapons, they were
 doing things that didn't make
 much sense to experts at .the
 Pentagon.
 Now, the Soviet Union is not
 only moving out on initiatives
 of its own but doing things -
 especially in its undersea
 strategic force - that make
 excellent sense' to U.S. ex-
 perts.
 Responding to the first Sovi-
 et Sputnik and the false mis-
 sile gap scare of 1960, the
 United States moved very
 rapidly in the early years of
 the decade. It developed and
 deployed a sophisticated land-
 based-missile, developed and
 deployed a fleet of invulnera-
 ble missile-carrying subma-
 rines and began to upgrade
 both of these weapons sys-
 tems.
 It
 It was not until near the end
 of the 1960s that the Soviet
 Union began to match these
 American developments. In
 some cases, the Soviet weap-
 ons were pretty close to car-
 bon copies of those of the
 United States. This was par-
 ticularly true with the Yankee
 class submarine which is very
 much like the early model
 Polaris subs.
 In other cases, the Soviets
 went off on what still appear
 to many U.S. experts to be
 expensive tangents. The most
 notable example was the de-
 that there were more important
 issues between Hungary and
 the United States,
 One such Issue is Hungary's
 desire to obtain most-favored-
 nation tariff privileges for her
 exports.
 "The crown is important to
 Hungary," a Foreign Ministry
 official said, "but there is noth-
 . ing further Hungary need do.
 The next move is up to the
 United States."
 The crown of St. Stephen
 acquired a mystic aura of
 Hungarian identity over the
 centuries.  It was used  for
 coronations, last in 1916 when
 Charles was crowned emperor
 of Austria-Hungary. According
 to an old saying, "he who holds
 the crown rules Hungary."
 Palace Search in Vain
 This symbolism was one rea-
 son for the annoyance of the
 ;Communist leadership that the
 crown was being held in the
 :United States, , reportedly  at
 'By ORR KELLY
 velopment of the fractional
 orbital bombardment system
 or FOBS. American scientists
 considered-and rejected--
 the development of such a
 system a. decade ago and it is
 still not clear why the Rus-
 sians thought it worth the
 enormous expense to develop.
 and deploy such a weapon.
 In an entirely new category
 is what the United States calls
 the Delta class submarine. It
 is quite different from any-
 thing in the U.S. arsenal -
 and it makes excellent sense
 to U.S. experts.
 *
 The Delta is similar to the
 Yankee class submarine. But
 it carries 12 missiles instead
 of 16. The extra space-provid-
 ed by removal of four missile
 tubes makes it possible for the
 Delta to carry a much longer
 missile - with a range of
 something like 4,500 miles
 compared to about 1,300 for
 the missile carried by the
 Yankee class. '
 This means the Delta class
 subs can be on station, their
 missiles aimed at targets in
 the United States, without
 passing through the gap be-
 tween Iceland and the Faeroe
 Islands into the main body of
 the North Atlantic.
 . The Delta class sub thus
 has some of the advantages
 .the United States hopes to
 achieve with its Trident sub-
 marines, the first of which
 will not be ready until 1978.
 Moreover, the Russians are
 probably getting these advan-
 tages at a substantially lower
 price than the 'United States.,
 The Delta is being built in the
 same yards as the Yankee
 and appears to be a natural
 follow-on design, talking full
 advantage of  the skills
 learned by those who built the
 Yankees.
 In contrast to what appears
 to be a smooth transition in
 the Soviet yards from the
 Yankee to the Delta, the con-
 struction of the. Trident sub-
 marines will be largely a
 fresh start. Even though the
 Trident will be superior, tech
 nologicaily, to the Delta, it'
 will probably also far surpass
 it in cost.
 The development of the Del-
 ta did not come entirely as a
 surprise to American experts.
 For several years now, it has
 'been known that a long-range
 missile that would not fit into,
 existing boats was under de-
 velopment and it was as=
 sunned that, at some point, we
 would see the development of
 a new submarine.
 But when it did show up, it
 did. so with startling speed. It
 was not until last spring that
 the United - States became
 aware, from satellite photos,
 that a 12-missile submarine
 was being built. This was only
 seven or eight months before
 the first of the new subs put to
 sea.
 Pentagon experts fully ex-
 pect that we will see more
 such rapid,-significant techno-
 logical developments ? by the
 Soviet Union in,the next few
 years and that some of them
 will be true,' and disturbing,

 BUDAPEST, Hungary, Feb. 7
 -An American business repre-
 sentative is expected to face a
 court here early next month
 accused of'running a flam-
 boyant  commercial  operation
 involving alleged bribery, gifts
 of new cars, bank accounts
 abroad for Hungarian accom-
 plices, black-market currency
 dealings and "violation of. of-
 ficial secrets."
 The American citizen, Dr.
 Tibor Glaz, is. described: here
 as the East European manager
 of the Ralston Purina Company.
 Dr.  Glaz was arrested  last
 year. About 20 Hungarians
 have been implicated in the
 case. Two are said to have
 committed suicide.
 The indictment, as published,
 would suggest that the affiar
 is an epic in chicken-feed and
 ,pig-feed salesmanship. .
 After months of what one
 resident-,here called "embarras-
 sed.silence,".the case came to
 light when a Budapest weekly,
 Hetfoi Hirek, printed an ac-
 count of the indictment.
 Hetfoi Hirek stressed that the
 Hungarians facing trial were
 "responsible officials" and that
 some had salaries as high as
 10,000 forints a month ($370),
 political implications in the af-
 fair. On the contrary, the long
 silence seemed to reflect con-
 cern about possible disruption
 of a recent significant improve-
 ment in relations between the
 United States and Hungary.
 According to the report on
 the indictment, Dr. Glaz first
 made an arrangement with Imr
 Szilagyi, manager of the. Pig-
 Fattening and Fodder-Mixing
 Joint Enterprise of the Kon-
 doros collective farm.
 Car Received is Left
 Under the arrangement, it
 was said, Dr. Glaz was to pay
 Mr. Szilagyi a commission of
 30 cents a ton upon the signing
 of a contract for 60,000 tons
 of pig-feed nutritives, or a total
 of $18,000, to be deposited In
 a West German bank.
 The police intervened, the
 report continued, before the
 arrangements were completed.
 But Mr. Szilagyi was said to
 have received 80,000 forints
 ($3,000) from a "motorcar mani
 pulation" as well as money fro
 a West German account during
 a,toruist trip abroad.

 known . to Fleet Street de-
 fense and police reporters.
 But-under a uniquely Brit-
 ish system, their newspapers
 voluntarily. refrained from
 publishing this informaion.
 The papers, however, had
 Lbricfly reported the arrest
 of an unnamed young cou-
 ple on the drugs charge and
 had identified the man sim-
 ply as the soil of the 1M.1.6
 chief. Stern,  the  German
 weekly magazine, followed
 up this clue and disclosed
 Sir 'John's )tame in its issue
 distribill.cd oil Wednesday.
 That released the l3rit.ish
 press from  its  obligation
 and the story was reported
 in this morning's London
 newspapers.
 Sir John either is about to
 or  already  has resigned
 from his post, which is offi-
 cially described as "deputy
 under secretary of state."
 Some  newspapers      here
 have           suggested that  Sir
 John has spent most of his
 professional life as a dry-as-
 dust                               commercial diplomat
 and was lately brought. into
 119.1.6 because of. his admiuis-
 t.rative skills.  .Knowing per-
 sons scoff at this. Indeed.
 the bare facts of his life
 available in the British
 "Who's Who" suggest a back-
 ground and series of cover
 posts to delight Ian Fleming,
 Graham Greene and Comp-
 ton MacKenzie.
 Sir John, an only son,. at-
 tended Wellington College,
 a "public" -that is private
 ---school in Berkshire. He
 gtudled at Italllol Collet:;e,
 Oxford, and then worked for
 ern Europe was from 1951 to
 1953, when he was first sec-
 retary at the embassy in
 Warsaw. This was followed
 by "counsellor, Foreign Of-
 fice" and "head of informa-
 tion,   research    depart-
 ment, Foreign Office." From
 1960 to 1.963, his biography
 simply says "Washington."
 He was "on loan to Civil
 Services Commission. during
 1966." The biography does
 not disclose when he be-
 came deputy tinder secre-
 Inry and hors of M.l.6, al-

 four years ago.
 Sir John, who lives in the
 fashionable Belgravia sec-
 tion of London, apparently
 was a painter of promise in
 his youth. Fie exhibited at
 the Royal Academy in 1930
 and  1931  and  the Paris
 Salon in 11932. He still lists
 painting as a hobby - along
 with "electronics,"  a  nice
 suggestion of British irony.
 Official sources tried to
 discourage the ? drawing of
 any connection between the
 arrest of Charles and Sir
 John's resignation, stressing
 that the spy chief is only 11
 months away from the nor-
 mal retirement age of 60.
 However,  persons  thor-
 .oughly familiar with intelli-
 :rr.nce procedures here said
 ;that the arrest of his son on
 .i o serious a charge maxle it
 jntpossible for Sir John to
 :continue. "There is a Cae-

 Ji'ou.r years ago,. Charles
 was convicted of possession
 of anari,ivana and fined $60,
 but his father's career was
 not affected by that inci-
 dent.
 Sir John's exposure and
 departure are not expected
 to have any' major repercus-
 sions on M.I.6, Sir John was
 too far up in the hierarchy,
 too remote from actual oper-
 atioins, to compromise any
 British spies in the field.

 :tone, but not the essential
 'nature of the intelligence

 All Britain Learns a Top Spy `Secret'
 By RICHARD EDER
 Special to The New York Times
 LONDON,. Feb. 8-When
 Charles Tatham Ogilvie Ren-
 nie was remanded last week
 to the Old Bailey on a charge
 of possessing heroin, he re-
 ceived a privilege that almost
 no other adult Briton would
 have enjoyed. The newspa-
 pers did not print his name.
 The reason was that Mr.
 Rennie, who is 23 and who
 works as an electrician in
 West London, had been iden-
 tified in the press as the son
 of the head of Britain's for-
 eign intelligence service, pop-
 ularly known as M.I. 6. The'
 British press is not permitted.
 to, disclose the name of this
 man-whose working title
 "C," was transmuted to "M,"
 for James Bond readers-nor
 that of the head of counter-
 intelligence, somtimes known
 as M.I.5.
 The ironies of the situa-
 tion became, fully apparent
 here yesterday. Stern, a West
 German magazine, printed C's
 name: ? Sir John Ogilvie Ren-
 nie. The Government's Press
 Security Committee decided
 that there was no point in
 maintaining the so-called_D
 Notice-a notification to edi-
 tors that a particular news
 item could: violate the secur-
 ity laws.
 And so last night and this
 morning the press displayed
 the news about Sir John with
 varying discretion--The Times
 of London tucked it away in
 a. tiny corner of page 2. The
 Daily Telegraph front-paged
 it, The Guardian printed a
 large portrait.
 It's No Secret
 The oddity about all this
 Is that Stern was not reveal-
 ing anything that could he
 called a secret when it used
 Sir John's name. Everyone
 with a serious professional
 interest in such matters-
 journalists, diplomats and ri-
 val intelligence services -
 knew it already.
 Similarly, they knew the
 name of his deputy, Maurice
 Oldfield, 'a former military
 intelligence officer who once.
 served as embassy counselor
 In Washington. Sir John has
 announced his retirement and
 Mr. Oldfield is mentioned as
 a likely candidate to head
 the organization, officially
 known as the Soerot Intelil-
 gence Service.
 Why the British Insist that
 such a commonly available
 bit of information is a secret
 puzzles foreigners and many
 Britons. They note that the
 identities and policies of the
 heads of the American Cen-
 tral Intelligence Agency and
 of many of its Western Eu-
 ropean equivalents are wide-
 ly discussed in the press in
 each country.
 British officials in charge
 of explaining  such things
 were keeping their upper lips
 very rigid today. "What is
 the use of having a secret
 service if you aren't going
 to be secret about it?" was
 the way one put it.
 Chapman  Pincher,  who
 writes on defense matters
 for The Daily Express, de-
 nounced  today  what                                                       he
 termed "this absurd secret"
 and argued that the identi-
 ties of the heads of both
 M.I.6 and. M.I.5 should be
 public.
 The present ' system; he
 said, is due to the "the path-
 ological  preoccupation  of
 Whitehall with secrecy." In
 addition, he wrote, it serves
 to shield the heads of the
 service when security scan-
 dals-of which M.I.6 has
 known several-blow up.
 E. H. Cookridge, an author
 who specializes  in intelli-
 gence topics and who is cur-
 rently writing a book about
 Sir  Mansfield   Cummings,
 founder of the British secret
 service's foreign operation,
 said that it was Sir Mansfield
 who began the tradition of
 anonymity.   '
 Originally a naval officer,
 Sir Mansfield, who died in
 1923, insisted  on  being
 known simply as "0," and
 the initial has stuck.
 Officials  maintain . that
 anonymity         helps preserve
 the private life of Britain's
 intelligence chiefs. But the
 to everybody in his club,
 and is pointed out to guests,
 is almost as venerable as
 the service itself. Sir John's
 club is Brooks's, but White's
 is more traditional for M.I.
 6 chiefs.        '
 Some Cozy Assumptions
 The rather cozy class as-
 sumptions that lie behind the
 notion that what is all right
 for members of White's or
 Brook's to know is a security
 breach when other readers of
 The  'inns know about It
 have tended to pervade M.I. 6
 itself
 Originally both the Secret
 Intelligence Service and its
 part, the Security Service,
 were branches of Military In-
 telligence. It is from that
 time that the initials M.I. 6
 and M.I. 5 under the Home
 Office, though both retain a
 Defense Ministry link.
 The traditions of M.I. 6, as
 put together by Sir Mansfield
 and more or less continued
 by his successors, have rested
 largely on what has been
 called brilliant amateurism.
 One of the earliest British
 spies was the poet Christo-
 pher Marlowe, who inflitrated
 British Roman Catholic exile
 circles in the service of the
 Duke of Guise in Rheims.
 The literary tradition was
 continued in modem times
 not only by Ian Fleming but
 by Graham Greene and Mal-
 colm Muggeridge, who joined
 the service during World War
 Jr. The talent that wartime
 could attract tended to drop
 off in peace time, however,
 and the improvisation often
 remained, but without the
 brilliance.
 The combination of impro-
 visation with the 'kind of
 camaraderie that earned' for
 M. I. 6 operatives the nick-
 name "the Friends" - the
 counterspies in M.I. 5, several
 degrees down socially, were
 regarded by M.I. 6 as crude
 policemen and were called
 "the Snoopers"-nearly des-
 troyed the service in the nine-
 teen fifties."
 A Blow to Tradition
 The exposure of Kim Philby,
 a high M.I. 6 official, as the
 "third man" in the Burgess-
 Maclean affair was king' de-
 layed because his colleagues
 simply could not credit the
 assertions of the Snoopers
 that here was a spy in their
 midst.
 The appointment in the late
 nineteen-fifties of Sir Dick
 White, head of M.I. 5, as "C"
 was a heavy blow to the tra-
 dition of the secret service.
 According to those who have
 written on the subject, pro-
 fessionalism was increased
 and some free-swinging tend-
 encies were curbed.
 The appointment of._ Sir
 John Rennie four years ago
 was another move to bring
 M.I. 6 into the normal chan-
 nels of bureaucracy. Sir John,
 a diplomat, was the first "C"
 whd enmo from outside the
 Intelligence community, and
 his background made it pos-
 sible for the Foreign Office
 to exercise more control.

 Prime Minister Palme blames war with Vietnam,
 calls. for reconstruction `channeled through UN'
 By Takashi Oka
 Staff correspondent of
 The Christian Science Monitor
 Stockholm
 Prime Minister Olof Palme of Sweden
 hopes for an "integrated international ef-
 fort," channeled if possible through the
 United. Nations, to aid the postwar recon-
 struction. of North and South Vietnam. Swe-
 den, he said in an interview here, would
 "definitely" participate in such an effort.   .
 Outside the Prime Minister's office, fur-
 nished in clean-lined Swedish modern, the
 sky was gray, and rain drifted across the
 window panes. Despite the unseasonal lack of
 snow, It seemed a far cry from this handsome
 northern city, capital of one of the world's
 richest, most thoroughgoing welfare states,
 to the red dirt, the beating sun, the palm-leaf
 shelters, and black-trousered farmers of
 Vietnam.
 Yet Vietnam casts its long shadow across
 Swedish relations with the United States.
 "Few people are so pro-American as the
 Swedes," Mr. Palme says. But since the
 American military involvement in Vietnam
 began, Stockholm's official ties with Wash-
 ington have been as wintry as the chill winds
 blowing in across the Baltic Sea from Russia.
 What causes freeze
 The freeze is not of their choice, Swedes of
 many different shades of opinion say. Thorb-'
 jorn Falldin - a rugged, blue-eyed farmer
 from Harnosand in the north and leader of the
 Center Party, principal opposition to Mr.
 Palme's Social Democrats, characterizes
 Vietnam as the only problem between the
 United States and Sweden, and maintains
 that while his countrymen want good rela-
 tions with America, they feel they have the
 right to say they cannot understand Amer-
 ica's role in Vietnam.
 Posters of grieving Vietnamese mothers
 festoon Stockholm's' windows alongside entic-
 ing displays of the latest gadgets of a
 consumer  society.  Leftist' demonstrators
 shouting fierce slogans march up to Parlia-
 ment Square without disturbing youngsters
 briskly selling buttoms opposing "leftist ex-
 tremism" and showing a Swedish-American
 handshake. "We've sold 300,000 of these
 buttons," said Peter, a 'student in languages,
 "and Sweden has a population of only 8
 million."
 Attitudes explained
 Mr. Palme, who treats his enormous prime
 ministerial office like a book-lined profes-
 sor's study, and who flings himself into -a
 chair to confront a visitor with the relish of a
 tutor confident of instant rapport with his
 students, explains Swedish attitudes on Viet-
 nam as a compound of three major factors:
 First, he says, comes the "human reaction
 against the bombing and against the up-
 rooting of a whole society."
 Second is the feeling that the Vietnam war
 represented the continuation of an old colo-
 vial war, the Americans having taken over
 for their own, global, anti-Communist pur.
 poses, the war the French had been waging to
 preserve their colonial empire.
 Third, as a small, nonaliegned nation,
 Sweden feels it was very much in its own
 interest to assert Vietnam's right to indepen-
 dence and self-determination free of super-
 power intervention. Detente between the
 superpowers was to be welcomed, but it. did
 involve a certain danger for smaller coun-
 tries in between - the danger that their
 voices would be ignored.
 Comparison defended
 Asked if he did not think that his references
 in a pre-Christmas broadcast comparing the
 American bombing of Hanoi with Guernica,
 Lidice, and other instances of mass slaughter
 were not too strong, Mr. Palme replied:
 "You must remember the circumstances. r
 The bombing had been going on for nearly a
 week. I had just received a telephoned report
 from our embassy in Hanoi about the
 destruction of the Bach Mai Hospital, to
 which Sweden had contributed equipment
 and medical supplies. The call came through
 as clearly as someone talking in the next
 room. So as I went on the air I was thinking of
 burning patients, of terror-stricken chil-
 dren."
 Repercussions noted
 Mr. Palme's broadcast comments caused
 President Nixon to ask Stockholm not to send
 a newly appointed ambassador to Washing-
 ton,  and to keep the American charge
 d'afaires in Sweden, who had been home in
 the United States on holiday, from returning
 to his post. This situation still continues.
 But the Paris peace agreement now opens
 the possibility of a new period, both in
 Vietnamese history and in that of Sweden's
 relations with the United States. "Once this
 frightful war is over, I have no fear for the
 future of American-SWedisFt Eidtitfi6te," l</div></div></div>  </div>
