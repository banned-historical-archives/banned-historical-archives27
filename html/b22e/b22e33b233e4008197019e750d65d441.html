 STATUS OF SOVIET MILITARY PERSONNEL IN CUBA
 I.    The role of the Soviet military in Cuba has
 changed since the missile crisis of October
 1962.  Since then the majority of Soviet mili-
 tary personnel have been withdrawn.
 A.    Most of the Soviets now in Cuba are advisers
 and technicians.  They are training Cubans
 and are supervising the use and mainte-
 nance of Soviet equipment.   The SAM system
 is still controlled and largely manned by
 Soviets.
 B.    There are no organized Soviet ground combat
 units now in Cuba.  The only Soviet ground
 forces personnel now in Cuba are those ad-
 vising Cuban military units.
 C.    We estimate present Soviet military strength
 in Cuba between 4,000 and 7,000 men.   This
 figure will remain fairly constant until
 Cuban SAM training has been completed.   At
 that time more Soviet personnel will probably
 be withdrawn,

 II.   Soviet strategic missiles and bombers were with-
 drawn from Cuba last year.   All Soviet weapons
 now in Cuba--except the surface-to-air missiles
 and possibly the FROG tactical rockets--have
 been transferred to Cuban control.
 A.    Cubans have taken over the 42 MIG-21 jet
 fighters,  the 12 Komar guided missile patrol
 boats, the tanks and ground forces equip-
 ment at the former Soviet armored camps,
 and probably the cruise missile system.
 B.    The Soviets still operate the SAM system,
 but Cubans have completed classroom train-
 ing in SAM operations.  Last month, Cubans
 began operational field training, probably
 at all 24 SAM sites on the island.  Cubans
 now are training in all elements of the
 air defense system,   They probably already
 control some radar sites in the system.
 They will probably be able to operate the
 entire air defense system,  including the
 surface-to-air missiles,.by the middle of
 1964.

 I.   Nasir's control of Egypt is firm and unchallenged.
 However, his hopes of Arab unity have been set
 back.
 A.      Syria's break from Egypt in September 1961
 damaged Nasir's prestige,   He has not fully
 repaired this damage.
 1.   Nasir is still the Arabs' leading spokes-
 man.   This was indicated recently in the
 favorable response to his call for an
 Arab "Summit" meeting for 13 January to
 discuss the Jordan waters problem.
 B.     Nasir, as the Arabs' leader, is making a mas-
 sive effort to sustain the pro-Egyptian re-
 gime in Yemen.
 1.   This effort has cost Egypt more than
 $50 million since Nasir intervened in
 September 1962.
 2.   Nasir further drained Egypt's resources
 during the Moroccan-Algerian border

 planes, and advisers.
 Cairo now relies more and
 loans to meet its obligations.
 1.   Foreign lenders are openly worried about
 this practice and about Egypt's occasional
 failure to make payments on time.
 2.   Sales of this year's good cotton crop
 have helped overcome the current for-
 eign exchange difficulty.   The long-
 term prospects, however, are not bright.
 D.   An austerity program may yet salvage the
 situation,
 1.   Nasir must cut his grandiose develop-
 ment plans sharply.   He must also make
 various other internal economic reforms
 recommended by Western advisers,
 2a   There is some preliminary evidence that
 he is accepting this advice.   However,
 as in the past, political requirements
 may force Nasir to overrule sound eco-
 nomic practice.

 I.   There is a military stalemate in Yemen between
 Egyptian and Yemeni royalist forces.
 A.   The UN Observer Mission's mandate expires
 on 4 January, but Saudi Arabia may agree to
 an extension.
 B.   Crown Prince Faysal has stockpiled arms for
 the royalists on the Saudi side of the
 border, but none have gone over.
 C.   Faysal probably will not resume aid to the
 royalists if UNYOM continues.
 D.   Nasir has withdrawn almost no troops from
 Yemen, so that he still has more than 300,000
 there.
 II.   There has been no progress toward an internal
 political settlement between royalists and
 republicans.
 A.   The Egyptians seem unwilling to accede to
 Yemeni demands for a more representative
 regime because they are afraid such a regime
 would be anti-Egyptian.

 IRAQ
 1.   The Baathists who overthrew Qasim last February
 were in turn ousted from power in Iraq in Novem-
 ber.  As a result, the Iraqi Army has ultimate
 control.
 A.   The Baathists are gradually being eased out
 of power.  A number of them, however, retain
 their cabinet and army posts.
 B.   The regime is taking a more friendly attitude
 toward Nasir, but will not limit Iraq's
 sovereignty by moving toward union with Egypt.
 C.   The possibility of union between Iraq and
 Syria is becoming more remotes
 II.   Bad winter weather has forced virtual suspension
 of Iraq's campaign against the Kurds.
 A.   The regime now appears anxious to settle
 the three-year-old ware
 B.   We have reports that Iraqi and Kurdish lead-
 ers now are negotiating a settlement.

 when the Baathist regime in Iraq was overthrown.
 A.       Nasirists, though decimated, are still a
 threat to the regime.
 B.       Baath party leaders differ among themselves
 and are jockeying for.power.
 1.   One faction wants to cooperate with other
 anti-Nasir elements--including old-line
 political leaders.
 2.   Another more doctrinaire Baathist group
 opposes this.
 C.   There is still the possibility of an Egyp-
 tian-supported coup against the regime.
 1.   We have considerable reporting on Egyp-
 tian activities along this line, but
 Egyptian effectiveness is not determined.
 D.   The Syrian Army is the key element.

 ning the country behind the facade of

 I.   Israeli-Arab relations are becoming more tense
 as the Israeli project for diverting water from
 the Jordan River basin nears completion.
 A.   Tests of the system's pumps will begin near
 the end of January.   Large-scale water with-
 drawals are scheduled to begin in mid-1964.
 B.   The Arab states evidently do not plan to re-
 spond with any overt military action, as
 they have threatened.   They may, however,
 resort to sabotage.
 C.   The Nasir-inspired summit conference of
 Arab leaders, to be held on 13 January,
 will focus on this problem.
 1.   Nasir probably wants other Arab leaders
 to acknowledge that military counter-
 measures are not yet feasible.
 2.   Some agreement on diplomatic and propa-
 ganda measures against the Israelis may
 result.

 D.   Nasir has said publicly that he is reluctant
 to go to war with Israel over the Jordan's
 waters.
 II.   Nasir knows that Israel is better able to fight
 a conventional war than is any combination of
 Arab  forces.
 A.   Egypt is attempting to neutralize this
 superiority by developing surface-to-sur-
 face missiles--with the assistance of West
 German scientists--and by acquiring more
 modern equipment from the USSR.
 1.   The Egyptians are not likely to be able
 to deploy more than a few SSM's over the
 next five years.  We believe these will
 be of doubtful reliability and limited
 25X6A   effectiveness.

 THE SOVIET ECONOMY
 I.   The Soviet economy may be at the most important
 crossroad in its history.
 A. Soviet leaders face the dilemma of mounting
 pressure from consumers for an improved
 standard of living while military programs
 are increasingly taking away the best ma-
 terial and manpower from civilian economic
 development.  At the same time, slowing
 economic growth rates disturb the regime.
 B. The state of economy--particularly agri-
 culture--is such that half-measures and
 organizational manipulations will no longer
 suffice to effect necessary improvements.
 1.      The economy in 1963 registered one of
 the poorest performances in postwar;'
 history.  The estimated increase in
 industrial production--around 7 percent--
 is well below increases achieved in the
 early years of the Seven-Year plan
 (1959-65).
 2.   There was little if any improvement in
 the standard of living.   The housing

 goal was underfulfilled by nearly 20
 percent.
 3. Grain production was well below the
 mediocre 1962 harvest.   Ten million tons
 of Western grain are to be imported in
 1963/64, which will drain Soviet gold
 reserves.
 II. Khrushchev's decision--at least for now--appears
 to call for limiting military spending in favor
 of programs which he believes will promote eco-
 nomicgrowth' and agriculture. ?Thi's was clearly seen
 in data presented at the'Soviet? Central Committee
 and Supreme Soviet meetings early in December.
 A.       A massive development of the chemical
 industry--particularly for fertilizer--
 is the key feature of Khrushchev's latest
 panacea for Soviet economic ailments.
 1. The equivalent of $85 billion has been
 earmarked for this program over the
 next seven years--an amount equal to
 total investment for all purposes last
 year.
 2. Two hundred new chemical plants are-to be
 built and 500 reconstructed during the
 1964-70 period--compared to less than

 50 built in the last five years.
 B.   The program also calls for large-scale in-
 vestments in agriculture and irrigation.
 III.      Detailed information in 1964-65 economic plans
 indicates;that Khrushchev's program is to be
 implemented without delay.
 A.   Chemical investments are to increase 44 per-
 cent next year.   During the next two years
 investment devoted to agriculture,  food
 industries, and light industries will grow
 substantially.
 B.   Soviet foreign trade organizations--as soon
 as the plan was published--began active ne-
 gotiations with Japan, West Germany, and
 the UK for needed chemical equipment.
 ,IV.     Over the next two years this program will force
 restrictions on other parts of the economy.
 A.   Ferrous metallurgy goals for 1965 have been
 scaled back.
 B.   The machine-building industry is also to
 reduce its annual rate of increase but
 output of chemical and oil equipment is to
 increase 50 percent over the next two years.
 C.   Housing construction and consumer services
 such as medical care are to be restricted.

 D.    The expected increase in pensions and min-
 imum wages will be delayed.
 V.    The effect on military spending under the new
 economic direction is not yet clear but Khrushchev
 will probably trim some military programs.
 A.    Both the 1964-65 economic plan and budget
 intended to underscore Moscow's present
 posture of "peaceful coexistence,"
 B.    Military expenditures in the 1964 budget are
 about 4 percent below those planned for 1963.
 The budget reveals only a  portion of total
 military financing, however, and is not an
 accurate indication of real spending.
 C.    The science allocation, much of which goes
 into military research programs, is scheduled
 to increase at the lowest rate of recent
 years
 D.    Substantial increases in requirements for
 civilian machinery suggest that military
 hardware programs will have to slow down--
 thus reversing a trend of the last several
 years.   The major effect, however, will
 probably be in conventional weaponry.
 E. Khrushchev has spoken of reducing military
 manpower levels, but no action is yet,.apparent.

 A reduction from the present 3.25-3.5 million
 would be a welcome addition to the civilian
 labor market but would not solve the problem
 of scarcity of technical resources.
 VI. These are the prospects for the next two years:
 Requirements for-the chemicalprogram!will
 increase pressures within the economy--par-
 ticularly if the Soviets are not successful
 in their current effort to obtain on credit
 greatly increased amounts of Western industrial
 equipment.
 There will be more chemicals for agricultre
 but it is unlikely that they will produce the
 miraculous effect that Khrushchev seems to
 expect.   Organizational shortcomings and lack

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S ECONOMY
 I.     The Chinese economy is stagnant.   The regime
 still cannot clothe its people as well as it
 did in the 1950's.
 A.     The Chinese are worried over the popula-
 tion growth.   The outlook is bleak for
 the Chinese people, since there is little
 chance that production of consumer goods
 will increase subtantially over the next
 few years.
 B.     This year's grain harvest was only mediocre,
 chiefly because of prolonged drought in
 the south and severe flooding in the north.
 1.      Current grain output is no higher than
 it was in 1957.   Now, however,  the Chi-
 nese have 75 million more people to
 feed.
 2.      Food will have to be imported again in
 the coming year to maintain present
 levels of consumption, which are already
 well below those of 1957.   The Chinese
 have imported five million tons of grain
 per year since 1961.

 3.     The higher priority accorded agricul-
 ture has not helped.   Effective agri-
 cultural recovery will require a long-
 term program of sizable   investments
 and technical improvements.
 C.     Western visitors report that Chinese in-
 dustry has great technical difficulties,
 misu%dXjb r, and much unused capacity.
 1.                                              most
 Chinese industry is producing at
 better than 1957 levels.
 If the Chinese are to develop modern,
 complex industries, they will need
 to import modern equipment and to ob-
 tain technological know-how.
 Chinese trade with the Soviet bloc dropped more
 than 65 percent between 1959 and 1962--from
 $2.9 billion to $1.3 billion.   China's trade
 with the Free World, which consists primarily
 of food imports by China, now is greater than
 Peiping's trade with the bloc.
 A.     The Chinese have been shopping in European
 and Japanese markets, but aside from their
 purchases of food grains, they have bought
 little.

 B.        This reluctance to buy indicates both the
 tight Chinese foreign exchange position
 and Peiping's indecision in setting long-
 range planning goals.
 III.   We have little evidence of recent long-range
 planning.
 A.        The Third Five-Year Plan (1963-67) has
 been largely ignored in Peiping's announce-
 ments.
 B.        Year-to-year planning will probably continue
 until there are some signs of recovery in
 the depressed economy.

 RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS BY SOVIET LEADERS
 I.   Soviet leaders over the past month have under-
 scored their hope that President Kennedy's as-
 sassination would not disrupt the relaxation
 in East-West relations set in motion by last sum-
 mer's nuclear test ban treaty.
 A.    Khrushchev publicly voiced "profound sym-
 pathy and feelings of indignation" over
 the "heinous assassination."  He expressed
 satisfaction that President Johnson in-
 tends to continue the Kennedy policy of
 peaceful settlement of disputes, improv-
 ing Soviet-US relations, and halting the
 cold war.
 B. Khrushchev has emphasized "peaceful competi-
 tion," negotiations, and disarmament.  He
 expressed hope that 1964 will witness
 "development of relations of peaceful co-
 operation, good neighborliness and friend-
 ship" between the US and USSR.

 1. He welcomed recent Congressional action on
 trade with the Soviet Union and said
 "seeds have been sown which prompt Ameri-
 can business circles to believe that the
 expansion of trade ties is advantageous
 to both sides."
 II.   On disarmament, Khrushchev is seeking to capitalize
 on the announced cut in Soviet military spending
 and the possibility of "further reductions" in
 the armed forces.
 A.    He has called on other governments to emulate
 this example:   "I would call it a policy of
 mutual example in the curtailment of the arms
 race."
 1.   In addition to his usual bold statements
 that "we are ready immediately to con-
 clude a disarmament agreement,"'Khrushchev
 has renewed familiar proposals for "par-
 tial measures:"
 III.    The Soviets continue to issue periodic reminders
 of their determination to stand by Cuba.
 A.   In mid-December, Khrushchev charged "US ag-
 gressive military circles" are again spread-
 ing tension-around Cuba.

 1.   He warned "gentlemen aggressors" not to
 "play with fire" and said "Cuba will not
 remain defenseless should aggressive
 and militarist circles of the US attack
 it."
 IV.    Soviet leaders are avoiding provocative state-
 ments regarding Berlin and Germany.
 A.   In recent speeches, Kosygin and Brezhnev
 confined themselves to  repeating standard
 calls for a German peace treaty and trans-
 formation of West Berlin into a "free city."
 V.   Khrushchev's recent public assurances of strong
 support for Afro-Asian "liberation struggles`."
 were designed primarily to undercut Chinese
 Premier Chou En-lai's current African tour.
 A.   He stressed that peaceful coexistence does
 not mean a "reconciliation with imperialism"
 or "curtailing the national liberation move-
 ment."
 1.   He repeated his standard line that "we
 have never exported revolution and never
 shall, but we have always supported and
 shall continue to support in every way
 the peoples who rise up in the sacred
 struggle against imperialism."

 B.    Soviet preoccupation with blunting the Chi-
 nese appeal was also reflected in Khru-
 shchev's 27 December prediction that the
 "Americans will be thrown out of South Viet-
 nam just as surely as the French were thrown
 out of North Vietnam and Algeria."
 1.   He urged Americans to withdraw grace-
 fully and save "their face in good time.
 VI.   The Soviets continue to avoid direct polemical
 attacks on the Chinese.
 A.    While Khrushchev's 70th birthday message to
 Mao Tse-tung on 26 December met the ritual
 requirements of the occasion, it reflected
 the chilly atmosphere in both personal and
 party relations.
 1.   The message made no reference to Mao's
 personal role in Chinese achievements;
 it congratulated the Chinese "people"
 and party only.
 2.   Its only reference to the dispute was
 in remarks regarding the importance
 of unity and the ability to "survive
 any tests."

 RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS BY CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERS
 I.    The Chinese Communist leaders have a distorted
 insular view of the outside world.
 A.       They Are confident that events are running
 inevitably in their favor.
 1.  A favorite slogan is "the East wind is
 prevailing over the West."
 B.       They believe that people throughout Asia,
 Africa and Latin America--the "have note"
 --are potential supporters of the militant
 Chinese view.
 C.       They constantly encourage "oppressed people"
 everywhere to engage in "national liberation
 struggles," but avoid specifying who these
 people are.   In part this is because in
 most areas the Chinese are incapable of
 providing anything but verbal support.
 South Vietnam is a major exception.
 II.    On his current North African tour, Premier
 Chou En-lai is trying to soften China's
 warlike image by assuming a pose of peace and
 moderation.

 A. His primary objective appears to be to ,
 undercut US, Soviet, and European influence.
 1.       While there is little evidence that he
 has had success in accomplishing this,
 he has probably been able to identify
 Peiping more closely with African
 aspirations.
 III. The Chinese are more realistic about internal
 problems than they are about the outside world.
 A.   A few years ago they were overoptimistic
 and believed they could build a strong,
 modern China in less than a decade.
 B.   Now, however, after several years of grave
 economic difficulties, they frankly tell
 the Chinese people that the country is
 extremely poor and backward.  They say it
 will take decades of hard work to overcome
 this backwardness.
 C. They are determined to press ahead with.a
 broad program to build nuclear weapons,
 supersonic aircraft and guided missiles.
 1.   Foreign Minister Chen I said last Octo-
 ber that China intends to produce nuclear
 weapons even at the expense of consumer
 goods.
